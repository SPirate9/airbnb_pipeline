218741,33817153,2015-06-01,26751381,Wendy,"Tom and Corrine's place worked out perfectly for us!  It was spotlessly clean, we had everything we needed and more!  It is in a quiet neighborhood and parking was not an issue for us.  It is near enough to the Heart of Ballard that we spent more time out than in!  Can highly recommend this place and we will definitely be open to staying there again.  We did meet both Tom and Corrine although briefly, as our schedules did not line up.  They were both super nice and friendly, maybe next time we will have more time to chat with them to hear about their travels!  They were wonderful with check in time, it was hard for us to pin down an exact arrival time and having the coded private entry made that a non-issue!  Thanks Tom & Corrine!!"
218741,40223120,2015-07-29,35239326,Patricia,"
Corinne made us feel very welcome: checked on our time of arrival, greeted us, showed us around and how to use the door.  I loved the twinkle lights at the proper gate and around the door entry. "
218741,48013254,2015-09-22,11331448,Lauren,"My first Airbnb experience and it was fantastic! Corinne and Tom have a wonderful space that is clean, comfortable, private, and super cute. It's just as depicted and in a friendly, charming neighborhood. We loved having the media room available to hang out in and felt welcomed and comfortable the whole time. "
218741,51101702,2015-10-17,33779243,Siserra,"Corrine is awesome! It was such a pleasure to meet you. :) The space is super cozy - it feels like you have a whole apartment to yourself! Decor was neat, shower pressure was perfect and the vibe was just right. She also let us stash our bikes in her garage, which was super helpful. In a great location and with tons of information about Seattle provided. Highly recommend to other guests!"
2039149,10098216,2014-01-30,992967,Patrick,"We a great stay at Blair's place in Ballard.  The place was super clean and cozy.  Great decor and atmosphere.  And Blair was a great host...very friendly and easy to communicate with.

2039149,10938893,2014-03-14,10469034,Yang,This is my first time to rent a house on Airbnb and it's really a great experience to stay in Blair's house. The house is very comfortable and get everything we need. It's not far from Seattle Downtown and it takes only like 20 mins to space needle and pike market. The neighborhood is quiet and beautiful. Thanks Blair for the arrangement.
2039149,11173556,2014-03-24,1114714,Sara,"My friends and I stayed here for 4 nights and had a fantastic time. The house is comfortable, clean, and spacious. It's located in a super cute neighborhood and is just a short ride from downtown (where I needed to be for a work meeting). Blair was very accommodating about our request to check in early and check out late. Highly recommended!  "
2039149,11287855,2014-03-28,13142092,Mimi,It is a beautiful house! We have 7 people and everybody enjoyed the place! Blair is very friendly and he answered every questions that we have. The house has everything that we need. It is very easy and safe to park our car on the street outside the house. We have a wonderful trip in Seattle! Thank you very much Blair!
2039149,11693186,2014-04-12,10453087,Taylor,"Our company frequently hosts out of town employees for summits and conferences, so we needed a home with multiple bedrooms that would be comfortable for a weeks' stay. Blair was an excellent host, very communicative and the home received rave reviews from our team. We will definitely go to Blair first the next time we have out of town guests! Thanks so much!"
2039149,11745207,2014-04-14,1571760,Melissa,Great location and the beds are heavenly! Blair was a wonderful host! Thank you!

2039149,12056191,2014-04-22,12348086,Anne,Our host was helpful and informative. The neighborhood is very nice and the house was great. I recommend staying here.
2039149,12828727,2014-05-12,13578279,M,"Great location, and a nicely appointed home base for our weekend in Seattle. Blair was great to deal with, responded to all inquiries promptly, and accommodated all of our needs.  "
2039149,13649013,2014-06-02,11493122,Megan,"We booked Blair's Ballard home for my family's trip to Seattle for our wedding. Booking was easy and Blair was always responsive to our questions. The family didn't needed anything during our stay, but it was great knowing our host was easily accessible. This house very comfortably fit seven guests and has great common area space. The patio got a lot of use! This house is a quick walk to many restaurants and coffee shops and an easy drive to the city's major attractions. Thanks so much for your hospitality! We would highly recommend Blair's home for your trip. "
2039149,14077962,2014-06-11,227061,John,"Great house in a nice, quiet neighborhood with easy access to Ballard and Fremont. The house was clean, comfortable and all-around ""homey""! Definitely recommended for those who would like to explore Seattle's outer neighborhoods. "
2039149,14400572,2014-06-18,15492200,Steven,"Blair was an awesome host. He provided us with all pertinent information about the listing and everything we needed to know about check-in/check-out. The home was very nice, equipped and furnished just like the description said. I would highly recommend to anyone who is staying in the seattle area and is looking for a spacious home in a quiet location within public transportation range of downtown seattle."
2039149,14730282,2014-06-25,7507989,Susan,"I booked this home for family to stay at while visiting me in Seattle. It was clean and comfortable. The neighborhood is quiet and close to many amenities, including grocery stores, restaurants, shops and the freeways. Plenty of street parking available. "
2039149,15316190,2014-07-07,15014652,Hilary,"We had such a great a experience staying in this house. A group of ten of us stayed here to celebrate a friend's upcoming wedding and we couldn't have had a better time! We especially loved the little back patio with lights strung overhead...perfect for a summer dinner party. Blair was an excellent host, very accommodating and responsive to my questions about the house before our stay.Though we never actually met, he was a pleasure to work with and I would definitely consider staying here again!  "
2039149,15491872,2014-07-10,14416842,Mimi,"Blair responded quickly to my messages and was easy to communicate with. The house was pretty warm during the day because we happen to be there when it was quite hot in Seattle but we were out most of the time anyway so it wasn't too bad. It was cool at night so we opened the windows and there were several fans around which helped a lot. Other than that, the house was comfortable and clean. "
2039149,15743999,2014-07-15,11418181,Deborah,"Nice comfortable home w good instructions 
although I am a dunce w Netflix. No screens and
No AC which I found out was norm in Seattle so
Watch for heat waves when you visit. Roomy
Place w great kitchen so you can really cook! 
Clean and nice beds too! "
2039149,16419161,2014-07-27,14093887,Michelle,The host was great and everything was set up for us when we got to the property. The beds were incredibly comfortable and everything was wonderful.
2039149,16467376,2014-07-28,15769034,Nani,"We had a great experience at this house! We stayed for one night for a bachelorette party, and the house was a great size for the 8 of us that stayed overnight. We enjoyed sitting out on the patio during the day as well. I would definitely recommend this place to anybody looking to stay in the Ballard area!"
2039149,17091263,2014-08-07,14249894,Carole,"Great place! Very comfortable, nice soft sheets, clean and more than enough room for our six-person family. The kids loved the little basement area. Ballard has become a really lovely neighborhood, too."
2039149,17736501,2014-08-17,8779440,Stephen,"Overall we were very pleased with the house - it was clean and nicely appointed. Blair was very easy to communicate with.  Street parking was easy and it was located in a quiet neighborhood close to a grocery store and park.

The only downside was that it was pretty hot during our stay so we had to open windows and as previous reviewers noted there weren't any screens. 

I would strongly recommend this place to stay when visiting Seattle."
2039149,17856925,2014-08-18,18101438,Stella,"Blair was great! His directions and notes were perfect and the house was as described.
The neighbourhood was quiet and the backyard was a great place to sit and chat."
2039149,17979117,2014-08-19,19811862,Shang-Yan,The host was very helpful and provided timely replies. The listing was pretty accurate. The neighborhood is in a nice area and a 20 minute car ride without traffic. Would recommend this to others. 
2039149,18229809,2014-08-24,13425822,Sunisa,"The house is very nice, clean and cozy. It has everything we need. The area is nice and quiet. We had a great time there. Blair is easy to work with and very quick in replying all emails. I would definitely recommend Blair's house to all my friends if they come to Seattle."
2039149,18404497,2014-08-26,16204997,Anne,"The house was perfect! Especially if you love vintage charm. (Which I do).  There were 6 of us, so this place really had an unbeatable price when you consider what enough rooms at a hotel would have cost us. I highly recommend it. Also, prior to arriving, Blair graciously answered several questions on Seattle recommendations and we really appreciated that. "
2039149,18707185,2014-08-31,14513534,Anne,"Perfect house for a group of 7 adults. Great location, great beds and good facilities in the house. When we arrived the house was not clean though (apparently a mistake was made in the cleaning schedule), but we were able to arrange everything with Blair, so it worked out fine. "
2039149,18873535,2014-09-02,14614992,Chris,"The house was very clean and all set up for our arrival.  The kitchen was especially nice and a great place for us to cook up some breakfast.  Blair was also very accommodating of our relatively late changes in group size and responded quickly to our emails.  Overall, a great place to stay and a great host!"
2039149,20809518,2014-10-06,12999997,Mai-Anh,"I did not actually stay in this home; I rented it for my parents.  The home was lovely, although poorly cleaned upon arrival.  Guests arrived late that evening, well after check in, and the unit smelled overwhelmingly of smoke and had visible lingering smoke in the air.  The host apologized and did his best to accommodate the asthma sufferer by offering to allow her to stay in the neighboring duplex.  The host responded promptly to various requests made by the tenants during their month-long stay.  "
2039149,20931326,2014-10-07,18802,Annie,"Blair's home is located in a quite neighborhood near University of Washington. Communication with Blair was fairly easy; home manual is detailed and easy to follow. However, we were disappointed to find the floor was not vacuumed and there were hairs found on the bedding so we were not sure if the house was cleaned fully before we arrived. There were also stains on the carpet down to the basement. We were surprised to find this top rated vacation home is not very well maintained on the day of our arrival. Overall, it was not a pleasant experience and we won't be coming back again. "
2039149,21094027,2014-10-11,463820,Al,"Thank you Blair for providing a beautiful home for us to use while we were on holidays in Seattle.  Close to everything, very clean well kept home and you were very accommodating.  We'd stay at your home again anytime as it had everything we needed... al"
2039149,21280083,2014-10-14,18356636,Jim,The home was as described and we had a good experience. The neighborhood was quiet. The location was excellent and located close to all of our functions. We would rent again if staying in the area.
2039149,21750224,2014-10-23,392363,Catherine,"Blair was easy to get in touch with. House was roomy and fit 7 people easily, neighbourhood is quiet and safe, ~15 min drive to downtown Seattle.  There is a fantastic pizza joint is just down the block.  "
2039149,22022035,2014-10-28,5579113,Ashley,"We loved our stay in Seattle. Blair was a great host, and was very easy to communicate with. We were able to check in late, which worked out perfectly for our group. The house was very spacious and the beds were comfortable. We really enjoyed Slate coffee which was only two blocks away. I would highly recommend staying at Blair's house!"
2039149,22642876,2014-11-11,495761,Suzanne,"Our daughter was getting married in Seattle and our family flew in from around the country and shared this great house. There was plenty of space for us, and we had so much fun just hanging out in the living room, playing games and laughing. The location was perfect, actually just a few blocks from our daughter's home, and close to restaurants and shops. We would definitely rent this again."
2039149,23006172,2014-11-20,21385142,Kathleen,"We were in Seattle for a week to celebrate our daughter's wedding.  Seven of us stayed comfortably in the home , six in comfy beds and one comfortably on the sofa due to an airbed issue.  The neighborhood is quiet yet only 2 blocks from a main bus line into downtown.  Blair supplied us with the things we needed in a quick & friendly fashion.  Free laundry was a bonus !  Very nice duplex home stay !  "
2039149,23357269,2014-11-30,18015550,Carolyn,The house is great and so is Blair.  There is safe parking on the street in a nice neighborhood.  The kitchen is well equipped and stocked.  Had everything we needed for our stay.  Would stay again in Blair's place.
2039149,23452853,2014-12-01,20737157,Ashley,"The house is well appointed with nice modern finishes and plenty of space.  We had 5 adults and we had more than enough room.  

We had a car so the location was just fine.  I wouldn't recommend it if you are hoping to walk everywhere (especially in the winter). There are a few walkable places but Ubering to Fremont/Ballard only cost about $10, so its a pretty central location.

We would stay here again if we needed another rental."
2039149,23889873,2014-12-14,20591455,Brian,"Everything was as presented… house worked out great for us.  Location was close to family in Wallingford neighborhood, easy to find and lots of shops and nice neighborhood in growing Ballard community.  House was clean and everything worked out great.  Thanks Blair =)"
2039149,24106758,2014-12-20,23273133,George Joshua,This a very beautiful house. Everything we needed was provided by the host. It was a reasonable price split among the 8 of us.
2039149,24187329,2014-12-22,7485161,Christine,"I rented this house for my family during our wedding weekend.  The house comfortably fit 7 adults.  The house is exactly as described and photographed.  Communication with Blair leading up to the stay was great.  If we ever need another rental in Ballard for a group, this will be our first choice!"
2039149,24461819,2014-12-29,21362089,Christopher,"Everything was as represented. It's a comfortable house in a good location. The house was clean and well-maintained. Up-to-date washer and dryer were appreciated. Parking was easy. The pizzeria at the top of the street is worth a visit, and the large pile of DVDs Blair provided had selections appropriate for everyone. "
2039149,24803726,2015-01-03,16847678,Ceilidh,"Blair was efficient, prompt and helpful. The house was great - nice linen and towels and matched the write up. It was nice and warm. The Xmas lights on all the neighbouring houses added to the feel."
2039149,25050447,2015-01-05,14685408,Michelle,A girlfriend weekend in Seattle for the theatre.  It was a perfect place and we got to explore Ballard and all the cute shops.  The house fit our needs perfectly and it was so nice and roomy.  It was welcoming and charming.  All of us loved it.  We had 8 in our group!
2039149,25312089,2015-01-12,8739036,Carl,"The home was very accurately described, and Blair has an excellent set of instructions to orient his guests.  Quiet, safe neighborhood. "
2039149,25493439,2015-01-18,22406876,Lu,Our host made us feel welcome by confirming our arrival time.  The house was located conveniently for our trip for our son's wedding.  The neighborhood was nice and the house was exactly as described on airbnb!
2039149,25664925,2015-01-22,3922173,Mary Bentley,This is a very nice 3BR home in a quiet & pretty neighborhood that is conveniently located.  The home was exactly as pictured. Everything was clean & ready for our arrival. Our stay went smoothly & I would recommend this listing to future travelers.
2039149,25770113,2015-01-25,24011821,Antonio,"Great home , exactly as described, clean, safe and comfortable. The basement area is pretty much a house by itself. "
2039149,26208952,2015-02-07,4957999,Sunshine,Everything was just as described. The place was clean and comfortable. It was a very convenient location for us near some local restaurants and coffee bars. It was great that our group could stay together in one house. 
2039149,26387632,2015-02-11,24521999,Monica,"Everything was how it was described on the listing, and pictures were spot on. The place was clean and comfortable, and was the perfect spot to stay for a large family. The neighborhood was quiet and a close distance to coffee shops, grocery stores, bars and restaurants. It was also a short distance to major attractions within Seattle."
2039149,26689012,2015-02-17,602219,Ben,"The house was great.  Two good bedrooms upstairs, along with a living room and kitchen.  Downstairs was another bedroom with bunk beds (worked well for my kids) along with another living/siting area.  Fun neighborhood (we had good weather and walked to the zoo, which is about 0.5 miles away, up a bit of a hill)."
2039149,26788179,2015-02-19,21281001,Katie,"We really enjoy the stay in Blair's house, well equipped and modern style. Located in a quite community but still convinient to stores, supermarket by car. Definitely will choose here again next time."
2039149,26979257,2015-02-23,25030182,Robert,"The house was exactly as described. Very spacious with a lower level additional bathroom, living room and bedroom with bunk beds. The neighborhood was super quiet and off street parking was easy. The outdoor space was a very nice feature and the location was perfect. We walked everywhere we went and Blair was nice enough to recommend a few breweries before our visit. I would stay here again. "
2039149,27232901,2015-02-28,3782739,Raymond,"Blair was such a great host,super easy to deal with.The house got everything I need and the location is good too.When I checked out,I forgot my laptop in the house,Blair was so patient to help me find it,I really appreciated that.One last thing,even with all the stuff done,I have not met Blair,so if you want privacy,this is the place to go."
2039149,27284880,2015-03-01,27690136,Timothy,"We had an excellent stay in this beautiful, roomy 3-bedroom house. The photos in the listing were spot on, but we were still pleasantly surprised by this charming space. It's located in a quiet, yet very accessible neighborhood. We would definitely recommend it for your next stay in Seattle."
2039149,27351076,2015-03-02,2945357,Drew,The house was perfect. Plenty of space for the seven of us. The back patio was a nice touch after dark. I would definitely stay here again. 
2039149,27610860,2015-03-08,25852053,Ted,"Place was great. Exactly as described, convenient and easy to get in and out of town. Plenty of parking right at the house. Kitchen is great as well. House was very clean and the beds were comfortable."
2039149,27647733,2015-03-09,16293864,Katie,"We enjoyed our stay in this cozy home and neighborhood. Since we had a large group and were planning for meals/sleeping arrangements, I asked Blair quite a few questions leading up to our stay. He was always very responsive and helpful. The house was clean and rooms were comfortable. Blair even made a special trip to the house to bring us a blender that was supposed to be there but wasn't. He worked hard to make things right and I would definitely recommend the house to any larger groups looking for a homey environment. "
2039149,27737949,2015-03-10,28319464,Phil,Hi Blair. Had a great experience with the house and so handy to get to the zoo and grocery shopping. Nice quiet neighbourhood. Couple of things I'd like to mention though. As discussed on the phone the blow up mattress had not been left at the house however; we made do. One thing that did frustrate us was the dishwasher was full of dishes and it had apparently been turned on but it was so jammed full that the majority of the dishes had hardened crusted food on them which required washing them in the sink before we could use them. Wherein laid another problem that there was not enough dish soap to properly clean the dishes. I would have thought that the cleaning fees we paid would have included emptying the dishwasher for the incoming guests as well as ensuring there was adequate supplies (dish soap). We noticed there was no bath/shower soap or shampoo that we usually experience when we do the home rentals. All in all though the he did meet our needs. Regards. - Phil. 
2039149,27952032,2015-03-15,28370578,Kurt,"The house was beautiful and the space was even bigger than the photos made it look. Blair had a sheet of paper with the house rules clearly written on it, along with WiFi password and location of other amenities. Very comfortable seating and bedding as well. Worth every penny!"
2039149,28081039,2015-03-17,27130232,Kellie,We enjoyed our stay at Blair's home in Seattle. The house was clean and as described. It was in a great location to explore Seattle!
2039149,28256504,2015-03-21,27268579,Gaurika,Beautiful house in a very friendly neighborhood! Bus routes and other convenience stores were very accessible. Comfortably fits a group of ten. Everything was clean and the advertising pictures were accurate.
2039149,28361130,2015-03-22,29453876,DanaLee,"The house was great!  Everything was just as described.  Quiet neighborhood, close to downtown.   Lots of room, and extra bedding.  Easy parking in front of the house. Kitchen was well equipped. House was very clean and the beds were comfortable.  Thanks for such a pleasant experience!"
2039149,28604606,2015-03-27,3086286,Ross,"My family and I rented Blair's place in March for 3 nights. We all found his place neat, with ample space (there were 6 adults and 1 child during our stay and we all comfortably fit) and in a quiet, convenient location. Blair was very responsive. This is my second time to rent from him and it's always been a pleasure to do business with him. "
2039149,28773811,2015-03-30,6533345,Stephanie,"This house is BEAUTIFUL. It was within walking distance to the store (Trader Joe's) which was very helpful. The kitchen had all of the necessities (blender, toaster, etc) and the couch in the living room was so comfortable. Blair was extremely prompt and helpful. Would stay here again if we ever find ourselves in Ballard!"
2039149,29541323,2015-04-09,17392459,Mark,A very nice house in a great location.
2039149,29820451,2015-04-13,12100816,John,"I have spent a good amount of time thinking about this before I felt that I could make a fair honest review. Let me start by saying the overall experience was very good, however there are a few things about the property that I feel need to be mentioned just to make the description of the property a bit more accurate. Let me state again that I'm not trying to sway anyone away from this home, it was very nice, huge, and quite clean.

First and most important to me the walkability: yes it is absolutely walkable, however with the exception of a few close restaurants, most everything is at min a 20 min walk, including the closest grocery store. (Which on a side note ballard town and country market is a great store) This situation is easily resolved with a service like uber that is readily available in seattle, but I guess my point is that when walkable is in the title, I would expect to be a bit closer to the action. (In my opinion at least)

Second the amenities: now this was not really a big deal, and in fact  i'm not even sure how much the amenities were really touted on this homes description, but nonetheless I feel they deserve mentioning. our situation was admittedly a bit out of the ordinary. (one member of our group caught a cold en route.) As a result she was forced to stay inside for a couple of days and us with her for the majority of the time. We found that the main tv was a bit too old to plug in a chromecast to stream content, and the wifi was too weak downstairs to use the slightly newer tv. Once again not a big deal, but a minor annoyance for a semi/premium priced home.  

Also along the same lines, in most of the airbnb homes that I have stayed, the hosts usually stock the pantry with a few basic items, tea, maybe some chips, condiments, sometimes even a beer or two. that is not the case here so if you will be staying for a while you will need to purchase everything you need. Again its not much of a problem, but it would have been nice to have some tea around for our sick friend while I went to the store to get her some meds.

lastly if you didn't notice it in the pictures, this home shares a common wall with another home. Im not sure if its a rental as well or not, but it made me very conscious of every sound we made, especially later at night. I for one hate the idea that I might be disturbing another tenant, as I usually like to stay up quite late.

I just want to close by saying that it should show you something that I have to pick the place apart just to find flaws, overall this is a huge, beautiful, clean home. Thanks."

2039149,30283362,2015-04-20,26415791,Andrew,"The house was perfect.  I was worried it would be too tight for 8 people, it was very spacious.  The unit was actually nicer than I expected, and the location was great!  Everyone was very happy with their stay and would highly recommend this option over local hotel choices. 
"
2039149,30460635,2015-04-22,11429759,Jeremy,"The house was perfect for us. It was just as described and was very spacious. It was in a beautiful, quiet neighborhood and was very convenient to what we wanted to do in Seattle. "
2039149,30759038,2015-04-27,25281468,Elise,"The house was exactly as described! Lockbox was easy to access, lots of clean towels, really comfortable beds! Really felt like we had a cozy home of our own in Seattle for the weekend, and the neighborhood was beautiful!"
2039149,31599517,2015-05-07,24811071,Maureen,"My family needed a place to live while we put our house up on the market.  The place suited my needs and is located on a quiet street.  Just to hit some of the other reviewers points:  Yes, it's a duplex with shared walls, but the walls seemed thick.  The closest grocery store is either Trader Joes or Fred Meyers (if you go to Ballard Town and Country, it will be a much longer walk).  Slate coffee house has great coffee (and pastry) just a couple blocks down from the home.  Unit is on the older side, but everything was in working order.  Blair had fast e-mail response time and was able to quickly fix a minor problem we encountered!"
2039149,31701518,2015-05-09,3811120,Donna,"Our family stayed here for 2 nights and the accommodations were just great for our group.  The house was clean and spacious, in a nice quiet neighborhood.  Blair was great to work with.  "
2039149,32037890,2015-05-12,17688056,Angela,"We were on a weekend trip in Seattle with a family of 6 and the house was perfect for that ! Everything was tidy and clean, with enough kitchen supplies to cook a homemade meal. The patio behind the kitchen was so adorable ! Defn a positive experience :) "
2039149,32459802,2015-05-18,604990,Aubrey,We had such a great time at Blair's! The house was perfect! Amazing location and the house was clean and well taken care! Blair was very easy to communicate with and everything went flawlessly! Can't wait to come to back to Seattle and stay here!
2039149,32931014,2015-05-23,653250,Laura,"This is a great house if you are traveling with family, it had plenty of space for the adults and we got a pack & play for my kid. Everything was super clean and the beds were really comfy (of so soft linen!)
It is in Ballard but not really close to the main cafes and restaurants and transit, you will need a car or do quite a bit of walking to get to places
Blair was really easy to reach out to and responded to our requests right away"
2039149,33220423,2015-05-26,23298453,Nancy,The house was very nice and clean. Very relaxing.
2039149,33611451,2015-05-30,33320434,William,"We had a really positive experience here! The host communicated well and the place was excellent - clean, spacious, and well equipped. We slept very well as the beds are comfy and the neighbourhood is quiet. 

A car is needed to explore downtown, but the local breweries, cafes and shops etc are easily walkable, and really enjoyable! 

This was a perfect base for us, from which to explore Seattle."
2039149,33684753,2015-05-31,1653916,Stephanie,We really enjoyed our stay!
2039149,34186482,2015-06-06,22780570,Amy,It was my very first Airbnb experience. Great space for the entire family with everything you would need to have a relaxing vacation. 
2039149,35193514,2015-06-16,22780570,Amy,It was wonderful and spacious. We would love to use this place again in the future. 
2039149,36223224,2015-06-26,18683841,Iris,"Blair was quick to respond to every e-mail / text.  The house is nicely decorated, clean and had everything we needed for our three-night stay.  We walked to the local pizza restaurant for dinner on our first night and on our second night, we took the bus to downtown Ballard and enjoyed dessert at Hot Cakes Molten Chocolate Cakery!  We especially enjoyed eating a few meals outdoors in the backyard because we got to appreciate the great 80 degree weather we were lucky to have while in Seattle!  "
2039149,36652231,2015-06-30,26958931,Vivian,"This was the first time using Airbnb, so I didn't know what to expect.  We were quite pleased.  The house was spacious and well maintained.  The neighbourhood was good:  walkable and safe, near shops and restaurants."
2039149,36888014,2015-07-02,11573246,Michelle,Blair was super responsive and the house suited our needs for a quick stay with 3 children on a road trip (they fought over the bunk beds downstairs!). We didn't get a chance to explore the neighborhood but it seemed nice. The house got a little hot in warm weather. 
2039149,37286695,2015-07-06,7434552,Amarinthia,"We were hosting a friend reunion here and had a nice stay! The key pick-up was easy and seamless and the outdoor patio was a really nice space for grilling and hanging out. We also enjoyed that the house was located within walking distance to a great coffee shop (4 min walk) and to the restaurants and shops of Ballard Ave (about 25 min walk). The main challenge we had, was in staying cool/circulating air in the house. We visited Seattle during an unseasonably hot week and the house gets a lot of afternoon sun beating in through those lovely windows in the front. Since there is no A/C, there were a few fans provided, but not enough for every room and the house just seemed to hold the heat (even with daily process of making sure blinds were closed, closing windows during the day, opening them during the cooler evenings etc...) Also, the windows didn't have screens on them, so there were some issues with bugs being attracted to the light from inside at night. We tried to make the most of it and realize the weather is not usually quite that hot, so its probably a non-issue most of the time. Other than that, we had a great stay! "
2039149,37544829,2015-07-08,20740112,Brian,"Neighborhood is very residential - about 15 minutes to Pike's Place, downtown etc.  Great book of local coffee, shops etc in the living room.

No a/c, so a bit hot in the current heat wave, but cooled at night.

Not fancy, but great amount of space for our family of four."
2039149,37669372,2015-07-09,2582566,Laura,This home was in a great location and was super easy to find. Everything was as described and there was plenty of space should you need it. Ballard is a super fun area to explore and this location is perfect to see all of the great neighborhoods around it as well!
2039149,38102442,2015-07-13,5724767,Ricky,"The home was excellent!  I stayed there with a party of 9 and managed to fit everyone in comfortably.
There are a ton of great breweries, bars and restaurants within walking distance (or short Uber ride).
Blair was very responsive and accommodated as needed. I could not have asked for more."
2039149,38612617,2015-07-17,8607510,Simon,"Whoa!  This place was a lot better than the pictures let on. I was just expecting a place to sleep, but the house was gorgeous, the basement was FANTASTIC!  The neighbourhood was lovely as well. And, whoa this might sound nerdy, but their kitchen sink is the sexiest sink I ever used. I could wash dishes all day in that sink.  Whoa!"
2039149,38977736,2015-07-20,26307702,Laura,"Blair was responsive and helpful.  My large family traveled from all over the US and arrived at different times, most by cab.  Since we could not check in early, Blair allowed us to secure our luggage at the home until we could check in.  He responded immediately to any questions or concerns.  We rented both sides of this duplex for 12 adults and we each felt comfortable and had plenty of room to relax and have our own space.  The beds were comfortable and clean, as was the whole unit.  (I am quite obsessive about cleanliness, so this is an amazing fact!)  The kitchen was well appointed and the linen was also clean and ample.  The whole experience was really great.  We were all very impressed."
2039149,39205391,2015-07-21,1180600,Kami,"House was clean and exactly as described. I didn't meet the owner, but it was super easy to let myself in and lock up. Thank you!"
2039149,40295289,2015-07-29,2678675,Jon,"My friends and I were on a road trip ending in Seattle. We arrived earlier than expected and had to book quickly. Blair was extremely fast and flexible with us. The apartment was clean, quiet, and spacious. We really liked the backyard patio and the netflix in the living room. "
2039149,40458725,2015-07-31,15121499,Kathryn,"The home is in a great location, a quick drive to Ballard and Fremont and perfect for families."
2039149,42104516,2015-08-11,25526153,Amelie,"When we arrived we were very disappointed, the house was very dirty, broken glass was on the floor outside and in a bedroom, hair everywhere on the floor, in the bathrooms and even on the linens. We immediately told Blair who has been very reactive, very helpful and a perfect host. Thanks to him everything was settled.

The house is nice though we could not eat all together because we were 6 adults and two kids and the table in the kitchen is for four only. If you plan to have a family dinner it isn't really possible."
2039149,42364601,2015-08-12,17534297,Nicholas,Apartment was clean and comfortable. We really enjoyed our stay and we will definitely use it on our next trip. 
2039149,42448339,2015-08-13,28771936,Anita,The house was clean and accessible and met our needs very well. 
2039149,42821867,2015-08-16,26444773,Lauren,Blair's house was the perfect accommodation for my group of 6. It was a close walking distance to the buses to take us into Ballard and downtown Seattle. We had a great time!
2039149,43056153,2015-08-17,5927516,Kendra,"Great house, great location and great host! The house is exactly as described. It was very cozy and fit our group perfectly. The big couch was great and made for a comfy and inviting living room. The outdoor patio was perfect for my girlfriends and I to sit outside, where we chatted and enjoyed a lovely Seattle summer evening. Bedrooms were clean and spacious. The house is very close to both Fremont and Ballard, and within walking distance to bars, restaurants and coffee shops. Highly recommend!"
2039149,45423000,2015-09-02,15178770,Kexiang,Perfect location and very clean house.
2039149,46260162,2015-09-09,25660761,Dawn,"upon arrival, we contacted the host via email and he responded imediately. Great experience at Walkable in Seattle. It worked perfect for us. "
2039149,47090779,2015-09-15,26222213,Lana,"Blair’s place certainly meets the expectations of location location.
The house has all you need in terms of amenities and also Blair was great at communicating with us. Although we were not there very long, we enjoyed our stay."
2039149,47392583,2015-09-18,39757244,Carolina,"Casa muy bonita y acogedora, de excelente tamaño, el host estuvo muy pendiente y contesto nuestras dudas y aclaraciones. "
2039149,47632239,2015-09-21,34554594,Victoria,Very comfortable and clean. All amenities needed were available. Very roomy and comfortable beds.
2039149,48440908,2015-09-26,4885519,Meredith,"We really enjoyed the Ballard neighborhood! The house is cute, but super simple and without any extras so be sure to bring some starter items for the fridge, water etc. it was nice to have a pack and play there too, but the wood floors are super creaky so if you have a light sleeper bring a portable sound machine. Our host was responsive to feedback and responded in a timely manner. "
2039149,48867753,2015-09-29,35333384,Mark,Overall we had a great experience. The house was exactly as advertised and Blair was extremely organized and easy to work with. I would recommend the house to anyone looking to stay in the Ballard area. 
2039149,49766187,2015-10-06,19868197,Kayla,"The host's itinerary made it very easy to figure out how to get into the house and places to visit in the neighborhood. It was a great location, walking distance to many fun restaurants, shops and more."
2039149,49994497,2015-10-08,5363084,Erin,"This was a great location. Easy walking distance to a great coffee shop and restaurant as well as the bus that takes you into downtown Ballard. We really enjoyed the space, which was comfortable and clean."
2039149,51771048,2015-10-24,38878129,Nachiket,The host helped us even though we forgot to look into directions provided to check in. The apartment is nice one and was good for four of us. 
2039149,51966529,2015-10-25,20656321,Patrick,Great space for my wife's 30th birthday surprise. Relaxing evening overall in a comfortable space! Plenty of fridge space to make ourselves comfortable and supply what we needed.
2039149,52062808,2015-10-26,11503516,Kenny,Blair was a superb host and allowed us to collect some items we had left behind in our rush to check out and go to our hotel accommodation. The house was beautiful and very well situated for easy access to downtown and other local shops. Try the giddy up burger 10mins walk away - they're awesome!
2039149,52620971,2015-10-31,10345141,Ken,Location and size of the house is great. Very quiet and situated neighbourhood. Wish could have spend more days.
2039149,53144314,2015-11-05,47455356,Steve,The house was perfect for what we needed and is as described. Blair was quick to respond to any questions and would stay in one of his properties again. The house was in a good neighbourhood and has a fantastic small coffee shop at the end of the street which did great espresso which Seattle is known for. Its a drive to Ballard area which has many top restaurants and bars.
2039149,54845725,2015-11-25,40648333,Loren,Nice quiet and safe location. Very clean. Great stay
2039149,55352280,2015-12-01,1351857,David,"The home is in a great quiet neighborhood. It was easy to check in and check out and the place was immaculate. Altogether, staying there was a great experience."
2039149,56118756,2015-12-09,46419943,William,Awesome rental.  My family and I spent 5 days here and had a great stay.  This townhouse was in a great neighborhood with excellent pizza and coffee a few blocks away.  A short drive to great places to eat as well as Ala Mode Pie shop :) Definitely recommend staying here is you are traveling with children.  
2039149,56514739,2015-12-14,23543762,Jason,It was a very smooth check in & check out process. Blair explained everything prior to my arrival and helpful. the apt is very close to downtown seattle and lots of parking around the neighborhood. The apt had everything we needed during our stay. Would recommend!
2039149,56997363,2015-12-20,51604982,Alison,Great house. Blair was extremely helpful with all questions and difficulties.
2039149,57044347,2015-12-21,49434860,Kate,"Blair contacted me before arriving that morning to tell me about check-in and to orient me to the house. The house was freshly cleaned and located in a cute neighborhood close to downtown Ballard. The beds are comfortable and the appliances are updated. Everything was a short walk or drive away. Overall, the experience was positive and it was a cozy house to stay the night."
4127196,37657345,2015-07-09,33462485,Marie,"It is a lovely home with a nice outdoor area to sit and enjoy the fresh air. There is plenty of street parking available around the home. The location is convenient to get downtown or to Shilshole or the north end. Lots of great hole-in-the-wall restaurants in the area as well as larger establishments. 

The basement area has 1 bedroom with a soft queen bed with a curtain dividing it from the living area. There is a fun air hockey table, a daybed, couch, table, 3/4 bathroom (shower, toilet, sink) and a washer and dryer. There is also a microwave and small refrigerator. 

Corbin and her family are very friendly and accommodating to their guests. They pretty much gave us keys and left us alone.  We were there at the height of an unusually hot and humid summer leaving the basement on the damp side. A de-humidifier would help the basement in general.  There are ultrasonic pest units plugged into the walls, but Seattle has a lot of bugs and being a basement space, you can expect to find spiders and pillbugs. Nothing horrifying, but just keep that in mind if you are not used to that. 

Our stay was quiet, comfortable and convenient. We would definitely stay there again if we returned to the same area. "
4127196,38728337,2015-07-18,1700305,Teresa,"Corbin (and family) made us feel very welcome and made arrival easy. Very helpful and generous with easy access to all facilities listed in the description. The place was very comfortable and certainly lived up to expectation. The outdoor decking was a fine spot for a quiet drink and a read. Location was excellent, Ballard is a great neighbourhood to explore and access to Seattle centre was straight forward.
"
4127196,41082964,2015-08-04,13492854,Robin,"Corbin made us feel very welcome! She was warm, easy going and gave us good advice about what to do in Seattle. Although Ballard is not in the center of the city, it is a great neighborhood to explore. "
4127196,44351222,2015-08-25,40870574,Kate,"This was my first AirBnB experience and all went very smoothly. Corbin was a kind and welcoming host, and very responsive in our communication. The space was comfortable, had everything we needed and was in a prime location for exploring Ballard/North Seattle."
5252515,32553658,2015-05-19,31485660,Noémie,"Gilad was a good host, he kept in contact, was quick to answer my questions, and made sure we would get into the apartment ok. He also left us good recommendations for things to see and do in Seattle. The apartment is huge, and in a good location - easy to get into the city but still has the quiet, quaint feel of the lower anne neighbourhood. "
5252515,36673038,2015-06-30,32171798,Kimberly,Gilad was a wonderful host. He was extremely responsive and accommodating.  The apartment is in an awesome location.  In addition to several stores and restaurants nearby. the Space Needle / Art Center is a short and pleasant walk away.The rooftop view is breathtaking and is a great place to decompress and enjoy a glass of wine. If the opportunity presented itself I would not think twice to stay here again.  
5252515,39921662,2015-07-27,3200793,Cory,"Great place to stay in Seattle! We were two couples in town to catch some baseball games and nightlife. We loved the location, parking, and hospitality. We'd absolutely stay again in the future and recommend to friends.

Thanks!"
5252515,43636293,2015-08-21,5958060,Sam,Gilad made us feel very welcome!  Nice place with nice appliances and bathrooms.  Right next to a bus stop taking you to downtown.  Would definitely stay here again!
5252515,43963739,2015-08-23,10891700,Bethany,Gilad did a great job communicating instructions on checking in and was very responsive prior to our trip.  He also was very accommodating in letting us leave our bags there early while the condo was being cleaned.  The rooftop deck was closed the entire time which was a bummer but we are assuming it was building maintenance.  The place was very nice and spacious. 
5252515,46153831,2015-09-08,39186964,Alex,Gilad was very accommodating. He was very responsive to any questions we had. Everything was explained very thoroughly. The space itself was in a great location and I would definitely recommend staying at his place the next time you are in the Seattle area.
5252515,47721273,2015-09-21,17073719,Kim,We had a great time! Gilad's condo was very comfy.  It was literally like staying at a friends house while they were out of town.
3291295,15368962,2014-07-07,112467,Adam,"Katie was a great host, very communicative and helpful on short notice. Would definitely stay again."
3291295,17939406,2014-08-19,16733877,Thomas,"I stayed in the apartment while Katie was out of town but nevertheless everything went smoothly, was well organized and communication with her by email went flawlessly. She responded quickly to any questions I had and also had prepared a small ""user manual"" in advance. The place itself was perfect for me, clean, comfortable, conveniently located, with all amenities I had hoped for. It is very personal (as can be seen from the photos), nicely decorated, and exactly this was what made it feel so much a home away from home. (Perhaps not ideal for a family but great for 1-2 adults.) I would have loved to stay there longer and was really sad when I had to depart. Hope to be back one day!  :-)"
3291295,18857147,2014-09-01,9170262,Samantha,"It was a nice neighborhood, great location. "
3291295,20886749,2014-10-06,8162176,Ken,"Like most AirBnB's, the apartment is clean, functional and has everything you need. However, Katie is different. She is kind, considerate and genuinely wants to make your stay great. She gave me great tips and was super helpful. I'm really grateful for her graciousness, and this place is a fantastic value at the price I paid. Great neighborhood, great place, great host. Thanks for the awesome experience, Katie!"
3291295,22627201,2014-11-10,23230253,Simone,"Katie's place was the Perfect location!! We were in town for a UW football game and we were an easy walk to the stadium (without the hassle of parking!) The U District has great restaurants and bars and shops. So much to do very close by. 

I had been a bit nervous about finding free parking but it was no problem. 

It's a 30 min walk to Fremont and easy to access by bus from downtown as well. 

I would definitely highly recommend Katie's place. 

Plus she facilitated key hand off seamlessly despite not being around. The whole thing was super easy and we had a great time"
3291295,24151435,2014-12-21,15696265,Tom,"Fantastic!  Exactly as described.  Really nice place, we showed up 2 hours earlier than expected and Katie was very accommodating."
3291295,24585674,2014-12-31,21788528,John,"Katie was very welcoming, took the trouble to get bagel and cream cheese for us and waited for our late arrival.  The apartment is neat and clean and pleasant for our stay.  Location is very convenient to shopping and restaurants, parking is within a block or two.  Construction next door is noisy.  All and all a nice stay for us."
3291295,26654228,2015-02-16,17736983,Alex,Kaite was terrific. Everything was easy to set up. Easy to get the key. Easy to find. We weren't there long and kept to ourselves but the location is lovely and just what we were looking for. Thanks Katie for letting us make ourselves at home!
3291295,28426136,2015-03-23,27499425,Nisha,"I absolutely loved my first airbnb experience at Katie's place. Not only is her apartment in a great location - easy access to freeways and walking distance to grocery stores, cafes and the University. Aside from the functionality of the place, Katie was a great host. Was very open to there being construction noise next door - which didn't phase us at all. She tried to accommodate me very well even while she was out of town. Great host and great open space. "
3291295,30324195,2015-04-20,28405183,Christina,"I stayed at Katie's place for three nights with my daughter as we visited UW.  It was a perfect location for our purposes, just a few blocks away from UW in a nice neighborhood.  The apartment is accurately described by Katie - it is quite comfortable and clean.  The internet speed was pretty slow, but that didn't impact our stay.  Katie is an outstanding host - very easy to communicate with, and very accommodating and responsive.  She was out of town, but arranged for me to pick up and drop of the keys and everything worked out without a hitch."
3291295,34841307,2015-06-12,7706475,Patty,The host canceled this reservation 51 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
682135,8412986,2013-10-29,8695560,Jon,"Suryo is a gracious host with a nice apartment in Eastalke. The view from the balcony of Lake Union is beautiful. In minutes you can walk to restaurants and a small market, very convenient. Also her cat Mysuki is sweet and friendly and loves to play and be pet! My wife and I had a very relaxing stay, and will book with Suryo next time we visit!"
682135,12640940,2014-05-06,6690567,Shirley,"This was a great weekend stay in Seattle! Suryo was very kind; we were greeted with a fresh vase of tulips, a very clean and cosy apartment, and she even provided a great personalised breakfast spread! 
The apartment was easy to reach from the Link Light Rail from the airport by buses 70 or 66 (and 71, 72, 73 on weekends) and served by some other buses as well. From here we were able to walk to Wallingford, the U-District, and had easy access to the Burke-Gilman trail. 

Thanks very much, Suryo!"

682135,28435521,2015-03-23,10194729,Chris,"I booked Suryo's apartment for a long weekend visit with my daughter who lives two blocks away. It's suitable for a single or couple but no more than that, and there is a 1.5 storey climb from the street. She was gone so I was able to park my rental car in her space, which was great since parking is VERY hard to find in Seattle. The place was in a lovely tree-filled neighborhood; it was clean, quiet, and had every convenience I needed, including a balcony and a comfortable bed; I slept very well. It was also close to several restaurants, clubs, and Lake Union--fun to watch the float planes landing and taking off! Suryo provided me with some food, toiletries, and made sure I had my oh-so-important coffee and half and half. She was so nice that I wished she had been around to hang out with. Her cat was very sweet but not a pest, which I appreciated. All in all a great experience and I'll try to stay there again when I visit. Thanks Suryo!"
682135,34367472,2015-06-07,34664749,Rachel,Perfect accommodations for a quick trip to Seattle. Suryo made sure to make us feel welcome and the check in/check out process was very easy.  This was important since we were arriving at an off time. Highly recommended!
682135,43861756,2015-08-22,41331396,Ryan,"Suryo did a great job of making both me and my mother feel welcome in her apartment.  She left us fruit, eggs, and coffee which we really appreciated.  I would recommend her place to any of my friends or family that want to stay in a central safe location in Seattle."
682135,48616689,2015-09-27,2155947,Jessica,"loved it - place was exactly as described - simple, clean, comfortable, and in a nice location.  It was perfect for a two night stay."

The neighbourhood was cute and full of great places to eat and, of course, drink coffee.

We'd definitely stay with her again and would highly recommend her home to anyone on air b and b. "
611509,2165536,2012-09-01,3324374,David,"Joanna Hosted my mother during while she was visiting Seattle. Joanna has been a joy to do business with. I will recommend her to anyone looking for a wonderful place to stay in Seattle. He home is beautiful, in a great location, and immaculately clean. My mother says she felt very comfortable staying with Joanna, and is already talking about staying with her during her next visit. Thanks for being a great hostess Joanna! "
611509,2209131,2012-09-05,2697388,Josephine,I had a great time staying at Joanna's! She was very nice and the bed sheets were the most comfortable I have ever slept in in my life!! Many points for that! The house is clean and nice and close to a bus that brings downtown Seattle easily. I would definitely recommend staying there.
611509,2380197,2012-09-23,2945930,Shigeo,"This place is very convenient because it is so close to a grocery store and  many restaurants in Wallingford. Bus stop for route 44 and 16 are very close. There is another person living in the basement. I had some noise issues from the basement room (not because of the person but because of the structure of the house). If you do not stay at the house so long, that would not bother you much. But if you want to spend long in the house for study or something or if you are sensitive to bass beat sounds as I was so, you may want to be careful. However in general, I feel that I should not have expected a quiet place to study from AirBnB."
611509,2852730,2012-11-10,1995027,Maia Merav,"Joanna was great! She made me feel at home immediately, and went out of her way to be helpful with excellent suggestions (ask about the car service from the airport!). 

Her home is exactly as advertised (though simpler and nicer than it appears in the photos), and clean and comfortable and well located. I definitely recommend staying here when you're in Seattle. "
611509,3677151,2013-03-03,3899615,Floortje,"During my stay Joanna has been an amazing host. She is a very welcoming and caring person. Also, she really gave me the insiders view of the town by showing me some well hidden gems in the city.
The house is located in a nice neighborhood, near Green Lake, which makes an excellent spot for outdoor activities. (Grocery)shops and bus stops with direct connections to downtown are just a convenient 5 minute walk. 
The house is really beautiful; it has character, and you can see that Joanna has an eye for interior design. I really liked my bedroom and private bath: clean and nicely decorated.
Overall: I've had a wonderful stay at Joanna's. I felt welcome and at home. I would definitely recommend her place, both for short and longer stays."
611509,3920076,2013-03-27,4715997,Lior,"Joanna was lovely, the house is beautiful, and it is a warm place, in a great area, Wallingford, cool rest's, shops, cinema in 5 mins walk. pepi was very cute, and Joanna helped me with everything.

"
611509,4066096,2013-04-07,702834,Renee,"We had a great time staying at Joanna's house in Wallingford. Joanna was very helpful and accommodating, and Pepinot was very sweet. The location was an easy walk from many restaurants and bus stops and also within a reasonable walking distance of UW, where we were headed. We also found ourselves spending a good amount of time with her Netflix TV connection while retreating from the rain, so if you are looking for a place to relax rather than explore, this location is also for you. No matter the reason for your visit to Seattle, if you are in the area, I highly recommend that you stay with Joanna in her lovely home!"
611509,4877258,2013-05-30,6037527,Chris,"Joanna and Pepinot were gracious hosts.  The location is awesome, the home is inviting, and for the three weeks I was there I felt comfortable and very welcome.  Joanna is knowledgeable of the area restaurants and places to visit, never intrusive and always helpful.  I really couldn't have asked for a better host or place to stay during my visit to the area.  I enjoyed sitting on the front porch, or inside on the recliner to read.  There was a small desk I used for my laptop to get work done.  Having the full use of a kitchen was very helpful as well.  It really was like a home away from home and I can't say enough good things about the hosts!  Thanks Joanna!"
611509,5021980,2013-06-08,5357501,Joseph,"My girlfriend Frances and I stayed for 1 week.  Joanna was a great host, and Pepinot was very sweet too!  The house was more beautiful in person than in the photos here and so comfortable, with plenty of room for eating, cooking or working.  We did not experience noise problems, though the floorboards were creaky.  The closet was a bit small, but there was a big chest of drawers available.  Proximity to Tangletown and Wallingford stores, easy street parking around the corner, and the hot tub were plusses!"
611509,5161630,2013-06-16,6124322,Wai Ling,"Our first AirBnb experience was with Joanna and Pepinot in Seattle. The room we rented was lovely including own private bath room with soft towels and toiletries. She offered us coffee & tea, some fresh fruit and eggs. Everything was spotless and Joanna gave us good tips for Seattle. Joanna treated us on amazing homemade peanut butter cookies (I'd love the recipe) our second evening in. We enjoyed her Netflix while recovering from our jet lag. We also noticed she also had some board games in the living room, also ones we packed with us :) Conclusion: clean house & room, good location, free parking, lovely host. We can recommend this room to anyone who is planning to visit Seattle."
611509,5223540,2013-06-18,2773399,Jay,Joanna was an excellent host. Her place was cosy and very comfortable. A definite choice when staying in Seattle.

611509,7213208,2013-09-10,8612859,Cathy,"Joanna is a wonderfully bright and aware host. She has good information, and her home is lovely and functional. It was a respite for me, and I appreciated the relaxed atmosphere and private bath next to the bedroom. There's a lovely back patio too! Pepi is a really good cat, SO sweet. Thank you, Joanna!"
611509,7411915,2013-09-19,7158568,Abigail,"Joanna is a gracious host who made me feel welcome in her home.

Great neighborhood location within walking distance of a grocery store and coffee shops. Highly recommended!"
611509,8461466,2013-11-01,8569113,Mary,"Staying in Joanna's home was heaven!  I relocated to WA and was a guest for almost a month while I started work and figured out where I was going to live. Joanna could not have been more gracious and friendly. Her home is beautiful, comfortable and in a great location. Pepi the kitty is wonderful too!  I loved staying there and would highly recommend it to anyone looking for terrific accommodations in the Seattle area. "
611509,8998956,2013-12-01,9570455,Susan,"Joanna's house is a charming Craftsman. The bedroom and bathroom was spacious and well appointed. The location was handy - just a short walk to shops and groceries - and a bus that took me to the University and a shopping mall. Joanna was gracious and friendly and her cat, Pepi, was sweet. I can highly recommend her as a host. I love Seattle!"
611509,12160193,2014-04-24,13813562,John,"Private bath with good hot and cold water pressure and a good shower head.  Private bedroom with adequate space for hanging clothes in closet and lots of drawers in a chest plus bedside stand.  Some street noise but didn't bother me at all.  Owner allowed shared access to all rooms downstairs which included kitchen, dining area, living room, another sitting area and a tv (website hidden) uses Rokur which includes Netflix.  If have sunny weather there is a very nice large deck in the backyard.  Guests with limited mobility, there are ten steps or so up from the sidewalk without a handrail to the front door.  Very pleasant and considerate host.  Location is within walking distance of the Wallingford shopping area on 45th st. which has a grocery, drug store, coffee houses and selection of ethnic restaurants.  The cat is friendly but not pushy.  I would definitely stay here again."
611509,15444045,2014-07-09,12225275,Aaron,"Joanna's home was perfect for my stay; comfortable, tidy, close to good shops, restaurants, and a grocery store, as well as a lovely backyard.  Joanna herself was thoughtful, kind, and very accommodating; she was always willing to give valuable insight into where to go and what to do.  Pepi (her cat) was also a very welcoming host!  I had a lovely stay and would highly recommend her as a host.  "
611509,15644438,2014-07-13,10576426,Sarelle,"What a wonderful place to stay, thanks to a top notch host! Joanna (and pepi) were very welcoming, from the moment we booked our stay she was super accommodating.  Joanna went out of her way to make sure we were comfortable with the accommodations, safe in the neighborhood, and made sure we had a fabulous time.  She is a great communicator and made us feel instantly welcome. 
The neighborhood is quaint and very close to all parts of the city, walking distance to good late night spots. 
We will definitely stay here again next time we visit Seattle, all aspects of our stay were pleasant and I would highly recommend staying there.  The place is also expertly decorated and gives you the feel of your own private residence with the comfort of knowing that your knowledgeable host is just upstairs. 
Thanks again!"
611509,16088914,2014-07-22,16064630,Kate,"Joanna was a terrific host. Very warm and welcoming. The house was gorgeous and had ample space. Even though I did not take advantage of it, the house offered many places for dining, gatherings, and places to hang out. The back yard was gorgeous and well maintained. 

I loved the room I stayed in. The bed was awesome and I know I will be coming back. 

I felt welcome, I felt like I was given permission to live in the house for the two nights I was staying and the location was perfect walking distance to Green Lake and all of the districts I wanted to adventure to.

It was an easy shoot to downtown as well. "

Joanna is so nice and friendly,  and she went to extraordinary lengths to make our stay there a real delight, just feel right at home. There is most comfortable bed! Exceptionally clean and cozy. My first Airbnb experience couldn't have been more enjoyable. 5 star service and hospitality! I would highly recommend staying here. "
611509,16839396,2014-08-03,13425871,Lauren,"The house is good because of its value - cheaper than other places in Seattle. If you are visiting downtown, it is a bit far and we had to take cab/uber to get there (25 min, no traffic with highway) so that adds up. The house is kept tidy but it is a bit older in condition. The room has two doors (one opens up to the living room and other opens up near the kitchen) and the bathroom is located near the kitchen. The hostess was flexible with our check out. Overall, we had an average experience staying there. "
611509,17579670,2014-08-14,18609984,Margaret (Poppy),We enjoyed our stay and found the lodging convenient to locations in Wallingford and Fremont that we wanted to visit.  Joanna was very welcoming and helpful and the lodging was clean and comfortable.

I would certainly choose to return when we next have reason to be in Seattle.  I am not given to hyperbole when people perform what they promise.  That's what we do."
611509,18723904,2014-08-31,17798977,Fran,"I really enjoyed living in Joanna's house. The house has a long history and is well-decorated. The room was clean and very comfortable . The location is wonderful, close to the supermarket , bus stop, restaurant, the green lake and university of Washington. Joanna is such a nice person that she helped me a lot. Having Peppi be company was also delightful, she's so cute! Everything was perfect and many thanks to Joanna."

Joanna was a wonderful host and I would definitely stay with her again!"
611509,19487552,2014-09-13,4138425,Richard,"Joanna's home is fantastic, warm and welcoming - just like the host.  The bedroom is spacious with a very comfortable bed and private bath.  I was there for a week and mainly working - out early in the morning and home in the evening.  The home and neighborhood are quiet - but a short walk to shops and restaurants and convenient bus service downtown.  I recommend Joanna and her home highly."

The neighborhood (Wallingford) is a sweet area that's residential but still has a lot of good restaurants and shops in walking distance. I went for late night strolls and felt totally safe. Transportation-wise it's pretty easy to get to downtown or other nearby cool neighborhoods. 

Highly recommended!

611509,24323222,2014-12-26,7140175,New,"My husband and I love staying at Joannas' place.  The location is perfect for us and within walking distance to everywhere we need to go in Seattle.  Of course, the bus service is excellent and we can get around easily and out to the airport if needed.  The neighborhood is terrific and if you like old houses you'll love it there.  Joanna's house is warm and inviting and we had everything we needed.  Joanna is sweet and quite helpful.  We will be back again!"

611509,29291118,2015-04-06,25420224,Ian,"I have enjoyed my time staying in Joanna's home.  She has shown herself to be a thoughtful and considerate hostess, taking care 
to assure that my sojourn in her home was as pleasant and 
comfortable as possible. The guest room in which I stayed is spacious and well furnished and, in addition to allowing her guests the free use of her kitchen and laundry facilities, she 
provides for them a bathroom dedicated for their sole use. She even extends to her guest an invitation to join the occasional dinner party she hosts.

Her home is situated in a pleasant and verdant residential neighborhood but only a block or so away from a small commercial center and its attendant amenities (grocery store, coffee shop, ice cream parlor, library, movie theater, etc.). It is also within easy walking distance of a campus-like enclave with 
a small park and a children's playground.  There is also a bus-line
nearby  that will take you directly  into downtown Seattle. 

If you should ever need a considerate hostess and a comfortable pied-a-terre for a sojourn in the Seattle area I  commend  to you the choice of a stay with Joanna. "
611509,31878784,2015-05-11,27182148,Sheng,房东是一个很友好的人 她提供给了我充分的自由空间 房间很干净整洁 而且很安静 这对我来说是最重要的一点 由于我体质的原因特别怕冷 房东有提供备用的毯子 非常体贴！独立卫生间内设施也很齐全 甚至包括一些洗漱沐浴用品。她也给了我很多好的旅行建议 本来打算出发前做好攻略的 但因为时间仓促没有来得及 不知道去哪的时候房东告诉了我很多有意思的地方 这让我觉得很幸运。房源的地理位置很好 downtown在步行范围内 有一家手工冰淇淋店在那 感觉很棒 猫咪也特别可爱。

Her house is clean and comfortable, with a very soft bed. The location is very close to a gorgeous lake with a running path and a cute street of shops, restaurants, and a movie theater.

611509,36181037,2015-06-26,8189585,Lori,"My daughter and I stayed with Joanna while visiting Seattle for my daughter's UW freshman orientation. This was our first Airbnb experience and it was very position. Joanna made us feel welcome from the start. Her space was just as advertised, and was comfortable and clean. She provided information about travel alternatives to/from the airport, key code for entry, and so on. She was also happy to give suggestions for meals, sightseeing, bus routes, the local farmers market, etc.  Her location is very convenient to Wallingford's restaurants and shops, and Seattle Metro routes for the UW and downtown Seattle. We will definitely consider staying with Joanna again on future visits, availability permitting. "

611509,36978490,2015-07-03,9377208,Arianna,Joanna was friendly and easy to communicate with. This room is in a great neighborhood and offered lots of privacy. The AC was a plus in the 90 degree heat :)
611509,38589299,2015-07-17,30503466,Claire,"I stayed with Joanna for 12 days for a business trip to UW. Joanna is incredibly welcoming, and is a great resource for recommendations on where to eat, shop and exercise. The house looks just like the photos and is lovely, comfortable, and clean. The location is in a quiet neighborhood, and it was only a short bus ride to UW's campus. This was my first Airbnb experience, and it has set a very high standard!"
611509,39196619,2015-07-21,35173994,Jorge Renato,"We were very lucky staying at Joana’s house while visiting Seattle! It is a quite central place to the places people visit in Seattle: there are are several bus stops nearby, and one can quickly and easily reach any place. 
The neighborhood is charming, besides having a lively commercial activity going on (supermarket, drugstores, banks, restaurants).
Also, Joana was very helpful in giving advise about places to go, what to do, transportation options and so on! Since she knew a little bit about us, she gave us advise on neighborhoods we might like, as a “personal trip advisor”! 
The breakfast provided was great: with fruits, jams, breads, freshly roasted coffee and the like!
As a plus, for those who like cats, she has a beautiful cat, Pepi, that is very “polite” and didn’t even step into our bedroom (for those that don’t like cats, she isn’t a problem at all !). 
Joana had great city guides, maps and walking tours from Seattle, that helped us a lot!
Anyone who would stay there would find everything needed for a relaxing and comfortable stay.
We would definitely stay there again!!

Though there is no parking directly in front of Joanna's house, there was ample parking around the corner.  The neighborhood was great - so close to Wallingford shops and Greenlake.  "

611509,42849486,2015-08-16,2823684,Courtney,Joanna made us feel very welcome in her cozy and clean house! Our bedroom had a very comfy bed and a nice window for a breeze at night. The bathroom was super clean as well as the rest of the house. We felt very at home and comfortable staying at Joanna's place. We liked the neighbourhood (Wallingford) a lot because it was low key and had a nice community feel. We had (email hidden) and ate ice-cream at either the Fainting Goat or Molly Moon's every.single.night. It was glorious! We found it pretty easy to get to other parts of the city from Joanna's place and would for sure stay here again!

It met our expectations and we felt quite comfortable."
611509,45065672,2015-08-31,3165770,Mark,"All these questions from airbnb yikes. It is very simple. The reality was I am on the opposite coast looking for a place to stay in Seattle. I tried a few places that fit my needs and budget. And a place that was comfortable and had some style. Two place I selected were booked or slow to respond. Joanna responded quickly and it was done. (That is important to note responsiveness.)

Here is where I got crazy with questions about the location, the bus, the cabs, etc. Like I've never left my house. The host responded and was generous with her help and kind. Being a widower for a few years this was my first major trip. She gave me the confidence in going but knowing I was welcomed not only as a transaction but a person.

The place was lovely, clean, neat, and well cared for. I met the host and was immediately made to feel welcomed. I couldn't have done better. Nor felt better about my selection. "
611509,45997493,2015-09-07,41012405,Jan,"Joanna has provided many amenities to make the visitor feel welcome, including tourist information, books and maps, as well as conveniences such as a hairdryer. She is a friendly and welcoming host who seems to genuinely enjoy hosting visitors. The house is indeed charming and the neighbourhood has its own character, with lots of interesting shops and restaurants nearby. "
611509,46769564,2015-09-13,20581320,Kasturi,"Joanna's place was very cosy and comfortable, exactly as described and a nice quiet neighborhood with a short commute/uber to most places. Joanna was a great host and made us feel welcome. "
611509,47179024,2015-09-16,41640156,William,"In vergelijking met een hotel is dit wennen; minder luxe, minder privacy. Je bent een tijdelijke medebewoner van iemand's privé woning. Joanna's huis is bijna helemaal van hout, zoals zoveel Amerikaanse huizen, en die zijn bepaald niet geluidsarm. Maar na 3 nachten hoor je het piepen, kraken en andere geluiden veroorzaakt door jezelf en de medebewoners eigenlijk niet meer. 
Joanna is gastvrij maar houdt voldoende 'afstand' tot de gast, wat ik op prijs stel. Ik ben er alleen voor een goed bed en een goede douche, en die zijn er.
Verder is er een goede wifi.
Van de tv heb ik geen gebruik gemaakt.
Ook de keukenvoorzieningen heb ik niet gebruikt; er is een QFC op 10 minuten lopen afstand. Daar eet je voor weinig.
De hygiëne is oké.
Parkeergelegenheid is er alleen aan de straat.
Het huis is gelegen aan een overdag drukke weg."
611509,47927859,2015-09-21,30670491,Andrew,"Very friendly, responsive and easy to work with.  Very clean and comfortable room.  Joanna is friendly and nice to chat with as well"
611509,50067994,2015-10-09,37954031,Adrian,"This was my first airbnb experience, and I was super impressed.  I stayed with Joanna for three weeks while I took a class at the UW Tower.  I walked the 1.3 miles most days but the bus stop was only ~5 blocks away.  There were no surprises with Joanna's house or neighborhood.  There was ample street parking around the block and the house was lovely and very homey.  Pepi was an added bonus! They were great hosts and are highly recommended!"
611509,50716130,2015-10-13,30291600,Daniel,"Joanna made me feel very welcome and is a very good communicator.  I had a wonderful stay at Joanna's charming house.  The bedroom and bathroom were spotless and well appointed.  The bed was particularly comfortable.  Pepi the cat was always welcoming, and to top it off, the location so close to Wallingford center, as well as Green Lake, Fremont, and the University District is ideal.  I definitely recommend staying at Joanna's place as I will on future visits.
"
611509,51171930,2015-10-18,5509208,Catherine,"Joanna was not able to be home when we arrived, but she gave us careful instructions on how to let ourselves in. She arrived shortly thereafter and chatted with us then and several other times, giving us ideas for restaurants nearby. We tried a number of them during our stay and found all of the recommendations were were well warranted. She was very friendly but gave us our privacy also. The accommodations were as pictured and described. We were a bit surprised at how busy her street is, but it was not really a problem and we were always able to find parking just around the corner.  Coffee-making supplies, fruit and snacks, a very comfy bed and the company of her kitty, Pepi gave us all the comforts of home."
611509,52490963,2015-10-30,43591849,Deborah,"The house was comfortable, close to transportation and the reason for our visit, our daughter. We felt at home during our stay. We would love to come back in the summer and experience the beautiful patio."
493591,1518208,2012-06-19,2518092,Rob & Allison,"Flor makes everyone feel like family. She is a perfect host. She is married to the famous Nacho Libre who was also so welcoming when we arrived, helping us to get our bags upstairs as well as loaded into the car when we left. 
 
Flor is a great cook, preparing an awesome breakfast in the morning and making us feel like royalty. Flor even drove us to the airport when we left. All we can say is Flor is the best and her home is conveniently located to get around Seattle without any problems. "
493591,1582786,2012-06-28,2598939,Diego,"I had a great experience staying at Flor's place.  Flor may be newer to airbnb but she is a pro when it comes to hospitslity.  As a nurse with many years of experience, it is no surprise that Flor knows how to take care of guests.  Flor made me feel right at home from day one, and the hot daily breakfast was better than at any other BNB that I've ever stayed at (eggs,  bacon, waffles, quiche, steak, several types of breads).  But beyond that, Flor went out of her way to help me learn about the city ( she even drove me around one eveming), she connected me to local real estate experts, and she invited me to be part of the family.  By the end of my stay I felt that Flor and Nacho are going to be some of my good friends in the Seattle area.  I even had the pleasure of being invited to a family get together for two of Flor's sons.  If you want a place that is going to make you feel at home and where you will be surrounded by friendly and helpful people, then I highly recommend this place!"
493591,1746968,2012-07-19,2033319,Robert,It was a real joy staying with Flor and Nacho.  We felt like family from the first moment.  The accommodations are extremely clean and the beds comfortable.   But the real fifth star is earned by the incredible breakfast.  We enjoyed the Peruvian recipes served up generously.  The location is convenient with nearby stores and bus service.   Quiet at night.    Flor is the perfect hostess and we will always try to book with her in the future.
493591,1815385,2012-07-27,2972001,Karen,"Flor and Nacho are fabulous hosts! Their home is charming, welcoming, and immaculate! We enjoyed ourselves so much. Be sure to ask Flor for one of her Peruvian breakfast creations!"
493591,1852508,2012-07-31,2906931,Meagan,"I had the pleasure of meeting Flor with my mother during my first visit to Seattle. In this brand new city I had the daunting task of finding an apartment in 4 days. From the moment Flor came out to help us carry our luggage up into our rooms, she made us feel as we had arrived at home with such a warm welcome. We had the choice to stay in many of her immaculate rooms which were well equipped with anything you might need on a short or even extended stay. Her location is right in the center of it all and is only 15 minuties to downtown Seattle. She is so close to parks and trails for running/hiking/biking, and walking distance to all sorts of grocery/merchandise stores. Her years of experience as a nurse really shines through as she has taken the time and thought to make sure you have everything you need for such an enjoyable visit. Our room had a spacious closet, orthopedic mattresses, desk, refrigerator, microwave, and even utensils to prepare our own dinner.  She supplied each of us with our own beautiful towel set, and the bathrooms were well stocked with luxurious shampoos and beauty products, so I wasn't in despair when I had realized I left a few things at home. The mornings were my favorite part of the stay, as we would wake up to the fragrant aroma of Flor's Peruvian cuisine coming from the kitchen. She had such an amazing selection every morning that started with hot peruvian coffee and fresh tropical fruit juices. My favorite was the hot peruvian omelets loaded with peppers, onions, mushrooms, spinach, avocados, and cheese served with the tasty mountain potatoes garnished with peruvian spices. Her home caters to every type of person/group. Whether you want a guide to the Seattle area, or if you just want your own private space to stay Flor truly allows you to decide what you like. She has grown to be one of my first and most genuine friends in this city. Two weeks after my first stay, I was in quite a difficult situation because I was unable to move into my apartment and started work in a few days. Without a place to stay or even a car to use, Flor immediately took me back into her beautiful home. She helped drive me around and took me shopping at Northgate mall (7min) and made sure that I was beyond prepared to start my new job with Boeing. In the meantime she allowed me to attend a party she was hosting where I was able to enjoy even more of the Peruvian cuisine and have a spectacular evening meeting her family. She truly is a genuine and amazing woman and has become like a mother to me. Whether laughing and learning to salsa dance together or even sharing memories from back home over dinner, there is such a heartfelt experience involved with staying at Flor's Place ""The 5-Star House."""
493591,1905511,2012-08-06,3016971,Andy,Flor was a great hostess and cooked us delicious Peruvian breakfasts every day. Make sure to appreciate the murals through the house.
493591,1984658,2012-08-14,2946155,Miok,"It was wonderful to stay with Flor! When we came back from a day of sight-seeing, it felt like we were coming home. The Peruvian breakfasts were amazing- not just the food (which was great), but the company. We are very glad we got to meet and stay with Flor during our trip to Seattle."
493591,2177398,2012-09-03,2716025,Sarah,"Flor is one of those natural hostesses that can have a conversation with anyone; whether you are quiet or outgoing, she'll tell you stories about her family and make you feel at ease staying in her home. We stayed for 4 nights while visiting family and the location was incredibly convenient. Of course, it was great to have her breakfasts each morning and you really have to try her Peruvian cooking. We would fill up at breakfast and then be full until dinner time. This is an incredible cost-saver for anyone on a budget and will make you feel like a real short term resident of Seattle. The location is also great as it is close to downtown by car or bus but far enough away to feel like you are not just a tourist. It is a few blocks away from Carkeek park which is like your own little rain forest and backs up to the sound with lots of trails and a view of the Olympics. There is also a nice grocery store just up the street that is open 24 hours. The bed we slept on was clean and comfortable on our backs and though there was a full house, we weren't able to hear anyone in the house when our door was closed. We would definitely book Flor's Place again."
493591,2258118,2012-09-10,1977262,Alexey,"Flor made our first airbnb experience even nicer than what we expected! We both felt welcomed from the very first moment we stepped into her house (she made fresh cookies!), she promptly gave us a tour, letting us choose the bedroom we preferred among the ones that were available. Our room had a massive bed, a fridge, TV, and even a microwave! She gave us a driving tour of the neighborhood and helped us get an idea of our surroundings. We were very impressed with the first few hours with Flor and knew right away that it was an excellent choice to go with her! 

Flor clearly is a seasoned traveler and knows what would make your stay comfortable: You can tell by the little details such as the fact that she had change ready for the bus when we arrived with only Canadian dollars! The bathroom had every amenity one could wish for (I myself tried out some body lotions I would never have the courage to try otherwise!)! 

Flor has lots of great stories and really exudes the traveler spirit. We immediately felt comfortable around her and it was as if she was a long lost relative from Peru! Breakfast was very filling and it was fun to try Peruvian food. The bed we slept on was EXTREMELY comfortable! We both had some of the best sleeps in a long time! 

Our only regret is not being able to say bye properly as we left. We both wish Flor had a twin or a triplet as we would travel to another place in the states knowing we would have the same experience!

Thanks Flor!

Alexey & Flavia

PS: do you have a twin or triplet?"
493591,2397081,2012-09-24,3485134,Hollie,"Flor was such an incredibly warm and inviting hostess! Upon our arrival there were refreshments and fresh fruit waiting for us after our journey. After we relaxed and became acquainted with one another, Flor gave us a tour of her home and allowed us to choose our rooms. Each of the rooms is furnished with a personal refrigerator, microwave, and dishes, which comes in very handy! We loved waking up to the smell of Flor's Peruvian cooking in the kitchen, and her amazing breakfast smoothies. We ate like Queens while we stayed here, and were treated like ones too! Meeting Flor is like meeting a long-lost Auntie that you never knew you had. She is such a kind, and down to earth woman. She even helped me launder a difficult costume for work that the dry cleaner was afraid to touch! I would stay with Flor again and again, and you should stay with her too! While you are there make sure to try her homemade Peruvian ceviche! It is amazing!!"
493591,2476830,2012-10-01,382980,Kirana,Flor is so very sweet and accommodating! I didn't have a car and she picked me up at the station and drove me to and from the conference which made my stay really easy! She gave me extra pillows and the morning fruit was fresh!  Never had a problem with the shared bath. So glad I did not stay at a hotel!

   kiwi, 
     bananas,
        pineapples, 
          exotic dishes, 
             exotic drinks, 
Flor goes over and beyond the call of duty to insure a complete air b and b experience. I had very little information on the city of Seattle and had hardly a clue as to what to expect in Seattle...but thanks to Flor, i was soundly introduced to this magnificient city.

                   upon arrival to Flor's paladial estate you walk into a tastefully carpeted exottic home, with very nice art work. I loved the bed.she assigned me to.. you know....those professional mattresses that I very seldon get to sleep on.  There are large tv's every where down stairs, upstairs.
with refiidgerators in every room.

           Flor served a continuous flow of exotic dishes, upon completion she would wisk you away to some exotic Seattle tourist spot.  Space Needle, Farmers Market, Jimi Hendrix memorial, Bruce Lee Memorial, Puget Sound, Seattle is just beautiful.
    Thank you so much Flor, you were excellent, thanks for spoiling me.
                  Wayne

493591,2759132,2012-10-30,1125826,Vincent,"We traveled there from Florida to visit our grandchild, and Flor's Place was only a few blocks away. It was very clean and well kept. Pat and I were treated very well by a great hostess and her husband. who were very friendly and informative, - she prepared a great breakfast for us every morning at the times we requested.

We highly recommend Flor's Place if you are in the Seattle area."
493591,2953239,2012-11-24,2704334,Vanessa,"Flor  is one of a kind.  This unique and big hearted lady makes you feel at home as soon as you arrive.  Flor shows a truly genuine interest in her guests and their lives.  You can be sure that she will take very good care of you while you are under her roof.  It is not easy to find someone so caring and giving -- Flor puts love in everything she does and it makes all the difference.  Her breakfasts were some of the best we’ve ever had.  Her husband is equally kind, warm and welcoming.  We left feeling a lot of affection for this lovely lady and her family."
493591,3208155,2013-01-01,4144100,Hanna,"I stayed at Flor's place for the month of Decemberm 2012. I needed a place to stay when I relocated to Washington. I contacted Flor through airbnb. She was very responsive and helpful. She greeted me when I arrive at the house. The room was very clean. It had everything that I needed (desk, chairs, clean dishes, silverware, frig, microwave,tv...etc). Everything was in great shape and as described in the listing and pictures. My stay was very comfortable. I used the kitchen sometimes and Flor welcomed me to use any of the common places at the house. Everyone there was very friendly. All in all it was a good stay and I recommend it to everyone."
493591,4779798,2013-05-25,5954837,Jing,Flor is very nice. We feel welcome just like home. Road side parking is very easy to find. Food and grocery are within walking distance. Good place to stay for your Seattle trip.

The room was well equipped with a very comfortable bed, refrigerator, dishes, hangers, and plenty of room for all of our things. The shared bathroom was very clean and tidy. I highly recommend Flor's place!"
493591,5616736,2013-07-08,6741041,John,Flor was a most gracious host. She made me feel right at home. Flor even asked me to a family birthday cookout on my first night in Seattle. Her family was as welcoming as she was. Accomodations were very nice and quiet. Flor thought of everything. There was also plenty of brochures on what to do in the Seattle area.I look forward to staying with Flor on my next trip to Seattle.

493591,5764620,2013-07-15,2317665,Deborah,Flor was a great host. She picked us up at airport. Bedroom was ready when we arrived. Front door has a combination lock to go in/out without bothering anyone. What a great cook! Breakfast is a must do! Excellent public transportation. Literally 1 1/2 blocks to main bus lines. Upscale food store and restaurants within 3 blocks walking. Refrig and microwave in room. Really nice snacks in frig when we arrived. Will recommend 100% and stay again. Was able to do a laundry! Quite room. Shared bathroom. Daughter in Law from same area in CO. Thanks Flor.  We hope to see you again.  :)
493591,5874966,2013-07-20,7430910,Darleen,"We loved our stay at Flor's House!  Our son was in acute intensive care at Harborview Hospital and we chose Flor's House to infuse our time in Seattle with warm and colorful environment and people.  We were not disappointed.  
  The best part was Flor and her wonderful family members, Joseph and Nacho. They truly take pleasure in seeing guests smiling and comfortable. 
 The Peruvian cooking was splendid. We could hardly wait for each morning's breakfast!  Flor prepared Peruvian ceviche one evening that we will always remember.
  She also provided generous and healthy spread of  ""snacks"" upon our late evening arrival. 
   The bed was extremely comfortable.  The room was equipped and furnished with every possible convenience.
  We miss our new friends at Flor's House and we smile every time we speak of them.
  We highly recommend staying here when in Seattle.
Darleen and Bruce

493591,5926777,2013-07-22,2059378,Vickie,"Great house, nice neighborhood, and wonderful host.  Flor keeps a beautiful house, and supplies many, many extras that you normally would find only in a super-luxury resort.  For bicyclists, it is only a short ride to the fantastic Burke-Gilman trail...which is 50 mile of paved off-road bike trail, which in turn connects to numerous other rail-to-trail routes.
For the price (actually, regardless of the price), Flor's house is the best place we have ever stayed in the AirBnB network (and we have stayed in some great places in the US and in Italy)."
493591,6104162,2013-07-30,6473751,Cat,"Ballard is super close to everything! The room was of a good size, comfortable for my mother and I. The beds were very comfortable and provided for amazing nights sleep. The stocked fridge on check in was very welcome and a present surprise. Flor was sadly away due to unforseen events and Joseph and Nacho were very accommodating. They even supplied the arch for my best friend's wedding. I will definitely stay there again if I need to rent a place. Thank you very much for making our trip to Seattle so enjoyable! "
493591,6347075,2013-08-09,7260187,Markus,"Very friendly. Clean. Nice neighborhood.

Great bed.  Good room.  Plenty of amenities.  Friendly and effective hosts.  What more does one wish?"
493591,6616601,2013-08-19,5856894,Ella,"Flor is super lovely! She warmly greeted our group upon arrival and showed all the vast amenities of the house. Rooms and bathrooms are very clean and contain all the essentials. She doesn't mind when guest return and even offered to rent us a car cheaper than a regular rental. I can definitely recommend this place. 

The only con that was very frustrating was dealing with her son. Ats we agreed on an arrangement based on the larger size of our group, he was changing the story and the price. Thankfully that was resolved."

493591,13454113,2014-05-27,11055067,Bec,"Flor was an absolutely amazing host, with not only her kind hospitality but the rooms were amazing. Spacious, so clean and also so self sufficient as Flor has thought of everything! Microwave, fridge (stocked with food and drinks!) TV and comfy bed - what more could you ask for! Was great to speak to her about her Peruvian culture and also the dinner she cooked us was to die for - She even helped us to print off our boarding passes! We highly recommend Flor's five star house - it certainly lives up to the title and more"
493591,14917997,2014-06-29,15624068,Cherry,"Flor is a super best host that I've never met before.
First day when we arrived in airport,due to some unexpected incident ,we and Folr could not contact each other for about 2 hours, but Flor still waited us patiently until we met her and picked us up to her house, it was 10:30pm, we are hungry and tired,
 Flor treated us Peruvian chicken soup and rice for dinner, it was so yummy and warm in our hearts !
The house is  very clean ,comfortable and convenient. It's very quiet for sleep, . The  location of the house is great, nearby one big supermarket ,also there are some bus stations so we can  take bus to the downtown or other place easily. Flor and her husband Nacho are very nice and warmly.  Even amazing thing is : Flor looks like my aunt ! We talked very easy and relax like real family.
Flor's house just like our home in Seattle !
We are so lucky to choose Flor's house to stay ! Thank  Flor and Nacho brought so many sweet memories and great experience for us .I'll remember all of these things forever !  
Hope we can come back again soon! "
493591,15275667,2014-07-06,2799769,David And Elizabeth,"We loved staying with Flor. She is an amazing woman. We enjoyed our room, it had everything we needed plus more. We asked for the breakfast and it was great. We didn't need to eat again until dinner. We stayed in room #5 with the king bed. We had a shared bathroom and there were several other long and short term guests at the house which made it interesting. The location was in a quiet neighborhood with a grocery store, park and bus stops nearby if you don't have a car. Flor went above and beyond to accomodate us, we forgot our passports and she accepted the express delivery, she had our laundry done (for free!), and she even helped us print our cruise boarding passes at the last minute."
493591,15545064,2014-07-11,16932658,Fengling,非常美丽的房子，Flor十分热情，让我们在美国的旅程画上完美的句号！早餐十分美味可口，再次感谢Flor的接机送机，不然我们两个女孩四个大箱子都不知如何是好，哈哈，非常宝贵的经历与感受！
493591,15715677,2014-07-14,11763359,Allyson,"Flor is a gracious and welcoming hostess.  I can't say enough nice things about her - she truly loves hosting people in her home.  Flor's husband, Nacho, is also very nice.  Flor greeted us when we arrived and gave us a tour of the home.  Our room was stocked with many extras, food, drinks, plush towels and bathrobes!  She told us over and over that her house was our house and we were welcome to the kitchen, living room, backyard, etc.  We loved the convenience of walking to the D bus line to downtown Seattle, Starbucks, and local restaurants.  Even though we had a car (easy to park in the neighborhood), getting around downtown Seattle is much easier by bus than by car.  If we had more time we would have explored the nearby Carkeek Park.  It looks like a great place.  We will definitely stay with Flor again."
493591,15851153,2014-07-16,3580502,Jackey,The room is cozy and clean and You will get all you need in that room plus bunch of drinks and food in the fridge. Flor is such a great host that she is so helpful and friendly. Highly recommend this place!! 
493591,16744815,2014-08-01,7299993,Cecelia,"Flor communicated with me on a continuum once she accepted my request.  She greeted us with a warm and welcoming smile.  Then gave us a tour shortly after we arrived so we'd know where things were which really enhanced our stay.  Having an opportunity to stay at ""The Five Star House"" is truly an magical experience. Our room was fit for royalty.  So nicely appointed and with amenities that far exceeded my expectations.  The bed was oh so comfortable.  Flor's home is located in a quite residential neighborhood, close to public transportation, and close to  downtown Seattle and the airport.  Flor raises the bar of excellence for AirBnB hosts.   P.S. Experiencing a Peruvian breakfast is a wonderful treat.  Her fruit smoothies are simply delicious."
493591,17005421,2014-08-05,17064486,Kate,"Flor and this house are absolutely amazing! The house itself is clean, comfortable and well organized. It is in a quiet neighbourhood, easily accessible to other parts of Seattle by bus or car, and close to some beautiful areas (like Carkeek park) that we wouldn't have seen otherwise. We would highly recommend Flor's delicious (and filling!) Peruvian breakfast - do it at least once, especially on a day when you need a good start! Everything was great, but Flor herself is definitely the highlight of this airbnb - she took us all over Seattle, showing us areas we would not have found on our own and shared her great knowledge of the city. Her warmth and kindness made us feel like we had known her forever after about 5 minutes! We hope we will be able to come back to Seattle again soon and stay with Flor and the 5 Star House! "
493591,17629665,2014-08-15,22792,Leigh,"Flor and her husband are just delightful people. She is so lovely, warm, friendly and inviting that it made the difference between paying for a room and living in a home environment. She is an excellent cook (whatever she makes in the blender just drink it. Don't ask questions it will be pure delight) and stocks a mean refrigerator. My room had a frig and microwave in it plus everything I could imagine for my stay. I could have left at least half of my suitcase at home, she had such a complete of toiletries etc.
I would definitely would stay again!!!"
493591,18139303,2014-08-22,15758327,Ally Myungok,"Flor was very warm host caring her guest quite much. I felt like staying at one of my relatives house. The room condition was okay, but it was decorated specifically for the honeymooner or a couple, so it wasn
't the best choice for me. The location was a bit away from the downtown, but the bus near the house was convenient though it took quite some time like 40min one way. "
493591,19973534,2014-09-21,7579377,Darryl,Thank you for a wonderful Airbnb experience Flor! We really enjoyed our time in Seattle and are very grateful for the kindness and hospitality you shared with us.  Your home is beautiful and you've really put a lot of time and effort into ensuring your guests are comfortable and taken care of.  The bed was SUPER comfortable :) Thanks again and please stay in touch! 
493591,20423198,2014-09-29,19475193,Kelly,"Flor made us feel very welcome right from the start. She had our room stocked with everything we needed so we were comfortable and relaxed our whole trip. Her home was very peaceful and other guests were friendly. She was very approachable and happy to talk and made our stay in Seattle one with many sweet memories! Also, the neighborhood was near all the places we wanted to visit and quiet, which was wonderful. "
493591,21689131,2014-10-21,1147826,Victoria,"Flor's place is warm and welcoming and she is a wonderful host! She provided all the essentials and she was always available to answer all of our requests and concerns. The room was comfortable and well appointed. She provides lots of snacks and toiletries, more than enough towels, and access to her kitchen. It felt less like an airbnb rental and more like staying with a good friend or relative. Very cozy, very safe and very well managed. Her place has excellent access to all the conveniences, it's not far from downtown and it's near one of the best parks in Seattle: Carkeek Park. She will make your stay memorable and enjoyable. "
493591,21987864,2014-10-27,14514343,Sara,Flor made us feel very welcome in her home. She's clearly and expert airbnb host and had every thing covered. 
493591,24453066,2014-12-28,4061114,Phoebe,"It was a great experience! Even though we arrived on Christmas Day, Flor still got everything ready for us, we really appreciate it! The room was clean and cozy, the beds were very comfortable. Flor truly knows how to make her guests comfortable. Our room was well equipped with everything we needed. The house is very close to the bus stop, which can directly take you to downtown Seattle. We had a great stay at Flor's, highly recommended! "
493591,26426585,2015-02-12,25513923,艾灵,"Flor is so nice, she gave me unconditional acceptance since my searching house on Airbnb was so late. I like everything in the 5 star house which I think is the most beautiful in the world. In my room, there is anything for me, I can do everything in the room,it is very convenient! Flor is so nice, she introduced everything in house, telling me how to use in details. She prepared DVDs that my daughter and my son loved very much! She kissed my children with warm hearted .The house is so quiet because other guests are very careful! Thank you Flor! Next time I will live here without doubt!"
493591,30232691,2015-04-19,3381175,Lily,"What can I say? Flor is a superhost for a reason. My friend and I didn't use the common areas at all as we were in Seattle for just the weekend. But our room (#5, Marilyn Monroe room upstairs) was beautiful, spacious and immaculately clean with plenty of closet space and hangers (that were even color coded to the room!). If you've forgotten a toiletry or need some coffee in the morning, you will be taken care of. The neighborhood is quaint and pretty; we felt super safe. 

Flor's attention to detail and genuine warmth toward my friend and myself during our stay was just right. She's a gem in the airbnb community - as is this house that we were lucky to call our home for the weekend! Thanks Flor for your hospitality and we cannot wait to stay again. "
493591,32824482,2015-05-22,8613969,Harlene,"LOCATION, LOCATION, LOCATION.  I chose to stay here because it is close to where my son lives.  But it is also close to Carkeek Park, a lovely place to hike and enjoy the beach.  Close to a grocery store and restaurants, close to bus stops, one an express bus to downtown.  All this in a quiet residential neighborhood.   The room was comfortable and all the people I met were friendly.  I appreciated getting a ride from the airport with Joseph."
493591,33130796,2015-05-25,31103008,Meghashyam,"Flor was unfortunately out of town to attend her son's graduation. But she had made alternate arrangements for us to be welcomed into the house. The house is just as described in the reviews. Very nicely decorated house with pet turtle and birds in the living room. The rooms are very well organized with all the necessary things supplied like towels, drinking water, shampoo, robes, and a hundred essential things. Most of the time we didn't even have to leave the room, since everything was in it already. Even though the bathroom is shared between many guests, I am pretty sure it was being cleaned and maintained on a regular basis since it was spotless and clean every time we had to use it. The bathroom is also stocked with all the essentials. The neighborhood is very safe and nice and good to take walks anytime. There is a very nice breakfast/diner place nearby and several other stores so its in a pretty good residential location. And it is within 5 or 6 miles from most of Seattle's tourist locations like Space Needle etc. "
493591,34175505,2015-06-05,34403973,Roy,"Our stay was absolutely wonderful!!! Flor is one of the most friendliest people I've meet.. She had everything and more that you would need or want in your room.. fresh fruit,refrigerator full of drinks and snacks..all the amenities of a hotel but more.. the neighborhood was very nice and we had access to stores, bus stop and restaurants just mins away.. we would definitely recommend to stay here.. I also would like to add a short story, I left my wedding ring there and didn't realize it.. Flor called me to ask if I had lost some jewelry, I didn't realize it until then.. my ring is now on its way home to me, thank god!!! I just want to say how much I appreciate her honesty, I'm so thankful we stayed there, I have left things at hotels and didn't get it back... Flor made us feel so welcome and I will definitely stay there again.."
493591,34382619,2015-06-07,34927066,Nick,Flor's house was clean and organized.  All met or exceeded expectations

Thank you so much!"
493591,35207170,2015-06-16,30131214,Anne,"Flor you were most welcoming and explained the set up excellently. Thank you for the stocked fridge and the local tour. Your location is excellent....close to shops, bank and bus. We also appreciated the offer to pick us up at the airport and later the drop off at the station. We were very lucky to have found you. You have a wonderful future with Airbnb. Our thanks again; Margaret and Anne."
493591,35694641,2015-06-21,34394963,Anne,Very clean accommodations. All amenities carefully thought out.
493591,36590754,2015-06-29,35694627,天诺,It's a really nice place to stay especially it's our first time to Seattle. The household Flor is nice and kind. She made our trip better. Hope we have chance to stay with Flor again next time if we are going to Seattle again!
493591,37344572,2015-07-06,35010352,Jameel,"Flor was a gracious host. The room was very well furnished, with appliances, dishes and snacks. From the house, you can easily arrive in downtown Seattle. Attractions such as Ballard, the Locks and Green Lake are nearby. It was no problem to come or go at any hour. The guests in the house are quiet and respectful."
493591,39153349,2015-07-21,30618697,Joy,"What can I say about Flor that others don't already know? She is a fabulous, fantastic, generous, kind, caring, and delightful hostess and one of the finest people my mom and I have ever met! Her ""5 Star House"" should be called ""The TEN Star House"" for all of the attention to detail Flor gives her home and her guests! Every convenience has been thought of-and if you mention something that you need, it appears like magic! Luxury at every turn! Flor is much more than a host...she is now a friend. I cannot recommend more highly Flor's Five Star House...even though I'd like to keep it my little secret! THANK YOU, FLOR (and your husband!) for two unforgettable, wonderful weeks! No goodbyes-just ""see you next time""! XOXO
Joy and Sheila"
493591,40935917,2015-08-03,36354930,Amy,"This is the ideal Airbnb experience! Flor is an amazing host and a wonderful human being. She has a true gift of hospitality and I'm so grateful that she shared it with me and my friend during our stay. I arranged to have her pick me up from the airport for a great price and on the drive to her house she gave me wonderful advice about what to see in Seattle. The house is awesome - so much charm. I was in the classic rock room with all sorts of Beatles, Michael Jackson, etc memorabilia. The room came with more than you could expect at a hotel - free snacks in the fridge, netflix on the TV. Towels and robes were all included. There are shared bathrooms but they have shampoo and all the amenities inside. Rooms have towels, washcloths, and robes. We also had a sink in our room. Flor straightened our room every day when we were out and even washed our dishes. Her house is just a few blocks from many major bus routes - we had a pleasant ride each morning. There is a large grocery store very close where you can buy anything you could possibly need - including your Orca bus card. There are also many restaurants in that complex - the only one we tried was Patty's Egg Nest where we had a delicious (huge) breakfast. The neighborhood is very quite and nice. We returned at 10PM and felt completely safe.

But by far the best part of the experience was Flor herself. Words can't describe her kindness and generosity. She would check on us every day to make sure we were having a good time. She started the trip by taking a selfie with us and ended it by having us write in a guestbook. It is awesome to look at the board where she tracks who is in the house - she has guests from all over the world! One evening she was having a birthday party for her sister and she invited all her airbnb guests to eat some traditional Peruvian dishes(absolutely delicious) and birthday cake with her family. We met two of her sons and they were both very friendly.

I would absolutely recommend staying with Flor if you're planning a Seattle trip. This experience added so much to our vacation. We spent far less than we would have on a hotel and we got to make some wonderful memories with our truly lovely host!"
493591,41445788,2015-08-07,38861710,Lotte,"Me and my husband had a wonderful experience at Flors place. This was the first time we booked at airbnb. Everything was exactly as expected, and Flor is a very welcoming host. The room (#5) was spacious and equipped with everything you can think of. We found the house quiet and respectful. From our room upstairs we could hear whenever someone came in or went out, but that was not bothering us at all. That's what you can expect when you're in a residential area. The location was perfect with easy access to downtown Seattle. We had a rental car, and Flor texted me where to park. Perfect! "
493591,41970107,2015-08-10,36633434,Karl,"Flor was very welcoming and her son even offered to help bring in the luggage. They were having a BBQ on Friday evening and invited us, but we had plans. The location was perfect for us in a great neighborhood. The rooms descriptions were accurate and they had food in the refrigerator, coffee  and mini-kitchenette.  
Flor is very creative and has themes to the rooms. So many things packed into a room was impressive, which was great, but a bit crowded. The bathroom was shared with 3 rooms on the second floor with another bathroom downstairs. On our visit there were times when both bathrooms were occupied. 
Overall, we look forward to staying again and getting to know Flor better.
 
"
493591,43483744,2015-08-20,32854687,Kathryn,"I would recommend the 5-star house.  My room was comfortable and quiet. it had everything one needs, a micro, fridge, toaster, coffee pot, lots  of towels, even guest robes. The host, Flor, was available 24 hours and is a fun, gracious woman.  She made me feel welcome.  The house is close to the bus which runs 24 hours a day and is only $1 if you're a senior.   There was also a grocery store at the stop, and  there were a couple restaurants close by. I felt safe walking alone in the neighborhood.  I'm glad I chose the 5 star house and would return there again."
493591,44957608,2015-08-30,12196008,Cindy,Flor was very inviting and generous host and everything was as described. The place was clean and quiet and well stocked and organized.

She really goes above and beyond to make sure her guests have a great trip. The rooms are furnished with everything you could ever think of needing, including a fridge fully stocked with snacks and drinks. She is a great chef and even greater company. "

493591,53678444,2015-11-11,39668556,Iris,"Flor Cruz and her family are both perfect hosts that I never seen before.They gave me lots of patient and kindness,Every private room is saperate in the house,which has the TV、refrigerator、microwave oven、living goods、and a king size bed.There's breakfast in the refrigerator.Every decoration in the room is made by Flor Cruz from her heart,and every room shows the meaning of a theme,Likes the ocean or other fashions,All of the decorations in their house are wonderful and delicate. They impressed me a lot and we look like family,Also there's a little bit language barrier in the original of our chat,but I think when I come back to visit them in the next time,That's will be great enough in our communication，I really love their family very much and I hope I could go back to visit them soon.

And Flor and other guests are friendly. And as a traveler, the public transportation to downtown is really convenient. I will never forget the time in 5-star house. "
493591,57802801,2015-12-29,48205395,Jamie Joohyun,"I really recommend Flor's five star house to who is looking for stay in Seattle:) Flor is the best host and she is really friendly. The house is decorated all by Flor and it has all different theme. All of stuffs are clean and all rooms are having own private. Of course security is good. 
Kitchen is well organized and Flor always offer plentiful of foods if you need:) 
All the guests are friendly and atmosphere of    this house is cozy overall :) 
I REALLY Recommend Flor's lovely house"

7203765,41820722,2015-08-09,31214003,Megan,"This was our first time in Seattle and first airbnb experience; Iulia made it a great one! Despite the last minute booking arrangements Iulia was a wonderful host for our trip to Seattle. She made us feel very welcome in her home and made our arrival and departure very smooth.
The studio apartment was an excellent home base for our walking excursions to Key Arena, in the Seattle Center as well as a visit to Capitol Hill.  The apartment was a little cozy, but there was plenty of room for the 2 of us. 
I would definitely recommend a stay here to anyone looking to avoid the bustle of the downtown core.
Thanks for a great trip, Iulia!"
3732076,17245457,2014-08-09,10474693,Gabriel,"The neighborhood is beautiful, tho it's a little distant from shopping and the like.
Luckily the house has long boards and bike that one can borrow and a major trail right across the street.
They were still building up the location when I arrived but it is lovely area, lots of space. Multiple kitchens and bathrooms and lots of other resources. It was lovely."
3732076,17716207,2014-08-16,9016060,Cris,"The neighbourhood and view is fantastic; I stayed on the top floor, and when working from the couch you can see the Seattle skyline out over the water.

The bunks are comfortable and there is lots of workspace throughout the house. The only complaint I have is that the top floor/top bunks can get hot; some fans would be nice :)

Besides that, it was a fantastic stay. Everything was really clean, and the other housemates were very friendly. I'm coming back here whenever I visit Seattle."
3732076,18587299,2014-08-28,5460591,Grady,"Once again, it was a very pleasant stay. They got a really cool atmosphere that I'm sure anyone in tech would appreciate."
3732076,19093088,2014-09-06,9556908,Sam,"I enjoyed my time at the house.  The host was welcoming.  The house was quiet, and thus a great space to get work done.  The location is safe and close to Fremont, which is a great small-town-feeling neighborhood.  "
3732076,24161395,2014-12-21,7693924,Drew,"Awesome house and very comfy bed!  It's social, almost hostel-like, and the other guests were friendly.  The location is fantastic!"
3732076,29679899,2015-04-11,1125196,Paul,"cor36 was an amazing experience! The house is newly remodeled and painted and has great furniture and facilities for getting work done: big tables, lots of chairs, comfy couches, and bikes/helmets/locks for getting around. From my first night, I met interesting people working on their own startups and projects, which inspired me to get work done on my own startup. Matt the house captain was friendly and available.

During the day, I had most of the house to myself, and often invited friends over to co-work with me. I really liked the occasional hack night, like making an LED beacon when the International Space Station was overhead.

Keep in mind, this is a shared living situation, with 4 bunk beds in the same room."
3732076,31395937,2015-05-04,21040456,William,Stayed the second time here and i really totally enjoy the hotel with all the hackers meetup ... i enjoy the room again.. 
2650482,19976220,2014-09-21,5422376,Patrick,"Marty was a very enthusiastic host.  Marty met us at the apartment, and showed us how everything worked, about parking in the neighborhood, etc.  The apartment was sparking clean, had a nice view and was spacious.  Ballard is very convenient to downtown Seattle by bus or car.  The apartment was accuratly described in the listing, and did not disappoint."
2650482,20877706,2014-10-06,1858604,Dave,"Marty & Taryn's house was perfect! Just as shown in the photos, a warm, clean, minimally decorated home ideal for a family like ours traveling with a young child. Our son loved the kids room & toys. Marty was kind and welcoming taking time to tell us about what to expect around the neighborhood, leaving a detailed note of favorite restaurants, cafes, bars, etc around Ballard, as well as leaving us a pound of his favorite local coffee beans. Marty was available to answer any questions we had and made us feel his home was ours. We enjoyed our stay!"
2650482,26025890,2015-02-01,10395433,Andrea,"We had such a great time in Marty and Taryn's lovely condo. The setup was ideal for us as we were traveling with two small children. The home was super-clean and baby friendly, and our kids had so much fun there. The condo itself is right in the heart of Ballard, so everything was an easy stroll, and the view was a treat. Also worth mentioning is that there is a huge market on the ground level of the building, which is very convenient. The Penners were extremely hospitable--leaving treats for us and checking in to make sure we had everything that we needed. I highly recommend this home and we hope to stay here again the next time we visit Seattle. "
2650482,27155016,2015-02-26,14477054,Tony,The reservation was canceled the day before arrival. This is an automated posting.

2650482,34973961,2015-06-14,21366138,Andrew,"As gracious of hosts as I've ever had on AirBnB! Place was clean, lovely, and easy to access. Great location to explore Ballard and more interesting, non-touristy parts of Seattle. Parking on street wasn't hard to find. Taryn and Martin easy to communicate with as well. "
2650482,36699964,2015-06-30,34792332,Karina,"This was our first experience with Airbnb and I don't have enough words to describe what a wonderful experience we had with Taryn and Martin, beautiful place, very clean, great location and great great hosts! Clear and prompt communication and they made our stay so easy in every single aspect, they even recommended their baby sitter (Thanks Tori). 
"
2650482,37333533,2015-07-06,8147231,Janice,"Peppered Marty and Taryn with so many questions even before we arrived which they gracefully and promptly answered (anxious first time parents traveling here), which I really appreciated. Met Marty at one of his pizza places to pick up the keys - very friendly and welcoming to Seattle and his place (even left us some local beers to sample - tasty considering the incredibly hot weather Seattle was having). Photos of his family's lovely home are accurate - comfortable especially with our active mobile 10-month-old daughter! Felt like home while we there for a long weekend visiting friends. Neighborhood was filled with lots of young families, plenty of bakeries and coffee places within walking distance. Can't wait to visit again!"
2650482,38987935,2015-07-20,30074872,David,"My wife and I loved staying at Marty and Taryn's place with our 20-month-old son. We had been to Seattle a few times before, and knew that we wanted to stay in Ballard to take advantage of the restaurants, shopping and Sunday market. The location of the apartment is perfect for everything — you're just a few minutes' walk from some of the best restaurants, coffee shops, bars and shopping in the city. And it's only a bit longer to walk to the Locks (which seems weird, but is actually really cool) or several great parks, and a short drive to the zoo. Marty and Taryn have an excellent list of recommendations to help you decide between all the options.

The place itself is clean, full of light, and has great views. Having an extra room with toys and books for our son was fantastic. And Taryn and Marty really made us feel welcome. Marty personally checked us in, gave me recommendations and answered questions about the complex and neighborhood. He even had some local beer waiting in the fridge. And both of them checked on us during our stay to make sure everything was going well. We’d love to stay at their place again next time we’re in Seattle. "
2650482,41385075,2015-08-07,35384860,Travis,"Marty & Taryn were great to us! Their home is wonderful and the neighborhood was perfect; they gave us lots of suggestions on what to do, where to go, what to eat, etc. Our (almost) 3 year old loved it, and we have never had such a nice time in any hotel with him before. The park next to their building was great to run around in too (helped our son burn off that extra energy from the time change!). It was very easy to catch a bus to the EMP, Pike Place, and Miners Landing from there. We would recommend that anyone with small children stay here if they want to avoid hotels and get a real feel for the city. "
4264012,20940961,2014-10-07,22136629,Suzanne,"I'm SO happy I chose the ""Architect's Haven"" for my 1st visit to Seattle!   Upon arrival,  I  was welcomed to a stylish urban home.  In my room, I was surprised with treats & local info on great places to visit.  It was the perfect location: a nice walk to Alki Beach,  a bus stop just steps away (by a fun neighborhood Tea & Coffee Shop), and easy access to downtown & Pike Place Market  with the bus.  After returning ""home""  after my daily excursions, (I felt like such a local by then!) I felt pampered with little spa goodies.
The bed was very clean & comfy as well as the rest of the home.  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND ""THE ARCHITECT'S HAVEN"" for those looking for a great local experience in Seattle!!
Thank  you Emily for being such a great host!

4264012,20980640,2014-10-08,22136082,Donna,Perfect!!!! Tastefully decorated & very clean home in a handy location! Emily gave me & my son ideas for fun local eateries & places/nearby islands to visit.  She also helped with how to get wherever we were going.  This young architect has lots of travel experience (Europe & almost all of the 50 states!). She  knows just what's needed for a perfect visit.  I  will stay here the next time we visit & recommend this place for anyone else planning a visit to Seattle.

It was a very warm welcome with delicious muffins and a quick tour through her very nice and tastefully decorated house.
We were very happy to get to know the Seattle ""Insidertipps"" by Emily.
The room was very clean and cosy and we almost felt like being at home. 
Emily is a very nice, socialable and helpful person and we would definetly recommend Emilys place for a nice and central accomodation in Seattle.  "

After waking Friday and meeting Emily I decided to extend my stay for the rest of the weekend!"
4264012,21691558,2014-10-21,15758048,Matt,"Having only booked for one night after talking and meeting with Emily, it seemed foolish not to stay for longer, as she was so nice: a fantastic  host and friend. So I extended my stay for the weekend. 
I felt truly at home in Emily's place, its in a perfect location close to a really quick bus route to downtown.
I'd also like to thank Emily for being so kind and showing me, a complete stranger around the city as well as making time to hang out with me. I had an amazing weekend In Seattle and will definitely be beck "
4264012,22260714,2014-11-02,16651103,Tegan,"Emily was a great host - very accommodating and fun to live with! I had just started a new job and needed a place to stay for a few weeks before I could move into my apartment. Staying with Emily was just the transition I needed! Her town house was right next to the bus line, which made getting around really easy. It was close to bars, grocery stores, and coffee shops. Emily was great to cook with and go out with. Wonderful host! "
4264012,23106494,2014-11-23,7411415,Anand,"It was my first stay through Airbnb and I felt comfortable knowing abt the place and details from her. It was generous of her to arrange for a pickup for me from (website hidden) I was shifting from Chicago so had a 3 big luggage bags, so her picking was a great help. She could not make for pickup but she sent her boyfriend either, so she is a responsible host. The place has a play ground nearby where games keep going till night so it makes the area lively. The place is not much walkable but there are buses to downtown and near by area. There is a coffee shop near by too.The only problem you can have is with the size of bedroom which is not too big if you use the bed as king size,but if u can manage in full size it will be fine. The rest I can say is that she is helpful, so u will be taken care. Enjoy ur stay."
4264012,23982514,2014-12-15,15336471,Charlie,"Very nice room with a super stylishly decorated house!  Emily was a fantastic host and made us feel at home.  Great house, great host, great location!"
4264012,25371768,2015-01-13,25045932,Randy,"Outstanding! This was my Best Airbnb experience ever! She has mastered the art of hosting.  Emily went above and beyond my expectations to make my experience one of a kind. The 1st day of my stay, I was left with a bottle of champagne,  chocolates and guide magazines of nearby shops, restaurants, etc near the area. The place was very clean and gave me a cozy home feeling. She is very sweet and kind. I personally recommend her. Emily hosting is the example of what all Airbnb should be. She will always be my 1st choice when choosing  a host. 5 out of 5 stars!"
4264012,25419836,2015-01-15,25032810,Laurine,"It was my second time that I have stayed at Emily's house. Emily is a great host. I arrived late in the evening and although she had to work next day, she was very kind and helpful to explain and recommend what I can do the next day and how to get to the places. Her house is located right next to the bus stop, which makes it comfortable to get around in Seattle. Emily made me feel very welcome at her cozy and clean home. The second time I stayed at her house, I was there for one night, travelled to Hawaii and stayed one more night when I came back. Between this time it was possible to store my big suitcase at her house. That made everything very comfortable for me."
4264012,27416647,2015-03-03,27976373,Daragh,"Emily's house was perfect for what I needed for my stay in Seattle. Her house is well located , clean and she was extremely friendly and helpful whenever we met during my stay. I'd have no problem recommending Emily's house to anyone. "
4264012,27724250,2015-03-10,25481021,Jillian,"I enjoyed staying at Emily's place. Emily was really easy to communicate with in advance, and really friendly and helpful on arrival. She even invited me to join her and friends for dinner and board games which I appreciated as a solo traveller. The place was clean, comfortable and really close to city buses and a decent corner coffee shop. A great stay! "

4264012,28367733,2015-03-22,315557,Boris,"Emily and her boyfriend were very friendly and the space was very clean and comfortable. Emily's place that is quite and residential, bus line is convenient. "
4264012,28495491,2015-03-24,23764200,Cindy,"Emily has a lovely house, very clean and homie. Direction to get into the house was easy to follow. The king bed is very comfortable. Everything is great, will stay again if I return to Seattle. "
4264012,28974212,2015-04-01,30055875,Daniel,"Emily was very good at communicating and very accommodating. I had a very late arrival from the airport and subsequently requested a late checkout. The place was exactly as described and Emily made me feel like it was home. The coffee shop next door is fantastic and the bus stop is almost right in front of the house. Due to my late arrival we didn't get to meet, but would certainly stay again. A bit of a drive from the airport, but worth it for
the value. Thanks for everything!"
4264012,29358194,2015-04-06,29846538,Andrew,emily was super awesome!
4264012,29650619,2015-04-10,27173837,Neil,"Emily was great! Didn't get to meet her, but she was very accommodating about booking me on short notice.  She gave me very detailed instructions on how to enter the house. Knowing that she was not going to be home when I arrived. I really appreciated it! Great first time experience with Emily and airbnb. Thanks!"
4264012,30313387,2015-04-20,28991745,Heena,"Emily's place was great! Homey, room was spacious, comfy bed, clean bathroom... basically home away from home. Emily is a wonderful host, very friendly and helpful.  Big plus her house is in the perfect location close to downtown (10min drive) and alki beach (8min). "
4264012,32788714,2015-05-21,12271907,Katja,"House was neat and clean.  The bed was very comfortable and no night-time noises to disturb my sleep. Emily is very pleasant and accommodating.   Some minor negatives:  the bedroom and bathroom are really quite small, advertised with breakfast but there was none, no live TV, only movie choices."
4264012,32874218,2015-05-22,16286478,Laura Lynne,"Emily was great about getting me in on a same day stay. The bed was very comfortable and she gave great suggestions for places to eat. There is also a nice coffee/crepe shop houses away from her. It listed continental breakfast, but there was none. That may have been due to same day booking. There was also no coffee, but otherwise a wonderful stay and close to downtown. I'd recommend staying here!"
4264012,33168619,2015-05-25,32867576,Emily,"As this was our (my boyfriend and I) first trip with airbnb, Emily was very helpful and welcoming. The listing was exactly as she had described, and the neighborhood was wonderful! It was a short and very easy trip downtown on the bus and Emily helped us figure all of that out. She was extremely helpful in helping us figure out the website and how to book and also when we got there she gave great instructions on how to get into the house. She made us feel right at home and was extremely easy to talk to. All in all this was an amazing experience and we are so thankful we had such a great host!"
4264012,33844576,2015-06-01,30549802,Jessica,Emily was very nice and the space was perfect for what we needed! Thank you.
4264012,34567684,2015-06-09,32411037,Jonathan,"While my girlfriend and I did not have the opportunity to meet Emily, she was very prompt with her replies and was very hospitable.  We stayed one night at her place which was very comfortable and suited our needs.  Thank you Emily!"
4264012,35500376,2015-06-19,35036232,Tracy,"Emily was an incredibly friendly and hospitable host! We felt very safe and at home in her house. The location was a perfect distance from downtown and it was an easy commute to anything in downtown Seattle. The highway was easily accessible. There was a cute coffee shop ""Pearls"" down the street that my daughter loved to get her morning coffee. The room was a little small for two people and luggage. Doable, but small. We are pleased with our first Airbnb experience, and happy that Emily was our first host!"
4264012,36042173,2015-06-24,15237425,Sarah-Ann,"Emily was very friendly and helpful, and her house is cosy and clean. We did not have any problems staying at her home. The bus-stop is a very short distance away and it is convenient to go downtown. However, the price is a little high for a one-room stay and the space available."
4264012,36475069,2015-06-28,12678957,Deidre Annie,"Emily's place was a great spot!  The room was exactly as described. Perfect for the three nights I stayed.  I drove and there was plenty of free parking in front of Emily's house.  The bus is just right at the corner and is so easy to get downtown.  
Her place is a 15 minute bus ride to downtown and a 10 minute drive to Alki beach. 
Emily was the perfect host.  She made me feel very comfortable and at home.  She gave me some great tips for getting around the city!  I definitely recommend Emily's place when you are visiting Seattle.  I can't wait for my for my next visit - I'll be staying here again :)
Thanks Emily!"
4264012,36641587,2015-06-29,6664917,Matthew,Emily was very welcoming and kept in constant contact to make sure we had access to her home. The bedroom was clean and toiletries were provided. The location is very close to downtown/sports stadiums. Our stay was great!
4264012,36928119,2015-07-02,24607961,Jingyi,That's a wonderful experience at Seattle.i like Emily very much.She's nice person to help me live at (website hidden) friendly.and home cook by herself it's so nice.that's truly nice memory  in my life.also the apartment very nice too. Thanks Emily.
4264012,37262892,2015-07-05,32170581,Kailun,Good host and very cozy place!
4264012,37632916,2015-07-08,1993171,Marianna&Cesare,The host canceled this reservation 16 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
4264012,38063226,2015-07-12,20886181,Ekaterina,"Good room, Emily was very welcoming! She was flexible about my check in. Unfortunately I had a jet lag, otherwise I would accept her invitation to go out with her friends. House is spacious, 1,5 bathrooms, Emily was almost never at home so it feels you have the entire house. It's a bit too far for everything but if you have a car that's easy.
Thanks a lot, Emily!"
4264012,40403666,2015-07-30,377488,Marc,"I'm new to AirBNB. This was my second experience. I thoroughly enjoyed it. The bed was huge the way that I picked (from two options) it to be laid out. It was perfect. I was in late and out early both nights I stayed in the room. Plus I only had a duffle bag and my computer.

Downstairs was gorgeous. I wish I had more time to spend hanging out down there. 

Emily was really nice and extremely good with communication. Offered to help in every way imaginable. I feel like I have a new friend in Seattle. If I come back, I'll check first to see if she has room, then look at the rest of my options if she's booked or offline. 

I did Google the neighborhood quality for walk-ability. It only got a C, but I walked to the Pho' place and it was fine. I didn't feel comfortable taking my computer to a coffee shop because of the C rating, but I didn't see anyone that looked like they wanted to mug me. Next time I would take it with me. I think the neighborhood is more like a B."
4264012,42552562,2015-08-14,27710951,Yinqi,"This room is very nice, just like what the pictures show. And it's also very convenient for us to go to downtown, since there is a bus stop just beside the house. 
Thanks to Emily's hosting, we had a good memory in Seattle. "
4264012,44366554,2015-08-25,22364622,Sarah,"Emily is a very nice host, though I honestly didn't get the chance to spend much time with her. This stay was perfect for me because I had plenty of time to study in a peaceful environment and had the chance to visit with my daughter. It has a nice location close to a couple of restaurants and the bus stop, making it convenient for me. "
4264012,45317217,2015-09-01,25758637,Mark,"Emily's house was great! Her place is in an awesome location with cool restaurants in walking distance, and downtown is just a short bus ride away. You get your own private room so it truly does feel like a bed and breakfast- and the bed is HUGE and extremely comfortable; perfect to relax on after a long day exploring the city of Seattle. Plus, Emily is just a cool person with a fun personality who makes great convo. We genuinely enjoyed our stay at Emily's town home, and I would recommend it to anyone. Thanks, Emily!"
4264012,45539802,2015-09-03,10428713,Aris,"My stay was perfect. Emily's place is very warm, inviting, quiet and very clean.  She even gave me great recommendations on local places to go and I went to two of them.  It was a great place to base my exploration of Seattle."
4264012,45884889,2015-09-06,18053100,Alex,Emily was really great at accommodating our last minute request to stay at her place. The house was lovely and just as it looks in the photos. The 10 minute bus ride into Downtown Seattle was perfect for our stay and made it easy to get around. I would recommend this as  a place to stay!
4264012,47788974,2015-09-21,40377339,Adelina,"Emily was very welcoming and provided all the information we needed to get settled in and gave us great tips on where to go out at night. Parking was really convenient and we opted to take public transit since downtown is only a short bus ride away and it was an easy transfer to get to other neighborhoods in the city. There's not too much room to lay out your luggage since the bed is huge, but it's definitely still manageable for two people. If you're looking for a quiet and cozy place in Seattle, this would be it!"
4264012,48845279,2015-09-28,22764856,Len,"My stay was good. Emily is very hospitable and kind. Room and everything are fine and clear, and the location is really good for the city."

8631419,55206925,2015-11-29,21566846,Teresa,"Beautiful house! Great location in a gorgeous location with a view of Mt. Rainer in the distance. Ian met us and gave us a tour of the house.  He stayed in an apartment with a separate entrance to the house, but was so respectful of us being there. We specifically looked for something that could accommodate us cooking a Thanksgiving dinner for family there and it didn't disappoint us. Awesome kitchen to cook in and Ian was great in answering questions with short turn around time between guests staying there. Would love to rent it again in the summer! Thank you Ian for letting us stay in your beautiful home!"
8631419,56323224,2015-12-12,22377289,Erin,"Ian was great and his house was perfect for our family when we needed to be out of our house for a week long remodel. It is a well appointed home in a great location. Minutes drive to the West Seattle Bridge and minutes walk to shops and restaurants in the Alaska Junction. Ian was very easy to work with, communicative and available whenever I had questions. It is an older home so sometimes was a bit drafty on those colder nights, but there were plenty of blankets to keep us warm and when necessary we just turned up the heat. Definitely a great experience overall!"
8631419,57977473,2015-12-30,52343784,Melissa,"The location and home were perfect in terms of location, view and as described.  It was well appointed, and the host made us feel welcome by having it decorated for Christmas, with the lights on as we arrived.  It provided ample space, and slept 6 snuggly - 3 queen/full beds. "
6546748,34374352,2015-06-07,1607679,Sarah,"This house is amazing!  What is more amazing is the lakefront property with two docks and two diving boards!  It also has an outdoor fireplace right by the hot tub.  we watched the moon rise and it was incredible.  The master bedroom is gigantic with a jacuzzi tub overlooking the water.  The neighborhood is quiet and peaceful but you are a quick drive to Seward park, Columbia city, and many great restaurants.  We had our wedding here and it was the perfect setting with a long pathway of gardens leading to the water.  Roger was an amazing host and very accommodating!  We will stay here again.  I would recommend this spot to anyone.  the perfect summer house!"
6546748,34825417,2015-06-12,18247222,Peck,"The Hammer family was a great host！Treat us as a family！
The location of his house its perfect，water front ，20min to downtown，lovely food market in 5 minutes，the room itseft is as described，great lake view . we even had a wonderful BBQ dinner together！ 
All in all，great experience ，we defintely visit again next month！thanks Airbnb，than k you Capt.Roger！"
6546748,35010247,2015-06-14,28885435,Teresa,We found this lakeside home perfect for celebrating our son's graduation from UW. Roger and Marjorie were extremely welcoming and eager to please. The gourmet kitchen was a treat which combined with the barbecue and dining on the patio was the perfect venue to celebrate with friends. The home interior is spacious and beautiful. The weather was perfect for jumping into the lake off the diving board followed by a soak in the hot tub. 15 minutes from SEATAC was handy for an early flight out as well. My only regret is we didn't have more time!
6546748,38331883,2015-07-14,37427848,Ron,"A most enjoyable stay! Roger was very helpful, accommodating and friendly. I would not hesitate to return."
6546748,39313077,2015-07-22,36969170,Jim,"We had a great experience renting this beautiful house.  Roger & Margie are very nice and personable folks and became like family.  They were gracious and helpful hosts.  We enjoyed meeting and spending time with their friends John & Don.  The house is very striking and clean.  The amenities are several, such as a private doc on lake Washington with a couple of diving boards (low and high).  There was a spacious patio with an enclosed sun room.  The master bedroom has a nice balcony to view the lake.  Seattle was not far, about 25 minutes away by car or light rail.  I give them the highest rating possible."
6546748,40122749,2015-07-28,34873301,Carol,They were very helpful by providing access to their beautiful home and waterfront - much more enjoyable than staying in a hotel.
6546748,55383470,2015-12-01,22366964,Lois,"We spent a wonderful long Thanksgiving week-end at Roger's house, with one two-year old grandson in residence and his four-year old cousin a regular visitor.  The house worked well for all of us.  It is very ""homey"" and comfortable.  Roger had warned us of the one issue for little ones -- an open stair case off the living room -- and the children quickly learned the rule to stay by the wall when going up and down.  Because it was so cold we were not able to take advantage of the wonderful outdoor area but had spectacular views of the lake and the changing weather over it (including from the upstairs bath and shower!)  House was very easy for a family to be in and it was easy to cook for and feed six adults when the whole family congregated for Thanksgiving dinner and other meals.  Roger also was extremely responsive when we had questions and did just the right amount of checking in with us.   As others have noted, the location is great -- easy drives to both the airport and downtown; very quiet neighborhood; children can walk to the local park.  We are hoping for a return visit one summer to take advantage of the great lake access.  "
7329805,43818445,2015-08-22,28509375,Michael,"Booking process and communication until check-in very smooth and all required information received in time. The house was easy to find and reflects exactly the description and pictures, i.e. it's a lovely place to stay in perfect condition.
Very quiet and friendly neighborhood conveniently located to explore Seattle downtown and sights.
The whole family enjoyed it."
7329805,44152298,2015-08-24,3608141,Scott,Jennifer and the Pillow team made us feel right at home. The house was just as it was described and we had a great time. My children also had a good time. The neighborhood was great and the it was very convenient to take the bus downtown.
7329805,48648342,2015-09-27,44370358,Jason,"We simply love the house very convenient for shopping ,
out of the major traffic woes

1220471,5756580,2013-07-15,2127343,Nicholaas,We had an amazing trip to Seattle thanks to Josh and Alex! They were super helpful with our stay and would love to return again in the future. Thanks again!
1220471,5845766,2013-07-19,6530507,Kathy,We had a wonderful stay at your condo. We loved the deck and open layout of the place. Location was outstanding. Walking distance to everything and we especially appreciated being in the Capital Hill neighborhood. Josh and Alex were such welcoming hosts. Thanks!
1220471,6242015,2013-08-05,6791179,Alene,"I highly recommend staying at Josh and Alex's home. Josh was attentive and communicative, and their home was both stylish and comfortable. However, like any metropolitan city, parking is quite difficult (even with the zone pass), so I'd suggest looking into overnight garages nearby to avoid hunting the streets for a parking space late at night. Other than that, the location is great, and the hosts couldn't have been more accommodating. Thank you for a great experience! "
1220471,7009606,2013-09-03,2441460,Jacob,"Beautiful apartment, super clean and organized. Alex was friendly and helpful. Would love to stay again some time."
6765045,38896846,2015-07-19,36991103,Ted,"This delightful Wallingford house was clean, well appointed, well organized, comfortable and in an ideal location to serve as a base for all things Seattle.  Out hosts were very communicative throughout the entire process and left good instructions at the house to assist our stay.

The neighborhood was clean and quiet and parking on the street was easy with spaces always available just a few steps from the house. 

There's also a 24/7 market (QFC) just up the street that is as well stocked with diverse products as any neighborhood market I've ever seen. 

 All in all, our stay was a very pleasant experience and I wouldn't hesitate to book another stay with our hosts for this charming house."
6765045,41794594,2015-08-09,37523453,Vivian,This house was perfectly situated from a park that has the most incredible view of the city. Cosy house and Devin and Michelle were very responsive and gave all the information we needed. No problems at all - we had a great stay! 
6765045,43957348,2015-08-23,5799846,Belinda,"We loved staying at Devin & Michelle's place.  Everything was exactly as described.  The communication with them prior to the trip was great and easy.   We were a group of four old friends and wanted a comfortable place to reunite, catch up and have separate sleeping spaces.  The place itself was perfect and exactly what we were hoping for.  We loved the front room to sit and catch up.  The kitchen and bedrooms were great.  Lots of light in the home and the location was perfect for us.  We walked to coffee shops and walked down the hill to Gasworks Park and spent hours walking the path along Lake Union.  All in all, this was a great stay for a group of friends and would be great for my family of 4 also.  Thanks Devin & Michelle!"

6848455,39975083,2015-07-27,7293253,Rose,Beautiful townhouse! Had a great time staying here- Jamie was easy to communicate with and the townhouse looks just like the pictures. It is right next to a bus line as well and there is good food and coffee within walking distance. Would highly recommend this airbnb! 
6848455,40946191,2015-08-03,3167497,James,Jamie's place was a perfect choice for our group of three.  The location is just a short uber ride ($8-12) to downtown and all of the tourist attractions.   The place is brand new and well appointed.  She was extremely fast to respond to any questions we had before and during our stay.  The rooftop deck with the view of Mt. Rainer was an added bonus.  One of my friends left some clothes in the closet and she is even mailing them back to him.   I would highly recommend a stay here!
6848455,41967742,2015-08-10,3683989,Megan,"Jamie's house was great. Perfect location for the event we were attending, and great nearby local spots to hang. Her house was clean and welcoming. I recommend her spot! "
6848455,43102945,2015-08-17,22557710,Laura,The townhouse looks exactly like the pictures. It's immaculate and minimal. Jamie was very welcoming and provided everything we needed for our stay. Great experience!
6848455,46168257,2015-09-08,21133385,Nikka,"Jamie made us feel very welcomed. The house is well stocked and everything we could have possibly needed for our stay, we found around the house. The pictures depict the place perfectly. The townhouse is fairly new, and its in a quiet/friendly neighborhood. The location was perfect for us, so it was short drive to head to downtown Seattle (tourist attractions) and to the Fremont/Ballard neighborhoods. Would definitely love to stay here again on my next trip to Seattle. :)"
6848455,49646943,2015-10-05,31666141,Karen,The house is clean and nicely decorated. Check in was easy and flexible. Jamie was always available for questions. It was a very pleasant experience. 
6848455,55382499,2015-12-01,3811127,Amy,Very easy!   jamie was great about change in arrival and on a holiday!   comfortable   quiet location but not that far from action    
2621746,11337498,2014-03-30,13463374,Alan,"Great location and newly furnished and remodeled apartment! Sid was extremely responsive and very helpful. He was installing the internet and was able to meet me at the apartment to give me a walk around. 5 minute walk to pikes place, very central location. "
2621746,11443247,2014-04-02,4367287,Paul,"This place was absolutely stunning. The pictures don't do it justice, right in center of downtown seems like everything is just 5 minutes away. Had the pleasure of meeting the owner and he's a great guy. Already highly recommend to a few friends of mine. "
2621746,12075946,2014-04-22,13208845,Samantha,"Our stay at Sid and Neha's was great! Being on the 22nd floor, it had a great view of both Capitol Hill and Mount Rainier. It was in a great location, walking distance to many things and accessible to public transpo. It was also very simple, clean, and comfortable. We'll be back soon hopefully!"
2621746,12165054,2014-04-24,14210744,Ashley,This was a great place for my stay! The location is perfect in downtown next to pacific place with all other restaurants and stores only being walking distance away. The apartment was clean and cozy with plenty if extra amenities. It was as if I was just at home with a beautiful view in the city! Will stay here again in the future if need be :)
2621746,12246380,2014-04-27,3543451,Mike,Great accommodations. Wonderful view. So close to everything. Can't get a better downtown stay than this.
2621746,12350066,2014-04-29,13603767,Natalie,Cool little condo and a great location to get to everything.
2621746,12470637,2014-05-03,14451323,Grace,"I stayed till beginning of May, and it was awesome.. the apartment was clean and it was located just right in downtown. It was really convenient and easy walking distance... Sid and Neha were really helpful.. they responded to my request very fast. I would recommend people to stay here and they will never regret that.."
2621746,12696551,2014-05-08,3187841,Rick,The apartment was perfect and the hosts were very easy.
2621746,12754409,2014-05-10,12207326,Christina,"The apartment was in a great location, just minutes to pike market and the main shopping area. The apartment was modern and spacious, perfect for a short stay in the city!"
2621746,13108009,2014-05-19,9271871,Megan,I splurged on staying at this place for my college graduation celebration and it was worth every penny.  The apartment was wonderful with great views of the city and yet it was not noisy at all.  It was a great location for all the exploring that we wanted to do .  Loved it!
2621746,13213524,2014-05-22,6031375,Rebekah,"What a great apartment! Very nice, very clean, and perfect location a block from Nordstrom and shopping and just a short walk to everything else in Seattle. We enjoyed our stay very much. Check-in was super-easy and communication with the host was great in terms of logistics etc. The bed in the bedroom was extremely comfortable. It's a newish listing and there were a few minor little details (i.e. we were short one coffee cup - very minor!) but it sounds like the host is working these things out. This was a great value for a terrific place, we would definitely stay again. "
2621746,13474787,2014-05-28,8524868,Maggie,This apartment is well located in the heart of downtown and a quick walk to the water or to capitol hill.  It is clean and has all of the comforts of home.  Great views too!!  (On a clear day you can see to the water from one balcony and to Mt. Rainier from the other)  I would definitely stay here again!
2621746,13570672,2014-05-31,14287233,Becca,"We had a great time staying at the apartment!  The check-in and check-out process was smooth.  The location is great and you can walk to some great shopping and restaurant locations.  If you're flying in, it is very easy to get to and from the airport as the light rail stop is only about a block away from the apartment.  The apartment was clean and included everything we needed for the stay!"
2621746,13975737,2014-06-09,1275482,Linda,"I really appreciated Sid's professionalism.  Things happen and it's a part of life, but Sid made sure that no matter what happened, he took care of my party and honored our reservation even though he took a loss on it.  He made sure we were taken care of regardless of whether or not he made a profit.  I really appreciated that and would trust to do business with Sid anytime.  Thank you Sid."
2621746,14472353,2014-06-20,14086599,Mary,Great location! Checking in and out was easy. The balconies were really nice and offered different views depending on how clear of a day it was (be aware you'll probably hear the highway). Bought food at Pikes Place and prepared it in their great little kitchen. Sparsely furnished but if you are in and out as much as I was it won't matter a bit. Loved it. Thanks for everything!!
2621746,15622938,2014-07-13,14480287,Anne,Location is fabulous and coffee shop in building is a nice treat. Condo was nice but sparsely furnished. Lots of good tourist maps and info available. When we were in Seattle (July) it was very hot - the apt had A/c but it was in living room and did little to cool the adjacent bedroom. Check in was easy and went well. 
2621746,18156197,2014-08-22,16755705,Brennan,"This apartment is perfect for a tourist or a visitor because its right in the middle of everything .belltown ,queen anne,capital hill,first hill , downtown are all very close and that made this apartment a fantastic option for me as someone from california used to being able to walk or catch a quick uber everywhere I need to go.Sid was a fantastic host and worked around me need to check in early and check out late as well as being available via text the couple times I had questions about the area or building .The building itself is beautiful and the exercise room allowed me to do my workouts without having to take a long journey out to the closest 24 hour.I even watched a movie down in the rec room on the mezanine and did some work down there to get a little breather from the hustle and bustle of the city.the in unit washer and dryer was also a big save for me traveling as it made it easier to leave clothes in and come back to them when I finished meetings or errands.I have air bnb'd before and its my preffered option for staying because it allows you to feel at home in another city and sids place was without a doubt a fantastic home base.I have already booked another short stay in this apartment and would reccomend this apartment as well as any of sids listings simply because of the professional and welcoming way sid handled my stay ."
2621746,18389833,2014-08-25,755572,Aleks,Sid and Neha were very communicative and helpful in getting us set up on a last minute trip to Seattle.   Thanks!
2621746,18462208,2014-08-26,16755705,Brennan,"I enjoyed another stay with sid in this beautiful unit and as always was thrilled .There is some thing to be said about a host having multiple units and the calendars being booked solid .The check in and out process is super simple and easy and I feel like I'm flying into town and going straight to my own seattle apartment when I have stayed here .Sid is available as much or as little as you need and is by far one of the most accomodating hosts your going to encounter on here or any other travel booking site.If the dates you need are available I would suggest you book them immediately because this unit will book fast ( trust me I do this myself as well - or you will be stuck finding a different option and it won't be as good of an experience ).I don't often leave long reviews nor do I review units more than once but in this case the building ,the unit , and the host have more than earned the extra effort ."
2621746,18503553,2014-08-27,1737913,Lolly,"Condo was fantastic.  The WiFi didn't work and I got a parking ticket because there was no parking pass but otherwise this is a fabulous place.  Clean, comfy and great location."
2621746,18782730,2014-09-01,2031480,Michael,"We stayed at this apartment for about a week during PAX Dev and PAX Prime. It's in a great location, with easy access to the convention center, downtown, and Capitol Hill. The check-in was painless, and the hosts were very responsive. The furnishings were adequate, if a little sparse. We didn't use any of the common areas or amenities.

That being said, the building had some problems that negatively impacted our experience. About midway through our stay, the water went out without notice for several hours. The next day, the water was back, but only cold water was available. This affected our ability to shower, which wasn't helpful during a hectic conference; it made me wish I had booked a hotel instead. It also prevented the use of one of the elevators. There are only two to begin with, and the building has more than 20 stories, so this was a painful experience. Finally, there is a nasty smell in the hallway outside the unit that you have to endure while waiting for the elevator.

I liked the hosts, the unit, and the location, but the building is part of the experience too. I don't know if the water outage was a fluke; I only know what happened to us. I hope Sid, Neha, and other owners in the building can work with the association to ensure that these aren't problems in the future."
2621746,18989880,2014-09-04,12850515,Tom,"We had a great time staying at Sid and Neha's place. Not only was the location fantastic, but the accommodations offered pretty much everything we could ask for (full kitchen, washer/dryer, etc). Check in/check out was very easy as well."
2621746,19455569,2014-09-13,14663452,Niels,"We enjoyed our stay here due to the comfortable amenities, the city views, the building security, the host's hospitality and the terrific location within walking distance to most major attractions.  "
2621746,19724287,2014-09-17,9820307,Gerry,"Couldn't be better !  Checking in was a breeze.  The space was perfect for my business trip - clean, functional and un-cluttered.  WiFi was fast (faster than the conference I was visiting - I ended going home to get some work done ;-)  Less than 5 minute walk to the Westlake Light Rail station that gets you to the airport.  Whole Foods is a few blocks away. Union Lake or Pike Street Market waterfront are real close when you want to get some exercise into your day.  Perfect, very pleased.

Thanks Sid & Neha !!
All the best ..."
2621746,19835361,2014-09-19,8208738,David,"We had a wonderful time exploring the beautiful city of Seattle. Sid and Neha's apartment was the perfect base of operations to explore the city. The apartment was close to the light rail, shops and sights. Sid and Neha were great at communicating with us the instructions to get into the building and the apartment. The apartment was great, clean and comfortable. We had a great stay. Thank you."
2621746,19886860,2014-09-20,20368329,Juan,"I give this place 5 stars. It is beautiful, walking distance to all downtown, the only thing is that there is no satellite TV. Well this is coming from a sports lover but if you are going to eat and be out and about you will love it too. i will definitely book this place again"
2621746,20134032,2014-09-24,14696464,Geoff,"Location was great right in the centre of Seattle. Great coffe shop below and really close to airport light rail station
"
2621746,20257718,2014-09-26,21412781,Eric,Sid and Neha's place is great. Would definitely stay here again. A perfect retreat from the bustling conference I attended.
2621746,20409671,2014-09-29,9225868,George,"This is a nice, attractive apartment with many pros.  It is clean, modern, secure, and at a great location. The furnishings and appliances are all in good shape. The floor to ceiling widows and balcony add to the spacious feel.  The air-conditioning unit in the living room, the glass top stove, and a Bosch washer and dryer are all nice touches.  The view from 22 stories up is lovely.

Our host communicated with us quickly and clearly before and during our stay, and arranging for us to drop our luggage there 3 hours before check-in.  

Overall, this is a very good choice for a place to stay that was reasonably priced.  I would certainly recommend it to others.


"
2621746,20517242,2014-09-30,20982219,David,Great stay.  Great location for events at the convention center.  Wifi was nice to have.
2621746,20589282,2014-10-01,489144,Patricia,"The listing was accurate and the apartment was modern, clean, up to date and convenient. Close to everything and perfect for my quick overnight business trip. Was nice to have access to the gym. Sid generously let me access the apartment and drop off my luggage at noon even though check in was 3pm. "
2621746,20613216,2014-10-02,2045051,Suzanne,"The place is fine, but obviously a strictly commercial place.  Excellent, central location.  Was bit disappointed with the view, as the apartment pretty much just looks over a highway, which also made it too noisy to keep window open.  "
2621746,20774947,2014-10-05,21301746,Marla,"Great location, comfy condo and the host was very helpful. I'll definitely be back. "
2621746,20811857,2014-10-06,15697742,Kim,"Great Location! Walking distance to everywhere we wanted to go (Pike's Place Market, the Space Needle, Shopping). The apartment has an amazing view of Mount Rainier (it was sunny while we were there). Super clean! Sid was very quick to respond and exceptionally helpful. We loved that the TV had Netflix. Such a memorable trip (we got engaged!!!) and the apartment made it even better! "
2621746,20975053,2014-10-08,4473163,Lynne,"Location, location! Right next to the convention and an easy walk to Pike Place and the monorail. Apartment is comfortable and easy to find and owners are responsive to questions. Recommended."
2621746,21193347,2014-10-13,15454239,Veronica,"Sid answered my questions before arrival and gave me perfectly good instructions on how to access the apartment. The apartment was very bare looking but had all the amenities you could wish for. The location was excellent and very handy to all we needed. The unit was very clean and everything worked very well. 
Our only complaint was that it was very noisy at night due to the constant traffic noise from the nearby freeway. We purchased earplugs so we could get some sleep before our early start. Am very surprised that double glazing is not available in the apartments on that side of the building.
We are light sleepers and of the older person category and would still find it impossible to imagine that a younger person, even a sound sleeper would not have trouble getting a good nights sleep."
2621746,21324198,2014-10-14,21580308,Justin,What an incredible experience!  Sid was extremely helpful and provided a wonderful place to stay. The location was amazing as well!  Close to just about anything you'd ever want to do in downtown Seattle!  Thank you for the hospitality!
2621746,21428198,2014-10-17,11272868,Duncan,Very swanky apartment. I wish that I knew more people in Seattle so I could have brought them over to show it off.
2621746,21491279,2014-10-18,22369128,Victoria,"Didn't get to spend to much time there at the apartment, but it's a great location close to everything downtown."
2621746,21844549,2014-10-25,22257718,Kris,"Everything was perfect. This place was clean and ready to go. Sid was so quick to answer any questions we had and was very accommodating. Our next visit to Seattle, we will be looking to see if Sid's place is available before we look any place else."
2621746,22011696,2014-10-28,6705969,Alecia,Clean space and conveniently located. Sid was very nice and helpful. I have already recommended his place to friends.
2621746,22461464,2014-11-07,22242064,Ryan,"Great place, was accurately described, Sid was very accommodating for my last minute request for parking.  My stay was very pleasant."
2621746,22719290,2014-11-12,7933344,Margaret,"This condo suited me very well for a 2-day business trip to Seattle.  It’s centrally and conveniently located, and it has a great view especially at dusk when the setting sun is reflected (on sunny days, that is).    It’s very modern and pristine.  The bed was quite comfortable.  I didn’t get time to use the fitness center, but I enjoyed the coffee & bakery shop on the ground floor of the building called Ladro’s – an unexpected convenience.    Sid was very helpful, including coming to my rescue the first evening when I had trouble with the keypad access to the building.   Recommended!"
2621746,22756861,2014-11-13,23008184,Danielle,"We booked this very last minute, and it was very convenient! Sid made it very straight forward and easy to check-in and had available parking. It was centrally located and fun to stay in!"
2621746,22920003,2014-11-17,12650764,Erik,"The apartment is nice and being 22 stories high is pretty neat. I only stayed one night but everything went smooth. I was late checking in but Sid and Neha were very accommodating and everything is set up so they don't have to be there. It was pretty easy, the apartment was nice and it was awesome that they had parking in Seattle.

Thanks Sid and Neha!"
2621746,23172339,2014-11-24,23345533,Joseph,"Great place. Apartment was very clean and as described. Location is perfect for exploring the city. Close to shopping public transportation, etc. Would definitely recommend this place."
2621746,23550264,2014-12-04,20631166,Janakie,Clean and comfortable. easily accessible with friendly and accommodating hosts. Central neighbourhood. Highly recommended
2621746,23686868,2014-12-08,18396831,Jia Yin,"Great house and perfect location. Sid is really kind and careful. My mom and I dad a good time in Seattle. The kitchen has everything you need!!
很好的房子。地点也不错。非常干净。值得体验！"
2621746,23894226,2014-12-14,6746316,Kati,"What an amazing place to stay in Seattle this was!!! 22 stories high with a fantastic city view , modern furnishings and great location to everything we wanted to do! The apartment was clean, the queen bed was comfortable and plenty of towels were available. 

Sid was very friendly and helpful. During our four day stay, we had two requests while we were there. The first one was that we needed an extra comforter for our overnight guest. After texting Sid, he showed up in twenty minutes with a comforter, new sheets and a new blanket!  The other request was to extend our checkout for one hour due to we had enjoyed ourselves a little too much the previous night and woke up later than planned. Again we texted Sid, he immediately got back to us and said no problem! That meant a lot to us! 

Thank you Sid and Neha for accommodating us well. We will be back next year!"
2621746,24127269,2014-12-20,24895409,John,Sid was an excellent host. Everything was as described.  Sid was attentive to our needs.  Apartment was centrally located.  Would definitely stay here again.
2621746,24617919,2014-12-31,9790754,Arjun,"Sid was a great host! Did not meet in person, but the check in and check out were as smooth as possible, and he answered all questions I had in a timely manner. Clean, beautiful apartment as well, fantastic view! Definitely would stay again."
2621746,25155550,2015-01-07,21580308,Justin,This was my second stay at Sid's apartment and it was another great experience.  He was very communicative during check in and the apartment was perfect!
2621746,25309002,2015-01-12,12762911,Bruce,Excellent location - easy access to Downtown Seattle.  Nice quiet building.  Accommodations were simple and as represented.
2621746,25495706,2015-01-18,14059724,Kayla,Sid's apartment was great! The apartment was clean and neat and was in the PERFECT location for all sorts of things happening in Downtown. I would definitely stay again.
2621746,25580564,2015-01-19,7948410,David,Sid made our stay in Seattle great. His place is clean and tidy. Perfect place to go out from.  Good location with lots of stuff to do around the area.  Thanks again.
2621746,26373669,2015-02-10,26968548,Wook,"Did not meet in person, but the check in and check out were easy.  We had 2 reservations with Sid's places.  One near Space Needle and this one.  Space Needle place was very dissapointing.  Wifi didn't work. Sheets & comforter smell horrible!!!  If I had the time I would have washed them but since we got there @ 11pm I couldn't.  Heater also did not work so we slept with our padding jackets because he did not get back to us.   
We were very worried before we got there but This place was much much better.  Location is Great 15mn to Pike market.
Everything worked well.

We stayed 3 nights here & had two requests (extra blankets, late check out).  Sid responded however it would be more appreciated if he got back to us promptly.  
Before the reservation he got back within 30 minutes but it was not easy to contact with him after the check in.

"
2621746,26668918,2015-02-16,6464,Sarah Jane,"Great apartment! Spotlessly clean, and stocked with all the bits and pieces. The views are amazing and it's a quick walk down to the market or up to Capital Hill. Highly recommended. "
2621746,26727560,2015-02-17,27814245,Daniel,Listing is downtown with a great view of the city. Peaceful neighbors. Sid was easy to work with and accommodating while respecting our privacy.
2621746,26781957,2015-02-19,206203,Amanda,"Sid's Downtown 1 BR - Sky high apartment is clean, comfortable, and in a great location.  Check in and out was simple. Sid was responsive to my questions.  It is a bit noisy because it is downtown but earplugs worked great. I would definitely stay here again. "
2621746,27152701,2015-02-26,5734454,Sam,This place was nice. The host provided everything needed for my short stay and it was in a great location!
2621746,27718742,2015-03-10,18615067,Jenny,"The location of the apt is within walking distance of many restaurants, shopping and attractions. The apt was fairly clean and had all the basic amenities including parking for a small fee. The apt had the view of the convention center and mt Rainer on a clear day. Sid was easy to communicate with and checking in and out was very simple and straight forward. "
2621746,27810787,2015-03-12,5734454,Sam,Just as good as the last time! Sid's a great host. 
2621746,28109046,2015-03-17,22126267,Jake,Was an awesome clean place. Great location. Clean
2621746,28289637,2015-03-21,16069788,Nicholas,"Nice place that looks recently renovated. Fantastic location and fair price. Sid was very helpful, and even though I forgot to ask about parking when I booked he arranged parking for me at the last minute. Only drawback is the road noise coming from i5, but it wasn't that big of a deal. Overall, great place to stay."
2621746,28578855,2015-03-26,18426653,Rick,"I really enjoyed my time at Sid's place. The location is perfect. Walking distance of shopping, movies, Capital Hill and Pikes Market. The place was clean which is very important. "
2621746,28737116,2015-03-29,2257991,Kai,"I spent a long weekend in Seattle for a conference and Sid's apartment was the perfect place to stay at. Its location couldn't be more convenient for anyone attending events in downtown Seattle. It's also within walking distance to the Market, Space Needle, Capitol Hill, and most tourist sites. Access from the Airport is a breeze with the nearby Light Rail. The apartment is well furnished, very clean, with great kitchen and seating area overlooking the city and the bay. 
Sid provided me with all the information I needed, including transportation information and access to the building. I would definitely stay there again."
2621746,29927892,2015-04-14,3504480,Anthony,"Sid's 1 BR in the 801 Tower was the perfect spot for a week in downtown. Clean, sparsely yet tastefully furnished, with clear instructions for making the stay easy and comfortable. It's all about location, location, location, and the apartment is adjacent to the convention center, a few blocks from the main transportation hubs, and within easy walking distance of the Capitol Hill and Belltown neighborhoods for great food and drink. The view, looking SW over Cap Hill, doesn't hurt either."
2621746,30030547,2015-04-16,206203,Amanda,"Sid's place is a wonderful centrally located hotel alternative. You can even see Mt. Rainier if it is clear. Sid makes arrangements easy. If you plan to cook you will need to bring everything because Sid only provides spices but there are many good restaurants in the area. Otherwise the kitchen is adequately equipped. There is a fantastic coffee shop in the building. As in most any place downtown earplugs are recommended. Great building, nice apartment!"
2621746,30219419,2015-04-19,29547231,Cindy,"Great place to stay! Easy communication, close to everything."
2621746,30431577,2015-04-21,4984170,Robert,"Sid's place is great. Simple, comfortable and a great view. The location can't be beat."
2621746,30486134,2015-04-22,31550582,Oliver,"Sid was very proactive in making sure that we got in okay. He first emailed me the instructions on how to get into the property, and called again on the day of our arrival to double check. When we called or texted him, he answered right away.

The property is really clean and well maintained. And you can't beat the location! Right in the center of shopping and food.

We will definitely go back to this property the next time we visit Seattle."
2621746,31482300,2015-05-05,6624381,Damon,Sid was a great host. Great location. The apartment had everything we needed. 
2621746,32201270,2015-05-15,9942815,Ryan,"Sid's place was fantastic. Very clean, incredible views, great location and a ton of space. If your looking for a hotel replacement this is the perfect option. "
2621746,33245947,2015-05-26,28242640,Jane,Check in and Check out is easy. Sid responded instantly with questions I had about the apartment before I booked and responded quickly to my texts the day I arrived. Awesome apartment! Alot of open space for my 1 year old daughter to roam around. Location was great!
2621746,33470240,2015-05-28,4831252,Sytske,"Sid’s apartment is very neat! It’s located in a very central downtown location with easy access to the I-5. The apartment looks very new, clean, and tidy. 

Plusses:
- you can see Mount Rainier from the balcony on clear days!
- enough space, comfy bed, clean, nice apartment
- Sid is a professional host who responds very quickly to questions and has very clear instructions for checking in, parking, etcetera. 

Neutral:
- I don’t think anyone actually lives in Sid’s apartment, my guess is that it’s just rented out for airbnb. I don’t think this is positive or negative, but I wanted to mention it, so people know it’s an apartment free of personal clutter, it doesn’t feel like you’re in someone’s home.

We loved Seattle, but during our stay we had an unfortunate event: we parked the car in the ‘secure’ locked garage underneath the apartment building. It’s very convenient that there is a possibility for parking in downtown. However, unfortunately, during the night someone broke one of the windows and stole our bag full of climbing gear :(. So apparently the garage is less secure than it seems. The police told us this happens about 20 times a day in downtown Seattle and the people in the building also told us it had happened before in this particular garage. I wish we had known, so we had taken everything out of the car. This is why I’m writing this down - even though this is of course not Sid’s fault at all - I just want to warn any future guests to take everything valuable out of the car: just don’t leave anything in there at all (our climbing gear is actually not valuable to anyone else - no one will buy second-hand climbing gear - but it is very valuable to us and extremely costly to replace). Sid was very responsive and helpful and offered to reimburse us the parking fee, which is of course very nice of him.

All in all, I would recommend staying at Sid’s place if you want to be in downtown Seattle: you can’t beat the location.
"
2621746,33579668,2015-05-30,30241677,Ben,"This was an awesome place to stay in Seattle. Easy check-in/out process.   Communication with Sid was awesome and he was a big help.  Convenient, secure parking is available in the parking garage but having a small car is a +.  Easy walking distance to everything including amazing restaurants, Pike's Place, the waterfront.  
Thanks again, "
2621746,34885875,2015-06-13,268351,Ashlee,"Check in & out was easy, Sid was responsive and provided clear directions. Parking was a plus, although as with other reviewers, smaller cars fare better in the parkade. Wifi was excellent, and the two balconies were neat although the views weren't spectacular. There were some nice touches such as a toothbrush and basic necessities in the bathroom.

Excellent location, everything we had time to do was easily walkable, and the location off the freeway was great for us. If you're a rum fan, try Rumba which is only a couple blocks away.

Be advised that you'll need to leave time to launder your towels and bedding, and load the dishwasher. Very easy to do, it was just something we realized as we were checking out.

We would likely stay here again."
2621746,35282784,2015-06-16,12454122,Calum,The host canceled this reservation 16 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
2621746,35326722,2015-06-17,34324009,Mark,"I think the listing (now removed) was located in the wrong place on the map. This is right across from the convention center (about 1 block). Sid was very helpful in everything and the process was smooth. The only thing that was an issue was that there was only 1 key. This was a problem as my wife and I were sometimes at different places and it would have been a lot nicer to have 2 keys. The parking wasn't cheap ($15) but it was nice to have something that was secure and to not have to worry about finding a place to park. There was actually a pack and play and small mattress in the closet which were handy for children.

The apartment itself was clean and nice. There weren't a lot of pans, but there was enough to get by."
2621746,35556350,2015-06-20,31246822,Benjamin,Amazing location with great views and access to all of downtown. Sid was great at getting us checked in and set up. We stayed 4 days for a quick vacation and it was perfect. 
2621746,37800848,2015-07-10,2077699,Eric,"Sid was wonderfully responsive, helped me get into the place easily and answered my questions quickly. Like others have said, the place is a bit sparse, but in a fantastic location with a great view. On my first day, I could see Mt. Rainier from the balcony. I could also easily walk to just about anything (including my nearby favorite, Monorail Espresso).

Great spot. Highly recommended."
2621746,38261342,2015-07-14,17921256,Patrick,"Great stay! great location close to rental cars, Pike's Place, monorail to space needle. Quiet and cozy! Two balconies! Access to pool, gym , and game room. The kids now love shuffle board! "
2621746,38410337,2015-07-15,10234549,Dennis,"My boyfriend and I had a wonderful experience at Sid's place! Just as the picture illustrate, the view from he apartment was spectacular! We even got a clear view of Mt. Rainer in the evening, which was a perfect end to our trip in Seattle. In addition, the apartment was very clean and comfortable (it has AC!). It was also really easy to check in and out of, and Sid was incredibly helpful with the whole process. He sent me instructions on everything a good two weeks ahead of time, which I really appreciated for the sake of planning our trip. I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again for my next visit!"
2621746,39744516,2015-07-26,24912956,Kristy,"This was a great place to stay for our long weekend in Seattle. We have stayed in nearby hotels before so knew the area would be perfect. From the airport, this location is easily accessed by the Link Light Rail, with only a 2 block walk from the Westlake Staiton.  We were able to walk to the Space Needle/Seattle Center, Pike Place Market, Union Lake and Safeco Stadium easily however there is also transit and bike sharing near by. 
The place itself was very clean and easy to move around in. With four adults in there, it still felt spacious. Most necessary amenities were provided. We did not use the gym or pool but it was nice to have the option and both were well kept (from observation). 
Sid was very happy to answer any questions we had via text and e-mail. 2 weeks prior to arrival, he sent apartment access information which was great to receive well in advance. He also accommodated our evening flight departure by allowing us to store our luggage. 
Overall great place to stay for a busy weekend in Seattle. It was nice to have a place to 'come home to' after long days on our feet. "
2621746,41928764,2015-08-10,14656090,Jon,Sids place was just as advertised. It was a great place with a great view. We didn't have any issues and Sid was very quick to respond to any texts for suggestions about the city. The directions for checkin were very quick and easy. I would definitely stay here again when coming back to Seattle. Thanks Sid!
2621746,42419326,2015-08-13,36380537,Chris,"My friend and I visited Seattle a few weeks ago and found this listing. I was at first skeptical because it seemed too good to be true. It was very fairly priced for such a nice apartment. The view of the city was great as well. It was an excellent starting place to explore the downtown. Cid was a great host. He was very easy to get in touch with and very accommodating. Highly recommended!
"
2621746,43394337,2015-08-19,11796231,Vaden,"I can't recommend this place enough!  My fiancee, my daughter and I had a great stay. Sid was very helpful and informative.  We were able to get to and from the airport using the light rail, with only a few blocks of walking between - same with the monorail to EMP and the Space Needle.  A few block's walk past the station and you're at Pikes Market.  We can't wait to go back and stay in this killer condo again!"
2621746,44532640,2015-08-27,36230719,Greg,"Sid was a great host. The place was just as advertised. Great location for access to the city, with a lot of sightseeing, food & drink, public transportation, and rental cars within walking distance. Check-in was easy, using Sid's directions, and Sid was always quick to respond and accessible, when needed, and completely out of sight and mind, when not (no offense Sid). I would recommend this property to friends and family."
2621746,44890199,2015-08-30,6109901,Jana,"The perfect location! Close to the underground lightrail (which took us straight from the train station to just a few blocks from the apt.) , Monorail and walking distance to Pike St. Market. It was ideal for us since we took the train to town! 
The apartment was spacious for four adults and very clean.
Pre-trip, Sid was awesome in staying in touch and accessible. 
The only suggestion I have is, once we arrived in the apartment, I text Sid regarding the the lack of water pressure (we found out later that the building was testing the water throughout the entire building). But, he never answered my text and when I tried to call him (twice), it went straight to his VM and his VM box was full. As a newly checked in guest, that made me a little nervous that he might not be as accessible once we checked in. Once I found out it was a building maintenance, I promptly text Sid back to let him know we resolved the water issue. It's my opinion that he should have 1. Answered my initial text and/or 2. Confirmed that he received it and follow up to find out if we had any questions or other concerns.
Overall, we had a very pleasant stay and would stay here again!"
2621746,45781705,2015-09-06,10938986,Joshua,"Sid's place was great! Nice views of the city with all of the amenities that you would find in your home. Washer/Dryer (detergent included), kitchen, Wifi and free netflix was a plus for when it was raining. His spot was walking distance from most shops and was convenient coming back to get in a quick nap before heading back out into town. His place is definitely a must stay when coming into Seattle. I know next time I do visit, i plan and hope that his place is vacant. "
2621746,46298929,2015-09-09,24919414,Sam,Great location. Clear instructions on the stay. Responsive hosts.
2621746,47485826,2015-09-19,40540218,Max,I can't express enough how much I enjoyed my very first Airbnb experience with Sid as my host. The apartment was in perfect condition and was incredibly clean. The location was amazing for someone who had never been to Seattle before. Sid made checking in and checking out very convenient and simple. Everything in the apartment was conveniently labeled so we had no problem finding everything we could possibly need. It really was a wonderful experience all around. 
2621746,47821751,2015-09-21,10440376,Kia,What an amazing apartment! Great View! Great Location! Sid was a awesome host and any questions I had he answered quickly and accurately. Wonderful Experience!
2621746,48056029,2015-09-22,20669559,Michael,A+++ wonderful apartment downtown.  Close to everything.  All the basic necessities. Nothing to complain about.
2621746,49098298,2015-10-01,35627394,Erica,"The apartment was very clean and welcoming!  I was lucky enough to have great Seattle weather and the view from the condo was amazing.  It was easy to initially get in the building and the condo once I arrived. Perfect location for downtown and the conference I was attending around the corner.  there are great restaurants located all around this building as is is very centrally located!

Very happy about my choice to go with airbnb and Sid's condo over a hotel!"
2621746,49632272,2015-10-05,24499241,Camille,"This airbnb was fantastic! It was a perfectly located spot to relax after adventuring in downtown Seattle. The views were stunning and the space was so clean, cute, and had all the amenities we needed. Definitely will come back here when we have another chance. :)"
2621746,49813633,2015-10-06,6789947,Ernest,"We really enjoyed our time at Sids downtown retreat. After staying in many Air BnB's, I would have to say this one is the cleanest and best organized yet. The building itself is easy to find, super clean with a very nice lobby and in a great location for Seahawks or Mariner games. We walked to Century Link with no effort at all.  Sid was so quick to respond and was accommodating when we were a bit early. Parking was a breeze in the building and quite secure. I would recommend staying here and hope to be back!!!"
2621746,50990645,2015-10-16,10396908,Adrian,"I stayed at Sid's place for a week on a business trip to Seattle. Everything was fantastic.  Sid made the check-in process remarkably easy and seamless.  The quality and cleanliness of the apartment was great and of hotel quality.  And a great, central location, making walking the city very easy with quick access to plenty of eating, coffee shops, shopping, etc.  I will visit here again if the place is available!"
2621746,51139534,2015-10-18,38777370,L Belinda,"We had a fabulous stay. Check in was easy.  even let us drop our bags off early so we could enjoy our first day in Seattle. Apartment is just as it says, very clean, great location. Loved it!"
2621746,52093219,2015-10-26,44851490,Linda,Sid was very quick to respond. We got to the apt 20 min before check-in. I texted Sid and he let us up right away. The apt was the perfect size for my husband and our 4 year old. The internet and Netflix worked great and the location was awesome. A ten minute walk to Pike's and a 5 minute walk to west lake station.
2621746,53785728,2015-11-12,45458825,Heidi,"Our stay at Sid's high rise downtown was fabulous! Better then we expected! The view from the bedroom and the living room was incredible. Sid's apartment is extremely clean with a very modern feel. The bed was extremely comfortable which I much appreciate due to my sensitive back. The apartment had everything we needed from toiletries to dishes. We could tell he puts a lot into his apartment to make it the perfect stay for guests. There is also an awesome gym, a pool, and a mezzanine hang out room with a foosball table! :) I will definitely stay here again! "
2621746,53987501,2015-11-15,45858409,Oscar,"We had a nice stay at Sid's apartment. Little trouble at check-in but things worked out smoothly! It's perfectly located, the walk score speaks for itself. Sid is quick to reply and the instructions are very clear. Would stay here again."

We really enjoyed our stay and were impressed by her hospitality/generosity.

Would definitely recommend the place."

3308979,16619707,2014-07-30,12118051,Leslie,"Our stay at the New Modern House was amazing! A great view from every room on the top two levels. Jill left a wonderful welcome beverage and snack that was appreciated with a delayed arrival. The house was perfect for a family or two families with plenty of separate levels for hanging out. The entire house was clean and well cared for. The ground level had a bedroom and a play room, the main level had a great kitchen with Viking appliances and plenty of space to spread out. The third level had bedrooms; every one with a great view. The fourth level was where I lived. The rooftop deck was perfect for relaxing, and the den area was great for hanging out. Views of the Olympic range were stunning.
Three great parks were from 1 minute to 5 minute walks away. The neighborhood is a mix of historical and newly built homes. Grocery, great eating and shopping were 4 blocks away. Every day I ran from the house, down the secret stairs that line the Queen Anne area (269 steps down), through Kinnear park, and along Elliott Bay. The cats were also perfect hosts. Every recommendation that Jill left was a great find, and was outside of the typical Seattle tourist arena. 
Easy access to the bustle of downtown, but great to escape to quiet and safety at the end of the day. "
3308979,16990505,2014-08-05,16305171,Robyn,"The house is truly amazing and Jill couldn't be a better hostess. The house was very comfortable for our family of seven, it is in Seattle's premier neighborhood with everything that you could need only a short walk away, and the views of the harbor from the deck on the top floor were even better than advertised.   If we ever have reason to return to Seattle, we will certainly be contacting Jill. "
3308979,17185611,2014-08-08,19208413,Kris,"This house was an amazing find and fit our needs perfectly. New construction, tons of room and great views of the Puget Sound.  Roof deck was our favorite place to hang out. Owner Jill was great to work with and responded quickly to any questions even though she was out of town. 

We will definitely try to book this home again if we travel to Seattle in the future.

Thanks Jill!"
3308979,17403613,2014-08-11,19355967,Pete,"Host was fine.  We had no problems with her at all. Never saw her. The house was as expected - very nice, great, great view of ocean. Neighborhood very nice. "

The 3rd floor deck and the communal kitchen on the first floor were our favorite spots. Many thanks to Jill for being accommodating through out the process! We would love to return someday. 
3308979,23214294,2014-11-25,22458814,Janmeet,Amazing home

3308979,34619386,2015-06-10,3096318,Logan,"Wow!  What a fantastic place!  The Queen Anne area was fantastic and wonderfully walkable (with some hills to make it good exercise): Top Pot donuts, Trader Joes, city skyline vistas.
The accommodations were ample and delux.  The space was nicely separated and laid out to allow for everyone to have their own personal space, while also having excellent common areas that kept everyone socializing when home.  The up stairs deck with hot tub provided a great way to wind down at the end of the day while watching the ferries amble through the waterways.  The decor was very modern and artistic, while also being the right level of usable (not fearing that you would break every little thing).  All amenities were provided in abundance (e.g. towels, etc.) and were of top-notch quality.
The host was gracious, reaching out at appropriate times and ensuring that things were going smoothly with spot-check texts.
Overall, a great experience!"
3308979,34933632,2015-06-14,25549306,Linda,The home was in an incredible quiet neighborhood with million dollar views.  Jill made everything user-friendly.  Our extended family of 12 came to celebrate the graduation of our daughter.  It was a lovely family reunion at this beautiful location.  
3308979,35902596,2015-06-23,12517051,Tim,"The listing description was very accurate and the surrounding neighborhood is wonderful with a mix of large, beautifully maintained new and older homes. The home is new and was comfortable for our big group as it has a large kitchen with high end Viking appliances and 5 separate, good sized bedrooms.  We were an extended family of 10 (including a 1 year old) and we stayed for 7 nights.  We enjoyed the hot tub and evening sunsets over the water from the roof top deck.  Walking into Queen Anne for groceries, dining out, ice cream or to the bus was comfortable (keep in mind you are in Seattle and there are hills there :)).
 
Jill was very responsive via text and email to any questions we had during the first days of our stay and once settled in, we had no reason to reach out to her.

We would certainly stay here again with no hesitation.

We loved the kitchen area and especially loved the 3rd floor deck. There is a spacious hot tub and plenty of room. The views were truly amazing as stated, and we saw beautiful sunsets!

Jill was a great host! The house was clean and the beds were comfortable! It was easy to find and Jill even brought us a bottle of wine to start our stay!

We loved the neighborhood. It was a nice area and very close to downtown Seattle. We also loved being so close to the town of Queen Anne. We ate at a few places there and did some shopping in some of the small boutiques! Really loved the little town!

I would highly recommend this house for anyone who is traveling to Seattle and looking for a great house to stay in while there. Can't beat it!!"

Everything was as described and the host was helpful and responsive.  I would highly recommend this if you need the space in Seattle and I plan to use it again.  We were here for a wedding so we didn't spend much time in the neighborhood but it seemed pleasant."
3308979,43266983,2015-08-18,38690000,Dan,"Absolutely Perfect! This house had everything we needed during a recent business trip to the area. The kitchen was perfectly equipped with everything needed to create 5 star meals each night of our stay. We enjoyed watching all the action from the rooftop deck. The openness of the house and access to the outdoors made our stay very relaxing. The layout of the house is very functional and cozy. The three of us had plenty of space and we even enjoyed playing the guitars. The location was perfect...it was a quick easy trip to downtown, especially to our favorite breakfast spot in Pike Place Fish Market. We travel to Seattle several times a year and we hope to stay here again very soon! "
3308979,43791574,2015-08-22,37988552,Jeff,"What an amazing Place.  Fantastic views, wonderful accomodations.  Location was perfect for a true ""Seattle Experience"".

The pictures don't lie. The place is spectacular and has awesome views all around. The interior is all new, very clean and high-end. It definitely feels like staying in a luxury hotel at a fraction of the price!

In addition to the essentials, Chasten also provided an ORCA card (bus / public transport), a 24h pass for the bike share program, tons of recommendations to check out around South Lake Union and there are also a few travel guides in the room - in case you ever run out of stuff to do.

I ran into Chasten on a few occasions and he was fun to talk to and very helpful. He keeps busy and the apartment is very quiet otherwise. Definitely a place you can come back to and kick back after a long day exploring Seattle. I also used the nice desk in the room to get some work done during the day, which was great.

Checkin and checkout were very flexible and coordinating with Chasten was a breeze.

The South Lake Union area is really nice, has tons of restaurants, coffee shops and a few bars. Everything is walking distance.

Would definitely come back!"

Chasten is a super friendly host with great taste in interior design. Highly recommend to EVERYONE, especially young couples. "
7438635,42732639,2015-08-15,39079921,Fei,"Chasten was very helpful and gave me a lot of useful tips about restaurants/coffee shops and etc. Also the room was great, very modern, quite and clean. It was an enjoyable stay."
7438635,44722240,2015-08-28,4153423,Matt,This place is luxurious. Highly recommend. Chasten was easy to work with. Thank you so much!
7438635,45280820,2015-09-01,15201300,Konniam,"Excellent experience all around. Chasten made us feel very welcome in his penthouse, which is meticulously decorated. It is recently built and in a good location, close enough to most neighborhoods in Seattle.
The guest room is spacious and should be very comfortable for one to two people. It is kept clean and stocked with all supplies you would need. Chasten has thoughtfully included an Orca card and a bike pass for transportation.
Chasten made sure we feel at home, and was available whenever we have questions about the city. Great guy to be around. Highly recommend staying in his penthouse!"
7438635,50318950,2015-10-11,43452085,Matt,AMAZING! This was our first time renting through AirBnB and what an awesome experience. Chasten was such a great host. The penthouse was sooo clean and sooo nicely (email hidden)e pictures do not lie. We ran into Chasten a few times and he was always so kind and helpful. We had some questions about places to eat and he got back to us right away. The apt was quite and the views were stunning. Chasten made our first experience such a positive one I don't know if we will ever travel and not use AirBnB. Highly recommend staying in this beautiful penthouse next time you are in Seattle. Thank you! 
7438635,52542322,2015-10-30,23092349,Miyako Ann,"Amazing penthouse! No doubt that this place is the best. The rooms are exactly like the pictures and super clean. absolutely stunning... There was no chance to see Chasten, but my husband talked with him and said he was very nice. Sad that we only could stay one night. I recommend to book this place as soon as possible! Thank you Chasten.
本当にきれいでおしゃれですばらしいペントハウスです。こんな素敵なところは他にないのではと思うほどです。治安も良く、とても快適なステイになりました。"
7438635,53000987,2015-11-03,21093539,Bruce,"Chasten is amazing and the the place was more than we could have hoped for! Even thought it did rained it is Seattle, but the rain only made the PH more exciting, I feel. Really felt like a dream within a dream. 

Thank you Chasten for an profound stay! "
7438635,53538237,2015-11-09,47623058,Susan,"Chasten was an incredible host. I stayed there for 5 days on business. He was friendly and accommodating and went out of his way to make sure I had everything I needed. His place was spectacular--beautifully designed and luxurious. The room itself was super comfortable and felt like the best hotel. The location was perfect to where I needed to get to and also had some great coffee shops and food places near by. Chasten also was generous and let me hang 'til I had my flight. 

I would 100% recommend staying there for anyone traveling to seattle. "
7438635,54849080,2015-11-25,38519322,Timothy,"Chasten was an Excellent host. Very welcoming and accommodating. This being my first Airbnb experience I was nervous but it was very pleasant experience.   Check in and check out was a breeze and nothing to it.  Chasten place is beyond amazing, balcony was good for breakfast every morning, and the place  is very comfortable after a day of exploring Seattle.  Great location for people who are deciding to walk/use uber/ use public transportation.  The neighborhood is very peaceful during the weekend and great view of Lake union within walking distance.  "
7438635,55856334,2015-12-06,22355182,Thomas,"One of the nicest places you'll stay. An amazing apartment with an interesting story, and a great location and host."
7438635,58049578,2015-12-31,49527793,Aaron,"You will always remember your first time and boy did Chasten deliver. The pictures don't do the place enough justice. I would recommend this spot to anybody wanting to enjoy a great view, drinks, and art. Besides the Harry Potter altar lol had a great place. Will definitely being here once a month."
7615170,50644151,2015-10-13,6806292,Bill,"Christo made us feel very welcome.  The building is very secure, and the studio apartment is really excellent. The bathroom is right outside of the apartment, which is a little odd, but that's the way the building was constructed, and it didn't bother us. Note that this is a 3rd floor walkup to the apartment, so it might not be good for people who have difficulty climbing stairs. Also, the soaking tub has very high side walls, nearly thigh high, so that might be a concern for those not so flexible.
We were Christo's first guests, and he asked us to leave him suggestions for things he could do to make it more comfortable/useful/etc. We've done this, so future guests will  most likely have an even better stay.  But ours was just great.  We highly recommend this property. He was also very good about responding to emails and leaving us detailed instructions on how find the property and how to unlock the doors.
It is located in the heart of the Columbia City area of Seattle which has a theatre, several coffee shops, a bakery, lots of places to eat, etc. and is close to the light rail which takes you directly into downtown Seattle. It's a great area to stay in. We've stayed at other places in Columbia City and this is the best deal yet. We've also stayed in AirBnB's in other cities, and this one is one of the best."
7615170,57926879,2015-12-30,50319084,Patrice,"Christo was an excellent host.  The Loft was lovely and just as described.  We love the neighborhood as our children live very close.  One morning we burnt some toast in the oven's broiler so remarked to Christo that a toaster and a spatula would be helpful and on arriving home that evening, they were waiting for  us on the stairs.  He went out of his way to make us feel comfortable and welcome.  It was a wonderful stay and we will likely stay again when we return to Seattle."
3544964,16325702,2014-07-25,15258469,Sara,"Chris is a wonderful host! From the moment I arrived she made me feel right at home. The location is just a short walk to the Link railway that takes you right into downtown in about 20 to 25 mins, so for me it was perfect. Chris is so chatty and was very considerate to my needs, and I loved wondering around her garden! The room was very comfortable and cheery and was a pleasure to come back to in the evening after a long day of walking around the city. I left here feeling like i was leaving a friend. I would definitely consider staying here again."
3544964,16376449,2014-07-26,428977,Patrick,"Cris was a fantastic host and honestly, could not have been any more helpful.  She was very welcoming and kind, and was extremely responsive and attentive to all of my questions and needs both before and during my stay.  The room and bed were also very comfortable and I got a great night's sleep.  Highly recommend her and the place and would gladly return!"
3544964,16759369,2014-08-01,4468685,Andy,Good stay. Hospitable people and a clean house/room. Only negatives were that the bed was a little firm for my liking and that the neighborhood was confusing during the evening. 
3544964,17015661,2014-08-05,13378837,Trent,Cris's place was nice! The neighborhood wasn't amazing but it wasn't that bad either. It was a pretty short walk to the light rail and bus. Her dog was also really sweet!
3544964,17320816,2014-08-10,4374235,Solomon,It was great to stay at Cris house. The location of the house is just 10 minuets walking to the Light Rail. The room was clean and neat. Cris is a great host and helped me to know the restaurants nearby and how to go to downtown. Thanks Cris!
3544964,18901026,2014-09-02,16476530,Tobias,"I put my family members up (a couple in their 50s) up with Cris and her husband, and right of the bat, they all had a great connection. Drinks and food in the kitchen came complimentary with the room and the guests could enjoy a guest bathroom.

They still keep talking about the way in which staying with Cris made their trip so much better. Thank you for that!


For people looking to book: right between Othello and Columbia City light rail stations. # 8 bus runs right by.  It is not in the heart of the city, but conveniently located and easy to reach by public transportation.

Clear recommendation if being very close to downtown is not a high priority for you.

"
3544964,20210879,2014-09-25,5279919,Phillip,"Cris is a great host who is doing a very professional job. The house is clean, organized and amenities have easy access. Cris and husband share the common areas with guests, but it's fine since they are friendly. I'd recommend this place for a short or extended stay.
"
3544964,21013523,2014-10-09,21926025,Jacquie,"Cris and her husband were warm and friendly hosts. The room was as described and the minor issue with the TV channels were fixed before I returned from work by Dan (the manager) the next day. 

I'm glad I had a car, as the hill to get to the buses and/or light rail would have been a challenge. Cris watched a Seahawks game with me on the big TV in the living room, and though she didn't know a lot about the game, her enthusiasm for the Hawks to win was adorable. 

I was not aware that there are dogs living in the house (one belonging to the host and another with a guest), and would have liked to have known that prior to booking. 

Overall, it was a welcome respite during this time of transition in my life, and I hope to see Cris and her husband again in the future to thank them for their hospitality and kindness. "
3544964,34261960,2015-06-06,12086083,Steven,"Cris was great at responding to my late request to stay. The room was quiet, clean and comfortable and Cris was a terrific host. I was even given a lift from the light rail stop nearby so my rather tired, jet lagged body didn't have to cope with the walk. 
My main reason for the trip to Seattle was to visit the Boeing museum and while this was a great spot to stay for that purpose, the convenience of the light rail made getting into downtown really simple too. I would be happy to stay again if I return to Seattle."
3544964,34812563,2015-06-12,19753786,Cindy,Cris was the ideal hostess. Room was perfect. In fact the entire home and yard were fabulous. Super clean. Quiet. Her little dog fell in love with me cause I gave her popcorn. She was so generous. Coffee YUM! Parking was good. Neighborhood was safe. I would definitely stay here again. Their air conditioning was not good so if it is going to be hot in Seattle rethink your stay.
3544964,36902290,2015-07-02,34536739,Sarah,"I had a great experience staying here! I stayed for about a week and half when I first moved to Seattle for a new job. I was pretty blown out from the move and new job and it was wonderful to have such a welcoming and quiet home to come back to! Cris is extremely kind and a very welcoming host. They really have set up their home to make their guests feel as comfortable as possible, even if that just means giving them space. Cris gave me a tour right away and worked to make sure I felt at home. I would definitely stay here again!

        HIGHLIGHTS:
• The shared bathroom was very clean and right next to the room.
• They have coffee, croissants, and fruit available for you every day!
• She gave me fridge space and I was able to cook when I needed to.
• I was able to do laundry and the washer and dryer are new.
• You get your own room key and the house code when you arrive.
• There is filtered water in the kitchen.
• The bed was comfortable and the room was clean and exactly as shown (but with new comforter and sheets).
• There was always plenty of parking and easy Light Rail access.
• I was in Seattle during a heat wave and there is no AC in the house, but there was already a fan in the room and Cris brought me an extra one and checked in just to make sure I was comfortable!
• Cris has a little dog who is very sweet and quite smart. She might bark a bit when you first arrive but not in an excessive way and is very well behaved. I loved having her around!
• I think smoking is allowed on the porch and outside. So you might smell it a touch but I have asthma (and am quite sensitive) and it never bothered me once. Cris and guests are very considerate."
3544964,37244550,2015-07-05,22292622,Madeleine,"Staying with Cris and her husband was very nice, they were very welcoming and the room was nice. They also gave us nice advice on what to do in Seattle. The room doesn't have any aircondition though, so it was a bit hot. Buy a very nice stay and I would definetely recommend staying there!"
3544964,37515613,2015-07-07,15203157,Scott,"The room was great!  The room was very pleasant and the entire house (room, kitchen, bathroom, etc) was clean and neat.  Cris is extremely welcoming, helpful and has a very wonderful energy about her.  The train is an easy ten minute walk away, which takes you directly downtown.  Good location.
I was a really warm weekend to visit (mid 90s), however there were two fans provided and kept us quite cool through the night.
Would recommend staying with Cris!!
"
3544964,38309278,2015-07-14,36377838,Mary,"Thank you Cris for providing us with a great room for our trip.  Your hospitality and warm personality made us feel welcome; and we enjoyed your dog too! Bed very comfortable, space immaculately clean, quiet at night. It was perfect for us!
"
3544964,42544881,2015-08-14,34871635,Leonardo,"The room was fine, it's called sunset because the sun hits the window at sunset :D 

Cris is a great host, there are some included extras (like free coffee) that should be an example to other Airbnb's; also Cris is well organized and she will assign you an allocated space in the bathroom for your personal things and in the fridge or freezer.

I loved her dog Jening, it's lovely and well trained. 

Location is 10 minutes walking to the link station and 5 min to bus 36. If you are going to downtown at morning, its worth those extra 5 to catch the link and avoid traffic. Safeway is next to the station as well.

Nice place, nice host, just exactly what I expected :D"
3544964,42763381,2015-08-15,40427338,Jing,"Cris is a warm-hearted and charming lady. Her house is tidy and cozy, and her dog jennie is so cute! Apart from her house, the neighborhood is also quite, safe and clean. I thank her for holding us and truely mading us feel like home.  "
3544964,42914669,2015-08-16,27664727,Carly,"Chris and her husband, Raul, were awesome hosts! They were friendly and made us feel at home. The room and bathroom were clean and comfortable; exactly like the photos. 
The location was a short walk to the train, which made it easy to get around. Great experience!! "
3544964,43136618,2015-08-17,2613028,Autumn,We had a great experience here and would recommend it to anyone looking to stay in the Seattle area. The room and house were very welcoming and clean. 
3544964,43710602,2015-08-21,35238253,Minhee,"This place has been the most successful place ever since I started airbnb. Cris and her husband were so nice and friendly, and the room was perfect with tourist books and a map of neighborhood including markets and restaurants. They kindly answered whatever questions we asked. The room, kitchen, and bathroom were so clean, and well organized. I highly recommend this place. "
3544964,44342685,2015-08-25,39201324,Garrett,"Thanks for the great place to stay Cris! Everything was as described and the location is excellent. The walk to the train terminal was sub 10 minutes for me and it was easy to find, a short and easy 2 minute drive off of I-5. Cris is an excellent host and had a great little sheet with some helpful details about your stay, and some of the restaurants within walking distance. The bed was a little firm for my taste but some people might prefer that. Thanks again for the accomodations and hospitality. "
3544964,44791070,2015-08-29,30879010,Jessie,"I'm a traveller and have been to so many places around the (website hidden) one week stay in Cris and Raul's house is one of the best. Their house is super neat and cozy. Every small details can tell the host takes good care of their house and truly love their home.Plus, their lovely dog Jenning always kept me company. As host, Cris and Raul are very kind and considerate. We did have a good time sitting together and sharing our happy memories. So,the stay makes me feel like living at home with caring families, not just simple B&B.Thumbs up!Highly recommended."
3544964,48546318,2015-09-27,23051076,Jessica,"Cris and her husband made me feel very welcome. They are extremely accommodating. My room and bathroom were very clean when I arrived. I went in and out of the house freely, and parking was not an issue. There were always yummy pastries and coffee in the kitchen that were free to all guests. Cris and her husband were kind enough to cook for me when I was home, so I felt like I was staying with family. They were also very accommodating to guests that were visiting.  There are a lot of local eateries in the neighborhood that made getting food very convenient. The drive to seattle is less than 15 minutes. I would definitely recommend staying here if you plan on spending some time in seattle."
3544964,49408528,2015-10-03,3873269,Ruben,"Cris was great, had great conversations with her. She was flexible and helped with me checking in late. The house was in a prime location close to the freeway and public transport. The room was very comfortable and clean. Cris was a great host with a great room. "
3544964,50260176,2015-10-10,9406460,Michael,Cris was accommodating of my late arrival and early departure.  The home is nice and a great location for my early morning client.  I'd love to stay there whenever I visit.  Cris was gracious and welcoming.
3544964,51993142,2015-10-25,44378201,Aruni,Very comfortable and pleasant stay. Cris is very friendly and caring. i enjoyed my stay . Thanks for hosting me.

She is really nice!
A room is clearn.
"
3544964,56817708,2015-12-18,36234554,Mike,"The room and house were a great value and everything was accurate. Bathroom was clean and all details were covered regarding entry, wifi, etc. I was only there for just enough time to sleep, but they also offer a few basic food items for breakfast/coffee which was nice. I would recommend them for a stay."
3544964,57189294,2015-12-22,51739958,Andree Taryn,We felt very much at home! The hosts were very friendly and helpful :)
6555128,33759171,2015-05-31,6833914,Angela,"The apartment is bigger than shown in the pictures and very clean! It appeared that the building was undergoing renovations, but there wasn't any construction noise. The apartment wasn't really walking distance to anywhere other than the football field and the historic area of pioneer square. We chose to Uber everywhere as the city is quite large. The neighborhood was very safe despite the homeless camp nearby. Communication was very easy and I'd recommend this place to anyone staying in Seattle. "
6555128,33970761,2015-06-02,20560656,Rachael,"The apartment was a very nice place, clean, comfortable, and in a great central location for our quick one night stay in Seattle."
6555128,34258053,2015-06-06,3263402,Dave,Nice clean apartment in a good location. There's laundry in the building though I didn't use it and wifi and a roku. A bit sparsely furnished. I'd recommend this place. 
6555128,34364184,2015-06-07,14725908,Karina,"Kahyee's place looks exactly like the pictures and it was a great experience, clean and well-kept. He was easy to get a hold of and very accommodating during our trip. The apartment is close to 2 LINK stations and is right by Pioneer Square. Thanks, Kahyee! "
6555128,35139524,2015-06-15,33028602,Karla,"Kayhee's apartment was perfect for our short stay in seattle. It was very clean and centrally located to all the activities we were attending. This was our first experience with airbnb and it was a pleasant one. 
The only thing one might want to note is that the apartment does not have a/c and might feel a little hot in the summer especially if you are used to having it as we are being from Texas. Other than that it was perfect!"
6555128,35411501,2015-06-18,34863320,Adrian,The apartment was better than I hoped! Very clean and neat.
6555128,35750109,2015-06-21,36062425,Hayden,"Kahyee's apartment is very well located for walking or quick Uber rides across Seattle. It's clean, well-maintained, and quite spacious for a one-bedroom unit. Three friends and I stayed for a weekend and were very comfortable."
6555128,36126522,2015-06-25,12661822,Jim,"Kahyee provided all the necessities for a short stay in downtown Seattle. Could have used chairs instead of stools and a couch instead of a bean bag chair, but all in all, we were comfortable during the times we were in his place.  Able to walk to coffee in the morning, breakfast later near the waterfront and late-night dinner in downtown central.  The hills were a free upgrade to keep up on our exercise routines! We used Lyft to return late in the evening just to be on the safe side. Spent the day meandering through the close-at-hand waterfront and an evening at the Mariners game, which was a short walk south from the apt. Sweet time. Thanks, Kahee."
6555128,36563981,2015-06-29,34410964,Teddy,"Clean place, huge king bed. Comfort to stay. "
6555128,38181639,2015-07-13,1291672,Christopher,"The listing description and photos were very accurate. Kahyee sent me a document that had all the information I needed about staying in his place like how to get in, the WiFi info, etc. Picking up the keys was easy and done thru a service where you go to a cafe to pick them up. Leaving his place was quick and easy as well. I had a great time staying here. The apartment was only a short 1mi from Pike Place and the neighborhood felt safe. Parking was somewhat hard during the week, but on weekends it was easy. "
6555128,38923434,2015-07-19,27381713,Gerald,"Great location, and in a prime spot if you have plans in the International District, Pioneer Square (and the sports venues) and downtown Seattle - all are walking distance. The apartment is very clean, the king-sized bed is comfy, and a Roku is setup for some downtime entertainment. Definitely recommend for anyone visiting the city."
6555128,39580981,2015-07-24,39118089,Charles,Clean and well maintained. Easy to commute in city $5 uber to most places. Would stay there again for sure. 
6555128,39938999,2015-07-27,3275358,Jen,My husband and I spent 3 nights at Kayhee's place in late July and we had a great stay! Kayhee was really flexible about check in time and met us late at night to give us the keys. The location was perfect for us as we were attending a few baseball games. We also found we had no problem walking in to Pike place market and even walked to the clipper ferry terminal on our way home. The place was clean and exactly how pictured. We would definitely recommend and will definitely be back!
6555128,41762753,2015-08-09,35154742,Yifan,"Great convenient location, walkable to most things in the International District and Pioneer Square. The apartment was very comfortable, and everything was set up for us when we got there. Kahyee also responded really quickly to anything that came up too. "
6555128,42767429,2015-08-15,21727804,Megan,"Great place! Close to the highway for easy access to everything, clean place, comfy king-sized bed. Kayhee had very clear instructions for how to check in and out. He even accommodated our late evening arrival and arranged for me to pick up the keys through a key cafe. I'd definitely stay again!"
6555128,43416833,2015-08-19,39744504,Michelle,Thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Kayhee's place. Very clean and had basic amenities. Walking distance to some great restaurants in in international district and the docks. Would definitely stay again and recommend it to anyone.
6555128,43828251,2015-08-22,27672079,Brad,"Kahyee was very responsive to the issues that we had (we initially received the wrong set of keys, and we couldn't get the air mattress to get inflated or stay inflated), which I greatly appreciated.  

I think the apartment is designed to handle up to 2 people comfortably, so it felt tight for the 4 of us.  

I'm sorry to say that we didn't feel safe in the neighborhood -- there was a homeless camp nearby and my wife was followed very closely by a man as she tried to feed the parking meter and get back into the building one evening.  

On-street parking was unavailable during the week, and I just want to mention to others that the cheapest parking we found in the area is $22/day at the lot across the street (you can pay for only a half day at a time, so you need to feed the meter at 7AM and 5PM each day to avoid being ticketed/towed).  

For those who plan to walk around the area, we just wanted to mention that the building is at the top of a very steep hill.  Not a problem for us."
6555128,44087834,2015-08-23,42129428,Brandon,"Kahyee was an awesome host! We will definitely stay at his place again. Close to shopping, Pikes Market, Aquarium etc. thanks!"
6555128,45072802,2015-08-31,14208989,Alec,"My experience staying with Kahyee was fantastic. He sent me information a week or two before my stay that included detailed information regarding the apartment, parking, public transportation, and more. This was extremely valuable as I had only been in Seattle once before. 

The apartment itself was exactly what I needed for my stay, and Kahyee made my comfort a priority without being intrusive. Overall, Kahyee is a great host, and if I ever find myself back in Seattle, I'd be more than happy to stay at his apartment again. "
6555128,45642455,2015-09-04,43140559,Elly,"Although we didn't get to meet Kahyee, his email response was fast and he provided us with lots of information about the apartment. The listing was accurate and the neighborhood was good - close to the train station and Century Link Stadium. "
6555128,45891385,2015-09-06,21814148,Steve,Small cozy apartment close to the international district. We had a great time and we want to come back. The host responded to our questions very quickly.
6555128,48575300,2015-09-27,41185921,Arun,"Kahyee was very easy to communicate and finalizing the booking details. He even setup a work desk and chair for me since my stay was 3 weeks long and I was working remotely.

Features I liked in this place:
1. Kitchen already had all the things I needed for my stay.
2. Bed was comfortable for the 3 week (website hidden) was connected to Netflix for those lazy evenings.
4. I found free parking all the time I needed(weekends).
5. This place is walking distance to everything Seattle downtown has. I used to walk to 
      a. International District
      b. Downtown Seattle bars and clubs
      c. Pike Place Market and the 1st Starbucks
      d. 1st Ave - where all the restaurants are
6. $5 Uber took me to all the other places I needed to go
7. Amazon Prime Now - Delivered things to this place in less than 1 hour
8. Bathroom is decent size for a one bedroom place.

6555128,50406108,2015-10-11,14770836,Tarni,A very enjoyable stay. Kahyee was easy to communicate with and all went smoothly. Apartment was clean and tidy and a short walk to main areas of interest. We very much enjoyed our stay.
6555128,50893148,2015-10-15,26187005,Sam,"Kahyee's place was nice and clean, and looked like it had been recently remodeled. The bed was comfy, and the addition of the air mattress was convenient. Great location too.  "
6555128,51035387,2015-10-17,43817706,Zachary,"Kahyee was very accommodating, and more than willing to guide us through our first AirBnB experience. We had a ton of questions and he answered them all - without fail, and very promptly. His apartment was in a great spot (right near Centurylink and SafeCo!), clean, and well-kept. We had a great weekend in Seattle thanks to Kahyee, and we would definitely rent from him again. "
6555128,51876247,2015-10-24,7616247,Patrick,"Kahyee's place was a fantastic spot to stay in Seattle!
Walking distance to many places in the downtown area and Pioneer square, the apartment was clean and organized and Kahyee made getting the keys painless and simple. Would definitely stay here again. "
6555128,52023357,2015-10-25,43526083,Tyler,Great place to stay! The apartment was perfect and clean :) I would rent this place again!
6555128,52907654,2015-11-02,34825432,Taylor,Kahyee was a great host and helped answer any questions that I had. The spot was walking distance to many areas or a quick cab ride away. 
6555128,53433166,2015-11-08,32444676,Daniel,The room is very central and everything is clean.
6555128,55401467,2015-12-01,44379005,Mikyong,"Kahyee was very quick to respond to all my questions.  Because we checked in on Thanksgiving and the key service wasn't available, he even mailed the keys to us prior to our arrival.  The apartment is in Chinatown and there are a lot of homeless nearby, but we never had a problem because we used Uber most of the time.  The downside was that there were three of us and the air mattress didn't blow up all the way, so my sister slept on the bean bag.  The apartment wasn't vacuumed before we got there, so there was hair in the bathroom and the sheets and towels smelled of cigarette smoke.  Otherwise it was a good stay for the short time we were there."
6555128,57008409,2015-12-21,39982603,Anne,"The apartment was clean and comfortable, within walking distance of many places. Perfect for Seahawks game. Host responded to questions within minutes. We would stay here again."
6555128,57562508,2015-12-27,50230819,Jia Wei,Very comfortable apartment. Felt very homely. We had a family of 4 and it is definitely a great place. 5 minutes walk to the Link and 8 minutes to the Amtrak station. You can Uber to all major sights for less than $10. I would highly recommend this place!
7936712,44378451,2015-08-25,4655086,Ariana,"Beautiful condo, comfortable beds and lots of natural light. Fully equipped kitchen. Host was extremely responsive and easy to work with. Conveniently located near the park and bakery/coffee shop. Very happy with the property and will stay here again next time in Seattle. "
7936712,45332958,2015-09-01,8224812,Mark,"Jolanta was very welcoming and easy to work with.  When we had questions she responded quickly.  The apartment is very nice and comfortable.  While the location isn't really central, it is very easy to get to by car or bus and near a lot of conveniences such as U-Village shopping center and a deli/coffee shop on the corner.  The park across the street is nice and easily accessible.  The covered parking was nice to have in rainy weather, though the spot was a little tight.  We would happily stay there again.  "
7936712,45618495,2015-09-04,11754916,Caitlin,"It was a dream! Spotless and chic with huge windows and tons of room and walking distance to the cutest bakery and beautiful walking trails at the U of W. Jolanta was friendly, attentive and so sweet. Next time I'm back in Seattle, I know where I will be staying!"
7936712,46032207,2015-09-07,25563162,Jay,"We had a wonderful experience staying at the Magnuson Park Condominium.  Jolanta was very attentive and welcoming.  The condo was very clean, comfortable and spacious.  Just perfect for my needs."
7936712,46522689,2015-09-11,42538987,Anirudh,"We had a great experience - beautiful apartment in a lovely neighborhood, with a very responsive host. Would definitely recommend!"
7936712,48741308,2015-09-28,42340015,Hua,"Jolanta is really a wonderful host. She's very kind and passion!! 

As we are four girls with poor English ability, but she is patient and helping us step by step through each of our question. 

Her condo is very comfortable, clean and well prepared. Supermarket is also close to it and we can get everything we need for our daily use easily. 

If we have another chance to go Seattle again, I'll definitely choose Jolanta's condo to stay! Moreover, she drives us to the airport by her big toy Hammer 2!! 

Jolanta's condo is really your best choice when staying in Seattle! We have very good experience for the past three weeks! Thanks so much Jokanta~~"
7936712,49379168,2015-10-03,42263861,Jose,good place to be !! 
7936712,55355420,2015-12-01,6787375,Nicole,"This is a great space!  Really well done up for Air BnB guests, and Jolanta the host could not have been more accommodating.  We had an extended stay here, and we truly could not have asked for a better scenario for ourselves.   The Burke-Gilman trail is literally right behind the Condo complex, and Warren Magnuson Park is walkable as well.  (Which is right on the water.)  The exceptionally almost floor to ceiling windows allow for an amazing view overlooking Sandpoint way.  (And don't worry no one is opposite you looking in.  The inside of the condo looks freshly remodeled and whether or not it was, it does feel that way, which is nice.

This is a no brainer - great place to stay.  Cheers, Nicole"
7936712,55825726,2015-12-06,11731333,Erin,"Listing was as described in a charming walkable neighborhood.  Beautiful, clean, comfortable, and very safe.  Jolanta was attentive and detail-oriented.  I had a great experience and will definitely use this place again should the opportunity arise.  Thank you!  "
7936712,56784154,2015-12-18,29130589,Scott,"A fabulous place to stay!  This Magnuson Park condo was a perfect place for me to stay for a week of work in the area.  It was clean, comfortable, well decorated, and in a safe area.  The kitchen is appointed with all of the dishes and cookware that one might need.  Jolanta’s communications were clear and very welcoming.  I will be staying again!"
7936712,57133283,2015-12-22,47036680,Ann,"The house is clean and cozy. It is a little bit hard to find at first, but some very friendly neighbor help us find the house. The house is same as the pictures, and very homy.I definitely love the house and Jolanta is very helpful and sweet. It is unfortunately we don't have a chance to meet her, but she is definitely a nice woman. We enjoy our stay very much. "
8012443,45023886,2015-08-30,42434797,Julie,"Great location, responsive host.  "
8012443,45631033,2015-09-04,42913400,Xinyue,"特别棒！！我来西雅图的前一天定下来的，当时选是因为价格在西雅图算便宜的，但是环境真的特别好，房子特别漂亮和干净，房东人也超级好，去机场接了我、还给我下了饺子吃。地理位置也很好！小区很安静，门口不远游有巴士站很快就到市中心。强烈推荐！！中国人来旅游的话来这住就对了！

It's an awesome experience!! The room is super clean and comfortable. The neighborhood is quiet and clean. It's close to the bus station and easy to go to downtown. Btw, Matt is really really nice and responsible, with a cute dog, Louis. Strongly recommended!!!!!"
8012443,46424893,2015-09-10,42722267,Katherine,"I lucked out when I picked place (SuiteLouis--the owner, Matt Luu,  has named it after his dog, Louis). I'd never used Air BnB before, but couldn't find a hotel in west Seattle, near my son's home, that had vacancies. So I took a chance. This turns out to be a very nice three-story town house in a new development. It was very clean, and nicely decorated. It was so quiet I overslept the first day--I woke up at 10:00 thinking it was 8:00!  I had the entire first floor to myself---there was a bedroom with a small refrigerator, hangers in the closet, extra towels, and my own bathroom. On the second floor is a kitchen (Matt has stocked a few snacks) and a living room that are both available for guests' use.  There's a second guest room on the third floor, as well as a washer and dryer. The owner was very welcoming, even though I got lost and got there late. I was one of the first guests to stay here, and apparently benefited from some kind of introductory rate, which was an added bonus!   A lovely place, and perfect for people visiting west Seattle or the Delridge neighborhood. "
8012443,46847959,2015-09-13,27232751,Alice,"I needed a place to stay in Seattle for a night during a last minute trip. The room and bathroom were both very clean and and the bed was comfortable. Matt was also very responsive. Overall, it was a great experience."
8012443,51859014,2015-10-24,37633265,Amy,"Matt and Amanda were very welcoming hosts and Louis was such a sweet little guy too. Their place was very clean and comfortable, with great attention to detail and small extras like snacks. There was great lighting in the room from the big windows, and we could control the temp with in-room thermostat, which was perfect. We had our own car, and it was only a 15-25 minute drive to downtown Seattle (depending on traffic) and easy to find and get around. Matt and Amanda have really thought about all the little details to make our stay enjoyable and we had zero issues from the moment we arrived to when we left SuiteLouis!"
8012443,52174051,2015-10-26,25581754,Chan,"Can't expect more welcoming and helpful hosts than Matt and Amanda - speaking from my own experience all over the places! They really made out of their way to make me feel home, at the same time, left me with enough space and privacy. Special thanks for the weekend tour and the stop at C&P - totally warmed up the raining day. Bathroom is 5-star hotel standard and living room is more than beautiful - overall made my stay in Seattle lovely and memorable. Last but not least, Louis is the coolest dog, only wish I got the chance to read his mind! "
8012443,52945517,2015-11-02,30131143,Jamie,"Our second stay here and everything was just as great! We also had a bit more free time to interact with Matt and his wife, and also play with Louis! Sorry if we depleted a lot of the candy stash:)"
8012443,53151486,2015-11-05,18971239,Emily,"What a wonderful stay! Matt and Amanda were great hosts and very kind and responsive, their dog Louis is an absolute cutie. Lovely clean room with a great bathroom in a really nice neighbourhood. About 10-12 minutes drive into Seattle which was perfect for us. We would come back and stay again if we are ever in the area. Thanks for a great stay!"
8012443,53315063,2015-11-07,11670179,Julie,Great room!  Exactly as pictured.  Super comfortable bed!  Easy in and out.  Perfect communication.  Loved that the suite is named after the dogs and that many of the details reflect that.  Matt has put a lot of thought into hosting.  Great location - not far from downtown or the airport.  Would definitely stay again!
8012443,53921570,2015-11-14,48017688,Melinda,"Matt is a very nice host, thanks Matt for picking us up in the airport and driving us to dinner.
The house is delicate and clean. We enjoyed the stay very much."
8012443,54414974,2015-11-19,47875306,Jenny,"Matt and Amanda are the best host we have ever met! They are so attentive, welcoming, helpful and super awesome! We got some troubles on the way to their house and they tried their very best to help us without any hesitation. They invited us to join their tea time and made us feel like at home. The room is like 5 stars hotel, beautifully decorated and fully equipped, especially the bathroom, so bright and clean. We never stayed in such a clean and tidy bathroom. Matt and Amanda's hospitality and fantastic house will definitely be the reason we will come back to visit Seattle again! "
1100686,13312933,2014-05-25,1971733,Caroline,"We loved our spacious tree-top room!  And that's exactly what it is!  We live just a mere four blocks away, renting out our house and taking a stay-cation.  Going to Ann's place was like walking into a forest: tall trees, a street without right away so no cars, and a wonderful back yard.  Our room and bathroom were great, and Ann herself is very interesting to talk to, attentive but not intrusive.  We plan to go back!"
1100686,14165863,2014-06-13,16089455,Peter,Ann was very helpful and her place was very nice with a super comfortable room and bed. Very relaxing to stay there and hope to return. Thanks! 
1100686,15283168,2014-07-06,5302373,Lorenzo,Ann was pleasant and it was easy to live in her house. My daughter and I felt that we were in our own world enjoying Ann's house and Seattle at the same time!
1100686,15596022,2014-07-12,17108830,Ariel,"Ann was extremely responsive through the reservation process. Once I arrived in Seattle, there was some last minute coordination, and a little bit of confusion, around my reservation; once again, Ann made every effort to communicate and remain flexible. 

The room itself was wonderful. Large windows overlooked the front garden and a lightly traveled gravel road; I left them open for the duration of my trip, as it was extremely peaceful. 

The neighborhood is also great. Just up the street, there was Lighthouse Roaster, an amazing little coffee house. They serve the best espresso based drinks I've had in a long time. These folks know how to foam milk.

Ann graciously presented me a chocolate bar from Theo; a chocolate factory in the neighborhood - wow oh wow. 

Overall, it was a wonderful experience in a great neighborhood with a gracious host. I would happily return.  "
1100686,15878632,2014-07-17,8989404,Matthew And Mary,"Ann was an excellent host who ensured that our check in went smoothly. She gave us good advice about how to reach her house using public transport and plenty of ideas about what to see and do. Her home is in a lovely quiet neighberhood not far from interesting cafes and restaurants. It had good transport connections, only 15-20mins from Seattle downtown by regular buses. It was even closer to the Chihuly gallery and garden which is a must do for any visit to Seattle. We had an early ferry out of Seattle and Ann even got up early to drive us to the dock. We recommend Ann as a host."
1100686,16129407,2014-07-22,17411602,David,"We had a great stay at Ann's lovely home.  She was very warm, welcoming, and accommodating.  The bed was very comfortable, the bedroom was spacious and private.  Everything was clean and tidy.  The house is tucked away in the trees in the funky Fremont neighborhood.  Check out the nearby statues of Lenin the Russian Revolutionary and a giant troll, quite amusing.  We could not have had a better time."
1100686,16777290,2014-08-02,8708580,Lily,My second stay with Ann in Fremont was just a great as the first! I hope to be back again soon. 
1100686,17157272,2014-08-08,5107757,Sheli,"Ann was a superb hostess, and her house was a welcoming, beautiful retreat.  She tolerated us coming back unexpectedly mid day to rest after touring around and walking up and down Fremont's steep sidewalks.  The location is a short walk to lots of fun shops and eateries, plus easy bus rides to downtown, the zoo, etc.  The views from the every window are lovely and scenic, with inviting little garden spaces and huge evergreen trees presiding over the place.  We hope to stay with Ann again next time we visit relatives in Seattle! "
1100686,17303513,2014-08-10,2911278,Ashley,"Ann was super nice and in a great location, the ONLY thing I wish we would have known is that the bathroom wasn't private. Maybe I didn't read the listing correctly, but there was a room across the hall and one morning my friend and I got up to get ready and someone was in there-for a while--never saw the other people except once I think, (but I think there were various people staying throughout the weekend), but the house is lovely and convenient to cool neighborhoods-ballard and fremont, if you like that kind of thing when you travel. I did accidentally burn her rug (which I will totally replace) with my curling iron apparently, but easy to work with."
1100686,17535121,2014-08-13,16595846,Johnathon,Ann is probably the best Airbnb host I've had so far. She is very welcoming and incredibly friendly. I hope to be able to stay in her beautiful house whenever I come back to Seattle!
1100686,17655145,2014-08-15,17693578,Sarah,"Ann's place was AMAZING!  This was our first airbnb experience and I have a feeling we were very spoiled!  Ann was a great host; she explained everything right when we got there and even put out brochures and magazines about the area for us!  She really goes out of her way to make you feel welcome and wants you to have a great experience.
The bedroom is reallynice and has THE most comfortable bed!!  If also had a big window that opens out on to the front garden with two big, tall trees.  It really does have a treehouse type feel to it and with the sound of the rain it was a completely wonderful place to retreat to after a day in the city.  
Speaking of the city , the house is very accessible via public transit.  There are multiple options for buses you can take to get downtown and you just get on one bus and it's a straight shot downtown.  I would encourage you, however, to check out her wonderful neighborhood of Fremont before venturing into downtown seattle as there are lots of delicious cafés, cute and independently owned shops, not to mention an awesome music store  called Dusty Strings.  If you are a foodie or on a special diet, there are numerous options including the flying apron vegan, gluten free bakery which is a 13 min walk from the house.  Also her kitchen is beautiful and large, fully equipped with cookware, making it very easy to cook your own meals during your stay.

If you couldn't already tell, I would highly recommend staying here if you're looking for an airbnb in Seattle!  I will definitely try to stay here gain next time I'm in seattle!

1100686,18129206,2014-08-22,13049873,Margherita,"Ann has been an amazing host. First thing we get once in the appartament was a chocolate bar from a locale producer, the room was just amazing, the shower was the perfect size and there was a well equiped kitchen."
1100686,18268135,2014-08-24,5833898,Matthew,"Ann had a quirky house in the middle of a wooded area in Fremont. I liked the eclectic decorations of the house. The bed was comfortable. Room was just a little grungy--could use some sweeping/vacuuming under the bed. Also, there was a spider in my bed, which freaked me out, but it's cool, I got over it. I really enjoyed sleeping with the window open. Ann was nice and communicated well throughout my trip."
1100686,18453010,2014-08-26,20267516,Kimberly,Ann was very accommodating when I called and asked to check in early.  She showed me around her beautiful home and made me feel immediately welcome.  Ann asked which areas I was interested in visiting and promptly produced maps and advice on the best routes considering there was some major road construction going on!  The bed was coooozy!  Fresh flowers and chocolate made it extra special.  Ann even provided an extra twin bed for my son.  He loved the house and was very appreciative of the abundance of art and overall warmth. Kitchen was nicely appointed and I liked that there is storage provided for guests in the refrigerator and drawers.  Great coffee and conversation as well! 
1100686,18658418,2014-08-30,12444984,Laura,"We spent 5 very pleasant days in Ann's house, which is a very quiet and peaceful place. Ann is also a very nice host."
1100686,18809173,2014-09-01,18688116,Kathleen,great!
1100686,19155400,2014-09-07,20364721,Felix,"Ann is a very welcoming and warm host.  Upon arrival, she took the time to show us her house and to get us oriented with the Fremont neighborhood.  Her place is clean and the kitchen (though we never used it) is spacious with modern appliances.  Her house is in a quiet neighborhood with very little traffic noise.  The Fremont area is only a 10 min walk from her place."
1100686,19446192,2014-09-12,1235086,Scott,Lovely home. Gracious host. 
1100686,20097411,2014-09-23,19721287,Jennifer,"Because she was to be away for my arrival Ann went to great lengths to ensure someone else had all the instructions to make my arrival easy.
The house is exactly as described, the room delightful and the fresh flowers a very thoughtful touch. It's very conveniently located.
Ann was very warm and welcoming.
I will definitely book again."
1100686,21352547,2014-10-15,7833126,Lynne,"Ann contacted me as soon as the reservation was confirmed and the communication remained excellent. Our flight was late and that was not a problem.  Due to delays the flight was even later.  Ann was gracious about it all.  Her directions are excellent and we had no problem finding her house, even in the dark.
Ann's home is welcoming and comfortable and the room was clean and inviting. I had never shared a bathroom and was a little nervous about that part of the rental.  It was not a problem.  The young men in the other room were thoughtful about sharing.  They left the bathroom clean and were quickly in and out.  Sharing was not a problem.
Ann answered questions about the area and was very friendly. Her home is everything advertised. She had a wonderful place to curl up with a book inside.  One evening we enjoyed a cookout with our son using the fire pit.  Ann helped us get ready for the fire and supplied the dry wood. She went out of her way to facilitate a marvelous evening.
The room we stayed in was a large room with a couple of chairs and a dresser in addition to the bed.  Ann supplied each of us with a bath towel, hand towel, and wash rag when we arrived.  She showed us where extra towels were in case we needed one. The bed was comfortable with soft sheets and a cozy comforter. The curtains really shut out the light so the room  was nice and dark when we were sleeping. In the bathroom there was a basket so each room could leave a few toiletries, if desired.
Freemont is a 7 minute walk away.  The walk there is easy because it is all downhill.  However, the walk back is a little more difficult because it is up a very steep hill.  Freemont is a wonderful neighborhood.  It is also an easy walk to parts of Queen Anne.  We never went into downtown Seattle.
This was a wonderful trip and Ann, and her lovely home, made it more so. If you are traveling to Seattle this is a wonderful place to stay."
1100686,21552860,2014-10-19,595144,Jose,This is an amazing place with an amazing host.... the room was nice with a beautiful view and very comfortable bed. The house is charming and it feels like you are in the middle of an island full of trees and lots of interesting art. Strongly recommend.
1100686,22005546,2014-10-27,10318357,Rachel,"We stayed at Ann's wonderfully presented and located home for three nights and absolutely loved our stay there. Having moved to Fremont from the bustling Capitol Hill, Ann's home in this friendly neighbourhood felt like a country retreat... Even though it was just a couple of minutes from a huge number of bars, restaurants and cafés! Ann herself was a pleasure to be around and was really interesting to talk to. I would certainly recommend staying with her and advise anyone who hasn't to check out this great part of Seattle. "
1100686,22737462,2014-11-13,19721287,Jennifer,"Ann is very welcoming with fresh flowers and Theo's fair trade organic chocolate:)
The bed is extremely comfortable and the room very cosy. I like the privacy but also the warmth when we're in contact and the introductions to other guests.
"
1100686,23305228,2014-11-28,23675573,Caroline,"Ann was a wonderful, friendly hostess. The room was ready, cozy and warm when I arrived. Although I did not spend a lot of time there, access was easy, the home was very privately situated and comfortable. I would definitely stay there again."
1100686,24301340,2014-12-25,19436481,Lin,"Ann is a respectful and responsible host. I arrived early the first day before the room is ready. Ann drived me to a nearby coffee shop, where I could have a cup of coffee and surf on the Internet, and then picked me up to her home.  She also offered to pass my mail to my new address after I moved out. It is a lovely house, locating in the upper hill of Fremont. The room is comfortable and the bed is cozy. We can also cook Chinese food in her kitchen which is installed with gas oven. The neighbourhood is quiet with fresher than in the downtown. The location is within walking distance to the office of Google, Facebook, and Adobe, and there are buses (40, 26, 28, etc.) to downtown Seattle."
1100686,25583665,2015-01-19,15444882,Sherri,"Ann's got THE most comfortable airbnb bed I've experienced so far!  The room was clean and cozy, the setting, woodsy even tho we were in Seattle."
1100686,26140974,2015-02-04,24704989,David,"Note that this review is for the combined 2 stays, which I stayed at her place from Dec 27-Feb 4. I was actually quite impressed that she offered to pick me up from the airport, which was a late night flight. Ann was an extremely gracious host who was great at helping me transition as I relocated to Seattle for work. She is actually flexible, trustworthy, accommodating, and a very cool person. I will definitely maintain communication with her after staying at here place. The location was great in terms of discovering Fremont and the short commute I would have to my office until I found my own place. In regards to any potential discrepancies, everything was handled perfectly. My length of stay speaks to how comfortable I felt there, and to her outstanding flexibility on letting me stay a bit longer until my apartment was ready to move into. "
1100686,27612095,2015-03-08,3650433,Matt,"Anne is a great host and made sure my stay was a great one!
This room is perfect. It's a few minutes walk from all the neat parts of Fremont as well as numerous busses that can quickly fairy you to Downtown or elsewhere in Seattle -- and when you're done with your day, the bed is very comfortable. "
1100686,27797506,2015-03-12,11883288,Josh,"Ann's home is tucked away in a beautiful part of Seattle's Fremont neighborhood. It's only about 2-3 blocks away from the main hub of activity, where there are several great places to explore and grab food/drinks. The house itself is quaint, artsy, and homey. Our room upstairs was spacious and comfortable, with a large bed and a window that let in the natural morning light. Ann herself was a gracious host, providing us with breakfast and treats, and even went as far as leaving us a bottle of wine. She is a great resource for things to do around the city and within the neighborhood and provided us with some great places to eat. I would highly recommend staying at Ann's place."
1100686,28087851,2015-03-17,887083,Virginia,"Ann's home was a delightful place to stay while I was taking a  class in Seattle. I was made to feel welcome from the beginning. The bed and room were very comfortable and there was plenty of room in the kitchen for food that I brought and cooking. On a personal level, I really enjoyed meeting Ann. She was very respectful of me and my space, and at the same time, when we did have time for conversation it was most delightful. Her home is in Fremont, a wonderful part of Seattle. There's a real neighborhood feeling with all kinds of interesting shops and restaurants. I would not hesitate to recommend staying with Ann. "
1100686,28482901,2015-03-24,24585379,Aron,"The location of the apartment is very good. You are downtown by bus within 15 min, however there is piece and quiet in Fremont. Unfortunately we were there during a rainy time but it must be very nice in summer with the garden which you're also allowed to use. 
Ann is a nice host who provided us with contacts to many interesting people. "
1100686,28585839,2015-03-26,2085733,Danielle,"It was a pleasure staying with Ann, who welcomed us and provided us with a safe, quiet place to stay in a nice neighborhood. Although her house was on a hill, it was not a difficult walk and it was relatively easy to get to public transit. We could tell that Ann took pride in her listing and her home. She was a very kind person and seemed prepared for our stay; overall a pleasant experience!"
1100686,28891231,2015-03-31,23523493,Alice,Ann is a warming host who likes to share what she knows of Seattle. Getting to the house was a bit tricky but she took the time to give directions on the phone. The house is lovely and the location is at a fair distance (5min by walking) from the main streets of Fremont and bus stops to Downtown. We really appreciated the snacks and Theo chocolate she left for us. I would highly recommend staying at her place.
1100686,32110696,2015-05-14,27878281,Katrina,"Både huset og værelset passede rigtig fint på beskrivelsen. Værelset var behageligt, lyst, enkelt og pænt indrettet. Huset var virkelig charmerende og fint med en skøn have. Fint badeværelse og godt køkken med spisestue. Ann var en sød og hjælpsom vært. Ved ankomst hentede hun mig ved bussen og ved afrejse kørte hun mig endda helt til lufthavnen med mine store kufferter! Ann var en sød og hjælpsom vært og tog mig med til flere kunst/design arrangementer mv. hvilket var dejligt. Lokaliteten var super fin - stille, grønt med kig ud over byen, samtidig med at det var i gå kort afstand til Fremont bydelen (stemning, cafeer, indkøb, kanal, marked, mv). Jeg vil klart anbefale denne bolig og vært, også til længere ophold."
1100686,35065435,2015-06-15,27417481,Johannes,Ann is a wonderful person with a very nice house and garden. I felt home the first day and wish I could have stayed longer. Everything is as advertised in the description.
1100686,35413322,2015-06-18,18175530,Jaclyn,"Ann was wonderful! She greeted us when we arrived and showed us the room, which was really great and accommodated us very well. (The beds were quite comfortable.) The location was very convenient as well. Right near Fremont Ave. where all the shops and restaurants are and no more than a 15 minute drive to the destinations I wanted to check out. The driveway to the house was a bit confusing, but other than that, we had a lovely time! Thank you so much, Ann!"
1100686,35909917,2015-06-23,28774508,Joseph,"This was my first time using Airbnb, and Ann was a GREAT hostess.  She was welcoming an immediately showed me all the fantastic amenities of staying here.  The room was very comfortable, clean, roomy and with a big open window.  It's in a quiet neighborhood, but close enough to walk to a ton of activities in Fremont.  Awesome experience, thank you Ann."
1100686,36373745,2015-06-28,2045752,Julia,"Staying with Ann was exactly why we use airbnb and why we prefer staying with people/owners for the true airbnb experience. We were very jet lagged when we arrived at Ann's. Her place was comfortable, relaxed, the bed was comfy, had a great shower and was Ann was very warm and welcoming. The perfect place to get over jet lag. We didn't see Ann as much as we would have liked because we wanted to maximise our time seeing Seattle. On the morning we were leaving we discovered our hire car had no gas so the wonderful Ann drove to the gas station to get us some. We are so grateful for her generosity. Thanks Ann and we highly recommend staying at her lovely house in Fremont.
"
1100686,36812259,2015-07-01,35660990,Maribel,"Ann was very welcoming and accommodated for my boyfriend and I when we arrived a little bit earlier for check-in.  The weather was super warm during our stay, but she had the fan on to make our room more comfortable upon arrival and provided us with extra flat sheets which came in handy during the night.  She also went as far as to provide us with a chocolate bar and put out a fresh vase of flowers in the room.  The listing description is accurate and I like how the home is pretty much on a secluded, private hilltop area.  The location is pretty much close to everything/everywhere you want to go around Seattle.  I would highly suggest this listing and would consider staying again if I ever returned.  Thanks, Ann!"
1100686,37321769,2015-07-06,33323634,Celia,"Ann made our family feel like home at her place. She was very kind to us all the time and provided us useful information around the area.  She also shared her tips of seeing the 4th of July fireworks display! We had such great experience staying in her place! Forgot to mention that she also left us a tasty chocolate as a welcoming gift!! Thank you, Ann! :)  "
1100686,37746611,2015-07-10,32526252,Bonnie,Staying at Ann's home was a real treat. It was a beautiful view of the city of Seattle. Location is great. In 5 minutes walk you are at a bus stop to take you downtown in 20 mins or explore the ever-so-cute town of Fremont. It is clean with lots of room for good-book reading. There is always coffee and tea for making. Would stay again. 
1100686,38392653,2015-07-15,4586780,Marla,"Ann was a great hostess and her house was the perfect home base to explore Seattle! It was our first time to the city and Ann was very welcoming and offered lots of great tips and suggestions of things to do. Fremont is a fun neighborhood and it's also very accessible to walk or take a bus to surrounding neighborhoods. The room was comfortable to relax in at the end of the day, and the rest of the house was lovely too - nice kitchen and balcony that we used to enjoy a dinner and breakfast! Ann makes sure her guests feel at home and we definitely did for our few days in Seattle. Thank you, Ann!"
1100686,38720357,2015-07-18,21231352,Jody,"My experience at Ann's home was wonderful.  She greeted us warmly when we arrived and made us feel welcome immediately.  The house and grounds were amazing.  Our room was very comfortable.  Ann went out of her way to make sure that we had everything we needed. I especially loved her outside deck which had a beautiful view of her garden and Mt Rainier.  We were able to walk to coffee shops, the Burke Gillman trail and other quaint shops.    Thank you Ann...we enjoyed our stay and your hospitality very much...:) "
1100686,39189865,2015-07-21,5628465,Ingrid,"We felt very comfortable at Ann'a beautiful, artsy house. We ate all of our meals out on the balcony looking towards the Fremont bridge and Mt. Ranier. The garden was nicely shaded, so when it was hot we had a cool place to sit outside. The bedroom was quite comfortable with lots of space. Ann was very willing to help us with our plans. Her house is situated on a hill with interesting shops and restaurants near by. "
1100686,40907003,2015-08-03,21642033,Melissa,"Anne's house is beautiful and clean. There is such a great garden and patio to eat on. Her kitchen is very modern and she makes it so inviting to cook and keep your food in the fridge. She goes above and beyond in so many ways by providing many magazines, maps and guides. She even gave us a local chocolate bar! Her neighborhood is so so beautiful. It's only 2 blocks from so many great things you can walk everywhere and we took the bus very easily. Ann was very communicative and helpful. She was always checking to make sure we had everything we needed without being intrusive. We even had a parking spot in her driveway. We will stay here every time we come to Seattle, it's perfect! "
1100686,42655396,2015-08-15,29716023,Ing-Shouh,"Our family stayed at Ann's place for a week and we had wonderful time there. Ann was very warm and patient in communicating with us. Especially, English is not our native language and my wife and daughter were not good at speaking in English. She made our family feel like home. Ann's home is on a secluded, private hilltop area, but it is just a short work to Fremont center. We also liked walking around the neighborhood because it is quiet, beautiful, and full of good smell from the flowers grown in that area. There are several bus lines to go to different parts of Seattle. Ann gave us useful information about where to go in Seattle and we mainly used the buses to explore Seattle area. We even took a ferry to Bainbridge island and saw a wonderful night view of Seattle when we took the ferry back. We also walked to Greenlake from Ann's place. My wife and daughter paddled kayak for the first time. What a great experience we had in Seattle and we had great memory there. We enjoyed our time in Ann's place and will definitely come back again if we have time to visit Seattle again. Thanks, Ann!"
1100686,43225729,2015-08-18,33242648,Andrew,Ann was very accommodating and her home was extremely clean and cozy. This was me and my friends' first airbnb experience and we thoroughly enjoyed it!
1100686,43786199,2015-08-22,28541890,Kailin,"Ann is a fantastic host! Her lovely home is so clean and nicely decorated :) everything you need is readily available. Her kitchen is fully equipped with almost everything you need-asian sauces for cooking, chopstick etc! Ann is very independent and friendly and make us feel like home too! The toilet is so clean and the room is nicely decorated! She left many brochure in our room for us regarding Seattle as well! Highly recommended!"
1100686,44191624,2015-08-24,4664829,Katelyn,"Ann was a wonderful host! My boyfriend and I stayed at Ann's place for just a couple nights. Only positive things to report! The room was clean, comfortable and well-lit. We didn't get to interact with Ann much, as we were always on the go (Fremont is awesome!), but she was very hospitable and accommodating. We had a very early morning flight on our final day, and she left us homemade muffins (delicious), and an extra snack of fruit/nuts to tide us over on our travel day. An unexpected but welcome treat! 

Oh, and the complimentary coffee selection each morning was an added bonus. Would highly recommend a visit with Ann!"
1100686,44442476,2015-08-26,34387018,Angela,"Ann was a great host 
Very easy to talk to and accommodating 

Her place was really nice and clean (: "
1100686,44792696,2015-08-29,33865018,Angelica,This is a beautiful home with an artsy feel in a quiet nook in a funky and happening neighbourhood. Ann was friendly and even welcomed us with some lovely chocolates. 
1100686,45258886,2015-09-01,26757498,Brian,"Very hospitable. Great stay, Ann was very informative and helpful in navigating us through her beautiful home. We arrived late to her house at about 11pm and she went out of her way to help us find an eatery at that hour of the night. Overall a great stay, great view from the patio, great host! "
1100686,45660540,2015-09-05,21553564,Helga,"Wir haben vier Nächte bei Ann in Fremont verbracht. Es war einfach schön. Das Zimmer und das ganze Haus ist sehr liebevoll und künstlerisch eingerichtet. Die Küche ist sehr gut ausgestattet. Das Haus ist in einer ruhigen Wohnlage, aber doch nur ein paar Blocks von Restaurants und Geschäften entfernt. Es war genauso wie beschrieben und sehr sauber. Ann ist eine wunderbare, unkomplizierte Gastgeberin.  Sie hatte viele Tipps und Infomaterial für uns.
Wenn wir wieder nach Seattle kommen, werden wir sicher wieder bei Ann übernachten."
1100686,46161633,2015-09-08,40327850,Annie,Ann was very welcoming. When we arrived she gave us a little tour around her house. The house is surrounded by trees and beautiful scenery.  The flowers and chocolate were a nice bonus! 
1100686,46410434,2015-09-10,2282115,Kathy,"Ann's house is a great place—nice, clean, and quiet, yet close to the action in Fremont—and I hope to stay there again. My friend and I accidentally stayed in the other upstairs room (treetop and mountain views: (phone number hidden)); Ann offered to switch us if we wanted, but we were happy to stay put. I used the kitchen to cook dinner for one, and then ate on the back porch, with a view of Mt Rainier. Beautiful! Ann is easy going and flexible, and the chocolate and fresh flowers were nice touches.
"
1100686,47047947,2015-09-15,32235915,Jessica,"My first experience with air b and b was  wonderful thanks to Ann and her cozy home. Room was clean, spacious, and she even had pamphlets/ magazines about Fremont/ Seattle. We felt very welcome and extremely affordable! Close to the troll and downtown freemont which has a lot of restaurants / stores. I would definitely recommend this location to anyone looking to stay outside of the city but close enough by car (about 15 min)."
1100686,47743644,2015-09-21,41216602,Jennifer,"Ann is an amazing host.   Her home is tucked away in the midst of beautiful Evergreen trees and feels as if you are at a mountain retreat not in a large bustling city. It was the perfect getaway. I would absolutely book  again and I am hoping to go back in a few months.   The room was very clean and comfortable. The bed was perfect and I slept like a rock, normally away from home I don't sleep well.  Ann was available when I needed her and yet was very respectful of my privacy and space when I didn't.    "
1100686,49238946,2015-10-02,18897372,Aron,"Comfortable and great room as advertised, Ann was friendly and it was a nice place to stay, I would be happy to stay here again."
1100686,49522437,2015-10-04,292481,Barbara,"I loved staying with Ann. She is a very thoughtful host, and her home is artsy and comfortable. Great location, surrounded by trees and close to the Fremont district with its wonderful restaurants, coffee houses and more. "
1100686,50091489,2015-10-09,7477871,Pamela,"We don't travel a lot.  We like it at home, but being at Ann's was almost like being at home, only with the bonus of being in Seattle.  We felt so comfortable in her home.  She is there to offer help or not, whatever you want.  We asked for help often and got it. Sometimes we just sat and talked with Ann, who is a friendly and interesting person.  We mostly used public transportation and she helped us with that and with information about Fremont.  The neighborhood is very safe and tourist friendly - lots of restaurants, little boutiques, a cider bar, a wonderful gluten-free bakery, and a great co-op for finding organic and gluten free products.  The Turkish restaurant is great and has gluten-free and vegan dishes on offer.  The only less than ideal condition in Fremont is the hills - they are steep.  From Ann's you walk down into Fremont which is not a problem, but walking back up you will burn some calories.  Good thing the walk is short, between 5 and 10 minutes.  There were Car2Gos everywhere, so it would be no problem if you wanted to drive somewhere.  We had a great time, in large part because Ann is warm and generous and she offers her guests a comfortable, laid-back experience in Seattle.  "
1100686,50584374,2015-10-12,28254537,Stephanie,"My boyfriend and I stayed with Ann while we were in town for a wedding. The house is set in a beautiful and peaceful location, close to good restaurants and coffee shops. Ann was very welcoming and accommodating throughout our stay. We arrived late (past midnight) yet she waited for us, gave us a tour, and provided us with delicious chocolate. There were other Airbnb guests staying in the house at the same time, so you have to be mindful of noise level during quiet hours, and if you are staying in one of the two rooms upstairs, you will likely end up sharing a bathroom with other guests. This wasn't too much of a problem, and Ann stayed in communication with us to make sure all our needs were being met. We had everything we needed to get ready for the wedding (e.g., hair dryer, ironing board), and overall we really enjoyed our stay and would recommend this place to others!"
1100686,50794056,2015-10-14,25938008,Kata,"Ann was wonderful! She's a very kind and interesting person: She had everything prepared for us when we arrived and even baked us Muffins for when we left! The neighborhood is great (google Fremont, WA, and especially Lenin, the Fremont troll, and the local chocolate factory). Ann also has a lovely backyard, where she grows tomatoes. Altogether an excellent experience."
1100686,51169229,2015-10-18,43207631,Mary,"This was my first time using Air bnb and Ann's home was a great experience. It was a pleasant, clean, and inviting space. We weren't home much during the trip, but felt all the more welcome. Would visit again. 
"
1100686,51903795,2015-10-25,25698588,Linda,Host was great and accommodations as described.  Great location too!
1100686,53702462,2015-11-11,47055899,Jane,This was my family's first Airbnb experience. Ann met us on our arrival and show us all details for the facilities. The house is located in a very quite residence area and in the walking distance to interesting Fremont downtown. We enjoyed our stay in Ann's house. Thanks Ann for letting us use her wonderful place. Thanks Ann.
1100686,54475721,2015-11-20,44297400,Paul,"Ann's place is great - amazing location close to everything in Fremont, clean and warm house, and generous use of the kitchen for guests. The room is large, full of light, and has a very effective electric radiator for the cold nights. She is very friendly and easy to talk with, yet also respects the need to keep to one's self. You might even get sent away with a freshly baked muffin if you are lucky!"
1100686,54650999,2015-11-22,14254790,Corrie,"Ann is a lovely host. She made delicious cranberry and blueberry muffins for breakfast one morning and provided the recipe as well! Her house is beautiful, artsy, and in great walking location to everything in downtown Fremont. I would have stayed more nights if I could and will definitely stay with Ann again when I come back to town. Thank you!"
1100686,55368186,2015-12-01,29981070,Beverly,"We had a great time staying at Ann's home. We loved our room, the house, our comfy bed. Ann was most welcoming. She made the kitchen available and helped us out with things we needed. I even practiced on her piano one day when the  house was empty.
AA perfect visit and we would happily return again.
Bev and Sam"
1100686,55852039,2015-12-06,49994415,Tammy,"I cannot say enough about Ann and her charming hilltop home in Fremont.  I was attending a three day forum with very long hours so was absolutely exhausted when I'd return home each evening.  Ann was so warm and comforting and her home so peaceful, I immediatley felt connected and at ease.  This will definitely be an on-going ""respite house"" for me. 
You are the best Ann! 
Tammy.  "
1100686,56429615,2015-12-13,46026651,Jane,"The room was very comfortable and as described. We needed an extra bed, and the air bed was ready when we arrived. The neighborhood is nice and quiet."
1100686,56809943,2015-12-18,22568818,Paul,Ann made me feel very welcome. Her home has a warm and friendly atmosphere. I would recommend without hesitation. The local area is fun and quirky and this is a great location to explore Seattle.
1100686,57568485,2015-12-27,35097855,Barbara,"Wonderful, warm, welcoming, and a great host.  We enjoyed the vintage, restored, and refurbished house; very Seattle!  Kitchen was well organished and had everything needed.  Bedroom had all possible pillow and bedding needed for a cosy sleep and well lit.  It was December so indoor comfort was important; warm clothes for Seattle in the 40s outside, but comfy inside.  Ann is a grest host!  "
8652185,55021575,2015-11-27,38123253,Nancy,"This was a wonderful experience- the house was beautiful, warm, clean and had a very well stocked kitchen which made our family Thanksgiving work so well.  Daniel kept in communication every step of the way.   He actually text me from Europe- how amazing is that. 
The neighborhood felt very safe.  Couldn't ask for a better home or better host.  "
879181,3380005,2013-01-20,4719274,Kontien,Staying at Laura's home was really great! Everything was prepared and ready before I arrived. Her home is really clean and comfortable. Although I didn't get to meet Laura in person she was really nice through the sticky note messages! Thank you for the stay! :)
879181,3413746,2013-01-25,4730401,Dave,Laura has a great home in a nice location and is very accommodating to her guests. I had a nice time staying there and the facilities were good. Would go back if I were ever in Seattle.
879181,3597219,2013-02-20,4000345,Jonathan,"Laura was a great host. The place was kept extremely clean, and she maintained a very welcoming ""what's mine is yours"" mentality. Highly recommend"
879181,5790374,2013-07-16,926966,David,"Laura provided a very comfortable place to stay. Her home is clean, quiet and has everything you need.Her home is very near to a great neighborhood Starbucks, about 2 short blocks away. There is also a Walmart , grocery store and a superb little micro brewery close by. The excellent Seattle transit system has a stop right in front of Starbucks which gets you downtown in about 10 minutes and from there to anywhere in the city. I would gladly stay here again."
879181,6005784,2013-07-26,6947317,Bill,"My wife and I had a great stay at Laura's house while visiting our son. First of all, Laura is a fun energetic person who has a score of interests. We loved her. The house was wonderful being a beautiful little two story. We stayed in an upstairs bed room which had a super comfortable bed. The bathroom was across the hall. There is a half bathroom downstairs. The first floor has a complete kitchen, dining room and living room. There is a small back deck with comfy chairs for you to relax and enjoy the Seattle air. It looked like the house had recently been repainted, and along with the beautiful floors, everything was immaculate. The house itself is not far from China Town and a quick walk to bus stops that will take you all over Seattle. We used several different modes of transportation including bus, train, cab, ferry, & monorail. There is a drug store, grocery store, Quiznos, Subway and the most wonderful Starbucks all within a quick walk. Everyone in the neighborhood was very friendly. I hope Laura isn't booked up the next time we go to Seattle because we certainly plan to stay there again."
879181,6188204,2013-08-02,5947922,Kyra,Laura accepted my lastminute and offered me her couch. Thank you! !
879181,7042063,2013-09-04,5570129,Sean,Laura is a kind host that gave us plenty of privacy. The room we stayed in was quite large and comfortable with lots of space to spread out. Laura made us a healthy breakfast and made sure that our check in was completely smooth and trouble free even though she wasn't able to be to greet us personally. We would stay with Laura again.
879181,9098693,2013-12-07,7941332,Raphael,"Laura is a fantastic host. I felt completely at home during my stay in her house. She is a nice person to have a good conversation but if you are tired and want to rest alone, she totally respects you. 
Her house is comfortable and she allows you to use all things in the kitchen and do the laundry whenever you need.
Apart from that, Laura is absolutely human and friendly. She makes you feel the more comfortable as possible, and helps in every doubt that you may have (e.g. concerning things in the house, neighborhood or places to visit in Seattle).  
All I can say is that I am really glad that among so may options in Seattle I chose her house to stay for 3 months. Moreover, whenever I visit Seattle again in the future, I will look for Laura's house. "
879181,9221531,2013-12-14,5827021,Jefferson,"Laura and her place were great. The house is comfortable and convenient to downtown (an easy bus ride or a longish stroll). Laura was lovely and, for a special treat, prepared a tasty Christmas punch made from guavas, mandarins, sugar cane, ginger and other secret ingredients. Yummy. I'm sure she doesn't make Ponche all the time since it is a seasonal Mexican delicacy, but it was lovely of her to make a warm, sweet treat to take the edge of Seattle's December chill."
879181,9326863,2013-12-21,8001128,Rita,"Laura's house was lovely.   It was warm and cozy,  especially because it was so cold outside.   I arrived quite late and had to get up early at 0500 both days I was there.  I never actually met Laura, but there was a very hospitable young man also staying there. He made me feel welcomed and showed me around.  I would definitely recommend staying here."
879181,9655820,2014-01-04,10588917,Robin,"We felt really welcome and at home at Laura's place. She was very helpful and uncomplicated. Perfect location in Seattle, quite and close to Downtown. Her house is very clean, the kitchen well equipped and our room was really cozy. The only regret was that we did not have more time to talk with Laura!"
879181,11482052,2014-04-05,2981415,Helen,Great location and several bus stops a few steps outside the front door and available parking for my vehicle . I stayed with Laura for 3 months while working on contract for a hospital less than 2 miles away. It was a good experience and she is a kind and energetic host. I'd recommend Laura to others as her location is ideal for visiting downtown and many major tourist attractions. 
879181,11932954,2014-04-19,13822434,Andrew,This was my first airbnb experience and it was great! Laura was very accommodating and the room was very clean. The house is great! It is the perfect room and the location is in my opinion the most ideal. Thanks Laura!
879181,12616679,2014-05-06,13239250,David,"Hi,

The room and the home were adequate for my needs as I was out of the house early and came home late. Unfortunately I did not get to meet Laura and I would have liked to do this. A couple of things surprised me. I was expecting to be able to make a quick breakfast of cereal and milk with some fruit. A cup of tea. That sort of thing, but there was only a half loaf of white bread out on a table and some apples and a couple of bananas. Couldn't find any cereal or milk and generally felt there should have been some instructions regarding breakfast. I was only mildly inconvenienced here since I went to the place where I was gathering for the Cascadia Poetry Festival and had a cereal breakfast and tea there. 

One other unfortunate incident which could not be helped was the fact that the communal bathroom shower had leaked into the kitchen and as a result was not usable. I used the other ensuite shower in another room by invitation on one day, however on days when I had to leave early, I did not have a shower because no one else was awake. I did have a shower on the day I was leaving as the communal shower was repaired. But there were three mornings I had to go without a shower.

She had explained there were home repairs going on but she still provided a comfortable bedroom and shower facilities and offered to respond to anything else we needed.  She has a cozy and attractive home, reflecting her culture and personality, both of which are pleasant and vibrant.  Thank you, Laura!"
879181,14071838,2014-06-10,4274504,David,The reservation was canceled 14 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
879181,19864995,2014-09-20,13071218,Jason,"Laura is an amazing host. Although she was not present when I moved in, she made sure that I was properly taken care of. She is extremely nice and friendly. In the 3 months that I stayed at her place, I had no complaints. The description of her place is completely accurate and I just love her kitchen and the cleanliness of the house. The neighborhood was nice and quiet and conveniently located a block away from several major bus lines that can take you to anywhere you want in Seattle. Definitely recommend."
879181,21205924,2014-10-13,20125047,Kieran,"Very comfortable and clean accomodation in a fantastic location in Seattle. Laura was a wonderful, welcoming, generous host and made for a great stay. Thank you!"
879181,23761815,2014-12-09,18164184,John,"Laura was very nice. Her home is clean and in a quiet neighborhood. There are several major bus lines a block away, so it was fast and convenient to get to downtown and the airport. I would recommend Laura's home to a friend."
879181,24616531,2014-12-31,24897595,Stacy,"Laura's house is a quiet place, and you can find everything you need is nearby, such as supermarket, Starbucks, pharmacy store and bus stops. 

When i stayed there, I usually took a bus to DT, it is very convenient and  only took me around 15 mins.

in addition to the convenient location, Laura is a good host, if you need anything, just tell her. 

The bedroom and restroom are clean, therefore, I highly recommend Laura's place to anyone heading for Seattle.
"
879181,25428480,2015-01-15,24173690,Zachary,This was a great place to stay. The room was as described with plenty of comfortable bed space and great wifi! Laura is such a caring and thoughtful host. I went out a few nights and she told me to give her a call if I ran into any trouble. I would happily stay here again if I'm in the Seattle area. Plus it's only 10 minutes from downtown 
879181,25971495,2015-01-31,2515143,Brandon,"Laura is an excellent hostess!  Her home is beautiful and comfortable and has everything that you could need during a stay.  Laura is such a lovely, warm, and inviting person, and she very clearly wants you to enjoy your time in Seattle.

The location of the house is perfect.  It's an easy trip from the airport or main train station.  It's a short bus ride or walk to get to downtown or Capitol Hill, and of course the Central District is a great place in its own right.

I very much recommend staying with Laura while you're in Seattle!"
879181,34270822,2015-06-07,26168305,Beatriz,"Everything was perfect! Laura is a wonderful person with a really nice house. If you are looking for a place to stay stop searching, this is your place. Only 10 minutes by bus to the downtown, close markets..as I said perfect. I can only say Thank you so much for everything!! 
Gracias gracias gracias. Inmejorable sitio e inmejorable anfitriona. Nos vemos en España ;)"
879181,37287213,2015-07-06,2844209,Cathrina,"Laura was a great host; she immediately told me to make myself at home, and I felt completely free to use the shared living space, kitchen, and garden. This place is a good choice if you like to cook your meals, because her kitchen's fully stocked and there's room to prepare and store everything. 
As far as transportation goes, it was easy to get to the bus downtown (it's about a two block walk away), and also possible to walk there (though it can be quite a trek on a hot day). The street noise can be a bit loud at times, but there's nothing to be done about that, and it never kept me awake.
All in all, Laura is a wonderful, welcoming host, and the price is great!"
879181,41587545,2015-08-08,179356,Stone,"My wife and son had a very nice stay with Laura. Her place is close to the Library and Bus stop. There are also have grocery supermarket close by. My family felt safe the whole time. If we get to Seattle again we would consider staying with Laura again .
Michelle and Gin have returned to Taiwan yesterday.Gin said that he miss you very much.And thank you to take care of them during the period.
Best Regards.

879181,42292380,2015-08-12,18067227,Sydeaka,"The room was as described, in a quiet neighborhood that was very accessible to public transportation. I had no issues traveling to and from my conference everyday. I didn't interact with Laura much, which was great because I had more privacy. My only issue was that there was no wifi internet connection at any point during my stay, which was particularly problematic for me since I was looking forward to getting work done in the evenings after my conference. If internet service is a sticking point for you, you may want to contact her before booking the room to make sure that the internet works. Otherwise, I would stay there again. Great host. Thanks, Laura!"
879181,49673729,2015-10-05,44169785,Justin,We had a great stay with Laura!  The room was within walking distance to everything we wanted to see and was removed enough from the bustling part of the city to have a quiet evening once we left downtown.  
879181,50375011,2015-10-11,3656166,Brett,The listing was very accurate and the room was very clean and comfortable. I would definitely book with Laura again in the future.
879181,51172114,2015-10-18,29762012,Johanna,"This listing was everything it advertised and more! Laura was a gracious host, and the light breakfast she provided was excellent. Had an amazing time in Seattle!"
879181,52217893,2015-10-27,23971147,Josh,"Laura's home is very comfortable, full of stylish art from all over the world. Laura herself is a delight, and she added lots of touches to make me feel welcome: towels and soap ready for me, various snacks and coffee in the kitchen that I was welcome to use, and most of all, a good attitude. I arrived with a friend and her toddler, who promptly broke a small decorative object, and Laura was very understanding. Laura also has let me stay late on my last day, since my flight isn't until 2 am, which is very generous. I would recommend her to anyone looking for a kind and gracious host.

The neighborhood is decent, mostly residential. I was staying here because my friend lives nearby but didn't have space. There's a nearby grocery, bank, Walgreen's pharmacy, and good coffee place, so all your basics are easy to take care of within walking distance. Also some great nearby Ethiopian food at Chef Cafe. 

This was my first Airbnb experience, and it was good enough that I'm excited to meet more wonderful hosts in my travels! Thank you, Laura!"
879181,55123840,2015-11-28,47481074,Vegas,I had a great time staying with Laura. I would definitely recommend her airbnb and stay there again.

Thank you so much for a wonderful stay at your condo!  The condo was in a GREAT location and was equipped with EVERYTHING we needed for our stay.  It was nicely decorated, comfortable and was convenient to all of the sights, great restaurants and fun shopping. Sarah, Darik and Allen were incredible to work with and were extremely responsive both before and during our stay.  We would  book with them again anywhere they had a place to rent. Thank you so much for helping to make our first trip out to Seattle so memorable!!"
808134,11168552,2014-03-24,4758580,Maggie,"Really nice apartment! Everything was clean, accessible and really comfortable. Even the martini shaker in the cabinet is labeled. Very convenient to downtown and everything, right in belltown, and the building is plush. Nice swimming pool, hot tub, fitness room, etc. Right above the best bakery in seattle. And a cute little deck in the apartment. Easy checkin / checkout. Great value for the price! Would definitely stay here again and recommend highly."
808134,36134939,2015-06-25,23569153,Samuel,"Great location, situated in hipster Belltown, with amazing restaurants located in the complex.  The space was perfect for me and my family.  Enjoyed the patio overlooking the courtyard, and the amenities like the pool.  The apartment gets hot from the sun exposure, but there's a great air conditioning unit that quickly cools things down.  Loved the bakery located downstairs, as well as the sushi and italian restaurants on 2nd Ave."

The house's location is also really great. It is close to the bay, the Seattle Center park, and it is in the walking distance to Pike Place Market and Light Rail station. The neighborhood is pretty quiet and peaceful too. Definitely check it out when you visit Seattle!"
8843162,57814114,2015-12-29,13326226,Colin,"Room was very convenient to go from Pier 69 and there were a lot of shops and restaurants nearby. Did not really get a chance to interact much with Max as he had to leave for a flight the next day but the check-in was pretty easy. 

Absolutely loved the location as it is easy to walk everywhere.

6623079,37724101,2015-07-09,37910384,Colleen,Sofwa was very friendly.
6623079,37917663,2015-07-11,3532394,Priscilla,"Location was perfect for what I needed, a place to stay close to the university. Amenities were very basic but it comes with the price. However, arrival time could have been coordinated better as I had to wait for Sofwa for half an hour to let me in, and it was very late at night. I would have also appreciated if they kept the noise down in the  living room evening."
6623079,38082536,2015-07-12,3029106,Victoria,It was good.
6623079,38342530,2015-07-14,17112637,Janette,"Sofwa was very welcoming. She is a great communicator both in advance and during my stay. The room was very tidy and the bed comfortable. The location was great for me, right around the corner from the University of Washington specialty medical center."
6623079,38765620,2015-07-18,37506266,Lauren,"My friend and I came up to Seattle for a concert and just to visit for the first time. Sofwa was a great host and very welcoming!  She gave great directions and her apartment is near several bus stops so we never had to wait more than 10 minutes for  a bus.  The area is near campus so there was lots of options and it was also only a 15 minute walk to Gas Works park which we went to several times.  The beds were super comfortable and she even had a fan in case it was warm for us.  The bathroom was shared so we just had to communicate about schedules. Whenever she had company over, they were all very friendly and helpful as well.  She was very accommodating with our travel schedule and we had a great, hassle free time!"
6623079,39668463,2015-07-25,2788998,Reva,Sofwa was quite welcoming and helpful--she was accommodating to our late flight arrival and gave us advice on bus transportation and street parking.  The space was clean and the room/beds were comfortable.  Neighborhood was in the university area and felt pretty safe. I'd stay with Sofwa again.
6623079,39814884,2015-07-26,37376710,Dasha,Fantastic hostess! Me and my two friends stayed with her for a night and she was very gracious and flexible. She gave us tips about local places to visit and made us feel comfortable and safe. Would definitely reccomend!!
6623079,40251685,2015-07-29,26837899,Mary,"Sofwa was great. 
This is very simple bedroom, which is all I needed. She was very gracious. I had a wonderful stay. "
6623079,41995999,2015-08-10,16148675,Sovann,"Sofwa was a wonderful and very kind host. She was very communicative about the way we could arrive and when we had issues coming to terms with our arrival time, she turned out to be very flexible and helpful.

She gave us a lot of space, but made it very obvious that she was willing to help us get around and talking to her was a lot of fun as well. I actually fell sick during my stay with her and she even helped me get better.

The apt. is small, two bedrooms. The bedroom we stayed in had two beds, a desk and a closet, with enough space for both of us to hang our stuff in. The beds were comfortable and Sofwa even provided us with towels for the bathroom. 

It is really easy to get to her place and a bus stop is a minute down the road. I would stay with Sofwa anytime again!"

3921664,58682208,2016-01-03,51940463,Haley," We were welcomed by our friendly hosts, who were eager to give advice and suggestions, but also gave us our privacy. The neighborhood is charming, safe, near cafes and restaurants, walking distance to several parks, and a quick bus ride to downtown Seattle. We couldn't have asked for a more perfect place to stay! "

5892185,35356286,2015-06-17,35716724,Chris,"Seattle is a cool city, and my time there was made all the more friendly with Emily showing me around her neck of the woods in Fremont. We walked around the neighbourhood, had great chats, got bites to eat and drinks to... well, drink. A very casual experience for a pretty chilled out place. :)"
5892185,35515791,2015-06-19,16760586,Mary,"Emily was a friendly and wonderful host! I only stayed for one night, but the place is clean, convenient, and well-suited for travelers staying for a short amount of time. The bed was extremely comfy! The Fremont neighborhood is quaint and convenient, with a bus line that takes you right to the Seattle Center and downtown. I must add that I forgot my shirt after I checked out, but Emily traveled all the way down to my office to hand it to me since I was unavailable the whole day. Emily is amazing. Overall I had a great experience, thanks again Emily!"
5892185,35719313,2015-06-21,10789129,Carrie,Super GREAT!!!  Went for a mom daughter birthday weekend. Very clean and awsome location.  Bed was comf'ee and we will defiantly use this again. Host was great and easy to deal with. ;) thank you

She gave us a lot of suggestions as to what was in the area and how to get the best views of fireworks for 4th of July. The location was clean and the bed was comfortable.  Seemless check in/check out. Also a great location,  easy walking distance to resturaunt, bars, the troll and a bus line stops right across the street to take you downtown."
5892185,38005242,2015-07-12,34866526,Joshua,"My stay in Fremont was wonderful. You couldn't ask for a better location to experience Seattle. Emily wasn't home when I arrived but she had let me know in advance & her boyfriend Ryan was there instead. Ryan was super helpful, from finding me wandering around lost to offering suggestions of places to visit. The neighborhood has a nearly endless supply of restaurants, breweries, and bars. Plus it is right by a bus stop if you want to explore other neighborhoods. I highly recommend Emily's place if you're coming through seattle. "
5892185,38667213,2015-07-17,390113,David,Emily was polite and easy to communicate with. Her apartment is a great way to experience Fremont and Seattle.

5892185,40787885,2015-08-02,36824493,Maggie,"Our flight got in after midnight, and Emily was very accommodating to us to let us come that late! She was very polite and was even kind enough to provide us with bus passes one day. There were helpful maps and guides in the room too. The towels were absolutely luxurious! I wouldn't recommend this room for two people who aren't comfortable getting super close in bed - the bed was just a little too small for two friends. Location was good - we were glad we stayed in Fremont. Gasworks Park was our favorite! "
5892185,45813094,2015-09-06,1772810,Leif,"I didn't get a chance to meet Emily, but her apt is clean and comfortable. Check in was well coordinated and Emily was easy to reach on the phone. The best part about this apt is the location. Close to everything in Fremont, which is a highly desirable neighborhood in Seattle. 

The only minor thing is the sink and bathtub are a little clogged."

5892185,47380065,2015-09-18,19734008,Steve,"I'd definitely stay again! Emily and Ryan were welcoming and interesting; the room itself was spacious, clean, and well-organized. Sharing the apartment with them was uncomplicated. I used the kitchen (and fridge!) without feeling like I was in their way and there was no problem waiting for the shower, etc. Street parking was easy to find, and the apartment is right on a major bus line, so I could get to and from downtown in fifteen minutes as early or late as I needed to. Fremont is a cool neighborhood well worth exploring, with interesting shops, restaurants, bars, galleries and an excellent grocery store. The apartment is a five-minute walk from the heart of Fremont, so it's a great place to be, whether you have business downtown (as I did) or just want to explore a funky, fun neighborhood (which I also did).  Thanks, Emily and Ryan!"
5892185,47662986,2015-09-21,23169278,Jessica,"Emily was an excellent host!  My mother said she had a great stay. They barely saw each other due to busy schedules, but it's great that my mother was able to come and go as she needed to. Thank you Emily!"
5892185,51555148,2015-10-21,27392167,Moishe,"Emily and Ryan were very welcoming, I felt at home. We had a few nice conversations but I had plenty of space to do my own thing. Great neighborhood also. Lots to do in the area!"

257140,696793,2011-11-06,418673,Daniel,"The flat was more like a suite. Darik set things up like a hotel with all the accoutrements such as laundry soap, shower stuff, etc. It was the perfect mix for our stay. The building was in a good location and had everything you could want. The space itself was perfect for two people. I'd highly recommend this."
257140,727247,2011-11-17,1398748,Marc,"Derick has several apartments in the location I stayed in and they are all squeaky clean, stocked with everything one could need, and the building is in a prime location just a few blocks from the downtown area and Pike Place Market.  "
257140,757861,2011-12-01,1382611,Kathleen,This is a great condo - really well-maintained and fabulous location.  Super-easy to check-in and check-out.  Professionally managed but with lots of friendly little touches.  I would definitely recommend staying in any of Darik's properties.
257140,842405,2012-01-06,207057,Wendy,"My husband and I stayed here with our 2 year old daughter. While the space is small, it had everything we needed and was in a very convenient location. Highly recommended."
257140,849743,2012-01-08,1481144,Edilson,"We had a great experience renting this property. The apartment was flawless, the location was excellent, and the transaction went smoothly. We walked to Pike Place, bought some seafood and cooked in the fully equipped kitchen, having the chance to experience Seattle like a local!
The apartment is small but the four of us fit comfortably (along with 5 suitcases).
I would highly recommend this property to anyone looking for a great place to stay in Seattle. "

257140,13012610,2014-05-17,8258029,Katie & Sam,"Unit 621 is a delightfully appointed getaway; indeed the photos are VERY accurate of this lovely little apartment.  It is super clean, thoughtfully detailed all around, and welcoming.  The location is ideal for walking to all downtown and waterfront amenities - which we did daily during our stay.  Having available and secure parking was a must for us and again, the locale made quick jaunts to the far reaches of town easy.  Our only disappointments were the lack of air conditioning (our stay was during a particularly warm week and all windows face western sun - but fans are provided and of course this is noted in the property amenities) and the slow speed of the internet connection (our laptops remained frustratingly packed while we resorted to 4G data service for all travel queries).  While the location IS ideal for getting around town, be aware that the apartment is directly above a major bus route / stop."

257140,22023045,2014-10-28,108039,Dan-Huy,Wonderful location. Everything was within walking distance. The apartment was very nice and cozy. The only downside was the slow internet
257140,26159593,2015-02-05,16398642,Eric,"Had a great 2 week stay in Darik's apartment.  Wonderful location, central to many attractions, restaurants and shopping.  I had an initial issue with the WiFi not working but Darik and his staff were able to fix the issue within a few short hours.  I stayed here for a work trip and found the apartment to be well equipped with everything I needed for my stay.   A well appointed kitchen made it easy for me to make dinner.  Overall, it's a great place to stay and fantastic service!  "
257140,30502587,2015-04-23,3870088,Zakcq,"Nice place in great location. Building is a little loud (I think there was a small dog in the next apartment) and the furniture makes the place feel smaller than it is, but the neighborhood is great, and the bathroom and bedroom are very nice. Very easy transit connections and very walkable to lots of locations. "
257140,37568300,2015-07-08,4592362,Julie,"The host made sure to send all directions and contact information prior to arrival. He was very quick with responses to any question. He also left a nice welcome basket with some nummy snacks. The location of the apartment was awesome, so easy to walk downtown. The washer and dryer was a nice plus half way through our trip! We definitely enjoyed the scenery from the rooftop patio. So beautiful!! Thanks!"
257140,37945593,2015-07-12,7302587,Mike,Host was clear with instruction on how to arrive and depart and has a service where all calls are directed. Place was just as described with a great balcony for sitting out in the summer! Location is excellent! Thanks for a great stay in Belltown.
257140,38359863,2015-07-14,37949783,Hinton,"The place was great! It was clean and accurately described. A very good benefit was the free parking in a secured parking garage. Wihtout AC, it was hot when we arrived. The host has tried to use 4 cooling fans for this hot summer in the pacific nw, but it was still warm. Hopefully a window unit might be able to be installed in future. "
257140,47254594,2015-09-17,34789049,Kyle,Great location!! We were able to walk everywhere we wanted to go. We would definitely stay here again.

257140,49606618,2015-10-05,37100086,Cynthia,"This was out first airbnb experience and it was great!!! We flew into Seattle with our toddler and decided not to get a rental car. We didn't bring a car seat or stroller and basically took the light rail, bus, and walked everywhere. This unit in Belltown is the PERFECT location if you are trying to go minimal like we did. I don't even know if there were neighbors because the unit was very quiet. There is a little bit of street noise since it faced the street, but that was expected and the unit is almost on the top floor. It only sucked when a fire truck drove by in the middle of the night with sirens. On a Friday night it was non-stop. The rest of our stay it was much more quiet. Definitely bearable though. The unit was also clean. Laundry in unit was very convenient since we packed light. And the roof top deck is FABULOUS. We ended each night with hot cocoa or hot tea over looking the city. You can see Puget Sound from the roof as well. The only negative was that across the street is a mental health clinic, but no one bothered us. I would definitely recommend staying here."
257140,50631956,2015-10-13,41004016,Jarret,"Great place, just as described. "
257140,55640277,2015-12-03,17426663,Rimpal,Host was clear with instruction on how to arrive and depart.  Place was just as described and in a good location.

It is in a good location with restaurants and groceries nearby, easy to go to downtown an UW. We had jogging everyday along the lake. Yes,we had everything we needed. Marc is very nice. He was always there when we needed him. Everything is perfect. I would stay again next time."

9374365,54353740,2015-11-18,46194015,Sean,"Varun was very welcoming and the apartment was just as described. There is easy street parking and the house is comfortable with all the amenities you need. One thing that is different is that you have to pass through the master bedroom where Varun stays to get to the master bath, which is where the guest shower is at. Varun made me feel comfortable and was a great host."
9374365,54794447,2015-11-23,44241126,Jennifer,Varun's place is brand new and so nice! He was the perfect host and so accommodating when my flight to Seattle was delayed. Overall fantastic experience!! 
9374365,55051928,2015-11-27,48900689,Vito,"Varun was super welcoming, I highly recomended staying in his room.  Beautiful new home with great appliances. I felt very welcomed throughout my stay. I thought the neighborhood was great, especially the location to public transit. When I arrived Varun was pulling the clean new sheets out of the washer for me. "
9374365,55693451,2015-12-04,41158892,Paige,"Varun was an awesome host, and super friendly! The place itself was really modern but also comfy and inviting. Definitely stay if you have the chance!"

7420488,40994487,2015-08-03,475230,Lily,"Marin's place was tricky to find, but once I was there I was greeted by a home even more lovely than the pictures conveyed. I was happy to have chosen the smaller room since it was also the shadier one, and in this heat, that was a good thing. Despite the lack of a/c her home was very comfortable, as was the bed (important!). 
Marin herself could not possibly have been any more interesting to talk to, sweet and thoughtful, accommodating and welcoming. I had a great time with her and loved her place immensely. If you are staying or visiting downtown or the south end of Seattle, I cannot recommend her place enough."
7420488,42018968,2015-08-10,36096460,Marisa,"We rented the front room and this room and it was perfect for 3 people. We fell in love with the house, it's so cute and cozy. Everything is clean and traveler friendly. Definitely a good place to stay if you want to experience what it's like to live in Seattle! I would recommend Marin's property to anyone and would love the chance to visit and stay with her again. Thanks for everything Marin! "
7420488,44033677,2015-08-23,38390191,Min,"As pictured, beautiful house & comfortable room/bed. In a quiet neighborhood near bus lines & light rail. Marin was a wonderful host & I enjoyed my stay."
7420488,46001791,2015-09-07,7643491,Bert,Marin is a wonderful host.  She has placed a great deal of effort into making her home accommodating for her guests.  Could not be happier that I chose to stay at her home.  Thanks Marin!
7420488,48909118,2015-09-29,4585501,Laura,Marin's house is lovely and exactly like the pictures! The neighborhood has everything I needed within walking distance and good access to downtown and other neighborhoods. She was very friendly and helpful and an all-round fantastic host. So much so that I decided to extend my stay here while continuing to explore the city. 
7420488,49825918,2015-10-06,4585501,Laura,Marin's house was the perfect place to stay while I was apartment-hunting in the city. It was very cozy and comfortable and I absolutely recommend staying with her.
7420488,50550930,2015-10-12,4585501,Laura,Marin was completely accomodating when I needed to extend my stay. I was so lucky to stay in such a comfortable spot while apartment-hunting. 
7420488,56914316,2015-12-20,45040342,Krystal,"Marin was a terrific host, so sweet and kind, she made the time to talk to you and give you great recommendations of things to do in the area.  The house is even better in person that the pictures.  Very clean and it felt like home, I can honestly say I was a little saddened to leave at the end of my trip.  I would recommend staying at Marin's when you are in the Seattle area!"
4776823,24284623,2014-12-24,20398074,Breylan,"Ben and I had a great time staying in this studio apartment in Belltown. You can't beat the location, as it's only about six blocks from Pike Place Market; there's a Starbucks on the main floor; you can see the Space Needle from the windows; there are cute chickens in the morning on the rooftop across the alley; and there's garage parking available. The numerous shops and local restaurants nearby are bountiful as well.

Jen was a great host and did everything she could to make sure our needs were accommodated. We would definitely recommend this location to a friend, and will probably stay here again."
4776823,24616213,2014-12-31,14699110,Camilla,"I loved this place! The pictures don't do it justice, AT ALL! One wall is entirely windows. I was here with 2 teenage boys and we had plenty of space. We actually fought over who got to sleep on the couch, because you woke up to such fun views of the city. Granted, we're not urban folk, so all the views, the restaurants, the underground parking, the fact that there was no need for a car, we found it all pretty cool. My son took one step inside and said, ""This is the type of place I want to live in one day!""  It was small, but perhaps because of the windows (which can be opened), never felt claustrophobic or cramped. Super quiet, never heard the neighbors, just the hum of the city. The rooftop across the alley (the hostel) had chickens and mini gardens…fun to watch.  Jen was quick and thorough with her communications, and had stocked the studio with maps of the area and the attractions, which we relied heavily on.  It was super clean,
had everything we needed and then some, including nice linens / towels, and comfy throws.   But best of all, we arrived on a freezing winter day,
and she had the apt already warmed for us. Not an ounce of regret. Oh! And she was very gracious when I botched the standard check-out procedures. :/"
4776823,24785416,2015-01-02,17480226,Alina,We had such an amazing time here! The location was absolutely perfect. Everything was very well kept and clean. Jen was always available if needed for anything. We got a wonderful tour of the place and we were good to go. The parking spot is a major bonus as well. I'd come again :)
4776823,25059473,2015-01-05,10002365,Kari,"Jen was terrific and the apartment was lovely!! Great location - my friends and I recommend the Belltown Pub and Macrina Bakery, especially.  Tons of places to hang out within walking distance, so the reserved parking spot made it easy to just leave our car and go.  That definitely helped to make it a very affordable way to stay downtown."
4776823,25319781,2015-01-12,15779284,Mayze,"My husband and I traveled to Seattle for a fun get away. Staying at this location which was centrally located to Pikes Market, the aquarium, space needle, and other tourist attractions. The restaurants were great around the apartment as well. The apartment itself was very welcoming. The essentials were provided which was great. The views were amazing at night. And so was the views on the roof. I would definitely recommend staying at this apartment again if we were visiting Seattle again."
4776823,25564344,2015-01-19,24733246,Evan,"Awesome experience! This listing was very comfortable and had a great view of the city (including the Space Needle). The quarters were very clean and updated. Beautiful bathroom and full kitchen. The surrounding neighborhood was great and felt comfortable walking around at day or night. Also, the listing is only a 5-10 minute walk to Pike Place Market or to the Space Needle which was exactly what we wanted during our stay in Seattle. The location felt very secure with keys required for entry into parking or main lobby. The building itself is beautiful with large wooden beams and historic decor.
Our host was very accommodating and responsive to make sure that everything was clear, providing a booklet of instructions for Wifi use and nearby attractions.
Overall, this experience made our stay in Seattle unforgettable. Highly recommend staying here if you would like to have all the comforts of home!"
4776823,25797554,2015-01-26,25062393,Steve,"The Loft in the Austin Bell Building provided the perfect, cozy haven each day and night of our 4-day Seattle stay. From communication prior to our travel  date to our arrival at the front door for a late check-in, Jen is a perfect host to our first Airbnb experience.  She welcomed us to Seattle even as we were landing at SeaTac and made sure we had everything we needed to begin our visit. The location is spot on—a quick elevator ride to the building lobby and you are in the middle of Belltown and immediately part of a lively neighborhood scene. We never had to drive but walked to discover and try local restaurants next door or no more than two blocks from our Seattle home. And how cool to view the rooftop urban chicken coop just across the alley?!! This is indeed a ""Best (historic) building + garage"" and Jen's care and attention helped make our stay  fun, comfortable, meaningful and memorable. Thank you, Jen!
Steve and Char"
4776823,25864534,2015-01-27,5727118,Benjamin,Jen was amazing with my stay. I had multiple issues which need her assistance and probably would have considered myself more of a pain but Jen was super helpful with everything and was always pleasant to talk to. The apartment is in an amazing location close to all the main attractions as well as restaurants and bars. The water is super close meaning on days when you're lucky to get awesome weather the water is right there to walk along! Thanks so much Jen!
4776823,26103141,2015-02-03,25246364,Teresa,"This was the PERFECT place for my boyfriend and I! The property was very CLEAN &SPACIOUS for two people. Pictures did not do the unit justice; one side of the apartment was all window & there was so much light in the unit! I loved looking at the fog and rain from the windows. Most importantly, the apartment is situated at an IDEAL LOCATION! It is a 0.5 mile/15 min walk to Pike Place Market and the Space Needle. My boyfriend & I went jogging along the waterfront, which was only 3 blocks away, and then made our way down to the aquarium and Pike Market. There are also a lot of highly rated restaurant & bars within a 2-block radius, and there is even a Starbucks downstairs! There is also a market one block away. My boyfriend was ecstatic that there was a super cool sports bar (Buckley's) right around the corner that played the Golden State Warriors games (or any sports channel you request). I highly recommend this listing to everyone because all the hot spots are within walking distance, and I felt SAFE walking around even at midnight. The check-in and check-out process was very easy. Jen was promptly responsive when we needed her. This was a great first Airbnb experience for me, and the apartment made my birthday weekend that much more perfect! I'm excited to try Airbnb for my next travel! "
4776823,26233478,2015-02-07,27136117,Aimee,"Jen was fantastic, very communicative, and made us feel welcome throughout our stay.  The check in was seamless!  The building is lovely and the neighborhood has tons of good places to eat and drink.
Close to downtown, the waterfront, ferries, etc...
The condo is spotless and quiet.  We had a great night's sleep after walking all over the city.  We'll definitely be back! "
4776823,26364015,2015-02-10,5432723,Ming Han,Description was accurate and the location was amazing! I don't think we could have found a better place to stay. Within walking distance of lots of Pike Place Market and a ton of great restaurants and bars! Having parking was a plus too.
4776823,26532738,2015-02-15,24174620,Scott,"We love Jens apartment. It was well located, clean, and new. And we will definitely stay there again."

4776823,26943382,2015-02-22,14908007,Foster,The location of the apartment couldn't have been better. Just about everything we wanted to do was in a 10-15 minute walk. Checking in and out was easy and it was nice to have reserved spot to park the car.
4776823,27728885,2015-03-10,20492888,Janice,"The location was amazing! Walking distance to great restaurants and shops. Jen was fantastic at getting back to me if I had questions, and accommodated me on an early check in. The place was great, the pictures don't lie. Warm and cozy, with a great view. It's a great place to come back to after exploring the city during the day. I will definitely be booking here again. "
4776823,27783870,2015-03-11,11977460,Sanja,"The review merits one star because the apartment itself was quite nice.   We're really sorry to say that after several really positive experiences on airbnb, this overall experience was a minus - big time. 

We were passing through Seattle for one night, and thought it'd be nice to stay downtown for a birthday celebration.  We contacted the host and relayed that we liked the place, but thought the price was a little high.  

Here is exactly the message that we sent to this host:  ""Here's what I'd like to propose. If you are willing to waive the cleaning fee and simply rent at the advertised rate of $99/night, then we are all in. If not, we'll just move along and get in touch with the other places that are nearby. Thanks for the response and the understanding."" 

We received no response from the host, but we did get an airbnb approval, and thought we were all good to go.  

Sadly, this was the last good news we got from this rental. 

Prior to our arrival, it was clear that Jen was not in the least bit happy about having to waive the cleaning fee or what she considered a discounted price.  As we neared Seattle after a long day on the road, we emailed at around 5 pm to let her know that we were on the way.  Here is her message to us: 

""It is ready so I don't mind checkin now but I have scheduled the next guest tomorrow AM-  Sorry for any inconvenience. I need check out by 10am and linens washed, tidy up, etc as we discussed."" 

Firstly, we never discussed anything as she had barely communicated anything other than copy/paste instructions.  Secondly, we had booked according to her listed terms - 2 pm check-in and an 11 am check-out.  Nothing else was discussed.  The communication was so bad that as we went to check-in, we were ""buzzed in"" (by Jen, we can only assume) with no ""hello"" or other greeting, and it wasn't until a phone call was placed that we were told to ""go on in the door is open"".   Thirdly, there was no guest booked the next day (easy to see from the calendar after all).  She even said in a later exchange we could book it another night (!!).  

All in all, this was an incredibly disappointing booking and put a real damper on an otherwise awesome trip to a great city.  And this was the first negative experience we've had on airbnb.   

We're sorry that it turned out this way, but if you can find a way to work with Jen then the place itself is not so bad.  Just don't make the mistake of not paying her full asking price as an airbnb property manager, or you might find yourself wishing you had booked elsewhere.   

Best of luck to you!  "
4776823,27995425,2015-03-16,23582230,Justine,"My boyfriend and I stayed in Jen's studio this weekend (March 13-15th) It was a great location for the price, very close to shopping and tourist attractions. Parking is a big plus. The studio was very clean and a decent size. Jen was very patient with us, and answered all questions we had. "
4776823,28181754,2015-03-19,21926972,Tara,"The place was lovely and perfectly situated in the city. Close to the market, great shops, delicious food, etc. It was also a truly comfortable place to stay. Whole apartment was clean and made for a perfect spot to rest our heads. Jen was great and accommodated us with an early check in. Would definitely stay here again!"
4776823,28398798,2015-03-23,25973353,Amy,"Jen's apartment was so nice!! It had plenty of space, very clean, and felt safe. The location was so great!! A quick 10 minute walk to Pike Place, a 15minute walk to downtown, and having parking included was great also. It was very convenient and I'd stay here again. The only thing I'd mention was the apartment tends to get really stuffy and warm - but that will clear when you open the large windows!

Not to mention, Jen even accommodated my early check-in and she was very helpful when I had any questions!"
4776823,28779950,2015-03-30,14409090,Michael,"Jen's apartment came exactly as advertised and I had a great stay.  The apartment is clean and comfortable.  The location is excellent, it is surrounded by bars and restaurants and an easy walk to so many sights in Seattle.  The parking spot made it very convenient to have a rental car which helped immensely since I needed to go out to some of the towns south of Seattle.

I didn't end up meeting Jen, but she was always available and got back to me promptly.  Fortunately I didn't have any problems with the apartment but I'm sure if I had she would've gotten them resolved quickly. 

Thanks Jen!"
4776823,29053398,2015-04-03,12683473,Victoria,"Visited Seattle for a few days with my boyfriend. The location of this apartment is ideal - walking distance to everything downtown. The apartment is cozy and perfect for two people. However, we were unable to use the wifi and Netflix because the bill had not been paid. The apartment has excellent views of the space needle, especially from the roof of the building. The building itself is well protected and we felt extremely safe the whole time. "

Can't say enough great things about this location and Jen! Highly recommend this place for anybody looking for a cool place to stay and explore Seattle!"
4776823,29633203,2015-04-10,24271315,Allison,The apartment was perfectly located in downtown Seattle. We walked to the Space Needle and tons of local restaurants and stores. The apartment itself was clean and had everything we needed for an overnight stay. I loved that it came with parking because that would have been an issue in this neighborhood. I would definitely recommend this location.

Would definitely love to stay here again! :)"

4776823,32746608,2015-05-21,28434024,Jarrett,"Stay here when visiting Seattle! As the saying goes location, location, location. The apartment is a ten minute walk to Pike's Market to the south and a 10 minute walk to the Space Needle and Seattle Center to the north. There are tons of restaurants just a few steps away and   if you feel like driving it has a parking spot, which is worth it's weight in gold in Seattle. As for the apartment itself, it had all the essentials and was clean with a nice size kitchen and TV. The check-in and check-out processes were a breeze and the host Jen is willing to help with anything you need. "
4776823,32886816,2015-05-23,3682766,Arkar,"Jen was very friendly and responsive. Apartment was beautifully decorated and nice. And best of all, location was one of the best you could ask for in Downtown Seattle. Thanks for the amazing stay Jen!"

I believe the best part about this stay would have to be the location. It's literally walking distance to all of the top spots. Parking is even included!!!!!! 
4776823,33369147,2015-05-27,3890231,Marie,"Staying in Jens place definitely exceeded our expectations. The apartment was very nice and clean and Jen even had a homemade attractions/guide book waiting for us. The location is absolutely perfect. 

I didn't actually meet Jen face to face, but she was very quick to respond via all mediums of communication. She was super accommodating and helpful. We'd definitely come back. :)"
4776823,33571544,2015-05-30,28587703,Anais,"Listing was exactly as Jen had listed. We loved the old building, the view, and the proximity to most everything. We left our car parked the entire visit and walked everywhere. The wifi worked well and It was nice to have Netflix as well. Jen responded quickly and efficiently to our questions/concerns. We would definitely consider staying here again for future visits.  "
4776823,33783869,2015-06-01,4040365,Alana,"Location location location!! This is a beautiful space in an excellent location to see the city.  No complaints, very nice to stay in.  Jen made us feel welcome and check in via text. 
"
4776823,34117136,2015-06-05,6374580,Anne,"This was our first airbnb experience and it was great. The condo was clean and very comfortable. However, the best part was its location.  My husband and I were able to walk to the Space Needle, the waterfront, Pike Place Market and Pioneer Square. There are also lots of great restaurants within walking distance of this condo. Jen was easy to contact and suggested some places for dinner after we arrived late. I would recommend the restaurant 360 just down the street, which Jen suggested. Overall, great location and great condo."
4776823,34273449,2015-06-07,26323044,Rebecca," We enjoyed our stay in Seattle! The description and photos of the apartment were accurate. It was very clean and had everything we needed for our short stay. While small, it was plenty of room for two of us. Fantastic location! Walking distance to restaurants, bars, and the big tourist attractions!  We never actually met Jen, but did call her with a question and she was helpful. "
4776823,34620123,2015-06-10,3684382,Rachel,The room was in a perfect part of the city! We could walk to pikes place and the needle within minutes. Beautiful building with Starbucks right outside! The laundry in the room was a life saver- we brought home suitcases full of clean clothes!
4776823,35063876,2015-06-15,4768147,Lance,"We stayed in Seattle for 5 nights . This was a wonderful location . Walking distance to all Seattle has to offer . Plenty of restaurants in walking distance . Jenn had great communication throughout our stay . She called to make sure we were ok the first night . Although we had things planned out therefore we didn't need her assistance . Although she was there in case we needed her. I traveled with my two boys ages 11 and 12. The apartment was completely comfortable and enough room . Traveling with 4 adults might be a little two cramped . But we were more than fine . You are located in Belltown in a heart of a city so if you want peace and quiet and expect to sleep in late , that might be an issue . A little noisy but that is city life and was expected . It did not bother us . The only downfall is that there is no AC . During the day it got a little hot , but we were touring the city most of the time and it is June , so we were not exposed to that often. At night it cools down and with the addition of the fan present . Sleeping temperature wise it was very comfortable. I would def stay here again . The building is safe , comfortable , secure , and updated . Much better than any hotel . Highly recommend and Jenn was great !!! You will not be sorry if you stay here . "
4776823,35767040,2015-06-22,26809236,Henry,"Enjoyed ourselves. Loved the neighborhood,and could easily walk everywhere. Nice view of the top of the Space Needle.The apartment, a studio really, was adequately, if somewhat sparsely furnished. Jen was really helpful, answering any questions, and was even available( electronically) to let us in early to drop off our bags. The building was very quiet, and we only saw a couple of people all weekend.
We have lived in urban settings all our lives, so ambient street noise doesn't bother us, but without air conditioning, we had the windows open, and it was VERY noisy at night: the appartment was a couple of floors above a large restaurant that seemed to have air conditioning and an exhaust fan running all the time. Could be a problem for some people.
Overall, we had a good experience, and a good introduction to Seattle."
4776823,36085390,2015-06-25,29305620,John David,"This was our first time in Seattle, and Jen's place was great -- just a short walk to everything, a view of the Space Needle from the large windows, garage parking, and everything we needed to make us feel at home. While we didn't get to meet Jen in person, her directions to the apartment were spot-on, she was very responsive, and even checked in to make sure we were settled and to answer any questions we had about the apartment and the city."
4776823,36337779,2015-06-27,36312039,Laura,"Was easy, fast and clear communication. Room like shown in pictures and explained in description. nice neighborhood, easy to walk to everything. would definatly recommend to others and would use it again. 
Little bit hot if you go in super hot time of year. 
"
4776823,36860342,2015-07-02,22063249,Tim,"We loved staying at Jen's place. It's a charming studio in a great location in a walkable neighborhood. 

The  online description is accurate. Jen made check in go smoothly.  We will definitely consider Jen's place when we get back to Seattle."
4776823,37036827,2015-07-04,29126347,Clare,Thank you Jen for making us feel welcome in a new city and with our first AirBnB experience! We were in walking distance to everything we wanted to see in Seattle! We were a little concerned about no AC but it cools off at night and the fans helped. Check in was super easy and loved the Starbucks next door (:
4776823,37835337,2015-07-11,29154242,Michael,"We stayed at this loft for two nights for our first trip to Seattle.  What a great location.  Downstairs there is a great little bar and a Starbucks - although we walked the few extra steps down the street to Cherry Street Coffee.  Another quick walk south and you're at Pike's Place market and north you're at the Space Needle.  The loft itself is perfect for two people - simple and quiet.  There is no A/C, but even in summer with the windows open it was comfortable.  Jen was a helpful host and let us park our car their early before check-in.  Highly recommended!"
4776823,38257881,2015-07-14,8310795,David,Great Stay!  Jen took care of everything!
4776823,38618852,2015-07-17,3852632,Bryan,"Our stay was better than expected. Having never been to Seattle, Jen opened up this sweet pad for our short stay and made us feel welcome and at home. Her instructions and feedback were on-point, and she was always checking in to make sure we were accommodated. 

The apartment itself was small, but perfect size for two people. Within a two minute walk there is everything from amazing sushi, Italian food, bakeries and markets--not to mention the Starbucks that is directly below the apartment building. A ten minute walk in either direction will put you in ether Pikes Place market, or the Space Needle. 

 We're already planning our next trip for January, and we'll definitely be coming back! "
4776823,38984117,2015-07-20,29109028,Fran,My husband and I had a great time at Jen's loft!! The view was great and it was the perfect location for everything we wanted to do!! Thank you Jen!
4776823,39330991,2015-07-22,18222285,Steve,This is a great centrally located condo and we enjoyed staying here.  Jen was great at communicating with us about our stay and any questions we had.  The only issue we had with the place was that the mattress on the bed really needs to be replaced.  Enjoyed our stay!
4776823,39923314,2015-07-27,32619869,Chad,The unit was overall very nice. Modern and updated. We have 4 people staying one night. Wouldn't recommend more then 3 people. Jen allowed us to check in early - which was a huge plus. Would definitely suggest this unit to others. 
4776823,40200224,2015-07-29,29767037,Frauke,We (family of 4) enjoyed our time at Jen's place and in Seattle. The apartment was as described with everything we needed. Thanks Jen!
4776823,44277681,2015-08-25,28998924,Cathy,"Jen was very responsive, friendly and helpful. The apartment was exactly as listed - no surprises! It was clean and located conveniently within a 10 min walking distance to Pike Place, the Space Needle, and many many good places for food and drinks! The apartment was perfect for my trip because it had all the amenities I needed - wifi, Netflix, parking, washer/dryer, AC unit and fans. I was very thankful for the AC unit since it was surprisingly hot during the first part of my stay. I couldn't have picked a better apartment!"
4776823,44788144,2015-08-29,30778332,Susan,"Excellent location within walking distance to most sites. Location is  noisy between the police sirens and the restaurant next door emptying their trash at 1 am. But, that may be part of staying in the city. We were not able to check in early, so that was a problem walking around town with our suitcases. There is a TV, but no cable, good for net flex etc only.
"
4776823,45063148,2015-08-31,15860232,Angelique,"Location, location! This studio apartment is in a perfect location.  We didn't have much communication with Jen while we were there, but really didn't need to. The unit is perfect for 2 people (I was there for a girls' weekend getaway), but could also be good for a small family with 1 child.  Kitchen doesn't have a ton of supplies (we didn't need it, and neither will you), but there are the basics if you need it! There was cold water in the frig. Unit was clean. There is a portable a/c unit that makes noise, but in our opinion, helped circulate the air and provided some white noise.  The unit is great.  SHORT walk to Pike Place and lots of great shopping, great cafes (check out Cherry Street Coffee), and lounges/food. You don't want to miss Umi Sake House around the corner (make reservations - you won't be sorry!) and Sarajevo for a cocktail and appetizers - just downstairs (try the flaming cheese - amazing!)...Easy in and out of the building. Building is very charming. Did I mention...location?  We used Uber a few times, including to the airport (it was $27).  Thanks, Jen! I will definitely spread the word!"
4776823,47044865,2015-09-15,31595361,Stephanie,"Jen's place is in a great location, close to restaurants, coffee, and pikes place is a short walk away. The apartment had many more (nice!) amenities than I was expecting. All bathroom and kitchen necessities were provided in addition to oatmeal, popcorn, games and other goodies. I will say the pillows were pretty flat and the bed wasn't very comfortable. It's neat that you can see the top of the space needle from the rooftop deck but it's not a very scenic place to hang out otherwise. Jen was courteous, quick to respond to messages and very accommodating with an early check in. The building has a beautiful lobby and Starbucks next door is a plus. We had an overall good experience! "
4776823,47654343,2015-09-21,52640,George,Jen's place was perfectly located downtown and to Starbucks (right downstairs). Lot's of great restaurants in the area and just a short walk to Pike Place market. We loved the area. Thanks so much :)
4776823,48713501,2015-09-28,21141532,Mary Pat,What a great location for a visit to Seattle. The apartment was nice with all the needed amenities. We had a car so we were grateful for the parking. Loved that SBUX is right there. The apartment is located at centrally for walking to all the major sights and is surrounded by great restaurants. Thanks for sharing your space with us. 
4776823,49069306,2015-09-30,44944245,Tate,"Jen was a great host and answered any/all questions we had, and even gave some recommendations for shopping and food in the area. The neighborhood was perfect, and we were walking distance to most of the things that we wanted to see/do over the course of our short visit. Found a couple great restaurants in the neighborhood, including an amazing sushi restaurant around the corner. We loved Seattle and wouldn't hesitate to stay at this same location again in the future."
4776823,50387442,2015-10-11,2549952,Seira,"Jen made herself available to me upon arrival, she also gave me all the detailed info I needed to access the property. The loft was just as described and in a great location, in a very nice building. The loft was well appointed wit everything I needed to make my stay comfortable."
4776823,50480379,2015-10-12,30268968,Kalin,Apartment was clean and nice and in a great location. We really enjoyed our stay and would go back again! 
4776823,50803751,2015-10-14,10612,Matthieu,"We had an amazing time at Jen's place. The location was perfect, walking distance to so many stores and restaurants. The place was modern and extra clean with an amazing view, and Jen was super welcoming. We will be back when we will travel to Seattle again!"
4776823,50863621,2015-10-15,43872715,Lily,"Jen was a really great host. Her place is essentially set up like a hotel suite: the place is spotless, conditioner and shampoo and clean towels, and plenty of info on Seattle's attractions. Her place is an easy walk to Pike's Place, and she was very helpful when I had questions. The free parking made life easier too. "
4776823,51452896,2015-10-20,43799567,Lindsey,"Great first-time Airbnb experience! The space was the perfect size for two people. Location is GREAT, surrounded by some of the city's best restaurants and walking distance to major attractions (Seattle Center, Pike Place, waterfront, stadiums). The parking was super convenient since we had a rental and Jen let us use the parking spot after checking out since our flight was later, which was nice.

Heads up for people bringing/renting cars! The parking spot is tight (as is the general parking situation in downtown Seattle), on a slight slope, and between a pillar and an SUV, so plan accordingly unless you're a parking rockstar. "
4776823,51658495,2015-10-22,2025225,Albert,"Stayed here during some travel for work. Great space! Jen was very kind, communicative, and responsive. Place was clean, bed was comfy. Loved the location too, great food and coffee close by and convenient to downtown Seattle.  Would happily stay here again next time I'm in town!"
4776823,53264060,2015-11-07,31370148,Mario,"We loved this place.  It was clean, comfortable and had everything you need for a great stay.  Jen really knows how to make guests feel welcome. The beverages and snacks are so very much appreciated after a long day of travel. We would recommend this place to anyone visiting Seattle, so close to everything."
4776823,56058252,2015-12-08,1411013,Corey,"This may be my favorite place we've stayed in Seattle. Awesome view from a great historic building in a great spot. We were happy to call this our home for a few days. We took full advantage of the Starbucks downstairs and enjoyed watching the rain fall outside the awesome view.

Jen was responsive and attentive. She made our stay stress free and fun. The place was very clean and comfortable. Definitely made it our home.

Hope we can visit again soon!

 "
4776823,56197328,2015-12-10,39288626,Jonathan,Had a great experience staying at Jens apartment. It was in a great location with lots of food options. A close walk to lots of shopping and pikes market. The apartment was a good size for 2 people and was very clean. 
7839535,47895017,2015-09-21,44265286,Joshua,Alex did a great job of making us feel welcome. The place was clean and organized. The community was very nice and quiet. We were out there for a wedding and had never been to Seattle before but Alex gave us some advice as to where to go and what to do.  We enjoyed our stay and appreciated the hospitality. 
7839535,48647790,2015-09-27,21220792,Toby,"Alex was a great host. He was very prompt answering any questions I had via AirBnB messages prior to my arrival. The room is just as it is described, very clean and private, with a gas fireplace that not only adds a cozy touch to the room but heats it up very fast. The private bathroom right across the hall made for a very convenient stay. The motion-sensor lighting along the path to the private entrance was very handy as it was dark when I first arrived. By far the most convenient parking I've had while staying in Seattle. I would definitely recommend this room for anyone looking for a place to stay in quiet, quaint neighborhood conveniently located in Queen Anne. I will definitely try to book the room again on my next visit to Seattle."
7839535,52596673,2015-10-31,43908136,Rob,"This room/space is a great Airbnb option (especially with the private entrance option)!  I did a month as I needed a temporary place when moving to Seattle and I was very pleased. 

The room and house are as described and Alex allows the guests to take advantage of the space.  I enjoyed watching sports on his big TV (with surround), working/reading on the back deck (super peaceful!) and using the BBQ grill from time to time.  The whole house is quiet and I felt comfortable both in my space and the common areas. The room can get a bit chilly, but the fireplace warms it up very quickly.  

Alex's dog, Chloe, is a good guard dog (i.e. barks at guests the first time you meet), but she warms up to you very quickly afterwards.  It was actually quite nice to have a dog around in the common areas.  

Although not right downtown, it's a cool spot and offers free, no hassle, parking too. It's just a quick walk into downtown Queen Anne where you can buy groceries (TJ's/Safeway), grab a bite or drink, etc.  It's also right near multiple transit lines.  I really enjoyed this area as it's a quiet neighborhood, but it's very easy to walk to some more commercial areas (Queen Anne or Fremont). "
7839535,55399297,2015-12-01,43908136,Rob,"I really enjoy this place as not only do you get a private entrance (with the basement room), but you also have a lot of room in the house.  The ""space needle"" basement entertainment room is a great space to lounge, watch sports in surround sound, read by the fire, or even work out.  It's also super convenient to have the bathroom and laundry room right outside the bedroom.  

Alex is a nice host.  He gives you privacy if you want it, but is also someone to have a quick chat with at breakfast, etc. 

Although there were other guests in the house when I was there, it was still comfortable and quiet.  Everyone respects the house and facilities.  

The location is walkable to ""the strip"" in Queen Anne so it's easy to grab groceries, or get dinner/drinks and not have to drive.  The neighborhood is very safe and quiet and it's super nice to have free parking on the street.  "
1773803,8144167,2013-10-17,9358205,Joe,"A cozy apartment in the middle of the university district. There's plenty to do nearby on ""the ave."" Also there's a farmer's market every Saturday which has locally grown vegetables/fruits/meats and cheeses. It was only about a twenty minute drive to get to most other areas or sites; the apartment is in a great location.

Sheldon is a wonderful host that will tell you everything you need to know about the city, as well as really making you feel at home. He's extremely easy to contact and always promptly answers any questions about where to eat or what to see. Sheldon even took us tailgating with him to a Seahawks game. He is very inviting and left us with a great experience."
1773803,8490699,2013-11-02,9579882,Steve,"Sheldon was a gracious host. He was attentive. He checked in via text message, and ended every conversation/note, asking if there was anything he could do for me and my family. 
The apartment was a perfect getaway for us. We have been at Children's Hospital, and the bed was comfortable and the whole place was quiet. The location is perfect for anyone wanting to spend a week or more in the U District. Or if you are in town for a Huskey/Seahawks/Mariners game. If the Seahawks are in town, you will probably be invited to a wonderful Tailgate by Sheldon.
If you do have any challenges with the apartment, Sheldon will take care of the issue promptly.  He is like the greatest of waiters; there when you need him, but not over-bearing, and lets you enjoy the space and his neighborhood."
1773803,8924892,2013-11-25,107960,L'Oreal,"Sheldon was fabulous! We booked same-day and he responded quickly and was flexible. The apartment is quite spacious with a large sectional and cute den space in addition to the bedroom. 

You really cannot get closer to ""The Ave"" in the University District. This apartment sits in the center of the action and there are no shortages of busses to get around the city.

We would definitely stay here again! "
1773803,8988146,2013-11-30,9857387,Marianne,"Sheldon was a great host with a lot of advices. The apartment is vast and clean.
As someone said previously, you are right on ""The Ave"" and there are TONS of restaurants around. 
Unfortunately, we didn't find U-district to be a nice neighborhood. Even though we were on the third floor, we could hear very clearly people in the back alley at night as if they were sharing the room with us. 
The kitchen is equipped with a lot of wine-related tools, but has no toaster.
Although the ad says the contrary, there is no wifi in the apt. You are surrounded by cafés and other places offering free wifi, but you cannot check your mails in the comfort of the huge couch."
1773803,9106387,2013-12-07,1833875,Dave,"Sheldon was a phenomenal host! he made sure that all my arrangements were taken care of, and he was very understanding of my somewhat hectic schedule. His place was in an incredibly convenient location, and if you have anything you need to do in or near UW this could not be a more perfect place. The apartment itself was very clean, extremely spacious, and very comfortable. Highly recommend!"
1773803,9210221,2013-12-13,7748355,Annie,"Sheldon was a very attentive and helpful host who was easy to communicate with. He met with me at a convenient time and helped me bring my luggage in, showed me all around the apartment, and told me a lot of information about Seattle and nearby restaurants. The apartment was conveniently located in the center of the UW campus village area where there are a number of restaurants and shops. He was considerate enough to accommodate my complex travel schedule and I appreciated that very much. The apartment was warm and well equipped for a nice stay. "
1773803,9354992,2013-12-23,10001020,Mason,"Sheldon was a great host! Communication was extremely easy which made meeting up no problem at all. He made sure we felt welcome and comfortable in his home which is always a plus. The place itself is better than the pictures. The location is perfect for walking around the u-district; free parking is just around the corner! I would gladly stay here again. 

Thank you! "
1773803,9428674,2013-12-28,10230926,Emma,"Thanks again for everything. Had a great stay in Seattle, Sheldon was a great host, the appartement is in the student district, very close to lots of good restaurants. "
1773803,9800259,2014-01-11,10260917,Matheus,"His apartment is really great. It's cosy, beautiful, has every tools you need, and the location it's perfect, it's close to everything you need. Sheldon is a really nice host. He was always in touch with us all the time, showing up quickly everytime we needed to solve anything. I'd definetly rent the apartment again if I had the chance."
1773803,9841070,2014-01-13,11027153,Christy,"Shel is responsible, personable and no mystery. I prefer dealing with straight forward people and that is what I got with Shel. The location of the apt is great!!!! The building is old, the apartment is a little drafty, you will hear street noise, and the hot water is sparse BUT for the price, location and personality of Shel you will be getting a great deal! I would rent again (I went with my 5 year old and his ""aunt""). We had a great experience! I am already planning my next trip up! Shel is very nice. Check around and you will not find a better crash pad!"
1773803,9906044,2014-01-18,7242990,Garth,"Shelden and his place were great. Was in town for business at UW and the location was perfect. Area was bustling but apartment away from the street. Comfortable, spacious accommodations. Check in and check out were a breeze and Shel was way responsive. Very highly recommended!"
1773803,9935340,2014-01-20,5490998,Kevin,Sheldon was a good host.
1773803,9986292,2014-01-23,10346088,George,"Sheldon was very hospitable. He was there if we had any questions and let us know about many great places to eat. We liked the grungy University side of town. Apartment is old with no central heat, but with heavy comforter, heated blanket and space heater we were just fine. Good location if you're visiting the university. Only thing I recommend is bringing sheets and wash cloths. Other than that everything was great!"
1773803,10066612,2014-01-28,2822369,Gavin,Shel was good about checking in via text to make sure things were going well (and to recommend restaurants) and the apartment was great - interesting building with a lot of character and fantastic location.  We really enjoyed ourselves.
1773803,10122684,2014-02-01,1704789,Charles,"Superb location if visiting University of Washington. Wonderful south sun, Over roof view of Space Needle and downtown Seattle. Classic old building with all the unique attributes of such. Many good restaurants just outside door. Multiple flights of stairs. Sporadic internet. OK for cruising more difficult if working from computer. Very low water pressure at kitchen sink but good at shower. Sitting room off bedroom perfect for reading. No tv which was good for me but not for everyone. If you have a car, parking is problematic. You will have to lug your bags unless you find the spot in front on the street. Three blocks away you can park for free. To find the entrance it is difficult. Remember that the Gyro shop is next door to the north. "
1773803,10213914,2014-02-06,2414382,Rob,"Great communication, extremely helpful and understanding. I will definitely be booking next time I'm in Seattle."
1773803,10321677,2014-02-13,10914151,Dan,"As many others have said, Sheldon is a great host. He communicated all the details and made sure I had everything I needed. He was able to provide information about the area and some good tips for good food. I'd definitely stay again and recommend Sheldon to my friends. "
1773803,10366667,2014-02-16,11516291,Emma,"Sheldon was a good host.  We arrived later than expected due to travel delays, and he was perfectly accommodating.  The apartment is very spacious and conveniently located."
1773803,10437376,2014-02-18,11985816,Robyn,"When renting a place like this, knowing you won't be able to see it before your stay, having communication with the host is vital. Sheldon was excellent at keeping a reliable line of communication, I felt taken care of before, during and after the stay. Aside from the stellar service we received, the apartment was completely cleaned, well-stocked, and the only real difference between it and a hotel was the high-level of direct service we received and how ""homey"" the space feels. A great price for the space and amenities that were given, I am very impressed with the overall experience and I was IN LOVE with the location and how close things were. Getting quarters for laundry from the restaurant next door further proved how nice the people in the area were. I would love to rent this place again :) High marks from this very satisfied guest! Thanks Sheldon!"
1773803,10747672,2014-03-05,12204945,Bhuvana Kotteswaran,"Sheldon was really professional , helpful . The apartment is brilliant and is very close to the university . You have all types of cuisines nearby . Calm locality . Neat and perfect I would stay . Would highly recommend ! "
1773803,10978566,2014-03-16,11515021,Ryan,"We had a great time, and enjoyed the stay! The apartment was as described, and Sheldon was very knowledgeable about the area. He was available, but not overbearing, and his suggestions definitely came in handy.

The location was great, and we were able to get around easily between public transportation and Uber."
1773803,11082434,2014-03-19,11290464,Will,"Our stay was excellent. The apartment is right in the heart of the university district. We could walk anywhere near UW and the bus stop is maybe 300 feet away, so incredibly convenient to the rest of Seattle.

Sheldon was an excellent host. He met us near the apartment, showed us around, and was always quick to respond by text to the couple of small questions we had.

I would definitely recommend to anyone who wants to be near UW."
1773803,11216861,2014-03-25,7155726,Karol,"First off, Sheldon is a great host. He was very accommodating when we requested an earlier check in time and overall very accessible yet not overbearing. He provided us with bus schedules, and personal restaurant choices (my boyfriend and I were pretty much on a foodie trip)--even Sheldon's girlfriend made a nice list of restaurants with descriptions and all. 
Now onto the apartment: It was very clean with plenty of blankets, towels and traveling essentials (shampoo/soap etc). Seattle a lot cooler than we're used to but if you turn the heat on and bring out the space heater it wasn't bad. The only negative thing was the bed. It was a bit uncomfortable for me because with every movement there'd be a loud squeak. I mentioned this to Sheldon, who promptly asked whether I'd like the bed flipped. It wasn't a huge deal to me because the couch is ridiculously huge and comfortable so I crashed there instead. 
All in all, a good experience. "
1773803,11410139,2014-04-01,2169557,Jill,Sheldon was a great host. The apartment was exactly what was advertised and sufficient for our stay. I would not hesitate to go back and stay again. Any time I needed anything Sheldon was there to help with questions I had. Great trip great place!
1773803,12809904,2014-05-12,69079,Mike,Sheldon was an obliging and unintrusive host. The location is fabulous for anyone needing to spend time in the University District.
1773803,13029988,2014-05-18,9876139,Milena,"Great appartment, extremely well located!... idealy placed for restaurants, cafes and UW, transportation to downtown almost right in front of the door. Sheldon was really nice, check in and check out went smoothly, also provided me with intersting tips on for seattle discovery!. It was a really confortable stay and an overall positive experience. Thank you Sheldon!."
1773803,13117552,2014-05-19,15417445,Jeremy,"Shel's apartment was as advertised. We found it clean, spacious, and comfortable. And Shel was easygoing and friendly. If you want a spot in the heart of Seattle's U district, I would recommend this one.  "
1773803,13273184,2014-05-24,12188990,Natalia,"My stay at Sheldon's apartment was great. The apartment was exactly as described, and Sheldon was a wonderful host. Loved how quirky and fun the place was. It's literally in the middle of everything near the UW campus but at the same time nice and quiet. There are blocks and blocks of restaurants around, a Bikram yoga studio in the same building, grocery stores, post office, copy center--all 1-2 minute walk away. The apartment also had wonderful views--of the Seattle skyline, and of a lovely backyard area shared with other buildings. A great place overall."
1773803,13407757,2014-05-27,12934786,Kali,Fun and funky apartment for a great price in a great neighborhood! 
1773803,13662481,2014-06-02,951583,Charles S,Sheldon was welcoming. He has gone out of his way to make his space useful.  I appreciated having a separate room in which to meditate and do yoga.  The kitchen and bathrooms were a little small.
1773803,13793426,2014-06-04,13232068,Michael,Sheldon made it easy for us to stay at his place. We arrived late and Sheldon got us in and gave us the quick tour so we could get settled for the night. The place is very comfortable and met all of our needs.
1773803,14391047,2014-06-18,2155455,Mary Ann,"Sheldon was an easy host to deal with, very responsive and straightforward. The apartment is convenient, light and bright, and met my needs very well. I would stay here again."
1773803,14775918,2014-06-26,13209386,Xiaofan,谢耳朵的房子是我在美国第一次租住的民居，房子宽大，设施齐全，最满意的是交通方便，出门走一分钟就是公交车站，有多路公交车去往市中心。过马路就是漂亮的华盛頓大学校园，房子所在的街区是一条美食街，有各国的美食选择，特别是有中国的川菜和粤菜，超市也很方便。美中不足的是房子比较老旧，没有电梯，刚到时有一点失望，住了三天后，认为还是满意的。若再去西雅图，有可能再次入住的。谢谢!
1773803,15055120,2014-07-01,16183728,Zack,"Shel's place is fantastic. Great location, everything is just as described and pictured. He was extremely accommodating when we needed an earlier check in. In the apartment you'll find maps as well as great restaurant recommendations within walking distance. Shel was also always available to answer questions and even went out of his way to suggest a baseball game and fireworks happening our first night in town. Would definitely stay here again and recommend to anyone visiting the city. 
"
1773803,15162500,2014-07-03,17380353,Ian,"Nice, quiet apartment for our family of 4 in a great area of town. Easy transit access to downtown and lots of restaurants, parks in walking distance. 3rd floor of a 3-storey walkup - we were there on a day when it was 33 Celsius outside so the apartment was a bit warm, but cooled off overnight. Sheldon was friendly and helpful."
1773803,15300235,2014-07-07,7760640,Tyler,"Sheldon was very nice. He accommodated our arrival time and showed us around. Place has a lot of character as it is over 100 years old, which we like! sinks did not drain as it was stated an issue from last BNB guests possible pouring something bad down drain. Also remember to close living room window during hot day as bugs from alley way will find there way to the room. Other than that very clean could not have asked for better location, great food. Would recommend. parking on street is free from 8-8 and free on Sunday. Thanks again."
1773803,15617821,2014-07-13,12882549,Kirsten,Easy to book and meet to get a key. Very warm on a 95 degree day. Suggest additional fans. Great location and priced nicely 
1773803,15870470,2014-07-17,16263240,Amy,"Sheldon was accommodating about check-in and available by text.  Bldg was pretty much as described, but apt was clean.  Bed and couch were very good.  Refrigerator worked well (appreciated in the heat wave). Street parking was available after 8 or 9 pm but not after 8 am.  Wifi worked in the living room.  Quiet at night, even in heat wave, but a lot of morning noise.  Street scene is getting rougher."
1773803,16398401,2014-07-27,4565135,Steven,"I thought I already left a review. If so, post the previous one. If not here is a short version. Sheldon was very available by text. I responded immediately each time. His apartment is comfortable especially the bed. It is a nice location near the University. "
1773803,16704880,2014-08-01,13466899,Mandy,"Sheldon was a gracious host. He checked in with us during our trip and gave us places we could check out. The apartment is large and the couch is comfortable. It was quite warm during the day but cooled off nicely at night. We weren't home much during the day for it to matter. We were woken up in the morning by noises in the alley. Parking is almost impossible, but Sheldon did point us to the neighborhood adjacent and we were able to snag a free spot on the street. Overall, it is exactly as described. "
1773803,16847160,2014-08-03,17376939,Christine,"Sheldon was a great host! He was very understanding when we ended up checking in later and he periodically checked up on us making sure everything was alright. He also gave great tips for places to go to. His building is definitely 100 years old and has no AC unit (people don't use it in the NW). The apartment was quite humid and dark during the evenings. In the mornings, we were constantly woken up by loud noises from the street. However, the location of the apartment was great and parking was pretty easy to find. The apartment is very close to the downtown area. "
1773803,16911602,2014-08-04,2506555,Daniel,"Sheldon was super friendly and gave plenty of ideas for neighborhood restaurants and things to do.  The apartment is situated in a somewhat dingy building right in the center of a lively series of blocks filled with shops and inexpensive restaurants catering to students (think Telegraph, Berkeley).  The apartment itself is large, with three rooms and an open galley kitchen.  You won't be doing any serious cooking (nook table's small, only three spoons, etc.) but with the many restaurants around, this isn't an issue.  In general a functional apartment with a friendly host and a location central for the university."
1773803,17149919,2014-08-08,12174892,Austin,"Great location, a block from UW. Sheldon was accommodating with our arrival time, and informative with regards to local eateries and sights.
With that being said, the actual room was in a building that is 100+ years old, and has issues that come with a building of that age. It's on the third floor, and with no a/c you will roast during the summertime till the sun goes down. No need for an alarm because the garbage truck will be sure to wake you up daily at 7am since you'll need those windows open for circulation. We also experienced a dirty bathroom and kitchen that unfortunately may not get much cleaner at this point (even if someone had cleaned the tub; we'd also advise bringing your own towels.) The wifi will likely only connect if you sit by the front door of the apartment as it has a terribly, weak signal.
Overall, we would not recommend it to friends and family so I wouldn't recommend it to you. Similar priced listings in other bigger cities have provided more and at better quality."
1773803,17232951,2014-08-09,613725,Remi,Large apartment that had a big U shaped couch which had ample space in addition to the bed. The building is relatively old but the apartment itself clean and well furnished. 
1773803,17292638,2014-08-10,12189416,Jeannette,"This was our first experience with AirBnB, and I have to say it was mixed. Sheldon seemed rushed when he greeted us, and he never mentioned the wi-fi code, but he did let us drop off our suitcases when we arrived at 12:45 and the previous tenants had not yet left. We appreciated that.

The neighborhood was pleasant, and the apartment is spacious and reasonably clean, though hardly immaculate. We were grossed out, however, to find only a bottom sheet and comforter on the bed, with no top sheet or duvet. Worse, Sheldon asked us to straighten it when we left (rather than removing the sheet). It seemed pretty clear that the next guests would be sleeping in it, and we assumed it probably hadn't been changed after the previous guests left. 

The building, too, is pretty down at the heel. The dead flowers in several of the windows add to the atmosphere (in a creepy way). Overall, it was okay, but barely."
1773803,17749120,2014-08-17,15744937,Peter,"The apartment is in great location, easy access to all the amenities, like bank, supermarket, restaurant and campus.  The host also very helpful to arrange the transportation between airport and apartment.  We enjoy the stay."
1773803,17967894,2014-08-19,1200281,Drew,Sheldon did a great job with our first experience on AirBnB. Convenient location and great place to stroll around during down time on our trip.
1773803,18012171,2014-08-20,8678995,Ruth,"Since we came to Seattle to visit the University of Washington, Sheldon's place right on University Ave. gave us just the right location and feel of a college campus.  We found easy parking nearby and enjoyed the view out the windows of the city lights.  Restaurant options abounded.

The building is urban, college gritty and like most of Seattle doesn't have AC but Sheldon had cooled the summer heat nicely with plenty of fans.
We slept well and it was just the perfect place for us to stay!"
1773803,18132916,2014-08-22,15240346,Sam,Amazing location and place to stay. Shel was responsive and courteous. Highly recommend. 
1773803,18221439,2014-08-23,853272,Chris,"Great neighborhood, excellent views, very comfortable apartment and great price. There were even earplugs in the night stand! Couldn't have asked for a better host. Thanks!"
1773803,18669135,2014-08-30,19133603,Kelsi,Check in/out was super easy but place wasn't clean enough. Location was easy to get to downtown on bus. 
1773803,18729905,2014-08-31,16223662,Rohan,"Good apartment if you're looking for a place to crash for the night. Sheldon wasn't available when we arrived, but his friend Mark was helpful.  He answered all my texts in a timely manner. 

There was a ton of street noise in the morning,  but that was expected from other reviews.   The bed was very comfortable.  Towels were super crunchy,  so I'd recommend bringing your own.   Only one roll of toilet paper,  which could be risky.  

The U district was a good college town,  but a little grunge.   Good restaurants around and easy to lyft or uber places.   

Overall good experience for our first time in Seattle."
1773803,18876050,2014-09-02,16186977,Jennifer,"When you first see the bldg., do not be disheartened! I see why Sheldon doesn't post photos of the exterior.  The bldg. is old with a neighborhood reminiscent of Berkeley, a bit grungy, a bit rundown. Homeless youths were drumming in the foyer of a nearby Kaplan’s testing center; at night, several homeless were sleeping on the steps of nearby offices; the odor of grilled meats and garlic filled the air for most of the day and night. 
Fortunately, the bldg. has a locked main entry door with three flights of stairs to the unit. No elevator. The unit is in the far back of the bldg. and is surprisingly quiet given that the main façade faces the Avenue.  We had a bit of a snafu getting the key. Sheldon was not around as host and his friend Mark had the key. Unfortunately, we were late in meeting Mark and Mark had a baseball game to attend. We did eventually get the key by meeting Mark at the Mariners game, so it all worked out in the end.
The unit is as advertised: a fairly clean, fairly quiet place. There is one main bedroom, a large living room, one small bathroom, a small sitting room, and a kitchenette. Unfortunately, the kitchen sink was backed up when we arrived and Mark was not able to fix it. 
Sheldon provides soap, shampoo, toilet paper (nice touch – TP rolls in the kitchen drawer), towels, sheets, and ample amounts of coffee (terrific selection) and coffee makers.  He also has suggestions for restaurants which he places near the front door.  Several fans in the unit help to circulate air as it can become warm on the top floor, even for Seattle. The bathroom is small, but the hot water is immediately available. Currently, the only mirror is a small one in the bathroom. 
The décor is late 20th century graduate student – I was having flashbacks to my own experiences as a grad student, down to the ancient harvest gold rug in the living room and the generic posters. The living room has a very large sofa sectional on which we planted our two teenaged sons. Sheldon also supplied wi-fi directions and where to get the best reception in the unit. Pls. be aware that there is no TV or phone. BYOD (Bring Your Own Devices).  We had a rental car and did not take public transit. Parking is paid Mondays-Saturdays, but free on Sundays. We had no problems finding street parking, but it was a Labor Day weekend w/ no college events.
Overall, if you are looking for a convenient place near the University, don’t mind reliving your grad student days (or are a grad student), then give Sheldon’s place a try. Just make sure to be on time to get the key!
"
1773803,20843390,2014-10-06,20559416,Tai,"The location is so convenient and the Sheldon provides all stuff you may need when you live in. It's so considerate.
U Disc is really a good area and Sheldon is very nice to share all useful information, including dining, supermarket, farmers market, bus route etc, which are all quiet useful.
So I really enjoy the stay in Sheldon's apartment. "
1773803,21286980,2014-10-14,14806710,Savitri,"Hi,
The apartment location is very good for the university and for downtown. "
1773803,21409663,2014-10-16,22441157,Roger,I had a family emergency occur the day we were planning on staying at Sheldon's so we didn't end up staying at his place. We did meet Sheldon and he was personable and accommodating. The neighborhood is in the heart of the teeming University district with many ethnic eateries right on the street of his apartment. The location is a great base from which to explore Seattle. 
1773803,21432821,2014-10-17,14692120,Nicole,"host was flexible about arrival time and gave good transit suggestions...he carried a super heavy suitcase up the stairs to the 3rd floor for us!
ideal location for getting a sense of UW..."
1773803,21568023,2014-10-19,22596731,Filemon,We had a great stay in the heart of the University District. Our host met us at the front door and gave us a tour of the apartment. The apartment was very nice with a great view of the Space Needle! Clean linens were available and the apartment had everything we needed. There were tons of great international restaurants in the immediate vicinity. Our stay was very enjoyable and I highly recommend this listing to anyone wanting to stay in the University District of Seattle.
1773803,21726319,2014-10-22,21504032,Natalie,"My boyfriend and I had a great stay at Shel's place in the University District.  The apartment was clean, warm, quiet during our Saturday-Tuesday stay, and Shel was an accommodating host. He was easy to contact and welcomed us into his home.  If I have the opportunity to visit UW again I will definitely try to stay here again."
1773803,21857033,2014-10-25,21752150,Mark,"I was late arriving to the city and forgot to notify Sheldon of my tardiness. He touched base to make sure I was doing okay and then we worked out an alternate plan. Sheldon was very flexible and the apartment was great! The couch was super comfortable, as was the bed."
1773803,22032722,2014-10-28,22084628,Carmen,Sheldon was there to leave me the key. Gave us a tour and also some recommendations. Apt was good size. There were plenty of sheets and towels for use. Went during October so the apt was pretty chilly at nighttime. There was a heater and extra blankets for use. Thanks for hosting Sheldon!
1773803,22284938,2014-11-02,23167891,Zachary,"Sheldon was very accommodating as our travel plans changed last minute a couple of times. The apartment is located in a very central area in the U District. It was spotless and comfortable, with plenty of space. I would highly recommend this space to anyone staying in Seattle for a few days! "
1773803,23442963,2014-12-01,22509071,Alberto,"We lived in Sheldon's apartment for a month, and we felt like at home, Sheldon was very very attentive with us and helped us to practice our english, we went with him to some funny parties and he recommended us a lot of nice places to dance, eat and have fun. Sheldon's apartment is pretty wide and so clean, near many restaurants, a brewery, clothing stores and the UW. We really had fun staying in U-District. Thanks for hosting Sheldon."
1773803,23617747,2014-12-06,12429415,Ian,Sheldon was great and very responsive. This is a fantastic location for the U and the apartment is really good also.
1773803,23767985,2014-12-09,18889849,Jani,"I chose Sheldon's listing for my trip with my sister because she's hoping to go to UW and it's right near the campus. It was perfect for us and Sheldon was very accommodating and responsive when we had issues and questions. It's a nice amount of space and perfect for giving my sister an idea of the university area. It's kind of out of the way, as far as tourist attractions go, but since it's right next to several bus lines, that wasn't a problem. It was perfect for us and we definitely recommend it. "
1773803,23957894,2014-12-15,5435637,Dane,Sheldon was a great host. My flight was delayed so I arrived to the apartment much later than expected but despite the hour Sheldon was still warm and welcoming. The apartment was as described with everything needed for a comfortable 4 day stay. It was in a fun part of town with tons of restaurants and a very short walk to the UW campus. Would stay there again.
1773803,24443619,2014-12-28,1356655,Jamye,"thank you sheldon ! 
our trip to seattle was fantastic, your place is a perfect base to explore from.  "
1773803,24930802,2015-01-04,16570778,Rebecca,"Sheldon was easy to connect with and let us into the apartment as soon as we both could get there. I really appreciated how he kept in touch via message/email and showed us around the apartment. The space itself is very welcoming, in a no-frills, student-life way. We really liked the neighborhood (lots of cafes and restaurants, close to where else we needed to be) so the morning noise didn't bother us -- it was great to be in the perfect location for our Seattle trip."
1773803,25239269,2015-01-10,2708115,Neil,"Sheldon was a very welcoming host. He was kind enough to extend an invitation to a potluck event, and made sure to check in on us to ensure our comfort. The location of his apartment was perfect - one street over from the campus and surrounded by excellent restaurant choices. The wifi did not work very well in the evening, but other than that, I would recommend Sheldon's space to anyone looking to visit the campus."
1773803,25772115,2015-01-25,608554,Laura,Sadly I never made my trip (boo!) but Sheldon was great. He totally accommodated my travel pals and was apparently an A+ host! Thanks again and hopefully I'll make it to Seattle soon!
1773803,25825353,2015-01-26,26366176,Shea,Sheldon was a gracious host and the accommodations were welcoming. He gave us great advice on eateries as well as other activities to do. He is easy to communicate with. The apartment is in a great location.
1773803,26356842,2015-02-10,25176586,Greg,Sheldon was very accommodating and helpful.  He gave us lots of good ideas for things to do in the area and he didn't freak out when we broke one of his pots and a wine stopper.
1773803,26607803,2015-02-16,22302102,Julie,"Sheldon was friendly and helpful while giving us privacy. The location was perfect --it was centrally located and accessible to everything. The apartment itself was very comfortable, private, and had great views.
"
1773803,27675264,2015-03-09,6475297,Kim,"Sheldon was a great host and met me as soon as I got there. The place was very quiet inside and spacious. I wasn't thrilled with the location at night at first, but felt safe once I was more familiar with the area. There is only paid parking nearby, if you rent/bring a car.

Sheldon checked in on me the first night to make sure everything was good and it was. Bed was super comfortable too. Thanks!"
1773803,27733630,2015-03-10,28026378,Claire,"Sheldon was a great host! He invited us to a party the night before out stay and was accommodating to us checking in late that evening.
The place was beautiful. Big windows, lots of comfy furniture, food, clean, and great location. You can tell he cleaned between guests and was a very welcoming guy. Overall, he was a great host and his place was wonderful!"
1773803,28463527,2015-03-24,24166723,Megan,"Thank you very much for the stay! Although Sheldon wasn't personally available when we checked in (he gave us advanced warning), he gave us clear instructions on who to see in order to get into the apartment and when I texted him with questions he responded almost immediately! The location was incredibly convenient for our friend's wedding, but was laso steps away from myriad restaurants, bus stops, and Zyp cars. The location was extremely quiet...the only real sound was that of a few neighborhood seagulls, despite being in the middle of the U-District!"
1773803,28684279,2015-03-28,29069079,逸婷,"Our stay is perfect. Sheldon is very accommodating, and the house has everything we need. "
1773803,28763520,2015-03-29,1385116,Sandra,"This apartment is an excellent value in a high priced, lively, convenient neighborhood. The price reflects the somewhat spartan, bachelor-pad aura and rather worn condition of the building.  Hey, luxury costs! The unit served our needs well, except for the noise level. We are probably more noise sensitive than many urban travelers so it might not be an issue for others.  Sheldon had the place clean and tidy for us.  We appreciated his encouragement that we use whatever we needed in the apartment. Glad he pointed us toward the Portage Bay Cafe for breakfast, just a few blocks away. Great tip."
1773803,29246776,2015-04-05,17824338,Georgia,"Sheldon was an easy going, yet still prompt and professional host. I booked very last minute and he was prompt in responding to my request as well as responding to any questions I had during my stay. The space is roomy and comfortable, and I really enjoyed the unique old space. I look forward to staying here again sometime."
1773803,29347421,2015-04-06,13874664,Heather,"Had a nice stay. Prompt easy check in, host did a nice job of showing us around the apartment and recommending a couple of local restaurants. The neighborhood around the apartment is near the college so there are plenty of food options and there's a nice brewpub two doors down, my friends and I had a fun stay."
1773803,29635385,2015-04-10,249723,Marianne,"The apartment was conveniently located and Sheldon was generally responsive. The apartment also had everything I needed. However, it was not very clean. Not horrible, but floors appeared not to have been swept, counters not well wiped, etc. Also, for some odd reason there were yellow light bulbs in the living room, making it dim and sort of weird. Sheldon did not respond when I complained about the cleanliness level. It felt like a student level apartment."
1773803,30052195,2015-04-16,4107277,Celena,"sheldons place is in a good location to be in the heart of university district and close to downtown seattle. There are plenty restaurants around the neighborhood. I didn't meet him personally but he left the key for me to acess. The building condition is a little shabby but I think it is the age and there isn't much he can do about it. I think the price should be a little lower for what it was but if you consider having the entire place in somewhere like seattle, it isn't bad."
1773803,30259787,2015-04-19,8256779,Tom," Located in the very busy neighborhood near the University. Good access to public transport. Great location if you are without a vehicle, otherwise parking is VERY challenging. Either expensive and inconvenient or you have to park 5 or more blocks away to park for free. 
Apartment is on top floor and quiet. A bit worn but works OK. My girlfriend had to clean the toilet before she would use it and there was only one towel that kind of smelled. Carpet could stand replacing. Bed was comfortable. Overall not a bad experience, in retrospect not sure it was worth the price. I'd recommend it for a lower fee but if we ever return to Seattle will choose somewhere else."
1773803,30591267,2015-04-24,15040243,Patricia,"Sheldon was there to welcome us & show us around the apartment. He was very resourceful with information about parking, eating & other points of interest. The apartment comfortable with great view to Seattle. The WiFi extremely poor. "
1773803,30981876,2015-04-30,19449483,Ken,"Kommunikation med Sheldon var effektivt og uproblematisk.  Jeg mødte ham aldrig, men hentede blot nøglerne i sandwich-butikken nedenfor.

Lejligheden ligger midt i et livligt ""latiner-kvarter"" med masser af restauranter, barer, mm.. Lejligheden ligger dog væk fra gaden, så der er ingen larm overhovedet.

Internetforbindelsen er ikke særlig hurtig, men den er god nok til mail og surfing."
1773803,31277262,2015-05-03,31551223,Reiner,"Sheldon was very accommodating, had everything thing we anticipated for the stay. Made for a great weekend in Seattle, located right on University Avenue. Would definitely stay here again and met all our needs."
1773803,31797601,2015-05-10,28010382,Bing,Great experience and wonderful neighborhood. Thank you Shelton for being such a great host!
1773803,32475887,2015-05-18,767152,Nichol,"Shel's apartment was just as promised.  Close to lots of great restaurants, basically on campus, and plenty of shopping.  While it is in the heart of the U District, the apartment was quiet and peaceful at night.

Check in was easy and Sheldon was responsive and helpful.

The bed is comfy, the couch is luxurious and there is plenty of space.  The WiFi is pretty weak - so don't plan on a lot of Netflix, but checking email etc. was fine."
1773803,33981033,2015-06-03,17014513,Nina,"The unit is spacious and big. It have mostly everything I needed in general. Location is awesome!
However, I feel like the blankets are not super clean. And wifi is super duper slow, or it's on/off all the time."
1773803,34569469,2015-06-09,34139804,Justin,"Sheldon is a nice person and so is his apartment! This apartment is very close to UW campus. There is a big bedroom and a living room. And there are also a lot of restaurants around it.
"
1773803,35198767,2015-06-16,27860555,Meg,"Sheldon, we had a great visit! Thai Tom is our new favorite restaurant!  :)  Thank you for everything & all the best!  "
1773803,35354129,2015-06-17,35646050,Brian,"Location, Location, Location!  This place is perfect if you want to be in the University neighborhood of Seattle.  The apartment is roomy for 2, kids can sleep on the sofa.  Sheldon met us personally to show us the apartment.  Tuesday is garbage day in the street below and it is kinda noisy."
1773803,36005891,2015-06-24,29812131,Eve,"First, some positives:

- Public transportation is steps away.
- Dozens of international restaurants are right out the door.
- Good water pressure and hot water.
- Towels and sheets galore.
- According to our daughter, the sofa was very comfortable for sleeping.
- Minimal neighbor noise.
- Aside from flies wandering in from the outside, no bugs!

Now, the negatives:

- Both ceiling fans were broken and so we had to open the windows despite a floor fan; this let in lots of flies where screens were absent.
- The apartment backed up to a very noisy alley. Garbage pickup (see flies, above) started as early as 4:30. Earplugs in the nightstand (some used) were ineffective when a truck was dropping a restaurant dumpster right out the (open) window.
- As others mentioned, the internet was weak.
- As someone mentioned, the carpet was stained and probably needs replacing.
- Speaking of the kitchen, there were...issues. I wasn't expecting anything fancy, but it was barely functional. As someone mentioned last summer, utensils were (still) lacking: two soup spoons, one butter knife, plates for approximately three for one meal, no large pots or pans, no storage containers or wraps, no measuring spoons or cups, dying microwave. (Meals were...challenging.) The kitchen was dirty—not only the dishes and pots, but also the insides of the drawers, fridge and freezer.
- Things were worse in the bathroom. Simply put, it was filthy. The tub needed a good scrubbing, the rubber mat was mildewed, and dusty soap scum covered everything. And, we aren't convinced the sheets and towels were clean before being put out.
- I found a clump of hair and a stepped-on vitamin/pill beside the bed.

In-betweens:

- While Sheldon furnished lots of toiletries, they were stacked around the bathtub and vanity, leaving no room for our own stuff. Additionally, there were no empty drawers, cabinet or food storage space.
- The closet was spacious but had too few hangers.
- The only mirror was on the medicine cabinet door.
- The living room light bulbs were yellow.
- Laundry facilities consist of one shared coin-op washer and dryer on the second floor.
- The smoke alarm died beeping in the middle of the night.

I know it's an old building—I live in one myself—but many of these things can be addressed cheaply (and for about the $25 'cleaning fee'): plunk down $10 for a door mirror from Target, grab a handful of plastic (not bent wire) hangers, pick up some cutlery, have extra alarm batteries on hand, and (this is important) vacuum and wipe the bathroom and kitchen clean. Others are aesthetic: consolidate single toiletry bottles (or buy a new $3 bottle of Suave every guest stay or two), toss the dead plants on the fire escape, use white/clear bulbs, paint over ceiling stains instead of smearing a dirty cloth over them.

It's clearly a bachelor pad/college-type place, but as for a 'jewel' we expected something a bit more polished."
1773803,36216926,2015-06-26,5775807,David,"In the heart of the university district.totally secure building. No elevator, FYI. And even though there's no air conditioning, the fan was awesome. Sheldon was a gracious and accommodating the host. Great view, including the space needle. Unexpectedly quiet. Would recommend particularly if you want an urban environment. Lots of room in. It's all good particularly for the price"
1773803,37317773,2015-07-06,3920992,Michael,We enjoyed our time in Seattle and in the apartment.  We found the bed to be comfortable.  If you're looking for a simple and inexpensive place to crash at night and explore the city by day this is a good option.
1773803,37569957,2015-07-08,15760087,Edie,"My husband and I were greeted by Sheldon almost 15 minutes late after the 3pm check-in time to give us the keys and show us around his apartment.  He was very quick in his initial meet & greet, and the apartment and neighborhood was not what we expected.  We didn't stay the entire time at that location and ended up at another airbnb location in Seattle."
1773803,37939025,2015-07-12,5301880,Ian,Sheldon's place was comfortable and suitable for the night we spent there. Sheldon was a bit late for the check-in but furnished us with supplementary linens and supplies when we asked.
1773803,38447821,2015-07-15,29133234,Chelsea,"The neighborhood was great, and the host was attentive. But, the unit itself was very dirty and didn't feel like it had been cleaned in a while. We only stayed for 1 night, and I am glad that we did not stay longer in that unit. "
1773803,38536922,2015-07-16,37175734,John,"Great place! Spacious, clean, and unbelievably convenient to the University District. Sheldon was a great host, and check-in / check-out was a piece of cake. Highly recommended!"
1773803,38859621,2015-07-19,34941777,Heather,The location and the space was described adequately. Sheldon was very responsive to my questions via messages. I would stay there again!
1773803,39733763,2015-07-26,18681108,Florian,Die Nähe zum Unigelände war für uns ein großer Pluspunkt.
1773803,40104040,2015-07-28,34919255,Amy,We had a great time in Seattle. We were unsure of when we would arrive so Sheldon arranged for us to pick up he keys close by our place. Once inside the place was clean and bright. The main complaint  was the noise at night. There were people in the alley behind us as well as the garbage trucks came each morning very very early. The carpet was a little questionable. The area was neat as we had not stayed in this part before.  
1773803,40612054,2015-08-01,36432243,Thomas,"The location is excellent for food and restaurants and it is around a $15 uber trip to downtown Seattle.  The apartment was a third floor walkup which is OK if you are able to walk up three flights.  This fact should be made more clear by the owner in the description.  

The apartment was pretty clean except for the rug which was fairly beat up.  It was more like a college apartment than an older person's apartment.  In general it was clean but fairly beat up.  It lacked a TV and only had a wifi which worked sporadically.  The furniture and appliances are clean but older.  The bed is very squeaky.  The sheets and towels were adequate.  There are enough amenities for cooking but once again old stuff and there is no dishwasher.  There is very little space to eat a meal.  It only has a little nook in which the table takes up the whole space.  The bathroom was clean and the shower had good pressure.   The bedroom  is incredibly noisy outside because it faces an alley where garbage trucks come at 4 in the morning.  It also has no A/C which was brutal because Seattle was unexpectedly hot when we were there.  We had to leave the windows open which didn't help much and the birds woke us up early along with the garbage trucks.  Installing a few simple box ACs would have made it much more comfortable and killed some of the outside noise.   

In general the apartment was clean but it needs updating to be a more special experience.  If you just need somewhere to crash for a night, this is a good choice. But if you wish to be more comfortable while in the apartment, this may not be the place for you."
1773803,40719193,2015-08-02,1931685,Samantha,"Sheldon was a responsive host and his apartment is in an excellent neighborhood. I appreciated the convenient location, comfortable sleeping spots and nearby food options. Thanks Sheldon! "
1773803,42537171,2015-08-14,18791158,Alexandra,"Cool neighbourhood. Great location for eating out, and for public transport. The apartment is bright and spacious and quiet at night."
1773803,42726569,2015-08-15,37376383,Scarlet,"It was my boyfriend and I's first time using AirBnb together; I had used it with my family previously. Sheldon had put out extra blankets in case we were cold. Though, there was an issue with the key and getting in; the directions weren't very clear. The first door gets into the building, the second door gets you into the hallway, and the third get you into the apartment. The neighborhood was cute and college town-like. The description of the listing was accurate, except we couldn't find the air-conditioning that was listed- the multiple fans provided kept us cool enough. Not having a tv was strange, but only staying one night worked out great. We didn't even try to use the wifi due to previous reviews of it being spotty. A portable DVD player worked out great."
1773803,44096116,2015-08-24,13307998,Patrick,"Sheldon was very accommodating.  The apartment was exactly as described.  There was plenty of coffee and tea available, as well as basic pantry items.  The apartment does overlook the skyline, and is right in the center of the U-district.  I was using the apartment for its proximity to the campus, and I was glad I went with this cozy and secure apartment.

Good communication with Sheldon throughout the process, and would stay here again when returning to the area."
1773803,44445875,2015-08-26,316965,Mary,"This space is a great spot for visiting the University of Washington.  It's right next to campus and surrounded by good cheap eats. Sheldon told us to use the streets to the west to avoid paying for parking and that was helpful.  It's bright, but really a college apartment.  It's a great value but you have to be ready for beat up and stained carpet, a not especially clean bathroom, a well used couch and so-so towels.  As others mentioned, the alley noise is pretty incredible.  I'm not sure why trash trucks came both mornings we were there, but they came loud and proud.  Pack your earplugs :)"
1773803,46507045,2015-09-11,4076408,Eidan,"We had a little trouble getting a hold of Sheldon when we first arrived, but it all worked out in the end.  Great location."
1773803,46629898,2015-09-12,25042757,Emily,"The neighborhood and location or wonderful and very easy to catch the bus downtown. Sheldon left some info for local restaurants and things to do, which was nice. The apartment didn't feel as clean as I was expecting but the apartment served its purpose."
1773803,46848435,2015-09-13,24951604,David,Great place if you are looking to stay close to university.  Had everything I needed. 
1773803,48007761,2015-09-22,27675317,Angela,"We had a great experience - photos were accurate and host was responsive. He even invited us to an event in the city that we would have otherwise missed! 
The unit is in a vintage building in a college neighborhood, but the age of the unit and the noise of the neighborhood are offset by the host's welcoming attitude and a homey, bright, and comfortable spirit throughout. "
1773803,48699676,2015-09-28,2637943,Beth,"Sheldon's place was as described. I always read through the reviews thoroughly before booking a place and both agree and disagree with them. It's true, there is a lot of noise from the alley behind the apartment - both with the trash trucks and dumpsters and generally people just walking back there and talking. But I live in a city in an apartment that backs to an alley so it didn't really bother me. The apartment is very ""woo college!"" and took me back to my undergrad days. It's an old building with old furnishings. But I disagree with the other reviews that the apartment is dirty. Yes, the carpet has stains but I could tell that it had been recently vacuumed. Yes, the linens were old but I could tell they were clean. Yes, the shower is old but when you have an old, iron tub it's impossible to get it looking brand new. If you're looking for a nice, quiet place to spend your time indoors while in Seattle, this might not be the place for you. But I was on a work trip and the conference was at a nearby hotel and I just needed a place to crash and shower and Sheldon's place was great for that. There's no TV but the Wifi worked just fine for me to watch Netflix, listen to Spotify, and check email. I didn't use the kitchen at all so can't speak to that.

The only other ""downsides"" to the apartment were there weren't many three-prong plugs and the bathroom outlet wasn't working so I had to blow-dry my hair in the kitchen. Again, I didn't care but others might. I also had to keep my computer plugged in overnight in the kitchen because I worried the adapter in the bedroom would short my charger out. Also, I have sinus issues and have almost a constant runny nose and there weren't any tissues in the apartment. Not a big deal but I felt bad using paper towels so much. 

The area is definitely a crowded, college strip. There were quite a few homeless people around but again, I come from St. Louis where there are lots of college kids and homeless people so I wasn't shocked. I never felt unsafe. It's not my kind of ""scene"" with all of the young kids and hole-in-the-wall restaurants but again, I wasn't staying in that neighborhood for pleasure. I did eat from the sub shop below the apartment twice and the food was really good and the service was very nice. There's also a Starbucks two doors down which was nice. 

My flight got in late and Sheldon arranged for me to pick up the keys from the sub shop, which was easy enough. 

Overall, this is a great place to crash if you need to stay in the University District and if I have another conference in the area I will definitely stay here again! "
1773803,49150563,2015-10-01,43608661,Joel,"The location was great to travel from, awesome cheap eats around the general area and only a 15 dollar uber to the market place. Sheldon was a little behind schedule when we met up with him but we were a little bit late on our check out so it was fine. Really the only thing I can complain about was the smell from outside. It was the most intense raw sewage that permeated through out the building that was almost unbearable. So we had to use air freshener to mask the stench. Other than that it was close to amazing gyros and crepes...."
1773803,49342621,2015-10-03,41951415,孙莹,还是不错的选择 但是只有一张床 三个人还是有点挤
1773803,49551615,2015-10-04,36233499,Keira,Great little apartment! There was a little mix up with meeting times but it was a great experience over all. I will definitely stay here again 
1773803,49899172,2015-10-07,40608719,Richard,"A descrição do apartamento não confere com o que encontramos, a começar pela foto de apresentação; a vista da pone e da cidade não existem.
O anfitrião não foi nada atencioso. Retiramos a chave numa pizzaria, no mesmo prédio, e, a subirmos ao apartamento, foi uma decepção só. Carpete imundo, sofá sujo, banheiro microscópico, toalhas usadas no banheiro, roupa de cama usada, lixo cheio na cozinha. Quando liguei ao proprietário, este informou que outros hóspedes haviam deixado o apto e ele não teve tempo de limpá-lo. Eram 15 horas, e ele informou que só poderia tomar providências por volta das 20h!
Foi a pior experiência ad viagem."
1773803,50456559,2015-10-12,10857133,Zebin,"This apt's location offers great convenience for everyone who want to explore the beautiful campus of UW by walk, and many downtown attractions within 15 minutes drive. It's equipped with everything you need for a warm and comfort night. "
1773803,50818351,2015-10-14,99566,Jake,"The place is located in a great part of Seattle with cool trendy and ethnic restaurants all around. It is Seattle so parking can be rough but there is free parking west of the apartment you can find. Internet at this rental is slow so be advised if you have work you need to do online. Luckily there's great coffee shops all around in case you need to hop onto some faster internet. This is a big rental! You have lots of space, the host Sheldon is kind and happy to help you out. I recommend this rental. Mahalo!"
1773803,51103162,2015-10-17,46665396,Jordan,"What a great find in the middle of the University district. With all the amenities of home and ample space, Sheldon has provided travelers with an awesome space to explore Seattle from. "
1773803,52077794,2015-10-26,43877321,Travis,"Sheldon was extremely helpful and accommodating.  For my first experience using Airbnb, everything was just great.   "
1773803,53759528,2015-11-12,18741843,Kimiko,"Communication from Sheldon was very good. The location of his property is right on University Ave. so if you have business at UW like I did, it will be perfect location.  The unit is spacious and is quite large for a one bedroom with bonus room and large living area. I was at UW for an interview so I only used the property to sleep and shower.  Unit is in an older walk up so be prepared to climb stairs as there is no elevator.  Sheldon provided plenty of towels, blankets, shampoo, and everything needed for the stay.  If you are looking for a 5 star property then this unit is not for you, but if you are looking for a spacious apartment centrally located by the U at a reasonable price then you will be happy with Sheldon's place."
1773803,54129319,2015-11-16,30612865,Yuan,和房东交接钥匙非常顺畅，房源描述完全相符，地理位置非常好，如果下次去西雅图还会选择这里。
1773803,55861450,2015-12-06,50059493,Brian,Sheldon was very responsive with text/email/phonecalls.  He was very flexible and offered good suggestions for easing my short-notice travel into Seattle.
2459519,29854127,2015-04-13,7262954,Kristin,The house was perfect! Such an Amazing view and in a great location. Megan as well was a perfect host. We couldn't not have been any happier with our stay!! :)
2459519,30902192,2015-04-28,4275049,Ashley,"We were a group of 8 adults and a toddler coming for work, and Megan's house was perfect for us. The views were great, the layout gave enough privacy and quiet for those who wanted it, while the kitchen and living area had enough room for everyone to be together. The heated floors in the basement bathroom were a welcome touch. Megan went out of her way to provide a pack n play and high chair for my son, which was much appreciated. The only thing that wasn't 100% perfect was that there was animal hair on the floors and furniture, so it might not be ideal for someone with allergies. Overall, we loved our stay. Thanks Megan!"
2459519,33265327,2015-05-26,20566236,Michael,"All I can say is ""wow."" Megan did a fantastic job at communicating with me the entire time - from the initial questions through post-checkout. The house is absolutely stunning, spacious, as neat as can be - yet, comfortable and relaxing. You know those homes (you wish were yours) that you see in magazines? This is one of them. The views are spectacular. The neighborhood is quiet and peaceful. The neighbors are friendly. On-street parking is easy. Great restaurants are just a few blocks away. Thank you, Megan! I'll be staying with you again. "
2459519,35072345,2015-06-15,28785618,Sunny,"The house was absolutely perfect for our family trip to Seattle. The location was conveniently near the University, Capitol Hill and just a short trip downtown. The views were spectacular and the surrounding neighborhood was beautiful. We were a short walk to parks and cafes. The kitchen was well stocked with spices/essentials and easy to navigate. 

Megan was extremely communicative and helpful, reaching out with suggestions about a week before the trip. She helped to ensure our small children would be comfortable and safe - with a few gates and moving some artwork/decorations, it suited our needs perfectly. She even went out of her way to pick up baby gear before our arrival. 

I expected that it would be good based on all of the reviews, but both the house and the magnificent house exceeded our expectations. Thank you!"
2459519,35917816,2015-06-23,30772532,Lay Ping,"Gorgeous house, with plenty of room for our large gathering--11 people slept and made communal meals very comfortably in the space. The fully stocked kitchen blew us away. Megan was gracious and very prompt with her responses to all my questions. Location was close to freeways and minutes away from downtown. A great experience overall, and highly recommended for groups our size."
2459519,37450513,2015-07-07,3018728,Nirosha,"We celebrated my son's first birthday and had all our family under one roof - and what a roof it was! The home was absolutely beautiful and perfect for the occasion.  Tons of light, decks, beautiful yard and just a great space for a group to gather.  It happened to be an extremely hot weekend so it was a bit warm, but there always seemed to be at least one cool spot in the house and Megan had left out plenty of room fans.  Megan was a fantastic host in general and even left us some homemade jam which was delicious.  We loved every minute of our stay and the surrounding neighborhood is gorgeous.  Highly recommend!"
2459519,41580904,2015-08-08,19606013,Yan,Great location! Nice host!Great view!
2459519,44279175,2015-08-25,25453361,Carlle-Lize,My family had a wonderful stay! The house was stunning with magnificent views in a lovely neighborhood. Megan was very helpful and very accommodating with all of our requests. 
2459519,45258398,2015-09-01,9510676,Natalie,"we LOVED our stay and immediately felt right at home in Megan's beautiful home. from the views, to the well stocked kitchen, to the incredible interior decorating our family was thrilled with the accommodations. we did have younger kids in our group of 10, and I was nervous about the all of the irreplaceable collectables from what look like many travels around the world, but we made it through our weekend with everything in tack. the home offered so many quiet places to have long conversations or just read a book and relax. and everyone slept well in very comfortable beds!  we really didn't want to leave and we'll look to stay with Megan again in the future. 

highly recommend!"
2459519,47613547,2015-09-21,29335375,Joan,"The house was great, lots of space for 6, very comfortable, great view, fully stocked kitchen, very homey, Megan was then when arrived, very welcoming, putting fresh flowers on the kitchen island. Lovely old neighborhood, great for walking, also convenient to freeway.  Beds very comfortable."
2459519,49585711,2015-10-05,8208960,Linda,Megan made us feel comfortable the house was well maintained and kitchen well stocked . We were there for our daughters wedding and had plenty of room . The views where great especially in the morning when the sun came up and lit up the sky red. Easy access to I5  . The neighbourhood quite and lovely. Beautiful gardens
2459519,50631070,2015-10-13,21503673,R,Our enjoyment of the home itself was limited by several issue including the expectation that cleaning fee does not actually take care of routine cleaning. The owner called to complain that we placed the trash in garbage bags outside the home. We listed 7 adults that would be staying in the home and she expected that we pay for excess water and garbage fees. In addition she initially complained how 3 people could take up that room for trash when there actually 7 of us. We informed the host a head of time about us hosting guests. I have never received such negative and hostile feedback from any host. We are neat and clean individuals. I would not recommend staying in this home unless you do not want to have proper use of the home and would just like to utilize it to sleep. It is a large space that sadly only provided limited enjoyment due to the host misrepresenting the property and her intentions. The home itself is large and has a lake view. 
2459519,55192162,2015-11-29,21180302,Ken,"Beautiful spacious home in a quiet residential neighborhood. We enjoyed the spacious well equipped kitchen which more than met our cooking and baking needs. The house was very clean and gave you the feel of staying in a well maintained home rather than the sometimes cold feeling of a ""for rent only"" house. Views were spectacular and the location is very convenient no matter where you are heading in the greater Seattle area. Would love to visit again in summer when we could make better use of the beautiful  yard and outdoor areas. "
823989,3294718,2013-01-06,2873359,William,"Liz was wonderful to work with, great communication.  Very fast to respond and in my case that was very important we were booking in the very next day.  The Apartment was wonderfully furnished and clean.  The beds were really comfortable and the kitchen was stocked with everything.  We traveled with our corgi dog and Liz was very gracious about his presence.  The location is 5 mins from the Ballard District, great restaurants and shops.  Thanks again Liz."

Liz was very understanding of our travel needs and very helpful with the facility and Seattle in general. Apartment was nice, the location was interesting. Definitely an eye-opener for us country folks! Easy location to downtown. Took the direct express bus and drove in - no problem."
