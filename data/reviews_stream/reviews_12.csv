Great roomÔºÅ
This is really clean and comfortable.
"
1606171,12800787,2014-05-11,5414124,Jerome,"Nice comfortable room with all the amenities.
Full kitchen, Full size Fridge and very quiet location.
The best part was it is a mere 50 ft. away from the 
public bus/rail link.  Easy to get downtown or airport 
without the hassle of traffic.
Daisy was a  wonderful hostess, giving me all the tips
and space I needed.  Highly recommended"
1606171,13004314,2014-05-17,12011861,Jamie,"Daisy was great! the location was perfect, super close to the Link Trains downtown, I was able to use them everyday I went downtown. Plus, really close to the grocery and walking distance from the lake. Daisy was a great host, willing to help and answer all of my questions. "
1606171,13112235,2014-05-19,12939180,Ruben,"Daisy's apt was perfect. Exactly as described, with detailed note cards and instructions on everything. Room and bathroom were very clean and bed was very comfortable. Daisy was also accommadating and flexible with our late arrival. Would definitely stay here again."
1606171,13172223,2014-05-20,13869607,Anna,"Daisy was a great host, really friendly and helpful. Her place was so clean and tidy and very homely. The neighborhood in seattle is nice and safe."
1606171,13288029,2014-05-24,1552159,Andrew,"Daisy is a wonderful host. Her place is convenient, comfortable and exactly as shown. Definitely recommend it if you're visiting Seattle. "
1606171,13420405,2014-05-27,7595807,Katrina,"Daisy was not personally able to greet us the first night (we had a very late flight coming into Seattle), but she was very good at communicating via email/texts beforehand and so we were able to let ourselves in without a hitch. The room and bathroom was kept clean/neat. She also left us with thoughtful directions written in little notes posted throughout the house to help us get acquainted with the place and the neighborhood. We easily walked to Seward Park/Lake Washington from her place and were just a 20~ min drive away downtown. I recommend Daisy as a host. Thanks again! "
1606171,13575123,2014-05-31,6727813,Cathy,Daisy is a delightful well organized host.   The space was comfortable with thoughtful amenities that made me appreciate her attention to detail.  I enjoyed the neighborhood and found it perfect for public transportation use as well as the fun little neighborhood whole food store.
1606171,13936996,2014-06-08,14987192,Bo,Very good place! I like it.
1606171,16113095,2014-07-22,2946496,M Cooke,"I thoroughly enjoyed staying at Daisy's listing. My room was exactly what I expected and needed.  Comfortable bed, bathroom close, secure wifi and a good coffee shop around the corner.  I had very busy days so I was not at the location much but it was a joy to come back to.  The area is pleasant and right up the hill from an amazing park Seward Park. I did not use the kitchen as I ate out with my son in Seattle. The coded secure entrance was easy and I did not have to carry a key which was nice. I ran into Daisy the last night and we had a brief pleasant chat. It was helpful that she was easy going with my arrival time. I thought it was helpful that she had a booklet regarding house rules and local shops and amenities. I would definitely stay there again!"
1606171,16281119,2014-07-24,13970494,Gail,"This was a very affordable and comfortable stay.  Daisy is very helpful and I was grateful for the vitamin for smoothies!   Neighborhood is nice - natural foods/health food store is a one minute walk away and a pleasant 20 minute walk to Seward Park and Lake Washington.
"
1606171,16427355,2014-07-27,17934336,Stephanie,"Daisy was warm and welcoming from the very beginning. We only saw her during the start and end of our stay, which was fine with us. The room was tidy and a good size. We appreciated its decor and homey feel. We also appreciated the small notes that Daisy left around her place to help us navigate our way around her place. Parking was easy and never an issue. Her door was number coded so we didn't need a key, which was convenient. Her neighborhood felt safe. Also, there is a lake super nearby if you want to get a run/ workout in. Overall, we'd strongly recommend staying at Daisy's. "
1606171,16695625,2014-07-31,15400620,Amy,"Daisy is so nice, and her home is cozy and a good place."
1606171,17174273,2014-08-08,10182204,An-Chu,"Daisy is a great host,she prepared almost everything you need at the room,the only thing you might need to bring with you is the hair dryer. During the summer the room will be a little hot at night~ Otherwise everything was perfect!"
1606171,17374987,2014-08-11,18228473,Chase,"Daisy was a very nice and respectful host during our stay, I have zero complaints or negative things to say about her! 10/10. The room looks as the pictures show, which was very fitting and comfy for a weekend stay especially with a memory foam bed like she had. The location of her apartment to the downtown area of Seattle made it conveniently easy for us to get around and avoid a lot of the freeway traffic (took side roads into downtown). This allowed us to have more flexibility in our schedule and time  exploring and less sitting in the car.  The neighborhood itself didn't seem ""approachable"" but if you drive around the surrounding area you get the sense that is how it setup and in the end we found no problems with a false sense of security.  I am glad we chose to stay with Daisy and would suggest to others that you do the same if you are looking for an affordable accommodations outside of the city yet within reason. 

Thanks for letting us stay at your place Daisy  "
1606171,17650713,2014-08-15,1781102,Lauren,"The room was pleasant and the photos were accurate. It's clear Daisy puts in a lot of effort to make the space comfortable for her guests. She provides entry to the apartment via keypad instead of a key, which made it really convenient for me, especially as we had different schedules and it would have been difficult to meet to receive and return keys. I only met her for brief moment in the midst of my visit, but she was very sweet and went out of her way to give me privacy."
1606171,17865720,2014-08-18,10086625,Jed,"My father stayed here but I got to visit with Daisy for some time on the first day. 
Daisy is extremely friendly and very knowledgable about her neighborhood and of Seattle in general. There will be no lack of ideas from her if you're looking for things to do. Her place is in a great spot. She's blocks from Lake Washington and blocks from one of the better up-and-coming neighborhoods, Columbia City. There's movies, music, food, etc. plenty to do. 
Daisy's place is nice and clean and my father had zero complaints. He's never heard of airbnb before and with this one stay, he's hooked. He loved everything about the stay. "
1606171,17989293,2014-08-19,15510558,Andrius,The communication with the host-Daisy was very swift. The room and house are very clean. I would say 10+ to anyone wishing to stay. 
1606171,18029683,2014-08-20,19579579,Raina,Daisy was so sweet and had helpful recommendations for our trip. We absolutely loved her home. It's so well organized and cozy. I'm so glad she was our first airbnb host!
1606171,18139085,2014-08-22,19579579,Raina,After traveling all day it was so nice to come to a cute and well organized home that provided a very helpful brochure on the bed directing me to tasty eateries and directions. The room was even cuter in person! I absolutely loved Daisy's helpful notes. Seaward Park is such a lovely area. 
1606171,18339880,2014-08-25,14614010,Kendra,"Daisy was very nice and welcoming.  I loved the fact she left little notes explaining how to use things or where things are, so you don't have to bother her every five minutes with questions.  I also loved how she installed a Keyless lock on the door.  "
1606171,18590585,2014-08-28,18363846,Tai,"This Daisy place is very good, perfect for 1-2 people. Daisy is very busy, it makes me feel that I have rent the whole apartment."
1606171,18908112,2014-09-02,20021471,Sydney,"This place is great!  Daisy is wonderful!  We were in town for a convention in downtown Seattle, and were mainly only back at the apartment to sleep. (It is a $15 uber/lyft to downtown).  We only saw Daisy once in 4 days, but she is really sweet and accommodating.  The neighborhood is very quiet, and seemed mostly Jewish.  It felt nice coming back to the neighborhood after such busy days downtown.  

Highly recommended, phenomenal deal!!"
1606171,18953412,2014-09-03,13753079,Jonathan,"Daisy was a very detailed host with instructions left in the room and notes everywhere.  That was important because with both of our schedules being busy, I only spoke with her on the phone and communicated by text.  Very comfortable bed and a nice, safe location.  I would happily stay there again and hopefully meet Daisy in person next time.  Highly recommend!"
1606171,19450511,2014-09-12,19258205,Courtney,"Daisy's home was perfect for my needs. I needed last minute room to stay in and luckily hers was available. Daisy was extremely prompt in her responses and her instructions very clear. I did not get to explore the neighborhood, however, my Lyft driver said it was a safe place to stay and a good part of town. It is about a $20 Lyft ride to downtown (I didn't get to use public transport from her house). The room itself is smallish, but cozy, clean, and very comfortable. Daisy was super friendly and helpful the next day when my other accommodations fell through, offering me a place to stay again if needed. I would definitely stay here again and highly recommend it. "
1606171,19578492,2014-09-14,21188825,Tom,"Tom: I would like to thank Daisy in person, and will the next time we stay here, her home is very nice, quiet, comfortable, and inviting.  The best compliment I can give is that we want to come back, and have recommend Daisy's place to our friends.
Yukie: I liked your sense of room decoration a looot! Thank you :).
Situation: We arrived just after midnight, after the entire neighborhood had gone to sleep, and left early again the next day in order to get to out next destination on time.  We are very glad that Daisy has the keypad for guests so that we did not have to disturb anyone when we came and when we left."
1606171,19618006,2014-09-15,20118702,Nels,Daisy was warm and inviting. Notes were posted throughout the area to help finds things etc..
1606171,19704886,2014-09-16,12367586,Elisabeth,"I booked my mom at Daisy's. The room was neat and had everything she needed, and the apartment and neighborhood are safe. The bathroom is shared. Daisy is friendly, easy-going, well-organized, and makes tea and coffee available to guests in the morning. Within walking distance of Lake Washington and Seward Park, at $55 this place is a great deal. 
"
1606171,19879074,2014-09-20,7861469,Bridget,The room was very tidy. Daisy had little useful notes around the room and bathroom for our information.  We only stayed for one night but everything was great. Thanks!
1606171,20055292,2014-09-22,1845921,Daniel,"I didn't had the chance to meet Daisy in person, I arrived late at night and left early in the morning, but the communication with her was always great, she replied to all of my messages and was always willing to help. 
The room is very nice, everything is well organized, and clean. The bed is very comfortable, and the neighborhood is very quiet. "
1606171,20419320,2014-09-29,13239796,LaKiesha,"Daisy was a wonderful, welcoming host, and I thoroughly enjoyed my stay at her apartment in Seward Park. The room was exactly as described and pictured in her listing. I loved all the little notes around the room and her apartment. Daisy's place had great access to public transportation (right on one bus line and about a 10-minute trip by bus to two light rail stations). There was a wonderful natural foods grocery store and a few restaurants just a couple of blocks away. I'd highly recommend Daisy's cozy, quiet room to anyone visiting Seattle. "
1606171,20553793,2014-10-01,7608910,Jessica,"we only had 1 night in Seattle but our stay was wonderful.the room was cosy and you feel like sleeping on a cloud in this bed.daisy is a great host.you will find everything you need.you can easily get to the city by bus.I highly recommend this place.
"
1606171,20822573,2014-10-06,2817719,Christina,"I stayed at Daisy's place for three nights on a solo adventure of the Seattle area. Daisy made coming and going very easy and was extremely accommodating to my late arrival. Because I was coming and going all day, It was nice to have clear directions/suggestions on what to do, see, eat, etc and not feel like I wasn't interrupting anyone's schedule. Daisy was also great about communicating throughout my stay. If you're a solo traveler looking for a comfortable, affordable place to stay, I recommend Daisy's place."
1606171,21014934,2014-10-09,22020240,Natalie,"The room was exactly as it is shown in the listing.  It was warm, welcoming, bright, beautiful, and comfortable.  The space was beautifully decorated and had a lot of professional touches.  Daisy has the gift of hospitality.  She was very friendly and made me feel very welcome.  I especially like the little note cards with instructions and tips.  The booklet with the rules, local eating places, and Wi-Fi instructions rivaled hotel quality booklets.  Although the inside of the space was wonderful, I did have trouble with the outside stairs.  I have old knees so carrying luggage up the stairs was just a bit difficult.  Otherwise, I enjoyed my stay very much.  "
1606171,21258023,2014-10-13,21385525,Brandi,"Daisy is a wonderful hostess with an excellent sense for decorating - her room is comfortable and stylish! I loved the Roku, the thoughtful touches (handwritten notes, toiletries). The proximity to Lake Washington and Seward Park is amazing, as is the close by coffee shop and natural grocery store.

Daisy was great about access to anything in the kitchen, keeps refrigerator tidy, and even washed and set out the Vitamix when I mentioned my hope of making smoothies.

She is great about providing personal space too. I highly recommend this room!!"
1606171,21325749,2014-10-14,13167177,Jisun,"Thank you for the pleasant staying in Seattle!
The house is very clean and comfortable enough to take some rest!
"
1606171,21629551,2014-10-20,17622793,ChiYo,Nice host! It was a good experience during the stay. I really enjoy the time there
1606171,21913634,2014-10-26,4205500,Nathan,The room in Daisy's apartment is very clean and well decorated. She was a gracious host and given the cost of comparable rooms in the Seattle area it was an excellent value.
1606171,22293043,2014-11-03,5778349,Istv√°n,"Daisy's apartement is in a very nice anq quite place. I spent there only two days, and only slept there, as I was away the whole day. I generally sleep badly in the first few days because of the jet lag, but the bed in the room was so comfortable, and the room itself so quite that I could sleep hours longer than I expected.
Although I met Daisy just for a few minutes every time I was arriving or leaving the apartement, she's really nice, and her small and lovely instructions put down all around the flat made me feel as if she were there all the time to help me.
I'd be happy to return to Daisy the next time when I'm in town, and would recommend her apartement to anyone who likes peace and silence."
1606171,22558588,2014-11-09,870066,Joan,"If they ever create an AirBnB dictionary, pictures of Daisy's room should absolutely be included under ""thoughtful."" My stay was so brief, but everything was perfect. 

My schedule had some unexpected changes and I couldn't make it in until very late. However, I was able to find her apartment and make it to my room with no trouble at all. The bed was fantastic. There were lovely little notes to explain the space so there was no confusion at all. 

It's located in a really wonderful neighborhood and is a short walk or drive from some great restaurants. 

I left my jacket there on accident after checking out and Daisy promptly contacted me so I could pick it up. I would absolutely recommend her place to anyone visiting the Seattle area. "
1606171,22714449,2014-11-12,19392474,Angela,"Daisy was a great hostess, she made me feel right at home. :) "
1606171,23129689,2014-11-23,6621873,S≈Çawek,Daisy made my stay very welcoming since this was my 1st time in Seattle. Easy communication and pretty good location made my stay very good impression on Seattle and people who live here. 
1606171,23283275,2014-11-27,764481,Andrew,"Daisy's place was comfortable, clean, warm and well located in Seward Park. She thought of everything a guest could possibly need and had a great little packet of information about the surrounding area. 10/10, A++, Would stay again in a heartbeat!"
1606171,23351867,2014-11-29,23880893,Tam,"Daisy was a great host,  she was personable and welcoming.  The room is as described.  The location is great,  we walked to a park at the lake,  which had a great view.  "
1606171,23542479,2014-12-03,14129709,Mia,"Daisy, Is a nice and knowledgable host. "
1606171,23565127,2014-12-04,12364968,Matt,The room os nice. Great on a short notice. Daisy is so nice. Highly recommended..
1606171,23976777,2014-12-15,11609929,Stephanie,Daisy was very organized and sweet. It was super easy to get in and out of her place. The bed was amazingly comfy. We were in and out of there really quick and were not able to meet Daisy but there were notes explaining where everything was. 
1606171,24315717,2014-12-25,24197342,Kevin,"Daisy was the perfect host!  I found her friendly and helpful at all times.  The room was exactly as pictured and she expressly made it known that I was free to set the room thermostat where I felt comfortable.  Bus access was actually better than she stated on her listing; the #50 bus is literally about 30 feet up the street from her door, and one transfer will get you do downtown, First Hill and Capitol Hill within 45 minutes (it only took me 30 minutes one day).  "
1606171,24511651,2014-12-29,25045932,Randy,"Daisy was my first Airbnb experience. She was an amazing host. She made me feel as if her home was mines. Her place super clean and very comfortable. The bed was so comfortable, it reminded me of the beds in a luxury hotel. She is located in a great community surrounded by restaurants, coffee shops, etc. Her were rules are simple and laid out nicely on a typed package. I will recommend Daisy to anyone looking a relaxing experience."
1606171,24682174,2015-01-01,12740772,Jeremy,Welcoming experience. Daisy is a real MVP. 
1606171,24798515,2015-01-02,25403478,Shey,"We felt very welcomed at Daisy's. She left notes all over so that we knew how to navigate seamlessly, and she even had a little print-out with wi-fi info, nearby spots to eat/things to do and etc- super organized/prepared! She was there to welcome us and directed us to Columbia City for dinner. The place is in a safe neighborhood, street parking was available right out front, and the rooms is super clean. She literally took care of ALL the details. It was just as though we were staying in a hotel, expect we received one-on-one care if needed. Truly a pleasure. Thank you!"
1606171,25121690,2015-01-06,1858249,Patricia,"I made a quick book reservation at Daisy's airbnb. It was very last minute, just three hours before I wanted to arrive. She answered right away with all the info I needed. Her place is wonderful....a very private room and bathroom. It is quiet and she leaves all kinds of notes around so the experience is very user-friendly. The neighborhood is quiet, safe and very accessible by public transportation. I parked my car on the street with no worry whatsoever. Daisy is friendly and welcoming. I will be staying with her again and will highly recommend her airbnb to friends and family also, who love to go to Seattle for a change of pace from Vancouver."
1606171,25250674,2015-01-10,10866213,Sweeny,Daisy is nice host. Her house is so nice.
1606171,25335742,2015-01-12,25573095,Micheline,"Daisy is the perfect host for those wanted a private Seattle experience! You can easily come and go without issues (there are a few house rules, but not burdensome) and the room is clean, quiet and the bed is comfy-great. I appreciated the desk and connectivity available - I didn't bring my electronics with me this time, but I would certainly see if ""Seattle's Best Rate"" is available again. Two amenities that were very special and exciting to me were the ease of driving into downtown Seattle using Rainier Ave South and Columbia City (where was that traffic?) and the proximity to the Lake Washington loop - it was nice to watch the ducks at the park and I drove home ""south and east"" along the lake - a big bonus that extended my relaxing time. I was also fortunate to be at the listing when Daisy was home for an evening and we had an unexpected delightful conversational encounter. I will go again AND I will check her FIRST next time. I had stayed at a Hilton Conference center the two preceding days and this was better - much better - by comparison! I will suggest that if I were coming to Seattle to move there, this might be an excellent spot to stay while checking out housing in the area. Super relaxing. Thanks Daisy! I hope in the future you will have space available for me in spite of this good review!"
1606171,25376935,2015-01-13,67191,Nadine,"We arrived later at night, easily let ourselves in. Set up was great, small space, but somehow felt comfy with everything you needed. The little notes around the space let you know  to help yourself and feel comfortable. We stayed a little later than the check-out time to print some documents. Daisy didn't mind at all, and was friendly."
1606171,25606372,2015-01-20,24987957,Jrlle,"I had a great experience at Daisy's place. Super easy to get to and located in a neighborhood that I adore. Her place was very comfortable, clean and she made it very easy to feel at home. Even conversations with Daisy made the experience that much more enjoyable. Thank you for a seamless experience =)"
1606171,25649374,2015-01-21,11347446,Lucy,"Daisy was a wonderful host. She was communicative and welcoming. She literally opens her entire place to me that night. Unfortunately I didn't get to meet her in person but she we very helpful and very responsive to emails. The place is exactly as described and is conveniently located. Bed was comfortable, slept like a baby. Parking was street parking but very easy to find one, I found one right in  front of her apt entrance. Truly enjoyed my stay. Thanks Daisy!"
1606171,25726913,2015-01-24,1503550,Maricruz,Daisy's listing was accurate. Comfortable room at a great rate. Neighborhood was safe. Plenty of street parking available. Daisy was kind and responded to messages quickly. Would recommend to others. 
1606171,26325946,2015-02-09,4524347,Garrett,"A delightful experience, no hitches or disruptions with the apartment. The place was clean and well kept and in a cute part of Seattle. The closeness to the supermarket, coffee shop and restaurants made for a nice walk to dinner after getting off of work. No complaints, I would stay again!"
1606171,26411338,2015-02-11,14851193,Alyshia,"Daisy was a great host. The room was clean and she was very helpful with anything we asked about! The apartment is a little bit further from the city than we had anticipated (a 45-50 minute bus ride into the downtown core) so we ended up having to drive, but otherwise it was in a safe and clean neighbourhood. Thanks for the great stay!"
1606171,26505813,2015-02-14,27338152,Bo,"Clean and nice. The condo is smaller than it looks in the photos, however."
1606171,26614650,2015-02-16,26392291,Keng,This was our first AirBnB experience so we really did not know what do expect. The room was very nice and comfortable. Parking was easy and the burger place next door was a real treat. We appreciate that we were given total privacy. 
1606171,26719294,2015-02-17,12260364,Cherri,"This was my first airbnb experience and it was safe, easy and comfortable.  "
1606171,26807291,2015-02-19,26384983,Jerome,"We loved the location, you can drive easily to many parts of Seattle. The place was clean and organized. We had everything we would need."
1606171,26931312,2015-02-22,21986356,Yuge,"First Airbnb experience, only $40/day, but far beyond my expectation. Nice room, hospitable landlord, prefect experience."
1606171,27081993,2015-02-24,17988453,Inge,"The bedroom is tidy, clean and comfortable. You will feel relaxed like at home. I recommend it to you."
1606171,28254503,2015-03-21,26922839,Dean,Not bad.
1606171,28367773,2015-03-22,29580458,Natalie,"Daisy was a lovely host! Even within the first couple minutes that we walked into the apartment we felt welcomed and comfortable. She genuinely cared a lot about us and our visit, which was very refreshing. "
1606171,28563171,2015-03-26,1523689,Kurtis,"This was a fantastic neighborhood to be staying in. Daisy's place has a great location. And she was so nice! For those few days I felt like I actually lived there and didn't feel like a host. If you're coming to Seattle, stay here!"
1606171,28631345,2015-03-27,24678293,Louise,"Daisy's apartment was very quiet and peaceful, with tasteful furnishings. She was very friendly and welcoming, providing me with all that I needed for a good stay. 
The location was perfect, as all I needed was good food nearby and a short trip to work in the morning."
1606171,28661568,2015-03-28,28525878,Jihan,Quiet and comfort. Overall it was good!
1606171,28759846,2015-03-29,29884313,Ben,Great room!  I felt very comfortable and the bed was fantastic!  Daisy is a great host.
1606171,28882196,2015-03-31,27716104,Nathan,Daisy was very welcoming and helpful during our stay. Her neighborhood is cute and has some nice local spots to visit. The room is just as pictured and the whole apartment was decorated with good taste! We really enjoyed our stay!
1606171,28998208,2015-04-02,28480267,Gabriela,The listing description was accurate.  The room was very nice and comfortable.  Her home is cozy.  The tea selection was great.  It was fabulous to have a desk.
1606171,29402625,2015-04-07,11711474,Sarit,"Oh My Gosh, We are so thankful for staying with Daisy.  In fact, right now I am at a hotel, and miss the homy feeling yet the privacy Daisy was so skillful to maintain.
Her willingness to help in any way, is an upscale service one cannot find even NOT in a hotel!
Definitely will re-book once in  seattle again.

strongly recommend.

1606171,29528201,2015-04-08,26922557,Alice,We had a great stay at Daisy's apartment. The bedroom was immaculate and included anything we needed--from notes about how to use the roku to a cup for coffee. She was very welcoming and responsive to texts. This is an awesome and affordable option when visiting Seattle! 
1606171,29872518,2015-04-13,7989908,Abe,Daisy is wonderful! Great place to stay.
1606171,30444269,2015-04-22,23859815,Michelle,"Our stay at Daisy's was awesome and more! We came to Seattle for a wedding and ended up loving this city! From the first day we met her son, he gave us some awesome tips on where to eat/things to see! The apartment was very cute and homey! We ended up forgetting our iPhone charger and Daisy even mailed it back to us! You can tell the type of person Daisy and her son, David is! If you're looking for a nice place to stay with nice people this is the spot in Seattle! Plus the neighborhood run to the lake is AMAZING!! (:"
1606171,30593536,2015-04-24,10459959,Subhendu,"Daisy, 
Is very nice person and very simple house rules.
She even offered me her parking lot while she clearly mentioned in the listing that there is street parking. Thank you.
The place was perfect for my stay and everything was included in the room including a tv, I never got time to watch any family guy though I had a sound sleep.
Thank you"
1606171,30621817,2015-04-25,20081495,Ryan,Daisy's description was accurate.  I caught a late flight into SeaTac and then had to pick up wheels before going to her place.  She was accommodating with clear instructions on checking in.  Her place was very welcoming and exactly as described.  Cozy room!  So good after a long trip from the east coast.
1606171,30857412,2015-04-28,478740,Tara,"I stayed in Daisy's lovely home for 3 nights. I wasn't there much as I had limited time in Seattle but the room was wonderful and Daisy had thought of everything so I didn't need to bother her. The bed is one of the most comfortable I have ever slept in and all the little notes were such a nice touch and very helpful. It is a distance from downtown but you have so many transport options. I didn't find it an issue. Columbia City is about a mile away, a good walk and it is a charming area. Nice restaurants and lovely vibe. Daisy was a wonderful host, was sorry we didn't get to meet. Would highly recommend. "
1606171,31292297,2015-05-04,50050,Alicia,"I got there on the link train, and then the 50 bus. She had everything ready to go for me! Very easy stay. Daisy was very sweet! "
1606171,31577605,2015-05-07,8018065,Gilles & Jillian,"We had a very nice  and restful stay at Daisy's place. Some local knowledge is always a good help and Daisy gave us the lay of the land. We enjoyed our 3 days there. Thanks very much, Daisy."
1606171,31727192,2015-05-09,12875371,Mira,"We had a cozy and uncomplicated stay at Daisy's. Everything was very well organized and clearly instructed. Thanks, Daisy! :)"
1606171,32030830,2015-05-12,32846335,Kerent,"Our stay with Daisy was great! The room was cozy, clean, bed was comfortable, and the decor was really nice. We were really impressed with the how thoughtful she was, she left notes with information, wifi etc. We got in the city taking the 50 bus and the link, which was fine. We took uber at night as the bus was really unreliable, so that is something to think about if you plan to stay out late, it was about 12$ from the link to the apartment and 25$ from downtown. I would recommend just taking uber if your out really late from downtown. "
1606171,32721966,2015-05-20,26827532,Xiaoliang,"Great experience living in Daisy's house and she is a nice and kind lady. It was a pleasure to talk with her after a long day. The room was really cozy but it was a little bit far away from the downtown although there is a bus station right downstairs. I wish I could stay longer and get to know he host better. Anyway, it was an unforgettable experience and hope to visit Seattle again!"
1606171,32842578,2015-05-22,582384,Garth,"Daisy has a conveniently located, sweet place. It's directly across from a great co-op grocery store, and easy access to several main roads in Seattle, but is very quiet inside and in the neighborhood. Although we only met Daisy briefly at the beginning of our brief stay, she was readily accessible by messaging or in the apartment, if needed. She provided excellent information in her pamphlets and guides. The WiFi was very helpful and fast. The room is a nice size for one person, comfortable for two, and well decorated with Seattle photos and prints. She has a digital lock on the front door, making it easy to come and go from the unit."
1606171,33303032,2015-05-26,17984699,Matt,Daisy's home is well decorated. It's warm and quite. A perfect place for trip accommodation.
1606171,33392018,2015-05-27,4910495,Hannah,"Didn't have a chance to meet Daisy, but she was very responsive and proactive about getting in check-in information. The room was quaint and perfect for our one-day stay. She left nice complimentary toiletries, and the room had everything we needed. Definitely worth the price! 


"
1606171,33483001,2015-05-28,18628006,Brandon,"Daisy was kind, clean, and let us do our own thing. Great price and a neat little neighborhood. "
1606171,33795089,2015-06-01,26444390,Austin,"Both Daisy and the room were wonderful. Everything was neat and clean and all the daily necessities were provided. Daisy was very nice and welcoming, even waited for us when we were late during our arrival."
1606171,33927525,2015-06-02,8449876,Lyle And Nicola,We stayed for one night at Daisy's place. It was just what we needed for a short stay. Very clean and tidy room and bathroom and we came and went as we pleased. The sheets and bed were extremely comfortable - we over slept 2 hours by choice! Thanks for having us Daisy! 
1606171,34242500,2015-06-06,33373978,Zihan,"Highly recommended! Nice location, ten-minute walk to the park. The apartment was very clean and the host was very kind. "
1606171,34923841,2015-06-13,12455079,Robert,Nice place to stay  - clean and quiet.  
1606171,34997585,2015-06-14,33873419,Lauren,"Daisy was very responsive and friendly in our communications before our arrival. The room is clean and comfortable, the bed is wonderful. She provided information pamphlets, transit passes and toiletries. None of which we needed or used, but was appreciated nonetheless. The neighbourhood is quiet, her neighbours are friendly. Would definitely recommend staying here!"
1606171,35386758,2015-06-18,32643418,Shirley,"Daisy is delightful.  The private room in an upstairs apartment is nothing fancy but very clean, comfortable and affordable."
1606171,36812059,2015-07-01,35581618,Al,"This was my first airbnb experience and Daisy made it wonderful.

Upon my arrival Daisy showed me my room and the rest of her home. Her place is clean and comfortable. I felt right at home.

Daisy had all sorts of information waiting for me ‚Äì from mass transit schedules to local dining and entertainment places.

I enjoyed discussing places of interest with her and gained valuable insight about Seattle. 

This was my first visit to Seattle and between my accommodations and Daisy's friendly personality I would recommend staying at Seattle's BEST RATE.

I would certainly do it again.

__aL"
1606171,37380744,2015-07-06,5353288,Jeremy,"My experience at Seattle's Best Rate was so awesome and I felt like this home was just equal to Marriott Hotel which it's my favorite hotel. The room and the place is very clean with no dust, well prepared for my stay. Daisy made me feel so welcome, just like home and I will highly recommend anyone to stay at their place when visiting Seattle. I will definitely come back!  The room that I stayed in had all the information that I need, tourist information, where the outlets to plug my charger, feel free to use the AC and provided coffee and tea in the morning. This really rocks! "
1606171,37716329,2015-07-09,35038453,Courtney,Our stay was everything we could have wanted. It was our first airbnb experience and we'll continue our trip with it. Daisy's place was more than accommodating and in the perfect location. Definitely drive to the touristy locations like pike place market but take some time to go to the lake in walking distance to her place and Columbia City.  
1606171,38047489,2015-07-12,34605644,Mike,"Daisy was welcoming when we arrived, and the place was exactly as expected -- very cozy, clean and accommodating. The apartment was in a nice neighborhood that was just up the hill from a large lake, which was great for early morning walks. There's a great organic grocery store around the corner, and many delicious restaurants a short drive away (check out the Senegalese place!!). Access to her apartment was easy with a door code, and she stayed in her room the entire time we were there."
1606171,38326558,2015-07-14,23162735,Marcus,Daisy was very welcoming and accommodating. The room and bathroom were clean and I felt welcomed in her home.
1606171,38899065,2015-07-19,1581651,Karen,Basic Lodging.  Daisy was helpful and responsive.  The room was comfortable and there was a window airconditioner that made it comfortable on hot days.  The location is convenient to Seward Park but they are moving the PCC natural market to one mile away.  It was easy to come and go at will.  
1606171,39222191,2015-07-21,36652830,Hannah,"Daisy was welcoming when we arrived and the room and bathroom were spotless. We had everything we needed. We had our own code to the door and could come and go as we liked. We stayed 2 nights and were out most of the time, and when we were in the apartment Daisy gave us our space, so we didn't get to know her too well, which was a shame! But I would recommend Daisy and her lovely home!"

1606171,39695146,2015-07-25,34921843,Raymond,Daisy was quick to reply and kept everything friendly and professional. The room was clean and every amenity I could need was provided. Daisy and I interacted in passing and always asked if I needed anything else. Her rules are simple and fair. It was a ten minute walk to the zip car and 15 min to the link rail. I recommend her room to anyone going to Seattle.
1606171,40519606,2015-07-31,35625839,Aaron,Daisy arranged for me to arrive when she wasn't home. The neighborhood feels safe and parking was plentiful and free on the street. Her dog is beautiful and one of the friendliest I've ever met. The room is nice and the bed comfortable.
1606171,40781790,2015-08-02,13615414,George,"I had a brief but wonderful stay at Daisy's place.  It was clean, convenient and comfortable, as advertised.  It is especially nice for folks who want to visit the beautiful Seward Park area, but it is right on the public transit system that efficiently takes visitors all over Seattle.  "
1606171,41138438,2015-08-04,39014423,Lauren,"Daisy apartment was cozy and fun.  She made it very easy for us to come and go without disturbing anyone.  She was helpful and engaging if we had questions, but left us to our privacy for the remainder of the stay.  The neighborhood seemed safe and there was a burger joint right next door.  Daisy left a ton of information for us about groceries, food, parks, and other nearby areas in the room."
1606171,41196664,2015-08-05,30376718,Ryan,"Daisy proved very accommodating to my 1am arrival (and shower) and 5am departure. Her attention to detail was hotel level with thoughtful touches, including optional pillows of different firmness. Great location, easy access & parking. Lots of amenities that I didn't use."
1606171,41804795,2015-08-09,37845774,Kenny,"Deciding to stay with Daisy was an excellent decision!  Daisy was extremely accommodating and really made me feel comfortable and welcome during my stay!  She's an excellent host and I would absolutely stay again.  The room is clean, quiet, and comfortable.  Her apartment is very neat and ""cute"" as we described together! 

The apartment is on a bus route and you're only minutes away from the light rail which can take you back and forth to the downtown area.  I would recommend renting a car if you must move around late as the bus stops running at around 10pm.

I have nothing but positive things to say about Daisy.  She's someone that you'll instantly feel welcome around.  There were plenty of small toiletries and conveniences that let you know that she wanted you to be there and be comfortable.

Overall, Daisy definitely gets 5 Stars.  If I could give her more stars, she'd absolutely deserve them with her hospitality and great attitude.  If you're looking to visit Seattle, do yourself a favor and stay with Daisy!"
1606171,41929649,2015-08-10,30376718,Ryan,"Daisy was more than an incredibly gracious and thoughtful host. In addition to thinking of many details, she is an engaging human being. She makes the most of the space and makes you feel like an honored guest. The guest room looks as advertised and is ideal for business travelers and tourists alike. The apartment is conveniently located to both the airport and downtown venues. The neighborhood feels safe, and access to the unit is easy and short from the on-street parking. This was my second stay in this apartment."
1606171,42293922,2015-08-12,34900491,Pat,"Daisy communicated effectively about the entry process and the amenities. She left helpful little notes as well. The room looks exactly as it is portrayed in the photo. I will say that it is the nicest & cleanest room in the apartment. Daisy was flexible about check-in & out time. I chose this listing because of its proximity to the airport. The building looks like it was a low-budget motel in a previous incarnation. I got there at twilight and the doors to all of the units are visible to all of the occupants and to the street.There are 21 stairs to the unit. I did not get to meet Daisy, so there was no opportunity for her to help me with my bags. Many of the neighbors had the doors to their units open since it was a warm night. So, if you are a woman traveling alone and seeking privacy as you come and go, you might not find it here. There was no breakfast in the AM, and I do prefer a well-appointed beautiful home with a gracious host who is present and a welcoming source of info and conversation for a lone traveller. This listing is titled ""Seattle's BEST RATE"" but I actually had lower rates elsewhere in Seattle with more amenities, more attractive and spacious homes, fantastic breakfasts and wonderful hosts. The AC in the bedroom was a nice touch, as is the proximity to the airport. "
1606171,42474560,2015-08-13,10281644,Tanya,"I was only spending a night in Seattle to catch a plane on the second day. I arrived late, but Daisy already set up everything and gave me instructions on how to access her apartment. It was a very nice bedroom with almost everything you need for a night's stay. I never got to meet Daisy in person though cuz I left pretty early the next morning.  In a nutshell - I enjoyed my stay!!!"
1606171,42597865,2015-08-14,11431389,Dominica,"Daisy made my arrival very smooth and easy.  Unfortunately we never actually crossed paths while I was there (I only stayed one night) but her home is very sweet and tidy, and the guest room was wonderful.  She has cheerful, friendly, and helpful little signs around to help a guest find things and get oriented to the space.  I felt very welcomed and comfortable in her home and would definitely recommend her spot!"
1606171,42802218,2015-08-15,16350750,Richard,"I stayed at Miss Daisy's room for one night and although we did not get to meet, she got back to me quickly if i had any questions. There are awesome notes left around the house which which helped me out with finding anything that i might have needed too.  The room was very neat and tidy, and the bed was super comfortable. 
It was easy to find street parking right in front of the building and its a short 15-20 minute drive to downtown. 
I would definitely book again, the next time I'm back in Seattle. "
1606171,42977730,2015-08-16,17195145,Arianna,"Nice and clean apartment, Daisy provided me with everything I needed, and was extremely responsive in communication. Very nice neighborhood as well. Strongly recommended for a short visit to Seattle! "
1606171,43703540,2015-08-21,16966695,Anton,"Daisy provided a great deal of direction by way of notes, print-outs and even a manual. The listing was as described, the rate was nice, the stay was pleasant and the neighborhood quaint. Be sure to note check in time is 4pm and this is very much a shared space, specifically, Daisy's home. "
1606171,43835025,2015-08-22,40611861,Jeanine,Very disappointing experience based on promotion.  Bedroom was fine but pillowcases were not clean and bathroom was dirty.  Apartment was on second floor with no elevator. Host was unfriendly.
1606171,44158714,2015-08-24,6340166,Paula,"Daisy was absolutely responsive and delightful to communicate with. All inquiries were very promptly (almost instantly!) replied to.
We ended up staying with dear friends who had previously thought they'd be away, and when their plans feel through at the last minute, we decided to stay with them, so we did not stay with Daisy."
1606171,44395359,2015-08-25,24580744,Zhili,my nice first airbnb experienceÔºåhelpful host and comfortable bed Ôºåit is goodÔºåthank you daisyÔºÅ
1606171,44792082,2015-08-29,38704845,Gilbert,Host was not wrong about AirBnB listing the spot a couple hundred feet away but it was easy to find! The room is very neat and the bed extremely comfy. Daisy was also very nice
1606171,45309012,2015-09-01,40234452,Chris,"Daisy has a really nice apartment, and the room was great.  Her apartment is located in a nice quiet neighborhood that is very enjoyable to walk through.  She is right next to Bent Burger and Cafe Vita which are both great places to eat/have coffee.  There is a bus stop right in front of her building, so it is very convenient to get to other parts of Seattle from her apartment."
1606171,45454531,2015-09-02,2028402,John,Daisy was super accommodating on a very short notice booking.  She prepared the room for me and made me feel very at home. We had a good conversation. The bedroom was cozy and you can tell she made a lot of effort to make her guests feel comfortable. I recommend Daisy's place.
1606171,46033903,2015-09-07,12295112,Alana,Our stay at Daisy's home was great! She thought of every detail and resource that we would need. Loved the notes and the coffee! 
1606171,46261088,2015-09-09,26919279,Johannes,"Wir haben uns bei Daisy sehr wohl gef√ºhlt. Das Bett ist perfekt, um einen Jetlag auszuschlafen. Die Wohnung ist sehr gem√ºtlich und pers√∂nlich eingerichtet. Das Preis-Leistungsverh√§ltnis ist super. Wir hatten keine Probleme mit unserem Auto einen Parkplatz vor dem Haus zu finden. Ein Biosupermarkt (PCC Market) liegt nur 1mi entfernt in Columbia City, - ein Traum f√ºr Veganer. "
1606171,46984189,2015-09-14,20428536,Yutian,"Everything was just right as the place was good for stay , the room and the bed was cute and comfortable , the bus station just front of the home it's make it easier to go to the downtown . Daisy was a good host who has a beautiful laughter ,easy going and very kind and helpful ."
1606171,47417034,2015-09-18,43485935,Danette,"What a wonderful host and comfortable stay!  I found Daisy to be very helpful and accommodating when making my reservation.  The room had everything I needed and the bed was very comfortable, hmmm, make that extremely comfortable!  
Daisy has arranged all to make her guests comfortable and to have everything they need.  Notes explaining everything from where outlets are located to a detailed map of the neighborhood for restaurants, walking trails and more.
A great place to stay!  Thank you Daisy!!"
1606171,49543479,2015-10-04,45169353,Jeffery,It is a very good experience to stay at Daisy's home. The room is clean and full of pieces of art. The host are very kind and generous. Daisy will provide informative answers to all your questions timely and properly. The neighborhood is good. You can walk 15 minutes to Seward park and you can see Rainier mountain in a clear day. It is a 5 star experience for me to stay at Daisy place. Thank you Daisy.
1606171,50045829,2015-10-08,45169353,Jeffery,It is a great stay again. Thanks for Daisy. Great host.
1606171,51501073,2015-10-20,1485890,Patrick,"Great room, comfy bed, nice desk to work at and a very pleasant and clean home and a wonderful host. Plus a bus stop in front to make getting to and from Seattle easy."
1606171,53937872,2015-11-14,48110720,Bella,"Daisy is amazing! She sets up everything we may use in the room. It's very convenient to take the bus to downtown, and easy to walk to the terrific park in the neighbourhood. A good place to stay!  "
1606171,54194216,2015-11-16,41152957,Greg,Daisy was the perfect host. She made me feel comfortable from the first minute I arrive. The place is very clean and comfortable and i had the best night sleep on that bed. Great sleep. I came and went as I pleased because she had an electronic lock on the door which made that easy. She is very engaging and a great host. Look forward to coming again in the future. Highly recommended
1606171,57481698,2015-12-26,51611775,Tao,Daisy's apartment is lovely and very clean. We enjoyed our stay there!
1606171,58075748,2015-12-31,17384146,Steve,"Daisy has been a wonderful host, as she has made the whole apartment (not only our room) beautiful and lively with decorations carefully thought. 

The room and everything within it is clean and tidy, and it's quite comfortable to live in. The room could be a little crowed for a party of two, however we managed to create more walking space when we put our luggage into the closet. The room is also equipped with a monitor which is cable enabled and also connected to Roku TV, although we did not have the opportunity to turn it on.

Daisy has tried her best to make her guests' trip and stay easy. For traveling, she has prepared a whole set of informative materials covering the local good eats, travel tips in Seattle as well as transportation guides. For navigating throughout the apartment, she has considerately labeled many items/areas to prevent guests from confusion.

For the neighborhood, it's perfect for us: it's close to downtown Seattle (~15 min driving); it's very quite at night (suburban area), and there are lots of parking around. We have not explored nearby, but we did have great experiences with a couple of local restaurants/cafes."
8409926,47602219,2015-09-20,17255757,Kaylene,This was an overall good first AirBNB experience. This bed is kind of like sleeping on a boxspring but the price was right and overall I cannot complain. One of the other rooms had a far more comfy bed from what another guest told me. 5 stars!
8409926,49826401,2015-10-06,9932372,John And Karolina,Everything as advertised. Five stars. 
8409926,49957123,2015-10-07,6909364,Arpith,Beautiful and clean home. Nice and quiet location. Easy process. 
8409926,50555698,2015-10-12,45013290,Nikola,"I spend 3 nights with my 2 children in the Family Room of Dario's house in September due to a visit to Seattle (actually Alessandro was our host at the time we were there). The house is located in a nice and quiet neighborhood. Transportation to downtown Seattle is easily available. The drive frome the airport was not long. The room was very clean and tidy and the  bed very comfortable. We had our separate bathroom with this Family room, which was nice, too. We shared a kitchen, dining room and living room with the other guests, who stayed at the house. All very clean and tidy. The ingredients for breakfast were amazing. We were able to help ourselves in the kitchen, preparing pancakes, which my children loved. We had nice talks with Alessandro and the other guests staying at the house, who gave us good advice on visiting and sightseeing Seattle. I can highly recommend this place and would always come back, if going to Seattle for a second time. "
8409926,50736504,2015-10-13,14572243,Stephanie,"Was quick and easy to book. Lots of amenities like shampoo, snax and coffee. Would book again."
8409926,53155691,2015-11-05,43099453,Stella,"My stay at this room was really nice! The bed and the room in general were really cozy and the breakfast was good too. I think the bathroom was kind of dirty because there were a lot of hair on the ground/in the shower but it's not a hotel so everything was fine and I really enjoyed it!
Thanks!"

8409926,53778729,2015-11-12,47922745,Zak,"Great place, met all my needs. The extras like kitchen and food were not useful do to the lack of microwave, pots and pans. Still that was extra so can not complain too much. I am grateful. It was hard to get a hold of Dario, never answered my questions. Sounds negitive, but I assure you it is all you will need"
8409926,53869947,2015-11-13,42522935,Andrew,"Listing description perfectly accurate, pleasant neighborhood.  Great stay."
8409926,53947164,2015-11-14,707398,Colleen,"This was my second room in same house. I extended my stay a night but the room I was in (Palais) was booked so I moved over here for one night. Even better as the bed was comfier and had its own bathroom.

Great, clean house with coffee, snacks, eggs, and bacon available. Sure beats the heck out of a Super 8."

8409926,55398001,2015-12-01,46480992,Patrick,Neighborhood was really nice!
8409926,55687726,2015-12-04,3457540,Carol,"My third visit to The Family Room (I like it for private bathroom) and still one of my favorite places to stay in this area. Close to Seattle but quiet and out of the traffic and noise. The house has updated kitchen's upstairs and down, living space and dining areas so plenty of room and nice surroundings.  "
8409926,56055938,2015-12-08,23166569,Sebastian,Great room private and host was really nice they always had breakfast and location was good
3925572,40453034,2015-07-31,8235,Lisa,"Sean was easy to communicate with, flexible about arrival and departure, and responsive to needs.  The house was clean, convenient and exactly as shown in pictures.  I had a good stay."
3925572,41838154,2015-08-09,39273926,Claudio,"It was a really nice place to stay, the description is accurate, you can take a bus to downtown right at the door, or walk for 10 minutes to take a bus to space needle, really nice people, nice room and living space"
3925572,42796461,2015-08-15,7727129,Cecilia,"Sean was a great host! We experienced a ton of traffic getting into Seattle, but Sean was really easy going and accommodating. The location is in a quiet residential space, close to the delicious Ballard district, and easy to get to. We were driving to Vancouver the next day so being north of the city was an ideal location. Plus, it's close to Discovery Park, which has great trails and a running path along the beach. We got to briefly meet Sean, and he was really friendly and even made us tea in the morning. If you're looking for an easy stay in Seattle, definitely recommended!"
2638086,12575978,2014-05-05,14476730,Erin,"The owners, Kelly and her husband Peter, were perfect hosts. Kelly welcomed us  with a nice card and basket full of goodies, maps and sightseeing brochures. We had a wonderful time getting to know Kelly and her family and are grateful to have  found not only a great place to stay but new friends as well.

The apartment itself was perfect. Easy access via a rear entrance, meticulous modern decor with lots of light, great kitchen with any appliance or utensil you could want, washer and dryer, etc. The bedroom was great as well with a closet, dresser, comfy bed, etc. 

The property is in a great location in the Admiral District of West Seattle. Just a few minutes to nice restaurants, the Admiral Theater, three supermarkets, etc. Alki Beach is just down the hill, and downtown Seattle is only 10 minutes away as well. We were very happy in this property and were sorry to leave! We would recommend it‚Äîand the owners‚Äîto anyone.
"
2638086,12696223,2014-05-08,5927525,Paula,"My husband and I frequently spend short periods of time in Seattle visiting family. We were new to Kelly's flat and to the charming neighborhood surrounding it. We enjoyed exploring on morning walks and stopping for cappuccinos at one of the barristas nearby.  
The flat is perfect for one or two people; it is Immaculate with a stocked kitchen, nice bath (great water pressure) and very comfy bed.  Kelly and her husband are friendly, gracious hosts. We loved our stay there, and we will be back!"
2638086,18306269,2014-08-25,13147240,Jack,"We couldn't have asked for a more ideal place to stay in West Seattle.  The Flat was comfortable and clean.  Kelly made our stay so nice with little touches of coffee and snacks.  Every question we had about the Flat or the area was easily answered.  Her location is very walk-able to restaurants, grocery stores, shuttle stop for water taxi to downtown Seattle, and drug stores.  We would stay again and heartily recommend this place to any couple."
2638086,18876430,2014-09-02,11920272,Serena,"Kelly and her family were great hosts, very friendly and helpful! My friend and I loved the room - it looks exactly like the photos. It was very clean and so welcoming. All the personal touches Kelly put into the room were so cute and thoughtful - the lotions, little notes everywhere, welcome basket. The area is perfect, close to the water taxi to Downtown and near a cute street with coffee shops and restaurants. I would absolutely stay here again!"
2638086,19081728,2014-09-06,6571931,Don,"Although my wife and I have visited Seattle before, we've never stayed in West Seattle. From downtown it's ""just across the water"" -- very nice as a quieter base (with excellent public transportation links) to explore Greater Seattle‚Ä¶ or to just see and enjoy West Seattle -- the beach, dining choices, the French bakery (a must!) etc.

Kelly met us at the water taxi and drove us to the well-equipped, spacious flat. It has nice windows, so it doesn't feel like a basement. Kelly and Peter seem to have thought of everything guests might want/need‚Ä¶ including some nice extras. Everything is spotless; the bed is very comfortable; good selection of TV channels. The kitchen is stocked with everything needed to prepare complete meals. A family could be quite comfortable here. We thoroughly enjoyed our three days. Don"
2638086,19592714,2014-09-15,5744159,Michael,"Kelly is extremely thoughtful and accommodating.  In addition to providing a place that is functionally perfect and aesthetically amazing, she keeps it spotless.  Upon entering, I felt like I was at a boutique hotel with all sorts of modern conveniences.  Their neighborhood is charming and perfectly situated for accessing downtown Seattle in minutes.  During our next trip to Seattle, the decision on where to stay is already made."
2638086,20959808,2014-10-08,11160131,Pat,"Great location and a darling place!  Clean, with everything you might need.  Kelly is a darling host.   "
2638086,21990730,2014-10-27,16023209,Blanca,"First and foremost Kelly was an awesome host. She was always available when we needed anything. I've rented through airbnb 4 times now since my daughter decided to attend SU, Kelly's place is by far the nicest and the space is spotless! My kids and I really enjoyed our stay. Thank you Kelly!"
2638086,22759305,2014-11-14,1581651,Karen,"This apartment was so comfortable.  It was fully equipped with everything that I needed.  Even though Seattle was having a cold snap, the apartment was warm and cozy.  I loved the convenience of being so close to everything in West Seattle.  I could walk to several markets, the library, an old movie theatre and many restaurants.  Downtown Seattle was just a water taxi ride away.  Kelly was very welcoming, helpful and responded quickly to any question I had.  She knew I would be spending time with my grandson and even provided a basket of toys for him.   Thank you Kelly"
2638086,22870172,2014-11-16,23583625,Cassie,"We had a wonderful time during our stay in West Seattle. Kelly and Peter's flat is fantastic. It is beautiful, clean and cozy and was stocked with everything we needed and more! Kelly even supplied a high chair, pack n play and toys for our kiddos, not to mention a bottle of wine and some goodies for the adults! We used to live in West Seattle and we love that we have found such a sweet place to stay when we visit!"
2638086,35999295,2015-06-24,25028528,Laura,My husband and I recently stayed at Kelly's basement flat during our anniversary trip to Seattle.  We really loved our time in West Seattle and Kelly was an excellent host!  Kelly had a welcome note and basket waiting for us when we arrived and she stayed in touch throughout our visit to make sure we had everything we needed.  The basement flat was very clean and had everything we needed during our stay.  It looked exactly like the pictures.  There are several restaurants within a few blocks and it is not too far from Alki Beach.  There is also a water taxi that is very convenient if you want to travel to downtown Seattle.  We would recommend staying at Kelly's place if you are looking for a great place to stay during a visit to West Seattle!
2638086,36372540,2015-06-28,20281136,Larissa,"What a lovely stay! A beautifully appointed suite with everything you could possibly need for your stay. Kelly, Peter, Enzo and Diesel were all super friendly and had a very easy way about them. Very considerate and thoughtful hosts. Our stay in West Seattle was a great time. We enjoyed walking around the neighbourhood and exploring Alki Beach. The Water Taxi to the city is super convenient too. Thanks so much for the warm hospitality and great communication."
2638086,44759208,2015-08-29,31437961,Isabelle,My kids and I stayed here for nearly 2 weeks. It was very comfortable and amenities such as a large kitchen and washer and dryer made the stay quiet easy. There is a great grocery store and many restaurants within three blocks. Easy access to Seattle and Alki. We will be back!
2638086,45157207,2015-08-31,29188042,Blair,Great apartment - very comfortable and the location is perfect.  Awesome West Seattle neighborhood and easy access to downtown via cab or water taxi.  Kelly checked in with us after our arrival to make sure we had everything we needed - great host.
2638086,51753669,2015-10-24,44858088,Mary,Perfect location for us. Our son was only a few blocks away & it's a lose walk to Admiral Birds for breakfast! Very nice having a washer & dryer to use. Will definitely recommend this cute basement flat.
2688555,13492112,2014-05-28,4387579,Kevin  Yap,"We have had a memorable experience staying in Shawn's apartment house.  Shawn is very friendly,  attentive and accommodating.  Besides its excellent location,  the apartment is spacious,  clean and fully equipped for home cooking. Anyway good restaurants are nearby and moving around in Seattle is not a problem from capital hill. I have no hesitation to recommend this apartment to anyone who wants a comfortable stay in Seattle."
2688555,13991224,2014-06-09,4177380,Lucas,Lovely place; Shawn was considerate and communicative and we had a very nice stay. 
2688555,15143358,2014-07-03,15945771,Prat,"Good central location within walking distance from downtown. Lots of neighborhood restaurants. Shawn was helpful. Clean, well equipped house. "
2688555,15765376,2014-07-15,482171,Melissa,"Our host was very attentive from the beginning!  The rental process was done efficiently.  There were no surprises upon our arrival and the directions on how to enter the home was easy and reliable.  Communication was open during our whole stay. Owner often checked in with us to see if we needed anything, but was respectful of our privacy.  The house was clean and well kept. It was easy to feel at home during our stay in Seattle.  "
2688555,15970539,2014-07-19,2350661,Vera,We had a very nice stay at Shawn's place which is quiet and clean and in a very nice and green neighbourhood with many restaurants and caf√©s. The room downstairs is perfect to sleep over a jet lag (the other room too!). Communication with Shawn was always perfect.
2688555,16204676,2014-07-23,15547959,Daniel,"Our stay at Shawn's home was above our expectations. From the start he made sure we had everything we needed and was very accommodating. The house is very comfortable, clean and well-equipped. The check-in/out process couldn't be simpler. Shawn continued to check in periodically throughout our stay, making sure we had everything we needed. The location is excellent with great coffee and restaurants just minutes away. I would definitely stay here again! "
2688555,16576045,2014-07-29,17609291,Felix,"Shawn is very communicative, friendly and helpful. When I asked, whether he had a pack-and-play bed for our little one, he went out and bought one! Thanks for everything, we will come again! Comfy place with character and a nice collection of Asian artifacts in one one of Seattles best neighborhoods."
2688555,16986286,2014-08-05,16468872,Sandy,Our family had such a great time at the Capitol Hill home! It was great for all of us to be together and discuss our daily plans over our morning coffee. I felt especially proud when a neighbor stopped by and thanked me for the beautiful work that had been done on the house! I explained that we were simply guests in the home and he asked me to tell the owner that he and his neighbors are so grateful of the beautiful yard and exterior! This place was quiet and comfortable and conveniently located to the Capitol Hill area as well as downtown. We were able to walk and pick up our grocery needs as well as visiting several restaurants! We are looking forward to our next visit. Thanks so much!
2688555,17447966,2014-08-12,11865047,Lucien,"Shawn's apartment is on a great location in Seattle. It is a few steps away from all the funky action of Capitol Hill. At the same time it features the pros of a city neighborhood with quietness at night and parking for your car. The apartment is a portion of the house on the picture and was more than spacious enough for our family of four.
Shawn is a great host. He is very communicative during the booking process, the period between the booking and the check-in and during the stay. Shawn really takes care of you!"
2688555,17827515,2014-08-18,6599055,Marina,"Fantastiskt l√§ge, n√§ra bussar direkt till centrum - eller promenadavst√•nd f√∂r den som vill- och n√§ra minimarkets och cafeer. Kodl√•s ist√§llet f√∂r nyckel var utm√§rkt och wifi:n lyxig (mindre bra mottagning nere i k√§llaren dock, s√• t√§nk p√• att ha mobilen inst√§lld s√• att den inte surfar via mobiln√§tet med apparna n√§r wifi:n bryts). Vi var fyra som hyrde ""gatuplan"" och k√§llare med tv√• separata sovrum. Att sova i k√§llaren var i augusti relativt kyligt och ganska kvavt, men det fanns gott om filtar och jag noterade √§ven ett flyttbart element. Huset √§r stiligt inrett och rent. K√∂k & badrum √§r alla toppen fr√§scha och bra p√• alla vis. V√•r hyresv√§rd var mycket trevlig, hj√§lpsam, l√§tt att f√• kontakt med om alla sorters fr√•gor!

Men som sagt, vi hade bra mejlkontakt med Shawn). Vi √§r j√§tten√∂jda med hela vistelsen och v√•r hyresv√§rd!"
2688555,19023968,2014-09-05,16351182,Kaze,"I can't describe how awesome Shawn is.

The place was simply amazing, everything was very clean and organized. There was tags to tell you where you can and can't put stuff.

He even upgraded the router so we can enjoy a more seamless internet experience how awesome is that!

The beds were clean and very comfortable. Also there were futons in case you had a lot of guests booked.

Shawn made sure the house was very prepared before we set foot in.

Also the scenery was very beautiful and a joy to look at, compared to the other houses on the street. His stood out magnificently.

Thank you Shawn for having us there, we were enjoyed our time in Seattle. Thank you for being an incredible host."
2688555,19328488,2014-09-10,19859439,Veronica,"Shawn was incredibly communicative and so kind. He left a bottle of wine for the guests as a gift - which was just a classy touch. The house itself is beautiful and well kept. The location is absolutely amazing, walking distance or a 5 dollar uber away from all the best spots. I highly recommend staying here. "
2688555,20673766,2014-10-03,21128858,Christian,The host was amazing as far as having everything ready and spotless loved the stay I give this 6 out of five star rating. he had some great info typed out to help you if you are not familiar with the hood which is also helpful! loved the way it worked and very very kind!
2688555,21241883,2014-10-13,6155703,Richard,"Shawn was great and very helpful. He kept in touch and tried to let us know of anything we may need for our stay. The place is very nice and well kept. 

He also left us a bottle of wine for when we showed up. I'd highly recommend staying here if you need a place in Capitol Hill, the location is great."
2688555,21672080,2014-10-21,2009925,Chris,Shawn is a very welcoming host who's very accessible.  The property is in a great neighborhood and the apartment is very spacious.  The key situation is also great for a larger party that won't always be on the same schedule.
2688555,22077985,2014-10-29,3728881,April,"We loved Shawn's place. It was 4 of us and a 1 year old. Shawn was a great host and very accessible via text and email. He had wonderful recommendations and a book full of details about his beautiful house. He also had a pack n play and both beds were very comfortable. I really appreciated the empty guest drawers and shelves he left for us to put our things in. The house was very clean and tidy and walking distance from many cool restaurants and shops. 
We had a great stay and plan on staying again next time we are in Seattle. "
2688555,22607535,2014-11-10,9492005,Jake,"This place is great. 
The host, shawn, was very helpful before arrival with making sure everything we asked for was in place.  We specifically needed the garage and he made sure the space was clear.   The house is clean and in a great location not to mention an awesome yard. I would stay here again. 
"
2688555,23440846,2014-12-01,9580055,Robert,"We had a great stay in this beautiful Capital Hill home. Shawn is a truly great communicator and host. Everything was as described. What a nice location in Seattle, easy walking distance to stores and restaurants. Highly recommended. "
2688555,24952758,2015-01-04,23398008,Mary-Anne,Shawn was very warm and  welcoming. He left a many items that added to our sense of 'being 'at home'!
2688555,25198550,2015-01-09,6225893,Katherine,"We had a wonderful time at Shawn's place.  He was very easy to work with ahead of time, checking in frequently to make sure the arrangements were satisfactory. The access process was the best I have ever had it with an airbnb experience.  The location was fantastic, within walking distance of downtown and some great bars and restaurants in the Capitol Hill neighborhood. Sean left some very good recommendations for local places that we might not have discovered otherwise.  The place was immaculate and very orderly. The master bedroom bed was fantastic, with wonderful sheets. The parking space made things very convenient.  We really enjoyed the beautiful artwork and furniture throughout the apartment.  I would highly recommend staying at Shawn's place!"
2688555,27891522,2015-03-14,857682,Andreea,"The stay at Shawn's was one of my best Airbnb experieces. The house is big, beautifully furnished, and comfortable. The ""studio"" downstairs is well separated from the rest and you can almost use it as a separate apartment. I thought it was smart to clearly label the furniture with what's guest territory, and what's host's. It is not always obvious to know. Also, small detail but that counts from my point of view: the provided hygiene products (soap, douche gel etc) are very nice and original.

The neighborhood is probably one of the best Seattle has to offer. Two blocks uphill there's Broadway st with lots of restaurants, bars, coffees and all necessary businesses (grocery, dry cleaning...). Melrose Market is 10 min walk away - you can find there a great butcher and a great cheese shop. The well known Vivace coffees are on Broadway as well - but personally I preferred Analog Coffee, just one block down from the house. Going downtown is a 10 min drive, even less without traffic.

Shawn was very responsive and his communication style open, pleasant and clear.

All in all, a very good experience, and I definitely recommend Shawn's house. If possible I will use it again for future stays."
2688555,28367695,2015-03-22,25082694,Shannon,"Shawn was super nice and had great communication with me both before and during my stay.  From our exchanged messages I felt that he sincerely wanted my stay to be pleasant and comfortable.

The location is amazing!  It's so close to everything, but away from the traffic.  AND it has a private parking space (driveway) on Capitol Hill which is rare and awesome!

Shawn's place is well organized.  The kitchen had everything a guest would need, including unexpected things like a garlic press and corn on the cob holders.  I appreciated how things in the kitchen were labeled so that I knew which items were for guest use.  I also appreciated the quality of the furnishings (very comfortable mattress, high-end pots and pans, etc.).
"
2688555,28718183,2015-03-29,23791685,Rico,Shawn is a nice person.He's such hospitable that he even bought us a snack packet.He really cares about the experience and living quality during we stay in his house. The apartment is clean and I can tell he loves Chinese culture since the decorations are all related to Chinese elements. The house is convenient to anywhere popular in Seattle. I just used 15 mins to walk to downtown and pike market yesterday. There are some good brunch places and oyster bar nearby too. You should consider staying in Shawn's place when you visit Seattle!
2688555,29200695,2015-04-05,3561049,Jamie,"Shawn was very friendly, very prompt with his responses, and very nice to let me drop my bags off before check in time. Our group was busy and Shawn left us alone except to check in on us once and also to respond to a question. The location is fantastic - walking distance from downtown, a bus stop a block away, and Capitol Hill stores a couple blocks away. Some really delicious restaurants in the surrounding area, too. The house itself is beautiful. The only surprise was that both bathrooms are within the two rooms, so whoever sleeps on the futon couch has to go through a bedroom to access a bathroom. Our group rolled with it, but that scenario might not work for everyone. Great place and great host! Thanks, Shawn!"
2688555,29554709,2015-04-09,7787349,Pia,"Shawn was just marvelous and his home a real gem! We were visiting family in Seattle, and our party of 4 adults and 1 energetic toddler felt very at home in his spacious and lovely space. The little yard outside was nice for our son, and the house was walking distance to many eateries, bars and a nice park. Shawn was also very kind, responding to our texts very very swiftly and helped us in so many little ways that made our trip so memorable."
2688555,29909022,2015-04-14,26033235,Mollie,"We had a wonderful stay at Shawns house! The accommodations were very nice, the location was perfect for our work group to get all over town.  Shawn stayed in touch the whole time, should we have needed anything.  We're looking forward to staying again the next time we are in Seattle!"
2688555,30499454,2015-04-23,164521,Taylor,"Shawn provided a wonderful stay for us in Seattle. I was there for a conference at the convention center, which was easily in walking distance. Capitol Hill is an awesome neighborhood in Seattle. We pretty much ate every meal in the neighborhood and never at the same restaurant twice--all were superb. Shawn is a top-notch host who is always looking out for you, whether messaging to check in, providing tips and restaurant suggestions, or just making sure all is well. I highly recommend this place no matter the reason for visiting Seattle!"
2688555,31389668,2015-05-04,1678461,Aviva,Awesome!
2688555,31998070,2015-05-12,1763909,Anastasia,It was a very lovely house and Shawn was very welcoming and checked in often to make sure we had everything we needed. It was a wonderful experience.
2688555,32772761,2015-05-21,6926842,Gita,"I needed a place for my parents to stay while they were visiting in Seattle. My parents were both very happy with the space and amenities and said they would be happy to stay at Shawn's house again. It's a very spacious house and like the listing says, a rarity in this neighborhood. Shawn was very responsive before, during, and after their visit and was definitely interested in making their visit comfortable. The only small drawback for me personally as the trip coordinator/chauffeur was that that some remodeling/refurnishing was taking place at the time we stayed. This meant that the driveway was usually blocked with other cars and trucks and it wasn't a completely private stay during the week. This wasn't really an issue for us but others needing consistent driveway access or a totally private stay may just want to confirm this ahead of time."
2688555,33294677,2015-05-26,21126690,Scotty,"Shawn's home was fantastic.  There was plenty of space for my volleyball team.  I loved the fact that there was an upstairs and downstairs, which allowed us to spread out a bit.  It was also in perfect location for restaurants, shopping, and night life.  Shawn also was very accommodating to our specific needs. I highly recommend you consider staying with him. :)  "
2688555,33786624,2015-06-01,12897816,Sam,"We had a lovely time at Shawn's house (which is as singular as it looks in the image, there isn't much like it around). He was relaxed and clear about everything and provided us with what we needed. I realised far too late about Analog Coffee (one block down on Thomas), I would have happily spent the whole week there."
2688555,35776730,2015-06-22,24244061,Mark,Nice place with central location. Owner was attentive and overall good experience. 
2688555,38504371,2015-07-16,5136929,Amelia & David,"Shawn is a fantastic host, he is someone who goes beyond what a guest might need.  His attention to detail is quite great.  From the very start, each communication exchange with him has been superb.   His attitude added much more value to our experience to just finding a place to stay.   Shawn is welcoming & thoughtful and his house is beautiful, cozy & spacious. Walking distance to anything.   Highly recommend it. Thank you Shawn! :) "
2688555,40305017,2015-07-30,22861726,Justine,Shawn was a fabulous host. His house is beautifully presented with everything in it that you may need. The location is perfect. Walking distance to all amentites. A short drive or bus into the city. Shawn was always available for any queries we had. I highly recommend this house if you want a funky place to stay in Seattle. 
2688555,40967535,2015-08-03,17383844,Michael,This was a great home and a great host!  Shawn made sure that all was ready for us and the home was in great shape.  It is a very nice place in a wonderful location.  We were able to walk to multiple restaurants and coffee shops.  It was the perfect place to stay for our trip to experience Seattle.  
2688555,42769593,2015-08-15,33168991,Stephanie,Shawn was a very responsive host; the house was clean; check-in and out was easy; and the location was great. 
2688555,43921547,2015-08-23,34064405,Jen,Shawn was a great host. The house was comfortable plus a great location. Our flight was delayed and the instructions left in the house made everything simple. Thank you!
2688555,45239803,2015-09-01,31183511,Mark,"Shawn's Capitol Hill home was amazing! It was quite clean with tons of matresses to go around to fit 6 people sleeping comfortably.
The 2 bathrooms all had showers and was adequate. 

The neighborhood was quiet, and only 2 blocks away from the bustling pubs of Captiol Hill. Our group had a blast staying at Shawn's place for 6 nights. Definitely can't recommend this place enough! 

Having Netflix and Hulu Plus to look forward to at the end of the day  was the cherry on top of a delicious sundae of airbnbs!"
2688555,46400435,2015-09-10,40990505,Rose,Had a great week in Seattle; Sean was a very accommodating host and the house was clean and beautifully decorated.  The unit was spacious and the location was wonderful and very convenient for public transit to downtown as well as many things within walking distance.  Would recommend and would stay again when in Seattle.
2688555,53472489,2015-11-09,9492005,Jake,Great House in awesome location!
2727938,12026699,2014-04-21,9455436,Courtney,"Jessica's place was delightfully cozy and close to so many awesome sights, bars, and restaurants! Her apartment feels homey and relaxing and is a perfect fit for both long-term and short-term stays. Jessica was very easy to communicate with and provided everything we needed for our stay. Overall, it was a great experience, and I would definitely stay there again!"
2727938,12253729,2014-04-27,5019808,Amy,Loved. Loved. Loved this place! It totally felt like I was coming home to my own apartment! Had such amazing character. I feel like the location was PERFECT. Not too far from anything. Close to the bus lines to get around and in a really safe area. Would totally stay here again!
2727938,12303241,2014-04-28,516025,Elizabeth,"Jessica's apartment was great! It was on a quiet street, but it was still close enough to walk to everything.

Awesome view, too!"
2727938,12796905,2014-05-11,6011407,Elizabeth,"We had a really great time in Seattle, in part because of Jessica's place.  The location is really convenient and her place is a very spacious studio."
2727938,13720743,2014-06-02,9060366,Marc,"Jessica was a great host. Super helpful in getting us all the info we needed about the apartment. The location was awesome - easy 5 min walk to the action in Capitol Hill, close to downtown and quick drive to highway. Definitely recommend staying here."
2727938,15071025,2014-07-01,16665166,Wyn,"jessica was 10/10 stars. place was 10/10 stars. so many stars. but on the real- this place was wonderful to stay in, the neighborhood was lovely, and jessica had fun art on all the walls! art is cool! "
2727938,15733638,2014-07-14,11662704,Carly,"Jessica's spot was a great place to stay for a quick weekend visit!  It's about a fifteen minute walk downtown, also has some great restaurants and bars within 5 min walking distance.  The freeway noise was a little intense, probably because we had the windows wide open the entire time (heatwave weather and no AC!) however I'm sure it's not half as bad with windows closed.  Jessica was super friendly and it was easy for us to find keys/locate things.  Everything was super clean and it was a great space to be in for the weekend. "
2727938,19976270,2014-09-21,11276044,Ryan,The apartment was exactly as Jessica described it. She made it very easy to get the key and get in. The view was great. The space was small but perfect for a us. She made the whole process very easy. Love the indoor plants and unique art. 
2727938,20372549,2014-09-28,14793612,Katie,The space was accurately described in the listing and in a great location. Easily walkable to many restaurants and venues but if not cabs were in the neighborhood as well. The plants and fabulous art on the walls made for the perfect place to rest your head. I would absolutely stay here again!
2727938,25570386,2015-01-19,11083647,Scott,"Jessica was a great host! She was very responsive and polite in the email conversation. She gave hints and tips about public transit, places to see, etc. The place was in great condition and was exactly the way she described it. The apartment is definitely close enough to everything to walk, unless super rainy. Had a great time!!"
2727938,25700317,2015-01-23,22874654,Dmytro,"Jessica sent a clear instruction on how to get to the place, and when I arrived it was clean and tidy. The apartment itself is very nice, with a lot of extravagant and a bit grotesque details, so if you're into artsy stuff, probably you'll like it a lot. 

Can't say a lot about the neighborhood, because my visit was short and somewhat hectic, but it seemed quite nice and convenient."
2727938,25734128,2015-01-24,2135160,Allison,"Jessica's apartment is sweet with lots of lighting (a necessity!) and a nice little breakfast nook in the kitchen. Cozy, private, and lots of great art and memorabilia on the walls!

As far as the neighborhood goes, this part of Capitol Hill is probably my favorite bit of the area -- everything is walking distance but you're out of the thick of it, a handful of great bars/cafes/restaurants that don't have the intensity of the crowds on Pike/Pine. (Analog Coffee, Barjot, Sun Liquor.)

Jessica is an effective and efficient communicator and provided lots of information about the area, her apartment, and Seattle. Great host and great space! "
2727938,28267265,2015-03-21,5305427,Justin,"Jessica (Ish) was a great host and provided some really great tips as to what to see in Seattle. The flat is beautiful and really well decorated, very homely. The location was perfect for us too.

:)"
2727938,35236699,2015-06-16,27180454,Arielle,"Jessica's place was absolutely amazing! It was close to everything in Capitol Hill and she was extremely accommodating after I had to make a last minute reservation. The apartment itself is perfect for two people and has an amazing view from the kitchen nook. We came on a hot weekend in Seattle so we had to leave the windows open the whole time so the noise from traffic outside was a little annoying but not too bad. Jessica was easy to communicate with and left us with a detailed and extensive itinerary complete with a list of recommendations all within walking distance.
The location was perfect for us and we didn't travel with a car so we relied on public transportation which was easy for us to navigate and was so close by! 
Overall, it was a great place and even better experience. We would definitely stay here again. Thanks!"
2727938,37182601,2015-07-05,34606533,Keren,"The neighborhood cannot be beat! So many bars, restaurants, parks and shops within walking distance of the apartment! Jessica kindly had towels, bedding, coffee and a local brunch guide ready for me. She's a great host!"
3273240,14881091,2014-06-28,14422460,Rich,"This place is in the heart of Pioneer Square in a very cool turn of the century building.  The famous State Room Hotel sign is literally right outside the window and the many tours that pass by always point out this sign - so they all see your smiling face through these wonderful full-wall windows.  The hustle and bustle of Pioneer Square is exciting.  Keep in mind this is the heart of Seattle nightlife.  I walked to the baseball game, the pier, downtown Seattle - all very convenient.

The bed is very comfortable.  The apartment studio and building is very clean and has all the amenities you would need.  The kitchen is fully stocked, there is a great seating area, and the bathroom was very clean.  

Most important, Bonnie was great.  She answered all my questions.  I highly recommend this studio for a short or long term stay."
3273240,15081363,2014-07-01,16023239,Stanford,"Bonnie, Studio One is amazing. The location is perfect. I was making plans to move in immediately.   Bonnie is a terrific host and I am recommending this place first no matter who is coming to Seattle.  Thanks for the very nice bottle of champagne too!!"
3273240,15515330,2014-07-10,9081840,John,"Staying in Bonnie's space was the best decision we could made. Great location, lovely thought out interior and Bonnie was very helpful and communicative! Thank you, Bonnie"
3273240,15599165,2014-07-12,2155516,David,"My wife and I spent two nights in Bonnie's Loft.  It was amazing.  The restaurant under the loft was one of Bonnie's recommendations and it didn't disappoint.  The windows looking out on to the street were so cool and Bonnie gave us a little history of the building upon arrival.  I hope this place is available next time 
we're in Seattle.  

David"
3273240,16989026,2014-08-05,2346307,Naima,What a fabulous place to stay in Pioneer Square!!!! Every amenity was provided in the studio and was very clean upon arrival. There are so many great restaurants and shopping in Pioneer Square. For sure we will stay at the studio again when visiting Seattle. Thank You Bonnie!!!!
3273240,17454678,2014-08-12,670157,Josie,"Bonnie and Dean's place was the highlight of my trip to Seattle! Such a stunning loft, and very nice hosts. Couldn't have been better-- I highly recommend staying here if it's available! 

(We stayed in one night sitting by the window with wine and cheese from the grocery store nearby just to enjoy the place-- it was that fantastic!"
3273240,17851239,2014-08-18,11911515,Tracey,"The second we walked in the door, it was mind blowing.  What beautiful decor and extremely comfortable.  All directions provided to get to and in to the property were easy to implement.  We will certainly recommending to all friends and family and will hope to return soon."
3273240,18092162,2014-08-21,9580826,Jordan,"Big open loft with exposed brick walls, high ceilings, and a giant window out to the activity in Pioneer Square. Host is very responsive and accommodating. 

Considerations: The street noise at night might be an issue for light sleepers."
3273240,18276213,2014-08-24,5120597,Felicity And Curtis,"Studio One in Pioneer Square is not to be missed!  The location is within walking distance of both stadiums, loads of restaurants and pubs and just around the corner from the Smith Tower.  Notably a Starbucks within the same block and good parking at the Butler parking garage within two blocks.   The loft is a show stopper, tall ceilings and brick walls that frame an amazing 12 foot turn of the century arched window.  As mentioned the iconic ‚ÄúState Hotel‚Äù sign is right outside the window.   Two nice couches in the living room and a phenomenal Indian carved wood entry door encompass a very spacious seating area.  The king bed is super cozy- with a nice set of premium sheets.  Noise could be a concern, but even on a busy game night, the city sounds did not disturb our sleep.  Bonnie has thoughtfully provide ear plugs if you need them.  The loft has a fully appointed kitchen with lots of pots and pans if you want to dine in.  We had a fantastic meal at Il Teriazzo Carmine, located just a few blocks down-amazing food and fabulous service.  We also found Taylor Shellfish Oysterbar- wow- super fresh oysters shucked right in front of you (if you (email hidden)).   Be prepared that you won‚Äôt want to leave the loft, if it were a rainy day in Seattle you would be a happy camper!"
3273240,18660492,2014-08-30,11074357,Vincent,"Beautiful loft, prime location, and nice accommodations. Responsive host. Great stay in Seattle.  "
3273240,18883729,2014-09-02,16951992,Benaldo,"This place is fantastic, even better than the pictures would lead you to believe. After long days of hoofing it across town, this was the perfect place to kick back and unwind. Pull a chair up to the front windows and watch tour groups point out the 'Rooms 75c' in front of you. Kitchen is well-equipped as well, so we hung in and made dinner one of the nights we were here. Also, there are plenty of bars and restaurants within walking distance. Cannot recommend this place enough, and I hope it's available during our next visit!"
3273240,20622174,2014-10-02,21463015,Eli,Beautiful spot to stay a few days.
3273240,21299157,2014-10-14,21331556,John,"I recently spent 3 days at the Loft. I was sort of nervous about getting the key from the lockbox and not being able to get in, No problem at all,  I tend to worry too much. Anyhow, when I opened the door and took my first  look, I was blown away, the place looks so much larger and better in person. The decor is wonderful and so comfortable. I  spent 5 minutes just walking around and exploring. Everything was perfect and nothing has been left to chance. The kitchen is fully equipped for anything you might want to whip up. There is even a washer and dryer. The front window is spectacular, I loved just sitting there and  watching people walk by. The neighborhood is great, all kinds of  stores and places to eat. The light rail station is 3 short blocks away and there are also buses on the street in front. All in all, I really enjoyed my stay there, when it came time to come home, I didn't want to leave, this is truly a home you will love.

3273240,22563996,2014-11-09,23306924,Brittney,I had the most amazing stay! As the other reviewers have said the photos do not do the place justice its huge and gorgeous and was fully equipped with anything you may need for your stay. Bonnie was very accomodating and was quick to respond to any questions we had! Will definitely stay here again next time im in seattle!
3273240,23020752,2014-11-20,2619526,Carrie,Beautiful space!  Bonnie made everything extremely easy.  The restaurant downstairs (recommended by Bonnie) is fantastic.  Other reviews are spot on.  
3273240,23302831,2014-11-28,4456845,Mike,"Bonnie's home is lovely. Very warm and accommodating. She has thought of everything! We can't wait to come back. Amazing restaurant literally down the stairs. 

"
3273240,23658901,2014-12-07,22133854,Annie,"This place is absolutely gorgeous! Gorgeous. Bonnie was a fantastic host and the loft is perfectly located (close to the ferry, Pike Place, and all of the museums and central downtown attractions). There is some to-be-expected city nightlife noise on the weekends...but I would make this place my home base for future Seattle trips. P.S. Downstairs restaurant featured in Seattles top 25  cocktail destinations. "
3273240,24154493,2014-12-21,23586482,Richard,This place was great! Bonnie was very helpful and kind. Couldn't have asked for a better place to stay. It is in a busy part of the town but the noise level was very manageable. I never had trouble falling asleep. Thanks again!
3273240,24664707,2015-01-01,24416343,Noelle,Perfect! Exactly what we were hoping for- an authentic experience with all the luxuries and amenities. 
3273240,25320362,2015-01-12,11938103,Chase,"Wonderful experience, just what we were looking for. A beautiful place in the heart of historic Seattle, close to everything! "
3273240,25578123,2015-01-19,5008836,Adam,"Bonnie was a perfect, thoughtful and gracious host!! Her directions and recommendations were spot on! Also, the whole loft was well appointed with all the ammenities that make you feel at home;delicious coffee and biscotties for breakfast, a stove and all the utensils you need to cook a fresh meal from pikes place, high quality shampoos and conditioners that my wife loved.. everything was well arranged with obvious thought and care!  
As others have said, this place is amazing! The pictures do not do it justice!! My wife and I didn't want to leave and wished we lived there :) You cannot beat the gorgeous view of the window overlooking pioneer square. The whole loft is also well decorated with contemporary and complimentary artwork and antiques with some asian influence.  While there was some street noise, it was no problem, as it doesn't seem out of place for loft living in the original heart if the city. We had no trouble sleeping in the very comfortable king bed, and even if we did, Bonnie provided earplugs!  This loft will now be our go to lodging any time we come to Seattle, andbwe can't wait to come back!"
3273240,25910024,2015-01-29,21331556,John,"It is always a pleasure staying at the loft. Every time I am there I discover new places in the neighbor hood to check out. This part of the city is my  favorite, lots of charm and I love just walking around looking at the great old buildings. A nice addition to the  loft is the new TV, I like to watch the news every day.  I hope to stay here many times in the future"
3273240,26157414,2015-02-05,4847793,Alex,"This apartment gets the best of both worlds: while having all the historic loft features (old downtown building, exposed brick walls, 15ft ceilings, hardwood floors, enormous window), it still got all the modern amenities, too (a huge TV with Netflix, WiFi, a dishwasher, etc.).

Staying in a loft like this is a Checklist item."
3273240,26833660,2015-02-20,21331556,John,"This is my third visit to the Loft, I really enjoy staying there and bit by bit I am exploring the neighborhood, there are so many interesting things and places to go within a few blocks. Every time I stay, Bonnie has added a few new things to make the visit more fun. She really listens to people who stay there and makes changes as needed. All you need to bring are your clothes, everything else is provided, the kitchen has more to offer than my own. I look forward to more visits. "
3273240,29692711,2015-04-11,29957180,Kyle,"Wonderful apartment, clean, perfect setting with one of the most comfortable beds I have ever encountered. 

I would strongly recommend that if you are looking at this property you do not bring a car with  you - parking in the area is an absolute nightmare with the time limits and price of the garages. 

No fault of the owners - but the area is swarmed with undesirable people asking for money and they are very aggressive and threatening. I asked a police officer for assistance and he told me he was ""too busy"". Much nicer city on sports day! 

"
3273240,30567204,2015-04-24,30309832,Kelly,It had some soft white lights on and it was so nice to come into.  There was coffee and creamers as well as fresh water in the fridge.  Loved it
3273240,31675934,2015-05-08,27061891,Rindert,"It is a great, wonderfully decorated  beautiful space, and the checkin and out was very easy. It is located very close to Pioneer Square with many restaurants and activities close by. So at night there is some noise from the activities down on the street, but hey, you are in the heart of the city.  The window with a view on 1st Ave is great. "
3273240,37132220,2015-07-05,26979021,Mara,"My husband and I stayed two nights in the loft following our wedding, as it was within two blocks of our reception site! It was large and well-appointed! We loved its decor, especially the carved wood Indian screen! We enjoyed the view of the street from the large window, which also opened to let in cool air in the morning! Bonnie kindly left us a card, flowers, and bottle of bubbly to mark the occasion! The bed was very comfortable, which was greatly appreciated, as we regrettably only had time to sleep at the loft and didn't get to enjoy its amenities as much as we would have liked! We would recommend the loft to visitors of our city for sure! "
3273240,41731185,2015-08-09,30214019,Jennifer,"This was my first airbnb experience and this loft was exactly like the picture and description.  It was neat and tidy and not fussy which made it easy to relax and enjoy being in the city.  My son and I stayed for a full week and we felt like we were staying in our own Seattle home.  We walked everywhere!  We were here for a tournament at Key Arena and walked there everyday and tried a new restaurant each time.  (Umi Sushi, Wann Japanese, and Pho Ba were outstanding).  Really, leave the car at home.  
Thank you Bonnie and Dean for making us feel welcome and sharing your home with us.  We even met some of your cool neighbors.
Sincerely, Jennifer and George
"
3273240,42202931,2015-08-11,40041300,Georgia,"This loft is absolutely stunning. Honestly, I tried to keep my expectations low because the photos are amazing, but WOW. This was my first time using airbnb and I don't think I will ever get a hotel again! My boyfriend and I came up to Seattle for his birthday, I kept where we were actually staying a surprise and he was soooo blown away! Bonnie is super attentive and easy to communicate with,  she even gave us suggestions for a romantic evening out! Basically what I'm saying is this place is stunning, comfortable, and I would love to stay again anytime we visit Seattle."
3273240,43225512,2015-08-18,6375219,Gaye,"Bonnie was immediately responsive, informative and welcoming whenever I contacted her.  The apartment was just as it is pictured and even more charming in real life.   The neighborhood is in the heart of Seattle's tourist area and is lively with the sites and sounds of restaurants, shops and people.   Since it is on the second floor in a wonderful historic Pioneer Square building ,one should not expect isolation from the street noises and night life.  However, even as a settled couple in our 60's we had no trouble sleeping soundly at night. "
3273240,43534087,2015-08-20,21331556,John,"I always love staying here, the loft is incredible and in the kitchen there is everything you would need, even cook a Thanksgiving turkey if you wanted. The neighborhood is great, I love this part of Seattle"
3273240,45235713,2015-09-01,4802524,Pamela,"Our stay at Bonnie and Dean beautiful loft was great, the place is just as shown on the pictures and the bed and couch are probably more comfy than our own. It's neat and very clean, we felt just at home. Like said before by other guests, its very central location makes it lively in the evening. You are in the heart of the city and so there is some noise. I would recommend to take earplug if you have trouble sleeping. Overall the loft was just what we needed, a comfy and central place to explore Seattle. "
3273240,45976819,2015-09-07,32716935,Ryan,"My wife and I had a wonderful stay in the Pioneer Square loft. The location was perfect - close to everything, but still cozy. The loft was in great shape, everything was clean and neat, and we loved all the artwork! d"
3273240,50085431,2015-10-09,11393700,Vicki,"We were extremely pleased with the Pioneer Square loft.  The pictures are spot on, but really don't do it justice.  It was clean, well-stocked, and very welcoming.  There were fresh flowers on the coffee table, ground coffee and filters in the kitchen, and nice touches throughout the entire place that made it a great experience.  If you are sensitive to noise at all, you might be chagrined by the music playing until 2am in the bar directly below.  However, earplugs are provided and we both thought of it as part of the novelty of staying downtown. Sadly, we had to leave early due to a family emergency, but it was lovely while it lasted."
4642956,27612735,2015-03-08,2005546,Kathryn,"John and Ann have a beautiful apartment with a great view! Their son Nick helped out with my parents questions while John and Ann were out of town, and he was quick to respond and very kind and helpful. I highly recommend this apartment and these hosts!"
281208,930404,2012-02-19,1569059,Kerry,"Joe is an extremely thoughtful host, the house is beautifully furnished, fully stocked with more than you can think of and the perfect house and location for families.  The house is large and we had plenty of space!  We will definitely reuse This accomodation when we return to Seattle and highly recommend to others.  We felt at home during our weeks stay."
281208,995113,2012-03-13,1608155,Vicky,Very cute house! All the places we wanted to visit were a 10 min drive or less. Will stay here again. 
281208,1079843,2012-04-03,1981816,Patrick,Very nice house.  Enjoyed our stay there! Clean and has everything you need.  Would stay there again the the future. Recommended!!!
281208,1087364,2012-04-05,893008,Cheryl,"Wonderful house!  Beautifully decorated, tastefully refinished.  Spotless. Residential neighborhood, very quiet. Within walking distance to a great little playground for the kids (2 and 4).  Convenient to Rainier Ave to get to and from various places in the city. Will plan to come back again in the summer!"
281208,1252909,2012-05-09,1580277,Jeff And Jane,We enjoyed our stay very much!  The house was perfectly appointed and positioned for our short time in Seattle and worked well for 5 adults.  We wished we had more time there.  I would certainly recommend it to travellers.
281208,1275949,2012-05-14,1931328,Tiffany,"Joe's home was beautiful with lots of parking space and plenty of room for our whole family. The family room and dining roon are very spacious with plenty of seating for all of us and a some visitors. The bedrooms have wonderful natural light, comfortable beds and lovely linens. He also keeps the home well stocked with white fluffy towels. He was so quick in responding to all of my e-mails. He was also very helpful when we left something behind and was kind enough to track it down and ship it back to us. I will definitely stay here again the next time we visit Seattle. "
281208,1744898,2012-07-19,2084969,Leesa,We had a great time. The house was super.

281208,2158191,2012-09-01,2598355,DeVon,"Was very nice having a place to stay with the whole family and not have to rent two or more motel rooms to accomodate. House was clean with nice ammenities. Kitchen was fully stocked with all needed cooking instruments to prepare anything you wanted to make. We enjoyed shopping at Pike's and then cooking up the fresh foods from the market. It was close to Centurylink for the Seahawks v Raiders game we saw. Saw Dave Mathews Band on the way home at the Gorge. Awesome trip. My wife who is into interior design liked the art and decor of the home. Thanks Joe, great place !!!"
281208,2189583,2012-09-04,1890096,Eric,"Oh where to begin!  We had a wonderful stay here in Seattle.  After cruising Alaska for a week it was nice to come ""home"" and relax before returning to reality in sweltering Arizona!  Our stay in Seattle was sunshine the entire weekend!  Joe's home was welcoming and very clean!  It was stocked with just about everything you could imagine.  It was centrally located and very close to freeways and downtown.  We would stay here again.  Thanks Joe for a great place to call home for a couple days when we visited Seattle :)

281208,2695544,2012-10-23,3298025,Van,"Great accommodations, nicely decorated, convenient to the City, and all the trappings of home away from home. Nothing is overlooked in making this a great place to stay. Thanks so much. Enjoyed it immensely. "
281208,3036608,2012-12-06,3628392,Ariana,"Joe was great to work with - everything was organized and extremely accommodating.  I was with 3 coworkers and whenever we weren't working we just wanted to get back to the house to hang out out the comfy couches!  The house was extremely clean, all of the basics were there (paper towels, toilet paper, regular towels, laundry detergent, etc) and in a very accessible neighborhood to the city.  I would happily come back again!"
281208,3727782,2013-03-09,4704477,Paul,We stayed at this wonderful location for a week.  The home itself is beautiful as you can see from the pictures and the location was really ideal.  We could easily walk to the International district or to downtown and we were right next to bus lines to get to any part of the city.  It easily slept all seven of us and I can't recommend it enough - top notch!
281208,3903604,2013-03-26,4519295,Katie,Great location!  The house is really well decorated and set up.  Kitchen had everything we needed and we were impressed with how well it was laid out.  Nice and close to everywhere we wanted to go.  All directions and instructions Joe left were straight forward and easy!  Would definitely stay here again!

281208,5255060,2013-06-21,4433313,Nils,"We were seven people staying at Joe's house and it was a great place! Fully equipped kitchen, two toilets and within walking distance to grocery stores and downtown seattle. Also has a parkingspace for the car.
We also got a nice welcome-letter with a lot of useful information.
Very nice place!"
281208,7031990,2013-09-04,2282498,Mathew,Super nice place! Location was a short cab ride from everything we wanted to see during our stay.
281208,9296535,2013-12-19,4836797,Jessica,This house is perfect for a family or close friends. It's super clean and well decorated. It's a little off the beaten path for Seattle which is great and adds to the adventure- us your closer to Georgetown and downtown 
281208,10653774,2014-03-02,9422473,Amy,"This was a great house!  Close to downtown but in a quiet neighborhood.  Perfect for family or group getaway.  Easy to access bus-lines and cheap ride in taxi from downtown.  Beautiful, clean space!"
281208,11358988,2014-03-31,12611556,Mario,"If you want to explore the city without staying in a downtown hotel, Joe's house is highly recommended. It's in a nice part of town, next to a great park and easy access to both interstates. The house has everything you need - perfect for 5-6 people. Have fun in Seattle."
281208,17035108,2014-08-06,9016620,Kyle,"Great place.  Slept 6 comfortably, very clean and only a short drive to downtown.  A park is right down the street as well and we were pleasantly surprised that a music festival was happening at the park while we were there so that was an added bonus.  "
281208,44393195,2015-08-25,11969601,Matthew,"After a poor experience at a ""luxury"" condo our group was forced to make a last minute booking. Luckily, we were find Joe's house which was the best decision we made.

I would highly recommend this property to anyone visiting the Seattle area. The house is well maintained and was large enough to fit all four of us comfortably with plenty of bathrooms and extra space. We particularly enjoyed the location which was a short ride away from Safeco Field. 

The house is well maintained and serves as an example of what a well maintained property should look like. Joe was very responsive and accommodating."
281208,45989105,2015-09-07,40645801,Donnie,The house was just as described. A very cozy clean little house with all the amenities one would want. Just what we were looking for. Thanks Joe for providing this house to us on a special day. 
281208,50298671,2015-10-11,42384713,Audrie,"This was an excellent choice for our family--well maintained, clean, conveniently located, and even stocked with baby gear (booster dining seat, simple stroller, pack n play).  We forgot to bring some toiletries and were pleasantly surprised with bathrooms already stocked with the basics.  Since our flight arrived early, the host accommodated an earlier check in, and was super easy to work with.  Our family is allergy prone and no one got the sniffles Bc the place is very eclean and well maintained.  Thanks for making our stay a pleasant one!"
281208,52594877,2015-10-31,3553236,Matthew,"Another great Airbnb experience. Joe's place is super clean, affordable and large. It's also in a great location just south of downtown Seattle. The beds were very comfortable and cozy. And the bathrooms were perfect. Entire place is nicely decorated. "
281208,53928503,2015-11-14,41952341,Katharina,"We loved this house! It had everything we needed, nice bedrooms, big bathrooms, a fully equipped kitchen and a cozy living room! Communication was easy, although we never met Joe, everything was fine and the house was ready for us. Would totally recommend staying at this house again!"
281208,54725599,2015-11-23,21598341,Dan,Outstanding place to stay for a Seattle weekend.  House was perfect and exactly as described.  Very close and convenient to downtown.  Less than $10 Uber to the stadiums.  Will not hesitate to stay here again.  Thank You Joe!
5310503,27077678,2015-02-24,9006936,Aaron,Best deal in Seattle! Diana and her roommate  are friendly. The house is very clean. I love how orderly the house is. There is a Safeway in walking distance and a nice Latin American restaraunt across the street. I'd do it again if I need a place to crash.
5310503,29332839,2015-04-06,29163958,Irene Yoonji,"Diana was pretty kind :) Actually i couldn't see her a lot of time because of her personal stuff. But she explained all i need, and served comfortable spaces. Moreover i think the house was really nice. "

5310503,33194590,2015-05-25,33773893,Kendall,"Honestly couldn't have asked for a better experience.  I didn't spend much time there, but the time I was there I felt safe, comfortable (it's a very nice apartment: very clean and homely), and welcome."
5310503,33612138,2015-05-30,33433193,Michael,"Diana was an excellent host. She reached out to me early and ensured I had directions and was registered to use her elock. Your phone is your key, so don't let your battery run out before you come home.  I was gone for most of the day and had very little interaction with Diana or her housemates, but they were all perfectly nice. The place was very neat and orderly and in a great part of town with easy access to downtown Seattle or Bellevue with very little freeway time needed. I would stay there again or recommend her to others."
5310503,34029245,2015-06-03,20110859,ÏÜåÏú†,"There is so clean and cozy room. I couldn't meet her, but everything was cleaned when I came back after day. It is little far from downtown, but it's easy to access."

5310503,35873692,2015-06-22,10286593,Gizem,"The house was extremely clean, comfortable and located close to different bus lines that'll take you downtown quickly. Diana was an amazing host and a very kind person. Thank you for everything!"
5310503,43574345,2015-08-20,41415485,Robert,"This is a great place to stay if you‚Äôre ever in Seattle. Like people have already said, it‚Äôs a little far from the city, but only a little. Getting downtown was easy and it is a nice ride that goes by the University of Washington. You have access to the kitchen, along with pots and utensils, and there is Safeway pretty much right across the street. Diana was a great host; everything about my stay in Seattle was awesome.



"
5310503,45178275,2015-08-31,41864044,Kelly,"Diana is a friendly, welcoming host. We had a bad storm during the weekend I stayed and she kept me updated on where to find flashlights, etc. - so nice! Her house is comfortable and clean with plenty of space; looks just as pictured. There's a Safeway/Starbucks a couple of blocks away and downtown Seattle is a 20-30 minute bus ride. Would definitely stay again. Thanks, Diana! "
5310503,45715070,2015-09-05,41712439,Patrick,"Everything about the listing exceeded my expectations, and it served as a great home-base for my first time in Seattle. The space is very clean, a bit larger than pictured, and fairly private for being a shared space. 

Diana is attentive and accommodating, but gives you plenty of privacy and freedom. Her positive attitude and friendliness made my stay a great one!"
5310503,46207816,2015-09-08,10567978,Nina,Diana is really cute and friendly. She cares about you. Good place to stay. The bed was really comfortable

5310503,49794523,2015-10-06,11029797,Kevica,"Had an amazing time, though I wasn't at Diana's house that much I still enjoyed my stay there it was quite comfortable place to stay. I seriously loved it and the next time I visit this will be my first choice for places to stay."
5310503,51507065,2015-10-20,28366714,Amber,"I had a lovely time! The neighborhood is very quiet and I felt very comfortable walking around, even at night. 
Diana was a great host and I felt very comfortable in her home. I would recommend this home if you want to stay somewhere calm, clean and friendly. "
5310503,52127423,2015-10-26,24677011,Emily,"Be sure to check the house manual for which apartment in the building it is -- the smart lock does not look like a smart lock from outside! The bed in the living room is just as Diana described it. It's conveniently located near several bus lines into downtown, and will be about a 30min trip available roughly every 15mins to get to downtown Seattle. Although I was rarely around so I didn't meet Diana in person, she was friendly and helpful in all of our communications."
5310503,53577666,2015-11-09,1562357,Stephanie,"Diana's place was perfect - I was in town for work and needed a place to get a good night's sleep. The house was clean & tidy, and very serene. Diana was very friendly and incredibly helpful, and really made sure I had everything I needed for my stay. Busing into town was a breeze, and the Safeway that's across the street made getting groceries easy, too.

Would definitely stay again!"
8391954,54175828,2015-11-16,36063918,Sache,"Kaitlyn's house was perfect for a weekend in Seattle!  The view was great and it was only a $10 Uber ride to and from downtown.  The house was clean, the heater heated up the house quickly, and the living room was comfortable.  "
8391954,55017353,2015-11-27,41948889,Jake,"This house is comfortable and gorgeous. Lovely decor and an incredible view. Recommend it.

3186785,34508132,2015-06-08,33619917,Muhamed,Ben and Shannon were great hosts.  Everything was in order when I arrived although I did have a hard time locating the house when using a gps. Shannon did send me a map which helped a lot and I eventually found the place. I had breakfast with Ben a few days and he cooked which was cool. I really liked both Ben and Shannon and enjoyed our time together. Would recommend.
3186785,34759574,2015-06-11,35264110,Sierra,"Shannon and Ben have been incredibly generous and extremely helpful hosts!!!! They are such a rad pair and have such a sense of sharing and giving about them. We needed a place to crash while we looked for a house to move into and they went above and beyond to make sure we felt comfortable and right at home! When we first got here they served us the most incredible home made caramel snickerdoodle cookies that are to die for! Thanks Shannon!! 
You guys are amazing and we are forever grateful for your kindness! HIGHLY RECOMMEND STAYING WITH THESE COOL PEOPLE! "
3186785,37813112,2015-07-10,26035804,Luan,Your house clean and nice! I'm very happy with your house! I will keep your contact for next trip!
3186785,38006344,2015-07-12,78811,Simran,The Bedouin paradise is spacious and comfortable. My stay was short but excellent. Very convenient from SEA. Only sorry my hosts weren't around to hang with. Thanks for the Ghirardelli mini chocolates on the bed... Perfect touch of hospitality!
3186785,38212696,2015-07-13,18456986,New,"I had just a short stay, less than 24 hours, the place was perfect for my needs.  Shannon was very helpful in making sure I was able to find the place and enter the house.   Highly recommend to anyone needing a place close to the Seattle-Tacoma International Airport."
3186785,38660961,2015-07-17,14452797,Gelinda,"This was a great space for my children and I. The home was large and clean. The kids enjoyed all the board games, movies, and instruments available throughout the space. Great location, very close to light rail. That made out visit to Seattle quick and stress free from traffic. Ben was welcoming and friendly. Overall very happy with my stay!!"
3186785,39034123,2015-07-20,35252404,Lindsay,"The house was just as described, & 10-15 min from the airport for easy transportation :) Ben was very welcoming & it was a great place to crash for a few nights while sightseeing Seattle. Thanks!"

3186785,40448374,2015-07-31,34443565,Olga,"Shannon and Ben were wonderful hosts and made our stay comfortable and pleasant. The rooms were spacious, clean, sunny, and beautifully decorated. It was nice to have a well-organized kitchen and a spotless bathroom all to ourselves. 
Shannon's and Ben's house is close to a major interstate, which made it easy to get to all the places of interest we wanted to visit, as well as to get to the airport in time (it is about 10 - 15 min drive).
I would definitely recommend Bedouin paradise to anyone who visits Seattle. Nice people, nice place.
"
3186785,40983417,2015-08-03,38696494,Elana,"What a wonderful place to stay in Seattle! My friends and I were only in town for the night and were pretty beat from sightseeing all day. Shannon and Ben made us feel right at home and were absolutely wonderful. They were accommodating and kind, and their house is beautiful and comfortable. I would definitely recommend Shannon and Ben's place to anyone visiting Seattle!"
3186785,41948316,2015-08-10,34582708,Seann,Shannon and her husband Ben were very warm and welcoming. They were happy to share meals with us or provide great tips for local restaurants. The kitchen space was extremely nice and the shared living room area was very inviting! Shannon and Ben were incredibly understanding to our schedule and super accommodating. Our trip to Seattle wouldn't have been half as great if it wasn't for Shannon and Ben's amazing hospitality. 
3186785,42693647,2015-08-15,1449474,Bruno,"Fiz uma viagem com minha banda a Seattle e ficamos hospedados na casa da Shannon e Ben por 9 dias, foi sensacional!
Eles deixam os h√≥spedes bem a vontade, tudo √© exatamente como na descri√ß√£o do an√∫ncio e s√£o muito atenciosos e legais!
O local n√£o √© muito pr√≥ximo ao centro da cidade, mas √© muito f√°cil e r√°pido para chegar at√© l√° tanto de trem como de carro.O bairro √© bem tranquilo tamb√©m, tudo √≥timo!

I was on a work trip so I was normally dead tired when I got back each night so I was very happy with the space and privacy they gave us.

Overall this as a great experience and I would stay with them for sure!"

3186785,45377075,2015-09-02,18295839,Koriel,"Shannon and Ben were awesome hosts. They were very hospitable and ""cool"". The downstairs area was larger than the photos made it seem, which was great for our crew of 5 people. Everything was clean and organized, and there was even food in the refrigerator! The instruments were free to use, as was the TV. I would definitely recommend this place to friends looking for a great deal in Seattle!

Also, for cat people, they have a cute white kitty upstairs that loves getting pets :)"
3186785,45793715,2015-09-06,37623577,Yingying,"Did not get to meet Shannon, which was a pity because she seems really nice and helpful. Was very happy with the fully furbished kitchen, which was all for us to use. There was only 1 king-sized bed, and smaller couches for us to use. Bedroom and living room were full of pillows and blankets, so we could use those to make ourselves comfy. It was an enjoyable stay! Thanks Shannon for Whatsapping us!"
3186785,46133866,2015-09-08,37189110,Sara,"Thank you for sharing your lovely home with us! Shannon and Ben made it very easy to find their place and make ourselves comfortable during our visit. You can tell that they put time into making the space fun for many people's interests with tons of options for movies, Xbox and board games, as well as an electronic drum kit. The space was ample yet cozy and felt like a second home! I would say that it is advertised to accommodate 6 people, which space wise it did, but this space is definitely ideal for a younger crowd who may not care as much about their sleep quality while out exploring Seattle. One bed is very comfortable for 2 people to share (3 if small or you like to cuddle). A futon unfolds into a bed in the downstairs living room but is very stiff and bows up in the center, creating a hard spot that hurts to roll over.  The other two were able to make themselves comfortable with nests on the floor. This did not detract from our trip and we were plenty happy with these accommodations! However, if you are traveling with a family or pickier travelers it's important to know that while 6 people can fit and will be provided pillows and blankets, there are only really comfortable mattresses for 2+ people. "
3186785,46717641,2015-09-13,38177870,Nhi,Ben and Shannon were great hosts! They have a lovely home and a really awesome cat. Couldn't have asked for a better host :) 
3186785,49043737,2015-09-30,16060433,Martin,"This was a great find! My boyfriend and I needed a place to stay while we found an apartment. Not only was it a good price but it was just what we needed. Lots of room, own kitchen, bathroom, large bedroom and living room with its own big screen tv.  We were able to use their coffee machine, stove and fridge. Not going to lie we were a little sketched out when we pulled into the alley to park but out car was parked out there everyday for a week and it was safe. Ben have us great advice on transportation and locations. I loved having my own living space and if you have ever stayed in Seattle you know the weekly rate at his place was a steal! 5 stars all the way!! "
3186785,49197693,2015-10-01,1469000,Daniel,"Shannon and Ben could not have been nicer; I watched a show with them (until I fell asleep) and they quietly left.  The house was great; we had the entire downstairs, with a really comfortable futon for the third person (me), had some yogurt in the fridge which they shared.  House was just great."

Annie was really nice. Key exchange was convenient and fast. Nothing to complain about.
Overall would recommend this apartment to a friend."

8338849,47875945,2015-09-21,44123668,Jonathan,Very welcoming and great place to stay. Place was clean and neat; kitchen was made available to us. Hosts gave us great advice on places to try in the area (get pastries at Cafe Bezalu!)
8338849,48451024,2015-09-26,4096569,Yessi,I really enjoyed staying in Ballard with Brian and Angela. Ballard is a cool part of town and a good choice if you arrive in Seattle by car because there's lots of free parking by the house. Both Brian and Angela were helpful with suggestions for fun things around town and my friend and I even ended up going to see the same show they went to and had recommended. And it was fantastic! I would definitively recommend staying with them. The rooms are comfortable and we really enjoyed the quirky old house. 
8338849,48616497,2015-09-27,1649180,Gene,"We had a great stay with Brian. The house is very comfy, and Brian is a great host. We'd definitely stay here again. "
8338849,48854268,2015-09-28,1855473,Dana & Alan,"After an initial communication breakdown, we had a lovely stay. Comfortable room, Brian and his wife are lovely."
8338849,49079867,2015-09-30,5125475,Debbie,"Brian was very easy to work with, communicated well, and made accommodations for my late night arrival . Place was comfortable and clean."
5538663,28832488,2015-03-30,10342640,Guillaume,"Great place to stay in Seattle, the apartment is very cosy. Lots of coffees/restaurants (I recommend El Diablo for breakfast) in the neighborhood. Perfect indications from Maria."
5538663,29513700,2015-04-08,11819445,Hillary,Beautifully furnished apartment in a great location. Maria was wonderfully welcoming. She left a bottle of wine and quarters for the laundry! Highly recommended.
5538663,33532580,2015-05-29,32062011,Jefferson,"Maria was very welcoming. The place was great, as advertised. The neighborhood is wonderful. Easy to walk anywhere and the public transportation system makes it easy to get around. Overall good experience."
5538663,33863154,2015-06-01,34060070,Kati,"As a first time airbnb-er, I couldn't have asked for a better experience! Maria made us feel very welcome to her lovely apartment with notes on her favourite spots in the neighbourhood and a bottle of wine. Queen Anne was a fun neighbourhood and its location allowed us to explore most of downtown Seattle on foot. Maria was also very accommodating in that she answered any and all of my questions in a timely and professional manner! "
5538663,34094893,2015-06-04,34195674,Dan,"Maria was more than a gracious host. Being a first time user on Airbnb she quickly put any concerns to rest with quick responses to any questions I had.

Her place came exactly as advertised and the neighborhood was perfect for getting around to all the best places Seattle has to offer.

Thanks again Maria!"
5538663,34659151,2015-06-10,535044,Guillermo,"We loved staying at Maria's cozy apartment in Queen Ann area. With a bus stop right in front of the building, it was very easy for us to get around beautiful Seattle. Quiet, clean and a very confortable bed.... Thank you very much for having us !!!! "
5538663,34994550,2015-06-14,1434845,Erin,Maria is a warm and wonderful host! The space was quite comfortable and very well located close to City Center and many busses. I'd absolutely stay there again. 
5538663,35485264,2015-06-19,28466762,Ben,"The images are a perfect portrayal of the apartment. The location is excellent, very close to everything, including one of the best grocery stores I have ever been in. The check-in was a tiny bit confusing, but it was after a long day of traveling and I'm confident Maria will work it out. She has a great place for one heck of a deal. Thank you."
5538663,35824132,2015-06-22,12218754,Amber," We can't imagine a better Air BnB experience and location for the price. It was clean and had everything you could possibly need, with a thoughtful, simple decor/design to boot. In lower Queen Anne, it is virtually centrally located for anywhere you'd need to go in Seattle. We got around on foot and by Car2Go and it was super easy. We were in town one weekend for a drumming festival that was at different locations throughout the city and this made for a great home base between all activities. There is a fantastic 24 hr market a couple blocks down, as well as superb brunch spots (Talouse, 5-Spot), etc. 

Thanks Maria for providing such a neat, sweet place --- we left having thoroughly enjoyed the true ""Seattle"" experience everyone is after."

It was walking distance to great restaurants and shops on 15th in Capitol Hill, and super easy street parking.  Loved it, and would highly recommend booking this house.

We had a ""Great Stay"". The convenience of the location and the comforts of the home made our short stay in Seattle one that will stay with us for ever. We really enjoyed the BBQ grill you provided for us, it was another great highlight of our Seattle experience. We are really looking forward to our next stay in Seattle.  Thank you very much. "

722537,7680255,2013-09-29,8778779,George,"Cameron was a great host and everything was arranged easily and smoothly. The apartment was very clean and spacious, as described and can be seen by the photos, and the BBQ on the garden was great! On street parking easy and free."
722537,10325772,2014-02-13,492189,Derrick,"We stayed in Cameron's Garden apartment for about 2 weeks in February while working in Seattle.  We really enjoyed the space, everything was clean and it felt like home.  This is not his private residence so there was a lot of space for our things.  Kitchen and bathroom were clean and all appliances worked great.  
I loved the back porch (when it wasn't raining) and we had no problems parking our 16' truck in the street. Great cafe and coffee shop a block away and walking distance from nightlife and restaurants on 15th st.  Short 10 min drive to downtown. Cameron always responded promptly with questions.  Great place, I would stay here again."
722537,10968146,2014-03-15,572977,Annette,"My colleague and I stayed at Cameron's place for a work trip. It was PERFECT. Cozy apartment with everything you need, in a great neighborhood. So much better than a hotel - we'd love to stay again if we make another trip to Seattle. Thanks Cameron!"
722537,13305044,2014-05-25,12306568,Elaine,"Cameron and Roanne were perfect hosts!  We had a tiny plumbing problem and it was fixed within an hour.  Their handyman was competent and personable.  We loved the location of the Garden Suite.  Walking a block down to Tully's Coffee Shop was so fun, and we enjoyed Greek food at VIOS across from Tully's.  I fell in love with the kitchen, as it was very well equipped and easy to use.  Cameron even brought down a blender after I asked if there was one.  Roanne spent time showing me how to work the appliances and the fun French press for making ""gourmet coffee"".  The location was close to the University, Trader Joes, Central Co-op, Safeway and, most importantly, our new granddaughter!  :).  As soon as we have dates from our daughter, we would love to book Cameron's place again in October.  It was perfect (and very roomy).  All linens, toilet paper, laundry detergent, etc. were provided--even a vase for flowers.  All the comforts of home. . . parking was easy- right across street - and never had a problem finding a spot.  Could not have been happier.  Sincerely, Elaine Newton"
722537,14015894,2014-06-10,13031480,Linda,"Cameron was terrific.  I had a little technological problem working the lock (not my strong point) and he got back to me as I had finally figured it out.  No waiting time.  The apartment was spotless and uncluttered and everything that I needed (plus a few items that I hadn't thought of--corkscrew, press coffee maker) was easy to find.  The set up of the apartment was great.  I would happily live there permanently.  The neighborhood is absolutely gorgeous.  Bus service #10 on 15th; #12 on 19th is very convenient.  It is also great to be by the parks.  i highly recommend this apartment,"
722537,16657664,2014-07-31,15517904,Jim,The experience with the host was great. Cameron and Roanne were responsive and very accommodating. 
722537,17092725,2014-08-07,14996199,Sarah,"We loved staying at this cute house in a quiet capitol hill neighborhood. The house was exactly as described and pictured: extremely clean and roomy with tons of sunlight. The backyard is wooded and private, we spent most of our time out there (we were fortunate to have a whole week of hot, summer days). Although a quaint neighborhood, it's an easy walk to coffee houses, cute shops (check out the Red Balloon on 15th if you have kids), and groceries. Plus, it's only three blocks to the awesome Volunteer Park. Our 2 year old spent hours at the playground and wading pool there. 

We would love to stay here again the next time we're in town as it's within 15 minutes of almost anywhere you might want to go in Seattle. The only thing I worry about is if our 2 year old was too loud for the upstairs tenant (you might want to check with the host first if you have kids). 
"
722537,17816130,2014-08-18,6639233,Sandra,"Cameron's place is fabulous and we had a fantastic 8 day stay in a modern, self-contained apartment with a great seating and BBQ area in the garden.  This place has all the amenities you could want and plenty of room (there were just two of us but easily sleeps 4).

It is light and airy and has great furniture, beds, linens, towels and cooking facilities (if needed).

The place was spotless and well kept to the highest standards.  If we return to Seattle this will be our choice of venue.  It has a great location with three great bars and restaurants just a 5 minute stroll in one direction on 19th with loads more bars etc in the opposite direction on 15th.

Communication with the host was first class."
722537,19072442,2014-09-06,121452,Kari,"Cameron was a pleasure to deal with and was always easy to get a hold of. His listing is just like the pictures, it is clean and the beds are comfortable. The house is located in a beautiful neighbourhood, and it is easy to get around. Would recommend Cameron and his listing, and would definitely stay again.  "
722537,21698264,2014-10-22,12306568,Elaine,"This was our second stay in Cameron's Garden Suite.  It was fantastic.  The home was well-stocked; and Cameron made special trips to install part for dishwasher, bring us ""low-suds"" laundry detergent, and help us open washer door.  He is the perfect host.  I was very pleased with the new kitchen additions of coffee maker and cookie sheets.:)  We're hoping to book the Garden Suite again sometime next Spring.  Thank you again, Cameron, for all your kindness.  Sincerely, Elaine and Michael Newton"
722537,23209950,2014-11-25,10860592,Mike,"The flat was well stocked with towels, sheets, and other things that made it very easy to live there.  Location is great, and the backyard was a perfect place to send the kids outside."
722537,23369919,2014-11-30,3832572,Tina,"We had a very good experience. We especially liked the roominess, the kitchen was well furnished with utensils and dish ware, the living room was comfortable. The place is quiet and we don't hear the other tenant. We love the location.  We walked to the coffee shop everyday. We had a car, and parking was mostly a non-issue. Over the 4.5 days of our stay, only once we couldn't find street parking right away.  "
722537,24971482,2015-01-04,24836744,Varun,The Apartment was clean as advertised. Our stay was pleasant.
722537,26243780,2015-02-08,24483313,Sara,I booked the Garden Suite on behalf of an employee whose family our company was helping to relocate to Seattle from Costa Rica. Cameron provided a detailed document with information on the ins and outs of his listing and made himself available to answer all of my questions to make the process painless. My employee reported that the Garden Suite was perfect for his family of 5 and helped make the transition to permanent housing much less stressful.
722537,28795893,2015-03-30,16664426,Yana,"We were stayed in Cameron's house for 42 nights, there is really nice house and location very well! Cameron and Roanne so kindly! If I have chance, I will stay more time here! Thank you so much! "

722537,30441637,2015-04-22,26539964,Ethan,The Garden Suite was an excellent place to call home for a week. Everything was just as advertised. Simple but tasteful apartment with all the amenities. 
722537,31651368,2015-05-08,21942665,Gary,"Cameron's house is in a very nice, quiet neighborhood in Capitol Hill that was perfect for our group. Great parks nearby and the neighborhood itself was beautiful in May. The space was bright, clean and has all of the basic amenities. Furnishings are a little bit sparse, but all of the bases are covered. Great if you're planning on sightseeing during the day.

When we had an issue with the locks, Cameron responded right away to help us get it worked out and was very accommodating. Overall a very good experience and I would recommend this listing to friends."
722537,32826312,2015-05-22,1681437,David,"We had a WONDERFUL stay at this suite in Capitol Hill. The place was spotless when we arrived. The kitchen was well stocked, the layout was spacious and comfortable. We have a toddler and a baby, and Cameron was very kind, and provided us with a travel crib and a highchair upon our arrival.

The location is perfect - it's within easy walking distance to restaurants and Volunteer Park, and parking was never a problem.

We had a fabulous stay, and this will be among our first choices for our next trip to Seattle!"
722537,34286173,2015-06-07,528081,Elizabeth,"Great place!  We rented this apartment for my inlaws who were visiting from Spain for 2 weeks.  They loved it.  Kitchen looks out over back yard with huge windows.  
Cameron lives close and responded very quickly to a minor issue with the washer.  
Overall- this place is well worth the money and a great location!"
722537,34832361,2015-06-12,35083764,J,"Quite and pretty neighborhood. Great launching pad for various parts of Seattle and environs. Apartment as advertised, perfect for our group of three. Many thanks!  "
722537,35201504,2015-06-16,10490244,Jonathan,"The listing was accurate. The host was responsive to our requests and questions.  This rental is an outstanding value.  Fantastic location in a quiet neighborhood but only a short walk to some nice restaurants, cafes and other shops.  The Garden Suite was very well furnished and clean.  Very nice to sit on the shady porch and have breakfast or whatever else.  I highly recommend this rental,  especially if you want to do a bit of your own cooking or are visiting Seattle with a family, it's much better and cheaper than staying at a hotel."
722537,36527221,2015-06-29,15885252,Sarah,"What a sweet place.  My kids and I were in town to visit my older daughter and loved having this little home to call ours for a week.  The beds were very, very comfortable.  Very.  I had inquired earlier as to whether or not the house had a blender and Cameron had offered to drop off his own if we found that we didn't have what we needed when we got there (it turned out to have a blender there!).  We would have liked the kitchen to be a little better appointed with things like baking dishes, aluminum foil, salt and pepper, etc.  But we made due just fine, and I'm sure if I'd asked, Cameron would have stopped by with anything we needed.  The bus system was easy and the location was perfect for us: an easy bus trip to anything we wanted to visit and only a 30 minute walk from my daughter's work at the NOAA facility by the canal.  She stayed with us for the weekend and made use of Cameron's extra futon and bedding.  The internet was a bit slow - not sure why.  My daughter ended up tethering with her phone to do her online homework.  But it wasn't a huge problem for the rest of us.  We'd definitely stay again.  Thanks, Cameron!"
722537,37301283,2015-07-06,30245476,Tim,"The place exceeded expectations! We were given a very thorough rundown of the neighborhood, how to get around, use the wifi, wash clothes, etc. Great experience! "
722537,38106302,2015-07-13,30447801,Eric,"We brought our family of 4 to Seattle for the first time and were very happy with our stay in the Garden Suite!  It had everything we needed - and more.  Looking at the forecast, we were a little afraid of traveling during a mini heat wave and staying without air conditioning.  Cameron dropped off a fan the day we arrived.  How's that for service!?  

Kitchen was great - outfitted with enough for us to have breakfast and then head out for our adventures.  Neighborhood was quiet and friendly, with a great park (Volunteer Park) a few blocks away, which has a great little playground for kids as well as a wading pool for the warmer days.

I would recommend staying here to anyone looking for a place in Seattle.  "
722537,38814893,2015-07-19,26247111,Joern,"We had a great Time. The house was a bit smaller than expected, but well equiped and up to our needs. The neighboorhood is wonderful with some nice coffeeshops and Restaurants in walking distance. We would definitely stay there again"
722537,41730675,2015-08-09,30091978,David,"Thank you for a great stay at the house - we were made to feel very welcome. We felt at home immediately, especially with the well equipped kitchen, and absolutely loved the place - so much so that several people wished that they could stay longer! The home was exactly as described, and shown in the pictures. The neighbourhood was great with free on street parking and being close to several supermarkets and restaurants, as well as easy to get to downtown! Thank you for a a great stay!"
722537,42656172,2015-08-15,16927305,Caroline,"We had a wonderful stay in North Capitol! This a bright, clean and comfortable place in a beautiful (website hidden) in fridge was welcoming as was the comfortable beds, French press and other amenities throughout that truly made it home away from home with our three kids. Roanne and Cameron couldn't have been nicer, nor more accommodating. Public transit was easy from this location and coffee shops were cozy and kid-tolerant. I would definitely recommend this location for couples or families. (*If you bring small children look for the ""Treasure Tree"" up the street a couple of blocks on Prospect on your way to the wonderful park not far from the house."""
722537,44026707,2015-08-23,6130466,Bailey,"This is a great space. It is clean, spacious, really well stocked with all the comforts of home. We had a great time. And the location in Capitol Hill was awesome. A rental car is recommended but not necessary, depending on how far out of the neighborhood you'd want to go. "
722537,56771501,2015-12-18,33637902,Iben,"We had a wonderful 3 month stay in the Garden Suite. The place was clean and nice, and Cameron was a great and helpful host during the entire period."

3139847,13897094,2014-06-07,394875,Lane,"Very nice, responsive and well-meaning host. Brand new apartment and furnishings. They had things like extra toothbrushes in the bathroom for guests. Cool view of the sound. It's right by an onramp to the highway, so if you're a light sleeper you might want to bring ear plugs. "
3139847,14060615,2014-06-10,11096175,Gabrielle,"An was a great host.  She was very responsive before and after we arrived in Seattle.  Whatever we asked for (ie extra pillows) she provided very quickly.  The apartment was new and came with t.v. and cable, a nice sitting area, a nicely laid out kitchen and bathroom, and it had a washer and dryer in the unit.  The apartment was great, and within walking distance to Pike's Place and had beautiful views.  But it was on a busy street, and close to the highway which produced a lot of noise during the day and evening."
3139847,14162220,2014-06-13,15969585,Kevin,It was a great stay! An was an extremely nice and helpful host. The apartment is brand new with a spacious kitchen/living room. The location is also perfect as it was close to many of the popular attractions.
3139847,14243290,2014-06-15,15898766,James,"Had a great experience here. An was great and in constant contact, available to help with our arrival and any questions or needs we had during the stay. The apartment is in a great location, close to Belltown bars and restaurants, a quick walk to Pike's Place, and easy access to the waterfront and Olympic Sculpture Park.  The best part was the breathtaking Puget Sound views from the living room, bedroom, and balcony. The road below the apartment can be noisy, that wasn't a problem for us, and the views were worth it, but just something to consider.  We had a great stay, and definitely recommend it!"

I would highly recommend this neighborhood. It's a luxury area within walking distance of Pike Place Market and Seattle Center.

-great location. walking distance to multiple attractions
-rooftop areas were awesome and had great views
-building was brand new and felt very safe
-An was hospitable and answered all of our questions quickly

Note: the place doesn't have AC. I guess normally, this would be fine for Seattle, but the days I was there, it was 85 every day. It would have been nice to have AC. "
3139847,15632917,2014-07-13,16189246,Susan,Beautiful condo and great location. Had everything we needed. 
3139847,15764350,2014-07-15,825524,Julie And James,"Location was great for downtown and ferry access. The apartment is nicely updated. I echo the other reviews indicating the loud freeway. I'm a pretty light sleeper and found it noisy. It was also an unseasonably hot day so we couldn't leave the windows closed, probably worsening the situation. 

Overall the communication with An was great and we enjoyed our stay. "
3139847,16013222,2014-07-20,15744004,Nicole,"An was an awesome host. She allowed us to check in early and was always available for questions. Condo is very cute and had all of the necessities including laundry detergent. Perfectly located to allow for walking in Belltown, to the space needle and throughout downtown Seattle!  We had a blast!"
3139847,16299302,2014-07-25,10996841,Jean,Perfect location to explore Seattle. Condo and building were clean and sufficiently appointed. The in-unit washer/dryer was a plus. An met us as soon as we arrived and was readily available throughout our stay to answer any questions or resolve any (minor) issues. Highly recommend!
3139847,16773127,2014-08-02,2137933,Jeremy,"This condo on the waterfront in Belltown was everything we had hoped for.  Our company's out of town guest was already nervous about being alone in a big city.  With the sky-lounge, top-of-the-line fitness studio, secured building, and everything that a trip to Seattle can offer - just steps from his front door, it wasn't difficult getting comfortable.

An was such a gracious host!  She offered her hosting service well-before we even arrived.  She offered toiletries, towels, and various other amenities that normally are found at 4-Star Hotels.  She remained in consistent and regular contact right up until the day of arrival.  

When our guest arrived, An met him at the condo and gave him the grand tour - even though I was the one who actually booked the condo, but could not be there.  She touched based regarding every aspect at the reservation and our guest's stay.  This is funny, because I really dropped the ball on submitting this review. 

If you're looking for luxury quality, amazing service, and comfort - this is the AirBNB for you!  You won't be sorry."
3139847,17046225,2014-08-06,16268047,Chris And Emily,"An's place was awesome! Right near where we spent most of our time, a short walk to Pike Place Markets and all the restaurants around there but also close distance to the space needle and EMP music museum. Great view of the sound from inside the unit. Our flight from LA arrived early and An was more than accommodating to get us in and make sure we weren't out on the street. Thanks An!"
3139847,17503328,2014-08-13,949513,Abigail,"We enjoyed our stay at An's condo. It is a beautiful place and as described, if not even better. Because of the location there is a lot of street traffic all day and night. Having a fan in the non-ac unit definitely helped since it was scorching hot during out stay. Too bad the fan didn't rotate, though (unless we just couldn't figure it out). We got to enjoy the beautiful waterfront view every day. The building itself is wonderful with the beautiful lobby which has 2 computers you can use. There is also a coffee machine and packets of tea and hot chocolate available.  Finding the parking lot was a bit confusing since An mentioned it was on level 2. Not being from Seattle, we didn't realize that because of the elevation of the street levels, the one parking lot was considered on level 2. We were looking for 2 floors of parking. 

Although we didn't get to meet An, she was able to answer all of the questions we had before our visit. Her condo had these little notes in every corner, one of which contained the wifi access. It took us a few hours before we found that. She had other items available in the condo that air bnb units I have stayed at in the past would not normally have. She had a good amount of dvds, apple tv, toiletries and even an emergency sewing kit, just to name a few. If I had to list a con, it would be that the pots and pans in the kitchen were on the small side and there could have been a couple more extra plates. All in all, we enjoyed our stay and would definitely stay at this condo again."
3139847,18001921,2014-08-20,16427986,Melissa,"An was a perfectly good host! Although she could not be there to meet us, she remained in touch via text and checked in on us. The apartment was so cute! I just wish it had a/c. I understand we went during an uncharacteristically hot few days, but 85 degrees outside made the apartment unbearably hot. A lot of buildings in Seattle don't have a/c because they don't feel they need it for more than the two or three warm weeks of the year, but I think that's crazy! Nothing to do with An or her place, it's just a Seattle thing. It was hard to fall asleep while being so sticky. Also since it was so hot, we HAD to keep the windows open and the street noise became unbearable. So between the heat and the noise, we didn't spend much time in the apartment. The only reason we were able to sleep at all was because An was kind enough to have a fan in the closet, so we cranked that thing up! I would suggest more fans (when they become available in stores). 

The bed was SUPER comfy, but small. I think a full size is the only thing that would fit in that bedroom, though, but it was difficult coming from a king size (also because the heat makes you want your partner as FAR away as possible)! I'd recommend the size of it if you're traveling alone, but two can feel a bit cramped if you're used to bigger. 

The bedroom also didn't have a door, so it was more of a studio feel. We didn't mind that because we wanted the airflow, but others might. The neighbors would periodically go to their balcony to smoke and could easily see into the bedroom if you need the windows/blinds open, not to mention their smoke smells coming into the apartment. We didn't use the balcony much because of this, but found it wasn't worth the effort to open the patio door. The floor outside is too high and you have to lift the heavy door to make it outside. But you don't miss too much. 

Now for the good! The view was absolutely wonderful! It was everything the listing said it was and more. Waking up to the Olympics every morning was great. The location of the apartment was SO convenient. Pike Place was an easy walk, and we found a convenience store nearby for bottled water, etc. An was also great with providing some creature comforts with teas, cable, wifi, magazines, and various toiletries should we have forgotten any. Lastly, the parking was super convenient. We rented a car so we could go to Snoqualmie, Maltby, and other places so being able to park in a cool secured parking garage was perfect! 

Overall An was a good host, and the apartment was great, I just recommend coming at a different time of year!"
3139847,18087103,2014-08-21,19757707,Kris,An's apartment was perfectly located for our 24hr trip.  Everything we wanted to see and do was within walking distance and it was great being so close to the water.  Loved watching the sun set on the roof terrace!
3139847,18462599,2014-08-26,20434535,Robert,The reservation was canceled 30 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
3139847,19417524,2014-09-12,8851839,Meghan,"I have nothing but great things to say about both the renter and the apartment itself. Lovely apartment, clean, modern, and had everything a person could want in it. Having a washer and dryer was such a relief. The location and view were amazing, as well as the little outside balcony area. All the downtown destinations were a short 4-5 block walk away. It was easy to contact and get feedback from An, she really took care of me. Also worked with me, when it turned out i needed to checkout early. Went above and beyond for me, I will rent from again anytime i am in the Seattle area. Great host!"
3139847,22039717,2014-10-28,1912037,Andrea,"An , was a great place to hang for a quick weekend!!  Proximity for walking to some great sites and  restaurants was wonderful!!!  What a sweet view from the bedroom at night, the lights of the harbour, the sunsets and sunrises, beautiful.  Your place was straight up clean and simple, easy communications with you, made the trip so easy and uncomplicated. Thank you for the pleasure of staying there:) Andrea 

"
3139847,22387506,2014-11-04,10088394,Tonmoy,"Our host, An, and the rental unit at the Arthouse contributed to both a fantastic trip to Seattle and an excellent first time Airbnb experience.

An was not only prompt and friendly throughout the entire experience and even went out of her way to make sure we had a steamer to use, since the apt doesn't come with an iron.

As for the unit itself, the location can not be beat!  It was the perfect location for frequent visits to Pike Place market as well as walking distance to great bars and restaurants in Belltown.  The unit was more than enough space for the two of us and the views were jawdropping.  I was able to capture some spectacular photos of the waterfront.  However, as some others have mentioned, the street below is heavily trafficked and it is quite noisy in the apartment, despite being located on the 7th floor. My wife sleeps with earplugs, and I found myself needing a set as well to sleep throughout the night.  Other than the noise from traffic, I didn't have any complaints at all.  I'd pick this place again without hesitation"
3139847,22567163,2014-11-09,20523221,Jessica,"An, your place was the most well equipped place I have stayed at. Better than any hotel hands down. I would defy recommend you to anyone in the future"
3139847,23060841,2014-11-22,5136929,Amelia & David,"Location, location, plus guarantee restful nights of sleep!  Most importantly, An is really a fantastic host.   Due to hectic travel schedule,  David had an extra late check-in,  ~12am.  However, that didn't face An, she was caring and there for David upon arrival.  In addition An had to adjust reservation due to parking, she is remarkably nice.  Our work demands us to travel none-stop, we feel very appreciative of how An facilitated David's say,  making it absolutely effortless. Thank you An!  "
3139847,23199339,2014-11-24,24008579,Steve,"An was a great hostess.  She met me on time to deliver the keys, was very friendly and was flexible with the checkout time.  The apartment was clean, well decorated and in a great location.  I would highly recommend not only this property but also An as a hostess."
3139847,23714461,2014-12-08,24089320,Kamelia,"An was the most gracious host possible! And the posting doesn't do this fabulous apartment justice! She provided us with anything and everything you can imagine, beyond what even 5 star hotels provide. It was the first time I had used this site and thanks to An I will definitely use it again. I hope all listers on here are half as thoughtful and caring as her."
3139847,24007037,2014-12-16,24278740,Brett,"Amazing experience!!  Jen and An were phenomenal in their timely response and accommodations.  Met us on time as we arrived later in the evening with a smile on her face!  Gave us a detailed tour of the building and unit and we were on our way.  If I had any questions, they were answered immediately either through text or call.  The unit itself was fantastic!!  Views were unbelievable!  Neighborhood was perfect to get around the city, with awesome restaurants and 2 blocks from Pike Place Market.  My girlfriend and I walked 2 blocks east and had one of the best sushi dinners I have ever had!!  I would highly recommend this place and will definitely request this on my next trip to Seattle!!  Amazing experience!!!!!"
3139847,25251882,2015-01-10,1119999,Maeyen,A lovely condo in a lovely location.  Great for feeling safe when you are alone and out of town in Seattle.  The host was friendly and did all that she could to be kind.  Thank you very much.  
3139847,25488627,2015-01-17,9879040,Malia,"Summary: Unbelievably great host + great space! 

About the HOST: We received incredible communication from our hosts. We had a long list of unique circumstances in a short amount of time and the hosts were very flexible in accommodating and responding quickly & clearly to our questions. This made our last minute plans stress-FREE and very enjoyable. 

About the APARTMENT: I will say, the pictures do not do this place justice. I walked into something even greater than the nice pictures posted. The view + radiant lighting coming in from the windows during the day is beautiful. We had tea on the deck while looking at the stunning water view. The bed was extremely comfortable and the heaters circulated perfectly, which was very necessary for our Seattle January stay. It was an easy place to make a temporary home out of. The building this space is in? Well, it is very modern and artsy in the best way - even the lobby is accommodating. It welcomes you with guest seating; booths, tables, and bar seating perfect for hosting friends or for short meetings. There is also a coffee and tea station, along with a really cool insta-ready swing seat to greet you at the front door. 

About the LOCATION: Extremely close to everything you would want to go to in Seattle. Everything is about a 5 minute walk away. Any thing beyond that was no more than a $4 uber ride away. 

All in all, a great stay. We left very slowly and with that tiny anchored feeling you get when you are about to leave a great place and head back to real-non-vacation life. Still, the greatest part of the stay were our hosts and their responsiveness, flexibility, and generosity! 

We will be coming back to stay again, very soon. "
3139847,25998084,2015-02-01,24847639,Javier,"El apartamento es espectacular. Las fotos no le hacen justicia, es mucho mejor que en las fotos.
Tiene unas vistas increibles de la bahia, con mucho sol a traves de los ventanales y unas puestas de sol impresionante.
Estaba muy limpio y tenia todo lo que necesitamos durante nuestra estancia. Tener lavadora y secadora fue un plus muy importante para nosotros ya que estuvimos una semana.
El barrio es tranquilo y seguro con todo lo necesario cerca y puedes ir andando practicamente por toda la ciudad
La anfitriona fue muy amable con nosotros, se preocupo de que todo estuviera bien durante nuestra estancia."
3139847,26218094,2015-02-07,2744556,Abby,"I greatly enjoyed my stay in Jen's condo rental! It is exceptionally clean and modern with everything a traveler needs to settle into a new city and amazing views of the waterfront. I don't think I could have found a better place for my stay in Seattle. The location was also perfect for me - steps from Belltown, museums and Pike Place. Jen was very easy to coordinate with and stayed available throughout my visit. You will love this spot!"
3139847,26680763,2015-02-17,16394853,Stephen,"My girlfriend and I stayed at Jen's over Valentines day weekend. Jen was very accommodating to our early check in and later check out requests. The apartment was beautiful and perfectly located for a couple that has never been to Seattle before. Nothing, including Pikes Place, The Space Needle, all of the incredible restaurants we went to - was out of walking distance from the apartment. The apartment was more spacious than the pictures gave it credit for and the view of Elliot Bay is perfect, which you can appreciate from virtually every point in the apartment due to the large glass windows. My gf and I also used the gym in the building and enjoyed the roof deck as well. Would definitely stay here again the next time we are in Seattle!"
3139847,27040969,2015-02-23,27901108,Marshall,"Beautiful little apartment, brand new, beautiful view!  Jen was a great host."
3139847,27185881,2015-02-27,13041714,Miguel,"Jen, was very helpful. She left a small gift upon our arrival. She supplied a booklet that listed helpful phone numbers and activities to do. She was very available and responded promptly to our requests. The apartment was beautiful and located near EVERYTHING! The sunsets from the apartment over Puget Sound were amazing!"
3139847,27594398,2015-03-08,27382912,Jean,This is our first time using Airbnb and we couldn't have asked for a better host and a better experience. Jen had been very accommodating with all of our requests and the condo itself had everything we needed for our stay and more. The view is amazing and we also appreciated that a lot of the places we wanted to see are within walking distance. Thank you again and we're looking forward to staying in one of Jen's properties on our next visit.
3139847,27818214,2015-03-12,14566822,Alex,Everything was super super lovely! Really nice spot with an even better view.
3139847,28190276,2015-03-19,29250548,Mark,WOW is right! Jen was AWESOME and even met us there!  the place was perfect for us.  location was walking distance to everything and Super  cozy!  Thanks Jen for a great adventure.
3139847,28395721,2015-03-23,5279313,Mikiko,"My family and I had a wonderful stay at this beautiful condo. We were able to walk to so many places in the area, which was perfect for us since we didn't have a car. We really enjoyed the spectacular view as well. The building also comes with a fully equipped gym which was really awesome. "
3139847,28570598,2015-03-26,444564,Kai,Great location on the edge of Belltown very close to Pikes Place Market. New contemporary building with beautiful views of the water and harbor. The unit was clean and modern and worked out well. It has a nice fitness center and a coffee and tea bar in the lobby. There is a bit of noise from the street and trains but with the windows closed it was fine. Jen the host was great and met us there. We would certainly recommend it!
3139847,28930084,2015-04-01,8131553,Helen,"Fantastic location with a phenomenal view! This modern, centrally-located apartment was a perfect home-base for our week-long stay in Seattle. Waking up to panoramic view of Puget Sound each morning was a real treat, as was the building's close proximity to some of our favorite eating and drinking spots in downtown Seattle, such as Macrina Bakery (unbeatable breakfast), Tavolata, Roccos (for NYC-style pizza), and Rob Roy (one of Seattle's, if not the country's, best cocktail bars).  To work-off all the food we ate, my husband and I took advantage of the small, but well-equipped gym in the building, as well as of the path through the Olympic Sculpture park  for scenic morning runs.  This is an exceptional rental for couples wanting to spend time in Seattle, whether its your first visit or you're a regular visitor. "
3139847,29637607,2015-04-10,30240280,H Kyle,"Jen met us at the door of the Arthouse...she walked us up to the unit and answered all our questions about Seattle. She was very friendly and accomodating of our requests. The place has an amazing view and is walking distance from Pikes Market. We felt very safe as the security in the building is tight and knowing Jen lives nearby should we have issues was comforting. We could park the car  free after 8pm which we did each night and Seattle is famous for it's many coffee shops so we could drive a few blocks and grab breakfast easily. We didn't use the kitchen as we were only there a few nights and spending our time visiting the University of Washington but it is well stocked. The whole experience was perfect and our first with Airbnb so we would recommend this condo. It does sit on a busy street so it's not super quiet in the morning if that it what you need, but my teenager slept through it all. We returned home one night right before sunset on a beautiful day and watching the sun go down over Puget Sound was breathtaking. "
3139847,29872738,2015-04-13,30125849,Christopher,Great location! Right downtown near the waterfront with spectacular view. Walking distance to Pikes Place market. Was very clean and comfortable. I was in town for weekend event at the convention center and this was ideal for that. 
3139847,30271732,2015-04-19,15029897,Frank,"The was a last-minute reservation, and Jen was kind and communicative from the beginning. 

The listing itself was great-- I was tempted to request an additional night just to sleep in the bed again!"
3139847,30747516,2015-04-26,2933013,Elizabeth,"My stay was lovely. Jen was responsive and happily accommodated my last minute request for a night's stay.  While we didn't meet, she facilitated a seamless arrival and welcome. 

The apt was very comfortable, clean, just as depicted in the pictures, and a great view! 
"
3139847,30927191,2015-04-29,26329986,Judy,"We had a lovely time in Seattle! Jen was very accommodating, our flight got in early and we were able to leave our luggage at the apartment in between the last guest checking out and before the apartment was cleaned for us. The apartment is a short walk away from Pike Place Market! We had a hard time sleeping since there is a lot of traffic heading toward the freeway on the street out front along with trains coming to a stop a few blocks away. Even with the windows closed it was still pretty noisy. "
3139847,31149150,2015-05-02,20841503,Lori,"I was very pleased with my experience with Jen's apartment.   The apartment was super clean, perfect for 1 or 2 people (bed a little small for 2 people (adults) but perfect for one.   View was fantastic.  All in all it was great.    The street noise is definitely loud, there is no getting around that.   However, Jen has a sound machine right by the bed and a fan in the closet.  You can definitely drown out the street noise.  Even though I""m a light sleeper, I""d stay there again.  "
3139847,31468529,2015-05-05,2335525,Nancy,Jen was a great host. Offered us suggestions when we asked and was readily available when we tried to contact her. 
3139847,32052043,2015-05-13,27544113,Rebecca,"This place was way better than we expected. Great communication across the board. Great location.. But what REALLY made our trip just over the top was the view! When you visit Seattle, THATS the kind of view you imagine. HIGHLY recommend."
3139847,32402351,2015-05-17,27743675,Spencer,I enjoyed the apartment with an ideal location and it was very clean. I really appreciated the directions and all the information provided by Jen. Being by Pikes Market was a real treat. I would definitely stay here again.
3139847,32678415,2015-05-20,3248868,Jonathan,"My experience was excellent. The unit was clean, and as described has a fantastic view from the living room and small deck. The location is perfect - plenty of shopping, restaurants, and parks within walking distance. We never once used our car - walking or taking public transportation wherever we went. As others have mentioned the unit is set up for a couple - with one bedroom - my son ended up on the couch (which was fine). Jen was available throughout our stay to answer my questions in our case mostly about parking (if you need parking let Jen know before hand so she can orchestrate - otherwise you can easily park in the parking garage across the street). Highly recommended if you're looking for a nice place to stay while in Seattle."
3139847,34062950,2015-06-04,7254212,Penny,We had a great stay in the apartment and Jen made us very welcome .Great location and lovely spacious apartment
3139847,34419686,2015-06-08,10953395,Patricia,Great location and water views. However the second bed turned out to be an air mattress which was disappointing after picking this listing to accommodate my son's overnight visit.
3139847,35441745,2015-06-18,9859569,Trajan,"Jen and her place were fantastic. Checking in was easy and the place perfectly clean and well appointed. The location was spot on, but just a heads up to those who are sensitive to road noise, there is a fair amount. 

Otherwise I'd highly recommend this place. Jen was easy to communicate with and lots of great places to eat around the area."
3139847,36000876,2015-06-24,26072479,Kerrie,"Thanks Jen for taking care of us we had a great stay. The appartment is lovely and the view is spectacular! The bed is small but we aren't large people so it was comfortable. We shut the windows and turned on the fan to sleep and slept well. The appartment had ever thing we needed and its walking distance to all the down town treasures.
We would stay there again."
3139847,37433248,2015-07-06,37424485,Eric,"This was the perfect spot! We stayed at the apartment for the 4th of July and had front row seats to all of the waterfront and celebration. Extremely close to great sushi, drinks, and Pike's Place. The apartment itself was clean, open, and inviting. I will keep this apartment in mind the next time we are in Seattle!"
3139847,38802509,2015-07-18,38515275,Selin,"The condo was clean and neat when we arrived and it was easy to access. There was also parking (at an extra cost) in the building which was also a nice added bonus. Neighborhood was great, good access to Pike Market and water, as described. At the time we went, it was very hot outside and luckily there was a stand alone A/C in the condo but it wasn't very efficient so we had to open the windows, which made it very loud, as it's on a busy street. As added treats, there was also a Keurig coffee machine, popcorn and oatmeal on hand which was great! The lobby also had free coffee and wifi! Overall, the condo met our expectations and we enjoyed our stay in Seattle! Thank you! "

Including items in the unit like brochures, local menus, maps, coffee :) etc was a nice touch. We had everything we needed for the stay. Great location downtown with a nice view. We felt everything was within walking distance. "
3139847,45920068,2015-09-07,27093480,Kimberly,"This unit was perfect for our first short trip Seattle. The view was spectacular and the unit was clean. It was very small and the street noise was loud, but we only stayed two nights so it was perfect. Location to Pike Market and Belltown bars/restaurants was ideal. Only a quick, inexpensive Uber ride to Capital Hill. Jen was very communicative and left lots of local information in the unit, which was a nice touch."
3139847,46859265,2015-09-14,26548387,Jeff,"Jen communicated well and called me shortly after I arrived in Seattle.  Jen was great and even provided a complimentary bottle of wine. The location is perfect if you are looking for equal walks to Pike St market and the Space Needle. The apartment is new; however it is starting to show some wear and tear.  Nothing major just little things like broken cabinet pulls and the mirror in the bedroom. Like most apartments in Seattle there is no A/C and the large west windows really heat up the apartment in the afternoon.  We learned to leave the windows open, run the swamp cooler and pull the blinds."
3139847,48358780,2015-09-25,5352606,Laura,"Jen's condo was fabulous!  Super location, loads of amenities and an absolutely amazing view!  I will definitely be back!"

Jen was very accommodating and always available to answer any questions I had. Check-in and check-out were seamless.

I had stayed at the Sheraton a few days prior and can honestly say that Jen's place was better."

3139847,52471589,2015-10-29,1607237,Dustin,Jen was very accommodating with my last minute booking and late arrival.  I highly recommend this place if you are visiting for a short trip as its perfect to explore The market.  
3139847,54410597,2015-11-19,10396908,Adrian,"Jen's place was great - Clean, comfortable, modern, well-equipped and in a great location. Really nice view of the sound, as well.  I look forward to staying here again in the future!"
3139847,55640156,2015-12-03,444646,Anthony,"Jen has a nice airbnb rental property setup. The place has all of the basic items you would need for a stay of a few days.  The best part about the rental is the location.  It is about a 9 minute walk to Pike Place Market.  I went there everyday.  Plenty of spots to eat there as well as a large Target.  It was nice to be able to see the sun come up on the water and to watch the ships go by.  The bed was extremely comfortable!  Huge plus, in my book.  I would absolutely stay here again.  Only two small cons to the stay. 1. The couch is not comfortable. Since there is no TV in the bedroom, you may want to lounge around on the couch to veg out, but it's very hard. It folds out as a futon, but it's not comfortable when unfolded either. It's hard to lean back against it when sitting. On the plus side, this could be a good reason to get out of the apartment and explore the wonderful area!!  2. There is a cleaning fee, but you are asked to help with the cleaning process. I never leave a huge mess, but I prefer not to have to cleaning duties assigned to me if I am require to pay a fee for cleaning.  If there is no cleaning fee, then I don't mind helping with the process of getting things ready for the next person.  Despite those two things, I would still stay here if the price remained low the next time I have to come back to Seattle.  Jen was readily available to answer any questions and the check in and check out process was easy."
3139847,56514867,2015-12-14,858926,Laura,"Great location, able to walk anywhere, amazing views! Loved the place! Check-in/out was so easy also. Building had a nice gym. "
654734,2613239,2012-10-15,3361227,Chris,"Grace was extremely hospitable, providing us with everything we needed for a comfortable stay, including towels and toiletries, simple cooking ingredients for the kitchen, and even a queen size air mattress to accommodate our 4 guests. The condo was in a perfect location, too. Walking distance to anything you'd need to get to in Seattle. Highly recommended. "
654734,2752735,2012-10-29,2096634,Greg,"This is a great pad in a great neighborhood in Seattle. While I regretted not bringing my own bar of soap, this condo had just about every amenity you could wish for, including snacks and maps! Make sure to walk up the street and check out the oyster bar!"

654734,4528529,2013-05-11,5037492,Chris,"I highly recommend staying in this apartment. Grace met us for our week-long visit, showed us the apartment and neighborhood. We stayed in the corner apartment on the 14th floor. It has fantastic views of the city to the west and south. There is a basic grocery store one block up Pike St, and great restaurants on Melrose Ave. We were in town for a convention, and the Center is right across the street. You can look right into the registration area in the south side of the Center. The apartment is comfortably furnished, internet, TV and a great bed. Laundry is available on the 2nd floor in the apartment complex. There is no air-conditioning in the apartment. Ordinarily this wouldn‚Äôt be an issue in Seattle, but the week we were there the weather was clear and temperatures were in the high 80‚Äôs. Interstate 5 is right below the apartment to the west, so if you open the windows to cool down, you‚Äôll get a lot traffic noise. We loved staying here and would do so again."
654734,5035480,2013-06-09,1804836,Daniel,"Grace is a wonderful host. We stayed in two of her apartments for a total of four weeks. As we were travelling with a baby, Grace kindly upgraded us to a bigger apartment without charging extra. We stayed in this larger apartment in the same building for two out of those four weeks. Grace responded to questions I asked her over SMS or email usually within minutes. She even asked if there was something we wanted to see that was hard to reach with public transportation and offered to take us there with her car! When we left the apartment and prepared our way back home, Grace again asked if she could take us somewhere. As a host, Grace went way further than the proverbial extra mile. We're glad that we stayed in her apartment and will be happy to do so again on a future trip to Seattle."
654734,5162355,2013-06-16,6082148,Jocelyn,"I stayed in Grace's downtown apartment while in Seattle for a conference and it was even better than we expected! My husband and 2 YO daughter were there with me and it was probably the best trip we have taken with her. If you are travelling with a small child this is the way to go! Grace was so nice- she met us when our flight got in, let us check in early, and even helped with our luggage! We were upgraded to a bigger corner unit without even asking and weren't charged anything extra. Grace even provided a Pack n' Play for us. The unit was very nice, clean and had everything that we needed. Even the appliances were nice and there was a great TV with cable. The location was perfect- closer to the convention center than ANY hotels and close to parks, shopping and anything downtown.  

We would 100% stay here again and hope that it is available the next time that we are in Seattle! Thanks Grace!"
654734,5292118,2013-06-23,5201678,Larissa,"Grace was very helpful in allowing us to check in a few minutes early.  She walked us thru the place and let us know she was available if we needed anything (I called her twice and she always picked up and was helpful).  Grace has two one-bedroom rentals in the same building--my mom and I were surprised to find that the apartment we booked online was not the apartment we got.  Apparently, she could not tell which apartment we booked thru the online system so definitely keep that in mind when booking (maybe describe the space as they look very different).  She told us that the unit we got was better because it usually cost more and had a sofa bed.  I was bummed to find that the price listed on Airbnb was actually the same for both units and that both had a sofa bed.  I am sure it was a simple mistake but we really would have preferred the other unit--made the best of our stay regardless.  Here is the link to the unit I am reviewing here: https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/1043194.  
The Elektra building is in the process of being updated so while we were in town one of the two main elevators was out of service and water was turned off for a portion of one of the days.  No big deal really but definitely made getting in and out a bit more time consuming:)  Nothing Grace could do about this of course but just an FYI that there are updates being made. The location was perfect for us--we had a conference a few blocks away near the convention center and it was great to have a kitchen to cook in.  Excellent restaurants and cafes nearby: Tango (get the El Diablo dessert), Melrose Market, Victrola Cafe, Blueacre Seafood etc. The unit does not have air conditioning but lots of windows. Also, the in-unit washer/dryer was no longer available for guest use--have to do laundry on the 2nd floor instead. The sofa bed mattress is quite comfortable:)  The neighbors are also very nice and helpful. If you want a bright and colorful space with ample views of downtown, this spot is for you.  Just be sure the apartment you want is the apartment you get when booking and you will have a great stay!"
654734,5691428,2013-07-12,6079537,James,Clean and tidy apartment and a great host. Would recommend.
654734,5905767,2013-07-22,6067424,Jonathan,"Grace was extremely kind and hospitable.  We even hired her daughter to babysit our kids one night!  This is a very convenient location for getting around.  The apartment itself is somewhat small for those traveling with kids but would be perfect for a couple.  While the unit itself is very clean, the building could use some work and the lower floors reek of old cigarette smoke.  But this is not Grace's fault, of course.  So yes, I would rent this place but with these caveats in mind."
654734,6272092,2013-08-06,5945543,Sam,"*Coming from SeaTac airport? Light rail is $2.75 and an hour to Westlake Station on Pine Street; a short 5-8 minutes walk one street over from Grace's place off Pike.*

We stayed for a week in the alternate unit on the 14th floor and it was great. Clean, well stocked apartment with bathroom (tp, shampoo, soap, towels, sheets and pillows and blankets) and kitchen essentials (cookware, seasoning, dish towels) and fans and air conditioning. We were able to host a spaghetti dinner for five one night. Grocery store is a few blocks up and provides paper bags with handles for walking transport.

Five minutes up from the Victrola coffee roasters for great coffee every morning; ten minutes from the heart of Pike Market; ten minutes from the gay clubbing district of Capitol Hill. Chinatown, EMP/Sculpture park/Seattle Space Needle all with 30 mins walk. Taxi rates really reasonable if your feet hurt from hilly climbs.

Grace made sure we knew where the supplies were, major sightseeing areas, and how to lock up. As an AirBnb hostess and better yet, traveller, she anticipated our needs. If you need a local number, she also offers a prepaid phone for your convenience at a daily rate. Recycling is a must in Seattle, so don't forget to separate. Wash and dry are $1 each a few floors down in a dedicated washer room. 

Would return again. Great place to come home to end of night and relax. Thanks so much for offering your place."
654734,6623465,2013-08-19,7446433,Pierce,"Grace was great and greeted me when I arrived.  She was able to accommodate an early check-in when my flight arrived slightly ahead of schedule.  The unit I got was an alternate unit, but still bright, clean and spacious.  Grace took the time to tour the building with me and answer any and all questions about the unit, building and the surrounding area.  The extra touches, like the stocked coffee maker and easily accessible, extra bed linens were appreciated.  I highly recommend this place without hesitation."
654734,7370251,2013-09-17,6311750,Debbie,"I am very satisfied! We were able to take the light rail from the airport to the condo for a couple of dollars.  Grace was really nice and welcoming. We really appreciate the fact that she was able to accommodate early check in. She also made sure we were ok and didn‚Äôt need anything. She gave us her number to call her if we had any questions or needed anything. We asked for permission to order something on paper view and she nicely said yes as long as we paid for it. 

The place was clean and cozy! The location is perfect! We were able to walk to the downtown area for shopping, Pike Market, and Space Needle! We had a fun and enjoyable stay and would come back to Grace‚Äôs apt! 
"
654734,10374813,2014-02-16,3464941,Andrea,"I decided to attend a conference the day before it started. Grace was very accommodating. The apartment was a 1 bed, 1 bath. It was clean, the bed was comfy, and had good water pressure. I didn't use the kitchen but was pleased to see Sriracha in the fridge. The location was great, right between downtown and Capitol Hill."
654734,10673665,2014-03-03,8345885,Sean,"If you are staying at the convention center, this place is about three minutes away. It's quick. It's easy. And it's nice. Cheaper than the conference hotel and bigger by far. Plus a rooftop deck. Yup. I'd stay here again."
654734,11996356,2014-04-21,12622322,Jessica,"This was my first time using airbnb, so I wasn't sure what to expect. Grace was excellent and very accommodating to me. She was quick to answer (or call me back) when I called and asked her some questions. 

Very, very nice place and perfect distance from the convention center, which I where I was attending an anime convention. I stayed with some friends and the pullout bed in the sofa is amazingly comfortable. The kitchen was well stocked. Only thing, you might want to leave the bathroom door open a crack because there isn't a fan and it can get really hot. Also, the residents in the building were nice and smiled when I saw me and acted very welcoming."
654734,12274735,2014-04-28,872984,Ingin,"This is perfect place to stay when attending a convention next door. The first unit I saw in the listings was booked so I opted to go with another on the 14th floor. Although the decor was not as nice as the original listing, the accommodation was comfortable, safe, and very convenient. Grace was also so nice to let us check in earlier. I'd recommend this host."
654734,13208826,2014-05-22,3727783,Amina,"The apartment was lovely, and perfectly situated next to the Convention Center - as well as being within walking distance to Seattle's main tourist attractions. Grace was incredibly friendly and able to accommodate a late checkin. I couldn't recommend this condo highly enough."
654734,13400416,2014-05-27,1182543,Tamara,"Grace was a perfect host -- super responsive, available, and so nice! The apartment was ideal for being close to our downtown conference. Four of us fit pretty comfortably and we all slept well. Grace provided all the amenities, including really nice shampoo and conditioner. One of our favorite things near the apartment was Juicy Cafe in the Convention Center next door -- we started every day with smoothies and oat balls. Overall, it was a great stay, really easy and close to lots of fun Seattle stuff downtown and in Capitol Hill. Hope to stay again someday -- thanks Grace!!"
654734,14820800,2014-06-27,11613159,John,"Great location, and great place to stay."
654734,15530814,2014-07-11,13500917,Szu-Yu,"We stayed there for five nights, the condo was great. We did not meet Grace in person but she was very caring and helpful on the phone. The kitchen was well equipped, which is good for us to prepare baby's food. High chair and baby cot were also a big plus! The condo is spacious for a small family like us with two little kids. The parking space was also very helpful, especially parking in downtown is really expensive. The location was great. It is all walking distance to downtown and waterfront area. Highly recommended for staying in Seattle! "
654734,18870172,2014-09-02,11936338,Soogin,"My friends and I stayed at this apartment for 4 nights. I arrived really early in the morning, and Grace allowed me to check in before the normal check in time which I am so thankful for. The condo is located really close to the convention center. The apartment is way larger than your average hotel, and probably more comfortable. I would definitely stay here again."
654734,20013904,2014-09-22,18729009,Li-Wen,Best first Airbnb experience. It was super easy to get around the this location. Downtown is just a 4 min walk and Pikes Place Market was about a 10-15 min walk depending how fast you walked. The condo was very neat and orderly. It felt like home when we arrived. It's a very quite place to stay at. This experience made my wife and I very happy that we rented the place from Rachel and Grace.  We would definitely stay at this location again.

654734,20618869,2014-10-02,6407138,Tracy,Great condo in great location. My hosts were perfect.
654734,21222134,2014-10-13,3318543,Isa,"My stay in this condo exceeded my expectations. The condo itself is clean, spacious and warmly inviting. The bed was comfortable. The shower head is high pressured unlike the ones you experience when staying in hotels. It was surprisingly quiet considering its proximity to Pike St (a busy intersection), the I-5 and a medical center right around the corner. Restaurants, bars and grocery stores are within a quick and safe 5 minute walk from the condo. I stayed here during the weekend so there's a lot of people walking around, enjoying and partaking in the casual and laid-back nightlife (I come from NYC and LA so I'm fairly confident with this observation). 

As for my interaction with Rachel, she was very welcoming, friendly accommodating because my flight landed early and I was given the option to check in earlier than 4pm. She's also attentive and immensely helpful in terms of giving instructions and answering any questions I had. Conclusively, I highly recommend this lovely condo and would definitely  stay here again when I return!  "
654734,22488478,2014-11-08,21451156,Adam,"My stay was great.  The location was perfect for attending a conference at the convention center, you couldn't ask for a better location.  I wasn't in the room much, but it was perfectly functional for my needs."
654734,28356688,2015-03-22,5136929,Amelia & David,Always our home away from home! Thank you Rachel & Grace:)
654734,28575834,2015-03-26,28368502,Julie,"We stayed four days in Rachel & Grace's place. Everything is perfect here. It is about ten minutes walk to downtown and the public transportation is convenient. The place is secure and clean, having everything you need to live for a few days. I like cooking and the kitchen is great. I also liked the Ralph Lauren blanket in the living room--it is so comfortable. It is just my dream apartment. Thank you Rachel and Grace!"
654734,28861757,2015-03-31,2874972,Jacob,"Me, my wife, and some friends stayed at Grace and Rachel's listing during our visit.  We were attending Emerald City Comic Con, so we were looking for something in close proximity to the Washington State Convention Center, without breaking the bank.  It doesn't get any better than this! Here's why:

1.) A 3-minute walk to the convention center. It was great having our place so close when we needed a breather from the con.

2.) Proximity to Capitol Hill. There were a ton of bars and restaurants, all within walking distance.

3.) Grocery store right up the street.

4.) Comfortably fit 4 people.  My wife and I stayed in the bedroom, while our two friends slept on the couch and on the floor.  No complaints here!

We enjoyed our stay in Seattle, and would definitely consider staying at Rachel & Grace's place again!"
654734,29909690,2015-04-14,26639082,Ian Carl,"Easy and convenient. Great proximity to the Convention Center, just a few minute jaunt to Capital Hill, Downtown, or the water front. The place was pretty much as described, clean, and comfortable."
654734,31875574,2015-05-11,27213405,Michael,"Very convenient location to the Washington State Convention Center  (closer than many hotels) and it was any easy process to get the keys. The condo is as described, nice and clean, however, the pull out couch was not very comfortable. Probably best for 1-2 people sharing the main bedroom. I would stay here again.   "
654734,33666777,2015-05-31,3889823,Enric,"Host was nice and responsive in when getting in, the listing description was sufficient, and we were right next to the convention center, which was very convenient for us.

On the improvable side, the apt was a bit smelly when we got in, only improving somewhat after we left the windows open for a full day. There were no sheets for the extra beds, only comforters (not very hygienic), and most importantly, the fold-out bed was busted. We called the host and she said they'd take a look, but after 5 days there nobody showed up, and so the experience was quite uncomfortable.

In addition, despite the location being optimal if you are attending the convention center or wandering around downtown, the unit is quite pricey if compared to hotel rooms.

"
654734,34731807,2015-06-11,22551469,Hsuehhung,"It's a very cozy accommodation, very close to the city center.
When I arrived Seattle and try to contact the host but no one answer at first, let me feel worried. However they called back soon.
"
654734,34980955,2015-06-14,17299191,Bethenie,Excellent location and apartment condition. Would definitely stay again!
654734,41925205,2015-08-10,30303833,Dominic,Great experience with my stay. Rachel and Grace we're friendly and helpful and the space was everything we could have wanted! We are already considering staying here again next year.
654734,46147910,2015-09-08,7625104,Carol,This was our first trip to the wonderful city of Seattle. Grace and Rachel's place was perfect. (Lovely and the location was awesome) Our host was so very hospitable and very helpful with area information . 
654734,51576212,2015-10-21,30985732,Christopher,"Rachel and Grace were great!  We booked last minute (not how I like to do things, but it happens)  and they were very accommodating.  We flew in after my parents did and they were worked with us so they were able to check in way early so they didn't have to drag luggage all over Seattle. Great location-great accommodations. The only down side was that the carpets were pretty stained in the entryway and down the hall.  "
7900056,47765951,2015-09-21,42432892,Benchmarc,"Jim's place was exactly what the 8 of us were looking for in a nice, clean, no-frills ""basecamp"" for a wedding weekend.  The 4 bedrooms and 4 real beds are a rare commodity in the Wallingford neighborhood, and there was plenty of space for each couple to spread out in privacy AND hang out together in common areas.  The house is in a great spot for walking to coffee, bars, donuts, dinner, grocery, pharmacy, parks, and everything Green Lake has to offer.  Jim's communication was excellent and the experience was as easy as you hope for with a great Airbnb host."
7900056,48569165,2015-09-27,844050,Caylin,"We had a group of 9 stay at Jim's apartment, with prior approval. The location and size were great for us. Unfortunately, the apartment was not clean upon our arrival. We notified the property manager that we were a bit disappointed at check in. 

He helped us clean up the dirty floors, bathrooms, and dishes. We also later found had dirty sheets on one bed and issues with the TV and washing machine. 

The most disappointing part of our stay was dealing with the owner, Jim. He was difficult to deal with throughout our stay and put a black cloud over our vacation.

I would not recommend staying at this location - save yourself the headaches.
"
7900056,49500898,2015-10-04,6760471,Andrew,"The house was even better than the description. My friends and I had a wonderful stay at Jim's place. The location and size was excellent. Communication was very quick and straightforward and we had no issues whatsoever.

A+, highly recommend"
7900056,50394792,2015-10-11,12633960,Robert,"We rented Jim's place for an out of town group of sales reps.  The location was great for us, since our office North of the city.  If you have time, the park is very close.  Easy to find, and the street parking was easy as well.  The home/duplex was plenty spacious for our guests, and we took advantage of the kitchen to eat in.  Jim was very quick to respond to emails, and we had no need to contact him during the stay, everything was in order as described.  We already talked about using the home again next year."
7900056,52713020,2015-11-01,42919987,Helene,"Vi √§r mycket n√∂jda med huset vi bodde i, perfekt n√§r vi var m√•nga. Bra att huset hade kodl√•s s√• att man slipper h√•lla koll p√• nycklar. Vi hade √§ven n√§rhet till v√•r sl√§kting vi h√§lsade p√• och att huset ligger n√§ra den underbara Green Lake. Husv√§rden var l√§tt att f√• kontakt med b√•de f√∂re och under vistelsen."
1493197,7200200,2013-09-10,8050230,Sumegha,"The apartment is fantastic and very well maintained. It was smaller than I pictured,but 4 of us were able to stay comfortably and the d√©cor and care taken to furnish the apartment more than made up for it.Fresh, clean towels, clean linens and a really nice welcome package-as good as any boutique hotel! There is no air conditioning, but it didn't feel too hot to us - even though it was 85F outside. And you know what they say - location, location, (email hidden)e space needle is almost in your backyard and Pike‚Äôs Place Market is 10-15 min walk.I walked everywhere - the Olympic Statue garden,Pike‚Äôs Place Market, Central Library(downtown).We did an underground tour and chocolate tour and spent the rest of our time exploring the city ourselves.The Chihuly exhibit was great.Serious Pie is a fantastic pizzeria owned by Thomas Douglas.We also did a short Ferry ride to Bainbridge Island - which has a quaint downtown with a few wine tasting rooms and some nice art galleries.Darik was great-we checked in very late on a Saturday night and though we didn‚Äôt get to meet him, he was easily available by phone and made sure we had everything we needed for our visit.  "
1493197,7612455,2013-09-26,5477016,Matthew,"The Space Needle Oasis was fantastic! My wife and I thoroughly enjoyed staying at Darik's place in Belltown, as it was perfectly situated between the Seattle Center, the waterfront and downtown Seattle with Pike Place, etc. You can walk to everything and the views from the apartment patio are amazing. You can fall asleep at night with the Space Needle glowing right outside your window. 
Sarah (part of Darik's team) was superb and made the check-in process a breeze. We had easy access to help but really didn't need it as everything was so simple and easy to understand.
The apartment itself is very nice, quiet, and modern with all of the amenities you could want. They even provide you with some nice little treats on the welcome tray! 
In short, I highly recommend Darik (as well as his staff!) and the Space Needle Oasis. It is well worth the money and will set you up for a perfect stay in the Emerald City. "
1493197,7815283,2013-10-04,3731551,Jesse,"Great place, wonderful location, easy check-in"
1493197,8613704,2013-11-08,7826822,Daniel,"Great location, impecably clean, nice ambient deco, rooftop was better than the needle itself, overall i would stay again if i visited Seattle!

"
1493197,9126746,2013-12-09,3947620,Tam,Wonderful stay and location! It was easy to coordinate with Darik and checking in and out was extremely efficient. We would definitely consider staying here again in the future as it was central to all restaurants and main attractions. The space was clean and and well kept.
1493197,10679954,2014-03-03,11237749,Kirk,"This was my first airbnb and man were we impressed. Darik was very helpful and responsive prior to our arrival and the space was incredible. The location was great and the decorating was very ""homey."" Thanks for such a great experience."
1493197,11080947,2014-03-19,2295747,Warny,"This place is so modern and automated that you dont even get to meet your host. Your beeped in and the key is a code and even upon departure you just shut the door after you. If you dont mind this somewhat impersonal rental, youre can look forward to a really nice place, with all thinkable amenities to give you a pleasant stay. Some people say noise and temperature are downside factors to this apartment, I had none of those problems. I enjoyed it very much. Especially the roof terrace!"
1493197,11124880,2014-03-22,12329865,Lynda And Scott,"Great place to stay! Very responsive, helpful and an awesome little neighborhood! Be sure to check out the local restaurants all within walking distance. "

1493197,16709103,2014-08-01,5801274,Lindsay,"Darik left us an awesome gift basket with coffee, tea, and even popcorn!  It was definitely a warm welcoming.  There was lots of information provided about different places to go and see, which was very helpful.  The outside porch was amazing - breakfast outside every morning.  I can't speak highly enough about the roof top area.  The sights were amazing.  Definitely must hang out long enough to catch a sunset.  I would recommend this place to anyone and everyone.  It's also in a perfect location for museums and Pike Place Market."
1493197,17815163,2014-08-18,1870391,Alice,"Very new and well equipped. Location is very central with a lot of good food and pike place nearby but sorta far from the distinctive neighborhoods of Seattle with a car. The space is smaller than pictures but very comfortable for 4 people. Rooftop deck is amazing like everyone says. Overall a good experience and less costly than a hotel in the same area. Hosts are very responsive and helpful, even if it's run by a somewhat impersonal company."
1493197,20210340,2014-09-25,11164877,Steve,This place far exceeded my expectations.  The view from the rooftop is amazing and the view from your private balcony is fantastic too.  The apartment was clean had every amenity we could possibly need.  The location is close to a busy bus stop which made getting around by public transportation a breeze.
1493197,22678417,2014-11-11,23258106,Scott,"The listing was accurate and the unit was as pictured.  It's in a great neighbourhood with downtown/Pioneer Square/the stadium district walking distance away.  Check our 5 Points Cafe for breakfast/lunch and Street Bean for espresso to get a slightly rough-around-the-edges but delicious taste of Belltown.

Being in an apartment like this really felt like we were staying in Seattle as locals, rather than in a hotel.  Wi-fi worked great and we were able to plan our trip from the apartment without using expensive phone data roaming.

We couldn't have asked for anything more from Darik and the vacation rentals team.  The system is automated so we buzzed in as instructed and obtained our keys that way.  There were no issues so we never actually had any reason to meet them face-to-face.

The balcony is great, and the rooftop patio was a nice touch.  I didn't get a chance to see the gym, but maybe next time - yes, I'd definitely use Darik and the vacation rentals company again."
1493197,36384036,2015-06-28,6986751,Natasha,"Great host! The patio was the best part, large, with a wonderful view of the Space Needle. We had two cars, one parked in the garage, and the other on the street. I was worried about parking but it was easy to find and the meters have an app you can pay from with your smartphone. Super simple and we didn't have to worry about heading back to the car. 

The only downside were the room sizes, both are fairly small. 

I would recommend this place for a weekend trip!"
1493197,40880596,2015-08-03,23035575,Elsa,"We loved staying at the Oasis. The neighborhood was perfect for exploring Seattle.
The check-in was smooth, however we were supposed to get 2 sets of keys but only got one. Luckily it turned out not to be a big issue during our 9 days.
I will definitely recommend the Oasis!"
1493197,42390634,2015-08-13,34020575,Tc,"This house is perfect for families spend some time at Seattle! We really have some great time in Seattle. The decorations of this apartment is exactly what you can see online! The checkin process are very fluent. Dairk and his team also have a vocation guide (includes food, place you could go, etc) for travelers. Travel with families."
1493197,45236117,2015-09-01,10673901,Suzanne,Easy to check in. Apartment was very clean and rooftop was nice place to hang out. 
1493197,46877105,2015-09-14,12709676,Stephanie,The space was beautiful and the pictures are an accurate description of the space. The roof was also amazing and we went up there every night! The location was great and we would definitely stay here again when we visit Seattle. 
1493197,49089815,2015-10-01,7181977,Amy,The host canceled this reservation 302 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
1493197,49592203,2015-10-05,17933027,Warren,"The apartment was great! The private deck was amazing as was the roof top deck - incredible views of down town Seattle. The location was excellent as well. Easy walk to Pike Place Market, SAM, and Serious Pie (the best pizza!).

Would definitely stay here again.
"
1493197,54573721,2015-11-22,993640,Carlos,Very nice apartment in a very nice location . We enjoyed the view from the roof terrace even thought it was cold . 
1493197,56010945,2015-12-07,3481329,Joe,"The host was very responsive as we needed a place at short notice after our original property fell through.  
Location was great as it's very central along with being close to the space needle and the mono rail.
Unfortunately however the property wasn't as clean as we would have liked and the heating didn't seem to work, which was a shame as it was a particularly cold and wet weekend.  When we raised these issues to the owners they were very quick to try to get it resolved but given we were only there 3 nights we didn't take them up on the offer.
Had the property been cleaner and the heating working then we'd have given 5 stars.
"
317248,1535141,2012-06-22,2341262,Kaci,"Great host - very quick to reply when I had any questions. Also a very nice house! The decor is great, it's comfortable and has all everything you could ask for!"
317248,1796792,2012-07-25,288553,Michael,"Joe was the perfect host...The property discription does not do it justice, it was very clean, comfortable, and the locaton was fantastic within walking distance of public transportation great dining and shops.
Communicating with Joe was seamless and responses were very quick.

This was are first time in the Seattle area and the property had the comforts of being at home without the stuffiness of the chain hotels. This made our stay very enjoyable and plans for a return trip in the future, with every hope of having Joe for our host again.

317248,2189967,2012-09-04,2282498,Mathew,"This place was perfect for our group - Way better than staying in a hotel.  Located right in the middle of a great neighbourhood, we were able to walk everywhere we needed to go, and if we were feeling lazy it was a $10 cab ride from the heart of downtown.  Will definitely book again if I visit Seattle in the future."
317248,2392931,2012-09-24,3281258,Anne,"My friends and I were coming to Seattle for a wedding and really loved this place - it was clean, modern, and had plenty of room for us all! The house is a great base to explore Seattle and the local neighborhood is really nice - we especially appreciated the recommendations for coffee shops!

Joe was a great host and answered all our questions promptly, including recommendations for the ever essential dry cleaners and pizza places. When one of our group arrived early on a red eye from Hong Kong, he let us check in early. He even mailed back a phone charger that one of us left behind! 

The house was great and all of us were commenting on the beautiful design and comfort of the rooms. A great place to stay!"
317248,5224174,2013-06-19,469839,Shirley,"Outstanding experience at this beautifully decorated and furnished home located within walking distance of cafes, pubs, stores, library, and grocery stores.  All the comforts of home for our multi-generational family from Los Angeles to attend our granddaughter's college graduation.  We had the ability to cook wonderful meals and be together as a group.  Our stay was for five days and we all went home wanting to stay longer.  
Shirley & Terry "
317248,7113153,2013-09-07,6836196,Kerry,"My friends and I had a wonderful stay at Joe's condo while we were in town for a wedding. Everything about the place exceeded our expectations. The place was exactly as advertised, and Joe was very responsive and professional. The location was perfect for us, near many restaurants in a trendy part of the city, but also within walking distance to the downtown area and all the attractions. We would definitely stay here again."
317248,9854017,2014-01-14,3401018,Steve,Cool place! We enjoyed staying there and the process was super easy. 
317248,10673554,2014-03-03,5016457,Tara,This is a beautifully well-maintained home in an excellent location in Capitol Hill. We easily walked to Volunteer Park and the great Volunteer Park Cafe and down the hill to Cap Hill staples like Eliot Bay Books. Coffee shops around every corner. A quiet retreat in the city managed by a very attentive host. This place tops our AirBnB experiences.
317248,46769329,2015-09-13,42069537,Maximilian,"While we didn't have the opportunity to meet the hosts in person, they made it very convenient for us to self check-in/out of their beautifully furnished modern home that's conveniently located within Capitol Hill.

At 3 bedrooms and 2 bathrooms, the house provided our party of 5 with the perfect base of operations for our 3 day stint in the Emerald City. The space is highly recommended.

Pros: Prime location, *multiple bathrooms*, clean, parking spot, comfortable bed, accommodating host let us check-in three hours earlier than we were supposed to. (This last bit was especially gratifying considering we landed so early!)

Overall: 5/5
"
317248,51064088,2015-10-17,24932393,Brian,"Joe's Vintage Capital Hill home is fantastic. We would recommend it to anyone who wants to stay close to downtown, but in a comfortable house and in a great neighborhood. Thanks for a wonderful stay!"
317248,52721431,2015-11-01,2589375,Austin,"The listing is almost better than was depicted. The space was perfect for 6 of us to stay. The kitchen was fully equipped to enable us to cook dinner and the common area was a great size.  Everything was very clean, well stocked, and comfortable. The location was also perfect to enable us to explore Seattle - close to downtown, bars, and everything else. Would absolutely stay here again!"
261912,1199873,2012-04-30,464662,Ruby,"I needed a place for my family to stay for a long weekend during our wedding.  Natalie's place was perfect for this - it was close to our venue & also close to our house.  Natalie was perfectly accommodating & perfectly hospitable.  She made everything so much easier & I never felt like I had to worry or feel the least bit stressed knowing that my family would be well taken care of in Natalie's beautiful home.  
The house is gorgeous & in a wonderful location close to Greenlake.  I highly recommend staying here if you're in Seattle.  Natalie was a dream to work with."
261912,1249738,2012-05-08,2230324,Aaron,"Absolutely beautiful, very clean and well decorated, and amazing neighborhood! Our hosts were very friendly and welcoming, and responded within minutes to a minor problem we had with the bathtub plumbing. Would /definitely/ stay here again :-)"
261912,1279855,2012-05-14,2265346,Lily,"We had a wonderful stay, the house is perfectly furnished and very clean. The location couldn't be better. Everything was awesome! 
Thank you!!! "
261912,1341074,2012-05-24,688142,Hannah,"We loved this charming house in a great neighborhood. The master bedroom was very comfortable and quiet with dark curtains, plenty of storage and a comfy bed, and the whole house was clean and modern, including a spotless renovated bathroom. Yet it still had the old touches of a classic, classy house that we love. Parking was not a problem - there was always a spot directly in front of the house. Natalie was communicative and helpful, and put us at ease, even though we had along a toddler. We would definitely stay here again. Handy hint: Zeeks has great pizza and they delivered to us in under 30 minutes, after ordering online."
261912,1381805,2012-05-30,1337962,Mike,The place was pleasant and clean.   We enjoyed the neighborhood a lot.  
261912,1589555,2012-06-29,1891520,Matt,"Natalie's place was in a great neighborhood, SOO close to Green Lake, and it was spotless with all the necessary amenities.  Natalie responded promptly to all our needs.  We'd definitely stay here again."
261912,1611434,2012-07-02,125991,Tobie,"my family and i could not have been happier with our stay at this lovely house at green lake! we were coming off an Alaskan cruise and craving a comfortable space and some home cooked meals. the close proximity to PCC, the natural foods store, was a huge bonus for us! we felt right at home. we enjoyed walks around the lake and cozying up in the couches as well as grilling up some fantastic local meals. it will certainly be the first place we will try for any future trips to Seattle!"
261912,1663793,2012-07-09,2347650,Janice,"We had a great time in the Greenlake area and very much enjoyed the Storybook Tudor house.  Our son and his family were just a few blocks away so we were able to spend most of our time with them.  We went to the Market and had lunch at Lowells, just a 20 minute bus ride away.  We went to the zoo which is not all that far from the house where we stayed.  We especailly enjoyed having the lake so close!  It was a treat to walk early in the morning and just people watch.  We would recommend this house for anyone going to Seattle and wanting to enjoy a bit of the city in a semi-residental area.   "
261912,1834208,2012-07-30,1778741,Janna,"We had a fantastic three weeks staying in this perfectly-located apartment!    It was spotless when we arrived and we had everything we needed to be comfortable.  The proximity to Green Lake, restaurants, grocery stores and  major arterials for getting around Seattle is great!  Natalie and Beau were helpful and immediately responded to any questions we had.  We will definitely stay again if possible and highly recommend this darling apartment to anyone visiting Seattle.  "
261912,1866689,2012-08-02,1885198,Svitlana,"Great, Super Location! We would like to stay here next time again!"
261912,1946445,2012-08-11,2150400,Marc,"What a great place for a family of five.  We found it clean, spacious, comfortable and convenient.  We loved being so close to Green Lake and took advantage of the prime location every day.  The home had all the amenities you could ask for including appliances, books, washer/dryer and many more.  Natalie and Beau were great hosts who were accessible by phone or email any time we had a question.  We will most definitely return on our next trip to Seattle.  "
261912,2008458,2012-08-17,1299612,Garren & Deirdre,"We had a lovely time at Natalie's home.  It was close to the walking traili at the lake, close to shops and dining and very convenient to get downtown via the bus, which we did many times.  

The home was very clean and well appointed upon our arrival and Natalie maid the process extremely easy and fluid.  This is a great spot for anyone coming to Seattle that wants a home in a nice neighborhood.  "
261912,2037096,2012-08-20,2300965,Sarah,"We loved staying at Natalie's place. It was a great location, very close to everything. We were able to walk and get groceries, and walk around green lake which was gorgeous. It was only a 5 minute drive to the zoo which was great for the kids. The place was cute and clean. Lots of space for us and two kids. 
Thanks Natalie for the great place to stay!

"
261912,2154147,2012-08-31,1241034,Pamela,"The setting for Storybook Tudor couldn't be better with the house just around the corner from the lake.  During our stay, the weather was perfect and we were able to walk around the lake one day - no problem.
It should be noted that the house is on a busy street (though at night with the bedrooms at the back I hardly noticed) so if someone were sensitive to street traffic they need to be aware of this fact.
The kitchen was fully equipped and we found everything we needed.
We also found a wonderful alternative market just up the street.
The master bed was comfy and the bathroom nicely renovated. 
Check-in was easy and when I had a question late at night, Natalie got back to me right away.  Thanks for hosting us.  
"
261912,2443282,2012-09-29,2819916,Kenneth,"Storybook Tudor was a perfect spot for us.  We had wonderful weather the three weeks we were there.  Loved being able to walk around the lake and watching the activity on the lake.  The house was perfect for the two of us.  Washer and dryer were a great help.  We certainly would consider staying at Natalie and Beau's house on our next visit to Washington to visit our son.  The restaurants, grocery store and coffee shops were within walking distance.  
"
261912,3208375,2013-01-01,4175492,Daniel,"Natalie's home is the perfect place to fully experience the essence of the best Seattle has to offer with its proximity to Greenlake, coffee shops, restaurants, PCC (Natural food stores), and it is a great walking neighborhood. The house is fully equiped and felt like our Seattle ""home"". I looked at other choices in this Seattle area and nothing beats this location and accommendations!"
261912,5577472,2013-07-07,5379251,Kai,"This is a wonderful place in a fantastic location just steps from Green Lake. I absolutely loved the location, layout and decoration. For groups of six that need a little privacy it may be a little tight but for families of six with children or two couples with two children it would be absolutely perfect. I did not meet Natalie myself as she was out of the country but all of my interactions with her where very positive, and the check-in and check-out were a breeze. "
261912,5860909,2013-07-20,5591795,Kat,"We stayed at the Storybook Tudor for two weeks with our three children.  We absolutely loved the location.  The home feels like it is practically across the street from Green Lake.  We spent many afternoons at the wading pool in the park (really couldn't be closer), and enjoyed the pizza, ice cream, and chocolate shops greatly.

The home itself was charming, clean, and comfortable, and the check-in process was easy.  We had no need to contact Natalie during our stay, as the notes she left answered all our questions.  All in all, this was a great home base for us, and we'd love to come back someday.  It is worth mentioning that it is an older home with an apartment below, so it was important to keep the kids quiet, especially their little feet!  While I would recommend this home to any family, it might be easiest for families with older children.   "
261912,17757038,2014-08-17,2120070,Dominika,Natalie was always helpful and responding messages quickly. House was very clean. Great spot. Very well located. 
261912,18675507,2014-08-30,11430503,Meriah,"Great location, comfortable house. Air con was a plus on hot days. Backyard seating area while not private was very lovely. May not be as suited for families with small kids, as noise travels between the upstairs and downstairs which is occupied. "
261912,18899319,2014-09-02,19574780,Becca,"Natalie is a wonderful host with a lovely home right near Green Lake. The house was clean, spacious, exactly as described... and Natalie was professional, responsive, and helpful. We could not have had a better experience!"
261912,19891272,2014-09-20,18842364,Debbie,"I had a great stay! Centrally located in a wonderful neighborhood. Nice restaurants and grocers and shops. The heart of Green Lake is the 3 mile lake, the hub of a lovely Seattle neighborhood. The house is on a slightly busy street but it is quiet at night."
261912,24083061,2014-12-19,4152815,Larry,"We really enjoyed our stay. Fantastic location near the lake. Lots of restaurants and coffee shops nearby. Organic market just down the street. The home is cozy and comfortable, with great entertainment options too. "
261912,24400863,2014-12-28,1579024,Stephanie,"Natalie was great from the start!  Very prompt at responding to emails with questions.  We found the house to be just like the pictures.  It was perfect.  Nothing out of place and very clean.  I had a few questions during our trip, nothing urgent, and I heard back from Natalie even though she was on vacation too.  I was sad the bunnies weren't there but they must have been on vacation too.  "
261912,32561310,2015-05-19,31737757,Lara,"The home was very cozy and inviting and fit the description and the reviews completely. It was in a great location, easy to find and close to Green Lake.
"
261912,42442121,2015-08-13,18082819,Jennie,"My two adult sons and I found Storybook Tudor to be a lovely vacation home in an ideal location with all the amenities needed. Scenic walking areas and activities are just steps away at Green Lake.  Good restaurants and local organic market also are within a short walk.  We loved the easy access to bus service into downtown Seattle, Freemont and other sights we visited. Host Natalie was out of town but easy to contact on the few occasions we had questions.  We had an ideal Seattle vacation experience while enjoying the comforts of home."
261912,43123686,2015-08-17,11030949,Bob,The house was nice.  The AC instructions were difficult and it was a hot night the first night but they responded with directions when asked.  The neighborhood is amazing!
261912,57778263,2015-12-29,3717272,Paul,This place was perfect for gathering with family at Christmas. Everything was as expected.
1416763,6315170,2013-08-07,924362,Miranda,"The location is great- right down the street from Seward Park. Darren is friendly, very committed to making your stay wonderful. Any little issues that came up- he took care of them right away. I think he is the process of posting pictures of the downstairs that you are renting.  I would definitely stay here again. "
1416763,6930250,2013-08-30,523790,Alex,The reservation was canceled the day before arrival. This is an automated posting.
1416763,15474556,2014-07-09,17575991,Steven,"We had a wonderful stay in Darren's apartment which is attached to the main house where he lives. It's completely private, but he is as accessible as you need him to be. And a more gracious and accommodating host you won't find! We were delighted when we arrived and walked in and found everything to be spotless, attractive and very comfortable. The neighborhood is quiet, the view of the lake and Mercer Island spectacular, and beautiful Seward Park just 3 blocks away, with hiking trails throughout. Quiet, peaceful, yet close enough to bustling Seattle --a retreat we will certainly return to again. "
1416763,16204061,2014-07-23,842807,Randolph,"Host made me feel welcome and was very accommodating. He even went out of his way to provide an additional air bed and blankets. 

Overall very pleased by the experience. Thank you. "
1416763,16922549,2014-08-04,3889941,Serkan,"Darren is one of the best hosts I've ever seen. He made us very welcome in his house. Everything was clean and ready before we come in. 

Place was bigger than we expected, it was also very comfortable.

Place is located at a very nice quiet neighborhood, we didn't have any problems at all. We didn't need to use public transportation but as far as I heard there is a bus stop right next to the house which can take you downtown."
1416763,18805740,2014-09-01,4106809,Timothy,Darren was an amazing host and the place was perfect for a few guys in need of comfortable living arrangements where we could also get work done.  Location on the lake was beautiful and great for running and getting some exercise.  Darren exceeded all our expectations and made damn well sure we had the most comfortable stay possible!  Highly recommend.
1416763,22625893,2014-11-10,23229017,Will,"I had a great stay in Darren‚Äôs apartment and he was a very good, friendly host.  There are really nice views of the lake and Mt. Rainier from the living room and dining/bonus area, which makes for a relaxing stay.  It is located in a quiet neighborhood outside of downtown and within easy walking distance of Seward Park, which has some great trails.  The house is less than 1 mile from a good natural foods store and just 1.5 miles from Columbia City, which has nice, quaint restaurants and shops."
1416763,25827928,2015-01-26,14846507,Melanie,"Visited with my husband and our one year old son, and really enjoyed staying here! Darren is a wonderful host - so nice, and made sure we were comfortable. He was available in case we had any questions, which I appreciated. You can tell that he is meticulous about the cleanliness and maintenance of the apartment. The views are stunning, and the apartment is really huge. Dedicated laundry and a huge TV with all DirectTV channels were huge pluses for us."
1416763,28475914,2015-03-24,24977589,Jorge,"Darren was a great host.  The house was just as described and very spacious.  We especially liked the awesome view and the outdoor deck.  The location could not have been better for us, near our family and 15 minutes from downtown."
1416763,29451599,2015-04-07,16569306,Bryan,"Darren was an excellent host! The house is awesome and has an amazing view of Lake Washington. The pics do not do it justice. Short drive from downtown Seattle and about a 15 minute walk to a great organic market, coffee shop and burger joint. 

Darren was very accommodating with a couple of last minute changes we asked for. Couldn't have had a better experience. I plan on utilizing his space on my next trip to Seattle. Highly recommended"
1416763,32035780,2015-05-12,20911175,Anuj,"Darren was incredibly inviting right from the start. My friends and I were looking for an event venue and had originally booked another AirBnb. When they cancelled last minute we were stressed to find another place and Darren came to our rescue. When we met he gave us a tour of his place and even gave us ideas on how to best use it for our event. Not only was our event a success, Darren was an absolute delight to work with and I would definitely be a guest of his in the future - whether just for a stay or another event."
1416763,33338004,2015-05-26,16569306,Bryan,Love this house. Second time staying and already planning a return. Darren is the best. Very accommodating with a couple requests we had. Couldn't ask for a better host. 
1416763,33747783,2015-05-31,27451603,Leigh,Please see previous review as we extended our stay-- the home was awesome!
1416763,33972885,2015-06-02,27451603,Leigh,Darren is a wonderful host! He was very accommodating he let us come a night early AND he even let us use the entire house. His home is fabulous! It is very spacious and the kitchen was great! The downstairs man cave stole my sons father the entire time. The views are absolutely stunning- what a beautiful way to start the day. Definitely recommend staying here! 
1416763,34172486,2015-06-05,17402035,Chloe,Very lovely!
1416763,35075636,2015-06-15,29070451,Melodi,"Darren was pleasant and very attentive to our requests.  Unfortunately, we had many requests because the house was in need of attention and repair.  We experienced plumbing problems (1/2 bath toilet not working which left 1 bathroom), 2 major appliance malfunctions, and felt the house was sparsely furnished. We asked for more chairs so we could enjoy the beautiful view from the living room and deck, as there was one couch and no patio chairs.  Darren responded positively and found us a few odds and ends.  The two inflatable camp beds supplied in two of the bedrooms weren't as comfortable as a real bed.  Seward Park was nice, and a short drive down the hill.  Due to traffic, our commute to Seattle center was 30 to 45 min."
1416763,35596461,2015-06-20,35167954,Donna,"Host responded immediately to any questions and was very helpful with his suggestions. The setting is magical and living space is more than adequate for a family. Safe neighborhood with parking and very convenient to shops, restaurants and public transportation. "
1416763,35920653,2015-06-23,11458766,Stephen,"Home was a great location for easy access to the city as well as points south (Tacoma,etc). Darren gave us a quick tour when we arrived to show us around the house and was attentive when we needed extra linens. There are 4 bedrooms and more than enough room with a nice covered outdoor deck. The only reason I'm not giving 5 stars is because two of the beds were air mattresses. If you don't mind then you really can't beat the price for the amount of space!"
1416763,36122093,2015-06-25,16569306,Bryan,Once again Darren takes good care of my group. A+++
1416763,38112572,2015-07-13,21189419,Niria,Great house! Amazing views!
1416763,38612473,2015-07-17,35029627,Deborah,Amazing view of Lake Washington and Mt. Ranier.   Darren was very flexible with our late arrival and check-in.   
1416763,40724858,2015-08-02,31316474,Michael,Darren greeted us as we arrived at his home. He was an excellent host and was not only very responsive to questions but also extremely proactive with providing any assistance we needed. Would definitely recommend this home and Darren's excellent hospitality. 
1416763,42737153,2015-08-15,1352675,Julia,"We were having our house painted so we needed to a place to stay that was kid and dog friendly for our family. The place was perfect for our little ones, close to the park, near great restaurants, and lots of bedrooms and space for the kids to run around. 

Darren was very accommodating and stayed very connected. The only con that I had was the the AC was broken during our stay and it was one of those unusual hot weeks in Seattle so the kids were a bit uncomfortable but we managed to make it work. Plus Darren provided lots of fans. 

The place was clean and tidy and overall we had a great time in the indoor and outdoor spaces. 
"
1416763,44442312,2015-08-26,37131068,Aundra,"Darren's home was wonderful and honestly bigger than I thought it would be.  The picture of the view can't do justice to the experience of sitting out on the porch looking out over the lake, it's beautiful and very refreshing.  Darren was very helpful and friendly.  We highly recommend staying at his home.  Thanks Darren!"
1416763,50897452,2015-10-15,46216133,Andrew,Home was great.  We would definitely go back.  The covered deck had great views and we thoroughly enjoyed eating breakfast out there.  Location couldn't have been better for us.  It was within walking distance of lovely Seward Park and the bus stop is right behind the house providing us an easy way to get to downtown Seattle and the airport without a car (after connecting to light rail).  The only issue we had was the place was not as clean as we would have liked.  Place definitely needs to be dusted more often.
1416763,53804163,2015-11-12,21420580,Maya,The host canceled this reservation 3 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
1416763,56185823,2015-12-10,16569306,Bryan,"Due to a last minute scheduling conflict, we weren't able to stay at the house, but Darren rectified the situation."
1416763,58024541,2015-12-31,709196,Jessica,"The house is perfect for a family to stay, with ample space, gorgeous views and a huge kitchen and dining area. Nothing in the house is too precious, so it has a lived-in feeling which made me comfortable having my kids ( 2 and 6) there without monitoring their every move. Darren is very available and kind. We had a perfect stay. "
8147986,47823274,2015-09-21,43646353,Kellanne,"A true urban retreat.  I was met by Arif personally who took the time to point out all the features of his live/work loft.   The space was clean, hip and well stocked for a stay (hairdryer, iron, well outfitted big kitchen, nice towels,etc.).   The location was perfect for us, a block from the Olympic Sculpture Park and 2 blocks from Aqua restaurant (one of my favorites) at Pier 70.   But, I will note, it is a ground floor work/live space right on the street.   The windows are good, so the street noise is not bad and the bedroom is interior and very quiet.  The neighborhood is safe.  We didn't mind being right on the street, but it may not be for everyone.   

The roof deck is great with nice barbecues and an awesome view.   There is also a workout room.   (You do have to go down a couple of doors to get to the entrance to the residential portion and the deck and work out room.)  The bathroom was nice - dual sinks  - with a washer and dryer in the unit.   The electronics are great, if you have time to watch a movie.   

This is a good unit for 2 people. And would be perfect if you wanted a place to work too.  High speed internet and a dining room that is also a conference room - complete with glass ""white"" board.   My only negative is that it is not the most comfortable bed and the small bedroom can be a bit warm.  We would definitely stay here again.  "
8147986,49359475,2015-10-03,3258071,Julian,"Arif was a great host and did a great job of making sure I knew my way around and was comfortable throughout my stay.

The loft was a fun place to have as a base of operations while enjoying a vacation in Seattle and is super close to downtown. It was super clean, had everything available that I needed, and was nice to relax in between adventures.

Highly recommend it, enjoy the stay!"
8147986,51095104,2015-10-17,30071176,Adrienne,"Arif has an amazing space in Belltown. We walked from the studio to Pike Place Market, the Space Needle and to a few of the restaurants we ate at. I loved that the studio was a workspace- there's a whiteboard and a nice table that doubles as a desk that I ended up actually utilizing while there. He had the place fully stocked- from coffee to beer to pens and paper. Netflix, HBO and the works were set up in both main rooms and there was a way to play music at all times as well. I really appreciated Arif's hospitality and definitely wouldn't hesitate staying here again! PS- He even supplied a dog bowl for our baby, as well as bags and treats. I don't have a single complaint. "
8147986,51570810,2015-10-21,3949880,Autumn,"Arif was very helpful at check-in when we circled the block a couple times figuring out where the garage parking was. He showed us around the building and apartment. Neighborhood was nice and a great location within walking distance to a lot of ""touristy"" sites: Space Needle, Pike Place Market, EMP Museum, Chihuly Glass Museum and more.  Only a couple streets away from buses to go downtown and lots of restaurants in the vicinity. City and water views from the rooftop patio. My husband had a great run along the waterfront. On-site parking is a HUGE plus. 

The space was inviting, floor-to-ceiling windows in the living room let in plenty of light, even with the blinds closed. Full kitchen, with plenty of utensils and supplies would definitely be useful for those wanting to stay in and cook (we didn't). Washer and dryer was another bonus, should have packed a lot less! 

The bedroom is smallish, even with just two of us we ended up keeping our luggage in the dining room to keep the floor clear. There was a closet with hangers and a dresser, but we don't usually unpack like that for only a few days. I was worried the bed wouldn't work out well for the two of us since it seems to be a fold-out/convertible couch, but we were comfortable. 

This was a great, affordable home-base for our trip to Seattle and definitely recommend staying her and host Arif. "
8147986,52890724,2015-11-02,46577682,Chris,"I really enjoyed staying here. The place was well kept and the neighborhood wasn't too busy/noisy. This apartment is centrally located, and only a few blocks from multiple metro stations."
8743202,51668700,2015-10-22,26905615,Maureen,"Room was comfortable, quiet, airy, bright.  Bed was comfy with great linens.  Location was terrific, 15 minutes from downtown, and our car was off the street.  Valerie was accommodating, anything we needed she was able to direct or help us.  Her children were over the top sweet and quiet.  My husband was very impressed.  We will be staying there again."
8743202,52293991,2015-10-27,11274242,Loida,"Thank you, Valerie, for being such a warm and accommodating host!  The room was exactly how it is pictured and I felt very much at home. I  truly enjoyed my time in your beautiful place! "
8743202,55549484,2015-12-01,40635509,Jill,"I came into town for a conference and needed a peaceful place to stay. This was an ideal spot for me.  The room was private, comfy and clean and I loved Valerie's cranberry muffins!"
8743202,56154429,2015-12-09,33393351,Stephanie,"Kind and accommodating hostess, comfortable, private room and bathroom on top floor. Cozy bedding and perfect pillows, so far, my favorite AirBnB experience!"
41401,85048,2010-08-26,190574,Sara,"Pina is simply the best!

She adds little touches on your arrival that make you feel very welcome, and she is charming!

The place is very comfortable and has easy public transport wherever you want to go in the city. The apartment has every comfort of home.  We saved quite a bit of money by cooking the meals there.

She adds little touches on your arrival that make you feel very welcome.  All summed up... she simply went above and beyond to make our stay a good one.

Highly recommended!



"
41401,91220,2010-09-06,197948,Josh,Our stay was great. Pina was very welcoming and did she whatever she could to make our stay as pleasant as possible!  
41401,105282,2010-09-26,191607,Fred,"Pina was the best, she was very accomidating to our needs as well as respected our privacy. The accommodations were simple but everything we needed. The place is very convenient to all attractions in and around Seattle. Right on the transit line. The price is very competitive and for the money we could have not done any better. If returning to Seattle I would certainly check with Pina again."
41401,109496,2010-10-01,206203,Amanda,Pina's place is very comfortable and she is a great host.  A pleasant place and close to downtown Seattle.
41401,137463,2010-11-11,277017,Michael,The host canceled my reservation 49 days before arrival.
41401,139590,2010-11-15,200162,Choua,Wonderful hostess! Pina's place had all the amenities of home. Pina was very helpful. The apartment was so much better than staying in a hotel! Good location and easy I-5 access.
41401,145252,2010-11-27,253283,Kimberly,"Pina was very responsive and easy to work with. Due to the snow and the busy holiday week, I didn't get to see her accommodations myself, but my father said it was perfect for his visit. I'll keep Pina in mind for future visitors."
41401,214967,2011-04-02,351137,Melanie,Pina's place was perfect for our month long stay in seattle. There was plenty of privacy but she was around when we needed something and had lots of good tourist tips for us. The apartment is lovely and spacious and she even stocks it with cooking basics and snacks on your first day. The location is pretty ideal for venturing into the city although I would recommend having a rental car. Whenever we travel to seattle again we would definitely stay with pina again!
41401,232736,2011-04-20,360438,John,"The apartment is very well equipt complete with plenty of coffee, milk and cereal to get us started.  Everything was clean, nicely decorated and in a pleasant neighborhood.  Although the location is not close downtown Seattle, it is on a bus route that links with the new train to all city points.  It would work best for people with a car, however."
41401,344221,2011-06-30,640076,Phil,"Property just right for one or a couple for an extended stay.  

Great hostess, charming, considerate and warm. "
41401,468486,2011-08-23,516685,Andrea,"We stayed at Pina's suite in August 2011 for a few days... My hubby and I were welcomed by an amazing host and beautiful suite. It was charming, clean, and very cozy. It was also an excellent location!! We loved checking out the cool artist community in Georgetown, which was just a quick drive away. I would stay here again in heart beat! "
41401,4902196,2013-06-01,5371046,Rhett,"Outstanding, private apartment.  Pina is a marvelous Hostess!  Clean, fully furnished with kitchen, bath, cable, Wifi and even washer-dryer.  Great location that enables easy access to downtown.  Nearby markets and great neighborhood.  Walking distance to Georgetown and many community parks and trails."
41401,5418628,2013-06-29,6779235,Dekker,Pina's home was perfect. Thank you!
41401,6194139,2013-08-03,6772864,Sarah,Stayed here for the month of July.  Wonderful apartment and the kindest host.  You will not regret staying with Pina :) take care all!
41401,6394653,2013-08-11,6793574,David,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay with Pina. We were in Seattle visiting or daugher (who lives 5 minutes away) and this was an ideal place for us. The space was comfortable and had everthing we needed including clothes washer and dryer, which was very helpful. We would stay here again. "
41401,8212061,2013-10-21,8334268,Ivan,"Pina is absolutely incredible, both as a host and as a person. She respects your privacy but is always there when you need help or advice. She made our stay very pleasant and helped us get started in Seattle easily. The apartment is well furnished and has plenty of room. Will definitely recommend to everyone."
41401,8881705,2013-11-24,7344399,Dipika,Pina was very kind during my stay in Seattle. The place is very comfortable and has everything you would ever need! I thoroughly enjoyed my month there and really felt at home. Thank you Pina!
41401,10129843,2014-02-02,9754914,Lindsay,"Pina is very warm & welcoming and a real people person. The MIL suite is decorated nicely and has everything you need, making you feel right at home. The location is central and has quick access to many different areas of the city. I would recommend this charming home."
41401,10402249,2014-02-17,11825934,Craig,"Started with handshakes left with sad hugs. Pi√±a is a grand hostess, makes you not want to leave! Place is cozy and private, nice community and quiet just like the ad says, worth the money and the time. I wish I could live there! New customer and new friend!"
41401,12397022,2014-05-01,11329122,Dan,"My wife and I stayed with Pina during my wife's medical school (email hidden) hospital.  The hospital is only a 5 minute walk from Pina's place which was tremendously convenient, and there are other nearby locations that make this area walk and bike friendly (fruit stand, green space, Chief Sealth Trail).  The 60 bus stops close to the property and will take you into downtown.  It was a delight staying with Pina - she's super friendly, relaxed, and very responsive.  The arrangement in the suite is well-thought out with a particularly nice open plan kitchen / island area next to the living space.  We couldn't have hoped to find anything more suited to our needs.  If ever we need a short stay in this area again, we'll be sure to contact Pina."
41401,16701276,2014-08-01,10569674,Sam,"Pina was a wonderful host and this was a great place for my small family to stay during my internship. We were there for three months, and never had an issue come up with the apartment. If I ever find myself visiting Seattle again I will definitely see if this space is available. The area is very pretty and we enjoyed living close to multiple parks and a fruit stand.

If I had any complaint it is that the internet is slower than I'm used to, but this is mostly due availability in the area. For most people it shouldn't be a problem."
41401,18791329,2014-09-01,8373913,Dale,"The description is perfect, ""Home away from home"" I used to live in Seattle and staying at Pina's was like feeling at home. The apartment is clean, comfortable and convenient to most parts of town. Pina is there if you need her with a smile or leaves you alone to your privacy. I would recommend these accommodations for a ""home"" in Seattle."
41401,23435340,2014-12-01,763755,Cathie,"Pina was a lovely host.  She left us homemade muffins as well as juice and the refrigerator had some basic condiments as well.    The kitchen was well stocked with dishes, pans, etc. and I was very happy to have  a washer/dryer. 

The apartment is very warm and welcoming, is nicely decorated (by Pina!) and furnished and we felt at home immediately.  While this is technically a basement/garden apartment, it did not feel like it. 

The house is on a main street so it has good transit service, but there is no street noise in the unit.  The location is also very central to Seattle so it is a good jumping-off point to areas north, south, east and west via major interstates/highways.  There is also a biking/walking trail a half block away.  

Both the bed and the couch/futon were very comfortable, the linens were nice and there were plenty of extra pillows, blankets, etc.

We stayed for several months and were very happy.
"
41401,30398804,2015-04-21,26002021,Rada,Stayed 2 months with Pina during my initial visit to Seattle.  I needed a place near the VA hospital and this was  perfect.  Pictures on website were exact. This place is clean and huge for one person.  Pina is nice and friendly. She was available to answer any questions.  I recommend this place to anyone coming to Seattle. 
41401,36167506,2015-06-26,26002764,Rachel,"Pina was such a welcoming hostess!  She accommodated our family for 2 months, engaging in delightful conversations with us and our kids, inviting us to gatherings she hosted, and was readily accessible to answer questions when they arose.  The MIL apartment was quiet, ample space, clean, well-stocked kitchen and very comfortable for living in, especially with the addition of the relaxing yard."
41401,39759737,2015-07-26,7775516,Meryl,"Pina was a wonderful host!   She was easy going and very friendly, her mother in law apartment was very clean and had everything we needed for a month stay.  Easy access to the #60 bus that dropped right in front of Swedish Hospital for work,  great grill to cook dinners on and a nice cool apartment on the hot Seattle summer days!  We will certainly keep in touch when back in the area!  Many thanks!"
7093910,44582120,2015-08-27,4510751,Maggie,"My partner and I really enjoyed staying at Ted's place in Seattle. Quite centrally located, it's about a 10-15 minute drive from lots of major sites and neighbourhoods in the city -  Capitol Hill, downtown, and the sports stadiums. The home itself is incredibly comfortable, clean, and tastefully furnished, and very private - an extra plus was the bed - very comfy and welcoming after a long day touring the city! Ted was very responsive to my (many) questions which was very much appreciated. We hope to stay here again on our next visit!"
7093910,47537979,2015-09-20,35451787,Patricia,"Ted's modern home is definitely that. It is in the minimalist style and yet has many fancy gadgets. Ted offers a third separate bedroom ans well as a whole house. The house is centrally located, but ensure you mention Martin King Luther Jr Way SOUTH. There are two such ways.
As the room was not cleaned for our benefit we expect a refund of the cleaning fee of $44.00. Plus as there was no breakfast provided, we expect a refund of $12.50 per person per night allowance for the duration of our stay. We have accepted no clean towels on the first night as a mistake on our behalf. The refund we expect is (phone number hidden)."
6606,5664,2009-07-17,18085,Vivian,"The Urban Cottage is comfortable, beautiful, fun and really convenient!  Joyce is an amazing host and super friendly.  The Wallingford neighborhood is convenient to outdoor adventures, shopping, relaxation, and to lots of buses to downtown.  If you get a chance to stay with Joyce, I highly recommend it!  We will definitely be back again!"
6606,338761,2011-06-27,434031,Elliott,"Joyce was a wonderful host and the urban cottage is a such an awesome place to stay (quiet, clean, comfortable, private).  I highly recommend this place - you will not be disappointed!"
6606,467904,2011-08-22,976182,Allegra,"Beautiful cottage and warm hospitality from Joyce. Even though we never got a chance to see each other I felt welcome. The neighborhood is charming, quiet, and you can walk just a few blocks to good food, drinks and shopping. Joyce was super communicative and cut us a deal as we were only allowed to use the outdoor shower due to the entire house being rented. Don't let that scare you off - it's beautiful and with a little creative towel hanging 100% private!"
6606,480017,2011-08-27,997921,Brittney,"Joyce is a wonderful host! She is warm, helpful and fun to visit with. The cottage is cozy, bright and has all the comforts you could want.  I would stay here again anytime I'm in the area :)"
6606,487278,2011-08-30,206901,Pascal,"Joyce's cottage is the perfect Seattle location! It's close Fremont, Ballard and Wallingford. The cottage has everything you need with a small kitchenette and the toilet. Joyce really knows what travelers like and she provided everything we wished for. It was clean, quiet and utterly convenient. We would love to stay again!
Pascal + Jeanne"
6606,505388,2011-09-06,552477,Ivy,"Joyce's cottage and home were absolutely lovely! So private and pretty, and so centrally located in Seattle. Joyce is a wonderful hostess, offering breakfast, hot tubs, directions and suggestions. I plan on returning again and again. Enjoy! "
6606,570582,2011-09-26,1110380,Wendy,"Sweet little place, quiet, cozy, great location. Loved taking outdoor showers. Composting toilet is just fine, does make the room quite warm."
6606,1322495,2012-05-21,2354750,Sallie,"Joyce accommodated the needs of my daughter and me on very short notice.  We were thrilled at the quality of the Urban Cottage and the guest room.  Having access to the kitchen and bath in the house allowed us to share breakfasts and coffee.  The location in Wallingford is great - walk to grocery store and other shopping/restaurants.  Joyce was helpful, friendly and kind."
6606,1395422,2012-06-01,1845181,Susan And David,"the Urban Cottage was a wonderful place to stay for our visit to Seattle and was very nicely furnished with all that we needed in the kitchen, sleeping area and amenities. The surroundings were beautiful and quiet. Joyce was a warm and fun host.  Susan and David Askue"
6606,1575812,2012-06-27,1821528,Ivan,"Joyce was a great host and she made us feel very much at home. The cottage is in a prime neighborhood in Wallingford with easy access to nearby gas works park (we walked there). She surprised us in the morning with coffee and scones waiting for us on the patio! The garden area was very well designed.

Composting toilet take a while getting used to, but its part of the sustainable lifestyle. "
6606,1685576,2012-07-11,2703414,Susan,"Loved this cottage and beautiful yard.  This is a very quaint spot in a good location.  It's a short walk to Fremont.  
Plus there is a hot tub for the guests to use!  Doesn't get much better than this.

Joyce was a great host-very accommodating, interesting to talk to, and very helpful all-around."
6606,1734779,2012-07-17,1657945,Robert,"Joyce is the perfect host. I cannot say enough good things about her. She is extremely friendly and generous, but also offers plenty of privacy. The cottage is small- perfect for one, very cozy for two. But Joyce thought of everything- rain jackets, bicycles, coffee, beer... She's very up on the Seattle restaurant scene, as well. Her house is perfectly situated just a few blocks from amazing restaurants, Gas Works Park (gorgeous view of downtown Seattle), and a bike trail. 

I have used Airbnb several times now, but have never had a host as thorough or as thoughtful as Joyce. I'm afraid she's set a rather high bar for the future. "
6606,1944994,2012-08-10,2163180,Matt,"Joyce was fantastic and so was the little cottage. Their's the standard stuff: The place was clean, quiet, well furnished, etc.

The real benefit of this place was the little extras you'd never expect. First, their was the garden between the house and the cottage. It was gorgeous and well kept.

Secondly, I happened to arrive when the plum tree in the backyard was producing some incredibly delicious plums. Yum!

Third, I loved the outdoor shower. There is another shower inside but the weather was so gorgeous when I was there that it made showering outside the way to go (and don't worry, it was totally private and in no way uncomfortable).

Fourth, Joyce is just a great host. There was a cold beer in the fridge for me when I arrived and on my last morning she made me a bowl of yogur, granola, and freshly picked blackberries (she had picked the berries herself a day or two before hand).

All in all, I cannot recommend this place highly enough! Perfect!"
6606,2311419,2012-09-17,3212393,Teri,"We had a great time staying at Joyce's cottage! Joyce was an awesome host and made us feel right at home. My boyfriend got sick during our trip and while I was out, Joyce brought him some juice and checked up on him. She also was great at recommending restaurants and gave us lots of guide books to check out. We traveled by car and there was always a parking spot right outside her house. The cottage was quaint and surrounded by her gorgeous garden and plum tree that were delicious! There was a compost toilet (that I have to admit, took me a little while to get used to) and a shower inside since it was too cold for us to take an outdoor shower. I highly recommend staying with Joyce! A great location in Seattle to stay in! Thanks Joyce :) "
6606,2413979,2012-09-25,3559996,Todd,"Awesome, quiet and fun! We had such a great time here and love the quaint spot in a great area of town. Host was exceptionally kind, flexible with getting in (we were in town for a wedding) and generous. Super easy spot to get around Seattle and having a picnic set up, access to parks, awesome food and more. We love this area of Seattle and the home was perfect for a couple. Amenities were fantastic and I'd suggest this as a quiet getaway for anyone that wants to experience a neighborhood in Seattle - unlike the downtown mayhem or noise of a hotel. Having lived in Seattle for years, it was really great to see how she has her cottage set up - even if you've never been, you can get a great understanding of the city - her recommendations of activities, places to eat and more are spot on. I'd highly recommend this awesome cottage any time. THANK YOU, JOYCE!"
6606,4776520,2013-05-25,6203519,Emily,"Joyce's cottage is very cute and comfortable and in a beautiful garden. We enjoyed our time in the Wallingford area. We were close to transit stops that took us downtown, to Capitol Hill, Georgetown and finally to the airport. Irwin's is a great coffee shop just a few blocks away. And Paseo's is a Cuban sandwich shop we highly recommend, also in walking distance (they only take cash). Joyce's cottage was great way for us to engage the city more like locals than tourists. Plus Joyce was very kind and accommodating, I would recommend this space for a couple or an individual. Thanks!"
6606,6784989,2013-08-25,5008872,Beth,"I really appreciated the  privacy of the wee cottage.  An inventive renovation of the garage that was  great for  a smaller person like me but might be challenging for  larger people.

Joyce was gracious and accommodating.

It's also in a great location. Transit downtown  or over to the University and  an easy walk up to 45th for meals or groceries. 

We will be returning."

6606,7952218,2013-10-09,9069692,Ross,"Pretty good, though the access was a bit confusing. Great location, warm and comfortable.   "
6606,8094378,2013-10-15,8989897,Karla,Joyce was a great host and more than accommodating to our group. The welcoming wine and bread were a very special touch after our long drive. We appreciated the hospitality. Thank you for allowing us to use your home during our trip. - the Canadian Crew.
6606,8335306,2013-10-26,8615289,Jill,"Joyce's urban cottage is lovely! Quite small, but perfect for a week in Seattle on business. The bed is especially comfortable. Thanks, Joyce!"
6606,8565533,2013-11-05,1657945,Robert,Highly recommended. Joyce is very attentive but equally respectful of one's privacy. Her place is charming and in one of the most desirable locations in Seattle.
6606,8670727,2013-11-11,6262889,Esther,Thank you Joyce for the lovely place to stay. I was very warm and cozy. It was very convenient to my office located just off of Northlake. Thank you and I will make sure to book here again when I need to travel to the office again. 
6606,9556048,2014-01-02,550915,Aditya,"The place was wonderful and super convenient as we had a lot of family visiting for the holidays and needed a big house and kitchen to host everyone. This house was perfect and Joyce did a great job of decorating and making the house very festive. 

The beds are comfy, the water pressure is excellent. The location is right next to a grocery store and Molly Moon's ice cream (really awesome hot fudge). "
6606,14198624,2014-06-14,2897283,Shanna,"Joyce lives in my dream home, complete with this quirky little cottage out back. This is the perfect place to stay in the perfect uptown Seattle neighborhood, where no hotel options even exist (do not ever book The Wallingford Inn - sounds charming but is ill frequented). Nestled between Ballard and the U. District, Wallingford is well served by city bus within a few blocks and provides a quiet retreat within a quarter hour of downtown. I lived in this beautiful neighborhood for years and really, there is no place in Seattle I would rather be. Wallyhood has a walk score of 97. Great restaurants and beautiful Green Lake for strolling.

The cottage served my needs perfectly with a kitchen serviceable for storing and reheating food and making coffee, although there are so many great coffee shops within walking distance that you do yourself a diservice by making your own. Very comfortable bed and superior cable TV and internet. There is even a hot tub on the property that I wish I hadn't been too tired to take advantage of. I hope if the need arises, that I can stay here agin."
6606,15103705,2014-07-02,4969570,Tyler,"Joyce's little cottage was the perfect place for our trip. Comfy and cozy, close to transit and other amenities, it was great! "
6606,16020485,2014-07-20,3605722,Lauren,"This urban cottage was just as described - private, cozy and clean. Our favorite thing about it was the little garden area right outside our door where we spent the evenings after sightseeing all day. The neighborhood is lovely and we were surprised to find some really great restaurants and bars within walking distance. Joyce was a great host and even left us some warm scones outside our door one morning. Highly recommend this place! "
6606,17111733,2014-08-07,2237649,Beatrice,"The cottage was super cute and convenient to public transportation.  It was a great refuge after a busy day at a conference. Joyce left me a cold soda, which was awesome as it was a pretty hot day when I arrived.  She was a very friendly and responsive host."
6606,17698520,2014-08-16,18250896,Kathryn,The little cottage worked great for me while I was in Seattle for a week.  Nice and cozy! It has the most beautiful garden with chairs out front as well.  Really nice neighborhood. Joyce even put a beer in the fridge for me for when I arrived. :) 
6606,18012954,2014-08-20,14207237,Yukie,"Joyce's little cottage was very cute and cozy.  Having coffee, tea, water, etc. was very convenient, too.  Close to bus line, the town and shops, and a park.  I enjoyed a little table in the yard where I could sit out in the sun to eat and drink.  Perfect place to enjoy a summer in Seattle. I wish I could stayed longer!! "
6606,18325808,2014-08-25,8696146,Erin,I hard a wonderful stay at Joyce's cottage!  It's a perfect little home-base for exploring Seattle.  She's a very kind hostess.
6606,18494673,2014-08-27,8926142,Jo,"Joyce was very friendly and welcoming, as was her little pup! The cottage was adorable and comfortable, and the backyard was enchanting. I made a mistake with my reservation and even ended up having to leave earlier than expected and Joyce was willing to work with me. This is a great comfy place to crash after bouncing around Seattle. "
6606,20353581,2014-09-28,2510615,Christopher,"The cottage was cozy and comfortable and within a great section of Seattle with lots of shops, restaurants, big trees and nice houses.  Joyce was super accommodating.  Great experience."
6606,23990282,2014-12-16,8309687,Theodore,"Pictures are old, the place is starting to look a bit rundown. Mattress is stained. Host twice turned off water without notification to check her pipes for leaks - it's nice to be able to flush the toilet and wash your hands after using the bathroom in the morning."
6606,30429568,2015-04-21,1271973,Amy,"This was my second booking for the cottage with Joyce.  The first was an extended stay, the second a recent weekend.  The cottage is very comfortable and the garden is lovely on a sunny day.  The bed is extremely comfortable; the fridge is just big enough for everything you need for snacks and beverages for lounging in the garden or a picnic at Gas Works Park a short ways away.  There are a huge range of dining places in walking distance.  A relatively new one and a favorite for me is Bounty on 45th and Stone way--comfortable coffee shop ++ where you can get grilled sandwiches, coffee, beer (including growler fills!) and free movies and popcorn on Friday nights.

Contrary to what another previous guest suggested, I found the photos to be an excellent reflection of the space.  It was very clean, comfortable, and well appointed for everything I needed.  Joyce is great--helpful and extremely warm and friendly but not at all obtrusive.

Highly recommend the central location, this space, and Joyce as a terrific host if you are planning a trip to Seattle!"
6606,33718937,2015-05-31,31376147,April,"Joyce was out of town when we got there but  made sure everything was ready for us.   The place was cozy and beautiful.  The garden was certainly a highlight, we enjoyed eating outside, and hanging out in the hot tub. Awesome neighborhood!  When she got there she was super helpful, also her dog, Cleo, is awesome!


Some things to note before your stay.  Not necessarily cons, but things you may want to anticipate:

1) The internet wasn't great, but when Joyce rebooted it, it was much better.  But then the next day went back to being less than great.  Joyce also offered up her basement for us to use since it had better internet.

2) The toilet is straight up in the shower, and the shower is straight up in the kitchen, which was not to my liking really, but I get grossed out kind of easily.  It was plenty clean, it just weirded me out.  

3) It's quite small.  This was great for me and my sister since we grew up in a tiny room together, but I wouldn't want to be there with a romantic partner, especially not a smelly one."
6606,35797188,2015-06-22,16767993,Kurt,"We had a very nice stay in Joyce's quaint and cozy cottage. Very comfortable and great location, wonderful garden and easy street parking. Would highly recommend for a single or intimate couple. "
6606,36275527,2015-06-27,15737413,Chris,Joyce's spot is amazing!  I stayed there just under a week and it was perfect for me.  The spot is small but she makes that clear and for the price and location it's unbeatable!  Can't wait to book again
6606,36806825,2015-07-01,15980634,Meaghan,"Joyce wasn't at the cottage for our arrival, but her communication prior to our arrival was great.  She even greeted us one morning with delicious, piping hot scones!  The cottage itself was very charming and cozy--perfect for a couple or good friends.  A great place to come home to at the end of a day of exploring, and it was so conveniently located to a number of neighborhoods and also a short walk to the main drag of Wallingford and public transportation.  But if you're looking to cook to save a bit o' cash, I feel that the kitchen is serviceable for only very basic things (coffee, storing leftovers, etc.).  As noted in other reviews, the bathroom and kitchen are one space--didn't bother us too much, but some may not be everyone's cup of tea!  All in all, a cozy, conveniently located spot with a lovely garden in a great neighborhood.  Thanks Joyce!"
6606,37750582,2015-07-10,28968121,Swaati,"Joyce is a wonderful, kind, thoughtful and the warmest host I have met on AirBnB. She is very understanding and very accommodating. She gave us all the necessities and then some (yummy warm breakfast scones!). She was very responsive to our needs. "
6606,38386856,2015-07-15,7108244,Chhaya,"Joyce's cottage was great and a great deal. Very cute and perfect for a single person traveling alone or two people who don't mind the lack of door on the bathroom. As previous commenters have noted, the toilet is indeed inside the shower, and the whole bathroom sits inside the kitchen...but everything you need is there and works perfectly. The outdoor space is a really nice perk, too. 

The cottage is closer to Wallingford than Fremont but easily accessible to all the tourist sites by bus (schedules and bus stops are easily findable on the Google Maps app on your smartphone). The Burke-Gilman bike path is nearby and Green Lake is also beautiful and within walking distance. 

The kitchen isn't really made for cooking but is perfect for leftovers, picnics and morning coffee. The internet/wifi was spotty and intermittent - worked better to power the tv than it did my phone - but I also didn't bother to reach out to Joyce to ask her to reset the modem so it's possible it would've worked better if I had. AT&T got fine service though so it worked out fine for me. 

The photos in the listing are accurate or maybe even undersell the place, since it's a quite nice place to stay and is very charmingly put together given the space constraints. I'd happily stay there again. "
6606,39280788,2015-07-22,33503384,Sandra,"Joyce was awesome.  She was so friendly and hospitable.  Everything was clean and prepared for us. She had a plenty of Seattle information available for us to check out (magazines , maps etc.) .  The neighborhood is  residential and quite. But, it is a hop, skip , and a jump away from EVERYTHING; restaurants/bars, cafes,grocery store, drug store, shops! I left my art supplies at home. My fingers got restless for my sketch pad. All I had to do was get on a bus and ride for 5 minutes. It was so awesome I walked back to the cottage. I liken it to Wicker Park in Chicago.  

We did some touristy stuff and didn't have a car. We used Lyft and  from where we were located and depending on the time of day (traffic can be nuts) the rides cost  between $7-$25. The location is pretty central to even the touristy places "
6606,40100556,2015-07-28,34447060,Jesse,"Joyce was very pleasent and when I arrived. The cottage is cozy, fit for two. Beautiful backyard."
6606,41436706,2015-08-07,108658,Annie,"Charming cottage in a nice, walkable neighborhood."
6606,42264792,2015-08-12,34225879,Nancy,"This was our first time in Seattle and we loved being in proximity (walking distance) to the great restaurants and breweries in Ballard, Fremont & Wallingford. Downtown was a reasonable uber away. The studio was cute and comfy, thanks Joyce!"
6606,44325161,2015-08-25,39288092,Rachael,"Joyce's place was fantastic! The cottage was clean and slept two comfortably. Plus, you can't beat the location."
6606,47077952,2015-09-15,41894012,Matthew,Quaint and quiet little cottage in the heart of one of the nicest neighborhoods in Seattle. We were visiting for three days and couldn't have asked for a more homey feeling in our stay. Joyce has set up a place for guests that she would stay in herself and the personal touches were evident. The price was great as well. 
6606,47664724,2015-09-21,14608030,Tim,"The Urban Cottage was just as described and in photo's.   The bed was very comfortable, and all the needs for a short stay.   Parking was never a problem, and communication with Joyce was simple."
6606,49004413,2015-09-30,40308378,Susan,The neighborhood is beautiful and a perfect location for us. The photos and description were completely accurate and representative of the cottage space.  
6606,54613026,2015-11-22,46672070,Erin,"The cottage is an adorable little place, equipped with all of the essentials and even some toiletries in case you forgot your own.  Joyce is the sweetest hostess ‚Äì she even had champagne and snacks waiting for us upon arrival since we were celebrating our honeymoon.  The location was great, walking distance to some fun neighborhoods, and a short uber ride to downtown.  We were only there for two short days, but felt that we had a more local experience of living in Seattle in the little cottage!"
6606,55230464,2015-11-29,8136995,Kimberly,"The apartment was as expected. Clean, cozy. I appreciated that Joyce had left out biscotti, hot chocolate, pop corn... a very nice touch!"
6606,57630459,2015-12-28,11235013,Nate,"We had a great experience at Joyce's urban cottage. It's small, but very cozy and suited us and our dog well while we were visiting family for Christmas. Highly recommended!"
3424242,16124907,2014-07-22,13782970,Marcie,"This is a great place. The people were friendly and the house manager Matthew was pleasant and accommodating. He took initiative to move me into a room that happened to be empty that weekend instead of leaving me in the shared room, so I had a little more space  during my stay. The house itself is nice, comfortable, and clean, with awesome views of the water. It's in a nice neighborhood with some trendy bars and shops within walking distance. On Sundays there is also a street market on Freemont. Overall, a great stay!"
3424242,17112032,2014-08-07,6016552,Nestor,I stayed at the Cor36 hacker house for two weeks. The house has a very fast Internet connection and the only problem I had was figuring out the bus routes. The house captain (Aaron) was very helpful.
3424242,18911036,2014-09-02,12923810,Christopher,"This hacker's retreat was a joyful welcome to Seattle for the PAXPrime conference.  Its like a youth hostile, but less backpacks ;-). However, it is the simple and clean accommodations that make traveling economically nice. Its over looking the ""Gasworks"" park and the bay, backed by the skyline of Seattle, which makes the views spectacular from the dining room table and big porches.  The host was engaging and enjoyable.  As an older hippie, I like the simplicity, but very different than staying in the homes of other AirBnB hosts.  The rooms are high-capcity dorms with two bunks (four people) per room and I worry if its at peak capacity.  No lock boxes, but there is street parking and you can use your car trunk for your lock box.  Thanks for a very successful stay and enjoyed walks in the park and breakfast at the Essential Bakery up the street. There is a cool old Varsity Dinner also.  Thanks, Chris"
3424242,28238743,2015-03-20,7693924,Drew,"Love this house!  The location is magnificent, the house is awesome, and the people are great!  This trip was even better than the last--I had forgotten how comfortable the beds are.  Also of note, one of the 25 best new restaurants in America happens to be across the street.  No big deal. . ."
3424242,36383372,2015-06-28,31525327,Martin,"Stayed at cor36@LkUnion for 4 weeks. Overall, great location for a short-term stay near the UW district, at reasonable rates. 
People were friendly and the house captain Paul very helpful and accommodating. The house has room for up to about 15 people, so at peak capacity in summer it can get somewhat crowded at times."
3424242,43451863,2015-08-19,20096639,Daniel,I met some very interesting people here. I hope to come back here for an extended stay in the future.
3424242,45114697,2015-08-31,27586871,Tyson,"Stay here if you are looking for the chance to meet really smart engineers/entrepreneurs in Seattle. The location is really perfect for Seattle. Great views of the city from the upper levels. Buses nearby to get you downtown. Bikes on the lower level are free to use .. which is really perfect given the waterfront trail in front of the house which acts as a major artery between U of W and business campuses such as Google. During the day the house is very quiet.. most will be at work. At night you can socialize with other hackers or listen to one of the talks.  A lot of the guests are fairly long term (several months) so you can also get great advice on the city. The 4 person room lifestyle is not for everyone. Indeed, the house is in need of a few repairs which I believe are soon to be made.  But I wouldn't say that any of this made me uncomfortable. I really recommend this place for anyone working in tech new to the Seattle area."
193836,445094,2011-08-14,951435,Sara,"Our first experience with Airbnb was a great one.  My husband and I had two nights in Seattle, and needed a place with easy access to the city and the airport.  Amy's studio apartment was perfect for our needs.  The apartment is spacious with a fully equipped kitchen, very comfortable queen size bed and plenty of space.  It was spotlessly clean and nicely decorated.   We were able to park in the driveway and use a private entrance to come and go.  We left our rental car behind for a day of sight-seeing in the city, taking a bus that stopped half a block away.  Then for our early flight the next morning, it was just  15-20 minutes of easy driving to the airport.  Great coffee shop nearby!  "
193836,464132,2011-08-21,959287,Sandy,"Amy and Nathan are such a nice and caring couple. The suite is clean, neat and private. The house is located in a neighborhood with beautiful flowers, landscaping and ocean view. We walked to the grocery store down the hill. We walked a couple of hours a day around the neighborhood. We really enjoyed our stay. Thank you very much Amy and Nathan!"
193836,472937,2011-08-24,970931,Joseph,Exactly as promised! Spacious and clean. interesting (in a good way!) neighborhood. Would definitely stay there again. 
193836,515698,2011-09-09,942633,Barbara,"Amy and Nathan were fantastic hosts. They were friendly and welcoming. 
The basement studio apartment with a full kitchen was immaculate and perfect for my family‚Äôs needs.  We were given privacy with the knowledge that our hosts were always available if needed.  Great accommodations for small family who can share room with child or couple who want a base to explore Seattle area or hang out at the nearby beach or a single person just wanting a short stay apartment. I would not hesitate to stay with them again.  
"
193836,733528,2011-11-21,1260226,Elaine,Amy was gracious and helpful at all times. The studio is indeed quite spacious and well-kept. Excellent location for our needs.
193836,794556,2011-12-19,1496092,Shams,I really enjoyed my stay here. Amy provided an extremely comfortable and well-furnished apartment. The kitchen had all the basics for a short stay and the bathroom was well-tended. Amy and her husband made sure I had everything I needed and were very nice.
193836,964870,2012-03-02,206203,Amanda,"This is a lovely studio, open and spacious, clean, pretty quiet and with a very comfortable bed. Amy is a wonderful hostess and made everything simple and easy.  Good internet also."
193836,986197,2012-03-10,10983,Lynn,"Amy was a helpful host in providing us with a comfortable place to stay for the night. We had a great time exploring what West Seattle had to offer, and Amy's home was walkable to many wonderful places!"
193836,1063821,2012-03-31,1737320,Dan,"For the first time ever, we slept well in Seattle!  Great location, little to no street noise, and a great base to enjoy Seattle; particulary west Seattle with great restaurants, shops, Alki Beach and great access to everything else."
193836,1185399,2012-04-26,2085766,Claire,The neighborhood had breathtaking views! The bed & pillows were the most comfortable things I have ever slept on while away from home.  I had a great time!
193836,1194485,2012-04-28,1116853,Drew,"Very quiet and comfortable place... internet was fast, and bed was very cosy... I appreciate the off street parking, Amy even offered me a space in the garage!"
193836,1236784,2012-05-06,2258725,Rebecca,"The place is clean, quite and comfortable!  Amy was very nice and gracious as a host.  No problem finding the place or staying there.  Will come back again."
193836,1362348,2012-05-28,723907,Debbie,Amy and Nathan were very welcoming and helpful. Their studio is located in a great area and off street parking was included. Very close to many great places to eat and things to do.The studio itself was very clean and well presented. Would stay here again!
193836,1477403,2012-06-13,880553,Ashley,Our stay here was pleasent. The neighborhood was quiet yet just blocks from excitement. Everything we needed was provided for us. We even got some advice on where to grab some tasty breakfast. 
193836,1505407,2012-06-18,2317476,Ryan,"Great people, they let us use their back yard and their son's toys for our son, and when our babysitter backed out last minute they helped us find a new babysitter.  That alone is worth five stars, but it gets better.  The space was accurately described, clean, and comfortable.  In fact it is under sold.  They are very close to great restaurants and shops on California Street and right by an amazing park.  They let you park in the Garage, and finding parking in Seattle is not fun.  They have free WIFI and even have a laptop for you to use!  Our 2.5 year old son unfortunately woke them up one night, we feel horrible for it.  The somewhat poor sound separation from their unit to the rental isn't the best, however that is definitely more of an issue for them than the person renting the room.  We had a tough time with cell reception in the unit (ATT and T-Mobile had nothing, Verizon was limited but worked), nothing they can do about that!  And definitely not a reason to pass on renting the space.  When Seattle traffic wasn't being Seattle traffic it was only 15 minutes from downtown.  A great place to stay all around. "
193836,1542898,2012-06-23,2027949,Amour,"Amy was kind enough to let us check in a couple hours early since we were only in town for the day to tour a local company and didn't want to check in super late.  The space was clean, comfortable and quiet.  There was a great view from the front porch.  We were also able to find lots of great places to eat just a few miles down the street of California Ave.  "
193836,1604765,2012-07-01,2622685,Kathy,"We really enjoyed staying with Amy and Nathan. The apartment, which was clean and comfortable, was perfect for our needs. It was wonderful having a full kitchen to cook meals in since I have food allergies and find it difficult to eat out. 
Amy and Nathan also gave us several very helpful pointers on getting around the city and on what to see.  
Thank you for your kindness."
193836,1658960,2012-07-08,2719557,Jesse,Very nice place and we were very comfortable. The location was ideal for us because we prefer West Seattle.
193836,1719424,2012-07-16,551789,Briana,"The basement unit is very clean and comfortable.  I would not recommend this location if you are planning on spending a lot of time indoors (there is very little natural light in the space, as it is a basement), but for a quick stay in west Seattle, it is a perfect option.  Also, the hosts graciously provide not only WIFI but a laptop and printer for the use of their guests, a helpful amenity.  The hosts do have a baby, and you can hear the baby from downstairs.  This did not bother us at all as we were rarely home, but again, it is something to consider, especially if you are planning to spend a lot of time indoors. "
193836,1749366,2012-07-19,2082235,Corin,"This was our first Airbnb experience, and we were very happy with how it all went: Amy and Nathan were very helpful throughout. The apartment is exactly as described - it is a basement as stated and so there is not much daylight, but it is very comfortable, clean and spacious. We were there for 3 nights with our 2.5-year-old who slept very well on the sofa bed; the main bed was very comfortable too. The kitchen worked well for cooking meals etc., and it was not that far to the nearest supermarket (although the walk back is up a pretty steep hill!). The local area is a nice residential area with a number of amenities within walking distance; Lincoln Park is nearby and has a good children's play area really close to the entrance.
While the apartment is in West Seattle, the bus for the city centre stops right outside and takes about 30 minutes (a little more during rush hour) to take you right into the centre. It's a pretty interesting ride through the industrial area past the docks, and there were plenty of seats the two times we did it.
Overall, I'd recommend this place providing you are aware that it's a basement and that you will not be in the city centre."
193836,1760475,2012-07-21,2362458,Tony,"Amy was helpful and accommodating when our arrival schedule changed, and she allowed us to drop off our bags while she got the room ready. The area is nice with a lot of great restaurants nearby, and it was great to have a driveway and garage to park the car in."
193836,1853397,2012-07-31,2961222,Steve,"This is a very comfortable and cozy studio with a kitchen.  Seperate entrance - perfect if you want to come and go at any time.  Hosts are very accomodating.  Easy to get to downtown and to the airport. Tiny bit of noise from family upstairs, but quiet otherwise."
193836,2157427,2012-09-01,2363630,Mary,This is truly a spacious studio apartment. The location was great for me just a mile and a half from my daughter's home which is too small for me to stay. There are great views from the front porch and when walking the streets in the neighborhood. The access to down town Seattle is excellent so I was able to go to the Pike Place Market easily. The small kitchen is enough for 2 people. The apartment is very clean. The bathroom is a good size and very clean. Amy and her husband Nate are gracious hosts. I enjoyed my stay.
193836,2179011,2012-09-03,379934,Tiffany,"Amy was a fantastic host. Her home was precisely as described in the listing, and provided everything we needed for our stay in Seattle. Everything was incredibly organized, clean, and quiet. "
193836,2317772,2012-09-17,1130756,Bob,Great location with off street parking.  Private suite with all the amenities.  Very comfortable bed.  I would stay again with pleasure.
193836,2385748,2012-09-23,3463329,Shannon,"This was our first Airbnb experience and a great way to start out. Amy was very helpful in answering all our questions about places to go in the neighborhood; and talking about neighborhoods, this is a great location in West Seattle. It's on a main residential thoroughfare with a fair amount of car traffic, but once you close the door, you don't hear a thing. It's about two miles down the road from the vibrant town of West Seattle (be sure to leave yourself time to explore this area) and close to a couple of beaches with magnificent sunsets. The downtown bus stops about a block from Amy's door - and it's about a 40-minute ride into town. The studio is in the basement, so not much in the way of natural light, but a great space and plenty of room for two of us. We couldn't have wanted for more: well-equipped kitchen, good sized bathroom with a bathtub shower, excellent WiFi, garage parking, private entrance, and tomatoes fresh from Amy's garden! If you don't need a place in downtown Seattle, this is a great place to stay - I highly recommend!"
193836,2635951,2012-10-16,3147090,Kenton,"Thank you Amy and Nathan,
It was nice to be able to use the garage, particularly now that the rain has begun.  This is a pleasant, comfortable basement studio that is all to yourself in lower Seattle.  All amenities can be found in ‚Äòsmall-town‚Äô like suburb just a mile north.  I'd recommend it!
"
193836,2871492,2012-11-12,620558,Aurora,"Amy was extremely communicative and made the entire process quick and easy. The listing is clean, private, warm and has all the amenities you need. Plus, the bed is extremely comfortable! It's a bit far from downtown, so if you don't have a car, you'll have to take the bus. If you're in town visiting family and need a private place to stay, this is perfect. "
193836,3190505,2012-12-30,3872886,Andreina,"Our stay in Amy and Nathan's basement suite was very comfortable and relaxing. The suite was extremely clean and the soft carpet was perfect for my 8 month old daughter to crawl on.  They set up a pack n play and left toys for her to play, as well as plenty of brochures and magazines for us to find places to eat and visit throughout town. This led us to an AMAZING french bakery a few minutes from their house (Bakery Nouveau), as well as a wonderful kid's museum in Bellevue (KidQuest). Nathan was very quick to respond to our questions about the TV and wifi, which we used a lot and greatly appreciated.  Although not a huge disturbance, we could definitely hear the family upstairs, along with what seemed to be a little bit of construction during the day.  We'll definitely consider staying in the suite when we return to Seattle, especially if we visit with our daughter.  "
193836,4039480,2013-04-04,5511974,Qing,"Amy and her family are very hospitable hosts. Their place is very very nice. We slept well in the comfortable bed. My mom cooked in the kitchen. And the bathtub is very safe with a door and a seat. My 2-years-old daughter had a nice bath in it. We parked our car in her garage. Her place is only 20-minute-drive away from downtown. And the Lincoln Park is fantastic for kids, which is quite near her house. I will definitely recommend her place to stay. Thank you Amy!"
193836,4279071,2013-04-24,3852943,Josh,Enjoyed staying here Amy was a great host and really went out of her way to make my wife and I  comfortable. The room was nice and clean and the area was beautiful. Loved being close to downtown seattle and got to spend some time in west seattle.  I would Recommend her as a host! 
193836,4595403,2013-05-14,5534434,Charles,"Very nice stay at Amy's and Nathan's place. They were very helpful, answering any questions about the area and very accommodating. The stay in west Seattle was wonderful."
193836,5395348,2013-06-28,6017027,Kathy,"The Studio wasn't exactly what we expected.  IT was clean and cute and Amy and Nathan were very nice and helpful like the other reviews state.  The area was AMAZING!  Everything they say in the description is true, there were some things they left out that I wish I had known before I rented.  The tiny windows have no screens so you are air tight in a dim basement.  There were no fans until we requested. Nathan went right out and got one for us.  The door opens into a garage therefore there is no access to fresh air and light. The back yard access was after going through the garage and around the house to the gate in the back.  The patio had no chairs and is directly in front of the living room window of their home.  It would be a FANTASTIC view if there were a place to relax.  Our phones didn't work there, though we did get wifi.    The bed slept well and it was clean, just too stuffy and dark and we would not stay there again for that reason."
193836,5595918,2013-07-08,4783446,Julie,We stayed at Amy's for our Honeymoon. I have to say we loved it. It was so much nicer than being in a hotel. Heading out for fun from a home felt nicer than heading out from a hotel parking lot. My husband and I spent most of our time out and about but the time we were at the basement it was quiet and cozy. The only drawback was the shower. The lower shower head had amazing pressure while the upper shower head was at a trickle. Washing our hair was an adventure using the lower shower head but who is complaining? We were there for the adventure.
193836,5712021,2013-07-13,5613614,Hua,"Dear Amy
Hello. We choose from far away China to stay in your house, I was not attracted by the house comfortable degree, because you have kids. I want my daughter to play with your children, to enhance their language communication ability. I need your warm and friendly! I've come back to Beijing, my husband and daughter, hope to get your care! They will go to Mount Rainier Saturday, Sunday afternoon about 4 back to you, and you in advance! I wish 
a happy.
Sunny"
193836,5806147,2013-07-17,6120352,Elias,"Convenient, spacious , helpful hosts and great communications around the check in, check out logistics.would stay here again."
193836,5883173,2013-07-21,6120352,Elias,"Convenient, spacious , and comfortable! Would come back."
193836,6320907,2013-08-08,5613614,Hua,"We are a family from Beijing in china. The beautiful Seattle is like magic, we like the city very much. The city of romance, clean and friendly, let us feel very excited! The only disappointment and error is the choice of the house, not to feel the exotic friendly and warm. I will upload our living environment. We are far from the Chinese 12 hours of flying, so expensive accommodation costs are here, we are very angry and anger. There is also the owner of indifference and the children do not warm, let me regret to choose the living environment. Especially because of work reasons I have returned to Beijing, leaving my husband and daughter living in the basement, I feel very sad!"
193836,6360070,2013-08-09,7654975,Sean,Everything was very clean and comfortable and more than met our expectations.  Very friendly hosts.
193836,6483815,2013-08-14,6050919,Leslie,We were attending a wedding in West Seattle and the location of this studio was perfect. We love to hike and enjoyed walking to Lincoln Park every morning. It was a little claustrophobic being in a basement but the people we were visiting in West Seattle had a nice backyard with a firepit so it really didn't matter. Wonderful to hae a full kitchen with all the amenities. Thanks! Our family would stay again.
193836,6572384,2013-08-17,8015020,Billie,"Our overall stay here was good. Some PROS and CONS. 

Pros:
*Location - liked being in West Seattle, close to shops and amenities.  Being close to Lincoln Park was very nice also. We could walk down to the ocean view.  
*Cleanliness - the suite was nice and clean. A few stains on the carpet but nothing major. Bathroom was very clean also. 
*Comfortable - our bed was comfortable, it was nice to be in a basement suite rather a hotel room.
*Hosts - Amy was very friendly and helpful. 
*Netflix - that was nice for our children. 

Cons:
*Smell - the smell when you park in the driveway was of cat urine, not pleasant. We have a cat so we understand cat smell, but it was not a pleasant oder when you first arrive at your lodging.
*No key - there was no key to our door, we only had the opener to the big garage door. I did not like that at all.
*Fruit flies - fruit fly problem, I had to make my own trap they were so bad. Although I read it was the season for fruit flies so there may have been nothing they could have done to control that. 
*Closet - not a huge deal, as this is someones home that am staying in :) But there was a closet in the livingroom area that had a lock on it. It creeped me out.....lol. As it had shutters so it was really creepy knowing that something was behind there that I couldn't see.
*No phone - unlike a hotel there is no phone in your room. Which may pose a problem for some people, we didn't mind because we had our cellphones.

Other then those few things it was a pleasant stay. If they supplied a key in the future we would stay again. "
193836,7155215,2013-09-09,1196431,Mary,"My husband, 10lb dog, Emmy and I stayed at Nathan and Amy's airbnb in West Seattle for 3 weeks, our daughter from NewYork also joined us there for a week. It was great, a home away from home while we visited our other daughter and son in law and granddaughter in Seattle. We had everything we could need and more, comfy bed, washer and dryer access, full kitchen, and extras like the Wii with Netflix. We would definitely go back, great location, we really like West Seattle and enjoyed our stay immensely. Thanks Amy and Nathan."
193836,7358050,2013-09-16,8782866,Gregory,"Very comfortable room and Amy was very accommodating and easy to work with. We really appreciated being able to stay in West Seattle, close to where I grew up. Thanks for everything. "
193836,8065981,2013-10-14,9191864,Jayma,Amy was really sweet and helpful and the space was perfect for my hubby and me and our 6-week-old baby. She had a swing and rock-n-play for her to use also. Very clean and cozy place with most of the conveniences of home :)
193836,8650118,2013-11-10,9838329,Darryl,"We had a very nice stay here. The accommodations are exactly as they're pictured and our hosts made everything very easy. We were just passing through and spent a single night but there were plenty of amenities provided from a hair dryer to a coffee machine to a Wii. They were very helpful with recommendations for local restaurants and even set up an extra pull-out bed for our daughter. We didn't really now the area and it seemed a little more 'out of the action' than we might have hoped but that had more to do with our own unfamiliarity with Seattle. There is a fantastic nearby cafe called ""Bird on a Wire"" which really hits the spot too! "
193836,9381207,2013-12-25,8270311,Warren,"We had a great time.  Room was clean and comfortable.  Amy was accommodating when our flight was delayed and we had to check in late.  The only problem was the overhead shower.  There was low pressure, but the side handheld unit was fine.  Looking forward to our next stay in January."
193836,9533352,2014-01-01,1761630,Alex & Stacey,"We had a wonderful stay in this West Seattle spot! Everything was as shown in the photos, a very comfortable, homey space to snuggle into after a day of exploring. A nice kitchen if one wants to cook, excellent tech solutions, tv, smart phone docking station, kind and attentive hosts, a sweet coffee shop within walking distance. It feels very safe, secure, and the sounds of children upstairs was lovely and comforting. We recommend highly. "
193836,9826480,2014-01-13,8270311,Warren,We came back for a second stay and things were great.  Even the shower head was fixed and worked well.  Amy was again accommodating with our check in time. Would return again on our next trip to Seattle.
193836,10451956,2014-02-19,7640189,Dax,"Great little hideaway in a fantastic location.

Awesome airbnb'ers, they looked after my need very well and took care of my experience there brilliantly"
193836,13597897,2014-06-01,11494251,Annika,"My parents came to visit me for one week in Seattle - a long trip for them, all the way from Europe. At Amy's studio they had a really pleasant stay and were able to start each day well rested. They thought it was exceptionally clean and felt right at home. Nathan showed us the rooms and also answered occurring questions right away - though things also could have gone without explanation as they have everything you have to know explained on a papersheet pinned on the fridge. I can say that my parents really liked the atmosphere, the space and also the neighborhood, as they went for a walk a few times at Lincoln Park. We would definitely recommend this place and come back! Big thank you for contributing in such an accommodating way to our family reunion. "
193836,14090111,2014-06-11,15380499,Phillip,"The accommodations were clean, comfortable, quiet, and safe.  Better than we expected.  The neighborhood was safe and very convenient to all of West Seattle.  Amy did not have any problem accommodating our late arrival.  We look forward to staying again."
193836,14398849,2014-06-18,15305064,Dominic,My Fianc√©e and I had a great stay with Amy and her family in Seattle. Their house was in a perfect location and the apartment was everything we needed and more. Everything was ready for us when we arrived and all our needs we're accommodated during our stay. I would recommend staying with them to anyone! Five stars!
193836,14507838,2014-06-21,13681815,Chris,"Amy and her family were gracious and welcoming hosts. Her place has everything you need and is in a great neighborhood location. We walked to a local bus stop to catch a ride into downtown Seattle. We also walked to and spent some time in the beautiful Lincoln Park, with trails along the Puget Sound. (In addition, the off-street parking was especially nice, since we had a rental car.) 

Her studio is well-stocked with cooking utensils, coffee pot, stove, microwave, etc. It was great to be able to make coffee and cook a meal while we were there. Amy was also flexible with our arrival time and made sure that we had everything we needed. She set up the full-sized sofa bed, since we needed two beds. It was quite comfortable and I got a great night's sleep there. My friend also had a wonderful night's sleep on the memory foam mattress. 

I highly recommend this sweet spot for anyone looking for a friendly host and nice place to land while visiting the Seattle area!"
193836,14700531,2014-06-24,15964953,Peter,"The place was spacious, clean and comfortable, and the kitchen was filly furnished (even a frozen turkey in the freezer which we didn't touch!). The bathroom was especially nice with a walk-in tub and flex shower and seat at the end of the tub.
This area of town was nice and quiet. Amy's instructions were thorough and helpful."
193836,14794098,2014-06-26,16400927,Diana,"We really enjoyed our stay in West Seattle!  We loved the location near Alki Beach and the neighborhood feel.  The parking was an awesome perk and we found Amy's place to be an easy, relaxing stay.  Her studio has everything you could possibly need and some extras like netflix and wifi!  Definitely recommend it!  Just to be aware of - there is a little bit of noise in the morning so if you are not an early riser this might bother you."
193836,15227439,2014-07-05,9901960,Stephen,"Clean and conveniently located suite close to bus routes downtown. Everything we needed for a short site seeing visit in Seattle.  Courteous, attentive contacts from host.  "
193836,15628043,2014-07-13,15494702,Teresa,"Amy & Nathan are delightful. Kids are adorable.
The view from their upstairs deck is lovely. Off street parking is also a plus.
One caveat...if you have allergies, you may want to consider something other than a basement apartment."
193836,15806385,2014-07-15,17826893,Coby,Such a gracious host and awesome space in a great neighborhood. So grateful for their help & last minute willingness to accept my request when I really needed it.
193836,15940224,2014-07-18,18058956,Ling,We stayed at the studio for two days and enjoyed it. Nathan showed us the room and explained everything we needed to know. My toddler daughter immediately found and was occupied ever since with a full basket of toys and books prepared by the thoughtful host. The place is just 20 minutes downhill walk to the beach (across Lincoln Park). We went there for sunset. The beach view was fantastic! Definitely recommend it to everyone!  We accidentally broke the shampoo/bath-wash dispenser and offered to pay for the repair; Amy was so kind to tell us not to worry about it. We liked the convenience of the parking. There may be some noise from upstairs around 7 in the morning when the host's toddler gets up. But it didn't bother us to sleep through.
193836,16209047,2014-07-23,16335207,The-Hiep,"Amy's place is in a really quiet neighborhood, about 15 minute ride to/from downtown. The basement is clean & well organized, and the hosts are courteous. We had a good time. Recommended!"
193836,16451457,2014-07-28,12844038,Jessica,"Amy's place is great- spacious and very well supplied with everything you could possibly need: hairdryer, first aid kit, iron, small kitchen, tv, etc. The bed is very, very comfy and the sofa is a great place to take a load off after a day exploring Seattle. Amy has also provided countless guides and maps for Seattle with recommendations on what to do while you're there. We had a wonderful weekend and Amy made it very easy to access the property when we arrived. I recommend Amy's place highly."
193836,17143425,2014-08-08,340235,Kiri,"Amy's place was a perfect fit for our family of four (a 2 yr. old and newborn).  The basement apartment had all the amenities we needed to have a successful vacation including a pack n play for our newborn, a pull out sofa bed for our 2 year-old, a swing, an extra stroller (which was super helpful) and other baby gear (all available on request and included at no additional charge).  The West Seattle location was very convenient (we explored Seattle, Vancouver & Victoria). The apartment was clean, charming and exactly as shown. Our hope when we selected this apartment was ""family friendly affordable comfort"" and Amy's place fully met our needs and expectations! We would definitely stay here again!


"
193836,17254894,2014-08-09,14326974,Emily,"Amy's studio was the perfect reprieve after a long drive to Seattle. It was easy to find, clean and cozy and in a great location. The bed was really comfortable and it was really nice having a DVD player already hooked up so my five year old could watch a movie before bed. I had to leave early for my sister's wedding prep stuff so my boyfriend and son were responsible for packing up, Amy was awesome and let me know we left a few movies behind and bagged them in a spot that was easy for us to pick up with our crazy schedule. "
193836,17681918,2014-08-16,1846376,Chieko,"Amy and Nathan loaned us a stroller, booster seat, and put toys in the suite to make us feel welcome with our toddler. It was much appreciated. We found the location was convenient and enjoyed the nearby waterside parks. It was an easy drive into downtown Seattle. We would stay here again."
193836,18111473,2014-08-22,16149107,Syd,"This is a comfortable studio apartment in a quiet, safe, picturesque Seattle neighborhood. The hosts were friendly and welcoming, and invited my kids to play in the fenced backyard. The apartment was clean and spacious, and the fully equipped kitchen was nicely supplied with good quality dishes, utensils, and a coffeemaker. When I left behind my phone charger, Amy was nice enough to mail it to me.
My only complaint is minor: there was a strong perfume smell in the apartment. I happen to be sensitive to perfumes and odors, so it probably bothered me more than it would bother others."
193836,19399635,2014-09-11,8329481,Louise,"Amy and her husband were really welcoming and even offered us a sample of their home brew - which btw was apparently wonderful according to my fianc√©! The studio itself was far more comfortable than a hotel room, with everything we needed and more. The location is about a 15 min cab ride outside of the city, but a great way to experience a friendly Seattle suburb. "
193836,19490411,2014-09-13,12743983,Danielle,"Was a great place to stay in West Seattle.  Extremely convenient to all the awesomeness of the Junction and Lincoln Park.  We arrived very late from the airport (1am) and Amy very open to that with no hesitation!  The apartment was more than comfortable for our family of 4 (kids are 7 & 9).  Lots of details that make this feel more like a hotel than an apartment - fully stocked shampoo, soap, conditioner, a hair dryer, etc.  It is the basement so natural light is limited but the lights inside are very bright with lots of lamps if you like it not so bright.  The beds were very comfortable - even the pull out bed had an extra cushion on it so it was fine for sleeping.  "
193836,19701607,2014-09-16,20821022,Steve,It was a good place to stay and easy for my mother to get in and out with no stairs. Amy and her family were very nice.
193836,20516430,2014-09-30,21222591,Jeff,"Great place in West Seattle, Amy was great. Everything I needed was there, an effortless stay."
193836,20637619,2014-10-02,21333903,James,"Amy made a point of meeting in person and showing me the apartment and making me feel welcome. It is a sizable space in the basement/garage of the house with a full kitchen, just as shown in the pictures. Though you go through the garage door to enter the apartment there is nothing ""garage-y"" about the place once you are inside. 

The house is about 3/4 mile up a hill from a good selection of restaurants, fast food places, bars (including one of Seattle's top rated beer bars!), gas station, and full grocery store. A nice walk down to stimulate your appetite and thirst and then a nice walk back up to help it all settle. Unless of course it is raining, in which case the experience might be different. If you have limited mobility the hill is steep enough that you might have issues, but otherwise it's not too bad.

193836,27197645,2015-02-28,16056921,Megan,I had a great time during my stay in Seattle! The basement apartment was exactly as described and met all my needs! 
193836,29841373,2015-04-13,28836940,Sara,This is a perfect location in west Seattle! It was great for my first week in the city! The space is great and exactly what I needed!
193836,37835001,2015-07-11,28836940,Sara,Perfect for my long term stay in Seattle! Awesome location for people visiting the city! 
193836,38302961,2015-07-14,36006633,Alex,"Amy and Nathan were great hosts.  Amy was super accommodating on arrival times and her instructions were concise. Their space was very accommodating for young children (e.g. Pack n' Play, a tub in the bathroom for baths).  

She was also helpful in pointing out directions to a downtown attraction that was an easy short cut and helped avoid traffic.  

Overall, their rental space is great for travelers.  Comfy bed, space to move around, and all the amenities of a home.
"
193836,38471361,2015-07-15,2761324,Dmitry,"I would definitely recommend Amy's apartment, & would stay on my next visit in Seattle. Clean, comfortable & proximity to Alki Beach is a PLUS!"
193836,39015023,2015-07-20,33994828,Jessica,"They made us feel welcome by meeting us when we arrived, showing us around, and letting us taste their home brewed beer! Our stay was great and would like to stay here again next time we make it to Seattle. "
193836,39916301,2015-07-27,30985806,Elizabeth,"Amy welcomed us on arrival and did a wonderful job giving us all the information we needed for our stay.  Great we had a place to park our vehicle. Close proximity to transit was good. Bed was super comfortable, kitchen well stocked and suite was spacious. Will definitely check out Amy's listing next time we head back to Seattle"
193836,40617277,2015-08-01,36749027,Lea,"We arrived late and appreciated the accommodation to do so. The house was easy to find and the instructions to get to our space was simple. The apartment was spacious and clean. Our stay was short, but this space was very comfortable! Thanks!"
193836,41755813,2015-08-09,3310611,Suzy,"Short overnight stay, everything was as described. It was clean and very comfortable. The kitchen had everything you need to cook a meal. Nice little table to sit at. 
The set up of the room was well thought out. 
As another reviewer said a little noisy in the morning. The host lives upstairs and obviously has toddlers, hard to keep them quiet, no volume control!
"
193836,42041188,2015-08-10,30930545,Jeremiah,"I did not actually stay here because of a late change in my travel plans, but my communication with Amy was great throughout. I'm sure it would have been a good experience."
193836,42247996,2015-08-12,28561287,Frank,Wir hatten eine tolle Zeit bei Amy und Nathan in Seattle. Amy hat uns pers√∂nlich in Empfang genommen ist dabei sehr flexibel auf unsere gew√ºnschte Ankunftszeit eingegangen. Sie hat uns alles was wir wissen mussten gezeigt und auch einige Tips f√ºr unseren Aufenthalt in Seattle gegeben. Die Wohnung entsprach der Beschreibung in vollem Umfang und war sehr komplett ausgestattet. Abends durften wir noch  das von Nathan selbst gebraute Bier probieren und haben uns dabei angeregt unterhalten. West Seattle ist eine angenehme Umgebung. Man f√ºhlt sich fast schon wie in einer Kleinstadt und ist gleichzeitig in 30 Minuten mit dem Bus in Downtown. F√ºr uns war es ein rundum gelungener Aufenthalt.
193836,43487689,2015-08-20,34016716,Kathleen,"Amy and Nathan are great hosts!  They both greeted us when we checked in and showed us the place.   It was clean and cozy and had a nice kitchen with everything you need.  
We came to Seattle for a week with our two young kids, so we needed a place with a full kitchen so we didn't have to eat out 3 meals a day plus snacks and didn't want to spend a fortune. This fit the bill. 
Nathan is a brewer and had a few brews on tap along with a root beer which were all really good!   And 
We were out and about most every day and the location was great, easy to get to and from the downtown Seattle area without having to be in the midst of it all the time.  There's a dedicated parking space in the driveway with easy access to the house which was super convenient. 
I will say that I'm not used to basements and so wasn't prepared for the amount of noise coming from upstairs or for the complete lack of natural light and fresh air.  The noise from upstairs was just them walking around, we couldn't hear talking or anything, but the footsteps were very loud and woke me up a few times in the middle of the night.  There are windows, but they are blocked with bushes and you can't open them.  So it seemed stuffy.  We would leave the front door and garage door open and hope for a breeze.  
The entry to the space is through their garage which just felt a tiny bit awkward or weird, but wasn't a big deal, especially since it also meant walking past the kegerator with the beers on tap. 
We would definitely stay here again, but maybe not for an entire week.  "
193836,43935566,2015-08-23,12356837,Michelle,"This was a very comfortable place for my son and I to stay during our visit to Seattle. Both the bed and the couch bed were very comfortable! Also, it's in a great part of West Seattle -- residential but with easy access to both the Junction (business area that includes Easy Street Records and a great cupcake shop!) and the Sound. In fact, I took a cup of coffee to the corner (three houses away) and sat and looked at the water every morning we were there. 

Thanks, Amy! We'll be back!"
193836,44836331,2015-08-29,9770391,Monika,"Great place, nice hosts. Recomended stay. "
193836,45745808,2015-09-05,43010742,Aranda,"Amy was an excellent host and our room was great! Me and two friends slept comfortably in the beds provided. It was awesome being somewhere with a kitchen. There were pots and pans and basically all the kitchen supplies you'd need to cook! You enter this apartment through their garage, and they give you a personalized code to get in. It's a downstairs room, but it feels very separate from the house. All in all it was great and just what my friends and I needed for our weekend trip in Seattle. "
193836,45962133,2015-09-07,15879685,Sarah,"Amy and her husband were great and welcomed us to the place when we arrived. It was clean, spacious and comfortable. We really enjoyed having a little kitchen and sitting area   We chose this location because of its proximity to the ferry terminal in West Seattle and that worked out very well for us. The only drawback of this spot is not being able to sleep in because of the little ones upstairs being active in the morning. But that wasn't a surprise and didn't bother us! We had a wonderful visit and recommend this place to others. "
193836,46761031,2015-09-13,392983,Jason,"Amy and Nate were such great hosts. They were communicative, and we never had any complaints. They were flexible, provided A+ hospitality, and we wouldn't hesitate to book with them again. Thanks you two!"
193836,47579058,2015-09-20,22576469,Joshua And Renee,Amy and Nathan were excellent in coordinating and communicating. They made an effort to ensure they were there to welcome us on our stay. The location was great as we were in town for a XC race at Lincoln Park. It met our needs well for a quick stay and everything we needed to be race ready in the morning. Thanks!
193836,48892081,2015-09-29,41066411,Robert,"We were cordially welcomed and shown details on some of the features we needed to know about.  We did some cooking and easily found items needed to cook with.  The studio apartment was spacious and comfortable.  We had trouble getting Netflix on the TV, but Nathan quickly and easily resolved the problem.
We were familiar with West Seattle, but not having a car this time, we found public transportation very convenient from this location by bus and nearby water taxi.  Walking in the neighborhood was safe and gave us a wonderful view of Puget Sound.  We felt welcomed and included when we saw our hosts.  We would stay there again if the opportunity arises."
193836,55107354,2015-11-28,392983,Jason,We're repeat customers. Amy and Nate make my choice easy when having to find a place to host my parents. Reliable. Communicative. Flexible. Enough said.
193836,57294159,2015-12-24,47023717,Justin,Amy and Nathan were great!  Very respectful of our privacy and excellent hosts overall.  The apartment was perfect for our needs and they were so sweet to loan us their old pack n' play and high chair for our 1 year old.  Would definitely stay with them again. 
193836,57798378,2015-12-29,23063700,Alice,"Amy was very welcoming. The studio was cozy and clean. We didn't do any cooking, but the kitchen was ready to feed a family and a very fun grocery store is just a few blocks down the street. Our girls loved playing and hiking through Lincoln Park very close by. We enjoyed our easy bus rides into the city. It was the perfect place for us visiting family in West Seattle. Thank you!"
7620570,41178473,2015-08-04,25568237,Ellina,Such an amazing stay! House is lovely and Beatrice was very accommodating.  Really enjoyed the visit in her home- not enough positive words to describe the experience. Location is lovely with walking distance to the beach and restaurant shops. Very comfortable. Thank you again! Will definitely be staying with you next time !
7620570,42464122,2015-08-13,37239531,Rachel,"Beatrice was a wonderful host, and her home was accommodating, beautiful, above and beyond in every way. Great stay! "
935845,5186537,2013-06-17,6122315,Brian,"From May 22nd to June 19th, we stayed at Wendy‚Äôs residence as we worked our various internships around Seattle. During this time, Wendy amazed us by her hospitality and the amenities she provide to us during our stay. The electronic appliances were new to the point that many still had their operation manuals still attached. Additionally, the silverware and linens came wrapped in plastic still. Overall, the location has a microwave, oven, refrigerator, pots, pans, silverware, towels, bed sheets, 3 beds, a pullout bed / couch, large TV, wifi, 2 cupboards for clothes, cabinets for food, coffee machine, chairs, foldable table, shower, laundry machine, dryer, toilet, and even more things I probably have not had the time to use yet. As you can see form the exhaustive list, we had everything we could ever need for our stay and then some. In addition, the freshly painted walls provide a homely and cozy aura to the location. As for parking, it occasionally can get tight on 46th but more free parking is across the street so at worst you may have to walk 30 seconds. Finally, Wendy and her family are extremely cordial and have gone out of their way to help us several times (even warning us when one of the roommates car was about to be towed). Location-wise, it is about 10min in traffic to downtown Seattle, UW, and less to Ballard. Also, Fremont is known as one of the liveliest areas to live with the benefit of Paseo‚Äôs (the top rated restaurant in Seattle) being ~6 blocks away. Overall, I greatly enjoyed y time there and would recommend it to a family, friends, interns, etc‚Ä¶ who need a place to stay in Seattle. "
935845,5462729,2013-07-01,6591365,Caroline,"Awesome place! Clean, new, modern, and has everything you need. Really flexible check in and check out which is nice when you're traveling. Great experience!"
935845,5613212,2013-07-08,6718819,Sarah,"My friend and I had a great experience at Wendy's apartment. When we arrived, it was clean and exactly as pictured. Wendy was a great host and texted us regularly throughout our stay to address any questions or concerns we may have had. Overall, I would definitely recommend this Airbnb to anyone looking for a convenient place to stay in the Seattle area. "
935845,5769710,2013-07-15,5090262,Jen,"We enjoyed are brief stay in Wendy‚Äôs apartment. It‚Äôs in a great location‚Äîeasy walking distance to Freemont and a close drive to the Ballard neighborhood. The apartment was extremely clean, bright, and welcoming. 

Wendy was easy to reach prior to our visit, and scheduling with her was efficient and painless. 

When we arrived she gave us simple directions on how to get to a local market and several restaurants within walking distance of her home. We had a nice meal at Pecado Bueno just a few blocks away.  We will definitely plan to stay here again (if Wendy will have us!) on future trips to Seattle.
"
935845,6105417,2013-07-30,6200206,Stanherbert,"What can I say about this place? Wendy and her husband were such gracious hosts for the week my friend's and I were in Seattle. The place was as listed and even more than I imagined it would be. It was clean, modern, and the location was a huge plus. Being in Fremont, it was a ten minute drive to Seattle Center, and 15-20 minutes to Safeco & CenturyLink Fields. So we didn't have to drive far to get around. Wendy & Tim were easily available before our stay, as well as during our stay. Wendy provided us with coffee during our stay from her favorite local shop and her husband even took a look in the apartment during our stay, and even rewashed our towels for us. Also, with the kitchen & fridge, you have all the pots and pans you need as well as plates, cups and utensils you need to cook meals. The next time I'm heading into Seattle, this will be the first place I look to. Great people, great place and great city. Thumbs up! "
935845,6957076,2013-09-01,6747553,Todd,"I stayed at Wendy's for a month and had a great time! Wendy is warm, welcoming, generous with her suggestions and recommendations about things to do and places to go. She is also extremely respectful of your privacy. The space itself is clean, bright, and located in a very cute neighborhood, a very walkable area of Fremont, close to grocery, cafes, restaurants. Also a quick bus ride away to downtown Seattle or to UW campus. I really enjoyed my stay! Highly recommended!!"
935845,7693029,2013-09-30,3065304,Jessica,"I spent a month in September for work (and fun times too). Wendy was an awesome host and her space was just as advertised. We went out to eat a couple of times while I was there. I love that when I arrived she had brochures of nearby attractions in addition to printed lists of her favorite restaurants and things to do in the neighborhood.

The apartment is located right on the tip of the Fremont neighborhood, with short walks to great bars, restaurants and local shops. It's also an easy bus ride to the Ballard neighborhood and downtown Seattle too! I loved that I rarely needed to step in my car.

The apartment itself is clean, colorful, and very spacious! I enjoyed my stay and my explorations of sunny Seattle. Wendy is full of good advice and does some amazing work for a living. I'm excited for what she does next and highly recommend staying in her apartment."
935845,7986892,2013-10-11,4326435,Richard,Great location near the Fremont and Ballard districts. Apartment is the ground floor of Wendy's house and is very comfortable and clean. All appliances are new and in good working order. Bathroom and shower are great. Wendy is a lovely host - friendly and very helpful. Nothing was too much trouble and all the information we needed was available.
935845,8164638,2013-10-18,9433842,Rebecca,The reservation was canceled 31 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
935845,8448981,2013-10-31,9306339,Karen,"This place was terrific!  Wendy met us late because we had travel issues getting to Seattle and she worked with us when things changed.  The apartment was very clean, comfortable, and cheery.  It perfectly met our needs and was very conveniently located.  We will definitely stay here again.  "
935845,8704797,2013-11-12,8381826,Andrew,"Wonderful apartment, great host."
935845,8724611,2013-11-13,1523198,Pam,"The apartment was terrific, and in a terrific location. It had everything and was spacious. This would be a terrific place for a family because the one big bedroom has 3 beds (2 twins and a double -- or maybe that's a queen, not sure). It is also nice that you can come and go without bothering the owner. In fact, I never saw Wendy because we were out visiting family most of the time we were there. But it was easy to get the key from the lockbox, and there wasn't anything else we needed. If I had to say there was a problem, it would be in finding parking, but we managed fairly easily. When we first arrived at the house, I thought street noise would be a problem, but once you are in the apartment it is completely quiet. I would be happy to stay here again, and I highly recommend it to anyone needing a place to stay in Seattle!"
935845,8804505,2013-11-18,1685546,Richard,Wendy was wonderful.  The space was clean and comfortable and in a great area.  I HIGHLY recommend this spot.  I have given this place to all of my friends as a recommendation when traveling in Seattle. 
935845,8922676,2013-11-25,4185776,Sunny,This place was perfect! It was very clean and cute. It had everything we needed. Wendy was super nice and accommodating. I will definitely stay here again. 
935845,9001513,2013-12-01,496743,Seijen,"I booked the apartment for my parents coming into town for Thanksgiving. Wendy was awesome and the place perfect. 

The apartment is spacious, cheerful, and well equipped. (we actually hosted Thanksgiving dinner there because I didn't have an equipped apartment yet.) It was just my parents staying there, but easily 4-5 people could sleep there and not feel cramped. 

As a host, Wendy was fantastic. Ultra communicative and super friendly, she texted me to see if my parents needed anything from the grocery store and even invited us for dessert on Thanksgiving day. 

Thanks Wendy for everything!

935845,9832534,2014-01-13,10486106,Mandy,Wendy was a great host!  We would definitely stay here again!
935845,10054608,2014-01-27,3097100,Devin & Michelle,"Wendy's basement apartment was super cute. Clean, bright and a great use of space. The living and kitchen area is ample and the ""sleeping porch"" are was really great for a family. Would certainly recommend it if you are looking to be in the middle of the action in the north Seattle area."

il est tr√®s propre et on s'y sent bien. Wendy et son mari nous ont fait un tr√®s bon accueil. Par contre l'insonorisation avec l'√©tage du dessus n'est pas suffisante et nous esp√©rons ne pas les avoir trop d√©rang√©.

935845,10396973,2014-02-17,11759925,Michael,"The Seattle apartment was indeed located well for us, in a neighborhood just north of downtown.
Convenient location.
The apartment was neat, clean, bright, and plenty of room for us.
Thank you so much, Doug"
935845,10483167,2014-02-21,11849282,Bita,"The place is cozy, comfortable, nice and clean. Wonderful hosts and central location.
There is a bit of traffic noise and walking about noise from upstairs, but not excessive. Over all it's a great place to stay. "
935845,10683021,2014-03-03,5028592,Molly,"Wendy's place is great! It feels brand new, bright, and well appointed. Like true northwesterners, there's a place to separate your compost and recycling from garbage. :) You can hear a bit of traffic noise and footsteps from the house above, but it was quiet by around nine. We loved this spot and would definitely come back. Directions clear and communication easy."
935845,10741733,2014-03-05,893505,Joey,"Great place to crash with a few friends, dorm room style.  Easy check in and check out.  Gracious hosts and a clean apt.  Very happy with it all.  Thank you!"
935845,10889391,2014-03-11,5157265,Eric,"Four of us dorm roomed it at Wendy's place and had a great experience.  The place is fresh, clean and well appointed.  Especially appreciated the morning coffee, cleanliness and laundry set-up.  We were having so much fun in Seattle we didn't spend much time in our digs but all contact with the place and Wendy was excellent."

935845,11291208,2014-03-28,6704574,Ariel,"This apartment was warm and inviting and had everything our family of three (mom and dad and 2 year old) needed for a three day stay in Seattle. We really appreciated the washer and dryer, as well as the well-stocked kitchen. The location was great, and while there was some street noise (it's on a busy street) It wasn't all that noticeable.
"
935845,11583649,2014-04-08,1574009,Julie,"Perfect set-up for our family of four. There is one large dorm room style bedroom with sleeping for four, ample storage, plenty of room to stretch out and even a small desk. The common space has plenty of seating, a great kitchenette and a tv. The apartment is modern with brand new furnishings. Staying with Wendy is relaxed and comfortable while upholding high expectations for amenities and features. And you can't ask for a better location- within walking distance to central Fremont, Ballard, Green Lake, the zoo and Wallingford. We will be eager to stay with Wendy again!!!"
935845,11865258,2014-04-17,11884285,Kate,"We had a lovely week-long stay here with all the comforts of home, in an ideal location in a beautiful city. Wendy's apartment was exactly as advertised, if not better. She was friendly, accommodating, and very responsive. Our family of four slept well, cooked some of our meals, took the nearby buses to every corner of Seattle, shopped and ate and drank wonderful coffee in the neighborhood, and generally made ourselves at home. Thanks for making our vacation so terrific!"
935845,12137772,2014-04-23,662446,Andrea,"Great stay at Wendy and Tim's place.  My son and I found it very comfortable and convenient.  We went back and forth to UW and into Seattle downtown very easily from the apartment.  It was warm, clean, and had everything we needed to feel at home."
935845,12650462,2014-05-07,645860,Raewyn,"The basement of Wendy's house had all the basics we needed for a comfortable stay in Seattle. It was exactly as shown in the listing and was sufficient for our young family of four's needs. We appreciated the free parking, complimentary wi-fi and the odd access to Netflix. 

It was also in a cool neighbourhood with eclectic coffee shops, foodie outlets and boutiques. We enjoyed the food trucks at the Fremont Sunday Market.

We drove everywhere as we had two young kids and found that everywhere was a handy 10-15 mins drive away. In terms of attractions, the Woodland Zoo is within walking distance which was handy. 

Most importantly, Wendy is an awesome host. She was friendly and welcoming and was easily contactable. She was also able to do me a favour and collected a parcel I had missed a month prior to my arrival - how kind! Thank you so much! Thank you also for recommending me to your GP when my young son had a small accident. 

Really enjoyed our time at your abode. "
935845,13308318,2014-05-25,7843321,Shane,"My boyfriend and I spent a wonderful 2 weeks here in this lovely apartment.  It had everything needed with all mod cons in a nice area.  Free parking and wifi were extremely useful.  Wendy and Tim were very obliging, helpful and made us very welcome.  I would thoroughly recommend staying here and would definitely stay again."
935845,13512921,2014-05-29,14860397,Clint,Wendy's apartment was perfect!  It was very clean and had plenty of space for 3 exhausted travelers needing a place to get some shut-eye.  Wendy was very communicative and responsive to our questions.  I would definitely recommend her place to anyone!
935845,14076992,2014-06-11,12512335,Deanna,"The apartment was perfect. We had a group of four spend five days in this location. It is clean and equipped with anything one might need for a comfortable stay. Crisp sheets, towels, shampoo, conditioner, cooking utensils and silverware are all provided. It really was quite wonderful. There is also a washer and dryer, complete with whatever you would need to wash clothes.The hosts even had a list of things to do in the area, and a list of nearby shops/restaurants. The apartment is within walking distance of Fremont Street (about a seven minute walk). This street has cute restaurants, a coffee shop and a grocery store. I would definitley recommend staying here, and I would stay here again in a heartbeat : )"
935845,14376927,2014-06-17,16507103,Jawara,"Big thanks to Wendy and her husband for hosting my family! Their place was very comfortable and had everything you'd need in your home away from home. It easily accommodated as many as 5 of us and was clean. The place is conveniently located within minutes from UW, Seattle Center, and downtown among other sites and neighborhoods in the city. Parking was available right in front of the house or just across the street. They were very accommodating, allowing us to book on very short notice, offered flexible check-in, and were prompt to respond to questions we had. This was truly a great first time Airbnb experience. I highly recommend this place to anyone seeking a rental in this area!

Once again, thank you so much Wendy!"
935845,17667601,2014-08-16,9391656,Tracy,"My family of four was lucky enough to be able to spend two months in Wendy's Seattle apartment this summer, and we had a terrific experience. The location was perfect... my kids (ages 13 and 10) and I frequently walked to the zoo and the business centers of Wallingford, Fremont, and Ballard. We visited downtown, the Seattle Center, and the stadiums south of downtown via easy bus rides (no transfers) from a nearby stop. There is also a nearby bus line that runs between Ballard and the University District. Usually, parking our car next to the apartment was not an issue, and the few times we couldn't find a spot immediately next to the house, we parked on one of the nearby neighborhood streets. The house is located on a busy arterial street, so there is some road noise, but there are plenty of quieter, surrounding streets that are pleasant for walking. There's a lovely little park nearby with westward views overlooking Ballard and the Olympics, and be sure to try the Caribbean sandwiches a few blocks away!

The apartment itself was spotless and bright. We appreciated the fully functioning kitchen and the full-sized laundry machines. Wendy was accommodating, friendly, and accessible while at the same time respecting our privacy. I highly recommend her place for your visit to Seattle."
935845,18001799,2014-08-20,16386815,Danielle,"Wendy's apartment is lovely in a great neighborhood! Walking distance to the Woodland Zoo, flower gardens, and park.  It is so cute with bright colors and lots of light.   We loved it! The parking is a bit touchy... your best option is across (a somewhat busy) street, but as long as you are patient, it is not an issue.   The only other issue we had was with street noise but we did get used to it after the first night.  "
935845,18326258,2014-08-25,9874299,Kim,"My husband, 6-year-old daughter and I had a great time in Seattle and everything went very smoothly.  The apartment was a good size and very clean.  It's actually the cleanest Airbnb place we've stayed in so far (this is our 4th) and I believe it's because Wendy personally makes sure the place is clean.  Other Airbnb places rely on outside cleaning services and without direct owner oversight, it's never really that clean.  We had everything that we needed.  We debated whether we should've gotten a rental car before arriving, but the public transportation from the apartment was super easy.  The bus stops were less than two blocks away and they took us everywhere we needed to go in every direction.  Most places we went to didn't even require a transfer.  Getting to this apartment via public transportation from the airport was also super easy; it was just one light rail ride plus one bus ride.  The only minor downside was that the internet and Netflix connection was spotty at times.  Thank you Wendy!  "
4524575,23048803,2014-11-21,426399,Brian,Flora and Tom were very friendly and easy to work with. I liked that the place looked and felt very much like it did on line. It is an easy walk to area restaurants and grocery shopping. I was taking some maritime classes and it worked perfectly. The desk and work area provided everything I needed to get my work done and the kitchen was ready to go for home cooking.
4524575,23130351,2014-11-23,8189139,Debra,"This space was just perfect. Flora is a fabulous laid back host who pays attention to the little details.  The apartment is lovely space. Private with a lovely back patio and yard and an amazing view of Ballard and the fishing terminal. Newly remodeled with everything you might need to have a ""home"" away from home. The location is amazing. In Fremont and next to Ballard there are so many great places to visit and see. The restaurant selection alone is unbelievable.  10 mins from beach and a sunset dinner.  Thumbs up in all departments. I would definitely stay there again. "
4524575,23929724,2014-12-14,8847115,Rick,"We had a FANTASTIC stay at Flora & Tom's place. The unit was exactly as private as we hoped. While physically connected to the ""upper house"", it felt like a totally separate living unit with a great amount of space for the 2 of us. Frankly, had we had another person or two with us, it would still have been enough space. 
The full kitchen came in handy, as we wanted to have snacks on hand. We were also able to make use of the washer/dryer. 

Flora was a great hostess, leaving Seattle coffee grounds (and coffee machine) for us, as well as some delicious chocolate, a spot of organic milk, and a number of other personal touches. 

There was lots to do within a 5-10 minute walk from the house, however our pre-made plans had us in Seattle for much of the weekend. We chose to drive for some of them (nice dinner reservations and such), while taking public transportation for others (sightseeing, runs, etc). Both were easy. The house is a quick 10-15 minute drive to the Space Needle, and the bus took maybe 5-10 minutes more than that (and easy to use on the Seattle bus app - which gives you real time GPS status of when your bus will arrive)

How much did we like it? Well.... After the stay at the unit, I had 2 additional hotel days pre-booked for work while in Seattle. I cancelled that reservation and extended the stay with Flora. Way more bang for the buck than a hotel, and supremely comfortable. 

And the views from the yard of the river and beyond were spectacular. We'll be back! 

It was the first AirBnB experience for us. It's going to be hard for the  next one to measure up to this one!!!"
4524575,24018267,2014-12-16,8847115,Rick,Great hostess. This review was for the 2 day extension of the trip I've already reviewed. That trip was fantastic and the extension was fantastic. I would stay with Flora again in a heartbeat!

The apartment is super private, comfortable and with lots of extra things to offer( tea, coffee, extra pillows, blankets, etc)  Flora is an amazing , kind and easy going woman. She took a great care of us!  So far it was a most memorable stay. We will definitely stay there again!!!!"
4524575,25947630,2015-01-30,15121499,Kathryn,"Flora is such an incredible host! The listing is absolutely lovely. Every detail was attended to, the location is great (oh the view!!!) and walking distance to fun restaurants, bars, coffee shops and other services. I would absolutely stay here again. Flora is just really extraordinary! "
4524575,26033401,2015-02-01,951263,Alyson,"Flora thought of everything to make our stay as comfortable as possible. I had mentioned that it was my birthday when we booked the apartment and there were party hats, streamers, and flowers when we walked in. So so sweet! The place was maticulous and had everything you could possibly need for cooking, relaxing and whatnot. The view of Seattle is pretty epic from the front door as a bonus and the location was perfect.

We will definitely be back and would recommend Flora's apartment to anyone! "
4524575,28042536,2015-03-16,17977628,Emma,The spot was wonderful. Very clean and comfortable. The location was central with lots of fun things to do. I would go gladly go back. 
4524575,28233536,2015-03-20,11576096,Caroline,"Flora was very welcoming, accommodating, and helpful from the minute we drove up to her beautiful house.  The apartment was very private, clean and quiet, and looks just like the photos.  It was wonderful to wake up and drink Seattle coffee while viewing the snowy mountains.  We walked to food and shopping every day and only drove when we went downtown or to the Olympic National Park.  Good running trails around the zoo and Woodland park just a mile away and a great co-op for home cooking and picnic supplies.  Highly recommend staying here. "
4524575,28873551,2015-03-31,27054236,Claude,"This was our first experience with airbnb and a great success!
We stayed for 10 days and enjoyed this apartment as our true ""Home away from Home""! It was just as nice as the pictures are showing it and it was delightful to find fresh flowers, a kitchen well stocked with coffee, various teas and all condiments you may need to cook a few dinners home, soap for the washing machine and all kind of toiletries you may find at a 4 stars Hotel or at your best friend's guest suite.
Thank you, Flora, for welcoming us and our best wishes for your new life as Innkeeper! 
Claude & Otto"
4524575,29121356,2015-04-04,29186548,Leslie,"The space is big, private, and clean. We didn't take advantage of the kitchen, but for longer stays I imagine it would be a cost savings and more relaxing than going out for all meals. The backyard offers a relaxing place to rest and enjoy the view. Thanks, Flora!"
4524575,29656605,2015-04-11,25280294,Malinda,"We had a wonderful time staying at Flora's. The apartment is beautifully decorated, extremely well appointed & comfortable. Flora is a perfect hostess. She was attentive to our needs & communicative without being bothersome. We will definitely stay again if we are in Seattle!"
4524575,30043846,2015-04-16,15121499,Kathryn,Flora is wonderful! The apartment is simply the best and I would encourage anyone to stay here. Perfect location. Super comfortable. Everything you need for a short or long term stay!
4524575,30666027,2015-04-26,343322,Steven,"This is a lovely one bedroom apartment.  My parents came to town and stayed there a week.  They were perfectly comfortable.  Quiet street, pocket view of the water and Ballard Bridge, nice outdoor sitting area.  I plan on having them stay there again for their next visit."
4524575,31023826,2015-04-30,15121499,Kathryn,"Awesome! Always awesome staying here. Flora is an outstanding host. This trip, I was a bit under the weather. She brought me tea and emergen-C and even offered me dinner. The space is so lovely and comfortable - feels like home! Stay here if you can!"
4524575,32823306,2015-05-22,29101989,Kayla,"Flora is such a wonderful host! The pictures display the apartment to the tee. It is such a comfortable space and a quick walk to Fremont and Ballard. Easily accessible to a few bus lines to get to other areas of Seattle. The apartment was very clean upon my arrival, even with fresh flowers! Extra bed linens and towels were available. Would recommend to family and friends."
4524575,34702116,2015-06-11,29101989,Kayla,This was my second time staying with Flora and she was a great host just like the first time. I will be staying with her again this summer and I look forward to it! The apartment is identical to the pictures and is immaculately clean when I first checked in. Flora is very friendly and willing to accommodate guests. 
4524575,34947216,2015-06-14,7159409,Jeff,"Flora's apartment was wonderful! The apartment was cozy, well appointed, and really just a great place to stay for a weekend in Seattle. Flora's banana bread was a winner too

"
4524575,44905048,2015-08-30,21452621,Joseph,"Flora's apartment was the perfect place for me for a month stay in Seattle.  The location was in the heart of everything with easy access to both the University and Downtown.  The apartment itself was clean, spacious and well-appointed.  What's more, Flora was an incredibly warm and welcoming host.  I would highly recommend Flora's apartment to anyone looking for a great place to stay in Seattle for a weekend or a longer period of time.  I myself look forward to another visit."
4524575,45728531,2015-09-05,42609878,Annamaria,"This was the most amazing and relaxing week! Flora was a great host! Since the apartment has its own entrance, we only bumped into each other once by accident. But I'm so glad we did and had an opportunity to get to know each other! She always made sure I had everything I needed, which I did because this is one fully equipped apartment:) It was cozy and quiet with a great view. It felt like home! 
The house is in Fremont but Ballard downtown is just a couple minutes drive away. If you are from out of town, you should really check out both great neighborhoods - it's very easy if you choose to stay at Flora's . Going downtown is also quick with bus 5 if you don't want to deal with traffic.
All in all, I'm so happy I had the chance to stay at this island of serenity."
4524575,46421224,2015-09-10,35721840,Diane,"Our first airbnb experience could not have been better...much in thanks to fantastic hosts Flora and Tom. What a special piece of heaven on earth in Fremont, a prime location for experiencing all that Seattle has to offer. We enjoyed every exquisite detail of the living space from the fresh flowers, thoughtfully stocked kitchen essentials, and welcome gifts of chocolates and local brewery ale. What is most important though, is that Flora and Tom are genuinely kind people who will share in pleasant conversations with you yet respectfully let guests enjoy a very private visit. Their place is extremely conducive to many breakfasts/afternoon coffees uninterrupted; and are enjoyed while gazing at a pocket water view with beautiful garden surroundings. We are foodies, exercise enthusiasts, and always look for solid R&R during our holidays..we found all of that during our stay. Wonderful suggestions provided by our hosts. I encourage all visiting Seattle to live as they live! They are doing it right. :) "
4524575,46781836,2015-09-13,27068567,Beth,"just like home with that great neighbor, yet a true getaway from home - fresh and lovely, an incredible view. A great Seattle location for any length of stay."
4524575,50074389,2015-10-09,22110766,Nicole,"Flora and Tom's apartment was absolutely perfect.  Quiet, comfortable, spotless, cozy, nicely decorated, a lovely view, a garden, a well-stocked kitchen, and in a great neighborhood.  I stayed for a month while I was taking a training class in Seattle and couldn't have asked for a better experience.  Flora has thought of everything and is a superb host.  The apartment is very private, but she was usually available if I needed anything.  I would stay here again in a heartbeat!"
4524575,50749022,2015-10-14,10966990,Mary,"This Fremont apartment has everything you'll need for a comfy stay in Seattle.  First of all, the place was spotless.  I immediately thought that I needed to get home and paint my kitchen and clean my house!  ;) 
Flora left us fresh flowers in every room, a chocolate bar, coffee and orgainc 1/2 & 1/2.  Even 2 beers from Fremont brewing in the fridge!   There is a lovely, well-stocked kitchen with sharp knives, Brita pitcher, teapot, coffee maker and washer/ dryer + soap.  Spices in the cabinet and lots of counter space, which was so luxurious.  
Fast Wireless.  For real.
Cork floors which look great and make it warm and quiet in the apt.  
Patio with a view of the Ballard bridge. Lots of light throughout and a great shower!  Driveway parking made is so easy to come and go.
Walk to Fremont Peak Park for sunset.  Lighthouse coffee for a good cuppa.
Don't miss the Ballard locks and the Fishermen's Terminal.  The boats are big and the view can't be beat.  Quick drive over to Ray's in Ballard for a sunset drinkie at bar.

Thank you, Flora, for hosting us. 
"
4524575,51002584,2015-10-16,46429376,Nik,"A great place with a great host. The place was comfortable and clean, the location close to the exciting things of Fremont, and with a view of water and canal. The kitchen was well stocked with utensils and would be great for a longer stay.

Flora was an inviting and accommodating host. She worked with me when problems with my travel plans came up, coordinated arrival and made sure I had the keys and a tour of the place. She offered local chocolate and coffee and was incredibly friendly to boot.
"
4524575,51495173,2015-10-20,15518345,Yanina,Simply beautiful location and home! It was as advertised and even better (the snacks rocked.). The view was gorgeous and Flora was a wonderful and warm host. It was great meeting her!
4524575,54444391,2015-11-20,28474380,Steven,"I feel so grateful to have stayed at such an amazing place for my first month in Seattle. Before talking about the place though, let me just say that Flora is truly a wonderful soul, and one of the most genuinely caring, kind, and empathetic people I have had the pleasure of meeting. She was always giving me great ideas for things to do around town, cool places/projects to check out, and checking in on anything I needed with the place. 

The place itself is great, and is in one of the best parts in town. Quick walk to downtown fremont, which quickly became my favoritey part of Seattle, and a really cool, quiet neighborhood. The view out the backyard is absolutely beautiful, and the yard has a peaceful, artistic, and alive feel to it. The house itself has a really nice kitchen and living room that were very well designed, and with a good sized bedroom. 

I stayed for a full month, and next time I'm back in Seattle it will be the first place I check again for availability. Highly, highly recommended"
4524575,56189691,2015-12-10,34111659,Robert,"Flora was very welcoming and quick to respond to any queries I had. The apartment is clean, well decorated, and very well equipped.

The apartment is 10 minutes walk from shops, bars, restaurants and a good yoga studio (Yoga Tree).

I would stay here again!"
1246809,5202076,2013-06-17,3588779,Nicholas,Staying with Prez was one of the coolest experiences we ever had. He gave us the full experience from picking us up at the airport despite our last minute arrival and also hooking us up with the best suite in town! Definitely a recommend for any of you traveling to Seattle.
1246809,5268258,2013-06-21,1945213,Dylan And Angela,"This apartment was great. We stayed there with our puppy, and he enjoyed the little yard and walking around the (very hilly) neighborhood. The location was also great. Though it is not directly in downtown, the light rail station is about 10 minutes away by foot, and it is a 15 minute ride downtown. 

Keith (AKA Prez) checked in with us every couple of days to be sure that we were doing alright. "
1246809,5327301,2013-06-24,6833379,Eric,"I had a very pleasant stay at Keith and Cherie's apartment.  The thing I like about airbnb so much is avoiding that touristy hotel vibe.  I like staying in real neighborhoods, so I understand the city from a resident's point of view.  The balcony at Keith and Cherie's place is huge, and the view of the mountains and surrounding greenery were very nice.  It is a plus to be able to do a load of laundry before departure, as well.  Very clean apartment with large shower.  Thank you!"
1246809,5662114,2013-07-10,6761178,Maribel,"Prez & Cherie are absolutely amazing host! They were very welcoming and helpful, especially to somebody like me who just moved to Seattle. The apartment is very nice and quite. Super comfortable and close to the city. It was a great place to stay while I went apartment hunting in Seattle. I 100% recommend them!!"
1246809,5699759,2013-07-12,5476460,Ashley,"Very comfortable, quiet one bedroom apartment. Prez and Cherie were very helpful, friendly and accommodating. I would absolutely recommend this place to others!"
1246809,5856607,2013-07-19,185997,Jacqueline,Prez and Cherie's place was exactly as pictured and described and we had a great stay. Prez is extremely helpful and responsive and the place was clean and ready for us on short notice. The porch is a great place to sit on a summer evening and the keyless entry gives you one less thing to worry about. Really nice to have a washer/dryer too right in the unit. We were happy we found this place - we had our baby with us and having everything we needed all set right away made traveling a lot easier for us!
1246809,6030565,2013-07-27,6774679,Eddie,"The unit we rented just what we were looking for and well prepared for guests. The unit is very spacious and so it would be fantastic value for a group of three or four.

It is also very convenient if you are coming to/from the airport and are reliant on public transport.

While everything ran smoothly, Prez and Cherie made it clear that they would be available at any time to assist with our request.

The only downside was the post booking 'further information' request. It was a bit tedious given that Airbnb covers almost all bases, especially reattaching pictures we already had on airbnb. It kind of felt like applying for my Chinese visa again i.e. ticking a lot of no brainer boxes."
1246809,6084073,2013-07-29,7301290,Kate,"Some friends and I used this space for home base during a laid back bachelorette weekend, and it was ideal. Super quick cab ride to Capitol Hill, five minute walk to the light rail station for an easy trip downtown. You won't find premium movie channels or deluxe bedding, but the simple yet comfortable unit was the perfect, affordable, easy location we were looking for. MUCH cheaper than anything comparable at a hotel. Cherie was very quick to respond when we had a few issues with the key code and needed some extra linens. All in all, we were very satisfied with our experience. Would not hesitate to recommend this unit or the other units they have available."
1246809,6141012,2013-07-31,1742320,Aaron And Gillian,"Great communication and the place was amazing  and newly updated (or maybe it was always this nice).
Parking wasn't an issue as there was a spot right in front reserved. 
The only issue was some random occurrence with the freezer at an odd hour of the night, but they were very quick with a response to fix it that day (an easy fix was to unplug the freezer so it was a non-issue essentially). That issue isn't something that I would attribute to them, it more represents the care they take with responding to guests in the face of random occurrences. 
The place is near light rail and an easy walk down to QFC/starbucks if you need a quick bite. 


"
1246809,6167634,2013-08-01,7777953,Kaitlin,"We had a great time at Prez and Cherie's place! The one bedroom unit was very clean and in a great location. Although I never met our hosts, they were very quick to respond to any questions through the phone. We also were allowed to have our pup at the place which was awesome. 
Overall, we had a great time and would recommend their place in a heart beat. "
1246809,6185208,2013-08-02,5061271,Nora,"Although we didn't meet our host, it was so easy coordinating our arrival with Cherie through text since she was so responsive. The 1br apartment is big and well stocked (excellently stocked kitchen with utensils, plates, cheese graters, the works and extra blankets etc.) with a large, clean, new bathroom. Plenty of street parking around. It was spotless and the bed very comfortable. My only complaint (which is not the host's fault) was that the renters who had the attached house had dogs that wouldn't stop barking and you can sometimes hear them through the adjoining (locked) door. Overall, very comfy stay!"
1246809,6466038,2013-08-13,7450825,Marc,Prez and Cherie were very accommodating and very nice! They made sure everything was taken care of for us. It was a very nice and pleasant experience!
1246809,6760781,2013-08-24,7680701,Barbara,"Our first time using Air BNB and Prez & Cherie made it so easy.  They gave us their number so we could call or text if we needed anything.
The home was clean and comfy.  I'd stay here again.  We loved sitting on the balcony in the morning drinking our coffee and using the wifi to make plans to sightsee.
The only odd thing about the place is that there isn't a table or chairs.  No problem - we had breakfast in bed!"
1246809,6904319,2013-08-29,8236695,Nicolas,"Very clean and close to downtown 
Highly recommended 
Thanks "
1246809,6921479,2013-08-30,8047790,Darryl,"I thoroughly enjoyed the Presidential treatment I got during my stay; Town Car service from the airport, and a chauffeured tour of several nightlife venues... Like having the key to the city!

Prez & Cherie follow through on the mantra that communication is key-- I couldn't ask for more attentive and responsive hosts. And the cleaning service also does a thorough job. This has been a uniquely delightful experience."
1246809,6987383,2013-09-02,7507505,Herman,Great hosts and very great/clean place!  They were very kind and checked up on us to make sure we have everything we need.  Thanks for everything!
1246809,7096100,2013-09-06,3778045,Yvonne,My parents loved it! Prez made sure we were able to get in and stopped by to say hello. He checked in regularly and even organized a breakfast table within a day. My parents felt very welcome and taken care off. We would definitely book the apartment again if we have guests visiting us in Seattle. Prez and Cherie are great hosts! 
1246809,8061296,2013-10-14,2312710,Laurie,"We had a nice stay at Prez & Cherie's.  They were easy to get a hold of, had a clean place and easy to get to."
1246809,8162781,2013-10-18,5135895,Florent,"Basic place close to downtown, clean and quiet. The host are very available at any time and helpful. Thanks again."
1246809,8243521,2013-10-21,4008739,Greg,"great location, prez and cherie are wonderful helpful hosts that go the extra step to make you feel comfortable in their space."
1246809,10704634,2014-03-03,12169274,Chris,"As a Pacific Northwest native, I've been to Seattle several times throughout my life, but it wasn't until my week long stay with Prez and Cherie that I really had a chance to get to know this wonderful city in-depth.

After landing at SeaTac, I took a quick train to Beacon Hill where Prez picked me up and gave me a quick tour of the neighborhood to make sure I felt oriented.  His place is just a 10 minute walk away from two different train stations, which makes for convenient access to downtown Seattle and the airport.

The accommodations themselves are exactly as shown in the photos: modern, clean and comfortable -- especially the bedroom and bathroom.  I was in town to get some writing done on a book, and the apartment was the perfect haven to relax and reflect, fixing meals in the fully-appointed kitchen, working from the comfort of the couch, admiring the view from the spacious porch, or unwinding with some HD cable TV.  There's even a dishwasher, washer and dryer, which makes the place perfect for a longer stay.

While the purpose of my trip was for creative work, you can't work all the time, which is why I was so grateful for the friendly community of guests that Prez has established at his multi-room unit just across the street.  During my stay, I met fellow travelers from across the world, sharing Seattle recommendations and tips.  Even better: as the owner of a transportation and entertainment company, Prez knows the city like the back of his hand and is always available to provide guidance or recommendations, whether it's a place to grab coffee, or suggestions to great nightlife.  If you don't feel up for taking the train, he is usually available to give you a lift in one of his cars or -- in one of the highlights of my trip -- on a party bus.

Ultimately, as Prez will tell you: Communication is KEY.  If you're just looking for a relaxing place to stay in a great part of Seattle, he'll get you set up and let you enjoy your trip.  At the same time, if you need anything at all, Prez is always just a phone call or a text-message away.

I'm grateful to Prez and Cherie for re-introducing me to one of America's truly great cities.  I'll be back soon -- and I'll be staying with them again, that's for sure."
1246809,11367030,2014-03-31,12478289,Rose,I had a great stay here. It was spacious and very clean. The only problem I had was the dog next door constantly barked every night. But other than that I would probably come back again. Prez was very pleasant and checked on me frequently through text. 
1246809,13166748,2014-05-20,14590034,Pierre,"The place was clean and just the way it was described on the listing. Even though the apartment is part of a bigger house I never really noticed the people in the other part of the house. Location is conveniently located near the airport and a lot of ethnic restaurants.  Prez and cherie were great host, checking on us several times to make sure we had everything we needed. I also found the keyless entry to be very convenient"
1246809,14453645,2014-06-19,16707578,Darell,"Was not happy with the place.  Dog kept barking, had to wait for a code for 30 mins as the owners did not send this prior to my check in time. The numbers I called went straight to VM.  I was so upset, left next night and didn't even refund me the night.  Would not stay here again."
1246809,14551619,2014-06-22,13284742,Cassandra,"Prez was very friendly, he picked up my mom from the airport and let her have an early check in as she flew in early. The place was clean and pleasant. The price was reasonable. The neighborhood was quiet. I picked this place because it was handicap accessible, for my mom; and she appreciated the shower. 

However, I had asked about the wheelchair lift in the initial inquiry, as my mom has a hard time with stairs. We never used it, because the key could not be found. While my mom was able to navigate the stairs, it was a source of stress and one I thought I had taken steps to prevent. 

I would stay with Prez again, he was friendly and responded to texted concerns quickly, but I was very disappointed at the lack of the amenity that I booked for. "
1246809,15323118,2014-07-07,14386828,Keat Yee,We love the location of the place! It's very strategic and near to downtown. The apartment is clean and comfort and have a spacious bathroom. We have a nice stay there. The host is very friendly too!
1246809,15506504,2014-07-10,236495,Mike,Prez was awesome and was very quick to respond to all my questions. The apartment has everything you could need and there's a grocery store walking distance. Everything was clean and spacious. Couldn't have asked for more. Thanks again Prez!
1246809,15686459,2014-07-14,13978454,Sandra,The apartment itself was clean n comfortable. The exterior n garden however could be better maintained.  
1246809,15877642,2014-07-17,14008894,Colby,"Clean, well kept apartment in the Beacon Hill area of Seattle. About a 10-15 minute stop to the light rail which takes you to the airport and downtown Seattle. Very easy to navigate the city without a car from this locale. The unit was very welcoming especially after long travel days. Would definitely stay here again."
1246809,16065729,2014-07-21,15241320,David,This AirB&B for a few nights was perfect!. It was centrally located to our event (Wedding) at Jefferson Park and a very short drive to Downtown Seattle (maybe 5 miles). The train station (a very brisk walk up the hill) about 5 blocks was close enough for us.  Everything was in good working order and everything you needed was a available. Definitely recommend this unit to anyone. The hosts were only a txt away and very accommodating. 
1246809,16545783,2014-07-29,14570073,Stephanie,"The house was spacious enough for me and my 3 friends. We had a wonderful stay and felt welcomed. We were out  during the day most of the time exploring Seattle. The location was close to the light rail which was our main transportation. We didn't mind walking, but for those who don't have a car it can be trek. The bed was very comfortable and extra sheets & towels were provided! "
1246809,16713745,2014-08-01,501945,Alvin,My family and I stayed at Prez & Cherie's place in Summer 2014. The place was the same as it is on the picts. Quite neighborhood. My parents slept in the bedroom (the bed was comfy). Me and my brother slept on the sofa bed. The bathroom was spacious. We didn't meet Prez and Cherie but it was easy communicating by text or call. 
1246809,16847632,2014-08-03,15058189,Oscar,"An itinerary was provided via email/Airbnb messaging before we arrived at the listing and provided very thorough instructions, as well as addressing FAQS and concerns one may have about the stay. I would say the listing description was pretty accurate. The suite was clean and tidy when we arrived. The location itself was not too far from popular destinations, and there was easy access to the main road. The neighborhood was quiet in my opinion, no obnoxious loud noises from my 2-night stay. Prez was very accommodating during my stay and is a very good host.  "
1246809,17015511,2014-08-05,18657235,John,"Prez was really nice and responded quickly to phone calls and texts. He let us check in early and stopped by to say hi and make sure everything was going well. I couldn't have asked for more from a host - excellent experience. Absolutely no issues with check-in or check-out. 

Pros - the house location provides quick access to downtown Seattle and the lake. We rented in the middle of the summer and were really happy to have AC (many houses in Seattle don't have this). The inside of the house was nice. The pictures don't show this, but there's also a couch in the living room. It was fun to be able to watch some of the Seafair airshow from the balcony.

Cons - the exterior of the house and balcony was a bit dirty with lots of spiders. There's also a door that separates your room from the neighbor's and you can hear everything (talking, dishes clanging in the sink when we're sleeping). 

That said, we had a great time!"
1246809,17349206,2014-08-11,16442764,Dee,"Although I never met Prez or Cherie during the visit, they were very responsive via email and texting before the visit & stopped by when we were out sightseeing.  We made a small grocery request beforehand, they were very gracious to get everything on the list and have it ready in the apartment after arrival.  Overall, the apartment was described accurately, with the highlights being the fully stocked kitchen and a great bathroom.  We liked how it was a private apartment, although you can hear everything in the adjacent house (alarm clocks, dogs, arguing, etc.).  The exterior can be a bit more welcoming and although parking was available, we had an SUV and it was a bit difficult to park.   A table & chairs would have been nice for the meals, but we just ate it on the porch sofa!"
1246809,17581258,2014-08-14,17683421,David,"The overall experience with Prez was great and exactly what we needed in the midst of a long west coast trip! The house was comfortable, clean and as expected! The house was quiet enough to get some much needed rest, yet close to downtown and the light rail which made getting around the city a breeze! "
1246809,18192207,2014-08-23,19139997,Laura,"We had four people, two on the bed, two on the pull-out. There was enough room for a cozy stay. The place was clean and well kept-up. The oven, stove, fridge, etc. are all in great shape; we used them almost every day to make breakfast and dinner, which saved lots of money! It is a moderately-short, hilly walk to the train, which you can ride anywhere, as many times as you want for $5/day. The streets were around the are were not kept up very well and some of the houses has junk around that made the neighborhood seem a bit sketchy, but we walked back to the apartment late at night a couple of times, and we had no indication that the neighborhood was unsafe. 
Prez and Cherie were great at responding quickly, and they are super friendly! They live close by and even invited us over to their place when they had people over one night. Overall, we really enjoyed the stay!"
1246809,18482840,2014-08-27,13047499,Edna,"Right off the bat, Prez was a great host. Although we didn't have that much interaction, he was available when needed.

Upon arrival, we were pleasantly able to check in earlier and drop off our stuff so we could explore the city. He welcomed us on the porch and gave us a quick tour of the place. 

The place itself is a comfy, cozy place. The 1 bed in the room was super comfortable and the air mattress and pull-out sofa bed all fit in the living room. For my group of 5 it worked out fine. Bathroom was big, nice and clean. Kitchen was also convenient to have. The best part is the AC--which I heard was rare in Seattle. It was a lifesaver during our hot weekend there (85 degrees in Seattle, say what?). TV in the living room and the bedroom was also nice to have and kept us entertained during our idle time.

Location was really perfect--basically 15 mins to where ever you needed to go! The neighborhood is adorable and quiet. 

Check out process was so easy. Just pack up, leave the towels in the hamper, wash your dishes, and go! 

Overall, I'd definitely stay here again. Nice host, great location, cute and clean place with a comfy bed--why not! "
1246809,18789473,2014-09-01,4997904,Andrew,"A group of 6 of us stayed at Prez and Cherie's for the Penny Arcade Expo convention.

We got settled in with very little problem. The house is clean and tidy, and the place is air conditioned which is very nice for the hot weather. The porch is nicely lit do you don't stumble at night (when you sit porch outside, you can hear crickets! don't worry, doesn't travel inside). Our group ran into some problems but Prez and Cherie were patient as I tried to rectify any problems that arose. Though the rules were too strict for a couple of people in our group, understand that you are a guest in someone's home and you have to be mindful of their property--Sorry about the makeup on the towels.

All in all, my stay at Prez and Cherie's was good, and special thanks to Janaye for welcoming and showing us around the house."
1246809,19260885,2014-09-09,13151307,Kathrin,"Die Wohnung ist sehr gut ausgestattet und wir hatten alle Kochutensilien, die wir ben√∂tigten. Das Bad ist sehr sch√∂n und ger√§umig. Gleich in der N√§he ist ein Supermarkt. Der Parkplatz direkt vor dem Haus war super. In die Innenstadt sind es mit dem Auto nur ein paar Minuten. In der Nacht ist es recht laut, man h√∂rt den Stra√üenverkehr und alle 10 Minuten fliegt ein Flugzeug √ºber das Haus. F√ºr ein paar Tage ist die Wohnung zu empfehlen. "
1246809,19485732,2014-09-13,20414425,Jason,"Although I did not meet Prez, he did text to see how I was doing at his place the next day.  I wasn't able to reach him a few days before arriving to get the details, so I did have to call him to get access and set up to the place.  The place is nice and spacious, especially since we had 4 adults and a baby. "
1246809,20453209,2014-09-29,6707408,Lara,"We had a great stay during our 5 nights! It was nice to be able to cook and relax. It's in a quiet area that's really close to get to inner-Seattle by car or train. Some places are walking distance as well. If you have a larger group, be prepared to be in tight corners and the 1 bathroom. Prez was super friendly, helpful and stopped by a couple times to say hey which was nice. The shower is great and it was nice to do some laundry with ease. I recommend this spot!"
1246809,21316924,2014-10-14,22130705,Jim,"Deadly Location, Deadly People, 100% Happy! Will stay again"
1246809,25978131,2015-01-31,26581408,Troy,"Prez and Cherie provided all the information I needed to make our check-in easy.  The accommodations were just as described.  From this location, it is an easy 10 minute walk to the Beacon Hill Link station, so getting around town is simple.  10 minutes will also get you to some great local restaurants and coffee shops."
1246809,28280230,2015-03-21,4564811,Ashley,"Prez & Cherie were great hosts! The room wasn't our favorite, but for the price it was good!"
1246809,28731615,2015-03-29,19572124,Patricia,Prez was very accommodating to our check-in time and was helpful when we needed him! He was really friendly and chill - thanks for making our stay enjoyable!
1246809,29757413,2015-04-12,18113524,Christy,"Prez & Cherie's mother-in-law suite was perfect for me. Prez was very welcoming and super helpful. The apartment was as described, nicely equipped with all of the kitchen and bath items you would need, clean and comfortable. I loved the shower! The washer and dryer was super handy. This would be perfect for a handicapped guest because they had an elevator and everything was handicapped accessible. The location is primo too! Being so close to I-5, major roads and 2 Link stations made getting around a snap. I was traveling alone and felt safe there. I definitely recommend staying here."
1246809,31004456,2015-04-30,29125824,Janna,This place was great.  Prez was great. Would recommend this rental!
1246809,32665191,2015-05-19,423074,Maite,"We left our booking to the last minute. Luckily we got offered to stay at this beautiful, self contained home. Much better than staying in a small hotel room. Prez was very prompt with his replies and very patient in answering my queries. Definitely recommend this place."
1246809,33120928,2015-05-25,7120999,Valerie,Hosts were super welcoming & helpful in suggesting local places to check out. They have a layout of pamphlets in the living room that are fun to browse through too. Neighborhood was ideal-- central location and close to everything!
1246809,34946886,2015-06-14,25967269,Nathan,"It has a good location, close to the city center and airport. And you will find everything you need when you live."
1246809,35318895,2015-06-17,2059054,Vena,Prez was very kind when my plans changed last minute.
1246809,35797228,2015-06-22,14712608,Kaitlin,"We had a great stay in Prez and Cherie's MIL suite! There was a minor hiccup with communication at the start, but once we got that worked out everything went fine. 
The space was perfectly located for what we needed and the best part was the washer and dryer in unit!"
1246809,37197419,2015-07-05,412105,Benjamin,"Prez & Cherie were great hosts! We had last minute plans and didn't stay for our last night, but Prez & Cherie graciously offered a partial refund. The place was clean and tidy, and we were only a 10-minute drive to downtown. Would highly recommend to stay here if you're in Seattle."
1246809,37999829,2015-07-12,32587225,Herrie,"Prez was welcoming and accommodating. He was a nice host.
The room itself is spacious and having good facilities. 
The location of Prez needs six stops from Beacon Hill station to Westlake downtown station. And it takes 10 minutes walk up to the hill from Prez place to the station - which is a very good exercise to your heart!"
1246809,38734153,2015-07-18,35415075,Mandy,The owner was great.  We loved the location!  The unit had all of the amenities we needed.
1246809,40087492,2015-07-28,32026335,Sabrina,Carpet could use a cleaning but overall good for the price. Convenient location - very close to downtown.  Very spacious and clean bathroom.  
1246809,42502173,2015-08-13,15700015,Paula,"Clean place and easy access, all that we needed, very accommodating with short notice. Thank you"
1246809,42752364,2015-08-15,33617901,Janell,"Thank you really enjoyed the space, so much better than a hotel room. Bed was really comfy. The directions from downtown on the light rail was easy to follow. We recommend this place to anyone."
1246809,43856851,2015-08-22,25568710,Ky,"The house is clean and well equipped, near the bus station and light rail station, very convenience. Prez is an easygoing host and he picked me up at the first day from the light rail station. Recommend ;)"
1246809,45264753,2015-09-01,37517314,Larissa V,"Prez was a warm and gracious host, and checked in several times through the stay to make sure we were enjoying ourselves. The suite was comfortable and clean, and well located for our purposes. I wouldn't hesitate to stay with the host again."
1246809,47947962,2015-09-21,33134898,Roxana,The fact that we were able to check in late at night was amazing. Everything was great the price the location they're room definitely a great first airbnb experience. 
1246809,51251269,2015-10-18,46525048,Charleigh.Pearson,"I had a wonderful stay in this place, very close to downtown and very private. The hostess are very relaxed and caring. Loved it here and will definitely be back! "
1246809,56280090,2015-12-11,49136419,Mike,"This place was amazing. I was looking for a place close to work and there place was open. And wow did I score. It's really homey and was super clean. It's had all the things to make my stay fantastic. A full size kitchen with all the cookware I needed. 
The bathroom was large and also extra clean. 
I really enjoyed the front porch were I could read at night and just decompress after a long work day. 
The best part was the hosts are extra nice and accommodating with my stay. I for sure would stay here again! I recommend anyone who's staying in Seattle to give this place a shot!"
2818292,15292888,2014-07-06,17238794,Viktoria,Nerissa's home was just the perfect place to stay!everything worked out perfectly and it was super clean! We would definitely recommend this air bnb who looked for a relaxed and super nice stay in Seattle!!!!
2818292,16122681,2014-07-22,17131603,Alissa,This was such a pleasant surprise! Our first airbnb experience and we were blown away! Nerissa's attention to detail was impeccable. Her brother lives in the basement and was super nice the one time we saw him as he was barely around. This was an amazing place and would recommend to all my friends and even my mom! (which is saying a lot)
2818292,17941709,2014-08-19,17412560,Greg,Nerissa and Eric are great hosts in this pleasant and quiet home that is very close to the sights of West Seattle.  We enjoyed our stay and found everything in order and accessible.  We couldn't have asked for a better experience.  Besides the indoor space there is a great outdoor area we took advantage of to enjoy the great Seattle summer.  Our family lives in the area and we won't hesitate to contact Nerissa again.  Thank you!
2818292,18816819,2014-09-01,19064736,Annapurna,"Awesome stay! It was my first time using AirBnb and Nerissa was a great first experience. Very close to downtown, we had no problem going in for the day and coming back to a nice quiet neighborhood was relaxing after a long day out. Being so close to Alki beach was definitely one of the best parts, watching the sunset over the water with the Space Needle in view was spectacular. We'll definitely be back! "
2818292,33201370,2015-05-25,32875457,Olivia,Thank you so much for hosting us! We had a great time in Seattle and Nerissa's home was prefect for exploring the city. The area was quiet and the house and room were beautiful. Nerissa was very communicative and although we did not meet her she made sure we had all the information we needed for a smooth stay.
2818292,38208129,2015-07-13,35643869,Cathy,"I enjoyed stating at Eric's home. He and his girlfriend Linda live in the basement and the entire first floor was available to me.  They were friendly and welcoming and gave me space the times I was there.  It was a quiet and safe neighborhood within walking distance of restaurants and Alki beach.
"
2818292,38557536,2015-07-16,37850048,Megan,"This house is so neat, clean, updated and stylish. Our stay was so comfortable.  I loved the en suite bathroom.  Eric was kind enough to offer drinks and any use of the upstairs that we needed as well.  You'll still need a car to get to downtown (about a 20 minute drive) but we loved everything about our stay at this place."
2818292,38929324,2015-07-19,38031575,Sakeus,"The description and listing was totally accurate, and the neighborhood seemed nice enough to leave our mountain bikes (locked) on the back of our car--nicer than our home neighborhood. Even though Eric was gone for the night, he left refreshments on the dining room table and a note giving the whole rundown. "
2818292,39433132,2015-07-23,38021055,Mark,"The house was in a nice quiet neighborhood in West Seattle very close to Alki beach. Lots of street parking. The house is very nice and clean. The room was very comfortable with a large television with HBO movies on demand (I chose the free ones of course!). The private bathroom looks newly renovated and very clean!  Our hosts Eric and his girlfriend are the nicest people and really made us feel welcomed. They offered us cold drinks and chocolate chip cookies right out of the oven, yum!  Thank you Eric and Linda! 
"
2818292,40135581,2015-07-28,37622439,Lindsay,"This was my first experience using airbnb and it was great. Eric and Linda set the bar very high. The description was very accurate. The house is adorable and very clean. I felt completely safe in the neighborhood. Having my own bathroom was a nice perk. This was better than any hotel I've stayed in. I am moving to Seattle from the Midwest, so I came in town to apartment hunt in West Seattle, so staying in this location was perfect.

Eric and Linda were very welcoming. They checked in with me in the evening to make sure everything was okay, offered me advice on where to look for an apartment, and even invited me to join them and their friends for a home cooked meal. I couldn't have asked for a better experience! "
2818292,40651564,2015-08-01,38683819,Rachel,Very nice..well appointed house in a quiet neighborhood. Everything was just as stated in Eric's listing. Ez to find and ez to access. All in all a good experience!
2818292,41484693,2015-08-07,14799909,Jamie,"When we arrived to Eric's home it seemed like half the neighborhood was outside for a block party. Everyone was kind and welcoming, and it was a great way to end the day having traveled all the way from Florida. Their home was beautiful and Linda gave awesome directions and advice to make the most out of our stay. I loved everything about West Seattle, but especially watching the sunset at Alki Beach band eating breakfast at Easy Street Cafe/ Music Store."
2818292,42295147,2015-08-12,14935640,Ginessa,I had a wonderful stay in west Seattle. The room was nice and very comfortable plus the attached shower was amazing. Linda was super helpful with recommendations of places to eat and things to see. The location is very convenient and the neighborhood is very cute and fairly quiet. I really enjoyed my stay and will definitely come back. Thank you!
2818292,43273658,2015-08-18,3036696,Daniel,"Great sleep! Great shower! Great location! Close to shops, cafes, and a farmers' market. Comfortable stay."
2818292,45114170,2015-08-31,38876389,Kathleen,"As this was our first ever Airbnb experience, my husband and I are encouraged to do more booking this way. Linda and Eric were excellent hosts! Linda offered if we needed anything at the grocery when she was going she would get it for us. My husband asked for OJ and she happily provided it for him. 
Bathroom was clean and felt new. Bed was comfortable and we are fussy on that item. Public bus transportation was in walking distance. The quiet neighbor felt safe. On street parking was readily available.
Excellent competitive pricing. Would book this room again!
"
2818292,46294704,2015-09-09,40330384,Bo,"Eric and Linda were very friendly and accommodating. Accurate pictures, very quiet residential part of town. About a 13 minute walk to the Junction, where there are express buses that take you to downtown Seattle. "
1733747,8996278,2013-12-01,1058448,Claudia,"Mandy is very lovely and carrys about her guest.  It¬¥s a brandnew house and during I lived there, it went more and more cozy. It¬¥s quiet and the light rail is very near. For people without car it¬¥s easy to ride into downtown. The room is bright and a lot of wood is in the room! That¬¥s creates a good atmosphere.

I really can recomment Many¬¥s house to stay, I enjoed staying for one month! She is a great host! And there is a very good tasting coffee and some sorts of tea, which I could drink!

Thank you Many!"
1733747,9957943,2014-01-21,2400554,Nick,"Mandy was a warm and welcoming host and her house was a reflection of her impeccable taste. It is a brand new, green built home with the latest appliances and it is absolutely adorable, as well as very cozy... There's a lot of interesting places to eat and a great bakery in Columbia City to try within walking distance. Neighborhood is safe and quiet. Plus the light rail is only 10 mins away, can't go wrong here, especially if you don't have a car.  "
1733747,10244157,2014-02-09,7117893,Brittany,"My stay with Mandy was perfect, exactly what I needed. I had a busy week while I was in Seattle, so I was leaving early and coming late, but each experience was positive. Knowing that I had a good place to stay made my busy week so much less stressful. I actually wish I had been able to spend more hours relaxing there during my stay.
Mandy is a welcoming host and very helpful. The space is clean, safe, and orderly. I appreciated that the space was cozy yet simple and elegant. There was good closet, desk, and storage space.  I walked everywhere during my stay - the light rail is close and its a pleasant walk. 
I don't have a single negative comment!"
1733747,13027580,2014-05-18,1724220,Lynne,Mandy was a great host and her home has a lovely feel about it. Our room was spacious and airy and the bed really comfortable. We enjoyed our stay very much and would recommend her as a host to anyone. Lynne and Stephen 
1733747,15350054,2014-07-07,16822594,Adam,Great host. Relaxing house. Mandy is wealth of knowledge about the area and was helpful in planning our day trips.
1733747,16330142,2014-07-25,12054317,Madeleine,Mandy was a great host. She gave me great recommendations of things to do in Seattle. Her home is very clean and comfortable. I love the neighborhood and it was easy to get to and from the public transport system. 
1733747,16572252,2014-07-29,860091,Jupiter,"Mandy is a total sweetheart and I will stay with her again next time I visit Washington. She is very helpful and warm first time seattle visitors. Her home is beautiful, relaxing, and very clean. On top of everything the located of her home is perfect, right next to public tranist and some cute eats and bars. I was very impressed. "
1733747,16721198,2014-08-01,16782081,Joy,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Mandy's beautiful, sustainably built home. The home is beautiful, and sits across the street from a nice park, with a bonus view of Mt. Rainier. Mandy was really nice and very accommodating. We had access to the kitchen and took advantage of the light rail station only several blocks away. The futon bed we slept in was comfortable, and overall it was a very nice experience. We have been considering building a green home ourselves, so we enjoyed learning more about Mandy's home and left with a lot of great ideas for our future project (we've already started shopping for an alcohol fireplace)."
1733747,16998138,2014-08-05,3691407,Kelly,"I had a wonderful time staying in Mandy's home for a long summer weekend.   Mandy was very good at communicating the process to me before I arrived. I knew exactly how to get from the airport to the light rail to her front door- all without the need of a car!  The neighborhood was super interesting, diverse, and verdant, with the Columbia City downtown a short pleasant walk away (although I may have gained 5 lbs eating chocolate croissants at the Columbia City Bakery, which is nobody's fault but my own). 
Mandy herself was very friendly and gracious. Her home is a wonder to behold. You will never see more beautiful pine wood floors in your entire life, I'm sure of it.  I felt comfortable, relaxed, and welcomed.  I couldn't recommend this Columbia City jewel of a place highly enough!  "
1733747,17301831,2014-08-10,14662750,Chong,"Mandy's house really a comfortable place to live. It's very close to the light rail, which to easily takes you to the downtown, to the pike market. And I do like the pears and strawberries in the garden. The room for me is quite big and warm. And Wendy, is such a nice host. And I like the Capital Hill that Mandy recommended to me."
1733747,17635104,2014-08-15,5453848,Meriem,"The place was very nice, clean, and modern.  Neighborhood was on the urban side but the downtown Beacon Hill center was lovely. (15 min walk on google maps) I would have appreciated if I knew before booking the room that someone else would be on the same floor. Sharing and cleaning up after other guests was really inconvenient regarding the bathroom situation. The room was sweltering hot first night and the window was closed-made no difference the entire stay since hardly any wind circulates through the room we were in. Also, neighbors were very disruptive, when addressed to Mandy she told us to let her know to call security. So thats a tip for the next guests if you experience the same noise issue. All in all I liked the place. :) "
1733747,17865308,2014-08-18,161149,Sarah,"My boyfriend Chris and I spent 3 nights at Mandy's house. Mandy was friendly and a timely communicator. The house itself is clean, the room well set up and it was great having a bathroom right next door. We enjoyed meeting and conversing with Mandy's housemate, who was really friendly too. Regarding location, the house is accessible by tram and bus, with a bit of walking in between. "
1733747,17989128,2014-08-19,17693578,Sarah,"Mandy's home is beautiful and she was such a fantastic host!   The house is brand new, gorgeous and immaculately clean.  Our private room was way nicer than any hotel room we would have otherwise stayed in- you're definitely getting a great deal by staying here!  The location was perfect for us- we stayed here our last night in seattle so that we could explore the city on our last day and come back on our way to the airport.  The light rail is a short walk and we took it both to go downtown and to the airport.  
Throughout the booking process Mandy was extremely responsive and answered all my questions.  She was also very generous and flexible and allowed us to pick up our bags a  little after our check out since we had a late flight .  She is very friendly and easy to talk with.  I would highly recommend staying here!"
1733747,18141451,2014-08-22,5349405,Mustapha,"The house is in a nice upcoming area of Seattle. I felt very welcomed by the host. Had everything that I needed, the kitchen downstairs to cook, if I wanted to. All was great staying there. Thanks again."
1733747,18637527,2014-08-29,15821254,Hazel & John,"Our visit was short but sweet. Mandy greeted us at the door with friendly smiles. Her space was very nice, and although the room was different from  what I saw of her photos it's was still a pleasant room. I slept like a baby. Her home was a short walk to the light rail- soooo convenient for us as we wanted to make use of public transit to the city center. Her roommate was also very friendly. All in all a wonderful stay and one I recommend :)"
1733747,18807701,2014-09-01,7445139,Clara,"Amazing house, well communicated, clean and comfortable. On top of that, Mandy is a wonderful host who makes the experience of Seattle even better!"
1733747,18965631,2014-09-03,16999814,Sherry,Mandy provided a very flexible check -in time so I could arrive early at her house. It was a very beautiful and well decorated house. I really love her kitchen which is super clean and well organized. The room has a great view of the park outside and the bed was really comfortable.  I enjoyed my two nights here and highly recommend Mandy's room. 
1733747,19297594,2014-09-09,20781300,Gretchen,"My visit to Seattle and my airbnb experience were firsts for me. Airbnb was definitely the best way for a single person like me to get a really good feel for the area.  Mandy's place is excellent and I found it to be exactly as she advertised it and more. Two blocks from the light line for a direct trip into downtown. Also not a difficult drive.  The neighborhood is multicultural and not far from Washington lake, the Columbia movie theater, great coffee shops and a wonderful  vegan restaurant, all of which I walked to. Mandy gave me great tips on where to hike and places to see in and around the city. She was a gracious host who made me feel very comfortable in her lovely home, made me  ginger tea and even played a game of scrabble one night.  I thoroughly enjoyed my experience.  A little tricky learning the alarm system, but I caught on."
1733747,19497581,2014-09-13,10421870,Tommy,"I had a very good time staying in Mandy's house. Mandy was very welcoming and gave me ton of tips for traveling in Seattle. The house is very pretty and clean, Mandy has great taste on all the decoration! Can't wait to stay there again!"
1733747,20390385,2014-09-28,21504355,Sarah And Russ,"I loved staying at Mandy's home.  It is a lovely place, incredibly clean, and very comfortable.  The home is in a great location, just a four minute walk to a delicious restaurant and a 12 minute walk to Columbia City, which is delightfully quaint, yet vibrant and full of cafes and shops.  I highly recommend this location.  Plus!  Mandy is a welcoming and kind host with a dynamic personality.  I would definitely stay here again."
1733747,20526811,2014-09-30,21408584,David,This was my first time to try an airbnb.  I enjoyed it much better than a hotel. Mandy was very accommodating regarding check-in and checkout times.  I had minor hand surgery and was able to rest in my room till 4pm before I caught my flight home. I would stay here again.
1733747,21185274,2014-10-12,12964688,Matthew,"Mandy welcomed me upon arriving and quickly went over the basics before I headed out for the evening on the first night. The house was a clean and quiet space to return to after a couple busy days/nights in the city. The room was comfortable and Mandy made a point to make sure if I needed anything to let her know. If I need a place in the city again, I wouldn't hesitate to contact Mandy again if she'll have me.  "
1733747,21927399,2014-10-26,20445988,Abby,"Mandy is the best host ever!  I only met her briefly as I was leaving as she was away the weekend I was there, but she totally went out of her way to make sure my stay in Seattle was comfortable.  She provided towels.  Her house was literally the cleanest house I have ever been in.    It is beautifully decorated.  I felt like I was on a calming yoga retreat.  It was great!  Mandy's place is a very convenient walk to the light rail, which made it great to get to both the airport and downtown.  Definitely stay here!"
1733747,22143768,2014-10-31,17388508,Miseon,"Amazing. Just amazing. Everything provided was more than what I expected and I just felt like my own home. 
Every spot in the house is just impeccably clean and there is also a half bathroom on the 1st floor which was great for quick check my look before I go out. 
Mandy and the other floormate were so very kind showing me how to handle things in the house.  There are many kinds of tea and coffee for good start of the day. Kitchen is on the 1st floor, which was great because you can go down there for a quick cup of tea or water in the middle of the night or whenever you feel like without bothering anyone.
The bed was really really comfortable and warm, which was great for chilly weather in SEA. Many sockets for your electronic devices to be charged and super fast Wifi. 
Most importantly, there are LINK light rail in 5-10min walking distance that directly carries you to downtown. LINK was always my choice for moving around, but there is a bus near the house which also goes to downtown. I used that when I went to Space needle.
There is a Safeway in 15-20min walking distance. You can find Tacobell and pizza place there, too. If you walk across the LINK track about 15 min, there is a street lining with restaurants and shops. And I found a good one named Geraldine's counter. They offer great menus for brunch. (Emerald scrambled egg was great!)
Neighborhood is also great. Quiet and friendly. View from the window of your room was perfect. During my stay I enjoyed watching children in the neighbor going to school, birds flying, sometimes squirrel running up the tree. 
About the alarm system, it was a bit difficult for me to understand how it works at first, then I got accustomed to it eventually and Mandy just made me feel easy with it. It turned out to be really easy to deal with. 
I really enjoyed my stay. I just can't find what more to say to praise the place. I will definitely choose Mandy's again when I visit SEA if she is OK. 
I do want to give more than 5 stars to this place.  
Thanks Mandy!"
1733747,23823168,2014-12-11,3883818,Benjamin,"I completely recommend Mandy's house for both short and long stays.  Mandy has taken great care to make her well-designed house feel like a home.  The kitchen is well-equipped and great for cooking, and the whole house is regularly cleaned.  The neighborhood itself is both quiet and diverse, and the house is a short walk to the Columbia City Link station.  Close enough to downtown Seattle without the noise and cramped feeling.  Mandy was also friendly and available to chat, and made my experience better however she could.   Definitely would stay here again and recommend it highly to anyone coming to Seattle."
1733747,24121748,2014-12-20,20445988,Abby,Mandy is an excellent host. This was the second time I stayed with her. I was glad I had time to chat with her this time! She is a very interesting person and the conversation was great! She is incredibly sweet and does everything in her power to make you feel comfortable. She even has extra maps of the city to help you get oriented! Her home is very clean and welcoming and the location is super convenient. Stay here!!
1733747,24496829,2014-12-29,24112693,Megan,"Everything was very clearly explained (alarm, trash, etc) and Mandy asked us throughout our stay if we needed anything. When we did need something she was pretty prompt in responding via Airbnb, which we used to communicate even if she was up in her room. She also gave us suggestions on a few places in the neighborhood that were spot on. The bed was a little low for my husband (who is 6'6""), but overall, the bed and the room were cozy. She kept the heat at a comfortable level and we were even able to enjoy the roku box that she bought while we were there. Good times were had!"
1733747,25233920,2015-01-10,16581262,Amanda,"Mandy was an amazing host and her home is modern, clean, and really a work of art in itself. The bedroom was not exactly how it appears in the photos but it was extremely well furnished, cozy, relaxing, and came with an incredibly spacious closet where I was able to store all of my luggage and growing collection of clothing and souvenirs. I preferred it to the picture. She loves to play with space and it definitely shows. Aside from the comfortable stay, there was so much to do around town. The light rail was within easy walking distance, which made it very simple to get around. Mandy was extremely helpful, having plenty of suggestions as well as a sincere desire to hear feedback in order to make her place an even more welcoming and user friendly experience. I really enjoyed our little chats over tea after a long day of exploring. Would absolutely stay again!! Thank you for being such a critical part of my wonderful Seattle adventure, Mandy!"
1733747,25481218,2015-01-17,11453116,Steven,"Mandy was an excellent host! I stayed with her to enable myself to look for a job and a permanent place to live.  Thanks to her support and advice, I was able to land both within a weeks time.  If you like the outdoors and appreciate green living, I definitely recommend this place for a stay.  Mandy has a great collection of hiking books and the entire house is designed to be environmentally conscious.  
Thanks again Mandy!"
1733747,25625438,2015-01-20,26334154,Ginger,"Had a nice stay at Mandy's green home. It was just as described. Booked one night and decided to extend to enjoy the area and her place. My husband and I found the space plenty roomy, nicely decorated, and clean. Interesting urban construction for those into green building and water collection. I was driving in Seattle on my trip and found her place very easy to get to. Additionally, she is close to the hip and gastronomically diverse Columbia City neighborhood. Mandy knows the area well and is conversational and helpful with suggestions. Thank you, will recommend to anyone I know traveling the area."
1733747,27052708,2015-02-24,25905556,Evangeline,"I was very fortunate to have Mandy as a host. I needed a place to stay while job hunting and relocating from Texas, and Mandy made me feel extremely welcome in her home. Mandy is a wise and gracious host. The knowledge and the perspective that she shared during conversation was an unexpected but welcome benefit of my stay. 

The room itself was fantastic. The room has a restful vibe, perfect for the weary traveller. The overall atmosphere of the house is remarkably peaceful. I'm not much of a travel critic, but I do have a good ""sixth sense"" for certain things. In my opinion, this room is a hidden treasure here at AirBnb.

The location was excellent. You're a short walk from the Central Link and it can take you to the heart of Seattle's bustling downtown. Columbia City is a short walk away as well, and it is an interesting location - a place of culture and energy hidden away from tall buildings and crowded freeways. I loved my visits to the area.

I am now a permanent resident of Seattle (my job hunt went well), and I strongly recommend ""Relax in best of City Green Living"" as a strongly positive AirBnb experience."
1733747,36171330,2015-06-26,6442814,Heather,"I'm a traveling nurse and have been using Air B&B for each of my assigments over the past few years and have had some wonderful experiences with Air B&B but Mandy's place has by far been the most comfortable.  The location is great (just a couple blocks from the the link which takes you both to downtown Seattle and the airport, walking distance to several shops/cafes/bars in the quaint downtown Columbia City and just a bike rides distance from the beautiful Lake Washington and several parks) and her place instantly gives off a zen like feeling when you walk in thanks to the simple decor and numerous plants. The kitchen is enormous and comes equiped with all the essentials plus much more (fancy coffee maker, soundbar in living room to make your cooking experience even more enjoyable, awesome blender, etc) not to mention you have fresh herbs to cook with from Mandy's garden (mint and rosemary) and strawberries to pick for dessert.  The room is spacious with a huge closet and windows that provide you with a view of the park that is always swarming with the cute neighbor kids.  Mandy is a great host whom I've enjoyed getting to know.  While I've loved all the places I have stayed at with Air B&B, Mandy's place is the first that has felt like home :) "
1733747,38588841,2015-07-17,29516590,Nancy,"I am sad to say, Mandy was out of town when we stayed at the ""Relax in Best of City Green Living"", but Haellen was very sweet and helped us get around Seattle.  The house is exactly how it is in the pictures, clean, straight lines and inviting.  The neighborhood was quite!  The overall experience was awesome and I will definitely book with Mandy in the Future!  Thank you!!"
1733747,46514946,2015-09-11,32419224,Loren,"Very nice modern home, close to light rail and interesting neighborhood. "
1733747,46922718,2015-09-14,1004422,Carme,"Haellen was the one who looked after me while staying at Mandy's place. Amazing woman with amazing stories. Fast response from the host before and during my stay.

Room is clean with comfortable bed. Love the huge almost walk in closet. Toilet is clean :) 

Good location especially for those taking the Ligh Rail.

I had a great and comfortable stay @ Mandy's place. Highly recommended !!!"
1733747,47136293,2015-09-15,36383074,Colin,"This place was one of the nicest AirBnBs I have come across, im just upset I only got to stay such a short time!  I didnt get the chance to meet Mandy but her communication was great and she explained everything really well for me to gain entry and leave without any problems!  The house was immaculate, and beautiful!  I will 100% be searching for Mandy's listing first the next time I am in Seattle thats for sure!"
1733747,47420600,2015-09-18,3683562,Kasia,"Mandy's place was wonderful. It felt and looked like a boutique hotel. Close to the link rail and halfway between the airport and downtown--perfect with or without a car... I had one day without and one day with. Overall, I'd highly recommend staying here, though I'd prefer to keep it my little ""secret"". 

Mandy and Haellen were very responsive and welcoming. Thank you for the hospitality!!! I can't wait to cone back for a longer stay. (Maybe by then the fresh bread and coffee idea will be a reality ;)"
1733747,48104974,2015-09-23,6457901,Carey,"
Mandy‚Äôs house is in a fascinating urban development that feels like a quiet little international village with a beautiful green Commons. I felt very comfortable there and thoroughly enjoyed my early morning walk to the nearby light rail. 

There‚Äôs a lot to be learned in this residential project. The design and intentions address both social and environmental challenges facing us all. The ‚Äúgreen‚Äù elements of the house were heartening to witness. I appreciated the soundless staircase with facings of cork, the large sinks throughout, the radiant heat, the fresh air exchange, to mention just a few of the ‚Äúgreen‚Äù features in the townhouse. The kitchen was a dream to use and the dining/living room area on the first floor were especially inviting. The welcoming, bright and cheerful flower garden in the front sets this town house apart from the others.

My room faced south with three large windows showing that very desirable view of Mt. Ranier. The room was spacious, thoughtfully and tastefully appointed. The same can be said of the convenient, shared, bathroom. The two guest bedrooms were far enough removed from each other as well as Mandy‚Äôs sister Haellen‚Äôs residence ‚Äì upstairs - to ensure quiet and privacy for all.  My bed was comfortable, the linens were luxurious, including a down duvet. 

While I never got to meet Mandy, Haellen was in the house to welcome and orient me when I arrived. She kindly accepted my suitcase which arrived before I did! The flexibility of the check in/ check out times is a real plus. I know I would have enjoyed spending more time getting to know Haellen, but my stay was short and I was rushed. Guests get a great big bang for their bucks in this winning airbnb. This one goes to the top of my wish list.
"
1733747,48254758,2015-09-24,43499,Patrick,"Wow, Is the only way I can begin to express the unique and beautiful experience I had for my short stay at at Mandy and Haellen's home. Right from the detailed information how to get to their home using the transit light rail from Seatac airport which was very easy, to getting into their home which is in a lovely quite area. Every thing from the bedroom to the bathroom and Kitchen was like a modern, self catering apartment with the benefit of Hosts who were extremely helpful to me as being from Ireland and not familiar with travelling in U.S. were able to help me to the nth degree to ensure that I had no issues for my journey by train and bus for Ferry to Orcas island the following day and I particularly want to thank Haellen in this regard as the personal service I received was second to none and I can only recommend anyone that wants a top class experience at an airbnb to stay with Mandy & Haellen "
1733747,48567555,2015-09-27,7993851,Samantha,"The room was clean, a bit small but good for one person or coming and going as I did. The neighborhood is in south Seattle driving got everywhere within 15 minutes. There is parking at the place. Driving in Seattle really sucks though. 

The host was nice, and happy it was quiet, clean, and chill"
1733747,51526512,2015-10-21,15876691,John,"I really enjoyed my stay at Mandy's place.  Her sister was very accommodating, the location was very convenient, the neighbors were nice, and the place was really clean.  To stay in such a great place with such a low cost is unbelievable.  

The thing I loved the most was the bed.  I was able to get a lot of good sleep while I was here.  "
6182715,56549878,2015-12-14,15436124,Dan,"David's place is just as described and right in one of my favorite Seattle neighborhoods, Capital Hill. Steps away from great bars and breweries like Unicorn and Elysian, and some of the best NYC style pizza I've had on the west coast (Big Mario's). 

The studio is tiny but you shouldn't be spending your time there anyway! Yes, even if it's raining. David was professional and available, and replied right away when we had an issue on arrival. Checkout is also a breeze and makes getting to your next destination less stressful."
3637180,16050651,2014-07-20,17207294,Label,Make sure you have references to make her feel safe but good location.
3637180,16438367,2014-07-27,18495034,Mark,"Lynda is an amazing host. Felt very welcome in the wonderful neighborhood. She made bagels and (really great) coffee with a french press every morning. Rooms were clean and pleasant. I had access to a washer and dryer to do laundry which was very convenient. Green Lake is a wonderful neighborhood - I went for runs around Green Lake and enjoyed Diva Coffee shop less than a block from Lynda's home. Thanks so much for a wonderful stay, I'll definitely be back if the opportunity arises. "
3637180,16860700,2014-08-03,3885201,Nikolay,"Staying at Lynda's house was great, a real home!

Lynda is very welcoming host, always open to communication and really helpful.
Room, the house itself and the garden are very nice and comfortable to stay.
Neighborhood is safe, has plenty of shops and restaurants nearby. It is conveniently connected by bus with downtown and other areas, the bus stop is about two minutes walk from the house.
Highly recommend to stay and definitely stay again next time to Seattle."
3637180,17806758,2014-08-17,12405195,Philip,"Staying at Lynda's was a great experience. Everything in the listing was just as described. The room was comfortable, the home was inviting and Lynda was friendly and welcoming and best of all, she makes a great French press coffee. There were bagels and fruit available in the morning and Lynda invited me to take full advantage of her beautiful backyard space to read the morning paper and enjoy some conversation with her. 

I only stayed until about 11 the next morning, so I didn't get much of a chance to explore the area, but there is a coffee place just up the block with great lattes and breakfast food. There were several bus routes nearby so it's accessible to the green lake area and to downtown. 

One thing to keep in mind, you may share a bathroom with another airbnb guest. There are two guest rooms on the first floor level and they share a restroom, so it's not exactly a private bathroom, just private from the rest of the home. 

In all, it was a wonderful experience and I would definitely recommend. Thanks again, Lynda! "
3637180,18022549,2014-08-20,4872071,Jenna,"Perfect location for exploring the area or walking to Green Lake.  Lynda was a consummate hostess checking to make sure I was comfortable and had everything I might need.  In addition to extra towels, she provided toiletries if necessary as well as a hairdryer.  She went above and beyond to ensure a fantastic stay!"
3637180,18683318,2014-08-30,14862233,David,"Very nice accommodations, super clean bathroom, really comfortable bed. Lynda goes out of her way to make you comfortable and welcomed. Great location in Ballard for exploring Seattle. Highly recommended."
3637180,19224926,2014-09-08,12317528,Emily,"I stayed at Lynda's during the week between my arrival in Seattle and the day that I could move into my new apartment. Her accommodations were just what I was looking for! I felt safe and welcomed in her home. She had coffee and bagels in the morning, and the bathroom is stocked with any amenities you might need. I was also happy to be able to spend some time out on her porch with her and her friends!  Also note that she rents another room out, so you will share a bathroom if another guest is there. That was fine with me, but good to know in case you aren't comfortable with that. I would absolutely recommend staying at Lynda for anyone coming to Seattle. It is in a fantastic location - walkable to many coffee shops, bars, a farmers market, grocery store, and pharmacy. "
3637180,19501211,2014-09-13,1262962,Anne,"Linda ist eine sehr symphatische, aufmerksame & hilfsbereite Gastgeberin."
3637180,19728912,2014-09-17,1743914,Negina,This location was near many things without being in the middle of downtown. We ate out many times at restaurants and cafes within walking distance. Lynda always had breakfast-y things available in the morning.
3637180,20073734,2014-09-22,20111392,Alexander,"We had a wonderful stay at Lynda's place! Even though we booked on very short notice, she was extremely accommodating and helpful throughout our stay. The room was very nice as well, the bed extremely comfortable, everything perfectly clean and tidy and she even provides very nice breakfast. This was our first Airbnb experience and it was a very positive one."
3637180,25286855,2015-01-11,5872638,Juventino,"This was our second time staying with Lynda. Her location to the highway, public transportation and grocery store are superb and this has us coming back to stay with her every time we visit Seattle!

Lynda is a very gracious host from checking in to checking out. The bed is very comfortable and both the bedroom & bathroom are very clean."
3637180,25454437,2015-01-16,20640343,Natalie,"Lynda is a delightful host. She made me feel welcome and comfortable. The neighborhood was nice, the house is close to everything I needed. Sharing with the other guest was easy and unimposing. Easy informal access to the kitchen. Nice stay, nice host. Will rent again and recommend to others."
3637180,25604852,2015-01-20,10786256,Tarik,"An accurate description! A great comfy and quiet place, easy access to any part of Seattle. 
Lynda was responsive and available, and it felt like my own little hotel room. Cool neighborhood with good food and coffee places nearby. "
3637180,26556990,2015-02-15,26029925,Michelle,"I loved staying with Lynda & Max the cat, both are warm & friendly! I stayed with Lynda for a week while looking for an apartment in the Seattle area. As this was my first experience with Airbnb, Lynda answered my questions quickly and thoroughly. The night of check in, she was out but had a detailed welcome note and the light was on in my room. The room is inviting and neatly furnished. Sharing the bathroom with another guest was no problem. Though the house is on a main street, parking in front of the house was easy to find.  Lynda is an considerate hostess and provides resources for sight seeing, transportation. She will suggest local events too. I ended up attending a Paint Dance Party at a gallery nearby and it was such a fun experience! As other reviewers have mentioned, Lynda makes fresh pressed coffee in the morning and I enjoyed meeting some of her friends who are into wine also. I definitely will recommend Lynda's house to friends. Especially if they enjoy wine ;)"
3637180,26924336,2015-02-22,23587836,Helen,Had an amazing trip in Seattle and the stay at Lynda's was perfect. She was incredibly welcoming and it was lovely getting to know her and having breakfast together each morning. Couldn't have asked for a more accommodating host and will stay again if we are back in Seattle. The location was great with easy public transport as well as being a cute neighbourhood in itself. Thanks Lynda! 
3637180,27107946,2015-02-25,923776,Kathy,"This place was perfect for what I needed. Lynda was a great host, very welcoming with some helpful suggestions. Room size was fine for one person and there wasn't anyone in the other room, so I didn't have to share a bathroom! Overall, great place and wouldn't hesitate to stay there again if ever back in Seattle."
3637180,28098019,2015-03-17,28699363,Kate,"We chose Lynda's home for it's proximity to local restaurants and the UW, attractiveness, and price, and it was the best in all categories!  Her home was close to MANY great restaurants and shops and it was a great area to walk around in.  The room was very comfortable and clean.  Lynda was very accommodating and went above an beyond in terms of our specific needs!  We had a great stay."
3637180,28624316,2015-03-27,11549403,Austin,"Lynda keeps a lovely home with a beautiful backyard/deck area in a quite neighborhood in northern (to me) Seattle.

While small, for an individual on a business trip, the room suited me very well. Located on the bottom/basement floor, I had room #2 (of 2‚Äìthere is another, slightly larger room for other potential airbnb guests. There were two others staying in the other room for a few days when I was there and for the most part I didn't even notice). It had a very comfortable bed and bedding, a small armoire, desk, and night stand, and some other shelving gave me room to store my things. It feels nice a private too.

Lynda provides fresh ground coffee and a French press each morning as well as single serving oatmeal packs, fruit, bagels and/or bread, and peanut butter which made for a really nice way to start the day.

She's also a generous host with her time and home in general. While it wasn't necessary, one evening she offered/allowed a friend of mine visiting from Portland for the day to stay the evening so as to avoid late night driving back to Portland in the rain. Another time she made and shared dinner with me one evening and let me do a couple loads of laundry‚Äìthis was, in both cases, very much appreciated.

Bottom line, if you are looking for a simple, away from the hullaballoo of the city escape to get away to when you head back to during a visit to Seattle, this is a fine spot for you. You will find Lynda and her home a great option."
3637180,28745381,2015-03-29,29450856,Gabe,"First off, I'm glad to say that my first AirBnB experience was a positive one thanks to Lynda. She's both warm and accommodating, and frankly does ABnB a great service by being a member! Secondly, the home is in a great location, nice neighborhood, near great restaurants and amenities, the room quiet and bed comfortable...all your short-term needs are cared for. Parking was never an issue (something I was initially concerned about), though is somewhat limited. All told, I feel I made the right choice, and my trip was enjoyable because of it. Thanks so much, Lynda and ABnB!"
3637180,29064929,2015-04-03,29542578,Kym,"The rooms were very comfortable and a very good value.  The linens are good quality and ""little extras"" are provided for the guests use.  You do need to enter through the garage and the rooms are in the basement, yet they are reasonably warm and quiet.  "
3637180,29871634,2015-04-13,9319986,Chlo√©,"Loved the charm of the neighborhood and its accessibility to all other parts of Seattle. Lynda is well-prepared with all the information you need to know on where to go and how to get there. Her house is homey, and her garden is a lovely place to relax. I appreciate her great hospitality in inviting me to taste wines, and she is prompt in answering any phone calls or emails with questions. Rooms are simple and clean with plenty of space for clothes, books, etc. "
3637180,30741188,2015-04-26,31694280,Bridget,Lynda made me feel very welcome. She was very accomodating even though I had a bit of a hectic schedule. It was easy to come and go as I pleased. The neighborhood was nice and I enjoyed running to Green Lake during my stay. Street parking was available which was very convenient. It was my first experience with airbnb and I would definitely recommend it.
3637180,31191229,2015-05-03,29450374,David,Nice room with comfortable bed. Easy to come and go. Lynda was every nice and make you fell welcome. It's close to lots of coffee shops and restaurants. 
3637180,31658446,2015-05-08,1036387,Cynthia,"Lynda was a lovely host - friendly and attentive but didn't hover at all. She had water and some snacks available which was a nice touch. Visitors are free to come and go through the garage entrance so no worries about coming and going. I actually ended up staying in her other room, which was a little larger due to some logistics. It was comfortable and clean and private. The neighborhood was really cute with independent coffee shops (Neptune Coffee was great) and food. Green Lake was also walking distance about a mile away. I would definitely stay again. "
3637180,32244840,2015-05-16,24285704,Thomas,"Lynda is very welcoming. We found everything as described and much more. It was really fun sharing our travel experiences. In total, a great stay!"

Due to changes in my stay here in Seattle, I needed to stay one extra day and since she already was booked, she offered her sofa to stay on! Overall, it's a great place, very close to the major bus-lines, to Ballard, Green Lake and Downtown. It's a quiet place and very clean. Highly recommended!

3637180,34099122,2015-06-04,26896724,Laura,"Lynda was the most incredible host--I don't know where to begin! The room---that bed was the most comfortable bed I have ever slept in. Parking right outside the door. Within walking distance to a STUNNING lake. Lynda is a great person, always up for a cup of tea and some chats while also respecting my space. 
Lynda is also very kind in leaving a light breakfast every morning. 
Her place is more like a high class BnB than the usual AirBnB's that I'm used to ---- definitely STAY! "

Lynda was a terrific host who gave me concise directions to her house and also volunteered herself to show me to her house. The room that I stayed at was really like the photographs I saw, or even better. Lots of bedsheets and pillows to sleep on and the room was quite cosy as well. There's a cupboard to hang clothes and a television, but I didn't watch TV there. The bathroom was superbly clean, with many towels of different sizes and needs and soaps if you need to use them. Just remember that the faucets operate by pulling them to turn on and pushing them to turn off. It was really a home away from home.

Lynda offered lots of maps and guides to me and also gave me some recommendations on where to eat and also where to see the sunset (Golden Gardens Park, near Ballard). The area she resides has lots of eateries, and her house is easily accessed by a bus from downtown. 

Lynda offered to make for me hot chocolate, and she provided me with an exotic kind which I liked. She offered fruits, bread, bagels, juice and more for breakfast which is more than enough for your stay. It's nice to sit in the kitchen or even out in the garden, to hear the nice songs of the birds, see the birds feed from the bird feeders and feel the summer breeze.

I had very wonderful conversations with her and even had conversations with her friends who came over for wine and food. Her son was here on my last day in Seattle and he was fine and asked if everything is fine. 

Her listing is perfect! "

She left a welcome note and everything we could possibly need. Also, she provided a small breakfast and coffee every morning. It was a very pleasant stay and I would definitely recommend friends and family staying with her if they were to visit Seattle."
3637180,35569622,2015-06-20,11459164,Stephanie,"Lynda was an amazing host! From the beautifully prepared room to the open kitchen and wonderful conversations, I had a fantastic time staying with her. Her son Mark is also wonderful. Lynda's deck is the perfect place for evening dinner/dessert or early-morning breakfast. The neighborhood is also beautiful, with multiple coffeehouses and restaurants one block away and a beautiful lake nearby. Highly recommended!"
3637180,36473873,2015-06-28,21783139,Sarah,"Lynda was great! She was so welcoming and friendly, and made sure to invite us to join her for coffee and pastries each morning. Though we were never able to join her because of our plans each day, the gesture was much appreciated. She even provided bottled water and Seattle tour guide books for us to page through.

The neighborhood was so cute and peaceful, and with ample parking. It's a short walk to Green Lake, which is beautiful. I'd absolutely recommend staying here!"

3637180,37509740,2015-07-07,36544565,Ho Ching,"Great location; s exactly the type of host that everybody wants to stay with.

The room is lovely. The bed is very comfortable; the shower is nice. Even though we are living under the same roof as the host, we had the privacy that we needed. 

More flexible than a hotel; comparable quality to a hotel, but cheaper than a hotel."
3637180,38163427,2015-07-13,5562445,Amy,"Lynda was an absolute wonderful host!  She made us feel very welcomed and provided us with fresh fruit, yogurt, coffee, and juice in the mornings.  We enjoyed chatting with Lynda as we were trying to learn about Seattle's neighborhoods.  It was also very pleasant to sit on her deck during sunny mornings.  Lynda's home is very comfortable and convenient to get to via public transportation.  There are plenty of good restaurants, cafes, and bookshops nearby.  "
3637180,38639921,2015-07-17,35210717,Heather,"Lynda was a great host! She greeted me when I arrived, made sure I had everything I needed, and helped me figure out the local bus routes. The room was very comfortable and cozy too! I'd definitely stay with Lynda again on future trip to Seattle."
