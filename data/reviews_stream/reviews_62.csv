The pictures don't do the space justice; in person, the apartment is bigger.  You really feel like you're coming home instead of renting someone else's place.  Next time I visited Seattle, I'll be calling Marcell."
1732441,21185468,2014-10-12,22309098,Brian,"The space was fantastic.  It was nice and roomy, with plenty of space for the three of us.  Even though there were other people staying in the house, there was never any noise.

And did I mention robots????  There are robots in the house!!!!  

this is a great place to stay when you want to get away from the hustle and bustle of Seattle, but still be close enough to get int o town with just a quick ten minute drive.

We will definitely be booking here again!"
1732441,21368052,2014-10-15,22103623,Mitchell,Marcell was a great host. He was very welcoming and gave us suggestions for places to go and things to do. The apartment was very clean and comfortable. Would definitely recommend staying with Marcell.
1732441,21635321,2014-10-20,8175037,Stephanie,"Fabulous apartment in a great part of Seattle. Marcell was helpful and kind at check-in and responded immediately to any questions during our stay. Alki Beach and downtown Seattle are just minutes away, but sitting on the balcony of this apartment with a coffee and enjoying the crisp air and beautiful surroundings was truly the best part of staying here. This place is spacious, clean, quiet and awesomely decorated. I would recommend it to anyone."
1732441,21980542,2014-10-27,9624937,Colin And Allie,"The place is GREAT!  Balcony overlooking pretty trees, Marcell's sculptures, comfortable bed, nice bathroom and kitchen.  We really felt at home and enjoyed our time there.  We would definitely stay again if we come back to Seattle.  

Very cool location in West Seattle, not far from anything.  Easy access to the highways and off street parking. "
1732441,22385929,2014-11-04,1147826,Victoria,"Marcell's place is by far the best place I've stayed through airbnb. The space is large, homey and artsy. Decorated with his awesome art pieces  along with CDs, DVDs , percussion instruments, a great sound system and lots of plants and personal decorations, it feels more like staying with a good friend than just a short-term rental. Marcell's a great host providing organic cereal, organic almond milk, filtered water, shampoo, conditioner, soap, ample towels, warm flannel sheets and down comforters, off street parking, etc. There's also a gas fireplace, making the place warm and cozy on gray days. Across the street from a green belt and surrounded by trees, you feel far away from the city, even though downtown Seattle is only ten minutes away. The quality of the local shops and restaurants and Alki Beach make this an excellent location to stay while in Seattle. Highly recommended!"
1732441,23109732,2014-11-23,22853187,Drew,"Marcell does strike a great balance between being available and friendly and giving one privacy. He also seems to be a very thoughtful and genuinely nice person. In my case, I'm fairly private, but Marcell didn't seem put off or annoyed that I wanted to do my own thing. The apartment is very well equipped and has most any thing you could possibly need during your stay. It really is more like staying at a friends house than at a hotel!"
1732441,24558707,2014-12-30,11103921,Diana,"We loved our stay at green on green! The place is homey, unique, clean, and bigger than expected. It is a short ride from Seattle attractions yet is in a peaceful neighborhood. The balcony is a lovely place to relax and sip on a warm beverage. Marcell is very nice, helpful and easy to coordinate with. He goes above and beyond providing shower gel, shampoo, cereal and other goodies. I will definitely stay here again when I'm back in Seattle. "
1732441,24651868,2015-01-01,2930805,Jessica,"We had a fantastic stay at this spacious, funky top level apartment. Marcell is a lovely host, super friendly and the suite had everything we could have possibly needed. Love the location too. I would definitely request a stay here again the next time we are in Seattle. The place was perfect!"
1732441,25503947,2015-01-18,5356356,Tim,"We had a great stay at Marcell's  place! The location is just outside of the city and feels peaceful and remote, just a short drive gets you into the city. The place is well appointed, the bed is very comfortable and having a private deck is very nice (and a gas fireplace inside!). There is a big and mostly fenced in field nearby where we were able to take our dog and let him run around. Marcell is a great communicator and helped us with anything we needed. Would stay again!"
1732441,26142464,2015-02-04,26804905,Christoph,"Marcell's apartment is conveniently located in west Seattle making it a perfect place for holiday and business travelers alike. The close proximity to down town makes it a perfect base for exploring everything Seattle has to offer. the apartment itself is clean, well maintained and also quite spacious and since there is a large couch in the living room it can easily accommodate up to 3 guests. Marcell was very friendly and helpful and when we had a questions he would answer almost always instantly by texting us.  I highly recommend his apartment to anyone wishing to stay in a clean apartment close to downtown Seattle."
1732441,32969423,2015-05-24,9079341,Cynthia,"Great, great, great place to stay if you're visiting Seattle. Fifteen minutes from the airport in a very quiet neighborhood, yet just a 10 minute drive from the busyness of downtown and the waterfront. The apartment is on the top floor, very private and equipped with pretty much everything you could expect from a vacation rental, including access to a washer/dryer if you're staying longer. The weather was unusually nice for the time of year so we were out and about most of the time but the apartment also has satellite TV and an eclectic collection of books and art to keep you entertained if you're staying in. Marcell is an excellent host, friendly and welcoming without being intrusive. He accommodated our late arrival and made himself available for any requests, but let us have our privacy. We would definitely stay here again if we ever made a return trip to Seattle."
1732441,38247661,2015-07-14,25476689,Gwen,Marcel was quite the host and had everything in place when we got there. He even provided a futon bed for my granddaughter as well; which she thought was quite comfy! The apartment was as presented on the website and was quite spacious.  Marcel provided a fan when the weather got hot but it was actually pretty cool up there with all the windows open and a nice breeze blowing. The neighborhood with nice and quiet with ample front parking which was not on the street.  It was nice not to be right in down town Seattle as we were visiting my daughter and granddaughter for the month but was just a short ride (15 min) to their place in Queen Ann Hill.  There were several wading pools in the neighborhood for the little ones and also a beach  that was nice as well.   
1732441,38613068,2015-07-17,34415121,Patrick-Daniel,"The house was extremely homey and clean. It had everything necessary for our stay and we were very happy with it. Although we never met Marcell, his parents were very welcoming. Privacy was a major priority when searching for an Airbnb and that priority was met. I would definitely recommend Marcells house to anyone who decides to travel to Seattle!"
1732441,39288664,2015-07-22,34741250,Carmen,The stay was wonderful! Marcell was extremely accommodating and always around and responsive if we had any questions. The apartment itself was fabulous. Very spacious. Fantastic kitchen and very comfortable couch! And the art pieces were beautiful. 
1732441,39570086,2015-07-24,38611312,Lisa,Marcell was a great Host.  Very welcoming and had everything I could possibly need for our stay.  Staying in West Seattle was really nice and quiet and it's just a short trip over to downtown Seattle. We loved staying there and would stay there again if we ever make it back.
1732441,39911511,2015-07-27,25900849,Robin,"Marcell was a very accommodating host. We were very grateful for the food and milk in the fridge upon our arrival! The accommodation was exactly as described, thanks Marcell!"
1732441,41730251,2015-08-09,30020739,Rodney,"If you're looking for a nice and cheap place that's also close to downtown, book Marcell's house now! It has everything you’ll need in a house within your short stay: stove, fridge, cooking utensils and even oil and condiments. You can cook breakfast and save money.
If you need a grocery store, The QFC is 5 minutes away. 

We felt at home immediately and it had a nice atmosphere. The place is very clean. He had a lot of gadgets and gizmos, which were really interesting. My favorite one is the woodpecker and the lava lamp. Marcell was even nice enough to provide us with a futon for our third guest.

Marcell is awesome. He's very down-to-Earth. We were so lucky to have him. We also met his father during one of the days we stayed (we stayed for a whole week) and we immediately knew where he got his personality from. "
1732441,48612441,2015-09-27,5495762,Philippe,"Marcell est un hôte extrêmement sympathique et accueillant. Il est ainsi venu nous chercher en voiture à l'arrêt de bus près de chez lui le soir de notre arrivée afin de nous éviter de monter les grands escaliers (environ 300 marches !) qui mènent à sa rue avec nos bagages, nous a offert une bouteille d'un excellent vin rouge californien en guise de bienvenue, et nous a raccompagnés à l'arrêt de bus le jour de notre départ. Bref, un hôte parfait !
Quant au logement qu'il nous a loué, il est spacieux, fonctionnel et confortable (il occupe tout le troisième niveau de sa maison), dispose d'une grande terrasse très agréable, et n'est situé qu'à 20 minutes environ du centre-ville (10 minutes de marche + 10 minutes de bus).
En résumé, un hôte et un logement cinq étoiles que nous recommandons chaudement !

Philippe"
1732441,49377104,2015-10-03,44557688,Peter,I would recommend Marcell's room to anyone!  We arrived late at night and he still waited up for us.  He even offered us some soup he had made earlier since we had not eaten anything for dinner.  Provided cereal and bananas for breakfast.  The place was super clean and comfortable.  He even prepared clean towels and tooth paste for us.  Would stay here again anytime!
1732441,49815110,2015-10-06,44019974,Turner,"The stay was amazing, the house was beautiful and Marcel was a fantastic host. He made sure we were set for our stay and we were incredibly satisfied. The house isn't a far drive from anything, only 30min from the waterfall and 10min from the city. There are great restaurants in West Seattle that you could even walk to. Overall loved this place and wish I could've stayed longer."
1732441,51204196,2015-10-18,2724426,Dhiren,"Marcell was prompt and immediate in his responses. He was outside in the garden when I arrived. Insisted on carrying a heavy bag upstairs and briefed me on the flat.

Honestly, its brilliant. Private, with a beautiful deck with only trees in front, tasteful furnishings, a fully equipped kitchen WITH and oven, Healthy breakfast snacks and almond milk, large and well equipped bathroom- I plan to come back and stay a month! Its that superb!!"
1732441,58174387,2016-01-01,4287335,Adrianna,"The accomdations were clean,  fully equipped, spacious and welcoming. Marcell was great! He was a thoughtful host. The location was accessible and convenient, including the parking. We loved our time at Marcell's! "
5749958,31219577,2015-05-03,2991479,Ruth,Our host had wine and flowers waiting for us. We felt very welcome.
5749958,32943143,2015-05-23,33530527,Vicki,Alan and Katence really made us feel welcome and at home. The guest house was exactly as described. Every email and question was answered before and during our stay. The Ballard neighborhood was fun and we explored Fremont by bus too. Wonderful restaurants within walking. We appreciated information brochures and maps on nearby neighborhoods. We recommend this great place to stay.
5749958,33379082,2015-05-27,18609946,Allison,"What a great get away! Located in the very fun and adorable Ballard neighborhood, this listing was absolutely perfect for our long holiday weekend in Seattle. 
The house is so cute! Extremely clean and well appointed, it was exactly as advertised. Definitely enough space for ourselves, another couple, and their toddler. The kitchen came in extremely handy for early morning breakfasts, snacks, and a final night of easy dinner. It was clean and had all the creature comforts of home (comfy couch and beds/towels/full kitchen/great shower). Parking was not a hassle at all and we were easily able to park in front of the location all weekend.
Located just 15 minutes from downtown Seattle, this place allowed us to get to all the touristy spots quite easily while also letting us explore the charming Ballard neighborhood. Alan & Katence were kind enough to leave us with a very extensive list of recommendations as well as a great brewery map. Extremely helpful!
Alan & Katence were extremely communicative and very pleasant. Although it turned out that we couldn't check in until late in the afternoon, they were kind enough to recommend a great seafood spot as well as provided updates on the availability of the place throughout the day.
Having such a nice, cozy place to come back to really helped us rest and relax in between adventures. My husband and I would definitely come back here again. Thank you, Alan and Katence!"
5749958,34573100,2015-06-09,20943782,Jason,   This little house is simply well appointed and charming!  We had a great long weekend stay.  Not only is the house comfortable but it also has everything you need if you decide to stay in which is a hard decision to make considering the location.  Great restaurants and pubs lie within minutes of the house in either direction although you are nestled in a quiet little neighborhood.  Additionally there is a great Sunday farmer's market on Ballard Ave.  Wouldn't hesitate to stay at Alan & Katence's house again!
5749958,35075465,2015-06-15,29965758,Brenda,"Alan and Katence were wonderful hosts.  Their house was in a perfect location for our stay, charming and very comfortable.  Even better than the pictures! The kitchen was well equipped and they provided us with a list of personal suggestions of sights to see and yummy eats to try as well.  The location was perfect for walking into Ballard restaurants and coffee spots. It was easy access to all other major Seattle activities as well.  We would definitely stay here again!  Thanks!"
5749958,35387815,2015-06-18,10334671,Lisa,"The house is lovely, light and spacious, and beautifully decorated.  Check in was easy and communication with the hosts fast and simple.  The house is in a great neighborhood--safe, well maintained houses. We walked everywhere (we did not have a car). Easy walk to grocery store, coffee shops, and restaurants.  I took public transportation form the airport and the house is located 3 blocks from the bus stop.  "
5749958,35549052,2015-06-20,30176605,Mary Beth,"This was an attractive and comfortable place in a great location for my family and my sister and niece. Alan and Katence left a nice personalized note for us, and a thorough list of local restaurants and bars. We had great privacy and didn't see the downstairs renter at all. We were able to walk to Ballard restaurants and shops from the house. Parking was easily available in front of the house

It's not as spacious as some other places that sleep six, so for a group that size, you may feel a bit on top of each other. They provided a few snacks and beer/wine for an extra charge, but you'll want to bring things like coffee or tea if you want to have those on hand. "
5749958,35928916,2015-06-23,21621604,Oliver,"We love downtown Ballard as one of Seattle's most walkable and charming neighborhoods offering a Farmer's market, pubs, jazz music on weekend nights, gelato, and a well equipped local Ballard grocery store. Alan and Katence's house is about a mile from my favorite Ballard pub. The upper floor where we stayed for 3 nights, was clean and decorated tastefully with an eye for detail, local artifacts and catering to the needs of visitors. I was thrilled to find local beer in the fridge which I could either restock at the market or pay for at pretty much the same price.

Alan and Katence checked up on us the day after we arrived to make sure we had all we needed.

Highly recommended!"
5749958,36156475,2015-06-25,21462166,Lian,Alan & Katence were very responsive and helpful at confirming our last minute day of request to stay. The house was super cute and exactly what my friends and I were looking for to accommodate our vacation / tour of the Seattle neighborhoods. Full kitchen perfect for our purposes. Location wise the house was great and walkable to Ballard Ave. and restaurants.
5749958,36272506,2015-06-27,31086144,Mary,The Phinney Ballard Retreat was very nice! It was a great location close to restaurants and convenient to downtown Ballard and Seattle. In a very quiet neighborhood! Alan and Kadence were very accommodating! Thank You!
5749958,36557731,2015-06-29,32936969,Darlene,"This was a perfect place for us to stay while visiting Seattle.  We enjoyed a wonderful tapas restaurant right in downtown Ballard and we were able to use convenient public transport to go downtown Seattle to see the sights there. The house was very clean, well furnished and inviting. Alan even brought us an additional fan/AC unit because the weather was extremely hot when we were there.  We would definitely go back if we are in the Seattle area again.
Darlene & Phil"
5749958,37160780,2015-07-05,32772029,Jigna,This Ballard Retreat was very clean and cozy with comfortable furniture throughout. The notes throughout the house were a nice touch. The highlights were the comfy beds and games in the living room. Great rental to feel right at home! I would definitely return if I'm in the area again. Thanks Alan and Katence!
5749958,38640782,2015-07-17,7078521,Paul,"Alan and Katence were great. Good communication, lots of great relevant information to the local town. Great experience all around"
5749958,39291088,2015-07-22,23970984,Caroline,"Alan and Katence made us feel welcome from the first contact. I live in Idaho and had family from Norway passing thru Seattle. The beautiful phinney ridge home was perfect for the 5 cousins (2 adults, 3 teens). Everyone was very happy to be staying at Alan and Katence's home and not a hotel, the space is prettier than the pictures, spotlessly clean, comfortable furniture, beds and linens.  The location was also perfect for all the popular Seattle sights to see in such a short visit, and was extra special to be so close to Ballard (little Norway) I would highly recommend this home. Thank you so much Alan and Katence, sorry not to meet you! And thank you for your great communication from start to end, happy you and your place are in our happy memories!"
5749958,40204326,2015-07-29,31228257,Jeffrey,"Alan and Katence provided an excellent Seattle experience for my family.  The house is well located in Ballard, near the locks, zoo, and the restaurant areas of both Fremont and Ballard.  There are solid local restaurants and grocery shopping within walking distance of the house.  The layout of the house maximizes space really well and can suitably accomodate a family of four.   The hosts were very responsive to our requests. For example, we were hosting some friends for dinner and we realized that the propane tank in the grill was empty.  A simple text and thirty minutes later the propane tank was filled!  We had a neat experience with a neighbor, when we asked him for directions to a store to buy a nighlight for the kid's room, the guy just gave us a spare one from his own home. Seattle at its best!"
5749958,40610079,2015-08-01,7040741,Bonnie,"We just got back from our stay and LOVED the house! It's the perfect location--a laundromat right around the corner, great pizza and coffee a block away, and tons of great restaurants and grocery stores 2-3 blocks further. Alan and Katence made it very easy to check-in and out, and the house is beautifully furnished and decorated. Also, I've stayed at many rental homes over the years, but this ranks as one of the cleanest I've ever been to. I especially appreciated the anti-allergen covers on all the mattresses and the snowy white linens! The kids loved playing in the front yard and my husband and I enjoyed dessert on the porch every evening after the kids were in bed. Parking was always easy, even when our cousin or friend visited us. We plan to return to Seattle and definitely hope to stay in this charming home again."
5749958,41067659,2015-08-04,28220816,Elli,"We arrived at our Ballard home late(ish), and were SO happy to find 2 bottles of hand picked wine waiting for us (you could just leave $ in exchange).  We stayed there with 4 of us, we have 2 little girls.  The place was just the right size for us, more would have been a bit crowded.  It was perfectly appointed, fans, soft sheets and towels, all the dishes/cooking tools we needed (and we even cooked up a feast after the Ballard market).  It was truly a home away from home- very clean and in perfect condition.  We could walk to everything-- it was the right spot for us, and we can't wait to return!!!  Thank you so much!!!"
5749958,42377976,2015-08-13,29995433,Deborah,"We were exceptionally pleased with our stay in Alan and Katence's home in Ballard.  The house and location were perfect for our needs.  We were in Seattle for our son's wedding which was at the Ballard Hotel only a few minutes away.  

The hosts were gracious and responsive; answering questions and assisting if needed.  The house itself was lovingly cared for and tastefully decorated---a little gem and just the right size for us.  

The layout of the inside was just right too.  Bedrooms in the back were quiet and private and the front kitchen/dining/living area was open and airy--with plenty of room.

The bathroom had essentials like towels and hair dryer and the kitchen was outfitted with plenty of cooking ware, coffee maker, etc. We greatly appreciated these amenities during our 8 day stay since we cooked quite a bit--making several trips up the street to the local Town & Country grocery.  (Tip:  Their fried chicken is very good, my husband quickly discovered.)

In between all of our activities, we relaxed often on the front porch with a glass of wine enjoying a few minutes of quiet.  And good news for anyone from the Midwest or the South---no mosquitoes! 

Aside from the wedding, we also did some sight-seeing and the location of the house provided easy access to main roads for trekking downtown; going to the  Ballard Locks, Seattle Ferries, the Beach and even area farmers markets.  

All in all we had a wonderful trip and are confident that it was made more so because of our stay at the""Beautiful Phinney/Ballard Retreat""!  Thanks so much Alan and Katence!!"
5749958,43221619,2015-08-18,27000981,Weegee,"Alan & Katence were awesome! They were quick to respond to our inquiries regarding the location, home and arrival details.  The accomodations was perfect for our mini-family get together to watch the pre-season game between Broncos and Seahawks. The bus to downtown (28) was literally two blocks away from us and dropped us off two blocks from the stadium.  The location is central to many breweries (Reubans is our new fav) and farmer's markets!  The four of us slept comfortably in the two-bedroom suite . . . and soundly! It was perfect for enjoying some down time while we waited for the occasional rain shower to pass. The kitchen had all the utensils of home -- which helped with our breakfasts in.  Thank you guys for a wonderful stay! "
5749958,44323206,2015-08-25,15824925,Kadie,We really enjoyed staying at Alan and Katence's place.  Thank you so much for having us.  The accommodations were very comfortable and the neighborhood was great!
5749958,44559786,2015-08-27,2287514,Bob,"The house was just as described and very clean and comfortable. It's in a quiet area with road parking right outside the front door. It has a large bedroom with a queen bed and the second bedroom has a double bed. We took the #28 bus which is just around the corner into Seattle and its only  20 mins to downtown. 
"
5749958,45071731,2015-08-31,13564212,Rose,"Great neighborhood, super clean and bright house, we were comfortable and very happy-! "
5749958,45392647,2015-09-02,8611556,Marcia,"Great spot for a quick stay in Seattle. The house was clean, beds were super comfortable and we had everything we needed to cook. There was easy parking out front and we were a quick walk from the main stretch in Ballard. Alan and Katence were super friendly and responsive -- we had a great experience!"
5749958,46657519,2015-09-12,29793212,Lindsay,This house was great all around! Great space and great location. We were traveling with our 8 month old and the house was set up perfectly for a kiddo. We loved it!
5749958,46952799,2015-09-14,29793212,Lindsay,"Great place, great location! We had our 8 month old and felt like the place was perfectly suited for a kiddo. Very simple decorations, comfy, and cute. The hosts were super helpful with recommendations around the area and we look forward to going there again soon!"
5749958,47250782,2015-09-17,30606846,John,"Alan and Katence were very responsive.  We really enjoyed staying in the neighborhood of Ballard.  The home was bright, cheerful and comfortable, and we really enjoyed the gas fireplace with the cool Seattle weather.  The location of the home is close to the convenience of main streets (shops, restaurants, breweries, transportation), but is far enough away to be quiet.  "
5749958,48958363,2015-09-29,31933430,Kimberly,"Absolutely wonderful retreat in Ballard!   Perfectly located if you want to stay in Ballard or easily get to all of Seattle's best neighborhoods.  House is adorable and well appointed and beds are very comfy:) Excellent, responsive hosts!! "
5749958,49698799,2015-10-05,18152119,Matt,"Alan and Katence’s home was the perfect hub for a weekend wedding getaway (a friend’s, not ours ;).

We arrived greeted by fresh flowers and a guide to Ballard. The house is cute, clean and feels like home.

Thanks so much for an easy and relaxing experience. Would love to stay again!"
3732103,17317244,2014-08-10,5460591,Grady,"This place was great. Andrew and his team are still ramping up, but already, the place has some great amenities and an energetic atmosphere. I'm going to call out the comfortable beds (high thread counts, mmm) and the two huge kitchens."
3732103,17655281,2014-08-15,19629980,Georgiy,"I arrived early in Seattle and they were able to check me in well before the check in time which I really appreciated. The room had 2 bunk beds of which only had one person living on top of me so it wasn't crowded at all. The house is well maintained and clean and they provided with a towel, free laundry, wifi and a nice couch to sit while not doing anything.
The location was also great within walking distance to bus and gas works park. 
I enjoyed staying there."
3732103,38048202,2015-07-12,37333092,Whitney,"I loved my time in the house. It was an interesting mix of young people who are motivated and friendly. I would recommend this place highly if you're in your 20's and want to be around a group of smart people. I loved it so much that I came back to the house after I moved out just to hang out! Also- it is an amazing location walking distance to gas works park, easy to get onto I5, and you can see the lake from the house."
3732103,40485476,2015-07-31,29538590,Rachel,"For the two weeks I was here, the house as a whole was a fun place to be. It's filled with people working in various parts of the tech industry, who mostly seem to be there for at least a couple weeks, if not months, so they try to keep up the house and the community. I was sharing a room with three other women, which I knew when I booked it, but you should definitely be aware of - my roommates were all very nice, but you have to be ready to be sharing a room closely. The common areas of the house were well maintained, and I had a good time hanging out and interacting with other residents. I'd recommend this house to anyone looking for a community while they're in Seattle."
3732103,42964749,2015-08-16,2157207,Leena,"Great house captain and owner of house (Paul and Andy, respectively). Super sweet, helpful, open, and willing to work with me. House is full of loving souls who are working hard on their projects. 

What I especially appreciated was the heterogeneous quality of this particular ""startup home."" It's not a hacker home, thank god, so there are more than just IT/web/software/coder dudes there. When I was there, there were Amazon, Google and Microsoft interns, employees from established startups, people starting their own companies, accelerator (Tech Stars) residents, hardware folks, and even a physicist. There was a room for girls/women (occupancy: 4). There were techies and then people like me who are in marketing/business development. The mixed environment lent itself to some very interesting discussions and a free flow of thought, which we all leveraged in our newfound friendships and career connections. Andy even gave me some great VC names to run after who may back my invention.

Some caveats: if living in tight spaces isn't for you, this might not be your best bet. Also tough if you don't own a car, as the nearest grocery store (and attendant bars, restaurants, cafes, etc.) is a one mile hike uphill (carrying groceries over this distance or walking in the rain may prove onerous). Finally, realize that every resident's definition of ""clean"" will vary...and with two bathrooms (soon to be four) and three kitchens used by about 20 people (at capacity), that can be a bit challenging. At present, the house is cleaned once every three weeks. I suggested it be cleaned once a week for so many residents (especially as people keep rotating through and don't feel responsible to keep the place neat, as they know they are leaving shortly)...both Paul and Andy patiently heard my feedback and seemed amenable to improving the cleanliness situation.

Overall, I highly, highly recommend this place to earnest startup folks who want to get involved in the tight-knit upstart community in Seattle. Andy has created a very interesting concept here, which will no doubt keep growing, as it's backbone is a highly-democratized environment conducive to legendary brainstorming sessions, debates and conversations -- not to mention connections."
3732103,45425279,2015-09-02,6446336,Janeth,"I felt welcomed. Everyone was pretty friendly. I stayed for less than a week and was able to get work done as the house is pretty quiet and there is rarely anyone in common areas during the day. My roommate was pretty cool, had good conversations with her. Overall, it was a convenient for my time being. "
9436832,54940803,2015-11-25,12285229,Colin,Elena's place made my stay in Seattle even more amazing. It's conveniently located in a vibrant neighborhood with plenty of places to eat and drink. The apartment itself is very thoughtfully arranged. I found everything I need and surprises on things I didn't expect. Would highly recommend it to anyone and i'll definitely staying here again next time. 
9436832,55088616,2015-11-27,258932,Ryan,This place was a delight with well appointed character.  Elena was great on communication.  A bargain for the location and style.
9436832,55301939,2015-11-29,2807770,Katia,"The host is very professional and I had a great experience. Room and bathroom is well stocked and accessorized.
"
9436832,55335952,2015-11-29,3965382,Heather,"What a lovely quaint space in HillTop. I asked Elena on 11am on a Saturday and by Noon I was booked with her place, as well as all the necessary instructions for entry. Additionally Elena went above and beyond and reserved a parking spot just a few blocks from her place which was very handy as it's hard to find parking in that area. Elena has the place stocked with all the essentials. The full size bed was super comfortable; even for 2. :D The unit was very clean and inviting. I'd love to stay again when I'm next in Seattle area. "
9436832,55853481,2015-12-06,19873631,Autumn,A nice little place in a great location! Elena made everything very easy for us. 
9436832,55985258,2015-12-07,5434678,Nicole,"Elena's apartment was very clean and comfortable. I was super happy with how close it was to shops, restaurants and nightlife. All the amenities provided were plenty and smelled delicious and the assortment of teas was also wonderful. Elena was really easy to communicate with and kind. If I'm looking for a place to stay in Capitol Hill I'll likely try to book this apartment again. "
9436832,56102311,2015-12-08,46194015,Sean,"Clean and cozy, really enjoyed our stay here!"
9436832,56345015,2015-12-12,48772907,Jj,Fantastic experience. Well located cool apartment!
9436832,56529076,2015-12-14,6358826,Jason,Great neighborhood! Elena was awesome and was very responsive to all of my questions. I would definitely stay here again when I come back!!
9436832,56693261,2015-12-16,35519775,Sarah,"Elena's studio apartment was beautiful and in a great location. Although it is a studio and is somewhat small there is everything you need in the apartment including a full kitchen and a large closet for hiding luggage. The bed was so comfortable I wanted to sleep all day! The bathroom was very very well stocked with boutique shampoo and conditioners fancy soaps and really good hair dryer and straightener available for use! The apartment was well heated and the kitchen had a huge selection of gourmet teas! I used the washer dryer located in the basement which was coin operated and Elena had detergent in the apartment available for a small fee. She also provided a parking spot next door for a small fee which was so convenient! I would absolutely stay here again for the amazing location. The only drawback was the noise. Sometimes planes could be heard overhead or neighbors conversations from other units. It did not keep me from falling asleep though and still for the price and location it is unbeatable! 
Elena was available instantly by text and the instructions she provided were perfect! She even recommended a local Packer bar for me and my boyfriend to watch our favorite team as soon as we landed in Seattle! "
1737244,28220337,2015-03-20,28479565,Michael,"I had a great time staying with Constance. She's very friendly, thoughtful and overall made me feel very welcome in her home. The room was quiet, comfortable and just as described in her ad. The location is great, and I have no reservations recommending to stay here. I would stay here again."
1737244,28766625,2015-03-29,19662541,Ansuya,"Constance is a wonderful host. She made me feel very welcome in her beautiful home. The room and shares bathroom were both clean and neat. 

Constance will make sure that your every need is met. I recommend this place to anyone. "
1737244,31600116,2015-05-07,28233700,Alexander,She was great and really helpful. The house was beautiful. 
1737244,32436704,2015-05-17,30259317,Jillian,"The description and pictures of Constance's house could not be more perfect. ""A warm retreat"" is exactly what I experienced! Constance could not get any sweeter. She will welcome you with open arms but not be the kind of lingering host that doesn't give you your privacy!"
1737244,34797071,2015-06-12,33617605,Yue,"Constance was a great host. The house was wonderful and the room I was in was exactly as pictured. It is indeed a gorgeous place. Constance was very kind and kept a wonderful garden. She actually picked flowers from the garden to decorate the room when I arrived.
Very happy to stay with her during my visit to Seattle. The community is quite and safe, with easy access to bike trials and bus stops that will bring you to downtown, to the university or to Northgate and Fremont.  "
1737244,35180045,2015-06-15,954422,Rohit,"Very friendly and welcoming. Cosy property, comfortable bed. Convenient walk to local shops. A very enjoyable stay."
1737244,39024557,2015-07-20,4184747,Jean,Constance was great and extremely welcoming. We stayed at her place for almost a month. We loved her home and the bedroom we stayed in. Her dog Noah is quiet and very friendly. We had no problems at all!
1737244,40136623,2015-07-28,31623267,Kate,"Lovely home! Constance wasn't in town, so her friend greeted us and was around during our stay. We enjoyed our very clean room and bathroom. The house manual was appreciated. The house is a bit of a ride from downtown, but the buses are close and easy to figure out. "
1737244,43642323,2015-08-21,35101728,Nicholas,"This home is in a nice, quiet neighborhood. I really enjoyed staying here. Constance is such a warm and hospitable host. Shes very kind and inviting. The bed here is on the firmer side, which I like. The garden in the back yard is great for getting work done or just relaxing. This place is a great Airbnb deal!!"
1737244,47189364,2015-09-16,5635394,Michael,"Staying with Constance and her cute Havanese Noah for a week was a  absolutely wonderful experience! I recently moved to Seattle and was looking for a temporary home away from home. Constance's apartment is exactly that. The place is a bit far away from downtown, but the beautiful apartment with its homely patio definitely makes up for that. Constance is a very fun, generous and kind hearted person that is very easy to live with. I would definitely stay here again and highly recommend this place."
1737244,50690993,2015-10-13,21408894,Kira,"Contance was a great host. So much so that I wasn't feeling 100% and she offered me healthy drinks to help me feel better. She also provides nice space for your things in the bathroom and kitchen, and great closet space. Easy access to Met Market and direct bus to UW. If you are here to explore Seattle or attend UW, Constance's place is a lovely place to rest and recharge. "
3076065,24728738,2015-01-02,23270786,Ben,"Had a wonderful time staying at Michaels place in a neighborhood that proved to be easily walkable and extremely enjoyable. Mike's apartment was as listed, great space for family and friends to gather for dinner and enjoy the holidays together. Easily slept 5, was very close to tons of great night life in ballard and had great transit to downtown seattle via uber and the nearby bus lines. Buying groceries from the markets was great for when we felt like staying in and watching football. A great space and a great neighborhood. Mike was easy to work with and readily acceptable. "
3076065,27355606,2015-03-02,27811240,Rupa,"We had a fabulous time staying at Mike's house in Seattle! The house is very conveniently located in Ballard, and is a short walk to many great restaurants and bars. It is also very close to the supermarket. When we arrived, Mike gave us great suggestions about what to do and see during our time in Seattle. Overall, the house was very clean, and was great for two couples. The kitchen was well equipped, and the living room was a comfortable place for us to hang out when we wanted to relax. The fireplace made the house especially cozy. Mike was flexible with our arrival and departure times, and he was easy to get in touch with. We would definitely stay there again!"
3076065,28084984,2015-03-17,10506327,Ryli,The place was great and easy hassle free checking in. They had great amenities and the house was in a great location.
3076065,29277353,2015-04-06,8739036,Carl,"Nice quiet neighborhood.  Mike communicates well in getting check-in instructions, and house instructions.  The Foodie paradise is as described--clean and fresh.   

Parking can be a challenge in this neighborhood.  Plan for the possibility of needing to park more than a block away. "
3076065,29702441,2015-04-11,30438393,Sapnesh,The house was great.  Great location.  The facilities the kitchen are all top class.  We had a great trip.
3076065,33093381,2015-05-25,1970384,Kathy,"Mike was easy to communicate with and his home is lovely and very comfortable. We slept well and enjoyed the coffee he left for us. We enjoyed the fire pit and he was more than gracious with me and my mistake with it. It is not an edge burning one like I thought it was. Although parking is ""ample"" it is not always available close by. The home is close to shops and dining. We did more than our fare share of walking - loved Pike Place and enjoyed our stop at Number 6 Cider on our way back! I need to note that for those guests who are not used to being near a large city, there is a small group of homeless people that congregate a couple of blocks away. They were very quiet and neat and did not cause us concern. My son and I were exploring cities for him post-graduation. Seattle came out on top, so I may be staying here again when my husband and I come out to visit him. "
3076065,35200104,2015-06-16,13325440,Mina,"This was a perfect place for my family to stay during my wedding in Seattle. Everything was as described, and conveniently located. Would definitely stay here again. "
3076065,39014144,2015-07-20,2730157,Caitlin,"Great home - beautiful and just as pictures show, in a nice neighborhood in NW Seattle with lots to do nearby. Michael made communicating before and after the trip simple and easy. Would highly recommend! "
3076065,40193900,2015-07-29,25855747,Debbie,"Foodie Paradise was all it was described to be.  We two couples found there was plenty of space for relaxing when we were done for the day and the bedrooms and baths were comfortable and clean.  The kitchen was well stocked with all utensils and condiments needed for our occasional meals eaten at home.  The fireplace was wonderful when it grew cool.  We enjoyed the patio during all hours and the fire pit set the mood on a cool evening.  The neighborhood is very walkable, with numerous restaurants and pubs nearby.  The Ballard Farmer's Market was a must visit.  Parking can be a challenge, but we managed to park right at the location or a block away at the most.  It is suggested that Uber or public transportation be utilized if going downtown.  Our host was gracious and prompt in communicating when I had any questions."
3076065,41398708,2015-08-07,4495330,Nicola,Tue house si really lovely. Clean and noiseless. Also the area si cool. A bit far frombola downtown but surely charming (and there are many bus very near). It si a great choice!
3076065,42613896,2015-08-14,40717968,Emily,"Michael's house was immaculate and comfortable. It felt very private, but was in close proximity to numerous restaurants, shops and coffee houses. We were able to take a shuttle from the airport to this location and walk everywhere we wanted to go, which saved us the hassle and expense of a rental car. The neighborhood felt safe and everyone we encountered was extremely friendly. Several times during our stay, Michael made us feel at home by sending us helpful messages. As we have family in the area and plan to visit frequently, we will wholeheartedly recommend this house to our family and would love to stay there again in the future."
3076065,43069383,2015-08-17,2946873,Emily,This house was absolutely beautiful and felt extremely comfortable and clean for our stay. It's a little further from town but we loved exploring the nearby neighborhoods of Ballard and Freemont. It's about a $14 uber/lyft drive from downtown Seattle/Capitol Hill. We loved the firepit and the outdoor patio. Everything was lovely and would recommend this for a comfortable stay in Seattle! 
3076065,45105049,2015-08-31,32916770,Estalyn,We loved this place!  We would definitely recommend this host and the accommodations and would stay here again next time we go to Seattle.  
3076065,46114215,2015-09-08,29311508,Denise,"The listing was accurate, great place to stay! Very quiet and clean with detailed guide for ammenities in house.  All furnishings and linens were high quality and lots of space indoors and outdoors to relax and entertain."
3076065,47702726,2015-09-21,30014329,Susan Vig,"Great neighborhood, accurate info on house and how to make it work best. Beautiful outdoor fire pit. Quiet home. Super clean and organized.  Would rent this place again. 
"
2755730,13055461,2014-05-18,9474686,Charlie,"Donna was a very gracious host and the apartment was functional and cozy. It's not a fancy place, but it's clean and reasonably charming. There was coffee and toiletries awaiting me -- both thoughtful touches. Best of all, location is one of the finest in Seattle for a traveler, being just a couple of blocks from the heart of Fremont. The (somewhat tight) off-street parking made this a great deal. "
2755730,13290766,2014-05-24,6328149,Jo,"Donna was an awesome host and the apartment was great! Comfortable bedrooms, laundry, full kitchen, spacious and light living room and an awesome deck with a very comfy seat to fall asleep in the afternoon sun in. 
Donna was super friendly, communicated clearly and quickly and welcomed us well. We had complete privacy the whole time we stayed, but that's not to say Donna wasn't there to help when we needed anything.
The neighbourhood was super cool - you're around the corner from the famous Fremont Troll, sculpted by some hippies back in the day.. the Sunday market just a short walk away was full of neat and cheap curiosities, delicious food and coffee, and heaps of old clothes. Lots of tasty cafes and restaurants and happening bars nearby, plus a tailor, hairdresser, Fedex office, record store etc."
2755730,13330367,2014-05-25,8401536,Angela,"Donna was a swift communicator with a comfortable place in a GREAT location/neighborhood! There were quite a few of us, 5 adults and two kids, and we were more than comfy in the two bedroom/sofa bed accommodations. I will definitely keep her spot in Fremont in mind the next time I'm in Seattle! "
2755730,13459336,2014-05-27,5041916,Gwyn & Libby,"Beautiful, peaceful and spacious place in an amazing location! We really enjoyed having the freedom of our own space with everything we could need (including laundry and a parking spot!) while still being within short walking distance to the  downtown Fremont area with lots of restaurants, a local coop grocery store, gelato, coffee, the famous Troll, and various waterfronts along Lake Union! It's also an easy walk to Gas Works Park (this place would be awesome for the 4th of July!). Donna was a great host - responsive and helpful but also gave us our privacy! We'd definitely stay here again."
2755730,13699443,2014-06-02,7459,Nadine,"Donna's home is perfect for a Seattle stay. Located in a great walkable neighborhood, the house, although near a busy bridge, was extremely quiet and actually convenient for us given that it makes for a quick and easy ride into town (less than 10 minutes!). The apartment with two bedrooms worked for  great for our little family. Everything seemed recently renovated with tasteful interior furnishings and lots or great art and travel books. Donna also provided helpful local information and communicated well to coordinate our arrival. 
The balcony with evening sun was a plus and a nice dinner spot for two. The kitchen also provides an eating counter for two. It becomes a bit challenging to eat in the house if you are more than two. (Eat out if you can - great places to eat are all around). The low living room table works somewhat but a small round dining table with 3 or 4 chairs would be ideal to add.  The owners live upstairs in the house.  

"
2755730,13926038,2014-06-08,5920207,Paul,"Donna's apartment provided a comfortable home spot for us to explore the area. The apartment is spacious, clean, with a number of artistic elements. She provided tea, coffee and beverages. We loved the chair hammock on the front deck. Donna was thoughtful in her furnishings, from the bathrooms and beds to the kitchen. We were wanting for naught!

The neighborhood itself is quite spectacular. We have been to Seattle a number of times and stayed downtown. The Fremont neighborhood is a beautiful, friendly area with a number of unique local businesses. We were content exploring Fremont and UW by foot as there was a lot to see and do.

We will definitely be back!"
2755730,14928147,2014-06-29,16654659,Jaime,"We had a great stay at Donna's place. It was extremely comfortable, clean and enough room for our family of 5. It's walking distance to all of Fremont. We would love to stay there again! Thank you, Donna for your hospitality! Jaime"
2755730,15454246,2014-07-09,15683063,Briana,"Donna's place in Fremont was amazing!! My roommates and I just came back from a long trip where we visited lots of different cities and stayed in many different Air BnB's and Donna's place stood out for all of us as being the absolute best one. The location is wonderful, with lots of places to eat and lots of sights to see around it (our favorite was Gasworks Park). The apartment itself is very spacious and so clean- we were pleasantly surprised because we did not expect such a great place at such an affordable price! We felt so comfortable there and were very sad to leave! Donna was great at communicating and responding to questions quickly. Although we did not get to meet in person she seemed very kind. Definitely a great place to stay! "
2755730,15651125,2014-07-13,9811579,Dulaan,"We really enjoyed out stay and loved the location (walking distance to gasworks park, Burke gilman trail and Fremont shopping area). Off street parking is easy and there is a parking pass you can use if you need to park around Fremont area. You can tell that Donna put a lot of thought in creating a warm and inviting space. Donna responded quickly to questions and was very sweet. "
2755730,15760456,2014-07-15,15545180,Naurry,"The location was fantastic - so close to the heart of Fremont with lots of bars and restaurants. While we never met Donna, she was very responsive and her apartment was a wonderful home away from home."
2755730,15962304,2014-07-19,429936,Mary,The apartment was extremely clean and decorated very nice.  There were four of us and the apartment had all the amenities of home.  I exchanged messages with Donna and she responded immediately.  The Fremont neighborhood was great for restaurants and bars.  I highly recommend this apartment for anybody traveling to the Seattle area.  
2755730,16663273,2014-07-31,8954491,Jennifer,"We throughly enjoyed staying at Donna and Jes's place. The place was very clean and roomy. We felt comfortable and at home. Donna and Jes were accessible, but also respected our privacy. They were great hosts! "
2755730,16980622,2014-08-05,15871360,Karen,"The place was nice and clean and quiet.  Donna and Jes were pleasant when we had a small problem to deal with which was resolved quickly and without much stress.  It is a good spot to come to if you need accommodations for a small party and will not be doing entertaining for large groups of people.  It is located in a really nice neighborhood and you're able to walk to many amenities without having to drive or find parking.
The unit itself was neat and clean with nice decor and a friendly feel.  The beds were comfortable and the bathroom was large and easy to use.  The kitchen was full use and un-cramped.  
I could tell that Donna and Jes took pride in creating this lovely space that they rent and share with others.  It shows in the craftsmanship and the quality of the details in the unit itself."
2755730,18083701,2014-08-21,6727391,Maja,"My friends and I were very happy with our experience at Donna and Jes's place. When we arrived, there was a welcome binder there for us with information about the place and suggestions for grocery stores, restaurants, pubs etc. They we're very kind to leave us with a lot of information and brochures about the area, Seattle and activities going on around the city!

Their place was very beautiful and extremely clean. It was also very near a main street with plenty of boutiques and restaurants. The neighbourhood was very nice and artsy and we really enjoyed walking around and exploring the area. 

We met Jes and she was very kind and welcoming. Communication was easy and she was readily available when we had questions. 

I highly recommend Donna and Jes's place. We thoroughly enjoyed our visit!"
2755730,18875489,2014-09-02,16094960,Svetlana,"Great little place, just as described and pictured, in a great neighborhood, and quiet at night. The place was spacious enough to comfortably fit 3 couples (i.e. sharing beds) or 4 single people (the couch splits up into two thin mattress halves in a pinch), and all amenities were provided (bathroom essentials, cooking utensils, fridge, microwave, dishwasher, laundry, street parking pass, wifi). Host was vary gracious, offered us extra sheets/pillows when needed. This was our first AirBnB experience and it was fantastic! I would definitely stay again. =) Thank you!! "
2755730,19206424,2014-09-08,18739187,Carolina,"My husband and I and our mothers came to Seattle to visit family. 

The house is on a shady tree lined street. The beds were comfortable and the entire place was clean with all the amenities.  We cooked a few meals there and were impressed at all the kitchen supplies that were there.  We had coffee in the morning on the outside deck and took turns sitting on the hanging chair which is super comfortable. 

Donna and Jes are quick to respond and great hosts. We would stay here again! They had a binder with lots of helpful information of the area. Short walk to a great neighborhood with fun shopping and cool restaurants and bars. "
2755730,19457918,2014-09-13,5359456,John,"The 2 bedroom home is actually more like a two-bedroom apartment, as the owners have converted their downstairs into an independent unit and they live upstairs. We didn't actually get to see the owners or talk to them, which was pretty clearly the intention and a little weird from my other AirBnB experiences, but the apartment was clean and comfortable and spacious enough for two people. The bathroom is very nice, great shower! The kitchen is nicely furnished, too. We missed having an ironing board and iron but that's ok. The wifi worked very well. 
The best part for us was definitely the location: we LOVED the Fremont neighborhood and immediately felt right at home. In fact, after a day's sightseeing or errand-running, it was a real joy to get back into the ""Center of the Universe""! 
There are great coffee shops, fine restaurants within a block or two, great places for a drink, even a place that only sells home-made cakes (yum!). I took nice long walks along the waterfront, and the bus system worked well to get us around and into downtown or wherever. 
Beware however that buying normal groceries nearby is almost impossible if you don't have a car, because except for a really expensive ecological store, there isn't even a convenience store anywhere nearby. "
2755730,19693177,2014-09-16,20466570,Donna,"We loved the apartment. The location and our stay. The apartment was spacious, clean and comfortable. The location was incredible.  Loved the running/bike path close by, Troll Avenue "
2755730,19856821,2014-09-19,11843336,Maria,"Very clean, easy to get the keys. The neighbourhood is great. 
I was on a business trip and it was a very convenient experience overall!
Thanks Donna!

"
2755730,22288676,2014-11-03,3474804,Evan,"I very much enjoyed staying in this lovely two bedroom apartment in the center of Fremont, and highly recommend it to anyone considering staying in Seattle, especially 

I stayed in the apartment for six weeks with a roommate, and really have no complaints. The kitchen is very large and well-stocked with all-new appliances. The living room is comfortable, with a great fully-functional fireplace and a big TV. The deck is fantastic for when it is sunny outside (which did occasionally happen while we were there). The bathroom is large, and the shower has good water pressure and heats up quickly. The bedrooms are on the small side, with the second bedroom being notably smaller than the first.

Although the apartment is on the first floor, it is elevated well-above street level, so it feels much more private than one might initially think. Even though they were around, I only rarely heard Donna or Jes walking around upstairs, so the floors must be well-insulated against noise.

Donna and Jes were warm, responsive hosts who mostly kept to themselves but were there whenever we had questions or concerns. They also provided starter amenities, such as clean sponges, dish soap, and shower toiletries, which I found very considerate. They also provided a parking pass if you bring your car.

The apartment is a very short walk (1.5 blocks) to downtown Fremont, with easy access to all of the restaurants you could ever want, plus ample public transportation. Fremont Brewery is only a block away! "
2755730,22704361,2014-11-12,22456481,Katherine,"Fantastically located right around the corner from the Fremont Troll that our kids returned to every day of our stay for a game of hide-and-seek. Loved it. The appartment was just as described with everything and more than we needed for 3 adults and 2 kids. Cosy, homely, lovely design elements in the furniture and decor, great picture and photo book selection even for the kids. Really well stocked kitched with lots of utensils and quality appliances. Including a fantastic and huge gas stove :) And the location just got better as we walked to the shops,  daily coffee shop visits to a new place each day, and the market (even our 2.5 and almost 5 year old walked everywhere) and literally 2 mins around the corner was the Fremont Brewery to keep my brewer husband very happy. A great stay and lovely personal touch of meeting Jes and their dog Bessie which the kids really loved. Parking was only tricky on the Saturday late afternoon we arrived but quickly unloaded around the back of the house and drove to dinner and upon returning the parking was not an issue for the rest if our stay :) Highly recommend for short or longer stays."
2755730,22908488,2014-11-17,1126111,Tracy,I totally enjoyed my visit and stay in Donna and Jes' place! The Fremont district of Seattle is so beautiful.  The place was perfect.  Perfect location as well!  Parked the car and never got back in.  Walked everywhere we needed to go.  I will definitely be back. :)
2755730,23382627,2014-11-30,23163650,Ann,"The apartment was just as it was described--clean, cozy and very comfortable! Plenty of room for 4 of us. Donna and Jes were great, and let us know they were available if we needed anything or had any issues. Having a full kitchen available to us was really fantastic, there is nothing better than having morning coffee in front of a fire in the woodstove! Donna & Jes's place is located in a quiet neighborhood and parking was very easy to find. We found lots of great restaurants and shops just a short walk away, as well as a very nice organic market. All in all a great experience that absolutely exceeded our expectations. We will definitely stay here the next time we're in Seattle!"
2755730,23993671,2014-12-16,22820855,Ryan,Quaint place with a primo Fremont location. Very welcoming and accommodating host. Great experience overall! 
2755730,25315879,2015-01-12,8034639,Tiffany,"Thank you Donna and Jes for making our stay in Seattle so cozy and accomodating! Our stay was not only perfect but most importantly it was filled with hospitality. We had a large group of 7 girls flying in from different cities to celebrate a friend's birthday. From start to finish Donna and Jes were very communicative and approachable to all my questions, concerns and need for detail as I needed an earlier check in and throughout our stay we had questions. Most of all, when traveling with seven, we needed flexibility and Donna and Jes went above and beyond. It was perfect that we had our own separate door yet also had access to reach out to Donna & Jes as they live upstairs.

Onto the lodging and home. It was exactly as the photos show. Clean, cute and cozy. There was a night where we wanted more warmth and Donna came down to give us space heaters and even gave us some logs for the furnace (this was in addition to a functioning heater- we are so So Cal!). The rooms were clean, simple and spacious.. The couch folds out into a large bed that comfortably fits two. 

Location wise it was the perfect walking distance to cute shops, vintage stores, coffee shops and even a stellar grocery store (beats Whole Foods!). Not to mention you can grab tasty pies, rootbeer floats and authentic Thai all within the area. Another convenience is the nearby connnection over the bridge into the city. It took us 10-15 minutes max to get there. 

I would totally stay here again and I want thank Donna and Jes for their amazing kindness! 

Tiffany "
2755730,25657415,2015-01-22,12428287,Owen,"Great apartment -- it was spacious, well appointed, stylish, and comfortable. The location was a prime spot in Fremont near restaurants and bars. I'd definitely stay here again."
2755730,25965710,2015-01-31,4017395,Danny,"I hope that I get the chance to stay with Donna and Jes on *every* future trip I take to Seattle.

Not only were they perfectly located a block from a top-notch coffee shop with the world's friendliest baristas, but the apartment was pretty much everything I ever look for in accommodations, and my hosts went out of their way to make me feel welcome.

The highlights: 
* lockbox entry so I can arrive late without bothering them;
* a tastefully furnished and decorated apartment spotlessly clean and free of clutter;
* all the toiletries I could possibly need, including even q-tips and a travel toothbrush/toothpaste combo;
* soft, new linens, towels, bath rug, and bedroom carpet;
* heat on and comfortable before I arrive;
* and last but by no means least, a fresh growler of Pale Ale from local gem Fremont Brewery waiting for me in the fridge."
2755730,26311936,2015-02-09,21788172,Yogi Surya,"Hosts where great, just perfect mix of support and privacy. Place was just as described and immaculately clean and organized. we never wanted to leave!! would come back to this spot for sure!"
2755730,26987024,2015-02-23,9685174,Maya,"Donna and Jes have a beautiful, clean and well furnished home in a great neighborhood!  We stayed with 5 people, and had a great time exploring the Fremont neighborhood on foot.  Quiet with comfy beds, nice sheets, well equipped kitchen and a small deck for welcoming the morning. A few very tasteful decorations and art book collection made the place feel more homey.  Will definitely be back the next time we visit Seattle!"
2755730,27629676,2015-03-08,28768125,Michelle,"We had such a lovely stay! The location was excellent--totally walkable to the troll, the shops and restaurants. The house is clean and cute with thoughtful details like art books and even a fun selection of children's books. It was very comfortable for our family of five. Jes and Donna were incredibly helpful and quick to respond to any questions I had. We will definitely stay here again!"
2755730,28001898,2015-03-16,15399856,Jesse,"Great place, great neighborhood.  Hosts were out of town while I was there, but we had no issues and it was easy to check in and out.  Would highly recommend this place."
2755730,28218451,2015-03-20,21079707,Kelly,"
Donna and Jes were great hosts.  They had a complete welcome guide with neighborhood and city information (including a parking pass, which is critical for the neighborhood).  They texted to ensure we got in ok and were quick to respond to any inquiries!  The apartment was clean, the beds were comfortable, and the location was great! "
2755730,28383650,2015-03-23,26028621,Kelsey,We had a great time! Good location and comfy beds!

2755730,28682299,2015-03-28,23719787,Rebecca,"We had such an amazing time staying at Donna and Jes' place in the lovely Fremont neighborhood! The space was beautiful, very private, and close to so many things. Donna was a very gracious host, making sure all of our questions about Seattle and her neighborhood were answered. One of my favorite moments was sitting on the hammock on the sunny porch after a day of sight seeing. =)"
2755730,28997289,2015-04-02,28473855,Patrick,"Great place in a perfect central location. Our time there was packed, so we didn't actually get to meet Donna or Jes, but we kept in touch via text messages just fine."
2755730,29301762,2015-04-06,4540022,Sarah,"We rented this lovely apartment for a ladies' weekend in Seattle and it was just perfect.  This place is even cuter than in the photos and the neighborhood is amazing.  Just a short walk away is PCC Market with an incredible selection of organic groceries, and there are SO many bars and restaurants to choose from in Fremont.  Check in and out was very easy and Donna and Jes were great hosts.  Wonderful weekend in Seattle all around!! "
2755730,29571357,2015-04-09,3188802,Kaitlin,"This place was so cute and comfortable! Loved all the books and furniture, and the location! The location is fantastic. Great little bars down the road if you didn't want to hop in the car and drive to the Hill. Easy access to the apartment upon arrival and when I had a question or concern, a text worked great! I'd definitely stay here again. "
2755730,30378041,2015-04-21,26105690,Zach,"House was extremely clean and neat with comfortable beds and a great kitchen. Enjoyed being on the porch every morning. Perfect location--easy walk to restaurants, bars, and shops. Hosts were incredibly hospitable and were very enjoyable to work with. 10/10 rating, five stars, two thumbs up! "
2755730,30574378,2015-04-24,690307,Solomon,"The place was great!  Right in the heart of Fremont, yet a cosy welcoming house.  Everything in the house was well thought out, orderly and clean.  We'll definitely stay again the next time we're in town!"
2755730,30883250,2015-04-28,16831156,Robert,"The location was perfect, but what really impressed us was how clean and 'hotel-like' the apartment was.  Towels were folded and ready in the bathroom, the fridge was clean safe for a few local beers provided as a welcoming gift (a very nice touch).  My wife and I stayed there with two small children and my parents, and the space was great.  A final note: The hosts go above and beyond to be helpful.  We accidentally left a bag behind when we left, and they were willing to ship it to us to make sure we got all of our belongings back.  A great experience, we would definitely stay there again!"
2755730,31369344,2015-05-04,6794529,Megan,I loved that there was a nice selection of tea- and the space is very clean and minimally but tastefully decorated.
2755730,31958867,2015-05-12,30985674,Maya,I spent a birthday weekend with Donna and Jes and simply have to say that everything was amazing! This location could not be beat for any sightseeing you wish to do in Fremont and although I didn't end up using public transportation to go downtown there was plenty of it nearby! Everything you could ask for and more was found in this house. The beds were comfortable and this place is clean and well decorated of it's something you are into! There is a ton of really cool books to read although frankly I didn't get much time! The small balcony was a great place to have morning coffee! The only problem I can for see someone encountering would be that this is a busy street to park on because of the troll nearby however spots also come and go fast! Overall I would for sure stay here again if I was ever in seattle! 
2755730,33255955,2015-05-26,15835462,Johnny,"Donna and Jes were fantastic hosts - extremely responsive, flexible, and great to chat with.  The place is exactly as pictured - spotless, well organized, and a great location to explore all areas of Seattle.  Highly recommended!"
2755730,33922018,2015-06-02,3818172,Javier,"We had a very pleasant stay, with the unit being ample, extremely clean and well stocked with the necessities and more. The location is extremely handy, so close to lively restos, pubs and the water in Fremont neighborhood and very handy to go into downtown Seattle from there, a few minutes' drive away. We highly recommend a stay !"
2755730,35071449,2015-06-15,28481612,Craig,"Awesome!
Perfect hosts and a Perfect spot for our trip!
Thanks

2755730,35391339,2015-06-18,1241201,Liliani,"We have a wonderful stay at Donna and Jes 's apartment. Everything work out perfectly, quite hard to find parking in front of the house but the parking pass worked out well. The house is clean and close to many shops and food around. Will be back in the future. "
2755730,36504809,2015-06-29,6253103,Mike,"Donna and Jes had a beautiful home, and it's in a great part of Seattle. They listed a bunch of their favorite areas nearby for food, drinks, and coffee. If we had questions about things they were very prompts in responding and clearly were there to help make our stay enjoyable, highly recommend staying with them. "
2755730,36865427,2015-07-02,29932895,Stephanie,"The space was sweet, clean and comfortable. The location was perfect - so much within walking distance. Donna was helpful and responsive. "
2755730,37736291,2015-07-10,973141,Ilene,"While we didn't get to meet either Donna or Jes, the instructions were clear and effective. The apartment was clean and as expected and we enjoyed our stay. I love the vibe of Fremont! I stayed with a group of 4 adults and 2 children and it fit us perfectly. I would definitely consider staying here again with a larger group."
2755730,37940499,2015-07-12,25465412,Milo,"Both house and neighborhood were great; quiet, yet within walking distance of amazing downtown Fremont and restaurants. The home is immaculate, with obvious attention paid to details. Donna's and Jes's home was meant to be nothing more than a starting point to our trip; instead, it was a pleasurable highlight."
2755730,38378942,2015-07-15,31233369,Jodi,"We had a great time at Donna and Jes's Fremont listing.  The place was clean and well- maintained.  Fremont is a fun, funky, eclectic neighborhood- lots of things within walking distance.  There was a minor issue with getting into the apartment- the code was different than what was listed on the airbnb website, but it was quickly remedied and no problems at all after that.  We would stay again!!"
2755730,39261443,2015-07-22,23741716,Diana,We had a wonderful time .. The place was in a perfect location... Close to public transportation and a short walk to many delicious places to eat.   I would  stay here again and again.... LOVED SEATTLE .... Thank you Donna and Jes 
2755730,39911132,2015-07-27,30085390,Yee-Horn,"The place is located at a pretty quiet residential area. It is nicely decorated and stocked with all the amenities. We found nice restaurants and markets in walking distance. The only less than satisfactory thing is the parking. Our family of 5 had 2 cars. Donna was nice enough to squeeze her and her neighbor's cars to make room for one of ours in their private parking lot in the back alley. However, due to the tree fence in the alley that it took us more than 3 minutes just to get into the space and 6 minutes just to get out of the space. We ended up using only one car to go around. However, some times it would take some driving around to find a parking spot."
2755730,40336751,2015-07-30,35662856,Lisa,"Donna and Jes kept in touch through email. Sent a welcoming message along with their phone# if I had any questions or concerns after arriving. Apartment was as advertised. Clean, comfortable and well stocked with everything we needed. Great location!"
2755730,40709669,2015-08-02,17795448,Sun,"Great place. Good location. Very clean.
Donna and Jes are easy to communicate. Would recommend this place."
2755730,41412736,2015-08-07,37784360,Krissa,"This was my first Airbnb experience, and I must say that Donna and Jes set the bar quite high. The place was spacious, clean, and had everything we needed (cooking supplies, towels, hair dryer, etc.). The location is perfect as well!!! We were a walk away from restaurants, bars, shopping as well as a beautiful park and other tourist areas. It was so convenient to downtown activities. The communication of the hosts was amazing! They even went as far as messaging me before I got into town to let me know that traffic may be dense because of a naval festival. We appreciate the hospitality and thoughtfulness that Donna and Jes have gone through to provide us a comfortable stay in their home! We recommend this place 110%!!! "
2755730,41923092,2015-08-10,29737643,Linda,"This was our first Airbnb experience, and we were very satisfied. We met Donna and she made us feel welcome, like this was our home for a few days. The space was even better than we expected - spacious, clean, well-appointed and convenient. We would definitely consider staying here again."
2755730,42437592,2015-08-13,6792386,Cassandra,"Donna & Jes were great hosts!  It's obvious they do this on the regular, everything was very professional.  I loved the binder they had with details about the house as well as things to do in the neighborhood.  The house was very clean and decorated nicely.  Fremont is AMAZING!!!!  So many great breweries, bars and restaurants all within walking distance.  "
2755730,43476960,2015-08-20,4622887,Marisa,"Loved this place. It's super clean and comfortable. Perhaps best of all it's located in Fremont, a great neighborhood that's in the center of things. Big plus: a popular city bus stops near the front door.  Private. Convienent. We give it a 10!"
2755730,44094363,2015-08-24,24046804,Sam,"Great location, very clean, and would definitely stay again!"
2755730,44709575,2015-08-28,9176705,Lindsay,"This apartment was gorgeous! Donna and Jes were there if we needed, but also gave us our privacy. Beautiful, clean apartment with all the necessary amenities. We sat on the front balcony one evening at sunset; it was gorgeous. Really great apartment, beautifully furnished and decorated, with all the amenities you could ask for. I'd stay here again in a heartbeat!"
2755730,45419610,2015-09-02,16101640,Brian,No problems at all - they are great and have a nice place to stay.  I will try to book this next time I'm in Seattle. Definitely recommend!
2755730,46265239,2015-09-09,32231427,Kevin,Fantastic location and wonderful place.  Everything was perfect.  I would definitely recommend it.
2755730,46666439,2015-09-12,22116550,Sarah & Michaela,"Donna and Jes' place couldn't have been better. It was walking distance to cool coffee shops, breweries, and nice restaurants. They left us a parking pass in a helpful welcome binder. The whole experience was really easy!"
2755730,47364089,2015-09-18,10435121,Ian,"We enjoyed out stay, everything was really clean and comfortable. Lots of art books to peruse. Great neighborhood with direct access to everything Fremont has to offer. Definitely recommend staying here."
2755730,47991152,2015-09-22,19345901,Stacie E.,"We had an amazing family holiday at Donna and Jes' place. It was immaculate, beautifully decorated, and conveniently located. They also went the extra little bit to make our stay enjoyable by providing information and advice on attractions. Donna was also great at communicating with us and making sure we had everything we needed. They also have lots of fun art books to thumb through. :) We felt very comfortable and at home! I would definitely recommend staying here to fellow travelers.  "
2755730,48405296,2015-09-26,21985113,Elliot,"Donna and Jes had a great home in great location. My family seemed to enjoy their stay there!  Despite being a pretty small space (especially for 4 guests), things were well appointed and everybody had what they needed. They included a parking permit for the neighborhood, which was appreciated, as well as a guidebook/binder with helpful information and instructions. 

Overall, this place isn't flashy or expansive, but it's clean, has good hosts, is well decorated, and is in a good location. And frankly, isn't that all you need? "
2755730,48872097,2015-09-29,25815656,Laura,"The apartment was very clean and comfortable, the location was great, and the hosts were very accommodating.   We had a great time there and would return.   "

2755730,50886193,2015-10-15,628466,Jennifer And David,"Donna and Jes are amazing. The apartment is just lovely, very roomy, beautifully appointed and very, very clean. All of the communication was super clear and easy. Just as great as the apartment is the neighborhood around Fremont. What an amazing place! There are about 6 bike shops nearby, excellent bars and restaurants and breweries. I can particularly recommend 'The Whale Wins' an amazing restaurant and the Milstead coffee shop. The famous Troll is just around the corner, and the Lenin statue is just down the street. If you want to get the vibe of Seattle and not be downtown, you can't do much better than this!!"
2755730,51633878,2015-10-22,113668,Phoebe And Nick,"We were quite pleased with our stay at Donna and Jes'. Comfortable and very clean accommodations and a great location, and Donna was very responsive to our needs, available when we needed something but otherwise we didn't see her, the place is very private. Bring your bikes - the bike path is right down the hill, with easy connections in all directions."
2755730,54127341,2015-11-16,46337453,Christine,"Donna and Jes were very quick to respond to text messages.  We were able to drop off our luggage before check in time as well so that we didn't have to lug it around town.  The home was clean and comfortable.  The area is very walkable with many local shops, restaurants, cafes, and public transportation. "
2755730,56496272,2015-12-14,19934874,Marissa,We had a lovely stay in Fremont! Donna and Jes were great hosts and easy to contact. Their place was so clean and comfortable. Also close to several good restaurants and bars. Highly recommend Fremont Brewery! I would definitely stay and Donna and Jes' place again. 
3811930,17327267,2014-08-10,17374880,Juan,All good!
3811930,18378962,2014-08-25,19776429,Jasmin,"The place was great! A lot of interesting people were there during my stay. I never met the host but people said he was nice. I would recommend to fix the second toilet though, it were too many people for just one fully working restroom."
3811930,18574855,2014-08-28,19862803,Riley,"House was very nice, and in very interesting neighborhood.  Interesting layout and met some cool people.

Would definately return."
3811930,18743214,2014-08-31,19661343,Morgan,"First of all, this set up is a hostel like experience, so how much you enjoy yourself will be based on those who are also staying. There is a full kitchen stocked with spices and utensils along with a fridge, which is great for those of us who are unable to eat out. For those who can, there are a small number of places within walking distance. And walk you should. There are two bus stops, #10 and #11, a large park, and such amazing looking buildings. 

The sleeping area its self is four bunks so eight beds, and each bed is wrapped in clean sheets. There is also a heavy blanket, a pillow, a full towel, and a small fan. I think there was also a thin blanket. 

Currently there is only one bathroom, so in the mornings it can be a little tricky. I say currently because during my stay a second bathroom was in progress. Just a toilet for now though.

The communal space has plenty of comfy spaces to sit and a bookshelf that holds a few boardgames. Each night I was here I would be up after 1am talking with other travelers about the day's adventures. 

While I was unable to meet the host or hostess in person, Leah was wonderful. She gave plenty of communication via email before I arrived and gave me a cell phone number to call if I needed any help. She also placed notes around the building in easy to notice spaces, such as the wifi information on the freezer door. (Michael was out of town at the time.)

Check in/check out was a breeze and flexible, I'm one of those people that leaves around 10am and returns on the last bus home. 

I did have one criticism, as I didn't not know that beds were cleaned on a daily basis! It was quite an experience wandering in the dark trying to find where my re-arranged bed had gotten too. Leah told me she'll put up a note in the future about what times the Shared Room is cleaned.

Overall it was a wonderful experience and I highly recommend. "
3811930,18919983,2014-09-02,20493524,Will,nice deal and a nice quiet place...as advertised and the hosts have it together....highly recommended if you don't need a private room...
3811930,22554272,2014-11-09,11003802,Hong,"The location is perfect.  Capitol Hill is a nice trendy part of Seattle you should check out anyways,  not far from downtown and the main tourist attractions.  The house is really huge so even if other guests are there,  still plenty of room.  I love the stay and made friends from all around."
3811930,23705946,2014-12-08,21467504,Jack,"What a great place. Better run than a hostel, more chill than a Bed & Breakfast.  I had good conversations with several of the hosts and co-guests had great balance of friendliness/quiet.  The view was fantastic, the location reasonable, and the house itself was not only well equipped and well maintained, but *comfortable* to ""live in"" while I was there.  Arriving and departing were seamless and the rules/style-of-organization felt natural, helpful, and straightforward. Would stay again. "
3811930,25418018,2015-01-15,8805427,Drago,"It was a pleasure to stay at ""Crayola House"" (so named for its brightly-colored super comfortable rooms.) and highly highly recommend it to anyone passing through Seattle. 

PROS: The view, spacious kitchen, spacious living room, the feeling that you are living with a family that cares and not just a group of travelers (which it also is! and oh how many stories they all have!), the laundry (detergent provided), the effective heating system, comfortable beds,  separate common space that is a bit quieter and great for studying, the garage where you can keep your bike safe, the VIEW, staff (so friendly and so thoughtful!) the weekly get-togethers of past and present guests, scented candles in the bathroom (there are 3 bathrooms), how clean everything is kept, and the locks for valuables.

CONS: Many windows are sealed shut (no ventilation in the bunk room) and the shower drain needs to be unclogged (but water runs strong though!).

3811930,31618945,2015-05-07,17502302,Jim,"Great experience here. Leah and Michael were very easy to correspond with before my arrival, and arranged for one of the longer-term tenants to meet me late at night when I arrived and ensure that I was squared away. I was not around very often during the day, and so did not take full advantage of the social nature of the place, but the other guests were friendly and respectful. The house is old, but clean enough and located in an absolutely beautiful, extremely safe neighborhood near fun coffee shops and bars. Anything negative I experienced would be expected at any place with shared lodging, and is not worth mentioning here. Would definitely stay again."
3811930,32287024,2015-05-16,32453899,Dan,"Michael and Leah both did a great job of making sure I found the house and got there safely. The house is clean, comfortable, and in a great neighborhood with a great view."

3811930,33453838,2015-05-28,9520214,Federico,My stay in Crayola home was nice.. the house is really pretty and it's plenty of note cards that give explanations and tips on how to find what you need and how to use the house's appliances.. the neighbourhood is actually not so close to downtown seattle but it's very safe and surrounded by enjoyable green areas.
3811930,34111335,2015-06-04,10799985,Zain,This is my second time staying at Crayola Home and it was just as great of an experience as the last. I really like the variety to the house as each shared room space has its own feel. I would highly recommend anyone visiting Seattle to try out a night at the Crayola Home.
3811930,39540523,2015-07-24,37805164,Chandradasan,The instructions given were perfect.. The inmates already living there explained and were helpful.. it is great mutually inclusive community life.. nice neighbourhood...
3811930,40130347,2015-07-28,37276268,Stephen,"The setup here was better than the pictures might indicate. Sure, you get a bunk bed in a shared room, but the house as a whole (including the bedding/bedroom) is clean and inviting. I was regularly contacted by the host throughout my stay, and the longer-term residents of the Crayola House were great in helping me feel at home."
3811930,41987404,2015-08-10,1756350,Swaroop,Crayola House is awesome. One of my best AirBnB experiences. Leah took care of everything before my arrival. I met many interesting people there and would love to stay again next time I'm in Seattle.
3811930,43090172,2015-08-17,29008768,Aaron,"Awesome place, probably the coolest hostel I've ever stayed in.

Great to have a combination of people staying in the house for different lengths of time, it results in a really cool vibe. Everyone was very nice."
3811930,48042272,2015-09-22,17569968,Stephen,I had a wonderful time at the Crayola House. Everyone was cordial and pleasant and made me feel right at home. The sleeping arrangements were very comfortable and clean.

7824426,43344293,2015-08-18,2797984,Sarah,Another great Airbnb experience: Monica was so accommodating to my last minute booking and flexible with my arrival time. Her place is airy and bright. I found parking for my rental car easily and was able to get downtown for exploration easily. 
7824426,43567142,2015-08-20,41205960,Jimmy,"We really liked our accommodations, the neighborhood, and Monica was very helpful."

7824426,44471407,2015-08-26,24487633,Kristine,"Had a good first AirBnB experience in Seattle. The Capitol Hill neighborhood felt fairly safe - more suburban than city, but very accessible to downtown and other areas through public transportation/Uber. The apartment was spacious and welcoming, exactly as pictured. Wi-Fi was patchy when we arrived, but didn't direly need. Monica was sweet and gave us our privacy.  Overall, we had a nice 2-night stay."
7824426,45508982,2015-09-03,13064116,Steven,"Great room to crash for an awesome night in Seattle. Comfy bed, great location, and Monica was super helpful letting us in."
7824426,47740851,2015-09-21,41871347,Alex,"Monica was a great host! Her place is amazing; clean, quiet and perfect for 2 people. Couldn't be in a better location especially when you rent a car and need free parking. Bonus: her restaurant is within walking distance and has fantastic food and atmosphere for a great price! Will definitely stay again next year!"
7824426,50632427,2015-10-13,24417047,Doug,"Monica's Capitol Hill apartment was perfect for our short stay in Seattle. We did not have the opportunity to interact in person with Monica, as she is extremely busy with her restaurants, but she was always quick to respond to any questions that we had via the Airbnb app. While our overall experience was great, there were a few things that were posted on the listing that didn't exactly match our experience. For example, we were not provided with the wifi information, and we did not wake up to great local coffee. This being said, neither of these things really affected the quality of our stay. I would recommend this apartment to anyone who is looking for a well-situated, quiet apartment. "
7824426,51931148,2015-10-25,2112416,George,Loved Monica's clean light-filled apartment. Would definitely stay here again.
7264667,39711349,2015-07-25,15974858,Kexin,Nicole is very responsive towards all the questions I have. She is very nice person to talk to. She even mailed my charger which I accidentally left behind. The loft is clean and  fairly close to most of local attractions. About 20mins away to pike market and 30 mins away to space needle by walk. 
7264667,40256747,2015-07-29,38192430,Bryan,"Nicole was an excellent host and even provided some directions to local spots to visit. The place was clean, spacious, and has a balcony.  The location is pretty central and a not too bad of a walk to Capitol Hill, Pike's market, and the Space Needle. Right below the loft, there are some good spots to eat which include a Pho, sandwich, and teriyaki spot if you do not want to walk too far. Down the street, there's a local convenience store and a 24 Hour Fitness if you need supplies for the fridge and need a workout.  Next time I visit Seattle, I would definitely stay at this place again!"
7264667,40671562,2015-08-01,22618259,Greg,This spacious loft is in an amazing location with much within walking distance!  Super clean and quiet with a balcony view of the needle - what more could you want? Space also includes a brand new kitchen and washer/dryer.
7264667,43126886,2015-08-17,39879052,Vera,Nicole was very welcoming and flexible.  We were so appreciative of all of her insight and tips for the surrounding area!  It was a lovely place to stay!
7264667,44350106,2015-08-25,7507118,Ghassan,Nicole was great and the room was wonderful!
7264667,45269217,2015-09-01,29970893,Steven,"The balcony is excellent, as is the location and Vietnamese restaurant next door. Nicole clued us in about some other cool spots nearby, too. The advertised wifi is actually borrowed from the restaurant which was slightly troublesome while trying to do work (it worked about 60% of the time, and only on my laptop, not my phone). There's a bunch of construction happening right next door and right behind that likely won't be done soon (it didn't bother me, but I'm a heavy sleeper). Otherwise fine. "
7264667,47190499,2015-09-16,21213629,Meredith,"The loft is a really fantastic space and perfect for a quick weekend in Seattle. The location is also wonderful and a bunch of great sites (pike place market, space needle, etc.) are within walking distance. Nicole was very hospitable, apartment was super clean, and the back deck with view of the space needle was the best part! Only complaint is that wifi was almost nonexistent, and the bars downstairs can be pretty loud late at night, but if I was in town for fun and not work neither would have bothered me. "
4706111,24209647,2014-12-22,4810698,Mark,"Great experience.  Clean, well-appointed, new furnishings.   Location is convenient to lots of places.  We would stay there again."
4706111,25329548,2015-01-12,4784159,Susanna,"Allen's apartment was absolutely perfect. It was spacious, well maintained and felt just like home. It had everything we needed and more. Loved the fireplace too! "
877203,3932125,2013-03-28,4936116,Charlene,"Both Laura and her home r awesome. My mom and I stayed there for 8 days.  Everything is amazing. Super clean, quite convenient for going out to the attractions, or just (email hidden), washing clothes, do your work.  My mother and I nearly cooked everyday, and Laura is quite nice and helpful, since  my mother cannot speak English. One day Laura even baked a delicious quiche  inviting us to try. After all, It's just a great time there."

877203,6485631,2013-08-14,3742698,Raye,"Laura is one of the most friendliest and open minded gung-ho grandmother I've met! She makes you feel so welcomed and comfortable just like living at home. Her place is clean, cozy and centrally located near downtown Seattle about 20 mins bus ride away. I will definitely stay here when I visit Seattle again! Thanks so much, Laura for a wonderful stay and experience in Seattle :-)
"
877203,9535869,2014-01-02,4795096,Marcel Takeshi,"I stayed in Laura's house for a little more than 3 wonderful months.
Let me start with the house. It has everything you need and Laura allows you to use them. There is no TV, but for me it was no problem, because I worked most of the day. I felt absolutely at home there, if I didn't want to be disturbed, Laura respected that and I had my own space and time when I wanted.
Now about Laura, she is a wonderful person, you can talk about a lot of different topics and the talk would keep going and going and had to stop so we could get some sleep for the next day. If you need anything, she will try to help whatever you need. She helped me so much, because this was a big change for me and she made this it went really smooth.
I would recommend this house for all my friends coming to Seattle!"
877203,10842772,2014-03-10,1220417,Margaret,"She's absolutely amazing, and so is her home and neighborhood. You will feel so at home here."
877203,11379896,2014-03-31,9252239,Shandra,I loved staying at Laura's house. It was very cozy and comfortable and the room was lovely. Laura is an adorable host as well! I had a great stay and will be staying with her in the future!
877203,11502028,2014-04-05,724691,Yannie,"Laura was nice and she was very busy and tried to do as much as she could. i did not realize it was a african-american neighborhood,  though close to international district. It was not up to my cleanness and comfort standard, but considering the room rate,  her place  was good for the traveller with a budget"
877203,11821708,2014-04-15,4633958,Juan,"I had a great time in Seattle thanks in part to Laura's easy and flexible check in. I only saw her on the second day but she was super friendly. The room was very cozy with a comfy bed, it is a bit far from DT but if you don't mind walking then its not that big of an issue. Plus its a great way to experience each little corner. If you're flying in take the light rail (2.50?), also rent a bike from Timbuk2 (free! with a deposit), get out n check all the usual Space Needle, Pike's Market, etc. I would def stay here again, however, consider its a good 30 min walk to DT. Thanks Laura"
877203,12464745,2014-05-03,13842795,Lynn,"My stay in Seattle was to see an old friend. The location to him was perfect, just around the corner.
The house was clean and tidy and the room had all I needed, especially a very comfortable bed.
There was a little trouble with the plumbing in the shower but Laura was on to it as soon as it happened and there was another shower to use, so I wasn't put out at all.
I loved Seattle and wouldn't hesitate to stay their again if my friend was in the same neighborhood, Thanks Lynn, Australia "
877203,17118615,2014-08-07,7879551,Allen,Amazing place to stay! It's really clean and lovely! Safe and convenient neighborhood  
877203,17639383,2014-08-15,18164311,Maxim,"Laura was very friendly and responsive. The room had a big table and splendid WiFi. I was able to get the work done, and enjoyed my stay."
877203,17946838,2014-08-19,2744597,Mark And Linda,"This was our third stay with Laura.  Again, she provides just what we need--a comfortable bed, a nice shower, a bright, pleasant home, a big smile.  She is a delightful woman."
877203,18201942,2014-08-23,121440,Denise,"Laura was really easy to communicate with even on some last minute changes from me.  The room was as described nice, quiet and clean."
877203,18366562,2014-08-25,19994823,Quinn,"Nice place, clean, good neighbourhood close to downtown. Would stay again."
877203,20494408,2014-09-30,17392048,Zoé,"Laura is great, I stayed four weeks in her house, she leaves you your space, but if you want a chat or if you need anything she'll be ready to help. She's a lot of fun and cares about others. Great Host !!!
Everything listed is accurate, and the house is really clean and comfortable."
877203,21855303,2014-10-25,18880359,Jay,"I had a great stay. Laura is friendly and accommodating. The place is very comfortable, close to where I needed to be, and with ample parking. I would not hesitate to stay here again. Thank you."

Thank you very much for a great stay at your place!
I enjoyed it much.

You are an excellent host - your place is excellent.

Happy New Year.
All the Best.

877203,28127413,2015-03-18,27293185,Valerie,This was my first experience with Airbnb and it was a success from start to finish. How nice to feel welcome in someones home. Laura Gonzalez was a wonderful Host. She made me feel so comfortable and  answered all questions I had. Her home was perfectly located for my visit. My room was lovely and light and I will hopefully be able to stay there on my next visit to Seattle.
877203,28729792,2015-03-29,28742827,Mary,"Laura is a friendly and gracious hostess. Staying In Jimi Hendrix's Neighborhood quickly felt like home! The neighborhood has easy access to public transportation with a grocery, drugstore, and library nearby. It's a great place to start in Seattle!"
877203,32857429,2015-05-22,32779709,Gagan,"Laura's place was great and exactly as advertised. The room was spacious and had a lot of natural light. A good place to lounge on a weekend. The house was well connected to the bus routes and a walk away from Seattle Uni (which came in good use for my football games). There were a bunch of nice places to eat and Laura was helpful and guided us in this regard. 

Laura is well traveled and it shows across when you speak to her. She had so many books and movies in her room! And I added a bit to the list of movies she had on her watchlist. She gave us our space but was always there when needed. On weekends she is lounging on her hammock :P Loved her place and would have continued to stay if only it wasnt booked for the next 2 months! "
877203,35459986,2015-06-19,13130255,Christopher,"I could not recommend a stay with Laura more. Laura is not only a wonderful host, highly concerned with your comfort and happiness, she is a remarkably kind person. Here home provided both wonderful accommodations and a sense of real relaxation at the end of the day. "
877203,38473259,2015-07-15,33525893,Hayley,The host canceled this reservation 16 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
877203,40198020,2015-07-29,28003608,Michele,"Ho soggiornato da Laura per più di un mese ed è stata davvero una bella esperienza. La casa è carina e ben fornita; una cucina ben attrezzata, un giardino sul retro e la camera è carina, con un letto comodo ed un ampia scrivania per lavorare.  l'accoglienza di Laura è al top. Lei è una persona molto socievole e generosa, ci tiene che non manchi nulla al tuo soggiorno. Il quartiere è tranquillo a pochi passi da supermarket, lavanderia, farmacia e altri servizi. Venti minuti a piedi per raggiungere downtown oppure il pratico bus a due passi. "
877203,40664415,2015-08-01,19169138,Ashley,"Laura was very accommodating to our arrival schedule as since we were on a road-trip we were unsure of our arrival time.  Also, being that we visited during the extreme heat wave and there was no AC, she kindly gave us a fan for the room.  If you are just looking for a good place to sleep and don't spend on being in the house much this is a nice option.

The house was located in a good area for access downtown (quick drive or about a $10 uber ride).  It was a little farther out from Queen Anne and Ballard.

While the listing does say private bathroom, I would point out that Laura also has another listing for a second room in this same home.  If a guest is also staying in the second room then you end up sharing the bathroom.  This was not clear to us and we ended up sharing the bathroom with a mother and her young son.  So if you are looking for something more private this is not the spot."
877203,48506291,2015-09-27,27872824,Aurora,"Laura has a very cute, clean house with nice rooms available. I slept in a room (not pictured) with two beds. The bathroom is shared with the other tenant, which worked out fine. I was up too early to enjoy the advertised homemade breakfast.
If you aren't familiar with Seattle, please be warned that the Central District is not the cute little cafe neighborhood I expected. It's dangerous to walk at night, and while the bus system is very close, you will be sharing your bus ride with some interesting characters, so that wasn't always a great option either. I didn't have my car, so this was an issue and the added expense of using Uber to get around between the hours of 6pm-6am is something to consider. "
877203,50782484,2015-10-14,11015306,Nicholas,Laura was a very nice host and has a great place to stay!
877203,56657762,2015-12-16,42345860,Makoto,"I stayed there for 2 months. It was a convenient place near from Red Apple, Walgreen, and a brewery (especially for me).
Laura was a good host. I enjoyed food, beer, and some activities with her and other guests."
366301,36615939,2015-06-29,7010314,Karina,"We really enjoyed staying here!! The apartment has a lot of atmosphere and we felt welcome immediately. The space is very comfortable and spacious and the neighborhood is quiet, very friendly and have nice bars and coffee shops etc. The public transport options to the city is excellent and we will be happy to stay here again for our next visit to Seattle. On top of all this Dawn was very informative and helpful all through the process. Thanks!!"
366301,41374281,2015-08-07,35881284,Kitty,"Dawn's apartment looks exactly like the pictures: filled with old world charm and personality. The unusual recent heat wave turned out to be a non issue since the airflow within the apt was sufficient. We do appreciate the extra fans Dawn provided. The bed was very comfortable with amazing pillows amazing, and the couch good for short stays. Neighborhood is residential but can get noisy from airplanes passing by overhead, neighbors (occasional), and utility trucks (occasional) . We particularly enjoy the park across the street, taking evening walks, seeing children playing, family gatherings, etc.. Going into Seattle (downtown, international district, etc) is a snap with a rather reliable city bus (#36) and even Alki Beach (#50 40min). Supermarket, library, coffee shops are, as advertised, within walking distance or a quik 5 min drive. All and all, we had a good stay. "
366301,42542580,2015-08-14,31792890,Sarah,"The listing was exactly as described. The location is great, the kitchen was well stalked & it is quite roomy for a one bedroom. There was good communication from the beginning even though Dawn Marie was out of town when I came so her friend managed keys, etc. they even left sweet welcome gifts & a packet of info about the apartment/neighborhood.  

I was very happy there & would definitely recommend it to friends if they were coming to Seattle. "
366301,42904960,2015-08-16,15699296,Louesa,"Dawn's apartment was the perfect spot for our two night trip to Seattle. It was well kept, peaceful and relaxing and we both appreciated her artistic and unique style. The apartment was spacious and comfortable and would be a great home base for anyone exploring the city.  The building itself is a great heritage building so it can be expected that the water pressure in the shower was a little weak and the floors creak a bit here and there, but we thought it was charming. 

We were in town to go to a Seahawks game and it was so easy to walk to the light rail station and ride just a few stops to the stadium (and just a couple more to downtown). 

Beacon Hill itself was a nice little neighbourhood with a couple of restaurants/bars, a grocery story and Jefferson Park (just across the street!) which had great views of the city. 

Dawn's friend Sarah was a great host: clear communication, great recommendations and very welcoming. 

We would not hesitate to go back to Dawn's place and give it a high recommendation. That said, if you are a light sleeper it is important to note that it is close to the trains and also under a flight path, so there is some ongoing noise, but some earplugs would probably take care of that. We weren't bothered. 

Overall - a fantastic experience. Thank you Dawn and Sarah!"
366301,43391012,2015-08-19,37363624,Bea,"We didn't actually meet the host or her neighbor, but they texts were prompt and instructions were very good.  The location is a perfect jumping off point and is located in a bohemian/hipster area with lots of parks and character.  Parking wasn't as difficult as I thought, but the location is an older building so EVERYTHING squeaks including many of the floorboards.  If you're looking for new and modern, this is not the spot for you, but if you like eclectic and shabby chic then it's the perfect place.  There is no television but you have access to internet to stream movies and it works very well.  The couch makes a lot of noise, but it's really comfortable and the bed in the room is better than the one I have at home.  This is a good home base if you're moving around the city and don't want to be downtown in the middle of the mess.  The local was pretty good and easy to find."
366301,43652226,2015-08-21,37899496,Bich,Dawn was out of town so I was mainly in contact with her friend Sarah. Sarah was extremely helpful and kind. I did not get the chance to meet her but she was very responsive through text. The place is exactly as pictured. The stay was very enjoyable and finding parking was a breeze.
366301,45562186,2015-09-04,17308147,Kristy,"We spent two wonderful weeks at Dawn's place. Although she wasn't available, her friend Sarah coordinated everything smoothly answering questions and leaving us the keys. The apartment is large compared to other places we have stayed. The living room is filled with plants and vintage music.  The kitchen seems to have everything. The Beacon Hill neighborhood has interesting history, a grocery store, a library, and sound link station all within 15 minutes walking.  Just down the street there are nice places to eat and drink coffee. Although the clothes washer wasn't available, Dawn provided directions to the laundromat that served us well.  I recommend Dawn's place and would stay there again."

Sheila was very hospitable and even had a plate of cookies for us to munch on during our visit. We would stay again and wish we could've stayed longer! Her dog and cat are very friendly!

Their house is beautiful and well kept and it is located in a quiet cul-de-sac. We particularly enjoyed the porch and their playful little dogs. The location is great for exploring the city, with easy access to buses and within walking distance to the bakery and the beaches in Lake Washington. We had a great time; thank you very much!"
4639465,35583281,2015-06-20,33312976,Jillian,Staying with Sheila was an absolutely amazing experience! She was very welcoming and had everything prepared for us in our room. She also had some treats from a local bakery available in the kitchen. She gave a full tour of the home which was stunning and newly renovated. She was available at any time via text for recommendations to do in the city or places to eat. She was even available to give us a ride one morning to the Space Needle which was greatly appreciated. The home was clean and had everything we needed for the our stay! We had an unbelievable time in Seattle and will be back!

The house is in a cozy neighborhood but less than 5 miles from any of the locations we needed to visit. We rented a car and there was plenty of street parking. It's beautifully decorated and our room was really comfortable. We were there for work and it was nice to just go back to our room and unwind after a long day. It happened to be really hot in Seattle the weekend we went but they had a fan in the room which was nice. They also have 2 adorable sweet little pom's and it was a lot of fun to play with them! There is a TV in the room and wifi so we had everything we needed! ;) Easy process to check in, yummy cookies waiting for us. Also very thoughtful Sheila had lavender shampoo & conditioner in the room for us (natural ingredients too which I love!) Small details and touches were noticed, thank you Sheila and Kim!!"
4639465,37088202,2015-07-04,19852744,Alona,"Sheila and Kim made us feel very welcome in their home, neighborhood and city! The communication was easy before, during and even after our trip, as my friend left behind a ring. Sheila caught this and contacted me right away, offering to hold it so we could swing back by or mail it to us in Arizona. Much appreciated!

S&K told us about local joints to grab a beer or watch a soccer game, invited us to help them get through the beer in their fridge (left overs from a recent event), and were completely understanding when it came to us staying out and coming back late. We were a short bus ride from downtown, too, which was nice.

Their home was comfie and clean - two great things when you're traveling and away from your usual surroundings. Upon arrival there were towels set out, as well as shampoo and conditioner for our use, plus, a tray set with a pitcher of water and two glasses. How thoughtful! And that guest bed? Let me tell you, it was crazy- comfortable. Opening the windows at night was helpful for us Arizona folks because we're so used to A/C!

Even though we didn't avail ourselves of all that our hosts offered, it was nice to know that we could put a few things in the fridge, eat at their table or even chill in their backyard.

I would recommend Sheila and Kim's airbnb to anyone, especially if you're a dog lover. Staying here really started our vacation off right!"
4639465,41375796,2015-08-07,290444,Alan,"Sheila and Kim were great hosts, very welcoming and accommodating.  They made us feel quite at home.  The neighborhood is quite calm and residential, but not too far from the downtown area which we found to be a great combination.  And we just loved their welcome committee of two Pomeranians that never failed to greet us at the entry.  "
4639465,42412736,2015-08-13,17638693,Ioana,"We were well received and we found our hostess very helpful. Sheila made sure that we can enter the premisses as soon as we arrived, even though she was at work, and Kim showed us around so that we could get installed. They also gave us information on  public tarnsportation, restaurants in the neighbourhood (quite good) and the very good bakery/cafe which we adopted for our early morning coffee. 
The sharred bathroom is very clean and spacious, with lots of natural light. It seemed like we could use it almost at will-sharing it presented no problems to us. The neighbourhood is quiet and the place is not too far from downtown.  The bed is large and comfortable, but the room was a bit small for two people. The closet provided extra space for our clothes and a suitcase, and that helped free some space in the room. All in all, we enjoyed the time we spent in Seattle and the friendliness of its people, our hostess included.    "
4639465,43408264,2015-08-19,1038049,Dylan,"Sheila and Kim (and their super-cute and friendly pomeranians) were great hosts. The room was very comfortable, and made an excellent home base for our stay in Seattle. The hosts made my girlfriend and I feel very welcome, and gave us helpful advice about the city. We would absolutely recommend them to other folks visiting Seattle."
4639465,44382680,2015-08-25,35174241,Meaghan,Sheila's house is beautiful! Bedroom was amazing and so comfortable. I didn't get to meet her due to how busy we were but my interactions with her were great through text. Would recommend this place to anyone. 
4639465,45999612,2015-09-07,7445458,Nicole,"We really enjoyed our stay at Sheila's place. The location was convenient to downtown Seattle and a short walk to the Capitol Hill area. The room itself was clean and comfortable, as was the rest of the house. We would stay here again if we are ever in Seattle!"
4639465,47101422,2015-09-15,7027989,Owen,"Sheila was very considerate and attentive to our needs during check in. She helped us get set up with the smart lock so we could check in whenever. She's a laid back host, would definitely stay at her place again when I visit again!"
4639465,47856020,2015-09-21,43283235,Rachelle,"This was a great AirBnB experience.  Sheila was very friendly and communicated so well.  Her house is fantastic, with great decorative taste I really enjoyed.  The location is really, really fantastic and was just minutes away from most of our planned outings.  The queen-sized mattress was very comfortable.  There were so many nice finishing touches: a pitcher of water, tea, little cookies, lovely soap, etc.  And her dogs are adorable!!!  I'd totally stay here again."
4639465,48797060,2015-09-28,2751558,Emma,"We arrived at Sheila's house late afternoon to be greeted by herself and her two wonderful dogs, Esme and Poe! The house itself is fabulous (and has given us some inspiration for our own place), well decorated, clean and comfortable. The bedroom is great with a fantastic memory foam mattress, and includes access to a shared bathroom/kitchen. Once settled, Sheila gave us some very helpful advice regarding travel and even let us use her travel card! Regarding the neighbourhood, it's a lovely wee area with plenty of small shops, restaurants and bakeries nearby that were great for breakfast. The house is also a short walk from the bus stop which allowed us to get in to the city centre quickly and easily.

Overall, Sheila went out of her way to make our stay special and we would certainly return should we ever be back in Seattle. "
4639465,53949633,2015-11-14,45637490,Stella,The host canceled this reservation 7 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
8136553,46078094,2015-09-07,11526615,Shella,Alessandro was very welcoming and communicated everything that we needed to know about his apartment/location.  His apartment is in a great location and it feels very private.
7091397,39317403,2015-07-22,33310888,Skylar,"Barbara was very sweet, she even offered to order us dinner after our drive from Montana to Seattle because we were stuck in traffic. the kitchen was beautiful and spotless, as was the rest of the bungalow. great location and very close to transportation. "
7091397,40491377,2015-07-31,13344084,Carlin,"""The Secret Garden Bungalow"" should add  an adjective to its name: ""Wonderful"". Barbara and ti have created a welcoming private retreat in the heart of Queen Anne. From the outdoor patios to the well-appointed tree-top loft, their bungalow is a great place to be in the city and away at the same time.

Barbara was super helpful and committed to making sure her guests had a great stay. Highly recommend! "
7091397,41788631,2015-08-09,34230948,Justinian,Barbara and the Secret Garden Bungalow were great! She was very kind and responsive to questions. When our flight wasn't until 5:40 and I asked if we could stay a bit after check out time she didn't mind. The place was perfect for our needs and was much nicer than any hotel room for a very fair price. The location as well was great as it was within walking distance of many parts of Seattle.  You won't regret staying here!
7091397,43271838,2015-08-18,5309417,Peter,"Great host, great city and great location! Beautiful accomidation, you pretty much have your own house. I wouldn't think twice about rebooking."
7091397,43793416,2015-08-22,13040912,Thea,"Barbara was an amazing host, very polite and responsive. The bungalow was even better than advertised. It is beautiful, clean, and in a wonderful area. We walked 20 minutes to downtown Seattle and drove to other areas of Seattle. We will definitely be
recommending Barbara to friends and would love to return again!"
7091397,44462840,2015-08-26,18310018,Rina, Is the best best airbnb house I have ever stayed. Barbara is so nice and generous. I think her house is much better than what the pictures showed. I was so surprised that this house could be booked at such a low price. Thank you for everything'
7091397,45263110,2015-09-01,6378589,Joe,"Barbara's place is fantastic, and Barbara was a wonderful host! 

When we arrived, she was there to greet us, show us around, and even had fresh food awaiting us.  The place was incredibly clean and actually a lot more spacious than I expected.  It was so comfortable and very well maintained.  Actually, it felt like everything was very new! 

The neighborhood is a great launching spot for a visit in Seattle. There are great restaurants/shops within a couple blocks and easy access to the buses.  It's also a pleasant mile-or-so walk to Seattle Center/Space Needle. 

When I travel back to Seattle, I'm going to base it on when Barbara has availability!  "
7091397,47469469,2015-09-19,22450610,Vicki,"""The Secret Garden Bungalow"" is truly that and as pointed out by other reviewers, it is very clean and well appointed. You wind through a lovely garden area to reach the main door which faces a very nice patio. There is a serene garden under the birch trees and arbor at the side of the bungalow with a dining table and fountain. Unfortunately we encountered enough rain on our visit that we really couldn't take advantage of the outdoor amenities but we did enjoy that they were visible from our snug and dry quarters.  Barbara was a very thoughtful hostess. She provided staples (and then some) in the kitchen including milk and bread, oatmeal and fresh fruit and coffee. Barbara was in a class when we arrived and her husband, Tim, gave us a guided and thorough tour of our accommodations and was ready to give us suggestions of what to see in the area. We weren't like many guests in that we knew the area well as our children had been living about two blocks away for the last 9 years. We didn't need much help in finding things to do but there were maps and guide books available if you need them. The location is perfect for getting around as the bus stop is just 2 blocks away. It's only 3 blocks to the grocery store, some wonderful little shops and really good restaurants. If you choose to stay at the Secret Garden, you will not be disappointed. "
7091397,48537549,2015-09-27,6548257,Beverly,"We choose our Airbnb's by location and price.  The location is in the heart of Queen Anne-just a few blocks from restaurants, shops and Trader Joes! A safe, quiet neighborhood. The accommodations were very clean, lots of space, comfortable bed, well appointed kitchen and appealing style/decor.  We met Barbara our first day and she was available anytime during our stay. We needed one recommendation and she got back to us right away with exactly the information we needed. She is a great host and very nice and approachable. Thank you and we hope to be back our next trip to Seattle. "
7091397,49622548,2015-10-05,41633778,Paul And Suzette,"Please was great.  Location was right around the corner from my son's apartment and within 3 blocks of downturn Queen Anne.  Bedroom upstairs was very comfortable, slept great.  Host had basket of snacks and fruit available along with juice and other miscellaneous items in the refrigerator .  

"
7091397,52832181,2015-11-02,1298855,Anya,"My husband and I stayed at Barbara’s place for three weeks and we thoroughly enjoyed it. The little cottage is very cozy, bright and airy. It is impeccably clean and very comfortable. The kitchen is well equipped. We cooked every day. We had everything we needed and more, because in addition to the bedroom, the kitchen, the bathroom and the living space there is a great gym area with machines, yoga mats, weights – everything one might want for a great workout. 
The weather didn’t allow sitting outside, but there is plenty of space with shade and lighting if one is to visit during warmer months.
The location is absolutely great. The Upper Queen Anne neighborhood is one of the best in the city: beautiful family houses with gardens and many views of the city below, mountains in the distance and water all around (Puget Sound on one side, Lake Union on the other). The place is within a walking distance from stores, art and fitness studios and parks. 
I would recommend this place to my friends and family and I hope to be back at Barbara’s next time we come to Seattle.

6752031,37361144,2015-07-06,14083684,Nika,"Johnny was nice enough to come home from work to let us in the apartment. The apartment was big and clean and close to down town, a ten minute walk. There was a couch and a room with an airbed to sleep on. "
6752031,38008672,2015-07-12,31497874,Li,"Johnny is a very kind and patient young man. He gave us plenty of freedom when we stayed at his place.  You can eithet use the big sofa or the air matress. His apartment is very conveniently located in downtown Seattle. We just walked from his place to almost every place we wanted to visit, including the space needle. I will stay at his place if I visit Seattle again!"
6752031,38302377,2015-07-14,35972211,Sharon,"Seattle is a beautiful city with many things to do. The apartment was close to everything but we used Uber and Lift most of the time because there were hills everywhere we walked. Lol! Johnny was a great host, he gave us the house rules and tour of the apartment and made sure we had a place to store our things while we checked out and still explore the city on our last day. We hardly saw each other but it was fine because we explored outside most of the days we were in town.  Would definitely go back and stay there again!"
6752031,38514530,2015-07-16,20487306,Alina,"We had such a great time at Johnnys home! He was welcoming, caring and had some great ideas what to visit during our stay. The flat is very clean and the sofa we slept on was like heaven :) All interesting places in downtown are within walking distance. Simply the best way to stay in Seattle- would definitily come back!"
6752031,39075541,2015-07-20,15650697,Min Suk,"I really enjoyed staying at Johnny's place! It's conveniently located close to the downtown and attractions (walking distance to Convention Center, Pike Place Market). The place was nice and clean as well -- he provided pillows as well as clean pillow covers and sheets when I got there. Sofa was comfortable to sleep on as well. Johnny was very nice and accommodating -- my trip was delayed, but he was very nice to understand my situation and was flexible with it. Overall, a great place to stay!"
6752031,39424531,2015-07-23,5483040,James,"The location is very convenient as it is a short walk to downtown Seattle and Pioneer Square. The apartment block has a decent gym, an outdoor pool and an amazing roof terrace with wonderful views. However, the room itself needs a little work to be properly habitable. If this were addressed it would make the world of difference and I have given constructive feedback to the host. "
6752031,41091952,2015-08-04,33519148,Nat,"A good place to stay, central to most locations we needed to access. Johnny was able to answer any questions we had and was extremely friendly and accommodating for the time we were there. Definitely somewhere I would recommend staying."
6752031,41485832,2015-08-07,20154380,Vivian,I was running around a lot for a conference and Johnny made the logistics easy for staying in his place.  He was friendly and quick to respond to any questions I had about the place.  I would definitely recommend him as a host.  The place was clean and close to the central downtown area.  Everything was easy!
6752031,42693280,2015-08-15,36383292,Yujing,"The host is very nice and quite. This place is very convenient, 2 minutes walk to convention center. The whole apartment is very clean. All in all, this is a good choice to stay."
6752031,43402780,2015-08-19,36734921,Debbie,My stay at Johnny's place was awesome.  He was very polite and friendly.  answered any and all of my questions.  The place was clean and well kept. It was very easy to come and go. If things work out I plan on staying at Johnny's again and bringing my grandson along because it was a fabulous week.  Thank you so much Johnnie for sharing your home with me and God bless you.
6752031,44649028,2015-08-28,36227400,Susan,"Johnny was a great host. He was there when I needed him and invisible most of the rest of the time. He was accommodating to my needs, even ask him to be available for me to check in super early. 

Thanks!  Would defiantly stay again. "
6752031,45256969,2015-09-01,20412914,Joe,Johnny's space was exactly as promised. It was great to be within walking distance of the convention center. Would definitely consider staying there again in the future.
6752031,45622466,2015-09-04,42715681,Daniel,"Johnny's place is great. He has a nice little apartment right in the middle of downtown Seattle. He keeps it pretty clean, no issues here. He hooks you up with towels/blankets. You will be sleeping on his couch, but 1) it's a super comfortable couch and 2) he offers great price for the location. I was easily able to apartment hunt without destroying my bank. Thanks!"
6752031,47010259,2015-09-14,40910968,Sammy,Extremely convenient location (close to the convention center).  Johnny was super nice and helpful throughout my short stay. Can only recommend!!
6752031,47505646,2015-09-19,1098918,Richard,The host canceled this reservation 6 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.

6705584,35160961,2015-06-15,33230307,Ben,"Nice place for the money, as hotels in the university district are far more expensive.  Parking was difficult, but not impossible, but you don't really need a car to access all the shops and restaurants nearby.  Melissa was a good host, and just upgraded the wifi, so Internet access was great.  I stayed a week and it was only noisy once on a Saturday night, then perfectly quiet thereafter.  Shower was ocassionally lacking in power, but was always hot.  Would recommend for 1-2 people traveling on a budget."
6705584,38146619,2015-07-13,26231344,Rauldon,The listing is exactly as described.  quiet neighborhood with alot of good restaurants nearby. Melissa is great!  She responds very quickly to text.  Def reccomend.  
6705584,49121973,2015-10-01,33023382,혜리,"아파트는 UW 주변에 위치하고 있고 2층에 위치하고 있습니다. 아파트 자체가 좀 낡긴 했으나 전반적으로 시설물들은 깨끗했습니다.
UW 주변에 걸어가면 식당가가 있고 downtown 으로 가는 버스가 있어 편리했습니다. 밤에는 전반적으로 조용한 편이었습니다. 와이파이가 잘 되었고 히터가 잘 되어 전혀 춥지 않았던 것이 큰 장점이었습니다."
217142,649780,2011-10-21,1183305,Sara,"Outstanding accommodation! 

We had such a great time in Seattle and this was mainly due to the lovely apartment we stayed in and the over and above customer service Yvonne provided.

Our flight from Chicago to Seattle was cancelled, which resulted in a very late arrival into Seattle (midnight). Yvonne was there to let us in a show us around. She was incredibly warm and friendly and we were so grateful - considering we had travelled cross country via bus with two very small children. 

We would highly recommend staying here and would return again ourselves. The only downside to our trip was that we couldn't stay longer. 

Thanks again!
"
217142,762374,2011-12-04,1345586,Kevin,"Yvonne's apartment is in a great location and everything is in first class condition. I would have no hesitation in recommending that you stay there if you want to visit Seattle. There is a great little Italian restaurant just downstairs, a fantastic jazz venue just a short walk up the street (Tula's) and everything you need in the kitchen to make a visit to the Pike Market worthwhile (again just a short walk away). I will certainly be calling Yvonne again the next time I need to visit Seattle. "
217142,813528,2011-12-29,1526118,Nicolas,"Great experience. We stayed for two nights with four adults and two children. We had a lot of fun. The kitchen was quite decently equipped, giving us the opportunity to cook and bake. It was relatively calm area and the parking accommodated our minivan, so it was a really pleasant experience."
217142,909285,2012-02-08,1599529,Sarah,"We had a great experience at the Belltown condo. The location is fantastic - just a short walk to dozens of great restaurants and things to do. Lori was a good host, as well. She was quick to reply to my emails (even over the weekend) and very professional."
217142,974759,2012-03-06,1218320,Leonard,"We had a perfect experience, the unit was exactly as described and pictured.  Great location, very convenient to everything, the unit was
immaculate and we could not have asked for more.  Lori is the unit
manager but we also communicated with the owner, both were just
absolutely super people to deal with.  This was also our first dealing
with AirBnB and having booked the unit for five nights, the advance
payment due was substantial.  We also give them a big thumbs up
for professionalism and service, they're a first class operation."
217142,1008511,2012-03-17,1476322,Paul,The condo is comfortable and has a great location in downtown Seattle. You could even walk to several great sites in town including the Pike Market. We really enjoyed our stay there!
217142,1061384,2012-03-30,1855563,Michael,"My wife and our three kids stayed here for 4 days and absolutely loved it.  There was a cold bottle of wine (very nice after 3hrs in the car with kids!) waiting for us.  Somehow, she arranged sunshine in Seattle as well...  The location is idea for downtown walking, and the amenities of the apartment are great!"
217142,1436800,2012-06-08,874998,Scott,Great property in a great Belltown location. Lots of good restaurants within walking distance.
217142,1485292,2012-06-15,2343803,Lisa,"We loved this Belltown condo. Great location...easy access to major sites as well as Seattle University where our daughters go to school.
Complex is quiet and very well maintained. Spacious condo with great kitchen that had all of the kitchen utensils, pans, etc. for cooking. 
We'll happily stay again when we return to Seattle."
217142,2031128,2012-08-19,575061,Kenji,"The condo was very spacious, clean, and beautifully furnished. We had a wonderful time resting inside. It's ideally located in a vibrant part of the city. We'd be happy to stay again!"
217142,2481912,2012-10-02,2849860,David,"My stay at Lori Vieira's was pretty great. As soon as I arrived I felt welcome, and everything way laid out for me, making it easy to begin decompressing from work and life's stresses. We definitely took advantage of fully stocked kitchen, and I loved my mini hibernation sessions in the master bedroom. Actually, every room was great to be in, with the right essentials to feel comfy. The Wii was definitely a bonus to have, as my friends and I had many laughs playing some of the games I brought from home.
This experience, and I would definitely recommend staying with Lori."
217142,2934449,2012-11-21,3546068,Kevin,"We had a wonderful experience with Nick and the condo, it was exactly as advertised and very clean. The family used the gym and found it to be more than adequate, very convenient. Nice, quiet building in a great neighborhood location and away from the touristy spots- but an easy walk to Pikes Place and the Space Needle.
Nick took the time to get us situated and was quick with recommendations on where to eat and spend time, really was a nice warm welcome. If you are looking for a nice 2 bedroom, consider this location and unit- we would stay here again on a return trip! Kevin"
217142,3080766,2012-12-13,2776457,Geoff,"It was awesome apartment, walking distance to all places. It was the little things that made it feel like that home away from home, like a full kitchen and cooking utensils, the washing machine and dryer, the king size bed. Everything was great and as described. Couldn't  be happier. "
217142,3134999,2012-12-22,2267520,Sean,Perfect location.  Very nice folks to deal with.  Everything was very smooth.  Would definitely stay with Nick again!!  Thank you!!
217142,5038199,2013-06-09,6210200,Christian,"Great, responsive host! Everything was taken care of in a very professional manner. The apartment is beautiful and was perfectly located for our purposes: We were there mainly for work, and the conference center, along with many other places of interest, is in walking distance. My colleagues and I felt like at home and would definitely recommend it or stay there again."
217142,6930613,2013-08-31,5104693,Mark,"Even with a late arrival into Seattle, Autumn was waiting to greet us at the Apartment and make sure we knew all about the apartment facilities and local area. Apartment was in great location to explore Seattle, and it was very easy to walk to all the major attractions. Belltown Pizza within block was superb with great food and friendly staff, and the crew in Starbucks on 1st Avenue ( a 2 minute walk) were very friendly and served great (website hidden) in the apartment was easy, and with Fish and Veg purchased at Pike Place Market, we had probably the best salmon ever tasted, would thoroughly recommend! Overall a great apartment, superb location and with great service from Autumn we had a brilliant week in Seattle."
217142,8789291,2013-11-18,4391883,Tia,"Everything was great about our stay.  The apartment was beautifully decorated, comfortable, clean, and quiet.  The location was perfect too - restaurants, bakeries, cocktail bars right outside the door.  Yet an easy walk / 5 minutes to downtown; or a 5 minute cab ride to Capitol Hill with more great shops and so on.  Autumn was very flexible with our check in, and very approachable in general.  She shared personal tips on places to go and eat which was great too!  Would absolutely recommend!"
217142,9343225,2013-12-23,7806131,Jorge,The apartment was very very clean and comfortable. The location was the best. The kitchen had everything you could posibly need. We would recomend it without a doubt.
217142,12429486,2014-05-02,13080731,Ian,"A very nice apartment in a good, central location. Access to a good gym and pool was a bonus.
Autumn was very helpful (there when we arrived to show us around) and flexible with our arrangements."
217142,13139856,2014-05-20,11883326,Tanya,"The apartment is very well advertised, as I was very pleased upon arrival!  It was perfect for our group of 6 adult females.  Would be great for a family or two couples as well!  Spacious kitchen.  Comfy king bed.  Two full bathrooms!  Great location in downtown Seattle.  Wifi.  SO close to the fabulous Macrina bakery.  Loved our short long weekend getaway!  And Autumn was very friendly and quick to respond to emails.  We had everything we needed.  Thanks, Autumn!

217142,13897098,2014-06-07,9703150,Tyler,"Secretly I want to tell you all how terrible this place is, and it would be *ENTIRELY* for selfish reasons because I want to be able to stay here every time I come... and Melissa's places get booked so fast.   There's a reason for that.  Melissa / Autumn and team are top notch.  The places are fantastic and I literally get depressed when I come to Seattle and have to stay elsewhere because they're booked.   They're the best in town, in my humble opinion.  I am in Seattle about 15 times a year and I refuse to stay with anyone else.   Again, I'd advise you not to stay here but I can't.  YOU SHOULD STAY HERE.  They're the best.  Seriously."
217142,16968381,2014-08-05,1534678,Jens,"Wir waren mit 6 Personen unterwegs und dafür war das Apartment genau richtig. Unsere beiden kleineren Kinder haben im Wohnzimmer auf der Couch geschlafen, was gut ging. Bäder und Küche waren voll funktionsfähig und in sehr gutem Zustand (nur die Frontplatte vom Geschirrspüler hat gefehlt). Die Lage des Apartments war sehr gut, knapp 10 Minuten zur Space Needle und zum Pike Place Market zu Fuss, auch den Rest von Downtown sind wir zu Fuss abgegangen. "
217142,20586915,2014-10-01,13563916,Andrew,This was a great home with an even better location. Scarlett did a great job getting us set up and making sure our stay was comfortable. Would highly recommend to others!
217142,21502370,2014-10-19,11707124,Amy,"We rented two apartments in the building for a family visit. Autumn met us when we arrived and was very helpful with instructions and orientation. The building is in a fantastic location, walkable to the Seattle Center, Pikes Market and Downtown. The apartment was spacious and worked well for us. While we didn't need to use the AC units they were akwardly placed in the master bedroom and it was difficult to get in and out of the bed by the window. Additionally the maintenance on the unit was not really up to par. The carpets had multiple spots and stains and there were lights out in all the rooms. One apartment was missing bath mats and coffee. Overall, we had an enjoyable visit, but the maintenance could use some improvement.
"
217142,23186783,2014-11-24,17065060,David,"Awesome apartment, great location, comfy beds, lots of space. Autumn and Matthew made it very easy to check in and out. Would definitely stay here again! Thanks! "
217142,24269699,2014-12-24,23536649,Catherine,"The hostess was great. She met us at the apartment and gave us clear instructions on everything including parking, entering the building, wifi, etc. 
The unit itself was very clean and spacious. The location was awesome as we spent most our time walking around downtown to the library, pikes market, and lots of great little restaurants nearby (including a world class sushi restaurant in the same building). 
The only thing to keep in mind is that if you're planning on renting a car as we did, the parking garage is very tight to get around in and the spots are incredibly tight. It's fine if you don't plan on driving in and out too often. "
217142,24526662,2014-12-30,21269237,Carlos,"Autumn received us on time, texting here was really easy and very fast.
The apartment was exactly what she described in the add, the location was fantastic, everything was close, you can walk almost to any ware, the pike market, the space needle, the museums, shopping, restaurants… breakfast, lunch, dinner, bars, pizza, bakery… EVERYTHING
The only thing that you can improve is to tell your guests that the apartment boiler (hot water) is very little and that it works very well for 2 people, 3 if they teake a fast shower, and definitely not for 4 (unfortunately I was always the last)  :) 
We use the gym, the pool and the roof garden, the view was amazing... also we use the grill and it was fantastic.
Thanks for everything… and we might be back soon.
"
217142,25206467,2015-01-09,24663230,Xavier,"The appartement is nice. The big room with the bathroom is really nice. The other one is noisy because of the elevator just behind the wall. Access to the swimming pool and fitness room of the building, very pleasant."
217142,25598898,2015-01-20,24634748,Hung Bang,"Stayed Jan 16 - 19. Autumn was very accomodating and answered all my questions prior to my arrival. Even though she was not available to meet us on Jan 16, she arranged for Christi to meet us. Christi was very helpful explaining the buildings amenities, parking situation, places of interest, restaurants etc. The place looked just as good as they did  in the pictures.

Other people have commented here that the parking stalls are too small. Though they are a little tight, we were able to park our mini van in the stalls without any problems. FYI we saw many people parking their cars over the lines, but from what I understand they will be fined for that offense. 

The only minor issue that I would bring up is that the hot water heater has enough hot water for 2 (maybe 3) people to shower at a time. So our large group had people showering in shifts....other than that no issues what-so-ever with the place. "
217142,25880121,2015-01-28,16664426,Yana,Very nice condo! And friendly host! 
217142,26598562,2015-02-16,25566950,Clara,"We had an amazing time in Seattle, especially because of where we stayed. This place was so nice, clean, convenient, and in such a great location... Blocks from Pike Street. Since we first arrived, the host Autumn was very very helpful in providing tips and super nice! We loved our stay. The neighborhood was safe, and there were many good eating spots and bars near by. I would highly recommend this place! "
217142,28643289,2015-03-28,24135208,Ida Aspaas,"We had such a great time in this awesome apartment! The location in Belltown was perfect with walking distance to Pike's Place, downtown, Space Needle etc, and Autumn was a very welcoming and accommodating host. She'll gladly share her tips on places to eat and see! We would be happy to stay here again on a future visit to Seattle. We were 7 girls staying, and felt we had plenty of space for a shorter stay(3 days) Extra plus for the gym and swimmingpool located in the building! "
217142,29721798,2015-04-12,24713046,Michael,"My family and I very much enjoyed our stay in this fun condo. The spacious and well appointed 2 bedroom was just great. The location was perfect for seeing so much, fun restaurants and night life. Thank you to Autumn for the expert hospitality and assistance. She made it so easy and enjoyable. "
217142,31094989,2015-05-02,22926961,Harry,Unit was exactly as advertised.  Host was super friendly and helpful.  We could not have been more pleased with this rental and experience.    
217142,31761751,2015-05-10,25471927,Karen,Autumn met us at the expected time on the day we checked in.  She was very friendly and informative.  She gave us tips on parking in the garage as the lower side was a tighter fit for our SUV.  Instructions were very concise and thorough for staying at the Condo.  
217142,32311776,2015-05-17,25819818,Meredith,"We Loved the 2 Bedroom Condo! Clean and well stocked with everything we needed.
Autumn is a great host and we enjoyed speaking with her. The location is perfect for walking to the tourist sights like to Pike's Market and The Space Needle. We highly recommend this condo when visiting in Seattle. We would love to come back to stay. "
217142,34648596,2015-06-10,23082467,Yitong,"Autumn was super nice and helpful, and the property was awesome! The neighborhood was the BEST and it was close to everything. We had a really great time there!"
217142,36014107,2015-06-24,31802568,Chris,"Great location, accommodation was of very high standard. Fantastic restaurants nearby"
217142,36356504,2015-06-28,17542968,Michael,Great place for our family trip to Seattle. Thanks. 
217142,36947614,2015-07-03,28636552,Frank,"First, Autumn was very helpful and supportive, accommodating our schedule and our needs. The condo was very attractive and well appointed, and was in an excellent location in the middle of every downtown attraction. We were able to walk to Pike's Place, the Space Needle and Chihouly Museum, and Pioneer Square. Every restaurant we selected, each incredibly good, was also in walking distance."
217142,37821117,2015-07-10,2709146,Alex,Great place. Very clean and very close to some great spots in Seattle. The sofa bed has an air mattress in it so it is very comfortable. Autumn and her associate Reuben were very prompt and responsive. 
217142,49091612,2015-10-01,13318356,Nancy,Autumn was cordial. The location is great for walking to Pike Place Market & the Space Needle.
217142,51114244,2015-10-18,3336310,Terence,"Best airbnb experience I've had yet to date. Everything was clean and ready for us when we arrived.  The listing was very spacious and well decorated. There was plenty of room to fit my group of 7. Loved that there was an in unit washer and dryer and everything in the kitchen and bathrooms (shampoo, body soap, and spare towels). Location was great too! Walking distance to a lot of good restaurants, the space needle, and Pike's Place Market ."
217142,52734917,2015-11-01,24845019,Alexis Marie,Great place! Carpet and beddings felt life they were soaked in Downy for days. It's walkable to everywhere.
217142,54571673,2015-11-22,34945606,Elizabeth,"Loved Autumn!!! She welcomed us with a bottle of wine and gave us the down low we needed to get around and where and what to do. 
We ran into her the second day and she helped us with something in our condo. Loved the condo! Perfect space for 3 girls and nice to just hang out after a long Seattle site seeing day. "
217142,55775020,2015-12-06,30500972,Erin,This was a great location and Autumn was a super host! Place was clean and comfortable. Macrina bakery downstairs was the 'cherry on top'. Autumn had great recommendations from restaurants to routes! Will definitely book again.
217142,58384448,2016-01-02,32845479,Risa,"Autumn is patient, accommodating and very friendly.  She did a great job getting us settled in.  The apt./condo is beautiful.  Our youngest daughter especially loved it and compared it favorably against a major high end hotel we had stayed in just nights before.  Centrally located to so many attractions plus great selections of restaurants just out the door.  We comfortable entertained another family of four @ the condo.  Perfect viewing for New Year's Eve fireworks!  Unfortunately building working on Hot tub so unavailable during our stay and equipt. down in gym so when busy we had to come back but outside Host's control.  Building has beautiful common spaces that AirBnB guests will enjoy.  Really well done guest manual that was very helpful."
5128160,36402441,2015-06-28,17798554,Deidre,"The hosts were prompt and complete in all of their communications with us.  Everything was as described, and we were greeted with a collection of magazines about the area and delicious coffee!  Their home feels like a home, lived in, enjoyed, clean, organized and easy to navigate.  We found everything we needed, cooking utensils, towels etc. We had only only one need that hadn't been previously arranged (because we did not ask), and they took care of it within a few hours.  The hosts were accessible and thoughtful.  The neighborhood is great.  It's charming, easy to get to and close to many yummy places to eat and charming shops to peruse."
5128160,40768898,2015-08-02,32155449,Jennifer,"Clay sent a wonderful, detailed house manual and followed with a phone call to make sure our arrival was smooth. Clay checked in several times during the week to make sure we were comfortable. The house is very lovely in a great location quick to downtown and with plenty of restaurants, shops and parks close by. We were able to get to the downtown attractions in 10 - 15 minutes most mornings. We also walked to a couple of restaurants and a very good coffee shop within a few blocks of the house. We cooked most of our own meals and the kitchen was wonderful, fully stocked with any cooking implement you might need. Our family of 3 adults and 2 children had plenty of room. The house is very child friendly and our kids were easily able to play. Though there isn't air conditioning, we were perfectly comfortable even on the warmer days Seattle was experiencing during our visit. Overall, a great experience and we were sad to leave!"
5128160,41320166,2015-08-07,30114578,Sharon,"This is a beautiful home in a perfect neighborhood.  Neighborhood is quiet and friendly, and walking distance from a cute little suburban downtown with restaurants, small bars, a grocery etc.  Also very close to the funky neighborhood of Fremont.  Easy to get into downtown Seattle.  We didn't use the public transportation but it did look pretty accessible.  The homeowner was very accommodating, and very responsive.  The home itself is large, with a great back deck.  The shower was incredible and had a great view.  I know that's kind of a strange comment for a shower, but trust me.  "
5128160,41928868,2015-08-10,10786910,Cassandra,"The house is so nice and family-friendly! It's on a quiet street, a short drive away from downtown. The front porch was thoroughly enjoyed by our 2-year-old, in addition to the playroom in the basement and the slew of other toys in the house. The house was nicely stocked with everything that you'd need. Grocery stores were within a mile away which made it easy to get things, like milk. There were also ample bed options, which provided privacy for all eight of us in the house. The master bathroom was exquisite with views of downtown Seattle. The house kept cool during our August stay, so we didn't even need A/C! Clay was very responsive and answered my family's many questions. I would definitely recommend that anyone stay in this beautiful home!"
5128160,43033324,2015-08-17,32595566,Ron,"The Nelson Family gives the home and our experience at the home a 12, on a scale from 1 to 10
It was that perfect.  We felt it was
We loved the warmth and coziness of the home.  The Layout was fun and open and slept the 10 of us perfectly
It has space to gather and the bathrooms, especially the one upstairs was heavenly. We would come back just to take a shower
You have to see it to believe how cool
The only negative was on our part.  We should have asked or planned for an extra day or two

"
3263071,14839454,2014-06-27,4335011,Marie,"This listed is as expected. Basic but clean apartment. Good for a few nights if you need to be by UW. Melissa is very nice and efficient. The only thing is the WiFi was very slow at night around 10 and later. I was only surfing the web, not downloading or streaming anything, and it was still a bit slow. Perhaps another router for the building is needed. "
3263071,15459167,2014-07-09,10208119,He,"Melissa is fast in response and very helpful. The place is tidy, spacious and very close to UW. There are lots of restaurants, cafes etc. nearby. Bus stops are close, too. It's close to the main street thus a bit noisy, but with windows closed it's fine."
3263071,16500270,2014-07-28,17553591,Victor,"Melissa's apartment was well maintained when we arrived. The bathroom was stocked with shampoo and body wash, there was right amount of towels for all guest, and bathroom was clean.
The complex is situated in the University district which is a very nice neighbourhood close by Washington University. Its quite quiet and the neighbours are super friendly.
Melissa is very accomodating especially when we called to ask if we could stay past check out time. We thought that was very kind of her :)
Thanks for the hospitality Melissa! "
3263071,17443849,2014-08-12,6136452,Mert,"I stayed a little longer than two weeks spanning July and August in 2014. The room is advertised to have internet connection but, during my stay I experienced very poor internet service. I was provided passwords for two routers. I presume they were being used by multiple people at the apartment complex because that is the only explanation as to why the connection was as slow as dial-up.

I should mention this; we couldn't access YELP website because we got a message saying ""your IP is not allowed to browse YELP"". I do most of my vacation planning on YELP because it provides very valuable information about places to visit. Not being able to access YELP, affected my vacation experience in a very bad way. I had to go to Fedex stores to use internet.

Although I informed the host about this situation several times, she gave me excuses but never actually tried to solve the problem. The root of the problem is that many people are sharing the same internet which leads to slow down. It was her duty as host to provide private and fast connection. 

I feel like she misrepresented her apartment. The trouble she caused me cannot be measured by currency. This was my first time in Seattle and I am not when I will be able to visit again. 

The kitchen was under-equipped. Other than that everything was okay. I don't recommend this place. "
3263071,25711099,2015-01-24,8536412,Antony,"Listing is accurate - it is a clean and mostly quiet apartment in a good location in the U District. Melissa is fast to respond to questions / queries. The downside is the internet - it is very slow in the evenings, even for just email etc.

"
3263071,26024228,2015-02-01,10199904,Wanli,"The place was accurate as listed. The bedroom and bathroom were clean, and the living room was equipped with a big TV. The microwave and refrigerator were very helpful since there were not enough cooking wares and condiments in the kitchen. The WIFI was good enough for browsing websites after I set up the extender provided by the host. When something was out of adjustment, Melissa sent someone to fix it on the following business day. In summary, I would come back again if I need to find a temporarily place to live."
3263071,29216182,2015-04-05,7227015,Samuel,"The apartment worked out great for us. Terrific location, comfortable furnishings, and all amenities accounted for. As others have noted, the wifi remains inconsistent, though it's clear they have been trying to solve the problem (there's a signal booster and multiple available signals). In any case, there are literally a dozen wifi-enabled cafes in the neighborhood."
3263071,30983889,2015-04-30,7943592,Shanthi,"Melissa was a great host! She did everything possible to make sure we had a great stay, and was very accommodating. 
Handover was efficient, with keys left in a dropbox, even though we arrived on a late flight. Everything was spotless and well maintained, exactly as shown on the website. The location is perfect for anyone who wants to be in the U District, and also close to bus stops. The apartment building is quiet and safe. We hope to stay here whenever we return to Seattle.

3263071,35068001,2015-06-15,28699698,Umut,"Kayıtlı yer konusunda verilen tüm bilgiler doğrudur. Evin lokalizasyonu çok iyi. Üniversitenin otobüs durağına 5 dakika yürüme mesafesinde. Bu duraktan 15-20 dakika içinde otobüsle downtown'a ulaşmak mümkün. Üniversite öğrencilerine yönelik cafe, bar ve restoranlar yakın yürüme mesafesinde.İki çocuklu bir ailenin rahatlıkla kalabileceği koşullara sahip. Salon oda ve yatak odası yeterli genişlikte. İki ay süre ile kaldık. Banyo ve mutfak koşulları gayet yeterli, temiz. Güvenli bir mahalle. Apartman kompleksi de sessiz ve güvenli. Ev sahibemiz mesaj ve telefonlara hızla cevap veriyor ve çözüm getiriyor. Güleryüzlü ve yardımsever. Konukseverliği için teşekkür ederiz."
3263071,36116833,2015-06-25,34539852,Marsha,"Melissa is a great host. She is responsive and courteous. The apartment is tricky to find the first time. It is in the corner at the end of a short hallway, but there is a note on the outer door. It is very close to UW, restaurants, and shopping."
3263071,37187220,2015-07-05,27980523,Jeevika,"I rented two apartments from Melissa to host my parents while they visited Seattle, this and another in Ravenna, and Melissa was a good host both times. Descriptions to apartments are accurate. Melissa was mostly quick to respond to any queries or requests. We often needed extra appliances, such as a fan and blender, and she brought them to us promptly, which we greatly appreciated. "
3263071,37895535,2015-07-11,17834878,Kayla,"Melissa's apartment was just what we needed - a place to sleep. It was decently clean and had all the amenities listed and she even offered us the option of renting out a parking space for the duration of our time there. The complex is a little run down and the lack of air conditioning wasn't fun but the fan helped a lot! We only wish she provided another towel. There was two of us but only one towel in the restroom when we got there and only one roll of toilet paper so we had to make a run to Walgreens for more supplies. Overall we had a good stay and would recommend it as a convenient option for roadtrippers like ourselves! Great base for Seattle with a car, we didn't have to take public transportation but a bus stop was close by."
3263071,39611816,2015-07-25,29360569,Ulrich,"The appartment itself is very conveniently located directly in the U-District only a few block away from the Ave with its restaurants, pubs and bookstore. The location is reasonably quiet and the appartment is clean, even though the building itself could use some facelift. After my arrival Melissa did everything to provide missing items, such as a coffee-maker and additional lamp. Also later on she was always very reponsive.  The wifi connection leaves something to be desired. "
3263071,40589409,2015-08-01,34007036,Andrea,"My parents and I stayed at Melissa's apartment for a week and it was great! As tourists we didn't spend much time at the apartment but it had just what we needed: enough space and beds to sleep, a nice equipped kitchen and a bathroom. The apartment is in a really good location; close from the University of Washington and a nice shopping center (University village), a 2 minute walk from the bus stops that will take you downtown (or anywhere) and if you like to walk/run the Burke-Gilman trail is really close. 
Melissa was very attentive, responsive, and accommodating. I would definitely stay in Melissa's apartment again."
3263071,45295128,2015-09-01,39984289,Michael,"The host was incredibly helpful.

For example, I made a mistake in assuming the convention we were going to had a bag check - Melissa put our bags in a spare room she had for the day because we arrived long before the time we were supposed to check in."
3263071,47190750,2015-09-16,42606902,Josiah,"Apartment was clean and spacious. Nice quiet building;  I never heard any noise from any other apartments. The kitchen was well stocked with pans, essentials like tea and salt, appliances etc. 

Really well located, near to several buses, and being in the U District, you can find your way back via buses easily, knowing that you'll end up somewhere nearby. I also noticed a lot of Zipcars nearby; one in the building's parking lot and several on Roosevelt, which could be useful. 

The day before I arrived, I arranged to check in a couple hours earlier than the listing said. I arrived and dropped my stuff, went out with a friend and when we returned the host was in the apartment, panicking in case someone else other than me had let themselves in. The next day I got a text asking if my friend had stayed the night. I don't know where the communication had got confused regarding my arrival time and found the text a little inappropriate and intrusive. 

The biggest drawback was that the wifi was terrible. For a few hours in the middle of the day it was okay but never enough to stream videos and prevented me from doing work. In the evening it was nonexistent. I ended up using 3G or the open network of the hotel next door. 

Overall I had a good stay and would stay here again."
3263071,47381720,2015-09-18,41234672,可语,"The apartment was near uw and the house was clean and comfortable. It's a real good time when I stayed at Melissa's house l,however the Internet didn't work really well."
3922853,23524442,2014-12-03,11887825,Joe,I highly recommend staying with Noel at her homestead.  I stayed there for nearly a month on a business trip and found Noel to be friendly and helpful and respectful of space - in short a very cool person. She also has two very affectionate cats. The home is clean and comfortable and inviting. The neighborhood is quiet yet very close to great restaurants and stores etc. Parking is abundant and the internet service is solid - as a frequent business traveler I value these two things greatly.  I would recommend staying here to anyone.
3922853,24591796,2014-12-31,23383138,Kayla,"Noel was an absolutely fantastic host! She was warm and welcoming and made us feel at home right from the start. She was very accommodating of all of our needs and gave us great tips and advice on all things Seattle. The house is very cozy with well furnished and comfortable rooms. The location is great. Greenwood Ave is a 5 minute walk and it has tons of great restaurants, bars and shops. You are also a two minute walk from a Fred Meyers and a cute little park and only about a mile from Carkeek Park which offers some really beautiful trails and a stunning view of the sound. You are also only a short bike ride away from Greenlake! The cats are adorable and endlessly entertaining. If you aren't a cat person now, you will be after you meet these two cuties. I honestly could not have asked for a better stay. It was a truly great introduction to Seattle. Thank you so much Noel!       "
3922853,27598856,2015-03-08,24740172,Amanda,"Staying with Noel for another week has continued to be great! We've really started to love Greenwood, especially Chaco Canyon cafe and the Green Bean coffee house only a 5 minute walk from her place! She's starting to plant seeds and the place will be blooming with flowers! "
3922853,30552840,2015-04-24,28386606,Rd,"Noel is a really kind host!, She pick up us from and airport and send us back to the airport in the very early morning although she has an important event in that day which need well prepared. That's really thankful.
The accomodating is nice, cocy and happy, we have very good impressing about the stay.
My daughter was scare of the small animal in the past. But after stay with her cat, it seemed she can start to touch and feeling the lovly pet. I am left of Mary by incident.
  
Good luck for her appointment.

3922853,33240136,2015-05-26,14089981,Julie Jia-Fen,"Noel is awesome. This is my family's first trip to Seattle and they told me several times that they really enjoyed the place, better than any hotel they had stayed. The neighborhood is good and the house is cozy. And Mako, the cat, is really adorable. "

3922853,36657231,2015-06-30,29319681,Caz,We recently moved to Seattle and needed a temporary place to stay with our cats while we found an apartment. Noel is awesome and her place was great. We couldn't have asked for a better hostess or welcome to the city.
3922853,38813877,2015-07-19,15004587,Xavier,"J'étais ravi de passer une semaine et demie chez Noel. La maison est bien située, à proximité des services qu'on peut attendre de la ville, et très calme. Noel est une personne particulièrement aimable et dévouée, qui consacre beaucoup d'énergie à faire de sa maison un lieu agréable, tout en laissant la distance qui apporte toute la tranquillité d'un séjour de vacances.

Un excellent choix pour un séjour à Seattle.

--

I was glad to spend one week and a half at Noel's home. The house is well situated, near the services you can expect from the city, and very calm. Noel is a very kind and helpful person in many ways, strongly dedicated to making her home a really nice place to stay at, yet leaving much space.

An excellent choice to stay at Seattle."
3922853,40444724,2015-07-31,7990481,Patrice,"We stayed with Noel for 6 nights. We were able to cook meals when we wanted to, relax after active days, do quick neighborhood shopping trips for anything we needed, and make friends with 2 wonderful home companion cats.  But most unexpected of all, was the viewing of raccoons early in the morning in the neighbor's yard while we drank our morning coffee."
3922853,48984285,2015-09-30,24647578,Kendra,"Noel was awesome! we had so much fun this summer getting to know Seattle and Noel was always so helpful with information and helping us get around. Her kitties are very sweet and our cat got along very well with them. Noel's house is in a very convenient location. Close to grocery, transit, park and the core of Greenwood. We would love to stay with Noel again someday. Highly recommend her AirBNB to anyone."
3922853,50081687,2015-10-09,41810697,Melanie,"Staying with Noel was great!  She was really sweet and accommodating.  She knows a lot about the area and was able to give us a heads up that Obama was in town so that we could avoid traffic.  Also, her cats are awesome!"
3922853,51903122,2015-10-25,29637241,Steve,"Noel did a lovely job making us feel welcome in her home.  She made sure we knew how to find things, had towels and supplies, and gave us space in the refrigerator.  Noel keeps her house very clean and orderly, but makes sure you are comfortable flopping on the couch to read or watch tv.  Her house is very conveniently located to restaurants and shopping, but is in a quiet neighborhood.  She even made sure our dog was happy!"
3922853,53753252,2015-11-12,44516668,Michael," Noel is amazing. He picked us up in the middle of the night from Airport Rentals. I would recommend UBER. But, we could walk to so many places. We used the fire pit and the grill. It felt like staying at home. Thank you for Noel for making my trip so perfect. "
3922853,58117039,2016-01-01,222876,Albert,"Loved our stay! Noel herself was very welcoming, friendly and very helpful. Her cats Mako and Kelly Belly are very cute and as a bonus very patient with our toddler. 

The house felt like home. The kitchen was fully stocked with extra items and equipment to make all meals. It was conveniently located within a five minute walk to two huge grocery stores, several coffee shops, and restaurants. It is also one block away from a playground and a short walk to nearby buses. 

Thank you for our wonderful stay and introduction to beautiful Seattle! "
8088447,53550553,2015-11-09,28568480,Cheri,"We really enjoyed staying at Hannah's apartment! It was very comfortable for our family and we appreciated the convenient location—10min to downtown or UW. The apartment has a lovely view and was very clean and pleasant. Also, Hannah was a superb host. In addition to her welcoming and helpful emails, she provided us with information about restaurants close to the apartment. We had a super experience. "
4951430,26685632,2015-02-17,23516453,Scott,"This is a relatively affordable option in one of Seattle's great neighborhoods, one of the most fun - lower Queen Anne!  The apartment is bigger than it appears in the pictures, and fully comfortable for three adults (if the pullout couch is also used).  Mike made all the necessary arrangements for us, a process that was smooth despite him traveling outside the country at the time.  He was also responsive to and quick to answer email and texts to solve small problems that came up along the way.  Summary: a good option for someone on a budget, given the reasonable price."
4951430,40159237,2015-07-28,37849451,Timothy,"Michael is an exceptional host, blending friendly advice and city exploring tips with a hands off experience that allows for privacy. His space is clean, well decorated, and in a great neighborhood with easy accessibility to restaurants, nightlife, and the space needle attractions. I would recommend his place without any reservation.  "
4951430,41542039,2015-08-07,27387287,Erika,"Michael was beyond super rad! When my boyfriend and I needed a place extremely last minute, he responded straight away for a same day reservation.  He was super welcoming and gave helpful tips on the city (buses, attractions etc) He checked in via text everyday, just to make see if we needed anything. House was clean, and had the essentials."
4951430,41557641,2015-08-07,40550502,Joshua,"Michael was great.  He was super accommodating and was willing to pick us up anywhere in the city and give us tips about Seattle.  He was also very responsive.  The apartment was in a great location in Lower Queen Anne, and my girlfriend and I were able to walk to the Seattle Center (Space Needle) and to bars and restaurants downtown and on the water pretty easily.  The unit itself was a little old, but it was a great stay for the price.  Would definitely recommend for people traveling on a budget!"
4951430,42060600,2015-08-10,1600897,Matt,"Michael was super helpful when we got there, telling us about all the nightlife and attractions nearby the apartment and the best way to get to them. The apartment was great a nice 1 bed and bath with a living room with a futon. Beds were nice, linens were clean. The apartment is located right in Queen Anne so it's super easy to get around. Parking is plentiful and free one block from the apartment. Great stay, would come back again!"
4951430,44863609,2015-08-29,7140935,Jonathan,"This is a great place to stay. I came up to Seattle for a short trip since I am moving up there and wanted a good central location to look at apartments in the neighborhood and was really glad I stayed at Michael's apartment.

He was very flexible in when I could check in and check out, had the place extremely clean (and fun--I love all the decorations in the apartment). And the location is terrific. Right in Queen Anne so you are close to a lot of good restaurants, downtown, etc...

I would recommend anyone to stay here."
4951430,45216814,2015-08-31,16884723,Zachary,"Michael was super accommodating, helpful, and just a swell guy. The pad was absolutely perfect...had some style (love the tiki art and cool bar top) and was in an awesome location. absolutely no negatives on this trip."
4951430,46967165,2015-09-14,43031680,Julie,"Michael was a fantastic host. He was not bothered by our late arrival time. He even picked me up at the train station! 

My son and his friend were moving to Seattle. We needed a place to stay while we looked for an apartment. Michael's place was perfect. It's in a great location. We were able to walk from there to check out the different neighborhoods. Everything we needed was close by including a grocery store.

I would highly recommend Micheal's apartment to anyone staying in Seattle."
4951430,49276954,2015-10-02,31756086,Amy,Michael was a very welcoming host!  Was even able to pick us up from the airport and let us stay at his apartment on very short notice.  It was a comfortable place to stay and a great location with coffee shop & grocery nearby and the Seattle Center a very short walk
4951430,50242583,2015-10-10,23263695,Shane,"I would highly recommend Michael’s apartment, really spacious and relaxing. Everything you’d need is just around the corner and downtown is only a short walk. Michael was really nice and super chilled and really helped me out at very short notice."
4951430,52173453,2015-10-26,11690481,Unique,Host is helpful and the apartment was a deal. 
4951430,53546387,2015-11-09,47709824,Aiko,Michael was a very good host. He was very thorough about everything that was needed to know about the apartment. He was very good about booking on such a short notice. I would definitely stay here again!
4951430,54267453,2015-11-17,47674974,Nicholas,"We had an amazing time in Seattle, the apartment was beautiful and clean. Will definitely stay here again!!!"
3123632,16137579,2014-07-22,54807,Tom,"Glen's place was wonderful. Roomy and sensible.  The oversize bed in his bedroom was incredibly comfortable, and everything in the bedroom/bathroom were perfect.  The upstairs kitchen and sitting room (with a lovely deck) were perfect for morning breakfast.  And there's another room and bathroom, just for variety.  And Glen's neighborhood is about as perfect a place to discover Seattle and wander as there is in fabulous Seattle.  There's nothng you can't find within an easy walk of his house.  And Glen is pleasant, helpful, and totally accommodating.  We can't recommend his place more highly."

3123632,18890773,2014-09-02,8054384,Christine,"Glen's condo was fantastic.  It was clean, spacious,  and beautifully designed and furnished.  Capitol Hill was a fun and vibrant neighborhood with excellent food. There were fantastic restaurants mere blocks from the condo. Getting to downtown Seattle was also a breeze. You can take a leisurely walk or hop on a bus to be downtown in minutes. 

Glen was a fantastic and responsive host. We had a wonderful time! "
3123632,19565923,2014-09-14,16622324,Nirmal,"Great location-close to lots of restaurants and bars but it's on a quiet street with no noise at night.
Apartment was as described - very spacious with an awesome patio.
Glen was easy to communicate with to obtain the key/wifi etc. Would love to stay again next time I am in Seattle."
3123632,37895302,2015-07-11,2648648,John And Brando,"Great capitol hill location. It's Glens actual place so it is well decorated, has everything to cook with, a master suite with A/C & comfortable bed. Dining table, cable, outdoor deck & a parking spot in the underground garage were xtra's. Nice place and they are always checking in to see if you need anything. I recommend Glens place!"
3123632,43917846,2015-08-23,5158957,Danielle,This apartment was absolutely perfect! Located in the best part of Seattle with great proximity to bars and restaurants. The apartment was clean and well furnished with everything you could need for your stay. The outdoor space was the best place to enjoy the beautiful Seattle evenings. I highly recommend this apartment!
157939,914300,2012-02-11,122255,Tamara,"Jennifer's place was fabolous! This spot is luxury and comfort all wrap into one. The bedroom, living room and kitchen are spacious and the decor is perrfect. I'm an extremely clean person, and this place is ""spotless"". I'd recommend this bungalow to anyone seeking quiet style and luxury! The host is personable and responsive. Her and Phil are a match made in heaven. God bless both of them. Thank you so much for your hospitality and privacy.
Tamara"
157939,1207130,2012-05-01,122255,Tamara,"Jennifer is a wonderful host! Both her and her partner Phil are perfect hosts. Their garden is blooming with wild & unique flowers; their property is well maintained in West Seattle. Their place of peace is pleasant and esthetically pleasing. The privacy is unmatched, and Jennifer provides a nice bunch of flowers to the space. I've enjoyed my stays whether short-term or long you should pass up this space. Terrific balance of style, luxury, and tranquility for the PRICE! Best adventure in town. Can't wait to join them at the end of the summer!!
Thanks, Jennifer 
"
157939,5295213,2013-06-23,2713343,Bonita,Delightful hosts.  Charmingly and comfortably furnished.  Beautiful flowers to greet us with fresh ones provided during our stay. Location very good for downtown and south.   A lot of space.  
157939,6144425,2013-08-01,4624108,Todd,"We had such a wonderful time while staying at Jennifer's Bungalow!   The apartment was comfortable, quiet, beautifully decorated and immaculately maintained.  Jennifer and Phil went out of their way to ensure our comfort and privacy, and even shared vegetables with us from their organic gardens.  We rented the unit for a month while visiting family and friends in Seattle, and it was a perfect retreat during our busy holiday.  Nestled into a quiet West Seattle residential community that has easy access to the city's amenities, I would recommend Jennifer's Bungalow to anyone who is looking for a peaceful stay in a beautiful location."
157939,11620786,2014-04-09,13066420,Jean,"We stayed for a week to be close to our daughter who lives in West Seattle. Jennifer's  location was convenient, so we thought that we'd try AIRBNB.  We couldn't have had a more positive experience.  We had a living room, bedroom kitchen, bath and even a laundry room and all were immaculate and well-appointed, especially with Jennifer's paintings.  Jennifer and Phil gave us privacy, but we also had some great conversations with them.  We can't recommend the small apartment more highly and we will definitely stay there when we visit again.  "
157939,11996352,2014-04-21,892040,Emily,"We had a really great stay at the Artist's Apartment!  Jennifer and Phil are such gracious hosts, respecting our privacy but available when we had a question or need.  They grow the most beautiful flowers in their garden, and we happened to be there during peak tulip season.  Jennifer put incredible bouquets of exotic tulips in every room of the apartment--such a sweet touch!  We were there for a wedding, and they really made sure we had everything we needed to prep and preen beforehand (mirror, blow dryer, iron, coffee grinder!).  
A very quick drive away is an excellent grocery store, a beautiful park, and the ferry for travels across the water.  It's super convenient, while still feeling quiet and away from the Seattle hustle which is what we wanted this time. Oh--and if you need a rental car there is an Enterprise literally a block away.  

Jennifer also invited us to visit her in her on-site studio where we saw her incredible artwork and learned a bit more about our two hosts.  All in all, these easy-going, attentive hosts will make sure your stay with them is a delight.  Thanks Jennifer and Phil, you helped make this visit special!"
157939,13646150,2014-06-02,1789515,Dmitry,"We had just an amazing time at Jens and Phils  apartment! They were great hosts, very respectfull! Thanks guys! 
All the best!"
157939,14240465,2014-06-15,15768919,Brian,"We had an excellent experience with Jennifer. She made us feel welcome by putting fresh flowers in all the rooms, and greeting us personally. During the week, she brought us to her favorite coffee house, and we met many of her friends. The first day we were there, when we had just come back from the store, but had forgotten bath soap, she and her partner Phillip provided excellent liquid soap for us. The apartment was everything it was described to be. The bed was comfortable, the kitchen well-stocked with utensils, etc. We took advantage of sitting in the garden when we could, and she has a lovely garden. We would be happy to return again!"
157939,14788420,2014-06-26,16128427,Derek,"What a great experience!  Jennifer and Phil were perfect hosts, and there combined expertise is evident in the apartment!  The space is clean, relaxing, and well appointed.  The bed was very comfortable (and we are picky) The shower was strong and hot.  A perfect  space to recharge after a day of sightseeing - Thanks again!"
157939,15153681,2014-07-03,6814589,Luis,"Jennifer and Philip are both very friendly hosts, made us feel at home, and provided a immaculately clean place to stay.  The apartment has very comfortable spaces and features her beautiful paintings on the walls. The careful attention to detail in every room is impressive.  We would love to come back to Seattle and stay with them another time.  Thank you Jennifer and Philip. "
157939,15392874,2014-07-08,1922173,Mark,"Jennifer and Phil were most welcoming!  The apartment is very charming and very conveniently located in West Seattle.  It is large and very well equipped.  They have included loads of brochures, maps, and the like to guide your visit to Seattle."
157939,19918787,2014-09-21,7939866,Katherine,"My husband and I booked Jennifer and Phil's artist apartment after a six month sabbatical overseas. It was wonderful to come back to Seattle to such a warm and inviting space. The apartment is tastefully decorated and includes Jennifer's art as well as flowers from her garden which gave it a feeling of being more like a home than a simple landing spot. 
Jennifer and Phil are wonderful hosts. It was a pleasure to get to know them. We would definitely recommend this accommodation to our friends and family. "
157939,21649158,2014-10-21,7939866,Katherine,We just completed our stay at Jennifer and Phil's Artist apartment. What a delightful experience. The accommodation was exactly what we were looking for and our hosts were wonderful. We look forward to keeping in touch with Jennifer and Phil. 
157939,23358872,2014-11-30,8688359,Caroline,"My classmate and I needed a place to stay in Seattle for a month while on an internship/rotation. Jennifer and Phil's place was in our price range and a close commute for me so we chose it. Jennifer was incredibly helpful before we arrived and welcomed us graciously when we got to Seattle  (it was our first time in the city). The apartment is completely private with its own entrance to allow us to come and go as we please. It had all the amenities we needed for a months stay including a comfortable bed, wifi, cable, and a fully stocked kitchen. We were just about two blocks from the bus which brought us to and from downtown easily and conveniently. The neighborhood itself was quiet and safe with a grocery store, pharmacy, and Starbucks just a few minutes walk away. I would recommend this stay for anyone! It was private and comfortable and the hosts were wonderful! Thank you Jennifer and Phil for a wonderful first time stay in Seattle!"
157939,24584497,2014-12-31,22159170,Tricia,"I stayed at Jennifer & Phil's for a month with my husband and my 5 month-old daughter, and I can't say enough good things about our experience. The apartment is even nicer than it appears in the photos! Jennifer's artwork is amazing and they have included many thoughtful touches to make your stay a pleasant one. Though it is a basement apartment, there was plenty of space for us and it gets lots of daylight. Overall, a lovely and cozy space that we looked forward to retiring to each evening.

The neighborhood is great, with several stores including a Walgreen's and a fantastic coffee shop within walking distance, and several restaurants and grocery stores are short drive or bus ride away.

Jennifer and Phil were the most gracious hosts. Jennifer was readily available to answer questions and to make helpful recommendations about what to check out in the area, yet we also had total privacy during our stay. I would most happily stay here again if returning to Seattle!"
157939,25567140,2015-01-19,23952903,Garron,Jennifer and her husband were very gracious and welcoming hosts.  The spaces are exactly as shown.  My wife and I felt AT HOME and we were able to sleep well.  This was a working trip for us so we were gone early and home late.  Having a pleasant space to land made our trip very enjoyable and helped us.
157939,32007715,2015-05-12,19112764,Lucy,"It was such a wonderful time staying with Jennifer, the house is beautiul and clean. Jennifer  was welcoming, warm and caring, I am look forward to seeing her again for my next visit!"
157939,32537277,2015-05-19,31107549,James,"This place is great! Its a wonderful space that feels nice and cozy, offers quick access to the bus line, and is in a neat little part of Seattle. I stayed with a friend of mine, and there was plenty of room for two people. All the rooms were clean and stocked upon arrival. If it looks good in a picture, it'll look just as good in person. Jennifer and her husband are both extremely nice people, and give their guest plenty of space and privacy. However, that doesn't mean they're not around when needed. My friend needed a coffee grinder during our stay, and they were able to quickly lend us one. I don't have a single poor thing to say about my time at the house. If you need a space to stay, and want something that is a little away from the hustle and bustle of Seattle proper, I can't think of a better space to stay in then this. "
157939,39598419,2015-07-25,2373265,Jennifer,"We had a wonderful stay at Jennifer's apartment.  The space was beautifully decorated, and very clean and cozy (probably the most comfortable bed I've ever slept in!).  The apartment was also well supplied with everything we needed.  It is very easy to get from this location to downtown and Seattle Center, and even the beach.  We would stay again in a heartbeat!"
157939,41315914,2015-08-07,8989240,Holly,"Jennifer was an excellent host. She greeted us the night of our arrival, even though we arrived quite late, and was helpful with maps, advice and internet assistance throughout our stay. She also gave us fresh flowers for the apartment and some wonderful figs!

The apartment is as described. It is decorated with some beautiful paintings done by Jennifer, and with other artistic touches. The apartment is well supplied and the bed is comfortable. On hot days it stays cool, but on cooler days it is a bit chilly in the mornings.  There is a space heater, however, that can warm up a room. 

The West Seattle neighborhood and location are great. Downtown Seattle is easily accessible, and California Street, just a few blocks away from the apartment, has grocery stores, restaurants, coffee shops and some interesting stores. 

We very much enjoyed our stay, and hope to return next summer. "
157939,42404043,2015-08-13,102084,Sharon,"Our stay at Jennifer's apartment was the best Airbnb experience we've ever had.  The apartment is simply perfect - spacious, comfortable, and extremely clean.  Jennifer & Phil are the best hosts ever, friendly and helpful.  The location, while a bit out of central Seattle, was easy to navigate.  We were able to walk to the shuttle for the water taxi to downtown Seattle and easily caught the bus back to a block away.  Another plus is Jennifer's amazing artwork hung throughout the apartment.  She is truly a gifted artist.  We loved our stay."
157939,55358077,2015-12-01,3790897,Ashley,"Staying in Jennifer and Phil's apartment has been a wonderful experience on several levels. Jennifer is very conscientious about ensuring your privacy yet extremely welcoming. When we arrived we immediately felt at home. Since we were staying for a month, it was great to be in such a cozy, well decorated and well supplied space. We had all the kitchen items we needed and then some, very easy access to laundry and a comfortable living room. Lastly,  Jennifer and Phil were always incredibly responsive and proactive with any issues.  

We also enjoyed the neighborhood greatly. It's very easy access to the Junction in West Seattle as well as buses downtown. We will miss this space very much and would highly recommend it for a longer stay or a short trip. "

I didn't have a set itinerary for my trip, and Jenn has a handy book full of suggestions for things to do in the city. I highly recommend her if you are planning to visit Seattle. Thanks Jenn, you were great!"

Ideal location, killer view, super comfy cozy tidy home, and as if all those weren't enough -- PARKING (an absolute godsend for this local in Seattle!!). Although I never actually met Jenn in person (I was there for just one night and out super late), her communication via email, text, and hand written notes was very prompt, friendly, informative, and totally made me feel welcome. All the little extras (like the fat 3ring binder with intro note and local info) were totally above and beyond other airbnb experiences I've had! And -- the bed was a dream! I'm really picky, honestly, and Jenn's place is my #1 pick for my next trip to Seattle! "
3039438,13776544,2014-06-03,529196,Mary,"Jenn was great, and her place is fabulous! Great area, views of the water, very walkable! Very comfy bed. Jenn is friendly and helpful: I would stay with her again, and highly recommend her!"

Also, the bed is very comfortable."

Would highly recommend to anyone visiting Seattle.

Will be staying there again."

Her place was just as described within a short walk to the Seattle Center, the waterfront, and everything downtown Seattle has to offer. We enjoyed watching the morning boats with a cup of coffee on the balcony before starting our day. I highly recommend a stay at this airbnb."
3039438,22579310,2014-11-10,1197435,Jason,"We needed a place near Pikes Market, with a parking spot AND allowed dogs. Impossible right? Nope. This place had all of that and worked out great! There's also an amazing view of the sound from the bedroom. "
3039438,23103388,2014-11-23,3999140,Pascale,"Locating this airbnbs was a breeze! Jenn's instructions were detailed and easy to follow. I found the parking garage and unit with ease. The apartment was clean and well appointed. And the view!!! Can't beat that! Jenn was easy to contact and always in communication. If/when I come back to Seattle, I'll definitely be staying here!"

The place has killer views of The Sound, and it's in walking distance of tasty restaurants (Jenn makes great recommendations), and cool bars. The place itself is comfortable, quiet, easy to get to, secure, and basically leaves you wanting for nothing. Just stop looking and stay here!"
7917718,43727670,2015-08-21,16543514,Jamie,"Michael and Steve were fantastic hosts! He was overly flexible with my check in time and provided a comfortable stay. Wallingford is a beautiful neighborhood and centrally located. Having formerly lived in Seattle, I was looking for a comfortable stay in a familiar area and Michael provided just that. They had well-behaved dogs and were friendly company. I would definitely stay here again if I came back to visit and recommend it to anyone!"
7917718,44058759,2015-08-23,40334821,Aaron And Jasmine,This was the perfect place for us to stay on our brief visit for a wedding. Michael had great communication prior to our arrival and we felt welcome and comfortable in his beautiful home. 5 stars! We would definitely stay again!
7917718,44716161,2015-08-28,41216737,Anna,We had the greatest time at Michael's and Stephens! Tons of good memories to take back to Germany! (:  The room is lovingly decorated and very comfy. Their dogs are the best!!! And spending time with the two of them was fun. They have a lot of good suggestions what to do and where to go to around Seattle and made our stay special! Will hopefully come back one day! (:
7917718,44876763,2015-08-29,42705711,Kacie,"Michael was a fantastic host. He and his roommate were beyond welcoming, the home and room are beautiful, everything I could have wanted/needed was right there for use (instructions included!), even the dogs were ridiculously friendly!! Michael was more than communicative throughout the entire process, letting me know that the room was ready early, etc. Nothing but a great experience here."
7917718,45322233,2015-09-01,40762006,Lisanne,"We had a great stay at Michael's home! The room is really nice and clean, just like the bathroom, and just like it's shown in the pictures. Michael and Steve (and all of the dogs) were so friendly and gave us good advices about what to see in the city. Additionally one can get really fast and easily into the city center with the bus, which made it their house nice starting point to explore Seattle."
7917718,45718660,2015-09-05,42162096,Daniel,"Great neighborhood, great room."
7917718,45865630,2015-09-06,29295785,Katherine,"Michael's house in Wallingford was absolutely wonderful and very accessible, and the room was just as pictured - adorable! Michael and his roommate were both very welcoming and willing to share their recommendations and experiences in Seattle! "
7917718,46793829,2015-09-13,42762670,Elizabeth,"I had a great stay at Michael and Steve's place!  The room was just as pictured, and the neighborhood had lots to do and offered easy access to many parts of the city.  The dogs were cute, too!"

7917718,49914204,2015-10-07,31975967,Peter,"Michael and the dogs were a joy to spend time with - it's a great, warm, welcoming house in a perfect location.  Room was quiet and private.  I really loved staying there for over a week - a perfect long stay spot."
7917718,53178899,2015-11-06,5741939,David,"Michael was a seriously awesome dude.  He was super chill, warm and welcoming, and always down to shoot the shit.  Same goes for his cool roommate Steve and their two awesome girlfriends.  They are deep into the Seattle biking scene and also know their coffee.

Their three dogs are super playful and the house is warm and trendy.  Rather perfect location for the entire north side.  What more is there to say?"
7917718,53561231,2015-11-09,18499407,David,"Michael and his roommate were great hosts both extremely helpful and chill guys with great recommendations on the neighborhood.  All the information was clear and Michael responded promptly.  
Everything was as pictured in the advertisement and in a great neighborhood.  
Thanks for an awesome weekend!

7917718,53933016,2015-11-14,31368786,Cesar,"Great neighborhood, nice room, amazing location, very close to the UW. Michael and Steve were very friendly, always trying to share recommendations and experiences. The dogs are playful and social.
Great experience."
7917718,54531335,2015-11-21,29991927,Emilee,"Michael and Steven go above and beyond.  It's hosts like this that make it preferable to do air Bnb over staying in a hotel, not only for the cost benefit, but also for the social aspect of being able to take in a city the way a local does. 

The room/house is clean, cozy, and well decorated.  All amenities are covered and they pay attention to the details.  The neighborhood has lots within walking distance and downtown is an easy and cheap bus ride.  "
7917718,55860142,2015-12-06,11982887,Katherine,"Michael & Steve have a great spot in Wallingford. Parking was easy to find and I enjoyed having Lake Union and the University of Washington nearby. The room was COLD when I first arrived, but their space heater is epic and had the room toasty in less than 20 mins. The assortment of coffee accoutrements in the kitchen were also favorite. Internet worked great and I appreciated the towels, shampoo & conditioner. "
7917718,57581798,2015-12-27,51136298,Letitia,"Perfect location-- close to UW and most Seattle neighborhoods. The room/house was clean, well-decorated, and quiet throughout the day; amenities provided were more than those of a typical hotel. Michael and Steven were very friendly and gracious to host me over the holiday season."
7917718,58231559,2016-01-01,23348236,Sylvia,"Awesome stay, very good location. 10mins drive from Downtown Seattle. Easy to find a parking.  Big thanks to Micheal and Steve~~~Happy New Year!"
2979387,18368054,2014-08-25,20107535,Audrey,"Perfect house; perfect host!  The house is an immaculate Arts & Crafts charmer with much of the original flavor left intact.  The layout provides cozy common area spaces, while also allowing for lots of privacy, especially the master suite upstairs.  As for the area, a seemingly endless supply of wonderful restaurants and shops were very close by, as was access to the interstate.  

Everything needed for a carefree time away from home was provided by our sweet host, Kim...everything from fluffy towels to fine local coffee for our morning roasts.  Kim was the right combination of extremely attentive and respecting of privacy.  She responded to each contact immediately and professionally.

I cannot say enough about our stay at this lovely home and its host.  Don't miss out on a wonderful opportunity!"
2979387,20453860,2014-09-29,16969698,Lauren,"The home was beautiful. All of the proper amenities were available, including a few extras we weren't expecting (coffee, fruit and even a few beers! ). The beds were comfortable enough and the neighborhood wasn't too busy, which made the street noise less noticeable. It was within walking distance of everything we wanted to do in the university district. Overall we had a lovely stay."
2979387,21159985,2014-10-12,21803716,Susan,The location was convenient and the house was well equipped. It proved a great size for our group of 9. Enjoyed our stay!
2979387,21984468,2014-10-27,22502903,John,"This home was fantastic. It was very comfortable and the owner was very accommodating, even gave us food to eat. Internet was fast! (30Mbps) and food was only two blocks away. Would definitely recommend anyone to stay here and would stay here personally again."
2979387,24418700,2014-12-28,9153032,Stephen,"Our family (5 adults) had a nice, week's stay at this cozy - if a little funky - house.  There were quite a few thoughtful, extra touches: muffins left the day of check-in,  coffee (machine, filters and ground coffee), and an electric water heater for tea, plenty of towels, and games for the visiting grand children. 
The home was clean and looked to also be newly painted with new carpets. No dressers in the bedrooms, but a few drawers in two of the three closets. Off-street parking for 4 cars was helpful. (No dishwasher, but we didn't mind.) The location was convenient if a little funky and on the borderline of sketchy. (Anyone been to the Mission District in San Francisco lately?)
We would definitely stay there again. "
2979387,24784066,2015-01-02,25150369,Winster,It's a really comfortable house and really close to downtown Seattle! Pretty awesome and convenient for travelers like us to live.
2979387,25306665,2015-01-12,10565251,Jason,Great house. Tons of room and all necessary amenities. Felt like being at home. Great location that is close to the university and the 5 freeway. Plenty of off street parking and big backyard that would be great in the summer. Host was highly communicative and even left inflatable bed for our use. 
2979387,27994642,2015-03-16,17768787,Marna,Our family loved this location! This little house was a perfect fit for our big group! Kim was a great help! We had a wonderful time!
2979387,34279178,2015-06-07,1107330,Jenny,"I stayed at Kim's for 3 nights for a bachelorette trip with 5 others. The place was clean, well-lit, and nicely decorated -- just as pictured :) The kitchen was already equipped with the basics (plates, bowls, spices, etc) so we had one fun night of staying in to cook. Wifi was fast but you have to log in with a code every time. 

What really impressed me was how quickly Kim responded to my queries. I had several questions leading up to and during my stay and each time, she responded right away! 

Overall, we had a pleasant and unforgettable stay and would definitely recommend this space for groups and families. "
2979387,34800475,2015-06-12,32256271,Jeroen,This is not a nice house to stay in. It’s old. A lot of the furniture is damaged and it smells awful. Also the neighborhood is not nice (lot of homeless people). It’s far to expensive for it’s worth.
2979387,35057394,2015-06-15,11667799,Becky,"When we checked in, there were muffins waiting for us. Thank you Kim! The house was beautiful. Well maintained and comfortable.  Groceries, restaurants and other services were within easy walking distance, as well as a wonderful farmers market. The University district as well as Fremont and Ballard were easily accessible. I would definitely rent this property again."
2979387,35630395,2015-06-21,19734938,Bryan,"We had a great stay -- house was convenient and matches the description. Quaint home located near Uni of Washington (walking distance). 

Host was very responsive to our questions (we had no issues -- just a couple general questions). 

Overall this was a fantastic stay. 
"
2979387,38974919,2015-07-20,22117962,Ruth,Hosts responded very promptly to questions. House served 7 of us well. 
2979387,40721216,2015-08-02,31019639,Robert,"The house mostly met our needs. It was clean and perfectly decorated. Everything there matches with what the host describes in the ad.  We were happy with our stay in the house.
If it was not too hot, which is unusual in Seattle, it would be better.
"
2979387,42262540,2015-08-12,9987352,Karl,"Because we had some things delivered before our arrival, Kim was super helpful in ensuring that the things would be safe.  

There were some things missing in the home and Kim was quickly responsive in making sure to correct the problems."
2979387,48545424,2015-09-27,41459868,Meredith,This house was so cozy and close to everything! We loved staying at this house!
2979387,57759031,2015-12-29,8031876,Barbara,"We enjoyed our stay.  The home was in a good location - walking distance to Trader Joe's, Safeway, Walgreen's, a playground, and many local eateries.    Worked well for two young families.   Kim answered our questions promptly and allowed an early check-in, which was very helpful.   Off-street parking was very helpful, since there's a two-hour limit on the street outside the home."
208670,920011,2012-02-13,607714,Natnaal,"I had a wonderful stay at David's bungalow. The location was the highlight of my stay. It was only one block from Broadway, next to many restaurants, cafes & shops. At the same time, the bungalow was in a very quite area. The unit has everything you need, utensils, towels, extra sheets, washer/dryer etc. There was also a little loft that I didn't get to use but a real nice area to take a nap or read a book. The WiFi works great and the he has DirecTv with all the channels whenever you want to stay in. I would definitely recommend this place and would love to stay here again in the future. "
208670,1419289,2012-06-05,1742978,Tim,"Nice condo in a vibrant and creative part of Seattle. Good access to whole city. Capitol Hill is full of restaurants and shops, most of which are a couple blocks away. Broadway is a busy street, but this condo is very quiet. On street parking was no problem. David and partner were very responsive and helped to make our stay very successful."
208670,1649541,2012-07-07,307168,Jennifer,"I stayed here with my son and we were instantly at home. It was truly hard to leave. Every aspect of the experience, from the key exchange, to the location, to the cleanness of the space was perfect - absolutely the best experience I've had with any rental hands down!

I hope to stay here again! (and again).
- Jennifer"
208670,1899229,2012-08-06,2446825,Yolande,"We had a wonderful stay in this cozy bungalow with it's modern vibe within a very authentic setting. We were lucky to have fantastic, sunny, warm weather during the first week of August, and we enjoyed sitting out in the lush garden eating breakfast and lunch. The house is very comfortable, light and cheerful with colorful accents and everything you need for being totally self catering. The neighborhood is great, with lost of nice places to shop and eat, lovely parks to walk in and the people were all really friendly. We had a very satisfying week in Seattle and we would certainly book this property again next visit."
208670,2177220,2012-09-03,2657821,Josh,"Place was nice, clean and the location was stellar. If you want a place that is easy to take public transit too, but at the same time not need to leave the neighborhood, this is a great option."
208670,4435428,2013-05-05,5376997,Chad,"I really enjoyed myself at David's place. It was a great place to stay and very convenient to the Broadway shopping and dining. I loved the fact the grocery store was a block away and Starbucks was just around the corner. The bungalow was very cute, comfortably furnished, and had everything I needed. Really, the only downside of staying here was the parking situation. Up until 6pm was usually ok since David provided a neighborhood zone parking permit. But trying to find parking between 6pm and 9pm usually meant having to park several blocks away or pay at the parking garage on Broadway. I would definitely stay here again and recommend it to other people."
208670,4565370,2013-05-13,4199518,Gillian,"We enjoyed our stay at David's place. It's situated around an idyllic courtyard with nice neighbors. It was a totally do-able walk from downtown and close to tons of restaurants. The grocery store is a 2 min walk, which was very convenient! The kitchen provided all of the cooking/eating implements we needed while we were there. I recommend his place to everyone!"

208670,6652216,2013-08-20,5397733,David,"Great little place in a fantastic location.  I was in town for the entire summer working and the bungalow was just perfect.  The grocery store is literally around the block, there was everything needed to cook, and the place has DirecTV and internet all included.  I would stay again."
208670,7571308,2013-09-24,583410,Mee-Sun,"David was an awesome host - very responsive, and accommodated our last minute booking! Checking in and checking out was very easy.

The place is in a great location. It's on a side street so it's quiet and peaceful, but it is very close to a ton of restaurants and things to do. We walked everywhere!

I stayed here with one other friend, and we had a ton of room. The kitchen is great and well-stocked.

The only minor note is that the bed is quite soft for my taste - but that's subjective.

I would definitely stay here again, and would recommend you to as well."
208670,7744131,2013-10-01,1481972,Amber,The bungalow was the perfect vacation spot! Clean and welcoming inside and out. Getting around Seattle from here was a breeze. Lots of great local shops and restaurants within walking distance. Felt at home instantly and would stay here again!
208670,7919122,2013-10-08,6308193,Pamela,"Wonderful!!!!!! The bungalow is in the best location and is just lovely.  I would rate it a 10 plus plus!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"
208670,8215605,2013-10-21,4306733,Sahil,"The bungalow off Broadway was perfect for visiting Seattle. The neighborhood had lots of excellent food choices and David's loft had everything we needed for our group of 5 (4 adults + 1 child). We had a wonderful time in Seattle, in large part thanks to David!"
208670,8412246,2013-10-29,3895965,Maria,"Cozy place just as described in a great neighborhood. We stayed for 3 nights while vacationing with a family of 5.  The location is near most major visitor points.  We used a rental car and had no problem getting to where we wanted to go within a 15 minute drive. We noticed access to public transportation in the vicinity so that would be a good option too.  Plenty of shops and restaurants in the area.  
The place was clean and stocked with linens and towels. The bed was comfortable and the loft area as well but does require a steep climb to use. We ate out all the time but you can definantely make use of the kitchen as it has all the utensils needed. 
David was very attentive and although there were no issues any time we emailed him we had a quick responds.  I would return to this place and arecommend this cute bungalow to anyone. 
"
208670,8848078,2013-11-21,7379920,Alissa,"Just the cutest place ever! Right off Broadway- so close to restaurants, coffee, yoga, the grocery store, everything! Very quiet, comfortable and fun! I would stay there again and recommend the place. They allowed us to have our Yorkie and there are not many places that will take dogs in the Capitol Hill area. "
208670,8982452,2013-11-30,1355757,Di,"Three other friends and I stayed at the bungalow for a Thanksgiving in Seattle. And we had a wonderful time! The location is amazing - super convenient to a grocery store and lots of cafe & restaurants in the Capital hill area. Walking to downtown is about 15-20min and it's a fun walk with lots of shops around too. I loved being able to go for a morning run in the neighborhood (Volunteer park is only a couple blocks away!). 

Also, the host left some food and drinks in the fridge and it made our transition into the city a lot easier too! Overall this place is amazing and we would definitely go back! =)"
208670,9957981,2014-01-21,4679273,Peter,"Good location, but the apartment was not very clean. Lots of old food left in the refrigerator, and it was clear the sheets had not been washed. Easy process, but seemed as though it hadn't been cleaned since the last guest!"
208670,10676634,2014-03-03,4112570,John,"Comfortable, quiet, and located in an ideal part of Capitol Hill. "

208670,12007045,2014-04-21,11017342,Scott,"The Bungalow is a fantastic place to stay. Comfy and set back of an already quiet street so it's nice and quiet. We five stayed there for a long weekend, and it fit us well. In all, it's probably better for two couples than for five individuals, but that's a bit nit-picky. The place was clean and well stocked, save for a lack of cooking utensils (pots, pans, etc.) which I think would be really desirable for longer stays.

Two thumbs up to David and Family!"
208670,12249867,2014-04-27,8363432,Tyler,"We rented David's place while we were in Seattle for a specialty coffee conference at the Washington State Convention Center. It was very well located, with a ton of restaurants and cafés nearby -- and within walking distance of downtown. The place itself was very cool, cozy, clean and comfortable. Highly recommended. "

208670,14337488,2014-06-17,12213118,Paula,"Great location, stayed for a long weekend for my sister in laws wedding. Able to walk to stores, shopping, etc. Nice and clean, the only thing I wish was that there were hand towels. They just had bath towels. "
208670,14581341,2014-06-22,16699620,Laura,"There's not much to add beyond the glowing praise the other reviewers have already given this flat. The layout of the space was perfect, everything was in great condition, and the location was ideal, both for walking around and to get to the U. Washington. It was a terrific stay."
208670,14938640,2014-06-29,611655,Jessica,"David'd little bungalow was very cozy and charming. The location is great, lots of good restaurants and a huge super market selling everything you can imagine. There is also a nice shared front garden and the bungalow is very well stocked. It only takes a short bus ride or even a 25min walk to downtown. My family and I had a great time, thank you!"
208670,15143081,2014-07-03,2274009,Denise,Having this little bungalow for my family was like being a resident of the neighborhood for our stay.  I loved the garden area - reminded me of my own courtyard backyard.  Sleeping accommodations were comfortable.
208670,15989213,2014-07-19,971751,Joe,"Positives : good location, restaurants, coffee shops etc. Reasonably easy to find. Enough room for 3 people; Towels were plentiful and good quality.

Negatives :  ladder access to loft very difficult; bedroom fan broken; no AC, so very warm in summer if high temperatures; bedlinen could be better presented - rather rumpled on arrival. 

"
208670,16457067,2014-07-28,1112145,Omar,"the place was good. near everything in capitol hill, and that's what we needed. all the sleeping spaces are a bit small, but that was fine for us. the ladder up to the loft is also not for the weak."
208670,17099176,2014-08-07,16333144,Rich,"We had a lovely time in the bungalow owned by David.  It provided more room/amenities than staying in a one room hotel with our kids.  The neighborhood is very interesting and good shops and food are readily available within a block or two, as is transportation to go downtown."
208670,17347591,2014-08-11,3490227,Jordan,"Great location and very nice condo! It's a little tight if you need 3 beds, but otherwise would definitely stay again. It's just one block off Broadway,one of the main Capitol Hill streets."
208670,17860445,2014-08-18,5163620,Celia,"David's place was very nice and clean, in an area not far from the heart of Capitol Hill. However, beware that the small community is very wary about noise. I had two friends over for one night and they complained to David because it was too loud. Also, the shower rod and curtain dropped on me suddenly In the shower, but I'm sure that can be fixed. "
208670,18873372,2014-09-02,14908326,Brianna,"Cute place in an awesome location!  Quiet neighborhood, but still close to everything.  Was perfect for 5 people who were looking for a place to crash over PAX weekend!  There was even a guestbook to sign and leave notes in :)"
208670,19166748,2014-09-07,16956085,Dale,The listing was accurate.  The bungalow was very nice and in a convenient part of town.  I wrote the host asking for suggestions on best way to get there and never received a reply.  We ended up taking the train from the airport to downtown and then took Uber to the bungalow.  A response would have been appreciated.
208670,19424183,2014-09-12,20168588,Judy,"Davids place was great, brilliant location in a wonderful neighbourhood. The bungalow was great in size, clean and well kept. The beds were comfortable. My group and I couldn't have asked for a better place to stay. Thanks David !"
208670,20449835,2014-09-29,20788289,Marco,David's place was very nice. There was enough room for all of us did not disappoint. Being right in Broadway was an incredible experience. Will always recommend staying here when going to Seattle. 
208670,20863082,2014-10-06,8620791,Franklin,"In absolutely the easiest part of the hill to be part of everything and see everything. Amazing food, bus accessibility, and walkable to some wonderful parks. It was lovely to make some food (or go out) and watch Beyoncé and Jay Z on HBO. With a small infant it was by far greater choice than staying at a hotel."
208670,20990666,2014-10-09,19013202,Li,"David's place was perfect for our visit. It's one block from Broadway and takes only minutes to walk to supermarket, bus stop, and parks. The place was quiet and comfortable. David left clear instructions for everything. We really appreciate that the kitchen has everything needed to cook a simple meal!"
208670,21687506,2014-10-21,1356728,Jessica,"This place was perfect. Description was exactly as listed! I stayed there for the weekend with my boyfriend, best friend from college and her husband. We couldn't have asked for a place in a better location. The neighborhood was great to walk around in, and easy access to other parts. I'd definitely stay here again and would highly recommend it to others!"
208670,21899489,2014-10-26,8144739,Dave,"Great little place with a good layout for 2 couples. The bungalow community was charming and quiet, yet just a block from a massive grocery store and great bars and restaurants."
208670,22611906,2014-11-10,22508936,Edward,David was a great host. Gave us perfect directions and instructions how to get keys. The listing description was accurate. The bungalow was perfect for our family. The kids loved the loft. It felt very safe especially with the locking gate. Parking was crowded at times but was always able to find some. We had a great time in Seattle and this was a perfect place to come back to. Will definitely stay here again.
208670,22819461,2014-11-15,8620791,Franklin,Having stayed at David's bungalow before I was familiar with where and what to expect. As usual it was a wonderful stay in Seattle. An absolute lovely place to visit Capital Hill.
208670,23204987,2014-11-25,5910594,Gaia,"David welcomed my mom and I into his home and we had a great time! The bungalow is right off of Broadway and very close to a lot of restaurants, shops, and the grocery store. David was very responsive whenever I texted him and was helpful in resolving some issues we had with the wi-fi router. Parking was a bit difficult to find in the evenings but it was helpful to have the zone guest pass."
208670,23425029,2014-12-01,14473674,Harper,"Cute, inviting bungalow. Great location. Easy walking. We cooked a whole Thanksgiving feast.  Would love to stay here again. "
208670,23549021,2014-12-04,7627860,Alex,"It was a wonderful, cozy place that matched the description.  Excellent location.  Thanks, David!"
208670,24406183,2014-12-28,21806051,Michele,"Great (email hidden)e bungalow is comfortable and David was available although Xmas holidays to answer our questions.
I recommend the place."
208670,25392366,2015-01-14,5522159,Niki,This is a very cute place in a great neighborhood. 
208670,26225404,2015-02-07,13929143,Jeremy,David's bungalow place was perfect! Great location (especially for someone who wanted to just walk and explore a new neighborhood in a city in which I've not spent much time)...close to everything you could need and want. A perfect amount of space in the home itself in a really sweet little cul-de-sac of bungalows. Everything you could need is in the home. I'd absolutely stay there again!
208670,26775751,2015-02-19,1846164,Michelle,"Amazing neighborhood (great restaurants, consignment clothing stores, very hipster), best location, adorable bungalow, couldn't have asked for a better Air BNB!  For those of you renting a car, rent something small so you can fit into the cute tiny spaces in the neighborhood.  Thank you, David, for being a wonderful host, we had a blast in the Emerald City.  "
208670,27111925,2015-02-25,27913654,Christina,"David,

Thanks so much for letting us stay in your beautiful bungalow! We couldn't have come on a better weekend - the weather was amazing! Thanks again for all the recos for food spots, we did end up checking out a lot of your recos :)

Thanks for everything!

Christina & Maia"
208670,28520337,2015-03-25,11977120,Cynthia,"The bungalow was very quaint and lovely.  GREAT location!  We walked everywhere...wonderful restaurants, grocery stores all in the
neighborhood!!!  We loved our stay and would make reso's there again if we come to visit Seattle again!"
208670,28896909,2015-03-31,6042037,Indra,"We really enjoyed our stay at David's bungalow. The unit is clean, well-laid out and cozy. Location in the middle of Capitol Hill is fantastic, although parking as expected can be hard to find in this neighborhood. Highly recommended stay in Seattle."
208670,29922587,2015-04-14,28711195,Rebecca,"The bungalow was perfectly located 1 block off Broadway where the action is, yet tucked away in a garden. Very cosy and quaint."
208670,30451543,2015-04-22,24888760,Elizabeth,"This has to be the best locations to explore Seattle. Our group was here for a conference at the convention center, so it was an easy 1 mile walk downtown. There were so many restaurants and bars to explore within blocks of the apartment, and I had some spectacular morning jogs around the beautiful and nearby Volunteer Park. I think the space was a bit cozy for five people, as this is a small apartment, but it's a beautiful apartment and it still worked really well for our close-knit group. David is a joy to communicate with, and he always had quick and helpful responses to our questions. This is a place I want to return to.  "
208670,31735157,2015-05-09,4617894,Michael,"Wonderful stay. Good spot, great location. "
208670,32484207,2015-05-18,30064068,Kathleen,"David was a gracious host and easy to contact to make arrangements.  The bungalow was clean and cozy, and the courtyard was a lovely haven after the hustle and bustle of the city - a lovely home away from home.  Capitol Hill is a vibrant community filled with interesting people, amazing food, and plenty of quaint shops and local attractions.  And the coffee....THE COFFEE!  The synthesis of nature and city make for a lovely Seattle experience!"
208670,33135252,2015-05-25,20184838,Logen,"It was a pleasure to stay at David's bungalow. David was very accommodating. I had early on asked about checking in early, but failed to check on that until the day before my brother and I arrived. He said he would do his best, to allow us to check in a little earlier, and emailed by 10am or so that we could check in any time. (Considerably earlier than the standard check-in.) As for the place itself, it took a couple go arounds to find a parking place and then find the place, but the area it is in, is beautiful and literally a street from the bustling Broadway. All the same, it is surprisingly quiet and peaceful at the bungalow. I have nothing but positive things to say about the place, really. I partly chose the place due to the loft, which I decided to use. I have somewhat soft feet, and the ladder rungs are probably far easier to climb up with shoes on, but I do not like wearing shoes in homes, and the fun of sleeping in the loft was absolutely worth the minimal pain. I would absolutely stay there again, should I find myself again in Seattle. "
208670,33907803,2015-06-02,14400464,Francisco,Very beautiful house in a very hip and convenient Seattle location with plenty of restaurants and places to go nearby.  David was very helpful and we had access to all the advertised amenities. We had a  truly wonderful stay and will surely highly recommend it to others planning to stay in Seattle!
208670,34636206,2015-06-10,28409627,Adam,"We had a great time in the bungalow with the ""secret garden,"" as we referred to it by the end of our stay. Not only is it surrounded by things to do on Broadway and 15th, it's a nice stroll to Downtown for you to check out the sights. Quaint and cozy, this listing really has everything that you need. "
208670,35775205,2015-06-22,29140161,Lisa,"David made us feel welcome and was in contact with us up to the time of our stay and during our stay.  The home was in a lovely neighborhood, and was very quiet and clean.  We enjoyed a glass of wine in the cute courtyard, and saw a couple of the neighbors do the same.  The kitchen had basic necessities like cookware and dishes, but with only place settings for four, it felt a little understocked if you wanted to cook a meal.  But, there are tons of restaurants nearby in a very vibrant area of Capitol Hill.  You could walk to and from the train station (we did twice) if you don't mind hills.  Going uphill was a bit tougher than going down, but easier than SF and if you wear comfy shoes it's not difficult.  Plus there are lots of restaurants along the way to stop for a meal or beverage and take a break from dragging your luggage.  There are convenient bus stops near the house if you don't want to walk.  We did take the bus to the City Center, and we also used a taxi once (Uber was not successful for us with the US Open going on at the time we were visiting).  In general we prefer to stay in private homes over hotels, and this home met all our needs, and gave us an opportunity to see a part of Seattle we may not have explored otherwise."
208670,36132224,2015-06-25,34225342,Michelle,"My host was very welcoming from the sign on the board, to clear communication before during and after and clear instructions on the table.  The listing was accurate and lovely.  I appreciated this quaint 1-bedroom loft and it was perfect for my friend and me.  Great walking neighborhood, safe and delicious eats everywhere!  Seattle is amazing and I would stay here again when I come back!"
208670,37048760,2015-07-04,24041908,DeWitt,"Very comfortable for family, well appointed apartment in great neighborhood, good restaurants and shopping relatively easy to park, highly recommend "
208670,37612474,2015-07-08,37127390,Ann,We had really enjoyed our stay here  tks a lot
208670,38134368,2015-07-13,34209469,Lucrecia R.,"My friends and I stayed here for three nights last week, and we found it to be very comfortable and cozy. The place is in a perfect location, and we were all quite happy with our experience here."
208670,38536294,2015-07-16,25662670,Nancy,"My family of 5 (all adults) recently stated at David's bungalow.  The space was great for our needs and the location was excellent.  The neighborhood is very fun and is within walking distance to great restaurants.  We took the bus to downtown Seattle, only a block from the bungalow and super easy.  We were a bit worried that the bungalow didn't have any air conditioning but the Seattle weather was great and David had fans to help circulate the air.  We did run out of toilet paper and paper towels part way through our stay.  it would have been great to have extra supplies available.  You enter the bungalow through a gated garden which made us feel very safe.   I and my family would highly recommend David's bungalow for a great place to stay in Seattle!"
208670,38995507,2015-07-20,31549422,Theresa,"Based on other experience with vacation rentals, the Pillow Team is the best. The communication, confirmation and follow through brought a lot of piece of mind to our vacation."
208670,40929522,2015-08-03,3340299,Ross,"Nice bungalow in a great part of Capitol Hill.  Clean, quiet, comfortable.  Walking distance to great shopping, coffee, bars, etc. Fits 3 comfortably."
208670,41925511,2015-08-10,30157823,Geoffery,"The house was exactly as described, and the location was excellent.  There was a nearby grocery store, and travelling to other parts of the city was quick and easy."
208670,42585600,2015-08-14,3108777,Tommy,"This apartment is in an extremely cute 1-story complex with a beautiful courtyard that was a perfect spot to sit and have beer in the sun. It's also in a great location on Capitol Hill, close to a lot of nightlife, but situated on a quiet residential street just off broadway.

The unit itself is very clean and cozy and was a really nice place to come back to after a long day of activities. I would definitely recommend this place."
208670,43363126,2015-08-19,34119372,Michael,"The bungalow was very clean.  There were amble towels and bedding.  The bungalow is within 1 block of the heart of Capitol Hill, where there is a large QCF grocery store and many restaurants.  Bus service to downtown Seattle is very convenient.   The area around the bungalow was very quiet at night.  The only negative is that on-street parking near the bungalow is very limited."
208670,44337572,2015-08-25,39520397,Miriam,"Great, cozy loft apartment, with great neighbors. Beautiful little garden courtyard out front. Very close to many shops and restaurants (and a great grocery store) in Cap Hill, but tucked away so it's not too noisy. Comfortably fit 5 adults. We had a couple issues with the lockbox(es) and wifi (both resolved), would be great if there was a direct # provided rather than a # to an automated machine to answer any questions more quickly. But overall David and the Pillow Team were very responsive any time we had any questions. Would definitely recommend staying here. "
208670,45243483,2015-09-01,32859789,Margeret,"What an adorable bungalow!  Sometimes on the internet, pictures can make a place seem better than it really is.  That was not the case with David's place.  It was a clean, quiet, and relaxing.  It felt like home away from home.  A great place to come back to after a busy day in Seattle, either to cook a meal in the well stocked kitchen or enjoy a glass of wine.

The home is well situated only a block from one of Capital Hill's main thoroughfares to easily use public transit, grab a bite to eat, enjoy a cup of coffee, or shop at a great, large grocery store.  However, we never heard any street noise and felt very safe and secure in the little gated community.  The neighbors are very quiet and the little courtyard is beautiful and very well maintained.

We would highly recommend this place for anyone working or vacationing in Seattle."
208670,47940299,2015-09-21,31333722,Karilyn,We absolutely loved staying in David's bungalow. So comfortable and clean. Our son LOVED the loft space. Its so close to all of the fun restaurants in the Capitol Hill neighborhood. We will definitely stay here next time! 
208670,48878244,2015-09-29,33430479,Susan,"My husband and I stayed here while visiting my daughter, who just moved to Seattle and is living in Capitol Hill. The bungalow was just as described, cute, clean, comfortable, and very quiet, nestled in a secluded courtyard. The location is excellent and felt very safe. It offers the vibrancy of Captiol Hill without the noise, and is close to all the conveniences, including a large grocery store and two coffee places only a block away, as well as multiple restaurants. We found it an easy walk to Pike's Place, museums, and all the tourists sites. We really enjoyed our stay!"
208670,51300050,2015-10-19,31079863,Luis,This place was extremely centrally located to Seattle and extremely convenient. The pace it self was small but clean and cute and I would definitely stay here again.
208670,52120705,2015-10-26,16860485,Zachary (And Kristen),"The townhouse is in a great location, right in the middle of Capitol Hill, but just off the ""main drag"" so it's quiet at night. It's a small townhouse, but well laid out and cutely decorated, and it was perfect for our needs.  

We had some issues with the management company (Pillow) used; there wasn't a blanket for the sofa bed despite the listing saying there was, and when we called to ask about it, they brought over extra sheets, but not a blanket, and seemed generally confused by the whole thing.  

Carefully read their instructions where the key is; the instructions make sense are slightly complicated."
208670,53518056,2015-11-09,9194195,Lauren,"The location of the unit couldn't have been more perfect for our weekend stay! Plenty in walking distance and close to the friends we were visiting. 

Unfortunately the customer service we received was sub-par. To be clear, this review is not for David, the host that is listed for this unit, but for Pillow, the service that runs the booking, communication and accommodations for this listing via David's account. It started when I booked the unit -- we were only going to be in town for two nights. This was an Instant Book, so I got a confirmation right away. Pillow then contacted me and tried to tell me it was a three night minimum, even though the Airbnb listing clearly said two. After several phone calls and messages, we were able to keep our reservation of only two nights, luckily. It was just a hassle, especially considering my card had already been charged. 

When we arrived, the unit was clean and as expected based on the photos. The problem was that the bed on the loft didn't have a comforter. There were no extra blankets anywhere in the unit either. There isn't a phone number to contact Pillow, but I left a message through Airbnb and they let me know that they could deliver one but that it would be an extra charge. We decided against paying more than what we had paid already. After we'd checked out, David (the actual host) messaged me and let me know there should have been a comforter on each of the beds. Unfortunately Pillow operates strictly and couldn't provide more than sheets and towels without an extra charge, even though it sounded like David would have.

We asked for an hour late check out, which wasn't granted. Not a big deal, but just sort of confirmed the feeling on this trip that Pillow operates like a robot host and it certainly took away some of the charm I've experienced on stays at other rentals. 

Again, the unit and location are great! If you're not worried about the level of service you'll get from Pillow then this is a great spot to be for 2-4 people. "
7713043,41556516,2015-08-07,823176,Victor,Alvin made me feel like home and he was very hospitable. He made sure everything I needed was available. The trailer was very cozy with lots of comfy bedding & pillows. Bathroom requires a quick walk to the house. I felt like I was glamping in the city! WIFI worked great & there are AC power outlet in the trailer for your laptop. 
7713043,41891813,2015-08-09,4028395,Mayra,"Very welcoming.  We were biking around town all day and when we arrived, they had some very nice chilled beverages waiting for us.  It was perfect.  Really cool experience to have our own space in this vintage RV. So fun!!

Very calm neighborhood about 8-9 miles by bike southeast of the central city.  I am sure it would be a short drive.  "
7713043,42082573,2015-08-10,6416330,Janet,"Alvin did an excellent job of representing his property, we took a chance on this location/type of accommodation because NOTHING else was available.  This turned out to be a delightful experience! Very comfortable and clean, Alvin made us feel welcome, we really enjoyed ourselves!"
7713043,44345730,2015-08-25,15581230,Sam,"The description was accurate, the neighborhood was totally lovely, and we felt plenty welcome. A lot of care has gone into making this space a lovely pad for travelers (from the decorations to the snacks)! "
7713043,45317940,2015-09-01,11128764,Alex,"Alvin and Bill are very nice and welcome for our visiting, the trailer is very sweet and have everything we need. The transportation is also convenient for people who want to go to downtown. Overall the experience is wonderful."
7713043,45630927,2015-09-04,8695224,Chris,Alvin and Bill were very attentive. The place is small but cute. Easy drive into downtown Seattle.
7713043,55272299,2015-11-29,710161,Erika,"First off, this is a lovely little camper! The guys have done an amazing job making this a cozy space. There are most of the amenities that you would need including a refrigerator, working stove, and wi-fi. Upon arrival there were great beverages and a snack waiting to greet me. If you don't mind going into someone's home to use the shower and restroom, the home is clean and inviting. I felt safe traveling alone here. Alvin was a wonderfully accommodating host. My only issue was the heating. I chose to stay in a season when it was 25 degrees at night. This RV is uninsulated and the only heat source is a propane space heater. I had to wake every few hours to reload a new barrel of propane. I also didn't realize until the second night that it's not safe to heat a small enclosed space with a propane space heater unless you ventilate it, at which point I let all of the heat out. If you plan ahead to bring an electric blanket and/or if maybe they update the space heater to an electric one I think this could easily be a four or five star 'glamping' experience. I imagine in the spring, it's a dream."
4439293,22386265,2014-11-04,8315524,Vanessa,The place was super cozy and very comfortable.  The wireless speaker was very cool!  And the best was they left us wine! And gave us free parking. The instructions were great!   Great hosts! 
4439293,22910869,2014-11-17,6920214,Owen,"Here's my review based on what is most important to me:

But before you waste your time reading this review, to sum up everything below.. just book it. No complaints at all.

The Bedroom (and the rest of the studio): 10/10
Fresh white sheets with comforter, towels laid out nicely on bed, gorgeous remodeled kitchen with a decent view, beautifully decorated cozy home. A closet with hangers. They even had a bluetooth speaker so you can enjoy the music on your phone. Wifi connected easily. There's was an opened bottle of wine we definitely helped ourselves to lol. Only thing I wished they had was an iron. 

The Bathroom: 10/10
Spotless. I hate when you stay at an Airbnb and they neglect the bathroom. This place did not suffer at all from that.

The Location: 10/10
Everything touristy is under a mile walk. There's a small convenience store up the street if you need a toothbrush or more alcohol. If you use Cars2Go, there's usually room to park it on Pine st. 

The Host: 10/10
The host was great. Easy to get ahold of. Let us check in early. We could have gone the whole 5 days we stayed without meeting him as he provided concise instructions on how to access the room without having a physical person hand you the keys. But because I asked where I could wash my clothes, Andre was nice and offered some detergent and fabric softener. 

Overall: 10/10
Yes, I would definitely book here again if I were in town. It made seeing Seattle that much more pleasant. "
4439293,23110585,2014-11-23,23071643,Evelyn,Great place! Just as described and check in was so easy. No doubt the best experience and so close to everything in a walking distance. Chromecast was great to have it made the experience so much better. Will definitely recommend this place to anyone and would love to book again when visiting Seattle.
4439293,23501035,2014-12-02,23484514,Mark,"It's my first time to use Airbnb. Andre&Joel gave me a wonderful experience! Check-in is super easy. The Condo is really cozy as they describes! Kitchen is the best part, they have everything you need plus unique view! BTW, the location is perfect. It's close to everywhere you want to go. Although we didn't meet each other, but they helped me out whenever I had a question. Thank you guys! "
4439293,23649345,2014-12-07,13171610,Lina,The unit was clean and cozy. Street parking is a bit challenging but the location definitely makes up for it. We were able to walk to pike place and taylor shellfish and several other places are conveniently located. Overall we had a pleasant stay. 
4439293,23794665,2014-12-10,23419302,Christina,"I met with Joel before we rented the apartment to make sure that my execs staying their would be comfortable.  The apartment is as the pictures show and my execs have had no issues at all.

I would highly recommend using Andre and Joel for next stay."
4439293,23995679,2014-12-16,23222834,Adam,Perfect for a weekend trip to Seattle! Prime location and nice secure building. Very clean and true to what is advertised. Joel and Andre are quick to respond and are happy to address any issues or concerns (not that I had any)! I definitely recommend staying here!
4439293,24114322,2014-12-20,24241684,Zhen,Nice apartment! I had a good experience there. They have everything prepared and the location is so great!
4439293,24366462,2014-12-27,9287686,Cara,"This apartment was fantastic. My boyfriend and I were visiting Seattle for the holidays and could not have been happier. The building is great, easy to get in and out and the access instructions were very clear. We used the adjacent parking in the convention center that Andre and Joel offered and it was closer than we expected- literally right next door. The apartment was in top condition, and Andre and Joel were very responsive to all of our questions. The apartment is located in the heart of the city, with walking access to most neighborhoods and attractions- we even walked to the space needle and we were there in December! Highly recommend staying here!"
4439293,24589556,2014-12-31,21988508,Calvin,"Had a great time her and this place in a perfect location. About a 15 min walk from pikes place, great restaurants, bars and coffee shops in the area. The place is perfect size for a couple and it's great to be able to cook a meal in when you want.  Would book again!"
4439293,24930906,2015-01-04,9445776,Bryan,"The apartment was quite spacious for my girlfriend and I.  It would have been nice to have a larger table to do some work though.  There is a small desk situated in a tight space which did not allow for much room to lay out books/papers.  Andre/Joel were very responsive with any needs/issues that came up.  The wall-mounted radiator was not working at certain times throughout the day (not sure if this is normal).  I mentioned this to Andre/Joel and they gave me a small space heater within the hour.  Having the kitchen was convenient with plenty of glass/flatware. One annoying thing is that the toilet would make a sound every so often (like a brief draining sound every minute).   We had to keep the bathroom door closed to minimize the sound.  didn't end up being too big of an issue but something that should get looked into.  
Apt is conveniently located to Pike place market (about 8 blocks) and capital hill restaurants.  Overall, good price and very responsive hosts.  Would definitely consider staying here again!"
4439293,25233404,2015-01-10,10126622,Sarah,"I really enjoyed staying in the P3 Throwback in Seattle. The cute little studio was well-equipped and comfy, and Andre and Joel were really responsive and accommodating. I was in town to go to a conference at the convention center and would absolutely stay here again for future conferences. "
4439293,25382876,2015-01-14,23502872,Cindy,"Joel was so nice and the apartment was very comfortable and clean. Fresh towels and fully stocked kitchen w/ utensils/pots/pans, etc. This made it so easy to cook meals and save a little bit. You can't beat the location - just 0.8 miles down to Pike's and you are in the heart of First hill/Capitol hill! The only downside was that the gate code to the garage and parking info was a little tough to obtain but Joel definitely made up for it by sending an email as well as personally calling! Thank you for such a pleasant stay in beautiful Seattle! "
4439293,25542427,2015-01-19,23412901,Lulu,"Andre and Joel's place was brilliant and in an absolutely ideal location. It's right down the road from the Starbucks Roastery, just up the road from an amazing veg hot dog place called Cyber Dogs and right in the middle of downtown Seattle. Easy walk to Pike Place Markets and slightly longer walk to the Needle. We couldn't believe our luck. 
The place itself is spacious, clean and has everything you'd need. Beautiful, modern kitchen. Lots of shelf room in the bathroom. Can use the TV to watch what you want from your phone sitting in a nice, comfy couch. 
Tried to text Andre and Joel as the instructions mentioned the phone was a more reliable contact method, but you had to actually call the number, which was a hotline. Ended up just contacting them via Airbnb, but they were perfectly responsive and helpful on there and they checked in with us to make sure we'd arrived OK. 
Can't fault the stay and would absolutely stay again. Thanks so much!"
4439293,25876078,2015-01-28,3021944,Rizza,"I loved staying here. Andre and Joel made accommodations so seamless for me. Believe it or not, the place looks even better in person! A very convenient location since we pretty much walked everywhere. I cannot wait to come back and stay with Andre and Joel again. "
4439293,26673832,2015-02-17,19069544,Kirsten,"We had a wonderful experience at the P3 Throwback in Seattle. It is in the most perfect & central location. You can walk just about anywhere - to Pike Place Market, Downtown & to great restaurants in Capital Hill. We even walked through town to the Space Needle. It is also close to public transport if you don't feel like walking. It was quiet, clean & homely. It is the perfect size for two people sharing. The hosts were also extremely helpful and responded to every query & request promptly. "
4439293,26904310,2015-02-22,23034370,Dustin,"Andre & Joel were extremely communicative and made sure that we knew what was going on every step of the way.  They had just installed in a keypad for the entry and let us know the morning of, as soon as it was completed.  We never met them, but felt like they were reachable.  The place was nice and the building itself is pretty quiet at night.  It was a superb location -- just minute away from Capitol Hill to the right and Pike's Place to the left.  Perfect for my boyfriend and me to have a short getaway.  A few notes I had regarding our stay: 1) I don't believe this was communicated to them, but unfortunately the building decided to do an alarm test for fifteen to twenty minutes the first morning we were there.  While I was on a 10AM conference call, the alarm went off across the building for about 5-10 seconds every three minutes.  It was extremely inconvenient as I had to mute in-between my sentences as I was trying to speak.  2) Another unfortunate experience we had was that Andre & Joel mentioned that there was a cleaning company that took care of turning the unit around before the next tenants.  I really don't believe this was their fault as there was no way they could have known but the cleaning team must have missed the shower because there were small wads of long brown hair from the previous renters.  Certainly not ours because we both have short black hair.  The fridge could have been cleaned out as there was an open carton of milk and someone's yogurt in there from previously.  (I didn't think this was a deal-breaker, though, easily washed away the ones that were in our way; I just bring it up because they emphasize strict cleanliness from guests.) 3) Lastly, the pipes in the building were creaky at night.  I think it was from running water in the unit above, but there was noise just above the bed area until about 1AM.  Again, I think all of these were all out of their control for the most part but kind of added a damper to our experience."
4439293,27197761,2015-02-28,22954827,Kelly,"P3 Throwback in Seattle was lovely, as promised. The location was excellent. I had no issues at all. Thank you for a seamless stay!"
4439293,27393147,2015-03-03,5872987,Liana,Andre & Joel's apartment was great for our trip to Seattle! It was very clean and had more than enough amenities. It was also very centrally located and walking distance to both Pikes Place and Capitol Hill. Would definitely consider staying here again!
4439293,27657644,2015-03-09,21021726,Kathryn,"I had a fantastic time staying at Andre and Joel's charming studio! The apartment is cleverly designed and laid out well, with beautiful detailing. Throughout my entire stay I felt perfectly at home.

The building could not be located in a more convenient spot. A quick 15 minute walk to Pike Place and 10 minutes to Capitol Hill, which made this apartment the perfect home base for exploring Seattle. 

Andre and Joel were amazingly prompt with answering all of my questions and providing me with space to store my luggage. I did not run in to any problems locating or entering the unit, thanks to their very detailed instructions!

I had a fantastic time in Seattle, and it was in no small part due to the welcoming and relaxing space that Andre and Joel provide. I look forward to visiting again!   "
4439293,28378508,2015-03-23,24609050,AnnMarie,"Our stay at the apartment was excellent. The apartment is situated around the corner from the convention centre and is in an excellent location, near shops and restaurants. The apartment had everything we needed and was exceptionally well cleaned. We also found the apartment to be very quiet both during the day and at night. There is also a washer and drier located in the building that was very convenient. I would definitely recommenced the apartment to a friend and if I was going to be in Seattle again I would stay here. We really enjoyed our stay and part of that was because the apartment was warm, cosy and had everything we needed. "
4439293,28599184,2015-03-27,5294470,Alicia,"This P3 Throwback as a perfect spot to stay for a couple of nights in Seattle! Andre and Joel have put some wonderful touches in the apartment (furniture and details) and it was clean and comfortable.  They are also very quick, responsive, and detailed with the checking in and checking out process. I will recommend this spot to friends who are visiting Seattle. "
4439293,28791685,2015-03-30,9354901,Carlos,"Andre and Joel's apartment was wonderful, great location if you have work to do near the convention center or if you just would like to see the main attractions of Seattle. Extremely clean and tidy place, it basically has all you need for a perfect stay. Thanks for everything.  "
4439293,29276186,2015-04-06,9699284,Greg,"Joel and Andre were very responsive and the place was great - accurately depicted on the site, conveniently located, good value. Would recommend "
4439293,29566052,2015-04-09,26603190,Jeff,"I was really satisfied with this experience. The throwback is exactly that and located in a really wonderful location where you can explore Seattle by foot. We immensely enjoyed the nearby Capitol Hill neighborhood. The apartment was super clean and cozy, exactly as presented and worked very well for our trip. 

Check-in was very easy, and if you want a simple experience - this is it. "
4439293,29820869,2015-04-13,20698147,Steve,"Awesome location! Short block to Pike Street.  Literally around the corner from the convention center. Coffee shops abound.

Great unit. Exactly as shown. Small, but perfect for 2. Sparkling clean with fully stocked kitchenware for preparing meals. (Not a ton of restaurants in the adjoining blocks, but plenty nearby)

Great communication from beginning to end. Had zero issues getting access tothe unit. NOTE:  Our flights were delayed and Andre & Joel offered to refund our luggage storage fees.

Would absolutely recommend this unit would gladly stay again. A star stay!"
4439293,30489977,2015-04-23,9682733,Natalie,I ended up on a business trip by myself in Seattle (after planning for my Assistant to come).  The building was nice & safe and the condo was immaculate!  Everything I needed was there (plus more).   My colleagues who stayed in area hotels at twice the cost were jealous.  I would definitely recommend this location.  It is literally across the street from the conference center and 3 short blocks from shopping and restaurants.
4439293,30785033,2015-04-27,20614097,Emily,"Joel and Andre were exceptionally thorough so the check in process was a breeze, which was appreciated since we got in late. The unit we stayed in was clean and comfortable and felt ""homey"". The neighborhood was in an excellent location for two people who have never visited the city before; we were walking distance from downtown Seattle, as well as the surrounding neighborhood hot spots.   Joel and Andre were very prompt in replying to any questions we had, and always made themselves available to us. I'm so glad we decided to try AirBnb instead of a hotel because the customer service felt ""personal"", and we were so lucky to have such great hosts our first time around. "
4439293,31304912,2015-05-04,15908248,Tim,"Nice place, ideal for conference visitors"
4439293,31759924,2015-05-10,2501772,Brian,"The apartment was perfect for my stay.  Close to the convention center, easy parking provided and the hosts were very timely with their responses.  It's a short hop onto the freeway to take you anywhere in Seattle "
4439293,32060393,2015-05-13,20484281,Quinton,"Wonderful location for an Airbnb stay! Wish there was more convenient parking but not much to be done there. Kitchen was great, bed was super comfy too."
4439293,32334072,2015-05-17,8997773,Xianchi,Great place to stay in Seattle 
4439293,32757055,2015-05-21,29833451,Sarah,"Andre and Joel's place was wonderful! Very clean, comfortable, and best of all, it was centrally located to just about everything. A short walk to the Pike Place Market, several coffee shops, and lots of wonderful restaurants. Although we didn't meet Andre and Joel in person, they communicated clearly and in a timely way throughout the process. If we ever find ourselves back in Seattle, we'd definitely stay there again. "
4439293,33218592,2015-05-26,24880181,Kevin,"Andre and Joel were great hosts, and did an excellent job of making sure everything went smoothly for us checking in and out of their place.

Overall, we enjoyed the P3 Throwback very much. It was great to have  our own space to decompress after long days of walking around Seattle. We made extensive use of the TV/Chromecast, and didn't run into any issues while we were there.

Thanks again guys!"
4439293,33772139,2015-06-01,11467364,Renaud,"Great location, great flat, everything went well. I found the couch bed a little uncomfortable and the owner directly provided me with a better bed."
4439293,34693057,2015-06-11,6235221,Jae Wook,"Andre and Joel's place was fantastic!
I attended a conference at Washington convention center, which was really close to apartment. I kind of liked to be an american for short period. I mean, living in a classic apartment, using coin locker, saying hello to neighbors in elevator...every moment.

Even though I had no chance to meet Andre and Joel, it was very easy to get a key, access the lobby, and use the house. 
The place was very cozy and well equiped! I even experienced chrome-cast for the first time in my life! And I love that classic speaker. Everyday I connected my phone to that speaker through bluetooth and played music. The bed was super comfortable, which was the best part of this place.

I highly recommend this place to people coming to Seattle!!

Thank you Andre and Joel."
4439293,35194054,2015-06-16,11715901,Deborah,"The apartment was exactly as described.  Great location, easy walking distance to all tourist attractions, very comfortable and apartment was equipped with everything needed.  If we visit Seattle again would love to stay here again.  Definitely recommend this apartment."
4439293,35663702,2015-06-21,32231703,Troy,"Description online was accurate as it was a nice, comfortable, clean unit with a good kitchen for all our needs. 
Great location to access transporation to any destination.
Only exception is  we thought we remember having a washer and dryer which was missing and could of been used with only one set of towels.
A little road noise when windows open from I-5 and early dump truck making lots of rackett early Friday morning which of course Andre and Joel aren't in control of. We would definately reccomend to others and return to ourselves.  Thanks, Hilton's"
4439293,36191129,2015-06-26,5945427,Claudia,"The apartment was great! The location was perfect for shopping, close to museums and restaurants AND close to the freeway so you could just hop on and get either to the airport or north out of town. It was clean and the bed was comfortable. The directions to get to the apartment and find the key were clear and concise. We will look you up when we are back in Seattle."
4439293,36651529,2015-06-30,27021817,Niki,"After the initial confusion and communication issues with getting the keys, the stay was enjoyable. The room was nice and contact was easy with the hosts."
4439293,37076595,2015-07-04,11249367,Amanda,Andre and Joel were accommodating and gracious. They made our check in incredibly easy even though my bf and I opted for unassisted check in. They were easy to get a hold of and always responded to my questions promptly. The place was clean and exactly as described. The bed was comfortable and the place was located in a great area. Walkable to popular tourist and local attractions and restaurants. I'd definitely stay here again!
4439293,37734332,2015-07-10,11919228,Barbara,"This was a great place to stay in Seattle! The location is super convenient to both Capitol Hill and downtown and the apartment itself was very cute, clean, and has a basic well-stocked kitchen. Joel and Andre were easy to get in touch with with any questions."
4439293,38136078,2015-07-13,20269586,Jacob,"My wife and I stayed at this cozy studio for a long weekend, as we attended a friend's wedding in Seattle. The place was perfect for us and was very clean upon our arrival. Andre & Joel were quite responsive to any questions we asked and provided detailed instructions for entry and check-out. The location was amazing (right near Capital Hill shopping and restaurants) and the unit was very easy to access with their lock-box format. We even utilized their storage locker service, which came in handy as our flight was many hours after check-out. Overall it was a pleasant experience, one we would recommend to others. Thanks again Joel & Andre!
-Jake"
4439293,38474575,2015-07-16,12053038,Mackenzie,"Fantastic location, beautiful clean apartment. Joel was very responsive to my questions and it was a great stat. Would highly reccomend!"
4439293,39608856,2015-07-25,348462,Jody,"First, Andre and Joel are so sweet and accommodating. So helpful and easy to reach. Really wonderful hosts!! The apartment is great! Located so close to everything. Super clean  and great amenities. Soft bed and sheets: we slept so well here! Would definitely recommend this spot to anyone staying in Seattle. Look no further!"
4439293,43213046,2015-08-18,21068145,Shihfen,感謝Andre和Joel為我們提供了一個舒適且溫馨的住所，他們也是熱心且積極的房東，對於我們提出的問題皆能立即處理且提供良好的建議。當我們住在裡面，我們感受到家的感覺，我們也喜歡去住所附近的超市或派克市場採買食材，然後在乾淨明亮的廚房中烹調食物。這個房子附近的交通便利，很多市區內的景點步行皆可到達，是值得推薦的好房子。
4439293,44291790,2015-08-25,34783814,Rashida,"This place was pretty much perfect! My husband and I came on our honeymoon and can't say enough positive things about our stay. The condo was basically downtown so we were able to walk everywhere we went (only taking an uber to get to the wineries in Woodinville). It was clean and provided everything we could need, right down to condiments in the fridge. Andre and Joel gave amazingly clear instructions on how to get our keys, get into the condo and even had a luggage storage option for before check in. The only thing we would change is the condo was a little warm at night. Being from St. Louis we had a little trouble with the small air condition, so maybe adding an additional fan would help (but again, we're just not used to the moderate temps of the Northwest). Overall we would absolutely stay here again and would recommend it to anyone and everyone!  "
4439293,45458772,2015-09-03,28412867,Nicholas,"We stayed in this unit for 9 days and it was an amazing experience! Andre greeted us at the door and took us up, even helping with our luggage.  The unit description was accurate, and everything was clean and fresh when we arrived. We have everything we needed right in the unit.  It was convenient to have a kitchen as this meant we didn't always have to eat out and we could store leftovers when we did.  

You can't beat the unit location! Only a very short and convenient walk to the heart of downtown and it's a very short walk to rent a car or buy groceries. We couldn't have asked for a better place to stay!"
4439293,45931620,2015-09-07,9310741,Merle,"Nice place in a very good location. There were many restaurants and bars close by and about a 10-15 minute walk down to the waterfront on Pike Street. Our hosts allowed us to check in a few hours early which helped us shed our luggage and start to explore by 2:00 the day we arrived. We used the kitchen for a few meals, the bed was comfortable, bathroom was more than adequate. We contacted Joel and Andre a few times with questions and they responded quickly.  The street we were on was well lit at night. There were other tenants in the building that were a bit noisy at times. We would have liked a few more channel options on the TV, but we spent most of our time out and about so it was not a big deal. "
4439293,46882795,2015-09-14,15097827,Tarek,"Great location if attending an event at the convention center. Clean, tidy unit and very organized interaction with the owners ."
4439293,47464541,2015-09-19,6866402,Amy,"  I didn't have the opportunity to meet Andre and Joel in person, but the instructions they gave to pick up the keys/enter the apartment were extremely easy. Our flights arrived earlier than we had expected, so they were also gracious enough to let us check in a bit ahead of time to drop of our bags which was incredibly helpful. 
  The apartment itself is just as described.. clean, comfortable, functional, and in a great location. We were able to walk to most attractions (Pike Market, Great Wheel, Ferry Terminal, Monorail to the Space Needle), as well as countless shops and restaurants, in 15 minutes or less.. and for those we couldn't walk to, it was a quick 10 minute walk to Westlake Station for any number of buses, as well as the rail line to/from Safeco and SeaTac Airport.
  We didn't have to contact them very much, but Andre and Joel were always quick to respond and extremely helpful the few times we did. Would definitely recommend this apartment and look forward to staying again the next time we're in Seattle.

4439293,47831602,2015-09-21,4601953,S. Bernard,"What a great apartment.    I want to go back soon!     Easy to get to, close to everything, well-designed.   VERY romantic.  "
4439293,48269949,2015-09-25,35330272,Marita,"This was a great experience from beginning to end.  Host communication was clear and timely.  Opted for the unattended check-in which meant picking up keys at the nearby KeyCafe.  It all went smoothly. The place was just as described in the listing, and it was very clean and well-kept.  Centrally located, it was either an easy walk or conveniently located to public transit to get to desired destination. Thank you Andre and Joel - would definitely stay at P3 Throwback again!"
4439293,49100282,2015-10-01,9196931,Laurie,"Loved staying at P3.  It was a super convenient location for the conference I was attending, as well as a nice home base to visit Pike's Place Market, the great shopping in the area, the gorgeous Starbuck's Tastery and Reserve - many great destinations within a 10 minute or less walk.  Try Sitka and Spruce for a fabulous brunch.

The unit itself is just as pictured.  It's on the 9th floor and the building is secure, so you'll feel very safe.  I rarely heard noise from the hall or above/below.  The bed is comfortable and the linens are upscale.  The shower offers plenty of hot water and good water pressure.  The kitchen is well equipped.  I think there are three styles of coffee makers - perfect for Seattle! 

The building's rooftop deck is a nice bonus - lovely views of the city and a great place to enjoy an evening beverage.  

Joel and Andre are the perfect hosts - they responded to my few questions in very short order.  The keycafe pick-up system is very easy, as well.  

All in all, go ahead and book this unit or any of the others Joel and Andrea have in the building.  It's a great location to explore Seattle.  "
4439293,49598793,2015-10-05,33576377,Chloé,"Nous avons été accueillis chaleureusement par André, le building est facile à trouver et pour le parking c'est juste en bas de l'immeuble très pratique. Ce airbnb est idéalement situé, nous avons pu tout faire à pieds!
Je le recommande chaudement!"
4439293,49906519,2015-10-07,42392964,Erin,"Andre and Joel's apartment was a wonderful stay in Seattle. This was our first time using airbnb and they responded quickly and took care of all of our needs. The key pickup from the key cafe was only a few blocks away and and an easy walk on pike street. The apartment was extremely clean had a great kitchen and large bathroom. The TV was a great addition and could easily be watched while laying in bed! The bed was a nice size with only being a full and comfortable! There was good storage for our luggage and our early check out was simple. We traveled by train to vancouver after our stay in seattle and it was only a 5 minute walk to the bus stop that took us directly to the train station.

Make sure and always come back at night via pike street as from the other direction it is not well lit and was a bit weary in some areas around 11pm. The area and building was very safe just being unfamiliar with the area we learned quickly which streets and buses to take to make our stay easy.

This was a great central location and we visited pikes market the aquarium, space needle, and chihully glass museum all on the city pass we purchased online! Ballard market was far more fun than pikes market in our opinion. Visit the gum wall by pikes market entrance and see the troll under the bridge in fremont!! No car needed to get around - transportation was a breeze. A great day trip was taking the ferry from near the aquarium across to bainbridge island!! A must see. The best food we had was at ""the crow"" restuarant a few blocks from the space needle! The food was to die for! Thanks again for a great stay in your wonderful city!"
4439293,50625836,2015-10-13,39825134,Danielle,Our stay was awesome and the unit was spotless and perfect for our weekend getaway.  The location couldn't have been any more perfect and Joel and Andre were great.  If I go back to Seattle I would for sure stay there again!
4439293,51528087,2015-10-21,37808300,Kayla,"My best friend and I stayed at Andre and Joel's place for our week long stay in Seattle. The check in/check out process through the KeyCafe was very simple and convenient. It took minutes for us to get our keys right up the street at a little liquor store. Although we chose to have an unattended check in, we bumped into Andre and Joel as we were entering the apartment and they were kind enough to show us around the place and give us some tips. The apartment itself felt very safe and clean. Andre and Joel did a great job making sure we were equipped with everything we would need for our stay (i.e. toilet paper, kitchen appliances, towels, extra blankets, etc). The complex itself is in a very quiet, safe neighborhood right in downtown which is the perfect walking distance from everything you'd need (or a short uber ride). We loved the option of using Chromecast straight from our phone onto the tv to watch Netflix. I would without a doubt recommend this apartment to anyone looking to stay here. Thanks again for everything, Andre and Joel!"
4439293,52171852,2015-10-26,20218028,Marcelo,"The hosts were very helpful, a phone call away. Everything was perfect on the place and the add was very accurate. Using their parking option was also very convenient. "

Bonne surprise sur place : le rooftop de l'immeuble qui offre un point de vue magnifique sur Downtown.

A ne pas rater !

4439293,54311863,2015-11-18,2619641,Nellie,Andre and Joel were very accommodating from the minute I booked. They had very clear instructions about the apartment and were easy to get in touch with while allowing me my privacy too. The apartment was beautiful. It is EXACTLY like the pictures!! The location was perfect for my needs (proximity to the LINK and Victrola Coffee!). The bed is extremely comfortable. The shower gets nice and hot and has good water pressure. 
4439293,54627969,2015-11-22,42929194,Boise,The place was just s described. Very nice. And a one minute walk from the convention center and a few more minutes to Pike's Place market. Great location. 
4439293,55096433,2015-11-28,15446614,Erin,"The apartment was a very cute and clean space. It was located in a perfect spot, within walking distance to downtown, capitol hill, and the light rail. One negative thing I would say about the interior would be while the bed was comfortable, it is very small for two people. Also, it is a bit bright while sleeping because there are no blinds on the kitchen window. The upstairs neighbors were also quite loud, making sleeping a little difficult on a couple occasions. For the most part, the hosts were available if we had questions, however the last day we were there when we needed to get into the storage lockers for our luggage and the locks wouldn't work, it took about 30 minutes before we heard back from anyone, so that was frustrating that there was no one available immediately. Overall, this was a great place in a perfect location. "
4439293,57200757,2015-12-23,21436824,Gayathri,"We really enjoyed Andre and Joel place. Nicely furnished and clean place. Prefect location for downtown Seattle. Close to all touristic areas. The apartment block has communal laundry, which was handy.  Andre and Joel were kind enough to let us store our luggage after our check out. We enjoyed the place a lot."
5510720,28832272,2015-03-30,29417209,Amanda,"Great place, very clean, great location. Nice booklet of Seattle resources, good communication from host. Street parking, easy walkable neighborhood"
5510720,29839433,2015-04-13,6368737,Owen,This apartment is in an awesome location in Capital Hill and is a great home base if you're looking to explore that neighborhood.  Super close to lots of good restaurants and fun nightlife but also quieter residential neighborhoods to walk around in.
5510720,30396564,2015-04-21,1007790,Emily & Chad,"This studio exceeded our expectations in every way. It was spotless, adorable, and well-appointed with all that you would need in a launching point from Capitol Hill. The location was ideal - just steps from tons of restaurants and the Pronto! bikes (which you can use to offset the calories you eat at the ice cream shop). It's also close enough to downtown that you could stay here while attending a conference and either walk, bike, uber, car2go, bus, or taxi home. We would stay here again in a heartbeat. "
5510720,31885012,2015-05-11,9471858,Jared,"Great spot in a very convenient location! The apartment was very clean and comfortable. Peter communicated well. It was easy to find our way in. Overall, it was a very nice stay."
5510720,32504070,2015-05-19,1017437,Mike,"Peter's place is a true gem!  Definitely the best Airbnb experience I've ever had.  The place is impeccably clean, ideally located, and full of cozy charm.  It has everything one would need for a wonderfully relaxing stay, even including a turntable with lovely old LPs! ;)  The bed is super comfy, the kitchen is fully stocked with cooking utensils, silverware, plates/cups/mugs, French press. You'll be right in the middle of the gourmet ghetto of Capitol Hill with the best restaurants and cafes within 2 steps from the place (Seriously, you can actually see some of the best eateries right out of the living room window!)  There's a bike sharing stall half a block away and you'll be able to ride all over town (10min to downtown, 20min to U District, 20min to the Space Needle/Chihuly).  On top of everything, Peter is an amazing communicator -- check-in and check-out was easy and quick -- too bad I didn't get to meet him.  Can't recommend this place enough, and would love to stay there again when I'm in Seattle next.  Thanks again for an amazing stay!"
5510720,33793346,2015-06-01,30054646,Misha,"I had a great experience staying in Peter's apartment for a long weekend away. The apartment is nicely furnished and centrally located -- 1 block from the local bike share, a $5-10 uber ride to Ballard and other Seattle sights, and walking distance to many neighborhood bars and restaurants. Peter was communicative and made arrival/departure easy. I will definitely look to stay here again on my next visit to Seattle!  "
5510720,34425698,2015-06-08,21061531,Emily,Peter was great communicating with us. The apartment was just as advertised in a really fun location. Lots of places around it within walking distance.
5510720,35201040,2015-06-16,27848052,Brianne,"I had a great experience in Seattle while staying at Peter's place.

It's located close to so many restaurants, coffee shops, bars, shops, etc. The Capitol Hill area is lively and safe and I'm so glad I stayed there. 

Peter's place is well appointed and nicely decorated. I felt right at home. 

Peter is great with communication and accommodating guests. I would recommend him again in a heartbeat.

Thanks so much! I will be back to Seattle."
5510720,35778807,2015-06-22,29830349,Will,"Peter was easy to work with and provided a great place to stay. The place was in a great location and near a ton of restaurants, shops, and bars. Overall, a very enjoyable experience."
5510720,36513466,2015-06-29,12083716,Johannes,"We had a wonderful time in Peter's beautiful apartment. The location is just great, such a nice neighborhood. The apartment was very clean and tidy. We liked the style a lot. It had everything we needed. Peter was very nice and helpful, it was very easy to communicate with him. We would like to stay there again! Thank you!"
5510720,37298069,2015-07-06,20438423,Roland,"From arrival until departure we enjoyed our stay at Peter's apartment. Peter prepared everything as you can imagine: detailreich Description how to access the apartment, make yourselves comfortable in and around. There was even coffee, milk and granola for breakfast. The neighborhoud is a mixture of ""old"" and new and we always felt safe. If still available @ Peters will be our Seattle home base for future stays."
5510720,38113606,2015-07-13,1676443,Jason,"What a great place! Peter's place was just as described plus some. Capitol Hill is a nice, hip location with lots of good eats and HH spots. Although we spent most of our (email hidden) fest, it was lovely to come back to a cozy place for relaxation! I highly recommend Peter's place for a fun time in the emerald city! "
5510720,39914938,2015-07-27,25907275,Kiyoka,Peter's place was so cozy and comfortable. It was also in a prime location and we were able to walk everywhere. Peter was well organized and made his place feel very welcome. It was definitely hard to leave. We would recommend it to anyone!
5510720,40897677,2015-08-03,583410,Mee-Sun,"Peter was a great host! He was really responsive, gave great directions, and was very accommodating. We landed super late in Seattle, and the check in process was easy with a lockbox on site. We also had a late check out on Sunday, and he was very open to letting us stay for the afternoon until our flight. He left great instructions in the apartment, and overall we had a very seamless experience.

About the place:
- The place itself was a great size for us (just two people). I think if you have any more it would be pretty crowded.
- The location is great, and is walking distance to good food and bars in Capital Hill. 
- The place is just like it is in the pictures! It's super cute, very well designed, and is a cozy modern place.
- The kitchen was well stocked with flatware, pots, pans, etc (even though we didn't use it).
- The bathroom was also well stocked with tons of towels and bath supplies.

Things to be aware of:
- There was some street noise because the apartment is on the second floor next to the street. You can hear cars and some people if they walk by. (Note: it was also really hot in Seattle so we slept with the windows open -- not sure if the noise is an issue with the windows closed).
- The apartment is more like a junior one bedroom than a regular one bedroom apartment. The bedroom is a small, slightly enclosed room (no door) with just enough space for the bed."
5510720,41931252,2015-08-10,27719583,Crystalyn,"Correspondence with Peter and Kelli was very easy prior to the trip. Before arrival they gave us detailed instructions of how to access their unit, they were very helpful and easy to follow.  Their unit is very efficiently laid out and had all of the essentials. They knew our flight was delayed and that we would be celebrating our honeymoon and left us a fabulous bottle of wine and a really nice note attached along with a welcome note on their chalkboard wall. The location was amazing, walkable to anything, or a short uber ride.  Thank you Petter and Kelli! We had an amazing time !"
5510720,43993851,2015-08-23,4565254,Ben,"Amazing place, amazing location, and an amazing host. 

Apartment was clean, well-appointed, and all-around as-advertised . . . even down to the French press set!

Peter was exceptionally responsive and quickly responded to the one or two questions I had over the course of my stay. 

Altogether, a great time!"
5510720,45057657,2015-08-31,17888810,Meghan,"Peter's apartment was everything we could have hoped for. We went to Seattle for a wedding in Capitol Hill. Peter's apartment was in the perfect location. There were great spots to walk to for brunch every morning, and it was a quick uber ride to downtown. The apartment was VERY clean and very quiet, even with it facing the street! I would recommend staying at Peter's if you are looking for a place in Seattle."
5510720,46116210,2015-09-08,8306625,Lisa,"We couldn't have asked for a better experience for our first time in Seattle. Peter's place was very nice — cute, modern, clean and had everything we needed. It was in the perfect location: Walkable to shops, restaurants, bars and just a quick Uber or bus trip away from  downtown. Check in and check out was super easy and Peter was great to communicate with. Loved it!"
5510720,48080997,2015-09-23,40124651,Ivan,"We had a great time renting out this location. Peter's place is about a 15 minute walk from all the great touristy downtown attractions, and there was a lot to see in the Capitol Hill neighborhood as well. His place was clean and safe and complete with coffee, towels, and shampoo. In addition, Peter was very helpful in making sure we got inside okay, even though our flight got in after 11 pm. 

We would highly recommend his place to anyone. "
5510720,48709979,2015-09-28,40311057,Christine,"Peter's apartment was perfect for our first trip to Seattle. It was a lovely walk to the downtown area, but his neighborhood also had a lot to offer, from restaurants and bars to cute boutique stores. The apartment was clean and decorated very nicely; it was the perfect space for my boyfriend and I to stay in together. All in all, this was the best airbnb stay we had on our vacation to the northwest and we hope to be back soon!"
5510720,49219479,2015-10-02,14386344,Christian,"sehr cooles Apartment in einer extrem coolen, hippen Gegend. Capitol Hill ist zwar zu Fuß ca. 20 Minuten vom Zentrum entfernt, aber eine sehr lebendige, junge Gegend mit vielen super Lokalen und Bars (und dem besten Eisgeschäft, das ich in USA gefunden habe)
Die Wohnung ist sauber, groß, sehr gut ausgerüstet und ruhig - sehr empfehlenswert ! Einzig die zwei Block entfernte Feuerwehrstation sorgt manchmal für Lärm beim Ausfahren. Parken ist Abends gut möglich - untertags gilt eine Maximale Parkdauer von 2 Stunden..."
4598160,24392707,2014-12-27,22071187,Nathan,"Great guy, extremely flexible, and very much in with the spirit of AirBnB. I wouldn't be surprised if he has a history of hosting couchsurfers. "
4598160,24693027,2015-01-01,24843827,Wil,"geoff is the BEST! 
we got a full weeknight tour of the neighborhood & he patiently waited while we wandered through the record store. 
the space is simple, clean, & cozy! 
he's super flexible & very helpful! 
we had a great time in phinney ridge & can't wait to return! "
4598160,24973073,2015-01-04,21236031,Kasumi,"Geoff is a great host. He showed us town and neighbor. And also it's a  convenient place to take buses.
He is super kind,generous. The house is clean and pretty."
4598160,25441621,2015-01-16,20194589,기ㅁ,He is nice man. We hang out and dance together. 
4598160,25603318,2015-01-20,2034270,Rachael,"Geoffrey has great place! It was perfect for me. He is a very kind and generous man. The bed was very comfortable. The room was spacious with an extra closet that was just for the guest. I mentioned that it would be nice to have a hair dryer and he had one the next morning! Again, great host!"
4598160,25945889,2015-01-30,5439124,Toby,"Geoff is truly one of the nicest people you'll ever meet. His place is small but very clean, neat, cozy and comfortable. My girlfriend and I have stayed with him twice and are already booked up for another trip. He always goes out of his way to be welcoming and accommodating. If you stay with Geoff you'll soon have a friend in Seattle!"
4598160,26054473,2015-02-02,7300510,Kristina,I just wanted to say what a great experience it was staying at Geof's.  He was a wonderful host open to any questions I had.  The space was comfortable and immaculate and close to lots of great spots.  I will certainly look to stay there again the next time I visit Seattle! 
4598160,26246993,2015-02-08,22480528,Sooyoung,"Geoffrey is a great host. I stayed only 2 nights and hung out with my friend in Seattle, so I didn't have much time to stay with him. But still, he was kind and thoughtful. The room is just exactly the same as the pictures. It was warm enough to sleep and rest even in the winter. I will definitely stay again if I come to Seattle next time!"
4598160,26743211,2015-02-18,2910039,Logan,We had a great experience at Geoff's place! He was a very warm host and enthusiastic about the local community. I felt like I was a local! The space is really cute and there were so many details that were well thought out. We had a great time and hope to stay there agains soon!
4598160,26898037,2015-02-21,27676882,Lorin,"I had a great time staying with Geoff this week. This was my first Airbnb experience, and I was not disappointed in the slightest. The place was great, and the company was even better.  I'm glad I picked Geoff's place, and if you're thinking about staying here... stop thinking about it and just do it. I would definitely stay here again."
4598160,27339072,2015-03-02,7005260,Amy,"Geoff was a wonderful host -- friendly, welcoming, and prepared with everything from shampoo to suggestions for things to see and do in the city. The apartment is in a great location (lots of shops, cafes, and restaurants nearby!), and it's quite close to bus stops as well. All in all, an excellent experience -- would definitely stay again!"
4598160,27452306,2015-03-04,28461874,Josh,I got to Phinney Ridge around 1 pm. Geoffrey was welcoming. The room was very spacious and clean. He's a friendly and informative host.
4598160,27486654,2015-03-05,28461874,Josh,"I liked staying here. It was close to everything. It was only 15-20 minutes to downtown Seattle. It's a scenic place. The room was nice and well-kept. Geoffrey could not have been a better host. At the end he offered me a free latte and pastry at his coffee house, Fresh Flours!"
4598160,27567087,2015-03-07,9397820,Ashley,A perfect airbnb experience! Geoff is an incredibly kind and gracious host - his apartment is clean and comfortable and stocked with all the amenities you could need. I'd recommend staying at his place without hesitation!
4598160,27618360,2015-03-08,28511898,Rebecca,"Geoffrey and his home were as gently welcoming as light entering through bedroom windows. Just like the photos he shared of the room, the space was filled with soft sunlight the morning we awoke in Seattle. There is a cedar tree right outside the window and the chickadees sang to us as we began our day.  My only wish is that I had planned a longer stay. It was a beautiful time to be in the neighborhood. The homes and shops of Phinney Ridge were  surrounded by flowering daffodils, a variety of curious shrubbery and people with kind smiles, just like Geoffrey's. "
4598160,27823827,2015-03-12,27615915,Nikolay,"very friendly host, as soon as I arrived, he invited me to a party in honor of the birthday of his friend, it was really fun! clean and comfortable house with all amenities, I can advise everyone !.)"
4598160,27906859,2015-03-14,7138050,Jeff,Great experience! Such a charming little place in a great location. Host was super accommodating and made sure I was taken care of. Parking was surprisingly easy for a densely populated area too. I would absolutely stay here again!!
4598160,28015387,2015-03-16,25803616,Cora,"Geoff was such a wonderful host, he was so warm and inviting and enthusiastic about telling us great places to go in Seattle! His place was as described and probably even cuter than I imagined. It was very clean and the bed was so comfortable. It's such a great apartment and the location was perfect for catching the bus to downtown and a really nice neighborhood to just walk around in!"
4598160,28154333,2015-03-18,18366793,Lilian,"We had an awesome time staying with Geoff. His apartment is beautiful (so well designed!) in a great location - a little quieter than Seattle, but close to a lot of cool neighborhoods. Geoff is such a chill, pleasant person, and is great to talk to. He gave us great suggestions for things to do and places to check out. Make sure to stop by the coffee shop he works at down the road - great food and coffee!"
4598160,28238859,2015-03-20,29009563,The,"I had a wonderful stay at Geoffrey's place, and he is a supernice host.  We went to bar together with his friends to celebrate the St. Patrick's Day, and he took me to an exciting local live.  I wish I could spend more days there."
4598160,28516363,2015-03-25,25117059,Soleil,"Upon arrival, Geoffrey was warm, inviting, and excited to welcome me to his apartment. It's in a great central location in a cool part of town (bus stop right outside the front door, bars and restaurants within walking distance, too). During my stay, he was conscientious of my privacy but since we had mutual tastes and friends, ended up hanging out quite a bit which was awesome while traveling alone. The space was wonderful, exactly as described, and I would love to stay there again when I'm back in the city. Most of all, Geoffrey is a rad human being and I feel lucky to have crossed paths with him. "
4598160,28707029,2015-03-29,13163760,Susan,"Geoff is a very welcoming and flexible host. He keeps his place very tidy and comfortable. He really knows the area and will even offer to take you to places nearby. If you’re looking for a friendly host, Geoff is your guy!"
4598160,28916964,2015-03-31,29955221,Caroline,"Geoffrey was very accommodating and easy to chat with.  His apartment is clean and comfy as well as in a GREAT location. 
He knew lots about the area and was able to provide suggestions about places to visit/eat/hang out.  Would totally stay there again! "
4598160,29011713,2015-04-02,2465042,Lynn,"Geoffrey was an awesome host and super welcoming. He went the extra mile and showed us around Seattle and even lent us some bus fare money as we had no American. He was great to give us a lot of information about cool spots to check out including cafes, pubs and the local music scene. His apartment is very cozy, clean and nicely decorated. The neighbourhood was in a good location with lots around and an easy bus to downtown! Would definitely reccomend! :)"
4598160,29083003,2015-04-03,28530573,Paul,"Geoffrey was quick to reply and very friendly. Upon our arrival, he gave an informative run down and recommendations of local places. The room we stayed in was clean, well-kept with plenty of fresh air circulation. Geoff's persona was the bonus to an already-wonderful room and board. 
Be sure to try his coffee if you wake up early enough!"
4598160,29411722,2015-04-07,28333154,Wang,"Super nice host, lovely room, it is not super big but it got everything you need, there are also many restaurants and stuff around so it is very convenient. So five stars:)"
4598160,30045379,2015-04-16,29929972,Joel,Geoph was an awesome Host! He not only made me feel right at home but he genuinely made me feel like a friend. I actually ended up tagging along with him and his coffee friends during the coffee championships and got a full on coffee tour. It was awesome considering that's exactly what I wanted to do in Seattle. His apartment is also uniquely furnished with 1920s antique furniture and is kept very tidy. It also smells like citrus and sage all the time! Stay here!
4598160,30103017,2015-04-17,15021728,Alyssa,Geoffrey was incredible!  He toured me around Seattle and showed me as much as possible during my short stay.  His home is cozy and clean and his energy is warm and welcoming. Great experience and I would totally stay again!
4598160,30229393,2015-04-19,8916636,Matt,"For over 2 years, I've been an Airbnb host but never a guest.  Geoffrey made me a believer in Airbnb!  In almost an instant after arriving, I felt like I was visiting an old friend.  Over the course of my stay, I was fortunate enough to spend quite a lot of time getting to know the area with him to where I felt like a local - I felt confident about the city and where I was staying.  I don't know if I'd be loving Seattle as much as I do if it weren't for this Airbnb experience!! BONUS: he's got great maps pinned on the wall for you to familiarize yourself with the neighborhoods and the overall area!"
4598160,30386418,2015-04-21,21400501,Colleen,"Geoffrey was extremely friendly, super flexible, open, giving, and helpful. I enjoyed his company, especially the first night when he showed my friend and I a great Mexican restaurant near his home. He and I ended up exploring Ballard together, also a great time, a real connection."
4598160,30921247,2015-04-29,26203477,Marie Louise,"Geoffrey has been an absolutely amazing host! He is super friendly, generous, easy-going and nice. He was so helpful from day one. We hung out a few days and he showed me the charming and awesome neighborhoods near our neighborhood. Always ready to give advise with shops, restaurants ect. 
I feel very lucky that I got to meet this nice and interesting guy. We had so much fun and I am so happy that Geoffrey offered to show me parts of the city with all the locals that I never would have seen by myself! He is a very cool guy!! 
The room was nice, clean and perfect. Kitchen and bathroom nice and clean as well! "
4598160,31068377,2015-05-01,27073377,Taylor,"Geoff was incredibly helpful from the moment that I booked my stay with him. He provided helpful tips for transportation, areas to visit, and even offered to meet me downtown when I got off the train, in order to make things more convenient. It's obvious that Geoff really enjoys the airbnb experience and loves meeting new people. 

Geoff's apartment was incredibly neat, welcoming, and comfortable and was fairly accessible to downtown Seattle while also being close in proximity to many other excellent neighbourhoods. 

Although my trip was very short, I was very thankful so have had such a pleasant airbnb experience with Geoff.

Thank you! "
4598160,31144925,2015-05-02,26536229,Christa,"Geoff was very welcoming, I felt right at home. His place is super cute and very clean, and smells amazing. I felt comfortable and safe taking a walk in the neighborhood around twilight by myself.

I was having an upsetting week and Geoff took time to listen to me, and invited me to hang out with his friends."
4598160,31402918,2015-05-04,32146783,Gabriel,"First of all I would like to thank Geoffrey for this really nice week end in Seattle (2 days). Geoffrey spent a lot of time with us, visiting the city, showing us the nice spots of Seattle (that normally tourists for short period will miss) such as markets, nice bar in ballard, Free spot to see whole Seattle bay.. and so on. 

The room (/flat) is more than fine and cosy. The quality is really good (for a low price) and the flat is in the middle of the resident area (not downtown). When you don t know seattle you are a bit afraid to be a bit far from the city center but in fact you re in the real nice spot with a lot of life. 

To summarize, I had a wonderfull time visiting Seattle and mostly because of Geoffrey. "
4598160,31670139,2015-05-08,24472527,Stephanie,"Couldn't have had a better Seattle experience if it wasn't for Geoff. He's such a great and humble guy that will accommodate you after your needs and/or wishes. Will leave you space or be super social - it's up to you! Thanks for a great stay, Geoff. See you in Sweden! "
4598160,31926939,2015-05-11,3263407,Nina,"We LOVED staying with Geoffrey! He is an angel. He considered all our needs, gave us excellent local insider advice, and even offered us a lift downtown on a busy Saturday afternoon...way beyond the call of duty. He took really good care of us, and also gave us lots of space and privacy to do our own thing.

The apartment is immaculate and tastefully decorated in ""seattle zen"" style: simple, clean, comfortable, homey, peaceful and well appointed with all the amenities. The guest room is perfect, with a little folding table attached to the wall, a big empty wardrobe to unpack into, big windows overlooking the lively neighbourhood, ironing board, etc. Plus there were organic candies by the cozy bed, all natural teas in the kitchen, and Geoff uses chemical free cleaning products which we really appreciated. We were very comfortable.

The neighbourhood was also great: a bus on the doorstep, shopping nearby, and Thai food and burgers right across the street. Parking was easy, with Geoff moving his car to accommodate us, as well as helping us with our bags. 

Can't wait to come back! "
4598160,32041971,2015-05-12,6243427,Jeremiah,Just as described. Geoff was great.

Geoffrey really helped me and showed me the neighborhoods around. He's a great guy! 
The place is located 10/20minutes from downtown in bus, really peaceful and calm. The flat was great, really clean! 
Everything was awesome."
4598160,32388674,2015-05-17,30806224,Sarah,"My friend and I stayed with Geoff for 2 nights for a quick tourist weekend. We found the location perfect and convenient. Clean and private room with every amenity needed. Geoff gave walking neighborhood tours and even a few rides. Geoff enjoys talking/hanging out. If you have private plans, be upfront."
4598160,32574119,2015-05-19,31984169,Kourtnee,We had a late flight into Seattle and left early the next morning and Geoffrey was very kind and accomodating despite our very short stay.  We enjoyed breakfast at his coffee shop the next morning on our wait.  Would definitely recommend him.  
4598160,32728665,2015-05-20,21737152,Marjo,"Geoff, thank you for the amazing two days - we loved everything about our stay and it couldn't have been better.

Other Airbnb guests, don't miss this gem when in Seattle. Geoff is a super host in every way and his place is absolutely beautiful. Everything is as described in the listing - or better. We'll be back."

4598160,33014860,2015-05-24,17829830,Shiying,"It was very random how I found Geoffrey's place. I didn't read any review before booking. Now I got to read other people's words and they are all true. 

Geoffrey is friendly, personable and accommodating. He keeps his place clean, cute and tastefully decorated, with awesome amenities (organic products and herbal tea). He showed me around the neighborhood and give me all the useful advice. I would've missed a ton if I were on my own.Thank you, Geoff!

Geoff gave us a lot of tips and things to do. Room was clean and tidy. Loved his apartment. We went to Red Mills Burgers with him. It was great. On our last day we went to his coffee shop where he worked near by and there coffee and breads were amazing. All and all a great experience as a first time airbnb user! Thanks again Geoff for being so chill and cool.

We are so happy we stayed with him!  The room exceeded our expectations.  Geoff has thought of details to make the guest/s experience richer like extensive maps, guides, and travel books.  The bed itself is comfortable, and the bath stocked with premium towels, and a terrific shower head.   The neighborhood is on a bus line, and near many conveniences.  Because of family in the area, we didn't take advantage of Geoff's offers to guide us around the area. We would certainly recommend a stay with him when in Seattle!"
4598160,34799690,2015-06-12,5704486,Rob,"We loved Geoffrey's home very much. We immediately felt at home, and thanks to Geoffrey's tips for things to do in the neighborhood we had a great time.

4598160,35102487,2015-06-15,32667436,Cassandra,"I had an amazing experience with Geoff, he is very accommodating and is really easy going. He has so much to offer to people that are truly first time visitors to seattle. His hosting style is so thoughtful, from his lyft code to the maps of seattle adorned on his walls. His place was very clean and always smelled really good too. I had a lot of airline issues before getting to Seattle so it was so relieving to go to a place that was so comforting after such a hectic experience with the airport. He was super accommodating and I truly felt like I was staying with a friend. Everything was super convenient with restaurants, shops, and green lake within walking distance. I would definitely choose to stay here again if I were to return to Seattle. Thanks Geoff!"
4598160,35432978,2015-06-18,18288380,Enrique,"This guy is awesome, such a great host, and overall a great person! Nice cozy place with a really comfortable bed. If you are planning a trip for Seattle, look no further! So glad i stayed here!"
4598160,35695592,2015-06-21,20283602,Jessica,"Wow, this was my FIRST Air B&B experience and I honestly cannot think of a single criticism. Geoff is incredibly kind and accommodating. His place has EVERYTHING you will need to feel comfortable and at home. He even took us out to Capitol Hill on a Friday night and we all had so much fun. My only regret is not staying longer at Cedar Tree. It was perfect and I cannot wait to return to Seattle to see Geoff and stay at the Cedar Tree! He really set the bar high for all of my future Air B&B bookings. Oh yeah, the bed was SOOOO comfortable - it was like sleeping on a cloud... :)"
4598160,35950921,2015-06-23,34533289,Steven,"This was my very first experience with airbnb, and Geoff is the best host I could ever hope for! He is super sweet and left us a hand-written note on the table every morning. I can tell that the interior space has been very tastefully designed. Every little detail on the walls, in the kitchen, and in the bathroom was added to enhance the home-feeling experience. This is going to be the place I will always go back to whenever I visit Seattle in the future."
4598160,36172421,2015-06-26,29619665,Hyeong Jun,"His house was so clean and he was very kind to us. As well as, we made some really great memories thanks to his. I wanna recommend that with him, if you wanna visit Seattle. His house is little far away from downtown of Seattle, but Seattle is smaller than other city. So you will not problem that."
4598160,36346866,2015-06-27,35633010,Swenja,Geoff is a very friendly host and made us feel very welcome. We even got invited to a little party with his neighbors and loved it. His place is very clean and peaceful. Definitely recommended!
4598160,36455480,2015-06-28,23190478,Pit,Geoff was incredibly welcoming and helpful. We were being a bit difficult guests because we had a late arrival and came with two large bicycle boxes that we needed to dispose off and Geoff was very understanding and got us sorted out. His place is very cute and impeccably clean. We felt very welcome and a free coffee and scone in the morning from the coffee shop where he works was a great bonus. We had a fantastic stay at Geoff's place and would absolutely recommend him as a host!
4598160,37391795,2015-07-06,13593070,Haruka,"Geoff is a very nice guy who is thoughtful and accommodating. On the first day he went and got us a fan to use due to the hot weather. Also got us a pan to cook with for the oven. The room provided to us was cute and welcoming. My partner and I really enjoyed our time. Lots of places to eat, cafe, shopping. Additionally, there wasn't a lot of hills at his place. His neighborhood is super ideal for people who wants to explore Seattle but be able to relax at the same time."
4598160,37535447,2015-07-07,33388503,Juliana,"Es un excelente anfritrion, super recommendado "

The neighbourhood is spot on, with great watering holes (alcoholic and coffee related) only a stone throw away. 
It was the best experience we have ever had with airbnb. Will be back in a flash when I get the chance to return to this great city!  "
4598160,38754416,2015-07-18,36881248,Susan,"Our first AirBnB experience was a definitely good one. Geoff welcomed us, made us comfortable, and was a great resource on where and how to get the best of Seattle and the surrounding areas."

The neighborhood was quiet and we slept very well. Very cool guy,  treated us to some coffee before we headed out on our way. Nothing but good vibes about our stay. "
4598160,39049421,2015-07-20,16094960,Svetlana,"Cozy space in a cute old building in a nice, walkable neighbourhood. Geoffrey was very friendly and welcoming, had great communication throughout and made check in super easy even though we got in kinda late. You can tell the building is old, but the room is large, the bed is comfortable and the kitchen is available for use so  it's perfect for a couple to stay. Also, the wifi is fast which is awesome! Would definitely stay again, thank you for hosting us! "
4598160,39277840,2015-07-22,32923051,Lisa,"Geoffs space was beautiful, extremely clean and accommodating and close to a lot of really great neighborhoods. He was really laid back, made us feel welcome and was an amazing host."

The neighborhood is so nice for walking, nice restaurants and grocery store just 2 blocks away. Green lake so close that you can easy go for a walk or jogging. You can't miss the pastry and tea at the coffee shop where Geoff works. We enjoy a lot our stay. Defenetly coming bak to Geoff's and recomnend the place to any friend. We even had seattle chocolates in our room... adorable!!!!"

He like a friend more than a host, and the coffee shop he worked is my favorite place would like come back again. Super tasty green tea muffins. Even before the moment I backed to lax, still tried again. I could imagine in the near future he might be top host in (email hidden)eat experience."
4598160,39935604,2015-07-27,34238488,Annie,"This was our first time with Airbnb and it was glorious! Geoffrey was a warm and welcoming host that was more than happy to give advice, show us around the neighbourhood and help in anyway possible. This entire listing, including personal description and abode was spot on. 
This was in a great location that was easily accessible to Ballard and Fremont, along with being a nice area itself, it is close to a bus route downtown. We would definitely stay here again as well as recommend it to others.

4598160,43965454,2015-08-23,24948252,Sean,"Geoffrey was amazingly pleasant and a fantastic host. He greeted us at the front and replied to each update we had about our visit into Seattle (traffic woes). Once there, he made us feel like we just became a part of the neighborhood and the building. His knowledge of the local area was fascinating and definitely allowed us to capture some great moments touring the local scene. He has wonderful maps and posters of the surrounding area and great recommendations with his expertise as a local business owner. "
4598160,44406980,2015-08-26,22659290,Janika,"It was really nice staying at Geoffrey's  house . He is such a nice and warm hearted person ! His apartment is neat and clean and he does everything to make you feel comfortable at his place :)

I love every detail in his place! Very clean and very confortable. The area close by is very convenient for our stay, there you can find to many Restaurants, Super Market and everything  you need.

I think, Geoff must be a best friend to many people, he is so nice, helpful and friendly that you think you have known him already for a long time, thanks for your hospitality!"
4598160,45517730,2015-09-03,42156994,Grace,Had a great time! Geoff was a great dude that spent a lot of time showing us around the city. Highly recommended for anyone who's looking for a host and not just a place to sleep.

4598160,46291493,2015-09-09,22022230,Claire,"My experience with Geoff was exactly what you expect from an airbnb experience. He was keen to share his apartment and his neighborhood with travelers and was warm, communicative and helpful. The room was a sweet, comfortable space that felt like it was in a treetop. And the apartment indeed is in the top of a little brick apartment building on the top of a hill in a great neighborhood to explore. If you walk down one direction you quickly get to beautiful Green Lake. Go in other directions and you will be in one of Seattle's many happening commercial districts with great restaurants, cafes, parks and businesses all around."
4598160,46450383,2015-09-10,12813079,Phil,"Super kind and friendly fellow and a lovely, comfortable, quiet spot. So close to delicious food too!"
4598160,46904280,2015-09-14,10828471,Rhea,"Geoff is the warmest, most thoughtful airbnb host I have every had the pleasure of staying with! He went out of his way to show us around and take us to places we'd like (beach sunset, great farmer's market, breweries). The apartment is warm, nicely decorated and immaculately clean. It seems Geoff has put a lot of thought into nice little touches - chocolates and granola bars in the bedroom, for example. The bedroom is quite spacious, with a nice bed, a couch and a fold out table if you want to write or sit down to eat in the room. Phinney Ridge is a great neighbourhood to stay in - it's leafy and attractive and has a great vibe. From here, it's easy to check out Fremont, Green Lake, or Ballard - all great neighbourhoods to explore on foot. There are some great spots to grab a coffee or a bite nearby - including a yummy Mexican punk rock joint that's open late."
4598160,47114382,2015-09-15,24501530,Karyn,"Geoffrey was a great host, indeed....quiet, unassuming but very concerned for our wellbeing. His apartment was exceptionally clean, well appointed and inviting. We would stay with Geoffrey  again...especially  since we did not get to try out his coffee and pastries this time around."
4598160,47274743,2015-09-17,21541093,Thomas,"Great location in Seattle and almost close to all my destinations. Jeff is a very easy-going and communicative person, and he gave a detailed oral introduction of where to see and how Washington State/Seattle is so different from other places. We enjoyed our time in Jeff's place, and plus the coffee shop he works in serves wonderful coffee. Can't wait for another re-visit. "
4598160,47395364,2015-09-18,42767709,Marie,Geoffrey is a gracious host and made me feel welcome from the minute I arrived (early by accident).  His apartment is neat and efficient.  His location is perfect for an urban traveler who likes to walk through neighborhoods and experience the local color.  He has plenty of information and advice on places to visit and dine.  
4598160,47947622,2015-09-21,22696144,Andrew,"Geoff is great: easily the best airbnb host I've encountered. It was my first day in Seattle ever, and he gave me a thorough overview of the city's many interesting and diverse neighborhoods, things to do and see, places to hike. Geoff has lived in Seattle for 5 years, so he has an intimate knowledge of the city without forgetting what it was like to be a newcomer, thereby giving sound advice. I always felt very welcome. He even made me coffee the next morning. 

The neighborhood is quite lovely too: close to many restaurants, a grocery store, and Green Lake. 

It is obvious that Geoff hosts travelers for more than the extra income. I absolutely plan on recommending this listing to friends and family in the future. "
4598160,48296178,2015-09-25,21596354,Alex,"Geoffrey was an excellent host! He was waiting outside the building for us when we arrived. He was warm and hospitable in his sweet and refreshingly simple abode. Everything was as described, but the bamboo sheets and Seattle chocolates kicked it up a notch. Would definitely come back!"
4598160,49586926,2015-10-05,2991870,Pauline,"We had a great stay at Geoff's place - the apartment is clean, tidy, calm and peaceful. The bedroom is big and the bed very comfortable! We stayed for 3 nights and strongly recommend anyone else spend some time in Seattle, in the neighbourhood and with Geoff! We had an amazing time in Seattle thanks to him. So thanks again Geoff for making us so welcome and we really hope to see you in France or Scotland !"
4598160,50484830,2015-10-12,43543927,Nyla,"Geoff was great! Very welcoming and a cool dude overall. Gave me a bunch of recommendations, and was a gracious host without being too overwhelming. He invites you to chill with him at the coffee shop where he works, but also lets you do your own thing. Made my first airbnb experience a great one. The room itself was great! Small but spacious and has everything you'd want."
4598160,50906543,2015-10-15,3389665,Kris,"Geoffrey met me outside his building with a warm welcome, and introduced me to the space. Accommodations are clean, inviting, convenient and quiet. He made me feel at home. He is an engaging conversationalist, interested in others, definitely a community builder. I'm impressed!"
4598160,51275733,2015-10-19,39175304,Joan,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Geoffrey's home.  We loved the charming apartment, the delightful Phinney Ridge neighborhood and best of all - Geoffrey! Geoffrey is a host extraordinaire with a gift for hospitality. He knows how to ensure that guests feel completely welcome and comfortable. He really goes out of his way to help the tourist in every way he can - from recommendations of places to eat, explore/visit, and any other questions that might come up (helpful bus info!). The cozy home is just as pictured and described. We loved it! Geoffrey really thinks of everything and I don't think there could be a more thoughtful, caring, kind, and generous AirBNB host anywhere!  We have a new friend and can't wait to return!"
4598160,51682460,2015-10-22,8880284,Jun,"The place was clean and had very welcoming and hospitable ambience.  I cannot pinpoint the exact reason but Geoffrey's place emitted one of the most comfortable ambience among all the airbnb places I've stayed. It's cozy yet spacious, and the walls are decorated with maps and pictures, yet uncluttered. There is no artificiality about either the place or Geoffrey. 

I only had very brief interaction with Geoffrey because of my schedule. He accommodated my early check in and made sure I had everything I needed. He came across as very warm and friendly person. 

I highly recommend Geoffrey's place to anyone visiting Seattle.

"
4598160,51982395,2015-10-25,22024236,Oscar,"Geoffrey is an amazing host! He has a beautiful and welcoming space for guests to stay in that felt comfortable, cosy and enjoyable to spend time in. When he learned that we were new to the city and wanted to look around, he was an incredible tour guide. He showed us several neighborhoods, local spots, shared stories and coffee with us at his coffee shop and made our stay in Seattle very memorable. A definite super host with a beautiful space to share, we'd recommend Geoffrey in a heartbeat. "
4598160,52562922,2015-10-30,8090671,Tessa,"Geoff was an incredibly kind and generous host. He has created a comfortable and inviting atmosphere for guests and instantly made us feel at home. Wonderful location, wonderful apartment, wonderful person. "

4598160,53628383,2015-11-10,46990298,Bonghyun,It was wonderful staying at Cedar Tree Seattle. Geoffrey was an amazing host who made our trip up to Seattle wonderful. His place is clean and he was very accommodating. 
4598160,53958217,2015-11-15,28472763,Richard,"Geoff was probably one of the nicest guys I have encountered during my travels.
He instantly makes you feel at home. He has tons of recommendations for you on what to do and where to go. His apartment is really cosy. Everything was neatly prepared for my stay; there even was some chocolate ready for me on the dresser! 
Great location of his apartment, too. All in all, one of the most pleasant Airbnb-experiences I've had so far!"

He made me feel at home right away and even treated me to coffee and a pastry at the coffee shop where he works. His apartment is cozy and clean, with a spacious bedroom, and located in a fantastic neighborhood - lots of restaurants, cafes, and other fun things nearby. It's very walkable and close to bus lines and major throughways. I'd definitely stay here again on my next Seattle visit!"
4598160,56134987,2015-12-09,3655292,Bran,"Geoff was an amazing host! A very kind and warm person, he offered up a nice tour of a nearby neighborhood that we wanted to check out for a late dinner. Sadly we didnt get to spend much time in the area, but look forward to staying in touch!

The room (and whole flat) was very clean and comfortable, fresh sheets and towels and lots of amenities in the bathroom. 

Definitely a very peaceful place to stay! Thanks again, Geoff!"

8193241,46602125,2015-09-12,33403550,Bill,We understand that we were the first guests in this apartment and Sarah went out of her way to make us comfortable. The unit's location is great and we would most assuredly recommend this to all Airbnb users as well as other seekers of accommodation.
8193241,47042838,2015-09-15,6370078,Loretta,The apartment was clean and lots of light in the living room. It was near lots of great restaurants with different price ranges and just a few blocks from Pike Place Market. We had a great time!
8193241,47404618,2015-09-18,1001726,Debra,"While we did not meet Sarah personally, she was there in every way we needed as we made our reentry into the United States after a wonderful, crazy summer abroad. The apartment building was fairly new in our estimation and offered a fantastic view of Capitol Hill and downtown. Double paned glass kept noise to an absolute minimum. It was perfect for one or two people to visit Seattle and take in the sights, and it was perfect for me to rest and relax while my husband took care of business visits at his office around the corner. We will definitely be back."
8193241,47530064,2015-09-20,30870360,Ron,"We had a wonderful experience with Sarah and staying at her condo. The place was as described (fantastic!) , her instructions were easy to follow, and she was easy to reach to answer my questions. It made our weekend in Seattle so enjoyable, as the place was near everything as well the Convention Center where we were attending a seminar. The condo and building was immaculate. We are hoping to stay there again next year! Thank you Sarah!"
8193241,49354939,2015-10-03,21701298,Michel,"Our stay in Seattle was great, thanks (among other things) to Sarah's appartment.
The building is brand new and gorgeous, and the apartment was perfect with nice view.
If I come back in Seattle I would definitely book it again!"
8193241,49840521,2015-10-06,32197983,Adolph,"We had a fantastic stay in Seattle. When we arrived Robert, who works in the leasing office, gave us the rundown of the building. He was very welcoming and very helpful.  He told us we had access to all the amenities and informed how to use the key fob. The doormen were all very helpful and welcomed us everything we walked into the building. They were happy to answer our questions and just made us feel welcomed. The apartment was fantastic. It was super clean and the view was great. We didn't spend much time in the apartment but, having a great place to stay is very important to me because it can make your your trip so much better. It's located between Capitol Hill and downtown so, you're a short walk to something great and delicious. I will definitely stay here again when I return to Seattle."
8193241,50765783,2015-10-14,8642335,Starlet,"Perfect place to stay, very clean, perfect location! "

I can't say enough good things about this Airbnb! We definitely plan on visiting the city again and staying here again! "
8193241,52635314,2015-10-31,10396908,Adrian,"Sarah's place was perfect. Check in / check out process a breeze. The apartment is super modern, comfortable, well decorated and clean. Definitely gave me a warm and home-ey feel while I was in town. Location is great and super central easy to walk everywhere. Great home base while in Seattle and I plan to return! "
8193241,53903583,2015-11-14,46372388,Peter,Great location!  Lots of professionals.  Extremely quiet and peaceful.   Door person was extremely helpful.  Very nice apartment.
8193241,54257658,2015-11-17,25134901,Bryan,"We had a great stay at this unit. The building and the unit itself are very nice and modern. It had everything we needed for a 3 night stay. Great location. Walking distance to lots of restaurants, bars, shopping, and sightseeing. Sarah was very helpful and everything went very smoothly."
8193241,55002185,2015-11-27,17314480,Janice,"Sarah provided us with a clean and modern apartment during our vacation. It was very close to seattle downtown area. And, also close to main shuttle stops. 
Sarah is also very approachable for any questions I have.  Good experience. :)"
8193241,55578787,2015-12-02,35518261,Greg,Great location with a great view! Nice unit and Sarah was very accommodating with a last minute request I had! 
8193241,56319300,2015-12-12,26274888,Sev,Sarah was a great host.  She responded very quickly when there was a small miscommunication and made sure everything was worked out.  I would recommend staying with her.  
8193241,56603455,2015-12-15,25109435,Tzelon,"I really liked this place! Very modern, clean, and fancy!"
8193241,57129941,2015-12-22,47496984,Lovelyn,"As my 1st Air Bnb experiences this set the bar. The facility was immaculate. Sarah allowed us to check in early at 12p vs. the regular 3p check-in. She was very responsive with my messages as my flight landed at 10:30am in Seattle. It was very easy to find & only s short was from the light rail station from 5th. Even in the rain it was easy to find! The building is beautiful with all the right amenities. The apt itself is
As it was in the pictures. An amazing view.. Every room was very clean. The sheet were a  little hard and crisp.. Probably very new. But still s very inviting and comfortable apt to stay in. Everything was within walking distance. And Sarah was very accommodating to us as my boyfriend and I got sick on our trip and needed a little more time to check out. The concierge staff was very nice and we definitely will use Sarah again if we are ever back in Seattle. "
2836237,25867152,2015-01-27,1393469,Tatiana,"Bart's place was quiet, convenient and clean. He was super helpful and friendly. Highly recommend for location and beautiful Seattle views! Would definitely stay again. "
2836237,26112480,2015-02-03,11850678,Andrew,Staying at Bart's studio was a great experience. He was prompt and accessible whenever needed and the apartment was clean and comfortable. Quick access to many parts of Seattle was another plus.
2836237,26232128,2015-02-07,3374051,Michael,"Cozy, modern studio.  Perfect for 1 or a couple.  Great location, easy walk to Broadway stores, restaurants, and night life.  It was fairly easy for us to find street parking (within 10min of searching).  "
2836237,26340448,2015-02-09,18146506,Courtney,"Great space, would absolutely stay there again! Beautiful view of Seattle with a modern twist. Bart was easy to communicate with and the apartment was incredible! I would absolutely stay here again!"
2836237,26797530,2015-02-19,2498773,Derek,"I loved staying at Bart's apartment. It was cozy, furnished amazingly, and had a great view. It was particularly clear in Seattle this week so in addition to the skyline you could see all the mountains in the distance too. Bart was easy to connect with and check in and check out went smoothly. I hope to stay again next time I visit!"
2836237,26951776,2015-02-22,25147083,Eric,The room was great and it had easy access to the city yet was tucked away to hide from the noise from the streets.   Bart made it very easy to check in and out.
2836237,27736317,2015-03-10,2677377,David,Bart made check in and check out a breeze. The photo sums up the space well-- modern and with a great view. It's also in a very convenient neighborhood. I would definitely stay here again.
2836237,28097999,2015-03-17,4204689,Scott,"Bart's loft is a perfect, affordable alternative to a hotel. Well designed and perfectly located on Cap Hill. I'd stay here again in a heartbeat. "
2836237,28418311,2015-03-23,17298841,Chris,"Bart's place was awesome, perfect for the solo traveler. The view of the city is spectacular and the balcony is perfect for enjoying an morning cup of coffee. The apartment is located on a quiet street, but only 3 blocks from bustling Broadway which has some of the best restaurants and bars, notably the Bait Shop, Poppy and Joe's Bar.

Bathroom and kitchen have everything you need, including spare Q-tips! Would definitely stay again."
2836237,28529927,2015-03-25,2179966,Patrick,"We had a great stay in Bart's apartment. Located on a quiet, residential street in Capitol Hill, but walking distance (10-15 min walk) to fun bars and restaurants of Capital Hill. The apartment building was very clean and new (it almost felt like no one else was living in the building!) and Bart's studio apartment was a great size for two. It was very easy to collect/drop off the keys. If you're looking to be near Capitol Hill, but away from some of the noise, it's a great option. We also had a car, and while parking can be difficult, it really came in handy for getting around Seattle."
2836237,28933204,2015-04-01,12563134,Yuting,"In Short:
Bart's studio apartment is absolutely beautiful in person. I stayed for six days, and enjoyed it from start to finish. Everything is as described and it was such a treat to live in this space for a week. Picking up the keys and dropping it off was a breeze, and Bart and his friend communicated with me very quickly throughout the process whenever I have questions. I was very happy to have stayed here.

The apartment:
When I arrived, the apartment greeted me with lovely sunlight from its two sides of large windows and high ceiling. The view was beautiful and the balcony a real treat (though it was too cold to say outside for long). It was very clean and felt new, modern, stylish, and very comfortable. I used the kitchen almost everyday for light cooking; the knives, plates, utensils, etc. are all good stuff, and a joy to use. It is very quiet — I wrote a whole paper in the apartment, which I cannot even do in my own apartment. The bed is also very comfortable. Excepting for the first night, I left the blinds open even when I slept — it felt private enough not to have the blinds down, and I loved sleeping knowing that Seattle is twinkling outside. 

Oh, Bart has a stereo that can connect to your device via chromecast. I loved that. I was playing Pacific Northwest playlists on 8Tracks the whole time.


The Neighborhood:
Gorgeous. I am a single woman traveling for a conference at downtown Sheraton. I felt very safe walking everywhere from Bart's apartment, and really just enjoyed walking around in Capitol Hill among all the spring flower trees. A gigantic grocery store was less than five minutes away, as well as a lot of restaurants, coffee shops, bars, and vintage and new clothing stories. I walked downtown everyday, and it was some 20-25 minutes up and down the hill. It was pretty manageable: one day I even did it in heels (only one day though).  When I got lazy, I took Uber, and it was between 4 to 9 dollars depending on traffic and whether there was a price surge (I only ran into one surge when I got the Uber ride from downtown on a busy saturday evening). 

Special mention: I found Joe Bar on the last day of my stay — fantastic crêpes and coffee, and a super lovely place only less than five minutes away. Try it if you decide to stay at Bart's place."
2836237,32462848,2015-05-18,3131471,Amanda,"I had a lovely 6 week stay at Bart's studio! The views are stunning, the apartment is well decorated and comfortable, and the building is quiet and pleasant. The neighborhood is fantastic; there are great restaurants, countless coffee shops, grocery stores, gyms, etc. within easy walking distance. Bart was pleasant and easy to reach for the duration of my stay. I would highly recommend staying in this beautiful studio! P.S. Make sure you go up to the roof at least once -- the view is truly spectacular!! "
9564093,55960666,2015-12-07,67103,Willis,"The 3 2 1 Contact House was an excellent place to stay.  The bed is super comfortable. It was a quiet place to sleep.  Everything was clean.
The location is great! --close to Chinatown and downtown Seattle.  John was super helpful and had all important info ready.  I would definitely re-book here again."
9564093,57051600,2015-12-21,14369872,Siddharth,"John was an excellent host and the house is located at a very convenient location. You just need to walk a few steps to catch a bus to downtown. Link services are also available within a miles walk. 

The house was very clean and tidy and spacious enough for 2 people living. I had initially booked for 8 days and then loved it enough to rebook it for 4 more days. "
9564093,57819564,2015-12-29,49476006,Miyu,"John was a very accomodating host! The house was just like the photos, close enough to downtown. He even left us some yogurt and drinks in the fridge. The area was very quiet and the bed was comfortable to sleep in. 
We enjoyed our stay in Seattle! "
7305969,38468259,2015-07-15,4422077,Robert,"Emily was a terrific host. Super clean and very private bedroom on the bottom level of a 3 level home. I was the first airbnb visitor and the space had just been remodeled. Modern. Great, comfy bed. Great Shower. She had good input on the neighborhood. Walking distance to a ton of different stuff (I wandered and left the car behind). I will stay again!"
7305969,38940603,2015-07-19,3470710,Michael,great. the space was nice and you have your own private space and entrance downstairs. 
7305969,39356744,2015-07-22,38945414,Nick,"Fantastic place, very clean, new and modern. Very accommodating for my changing schedule for the day I was getting in, and great location in the city, with easy street parking for drivers. From there I was able to quickly walk and grab some amenities from the nearby stores. Would love to stay again."
7305969,40159490,2015-07-28,38495721,Adam And Lauren,Very clean and pleasant room in a spectacularly located location. Emily was more than hospitable with a list of general information and things to do.. I would recommend to ANYONE staying in Seattle!
7305969,40974027,2015-08-03,9154220,Mary,"The room was very nice and comfortable. The location was great - very walkable to restaurants, grocery stores, and coffee shops. Emily was great and easy to get in contact with and very accommodating. We really enjoyed our stay!"
7305969,41250525,2015-08-05,12160899,(email hidden),"Hi
   I had a great stay at this location.  Emily was a great host. She was warm and welcoming,  as well   as accommodating and responsive. The location is easily accessible by public transit and close to tourist attractions. The room itself was clean and comfortable.  I would definitely recommend it to other travelers. "
7305969,41818318,2015-08-09,38618579,Dasi,"The listing for this room was accurate, the photos give you an idea that the space is clean and modern. The room is on the basement level but has a nice large window for light and air. This would be a good space for 1-2 people looking to spend most of their time exploring Seattle. I was only in the room for a short time due to a busy schedule, but my stay was enjoyable.

Emily was friendly and offered to help in any way, but since I used to live in Seattle, I didn't need the pointers that most travelers need. Also because I was in the room so infrequently (over my 3 day stay), I only saw her at check-in and check-out, which worked just fine for me.

The neighborhood has lots of good restaurants and sights. There was ample street parking near the place so that was great.  If I ever need to visit that area again, I would re-book with Emily."
7305969,42464363,2015-08-13,21491831,Stella,"Emily kindly accommodated us arriving late in the evening. The room was lovely and modern and the area is nice and quiet. Also a good connection to Seatac, within an hour."
7305969,42581451,2015-08-14,34926108,Leslie,Very nice neighborhood. I found parking in front very easily. 
7305969,42897229,2015-08-16,8948078,Tyler,"This is a wonderful, quiet and very private space in Emily's home. She was super respectful and access to the place was easy! I felt like I was in a little hotel room, the modern bath and private room are super accommodating and very accessible to the neighborhood! Walking distance to so much!!! "
7305969,43284875,2015-08-18,15634786,Lane,"Emily is an excellent, friendly, and responsive host. The apartment is clean, contemporary, and charming. It's location within the house allows for privacy and makes it perfect for coming and going as one pleases. The Capitol Hill location makes it an easy walk to loads of local restaurants. Fabulous experience!"
7305969,43656160,2015-08-21,2141195,Jenn,"  The room and bathroom were cozy & clean. If you are wanting more privacy in your stay, this is definitely a good choice. "
7305969,44937180,2015-08-30,21642559,Jane,"This room was perfect for a person like me, who had traveled alone to Seattle for the first time. It was exactly as listed - a private room and bathroom with it's own entrance. Emily was extremely welcoming and accommodating - my flight got in early and she was willing to flex her schedule in order to get the room ready a few hours earlier than check-in time. The neighborhood was very safe and close walking distance to a lot of cool cafes and restaurants. I would definitely recommend this place."
7305969,45295030,2015-09-01,18890194,Ronald,"Emily was an awesome host. Place was clean, private & cozy. Emily even let us do some laundry while we were visiting. Capitol Hill was a great area to stay..we felt super safe the entire time"
7305969,46157950,2015-09-08,40056237,Paul,Emily is an excellent host. She is friendly and was very responsive to some special needs which we had. The room and bathroom is as advertised in the listing and was clean and contemporary. We enjoyed the neighborhood and some of the local restaurants and coffee shops which were in walking distance of the room. We rented a car at the airport and had no problem finding a parking space on the street facing the apartment. This was a very good experience.
7305969,46747176,2015-09-13,17741959,Amanda,"Really great Airbnb experience! The description was very accurate. Great location, somewhat small but very clean room and bathroom. Bed is super comfortable. Emily was very easy to get in touch with and was very accommodating. This Airbnb spot is perfect for exploring Seattle, it's central and therefore easy to get to a lot of places by foot."
7305969,48541897,2015-09-27,7674579,Steven A.,"I spent most of my trip out and about, using the room as a crash pad for the most part; as such, I didn't get to meet Emily in person.  However, the place was great - it's clean, comfortable, and looks just like the pictures. 

Really nice little house perfectly located to get to everything in the Capitol Hill neighborhood with quite easy access to the rest of the city as well (I came from the airport via Link (light rail) and bus without much problem and also walked, took the bus, and uber'ed all around from this central location very easily.)  

Setting up the my stay was quick and easy, and Emily was friendly and flexible.  Definitely recommended  if you're looking for a simple, clean, and private spot to get a good night's sleep and a shower while you explore Seattle."
7305969,49225185,2015-10-02,287266,Sarah,"Emily's room was great. Exactly as described and Emily was very responsive. Room was clean, comfortable, quiet. "

7305969,50608331,2015-10-12,16793088,Steve,"Emily's place is lovely. It is perfect for anyone who is in Seattle and wants their own privacy and space - the bottom floor is the bedroom and bathroom for guests, and has its own entrance. Emily is very nice although we didn't get a chance to see very much of her - but she did give us a great recommendation for where to stay on the next part of our holiday! The townhouse is in a great part of town, and a perfect place to have your space after getting home from checking out Seattle. "
7305969,50821929,2015-10-14,43463047,Dan,"Emily is a great host. The room is located on the first floor of a nice townhouse, very clean. The neighborhood is quiet. It's easy to get street parking right in front of the house. 

The duvet in the room was a little too thin for me for the weather in October. After I brought this up with Emily, she immediately went to find out an additional blanket and delivered it to my room. 

I left the window open in the morning with heat on in the room. Emily saw it and kindly reached out to me through phone call, to make sure I'm ok if she closed the window.  "
7305969,51183266,2015-10-18,17945929,Benjamin,"Lovely room in a wonderful house. Easy arrival, clean space. Perfect place to stay for a Seattle visit. "
7305969,52023475,2015-10-25,22176451,Andrea,"The listing was just as described - perfect for my family's needs. Emily was very accommodating and kind. We booked very last minute - and her quick response was appreciated. The room was private and comfortable and the location was perfectly situated - not too close to the hustle and bustle to feel rowdy, but just a few blocks away from Capitol HIll to have access to everything! "
7305969,53210004,2015-11-06,11489767,Amy,Emily was a great hostess and made me feel right at home with anything I needed and great recommendations. 
7305969,53866712,2015-11-13,5422380,Kent,"I had a pleasant stay at Emily's. Comfortable and very convenient to downtown Seattle. Safe, secure, quiet, very clean."
7305969,55115281,2015-11-28,46504458,Melinda,"We had a great stay at Emily's. Even thought it was quite cold outside, we were comfortable with the extra blanket she provided. There are quite a few places within walking distance including several coffee shops and my husband's favorite ""Chuck's Hop Shop"" ( a great place to try a variety of beer). We plan to stay there when we return to Seattle in the future. "
7305969,55331076,2015-11-29,19005721,Allan,Great location and place.  Easy walk to all of the great nightlife on capitol hill.  I think the room and bathroom are actually nicer than the pictures.  Emily was a great host and very responsive.
7324993,49273835,2015-10-02,4096926,Christopher,"Bryan was an amazing host and his place is great. I was in Seattle for a week for business and after a long day at work, coming back to his home with a beautiful view was the perfect way to end the day. Bryan was also very attentive, checking up on me throughout my stay, and was quick to answer any question I had. I will definitely reach out to Bryan again when I'm in Seattle. I highly  recommend. "
7324993,51174328,2015-10-18,21819232,Steve,Listing description was very accurate. Key was at coffee shop couple blocks away. Worked great
7324993,52138342,2015-10-26,5005138,Abby,"Bryan was a great host, very accommodating and responsive. His apartment was clean and centrally located. "
7324993,52448848,2015-10-29,8253334,Tom,"Bryan's apartment is great. I was in town for work and it was a great place to spend a couple quiet nights. It's a great modern building, the apartment is comfy and it comes with a wonderful view - especially from the roof! Check in and out were seamless and convenient. Bryan was totally helpful with all, including an evening text to get wireless access. I look forward to staying again for work or pleasure."
7324993,53694097,2015-11-11,5926490,Elizabeth,"While I would not describe the apartment as ""luxury"", it was adequate and the location and views from the apt and especially the roof more than compensated for any lack of luxury. We spent evenings on the roof even in November as there are several overhead heaters and a fire pit. Public transportation was great from this location, amenities were nearby. We (baby boomers) enjoyed being in the midst of an international group of millenniums who were very friendly. We felt the whole experience was great."
7324993,54376573,2015-11-19,12900294,Ronald,"Lovely view.  Great location.  Be aware that third person will sleep on a couch.  No Cable TV, but free internet.  Clean and Pleasant."
7324993,54657830,2015-11-22,11299764,Alan,Great location. Very easy to get to and a quick walk to the places that we wanted to go. The rooftop was also great with views of the city and space needle. The space is small and cozy but we'll appointed and modern looking. Definitely a great place to stay.
7324993,54899118,2015-11-25,47939560,Bobby,"This was my first time and Seattle so finding a good location to stay was important.  The apartment was safe, secure, clean, quiet and comfortable.  The view outside the living room room is wonderful, only to be outdone by the amazing rooftop garden/patio.  Location was ideal; a short walk to the Space Needle, Lake Union, Pike's Place, and numerous bars, restaurants, and coffee shops literally outside the building.  We opted not to rent a car and used uber for our ""longer"" trips (20 minute ride from Sea-Tac, five minutes to Queen Anne's).  When we did need to rent a car, there was a Budget Car Rental Location a TWO minute walk away. Communication with Bryan was seamless, simple and excellent!  Next time in Seattle, I will be staying here again!  "
7324993,55089062,2015-11-27,22869761,Bridget,"Despite it being a holiday weekend, Bryan made a point of being available for questions and assistance. The location is amazing. It's within walking distance of literally anything you'd want to see in DT Seattle. Anything else is a short taxi or bus ride. We especially liked that it was minutes to the Space Needle area. We had tickets to a play there and enjoyed the walk both to and from the venue.

The view is fantastic, just as the picture conveys. It was lovely seeing this view both in the day and at night. What a treat.

The location could feel sketchy for some people. It's located pretty close to what maybe a halfway house or something like that. There were plenty of people walking around who might be living there. We felt safe though and even interacted with other people who were friendly and appeared to live nearby. You should know there is no off-street parking and most on street parking is metered all hours of the day I believe. That was an unfortunate surprise.

As far as the apartment is concerned, it's far from ""luxury"". Our biggest challenge was with the bed. The bed is not at all comfortable. It's one of those Scandinavian designs with the slats underneath supporting a very, very thin mattress. The slats kept falling out from the railing, causing the super-thin mattress to sag. The pillows were equally bad, giving no head support. All of the furniture in this place follows this trend: uncomfortable and cheap.  

A powerful aroma not unlike cologne dominates the lobby area. In the apartment itself, two ""fragrance balls"" located at the front door fills the apartment with a strong perfume smell. If you're smell-sensitive, you may want to put these balls in a plastic bag, which we did. There is a large TV in the apartment, and an internet connection, but nothing else. We were unable to figure out how to watch anything. Although you can navigate on the TV (using the remote) to the Internet, there is no keyboard on the remote so you can't log in to your favorite service. Nor could we figure out how to stream from our computers to the big screen. We felt this lack of usability was a major tease.

As a result of the poor sleep we had the first night, and everything else described above, we decided to bag our stay and move to a luxury hotel, with a killer bed, and suite-size room, which we got super cheap because it was Thanksgiving weekend. Despite the wonderful view and perfect location, we will not be staying here again, unless the problems detailed above are resolved."
7324993,55438779,2015-12-01,14956454,Marguerite,"Loved the condo! Great location - we really enjoyed Belltown. Getting around by walking or Uber was a breeze. Bryan has a Magic Bullet in the kitchen which is a great idea. The views were wonderful! Very clean place, perfect size for two people! Great restaurants nearby. Loved it! So impressed with KeyCafe. Picking up and dropping off key was a breeze, and the cafe has great lattes! I have already highly recommended Bryan's condo to everyone! "
7324993,55770628,2015-12-05,37373579,Kolby,"The room was great and had an incredible view! It was very very clean and comfortable. The location is great within lots of restaurants and bars near by, plus downtown is only a couple minute walk. I will always try to stay here when coming to Seattle. "
7324993,56393333,2015-12-13,6136153,Kristina,Bryan's condo was even better than we expected! The photos do not do that view justice. He made it very easy to pick up the keys at our convenience and even arranged an early check-in for us. He was very responsive to our questions and very helpful throughout our stay. Will definitely stay here again next time we visit Seattle! Thank you Bryan!

Jeannette went above and beyond to make us feel welcome. It was the perfect spot for our family of five (three little ones 6,4,2) as we were in Seattle visiting friends. I found the host to be very responsive in her communication and helpful   in making sure we had what we needed. Thanks Jeannette! We hope to be back someday soon.

3883137,22464792,2014-11-07,13573742,Linda,"The apartment was large and spacious, located in a quiet residential neighborhood. There was a bus stop 5 minutes away from the house where we could take a bus straight downtown. Jeannette was a really nice and helpful host. I would definitely reccomend this place."
3883137,22662937,2014-11-11,19330919,Sara,"Jeanette was a very welcoming host. We enjoyed everything about our stay. The apartment is spacious, private, and tastefully decorated. The king bed was incredibly comfortable. We would highly recommend Jeanettes place to any Seattle visitors. "
3883137,22869632,2014-11-16,23573646,Gregg,"This was a nice basement apartment in a safe-feeling residential neighborhood.  Everything is nice, mostly new, very clean.  The apartment is nicely decorated.  Our family of 5 were very comfortable and had plenty of space.  Jeanette is a pleasant host and concerned that we had what we needed.  It was a quick over-nighter for us.  We would have enjoyed staying a little longer."
3883137,22974641,2014-11-18,12207766,Tristen,The host was very kind. This is the basement apartment of the host's home. The bed was very comfortable! 
3883137,23134164,2014-11-23,1335659,Deana,"Beautiful and comfy home near Golden Gardens. We only had time for one night in Seattle, but had a very restful sleep at Jeannette's place. She was very sweet and accommodating and we promised her we'd come back when we had more time. :)  Her scones are incredible!
"
3883137,23609369,2014-12-06,23814925,Katy,"We knew we'd have a wonderful experience as soon as we walked in. Jeannette had left delicious cookies, banana bread, juice and coffee for us. The kingsize bed and pillows were so comfortable! The apartment was very spacious and just what we needed. We could hear the family above us some, but nothing too crazy or distracting. I appreciated how quickly Jeannette responded when I had questions. She was extremely courteous and welcoming! She gave me great advice about where to go for a nearby jog... You must check out golden gardens when you stay! We would happily stay at Jeanette's again and will keep it in mind if we are ever back in Seattle."
3883137,23722281,2014-12-08,10527177,Jan,Jeannette's apartment was absolutely lovely! It was very clean and spacious as described. It is located in a quiet neighbourhood with a great view and it is just a short drive to downtown. I will definitely book this place when I go back.
3883137,23817522,2014-12-11,23793769,骜然,"Jeannette is so welcoming and nice! The whole family including the father and the two daughters are very sweet and cute. The basement apartment is very bright and spacious. And the bed is so comfortable! Furthermore, Ray (Jeannette's husband) and Jeannette help us a lot to make a traveling plan. I will definitely come back to Seattle one day. This lovely family gives us a very good impression on Seattle in spite of the rainy days. Lastly, the pictures of this apartment is totally true."
3883137,23871149,2014-12-13,23637901,Mari,Clean and comfortable space! Pretty much exactly as described. Great living situation for our party of 5. Thanks Jeannette! 
3883137,23961602,2014-12-15,1748819,Gancho,"Jeannette and her family made us feel welcome in every aspect. They are friendly and source of good information.
The place is nice and in a good location to get to downtown or other parts of the city.
Parking is easy and according to Jeannette, there is easy access to public transportation as well. "
3883137,24268885,2014-12-24,23502460,Phong,Jeannette was great and I couldn't ask for more.  The unit was good as described.  I would certainly want to come back later and highly recommended for others.
3883137,24369086,2014-12-27,8074198,Maureen,"Our host was quick to respond to questions before our visit and the young lady she had helping her was great.  The apartment was very comfortable and suited our needs very well.  I would recommend this to people I know.  Thank you, Jeannette!

3883137,24593171,2014-12-31,9911141,Urs,"We stayed at the apartement for 3 nights. 4 people and a 11 month old baby. We had lots of space and enjoyed our stay. The seperat entrance to the apartement made it very uncomplicated for us to come and go without bothering anybody. The kitchen has everything and the bathroom is great (with enormous bathtube!)
Jeannette organised our arrival perfect, and was very accomodating during our stay."
3883137,24860868,2015-01-03,24424935,Bernie,"This is the perfect spacious unit to stay in, set below a lovely family in a great neighbourhood. The fresh fruit and english muffins waiting for us was an especially nice touch. The pictures depict exactly what your going to get, but fail to show just how comfortable the beds were!  We thoroughly enjoyed our stay."
3883137,25068426,2015-01-05,21939514,Bryan,"Jeannette was very pleasant and quick to help us to the apartment.  It was very well supplied and very nicely decorated. 

I am sure we will visit again"
3883137,25200468,2015-01-09,23274450,Brian,"Spacious, comfortable, a great hq for our trip to Seattle. Everything was exactly as described and Jeannette was communicative, helpful and friendly. 
"
3883137,25283256,2015-01-11,24458938,Guido,"siamo stati da Jeannette per una prima sera, appena usciti dall'aeroporto, e già alla prima esperienza ci è sembrata una casa confortevole ed accogliente. Poi ci siamo ritornati dopo alcuni giorni e ancora una volta l'esperienza è stata positiva."
3883137,25336022,2015-01-12,8595877,Courtney,"This was a great little apartment. It wasn't too far away from downtown, and it was nice and cozy. It is a great spot if you are staying for a short or long amount of time. I Jeannette was very fast to respond, and friendly. "
3883137,25410064,2015-01-15,24458938,Guido,"Esperienza molto positiva.  Jeannette e il marito si sono dimostrati molto disponibili ad assisterci in ogni problema.  La casa era spaziosa, bene attrezzata, perfettamente adeguata allo scopo e corrispondente a quanto dichiarato nell'annuncio.  Posizionata in un quartiere residenziale di piccole villette famigliari, un po' periferico però molto tranquillo e sicuro. "
3883137,25654484,2015-01-22,23146946,Benjamin,It was wonderful! Thanks Jeannette and his wife and family! Nice ro meet you and your house was perfect! 
3883137,26023474,2015-02-01,924100,Roxy,"Jeannette's apartment was such a nice place to come home after a day of firm visits. We all slept well, and found that it was much closer to downtown than we had thought -- for a really good price. Would stay here again in a heartbeat!"
3883137,26315246,2015-02-09,2716862,Angie,"Jeannette's home was beautiful, warm and comfortable for our group of five.  The apartment has all the amenities one needs for an overnight (or longer!) stay and is in a great neighborhood.  I look forward to returning! "
3883137,26591011,2015-02-16,1800028,Jacynta,"Very spacious, and private basement suite! Suited our needs perfectly.  Great for our one night stay. Easily accessible to downtown Ballard by Cab.

3883137,27391789,2015-03-03,7829062,Laura,"My boyfriend and I had a great time in Seattle! The apartment is a very nice place to come back to after an exhausting sight seeing day! The bed is very comfortable and the big bathtub is perfect to relax! Everything was very clean and organized! It's was like described and we had everything we needed, enough towels, soap and all the kitchen supplies you need! 
The apartment is not far from the downtown area it might seem far on the map but the ride isn't bad at all! We rented a car and came around very easily! 
The host Jeannette was very helpful with everything! She answered questions quick and very nice! She also gives you advice for activities and wants you to have a great vacation! 
I would definitely stay here again :) 
Thanks! "
3883137,27786551,2015-03-11,7601398,Naomi,Jeanette's place was the perfect place to crash after a hard long day of sight seeing in Seattle! The bed was so comfortable and GIANT. The whole apartment is super spacious. Really liked the coffee supplied too. Thanks Jeanette!
3883137,27836902,2015-03-13,27247025,Mikayla,"Very cute place! It looks just like the pictures- bigger than I expected! Jeannette was great at communicating with me via email. My friends and I appreciated and enjoyed our stay. I was unaware that the space was the basement of their home, but that wasn't a problem. The only downside was in the morning, we could hear the family walking around upstairs, but it wasn't too big of a deal. "
3883137,28018177,2015-03-16,27599073,Siwan,"It is a really nice place and is exactly like the picture. And provided all the things you need!
Of course it is also very spacious. A good choice I made in this trip."

3883137,28569930,2015-03-26,28519895,Rosanna,"Great spot! Totally as described. Clean, spacious and welcoming hosts. They gave great tips about the neighborhood about where to eat and what was a affordable. We were traveling with kids and they gave us amenities to help the kids be more comfortable. The neighborhood is quite and pleasant and a quick drive to downtown and walking distance to the beach. This was our first time using Airbnb and it was great! We had a great trip and feel like we have made new friends,  Jeanette and her family were awesome and we plan to be back!"
3883137,28879426,2015-03-31,26561636,April,"We loved it! Quiet little neighborhood, great little apartment and very kind hosts. The apartment is only minutes from the city center and close to the beach, shops and dining. It was very clean and cozy and a steal compared to trying to get a hotel for 6 people. Would definitely stay again."
3883137,28997347,2015-04-02,26600891,Rene,"A private entrance into the basement, our own little space. Extra bed was great and ready to roll. Coffee was an unexpected treat! SO much better than a hotel for 5 people.
"
3883137,29401644,2015-04-07,27700495,Jocelyne,"The listing was very accurate and we had SO MUCH SPACE. The neighborhood was cute and quiet, just don't be thrown off with people parking the wrong way on the street! Would recommend this place to people who want to be a little bit out of the center of the city and enjoy more of the local life than downtown, which is 100% what we wanted. Made our trip so much better by staying here than in a hotel."
3883137,29908702,2015-04-14,9530824,Samantha,We had such a wonderful time staying in Jeannette's apartment. It was clean and had everything we needed. There was plenty of room for the five of us and it was in a great neighborhood right next to a park. My daughters were thrilled about that and the fact that Jeannette has two wonderful girls the same age! The girls all played together and it just added so much to our happy Seattle adventure! They are such a great family and we hope to come back one day! 
3883137,30384954,2015-04-21,27805654,Margaret,"A wonderful apartment with room for our entire family, including our 2 year old and infant. A short drive to many Seattle attraction attractions, and there is a large park adjacent to the apartment. We had a wonderful stay. "
3883137,30597924,2015-04-25,8885983,Julie,"Jeannette is a thoughtful host. We had a wonderful stay in her place. The neighborhood is quiet and nice. Not far away to the bus stops. If you don't have a car, it is still easy to get wherever you'd like to go!"
3883137,30789063,2015-04-27,19735245,Britny,Jeannette's place was in a quiet neighborhood and exactly what we needed for our quick weekend getaway! There was plenty of space for the 4 of us and we liked the location!
3883137,31419928,2015-05-05,24008638,Janel,"Jeannette and family were very friendly and were careful to both make us welcome and ensure our privacy. The apartment was spacious, clean and comfortable. For people with kids there is a park very close by."
3883137,31873363,2015-05-11,16061100,Bengt,"Vi hade några fantastiska dagar i Seattle and Ballard. Mycket tack vare Jeannette. Hon hjälpte oss att komma tillrätta, gav förslag på trevliga matställen och ställen att besöka. Vi fick välbehövlig hjälp både när vi bad om det och när vi inte gjorde det. Boendet var mysigt och väldigt praktiskt för oss som var fem stycken i familjen."
3883137,32481779,2015-05-18,8658972,Stephanie,"This was a wonderful location. I came to visit friends so I was away from this location more than actually there. However, extremely comfy and welcoming inside the apartment. I just wished I could have spent more time there. "
3883137,33670665,2015-05-31,30472220,Katerina,"Jeanette was a great host. Everything was very uncomplicated and communication went smooth. 
The place is in a very nice neighborhood. Very clean and super comfortable king size bed.
We stayed with 4 people and there was plenty of space, would come back any time."
3883137,34279824,2015-06-07,25663762,Judy,"We were welcomed with fresh juice, delicious coffee and chocolates for our stay. We found the neighborhood family-friendly with beautiful views and a great location. The apartment was spacious, clean, and comfortable. Jeanette, Ray, and their family were so kind and wonderful. They provided us with suggestions on places to visit. We would definitely return if we were ever staying in Seattle again. Thank you for hosting us for a fantastic vacation! "
3883137,34841968,2015-06-13,22692705,Nancy,We had a great week in Seattle!!  Jeannette made us feel welcome and at home the moment we walked in the door!  She was very helpful and gave us great tips on places to see!  Answered any questions we had.  Would recommend to anyone traveling with or without kids!!
3883137,35217001,2015-06-16,16767993,Kurt,We had a wonderful stay at Jeanette's. Perfect communication and a spacious and very comfortable house that was fully stocked. Could not ask for anything more. Would return in a heartbeat. Thanks Jeannette for making our stay in Seattle so pleasant. 
3883137,36767655,2015-07-01,27346073,Elizabeth,"We love this place. The space was good for our family of five.  The host set up the place beautifully. The kitchen was perfect for us as we ate our breakfast in the house before we left for the day. The neighborhood was in a great location & is within easy access to downtown Seattle. Overall, we had a positive experience & would recommend this unit. "
3883137,37765126,2015-07-10,10644118,Ashutosh,"Jeannette’s apartment is a pretty, clean, and spacious one in a great residential locality not very far from the downtown. It has tasteful interiors with a nice carpet, and equipped with a new washer and dryer that helped, as it was almost the mid of our 10-day road trip. The apartment has a roomy, well-equipped, and well-stocked kitchen, and a very nice study/office area beside the living room which we didn’t use much, but I can imagine it being used on a business trip. The huge bed was a plus with our two-year-old sleeping with us.

Jeannette was warm and cordial, greeted and treated us well. She even left juice and yogurt for my two year old since we were checking in late. The apartment is on the lower level of their house but we didn’t hear them a lot. I would stay at her AirBnB the next time I visit Seattle."
3883137,37844463,2015-07-11,31174438,Jenny,"Our group of six enjoyed our total of four nights stay at Jeanette's place. It's spacious, equipped with all the essentials, and in a nice neighborhood close to the University and downtown. Jeanette was very helpful in sharing information on places to eat and go!
This place is their basement floor (with separate entrance), so it is a little dark, and you do hear the footsteps upstairs but it shouldn't be too Our group of six enjoyed our total of four nights stay at Jeanette's place. It's spacious, equipped with all the essentials (plus coffee&tea and cereal bars ^^)and in a nice neighborhood close to the University and downtown. Jeanette was very helpful in sharing information on places to eat and go!
This place is their basement floor, so it is a little dark and musty, and you do hear the footsteps upstairs which might affect light sleepers. Otherwise, it's a great place to stay (great value for your money!), and we were grateful for the hospitality! "
3883137,38577574,2015-07-17,23293548,Meagan,"Great apartment! More than enough room for a family of five. Clean, everything you could possibly need! Great stay, would definitely stay again!!"
3883137,39433298,2015-07-23,36649627,Heather,Jeannette and her family were very accommodating. This was my first Air BnB experience and I will for sure be returning. Jeannette will answer any questions and is very helpful. I definitely recommend staying here!
3883137,39498699,2015-07-24,8717555,Mary,"Jeannette was friendly and prompt to reply to questions. Her home is a nice, safe neighborhood where we felt a sea breeze. The apartment is even more spacious than it looks in the photos. My party of three only stayed for one night, but it could comfortably house a family for a longer stay. The apartment is a great value. "
3883137,39628515,2015-07-25,18426315,Kenneth,"If you're familiar with the expression ""does what it says on the tin,"" that's all you have to know: the place is exactly as advertised, and all of the positive reviews are correct. Absolutely perfect accommodations and total privacy. Here are a couple of things to be aware of, which should not hinder you from jumping at a reservation if available:
1. It's in the basement
No views out windows, feeling of connectedness with outside world
2. No TV
Great internet access, a library's worth of cogent and entertaining reading. Just no tv.
3. Apparently not the only living space in the basement area
It seems there is a twin lodging on the premises: open the door to the basement and there are further entrances to the left and right.
4. You'll hear the residents and they'll hear you
Mellow vibe in the place, with dogs and kids about. Since you're immediately downstairs you hear all that. Not an issue at all, just less than perfectly private.
5. You have to do some of the cleaning yourself
Jeannette makes the perfectly reasonable request that you do your dishes before you leave, and that you put bedding and towels in the washer. This keeps here cleaning charge reasonable, and we were happy to do it.
6. Entrance is moderately weird
You have to go off to the side of the house and down a little stairway to enter, and access a key in a lockbox. Sensor lights keep it perfectly visible at night and the lockbox allows you to arrive whenever you like, so a-ok. Just don't forget to put the key back before you leave.
If you've read this far, you do your homework before making a reservation. The discerning lodger will decide to stay here and be rewarded with Jeannette's conscientiousness and kindness, as well as a super-spacious, extremely comfortable environment. Does what it says on the tin."
3883137,40905018,2015-08-03,33033325,Kelly,This basement apt was a perfect size to crash with a family of four.  We had everything we needed and were much closer to our relatives than we would have been in an expensive hotel.  
3883137,41927997,2015-08-10,8778749,Alan,The suite is bigger than what you can see in the photos. The place is clean and tidy when we arrived. Jeannette is friendly and accommodating. We will definitely consider staying here again next time we visit Seattle! Thanks Jeannette. :)
3883137,42260725,2015-08-12,33395919,Victoria,"Lovely, large apartment in the basement of a home in a quiet Seattle neighborhood, just as listed. The hosts were even thoughtful enough to provide French presses for our morning coffee. Everything, especially the kitchen and bathroom, looked very new and clean, and I would definitely recommend staying here!"
3883137,42490248,2015-08-13,32875266,Siyu,It is a very friendly and lovely family！ The house it clean and quiet. Love it so much！
3883137,42513631,2015-08-14,30446696,Jeanette,She told us very details about how to get in the house . 
3883137,42875085,2015-08-16,671481,Maria,"The space was great for our family. It could definitely use a bit of an upgrade but it was just fine. The hosts were friendly, accommodating and sweet. They live upstairs. I think guests should definitely be aware that footsteps are heard BIG time from the space you sleep in. But like BIG time. The ceiling above is paper thin. If you are not a light sleeper, then you would be ok. Bathroom was spacious and great shower, nice little kitchen space. Private entrance very nice. "
3883137,44326245,2015-08-25,39372565,Janelle,"This place is fantastic! First, Jeannette and her family were GREAT hosts. She gave us ideas of activities to do around the city and made sure we had everything we needed. We felt so welcome! Second, the space was perfect for our needs. We had 6 people stay in the house for three nights. There is plenty of room, a dining table for 6 people and everything needed for a comfortable nights sleep for 6 people. 
The house is in a nice, quiet neighborhood with easy access to Seattle. We couldn't be happier with our experience! "
3883137,45382652,2015-09-02,19567583,John Gray,"Jeanette and her family were great hosts, and even let us check in early the first day with very little notice.  We felt completely welcomed, but also as if we had our own space.

The apartment is spacious, clean, and well appointed, including the kitchen, which was pre-stocked with snacks!

The Ballard/Fremont area has a lot going on, but still feels more breathable than downtown.  The house is high on a hill with a lovely view of the water and mountains. 

We had a great time, and would love to stay here again. "
3883137,45729706,2015-09-05,22782996,Leon,"This is a great place to stay while you're checking out Seattle! The neighborhood is quiet and friendly, and it's an easy drive to just about anywhere you want to go. Jeannette and Ray are gracious and kind hosts, wanting nothing more than for your stay to be relaxing and comfortable. 

The apartment is very spacious and well kept. One of the reasons we chose Jeannette's apartment over others once I had narrowed down the choices was because it has a full kitchen and a washer/drier, both come in handy especially if you road-tripped it up. Communication was great and everything was as advertised. Thanks Jeannette and Ray!"
3883137,46500422,2015-09-11,38894507,Ruth,Jeannette was great about checking in that we were settled in. Lots of lovely little touches around to make us feel welcome and the extra bed all set up already. Clean and well designed space that is easy to find and has beautiful views. The neighborhood is not close to the city center but it is a lovely part of Seattle and the bus/taxi/drive is easy.  Would recommend to anyone.
3883137,46886029,2015-09-14,17372382,Joseph,"The unit was clean and ready for us when we arrived.  Jeanette also noted we arrived in town early and worked a way to allow us to enter the unit a bit earlier than scheduled.
The neighborhood was very neat with splendid views of Puget Sound."
3883137,47375651,2015-09-18,38845176,Jessica,"Located in a more suburban area in Ballard we were able to visit the city and the beach in the same day.  I was appreciative of the usable and good sized kitchen and dining table and we got to make an awesome breakfast before leaving.  I also loved that we were able to wash a load of laundry mid way through our road trip.  There is plenty of sleeping space for 6, books, and games available.  We could easily hear the family upstairs in the morning so we didn't get to sleep in much."
3883137,48064176,2015-09-23,30954201,Florent,"The place was spacious as we expected. Clean, nice, convenient. Jeannette is very nice and helpful. She took us to the market place and she invited us to have dinner and watch football with friends.

We recommend definitely."
3883137,48528918,2015-09-27,4924978,Lucy,The apartment is huge and very well stocked. We basically used it as a place to sleep but it would be well suited for more time spent in the apartment. The apartment doesn't get much sunlight (it's in the basement so that should be obvious) but it is well lit and the bedroom is perfect for sleeping in. The neighborhood has beautiful views of the mountains and water. We had a great stay!
3883137,48911962,2015-09-29,42951559,Kari,Jeanette was so inviting. A wonderful card and bottle of juice with spices was left for us to enjoy (sadly we didn't have time) and she checked in with me regularly. The bed was super comfy and the sheets were amazing. I would absolutely stay here again on our next trip to Seattle!  #GoHawks!
3883137,49794511,2015-10-06,42682920,Paul,All as advertised! Jeannette was very accommodating and friendly with our requests. Location is convenient to Seattle and points north. Plenty of space to spread out and relax! 
3883137,51882639,2015-10-25,12785824,Danielle,"We had a lovely time staying in this spacious and comfortable apartment with our three children. Our hosts were really lovely, friendly and welcoming, and lightning-fast at responding to any concerns or questions we had. 

The accommodation itself is within walking distance of good coffee (Holy Grounds Coffee House) and a supermarket or two. There is a playground very close by and we walked to the nearby bus stop each day to head out and explore. The bus takes 40 minutes to the middle of downtown, and about half that time to Fremont, less again to Ballard, both fantastic areas to explore.

The apartment had lots of room to relax, and it was lovely to be able to cook in the cheerful kitchen space. Our stay here was the highlight of the trip for our three kids, who quickly became friends with Jeanette's children. We were glad we chose to stay here."
3883137,53058344,2015-11-04,45178295,Mary,"This delightful, spacious apartment was just what a group of girls needed for a trip to Seattle. The apartment itself was just as listed with lots of room. Great space for families. Jeannette, our host, and her family were lovely and very friendly. They made our stay very comfortable with providing plenty of amenities. The neighborhood is very nice as well. Very convenient location, close to parks, shops, and bus line. I would most definitely recommend this spot for anyone looking to experience Seattle. "
3883137,53516300,2015-11-09,47003083,Jessica,This was our first airBnB stay.  Jeannette was a gracious host.  The apartment was delightful and spacious.  We used the kitchen a lot.  We also were traveling with twins and there was enough space for our needs.  We would stay again.  A+ experience.
3883137,53952801,2015-11-15,16256643,Nicola,"Great apartment in safe neighbourhood with everything we needed. We appreciated the coffee and snacks and all the Seattle tourism brochures which were very useful. Easy check in and check out, many thanks for a great stay. "
3883137,54752856,2015-11-23,47495555,雯雨,"It was rather a short stay in Seattle, and Jeannette's lovely house certainly made the trip warmer and more pleasant. Beds are so comfortable; The sofa bed in one of the bedroom is my favorite, with a book shelf full of books. The kitchen and bathroom are very clean, I highly recommend u cook urself a dinner and enjoy a beautiful and cozy night at house, if u are not in a rush. Thanks Jeannette for such a wonderful night. "
3883137,54985060,2015-11-27,27278654,Johnny,"Jeannette was a wonderful host and made us feel welcomed in her home. The place is awesome and we made use of her fireplace even though there was central heating throughout the space. The kitchen is well stocked with condiments in the fridge, she left granola bars on the counter, and brought coffee which was a nice touch. The beds, pillows, and comforters were soft and very inviting, it felt like you were sleeping at home. She left plenty of towels to our disposal which other hosts hardly ever do as long as you help with the laundry at the end of your stay. 
There a lot of character to this place and you need to stay here for yourself to experience that, safe travels."
3883137,55837132,2015-12-06,47003083,Jessica,This apartment has been perfect both times we've stayed.  It made our move to Seattle so much easier.  It was great for our newborn twins.  The kitchen is wonderful and Jeannette is an impeccable host/owner.
3883137,57085544,2015-12-21,51256869,Mansour,I really liked the house it's clean and convenient you should rent this house in Seattle 
3883137,57630407,2015-12-28,8074198,Maureen,"Our stay at Jeanette's apartment was wonderful.  The location was perfect for us, with our grown children coming from all different locations.  The space is clean and comfortable and close to many things.  I definitely recommend this space."
3883137,57910607,2015-12-30,46187133,Anthea,"My family was very comfortable in this SPACIOUS ground level apartment. We had three adults and 3 kids the first night and 2 adults and 4 kids the next and everyone had plenty of room to spread out. The girls absolutely loved the soaking tub, the king bed was more comfy than my bed at home, and everything was spotlessly clean."
3883137,58186437,2016-01-01,49666657,Tiffanie,"Jeannette was very helpful and accommodating to my crazy plans that kept changing. She worked with me and was kind. The place looked just like it did in the pictures. It was very clean, which is super important to me. She even left some coffee and treats for us. I would definitely go back here and stay! :)"
3883137,58700447,2016-01-03,18288738,Sara,"I feel so very lucky to have found Jeannette on AirBnB. She was welcoming and gracious, and replied to all questions promptly and thoroughly. When we impulsively decided to stay for a second night she was able to make it work smoothly on the fly. 

The suite was spacious, clean, and very well appointed. We were cozy and snug in front of the fireplace and had a great time taking advantage of the kitchen and large tub.

This was a lovely first experience with AirBnB and Jeannette's exceptional suite. "
2856806,13158923,2014-05-20,2080791,Sonia,We had a wonderful experience at Nat's property. We loved the location and stunning views. This is definitely a place I would rent again. Highly recommend! 
2856806,13625691,2014-06-01,14704946,Dominique,We had a lovely stay at Nat's place. It is a wonderful bright house with a nice view and Nat was very easy to communicate with and he replied fast. He made sure everything was ok for us. We stayed with 4 people - the bedroom upstairs has a great view and balcony. Good selection of nice music.
2856806,21168830,2014-10-12,18060917,Brian,"This is an incredible space! Perfectly placed in Columbia City...just minutes from a quaint little downtown area and very quick light rail ride to the heart of Seattle. The rail also stops in the stadium district, so it is a great place to stay of you are looking to take in a Mariners or Seahawks game. The house is perfectly appointed and very modern. 

Nat rocked. He was in immediate communication and made sure we had everything we needed. I highly recommend Nat's place to anyone looking for a great place to stay right on the outskirts of the awesome city of Seattle. The views are incredible. "
8508223,50590079,2015-10-12,27089128,Andreas,"Well, what else can I say exept that Andy is the best host I have had so far. Check in was relatively flexible according to our sightseeing plans and weather. The house was great! - everything new, clean, very nice furnished and on the table there were several good things like a Seattle guide waiting for us. 
As we arrived Andy explained everything important to us about the house so we could talk about the interresting topics like places to go out in Seattle - we enjoyed the night! The perfect place to have a nice breakfast in Seattle was Andys reccomendation. 

So all in all: Great weekend in Seattle! And a very big Thanks to Andy!

Cheers
Andreas"
1141226,11190498,2014-03-24,12391241,Rob,The apartment has an ideal location for people looking to stay downtown. It was very clean and quite spacious. No problems with the staff. Rental cost was reasonable. Highly recommend it.
1141226,12219830,2014-04-26,5099298,Donna,"The whole experience from booking the apartment, checking in and our departure was very positive. Despite a late arrival, the keys were made available to us and the apartment was very clean and very comfortable.  It was also in a great location, everything was close by. We would definitely recommend this apartment. 
Christine and Johnny were great hosts. "
1141226,13569218,2014-05-31,13905783,Sean,"Our stay at St. John's was really great. The building is so cute and the apartment is very nice. The location is fantastic with lots of great shops and restaurants nearby, and if you like nightlife it's also just a short walk away. I would definitely stay there again. "
1141226,17062381,2014-08-06,18022218,Tra,"Great apartment in a convenient location! The apartment is spotless and has everything that we needed. 

Christine checked in during our stay but left us to our own. She made sure to be available for anything that we needed. 

This was our first Airbnb experience and because of it we will certainly use the service again.

Thanks again, Christine!
"
1141226,18153725,2014-08-22,20176035,John,Great location and great room.  I highly recommend!
1141226,21864846,2014-10-25,1427721,Edward,"This room was a last minute add on after my daughter's boyfriend decided to come along. They would not allow him to stay on the couch in the other room that was for 4 people (with him we were 5), so this was really large for just 2 people but well-equipped like the other one we rented.  Overall, these are very comfortable and better suited for sitting around and reading in; don't really need anything so large when you are staying in this area of town where the object is to be out eating and partying. "
1141226,26915688,2015-02-22,715962,Caroline,"The space was lovely, as was Christine. The location is perfect, very central in Seattle, and near to shops and restaurants for walking-distance activities. Thanks for having us!"
1141226,28110619,2015-03-17,6405463,Bradford,"Clean, comfy, convenient. We booked last minute, and they made it work without a hitch. I know the neighborhood well and couldn't have been in a better location. Easy walk to Denny/Olive bars if wanting to get out of crazier nightlife in surrounding vicinity for a night. Would definitely stay again!"
1141226,28222842,2015-03-20,25014651,Paul,"We travelled to Seattle for a conference, however, wanted to see some of the city (website hidden) John's Apartments was ideal for this. Christine was super helpful and efficient and her communication was really timely and thorough. The location was perfect and we walked almost everywhere which was fun to do.

We are keen to return to explore more of the city and will definitely look to stay with Christine again."
1141226,28527173,2015-03-25,27744639,Bo-Hsen,"The location was perfect for what I was looking for. The place was cozy to return to after exploring the city. Also, Christine and Johnny were very friendly and accommodating. They were also swift with responding to any questions I had. The sofa bed was relatively comfy for a sofa queen bed. The area may feel noisy on the outside the building at times, but the place was soundproof as long as the windows are closed.
Also, the manual was very useful to find spontaneous places nearby to eat or drink. It leaves useful information to transportation systems."
1141226,33127073,2015-05-25,5397311,Natalie,"This apartment was great - clean, spacious and located in a cute neighborhood with all sorts of fantastic restaurants & bars. Would highly recommend it! "
1141226,33724627,2015-05-31,9500256,Leslie,"My husband and I stayed here while I had some job interviews downtown. The location was perfect- super close to downtown- took us 5-10 min max to get to my appointments. The apartment itself is exactly as advertised- not super trendy but wonderfully clean and spacious and easy to come and go. The bathrooms seem like they have had a recent makeover too. We paid an extra $15 per day for parking right in the back of the building, which we loved. Christine and the apartment super, Johnny, were both very friendly and welcoming."
1141226,34634072,2015-06-10,22169086,Mandy,"We came here for a conference and loved the apartment. Location was great, walking distance to downtown. Three of us stayed and it comfortably fit us all. The pull out couch was the best I've ever slept on! Communication was easy, and we were even able to check in a few hours earlier than the 2pm check in time because the room was clean and ready for us! And storing bags after check out was simple. All in all, great apartment and experience. Thanks Christine!"
1141226,37299881,2015-07-06,13487236,Spencer,"Nice place in a great location, with a really excellent shower."
1141226,38261179,2015-07-14,491029,Jennifer,"Great apartment, clean and cute with a nicely updated bath. The location was awesome, easy walk to waterfront and lots of great bars, cafes and restaurants nearby - also right across from a grocery store which was awesome.  We used their parking lot for the 15/day fee which was worth it for the convenience.  The sofa bed was relatively comfy - probably better suited for a max two night stay but the bed was great. The only thing to note is that there is a rooftop sports bar across the street which can get pretty loud on weekends - like shrill screaming until 2am loud. Bring earplugs just in case if you stay on the couch, but not really an issue on weeknights."
1141226,41731495,2015-08-09,30107841,Ryan,The place was clean and had everything we needed. Lots of good food in the general area. Would recommend to anyone.
1141226,44106443,2015-08-24,32604858,Richard,We arrived after hours and there was a welcome package waiting in the bar for us. The location is perfect. The room was great with everything you need. Can be noisy at night on weekends. 
1141226,47256248,2015-09-17,10937587,Christopher,"308 St Johns apartment was absolutely great.
Christine showed us into the beautiful apartment that had everything you could need to make it feel at home. The bed was amazing! Best sleep ever! Full kitchen and great lounge area too.
Outside, the back decking area was great as extra space to hangout and have a cocktail, and catch some sun.
Heaps of coffee places, plenty of bars and food right down stairs up and down the street.
We loved Bills off Broadway which had great food and service.
Hairdresser downstairs was very handy!
We even walked down to pike market (down hill!)
I would definitely stay here again when visiting seattle.
Thanks Christine!"
1141226,47698013,2015-09-21,38974677,Momoko,"This was my first time using Airbnb and I couldn't have hoped for a better place to have stayed. The apartment was very comfortable and well stocked with toiletries, kitchen utensils, and extra bedding. The location was also great and the room came with a binder that had great info on nearby restaurants and stores. I'll definitely try to stay here again the next time I'm in Seattle. "
1557314,7078403,2013-09-05,1553890,Gillian,"My boyfriend and son stayed a week with Marilyn and it couldn't have gone better.  She was prompt and informative with the lead up emails, extremely thoughtful and kind every step of the way, responsive any time they had a question.  In other words she went way above and beyond what was required - including making brownies to make my teenage son feel at home.  
The apartment, according to their reports was clean and very pleasantly decorated.  
All in all they reported that they truly enjoyed their stay and I am truly grateful for all her efforts to make things go well.  We highly recommend staying here.
"
1557314,14368874,2014-06-17,16262872,Cynthia,"My husband and I and our 2 dogs were visiting our daughter who is doing grad studies in Seattle.  We had a wonderful experience with Marilyn.  She met us at the front of the house and had a dog bowl and mat for the dogs.  The yard and patio area are absolutely delightful; but due to the typical rainy weather of Seattle, we were unable to really enjoy it.  Not a problem, though, as we took walks around the wonderful neighborhood.  The property is an attached studio, beautifully furnished with memorabilia of their travels and family.  It is cozy and I could live there full-time!  It had a separate entrance so was very private.  I loved that Marilyn provided us with coffee supplies, fresh cherries, berries, granola and scones and stocked the refrigerator with milk and yoghurt.  It was perfect for snacking in between visits with our daughter and scoping out the city."
1557314,39167963,2015-07-21,33832022,Pj,"I would recommend using this host. She greeted us with homemade scones, Fresh coffee, and fresh local berries. The view from her house of the river and olympic mountains was outstanding. She was helpful in recommendations of where to eat and what to see. (Bastille restaurant was totally awesome food). Her house was inviting and pleasant to stay in. While we did not cook anything, she had everything we needed if we wanted to. We would stay here again when returning to this area for a visit"
1557314,43840127,2015-08-22,38611933,Min,"Marilyn welcome us in the front door even very late and make sure we know everything, the place is so big and comfortable, she also prepare coffee and yogurt and juice and water also scone for us, love the place a lot, thank you so much dear Marilyn. "
3889299,45186270,2015-08-31,42135802,Prashant Rao,Andrew's house is a great place to stay. The house is clean and well maintained. There are bikes available for any time use. The environment in the house is great. With people from variety of technical backgrounds one will always find it fascinating to hear views from different perspectives. I would definitely consider staying here again.
3889299,45737360,2015-09-05,33292928,Colin,"cor36 was a very welcoming environment that fostered creative discussion and interaction with like-minded people. I appreciated the communal setting that allowed for an intermingling of different backgrounds and peoples. The place was neat and organized, and in a great location.  I definitely plan on coming back the next time I need a place to stay in Seattle.  "
443580,1433950,2012-06-07,2261181,David,"Monika's a nice and friendly host and is always willing to help! Her place is peaceful and quiet, pretty near to the city as well. "
443580,1440786,2012-06-08,2559183,Diana,"I didn't get to meet Monika, as we checked in late. That said our overall experience was great. She made checking in easy for us, even though we reserved last minute. The space was nice and artfully done. There was a shared kitchen, bathroom and laundry. Everything was clean and ready for us. With the other airbnb-ers there it almost felt more like a hostel experience, which was fun. Everyone was very nice and welcoming. There's no question that this was a great deal! "
443580,1456647,2012-06-11,1852833,Helen,"My stay at Monika's was absolutely lovely, and I highly recommend to anyone travelling to Seattle to stay here!
Monika is a super sweet host who made sure we were very well taken care of, and gave us lots of information on how to travel around the city.
The accomodations were great, the comfiest bed I've ever had with AirBnB (especially considering last time I slept on a communal floor), the room was incredibly clean and the amenities were too - claw foot tub, anyone?
A very quick and easy bus ride away from city, there's no reason why not to book this place :)"
443580,1491834,2012-06-16,1529297,Hollie,This place is pretty great. The location is really good and the bed was really comfortable. There were other people staying there too and we became good friends. So if you want to mingle with other airbnbers then this is a good place. The host wasn't really there much because she lives upstairs but she was responsive with text messages if you need any help and she left lots of instructions and tips to make your stay easier. The buses were sometimes few and far between but that is my ONLY complaint. We probably just had bad timing though. I would recommend staying here!
443580,1500319,2012-06-17,798558,Kristen,"Monika's place was just as advertised.  We never actually met, as I came in late from a Mariners game, but she was very prompt in communicating with me and I enjoyed the house.  The other guests in the house were very friendly.  Also, if you are staying on the weekend, there is a lot of parking that does NOT have a 2 hour limit, which is excellent!"
443580,1578726,2012-06-27,2731382,Philip,"Monica's little cabin was clean, quiet and private, and the linens provided were clean and comfortable (so was the bathroom). The area was mostly residential which was great for anyone who was looking to be just outside the city buzz, but it was close enough to Capital Hill's busier areas that you can have the best of both worlds(you're about a 10-15 minute walk away). As for Monica, she really knows how to handle things professionally, making the whole experience an easy one. If you're looking for an inexpensive private lodging in Seattle, I recommend her cabin. "
443580,1598164,2012-06-30,2715718,Brandon,"This was my first time booking through airbnb.com and I could not be happier with the outcome!! Monika's cabin was the perfect fit for me and my traveling companion. The neigborhood is quiet, conveniently located close to pubic transit and walking distance to Capitol Hill which is a big plus for me. The property itself is charming with fruit trees, flowers and a cute little garden. The cabin I stayed in was a wonderful place to relax. I found myself in the cabin a lot more often than I expected because it was so clean and comfortable. The main house is also very nice. It was great being able to have such a nice kitchen to use. It saved of food expenses for sure. Having a washer and dryer available to use was also very convenient. Monika is just a sweetheart, very welcoming and kind. Every time I saw her she had a smile on her face. This property has a lot more to offer than just a place to rest your head."
443580,1618532,2012-07-02,2789881,Karl & Ty,"My girlfriend and I were in a bind and had to unexpectedly stay an extra night in Seattle. We contacted Monika late in the afternoon to stay the night, Monika immediately responded and made all the arrangements, even with the very late notice we had given.

The one room cabin/barn house, was private, clean and quirky. We were given keys to the main house to access the kitchen and bathroom which was also tidy and clean. We loved our stay here and found Monika very easy to communicate with.  Just as an FYI there is a cat living in the main house, my girlfriend is allergic to cats but didn't have any problems as the house was kept clean and fur free. 

In terms of location, the place it located just a 15 minute walk to Capitol Hill, which has loads of great restaurants, bars and shops. On weekends the street parking is free, I believe that there is a 2 hour parking limit M-F. 

Thanks Monika for a great stay. "
443580,1623413,2012-07-03,2406241,Kesia,"Monika was really nice but the place needs to advertised as it really is: a tuff shed turned into a bed space, not a cabin. The way the description is written makes it sound much nicer than it is! Also I should mention that the sheets were not clean---several hair clumps and smeared yuck on them were not conducive to a clean feeling---and the bed is a futon (also not mentioned in the ad). Finally, the ad said ""Sweet Capitol Hill Cabin"" and it was a long long walk (more like a drive) to Capital Hill so I do not think it is fair to advertise as part of this location, especially for someone that is not familiar with Seattle. "
443580,1649112,2012-07-07,1905387,Jamie,"First off I must agree with the previous tenant, it's a shed (next to an aluminum shed) not a cabin. The sheets didn't smell or feel clean either, I didn't find any clumps of anything it just didn't feel clean. The ""communal gardens"" are just a few plants in a very unkept yard, with lumps of dirt every where. In the yard you'll find an old metal fire stove with lots of cigarette butts, and a porch littered with junk. In this case the pictures look better than what is actually there. Capital Hill is not very close and if you need something be prepared especially at night there are no close convenience stores. The one thing that made it most intolerable for me was that the wifi almost never worked every morning was spent at Starbucks, luckily I had brought a couple of movies with me. There is one very small window, I'm not sure what the summers are like, but there is no AC so you may bake. This was my first Airbnb experience, it didn't meet my expectations, I would probably not recommend nor stay here again in the near future.
Here's the upside, Monika is very friendly and approachable, the neighborhood is very quiet. The bus stop for those without cars is a block away. Reading Monikas bio she appears to be very entrepreneurial I think with time she can work out the bugs and make this a very ""sweet"" stay."
443580,1719224,2012-07-16,2493606,Alison,"This was my first time using Airbnb and I can't imagine having had a better experience! Monica was extremely organized and kept me up to date with my reservation details as my travel date approached. As for the cabin, it was absolutely lovely. Truly, the photos of the cabin and the house do not do them justice. The sheets were clean and soft, and Monica very thoughtfully made up the bed with some lighter coverlets that were more appropriate for the July temperatures. Even though it was a hot weekend, the cabin cooled off nicely in the evening and sleeping temperatures were comfortable even without needing the fan that Monica provided for us. Yes, the cabin is forged from the structure of a garden shed, but the finish of the interior with clean laminate flooring and the window over the bed made it an absolutely cozy, private little space. The hanging rack and dresser made it easy to settle into. Although a previous commenter was not impressed with the yard, I would definitely not say that it's junky, just eclectic. The bathroom was very clean (and nicer than some hotels, I'd say), and even with a few others in the house, I never had to wait for it. For the cost, the location was superb! My travel companion and I brought our own bikes and it was 5 minutes or less to morning coffee at Stumptown on 12th, and 10 to the shops and fun in Capitol Hill. Although we spent most of the day exploring all corners of the city, it was so incredibly nice to know that we could home back in on Capitol Hill, have a nightcap at Linda's or Sun Liquor, and then be home to our cozy cabin in a jiffy. I can't comment on the location from a transit perspective as I did not have to rely on public transportation. While some might prefer more centrality, I personally prefer to escape the noise of the city and this neighbourhood felt quiet and safe, yet was well positioned to get to most districts of interest. I will definitely be back the next time I'm in Seattle!
P.S. The kitchen was also spotless and a joy to use. 
P.P.S. The wi-fi worked fine for us. No, you could probably not stream a video from it, but accessing the web and Google Maps for itinerary prep each day was no problem at all."
443580,1736661,2012-07-17,2910701,Cherry,I just stayed one night at Seattle and it was my first time to use Airbnb to book places to stay. The location is convenient and easy access to downtown Seattle. I felt safe even though I stayed at the cabin. I didn't meet Monika but she was helpful and nice. Overall experience of my stay was good. :)
443580,1790070,2012-07-24,68118,Erica,"Didn't actually meet Monika but she was very efficient in getting in touch when I needed anything. The cabin is actually a nice little shed in the front yard. Lots of people coming and going as the whole house seems to be air bnb. Very close to Capitol Hill, a ten minute walk to the bars etc there. Would visit again. 

"
443580,1822629,2012-07-28,2927233,Peter,"Very nice place, as we expected, no luxury just simple room for very reasonable price. The only thing I would work on if I were an owner is a  cleanliness of bathroom.  For me, personally no big drama, for my girlfriend.... a little bit an issue."
443580,1855161,2012-07-31,2511042,Matthew,"I was concerned by the price at first, but it was perfect.  Not a luxury accomodation, it's exactly only what you need.  A nice bed, clean detached room from the house, hanging space, mirror, and a bedside lamp.  At this price, you can't find anything remotely comparable in Seattle.  

I liked it so much I booked another stay already."
443580,1900869,2012-08-06,2700240,Laia,"We stayed in the cabin for six nights and we were very happy with it, we didn't met Monika and although there were many people staying in the house everything was fine, the cabin was locked and we got to use the shared bathroom and kitchen with the other guests. since it was very hot in Seattle last week it was very nice to be able to hang out in the garden on evenings. I also loved the location, very close to Capitoll Hill were the bars and shops are and just a 10min ride by bus from downtown (some days we'd walk). Would I recommend it? Of course!"
443580,1934554,2012-08-09,3017410,Hong,"I did not meet monika when I visit her house, but I received sufficient and considerate information from her. The rooms is separated considerable and the guests has lots of privacy. The yard in the front of the house is a good place for have breakfast.  "
443580,2047664,2012-08-20,3231376,David,"The accommodations were great!  Simple, convenient, and comfortable - just what I was looking for.  It's really more like a detached room right next to the house.  It's very clean.  The wifi worked well, there's a Starbucks very close by with free wifi, and the bus routes to downtown are across the street.  There was a chest of drawers, a night light, couple of side tables, place to hang clothes, and an electric fan and heater.  There is one window behind the bed which let in enough light."
443580,2206754,2012-09-05,2918945,Greg,"Monika's space was clean, orderly, private and simple. Very conveniently situated to the downtown core on a bus route and about an 8 block walk to Trader Joes for grocery shopping. It was absolutely perfect for my requirements.

Monika was clear with her communication via email and welcoming towards this first time airbnb user. "
443580,2282655,2012-09-14,315019,Katie,"The cabin at the Cherry Hill House is a great alternative accommodation. Very affordable, clean, and safe. Monika was easy to correspond with and helpful during our stay. The house has many renters, making it feel a bit like a European-style hostel. I would stay there again! "
443580,2362655,2012-09-21,3295066,Joji,"I stayed at the cabin for 10 days, which was actually quite a long stay. I came from the Greyhound terminal, from which the place is easily accessible by bus. I didn't get to meet Monika for the first few days, but she really made sure I settled in well (by email and SMS). The place was perfectly arranged!

The cabin has plenty of room to put all your stuff in. Ventilation can be a problem, but good thing the room's equipped with a fan. Since I was staying for quite long I had to provide my own plastic lining for the trash bin. The bathroom was clean and cozy. You can place your toiletries on the shelf in front of the shower, which was awesome so there's no need to bring them in each time.

Some tips: (1) Beware of the yellow cat at night, not because they're fierce or whatever but because you might trip on them in the dark (in the main house). The white cat is very friendly and followed me around, but has a tendency to want to go inside the cabin. (2) Remember to pay $2 for laundry - there's a laundry jar next to the washing machine! (3) The lights in the main house are controlled by a remote control which is on the table (I didn't know this at first so I worked in a dark kitchen for the first few days!) (4) Check under the bed for dust especially if you're allergic - there might be a few dustballs missed out during cleaning.

All in all, it was an awesome stay. Thanks Monika!"
443580,2412431,2012-09-25,3495782,Dubravka,"Didn't meet Monika, but she was great in terms of responding to emails/messages right away. The place was just fine for what you pay for, nothing fancy but very welcoming, clean and cheap. It's basically just like staying at a hostel, except it's house of beds/rooms and outside cabin. Everyone shares the same bathroom & kitchen and eveyone respects house rules. I wouldn't recommend to anyone that isn't down for hostel living. Very close to downtown and within minutes from bars and restaurants. Parking is available across the street, but there is a 2-hour limit from 8-6 except on Sundays. We were out and about pretty much those hours and had no issues with parking."
443580,2453677,2012-09-30,3078976,Charissa,"Monika is truly a beautiful, kind, giving soul.  Her little cabin reflects her love for travel and travelers. I only regret that I didn't stay longer.  The cabin was clean and quiet.  It made a perfect getaway.  I had full access to the kitchen and bathroom in the main house which was very convenient.  I was invited to use the wash and dryer and pick things from the garden.  I will definitely be back!"
443580,2471790,2012-10-01,3464957,Lindsey,"This was my second time staying at the Cherry Hill House and I enjoyed it nearly as much as the first time. The Sweet Cabin is adorable, private, secure, and comfortable. The only draw back is that the bed is a mildly uncomfortable futon. Monika is insanely well organized and runs the house like a professional. Every room in the house is spotless and clear of clutter but comfortable. The location of the house is perfect for walking or taking the bus anywhere you feel like wandering to. 
Thanks again Monika, our stay was spectacular."
443580,2492406,2012-10-02,3685328,Walt,"I took a spontaneous solo trip to Seattle and  had a great stay at Monika's cabin.  It was clean, cozy, and private.  There were 4 other guests sharing the common area but everybody was super nice and friendly!  I borrowed one of her bikes to check out the area and she was great about giving me suggestions and directions.  Monika takes a hands-off approach at the house but she's easy to reach by phone or email.  I would definitely stay with Monika again.  "
443580,2501101,2012-10-03,2919151,James,This was fantastic value for money. The location provides good accessibility to downtown and the atmosphere is trust-based and collegial. Mine was a quick stay but a real pleasure. Many thanks to Monika!
443580,2517502,2012-10-05,3444788,Wassim,"I stayed in the cabin for two nights and it was a very good experience. The cabin is nice and simple and very clean and has enough room to move around (the futon is a bit tired though but for a couple of nights it does the job).
I did not meet Monika during my short stay but I met the other airbnb guests in the house. Monika's instructions were very clear so I had no problems getting to the place and having my way around there.
The kitchen and bathroom are both very clean as well (which for me is very important).
The place is very well situated (just a few bus stops from downtown - 10 minutes).
I would definitely recommend this place. 
"
443580,2576186,2012-10-10,3719771,Melissa,I had an easy time locating the house.  It was really close to the bus stop.  It was a comfortable stay and so close to where I needed to go the next morning.  I really enjoyed my stay. 
443580,2594863,2012-10-13,2496036,Marie,"We stayed at Monika's place for two nights. Rates are cheap, the cabin was quiet and clean and even though we didn't see Monika she was really helpfull and answered our emails quickly. The only problems was that for two people, the bed wasn't very confortable (I had a backache so perhaps it didn't help), and the house is kind of crowded - no living room and really small kitchen. The cabin can be a little cold too, the heater is really small. "
443580,2711328,2012-10-24,13139,Mike,"Great cabin! You have the ambiance of the countryside in the heart of urbana. The gardens will greatly enhance your stay,with a patio in progress for the front yard. Monika's style is reflective throughout the premises. Great decor for a homelike hostel w iron,wood throughout. Excellent organization regarding house expectations, Seattle transport options. Location is excellent and within several blocks have ethnic restaurants(Ethiopian, Hatian) Close to Seattle Univer. I lived in Seattle and in the early 90's never would have envisioned the positive transformation Minor neighborhood has undergone. Did not meet Monika but had excellent communication w her.   Awesome front yard for barbeques and socilizing!"
443580,2738561,2012-10-28,2881124,Quan,"nice, clean, quite.beautiful neighbourhood.very convenient to downtown. a little bit cold on my first night stay, but realized in the morning that I didn't fully closed the window behind the curtain. Also the owner gave me more blanket later and the temperature hasn't been a problem."
443580,2801570,2012-11-04,232416,Cheryl,"The idea behind this cabin is really great  however the bed is a futon and really hard, didn't work well for 40 something year olds.  Woke up stiff and sore both mornings. It also had ants in one corner.  The purpose of choosing this location was to save money on accomodations so we could enjoy more of Seattle, we accomplished this but learned a lesson that comfort is worth some extra pennies.

I don't really have anything to say about the people who run this as I never saw them.  Our only contact was with another person renting a room in the house."
443580,2837031,2012-11-07,3760067,Denice,"Monika  was very flexible to let me stay for just one night on such short notice, which was very convenient.  The house is well managed and tidy, the location great for getting around the city.  I will say it took a long time for the tiny heater to get the cabin warm enough.  The bed was fine for just me, but for a couple you would be rolling into the middle.  I met her, she is warm and friendly and she commented that she would be getting a new bed."
443580,2893530,2012-11-15,13139,Mike,"Great stay again! New heater was on and the cabin was toasty when I arrived-thanks to Monika. If you stay here during the rainy months, it will be warm. The cabin is really unique and the setting helps create an rural ambiance in surrounding urban settings. I am a large man and found that the cabin is quite adequate for me. The wifi is excellent and inside the house-always accessible w keys is clean and well organized. Sweet Cabin is perfect respite after a busy day is Seattle."
443580,2895931,2012-11-16,1315556,Jamie,"You get what you pay for! Being that my stay here was only $35, I wasn't expecing much. The cabin is very bare minimum but was extremely cold and had a funky smell. There is a small heater in the room, but it took a long time to warm up and never really got the room heated. 

The sheets were clean but there was a strange BO smell in the pillows, so I ended up  using my sweatshirt. I am very low maintenance, so overall the experience was OK, but it would have been nice to at least have a warm room and a smell free bed. 
I probably would not stay here again, and just shell out some extra bucks to have a comfortable place."
443580,2994243,2012-11-29,4254704,Simon,Great place to stay in the heart of Seattle. Everything was set up nicely and the people were enjoyable to spend an evening with. 
443580,3032735,2012-12-05,4140862,Billie,"For the price this would probably be an adequate place to stay in the Summer, though would not recommend for the colder months. The location is great with a bus to the city just down the road, but the cabin itself is unbelievably cold and only supplied with a tiny hardly-functioning heater. There were 7 people staying whilst we were there, all sharing a single bathroom and kitchen - and the kitchen only had one chair so there wasn't really anywhere warm to chill out when it was raining outside unless you sat on the kitchen floor... though I only met Monika once she was friendly and left detailed instructions on how to get to the location etc. Overall, probably too many tenants for it to be a comfortable stay and was comparable to staying at a hostel without many amenities."
443580,3038626,2012-12-06,326200,Kristina-Talisa,"We unknowingly arrived a few hours before check in time but were welcomed nonetheless. The only problem with the room was that it was extremely cold. There was a small heater in the room (which with much appreciation was turned on to warm the room while we were out), but it seemed to have been broken. With the blankets it was warm enough for the two of us overnight, though getting up in the morning was difficult! Beyond that little mistake, great place."
443580,3059770,2012-12-11,1386709,Tudor,"Great location on a quiet street, within easy walking distance of downtown and other areas, or just be lazy and take the bus stop a block away.
Monika wasn't around when I was there, but she provided detailed information and useful tips and links beforehand.
An excellent price for a friendly, shared house (although I went for the separate cabin in the garden)"
443580,3316295,2013-01-09,3253348,Joël,"Super, la situation excellente, le quartier sympa, facile d'accès au Downtown de Seattle, Monika très sympathique et marrante, la cabine et la maison très agréable, lieu propre et la colcatrice très sympa aussi. J'ai passé un très bon séjour. Doc sur seattle à disposition, explication très claire quant au fonctionnement de la maison. J'y retournerai."
443580,3330639,2013-01-12,2791708,Melissa,"We had a nice stay at Cherry Tree house. The cabin is as described - the heater isn't great for the winter months but the room soon warmed up in the evenings. As mentioned in previous posts the property is similiar to a hostel in that there are a number of people sharing the one bathroom, so at times this was a bit tricky but overall not a huge problem for us given we only stayed for 3 nights. The location is fantastic the 3 and 4 buses take you right into downtown in no time at all and even to the Space Needle if this is on your list of places to visit in Seattle."
443580,4754022,2013-05-23,3700874,Claudia,"The property is charming and funky and seems like a very good deal for the convenience of the area.  It was a little cold when we were in Seattle and a slight inconvenience to have to go outside of the cabin, walk outside into the main house to use the bathroom there.  The people who live/stay in the main house were very friendly and welcoming.  Overall it was a very pleasant, easygoing experience."
443580,5123529,2013-06-13,660206,Brendan,"Loved the set up, a great reprieve from the road. Didn't get to meet Monika but Erinn was very nice and helpful"
443580,5132362,2013-06-14,2860175,Matt,"We had a fantastic stay at the cabin, and a fun time exploring the local area.  The cabin was very clean and charming.  The location was great and very walkable.  This is a great option if you want a clean, comfortable room, with a great location and are on a budget.  "
443580,5460537,2013-07-01,19833,Monica,"my son was the guest, and so I'm reporting his story.  the cabin was great, private, quiet, clean.  convenient to public transportation."
443580,5520479,2013-07-03,1603083,Russell,I needed a place in a pinch and Monika's space was ideal! It's the perfect no fuss room for a lone traveler.
443580,5607781,2013-07-08,6685366,Briana,Great location! We rode our bikes all around Seattle and didn't feel the need for a car at all. The only downside was there were quite a few people staying at the house and the bathroom seemed to be continually occupied especially late at night and in the morning.
443580,5664046,2013-07-10,6968663,Marissa,"We stayed in the cabin in July and had everything we needed to be comfortable. The cabin and bed were big enough for the two of us and sharing the bathroom with other house mates wasn't a problem. We never saw Monica, but she left detailed instructions about the house and gave us the opportunity to use the kitchen, dishes and fridge space. The house was right across the street from the bus stop and close enough to a Trader Joes to walk to. This was a great place for our first airbnb visit!"
443580,5709137,2013-07-13,916527,Alexandre,"Great and cousy little cabin, pefect for a one night stay"
443580,6008335,2013-07-26,285293,Cory,"I enjoyed my stay at Monika's Cabin in Cherry Hill.  She made check-in very easy, and provided a lot of great instructions for getting there.  The bed in the cabin was comfortable, and I appreciated the good water pressure and very hot water in the shower.  I would definitely stay here again, and can recommend it to anyone traveling to Seattle on a budget.

This is a great place to stay if you are looking for a value, but understand that there are tradeoffs that come with the low nightly rate.  There is only one bathroom in the main house, and I had to wait almost an hour one night just to brush my teeth and use the bathroom before going to bed.  The same thing happened before I left, and was not able to wait.  Not every guest respected the ""quick shower"" rule.  If there was just a room with a second toilet it would solve my only real issue with my stay."
443580,6049452,2013-07-28,2361365,Lisa,"This cute little shed was a good place to crash while visiting friends nearby in Seattle.  Wished the other guests had not been using the campfire outside while we were trying to sleep, but other than that we had a very nice stay and would recommend the place."
443580,6178577,2013-08-02,7226881,Jenny,"All went smoothly, overall.  
Only difficulty was VERY spotty Internet.
Saw other guests more than any hosts, but the other guests were all very nice.  "
443580,6320174,2013-08-08,1613974,Kimberly,"The cabin was a nice and cute stay! Especially when uou're newly weds!
The neighboorhood is in between, when you're going downtown you're okay.
Monica and Erinn are nice and lovely girls, didn't saw them often but when we had the chance they were willing to tell and explain a lot."
443580,6429258,2013-08-12,4335086,Carly,"My partner and I stayed in the Sweet Cabin at Monika's place. All facilities were great. There was not a lot of communication with Monika, however she provides you with a VERY detailed house manual prior to your arrival - which is sufficient. I would recommend this accommodation. "
443580,6488905,2013-08-14,7188183,Jeff,"Great deal, but cabin is not as private as I hoped. It sits in front yard near the sidewalk & road, so it feels exposed. Also back small window near bed is not protected except for bushes around it, so didn't feel completely safe. Just know what you're paying for.

Also, place is entirely self-serve, so be aware. However, Monika & Erinn are very responsive and can give assistance if needed. Easy walk to Capitol Hill!"
443580,6527290,2013-08-15,7711034,Phuong,"We had to find a place for 1 night stay in Seattle, and Monika was very nice to reply to our request early with complete, detailed instructions as in how to get to the house and how everything works. There are other people sharing the main house, so we see them all the time when using kitchen and bathroom. The cabin we stayed in was very hot in late afternoon in the summer, but there's a fan there to cool it down a little bit. It's hard to get wifi from the cabin after around 10 o'clock, but we only stayed there for 1 day so it was not a problem at all. 

There's a bus stop only 1 block away, and it takes around 15-20 mins to go downtown. China town is in walking distance (around 20 mins walking), which is very convenient if you need grocery and instant noodles. 

In general we had a good experience staying there this summer. :) "
443580,6735895,2013-08-23,4777563,Arnout,"The garden cottage was very small but reasonably clean. The bathroom in the house was shared with quite many people, it's a busy house! Checkin went smooth, even though Monica herself was not present during our stay. 

The house is located at a ten/fifteen minute walk to bars and restaurants, which isn't so bad. The bikes were unfortunately not available at the time. "
443580,6762134,2013-08-24,7849127,Sean,The cabin suited our needs. We didn't have the opportunity to meet Monika but Erin was helpful and answered any questions we had.
443580,7038860,2013-09-04,7701465,Eran,"Sweet cabin, close to down town and easy to get to/from airport. We enjoyed our stay! Be aware that when house is fully occupied you are sharing a bathroom with up to 5 other people."
443580,7115260,2013-09-07,2940592,Aga & Carl,"This Airbnb experience was more of a backpackers hostel than charming Airbnb. 
At one stage there was something like 8 people staying here, all sharing the one toilet and bathroom! There was a line to shower at 7am!!
The cabin we stayed in was private but beware of the room selection when choosing your accommodation. One room in particular is separated from the kitchen/ dining by a sheer curtain, open to all passing noise and light. 
The location itself is not that close to downtown either and it's a fair hike to get groceries, etc. 
Personally, I would spend my pennies on staying at an Airbnb where you are not just another number, as was the feeling we had here. On the plus side, the other guests were really lovely."
443580,7181755,2013-09-09,8549272,Norbert,"This was my first AirBNB experience, an experience for which I had high hopes. After a very special night in Seattle for my brother's wedding, I came to Monika's ""Sweet Cabin"" where I was not greeted by key waiting for me as promised. After checking the door to see if it was unlocked as also instructed, an upset guest came out asking why I was trying to get in her room at 2AM. This was all very confusing considering I had made very specific arrangements with Monika a few days prior for my late night arrival. 

After contacting with Monika, she claimed that AirBNB double booked the room and that I needed to call them to sort it out. She claimed ""it has happened to several guests I've seen over the last 12-14 months."" 

It was very disappointing that she took zero responsibility for letting another guest stay in the room that I had booked a full week in advance, including having a number of correspondences with her as to when I would be arriving.

After 2 hours of trying to fix a giant mess of an issue that I had no responsibility of causing, I stayed at a Holiday Inn. AirBnB took charge for the mishap and refunded me fully. 

At the end of my correspondence with Monika, she told me to ""Go f**k yourself. You are banned from my house."" I was perfectly cordial throughout the ordeal leading up to this moment, so you would image I felt completely blind-sighted by this.

I would not support this person who claims to be a stellar host and small business owner. An ounce of remorse would have gone a long way during this entire situation, but instead I got a giant F U. Thanks Monika!"
443580,7183478,2013-09-09,1335254,Claire,"Great place. Erinn was great and it was an easy process. Place was a little dirty but apart from that it was absolutely great. Downside was it double booked and we had strangers banging on the door and trying to barge into the place, almost gave us a heart attack."
443580,7367021,2013-09-17,7899366,Anna,"My fiancé and I stayed the the cottage when we went to a NFL game at century link field. Staying in the cottage was perfect, only 2 miles from the stadium. The cottage was clean and the bed was very comfortable. Monica was very nice and helpful. I would stay there again:) "

443580,7699526,2013-09-30,2896568,Jon,"This place is exactly what you would expect for the price. It's a great place to rest your head at night, but I would pretty much just leave it at that. If you will be spending the bulk of your time out and about and want to save on accommodations, this is a good option for you. If you want a cozy place to hang out, I would maybe consider shilling out some additional dubloons and upgrading to something swankier. "
443580,7742144,2013-10-01,7063310,Graham,Great location only a 10 min walk from the bars on capital hill/pike st. You can walk into town in half an hour if needed.  The neighbourhood is nice and safe.  The cabin was functional and tidy.  Not a fluffy airbnb experience but at the price it can't be beat.  
443580,10233508,2014-02-08,10059577,Deborah,"Cute little cabin - just a bedroom. Basic place to sleep, but nice to access kitchen/bathroom/etc in the main house. Had a little trouble with the wifi, so wasn't able to work ... glad that I brought a good book to read! Neighborhood is so very convenient to hospital and bus lines."
443580,10517525,2014-02-23,11853793,Shirley,"The Sweet Cabin is a cute space with a bed and heater, perfect for visiting Seattle when you spend most of the day out. The area is great-- close to all the main bus stops and just a short ride away from downtown Seattle and University of Washington. 

My friend and I spent our three days in Pike Place Market (Great Wheel and Pike Place Chowder), University of Washington, and a student-friendly cafe called Ugly Mug Cafe (studying, of course-- what else would you do on vacation). The place was great for a chill getaway and had a home-y feel overall. "
