132160,32755858,2015-05-21,29063410,Bowen,It was lovely experience staying at Natalie's. Green lake is beautiful and neoghbourhood is great!I would definitely recommend this place!
132160,33263155,2015-05-26,6903955,Scott,"The neighborhood is wonderful for walking- very close to Green Lake and various coffee shops, a great grocery store, and restaurants.  This is our second time staying here and the suite has a nice relaxed atmosphere.  The two bedrooms are a nice size, and I think it is a perfect place for 2-4 people. The back yard has been fenced since our first visit and it provides a lot of privacy.  Natalie did a nice job with communications before our arrival. "
132160,33770829,2015-06-01,27224066,Laurie,"Natalie's guest suite was the perfect place to stay for my friend and me while we were attending a course in the area. The 2 bedrooms was large and comfortable, both with large closets. The bathroom is also spacious, and the shower is great! (I'm picky about showers.) The kitchen had all the necessities + some nice treats. Everything was clean and modern and comfortable. 

Even with all the lovely indoor space, my favorite space was probably the outside patio. It is quiet and private, with clean, comfortable furniture and a large umbrella for shade. We were lucky enough to be in Seattle when the weather was sunny and warm, so we took advantage of that. 

The location of this place is wonderful. Close to Green Lake (we walked around the lake the first night we stayed), as well as little shopping areas and funky neighborhoods. Within walking distance of a variety of shops and restaurants, with easy transit to downtown Seattle.

When I'm in Seattle, I will definitely want to stay here again. Thank you, Natalie!"
132160,34523108,2015-06-09,17637953,Kay,"The location was just perfect for us.  We didn't arrive till after 10 PM.  The lights were on and the place was set up and ready for us.
"
132160,34815983,2015-06-12,2004891,Darwin Lopez Tsurumi,"We had a lovely time in this clean, cozy apartment. We particularly enjoyed the outdoor ""living room"", and had a delightful brunch there. One block from walking, eating, and coffee -or-teaing at Green Lake. Natalie was responsive to all questions and concerns, though we didn't actually meet her (we appreciated the privacy). Sleeping with our heads right under a busy street was a little difficult during early morning rush hour, and we were dreaming we'd see bunnies in the backyard, but my husband, parents in law from Tokyo, son and I had an overall wonderful time. "
132160,35654766,2015-06-21,31214041,Daniel,"Great Location! in the Green Lake neighborhood.  Coming from out of state and not knowing the area, it was convenient to walk to several restaurants, markets and pubs.  The accommodations are as listed.  It was clean and fully stocked with towels, kitchen ware and even Netflix! We definitely recommend it. "
132160,36172287,2015-06-26,29796588,Denard,"Natalie's basement apartment was absolutely beautiful with all the amenities a person would want in a home. The unit was so nicely laid out, I am redoing my own apartment to mimic the cleanliness and look! Natalie left amazing notes of all the grand restaurants and things to do around the fantastic Green Lake area. No question, I would stay here anytime I come to Seattle! She was very good with her communications and very friendly host.  "
132160,36657170,2015-06-30,29328316,Buff,"Great unit, super location and welcoming hosts.  My first experience with Airbnb and it couldn't have been better.  Photos and description were helpful and accurate.  With Green Lake and all the various restaurants in the neighborhood, the location couldn't have been better, so much so that with ride services like Uber, there was no need to rent a car.  Finally, our hosts are big users of Airbnb themselves and gave us examples from the French Riviera and Tikal in Guatemala.  Highly recommend the Green Lake Guest Suite."
132160,36892544,2015-07-02,5340381,Narayan,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay in the Greenlake Guest Suite. It's very spacious, very comfortable and has great cooling for those hot summer days. The back patio area was also a bonus. The location next to the lake was great, too. Natalie did a great job with communicating the instructions for getting into the apartment as well. All around great experience."
132160,37560540,2015-07-08,20186375,Grace,"Everything was exactly as Natalie described. And I loved her attention to detail in the layout so that there were little tables where you needed one, and supplies and even night light, etc. Biggest plus was being walking distance to Green Lake and all the great restaurants around it. She even has adorable bunnies that occassionally hop around the garden. I would certainly return."
132160,37763159,2015-07-10,35038500,Christina,"Natalie warmly greeted my family members who arrived first and got them situated in her cute basement apartment. The property is easily accessible, close to the lake, and perfect for a small group needing a central location. Also liked the lock was a passcode rather than a key. Clean, spacious, good wifi, nice neighborhood. Would definitely stay again!"
132160,38258308,2015-07-14,1284501,Darcy,"This is a comfortable, well-stocked basement apartment.  I stayed with my son's family and there were 6 in all.  We did not feel crowded.  The location is so nice with green lake a few steps away, as well as restaurants and groceries a short walk away.  Natalie was a gracious host.  I would recommend this spot."
132160,38743435,2015-07-18,36285607,Manasi,"Natalie has a lovely place with a private sit out at the back. I was able to have my family stay there for 3 days & they enjoyed the experience. It was also a big plus to have Green Lake close by.
The kitchen was well stocked with pots, pans & other very useful things, so were also able to cook. I whole heartedly recommend this cosy little place."
132160,39261266,2015-07-22,16109599,Danny,Our work retreat (of 5 people) was well accommodated at Natalie's house.  The place was just as described and it had all the needed amenities.  The location was amazing and Natalie was also very flexible and even let us check in much earlier.  This rental is a great value! 
132160,39653435,2015-07-25,30539059,Alex,"Despite the fact that I never met Natalie she gave very clear instructions and it was very easy to get in and out of the apartment. She was kind whenever we communicated and she left behind everything she promised and a lot more.  The listing was very accurate and the location was perfect being right across the street from the lake. Perfect location, plenty of size and very comfortable. "
132160,40088366,2015-07-28,32231142,Jenny,"This was my first Airbnb experience and it couldn't have gone better! My stay at Natalie's was wonderful, her home is beautifully decorated and in such a convenient location. Her home is steps away from Green Lake and a wonderful walking path which I took advantage of each morning. It's nearby so many great looking shops and restaurants, I wish I stayed longer to enjoy them all. Our group included 5 adults and 1 infant, never once did we feel crowded with two bedrooms and a foldout futon. Natalie did a great job letting me know what to expect during my stay, and even offered to have the space available for early check in if needed. I didn't get the opportunity to meet her as she respected our privacy, but I always felt welcome in her home. I would definitely recommend her home to anyone looking for a comfortable, central, place to stay and I hope when I come back to Seattle I will have the opportunity to stay here again."
132160,40489065,2015-07-31,37936891,Jean,"We thoroughly enjoyed our three night stay at Natalie's apartment.  The location was perfect - just a block or so from Green Lake, restaurants, and coffee shops.   The apartment was clean, well furnished, had comfy beds, large closets, nice big bathroom,  kitchen, and a private entry.  We used Uber to get around a couple of times, but public transportation is also really convenient.  The apartment was on a fairly busy street, but traffic noise was not a problem.  Even though Seattle temperatures were into the 90's, the apartment was comfortable.  We did get to meet one of the house bunnies, and loved the great outdoor area.  I liked the privacy and sense of security at this apartment.
We would definitely stay at Natalie's again when we have another Seattle trip scheduled.  "
132160,41197013,2015-08-05,2134476,Jean,"Natalie was an amazing host. We heard from her prior to arriving and knew just how to gain access to the apartment and when to arrive. She was very welcoming and available to us if we needed her. The apartment is just as described, and was perfect for us. The weather was ideal so we enjoyed the back deck every day, and we walked around Green Lake every morning. There are lots of shops and restaurants within walking distance, and we took advantage of several of them. We also walked a few blocks to catch the bus to downtown. Everything is so convenient there. We would definitely stay there again and highly recommend it. Thanks, Natalie!"
132160,41613263,2015-08-08,35341486,Cheryl,"My husband, son and I had a wonderful stay !
We had plenty of room and everything was clean and tidy! 
Looking forward to staying again!
Thank you,
Cheryl"
132160,42381155,2015-08-13,30305961,Joanie,"Our host was great. We were able to see her place before we accepted the reservations to be sure it met our needs. Natalie answered all our questions, her place was very clean and easy to be in. I would recommend it to anyone. "
132160,43355832,2015-08-19,31687437,Amy,"This was our first airbnb and we enjoyed it. Natalie welcomed us prior to arrival via email giving us information needed for access to the apartment and use of the outdoor patio. The apartment was plenty roomy for the three of us staying there. It was clean and comfortable. The location was perfect - close to Green Lake for a walk around the lake in the morning and a short, stress free commute downtown via public transportation."
132160,44295813,2015-08-25,35655712,John,Hi Natalie! Just a quick note to say how much we enjoyed our stay. You made us feel very welcome but we're not at all obtrusive. The accommodation was even better than we had hoped for from the photos and description. The area is idyllic and blends easy access to town with beautiful surroundings by the lake. We would definitely visit again.  What we really liked was it had a really comfortable home feel. 
132160,44896386,2015-08-30,12993654,Jasmin,"Wir waren 5 Tage bei Natalie zu Besuch und können nur von dieser Unterkunft schwärmen. Sehr viel Platz, sehr hochwertige Küchengeräte, tolle Zimmer und ideal für 4 Personen. 
Selbst eine Waschmaschine wäre zur Verfügung gestanden, die wir aber nicht gebraucht haben.
Natalie war bei der Unterkunft sehr nett, hat aber auch uns danach in ruhe gelassen und uns gebeten bei Fragen sich nicht zu scheuen hoch zu kommen. 
Nur empfehlenswert wir würden jederzeit wieder dort hin kommen. 
LG Michi, Sarah, Jasmin und Tobias"
132160,45418982,2015-09-02,31247873,Austin,"The place was exactly like the photos and description. It was very clean and quiet. Just what we were expecting! Natalie was attentive and able to accommodate for the little amount of requests we had, and she always responds quickly. I would definitely stay here again or recommend her space to friends. "
132160,45683348,2015-09-05,39721742,Elizabeth,"The place was as described. Instructions regarding entrance, care of the place and the neighborhood were clear. The apartment is very nicely set up and well appointed. Good neighborhood with groceries, restaurants and public tranortation within walking distance. Really nice neighborhood with walking paths all around the lake, less than a block away. Room to park on the street. Enjoyed meeting Natalie."
132160,46062028,2015-09-07,8009777,Nicholas,We had a very nice stay at Natalie's home in green lake. The place was spacious and I'm a good neighborhood with lots of restaurants and hints to walk to while also being close to downtown. Natalie was very helpful and easy to contact to check in and out and we would definitely stay again. 
132160,47037310,2015-09-15,1827093,Elise,"Natalie's private apartment on Green Lake was the perfect location for my family and I. We enjoyed the cozy, quiet setting.  Anything we needed was a walk away by the lake. The apartment was clean and well stocked. We hope to visit again soon. "
132160,47519617,2015-09-19,11669174,Thomas,"Excellent lodging: nice, clean, quiet and in good neighborhood. Close to local restaurants. "
132160,48816940,2015-09-28,44632332,Rebecca,"Natalie's place was just as described.  The location is especially great with so many restaurants, parks etc to walk to and getting in and out of the apartment was easy and private. The apartment was nicely equipped with comfort and kitchen essentials and plenty of entertainment extras. And the easy access to laundry was very convenient. I just wish we could have stayed longer. Natalie was a great communicator also. "
132160,49738474,2015-10-05,45444291,Greg,This was a great location; right by Green lake which has an excellent walking path. Coffee places nearly and the suite is both quiet and private. easy access to downtown as well. 
132160,50833676,2015-10-15,24738078,Andrew,"Listing was accurate and the neighborhood was really a lovely place. The house is not lakefront, but is only a short 2 minute walk and you're there! We never met Natalie, but she was prompt and courteous, and provided us with all the accommodations needed (wifi, instructions, local store, clean facilities). Good neighborhood, very quiet, mellow place to enjoy Seattle without all the busy-ness!"
132160,55579168,2015-12-02,29574725,Gail,"We had a great week at Natalie's garden-level apartment near Green Lake in Seattle over Thanksgiving.  It was less than a block to the Lake Trail, restaurants, coffee shops and more.  The family residential neighborhood was well-maintained with cute Pacific Coast style bungalows.  

The apartment was immaculate and new-feeling.  Natalie has it lovingly decorated and nostalgic pictures of Green Lake's past are everywhere.  The kitchen was well-supplied with everything you need to prepare meals or enjoy home-brewed Seattle coffee.  The unit was secure but still convenient to enter, and very private.  We would stay here again in a flash.  It is so convenient  to everything.  PCC Market is a few  blocks away and you can catch the bus to downtown easily.  Only 30 min by car from the airport makes it a breeze to come and go.  The full kitchen and laundry make things very comfortable.  We had a great time and  appreciate everything Natalie did to make us feel comfortable  and safe.  "
132160,56421563,2015-12-13,4087995,Sandy,"We are very pleased with our decision to book this Airbnb for my fiancé's parents' first visit to Seattle. Their home was very well maintained and it was a great space that was very well equipped. Natalie was very prompt in her replies and welcoming at booking. She even remembered where my fiancé's parents were from during our original correspondence. The location is within very close proximity to Greenlake and many restaurants. For those that are from out of town, there were great instructions and tour guides available for guests. I also loved the Christmas lights they put it. It really lit up the space at night. :)"
132160,57069599,2015-12-21,16324882,Barbara,"Our stay at Natalie's was enjoyable-The location was great for us, the apartment as described and Natalie was very responsive to inquireis. We especially liked the fact that the entire place was so clean. We would stay there again if the occasion arises. "

7561333,41155056,2015-08-04,2094605,Tony,"Jonathan was a friendly and welcoming host.  The condo is beautiful, well located for access to all of West Seattle, and exactly as described.  We look forward to staying there again."
7561333,41500438,2015-08-07,42531,Bryan,Jonathan was very welcoming and responsive to any questions. His place is extremely well taken care of and the neighborhood also has lots of places to eat and shop. My first time visiting Seattle was an enjoyable one thanks to Jonathan.
7561333,42960339,2015-08-16,38613265,Bianca,We had a great time staying at your place. The location is great because your not that far from downtown and everything is near. Thanks again for letting us stay. We wished we would have met you. 
7561333,44030858,2015-08-23,34477766,Heather,"Had a wonderful time! Jon and Dayna are both lovely hosts, although ours was a short visit during the week and we didn't cross paths with them much,  they made us feel very welcome and relaxed.  Great location, comfortable bedroom and awesome bathroom on our side of the apartment.  Thanks so much for having us!"
7561333,44977957,2015-08-30,39549560,Anthony,"Jonathan, Dayna, & O’Malley are awesome!  Great place in a great location. Very friendly and gave us loads of suggestions on what to see and do during our stay. The roof top patio has an awesome view!  Hope to stay there again!

"
7561333,45175346,2015-08-31,9767614,Carrie,Wonderful host and super convenient location ! Would stay there again!
7561333,45355854,2015-09-01,15949818,Philipp,"Jonathan and Dayna are two amazing people - we enjoyed our stay! Besides the room being very clean, cute and cozy the whole flat reflects their open minds and friendliness. A place you will feel great in! "
7561333,45641829,2015-09-04,36035311,Karl,Very clean and nice......AND.... right in the heart of the Admiral district. Jonathan and Dayna are wonderful!!
7561333,46154303,2015-09-08,31169178,Kathleen,"A perfect stay. The neighborhood is really nice, with lots of restaurants, grocery stores, and coffee shops, and walking distance to the water taxi to downtown. The space is fairly small but lovely, with a large bathroom and very comfy bed. Jon and Mr. O'Malley (the dog) were both very friendly and welcoming. Thank you!"
7561333,46657407,2015-09-12,27012933,Sarah,Had a great experience staying at this condo. Jon and Dana were very nice and made us feel welcome. I loved having coffee houses and a really good market within walking distance. The bedroom we stayed in was small but cozy - the only thing was that street noise was loud at night since we had the window open as it was pretty warm in the room when we were trying to sleep. So I would recommend bringing earplugs if you're a light sleeper. Also loved the West Seattle area with Alki Beach just a few minutes drive away. 
7561333,46923851,2015-09-14,11121888,Michael,We absolutely loved our stay at Johnathan's place. He was very hospitable and the bedroom was clean and private. The rooftop view is amazing! We would definitely stay here again. 
7561333,47403127,2015-09-18,7027989,Owen,"Seamless and smooth experience, not a single issue to complain about. Would definitely stay again!"
7561333,47595443,2015-09-20,31011548,Rebecca,Jonathan and his fiancé were perfect. The apartment was beautifully clean and the bed was very comfortable. They were extremely helpful and very knowledgeable about Seattle. The apartment was very close to the city in a really beautiful area. They also have an extremely cute dog. Thank you for having us keep in contact.  
7561333,49142968,2015-10-01,41418925,William,"Cozy bedroom with private bath. Clean, quiet with all linens waiting for me upon arrival. Jonathan gave me a lot tips about what to see, the public transit and good places to dine. The rooftop is very serene with a fantastic view. The market is just steps away is open 24/7. "
7561333,49859037,2015-10-06,25146037,Linda,"Jonathan made my experience comfortable, private, and easy.  I was able to come and go at my convenience.  Having my own bath was a plus.  I loved being able to go up to the roof garden to enjoy the beautiful view of the Seattle skyline.  The apartment is located in a charming older neighborhood with shops and restaurants within easy walking distance.  It was just right for my needs.  They also have the cutest, sweetest dog on the planet! "
7561333,50476517,2015-10-12,29751388,Anna,Great room in a great location! Jon was very accommodating and responsive and it was great to have my own room and bathroom.
7561333,50710856,2015-10-13,1924335,Conny & Harro,Thank you so much for this night in Seattle! It was the most cosy bed in our last 3 weeks and we were very happy to stay with you both! Your are fantastic hosts!! Your rooftop terrace is great and the skyline of seattle was a amazing picture to say goodbye and to leave back home! Come over to Berlin whenever you plan to do a Europe Trip! Conny & Harro
7561333,53445351,2015-11-08,32223518,Dhruve,Jonathan was very warm and considerate as a host. The room was neat and organized and had all the necessary amenities required for a comfortable stay including a private bathroom. The bed was one of the most comfortable one's that I have experienced till date. Overall it was a great experience. 
7561333,53559674,2015-11-09,48009404,Joe,"Jonathan is clearly an airbnb veteran. I arrived to a cozy room with magazines, books and bath towels laid out for me to make use of. The apartment is quiet, clean and comfortable. Their dog O'Malley is the most relaxed pup I have ever met. Jonathan provided a list of recommendations including a cafe for breakfast called Admiral Bird, just around the corner. I cannot speak highly enough of this establishment. Karina, the owner, is quite possibly the friendliest person I have met. West Seattle seems like a great little neighborhood. "
7561333,54001438,2015-11-15,20929180,Nick,"It was a short stay, but Jonathan's place is exactly as described. Thanks for the hospitality!"
7561333,54212764,2015-11-16,8030880,Micajah,Great time at Jonathan's during 24 hour layover in Seattle. Really easy to get landed even though we got in late. Jonathan set out awesome towels so we didn't need ours. Place was clean and cozy. Dog was nice and polite. Cool neighborhood too! Seattle touring was awesome! Worked out way better than an airport hotel (and I had just stayed at the Seattle Airport Hilton a few nights prior for work) Thanks!
7561333,54816154,2015-11-23,254465,Jeri,"Jonathan was communicative and available, gave perfect directions and entry instructions, and offered local places to eat, get coffee, and explore. We felt we had the place to ourselves and everything we needed, including towels and bath needs. We didn't end up using the kitchen but it was big and clean, would have been perfect if we needed it. The dog was super chill and didn't make a peep, even when we first came in. The location is great, just a couple minutes from the beach and the bridge, easy parking. Great place to stay...thanks, Jonathan!"
7561333,55245103,2015-11-29,28306135,Suzanne,"Jonathon was a very responsive and friendly host. My husband and I found our four day stay to be just what we wanted and expected. We were perfectly comfortable in our bedroom and adjoining bath with access to the kitchen, living room with cozy gas fireplace and deck. We could not ask for a better location in the fun West Seattle neighborhood near our family. We especially appreciated the access across the street to the fabulous Metropolitan Market for amazing hot food, wonderful breakfast croissants and pecan rolls and great wine for the family get togethers. We would stay again."
7561333,55996133,2015-12-07,15539674,Janett,"Their place was great.  Had fresh towels, fresh linens and laid out information about their location and west seattle in general.  Very accommodating given my fiance's flight got in around 11 pm during the weekday.  Jonathan was very responsive.  Nice to have private room with bathroom.  Thank you both for having us! "
7561333,56268636,2015-12-11,48282294,Constantin,Amazing host with an awesome view.  Made me feel really welcome and took the time out to explain the city to me.  I had arrived with no one home and there were clear instructions on how to get settled in.  Awesome stay!
7561333,57720781,2015-12-28,35247187,Sarah,"The apartment is excellent! The environment is very clean and quiet. They provided me towels, shampoo and body wash, hand wash, and hair dryer. It's so convenient living in the apartment, and I felt very comfortable staying with them. "
7561333,58460720,2016-01-02,37933132,Charlie,Great communicators.... place very nice and upscale.... area was convenient & agreeable too!
4384800,22053032,2014-10-28,131174,BriAnne,"What an amazing place! We stayed for 2 nights and wished we could just move in :) The layout was perfect for entertaining old friends during the first night- the rooftop patio was a perfect hangout (and the baby didn't hear any noise- bonus!). It was also the perfect place to catch the sunrise. The neighborhood was great- there is a coffee shop literally steps from the door and many restaurants within walking distance. It's a 10 minute walk to the water taxi so no worries about driving or finding parking downtown. And, the shower... it's like a spa experience. The hosts provided lots of information about the neighborhood and city, as well as menus, maps, and transportation options. We will definitely be back!"
4384800,27074895,2015-02-24,19969974,Santosh,The listing description was very accurate. The view was simply amazing. Very nice apartment. Had a wonderful time there.
4384800,27293922,2015-03-01,27285334,May,"Krystal have been very nice and helpful. 
The appartement is gorgeous, cozy and outstanding. Amazing view
I definitely recommend this place. "
4384800,30496224,2015-04-23,26030522,Yehia,Excellent cozy apartment well furnished good neighbor 
4384800,32964113,2015-05-24,28158383,Caitlyn,"We had a GREAT experience at Krystal's place.  The view was incredible, as advertised - we could see the entire skyline, Mt. Olympus, the Cascades... it was amazing.  We loved being so close to public transportation (it was very easy to get into the city) while being outside of the city enough to enjoy a quiet and calm atmosphere.  Really, such a special place!"
4384800,34940406,2015-06-14,7085207,Dana,"The apartment was just what we expected from the description and photos.  Small but cozy and comfortable - we were 2 adults and 4 teenagers.  We loved being in a neighborhood other than downtown Seattle and especially the coffee shop right downstairs!  There was plenty to explore in West Seattle although we did spend most of our time in downtown Seattle using the buses and ferry.

Krystal was great - always responsive and helpful!"
4384800,36779694,2015-07-01,32696941,Arshiya,Krystal was very promt on whatever questions we had. The house was in great condition and was as per the listing description. The best part was the deck and the view from it. 
4384800,38705350,2015-07-18,2092451,Tim,I arrived in Seattle a bit earlier than expected and Krystal was able to meet me within 15 minutes to keep me from waiting long. The listing was described just as the listing and the rooftop deck was very relaxing! 
4384800,39487231,2015-07-24,71324,Danny,"I didn't meet Krystal, but she was quick with communication, and there were absolutely no hassles with the apartment. North Admiral is a lovely area, and a great base for exploring Seattle. The coffee shop next door was a bonus too. 
"
4384800,44311868,2015-08-25,29566947,Rami,We enjoyed our stay at this penthouse. The access to the private deck with the amazing view of the city skyline was a huge plus. The house was exactly as described and had all the amenities needed. 
4384800,44759434,2015-08-29,33079138,James,"Great place to stay, neighborhood was beautiful, incredible views of Seattle. People in the surrounding area are helpful and real mellow.  Krystal is awesome. We are coming back."
4384800,45141906,2015-08-31,40651221,Lisa,"We really had a good time staying at the Penthouse.  The location was good, very close to a nice pizzeria, Safeway and had a coffee shop downstairs.  It was also close to a water taxi to take us over to downtown Seattle  for us to site-see at Pike Place.  The rooftop deck was very nice with a view (we would've spent more time at the deck if it didn't rain so much).  The host Krystal, although we didn't meet her, was very accommodating and answered our questions very promptly.  "
4384800,45409886,2015-09-02,41085386,Becky,"Krystal Kelley was a wonderful host -- accommodating an early arrival as well as accommodating a later departure. Her accommodations fit the needs of a family of seven, was very clean, and the pictures accurate. I would recommend the North Admiral to all who want comfort, views, and home amenities. Restaurants and stores were within walking distance. My family had a very good time in Seattle and   much of this was because of the pleasant accommodations."
4384800,45784968,2015-09-06,20185008,David,"We had such a great time at your place. Thank you for being so responsive with our requests, it's was great place and the upper deck is amazing to watch sunsets and hang out.  We took the water taxi and uber to and from downtown Seattle and it was easy and fun. "
4384800,46178663,2015-09-08,11123061,Michele,"I loved this spot!! Amazing views of the city skyline, awesome neighborhood, and host was extremely friendly, prompt, and checking in was easy! I highly recommend this place."
4384800,46652998,2015-09-12,20614016,Danny,"The Penthouse was epic to say the least. Clean, cute, and with abundant sunlight. The best part was the view of Seattle from the deck and master bedroom. Will be back to when in Seattle for business or pleasure."
4384800,46899120,2015-09-14,4754277,Martin,"My wife, friends, and I love the house, the neighborhood, and especially the view."
4384800,48066760,2015-09-23,3550356,Jeanette,"The apartment was exactly how it was listed on Airbnb.  This location was perfect for us.  It is within walking distance to our son's home.
We were also able to walk to restaurants and shopping.  
It was alittle cold to use the deck, but if the weather was nicer we would be sitting on the deck.

We would like to stay here again.

Jeanette and Tony Chavez"
4384800,51613936,2015-10-22,15423106,Nicholas,"The place was magnificent. Everything we needed was catered for excellently. Easy and hassle-free check-in and check-out. Further, the view from the roof is pretty amazing. Good amenities as well as an excellent bathroom. We fit five people easily (although I hogged the master bedroom so I can't talk haha). Would recommend this place highly. Thanks Krystal :)"
4384800,54533246,2015-11-21,10441864,Dana Kay,"A wonderful stay at the Admiral Penthouse in West Seattle! Great neighborhood with much within walking distance or a quick cab/Uber. Loved having the coffee house and cool bar on the first floor. Clean apartment, amazing shower, and unbeatable views. Krystal was very helpful at checkin and responsive the couple of times we contacted her during our stay. Highly recommend! "
8054518,45030579,2015-08-30,34942811,Franziska,"Melinda was very kind and provided a great first AirBnB experience for us! I had lots of questions and she answered them promptly and also gave us some good advice for our trip. Her apartment is cute, cozy and clean. "
8054518,45880159,2015-09-06,9872893,Jane,"Melinda's apartment is a great place to stay while exploring Seattle. The neighborhood is wonderful, easily walkable to the heart of capital hill and a fast bus ride to downtown.  It's a large studio, that's very bright and clean. I didn't get to meet Melinda, but she checked in to make sure I got into the apartment ok. Definitely recommend staying here on you next trip to Seattle."
8054518,46802454,2015-09-13,43177414,Daniel,Melinda was a great host and very quick to respond to any questions. The apartment is in a great location and very clean. I really enjoyed my stay.
8054518,49502088,2015-10-04,223456,Marina,"Melinda's little pad is in a great location. A pretty neighborhood, central to great cafes and restaurants. Make sure you try the Wandering Goose for breakfast! Her studio is homely and clean. Communication was stellar! "
8054518,51238472,2015-10-18,21369648,Nicholas,"Melinda's is a great base camp for a Seattle weekend adventure!  Melinda  was easy to communicate with, flexible, and made the process exceedingly easy. Thanks!"
8054518,52022841,2015-10-25,405182,Wynn,"Great space in a great building in a great area that's close to everything but far enough away (walking distance) to get some peace and quiet. Oh, and friendly, helpful host."
8054518,53425010,2015-11-08,4900368,Jacqueline,"Melinda was very responsive, communicative, and kept at very tidy place. Great location, super close to 15th street. "
8054518,54039552,2015-11-15,13080361,Matthew,Great experience.  Melinda was very helpful and the studio was fantastic.  Thank you so much!
2978929,13485808,2014-05-28,2433098,Lindsey,"Sarah's studio is cozy and picturesque just as it appears/as described. It is in a quaint old building in a great, central neighborhood. Sarah was very accommodating, and quickly responded to any questions or issues we had before, during and after our stay. "
2978929,13630660,2014-06-01,15692815,Michael,"Everything was great; no complaints. Sarah seemed to have foreseen all the little details: where to park, how to check in and out of the apartment, etc.. We were very ""at home"" in the attractive space and did not find ourself in need of anything during our brief stay. In addition, the location of the apartment was perfect: within walking distance of everything that interested us: the International District, the waterfront, Pike's Place, ... We also greatly appreciated the privacy that Sarah afforded us."
2978929,14622965,2014-06-23,934351,Hannes,"Sarah's studio is perfect if you want to stay downtown and reach many places by a short walk. The studio is in a lovely old building with lots of light and everything else you need for a stay in Seattle. Sarah is helpful, communication easy. Wonderful stay!"
2978929,14968706,2014-06-30,739461,Lauren,"The studio and Sarah were great!

Communication with Sarah was super easy, quick and she had every little detail planned out -- she sent me a very throughout document upon checking in. 

The apartment itself was beautiful! Just like the pictures, dreamy, really. It is a quiet building in a great location -- I was able to walk to a lot of places -- Sarah also gave me some great reccos! And ladies, the bathroom had good shower pressure! I was nervous being in an older building, but it was great.

Would stay here again!"
2978929,15683544,2014-07-14,12602144,Rachel,Sarah was great! She was super accommodating and communicative! The photos perfectly justify the space and was the perfect place for our first time in Seattle. We were able to walk to everything we wanted to see in Seattle along with some other local favorites close to her apartment! :) 
2978929,15913018,2014-07-18,3031465,Emily,"Sarah's place was perfect! Close to the convention center, her studio offered everything I needed. The bed is nice and comfy and the whole apartment is beautifully decorated. 

The walk to the convention center is easy - just a few blocks down 8th Ave - and you can even walk through a park instead of under the highway to enter the building. Although walking under the highway is a little sketchy at night, the rest of the walk is very well lit and perfectly safe even for a solo female traveler. 

Sarah's wifi was fast enough for me to get lots of work done and even watch a few movies at night. I didn't do any cooking, but the kitchen seemed to be fully stocked as well. My only complaint is that I didn't stay longer! I would stay at Sarah's studio again. "
2978929,16082318,2014-07-22,4968288,Bianca,"Our stay at Sarah's Bohemian Studio was absolutely perfect! For a young couple like ourselves, it was perfect with everything we may have needed! Communication with Sarah was easy and check-in and check-out was smooth and convenient! Thank you for the great space for our lovely Seattle stay!"
2978929,16716988,2014-08-01,16343760,Frank,"Awesome studio! Sarah was very helpful and had all of the necessary information needed for a great stay.  Cannot beat the location, and her price was extremely reasonable!  A great experience overall with all the comforts of home.  Would definitely stay again on next visit to Seattle."
2978929,17349748,2014-08-11,5082000,Monica,Nice place to stay. Short 10 minute walk to the downtown area. Very convenient for me and my fiancé :) Sarah was out of town at the time but left very clear instructions for us and was always available via email if we needed anything. Overall  fine stay! 
2978929,17619644,2014-08-15,16598828,Olivia,Everything was great!  The studio was easy to get to and BEAUTIFUL on the inside.  It is close to the downtown area and the Zip Cars are literally a block away. Sarah is definitely available and helpful. 
2978929,18237712,2014-08-24,69051,Jade,"When I walked into Sarah's apartment, I was in heaven. Her place is styled amazingly, I love all her little trinkets, crystals, plants, etc - it feels very homey and uplifting. Her bed was a dream to sleep on, like laying on a cloud of pillows.
The apartment is in an older building so there were some downfalls - mostly being able to hear people walk around above you, and the street traffic even when the windows are closed. The toilet's pipes actually broke during our stay as well, but luckily we had a vacant apartment next door we could use when necessary (though it was still awkward). 
The location is great if you mostly want to be near downtown or the waterfront. We ended up having to drive to most of the spots we wanted to get to, so coming back to try to find parking  at night was a nightmare. One night we circled around for twenty minutes. Some nights it was easier, though the spots were usually a few blocks away. 
Sarah was sweet to communicate with, and kept us updated when there was the toilet issue. "
2978929,18562552,2014-08-28,14887747,Susan,The apartment was clean and welcoming. I loved the plants! Sarah did a great job of communicating. The apartment is conveniently located if you are looking to explore downtown areas of Seattle.
2978929,19265891,2014-09-09,8539842,Adam,"My mom stayed here while she was in town for my wedding, and really enjoyed it.  The apartment is cute, the location is great (very convenient), and I think the pictures give you a really good sense of the space.  

Would stay again!  Thanks Sarah :)"
2978929,19385475,2014-09-11,12535683,Claire,"Apartment was great. Perfect size for a single or couple. Walk to downtown was about 10 minutes where you could find anything you need.

Sarah was a great host. Easy to get a hold of and provided some helpful info for things around the neighbourhood.

I would recommend this place for sure!"
2978929,19525614,2014-09-14,18889843,Ali,"Great experience overall. There aren't a lot of bells and whistles, but it met all of my basic needs: clean, super comfortable bed, quiet at night, good WiFi, and good water pressure in the shower. The apartment building itself is a little older and has a sort of musty feel, but the unit itself was cozy, comfortable, and felt fresh. "
2978929,20138122,2014-09-24,1712394,Hannah,"Overall wonderful experience. Sarah was very helpful and readily available throughout the booking process and during my stay. The apartment was adorable. Clean, full of character, and very cozy. Small but perfectly comfortable for 2 people. Studio size. Great location for exploring the city without a car. Highly recommend. "
2978929,20419188,2014-09-29,10107816,Jessica,"Sarah was an amazing host and did a great job of making every thing crystal clear so that there were no logistical questions such as how to get in and out of the building, street parking, etc. 
The studio was dreamy while comfortable/clean and great to wind down in after a long day of walking around the city. I would most definitely staying here again on my next Seattle visit!"
2978929,20706080,2014-10-04,71974,Christopher,Sarah communicates very quickly and accurately. She gave me many local tips. The apartment is located conveniently downtown with easy access to the city and the bed is super comfortable.
2978929,21225240,2014-10-13,5099638,Christine,"Excellent location. The place was clean, quiet, and within walking distance to major attractions in the city. Had a great stay! "
2978929,22576807,2014-11-10,17912966,Bernard,The apartment was in a great location as it was very close to the downtown area.  The neighbouring apartments were quiet and the street outside the apartment doesn't really get busy.
2978929,22983534,2014-11-19,22031848,Sarah,"My boyfriend and I had a great stay in Seattle at Sarah's studio.  The location was very convenient and the street parking pass was a huge plus.  The decor was beautiful and had much more personality than a standard hotel room.

It is in a very old building so the floors squeak a lot from upstairs neighbours moving around. Sleeping in was not a problem, however, with a handy pair of earplugs.

We would recommend others to stay here and would stay here again in the future."
2978929,23492756,2014-12-02,21826833,Amanda,Sarah was the ideal host! She sent me a detailed email prior to my arrival with all of the information I could possibly need! Her place was EXACTLY like the photos and even more welcoming in person. It was everything I was looking for during my stay in Seattle. I felt so relaxed and comfortable in her place. It was close to all of the restaurants and places I wanted to check out. I will definitely be staying here again and telling all my friends and family about it! 
2978929,24007173,2014-12-16,10453577,Justin,"Sarah is an amazing host and her place is impeccable!  The neighbor hood is great -- very central to restaurants, bars, museums, parks, etc.

Sarah provides clear instructions on how to enter her building/studio and also provides great recommendations on places to visit.  If I'm ever in Seattle, I would definitely book this space, again."
2978929,26660293,2015-02-16,3552636,Cathy,Sarah's place is adorable! It's small but has so much character. I loved the decoration so much that I might replicate it for my own bedroom! 
2978929,28417105,2015-03-23,25966169,Sara J.,"I give Sarah credit for getting a table and chairs.  Prior to our request for a table and chairs, her place did not have a place where 2 people could sit and eat, read, or watch a movie on a laptop.  No couch or chairs.  You would have to either sit on the bed or on the floor.  The location was great, the wi-fi worked, the bed was comfortable, and the linens were clean.  Other than that, the place was cute but quite overpriced:  $50.00 to $75.00 per night would have been more than reasonable (instead of the $121.00 that Sarah charged).  The lighting was inadequate for reading except in the kitchen (where we moved the table and chairs).  There were no nightstands and the lamps on each side of the bed were on the floor so they did not give enough light for reading in bed.  There were a few hangers in the closet, but no place to put underwear, socks, or shirts that did not need to be hanged.  We had to keep those clothes in the suitcase.  The bathroom only had one hook for a bath towel and no towel racks for hand towels.  There was hair in the bathtub, the toilet was not clean, and the toilet brush was disgusting.  The place was dusty  and there were bread crumbs on the carpet and on the stove top. When Sara moved the trash can and recycle bin to make room for the table she had wipe down the floor because it was dirty and sticky.  The drip pans on the stove were disgusting and not having a microwave was an inconvenience.  Also, a dish rack to dry clean plates would have been nice.  The door lock was very hard, if not impossible, to lock and unlock.  I personally was never able to lock it and/or unlock it.  I had to rely on Sara who had great difficulty but was able to do it.  The building hallways and stairs had a musty odor, though her place did not.  Sarah's cancellation policy was the only one of all the places we checked that would only refund 50 % even if you cancelled the next day of booking.  Also, we paid from the 14th through the 22nd, but on the 15th or 16th decided that we would spend the last 2 days at the Renaissance.  We called Sarah and told her that we'd be leaving on Friday morning and asked her if there was a chance that we could get back one-half of the money we had spent for those 2 days (Fri & Sat) and she refused.  We decided to splurge anyway and had a great time at the Renaissance.  Gaby.

2978929,29291060,2015-04-06,27814829,Sylvia,"I had a wonderful stay at Sarah's studio which was exactly as pictured- awesome interior decor.  Sarah is a great host who responded quickly to my inquiries and provided clear instructions about staying at the studio. Great location with a plus for the street parking pass.  I would book this place again in the future.
"
2978929,29833807,2015-04-13,24614050,Ashley,"The apartment was perfect for my needs - comfortable, aesthetically pleasing, and close to downtown. I walked everywhere! Sarah was very communicative and helpful leading up to and during my stay. I had a little trouble with the wifi connection on my laptop (even when I reset the router) so mostly used my phone. Would stay again! "
2978929,30448076,2015-04-22,28260593,Melissa,"Sarah was responsive via text. The studio apt was adequate for my stay in Seattle while I attended a conference--it's just a short walk through Freeway Park to the convention center. Typical old building issues (hallway smells, unpredictable hot water) but nothing unexpected. The neighborhood and building were fairly quiet. No complaints here."
2978929,31522071,2015-05-06,5694925,Shiqing,"The studio is beautiful! It was a little hard to find a parking lot at night, but other than that everything was nice! "
2978929,31708165,2015-05-09,8342978,Anthony,Very walkable location.
2978929,33244823,2015-05-26,18643988,Vienna,"Sarah's studio has a great location, which I can basically walk to any tourist attractions. Also, her studio is so pretty and warm. Great trip!"
2978929,33679542,2015-05-31,15246001,Janine,Great apartment in nice old building at central location!
2978929,35290484,2015-06-17,4620725,Michael,"Sarah has a really nice apartment which is the perfect location for exploring Seattle. We really liked the style of the apartment and it felt very homely to us. It was also great to be able to walk to the supermarket and back and cook our own food, such a luxury for us during a long travel period!"
2978929,35556508,2015-06-20,22542265,Allie,I actually booked this delightful little studio for my parents. It was their first time staying in an AirBNB. I was a little worried at first because I was booked to shoot all day on Bainbridge Island and wouldn't be able to pick them up from the airport much less get them settled in the BNB and had only received form letters from the host. The form letters proved to be enough for two non-city folk to get in and out easily. They found the place completely charming and told me to give it a 5 star review! 
2978929,36009358,2015-06-24,19689933,Mirko,"The appartement was really beautiful and you feel that Sarah has put a lot effort in it, especially the decoration. We had everything we needed and the description of everything was as we found it. Location-wise it is not in the heart of Downtown and the places you will visit but everything is within walking distance. But you should be prepared for an uphill walk. The contact with Sarah was very friendly at all time and we also could ask her for recommandations which were very helpful. Her ""Guide Book"" was very detailed and all information could be found in it. As this is an old house you can hear everything including your neighbours outside and above you. Besides this you really need to be patient when locking and un-locking the door as the old lock works in its own way. "
2978929,36292277,2015-06-27,15736596,Bonnie,This apartment was absolutely lovely and in an excellent location. I felt very much at home. 
2978929,37306689,2015-07-06,8058289,Erika,"Sarah's apartment was very well located in a walkable part of town. The touristy bits were close, as were numerous bus stops. Her apartment has tons of charm and was a nice little respite from walking around the city all day. She had an assortment of pots/ pans, which was very useful to us. We only wish we could have stayed longer! "
2978929,38585047,2015-07-17,16130237,Jane,"Sarah's apartment was great. I was in town for a conference at the convention center and chose it due to it's location. It worked out great - 6 min walk each way. Didn't meet Sarah during the trip, she emailed me a handbook with instructions the day before I was set to arrive and that was pretty much the extent of our communication. The only negative about the place is the dreaded lock, mentioned in other reviews, and addressed by Sarah in her handbook. Until I figured out the trick it was super annoying."
2978929,38999510,2015-07-20,12326937,Erin,My fiancé and I absolutely LOVED our stay in Sarah's charming studio. The energy of her home and surrounding area was perfect. We are taking with us much design inspiration and beautiful memories.
2978929,39383795,2015-07-23,28814050,Ziva,"I am sorely disappointed in our stay. I actually called air BNB to ask if my expectations were too high. Having stayed at two other places in Seattle we were beyond thrilled with those, not with Sarah's: 3 eggs and 2 cans of tomato juice in the refrigerator. Very dicey neighborhood while traveling as a lone woman with a child: confrontive drunk as exiting taxi, screaming drunk at night.  Banging on the ceiling most of the night. Nicer area is across the street at the church and west of it. What might help: a list of breakfast and coffee places within a mile. The ones listed nearby didn't serve protein."
2978929,41931545,2015-08-10,31743090,Emilie,"The listing description was accurate. It was close to everything. After a few days of learning the city, we felt more comfortable approaching the apartment from a certain way so we didnt need to walk past some of the homeless people. It was nice to have grocery shopping close, a $5 uber ride when we didnt want to walk up the hills, an inviting space to come home to after exploring the city and a beautiful space to stay! Wifi was easy to hook up to."
2978929,46118056,2015-09-08,30543071,Ryan,"A grat place to stay if visiting Seattle. Sarah has a lovely apartment that makes you feel like you're home. It looks just like the pictures, it's in a great part of town (all of the major sights are walkable - or an awesome monorail ride away) and Sarah gives detailed instructions on how to get into the apartment and make yourself at home. You can tell she cares for this apartment greatly. It's for sure an active living space, but that's also part of what makes it feel like home."
2978929,47692136,2015-09-21,14386344,Christian,"Wunderschöne Wohnung, perfekt für 2. Nahe Downtown. Super Kommunikation, sehr sauber."
2978929,49691726,2015-10-05,15793444,Micah,Great experience in Seattle at Sarah's place. Sarah was super helpful with our questions. The apartment is exactly as depicted in photos. My wife and I give four thumbs up.
2978929,50210188,2015-10-10,5659301,Josh,"Sarah's place was great!  Super cute, well located, and very cozy.  My wife and I spent a couple days working and exploring with this as our home base, and we really enjoyed ourselves.  I especially liked the record player and Tame Impala records in her collection ;-)

We'll definitely check to see if this place is available on our next visit to Seattle.  Highly recommended."
8952253,55135257,2015-11-28,48179373,Sharin,"Great place for a first timer! Huge bang for your buck! Most hotels could not have accommodated us as well as they did. Host was very easy to communicate with and was very clear on expectations. The home looks exactly like the pictures, but the bedroom is bigger than pictured. Great location. Walking distance to the light rail. Very cozy and perfect for my family of four. It's a little drafty at night, but there were space heaters and extra blankets for us. So hospitable that I'd love to stay again in the near future. They really set the bar for any other air bnb we book from now on. "
8952253,57577396,2015-12-27,5475887,Amoris,What a wonderful home. The kitchen is a cooks dream! We loved our stay!
3209633,13941171,2014-06-08,2124982,Michael,We thoroughly enjoyed our 2-night stay in Glyn's private suite. The suite was clean and comfortable. The bed was very comfortable and the private bath and kitchenette were very convenient for us. We especially enjoyed the privacy of our own private entrance and the the wonderful gardens and landscaping on the property. Thank you for hosting us on short notice. 
3209633,15151734,2014-07-03,4590989,Jenny,"We had a wonderful experience in Glyn's Phinney Ridge apartment.  She welcomed us upon arrival and had the apartment set up with not only the basics (plenty of towels, comfy bed) but also breakfast items that kept us going all week!  This was ample space for 2 adults and a toddler with the large closet in the bedroom large enough to slide in a playpen.  The kitchen had a fridge, stove, microwave and toaster oven so we could eat in easily.  

The location is prime for Green Lake, Ballard, and the Phinney Ridge/Ditch area.  It was easy to find parking on the street and just a 10 minute drive to downtown sightseeing."
3209633,15375404,2014-07-07,17530226,Jennifer,"Glyn was very flexible and great at communication. The suite was very comfortable and it was a nice surprise to find fresh fruit and tea available. The back garden area is beautiful! I would definitely recommend staying here. The price is fair, the neighborhood is convenient and the host seems very kind. A wonderful experience for my first time booking through AirBnb!"
3209633,15699013,2014-07-14,10799812,Elliott,"Glyn is a great host, and she really goes out of her way to make sure guests feel welcome and taken care of. 

Her place is a great value for the price (especially if you're looking for a little more room) and I would certainly return. 

I really enjoy the area as well. Phinney Ridge is a safe, quiet neighborhood with a few bars and restaurants nearby, beautiful views of the mountains to the west, and a great park (Green Lake) only a few blocks away. "
3209633,15887550,2014-07-17,9758036,Anna,"From the moment we walked in the door, the whole experience was welcoming and made us feel at home. The space is quiet and in a great residential neighborhood. It's close enough to shops to walk but far enough away that you don't have to deal with the traffic. There is plenty of street parking and it's a safe neighborhood. The space itself is clean and comfortable. And be sure to sit in the beautiful, quiet garden!

Glyn was amazing at communicating with us and making sure we had everything we needed.  She even had my favorite tea and provided some basic necessities to make our first days easy - food in the frig and toiletries in the bathroom. 

We will definitely be staying here again!"
3209633,16212108,2014-07-23,16764204,Andy,"Even though I arrived late into the night, she was present and very welcoming. There was fresh fruit and an assortment of drinks and foods in the fridge on arrival. Everything was very clean and spacious. I especially liked the private entrance: I didn't have to worry about disturbing her.  If I had questions, she was very quick to respond.

Parking is a breeze, and the location is very close to neighborhoods like Ballard, Fremont, and Wallingford. This has been a very pleasant stay."
3209633,16565439,2014-07-29,14233813,Monika,"The private suite at Glyn's house was exactly what my husband and I needed after 2 days of camping in the Olympic National Park! The bed was comfortable, the kitchen was fully stocked, and the shower was hot and amazing! Glyn even left us a bowl of fresh fruit, oatmeal for the morning, a large bottle of orange juice, and a large array of tea which we thoroughly enjoyed! The location was convenient to getting to the Ballard district which had tons of fun bars and restaurants. I would definitely recommend this place to any friends visiting Seattle."
3209633,16991603,2014-08-05,16874302,Ruth,"We had a very enjoyable stay with Glyn.  The rooms were comfortable and immaculate -the backyard was an extra bonus.  Treats left in the kitchen were a nice touch.  For us, the location was perfect - we enjoyed staying in a neighborhood.  Glyn was friendly and accommodating - communication was great.  "
3209633,18549923,2014-08-28,18576065,Bryon,"Glyn has been most welcoming. The neighborhood is beautiful and quiet.  The accommodations  are just right.

I would recommend this suite to anyone.  The hosts are very generous in accommodating my needs."
3209633,18888226,2014-09-02,18448870,Sarah,"Glyn and her husband were very welcoming. The apartment was just perfect for my daughter and I. The bedroom (and whole apartment) is SO quiet and the bed is comfortable so we had a great rest each night. The location is great, short walk to café, park, zoo, pizza, pubs, etc. "
3209633,19221595,2014-09-08,20186382,Tyler,"Glyn was a fantastic host this past weekend. She was very flexible with our itinerary, prompt in all responses and provided helpful tips about our plans for the weekend. The place is in a great location - a couple blocks from the zoo and lots of great biking around too. She had the place stocked with coffee, tea, orange juie and some other great pantry items. The place was exactly as described and Glyn was a pleasure to work with."
3209633,19395471,2014-09-11,12851001,Charity,"What a GEM! I absolutely LOVED staying here. 

Glyn was an incredible host. She checked in with us several times to make sure we had everything we needed. She brought fruit, chocolate, homeade granola (delicious), yogurt, breakfast breads, and ensured the home was filled with pantry staples. 

The mother in law is comfortable and beautiful. Very quiet, very bright and clean. I liked having my private space and separate entrance. The gardens are beautiful as well. 

Definitely recommend!


"
3209633,20903814,2014-10-07,18425826,Bill,"I was greeted by Glyn when I arrived and provided with helpful details about the apartment. It was very nice to have breakfast items stocked in the kitchen. The neighborhood was beautiful with easy access on foot to restaurants, coffee shops, grocery store and a park with a great walking/running path. The area was everything I hoped for and I was not disappointed!
The apartment was very comfortable and I felt like I was in my own home away from home. The separate entrance is  a bonus to this Airbnb.
This is someplace I would be happy to return to should I find myself back in Seattle someday."
3209633,21235239,2014-10-13,1020428,David,"We got to the Green lake area a few hours early and had a nice time walking in the neighborhood. There is so much to see and do in this area: the zoo, and many shops and restaurants. Glyn met us with a smile and provided all the information we needed to get settled. She let us use her detailed map of Seattle that was very helpful. She provided delicious fruit and yogurt for breakfast in our private kitchen."
3209633,21951663,2014-10-27,21043512,Charlotte,"Our hosts made us feel very welcome!  The little apartment was immaculate and comfortable.  Glyn was gracious and generous by having coffee, tea, fruit, muffins, and treats in the kitchen for us which we thoroughly enjoyed.  The  front stairs and the path to the private basement apartment in back of house was very well lit with sensor lights coming on to light your way at night.  And, there was plenty of heat in the apartment too!"
3209633,22433268,2014-11-06,22266355,Mark,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay. Having a full kitchen was a real plus for us and glyn even stocked it with a few essentials. Glyn accommodated our early arrival and checked in with us to make sure we were well taken care of. We had little chance to interact, but  the communication we had was all quite positive.   A very positive experience"
3209633,22631561,2014-11-10,5509357,Dana,Suite is exactly as described- very clean and feels very much like home as soon as you get there. Glyn is a wonderful host! So many little added touches and extras all around the suite were really appreciated! We would definitely stay again here again!
3209633,24425628,2014-12-28,16970164,Patrick,This is a fantastic place and I would highly recommend it to anyone wanting to stay in a relaxed neighborhood with good access to downtown and Ballard.  I will definitely be staying here again when I come back to the area.
3209633,28075562,2015-03-17,21034217,Joe,Our host made us feel welcome and her flat was as represented. It was perfect for us and we hope to return later in the year.
3209633,28683777,2015-03-28,543046,Nadine,"Glyn is a warm and welcoming host.  The bed was quite comfy, and  there were some snacks and fruit ready and waiting when I arrived.  I was always able to find parking right by Glyn's house. She and Bruce provided great advice on nearby restaurants, and they were kind and gracious when I unintentionally interrupted their evening meal.  One sunny afternoon, Glyn pulled a lawn chair out of storage so I could enjoy the peacefulness of their lovely back garden. The place was very quiet and restful.  Very nice stay!"
3209633,29517923,2015-04-08,9293982,James,"Glyn and Robert were wonderful hosts! The apartment was incredible and the neighborhood is amazing and near everything. I cannot recommend this listing highly enough. Glyn and Robert provided everything that we could have possibly needed for our stay. The apartment is separate suit so you have your own space. There are many parks around including Green Lake which are a short drive away. We loved Seattle and this was one of the best vacations we've had, largely because of the location and the privacy afforded by this listing. Stay here!"
3209633,29858970,2015-04-13,29593641,Mary Ann,"Phinney Ridge is truly a charming neighborhood, and I would recommend staying here over any standard hotel. The apartment suite is in the basement of a beautiful home. It's a very clean, basic space, and just perfect for traveling/visiting Seattle if you're looking for a safe place to sleep and a clean place to stay where you can prepare a basic meal.  It's a clean space in a safe, quiet neighborhood. 
Glyn is very warm and gracious, however, we didn't get a lot of opportunity for chit chat because she and her husband had their kids visiting, so they were busy, and we keep to ourselves and were mainly there just to sleep. 
You have to eat at Red Mill Burgers, Zeeks pizza, and of course Starbucks, all a very short walk away. Greenlake is also very close and a wonderful place to get a walk, run, skate, or bike in; you can make a big walk out of it by walking to greenlake from the space and back. 
Plenty of parking, just be aware that people in the neighborhood park very close to cars. 
If you need a basic place to stay, you don't like hotels (especially Seattle has a lot of cruddy ones, most have criminal activity unless you stay downtown Seattle in a 4-5 star), stay here. It's very safe, quiet, centrally located, and will give you an idea of what Seattle is like!  I love the way the recycling techniques are posted on the wall, I'm all about recycling and composting, it was so helpful to have the details posted!
Welcome to Phinney Ridge!"
3209633,32357732,2015-05-17,8177735,Paul,"We used Glyn's place for grandparents who were visiting from out of town.  They loved it!  Quite, comfortable, and close to everything."
3209633,33286336,2015-05-26,32370314,Dee-Hua,"We went to Seattle to visit our daughter and her family.  We are very glad that we found Glyn's Studio near my daughter's place through airbnb.  We truly enjoyed our stay there.  The studio is located in a very nice and quiet residential neighborhood.  It was very clean, neatly organized, decorated with many beautiful quilts Glyn made over the years .  Glyn had provided all necessary items for our stay.  It was very comfortable and cozy place.  Just as Glyn described in the statement about the Studio, there are many good family oriented restaurant within four blocks of the Studio.  Instead of waking up in the morning with traffic noise, one would be entertained by the birds' singing and chirping.  We will definitely stay there again when we visit Seattle next time."
3209633,34569705,2015-06-09,7788209,Madhu,"I enjoyed out stay in Glyn's cozy airbnb in the quite and beautiful Phinney ridge neighborhood. The space is very charming especially the decor with beautiful quilts. This private suite is in the basement of a house and the entry is through a very whimsical backyard full of quaint artifacts. Our 4 year old loved strolling through this lovely little garden and meeting the hostess's lovely (email hidden)e bed in the suite is perhaps a little small for a family of three but the rooms ( bedroom and kitchen/dinning room) felt roomy and comfortable. This was our 3rd visit to Seattle and the first time we thoroughly enjoyed our stay. Thank you Glyn for sharing your beautiful space with us!

"
3209633,36518496,2015-06-29,13522812,Alex,"The host was very responsive and seemed genuinely interested in making our stay at the space as easy and enjoyable as possible.  Glyn provided us with all the information we needed for our stay and any questions we had were answered promptly.  

After we flew in we were a bit tired and were happy to see there was juice, fruit, and other snacks available for us to eat.  The listing was as advertised and there were no surprises when we arrived at the space.  

The neighborhood was quiet but still had plenty to do throughout the day.  There were many bars and restaurants within walking distance of the space which was refreshing when we didn't feel like driving or taking transit.  The neighborhood seemed very welcoming with a lot of friendly people willing to answer any questions we had and give us wonderful recommendations for where to go next."
3209633,37476604,2015-07-07,5354876,Nadama,"Glyn's place was clean, spacious, comfortable cozy and welcoming.  Centrally located and reasonably priced.

We were welcomed with fruit and snacks and the feel like Glyn went the extra mile to make us feel at home."
3209633,37984523,2015-07-12,34071164,Christian,"Glyn was fantastic start to finish.  Instant communication and flexible accommodation.  The unit was just as advertised, very clean and very cozy.  Very comfortable bed. Quaint setting in a great neighborhood, close to a major bus route with a direct line to downtown.   Glyn was extremely considerate and always wiling to offer anything to make our visit more pleasant.  Great value and superb location!  Would not hesitate to book immediately upon our return. 
"
3209633,38433621,2015-07-15,36742349,Ryan,"Suite was exactly as described, extremely clean, and everything I needed was provided (and even more!). My best airbnb stay yet! Highly recommended."
3209633,38633619,2015-07-17,1681601,Karen,"We LOVED our stay in Phinney Ridge. We have stayed in Fremont and also like that area; however, this is our new favorite spot. Our son lives in Fremont and this Phinney Ridge neighborhood is so lovely. We could easily walk to his apartment, this is a very walkable neighborhood. Coming from Houston, this was so refreshing! Nice homes with beautiful gardens. The backyard garden here is lovely, with 2 chairs for sitting and enjoying coffee. We walked to the local grocery store and there are many restaurants nearby. The suite is very private which is a nice feature, you don't feel like you are disturbing anyone. The directions for check in were clear and Glyn was very accommodating as we were arriving late. She gave directions to get the key which were very smooth even though it was after midnight. We checked in easily and had a wonderful night sleep. The space was immaculately clean and there was a nice breakfast treat, yogurt, fresh OJ, butter, jelly, and english muffins for breakfast. So nice, coffee and cream too, even Stevia, my favorite sweetener. The linens were very nice, thick towels and even a few toiletries in case you forgot your toothpaste. We will be looking to book early for our next trip so we can stay here again. Thanks Glyn for being an awesome host! We loved your quilts and the extra touches that made us feel welcome!"
3209633,39572133,2015-07-24,17568341,Jenn,"Glyn was a fantastic host while we were in Seattle! She was able to give us suggestions for local things to see and do as well as suggestions for Portland (which we visited as well). 
The place was adorable, very comfortable, had some snack and breakfast items for us as well as coffee. The neighborhood was so adorable and within very close walking distance to great bars, restaurants, a pie shop and also had convenient access to the bus line.  All in all it was a great experience, I highly recommend Glyn!!!"
3209633,41365489,2015-08-07,5462960,Alan,"This accomodation, in a typical Seattle basement apartment, was very comfortable indeed. We were both pleasantly surprised to enter a cool facility considering the fact that at the time of our arrival Seattle was unseasonably warm. The photos on line do not do complete justice to Glyn’s “Private Suite” since as well as having a kitchen, bedroom and private bathroom we also had a small space between bedroom and bathroom furnished with a couple of chairs and reading lamp. 
I was, in fact, generally impressed with the amount of room we had and the tidyness and cleanliness of the accomodation.  The fridge was stocked with some breakfast material and Glyn was also available to give us some extra coffee supplies - instant in this case. Kitchen cabinet space was generous and reflected the general feeling of spacious surroundings. If we didn’t want to eat in, there were a number of restaurants within easy walking distance. 
I should also mention that my wife enjoyed sitting reading later in the day in the pleasant backyard in a shady location. Access to this backyard garden area was directly outside the private entrance to our rooms.
Parking was always available on the street in front of the house, although visitors without car can easily use Seattle’s excellent public transport system and find themselves within fairly easy walking distance of the property. 
In short, this AirBnB couldn’t have been more to our liking. 
"
3209633,41783867,2015-08-09,36864677,Nancy,We were first time AirBnB guests and we couldn't have had a more wonderful experience. The accommodations were exactly as described...in fact they were even cuter and more comfortable than the pictures showed. Glyn was so welcoming and made such an effort to make sure we had everything we needed; she texted during our stay to inquire how our vacation was going. That impressed me as going above and beyond! I would highly recommend anyone looking for accommodations in Seattle to choose Glyn's home.
3209633,44813102,2015-08-29,40535983,Martha,"The place was lovely, the gardens displayed the owner's quirky humor, and we were welcomed warmly.  We shall certainly return."
3209633,45273958,2015-09-01,38347750,Ben,"We stayed with Glyn for 3 nights, the flat was immaculate, well equipped and very cosy. Lots of lovely extras like orange juice and chocolate made it feel very homely. a fantastic location just outside Ballard, we would definitely recommend a stay here."
3209633,45537186,2015-09-03,5378565,Gary,"My wife and I had a very enjoyable stay in Glyn's downstairs apartment.  The apartment was clean, quiet, and had everything we needed.  The ductwork in the bedroom would require people 6'2"" or taller to duck when entering the room, but that is really a very minor point.  

Glyn is a very hospitable host who immediately made us feel welcome and comfortable in her home.  She provided a variety of food items for a tasty and healthy breakfast, and she recommended several restaurants.  The neighborhood was ideal for walking, with Woodland Park and Green Lake nearby as well as shops, restaurants, and lovely residential streets and homes everywhere.  

Thanks so much, Glyn, for a wonderful stay!

Gary and Maggie Carlton   "
3209633,47244031,2015-09-17,13873949,Sonya,"Lovely accommodations, host, back yard, and neighborhood. Glyn was communicative and easy to be in touch with.  My older aunt and uncle stayed here while I live nearby. I will certainly be suggesting Glyn's place to others in town visiting.  Ed and Lisa loved the cherry juice, fruit and muffins Glyn provided. "
3209633,47510321,2015-09-19,42561346,Daniel,"Glyn made us feel very welcome, right from the start, and she was very kind and understanding! She gave us excellent advice as to where to eat, which buses to take, and places to explore. Glyn's description of the private suite was accurate, and the place was clean and filled with everything we needed for our stay and more. I would highly recommend her service and the location--the neighborhood was quiet and the people were amiable. It was an outstanding trip!"
3209633,48401465,2015-09-26,29959066,Kari,"Glyn is an excellent host and went out of her way to take care of us--so kind and very good at responding to communication. I appreciated the fresh fruit and coffee to start our mornings with. The location was an excellent one for as as we helped our daughter move from MN to Seattle Pacific University--a quick 10 minute card ride away. The neighborhood is great with lots of places to check out, and the nearby zoo is beautiful and a quick walk from the suite. My husband and I are used to a queen bed--but survived comfortably on the double. I expect we'll be back several times over the next four years while my daughter is in college. :)"
3209633,48766373,2015-09-28,43473178,Eunice,"Thank you Gluy, we enjoy your cozy room and adorable environment in Greenwood."
3209633,49996395,2015-10-08,1020428,David,This was our second stay in Glyn's charming and comfortable private suite. She welcomed us with some fresh juice and fruit for our breakfast and checked to see if we needed anything for our stay. Her home is on a quiet street but only 2 short blocks from Phinney Avenue which is full of small local restaurants and shopping. Fresh Flours is a great place for coffee and pastries and Ken's is a fine food market. Phinney has great bus service to downtown and connects to the light rail to SEATAC. We enjoyed the quiet space of her home and greenery of her yard and neighborhood. We explored the sites of Seattle for a week and everyday we looked forward to a restful night in her suite. 
3209633,53454424,2015-11-09,39929133,Karyn,"This was my first Airbnb experience and it was perfect!  Accommodation was as described.  Clean, comfortable, cozy. The host - Glyn - very nice and shared info about the neighborhood.  I highly recommend and hope to visit there in the future.
"
3209633,54630660,2015-11-22,8177735,Paul,"Very clean and cozy.  Appreciated the seperate entrance, fruit and coffee, and the great restaraunts and attractions close by. "
3209633,56975632,2015-12-20,18425826,Bill,"What a great place to stay!  Lots of room and nice, quiet space.  Neighborhood was short walk to all kinds of restaurants, bakery, coffee shop and fantastic market nearby.  Glyn was a very gracious and welcoming host.  Especially nice touch with fruit, yogurt & english muffins set aside for breakfast in the kitchen.  Looking forward to staying there again soon.  My wife had stayed there on a previous trip to Seattle and felt exactly the same way I do.  5 STARS!!!"
8054892,51499357,2015-10-20,13568362,Christopher,"Fantastic Airbnb experience.  Great location, but please do understand this is an urban dwelling, there are city noises.  Fantastically decorated  and very comfortable.  Will visit again!"
8054892,55842648,2015-12-06,27712194,Patrick,Awesome location! Apartment looks just like pictures! There are tvs in all rooms :)
8054892,56382979,2015-12-13,14734786,Anish,Great stay. Smooth check-in and check-out. Hosts were very flexible in regards to checkin/checkout time. Amazing location! Overall a great experience.
4996554,25620872,2015-01-20,21465532,Hop Alex,"L is a great host. He put out snacks for us and even left new toothbrushes for us to use! Little things we didn't expected, but they were welcomed."
4996554,31770123,2015-05-10,27624120,Jon,"I used this house as a jumping off point transplanting from Kansas City to Seattle.  L met me at the house and I was treated to a clean, modest home to stay in.  Things like bottled waters, a sample of fresh fruits, and toothbrushes etc, were provided as well.  The washer/dryer, oven, microwave all worked fine.  It helps that L is a cool guy who not only took me out to dinner one night, but drove too!  It was a good chance to see what is around the West Seattle area.  

Not knowing the area, I soon found many things to do nearby and grew fond of the West Seattle atmosphere, it felt very ""neighborhoody"".  California Way is a great place street for a late night happy hour specials and there is a psychic barber to visit should you need one of those.  If I got bored of the area, it was easy to hop on the nearby 21 bus and ride into downtown and act like a tourist. 

My only complaint was the xfinity wifi service was subpar at best.  It dropped connectivity for days at a time.  If you pay money for that service, L, it is certainly not worth it!  I usually went to the library across the street if I needed reliable access.  

Overall you can book knowing that this house is a fine, modest place to stay with everything necessary to live a normal life if you stay for a week or a month! "
4996554,32298672,2015-05-16,2538910,Kelley,L's place was great and allowed us to explore West Seattle on foot. Great location close to all the bars and restaurants on California and a nice walk to Alki beach as well. The house was nice and clean with everything one might need for a comfortable stay. L got back to us very quickly upon booking and met us at the house right on time.
4996554,34459892,2015-06-08,5493121,Kim,"I rented this home for my sister's family so did not stay there myself. I did stop by a couple times and found the house extremely charming and cozy. It sits on a corner hill that allows light to stream in at almost every angle. With the surrounding trees it felt really private and had a good sized back yard -good vibes. The inside is modest, but the neighborhood is super cute and a good 30 minute stroll to the beach. 

I never met L but I found him to be really nice and considerate. Humorous too! I'd definitely stay here if I ever I wanted a stay-cation. Thanks L!"
4996554,35089107,2015-06-15,148419,Yu Jeng,"Great location and value for the price! Near the bus station and walgreens. L was quick to respond to my problems and was very accomodating. The listing did say off street parking but L is renting out the garage area so there were no off street parking available. But finding street parking right in front of the house was no problem. For the price and the available space (2 bedrooms,  1 bath, living room,  kitchen & dining  area) this listing is a catch! Safe and quiet neighborhood. The wifi didn't work for the duration of our stay (8 days),  I hope L fixed it by now."
4996554,36764535,2015-07-01,29691932,Tiny," Truly a great value for west Seattle.  Available parking major Plus. Great location, minutes from ferry to Vashon Island minutes from the water taxi to Downtown, and the pikes market.  Amazing for the Price 2 bedrooms 1 bathroom and a kitchen.  Great for my 8 day stay.  I never met the host but he was always quick to respond if I had questions.  Has ceiling fans that were much needed for the 90 degree plus weather Seattle was experiencing.   Wifi was spotty, but there.  Alot of stairs to get into the front of the house, but I assume you may be able to enter from the back that has a ramp.  Close to 35th, but super quite. Property is a bit dated, but i would book again."
4996554,42452495,2015-08-13,3781211,Cheryl,"Great location in West Seattle.  House is located  on a quiet street with plenty of on street parking off of 35th Ave SW, which is the main ave that goes through West Seattle from the West Seattle Bridge. Walgreens is close by and its just a short drive to the West Seattle Junction which has lots of great restaurants, retail and grocery stores.   
 I will plan to stay here again the next time I visit Seattle"
4996554,42864685,2015-08-16,13282498,Lanting,L's home in West Seattle is perfect for our family. The beds were very comfortable. The home is roomy and we have all the space we needed and it felt like our home when we stayed there. The yard was kept clean. The communication was great. Easy access.  All over all it is a great experience staying at L's space. 
4996554,43922114,2015-08-23,34004035,Tara,"L accepted our request immediately so we knew we had a place and could stop looking. Our host L offered to give us any ideas for activities for our stay in Seattle and emailed immediately if I emailed him. He gave us the lock box combo on the day of check in and everything went well. The listing was accurate and the price was great for a Seattle stay. We were able to travel with our car very easily from this house. Parking on the street for 2 cars. The property was just what we needed as we were not there for long durations during the day. The beds were very comfortable and we had a good night sleep every night after long days. Everything was very organized and clean. We liked the closets and benches in the rooms to help with storage while we were there. Washer and dryer on the property was convienient. The house is in a quiet residential neighborhood. The back of the house does back commercial properties, but no traffic and minimal noise. If you need a rental car there is an Enterprise right behind the house. "
4996554,45410464,2015-09-02,2842813,Kirk,"L made me feel very welcome, gave some great tips for restaurants, and the place was just as advertised - clean, comfortable, nice neighborhood."
4996554,46377636,2015-09-10,12902901,Aaron,"My family stayed at this house over Labor Day weekend, 2 adults and 2 children. The house was the perfect size, simply furnished and nearly baby-proof. 

The location was convenient to everything that we had planned. There was a quaint, suburban downtown close by. Belltown and Downtown Seattle are less than 15 minutes away. 

The property would have been perfect if it was equipped with dressers for the bedrooms, and a few more items in the kitchen, especially a coffee maker. Having the washer and dryer was essential for our stay.

L was readily available for questions and local suggestions, adding to our fantastic weekend. I highly recommend this Airbnb."
4996554,47580813,2015-09-20,40161797,Juana,"Nice house,comfortable, L was very nice accepted our reservation right away. Everything was good."
4996554,54832792,2015-11-23,48916897,Lin,"L responded our questions very prompt, about where to buy good seafood, good supermarket etc. house was good almost with every thing you need. "
3143175,14204880,2014-06-14,2832731,Michael,"If Fremont is the Center of the Universe and the Fremont Troll is the center of the Center of the Universe, then Shawn's place is just three doors down. Microbreweries, a chocolate factory, art galleries, boutiques and coffee shops are just a block away. The Burke-Gilman trail is just down the hill, perfect for running and biking. The place comes with a canoe that we decided not to use because there were so many sailboats on the lake.

We never met Shawn, but his place reflected his unique and eclectic tastes. It was comfortable and clean with a sunny deck that overlooks the canal--perfect for sipping our morning coffee. We did not need a car because it was so centrally located to the Fremont waterfront. "
3143175,14705353,2014-06-24,3156246,Sarah,"Super cute neighborhood and house. Deck is a wonderful work space. Very cozy, Shawn was great to work with. "
3143175,14839371,2014-06-27,16907340,James,Great location and excellent accommodations. I felt right at home. Easy walk to Fremont shops and restaurants and convenient to downtown. I highly recommend you stay at Shawn's place. He was an excellent host...responsive and helpful! 
3143175,14941642,2014-06-29,16999114,Jacky,"Such a pleasure to discover the wonderful city of Seattle from Shawn's house and the lovely Fremont neighborhood. You will enjoy the view from the terrace, especially at night, I don't say more... Everything You need Is there, a comfy bed, a lovely living room with many books, the kitchen is open on the livingroom, and the bathroom is equipped with a bathtub. And the personnal decoration will tell You more about your host and give personnality to the house.
The house is two streets away from the heart of Fremont, You will enjoy its many restaurants and shops (and its bus stop to downtown). Opposite to Fremont's center, you will walk to marinas (and a Great place to enjoy a cocktail or a glass of wine around a fire, seeing the Sunset on downtown...).   Thank You again Shawn, we really enjoyed our stay at tour place, so lovely !
(I'm french, my english is quite bad but I hope You understood That I highly recommand Shawn's house...)"
3143175,15059132,2014-07-01,3370843,Maxwell,"Troll's Fremont Farmhouse is a great place to stay in the Fremont neighborhood. While the house itself is located on a quiet side street near the Fremont Troll (google it if you're unfamiliar), it's a very short walk from coffeeshops, restaurants and bars. The deck is perfect for grilling and relaxing after a long day exploring Seattle. I can also confirm the mattress pads Shawn refers to are adequate for sleeping, if you need additional places to sleep. "
3143175,15163458,2014-07-03,4145896,Peter,"Shawns place is really cool! Nice neighbourhood to start loving Seattle! The house has a nice vintage atmosphere and the terrace is great! And Shawn, thanks for the coffee! "
3143175,15692156,2014-07-14,2471697,Norma,"What a great little place!  Since the weather was quite warm for Seattle, I enjoyed a lot of time on the deck which is exactly as pictured. It even has a water view.  I could watch boat in the canal.  
Being close to all of the happenings in Fremont was highly desirable.
The bed was comfortable, I slept great.  The fan in the window quickly cooled off the apartment during the warm evenings.
Shawn's communication prior to arrival was perfect.
Overall, a very comfortable stay. Yep, I will stay again."
3143175,15919517,2014-07-18,1482503,Misty,"The Host, Shawn, and his Daughter were both very accommodating. The place was exactly what I expected, simple but unique. Very easy to enter and felt very safe in the Fremont Area. 

However, the weather was not in our favor! And no, it wasnt rain... it was HOT! We hit a Seattle heat weave... We must have brought it with us from Texas. We needed additional fans and they were delivered ASAP. One we got the place cooled off, it was perfect!

The view from the back patio deck is simply amazing. No photo will give it the right justice at sunrise or sunset. 

""The location"" - It was ideal for our travels. Centrally located to all great things to do in Seattle. Fremont is a wonderful area and it is easy to access the other great Neighborhoods of (website hidden): Queen Anne, Ballard and Downtown. 

Finally, the hidden gem of Fremont is the -Fremont Brewery- This place is AWESOME! I loved it!!  Just a casual walk down hill to some friendly Fremont Locals and delicious beer.

Troll house, I will be back! "
3143175,16208394,2014-07-23,9506370,David,"My friends and I stayed here over a weekend, using it as a home base while we attended a nearby convention for most of the day. All 3 of us slept very comfortably each night. The space inside is used efficiently, allowing us to hang out comfortably in the living room. We were fortunate to visit in good weather and were able to utilize the deck out back, which has an awesome view of Seattle and it great to kick back on during the day. Keypad entry made it very convenient for all of us to get in and out without the hassle of key exchanges.

There were restaurants and a grocery store only a few blocks away, making it easy to stock up on food without needing a car. The neighborhood is quiet and well within range of ride sharing services such as Lyft and Uber.

Overall we were extremely satisfied with the rental and would be happy to rent this location again if we came to Seattle."
3143175,16612781,2014-07-30,482303,Stacy,"We were so happy at the Troll house! I liked how easy it was to check in. Shawn was super easy to communicate with by email but when we arrived late at night after a delayed flight, it was great just to have a code to get in and settle on our own. The place is simple and unrenovated and exactly the kind of old school 70s style Seattle I was looking for on my nostalgic visit to my old home town! The bed is unusually comfortable, the kitchen was great to make breakfast in, there were plenty of towels and sheets and good water pressure in the shower. The view and deck are cooler than the photos  do justice to. I was really happy with the choice to stay in Fremont as a tourist also. Its very central, close to everything and easy to walk to restuarants and bars and stores, but it is also quiet, easy to park and uncrowded. Neighborhood highlights: walking the Burke-Gilman Trail along the canal, Gas Works park, the fantastic health food store PCC, Lucky's where we had vietnamese sandwiches every day, gelato at Sirene and having so many restuarants to choose from. We rented a car, but you could easily vacation here without one. "
3143175,16849429,2014-08-03,13584908,Peggy,"Great spot in a wonderful neighborhood. The space is large, airy, clean and charming. Great City views.  "
3143175,17694633,2014-08-16,18058182,Louise,Great location with excellent view! Real Seattle 'living' experience in a terrific neighborhood. Host was away during our stay but established communication and was available to answer questions.  One creeky floor board marked with Namaste sticker. Wonderful library of yoga books! Would have been total perfection if there had been coffee to make. :-)
3143175,17877462,2014-08-18,16710267,Neil,"We had our wedding this weekend and stayed here as our refuge from home. What a great idea! It was beautiful, comfortable, and what a view! We would recommend it again any time."
3143175,18130033,2014-08-22,3578470,Hannah,"Several days after returning home, I am still missing the troll's house.  It was a lovely spot.  Even though the bedroom is very nice, I couldn't resist sleeping on the pads next to the window-such a nice breeze.  Sean was easy to communicate with when we had a problem with the shower.  Location is excellent, if you're in reasonably good shape and don't mind the bus, there's no need for a car.  "
3143175,18881984,2014-09-02,17473151,Gary,"Loved the Troll House!  It was exactly as described.  The owner, Shawn was charming and a great communicator.  I was in Seattle to drop off my daughter for College at Cornish and the house was in a fantastic, convenient location.  Only 3 miles to the college, walking distance to the interesting Fremont downtown with it's quirky shops and good restaurants.  I did not have any problems with the accommodations but I am sure if I did, Shawn would have be quick to resolve them.  Shawn even had his daughter drop off some great coffee after finding out we were out.  Now that's service!  I wholeheartedly recommend the Troll House to anyone wanting to experience a non-touristy Seattle."
3143175,19275725,2014-09-09,369829,Pamela,"We loved our stay at the Troll's Fremont Farmhouse. The neighborhood is very old-school Seattle--a little funky, a little hip, and very charming. We walked everywhere or took the bus, which was very convenient. You do have to be prepared for hills and stairs! The highlight of the Farmhouse was definitely the deck, where we enjoyed morning coffee and evening sunsets. We were very comfortable and found it super easy to communicate with Shawn."
3143175,19441114,2014-09-12,20950324,Sean,Great stay.  Cozy and clean space with great bridge views. 
3143175,19611594,2014-09-15,6927108,Renae,"The Troll House was just as described! Such a lovely space in a fun, funky Seattle neighborhood. My husband and I rented a car, and never had an issue with parking. Shawn was very communicative before, during, and after our stay. We never needed a thing while we were there, enjoyed walking around Fremont, and relaxing at the Troll House after long days exploring Seattle. Thanks Shawn!"
3143175,20098264,2014-09-23,20182301,Ray,Our experience was  positive.  Loved the location.  Back deck was a favorite spot for us.
3143175,20441267,2014-09-29,20855292,Tyler,"We had a great time at the Troll's Fremont Farmhouse!  Shawn's place has tons of character and is very clean and inviting.  It is perfectly located in Seattle with easy access to downtown, Queen Anne, Ballard and Capitol Hill.  Definitely take a walk down to Gas Works Park and Milstead Coffee, one of my favorites.  

Shawn was a great host, everything was as expected and I love the door combo lock - it made checking in and out very easy.  "
3143175,20911074,2014-10-07,3868674,Rachelq,"Fantastic apartment, great deck, great location. We loved it!"
3143175,21393041,2014-10-16,1185749,Justin,"Shawn's place was great for my trip. Just as described. The view from his deck is stunning - have to see in person to appreciate. Shawn and his daughter were wonderful as well. Super friendly, helpful and flexible. Couldn't have asked for anything more. Highly recommend. "
3143175,21671896,2014-10-21,4948961,Casey,"The troll house was the perfect place to come back to after a long day of wandering around Seattle and hiking in the North Cascades. The views on the deck were incredible-- I spent hours outside at night playing his classical guitar and taking in the skyline. The house is in walking distance to lots of shops and restaurants on Fremont, as well as buses that go downtown. Couldn't imagine a better first time in Seattle-- I felt right at home. "
3143175,21843642,2014-10-25,1307110,Jennifer,"We arrived at Troll's Farmhouse a bit travel weary and sick with a cold... but once we settled in to the magical neighborhood that evening, we were excited about the options for further exploring... The Farmhouse itself was as described and very easy to access - quirky and unique - no frills, but very well situated. We explored a lot of what the neighborhood had to offer (highly recommend Cafe Turko - the food and staff are wonderful!) and were able to zip downtown or to the Zoo or Aquarium with ease. The host provided a parking pass which was great and we were always able to find a parking space in front of the house. "
3143175,22680842,2014-11-11,23273818,Stephanie,"Shawn was a joy to work with, and his lovely home was a delight to stay at.  We will happily stay here again the next time we are in Seattle.  Thanks Shawn! "
3143175,23300943,2014-11-28,23378761,Brian,The location of the troll house is fantastic. There is just so much stuff to do within an easy walk. Shawn and crew were very helpful and responded within minutes when we had a slight mix-up with the door lock. The house was very cozy and I enjoyed Shawn's taste in decor. One thing to keep in mind with the troll house is that there are some quirks associated with its vintage charm. Namely the door to the bathroom which is a little short for my tall self. I learned quickly though. I would definitely stay there again next time we are in Seattle. 
3143175,24794204,2015-01-02,25270231,Anna Liisa,"My first experience with air bnb and it was exceptional. The spot was really cool, good layout, clean, everything we needed and with charm. Also a great price. Very glad we didn't spend the same amount on some crappy hotel. Definitely will do air bnb again. The troll house would be really fun in the summer too!"
3143175,25606056,2015-01-20,25399639,Brandy,"We had a great stay at the Troll House! The house was cozy and had all the amenities that we needed. It is also in a great location. We didn't need to rent a car, we just bought an Orca pass and used all of Seattle's great transportation options. Shawn was wonderful to work with. He was very responsive and made sure our trip was going well. We will definitely stay here on our next trip back!"
3143175,26213773,2015-02-07,25648763,Brent,"Fantastic, trouble free, and welcoming. The location is amazing; make sure to have tea on the balcony. It's easy to walk or take the bus downtown."
3143175,26620568,2015-02-16,26603197,Glen,"This place was fantastic! The view off the porch was beautiful and the neighborhood felt like home. We hope to stay there again as it was only a 5min walk to my son's house.  by the way, the Troll was very cool!"
3143175,26832019,2015-02-20,1121140,Anjali Andrea,"Shawn's wonderful place in the Fremont neighborhood delighted us from the moment we walked up the front steps. An archery flag billowed in the wind and a rustic chair was perched next to an antique frog. Once inside, the stairway led up to a converted attic that charms and welcomes. The view from the deck included the Seattle skyline, the Fremont bridge and Lake Union. Same view from the cozy living room. Our bedroom was finished with antiques and a comfortable queen bed. The pillows and linens were soft and stylish. (One glitch was taken care of swiftly and to our satisfaction by Shawn; the housekeeper hadn't arrived yet so the bed hadn't been changed. Shawm was apologetic and made things right by offering a credit to change our own sheets with clean linens that were easily accessible. These things happen and to no fault of the owner.) Shawn provided delicious Kalani French Roast coffee and a Krups coffee maker. Pots, pans, dishes and cooks ... all we needed to cook and serve (including olive oil and spices) were provided. We loved the clawfoot tub and the water pressure in the shower was perfect. The baseboard heaters provided just the right amount of heat. We visited in the winter and it was nice to come indoors from the crisp weather to a toasty house. I can't wait to visit again and will definitely stay in the Troll house!"
3143175,27235590,2015-02-28,28226652,Amanda,"The Troll house was wonderful, better than expected.  My friend and I had coffee on the deck and loved the beautiful view. Neighborhood was perfect and walking distance to anything we needed.  There was a little trouble when we tried to check in and the code didn't work.  This wasn't a problem though because Shawn got back to us very quickly and the staff at air B&B was very helpful.  We were able to get in with no trouble after a few phone calls.  We hope to stay here again in the future."
3143175,27418913,2015-03-03,11607027,Kyle,"Shawn's place is awesome.  Great cozy little space, in a great location, with plenty to do in and around the house.  He's got a guitar, plenty of books, and a projection system if you get bored at home.  A canoe if you want to see Lake Union in a unique way (very cool) and there's plenty to do in Fremont just outside the door.  I recommend using Uber to get around Fremont if you're an east coaster like me that's used to cabs being everywhere.  

Only downside to this place is no W/D, so extended stays might not be feasible, but Shawn was responsive and a great host so even that is hard to hold against this place--great views and the homey setting made this a great option for us. Thanks!"
3143175,27452961,2015-03-04,11607027,Kyle,"Awesome place, great neighborhood, responsive host... Couldn't ask for more. "
3143175,28233208,2015-03-20,24882622,Sean,"Book this space! Everything worked out perfectly here. There was no key to worry about since the door lock is a simple code. The space itself is very comfortable and feels almost too natural as soon as you walk in the door. A quality I really admired. Kitchen, bedroom, living area + desk and digital projector, were all better than was expected. The back porch was insane. I used to live in the neighborhood and this is what a lot of people come here hoping for. Perfect.
The only drawback is the height of the bathroom door. If you're over 6' then always remember to DUCK before you enter. And if one crack on the head doesn't remind you, hopefully the second or third will. I'm 6'3'' and I smacked my forehead twice that I'll admit to.
All in all a really wonderful space. Highly recommended!"
3143175,30875049,2015-04-28,28781539,Laura Stevens,"Everything was very well explained by the host before arrival.  Thanks to his great planning and preparation, everything went smoothly.  Neighbors were friendly and we were close to various restaurants, the river canal boulevard, local foods co-op, Fremont brewery, yoga studio, all within walking distance!
"
3143175,31076216,2015-05-01,30311152,Radu,"Great homey place, you'll love it!

Location is fantastic, bed is very comfy, it's quiet, deck is amazing, and Shawn is extremely helpful and responsive."
3143175,31544331,2015-05-06,7861764,Peter,"Shawn was very accommodating and the rental experience was very smooth.  The door code is very convenient, especially since I arrived late at night.  The apartment is comfortable and very conveniently located.  I just wanted to take it easy in the evenings here, and the projector and sound system were great.  Bed was quite comfortable and I slept very well.  The house got a bit chilly after dark; there are heaters but I didn't bother, just wore my sweater and it wasn't a problem."
3143175,32703141,2015-05-20,2648488,Jessica,"Great place in a fun neighborhood, close to bus routes, shops and grocery stores. Great deck view.  Would stay here again. Excellent communication with the host. "
3143175,33031014,2015-05-24,33404708,Steve,"We were made to feel very welcome at the Troll House. We did not cross paths with Shawn or his assistant, however, they both made it very clear that we could call them about any issues and they would address them ASAP. That was perfect for us, as we really wanted to just lay low and relax. Entry was provided via an electric code box and it worked just like it should. The house really does feel like a secret hideaway above the neighborhood. Lots of windows, great views, incredible deck, and very comfortable furnishings. The Troll House is centrally located in the Fremont neighborhood. We were able to walk to restaraunts, cafes, and parks, and there are frequent service bus lines extremely close by which took us directly downtown. Also we were able to bring our bicycles into the entryway of the house which alleviated any concerns we had about leaving them outside. I think it's worth noting that we were able to easily travel to Seattle, and stay in this house, without using a car. We rode AmTrak into King Street Station. Despite this being our first visit, we found it very easy to navigate from downtown into Fremont on our bicycles. While this involves a couple of big hills, Seattle has invested in some very nice bicycle infrastructure which really made it feel easy, relaxing and safe to pedal around. "
3143175,34090991,2015-06-04,6572541,Jim,Really neat place.  Host was very polite and communicative. 
3143175,35204807,2015-06-16,13972986,Ellen,Shawn and Becky were very responsive and helpful. Excellent location. Thank you.
3143175,35786630,2015-06-22,5434997,Ben,"Shawn and Becky provided a wonderful base for our Father's Day weekend in Seattle. My dad and I had a great time in the house, soaking up the wonderful views of downtown and Lake Union from the terrific deck! And what a fun bonus the canoe was on a sunny day, another great advantage of booking an Airbnb over a hotel!"
3143175,36303371,2015-06-27,26806259,Marshall,Great place to stay. Loved the deck. Walking distance to a lot of good stuff.
3143175,38841232,2015-07-19,32970414,Teresa,"This place is really fantastic, especially the deck. It was clean, welcoming, slightly quirky (in a good way), and in a prime location to explore the Fremont/Wallingford area. After a few days we felt like Seattle natives.

The photos on the site are a perfect representation of what you will find when you arrive. I had the opportunity of meeting the host, Shawn, and found him to be just as warm an wonderful as his home.

I would highly recommend! Make sure to have your morning and evening beverage on the deck."
3143175,39932490,2015-07-27,36955,Silvia,"Shawn's place has a lot of character and a stunning view! The deck is really cool! Parking in easy and he has a parking permit that guests can use. Appliances are old ( like the stove which is from the 1930s) but they have a lot of character and work well. The location is nice, by the troll and not far from Freemont's market, restaurants, etc. The place is the ideal size  for 2 or 3 people, though we had 5 and it worked just fine with a little spirit of adaptation ! Overall, a very good experience for a reasonable price ! "
3143175,40203191,2015-07-29,30743726,Josh,"What a great little place! Beautifully decorated, warm and cozy. It was wonderful lounging on the private deck with the beautiful view and whenever we felt like going out it was walking distance to just about everything you could want: book store, record store, bars and food. We'll definitely be back!"
3143175,40540103,2015-07-31,39760543,Michael,Shawn was super accommodating in granting our same-day request to stay at his place!  We stayed 2 nights with our 2 boys and it was a perfect fit for our family of four.  The apartment has a great view and is in a prime location to walk around downtown Fremont.  It is also is super close to access the Burke/Gilman trail.  I highly recommend this place! 
3143175,42252577,2015-08-12,30424140,Jorge Arturo,"Seattle is a beautiful city, and Shaun's got quite a nice place to stay, a block away from the troll below the bridge, close to many attractions, the seattle center is close which was important for us, I would totally recommend this place for anyone"
3143175,43755885,2015-08-22,16852058,Ginger,Our family of four had a great time staying at Shawn's place!  It was very quiet and cozy. We loved walking into Fremont and early morning visits to the Troll before tourist time.  The deck was also a great highlight.  
3143175,45926449,2015-09-07,31614537,Michael,Shawn's house is a great place to stay if your are visiting Seattle.  Shawn does a great job making sure that you have what you need while visiting.  I would have to say my favorite aspect of Shawn's place is the view from the deck and living room.  His home has a lot of interesting decorations and is very conformable to stay at.  Shawn's home is a few houses away from the Troll Bridge so finding your way back is always easy.  This also means that there are a lot of fun things to do within walking distance.  
3143175,46615095,2015-09-12,3120199,Ken,"Great location, views and fun place to stay for those willing to accommodate a funky, smaller space.  Host was willing to be flexible on arrival time and we loved sitting on the deck watching the changing scenes on the water and Seattle skyline."
3143175,47047037,2015-09-15,13322597,Betsy,"Trolls Fremont Farmhouse is a funky and fun spot close to many things that my husband, daughter, and son in law were able to take advantage of. We used the vintage 1935 gas stove to heat our pastries which was well explained and easier than we thought.  The beds were reasonably comfortable. We used all including the futon and the mattresses and slept well. We used the deck in both sunny and damp weather.  It really made tight quarters for 4 adults work well. The shower, which was in the cast iron bathtub was great pressure and temp. We had a little trouble getting in initially, but with a phone call to Shawn got that straightened out. A memorable visit to Fremont!"
7773851,44034770,2015-08-23,18308491,John,"Great little place in a safe, quiet area. Close to amenities and 10 mins from downtown. Jason was a great host, good communication / instructions and very helpful. Would recommend this place to anyone wanting a getaway slightly out of the city to relax!"
7773851,46203875,2015-09-08,10128656,Alana,"Jason and April set up an adorable welcome for us with a printed list of helpful tips on the house, neighborhood restaurant recommendations, and wine and chocolate! Oh, and tulips! The neighborhood is adorably quiet, but within walking distance to cute shops, a record store, restaurants and PCC grocery store. West Seattle is about a $12-15 Lyft ride from downtown, so it wasn't too far visiting other neighborhoods as well."
4137114,21063189,2014-10-10,21444117,Dj,"The apartment was super centrally located to walk up and down Pike and access shopping, restaurants, and bars! I booked super last minute in evening and hosts were super accommodating and on it. The apartment was very clean and comfortable. The building is slightly older than I expected but the apartment is very comfortable. Only issue here was parking as I had a car and there is no reserved parking for the unit so I would have to do some juggling to have my car parked somewhere a few blocks nearby jn a parade which can cost 25-35 extra a day/night or free on the street at night which was fine for a few days and they were very clear and open about in advance which helped me plan how to deal with the parking as guess lots of places downtown don't have parking with the rental units.I would definitely recommend and stay here again.  Great hosts and very welcoming! Appreciate the great communication with them."
4137114,21448339,2014-10-17,1370813,Stacy,"This condo is perfect if you're in Seattle for a conference at the convention center! Only a block away from the convention center, close to shops and restaurants, and great for relaxing after a long day of learning. It is exactly as described and photographed, bright and open, clean and modern. The nicely remodeled kitchen is great for cooking, and the living room is quiet and spacious,  which beats a hotel stay hands down!"
4137114,22379019,2014-11-04,22778467,Julian,"Our hosts made us feel extremely welcome from the outset of our trip and even prior to that by taking the time to effectively and promptly communicate with me about the accommodations. I would highly recommend them to anyone wanting credible, helpful hosts."
4137114,22494986,2014-11-08,131703,Rafet,"Awesome stay, unit is located right next to convention center. There are stair you can take as you exit the building that bring you right into the convention hall .  The owners were super responsive and accommodating. Beats any hotel!
  "
4137114,22662955,2014-11-11,6445251,Courtney,"Wonderful experience!  It was such a nice condo, and the location was great.  "
4137114,22911647,2014-11-17,2220041,Lesha,Andre and Joel were great hosts. They were prompt in answering any questions and check in was easy. They even dropped of a baking dish so I could bake in the oven one night. Apartment was clean and very centrally located to downtown and LINK from the airport. I would definitely stay there again. 
4137114,22994104,2014-11-19,9411457,Kelly,"What a great place! Looks exactly as it does in the pictures. It was incredibly clean. The bed was comfortable with cozy pillows and bedding! It's a great location- walking distance to all that we wanted to do (monorail to Seattle Center, Pike's Place Market, Etta's for dinner, walk-by of Seattle Central Library). The parking was a nice perk and the access instructions were easy to follow. "
4137114,23180228,2014-11-24,23611043,Otto,"Such a nice, clean, and large unit! It completely matched the pics and was in a great location for entertainment on Capitol Hill. There was also a good convenience store less than a block away which was very handy. The hosts were also very responsive with any questions. Because parking is so tight on Capitol Hill, I highly recommend their parking option."
4137114,23433703,2014-12-01,21976778,Josh,"Andre and Joel were very helpful and quick to respond. Their place was clean, spacious, and centrally located. It fit our group of 5 comfortably. Overall, it was a great experience and I would definitely book with them again. "
4137114,23788583,2014-12-10,22768799,Erin,Andre and Joel were great hosts. They provided me with a list of things to do and the location is prime. 5 min walk to the convention center and about 10-15 to the market. The apartment was clean and neat and provided all I needed for a week. 
4137114,24052577,2014-12-18,11158026,Kevin,The place was really nice. Walking distance from all the fun in the downtown area and in a safe location. Accommodated all of us reasonably and perfect for us to have a nice breakfast before venturing out. Beautiful home with a nice view.
4137114,24588719,2014-12-31,7877046,Ricci,Nice place. Location  awesome
4137114,24925646,2015-01-04,7512879,Jessica,"Our stay at Andre and Joel's apartment was a good one. They did a great job of providing clear instructions about the apartment and responded in a timely manner to our questions. We appreciated that they accommodated an earlier check-in since our flight had arrived in the morning. They also attended to a small leak caused by the heater and thoughtfully dropped us off an extra space heater for the bedroom.

The location is a convenient walk to attractions and shopping downtown, along with some great restaurants and coffee shops in Capitol Hill. We couldn't have asked for a better location during our stay because it was quite cold and we appreciated being in such close proximity to downtown while still enjoying peace and quiet since the apartment isn't on a major thoroughfare. 

The apartment has clean, modern furnishings and was very spacious for two people. The pictures accurately describe it. It has a well-equipped kitchen, lots of extra towels, a good TV, etc. The only downsides were 1) we struggled a bit with the bed because it felt very springy and too soft for us and 2) the heating system could become quite loud, but it seems possible that issue is related to the water leak they were attending to and will hopefully be fixed.

Overall, a great visit. Thanks, Andre and Joel!

4137114,25202090,2015-01-09,3412019,Sabrina,"Andre and Joel were terrific hosts. They responded very quickly (usually within the hour) to any questions that came up and gave clear instructions on how everything worked in the apartment. They helped us arrange parking for the one day that we had a vehicle which I would recommend since there is very little street parking available for more than a few hours. The location was fantastic - five minute walk to the convention center and so perfect for attending a conference there as I was. The apartment is also a 10-15 walk to Pike's Market, the Monorail and all sorts of great stuff to do downtown. The apartment is as described/pictured and, despite being in a large building, there was no trouble with noise. I would highly recommend staying here over any of the nearby hotels. The place is very spacious for 2 adults, has a fully equipped kitchen and a washer/dryer, and is very reasonably priced given its amenities and location. If I return to the convention center for a conference, I will definitely be pinging Andre and Joel again!"
4137114,25496569,2015-01-18,15070186,Charles,"Best place to stay in Seattle, I highly recommend this unit.

It is walking distance to downtown and about a 10 minute walk to the Pike Place market.

Will stay here again when I go back to Seattle."
4137114,26155098,2015-02-05,24979250,Ian,"Superb location - 5 min walk to downtown or central Capitol hill but tucked away in a quiet street next to Freeway Park. Also close to bus routes and Convention place bus terminal - you rarely need a car for getting anywhere in the city. If you want to explore further afield you can be on the freeway or at the ferry terminals in a few minutes.
The apartment is spacious, clean and tastefully decorated - it struck a nice balance being warmer and more intimate than a typical  hotel room but without the feeling that you were staying in someone's home. Overall well equipped (including good quality kitchen utensils, etc.) - Andre and Joel had obviously paid a lot of attention to practical details and we never really found that the place lacked anything.
The hosts keep out of your way - we never met them face-to-face - but were very friendly and extremely responsive to any of the questions we had.
If you want a great base to explore Seattle you couldn't ask for better place to stay."
4137114,26501010,2015-02-14,8785709,Doug,We had a great stay. Had everything that we needed. Very convenient location right next to the convention center. Only thing that could have been better is the lighting which I thought could have been brighter. Would recommend to others. 
4137114,26735450,2015-02-18,18595378,Brett,"During our first trip to Seattle, it was important for us to find an apartment that was central to all the locations we wanted to visit and activities we had planned. Andre and Joel's apartment suited us perfectly. Just steps to Pike st (a major thoroughfare), Pike Place Market and a number of other attractions were less than a mile west, while less than a mile East is a very cool neighborhood called Capitol Hill; both easily walkable and with tons of shopping and dining options. 

If you've never been to Seattle before, I highly recommend renting a car and driving around to the various neighborhoods, as they are spread out and not easily accessible without transportation. For that reason, I also recommend getting the parking pass that Andre and Joel offer for a small daily fee. The garage is just a few buildings down from the apartment and is open 24 hours. Street parking is very hard to come by in the neighborhood.

The apartment was very clean and cozy, with a full kitchen, comfortable bed, cable, and a washer and dryer en suite. 

Andre and Joel themselves were extremely pleasant and attentive, and any questions I had were met with prompt response. 

Overall, I highly recommend this place, and Seattle in general! "
4137114,27433158,2015-03-04,2213392,Paige,"What a wonderful city Seattle is, and our time spent there was even better because we stayed in Andre and Joel's apartment. It was the right amount of space for myself, my husband and our toddler who LOVES to run around! The light coming in the windows in the morning was so lovely for breakfast everyday. The apartment is so convenient to dozens of restaurants, a short walk from Pike's Market, the Paramount, and the awesome mall area, and it felt so safe and secure. Andre and Joel were very accommodating and their response time to any inquiry was super fast. If we ever find ourselves in Seattle again, this will be our first choice to book! "
4137114,28020325,2015-03-16,26046443,Matthew,This was my first Airbnb experience and it was an outstanding one! Everything that is posted in the listing was accurate and Andre and Joel were most helpful. They thought of every detail and question and provided me with the info upfront. The check in went smooth for an unattended one. The location of this place is within walking distance of all major attractions. Andre and Joel made my first experience an awesome one and I will most definitely use than again!
4137114,28200832,2015-03-20,24781057,Tracy,"As first  time Airbnb users, Andre and Joel did a great job in keeping us well informed on the process with regular messages via both email and text.  Pictures and directions were spot on and you can't beat the location.  Each morning it was a quick trip to Pike's Market for breakfast.  Tons of great resturants and shopping nearby.

Clean, modern, convienient and safe pretty much sums it up.  We will definitely want to use it as our homebase for future trips to the Emerald City."
4137114,28861669,2015-03-31,6689604,Daniel,"A stylish, clean, warm, quiet apartment, a lovely place to come home to after a long day. Andre and Joel are responsive and organised. The position is ideal, between Downtown and a medical and university district which is residential and low-key. I was very happy here."
4137114,29061643,2015-04-03,4509216,Rimas,"Easy, convenient, good location."
4137114,29904703,2015-04-14,3541113,Valerie,We would definitely stay here again.  Fantastic location for any convention center goer.  Gorgeous and simple decor.  Clean and very comfortable.  Communication with the owners was top notch!  We will be back for sure!
4137114,30440332,2015-04-22,14510465,Hillary,Wonderful host and wonderful location! Everything was super quick and easy. The location was perfect and ideal for walking all hours of the day. The apartment was clean and comfortable. I would stay at this listing again! :-)
4137114,31929930,2015-05-12,16915596,Rudy,"I really enjoyed Andre and Joel's place  very convenient to  to the Paramount theatre were i was working at.A fully stocked kitchen , washer dryer, safe and secure. I will stay wit Andre and Joel next time I'm in Seattle for sure!                 Rudy Guerrero"
4137114,33227808,2015-05-26,27590128,Theodore,"Minimal contact with host, only to be let in when the key was unavailable at the designated pick-up site.  The unit was clean and well furnished although spartan.  The bed was excellent.  We would have liked more than the one small rug on the floors.  Although we did not cook, the kitchen was well equipped.

The location is a very big advantage here, and the unit is surprisingly quiet for a downtown location."
4137114,33649213,2015-05-31,27370195,Ivonne,Best place to stay in Seattle! Easy (walking)access to the city centre. Really helpfull hosts. A very warm welcome and very responsive to questions. Spacious condo with everything you need! 
4137114,33980398,2015-06-03,26852878,Nikki,"Location, location, location!  This Apt is not only located downtown, but it is just off of Pike Street.  It was clean and stylish, and wonderfully quiet.  The fully equipt  kitchen was a great benefit, especially in the morning for a relaxed breakfast.  Andre and Joel were not only wonderful hosts, but they went out of their way to make our stay comfortable and easy.  I highly recommend this place and these hosts to everyone!"
4137114,34763851,2015-06-12,24956760,Jonathan,"The apartment was as clean, spacious and aesthetically pleasing as advertised. The master bedroom was perfect for two people and the pullout sofa in the living room was quite comfortable for a third. There are large windows all around the apartment and lots of trees surrounding the building. This gave us shade and the ability to open up the windows to allow cool, fresh air to flow through. The kitchen was modest in size, but equipped with pretty much everything you could need (even a french press!). One of the best things was the location. The apartment is just a few blocks from the convention center, but on a quiet street with almost no traffic. It was a great place to relax after a long day of presentations at the research conference we were attending. Thanks Joel and Andre!"
4137114,35025344,2015-06-14,35095118,Lindsay,"Amazing location! Less than 20 minutes down Pike to the market, and very convenient to restaurants and shops. The parking space was well worth the reasonable $25/day. Apartment is very clean and stylish. The kitchen was wonderful to have, the TV was nice, and the bed was very comfortable. 

Overall, an excellent experience!"
4137114,35364250,2015-06-18,7484291,Amy,Great place to stay if you need to be near the convention center.  Andre and Joel were very responsive hosts and the apartment was just as it was described.  I would definitely stay there again if I had another conference in the area.
4137114,38092214,2015-07-13,22015577,Joanna,"The apartment was really well placed for exploring Seattle with many great places to eat nearby.

It was exactly as listed and super
clean and well organised.

We would definitely return and make it our base for Seattle.

The hosts were easy to contact and very approachable.  Thank you both."
4137114,38479836,2015-07-16,28773786,Bill And Amy,This was a fantastic location and a great experience. I will be back next time i visit Seattle. 
4137114,40072731,2015-07-28,24906385,Taysia,Amazing condo in an excellent location -walkable to everything ! Andre and Joel were very accommodating with all my emails and questions! Getting access to the apartment was so easy! It was the perfect place to stay in seattle.
4137114,41915327,2015-08-10,10280164,Scott,"Andre and Joel were awesome hosts; their communication was prompt, spot-on, and helpful.  The place was very clean and homey.  Great location in Seattle with tons to do within walking distance.  Kitchen had all the tools we needed for cooking at the place, and the air conditioning unit was very nice to have, especially with how hot it was during the week we were there.  Overall a great experience!"
4137114,42506329,2015-08-14,27477277,Dootika,"Excellent apartment! Very convenient location, right in the middle of downtown, and great coffee places nearby. Apartment is of excellent quality. The best part was that people in the living room had privacy due to the curtain partitions. Andre and Joel communicated very well. Perfect experience."
4137114,43899017,2015-08-23,4935287,Patrick,"l'appartement proposé est soigné, chaleureux, moderne et très fonctionnel. La literie est très confortable et l'environnement très calme : repos garanti !
le quartier est commerçant et très sûr, nuit et jour, dynamique : un magnifique Starkucks à deux pas.
Les transports en commun (bus, navette aéroport) sont à quelques minutes à pied et en 10 minutes, vous êtes sur la baie et le Pike Place Market !
L'arrivée et le départ dans l'appartement sont très faciles et très rapides, Joel et André communiquent vite et bien afin que tout soit le plus facile et le plus efficace possible.
C'est un logement que nous recommandons sans réserve !
"
4137114,44159418,2015-08-24,11360550,Sarah,Our overnight stay at the apartment was very convenient as the location is a short stroll to the main areas that new visitors to Seattle would wish to visit. Clean with all the amenities one would like to have to make a comfortable stay. Picking the keys up locally was easy once we had read the instructions and location details. Thanks for all your prompt communications. Would def recommend to others. Sarah 
4137114,45457351,2015-09-03,16792501,Carolina,"The unit (P2) is spacious, comfortable and nicely decorated; it looks exactly like the pictures.
Our group of four was in town for an event at the convention center and a little bit of sightseeing, so the location was unbeatable! We were 2 blocks from the Convention Center, 6 from Westlake Station (so we just took the very inexpensive light rail to and from the airport) and within walking distance -or a very short ride- from most attractions.
Andre & Joel are pros :) They were very attentive and replied to our messages immediately. We didn't meet them in person but there was no need; everything we needed was provided and the check-in/check-out procedure was a breeze.

We had an amazing time in Seattle and would definitely stay at Andre and Joel's place again!"
4137114,45633193,2015-09-04,4497331,Justin,Great little house. Was totally sufficient for our little family
4137114,47960522,2015-09-22,34948905,Audrey,"We arrived late at night and being first time airbnb users, the process was wonderfully smooth. The hosts were accommodating in assisting with the late arrival as it required a change in the normal check in procedure. The condo was very clean and nicely decorated. The bed was so comfortable! The location was perfect as we were just minutes away from the convention center and anything else along Pike. We had no issues and thoroughly enjoyed our time. I would definitely recommend these hosts and their properties. "
4137114,48229124,2015-09-24,23243636,Huimin,Clean and spacious to sleep two. Location is great too. Although I hope cancellation policy can be more flexible. I changed my reservation from two nights to one 23 days before checking. Still was asked to pay second day stay with discount of removing $59 cleaning fee. 
4137114,49763615,2015-10-06,33794983,Oliver,"I recently visited Seattle for the first time with a friend, and our holiday was made so much more enjoyable by being able to stay at this wonderful apartment. While I didn't get to meet Andre and Joel the key pick up and drop off was simple and access to the apartment was straight forward. The apartment had everything we needed to have with all the comforts of home, TV, WiFi, cooking and laundry etc. My bedroom was great, and my colleague was very happy with the sofa bed. 

The location of the apartment was perfect, close to restaurants, shops and transport. We were able to catch the train from the airport and walk to the apartment, and it was also close to the monorail which took us to the Space Needle and other attractions. We walked to downtown and the Pyke Market, and were able catch buses from the station near by also. The apartment is also really close to Paramount Theatre which was great as we saw a local band play there!  

I would highly recommend this apartment to anyone who is visiting Seattle. "
4137114,50437791,2015-10-12,34491792,Kristina,"The listing for the condo was spot on. Clean, comfortable, and in a great, safe location in downtown Seattle. The roof deck was a great way to be outside and in the heart of the city. Andre and Joel were easy to communicate with. Definitely glad I reserved parking due to parking congestion in downtown. If I am ever back in Seattle, I will be staying here. "
4137114,51253007,2015-10-18,14317593,Joe,"Andre and Joel were very responsive to all my inquiries and very prompt about it. Very accommodating. Location was everything and this was nestled right amongst everything and within walking distance to bars, downtown and restaurants. The place was very clean and spacious!! "
4137114,51560600,2015-10-21,45403770,Kristin,"Andre and Joel's unit was exactly as described, right in a prime location for exploring Seattle. Andre and Joel were willing to accommodate any request and had excellent communication. Check-in was a breeze as the key was made available to pick-up/drop-off at our leisure. Thanks for hosting us!"
4137114,51887508,2015-10-25,14274947,Nick,"Thanks to Andre and Joel my stay in Seattle, WA was amazing. This place is ideal to have the ability to walk or to take public transportation to see all the must see's in Seattle.  Me and my fiance were right at home with this Airbnb.  It was very clean and could not have been more perfect. I wish we had more time to be in Seattle. The next time I go back I will be looking to stay at one of their place if not this place again. 

Inside:
This place was exactly as the listing said it would be and more. The apartment had every type of coffee / espresso maker one would need to enjoy all of the local coffee shops. 

Location: 
Near one of a kind Starbucks Reserve - wow is all I can say
Good amount of bars and restaurants all being at a good range  $ --$$$

It is on the edge of lower Capitol Hill, which is like West Hollywood so a clean and friendly place, and also is near the edge of lower South Lake, a few blocks from lower Queen Anne (Space Needle), and on Pike St. that has loads of cool places to shop  and gives the ability to walk right to Pike Place Market.

Before and While staying: 
They were very detailed with the questions
The response time was very quick
While there, if I had an important issue or question they said to call right away no matter what which takes the worries out of the trip "
4137114,52822616,2015-11-02,26308781,Mladen,"Everything was as advertised, location was great, apartment was clean and comfortable. Andre and Joel were very fast and detailed in communication and resolving any questions I had."
4137114,53485931,2015-11-09,1489769,Sarah,"The place was absolutely as expected. Andre and Joel did a great job making everything work for us and was as expected. The place was clean, comfortable and a great location for our event at that conference center. We enjoyed our stay!"
4137114,54246540,2015-11-17,16442523,Janssen,Clean apartment. However not very flexible. Make sure and read all the rules. Any deviation from some of the rules may cost you extra.
4137114,54440806,2015-11-20,5065798,Marie,"Andre and Joel have a great apartment, it is spacious, very comfortable and well appointed.  We were 2 couples and the set-up worked very well.  The neighbourhood is quiet, and we found that the location was just a brisk walk from the things we wanted to do.  There was an issue with the keys that were supposed to be in the apartment, and as we arrived late in the day Joel/Andre remotely let us in  and delivered a set of keys early next day.  Very considerate!  Thanks guys!"
4137114,54554837,2015-11-21,32789200,Kathleen,The parking directions are a bit confusing but it's on the north side of the building not the south. Everything got together in a timely manner when I needed anything. Easy to walk into downtown. We saw a show at the Paramount which was literally across the bridge. Cozy beds and walk away from Capitol Hill as well. Cheap deal for four of us. 
4137114,56893331,2015-12-19,16191769,Yonas,"Place was very clean and prepared for us. I must say though that this apartment is in a very old and not so appealing building. Pictures were accurate but I just pictured something a lot nicer in my mind and was very disappointed once I arrived.  Only thing good about this place is its location (downtown), other than that i would not stay here again. Check in and check out process was very smooth and easy , owners were very helpful."
7843995,43330712,2015-08-18,17032994,Rafael,"I spend 5 fabulous days at Seattle. The apartment has everything you need and the location is perfect, just walk to downtown, restaurants all over the place, supermarkets, etc.

Will repeat!"

My only complaint is that the upstairs neighbors played loud music 2 nights out of my 3 night stay late at night and it kept me up."
7843995,48746934,2015-09-28,973259,Jessey,This listing was accurate and in a great location. James has his game down on check in and all other things one might need. His check in email covers probably 99% of anything you could ever want to know about the property and area. It was easy to get to everywhere we were trying to go via lyft and many of the downtown attractions are in walking distance. There is no shortage of fun to be had within walking distance of this property! 
7843995,49479311,2015-10-04,7173314,Evan,"James is an excellent Air BNB host! He responded quickly to all messages and offered some good tips for getting around Seattle / what neighborhoods to check out. 

The condo itself was in a great location (Capital Hill). It's easy walking distance to downtown, Pike's Place / the sound. Capital Hill itself has a good variety of bars, restaurants, coffee shops (of course).

Thanks James! I would definitely recommend his place to other travelers."
7843995,50012030,2015-10-08,19235033,Billy,James has been incredibly responsive during both of my stays at his places. Both places have been very clean and welcoming and are centrally located to many activities within Seattle. This particular place was nicely tucked away from the street and thus had no street noise. He also provides a lengthy list of restaurant recommendations. Would highly recommend staying at any of James' places
7843995,50369914,2015-10-11,13346664,Jose,James responded quickly to all my questions and provided all the information I needed to get in the Apartment way before the date I need to check in. The place was nice and clean and was the perfect size for a weekend stay in Seattle. 
7843995,50951894,2015-10-16,25370497,Adam,Nice space close to everything Seattle has to offer. Walking distance to downtown but still quiet for a relaxing stay. Capitol Hill is a great neighborhood and James' recommendations on where to eat / what to do are great. Very responsive host.

7843995,52723878,2015-11-01,18251115,Kate,"James was an excellent host. Getting in was no problem at all and he made himself available by text all weekend long for local advice. The location is the best part of James' place. Located right at the bottom of Capital Hill, there are dozens of delicious restaurants and coffee shops within a few blocks. It is also an easy walk to the market and anywhere in downtown. We didn't spend much time in the apartment, but when we did we had everything we needed for nice weekend stay. "
7843995,53124255,2015-11-05,1293873,Arturo,"James had excellent communication, and offered several tips for a great stay in Seattle. The apartment was clean and neat, and located in a very vibrant part of Seattle. I'd recommend this Airbnb to anyone looking for several, local nighttime options in Seattle."
7843995,53264658,2015-11-07,19603634,Marylee,"This apartment is in a great location because it's close to different modes of transportation, there are plenty of places to drink or eat just around the corner especially the Pie Bar. Yumm! All of the tourist attractions are just less than a 10-15 min bus ride away. 
The apartment is safe, clean, and comfortable. It was easy to communicate with James either but phone or text and he was quick to respond. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone wanting to visit and explore downtown Seattle. "

The apartment is clean and tidy and complete with tea/coffee and laundry products which we found to be a nice touch. We would have no hesitation about staying here again next time we're in Seattle.

This was my best airbnb experience; great tips/advice from the host, excellent communication. I'll be looking to see if this listing is available next time I plan a trip to the Pacific Northwest. Thanks so much, James!"
7843995,55850571,2015-12-06,21016816,Atanas,"My wife and I stayed at James's place for 3 days and absolutely loved our time there. James is a terrific host. His communication was outstanding and his recommendations were spot on. The apartment is cozy and ideally located if you want to explore the city by foot. You are within walking distance to downtown, Pike Place Market, and a wealth of trendy restaurants and bars in Capitol Hill. And for coffee lovers, don't miss the Starbucks Reserve roastery a block away! 

Thank you, James, for an awesome Seattle experience!"
7843995,56513002,2015-12-14,26615575,BaDeR,"James he is very good host and he help me for alot of things

7843995,57812845,2015-12-29,48127738,Michael,"Perfect place and just a few minute walk to downtown Seattle. James was very helpful upon check in and everything went smoothly. If you're looking for a place within walking distance, this place is perfect! We didn't need to rent a car and just walked/Uber. James is very helpful especially if you're new to Seattle, he's pretty much our concierge while we stayed there. I highly recommend booking through James and surely will book again in the near future. Thanks James!"
9282409,54472425,2015-11-20,23462109,Anbreen,"This place is magnificent. Really $1M views. I was lucky enough to stay at this beautiful penthouse for a week and I had the best time enjoying the views. The house is super clean which is the cherry on the top! Zac made it feel like home,  his great company and such friendly attitude made me feel ultra comfortable also made me fell in love with Seattle. Zac had some great recommendations for me to see things in the city.
I am defiantly coming back to this same place!  "
9282409,56316471,2015-12-12,969886,Karen,"I would highly recommend staying at Zac's house. It is conveniently located on the southern slope of Queen Anne within close walking distance to Kerry Park and Marshall Park (best views of downtown Seattle and the Olympic mountains). My stay was comfortable and felt luxurious - as you can see from the pics, it's a really nice place! Zac was a great host - helpful and welcoming. The views from the windows were really beautiful displaying the ever changing cloud formations and colors of Seattle's sky and water. When I visit Seattle in the future, I'll look forward to staying in Zac's place again."
9292039,55081912,2015-11-27,47146090,Farracy,"This was a last minute rental the Monday before Thanksgiving. We have stayed in one of Marshall's other rentals and had an A+ experience. This time was no different, Marshall could not have been nicer and more accommodating. The apartment was very clean and had everything we needed!  Would definitely book through Marshall again. "
4165387,30737778,2015-04-26,11053839,Rogier,"Tim is an excellent host. He was very prompt and clear in communications. Very accommodating to a relatively late arrival. 

The place is very nicely furnished. It has great views and conveniently located to everything downtown Seattle. 

Just beware: There's a 40 story apartment tower going up across the street at 2nd Ave and Pine St. The city has given the construction company permission to work night to minimize impact to traffic and commerce downtown. They work from 10:30pm to 5am. We were unfortunate in that the night we stayed, they were pouring concrete and there was a continuous flow of cement trucks maneuvering and dumping their loads. We didn't sleep a minute and ended up packing up and going home at 4am. 

Tim refunded the cost for the night but that doesn't make up for a lost night and a lost visit. This is without doubt a temporary situation but until construction is complete, beware and bring earplugs.
 "
4165387,31270592,2015-05-03,15496982,Todd,"I was really surprised how nice this place was.  The pictures give you some idea, but once inside you realize that this place is as new as it gets.  It's probably a couple years old, but it felt like I was the first person to ever sleep here.  The views are amazing, and it's amazingly quiet given that we're in downtown.  It has a gym that was really handy, and a rooftop hangout space that saved us $42 because the view was every bit as nice as the top of the space needle...maybe even nicer.  

Tim was supercool.  He met me to give me the keys and the parking pass, and instructions for everything.  He was super responsive when I had questions about the wireless, where the gym in the building was, etc.  

I will definitely stay here again in the future.  "
4165387,31858045,2015-05-10,32803106,Daniel,"This is an spectacular place for the money. The bed is one of the most comfortable I've ever slept on in my life. I actually took the sheets off to get the brand and model because I'm soon to be in the market for a new mattress. I looked it up online and it's a premium mattress that costs a few thousand dollars. The entire apartment is high up and is very quiet, almost too quiet, but that's just personal taste. I enjoyed having the kitchen island counter space to work at. I was able to spread out all of my work papers and reports with my laptop and was very productive. The gym has new equipment with very little traffic. The living room was very comfortable with actual cable TV channels so I could keep up with my SportsCenter and the NBA playoffs. The TV has a TiVo box which has access to Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, Hulu, etc., so there's no shortage of entertainment. The couch was super comfy and I used the chaise lounger a couple of times to read and enjoy the view. Speaking of the view, I've never stayed at a place with such a expansive view. The unit is a corner unit, so you get view of the water (just as depicted in the pictures) and a view of the city/Space Needle. It was nice to come home after a long day of back to back to back meetings and chow down on sushi while enjoying the view. The location is also central to so many food and drink establishments. There are restaurants on every street with all sorts of different cuisines. Japonessa is a couple blocks away and is my new favorite sushi joint when I visit Seattle. I walked to the market one morning to get coffee and that was a 2 minute walk.  All in all, an amazing place and I highly recommend for a couple or single traveler coming to Seattle for work or pleasure. The value and comfort is unbeatable. I'll be back!"
4165387,40573174,2015-08-01,31743803,Jill,We had a wonderful experience. The location is unbelievable. So close to amazing restaurant and fun things to do. Views are incredible. The apartment is both chic and comfortable. Michelle was very helpful and easy to work this. I highly recommend this location.
4165387,41363379,2015-08-07,35340072,Annie,"The pictures of this place do not do it justice, it is even more beautiful than depicted! Michelle made us feel really welcome and comfortable.  My mom and I loved our trip to Seattle and Michelle's gracious hospitality made it even more enjoyable. "
4165387,41934907,2015-08-10,28510231,Joseph,"The hosting was accurate, and in a great location for a long Seattle weekend.  It was a plus having the parking spot, since we parked Thursday night and walked the streets all weekend for everything we wanted to do.  Michelle welcomed us when we got in late Thursday, and gave a good tour and overview for the area.  I was very glad we got this rental!  Not only was the view stunning with plenty of natural light through the tall windows, but the tv's were great and when we needed to relax and recharge it was really fun to do.  The gym also was great, we ran and did a quick workout before going out on the town for the day.  Very great experience, definitely hope to do it again next summer."
4165387,42340183,2015-08-12,10570040,Andrew,Michelle was very welcoming and informative and we had the most wonderful stay. The flat is really really nice- decor is extremely comfortable and beautiful. Great for exploring the city as we have 3 young boys and it is in the absolute best location. Michelle thought of everything one would need to be comfortable and feel at right home. Morning coffee and evening BBQs on the rooftop with 360 views of the city and Puget Sound. It was wonderful coming back to such a comfortable place after enjoying the city all day. 
4165387,42517830,2015-08-14,25661536,Leslyn,"The neighborhood and apartment were exactly as described in the listing. The apartment was clean, quiet, and safe and the rooftop deck was absolutely beautiful! We ended up getting take-out pizza (Serious Pie is just a couple blocks away and delicious) and just sitting on the deck all evening. Everything you could possibly need, from food to shopping to sight-seeing was within walking distance from the apartment. Michelle was very quick to respond to my many questions, and remained patient as our arrival times kept changing. We will absolutely be coming back here when we visit Seattle again! "
4165387,43219720,2015-08-18,31603609,John,"The space was absolutely as described, and was a terrific place to stay in downtown Seattle.  The views are fabulous, and we enjoyed our stay very much.  One really great aspect was access to the roof, which this building has clearly put a lot of effort into.
Michelle was a gracious host, arranged for our access and turnover without any problems and was available for our numerous questions via text throughout the entire stay.
If you are looking for a great place to stay near Pikes Place, you have found it!"
4165387,43575284,2015-08-20,1226021,Todd,"Michelle's place is great.   A foodies paradise.  The kitchen is set up with everything you need to prepare a wonderful meal with all of the fresh and delicious foods you can pick up at the Market.   The views from the apartment are stunning, exceeded only by the 360 views from the roof top.   This is at the top of my list for my next trip to downtown Seattle."
4165387,44295086,2015-08-25,1160919,Eran,"Michelle was most accommodating! We needed to get in earlier and Michelle made sure the apartment was cleaned for us. The apartment was incredible! Not only the views, but the quality of the bed, the decor, the furniture and beyond everything the attentiveness for the little details. Michelle made sure we had everything we needed at all times and I could have not expected a better and a nicer apartment / building to stay in. Incredible experience! Thank you guys so much!"
4165387,45367893,2015-09-02,42270891,Robin,It was so much better than expected!  The listing downplays the views... they are breathtaking.  Having a bottle of wine and fresh flowers waiting for us was the best way to start our vacation.  We would stay here again in a heart beat!
4165387,46121648,2015-09-08,30565427,Tony,"Michelle was an amazing host. We were not able to arrive at her place til 1am, however she still able to help us get in and settled. Throughout my whole stay she would check in to make sure we had everything we needed! Not only was Michelle an amazing host, her place was also amazing! Great view, and great kitchen! I would recommend staying at her place instead of any 5 stars hotels!"
4165387,47182158,2015-09-16,41907367,Scott,"Michelle was great to work with. She responded quickly and clearly. She had to leave town for an family emergency but super fun and great sub host was Mollie (thanks Mollie!!).

The apartment was very nice, new, updated, modern with GREAT views! It was very clean and well supplied. The master bed was very nice.

The rooftop deck was VERY VERY nice with great views, indoor and outdoor spaces. No need to pay for space needle.

Location, Location, Location is great one block from Pike Market and close to everything downtown. Would stay again and recommend to anyone."
4165387,47395128,2015-09-18,8268178,Ed,Absolutely amazing space in prime part of downtown. Nothing could be better about Michelle's place! 
4165387,47961323,2015-09-22,5516918,Cathy,We really appreciated the early check in while the apartment was being cleaned.  We were able to leave our bags in the apartment and do a little sight seeing and visiting with family.  The view was amazing both in the apartment and the roof top deck.  The workout room was amazing.  We enjoyed our stay in Seattle and hope to return soon.
4165387,48556523,2015-09-27,20668885,Sarah,"Hands down, my best AirBnB guest experience to date.   The building is beautiful, the apartment was fantastic for me and a colleague in for business.  The Belltown neighborhood is fun to be in and we took advantage of the rooftop, the gym & the friendly doorman!   Michelle is also very beautiful -- it was great hanging out... Love it when hosts and guests become friends!!  Thanks Michelle... It was perfect. "
4165387,49207111,2015-10-02,898176,Aurore & Bruno,"Perfect apartment in a perfect location for exploring downtown Seattle. The decoration of the apartment is very pretty and it's also very well equipped. Very clean.  Michelle waited for us despite our late check-in. Furthermore, you have a breathtaking view of Space Needle from the apartment... and don't forget the rooftop. We were very impressed. It's even better than in pictures ! Very hard to do better !!! If you come in Seattle by car like us, there is a pay parking very close to the building."
4165387,51062696,2015-10-17,10042488,Wyatt,"The apartment is as described and a colleague and I had a great stay. Good location near Pike Market and a bunch of bars, coffee shops, restaurants in the area, and the view from the apartment is a big draw."
4165387,51269055,2015-10-19,2650789,Erica,"We just had a wonderful weekend in Seattle staying at Michelle's apartment.
Her professional interior design skills were obvious. The space was beautiful, modern, spotlessly clean and very comfortable.
The view from both the apartment and the roof deck was amazing.
The location can't be better. We walked or used Uber everywhere and it was good to have a parking space available to rent.
We didn't get to meet Michelle but she was prompt with all communication and the check in/out procedure was easy.
I will definitely stay here again (or at any of Michelle's listings).
Thank you so much Michelle!"
4165387,51923217,2015-10-25,4925678,Matthew,"What a beautiful apartment. Check in was effortless with Tim giving us a quick tour of the apartment and the roof top lounge. The apartment itself was clean, and well stocked. Our family decided to even spend time hanging out in the apartment itself. The roof lounge was amazing as well with views of the puget sound and the space needle. Well worth it, look forward to staying here whenever I'm in Seattle. Thank you Michelle & Tim for your wonderful hospitality!"
4165387,54104979,2015-11-16,7128530,Karla,"Thus was a wonderful spot to stay.

We found the apartment just as represented in the photos, plus fantastic views from the 23rd floor.  The communication with Michelle was efficient and helpful.

One of the best places we have stayed.  We would not hesitate to recommend and plan to stay there again.
4165387,57945100,2015-12-30,40339062,Kieshawn,"Michelle was very friendly, had a great home and we felt extremely comfortable. Her home was even better than advertised. It wasn't advertised but they also had a Sonos system. Walking distance just all of the main downtown attractions and overlooking Pikes place. We will definitely stay here on our next visit to downtown Seattle if still available. The view of downtown Seattle was amazing. It was like our own piece haven over looking the city. The beds were comfortable and the gym was a great perk. The parking garage spaces were very tight but manageable. "
8066883,44743846,2015-08-28,5259373,Dao,It was a cute room. She provided us with towels and water. She even gave us mints. We enjoyed our stay.

And I have also to say Carla's place is very big, cozy and clean, which is also very convenient with a 24 hours supermarket downstairs and close bus stops to downtown. There are also many restaurants and shops nearby. I had a great experience in Carla's place!"
8066883,48466377,2015-09-26,44617942,Scott,Carla was fantastic! She was super friendly and she warmly welcomed my friend and I into her apartment. Her apartment is very clean and well kept. She kindly offered us breakfast each morning we were there and even offered us some cake and other food as well. The location is extremely convenient as it was a few minute walk to the nearest bus stop and about a half hour ride into downtown Seattle. I would highly recommend staying with Carla if you are in the Seattle area!
8066883,48935296,2015-09-29,25521629,Billy,"Carla was not only the best AirBnb host I've had, but she was actually one the best hosts I've ever had staying at anyone's house. She welcomed me with homemade baked goods (she's an excellent cook!) and we immediately sat and talked for hours. I was alone on my trip and she hung out with me the whole time we were at the house. We even did our homework together. I learned a lot from Carla. She's ambitious, intelligent, energetic, and very friendly. Anyone would be lucky to crash at her house. Thank you Carla!"
8066883,57376822,2015-12-25,3992241,Adeline,Carla's the hostess with the mostest. Very warm and hospitable. This makes one of our top favorite airbnb experience. Place was comfortable and quite convienient. The rapid ride c line bus Stop to downtown is right outside her doorstep. She even had pastries for us for breakfast. Was a wonderful stay. We would return and would recommend her place to others. 
3250577,37816695,2015-07-10,32990039,Jason,Pavel is a great host.  I have been to his house twice an its great!!!   
3250577,38060260,2015-07-12,32673882,Colin,"The room was nice and fairly large. It had plenty of room for 2 people and a couple of suitcases. The cat was very friendly and came down to greet us and stayed for a couple of pets. The host was very flexible and made sure everything went smoothly, even accommodated special check-in/check-out times.  "
3250577,39137884,2015-07-20,38490831,Mark,You can launch in almost any direction from Pavel's basement space and get to cool things within minutes. In one direction Green Lake Park to run around...another direction a beach at Golden Gardens Park on Shilshole Bay....and in another all of downtown is within 15 or so minutes. The room is clean and pretty large..and the shower particularly is nice.  Not much interaction with Pavel himself but he was always there and responsive to any small issues or requests.  I explored Seattle from this space...and had a great time doing it!
3250577,40411475,2015-07-30,39769319,Eric,He was very communicative with helpful bus instructions. VERY flexible when it came to check out time. Some of the furnishings are tacky but it has everything you need. There is an air mattress if the twin sized bed isn't enough.
3250577,42009493,2015-08-10,30800935,Jesus,"Pavel was a superb host. Very accommodating.

No complaints whatsoever. I only have praise for Pavel and how smoothly everything went.

The room was much bigger than pictured, which was a pleasant surprise. The neighborhood is a quiet suburb, which felt welcoming and homey.

For me, the experience was all-around perfect."
4384343,22213069,2014-11-01,62778,Nikki,"Carrie was a very kind and accommodating host. The space was clean and exactly as described. It provided me with everything I needed for the week spent there. I enjoyed being able to cook for myself, as well as the proximity to the U-district and 45th for restaurants and take-out. Would gladly stay here again."
4384343,22614546,2014-11-10,17150738,Martha Marty,"Carrie answered all my questions and made sure our stay was comfortable.  I liked the fact that it had a private entry.  Carrie's place was very cute, super clean and had everything you needed (living room area, private bath, kitchen, bedroom and it even had a washer and dryer.  We took the light rail to downtown and the bus to her place and dropped us off less than a block away from her place.  Area was very cute and close to bus stops and Univ of WA.  We will definitely book again when we return to Seattle.  "
4384343,28049302,2015-03-16,29011334,Cali,"Carrie's rental space was ideal for my stay in Seattle.  Upon arrival we did a walk through of the apartment and she familiarized me with everything I needed to know during my stay.  She made herself available for any little extras I inquired about. The apartment is clean, well laid out, comfortable, and centrally located for access to UW or downtown Seattle.  

There were fresh flowers upon my arrival which was a nice touch.  She even asked for any suggestions on making the stay for future guests (which may well include myself!) enjoyable.  I would recommend this property for a single traveler or couple. "
4384343,28321643,2015-03-22,3740184,Meredith,"I came to Seattle with a friend for a wedding and wasn't disappointed by Carrie's apartment! The space is absolutely beautiful: very well-maintained, impeccably decorated and light, despite being in the basement. The neighborhood is great too, just a short walk to many coffee shops, bars and restaurants.

Carrie was very communicative before and during our stay. We had the opportunity to meet her and she was lovely -- and even came through with a safety pin for last-minute dress alterations. I'd highly recommend this place!"
4384343,29761739,2015-04-12,500385,Erin,"Carrie's space was awesome! Exactly as pictured, it was quiet and cozy, and had everything we needed for our stay. Carrie made the check-in process extremely easy, and was available for any questions we had, too. Would definitely stay here again!"
4384343,30717568,2015-04-26,22630592,Rasna,"Carrie was very helpful . The chic basement was so awesome , it had everything you could possibly need . It is located in the cute neighborhood of Wallingford close to many shops and restaurants . I would definitely stay here again it's about 4 or less miles to downtown. Great location and great host ."
4384343,32995257,2015-05-24,25565049,Adam,"Chic is right; this semi-subterranean apartment is elegantly outfitted and immaculate.  Carrie was a pleasure to talk to, responsive, flexible, eager to make improvements, and very respectful of our privacy.  Entry is via a garage door keypad so coming and going is easy.  The location is choice - quiet and within easy walking distance to one of the hippest streets in town.  We drove, and only once did we have to park more than a 30sec walk away.  Definitely recommended."
4384343,34073067,2015-06-04,31517167,Candy,"Carries apartment is wonderful from the chic design to the very comfortable queen bed.  The kitchen is very functional with all the comforts of home. The photos, description, and reviews are accurate.   What stands out is Carries caring hospitality.  What a gem she is.  When we return I'd love to take her up on the gin and tonic she offered me - and I'll bring the gin!"
4384343,34328527,2015-06-07,23789420,嘉文,Nice and beautiful host. Welcoming us at 22:00 pm. Clean and quiet place for stay. Everything is prepared. And also you can just park before the house. It's safety!  I've already introduced it to my friends! Thank you so much Carrie .
4384343,35567873,2015-06-20,1849187,Stephanie,"Carrie was really friendly and flexible, and eager to provide a comfortable experience for us. She was super easy to communicate with and even after checking out of the apartment, she made sure to let me know that I had left behind a treasured bracelet! Really appreciated her letting me know and she made it easy for me to retrieve it. The place was exactly as pictured and provides access to so many other great Seattle neighborhoods (we walked and took the bus everywhere)! Highly recommend for your next Seattle trip "
4384343,35953302,2015-06-23,3076576,Michael,"Carrie was very nice and accommodating.  Her place was comfortable and clean, which was exactly what we were looking for. I would definitely stay there again if I'm ever in Seattle again. "
4384343,36290067,2015-06-27,33524598,Rachel,"Carrie was a great host and very hospitable.  She even picked me and my husband up from the train stop once we arrived!  The place was exactly as pictured and in a lovely neighborhood.  We were walking distance to several restaurants and ice cream shops.  We talked to some locals and when we told them where we were staying, they raved about Molly Moons and The Whale Wins.We used Uber to navigate the city and were 10-20 minutes to downtown depending upon traffic."
4384343,36661346,2015-06-30,24629805,Frank,"Sehr freundlicher Kontakt, nette, vollständige Wohnung, sehr sauber.
Gerne wieder."
4384343,37836760,2015-07-11,4561082,Linda,"Everything was a described. Unfortunately, I left early and arrive back late so little time to interact with Carrie.  However, she did offer me a welcoming gin & tonic that was much appreciated and she printed out my boarding passes when I left."
4384343,39908852,2015-07-27,6965533,Francisca,"Carrie was very sweet and accommodating. The basement apartment was nothing less than amazing great! Located in a quiet street and in a beautiful neighborhood. Also close proximity to bus 26, that goes to downtown. The apartment has a very comfortable bedroom, and very high standard of bathrooms and kitchens. A great place and stay! Recommended! Thank your Carrie!"
4384343,40295684,2015-07-29,36661760,Charmaign,This place was perfect for what we needed. The location was prime to every place that we needed to go. Just a 10-15 min drive. It was very clean and felt very much like home. The host was friendly and ready to help at any given time. This was our first time to Seattle and it was the perfect place to stay. An all around positive and great experience. Thank you Carrie!
4384343,41597689,2015-08-08,15064141,John.,"     Carrie's chic apartment was a perfect place for me to spend a week visiting family in Seattle. It is very bright, fresh and clean.  Everything seemed new.  It has everything needed for a comfortable stay, including a large bedroom with a super comfortable bed and a bathroom comparable to that of a luxury hotel.
     There was a heat advisory the week I stayed with Carrie, but the apartment was comfortably cool even in the hottest part of the afternoon. This apartment is ""cool"" in every sense of the word!
     The neighborhood is quiet and safe.  On-street parking was never a problem.  Restaurants, coffee shops and other amenities are not far away.
     Carrie is the perfect hostess.  She gave me all the information I needed, and it was plain to see that she genuinely wanted me to enjoy my stay.
     So long as my sons live in Seattle, Carrie's apartment is the first place I will try to book whenever I go to visit.  Thanks for everything Carrie!"
4384343,42297354,2015-08-12,34083705,Bronwyn,"Our best experience to date. Carrie was a delightful host, our apartment was beautiful, clean and comfortable. We had everything we needed, the bus was a three minute walk and took us right to the centre of town and also to the train station, the supermarket a few more blocks away. The area was a quiet suburban street but only a fifteen minute bus trip to everything. Thanks Carrie, so friendly  and welcoming, you absolutely made our stay in Seattle perfect. "
4384343,43225590,2015-08-18,9024662,Susan,"Carrie was immediately responsive to e-mail questions and very easy to get hold of.  We loved this location; just outside the bustle of the city, but walking distance to great coffee shops and restaurants.  We found we were never more than 3 miles from wherever we wanted to go.  The place met the description, quiet clean and very comfortable.  "
4384343,44651791,2015-08-28,35807860,Susan,"I didn't realize I only had a limited time to write a review and as we are still travelling I had put it off until getting notice that today was my last chance! This was our very first AirBnB experience, and it exceeded our expectations!  I have even more positive memories from our stay after having a couple other less-than-up-to-expectations.

Carrie's place was clean and inviting and beautiful!  Everything we could think to need was provided, and she even brought us coffee for our first morning!  

It is as pictured, and the new purple area rug is lovely to walk on and the bathroom even has heated floors! We enjoyed time spent in the neighborhood, and out in the garden watching the world go by as well. We even caught a bus downtown and back, another first for these inexperienced in public transportation.

I have only good recommendations for Carrie's place, we would stay there again if ever back this way!"
4384343,45107165,2015-08-31,8477645,Cai,This was an incredible Bnb! The location was phenomenal for us and I truly suggest it. The space was perfect for a couple and very light and bring despite being a downstairs location. It was incredible that there is a full size kitchen available in the unit - which is really a game changer for some of us out there. Everything we could have needed was available to us and Carrie was easy to get a hold of when we needed her. I absolutely recommend this Bnb and will be back soon! (PS the design in the unit is incredible. So classy and modern!)
4384343,45666461,2015-09-05,34830845,Jim,"Carrie's place was so wonderful!  The pictures are very accurate, but my wife and I agree it's even better in person.  The bathroom was big and immaculate which my wife loved.  We love her style and how her basement apartment was furnished.  And we never felt like we were in a basement as the windows allowed enough light in and played well with her choice of decor.  Carrie was very accommodating for our check-in as we ended up arriving a little later than we initially agreed upon.  We loved having a full kitchen available allowing us to cook breakfast each morning.  Her location is in a cute, quiet neighborhood w/ a nice coffee shop a few blocks away.  She's also very convenient to the Burke-Gilman bike trail which we took advantage of.  Overall a very memorable stay thanks to Carrie's place.  We could see ourselves living there which is always our measuring stick and definitely would love to come back!"
4384343,47480590,2015-09-19,39835839,Keith,"Carrie was a great host, she made us feel welcomed and offered to help with any questions or needs we had. The apt was very nice, very clean and well supplied with all the items we needed. The neighborhood was very quiet and pleasant. Parking on the street was not a problem, we were usually able to get a spot fairly close to the apt. We really enjoyed our stay with Carrie."
4384343,49654713,2015-10-05,43531730,Apoorva,"Beautiful apartment - really clean, well-decorated, had everything we needed and more! Carrie was also really welcoming and happy to give us some tips for local coffee shops/eateries to check out as we started our day. Neighborhood was residential and quiet, and was very close to all the Seattle neighborhoods/sites that we wanted to check out."
4384343,50551116,2015-10-12,23973751,Judy,"Awesome apartment! It was comfortable and clean. The kitchen was stocked with everything we needed to make a simple breakfast for the days that wanted to stay in.  Check-in/out was easy--Carrie was very accommodating to our schedule. She was also very responsive to all of the questions and concerns we had during our stay. The bathroom was our favorite feature of this cute little unit. Nothing beats coming home from a day of sight-seeing and stepping out of the shower onto heated floors! All-in-all, we'd most definitely recommend staying here"
4384343,51147167,2015-10-18,10743545,Ana,"This was our first experience with Airbnb and it couldn't have been a better one. Carrie is a wonderful host, she was very accommodating to our schedule (as far as check in and out), checked on us through out the stay to make sure we were comfortable and gave us recommendations on restaurants in Seattle.  The apartment is super clean, nicely decorated and it has everything you would need (kitchen utensils, towels, shampoo, soap, blow dryer, iron and iron board, etc) the location of the apartment is perfect, there are coffee shops and restaurants within walking distance, and all the major attractions are a 10-15 min drive. We rented a car and found it fairly easy to find parking on the street. Overall it was a great stay and would definitely recommend it! "
4384343,55377287,2015-12-01,45258419,Ingo,"This was my first stay with Airbnb and I am very happy that it was in Carrie's great apartment. I lived there for one month after moving to Seattle. 

Carrie is a wonderful host and made sure that I had a perfect stay. She is very kind and hospitable and helped me a lot with all kinds of things. She accommodated to my schedule regarding check in and check out and was very responsive when I had any question . 

The apartment is beautifully decorated, very spacious and well equipped. I was cooking almost every evening and had everything that I needed. The bed was very comfortable and the bathroom is great, with a nice and large shower and heated floors.

The apartment is conveniently located. Buses downtown and to the university are close, the Burke Gilman bike trail is 5 min away. Furthermore, there are nice restaurants and coffee shops around. I also had a rental car and always found a parking spot closeby.

All in all, I had a great time and can very much recommend staying in Carrie's apartment."
1520581,9306523,2013-12-20,9929496,Nick,"Great people. Ideal neighborhood. Overall great experience.
Staying at the Hacker House was perfect for my 3-month stay while in Seattle for projects, giving me a great opportunity to meet some new people who shared similar interests as well as experience all that Capitol Hill has to offer.
The place was clean and well-managed, and even with 5-7 other people staying there, was surprisingly private.
I had a really good time, would absolutely stay there again and would definitely recommend to anyone looking for short-term housing."
1520581,9809051,2014-01-11,9929496,Nick,Another great (email hidden) House. Good meeting everyone and hanging out—though it was just short-lived this time. Would recommend staying for both a few days or a few months. 
1520581,9988216,2014-01-23,2904576,Gregory,The IO house was great during my short visit to Seattle. The location is excellent and there are plenty of workspaces around the house so you can always find a quiet place to work on your projects. Matthew does a great job running the place and is super attentive to keeping things orderly.
1520581,11406769,2014-04-01,10936501,Arno,"I have been (email hidden) ""Hacker"" House for the last three months and have thoroughly enjoyed interacting with the fellow hackers, with Matthew (operations), and with Andrew (host).  Matthew, a fellow New Yorker, has been a total riot to speak with!  I applaud their efforts to cultivate a hacker community.  We have been interviewed for television and online media, a game company meets weekly upstairs, we've shared some meals, and I gave the first Dinner/Demo presentation recently -- all good signs for the beginning of something important, exciting, and relevant for Seattle..."
1520581,12553576,2014-05-05,11457385,Jeff,"If you are a lover of technology and will be staying in Seattle, chose the IO (aka Hacker) House! 

For the past month, I have been living with the most brilliant minds while we share stories over dinner, meet weekly about interesting topics and socialize through similar interests.

The house location is very convenient, which made it easy for me walk or bus to my new life each day. Plus, the house captain, Matthew, was friendly and real easy-going.

I highly recommend the IO House."
1520581,18893539,2014-09-02,19127186,Jasson,I was out all day everyday while staying here but I did manage to talk to a few other people staying at the time and they were great company. I would gladly stay there again and hopefully be able to spend more time at the house.
1520581,23032665,2014-11-21,21021602,J. Paul,"Arriving in Andrews house was great, all the infos where given upfront so I could basically just walk in and say hi. The room was as described, two beds. Unfortunately there was not a lot of room for my stuff, other than leaving the cloth in my suitcases. 
The people in the house where great, a nice quiet atmosphere, but if you crave some talking, there is always someone around. "
1520581,35518466,2015-06-19,22554783,Jingchen,I spent 4 days in the house and it was a pleasant experience. Detailed info was given before arrival; The house was exactly as described and very well managed; People are friendly and respectable. Would love to stay here again and get to know more people.
1520581,35974639,2015-06-23,1520048,Scott,"The IO house is a great place to meet interesting people. It's a great location in the middle of trendy Capitol Hill. A few blocks away from a grocery store, some cool bars and 2 awesome parks. "
5683646,28679898,2015-03-28,21616684,Chris,"Everything came together really quickly. Ericka's response and communication made my night's stay very easy. The space was perfect in that it was quiet, clean, and comfortable. 

The neighborhood has plenty of parking, lots of bike-friendly streets, and right next to the park and the lake.

It is now my first-choice for when I make my occasional trips to Seattle. "
5683646,28754200,2015-03-29,6483944,Stephani,"We had a great experience staying here- three of us fit fine in the studio. Ericka was fantastic- responsive, friendly, and yet giving us all the privacy we might want. The place itself is very nicely done, and had some fun extras like a radiant heat floor in the bathroom, an outside patio, a gas stove (a small but really nice one, with fine tune controls), fresh flowers. The location- ideal. The zoo and a large park and playground are a block and half away. We really enjoyed our stay, and Ericka went out of her way to make that happen."
5683646,30168656,2015-04-18,731728,Toan,"Accurate, nice and quiet neighborhood."
5683646,30243057,2015-04-19,20160230,Michelle,OK
5683646,31021762,2015-04-30,1989612,Jean,"Studio apartment is in wonderful location with easy parking.  Ericka was out of town but husband Adam for available for help.  Nice large studio space and wonderful to have a private patio (though weather too cold and rainy for us to take advantage this time). Heated tile floor in bathroom was a nice touch.
Suggestions:
•Provide coffee for morning (Adam kindly brought us some when we asked.) Note: wine and beer were provided in refrigerator, though we didn’t use.
•Add some hanging space.  We had no place to hang coats etc. (mentioned to Adam and he agrees and is thinking about how they can do this)
•Remove personal toiletries from the bathroom. (There were other peoples’ toothbrushes and partial used tubes of toothpaste etc.)
•Add a space heater.  There is no thermostat in the studio, so heat depends on main house thermostat.  We were cold some of the time.   Adding a space heater would give guests some temperature control.

Notes:
•Studio has only one chair –a comfortable barrel chair. In order to have a second seat we brought inside from the patio the two chairs and small table (it was too wet and cold to use outside).   That addition made the studio more functional for us.
•Refrigerator was noisy enough that we turned it off in the middle of the night (oops, I forgot to turn it back on before we left).  If we were staying longer I would just turn it off when going to bed and turn it on the next morning.
•Patio needs a good spring cleaning.  We apologize we tracked in some debris even though we wiped our feet on the outside mat.
"
5683646,31997047,2015-05-12,8395058,Shawn,"We really enjoyed our short stay at Ericka's studio in Ballard. It was clean, comfortable, and had a very nice patio to sit out on and enjoy the nice weather. It's a great option in a fantastic Seattle neighborhood."
5683646,32994400,2015-05-24,31575377,Jessie,"The studio apartment was absolutely perfect for my small family during our stay in Seattle. We were traveling with a 2 year old and Erika made us feel very welcome with the toys and games she had left out for our son to play with. 

The neighborhood was great and the location perfect if you want to go to the zoo or have little ones who love playgrounds. There was an awesome playground just one block away and the entrance to the zoo was just around the corner. It was also very convenient for catching the bus downtown, which we did one of the days we were there.

The kitchen space was adequate and provided everything we needed for cooking a few meals in so we didn't have to eat out every day. If you want to eat out there are a few great little restaurants just a block away and we found a great bakery as well conveniently located.

We have no complaints about our stay and would definitely stay here again in the future!"
5683646,33422148,2015-05-27,9490371,Ashley,The host canceled this reservation 5 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
5683646,34442341,2015-06-08,31566540,Erin,"This was a great place for our stay. The apartment is clean and exactly what you see in the pictures. It was cold the first day we got in, and Ericka had put a space heater in the apartment for us while we were out. She's a very attentive host and made us feel comfortable. The location is fantastic! We were able to easily jump on the bus downtown. There is an express stop a very short walk away, just outside a little coffee shop. We used Uber alot, the central location made the ride fares very affordable. The only suggestion I have is to keep in mind that the mattress in the apartment is very very firm. We were in and out alot, completely forgetting to text Ericka to see if she had a topper for the bed. Overall, it's a great place to stay! Our first airbnb experience was great! I would highly suggest renting this cute apartment."
5683646,34609156,2015-06-09,16838446,Dallas,Ericka's place was perfectly welcoming and the neighborhood had everything we needed with some great restaurants.  Would gladly stay there again.

5683646,35651550,2015-06-21,18230658,Alicia,"Our stay in Seattle was amazing!  Ericka's place was perfectly located near the 5 bus stop, which took us into the city daily.  We were also able to walk to Green Lake every morning and enjoy the beautiful neighborhood.  The house was clean and the use of the sauna was a real bonus.  We give her 5 stars and will be back!! "
5683646,36021043,2015-06-24,13856560,Diana,"Erika's place was perfect for us! Not only was it very clean & comfortable, but it was easy to access and near bus routes and shops. Erika and her husband were out of town, but she was very kind in letting me know they'd be gone and gave us contact information for the person staying at their place & other friends just in case. Their friend Tim was awesome at responding to my questions and provided me with an iron when I needed one (suitcase wrinkles!). We absolutely recommended Erika's place and hope we can visit again in the future. "
5683646,36523166,2015-06-29,62934,Katherine,"Ericka and Adam both went out of their way to be sure that we were comfy and happy in their small studio---and we certainly were. The location was just perfect for us, and they even bought a pack and play for our two year old to sleep in! Between the toys and games in the unit, the proximity to a great playground, the vegan candy shop a few blocks away, and all the great restaurants nearby, we were all happy as can be. :)"
5683646,36994264,2015-07-03,36176259,Tamara,"The neighborhood was lovely, the the location just a short walk from a great walking street with gourmet restaurants and local shops, also close to the zoo, farmers market... The apartment itself was as it was listed, in fact better than we had anticipated as the photos are a little dark. It was a bright space, very clean and neat, nicely constructed. We ate in the little outdoor patio. Our experience was very positive, we met our host once, incidentally, as we both exited our cars at the same time. They were hands-off but available to any requests we may have had (we didn't have any). I would recommend this space to a friend or family member, and will keep it in mind for when we return to Seattle. Thank you!"
5683646,37122203,2015-07-04,37269542,Camilla,Great place to stay and loved the neighborhood! Seattle was very warm during the time we were there but Ericka had the fan going and the room was very comfortable :)  she threw in a nice bottle of wine which we enjoyed on the patio! Absolutely would stay there again!!
5683646,37491819,2015-07-07,4484964,Leah,"Ericka's place was 10 minutes or less from virtually all the places we visited while in Seattle. The neighborhood is quite and feels safe. We actually walked to the woodland zoo during our stay and it took us 7 min! The walk was thru a beautiful park path. As for the place, it was spacious and clean. Ericka was even kind enough to leave us a bottle of champagne for our anniversary trip here! "
5683646,37721954,2015-07-09,26932284,Nathan,We didn't communicate much but when we did it was mainly via txt that I got a reply back. 
5683646,37925004,2015-07-11,875584,Scott,"This studio was perfect! I was in town for a business meeting, and it was a great location, easy walk on the morning for coffee, and super quiet to do my work. Ericka was awesome and even had some local root beer and books waiting for me when I got there!"
5683646,38760612,2015-07-18,32164883,Aimee,"Ericka's place was the best place I've stayed through Air BnB. The space had everything we needed and some nice touches like beer and wine, as well as toys that my baby enjoyed. The location by Green Lake was great for us and there are also nearby coffee shops and restaurants."
5683646,38929444,2015-07-19,3346037,Luke,"Ericka and her place were fantastic!! She was very accommodating and helped with additional arrangements. The location is gorgeous and the space was just as pictured-- clean, nice, comfortable. I greatly recommend her!"
5683646,39055015,2015-07-20,3463102,Jeremy,"Space was well furnished and very cute, and in a great Seattle neighborhood.  "
5683646,39690424,2015-07-25,5870983,Carmelita,"Ericka was a perfect host! She got back to us immediately and made sure our needs were met. The apartment was a very roomy studio with a beautiful private deck. It is in a quiet neighborhood with great restaurants within walking distance. We felt very welcomed and enjoyed the nice touches, such as fresh flowers from the garden on the bedside table. If Ericka's place is available the next time I visit Seattle, I will stay there."
5683646,40719165,2015-08-02,30600955,Deedee,"We were able to spend three nights at the Urban Calm and would do so again.  The pictures were accurate and the place was quiet and clean.  Seattle was experiencing above average temps (low 90s) while we were there and the studio did not have air conditioning.  However, the host and given us a nice fan to use and because the studio is in a lower level (i.e. basement walkout) we were able to sleep at night.  The queen bed was quite comfortable and the kitchenette had everything we needed for morning coffee and evening wine and beer."
5683646,41117900,2015-08-04,34245615,Matt,Ericka was a great host and her place was awesome. She was great about helping us with an early check in and the room was perfect for what we needed
5683646,41452381,2015-08-07,32597235,Amber,"Highly recommend this spot!  Priced apporpirately, quiet neighborhood, street parking easy to find, apartment very clean with comfy bed.  Ericka was accomodating for our late flight arrival.  Wish we could have stayed longer if we didn't travel to San Juan Island early the following day.  "
5683646,42595712,2015-08-14,15966791,David,"Everything was perfect. Great location, great deck, very clean.
Seamless Communication."
5683646,42722310,2015-08-15,23127884,Matt,"This studio is in an excellent neighborhood with many restaurants, coffee shops, and bars near by.  Green Lake is also less than a mile walk away too.  Erika was very helpful and communicative and helped in all my questions.  Both my wife and I found the bed to be quite uncomfortable and it made squeaking/creaking sounds when either of us moved, so sleep was hard to come by.  Also, the interior feel didn't feel very ""homey"" to me as there were random items stored such as a big treadmill right when you walk in.  Overall, I would consider this a neutral experience due to the positives of the host/location and the negatives of not feeling entirely comfortable and ""at home""."
5683646,43833134,2015-08-22,373340,Casey,"Ericka's Phinney Ridge studio was perfect for my recent work visit, and precisely as advertised.  The location is perfect for an after-work (or anytime) run around Green Lake, and is within walking or busing distance to a wide variety of restaurants and bars.  

Ericka made the check in and out process perfectly seamless.  I look forward to staying there again when work or leisure travels sends me that way."
5683646,46214844,2015-09-08,42721963,Elizabeth,Just as described.  Perfect studio in a great neighborhood with easy public transport access.
5683646,46521865,2015-09-11,3373453,Nora,"I had a brief overnight trip to Seattle, and Ericka's studio was just right. Very clean and comfortable. Comfortable bed. Great location."
5683646,48286211,2015-09-25,31876811,Stephanie,"Erika responded to my questions promptly and provided the necessary information for check in. The location was very convenient for us, just a few blocks from our friends and close to coffee shops and restaurants. We had rented a car and there was plenty of street parking available. The space was as expected, although we could not control the temperature (at least to our knowledge). The apartment got a little warm in the afternoon sun but cooled off at night. "
5683646,51680231,2015-10-22,4478433,Ben,"Ericka was a great host- the studio was cozy, great location with easy access to restaurants, and stocked with board games and some light snacks with a mini-kitchen setup.  A great spot for visitors to Seattle, and easy bus access to downtown for business travelers.  "
5683646,51873592,2015-10-24,43450935,Kristi,"Erika was communicative and friendly.  The place was really cute, cozy, and clean.  He patio was adorable, wish we had more time to enjoy it!  Great location.  As described.  Plenty of street parking and easy to find.  I would recommend!"
5683646,52180911,2015-10-26,4276703,Greg,Great spot and close to everything. 
5683646,52281794,2015-10-27,9636796,Travis,Couldn't have asked for a better experience. My girlfriend were i stayed here for one night and absolutely loved it. In a cute neighborhood with tons to do and this part of Seattle is really cute. Bottle of Rhone looked amazing but we didn't partake but just shows how good of a host Erika is. Would stay again!
5683646,53518274,2015-11-09,8976172,Zhi,Ericka's studio was neat and clean. She even prepared us a nice bottle of wine. 
5683646,53739187,2015-11-12,17477014,Kyle,The host canceled this reservation 48 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
5683646,54737109,2015-11-23,47149096,Bob,"Erika was very helpful and responsive before and during our stay.    Our stay was only overnight but we enjoyed the large suite and it's proximity to Green Lake, good restaurants, and Shilshole Marina."
5683646,56810337,2015-12-18,10997299,Olia,"very nice place, clean and lovely.  perfect privacy, the coded entrance gives complete independence and great flexibility.  Ericka was very available and responsive via email, it was a perfect mixture of privacy and autonomy and feeling welcome and cared for.
Would definitely like to stay there again."
5683646,57082631,2015-12-21,4500823,Jennifer,"Ericka was a fantastic, lovely host! Everything was comfortable and convenient and incredibly easy.  I was only in town briefly and needed a place to stay that would be easy to get to and in and out of - this place was perfect! I only wish I'd had more time to spend in the neighborhood. "
7873345,45420823,2015-09-02,41842592,Daniel,Cheap place to sleep for a few days.
7873345,49372056,2015-10-03,686466,Jade,"My stay at the Crayola house was perfect for my needs. I could crash out after my long international flight, shower in any of the bathrooms, make food in the kitchen and meet locals and other guests. The shared bedroom was very hostel style, but much more cozy than any hostel I have stayed in. While you can't choose your bunk mates, and the guest who shared the bunk with me was not my preference, I was still able to feel comfortable in the room. 

Thanks Michael, Leah and other Crayola Occupants!"
7873345,52596561,2015-10-31,37932993,Azhagappan,"Excellent place to stay.  Friendly folks - my timing didn't match Michael/Leah's, and hence didn't get to see them - but the other folks in the house were super helpful. "
7873345,53214117,2015-11-06,41158892,Paige,"I had an awesome time here! Everyone was super friendly. It was easy to hang out with a group or find a quiet spot to get work done, which I was stoked about. This is a really fun place to stay, especially if you're still getting to know Seattle."
7873345,54341875,2015-11-18,48133008,Amanda,"I had a lovely time. It was an incredible surprise, I had never stayed in a hostel before and I couldn't possibly expect anything better. Everybody in there was really friendly, everything was extremely organized. If I'm ever back in Seattle I'll definitely go back to the Crayola House. Thanks for making my trip more enjoyable!"
7873345,56733084,2015-12-17,36777132,Kohei,We talked with host and we can have good time!!!
7873345,58091581,2015-12-31,49232821,Bertie,I didn't have much chance to communicate with the host. Leah is really responsive though. She provided very clear check-in and check-out instructions which saved me a lot of time. Other airbnb guests there were very friendly and fun. I had a good time during my stay. The room was clean and tidy.  I will probably stay there again if I go to Seattle in the future.
3413183,14849603,2014-06-27,5625557,Craig,Ryan is a great host.   He's very considerate and respectful of your space.   I would definitely recommend his place.  
7699096,42472700,2015-08-13,16356364,Malik,"Great Host, Home was well kept and communication with Andric was great. He even gave me a great welcome basket and some great dinner recommendations.

The apartment itself was amazing, and the rooftop lounge was great as well."
7699096,42955652,2015-08-16,1762430,William,"Fantastic space, very convenient to Seattle tourist locations - Waterfront, Pike Place, Space Needle, etc . . .  Owners left some goodies; we felt very welcome.  Highly recommended!"
7699096,44010481,2015-08-23,40619683,Mary,"From the moment I made the booking to the moment I left the apartment the host, Andric Jackson was wonderful to work with! The apartment itself is wonderful and a delight to stay in. I had an event at the Washington Conference Center which was a short 4 min walk away. Wonderful restaurants within walking distance including a sushi restaurant directly across the street and a coffee bistro/shop on the ground floor. We had a wonderful stay and looking forward to returning back soon. Thank you for a wonderful and memorable experience.  "
7699096,44501090,2015-08-26,35935769,AnJuan,"Andric and Drea have a fantastic unit in the First Hill section of Downtown Seattle. The location was is very convenient if you plan on doing a lot in the city center, highlighted by the bus line being just a mere half block away. The unit itself is a simple yet upscale layout in a mixed development building. When I arrived late in the evening, I was greeted to a space that had soothing music playing from a local 24-hour jazz station and a bottle of merlot on the dining area table. The bathroom was fantastic with very comfortable water temperature and pressure, plenty of linens, and even some toiletries for use. The bedroom, while small in overall size, served it's purpose well with an extremely comfortable bed and an open layout facing the patio that provided a great sunrise effect. I didn't use the kitchen too much but plenty of dishes and utensils were provided and they even had fresh milk in the refrigerator. There is also parking available in the garage underneath the building. This was a fantastic stay. From here on out, I will look to book with Andric and Drea for my Seattle visits."
7699096,44962243,2015-08-30,39251183,Geetika,"Fantastic stay, highly recommend! 

From the moment we booked to check out, communication was flawless. Not only were all questions answered within an hour but Andric checked in mid-stay to make sure we had everything we needed. It was amazing to walk into a unit that was just as clean/pretty as the pictures and a very nice welcome basket + wine bottle waiting on the table. Pair that with the jazz music that was lightly playing as we walked in and we were blown away at the attention to details! There's lots too- a french press, shampoo/conditioner/body wash/laundry detergent, recommended restaurant lists printed out, playing cards/dominos, small table + chairs on the balcony and more. 

When I go back, I'll for sure check to see if the unit is available (might be difficult as it really is the the perfect home away from home).

Great location- close to many tourist spots (pike market, needle, emp museum, waterfront, japantown, etc) and restaurants nearby. "
7699096,45843681,2015-09-06,20746825,James,"This place was fantastic. Great spot, you are able to walk anywhere and everywhere. They had all the essentials and it couldn't have been more relaxing!"
7699096,46611920,2015-09-12,40410645,WIStoney32,"This was a great apartment.  Exceeded our expectations.  Clean, comfortable, and convenient First Hill location.  Easy walk to downtown and to the convention center.  Nice sized smart TV with several channels and Netflix, which we used in the evenings.  We used the nicely appointed kitchen daily for breakfast.  Gas stove, full size fridge, dishwasher, french press.  Bathroom has a washer and dryer.  Iron and ironing board.  No hair dryer for the ladies, though.  Balcony facing the street is nice.  It was a warm week, so we had the door open most of the time with a fan, since the windows do not open.  Secure access building in a safe neighborhood!  Coffee shop on the ground floor.  Several small grocery stores within walking distance, re-usable bags available in the apartment."
7699096,47075334,2015-09-15,26761393,Gloria,"We were very impressed by the location and how lovely and clean the apartment was. 
Andric and Drea left us lists of places and things to do in the area.  The patio was nice to set and have your morning coffee to start your day or a drink to rewind the end of the day.  The view was wonderful.  There is a roof top patio that is also nice to sit and have a drink.  Thank you Andric and Drea this was a wonderful trip
"
7699096,48002388,2015-09-22,9534154,Mark,"Excellent location and well setup apartment for 2. Clean, bright and close to everything we needed, good coffee downstairs was also very welcome. Parking was good - though most locations including waterfront, museums, galleries, restaurants and city were easily walkable. Andric and Drea were a pleasure to work with - great responsiveness on communication before and during our stay, would definitely stay here again."
7699096,48910159,2015-09-29,10847853,Brandon,Awesome place with everything you need in a location that is very accessible to all the main Seattle attractions.  We walked everywhere from the stadiums to The waterfront and up to Belltown.  I would highly recommend.  Andric and Drea were fantastic hosts and easily accessible for any help or questions we had.  Perfect spot for a Seattle vacation. 
7699096,49907392,2015-10-07,43308708,Joanne,"My husband and I had a wonderful stay. The place condo was very clean and well kept. Would definitely recommend.
"
7699096,51949500,2015-10-25,10390377,Umur,"Everything was as described and it was an awesome week spent in this flat. The furnish is really new and modern, and the flat itself is really spacious.

I was looking for a flat where I can work during the days and relax during the evenings and that's exactly what I got. Would definitely recommend.

I've received a check-in instructions through a message and I didn't need to meet with Andric and Drea as I check in. They're there when you need something but you're left alone the rest. That's the perfect combination for me.

When you arrive, there was a special welcome package, you have a wine and some candies on the table and some music welcoming you to the house. The wine isn't super-nice quality but the gesture is. There's also a bunch of where to eat/where to visit in Seattle guides on the desk.

The flat is close to pretty much anything here, it's in First Hill so it's walking distance to Capitol Hill and Downtown and many other places. I can't speak of public transportation as I had a car.

Nevertheless, if you're coming to Seattle for a few, check this out."
7699096,52552930,2015-10-30,18664172,Cindy,"Gorgeous apartment, great layout! Convenient to the convention center and all the surrounding nightlife."
7699096,53250178,2015-11-07,30932996,Dru,"The place was great. Due to the location, we were able to get by without a rental car during our week-long stay. "
7699096,54153974,2015-11-16,34695078,Jennifer,"Wow this place was great. Super easy check in, near the main Seattle area (we didn't walk due to rain), LOVED the secure parking garage. Very nice and clean place.  We were exploring the city too much to check out the rooftop terrace.  The hair dryer and iron were nice touches too. We would definitely stay here again. "
7699096,54792131,2015-11-23,14103401,Miranda,Andric and Drea were great! There was a slight mixup in the beginning and they were quick to help us which was most appreciated. The home is beautiful and great for 2! It was the perfect spot to stay for the Seahawks game as its great walking distance to most places. The rooftop view is gorgeous and the balcony to the home is great for morning coffee. We are so happy we stayed! 
7308567,40170973,2015-07-28,27059214,Jason,"Nicole's space was superbly furnished and in like-new condition! The bed was extremely comfortable and the space had everything you could possibly want for a short or even extended stay. It could be a little noisy early in the morning, but we were usually out and about in short order, so it wasn't a problem. We'd stay there again, for sure!"
7308567,40677638,2015-08-01,39549654,Erin,This was a great place to stay! The host was so kind and welcoming! The room was perfect! Plenty of room and in the best location. Transportation to and from downtown was very easy. Plus Queen Ann neighborhood had a lot to offer just a short walk away!
7308567,41830675,2015-08-09,13929568,Nick,Our host was incredibly welcoming and very understanding when we had to book a couple weeks before the event because of a previous cancellation by our last host. The house was very clean and everything we could need was available. There was even a ChromeCast on the TV which was really awesome!
7308567,42595951,2015-08-14,1450950,Rob,Beautiful place. Very comfortable and tastefully done. Close to a lot of amazing restaurants. 
7308567,43426808,2015-08-19,5077722,Lauren,"My husband and I visited Seattle with our 1-year old and stayed at Nicole's basement apartment.  The apartment is adorable and completely updated, it was even cuter than the pictures.  Nicole had everything we needed, including baby items (there was a pack-n-play, children's plates/bowls/etc and other toys)!  There is also a washer and dryer, which was very convenient.  We could hear walking and other noises from upstairs, as mentioned in the property description, but that was never an issue for us.  

Nicole was extremely helpful and very quick to respond before our visit and was easy to reach during our stay.  The neighborhood, Queen Anne, is wonderful too.  There are many coffee shops, restaurants, grocery stores and other shops all within walking distance.  Everything else in Seattle is a short drive.  It is very well located.

I would definitely recommend this property to anyone visiting Seattle!"
7308567,44194972,2015-08-24,40642844,Rocky,"Nicole was an excellent and very accommodating host! The place itself was immaculate and modern, and the neighborhood was really lovely and located close to just about everything. I would definitely stay again!"
7308567,44698792,2015-08-28,1176994,Ben,Everything was wonderful! Exactly as described.
7308567,46646207,2015-09-12,20177055,Nancy,"This is a great space, especially for being daylight basement level. The way the space was created shows it was very thoughtfully laid out & furnished, and it really feels like a home. Ample kitchen space if you're into cooking, and a super comfy couch to relax on. Bed & bathrooms were also great - bathrooms especially were modern, fresh, and well equipped with plenty of extra towels. 
A couple of things to be aware of: there is a family living above you, and you'll probably hear them a bit (Nicole was very open to us letting her know if there were any issues - but really...it's their home and it's not a big disruption); there is a large, newer tv, but a very basic cable package...I say this to warn those rabid sports fans, or if you're caught indoors on a rainy Seattle day planning to kill time with movies, etc.
The location is excellent. So much to walk to, and parking is easy."
7308567,47929137,2015-09-21,5550135,Nival,"Wonderful place to stay in Seattle! Easy to get in and out, exceptionally clean and comfortable, really couldn't have asked for a better Airbnb experience. "
7308567,48792290,2015-09-28,3064938,Tarika,"The private apartment is adorable.  It's in a great & walkable part of town.  The apartment is set up wonderfully and has everything you need - washer/dryer, shampoo, soft pillows and bedding, a great kitchen, etc.  I stayed for 4 days and was extremely comfortable the whole time.  

One warning --  Beginning at 6AM you will hear loud footsteps throughout the apartment, including children running around.  Nicole was accommodating and made her kids go upstairs when I complained but it woke me up each morning.     "
7308567,50142999,2015-10-09,21146710,Tim,"I absolutely loved Nicole's basement apartment. It has been completely remodeled and is nicer than my own apartment in Los Angeles! I would definitely recommend it for anyone visiting Seattle for any reason. Great location on the top of Queen Anne and walking distance to some incredible views! If the dates are available and she'll have me back, I will definitely be staying here again"
7308567,50334843,2015-10-11,4084068,Caroline,"Fantastic place to stay in Seattle! The apartment is excellent with a big kitchen, comfortable sitting area, and 1.5 bath. The neighborhood was beautiful and we enjoyed wandering down to the number of little eateries that were less than a block away. And it was well situated to explore Seattle and a few of the surrounding areas (though having a car was very helpful). 

Nicole made us feel very welcome with restaurant recommendations and even chocolates on the bedside tables! If we are ever in Seattle again, we hope to stay here!"
7308567,51227491,2015-10-18,19796305,Alexi,Nicole was an excellent hostess. She made sure we had everything we needed and was available when we needed something extra. I know where I'm staying next time I'm in Seattle. We had a wonderful stay! Thank you!
7308567,52609862,2015-10-31,45317930,Sylvia,"We had a great time at Nicole's place in Queen Anne, Seattle. Quiet, family-friendly neighborhood with an awesome playground close by. But also very convenient to Belltown and Downtown Seattle (5min car/bus ride or 15-20min walk). Bus to Downtown stops 1 block away from house.
The apartment is a mother-in-law apartment in the basement with separate entry. Even though it's in the basement, it was light for most of the day. The apartment also seems to be recently renovated, very clean and well-stocked. Nicole even had a pack-and-play and highchair ready for our kid to use. Laundry facilities were included as well.
Check-in was super easy, received all necessary information up front. Nicole was also super responsive to questions we had during our stay. Thank you so much, looking forward to staying there again during our next trip to Seattle!"
7308567,53007928,2015-11-03,11672677,Diane,"We had a great experience at this lovely apartment. Nicole was extremely accommodating and even put out a crib, highchair, and toys for our baby. The apartment was cozy and inviting, and we really felt at home during our stay. "
7308567,54538433,2015-11-21,4227587,Brett & Hanna,"Nicole was extremely responsive and easy to communicate with. The apartment is perfect for a couple of people or small family. It was fully stocked, extremely clean, and in a great, quaint part of Seattle. You can't beat the location: walkable to delicious coffee shops, Top Pot donuts, and all that Queen Anne has to offer. I appreciated how Nicole let us know there'd be some noise with her children upstairs, but that didn't bother us as we were up in the mornings anyway. Definitely recommend. "
7308567,55589330,2015-12-02,12430942,Anakha,"Wonderful communication, beautiful home, exquisitely decorated.  Sweet family.  We loved our stay and felt completely at home.  The Queen Anne neighborhood is fabulous."
7308567,58073056,2015-12-31,47943099,Sara,"This is an absolutely lovely apartment - what you see in the pictures is what you get!  It's in a great location that's super accessible to things like the Seattle Center (walking) or other Seattle neighborhoods via bus/public transit or a short Uber ride.  Queen Anne itself is super cute and walkable with some great restaurant options.  The apartment was wonderful to come back to for a cozy wind down from a day of exploring Seattle.  The fully stocked kitchen allowed us to make a few meals in during our week-long stay.    

Nicole was a responsive host from the very beginning.  Replying to messages and questions in a timely manner.  While we didn't see her or her family during our stay, we did hear them every once in a while.  However, coming from a multi unit in Chicago, that didn't bother us.  

We would love to stay here again should we return to Seattle for a visit and Nicole would have us!

1594412,35615855,2015-06-20,8889725,Agnes,We had a very comfortable stay at Chris' home. The room and bathroom was clean and equipped. West Seattle is a great location to stay at and the bus stop is right outside the house where it is an easy 20min ride downtown. Chris is nice and easy going and made every effort to make us feel at home. Thank you and it was really nice to meet you. 
1594412,41612505,2015-08-08,3392854,Darrene,"Chris' place was a great find for us. Quiet, clean, nicely appointed and easy access to the Junction--great walk, run; good views not far from it. Chris is super nice and sought to make our arrival and stay super calm. Thanks!"
2778101,12260653,2014-04-27,2379892,Russ,"Terrific place, terrific host, terrific neighborhood.  Easily among the best on all points.  Of course, Shan delivered some beautiful, sunny Seattle days too--not sure how she did that..."
2778101,13358759,2014-05-26,11949844,Stuart,"Shan was an incredible host. She was ready for us when we arrived, and gave us tons of recommendations about food, drinks, and things to do in the local area. Really made us feel at home.

The apartment was great too. It's a beautiful old building, so the floors were a little creaky, but it all added to the character. You'll get exactly what you're looking at in the pictures. Also, location was great too. In a nice little neighborhood right outside of capitol hill and very convenient to get everyone in Seattle (except for Ballard area). We didn't have a car, and were still able to see a ton of the city using public transit and uber/lyft. "
2778101,14445134,2014-06-19,187232,Shannon,Our stay was all we hoped it would be.  Very true to description/photos.  Great neighborhood and within walking distance of anything we needed.  We would definitely stay here again!
2778101,14647520,2014-06-23,16501875,Remi,"Great experience staying at Shan's place! Everything was as described, very comfortable and lovely decor, simple but nice amenities. Shan was very easy to communicate with and friendly. Awesome location in a fun part of town, super easy to walk places and catch buses around town. Would recommend!"
2778101,14885524,2014-06-28,14859827,Isabelle,What a beautiful place! Shan really has the prettiest appartment and I felt at home immediately. There was everything I needed and the place is located next to some cute restaurants and coffee shops. My interaction with Shan could not have been better: she was super responsive and accommodated me although I was arriving pretty late at night. I would recommend this little gem to anyone! 
2778101,15185902,2014-07-04,3755510,Daniel,We had the most amazing time in Seattle - not only staying at this beautiful apartment in the best neighbourhood but also making a couple of fantastic new friends. Shan was so welcoming and friendly and we had a great time getting to know her and her city in the few days we were there. I can't recommend Shan or her super-cool flat more - book it now! 
2778101,15349564,2014-07-07,4918938,Kathryn,"The apartment was lovely, very spacious and filled with light, and the nearby neighborhood was fun and active, with lots of stores, cafes, even a QFC. "
2778101,15638779,2014-07-13,16726478,Marc,"My wife and I had a fabulous stay in Seattle's Capitol Hill neighborhood. Shan's flat was perfect, and she was so sweet to have wine, bottled water, and fresh flowers upon our arrival. Several restaurants, bars, and coffee shops were a brief walk away and the neighborhood was exactly what we hoped for in terms of uniqueness and style. 

We would (and hope to) stay here again. 
"
2778101,16106800,2014-07-22,2467983,Neil,"Great light and airy apartment, great neighborhood, great host with great communication before hand and when we arrived etc. thanks so much, really enjoyed our short stay in this genuinely dreamy vintage flat! "
2778101,16213910,2014-07-23,13241741,Adrian,"This was such a cute apartment and Shan was a great host. While she was out of town during our stay, she made herself available over the phone. This place is exactly as pictured- a charming and open flat, close by to lots to do. A lot of our trip was spent working at the spacious dining room table during the day, then walking/Ubering to local spots like Liberty Bar or Lark for an evening out. I definitely recommend this flat- if I ever airbnb in Seattle again I would not hesitate to book this again."
2778101,17530587,2014-08-13,1917572,Youli,"My mom and I stayed at Shan's place during our 4-day trip to Seattle. Her place is lovely decorated, reminded me of an Anthropolgie store! It is conveniently located in Capitol Hill and easily reached by several bus lines that can take you to different parts of Seattle. There're two main streets you can easily walk to from the apartment, 15th Ave and Broadway Ave, which both have a bunch of cute restaurants, coffee shops, boutiques and thrift stores you can explore. 

The only minor problem we had during our stay was that Shan wasn't able to let us into the building as promised so we had to wait outside of the building for a while. The weather was very nice during our stay (90 degrees!), a bit too nice that it was too hot for me to fall asleep in the evening as there's no AC, but I guess that's very rare in Seattle.

Overall, it's another great Airbnb experience!"
2778101,37400784,2015-07-06,19338942,Remmy,"Shan was very accessible and accommodating even while she was out of town during our stay. Fresh flowers, accompanied the fresh towels which were awaiting our arrival! Couldn't have been more pleased with our stay. "
2778101,40795982,2015-08-02,35791793,Aneeta,"A gorgeous flat with an incredible view. The apartment was clean, comfortable and Shan even provided a few little luxuries I hadn't expected. Shan was so accommodating, we arrived early before the flat was ready and she helped us out by giving us somewhere to store our bags until it was. She then gave us some great recommendations on where to get a drink or a bite to eat -- Rachel's Ginger Beer was one we particularly loved! The area was great, we walked downtown -- it's a pretty stroll with plenty of great cafe pit stops if you need it. We loved our time there and would highly recommend it for your stay. "
2778101,42283222,2015-08-12,12023985,Matthew & Steve,Shan's place is such a peaceful & bright sun filled retreat! We loved using it as our Seattle home base during our early August stay! 
2778101,44950960,2015-08-30,12459422,Kristin,"Truly ""dreamy""! The flat was lovely--beautifully decorated and incredibly comfortable. Light-filled and open, the space was romantic and perfect for our stay in Seattle. The flat is on a very quiet street, but is walkable to restaurants, bars, a drug store, and a market. Shan was accommodating and very communicative. Would definitely recommend this beautiful abode."
6490453,35146363,2015-06-15,33950639,Chen,"The house is very large, modern and clean. The room in the basement is very comfortable. It has a separate toilet, as well as 50-inch television. It's own private space. If possible I really want to stay longer."
6490453,35839763,2015-06-22,6322269,Robert,"We had a wonderful time staying with Tri. The house is gorgeous and in a perfect location, being walking distance to Green Lake and many cafes and bars. Neighborhood is quiet and safe but active as well. Tri made us feel welcome and offered use of all of the common areas in his house. We would stay here again!"
6490453,36805492,2015-07-01,626024,Osome,"
The house is beautiful, clean and a very restful place to land for a busy trip. The host, Tri couldn’t have been nicer or more accommodating including wonderful suggestions for where to eat and local transportation. The house is central to all that Green Lake has to offer, a short walk to the lake, shopping and fabulous restaurants. An ideal location to be in the middle of Seattle and at the same time in a lovely peaceful neighborhood. The guest quarters are on a spacious separate level with private bath, exercise room and entertainment area that is generously made available to guests. Would certainly return --love the location, modern furniture, new green construction and most of all the warmth and helpfulness of Tri the owner and host for the house.  "
6490453,37398618,2015-07-06,36666143,Susan,"Tri and Chelsea did an amazing job making me and my friend feel welcome. They were very transparent in communications prior to our arrival and was able to provide us with many recommendations on things to do. The neighborhood had many nearby restaurants and shops as well as a lake within a mile in case you want to kayak, paddleboard, etc. The house is brand new (still has that new house smell!) and very modern. If you are looking to relax in Seattle definitely stay here though the huge TV in the basement along with the gaming consoles may result in you not leaving the house. Tri is not kidding when he says ""mi casa es su casa"" as he offered us access to everything in his home (kitchen, washer/dryer, and even the pantry). It was great feeling so welcome that we did not feel like strangers at all. Tri's cats were probably one of the highlights of our stay --> they were VERY friendly and stayed outdoors (so if you don't like cats you will never have to interact with them but if you do prepare for the cutest and most lovable cats). If I ever visit Seattle again I will make sure to book my stay here again and have already recommended this to many of my friends."
6490453,38416691,2015-07-15,36132003,Chris,"We had a fantastic time staying with Tri and Chelsea in their Green Lake home.  They made their beautiful new home ours during our stay, even inviting us to share some homemade ice cream on the last night of our stay.  The room that we rented was on a separate floor with its own en suite bathroom, which was great.  Tri provided us with anything that we could have needed, including fresh towels, access to their kitchen, roof-top terrace, and entertainment room (which we admittedly were too busy to fully use...apart from  a late night game of shuffleboard...while we were there).  

The area is incredibly convenient and walkable with lots to do nearby.  Green Lake is a great neighborhood to relax in and also to jump off to other great parts of the region.  

We enjoyed our time and are so happy that we booked with Tri and Chelsea.  "
6490453,38902003,2015-07-19,9493523,Torrey,"If anything, the photos in the listing don't do justice to Northwest Charm.  It's an elegant brand new home with modern touches everywhere.  I loved the coffeemaker that ground the Vietnamese coffee beans (provided by Tri) then brewed with just one touch.  The rooftop garden is lovely around sunset with a view over Green Lake and out to Seattle.  The bedroom is simple with a very comfortable bed and private bathroom.  It's in the basement with its own private access.  I liked being able to come and go without bothering any one.

Tri was very easy to work with, and I appreciated the note of introduction which included tips on what to do in the Seattle area.  (If it's a nice day, definitely take the water taxi out to West Seattle.)  We both had busy schedules when I stayed there, so I only got to chat with him  one morning.  Nice guy. 

The Green Lake neighborhood is charming and the house is about a five minute walk down to the lake.  You can also walk five minutes the other direction to a bus stop if  you want to head in to downtown Seattle.  Or drive a few blocks down 65th to some good restaurants.

I hope to stay there again soon!
"
6490453,39541242,2015-07-24,220100,Jordan,"Tri was accessible, although we never had the opportunity to actually meet.  The place was neat and clean, although the giant tv wasn't working because of a cable malfunction.  We did check out the roof deck which was real cool, but we didn't really hang out there very long.  I was visiting my girlfriend and her family and didn't spend much time in the unit, however, the time we spent was enjoyable.  The location is great and we felt welcome.  Whenever I reached out to Tri, he responded in a timely manner.  We loved it and would definitely return. Thanks Tri!"
6490453,40474341,2015-07-31,33457377,Laurel,Tri and Chelsea were welcoming and eager to share ideas on places to go to eat and hike. The accommodations were great. We particularly liked having our own entrance to the sleeping quarters . The proximity to Green Lake was ideal. We would highly recommend staying at their home.
6490453,41235900,2015-08-05,37109081,Stephen,"Tri is particularly nice and the room is very clean and tidy, especially ready for the daily necessities.There is a separate space and we live in the basement with a living room, bedroom, bathroom and storage room, etc., We are particularly fond of Tri 's home electronic equipment system. Tri is particularly keen to give us a lot of advice about how to play and food, so that we have a very memorable and enjoyable experience in Seattle."
6490453,41972700,2015-08-10,31101845,Anna,Tri and Chelsea were kind and easy going hosts. Their home is modern with  excellent and comfortable  furnishings. We especially loved being so close to public transit and the majestic tree lined lake. 
6490453,43072123,2015-08-17,11681870,Shinji,"I enjoyed the stay at the house. The house is new and fresh and located only 5 to 7 min. from the lake, restaurants and shops. 
I am happy to return to this house for the next tip if the room is available.
Thank you. 
Shinji"
6490453,43965160,2015-08-23,3641088,Nicola,Tri's home is very comfortable and beautifully presented. We arrived late in the evening but he had provided us with clear instructions of how to enter the building and we are so thrilled to find a beautiful basement apartment as part of his house for us to use. Tri had left us top tips and a welcome letter which was great to receive. We met Tri briefly the following morning and he was really friendly and accommodating encouraging us to make ourselves at home. We were hardly at the house but it was a gorgeous space to come home to after a busy day sight seeing. Would highly recommend. Thank you Tri. 
6490453,50211971,2015-10-10,31699224,Griffin,"Had a great time staying at Tris'place in green lake. The house is architecturally stunning inside and out. Close to other neighborhoods to explore (Fremont, Wallingford, Greenwood, Phinney Ridge) Tri is quite clean and hospitable as well is Chelsea. I recommend staying here and would do so again."
6490453,51792317,2015-10-24,46032159,Dan,"Very nice large bright space in a very nice location -- convenient by car and walkable to lake trail, coffee shops and shopping. Friendly, unobtrusive hosts. "
6187841,31838563,2015-05-10,855055,Ryan,"Everything about this trip to Seattle was amazing. The 2bd 2ba condo was in an amazing location, so easy to get to everything in Belltown. So many cool restaurants, bars, coffee shops, etc. We walked everywhere due to amazing weather all weekend. The Pikes Place market is about a 10 min walk south. 

The condo is immaculate, with great decor and ready for guests. We didn't have any issues. The beds were very comfortable and my wife is going to buy new pillows (the ones on the beds there were incredible). 

There is a great roof top deck that overlooks the bay and we had a cocktail up there one night for the sunset. 

Honestly, you cannot go wrong for this location and price. We'll definitely book here again next time in Seattle. "
6187841,35096229,2015-06-15,4700806,Jamie,"I loved this place! And hope/plan to stay here again on future Seattle trips. Evan's dad met me when I arrived (and was very flexible about timing, which was also nice). He showed me around - showed me the pool, complex, where to take trash, the garage, where things were in the apartment - and just generally made me feel very comfortable. They have a whole list of activities in the neighborhood and gave great recommendations on what to do. Everything worked well in the apartment, and there was even an A/C unit in the bedroom in case it got too hot. I only turned it on once to cool down the room, and then slept with the windows wide open. There is some courtyard noise when you sleep with the windows open, but it was not too bad and so nice to have that fresh air. The place was exactly as it looks in the pics and super nice. The master has a huge closet and a great bathroom. The second room and bathroom are also really nice. The kitchen has everything you need (which isn't always the case in other places I've stayed). The neighborhood is great. Restaurants on the base floor of the building, and a ton of bars and restaurants within a three-block walk. Sculpture Park and the water are nearby. I walked to my meetings downtown everyday and it took about 15 - 20 minutes. 

Lastly, with so many places on Airbnb being offered by management companies, I really appreciated the personal aspect of staying here and being able to contact the owner if needed. This is the true spirit of Airbnb, so i appreciated that as well."
6187841,37791947,2015-07-10,36937166,Pamela,"Evan and family are perfect hosts -- very welcoming and accommodating.  The apartment is super clean, comfortable, well stocked for guests.  There was everything we needed in the kitchen and bathrooms.  We had 2 adults and two teenage boys -- there was plenty of room for all.  The location is wonderful, being right in the middle of all that's happening in Seattle.  We walked each day to the waterfront sculpture park, then to Pike's Place Market, and all around.  Great all around!"
6187841,38710627,2015-07-18,32588792,Leslie,"We had a great time in Seattle and a lot of that is due to the awesome location of the condo.   It is truly an easy walk to the Space Needle and surrounding area, Pike Place Market and the Harbor area.  The condo is beautiful and exactly as pictured.  We had a chance to try many of the nearby restaurants including those in the condo building.  Thanks for making us feel so welcome.  "
6187841,40727442,2015-08-02,30605320,Brady,"Evan was a truly wonderful host. His condo is pristine and in the beautiful neighbourhood of Belltown. The number of great restaurants within just a few steps is unreal.

Great neighbourhood. Great host. Great condo. Great vacation.

Thanks Evan!

P.S. The rooftop deck and pool are great bonuses also!"
6187841,49468494,2015-10-04,6591434,Kirsten,This was a wonderful condo in a fantastic location.  Everything about this trip was perfect.  The hosts were especially wonderful and welcoming.
9199982,54790507,2015-11-23,49014380,Drew,Very clean apartment. Location is very convenient for downtown and walking around Queen Anne.
9199982,55483655,2015-12-01,28739245,Janet,"Nice & quiet apartment complex with secured entry/exit doors.  Best part was the view from living room and dining room area.   Parking was a challenge every evening though.   Walking from one tower to the other to get to the back entrance area was a little confusing in the first couple days.  I finally got the hang of it towards the end of my stay.  I stayed a total of 5 nights.  The elevator didn't work on the  last day and I had to walk around the front of the building to get to the back of the building to get to my car.  I couldn't figure out how to get down the stairs.  It was way early in the morning, I didn't want to call the host and I had a flight to catch.  Janny was very friendly and hospitable.   She even met me late in the night to give me the keys and a brief tour of the apartment and building complex."
9199982,55853350,2015-12-06,9056625,Michael,"Janny's apartment was in a super convenient location to downtown with a beatiful view. It was a good size apartment so we had no problems bringing our bikes and not having them be in the way. It was a great stay overall, the only issues I had at all was that there was no wi-fi in the room (lobby only), there being no designated parking & having to park so far away and walk, and no tv (ultimately that was my own fault. Wi-fi & tv are my own preferences & I didn't even think to ask, I just assumed they would be there) These in no way took away from our trip, it was still a great stay & would recommend."
9199982,56085740,2015-12-08,8115706,Angela,Janny was easy to work with and available to connect with. The space was clean and convenient to some great Seattle neighborhoods.
9199982,56682011,2015-12-16,42853161,Ruoqu,It was great to live here! 
9199982,57726753,2015-12-28,4324554,Yutaka,"Janny was very flexible and accommodating.  And she responded to all my communication very promptly.  

The space was clean and comfortable."
902243,4020720,2013-04-03,4937760,Kathy,Terrific place - everything was just as advertised.  Both upscale and comfortable.  I highly recommend this lovely option to others!
902243,5416576,2013-06-29,423657,Amelia,"Terrific location, perfect for our 2 night stay, family of 7. The restaurants on both sides of the entrance were totally fantastic; great for a short trip experience of Seattle, but we easily could've stayed there longer!"
902243,5663386,2013-07-10,6932961,Jeffrey,"Great location and nice facility!  It was perfect for two families (one with one and the other with two kids) to stay in downtown Seattle.  Easy access to many great spots that this amazing city has to offer.  If opportunities allow us, we'd like to pay a return visit sometime in the near future.  I highly recommend this place.  (The cost at first seems to be not cheap but splitting it between two families made it extremely reasonable and cost effective, considering all the amenities this place has, including kitchen, dining area, washer/dryer, two full bathrooms, and community swimming pool.  Did I mention a free in-and-out parking space in downtown?!  ;) )"
902243,7005959,2013-09-03,687210,Elizabeth,"Autumn was very lovely and right on time for when we needed to meet.  Thank you!

The apartment itself was good as well.  We would definitely come back :)"
902243,8041308,2013-10-14,7627262,Lynn,"What a wonderful, FULL, whirlwind visit the seven of us had to Seattle.  Autumn was very gracious and helpful in meeting and orienting us to the beautiful, luxurious, condo with a lovey functional kitchen and beautiful, comfortable furnishings.  Autumn steered us to local restaurant and bakery, grocery, and sightseeing.  

Altogether a wonderful visit to our urban northern city!
"
902243,9187528,2013-12-11,8859660,Anna,"Great location, comfortable and clean. Autumn was very helpful."
902243,10078043,2014-01-29,8607880,Mary,I loved the apartment. It was perfect for my family to stay while visiting me in Seattle. The location is ideal and the apartment was spacious and beautiful. Autumn was incredibly helpful and had great suggestions for us. She was very responsive leading up to the visit too. The experience could not have been better!
902243,10675106,2014-03-03,5564459,Rachel,We had a great stay here!
902243,11084750,2014-03-19,1444485,Naxin,"My family and I are visiting Seattle for the first time, and we had such a great time staying at Autumn's place. It is a wonderful apartment at a great location. The best sushi place in town and a great bakery are just few steps away! Autumn has been very helpful at check-in and very responsive throughout when I had any questions. The place itself is spacious, clean and cozy. I would definitely stay here again. "
902243,11325061,2014-03-30,12340282,Wenting,"It is a great apartment with 2br/2ba. There are luxury furnitures: washing machine, dryer, sofa, etc. in this apartment. You can use free wifi, watch TV and play wii there. The location is very convenient. It is close to the pike market and space needle. It only takes 10 min to walk to pike market. And there's a really good Japanese restaurant called ""Shiro's"" near the apartment. Autumn is a nice and friendly woman. We have great experience there!"
902243,14238804,2014-06-15,7488691,Christopher,"Autumn was a great host-- easy to communicate with and very accommodating. The space was wonderful and more beautiful than the photos! In addition, the location was fabulous! Thank you so much! :)"
902243,20333742,2014-09-28,12943716,Raquel,"The appartment is perfect! Autumn came sharp at the hour we agreed. Before and after our stay she gave us all the information we requested and needed timely. The appartment is perfectly located in a very lively area with very good connections but at the same time extremely quiet! It is close to the waterfront so you can go for a fantastic run by the sea! All the apparels work perfectly and the appartment is equiped with everything you need! As I said, perfect!
As for the city, Seattle is the best place I've so far visited in the US: good music, delicious food and great great great people!"
902243,21503842,2014-10-19,11707124,Amy,"We rented two apartments in the building for a family visit.  Autumn met us when we arrived and was very helpful with instructions and orientation.  The building is in a fantastic location, walkable to the Seattle Center, Pikes Market and Downtown.  The apartment was spacious and worked well for us.  While we didn't need to use the AC units they were akwardly placed in the master bedroom and it was difficult to get in and out of the bed by the window.  Additionally the maintenance on the unit was not really up to par.  The carpets had multiple spots and stains and there were lights out in all the rooms.  One apartment was missing bath mats and coffee.

Overall, we had an enjoyable visit, but the maintenance could use some improvement."
902243,22256272,2014-11-02,22347260,Jeff,"I highly recommend this establishment as a place to unwind in comfort and enjoy the sites and sounds of Seattle.  The apartment was very spacious and clean.  The beds were extremely comfortable and the bedrooms were large enough where you did not feel confined while sleeping in them.  The kitchen had every amenity we could think of which allowed us to prepare our own meal with the fresh fish and fruit we had picked up from the Pike Place Market.  Parking was convenient with easy in and easy out access though we rarely had to use a car since the apartment was close to anywhere you would want to go in downtown Seattle.  The waterfront was a 15 minute walk, the Space Needle was a 10 minute walk, the ferries were about 25 minutes away and Pike Place was a 15 minute walk.  There were several diverse bars and restaurants within a 10 minute walk. The neighborhood itself was extremely safe and we felt very comfortable strolling the streets at night.  Autumn was a gracious host that greeted us with a smile and a handshake.  She showed us the apartment and explained all the finer details we needed to know as well as recommended areas to see and restaurants to visit.  She was always available via a phone call or text for any questions we had during our stay and answered/responded very promptly.  It was the perfect place to extend our stay after a 7 day camping trip."

Easy to walk anywhere including pikes, space needle, etc. Autumn was a great hostess as well! So nice and accommodating. Would definitely stay here again when in Seattle!"
902243,26866228,2015-02-21,25765040,Nate,"Autumn was great and always responded quickly.  The place was very nice and conveniently located within walking distance to great restaurants and bars.  It was clean and well equipped with, just as expected!  Wouldn't hesitate for a second to stay there again or recommend to friends and family.  Thanks!"
902243,28783660,2015-03-30,26422226,Jacquelin,All went very well right from the beginning when we met Autumn to pick up the key - she made me feel very welcome and helped tremendously with our parking!  The apartment was as good as the website description - we loved it and it fit our needs perfectly!  The neighbourhood was fun and it was also very quiet at night!
902243,29748446,2015-04-12,1859713,Jessica,"Super nice apartment. Exactly as described, which is something compared to other listings in the building. Both bedrooms and bathrooms are good size, with the master bathroom being huge! Autumn is great but we didn't need her all weekend. Perfect location, exactly as described, and a great spot. A++"
902243,32107983,2015-05-14,28496562,Waltraud,"Autumn is the perfect host! She made sure that everything went smoothly for one Week stay, from check-in to check-out. The suite looks better than in the great photos, clean and very well appointed. I highly recommend this establishment as a place in comfort and enjoy the sites and sounds of (email hidden)e building is very secure and we felt safe in the neighbourhood. A   variety of restaurants are just steps away. I'll definitely stay in Autumn condo again on my future visits to Seattle.

902243,33141382,2015-05-25,11908481,Ameet,"Our stay (May 2015) was fantastic -- Autumn was very welcoming and had clear instructions throughout on everything from the check-in/check-out process, helpful tips for the neighborhood, and even providing a mobile crib for our infant.  The condo itself is great -- walkable to both the Pike Place Market and Seattle Center (Space Needle) areas, but equally fun in its own right, steps away from numerous Belltown attractions like the famous Macrina bakery and lots of coffee shops and bars.  "
902243,40251895,2015-07-29,16901593,Beverly,"The location is incredibly convenient - walking distance to the waterfront, aquarium, city center (space needle, EMP museum, etc...) as well as MANY restaurants and shops.  The condo is beautiful, clean, in great condition.  The parking is a bit of a struggle (we had a small SUV) and had to utilize parking nearby once or twice when the lot was full as the spaces are quite narrow and fairly impossible to park an SUV with cars/columns on either side.  When the lot was not as full, it wasn't a problem, so if you aren't intending to get out a lot and traveling on foot -  the space is fine.  Reuben was on time, helpful and friendly.  I would HIGHLY recommend this rental and would definitely rent again myself if in the area!!"
902243,49987662,2015-10-08,41299480,Penghua,Super nice host and wonderful apartment! The location is pretty good and we could walk to most places.
902243,52730789,2015-11-01,45693941,Lisa,Great accommodations and super comfortable beds.  Autumn was very responsive and took care of every detail.
936177,8132514,2013-10-17,8268220,Mark,Probably about the best location in downtown Seattle.  Convenient access to light rail station for airport transport.
936177,9184043,2013-12-11,10240804,Deborah,"The condo worked out great!!!  amazing view, great space and easy to walk everywhere!  Great customer service, would recommend for elderly travelers, easy access elevators and within walking distance of pike's market and waterfront access."
936177,9453369,2013-12-29,2344170,Linda And Robert,Jordan was very responsive to our last minute request for accommodations in Seattle. The apartment worked out perfectly for our family of four over Christmas!
936177,11024636,2014-03-17,6073807,Wenky,Awesome Place！
936177,11991226,2014-04-21,9381170,Gayle,"Fantastic location and amenities, well appointed and comfy.  The whole process was easy. "
936177,13465136,2014-05-28,11368571,Christian,"This was truly a perfect trip. All was exactly as in the information provided, check in and check out were smoothly organized. The apartment's location is close to perfect for a great Seattle experience, it was spacey, the kitchen sufficiently equipped. We can totally recommend that rental. "
936177,15548407,2014-07-11,6899005,Brooke,"Our family arrived to a very clean apartment!  Check in was a breeze and the staff very helpful. There was plenty of room for our family of four. Many attractions were within a comfortable walking distance even for our five year old. The waterfront,  Pikes Place, SAM, the aquarium were all walkable. Even the walk to the monorail to go see the Space Needle and Chihully Glass Garden was easy. The variety of restaurants and shops was great. The pool was a wonderful quiet escape. My only warning to renters is the noise but this would go for any other apartment rental. If you're not used to city noise bring earplugs. I would absolutely rent from Jordan again! He was easy to communicate with and response time was quick."
936177,17411924,2014-08-11,7480890,Maria,Perfect neighborhood for our short stay; the apartment is walking distance to most of the things we wanted to see. It was very clean and the beds were comfortable. Check in was easy as well.
936177,19138547,2014-09-07,11280335,Breanne,Great location and view. Tastefully decorated. Love the app that provides all the needed info. I would definitely stay here again.

clean appartment, great location. our stay was perfect. i will be back "
936177,28712620,2015-03-29,27606293,Mary,Very nice place in a great location. Very clean.
936177,35071322,2015-06-15,29342075,Michael,"The check-in and check-out process were both very smooth and uneventful.  The apartment location was absolutely perfect.  The included parking space was a very major plus as we were able to come and go without worrying about where to park or incurring additional expenses.
The apartment itself was clean and spacious.  The carpet was a somewhat stained and could have been vacuumed better.  The king bed was fine but the queen bed got a rating of only 3-4 out of 10 by the 2 different couples who slept on it.
Overall, a fine experience and one we would repeat."
936177,39755279,2015-07-26,33069479,Scott,"The apartment and location were great, and the view of Elliot Bay from the balcony was an unexpected plus.  The Light Rail station was only a block away, making it very convenient from the airport without a car.  We were able to walk to everything that we wanted to see.  Check in and out was just as described and simple.  The building concierge was also quite helpful, holding a few bags until check-in time and suggesting a local restaurant for breakfast.  "
936177,42395231,2015-08-13,34915780,April,"The description and photos are quite accurate. The location is wonderful, right across the street from the art museum and down the street from the Pike Place market. "
936177,53362924,2015-11-08,21810760,Robin,We had a great stay in Seattle! We had clear expectations of how to check-in and really loved the space. It was just what we needed to unwind after busy days at a conference. The location was perfect - so close to the market and the waterfront!
3898413,33299253,2015-05-26,32935555,Eleanor,"Super cute house with a lot of character. Was very clean and comfortable, with a great kitchen. Thanks Sherry!"
3898413,35302137,2015-06-17,30090139,Patrick,"Sherry was a terrific host.  She was very warm & gregarious, yet gave us our space.  She made us feel very welcome.
The accommodations were just as described.   The place is a beautifully maintained craftsman style home with a very comfortable private backyard deck, which we used often.  
The house is situated in a very quiet residential area but is within easy walking distance to vibrant commercial ares with restaurants and shops. 
No regrets...we'd stay there again.
BTW.....her dog is great.   "
3898413,36963501,2015-07-03,33595462,Karen,"The hostess provided a cozy clean space. She was very organized and reached out to me in advance to inquire about my breakfast desires and kindly provided me with detailed travel information. The house is in a very safe neighborhood near Fremont, public transportation and other sites. The hostess was helpful in offering her recommendations of local flavor. The description of the place was accurate which made our travel arrangements simpler to plan. I would chose to return to the same place if I visited Seattle again. "
3898413,38605846,2015-07-17,17266630,Helena,"We had a wonderful stay at Sherry's lovely home! Nicely decorated, great location, the kitchen was fantastic and a super comfy bed. We love Sherry and her adorable pooch, Rocky! We would recommend this host 100%. "
3898413,39299593,2015-07-22,812672,Lisa,"My stay at Sherry's house was fabulous.  She was easy to communicate, and the house is gorgeous.  I am originally from Seattle and knew exactly where I wanted to stay - this neighborhood is the perfect place to stay to enjoy Fremont, Greenlake, and Gasworks Park.  I highly recommend staying here."
3898413,39579775,2015-07-24,13897570,Jacob,Didn't end up staying - but she was very accomodating and was clearly going out of her way to make sure I had  a good stay
3898413,40103016,2015-07-28,34779925,Kristene,"Whitman Acres is a very warm, comfortable and inviting place to rest your head. Sherry is an amazing and thoughtful host. I knew that we had made the right call on where to stay when she asked us what we liked for breakfast and that she had that waiting for us there along with a few snacks. The place was very clean and inviting. The location could not have been more perfect, it was always a easy drive downtown Seattle or an exploration of Fremont area. 
She had even left us little maps of places and things to d in the area that we may not have known about without the knowledge of our host. 
I cannot say enough good things about our experience. Thank you!"

3898413,41214657,2015-08-05,35308212,Mike,"I really enjoyed my stay at Whitman Acres. Everything was as advertised and communications with Sherry were very easy and clear. I was looking for a quiet place in quiet neighborhood to stay while on a business trip and that it is exactly what I got. On my next trip to Seattle I will try to book Whitman Acres again, if it is available. 

The house is located in a very interesting neighborhood. There are good restaurants and coffee shops nearby and easy access to buses that take one anywhere in Seattle. Sherry was incredibly nice, helpful, and forthcoming with all sorts of useful information about the neighborhood and Seattle in general. "
3898413,41433507,2015-08-07,2479816,Carolina,"Our stay at Sherry's was great. From the beginning she was very accommodating and even asked us what we wanted for breakfast. She had my lactose free milk, that was very sweet of her! The room was very comfortable and spacious and we liked the fact that we could use the kitchen. Overall a great experience.  Rocky was absolutely adorable and didn't even bark at us once, he was very mellow and sweet"
3898413,41619240,2015-08-08,1807572,Cydney & Duff,"Wonderful place/space in a great area of Seattle.  Sherry is a lovely host. Our dog, Emi, was welcomed by her playful pooch, Rocky, and they romped in the backyard. Sherry had a fridge full of fruit, yoghurt and other goodies, making us feel very at home!"
3898413,42286939,2015-08-12,34133789,Wesley,"Our stay here was lovely. A perfect place to spend a relaxing time in Wallingford, within walking distance of Freemont and a quick bus ride anywhere else. Sherry is a great host, and Rocky (her dog) is friendly and so well behaved. Such a fun time. Would highly recommend to anyone thinking of spending time in Seattle."
3898413,42868463,2015-08-16,36375795,Bonnie,"Staying at Whitman Acres was Fabulous. Sherry was very welcoming and a great host. Her house is beautiful, and easy to find. She asked what kind of foods we liked for breakfast and had those available for us upon arrival. I was looking for a place in the Freemont area and she is just up the road from where we needed to be. I love geocaching and enjoy visiting Seattle. I would love to stay at Whitman Acres when I take my next trip to Seattle. "
3898413,43071545,2015-08-17,35919680,Randi,"Sherry was a wonderful host!! Anyone would be lucky to have someone as accommodating as she was! Upon arrival, Sherry was great with showing us around, providing directions and providing suggestions for some great local spots to visit. 

The first floor bedroom, and nice large home with back patio, were a perfect fit for us! The bed was comfortable and the location was perfect for us to both explore Fremont and attend a concert at the Woodland park zoo. I'd recommend both this location and Sherry:)"
3898413,43507143,2015-08-20,23037684,Lindsey,"Our stay with Sherry was lovely. The room was fairly spacious and the house looks exactly like the pictures. It was a tiny challenge to get there with our luggage from the bus station, but it ended up working out fine. The area itself is quiet, with lots of places to wander to. We loved that Fremont was a short walk away. All in all, a great stay. Thanks Sherry!"
3898413,43688527,2015-08-21,34446848,Anna,"Sherry was such a lovely, welcoming and accommodating host- we absolutely loved our stay! Her house is gorgeous and the bed was really fab. Sherry asked our preferences for breakfast and made sure we had everything we needed. She was conversational and friendly, and had great recommendations for things to see and places to eat. Her dog Rocky is super awesome too! We felt welcomed and had just the right balance of privacy and hospitality during our stay. Thanks again Sherry!"
3898413,45371991,2015-09-02,34607664,Gillian,"Our stay was so awesome! Sherry provided us with wonderful getaway accommodation, recommendations for food in the local area, and even went out of her way to move my car after a crazy storm damaged the tree that it was parked under (with my permission, of course)!

The room was comfortable, with plenty of space to store your belongings, and oh so cute! Sherry's place is super walkable, which was our favourite part. Both Wallingford and Fremont were great to explore, and her home is just a short distance to downtown. So perfect!  I'd definitely recommend Sherry and her home for your next stay!"
3898413,45611602,2015-09-04,11477410,Rod And Theresa,Very nice home beautifully furnished. Clean comfortable and conveniently located to all the action in Fremont.  Sheri was an attentive and engaging hostess.
3898413,46127090,2015-09-08,3088906,Paul,Everything went very smoothly--we enjoyed our time at Sherry's. The neighborhood is great.
3898413,49692851,2015-10-05,44667047,Victoria,"This is my firs time with Airbnb, It's a fantastic journey in Seattle, especially by staying at such a cozy place. Sherry is a very considerate host, we were warm-welcomed by free chocolate and all kinds of beverage as well as good stuff for breakfast ( cook by ourselves). As far as a convenient location to go to University of Washington ( we even walk back to sherry's place), settle center and downtown by commuting only 25 mins approximately, 15 mins off-peak time. Besides, she has a cute dog! "
3898413,53421171,2015-11-08,477537,Jessica,Sherry was the perfect host and her house is lovely! I would definitely stay here again. Parking is easy and it's only a 12 minute drive to downtown and 5 minutes to Freemont. 
3898413,56922962,2015-12-20,22371633,Max,"Lots of privacy, very acommodating. Bed was way too soft, but that's a personal-preference thing, no hard feelings. Great stay, no regrets. Would recommend. "
6992696,37804652,2015-07-10,37371815,Jake,"The room was exactly as pictured. I also had free reign of the shared living space most of the day. The internet was fast and Xfinity was nice. 
The location is great to explore the city from because there are two different bus stops right outside the front and back doors. Matt was always polite and asked me if I needed anything. For the price, I would stay here again."
6992696,37915284,2015-07-11,37335805,Jonathan,"Matt was great! Super nice guy, really wanted to make us feel at home (and we did) and very easy going. Was very flexible about arrival time, too, and willing to let us use everything from his television to his coffee. Extra points for laying out clean towels for us (I forgot my towel, despite Douglas Adams' advice)."
6992696,38062345,2015-07-12,30677585,Jodie,Matt was super friendly and accommodating. Very helpful about the surrounding area. The location and host cannot be beat! I would certainly stay with Matt again.
6992696,38331414,2015-07-14,15198548,Eugene,Matt was great and the apartment was conveniently located. He was a great host and made me feel very comfortable. I enjoyed Belltown and Pike's Place (both were pretty easy to get to). The apartment was very reasonably priced and the bed was very clean.
6992696,42805334,2015-08-15,4377410,Tiffany,"The location was great. It is perfect for a group of friends who want to go to Belltown or Lower Queen Anne.  We were disappointed by the cleanliness. The bathroom and kitchen could really use a deep clean (tub and toilet were stained and the mirror and sink weren't super clean). I think the problem was that we booked last minute (the night before we checked in), so it may not have been enough time for Matt to really do a deep clean.  Besides the cleanliness it's an older building and there isn't much that Matt can do about it, but the carpet really needs to be replaced and the entire apartment could use a really good scrub, especially the bathroom.  Overall, I thought $199/nt + fees and taxes was too expensive for the apartment.   We had some problems with check-in, but Matt called an hour later to ensure we were able to check-in, which was really nice. "
3653575,16328820,2014-07-25,18517275,Mary,"This is our first experience with AirB&B. My 20 yr old son was heading to Seattle for a class and needed a place to stay close by, only there were few hotels in the area. So we took a chance and booked a stay with Schuyler Rogers and his girlfriend.  It was super easy to work out the details, the hosts were very quick to respond to questions.  My son came home and said, ""we should leave them a great review""...so I am.  They were very friendly and welcoming.  Also helpful when he needed some assistance. The house was nice, clean, had everything he needed, and was quiet.  The neighborhood was also quiet, safe and easy to get around and in a less hectic area than downtown Seattle.  Overall, a great experience and we are glad that it worked out so well! Highly recommend these hosts and their place!"
3653575,16587372,2014-07-29,18493309,Jim,"A very nice happy quiet place.
Nice area too.
We had the entire bottom level with walkout patio. Just like being at home!
Just like the pictures. Almost like being all by ourselves. Cool!
Nice hosts. Coming and going were very easy.
We would stay there again and again."
3653575,16935747,2014-08-04,4584603,Nancy,"Schuyler and Tara were great hosts! They greeted us with cookies, which my granddaughter loved.  The space was very comfortable and the location was great, close to shopping and restaurants and very convenient to bus line to downtown.  We had a great time! Although there was no fridge or microwave downstairs, our hosts were very friendly and encouraged us to use theirs, and offered to share their coffee with us in the morning. They also let us use their washer and dryer which was very helpful!"
3653575,17186053,2014-08-08,8290543,Lili,"Sorry for replying later, We are still traveling ... Thanks, Schuyler & Tara are great host,  they let us feel like stay at home, kitchen and laundry are open to us. It is beautiful house with a nice back yard, I love the apple tree there. "
3653575,17473466,2014-08-12,19061874,Laszlo,"This was our first time staying with AirBNB rentals, and we were little skeptical if listings were accurate. We had a really pleasant surprise! The place was really clean and neatly organized, and it's absolutely looks like the listed images. Rogers was really nice and kind. Provided us with many good tips. Unfortunately we weren't able to stay longer to enjoy the house or the city. I am sure that we'll use this rental again if it's going to be available at our next travel. We had a car and it took us about 15-20 min to get downtown. The neighborhood its quiet and lots of shops and restaurants are close by. I would highly recommend this place to couples or small families. Thank you Rogers for hosting us and being a great."
3653575,17603691,2014-08-14,15942493,Erzhuo,Schuyler and Tara are very big-hearted people. They have a homy guest room to share. You can feel comfortable to hang out in the backyard.
3653575,17967770,2014-08-19,19077042,Jay,"This was my first airbnb and I am not sure it could have gone more smoothly. Schuyler and Tara were friendly and accommodating hosts, in fact going out of their ways to find out how they could make our stay more comfortable.

The house itself was spotlessly clean and well-maintained yet felt lived-in and comfortable. They were never intrusive yet always friendly when we spoke.  Meanwhile, they lived their lives, even dog-sitting for their friend. I am not sure I could be so casual with strangers in my house, but it's obvious that Schuyler and Tara enjoy hosting. It certainly makes for a very pleasant stay.

The bed was comfy as was the living room furniture. We did not use the dart board, but we did use the excellent back yard. I told Schuyler I wanted to take it home with me, but I guess everyone has their limits. We watched a mother robin feeding her chicks and enjoyed the cool Seattle breeze. The combination tub/shower had a great stream with water hot enough to boil a lobster. There was plenty of parking out front.

This was a great stay, and I would certainly recommend it to anyone. 




"
3653575,18085149,2014-08-21,3191397,David,"Schuyler was an extremely gracious host. The space was neat and tidy, just as described and pictured. Every aspect of our stay was smooth. "
3653575,18606694,2014-08-28,15980066,Beth,"Schuyler and Tara met me at the front door and showed me the spacious downstairs rooms. There's a small refrigerator which was great for keeping yogurt for the morning, and I appreciated the bottles of water provided in the bedroom.

The neighborhood is very quiet and proved an ideal basecamp for visiting family north of Greenwood.  I was able to relax and sleep soundly both nights--no trouble getting to sleep!"
3653575,18893715,2014-09-02,4854700,Jean,"Schyler and Tara communicated conscientiously with us to ensure we arrived okay and found everything we needed.  We had 2 spacious rooms, plenty of area to put our suitcases and travel stuff.  Queen air mattress in the living space was comfortable and just right for our daughter and her 9 year old daughter.  We appreciated the small fridge for our perishables.  Both hosts are friendly and helpful, providing information on places to eat within a few blocks walk.  The home provided a quiet, peaceful place to stay after our activities in Seattle, and was nearby many of the places we wanted to see.  Would most certainly come back should we return to Seattle."
3653575,19078001,2014-09-06,9929872,Cyndy,"Met us at the door and gave us a tour..  Asked if there was anything we needed. Very friendly. The neighborhood was quiet and we felt very safe.  Is walking distance to lots of business, restaurants, etc."
3653575,20124212,2014-09-23,16968383,Seonmin,It was a spacious place to stay. We had very comfortable stay. The location is some distance from downtown however it was easy to use Uber in Seattle and a direct bus at Greenwood Ave. Schuyler and Tara are great hosts. I would stay with them again! 
3653575,30028135,2015-04-16,20616751,Tom,"We had a delightful stay with Schuyler and Tara.  Their space is exactly as pictured.  It was neat and clean and had all the amenities available.  We were very comfortable there.

Our hosts were gracious and friendly.  We were in Seattle to visit with our son, so we didn't need much advice, etc.  However, Schuyler and Tara were ever ready to help us.

I would highly recommend a stay here.  The location was perfect for us as our son lives nearby.  The host couple was really great!"
3653575,33403314,2015-05-27,29795806,Kathy,"Schuyler and Tara made my parents' first visit to Seattle lovely and comfortable. It was a spacious layout, perfect for two adults on a cross-country road trip, with the use of laundering machines to boot!
The location was also perfect, with tasty food options nearby. Definitely worth it, thank you!"
3653575,33840685,2015-06-01,10212581,Yuan,"Schuyler and Tara are great hosts! We had a smooth communication about the check-in time before we get there and Schuyler respond our messages promptly. 
The house is located in a very quiet and safe neighborhood. The room is exactly the same as the it's shown in the picture. We had everything we need in there. We had three people so Schuyler even set up an air mattress for us in advance (thank you)!! 
Tara and Schuyler gave us lots of recommendations about good cafe shops and dining places - for a city with tons of cafes and bakeries, that's really helpful! 
Thank you again for letting us stay, Schuyler and Tara!! "
3653575,34815277,2015-06-12,18587799,Bruce,"Schuyler and Tara were wonderful hosts in every way.  Arrival was easy, and the place was clean, nice and spacious.  They provided everything extra we needed during our stay including a nice air mattress for extra guests one night.  We enjoyed the private outdoor deck and beautiful backyard for dinners a couple of the nights there and the nice restaurants a few blocks away for breakfasts and dinner.  Schuyler and Tara also provided great advice on places and were fun to get to know during our week long stay for both business and fun.  I would definitely stay there again on any future trips to Seattle.    "
3653575,35232323,2015-06-16,33302750,Ziyuan,"Extremely good! Even better than the pics showed, and as comfortable and clean as we thought. My family was very happy about our first experience with airbnb at this house. This is an unforgettable experience. Thank you so much!"
3653575,35520321,2015-06-19,5574284,Marina,"We absolutely loved staying here! 
Schuyler and Tara were great host. The room was so spacious, cozy, comfortable and nicely decorated. The location was perfect, peaceful and quiet. We will definitely recommend this place to our friend visiting Seattle. 
Thank you so much!"
3653575,36811112,2015-07-01,35496247,Jeremy,"Schulyer and Tara met us when we arrived and gave us the quick tour of the accommodation. After that they were available if needed to answer any questions we had during our stay. The private bedroom and bathroom (pretty much a private floor) were perfect for our needs during our visit to Seattle. The location is great as it was a fairly short jaunt to get to downtown Seattle via car.  There were also many stores, restaurants, etc within walking distance to take care of any needs. The neighborhood itself is a nice, quiet residential location and was good to come back to after a day full of tourist activities and the crowds that come with them. I would definitely consider staying at this location again if it's available next time I'm in the area. "
3653575,37988774,2015-07-12,33693213,Atle,"Clean lower level apartment with a nice back yard. Friendly hosts, all in all a great stay. "
3653575,38682447,2015-07-17,531610,Eve,"Really enjoyed our stay at Schuyler's place. He accommodated us at the last minute and the place was private and comfortable. It is also located in a great area, close enough to walk places and easy to Uber to nearby neighborhoods like Ballard and Fremont. Definitely recommend!"
3653575,39197231,2015-07-21,10975842,Afton,"Schulyer and Tara were great hosts.  Seattle was experiencing some ""warmer than usual"" temperatures, and when I inquired about a fan, Schulyer immediately provided us with one.  The space is very comfortable and the back yard is worth it's weight in gold.  There was a mini-fridge, coffee pot and microwave for us to use with all the amenities.  The location is great with easy access to Downtown, Ballard, Freemont and just about anywhere you want to go.  I highly recommend this location. "
3653575,40138138,2015-07-28,22127269,Henk-Jan,"Spacier than expected and well equipped to stay comfortably a few days in Seattle. Good wifi speed, microwave, fridge and coffee maker. Nice sitting area. Appartment is located on walking distance from a supermarket and bus lines to the city center.
Owner was not around when we arrived, but he left clean instructions how to access both via mail and text messages. We had a great time here!"
3653575,41090840,2015-08-04,34036418,Jack,"We really enjoy the six days in Schuyler & Tara' s house, clean and cozy with beautiful backyord, two big supermakert, amazing park in foot distance. It must be the first choice in seattle next time!"
3653575,42554802,2015-08-14,34674254,Carolyn,"lovely place, very nice hosts.   I would stay again and recommend it to friends."
3653575,43374418,2015-08-19,36290852,Mark,"This was the perfect place to come to in Seattle!  Located close to my family, it was spacious, clean, and very private.  The hosts were very detached, yet responsive when needed and it was a true pleasure to stay in their home.  Everything was clean and prepared for guest's comfort and enjoyment.  Loved the ground coffer and creamer in the morning!  I would definitely recommend and return on my next trip to Seattle!"
580182,2401907,2012-09-24,2032277,Neal,"Owner is quite conscientious and accommodating and personable. He asked repeatedly if  I was comfortable. Room is on 2nd floor apart from rest of house so it feels private. Space is clean. Greenlake location is convenient and great for a morning walk/jog.

Recommended!"
580182,2830931,2012-11-07,678968,Megan,Jasen was a very hospitable and good host. 
580182,2967542,2012-11-26,3949076,Michael,We had a wonderful experience staying at Jasen's house!  It was so comfortable and Jasen was very welcoming and accommodating.  We would definitely stay there again.
580182,3077630,2012-12-12,1498807,Kayne,"Wow!  This place was cheap!  I couldn't believe I could stay in the lovely Greenlake neighborhood for so little money.  This fact makes my other complaints seem a little silly.

That having been said...

The listing said ""Entire home/apt.""  It also said ""One additional roommate lives in a basement apartment in the house.""  Those things are mutually exclusive.  The roommate's apartment does not have a separate entrance, so he does come and go through the main floor of the house.  So do his friends.  It's not a big deal, but a little unnerving because the bedroom does not have a door.  If the listing indicated this was a room in a house, and if that room had a door, this would be a non-issue.  (BTW, the roommate does seem to have his own bathroom, so you don't share that.)  (Also, he is a very nice young man who made every effort to stay out of my way.)

The listing said ""Real Bed.""  But as is evident in the photographs, the bed is a futon.  In my opinion, a futon is a real bed in Japan but not in the U.S.  And this futon is HARD.  The optional extra padding provided was not a proper mattress pad and was not adequate.  I think with a good mattress topper, this futon would be fine.

The bedroom is a reminiscent of a college apartment, but overall, this is a beautiful house.  It is also kept very clean.  If my concerns don't resonate with you, do not hesitate to stay here."
580182,3188441,2012-12-30,1680215,Ben,"Jasen was an exemplary AirBnb host. He was highly proactive and conscientious in making sure I settled in OK upon my arrival, always easy to reach, and very friendly. The house itself was beautiful, spacious, and with all amenities provided. I very much appreciated that there was easy-to-find street parking just outside, and laundry facilities as well. The room upstairs was very cozy. Will definitely be dropping Jasen a line when I need a spot in Seattle again."
580182,3458906,2013-02-02,4566215,Adam,"My stay here was great! Jasen was a very attentive host, even though he was away in Mexico when I checked in. When I arrived, everything was as described in the ad, and the house was very well kept. I did have an issue with the cable at one point, and Jasen fixed it very promptly. (He can't be held accountable for Comcast's faults!) He always let me know if he was going to need access to the house while I was there in advance, and was great at communicating with me before and after my stay. In my opinion, you can't beat this place on quality for price in Seattle. I would definitely recommend staying here to friends. "
580182,3616445,2013-02-26,470985,Hayley & Stephen,"the place was just like the pics showed. Very cute and in a great location, close to all amenities.  Jasen was quick in responding to our needs.  I would totally recommend this place to anyone who wants to be close to one of the most beautiful parts of Seattle.  Big bonus for you Raw food junkies like us is that There is also a Blendtec!"
580182,3809259,2013-03-17,5242841,Cris,"I had a great stay at Jasen craftsman house. It's clean, fully stocked and I enjoyed the kitchen a lot. Jasen was a wonderful host, extremely accomodating and easy to deal with . Its such a convenient location for us, bus no. 16 is just right in front of the house within few minutes in downtown and Green Lake area. Parking is just right in front of the house, didnt have any problem at all. And walking distance to restaurants and bar. 
I would absolutely recommend staying here and look forward to visiting again soon. Thanks Jasen.


"
580182,3998522,2013-04-02,4937348,D.,"Thank you so much Jasen! The house was really wonderful and in the best location ever. We had a fantastic time and were so grateful to have your home to spend family time in. It was perfect!
Next time we go out to Seattle, we hope we can stay again!
Take care!"
580182,4139335,2013-04-13,1238047,John,This is truly a gem because of location. We were there for work and this was ideally located to get to Fremont and easy to get to downtown as well. Very Comfortable and very clean. Starbucks is a few blocks away and restaurants are 1 block. 
580182,4243989,2013-04-22,4924013,Aaron,"This place is as nice as advertised! Very comfortable, classic Seattle home in a lovely neighborhood. Jasen's directions were clear and this made for the perfect oasis away from the hustle and bustle of downtown and the conference center. Couldn't have asked for a nicer host or home - definitely the best deal in Seattle!"
580182,4344414,2013-04-29,5777227,Jennifer,"Awesome house in an awesome location, and a great host (who we unfortunately didn't meet)."
580182,4480215,2013-05-07,5953003,Austin,"Jasen's house near green lake was the ideal spot for a relaxing weekend. The house was wonderful, clean, and was in a prime location for the outdoor activities we wanted to do. Jasen also had available a detailed house guide with multiple ideas for day plans/activities. I would recommend a stay in Jasen's home to anyone!"
580182,4597557,2013-05-14,5768617,Kirsten,"Jasen's house was easy to find, in a great location near Greenlake with lots of cafes and restaurants nearby. We didn't have a car so the bus stop across the road was very helpful - it was really easy to get in and out of town on the number 16. The house itself was clean and spacious - and Jasen has provided a good list of ideas for things to do in Seattle. He replied very quickly to all my emails and was a very helpful host... unfortunately we did not get to meet him but I would definitely stay there again!"
580182,4663483,2013-05-19,4266550,Will,"This house was beautiful and it was a privilege to stay there.  We (wife, myself, 23-month baby) stayed for 4 nights for a fun getaway in Seattle.  Wife and I took the bedroom on the main level.  Baby slept in a pack-n-play that we set up in the (totally finished) attic.  We cooked in the kitchen when not eating out, did laundry every two days, and basically were completely at home.  (The baby even liked to run laps around the house like he does at home.)  We walked to Green Lake many times to pass the time between bigger expeditions.  A pity it wasn't in our schedule to stay longer."
580182,4873868,2013-05-30,5476368,Andy,"My parents stayed at Jasen's house while in town for 8 days. What a great place for them to call home for a week!  The house was spacious, clean, comfortable and tastefully decorated.  Since it was more spacious than my own home, we had dinner there on most nights; the kitchen has all you need for cooking and eating. The location cannot be beat; the recreational opportunities of Greeen Lake (Seattle's finest park IMHO) are just a block away, and there are coffee shops and good restaurants within 1-2 blocks, an easy walk. My parents didn't hear a peep from Jasen all week; aside from remodeling work at the house next door (a temporary issue), the house was quiet. We'll be looking Jasen up again next year when my parents are back in town again.  Be sure to read to house manual, since a few of the bathroom and kitchen controls were unconventional (but very functional)."
580182,5159992,2013-06-16,250425,Andy,Beautiful home.  Very close to Greenlake park and commercial district.  Clean and attractive.  Back porch could use some attention.  Overall very satisfactory stay.  
580182,5960354,2013-07-23,1402263,Laura,The reservation was canceled 23 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
580182,6067871,2013-07-29,996403,Jonathan,"A nice house in a perfect location one block from Greenlake! Jasen was a great host, super nice guy, made sure that we were comfortable without getting in our way. House has lots of light and living room sofas are ridiculously comfortable!

Couple of minor complaints: the second bedroom is up a very steep narrow flight of stairs (too scary for our daughter), and it was super hot up there as well (although that's just Seattle summer for you). Also due to renovations the bathroom upstairs was not available as it was supposed to be.  But overall, we had a great experience!"
580182,6268863,2013-08-06,547009,Eileen,"Jasen's place was great!  The house has character and is very homey. Loved that my partner and I had a lot of space to spread out our stuff. Head's up that the master bed is on the medium-to-soft side. To be fair, I normally sleep on an extremely firm KEETSA mattress so perhaps Jasen's mattress will be fine to most readers. Jasen stayed at the bottom basement floor during our stay but we never heard him, mainly because we were out of the house during the day and we were watching Van Damme movies at night.  We especially loved the 1 block proximity to the lake which we played on every day during our stay and we loved all the awesome restaurant options around with vegetarian items on the menu.  I highly recommend the Wayward Vegan restaurant for full flavored yummy goodness.  Overall, it is really a great house at a fantastic location with a great host.  I highly, HIGHLY recommend this place ... my very first airbnb experience."
580182,7144881,2013-09-08,4276703,Greg,Amazing house close to Green Lake and just about everything else.  My family and I were relocating back to the Seattle area with a little lag time between our arrival and our move in date.  Jasen's house was a great place for us to relax before the craziness of unloading and unpacking needed to commence.  We would absolutely stay here again.
580182,7279688,2013-09-14,2049848,Kevin,"Jasen's home was a perfect setting for our mini-vacation!  My friends came from Hawai'i described it as just like being back home. Clean, comfortable and relaxing - I would stay there again in a heartbeat."
580182,7384933,2013-09-17,5310311,Dusty,"This is a fantastic large and spacious house strategically located a short walk from Green Lake. The tall ceilings, massive sofas, and open dining area make it a perfect place for entertaining a few friends or cooking a meal. Jasen did a great job of giving us all the information we needed and left us to ourselves. I look forward to coming back and staying here again."
580182,8120414,2013-10-16,8992766,James,Our stay couldn't have been better.  Jasen's home is comfortable and well appointed.  The king size bed was perfect!  Just as he described his place is conveniently located in a very walkable neighborhood close to Green Lake and several great restaurants.
580182,9347829,2013-12-23,9987379,Jessica,Thank you Jasen! We had a lovely time and appreciate all that you did for us. 
580182,9962154,2014-01-21,2111154,Peter,"Great place!!! Very close to the lake and convenient to get around.  The house was also very clean and spacious.  You do hear the dog bark once in a while from the basement but it wasn't a problem for us.  If you don't mind someone living in the basement during your stay, I highly recommend this place. I would love to come back when it's warmer in Seattle to this place. Thanks Jasen!"
580182,10678956,2014-03-03,11133723,Heather,"We had a great time at Jasen's home!  Very accommodating throughout our stay and we felt that we were able to utilize the home as our own.  Would highly recommend staying here and would consider staying again when we return to Seattle.  We walked to restaurants, bars, the lake and around the general neighborhood daily and were super pleased with the proximity.  Jasen was easily reachable and while we never saw him we did not feel abandoned in any way and his home was clean and the layout was perfect for our family.  Thanks Jasen!"
580182,11013858,2014-03-17,5762026,Rushabh,"Jasen's place is really great - beautiful house, great location. We had a fantastic time staying here. The house was really clean, in great shape, all the amenities were good. The instructions were perfect and Jasen was very communicative before and during our stay. Whenever we had questions, he responded right away. He was accommodating of our early arrival and late departure (we had a baby, it made things complex). We would definitely stay here again on our next Seattle visit.

(Note that Jasen wasn't around, so we had the house to ourselves.)"
580182,11396032,2014-04-01,11541905,Barbara,"When you stay at Jasen's, you will feel welcomed and immediately comfortable, like you are in your home away from home.  Spacious and full of light, it's got everything you'll need - first and foremost, a gracious and very responsive host in Jasen! - but also a wonderful kitchen, great appliances, including the washer and dryer, a living room you can kick back and relax in, super comfortable beds, and a dining room table that can seat six to eight people.  The location is perfect, too, close to the lake and to restaurants and cafes, to buses that will take you anywhere you want to go, or to the I5 if you want access to the greater metropolitan area.  I was visiting family in Phinney Ridge, and they were well within walking distance, but I also enjoyed just exploring the neighborhood on foot. I would highly recommend this property and its host to anyone who wants to experience the atmosphere and charm of North Seattle and accommodations with a very special vibe."
580182,11756379,2014-04-14,5310311,Dusty,"This was my second stay at this house and again it exceeded my expectations. You're in walking distance of all the things one values for a good quality of life: a large park, several diverse restaurants, coffee shops, bars, dry cleaning, barber, etc. No car required. If you're looking for ""easy living"" then this is the spot for you. My only concern is that it fills up quickly. I'll be making my reservations again soon. "
580182,12181431,2014-04-25,6313251,Jason,What a great place! So close to Green Lake with a ton of places to grab a bite or a drink. The place itself is really great and we felt at home right away. Jasen was super reponsive leading up to our stay and was there to greet is and get us settled. Everything was perfect. 
580182,12857569,2014-05-12,1814703,Emma,The place was absolutely fantastic.
580182,13401757,2014-05-27,11709114,Mark,"My husband, daughter and I had a lovely visit. Jasen's charming house is in an ideal location, just a block from Green Lake and a few blocks from coffee shops and restaurants. There's also easy access to the 5 freeway.

The house had ample space for the three of us and is very well-kept, with a nice combination of period details and modern updates. 

We truly felt at home throughout our stay. 

Thank you!"
580182,13846913,2014-06-06,7228730,Steven,"I had family in town for a few days and needed a place for them to stay that was close to where I live and convenient to the best that Seattle has to offer.  Jasen’s place was perfect.  It’s one block from Green Lake, and just a few minutes walk to some great places to eat and very typical Seattle-style coffee shops… my mom especially enjoyed Café Zoka!  The place was very homey and incredibly clean.  I would definitely recommend Jasen’s place to anyone interested in a local Seattle experience!"
580182,14081976,2014-06-11,14246278,Mary,"This is a great location and the house provides what you may need- good kitchen- large flat screen TV in comfy living room- comfortable bed.
Jasen responds quickly and is easy to work with.
We had a wonderful stay.
"
580182,14187335,2014-06-14,14550701,Staci,"I rented the house for my parents and nephew who were in town to visit UW. The house was very nice with plenty of space for 3 people.
The house is located in a great neighborhood with restaurants, coffee shops, and outdoor activities close by. My parents liked that it was easy to get over to campus and easy to access I-5.
Jasen was very responsive to my inquiry about the house availability and the rate was great. "
580182,14548480,2014-06-22,12121227,Faryn,"Jasen was great to work with throughout the entire transaction, very easy to contact.  The house was perfect for what we needed.  It is an adorable house in a beautiful area of Seattle, close to the lake and restaurants. It was perfectly clean and had everything we needed like laundry and linens.  I would come here again!
"
580182,15092125,2014-07-02,6863486,Sarah,"Jasen was very responsive and great to work with.  He has a great house in a great location, and he was even kind enough to leave suggestions for things to do around the area which was a nice touch."
580182,15310316,2014-07-07,14125943,Elaine,Jasen was quick to respond to our questions and accommodated our early arrival.  This is  a very comfortable house in a good location and it was just the right size for us.  We hope to stay at Jasen's the next time we fly out to Seattle.  
580182,15748881,2014-07-15,13418169,Julie,"Jasen's home is everything he said and more. A beautiful craftsmen house with tasteful contemporary interior design and comfortable amenities. There wasn't one thing we wished for, everything thoughtfully provided and available. Better yet, the location couldn't be beat -- one short block from Green Lake for swimming, biking, playing galore. "
580182,15937693,2014-07-18,2559567,Megan,"This is a lovely house in an amazing location for walkability & for playing at Greenlake. Jasen was easy to work with, responsive and friendly. Parking is crowded (and there were less spaces available than usual due to construction up the block), but we always found a space within a block. The house was a bit tight with our 3 young kids (2, 4, & 7 - some of whom were feeling slightly noisier & less flexible than usual) but we expected that and it all went well, overall. We had a great visit in Seattle."
580182,16226795,2014-07-23,5913089,Jeff,Jasen was a great host and his house is in an ideal location. The bus stop is just down the front steps and it is just a block away from Greenlake. The place is very comfortable and Jasen's tips for activities and food are very helpful. I definitely plan on staying here again next time we're in Seattle.
580182,16369669,2014-07-26,17829258,Joris,"We didn't meet Jason in person during our 3 day stay but he informed us by text messages and followed up everything very well. 

The house was really nice,  comfortable and clean. Also a nice location and good access to public transport."
580182,16649956,2014-07-31,12374132,Bob,"Jasen made us feel welcome right from the start. He was able to accommodate a couple of special requests for us too. The house was immaculately clean and nicely furnished. The queen bed in the master bedroom was very comfortable. The neighborhood was quiet and relaxing. Everything was ""as advertised.""  We hope to visit that area again and stay at Jasen's house."
580182,18165456,2014-08-23,14976104,Valerie,"Everything about Jasen's home was perfect for hosting my sister and her two young children.    Only a block from the lake, where the kids swam, roller bladed, and stand up paddled.  Despite other day trips to hike and kayak outside of Seattle, the kids were always clamoring to return ""home"" to the lake.   I would definitely host other out of town guests at Jasen's home.  "
580182,18398496,2014-08-26,13408701,Kyle,"Had a busy weekend in Seattle staying at Jasen's  comfortable home.  Older home with a modern mix of furnishings and a little Hawaiian attitude! (And NO old house smell which was evident in other homes rented by family) Loved it. Had everything we needed and the location is an easy walk to wherever you want to go in the Green Lake area; the lake for a walk, shopping, restaurants, you name it.  Jasen was always quick to respond to my messages and made the whole process simple. Hope to do it again!"
580182,18790940,2014-09-01,16383548,Lasetta,"Jasen was a wonderful host and his little house was beautiful....We had 17 family members, from Alaska, Idaho, Washington and Arizona, housed in 3 different locations in the area, for my daughters graduation from UW Medex PA program.  We also have several friends that live in the Seattle area and the house was a really cozy/comfortable gathering place for all.  We had a big graduation dinner for everyone Friday night and Saturday we had a birthday party's for 2 of my sisters and 1 brother there and with so many nice little sitting areas to visit a wonderful time was had by all.

Cute, accessible, handy area.  Most of us are major coffee/tea hounds and there was something for everyone in the area.  Lots of restaurants and grocery stores in a close proximity.  We also had 4 small children, 2 at our place and 2 in another location, so the wonderful parks in the area came in really really handy for moms/grandmas....BREAK TIME!!!!!(dads were great for taking the boys to the park)  

Thanks again Jasen for sharing your beautiful space with us.

Lasetta"
580182,19414367,2014-09-12,7695681,Sarah,"Jasen was great to work with!!  The house was very clean and offered many amenities.  It was a great deal and my family had a great experience of the northwest during their trip!  I would recommend this location and also recommend working with Jasen to any future airbnb renters.  It was such a treat to call this house ""home"" for a week.  Thanks so much, Jasen!"
580182,20519745,2014-09-30,7251128,Ash,"We had a great experience! Never met Jasen in person but his communication was great via email and airbnb app. The house was clean and well maintained, walking distance to tons of great food/coffee/and of course Green Lake. Id recommend to all especially those with a family. Oh and he had a big screen TV for Sunday football."
580182,22531661,2014-11-09,2278796,Mary,"House is charming, cozy and in a lovely residential neighborhood. Would be a great location for a longer stay. Two recommendations for improvements: sharper kitchen knives- all were very dull and even with the sharpener took effort to work; cotton bedding- bedding was polyester and just sticky."
580182,23124239,2014-11-23,2724239,Amy,"Jasen's home is charming, cozy, and very clean. Our preschooler declared it ""the prettiest house,"" and loved the holiday decorations. It was a great place to come home to at the end of a busy day seeing the sights in Seattle. And the neighborhood is lovely—quiet, with a playground across the street, and lots of cafes and shops to explore just a few blocks away. We didn't have time for a walk around the lake, but that's on our list for next time! 

Jasen was also very understanding when we flubbed our checkout time—we had the chance to meet him on our way out. He's a great host!"
580182,23296264,2014-11-28,22484738,Doug,"This was the perfect house for us.  We loved walking/jogging around the lake in the morning, and the shopping nearby.  Jason's house is lovely, with a completely decked out kitchen (which we used extensively), a dining room for meals and late night games and chatting, and a comfy living room.  Every room was clean and organized for guests."
580182,23676331,2014-12-08,7870598,Kathy,"The house was perfect for us.  The living room couches big and comfortable for watching TV.  The location was perfect.  Close to the lake and other places of interest for us.  the neighborhood was quiet and the beds were comfortable.
Jason quickly responded to all questions and requests.
This will be were we will hope to stay on future visits to Seattle. "
580182,24223728,2014-12-23,21266623,Danielle,"Great house and great host! 
(Positives)
Cute house, great location, fun neighborhood, plenty of parks, things to do, and a really nice host. We enjoyed the house and the location. The house is fully stocked with a great kitchen and cozy living room. We had a few friends over and didn't feel crowded and were able to cook a great meal for everyone.  

(Negatives)
Only one negative. The house is older with old fashioned crystal door knobs to all interior doors. They don't turn easily and I got stuck in the bathroom a few times. Luckily my hubby let me out. :-)

580182,24485488,2014-12-29,24274533,Deirdre,"Loved the house...its in a great location, just as pictured and Jasen was always easy to communicate with. The sheets on the bed were exceptionally soft and had a great nights sleep. A great experience!"

580182,25362337,2015-01-13,1291668,Kamal,"Our stay was very comfortable. I had my parents in town and even with them being new to town, they could venture out on their own and there was plenty to do right in the neighborhood.  Jasen left details on what to do, the house was clean and spacious. Highly recommend. "
580182,25417944,2015-01-15,25474192,Susan,"We very much enjoyed staying at Jasen's lovely house - a block from Green Lake, and the house had everything imaginable for our use.  Comfortable, clean, with plentiful parking in the area.  We would highly recommend this house as a great airbnb choice.  We would be happy to stay here again.  Thank you, Jasen!"
580182,26359459,2015-02-10,5091458,Lesley,"The house is charming, nicely appointed and the neighborhood was great! We had wanted to try something in Seattle convenient to where our daughters lived and worked. Jasen's place was perfect and we immediately turned booked another week there."
580182,27384644,2015-03-03,23788469,Ann,"Jasen met us at the house when we arrived and showed us around. When he needed to have some work done in the basement he planned to have it done when we were away from the house.  The house is very comfortable and as described.  The neighborhood is pleasant, quiet and only a block from Green Lake.  Thank you, Jasen!"
580182,27725628,2015-03-10,5091458,Lesley,Another great stay!
580182,28466768,2015-03-24,21772000,Catherine,Jasen's home is in an awesome location just steps from the lake. The space is as advertised with a well stocked kitchen and comfortable living space. I enjoyed my stay in Seattle!

580182,29683520,2015-04-11,29320899,Wendy,"We had a great three days in Jasen's house. He responded quickly to our initial request and questions. And he has made the house very welcoming to guests with all needs met. We are very familiar with the area and I can say this spot was fantastic. We loved walking to the lake, coffee, great breakfast spots, sushi and pubs. And now the new PCC also close by. We will definitely stay here again when we want to be near Greenlake. Thanks!"
580182,30090741,2015-04-17,797771,Limin,"Lovely house with perfect location!

Only a really short distance to green lark park and cafe.
Definitely will stay here next time in Seattle!"

580182,30930986,2015-04-29,15912168,Jonathan,"Jason's place is a great Seattle bungalow in Green Lake--tons of charm and nicely upgraded and comfy (beds and all).  My wife and 2 year old and I booked it for a week and had a blast.  As a former Seattle-ite I knew the location I wanted-- and this was spot-on.  Green Lake is 2 blocks away and restaurants, cafes, shopping--all you need-- minutes walking distance away.  Also Fremont is very close which was a plus.  Great accommodations, great host (Jasen) made him self totally available if we needed him--which we didn't b/c everything was perfect.  I will def be staying here again when I go back!!  "
580182,31454034,2015-05-05,5272118,Clifford,"Jasen's lovely Craftsman Home was a home-away-from-home for us that is in fact a bit nicer than our actual home.  My 88-year-old mother, my sister, my wife and I had a really nice stay while we attended family celebrations in Seattle.  The house is located in a really lovely neighborhood.  There are beautiful hard-wood floors.  It's a spacious, gorgeous place.  

Every day, at least two of us would go for a walk around nearby Green Lake.  The excellent PCC Market (which is a co-op and also unionized) is just on the other side of the lake and a nice, invigorating walk away.  

On a couple of evenings, we watched DVD movies on the big-screen TV in the living room and there was plenty of room on the sofas for each of us to sprawl out comfortably.  

The well-equipped kitchen is really nice.  We prepared a number of meals there.  We didn't take advantage of Jasen's great selection of Asian condiments, but would certainly do so for a future trip.  

The bed in the master-bedroom is super comfortable!

Jasen is a very nice, engaging fellow.   

Staying here was the icing on the cake of a really great visit to Seattle.  "

580182,32572833,2015-05-19,32014093,Michael,My first experience with Airbnb was at Jasen's beautiful home. Stayed with my wife and 3 kids. 
580182,33464790,2015-05-28,5381410,Aaron,Jasen's place was great. It was clean and in an amazing location. We felt so comfortable there and so nice to be able to have our pooch with us. Thanks Jasen we will definitely recommend your place for others! 
580182,33924341,2015-06-02,31920317,Mark,"Jasen did a good job of being very responsive.  He intended to meet us at the house, but we arrived after 9:30 PM so he was understandably not available."

580182,35760008,2015-06-21,18837521,Matt,"Clean, nice, and comfortable...look forward to staying at Jasen's place again in the future. Thx."
580182,35969240,2015-06-23,25750902,Joey,Overall is good. Great neighborhood and extreme close to the lake. Had a little little miscommunication with Jasen. But it worked out. The only drawback is some of the furniture in the house are old and does-not-clean. 
580182,36284001,2015-06-27,634043,Tucker,Could not have asked for a better stay! The house was spacious and very clean and had everything we needed for a 4-night stay. Jasen was friendly and very accommodating -- even when we had a booking conflict with dates. The location was superb! Absolutely the best neighborhood we came across in Seattle -- tons of families (and dogs) roaming around beautiful Green Lake ... plus an array of great restaurants. Our stay was in late June (notably one of the warmest periods during the year) and we were still reasonably comfortable without the house having AC downstairs-- just opened a few windows. You won't find a better deal!
580182,37038912,2015-07-04,5896110,Nancy,"Jasen's home provides us with one of our favorite vacation spots ever! We have two daughters in Seattle, and we have been there many times, but this is our first stay in the Green Lake area. I cannot recommend Jasen's home enough! We spent our morning a pushing the stroller with our new granddaughter around Green Lake, an absolutely gorgeous 2.5 mile walking path. There are many coffee shops within a few blocks of the house, and the Java was enjoyed on the daily stroll. I ran around the lake every day, and my husband and I swam across it twice. The lake is so clean! We also rented paddle boards, kayaks, and peddle boats on the lake. We picnicked often, and with Jasen's home only one block from the lake, we could venture back and forth to the park with great ease. There are bars, restaurants, and hot yoga venues right near the house. If I could own a dream house, it would be Jasen's. The living room couches are comfortable and perfect for naps. There's a flat screen tv, but we never turned it on. We were too busy loving the deck. The kitchen is simple, yet completely well-equipped. The master bedroom is rift off the kitchen, and there are two sleeping areas upstairs. Jasen communicated clearly, professionally, and kindly. I hope to be able to stay at his place again. "
580182,37356191,2015-07-06,35525058,Tianquan,"Jasen was very responsive since my reservation. Checking in is easy and smooth. The neighborhood is close to UW and Green lake, very quite and convenient. He put up a very nice guidance for a 3 day stay, recommending restaurants and things to do. The house is old, but decored nicely and kept very clean. Four of us stay there for two nights, and really enjoyed it!"
580182,38854490,2015-07-19,15104804,Adele,Jasen’s house is very comfortable and has everything you need. The bedrooms are a very good size and the kitchen has what you need to make great meals. We had great communication with Jasen as well. The location of the house near Green Lake is wonderful and there is a lot to do in the area. My family had a great time while we were in the Seattle area for a baseball tournament. 
580182,39722921,2015-07-26,22930677,Suzanne,"Home was very clean and inviting.  There were plenty of towels and we enjoyed coffee on the back deck.  The home is very close to Green Lake.  We walked to the lake, rented a canoe and watched our grand niece and nephew play at the playground.  Home is also very close to the bus route and it was easy for our son to get around town.  My husband loved having lunch at the Butcher and the Baker.  Said it was the best meal in Seattle.
"
580182,43676974,2015-08-21,19863380,Sean,"My wife and I took our young son to Seattle for his second birthday and couldn't have been happier with Jasen's house. The house itself was extremely clean and inviting, but the true treasure was the location. Green Lake was literally a two minute walk away, Woodland Park Zoo was less than a ten minute drive, and the aquarium and Pike's Place were under twenty minutes. In addition, there was a Peet's coffee just a few short blocks away and there were numerous restaurants within a short distance.  

From the moment we contacted Jasen about booking, he was insanely easy to get a hold of and saw to it that our arrival was extremely smooth and our stay was amazing. 

My only regret was leaving our bike's at home, as this was an urban oasis for bike enthusiasts. 

Thanks, Jasen!"
580182,44630949,2015-08-28,30378889,Kathy,Great house and location. Check in:checkout easy.  House in a great neighborhood and very clean with full compliment of amenities. We visit family in Seattle and would definitely return to this property.
580182,45936549,2015-09-07,35158448,Joanne,"From the beginning to the end, Jasen was a very responsive host and very easy to work with.  We LOVED the house, the decor, the use of space that made the house a warm and welcoming home for our family of five.  The location couldn't have been more perfect for our extended weekend trip to visit Seattle.  It was centrally located--close by downtown, ferry terminal, Pike's Market and our favorite new place in Seattle, the Green Lake district.  We walked almost every morning with our cup of coffee, we kayaked and paddle boated, we were spoiled by practically having the whole lake to ourselves when we boated.  The kids had a blast!  We reluctantly left Seattle and would stay here again when we return."
580182,46728240,2015-09-13,16728079,Josh & Katie,"Jasen and his property manager Hayley were outstanding! While we did not get the opportunity to personally meet them, they were welcoming, responsive, compassionate, and dedicated to ensuring we had a terrific experience. Everything is well executed with no surprises. The home is exactly as it appears in the photos, and its location in the Green Lake neighborhood makes this listing spectacular. Green Lake is active, fun, beautiful, and an excellent place to stay on a trip. The chance to stay in this home, in this neighborhood, is exactly what makes Airbnb so fantastic."
580182,54037923,2015-11-15,48113025,Lesley,Jasen and his property manager Hayley were excellent with communication making our experience easy and comfortable. The house itself is very cute and cozy. We actually found it to be even more charming than the pictures indicated! Its in a great location for walking to coffee shops and restaurants. We hope to be able to come back next time we are having a Seattle family gathering! Great experience! 
580182,54460454,2015-11-20,4010308,Jen,My mother and I had a fabulous time at Jasen's home.  Jasen was very quick to respond to any questions I had and the check- in and check-out was very easy.  The location makes it easy to get around the cool neighborhoods in Seattle as well as taking a walk around the lake.  I highly recommend this place and I will sure to stay here again when I come back to Seattle!  
580182,54827749,2015-11-23,6377974,Susan,"The listing description was true to the photos. Jasen made us feel welcome and at home instantly! We loved our stay for many reasons. First, the home isn't just an airbnb home, it is an actual home with real furniture and amenities. Second, it is literally 1 block from the lake, coffee shops, and food! No need to get into your car to get your morning caffeine. The neighborhood is beautiful and quiet. We would be happy to stay here again."
580182,55094169,2015-11-28,30103862,Razia,We stayed at Jason's home for 5 nights during the Thanksgiving break.    The home is so cozy and bright.  It had everything we needed to relax with our family and enjoy our Thanksgiving break.  The beds are comfy and bathroom is so cute.  The decor is very welcoming with a large TV and comfy couches.  The kitchen is fully stocked and we cooked a few dinners while we were here.  The location was great as well.  Walking distance to Greenlake area. We took daily walks around the lake which is just across the street from this house. Jason had a guest book with detailed instructions and recommendations on places to eat.  This was very helpful.   We ate at Spuds and had the best fish and chips every.  We would recommend this place and plan to stay here again.
580182,55818239,2015-12-06,150579,Jacquelyn,Jason's place is great! Really fantastic location and super comfortable space and furnishings. I'd highly recommend staying here if you're looking for something comfy in the Greenlake neighborhood!

1159111,5283406,2013-06-22,411817,Christopher,"Stayed here on a recent work trip and it was the perfect place for my travel. Very central to good food, transportation and a great neighborhood. The apartment was clean and all essentials for living a normal life. Great place and highly recommended."
1159111,10673713,2014-03-03,212696,Sara,"The apartment was just perfect for me and my two colleagues in town for a conference. The distance to the convention center was easily walkable and yet the location of the apartment had the feel of being in a more intimate neighborhood (with everything you could possibly want or need within a stone's throw). My only regret is not having more time to explore. 

Christine was a dream host. An excellent communicator and very helpful during the process of arranging our stay. The apartment had everything we needed and more. There were many thoughtful touches, such as big down comforters on the beds, extra towels & blankets, soaps, kitchenette, teas/coffees and a binder full of information about the apartment and area. Staying in the apartment--so comfortable and bright-- versus a stuffy downtown hotel was the best decision. Thank you Christine! "
1159111,11579131,2014-04-08,1193426,Patrick,"I love this building. It has been carefully tended, and restored and feels more like a village than an apartment building. The apartment was very clean and stocked with most everything you could need. Christine and Johnny were incredibly welcoming and helpful.You will feel more like a member of the family than a short-term tennant. Be warned though, because of the neighborhood, things can get a little crazy on the weekends and there is a lot of activity and noise on the street. "
1159111,11803687,2014-04-15,12291736,Laura,"Spacious, comfortable apartment with everything you need for a fun experience in a lively Seattle neighborhood.  Don't forget to turn on the sound machines (and the fan in the master bedroom), because the street noise can be loud especially on a Friday night."
1159111,12271155,2014-04-28,11729296,Natalie,"Lovely apartment and excellent host! Christine was available to answer all of my questions and was extremely accommodating. Only annoyance is the street noise on the weekends from the nearby bars, but the apartment has a white noise machine and a fan to help cancel out the noise! 

The apartment is close to downtown Seattle and just a $10 cab ride from the Space Needle. Christine has excellent suggestions for restaurants, and if you look up bus schedules you can easily get anywhere she recommends. 

DEFINITELY go to the Wandering Goose for brunch. "

The apt was fine, though on a busy street which was fairly noisy over the weekend. The neighborhood is right on the south end of Capitol Hill, with tons of restaurants, bars and clubs nearby. And while we didn't feel unsafe, the boisterousness and plethora of homeless folks was a bit disconcerting to our kids. Also, the smells from the Thai restaurant downstairs tended to permeate. Definately a great place for college kids and young adults; maybe not so much families with kids."

1159111,19123656,2014-09-07,5066207,Stacey,"The place was nothing too fancy but cute with a great bay window overlooking a happening street corner. We had some problems with the beds that were apparently from the previous guests but made for some rough nights of sleep, unfortunately. The St Johns staff did what they could so as long as that gets fixed I'd recommend them, especially for the price. "
1159111,19363041,2014-09-11,12970491,Brunno,"Close to bars (95 Slide is awesome if you're looking for a place to watch sports), restaurants, arcades, pharmacies, food markets (QFC right across the street), barber shops, stores, you name it. I spent more than 20 days doing everything by car, so it was really good to walk a little bit. Even the Pike Place Market is close enough (15 minute walk).

Besides the location, the apartment is cosy, fully equipped and very clean. Christine was unavailable at the time, but John took care of everything. It was fun to get the key and the parking (email hidden), it made us feel like James Bond or something like it.

We had a great time. If we return to Seattle, we already know where to stay. Thank you, Christine and John."

Johnny, the building manager, was very flexible in letting my parents and I check in early after our early flight.  The neighborhood has lots of new trendy apartment buildings and shops, so this is a great place for urbanites or young professionals to stay.  There is a community college nearby with a constant flow of students wandering around, which gives the neighborhood a good youthful vibe.  "
1159111,28266673,2015-03-21,27710249,Sibo,"Nice houses, nice host, but there r only 2 bedrooms for 4 people! So one of us must stay in sofa for nights"
1159111,28775086,2015-03-30,4427109,Andres,"Wonderful, cozy apartment. Three flat screen TVs with cable, towels and linens provided, no problems checking in or out. Highly recommended."
1159111,30659451,2015-04-26,23983154,John,Fantastic location! The apartment was very nice and perfect for all of us. (4 adults and 2 kids). Johnny (apartment manager) was very nice and accommodating. Having a grocery store just across the street was a plus. 
1159111,33256491,2015-05-26,22605159,William,"The place was exactly as listed and our group enjoyed the prime location during our stay! We were close to the active Capitol Hill area and were a quick downhill bikeride away from Pike Place Market! 

I would recommend Christine's place to everyone for a trip to Seattle."
1159111,33521216,2015-05-29,26185752,Sara,"The apartment was exactly as described, and we had a great time!"
1159111,35302424,2015-06-17,31586714,Matt,"Great location, great apartment!"
1159111,36030545,2015-06-24,31555502,인환,"Very good to stay, and enjoyed very much ,"
1159111,38097128,2015-07-13,26438677,Martha,The brochures listing area places to eat and things to do was great. It was nice to be able to walk downtown and to Pikes Market. The downside to the location is that there are several bars in the area so it is really loud at night. Thankfully there were window unit air conditioners to muffle the noise   
1159111,50657341,2015-10-13,41462275,Allie,"This was our first time doing AirBnB and in Seattle- and both did not disappoint! From the booking process to picking the keys up everything was smooth sailing! Christine was very prompt in replying to my numerous emails, and gave us some helpful tips re getting from the airport etc. The apartment was exactly as described - as I said this being my first time using AirBnB I didn't know what to expect- but everything was provided that you could have wanted during a stay/just as you get in a hotel! I was a bit apprehensive about the 'street noise' as a few other reviewers had commented on it, but it wasn't an issue- yeah it was a bit noisy on Fri/Sat eve but it didn't go on too late and was to be expected in this lively part of town! Lots of great bars and food places within walking distance, and the main attractions etc are also with walking distance ( although I think I have walked more during this trip than in any other US city!). Overall a very positive experience and I would highly recommend this place as a great home from home to stay at! Thanks!!"
1159111,51711434,2015-10-24,41658866,Sarah And Jeremy,"We had a wonderful stay! Christine was a great host. She was very welcoming and walked us through the check in and check out. The apartment was even better than described. The living room had a door from the hallway, so those who went to bed early were not disturbed by the noise. As warned, the neighborhood was a little noisy on the weekend evenings. If you are a light sleeper, I do recommend earplugs. 
The best part is the neighborhood! Very walkable, tons of delicious food places, music venues, and public areas. Have fun!"
1159111,52685286,2015-11-01,41864910,Luciano,Our experience being at this apartment was great. Clean and organized. Christine support was great and Johnny also helped a lot. Highly recommend it.
1159111,55359580,2015-12-01,7940872,Jonathan,"Christine's house location is wonderful, just near the downtown, very easy to go anywhere you want. The house is clean and warm, with adequate supply of utensils, great house!"
6810430,35276765,2015-06-16,35672493,Megan,"Anna and the West Seattle Haven were wonderful! We were welcomed right in and felt very comfortable in the space. The place had everything we needed-a comfy bed, a nice bathroom, and the bonus of the kitchenette/seating area. My boyfriend was flying out of SeaTac the next day and this location was perfect.  It was a nice short drive to Alki beach in the evening to enjoy the sunset and the commute to the airport in the morning was nice and quick.  Since we were the lucky first guests, Anna went out of her way to ask for our feedback and make sure that everything is great for future guests. Thank you so much, Anna! "
6810430,35516031,2015-06-19,16744451,Jean Elizabeth,"Anna's place is small but charming. She has done so much to make it feel like home. The bed is comfortable and has lots of pillows and extra blankets. The water pressure is great and the towels are really nice. She and her adorable son Charlie came to greet us as did their very cute kitty. When we noticed that there were no sponges for us to clean our dishes, Anna brought us an assortment of cleaning sponges and even offered to wash our dishes for us! This is a great space for a small family."
6810430,35730972,2015-06-21,32677425,Jerry,"Anna has a really sweet place is West Seattle. The daylight basement is clean, fresh and modern. The kitchen and living area is big enough to relax and cook real meals in for when you don't want to eat out on the town. The neighborhood is quiet and off the beaten path. Like most areas around Seattle, it's a quick trip to get back to the heart of the city."
6810430,35761760,2015-06-21,580405,Sarah,The host canceled this reservation 73 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
6810430,35972874,2015-06-23,232251,Sally,We love Anna's place! It's  a fabulous value. It's totally clean and stocked with all the right stuff. Nice little backyard area. Fabulous bed too. We're staying again! 
6810430,36446330,2015-06-28,232251,Sally,"Really great spot!! Clean, easy, comfy bed and all you need. Amazing value! "
6810430,39296470,2015-07-22,35641287,Dianne,"I feel so lucky to have found such a perfect spot for the month I spent in Seattle visiting and helping my 93 year old father. 
Anna, her folks, and her little boy are lovely people and they went out of their way to make me feel at home. It was so much better than staying in a hotel. There is a big comfy king size bed, full bath, kitchenette, and sitting room. I can't say enough about the convenience of being able to eat in, and with the big windows I was able to stay cool during a record-breaking Seattle heat wave.
The convenience of having 2 bus lines less than a block away, meant I was able to get away without renting a car for my long visit.
I would be more than happy to stay again during my next trip to visit my family."
6810430,40115293,2015-07-28,5611376,Vivian,It was a pleasant stay. Beds were good and everything was clean. Thank you for having us. 
6810430,40470123,2015-07-31,9878893,Anna,"Nice private space in a great part of Seattle.  We were a tiny bit cramped, but that was our own fault for showing up with an extra person at the last minute--which Anna graciously allowed and worked out great in the end.  Everything we needed was available--thanks for the coffee, tea bags, and milk, which saved us from having to run to the store when we arrived in the middle of the night!
Though we did not meet Anna, she always responded quickly and was very helpful in every way.  Highly recommend her MIL space, probably best suited to couple or family with child."
6810430,40756856,2015-08-02,17785626,Colleen,"I made this booking for a friend, and unfortunately some crossed wires resulted in my friend not making it. Anna was very gracious about the mix up and checked to make sure everyone was ok. "
6810430,41971345,2015-08-10,11345544,Ashliegh,We loved this place and would stay again! It has convenient access and a private entrance with parking in the alley. We were very comfortable and loved that she accommodates late arrivals. Very prompt responses to questions. 
6810430,42210925,2015-08-11,19306890,Kathleen,I loved Anna's place. It's as clean and well appointed and peaceful as the pictures paint it to be.   We have a car so it was very easy to reach and very handy to all parts of Seattle.  She was very responsive and helpful and even had coffee in the cupboard so I could make some java in the morning.  What a lovely and helpful surprise. Would stay here again in a heartbeat.
6810430,42351457,2015-08-12,38409867,Robert,"We loved Anna's place
Everything was as described Great bathroom and a very comfortable bed
  It was a private self-contained little apartment
 It was just what we needed
 We met Anna the next morning as we were leaving
  I would recommend staying here
"
6810430,42496714,2015-08-13,7459702,Katherine,Anna's communications regarding the space were professional and comprehensive.  The apartment was neat and clean and offered all of the amenities advertised.  
6810430,43244772,2015-08-18,5717049,Colman,"Anna made us very welcome - we arrived late due to bad traffic and weather and it was no problem - the apartment was just as expected, very comfortable beds and good cooking facilities.  The neighbourhood was quiet but reasonably well connected by bus to downtown, there's a nice park just 10 minutes walk south and it was easy getting to the house from I-5"
6810430,43629813,2015-08-21,14566876,Rose,Anna was very welcoming and gave us a full tour of the available amenities. Loved staying in this basement suite! The keyless coded entrance was also very convenient as we had several group members coming and going at different times. 
6810430,44121571,2015-08-24,9812979,Danielle,Anna's place was perfect for my family of three. We had plenty of room and the beds were very comfy! Her place was in an ideal location for us since we wanted to go downtown to sight-see but also wanted to be close to the airport for our very early departure. Anna was very welcoming and her son was adorable. We would definitely stay again! 
6810430,44307134,2015-08-25,34924619,Zhi Lin,"We did not manage to meet Anna but she gave us directions to her place. Her family lives on the top level and the entry through the guest house is through the back of her house and a gravel road for cars to drive through. It may be confusing initially as our GPS directed us to the front of the house and her neighbours kindly showed us to the back. For guests traveling without a car, there is a bus stop nearby which can take you to a nearby neighbourhood mall in 20 minutes so her place is quite conveniently located. Her house is also well stocked with tea, coffee and even mineral water for her guests in her fridge. Anna was quick to respond when we needed to check in even though we were delayed from our function in the morning. Thanks Anna!"
6810430,44733319,2015-08-28,23533320,Jose,"Anna's place was great! My parents and I were visiting from out of town and Anna's bnb was the first to catch our eyes. She was very responsive and polite in her acceptance and while we only met her once she was welcoming and friendly. The space was amazing for our three night stay, we were conviently located just outside of downtown to sightsee and if we wanted to stay in we were able to do so while cooking a home cooked meal with all the kitchen supplies provided in the suite! I would highly recommend staying with Anna if you get the chance. Thanks for the hospitality!  "
6810430,45520111,2015-09-03,1578852,Della,"Anna's home was clean and comfortable. We only stayed for 1 night as we were passing through Seattle. We worried that temp would be too cold for our baby at night but woke up to central heating that Anna had running. The home is about 15-20 min to d/t and to the airport with some minor Seattle traffic. You must have a car to stay here b/c it's further from food, the hustle and bustle and the normal toutist attractions."
6810430,46102958,2015-09-07,18364278,Karen,"It is like described , really nice apartment to stay , we enjoyed our stay ! "
6810430,46545991,2015-09-11,39485950,Daniel,"We didn't really meet Anna, but her home is very clean and comfortable. It is well stocked with tea and even baking supplies. All in all, it was very no hassle. She gave us directions to the property and info on how to get in. "
6810430,46942351,2015-09-14,42336024,Tara,"Thank you for a wonderful stay! We appreciated the tasteful decor and array of organic teas waiting for us on arrival. The bed was comfortable and large, and everything was well laid out. Our only sour note was the shortage of hot water one morning--next time we will communicate our schedule to avoid a cold shower. "
6810430,47509183,2015-09-19,42493803,Brian,"We stayed at Anna's apartment for almost a week. The location is really convenient, there is a bus stop just 2 blocks away that will take you right to downtown Seattle. There is private driveway parking and a separate entrance. 

The accommodations were spacious and comfortable. It was nice to have laundry facilities available upon request. We didn't interact directly with  Anna but her dad was very friendly and helpful."
6810430,47767588,2015-09-21,42635850,Barbara,"This apartment is as lovely as described by Anna! It's roomy, comfortable and quiet. There's easy and private parking off the street. I will stay there again!"
6810430,48138280,2015-09-23,10022856,Chris & Cassy,We would be happy to stay here again. We really liked that the space was a separate apartment with a private entrance and a coded entry. The apartment was clean and very comfortable and we liked that it was close to the bus stop.
6810430,48426649,2015-09-26,12291736,Laura,"Anna was super flexible (first we thought we were going to be early, and she made arrangements to accommodate us; and then we were late given a luggage disaster at the airport, and she offered her washer to us).  The apartment has everything you need with a very comfy bed.  The neighborhood seemed safe and it was easy to access from the main highway into town."
6810430,48907686,2015-09-29,3290055,Rodney,"We enjoyed our stay in Anna 's home. It was nice and quiet with plenty of room for the 4 of us.  The location is convenient for access to the city, airport, shops, etc Thanks Anna."
6810430,49164296,2015-10-01,6884566,Joel,We didn't meet Anna in this trip but she was very informative and accommodating.  The house was really nice and clean and perfect for my family as they spent their last night in Seattle! Thanks a million Anna :)
6810430,49881246,2015-10-07,9508575,Frank,Anna's place we comfortable and we had a great time in the space. Convenient location to many parts of the city. Would definitely recommend!
6810430,50934673,2015-10-16,39789118,Steve,"We didn't meet anna, but all the details were given in good time and everything worked as it should. There is a parking space, but we were on the train.  If that will be you, the 125 bus goes from 3rd and Columbia downtown, get off at 16th and Kenyon. About 25 monte journey.  All fine with the place."
6810430,51528427,2015-10-21,12165240,Claire,"We did not meet Anna, although we would have liked to make a personal connection with her.  "
6810430,52394779,2015-10-29,38395542,Sarah,"We had a lovely stay at Anna's West Seattle Haven. The neighborhood is quiet and everyone we met during our stay was very friendly. Our daughter enjoyed the local parks and our quick jaunts into Downtown Seattle, just 20 minutes away. This is a great place to stay if you have little ones -- the apartment is roomy enough that they have space to play, and they can have their own little bed (there's also plenty of room for a pack-n-play). The kitchen has just enough space to whip up little meals, so long as you won't need an oven. The space was warm and cozy -- despite the chill outside, we were very comfortable in-doors. I would be pleased to stay here a second time if my family visited Seattle again."
6810430,52855380,2015-11-02,27540688,Rachel,"My boyfriend Patrick and I had a great stay at Anna's home. While I never met Anna, Patrick met her briefly when she ran down a steamer for him to use on a shirt he forgot to iron for the wedding we attended. Thanks Anna for saving the day! Her home was comfortable and private. It had everything we needed for the weekend. I would highly recommend her place to any Airbnb adventurer."
6810430,53129695,2015-11-05,24802956,Tian,"My girlfriend and I had an excellent stay at the West Seattle Haven. We did not meet Anna during our stay, but the instructions were very clear and we enjoyed our time. The bed is super comfortable and is a king size! The apartment is also spacious. The neighbourhood is very suburban but easy to get around to the rest of the city if you have a car. Overall, excellent experience. "
6810430,54319971,2015-11-18,43879762,Dorothy,Spacious and private. Not a bad choice if you have a kid or kids.
6810430,54767670,2015-11-23,48364494,Mitch,"Anna was very sweet.  Met her while she was out walking with her son who is adorable.  
The MIL unit was perfect.  The bed was extremely comfortable. The kitchen was perfect for a small meal to be prepared.  
Very happy with the visit. 
"
6810430,54978973,2015-11-27,14256584,Wei,My father and I stayed at Anna's for 3 nights. I really like her apartment. We have more than everything we need. The kitchenette was fantastic so we cooked sometimes light dinner. The location is only 1 minute away to the bus stop so it's quite convenient if you don't drive like us. QFC is not far and downtown is only 20 minutes ride by bus. It's quite warm during night with the air conditioner on. I cannot recommend more if you like private space to yourself. I checked in very early as my flight arrived in Seattle at 7:00am. And Anna was very kind and let us check in much earlier than normal check in time. I really appreciate it.
6810430,55582663,2015-12-02,30785262,Rosey,We enjoyed West Seattle Haven. It was clean and the beds were comfortable.  It was a quiet neighborhood and wonderful to have the parking and private entry-a great place to slip away from the city to. It is right on a main bus line into the city as well. 
6810430,55791782,2015-12-06,42635850,Barbara,Anna always makes us feel welcome by answering our texts immediately and taking care of our requests. She has coffee available along with cream and sugar for mornings to add to our day. We will be back again!
7517215,42960084,2015-08-16,12961214,Linda,Shannon's place was great! Adorable and quiet. The lake is right across the street and it's very beautiful. Only slight hiccup was there didn't seem to be wifi provided. But overall still a great experience!
7517215,43304307,2015-08-18,40654276,Wayne,"The Basement accomadations were very nice, clean and private with a ton of room. The neighborhood was very charming and we really enjoyed the lake. "
7517215,49949945,2015-10-07,3870925,Daniell,"Great stay in a basement apartment, loved the location on the Lake. Bed was comfortable and the bar with stools was great for pizza and take-out."
8687716,50707141,2015-10-13,12862957,Laura,A beautiful home and I would gladly stay again when I visit Seattle next. The accommodations matched what is advertised but still found a way to surprise and delight. Rooms and common areas are spacious and worked for our needs. The garage is a bit narrow and would suggest parking on the street. My work colleague enjoyed the neighborhood and staying in a central area of Seattle.
8687716,51479836,2015-10-20,45243056,Nicole,"The property posting description was very accurate.  The property was clean and spacious.  We had the option to check in early which was great since we arrived a few hours early.  The beds were very comfortable, if not better than four stars hotels that we have frequently visited.    Downtown is only a 5-10 drive away and there are many restaurants around the area.  

The host was very prompt in responding to our questions and Mary was extremely helpful with following up.   I don't have anything negative to say about the property.   We have extremely enjoyed our stay and would definitely come back. 

Just an FYI: The garage can only fit a compact car; however there are plenty of parking on the side of the streets.   Also there is no AC but for Seattle weather in October we didn't it.  There's a fan in every room if you need it.  "
6364549,32424264,2015-05-17,552898,Aaron,Everything wast as described and I had a great stay. The location was perfect!
6364549,32640068,2015-05-19,33111461,David,"Stayed here for one night and loved every bit of it.  Anthony met me at the exact time he promised and provided a parking spot, which was very nice.  It was only a 15min walk to Pike place, even less to great restaurants and bars in Belltown.

The apartment was clean and the bed and couch were comfortable.  Had a late flight the next day and Anthony let us stay no questions asked as he did not have anyone staying the next day

The rooftop is great and has gorgeous views of the sound, downtown and the space needle.

I would recommend this to anyone staying in downtown!"
6364549,33398339,2015-05-27,9729231,Kason,"The apartment was fantastic! Every morning my wife and I walked to Pike Place Market for coffee. And there were plenty of restaurants around us to check out. The roof deck was the perfect picturesque spot to chill out after a day of walking. The apartment was great. Clean and well equipped. And Anthony was great! He left us a bottle of wine, which was fantastic after the flight from Texas! He even mailed us some clothes that we left at his apartment. I can't say enough good things about our experience."
6364549,34231020,2015-06-06,33316308,Kristina,Anthony was a great host.  Quick to respond to texts and left great recommendations. The apartment was walking distance to Pike Place and the Space Needle  The view from the roof was amazing!! We loved staying here!
6364549,36686440,2015-06-30,28334129,Brooke,"Anthony's apartment was in the perfect location. Halfway between the space needle and pike place market, I was able to walk pretty much everywhere and explore the city. Anthony also left a bottle of wine which I enjoyed on his apartment's roof deck which included views of the space needle and the puget sound. Anthony was very flexible with check in and check out times which helped to accommodate my later flight. Highly recommend this as a place to stay :). I found some of the great things to do in Seattle include: hiking rattlesnake ledge (slightly outside the city), kayaking on lake union, brunch at the space needle, chihuly gardens, pike place market, the underground tour, the Ferris wheel, and taking the ferry to bainbridge island for great views of the city. "
6364549,37857853,2015-07-11,16033103,Thomas,"Great location. With the Space Needle, Pike Place and so much more in walking distance this place is ideal. For anything further out, there is easy access to public transport to get around as well. The immediate neighborhood itself was nice and clean and we had no concerns getting around night or day.

The studio was spacious and comfortable (if a little hot with no air con - but we were there during an unusually hot period for Seattle and a fan was enough at night).

I didn't get to meet Anthony in person but he was quick to respond to questions and provided a lock box to collect the key so had no issues checking in."
6364549,38713293,2015-07-18,33213508,Robert,"Excellent location in the Central area (downtown) of Seattle and very close to many things to do.  Anthony's condo was very comfortable, clean, well maintained.  He did everything to make us feel welcomed and comfortable.  The price was very reasonable and an excellent value.  I recommend it to anyone and hope to visit again."
6364549,39927828,2015-07-27,5982347,Shay,"Never met him, bur the description was accurate, and the apartment was even bigger than what was seemed in the pictures.
Great location also"
6364549,40628097,2015-08-01,34372814,Cherisse,"Our stay at Anthony's apartment was amazing! Absolutely perfect location, the apartment was comfortable and has everything you'd need, check in/out is seamless. Rooftop space provides some great views and we had a really great stay. Thanks Anthony for sharing your space and providing everything we needed! "
6364549,41939193,2015-08-10,32382138,Kevin,Anthony was excellent with keeping in touch. The week prior to our arrival he contacted me to provide instructions on how navigate to his Studio. The neighbor was is great. It is close to Key Arena and many restaurants and bars. 
6364549,43919979,2015-08-23,34062619,Tara,"We had such a wonderful time in Seattle and a big part of that was being able to start and end each day in this fantastic location. We stayed for just over a week and this place had everything we needed - kitchen, laundry in unit, and a great location! The condo is walking distance to so many things including the Seattle Center (the Space Needle, the Pacific Science Center, etc.) and Pike Place Market. It's also surrounded by fantastic food! When we weren't sampling the delicious local flavors, we were able to cook and store leftovers in the kitchen! Anthony was a fantastic host. He contacted us in advance of our stay to send us instructions. Any time I had a question he responded promptly. He even left an awesome list of local spots to try out! This was my first experience with Air BnB and I wasn't quite sure what to expect but I was so pleased with the outcome. Anthony has set a high bar! Thanks again for a great place to stay!"
6364549,45244743,2015-09-01,32554789,Melanie,"Photos don't do it justice. Super comfy bed, awesome location. 24hr gym within walking distance in Lower Queen Anne & Pikes Place a stones throw. Everything you need including washer and dryer. Highly recommended :)"
6364549,46131375,2015-09-08,24638531,Angelo,The host canceled this reservation 7 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
6364549,46370143,2015-09-10,3597183,Lorien,"I planned our trip to Seattle a few months ahead of time as it felt like the right year to spend my birthday at Bumbershoot and show my husband around a city he'd never been to, but was home for me for six years.  I was rather excited to find Anthony's studio available as it looked like a great location, which it absolutely is.  I love Belltown: great views, good food, excellent proximity to the Seattle Center as well as Pike Place Market.  
We loved the roof and spent some time up there every day.
The apartment is comfortable and has pretty much what you need to spend a visit somewhere.  We had issues with the bed, which we managed to solve the third night.  (If you are taller than 5'7"", the frame will wreck your toes. So we upended the frame and put the mattress on the floor and it was fine.)  We took our first through fourth Uber rides while there.  (YES!)  El Gaucho, the restaurant at the top of the hill, was my favorite place for special occasions so it was a bit of a dream to stay a block away.  
We also saw a concert at the Showbox our second night, and I'd definitely try to stay here again if we were to come up for another show there.  Easy walk, or cheap ride if you're wearing heels or don't feel like walking.
Thanks so much for having us, Anthony.  We had a really amazing time.

Lorien and Pablo"
6364549,48870469,2015-09-29,22041240,David,"Great communication from Anthony. Place is clean and in a great location, also has an awesome rooftop."
6364549,49764440,2015-10-06,8529810,Joshua,"The apartment was very stylish, in a great location, and kept very clean. Anthony was very accommodating and helpful with our trip. I'd highly recommend staying here!"
6364549,51437418,2015-10-20,22445562,Samantha,"Before our trip started Anthony was very informative and helpful. A few days before our trip he sent us details regarding his Apple TV, wifi password, key pick up and even a picture of the building/lockbox so we knew exactly where to look. I asked if we could check in early as we landed a few hours before check in, which he stated that wouldn't be an issue. Upon arrival he left us a bottle of one of our regular go to wines which I always appreciated and find so welcoming. We did experience an issue with the wifi in which he was so quick to respond.  He even offered to come and have it fixed (once we couldn't troubleshoot) ASAP. At this point we only had that night left of our trip and weren't even in the apartment at all so we told him not to worry. No sense in him coming over when we weren't even going to be there. We both really appreciated his sense of urgency. This being our first time in Seattle we loved it. Anthony's apartment definitely played a part. It was modern, great location with tons of shops, bars and restaurants, and the rooftop with an amazing view sealed the deal. We definitely plan on returning soon to Seattle since it is such a short flight from home. I have no doubt in my mind that I will again ask Anthony if we can stay here. He was a great host and we appreciated everything about him and his beautiful place. 

"
6364549,52397246,2015-10-29,3167573,Ben,"The description in the list doesn't do the apartment justice if you ask me - prime location, close to all the amenities you'll need, including some of the most beautiful sights you'll ever see in Seattle (in good or bad weather), cozy environment, and quiet surroundings too. Anthony left some tips too for things to try out while in town, and that came in handy more than once. If you're going to stay in Seattle for a short stay, or a long stay, don't let this apartment pass you by!"
6364549,53680155,2015-11-11,31247652,Jonathan,"Anthony's studio apartment has all you need to facilitate your stay in Seattle. The apartment is in prime location with a few great restaurants, bars and cafe within a 5 min walk. Pike Place market is a 15min walk and Seattle Center is about the same in the other direction. Overall great location, and I had no issues with the apartment.  "

7069080,38089059,2015-07-12,37270511,Jon,"Experience: A very positive one! It was a really great stay with an excellent host. Very quiet room with a comfy bed. It was good to relax and sleep in peace. Private and trustworthy. I had the pleasure of meeting the whole family, very nice people and also welcoming. I will definitely stay here if I have the chance. Thank you Siri :)"
7069080,38649500,2015-07-17,37003117,Richard,Wonderful experience. The room is exactly as described and is very comfortable. Delightful multi-cultural family is friendly and made me feel very welcome. Great for an overnight or extended stay with easy access to public transit. Neighborhood is quiet and clean. Thank you Siri!
7069080,44715931,2015-08-28,14367160,Vito,"Cozy room with great backyard deck made for a lovely stay. I especially appreciated having a full kitchen available, and a bicycle to use for grocery shopping nearby. It's an active household with lots of comings and goings -- in other words, it feels just like home!"
458193,1378919,2012-05-29,5498,Eddie & Joanie,"High grade hostel was quiet and in a neighborhood around the corner from many restaurants and a big grocery store.  One bathroom on each floor. Shared kitchen w/ good appliances and big eating space.  Other guests were nice to each other.  You can park on the street overnight but read all the signs carefully, and move before 9am.  Chris seemed nice enough."
458193,3590458,2013-02-19,5079074,Maria,"We absolutely loved staying at the lounge. Chris was very friendly and accommodating even though we had a different number of guests on different nights and had some great recommendations of things to see and do. The location is great, very central, we were able to walk to the market and other attractions which is great because I hate driving! The place is very tastefully decorated, cozy, and functional, and has everything you need! Would love to come back in the summer and spend some time in the amazing backyard. "
458193,3642890,2013-02-26,5165206,Amish,"We spent 2 nights last weekend in the Lounge in Pure Space and it was a  great experience.

To begin with, the hosts were very responsive and making our reservation was a breeze. Ideal for a last minute planner like me. The directions we were provided were precise and we found the house quite easily. It's a 30 second walk to Broadway and pretty much anything you might really need. The house was really clean and everything looks almost exactly like the pictures. 

The Lounge was perfect for the three of us. Fresh white towels were ready and all those pillows were really there. The beds were comfortable. I slept well.

As far as amenities were concerned we found everything we needed and then some. The Roku works well, the internet's great, lots of power outlets, the coffee machine is good, lots of take out menus and flyers for tourists on the board downstairs, fully equipped kitchen and the bathrooms are clean and nice (no attached bathroom, but that wasn't really a problem). The other guests were really nice too.

All in all, we loved it. A fun weekend in Seattle. We could do all the touristy things without spending much on cabs. Broadway was a good place to stay. There was nothing that we didn't expect or weren't satisfied with. Book it!"
458193,5384718,2013-06-27,52109,Gionne,"Great location, great hosts, great pad! Chris and Joy were very gracious hosts and made our stay in Seattle very enjoyable. 4 of us shared the big room and it was perfect. This apartment is in a beautiful residential area within walking distance of everything. Just one block away is Broadway with a variety of restaurants, shops and public transportation lines. Less than a mile away is Volunteer Park. Walking to this park is 3/4 the fun because it takes you through a historical neighborhood that's lined with well established trees. I will definitely be back! Thank you both for everything. Cheers!"
458193,11166154,2014-03-23,3294567,Chris,"Chris's place was absolutely fantastic.  Very nice, very well polished, he is an experienced host and you can tell.  Always had good recommendations and talking with peopel."
458193,19236143,2014-09-08,7367057,Aldo,"Great roomy beds, comes with a fan, and TV equipped with Roku. Location is fantastic one block over from Broadway giving you immediate access to great coffee, food and bars. The walk down to Pike/Pine can easily be done. You are also just a 6-7$ uber/lyft ride from downtown. I love seattle"
5337848,28322363,2015-03-22,131977,Marcus,"Manlio & Gayil warmly welcomed us into their lovely cottage guest house, and their adorable children brought us some of Gayil's delicious, freshly baked treats during our stay ;-). The Vecchiets were gracious hosts, and their cottage is a hidden gem! 

The cottage is full of natural light and very airy with high ceilings, a refreshing open concept kitchen/living space, and lovely french doors leading out to a canopied balcony. Both the bedroom & bathroom are quite spacious and very relaxing with subtle pops of color & tasteful decor. 

We enjoyed a wonderful stay at the Vecchiet cottage!! We would highly recommend their refreshing cottage retreat to anyone needing a staycation or visiting Seattle.

Overall just a wonderful place to stay and good location not too far of a drive from downtown. Plus area is about a mile walk to mall, gym and other shopping areas. With all that being said it wouldn't be right to sign off without saying what really made my experience great was Manlio and his family!Truly a nice person and host! Looking forward to next possibly staying here next time I am in Seattle area! "
5337848,30417980,2015-04-21,16212311,Shannon,"We had a lovely extended stay at Manlio and Gail's cottage! The family was so welcoming and accommodating.  The apartment was clean and had everything we could want.  The neighborhood is quiet and has easy street parking. We had been staying in hotels and extra bedrooms as we transitioned back to living in Seattle, so it was nice to find a place that felt more like a home.  Thanks for everything!"
5337848,30872112,2015-04-28,21338104,Peg,"It was a beautiful space! Just the retreat I needed during my hectic visit to family. The bed was very comfy, and I especially loved the shower. Manlio and his wife were welcoming and friendly. The space was private and quiet and clean, and looked new. The neighborhood is lovely and quiet. So much better than staying in a hotel. I look forward to staying there again on a future trip."
5337848,31070895,2015-05-01,17848320,Tanya,"The quaint backyard cottage was as delightful as the hosts! Very comfortable and clean accommodations. The hosts made me feel very welcome and when I am in Seattle, I will most certainly look for availability!  "
5337848,32539329,2015-05-19,31047447,Sharvil,"Thanks to Manlio and Gail for making the first airbnb experience an awesome one. They are incredible hosts, were very welcoming and helpful.

The space is brand new and immaculately clean. It has everything one could need, has ample natural lighting and really felt like home away from home. So much better experience than hotels. 
The neighborhood is also perfect, quiet and away from the city noise, but a quick 10 min walk to the mall, and short ride/bus to downtown. 

Thanks again."
5337848,33273160,2015-05-26,3114305,Mary,"Manlio was such a wonderful and helpful host.He presented us with a warm presence that was comforting.

I would definitely recommend if you are looking for cozy and simple place.The neighborhood is quiet and accessible to everything. (Main bus stop grocery store,mall,restaurants & etc.) It was such a lovely area to be in,looking forward to returning soon."
5337848,33925137,2015-06-02,5809654,Bill,"We arrived a bit early and Gail met us and welcomed us to the apartment.  The apartment over the garage was ""exactly as advertised"".  Roomy and bright and comfortable, we enjoyed the apartment very much for the four days we were there.  the apartment was also clean!  While we didn't cook, the kitchen was spacious and very well equipped.  The location also seemed convenient for us to visit all the places we wanted to see.  Overall, it was a great choice for us to have as a home base while we were visiting Seattle and we would book it again if we return!  "
5337848,34108984,2015-06-04,34776858,Kim,"This apartment is neighborhood just blocks from our son and family and was also a very easy short drive to Pikes Market downtown. The apartment was wonderful -- cute, clean, quiet and very nicely decorated with full kitchen and little balcony to sit with a glass of wine.  I was looking for a quiet place with reliable internet access for me to work while we were town visiting family and this worked out perfectly.  They even had a desk with an adjustable chair.  I only wish we had more time to stay longer. We will definitely stay here again next time we visit. "
5337848,34538406,2015-06-09,1288374,Jean,"The listing was very accurate; our hosts warmly welcomed us -- even left us chocolate chip cookies.  We met their family and enjoyed both Gail and Manlio and their children, Luke and Kate.  While small, the apartment was very clean, fresh and very comfortable for two people.  While the apartment is close to major roads and is easy to get to, it was very quiet.  Easy TV, etc. without half a dozen remotes to figure out.  "
5337848,35597047,2015-06-20,29864590,Jessica,"Staying in the housing provided by Gail, Manlio, and their family was a pleasure. They made themselves available for questions and local recommendations. The housing itself was clean, quiet, a separate space, and comfortable. My husband and I are what I would call 'mattress snobs'...the mattress and bedding was quite comfortable, which we've found to be hit and miss with some hotels or VRBO situations. It was also within walking distance to several nice restaurants and cafes, and a short drive to UW and downtown Seattle. We will stay at their rental on our next trip to the area."
5337848,35924593,2015-06-23,10453411,Harry,Definitely recommended! owner put a lot efforts in this cottage. Very lovely and comfortable place to stay.

5337848,37067556,2015-07-04,34613211,Phyllis,"The Quaint Backyard Cottage in Seattle was perfect for my husband and I on our trip to Seattle.  We were visiting our son, daughter in law, and 2 grandsons and this home was not far from their home.  Manlio, a great host, met us the first day and made certain all was ok with the cottage.  The cottage was as advertised, clean and neat.  The location is convent to the University District and to Northgate area as well as easy access to freeway and the downtown areas.  We will definitely stay here again when visiting the family."
5337848,37968965,2015-07-12,32534440,Ken,Just as advertised and the family sweet.  What a beautiful place to come and enjoy the surrounding area.  My wife and I are very pleased and would definitely come back to visit. Everything was well thought out and clean. A class act! Thank Manilo and family. 
5337848,38869539,2015-07-19,34791834,Brian,Our stay in Seattle at Manlio's home was amazing! The cottage was exactly as described. Manlio's brother in law checked in on us to make sure we didn't need anything very friendly. This was our first time using Airbnb and we were very impressed. The location is great close to everything. Manilo was very responsive and even let us check in a little early. We will definitely stay again!

Manlio and Gail are gracious, responsive, and helpful hosts and it was our pleasure to be their guests.  We had a full schedule while in Seattle, but always enjoyed returning to the cottage each evening.  The feeling in the unit was serene, welcoming, and very relaxing.  "

There was enough room for myself, my husband, and our baby to have a comfortable stay. Manlio also offered us a pack and play and an additional fan, and let us know to contact him if we needed anything else during our stay.  I have already recommended his cottage to a friend who has frequent out of town guests, and we plan to stay here again when visiting Seattle.  "
5337848,41495990,2015-08-07,39903934,Sonia,Perfect space for my son and I.  We had our meals on an inviting and serene balcony...and the hosts chocolate chip cookies really hit the spot.  Great experience.
5337848,43608334,2015-08-21,31155342,Alessandro,"I booked Manlio's carriage house for my parents' visit this past August. Manlio made the process really easy, leaving my parents an extra set of keys and making sure that they had all the comfort they needed."
5337848,44330176,2015-08-25,23436728,Lee,"Manlio and Gail welcomed us with homemade cookies and a listing of local restaurants and markets.  The cottage was delightful, very private and well furnished, with a view over the trees in back and a cozy deck.  We liked the neighborhood, which is quiet and residential, but close to the Fremont, Ravena Green Lake and University areas."
5337848,44580342,2015-08-27,41041119,Samuel,"Manilo and his family are some of the most welcoming individuals I have ever had the pleasure of meeting.  After, a long 28 hours of flying, they offered a place at the dinner table within five minutes of arriving.  Simply amazing!!
The listing description was actually better than the pictures upon arrival.  Unfortunately the roads were being repaved at the time of my arrival and parking was a little further away. However, I was provided options for parking and I actually enjoyed the scenery. "
5337848,44914371,2015-08-30,13679912,Jessica,"I enjoyed my stay in Manlio's backyard cottage.  The cottage was clean and comfortable.  I opened my door and the morning of my second day to find a plate of home baked chocolate chip cookies.
I would recommend this cottage to anyone looking for a place to stay in the Maple Leaf area."
5337848,45398611,2015-09-02,3923598,Lisa,My stay at Manlio's was perfect and he was a wonderful host. The cottage is even more delightful in person and located in a wonderful neighborhood. It was comfortable and charming and newly updated. I would definitely stay again.  
5337848,47146954,2015-09-16,14413245,Patricia,Our hosts were so gracious and replied promptly to the few questions we had.  The neighborhood was so nice for walking in the morning and there was a great coffee shop nearby.  We loved having the parking right in front of the house - so convenient.  The apartment was small but very well laid out and had everything we needed.  The location was perfect for us - close to family but also close to shopping of any kind and easy to get anywhere.  We loved the accomadations and will be renting this airbnb again!
5337848,48226045,2015-09-24,41580673,Mark,"My stay in Seattle was great.  The Quaint Backyard Cottage was very quiet and it was a totally separate house.  Very clean and very well stocked.  It was very nice and classy, the bed was very supportive and comfortable.  Bathroom was so spacious, with water pressure being strong and hot water being very abundant.  I totally enjoyed the fresh air of Seattle and I had very good sleep during the whole stay.  Manlio and his family were very considerate and even gave me brownies to enjoy (they were very yummy).  Excellent stay!"
5337848,48460183,2015-09-26,15587631,Heather,"Wonderful cottage in a quaint area, all the amenities of a larger home, quiet neighborhood, easy access to everything, hosts were a delight and even brought us fresh baked muffins one morning!!"
5337848,49565969,2015-10-04,17381582,Libbie M.,"This was one of our best experiences with Airbnb yet!! The guest house was clean, private, quiet (a rarity in Seattle accommodations) and altogether very comfortable.

We came to town for our friends' wedding reception. The location was great--close to the freeway but in a very peaceful (and architecturally lovely) neighborhood.

Next time we need to stay in Seattle for a few nights, this will be my first choice of accommodations!"
5337848,50298111,2015-10-11,39250001,Michelle,"We stayed at this listing for a week. It was perfect for my son and I. Manlio and Gail were the most nice, honest, sincere people we may have ever met. They made our experience unforgettable. It is a 5 minute walk from Northgate which has a bus shuttle that goes directly downtown. The apartment itself is clean, updated, comfortable, and cozy. It is located on a nice quiet street and we loved coming back from our daily adventures to the apartment. The shower is great as well as the water pressure, bed was super comfortable as was the couch, and the convenient kitchen had all the amenities you would enjoy from your own home.  It was our first airbnb experience and it was a great one. We would stay again in a heartbeat. I HIGHLY recommend this listing whether you're a couple, family, single, business trip etc. it will make anyone feel at home regardless of where you are from. "
5337848,51718291,2015-10-24,32256712,Jimmy,"Hosts were very welcoming and friendly. The neighborhood was great and close to restaurants, shopping, etc. close to downtown Seattle by car.
The description was perfect. "
5337848,52295222,2015-10-27,18220206,Andy,Amazing hosts. Extremely generous & helpful. Have extended the stay for almost a month. Will provide another review after. Great place & great people!
5337848,54332408,2015-11-18,18220206,Andy,"Manlio & Gail could not have been better hosts. They were amazing in every possible way you'd hope for out of hosts. I needed to put up 2 members of my film production team in a good, clean space for about a month, and their cottage was absolutely perfect. Very comfortable, very private, and very clean. 

Also, these 2 hosts went far above & beyond to help support our current project's needs with regards to our guests. I can't say enough good things about these people & their cottage... they are exactly the reason why I enjoy using Airbnb, and they are some of the bests hosts I have ever had the privilege of connecting with. Thank you for everything guys... you were AMAZING, and we will definitely be back. :)"
5337848,54880099,2015-11-25,13712459,Kate,"The hosts and house were so welcoming and warm! We got in very late and it was quite chilly out but we were able to find the house easily and walked into a very toasty and clean cottage. 
Our extended family lives only 1 mile away so we walked a lot and loved the neighborhood! When our uber didn't show up one day, Manilo's wife was kind enough to give us a ride into Ballard! It was a 20+minute drive but she insisted. AND left us brownies. :) 
The cottage itself is perfect for 1-2 people. Like I said; incredibly clean, fluffy towels, soft sheets, and everything you need to get a goods night rest. Local coffee shops were awesome and the view from Maple Leaf Reservoir is definitely worth checking out. 
We will absolutely stay again when we're back in Seattle! So lucky to have found Manilo and his family! "
5337848,55425396,2015-12-01,47643122,Jane,"This was our first Airbnb experience and it was an excellent way to start.  Though our hosts were out of town for the Thanksgiving holiday, we felt welcomed.  The location was ideal for us, not 10 minutes from the larger family celebration, access to all that we needed, and comfortable for the 2 of us.  "
8150145,47323459,2015-09-17,43456365,Paige,"Great place ~ comfortable, clean and relaxing.  We would stay again."
8150145,48456309,2015-09-26,44224057,Kevin,"We had a great stay here!  There was a welcome note, and everything was clean and well prepared.  All our questions were answered within minutes.  We walked two blocks to see everything at the Seattle Center (Space Needle, museums, playground, and lots of other stuff).  There is also a ""Whole Foods""-style market two blocks away.

There is about as much common area as you can expect this close to downtown, and three bed/three bath was plenty.  You can see the Space Needle up close from both upstairs bedroom windows.  The kitchen had everything, the WIFI was good, and the beds were comfortable.  I don't know what else to say.  It was like a home away from home.

This place was sooo much better than getting a hotel!"
8150145,49066788,2015-09-30,23590234,Kyle,"Place was great. Very clean and in a good location. Lots of space, was able to accommodate six of us comfortably. "

8150145,54061981,2015-11-15,32859005,Ashley,"Had a very good experience.  The town home was great and comfortably fit all 6 of us.  Lots of privacy between the rooms.  Neighbors were very nice.  The home is centrally located and next to dining,  theaters,  and downtown.  Perfect stay for cheaper than many hotels in the area. "
8150145,57244738,2015-12-23,50169182,Jason,"The house was great! Clean, spacious, and well laid out. Great for both adults and kids alike. The entire house felt very modern and came with all the amenities you would need. Excellent location, convenient to local restaurants, bars, grocery and drug stores. Walking distance to Seattle Center made it even better. 

Communication was also great throughout the entire process, leading up to and during our stay. Highly recommended home!"
7561254,41165009,2015-08-04,39884485,Stefanie,"We had a good stay there, Ethan was so friendly and looked that we have good days in Seattle. The house and the room was very clean. The bus station was near to the house, I recommend it."
7561254,41519449,2015-08-07,18831238,Diana,This is a great room in an even better location! It is one street away from tons of restaurants and is completely safe. I had to book the room with less than 2 days notice and Dario was completely accommodating to my arrival and departure. The room was super clean and comfortable. When I arrived it was very hot but there was already a fan going before I got there! The house is very nice and I love that there was board games available instead of a TV. There was unrestricted use of the kitchen and Dario even provided hot and cold breakfast. I would definitely stay here again! 
7561254,42050513,2015-08-10,27194758,Peter,"This is a very clean and comfortable house with a number of rooms in a quiet neighborhood close to UW. An express bus to downtown is a block away. Friendly host, lots of tasty breakfast items to choose from and a good kitchen. I would definitely return here for my next stay in Seattle."
7561254,42637708,2015-08-14,39241387,Jerry,"Nice place to relax before I moved on. In a wonderful place, a lot to do."
7561254,43450927,2015-08-19,41172902,Hugo,"Great room, location, and service. Daario and Ethan were incredibly helpful in every way. Even when I screwed up my own booking, Ethan was able to move me into another room in the house--at a cheaper price. Thanks for making my first Airbnb experience so awesome! "
7561254,45229410,2015-08-31,42276024,Karen,"Dario & Ethan were so wonderful.  This was a last minute reservation and they were more than accommodating.  I arrived extremely late into the evening and they left the front porch light on as well as the livingroom and my bedroom light on.  It was so welcoming.  I missed out on the amazing planned breakfast but hope to experience it in the future.  The room was perfect and cherry. 
Their communication was super quick.

I can't wait to come back and experience all Seattle has to offer and only hope Dario's and Ethan's place is available.

Will go back!"
7561254,49046244,2015-09-30,8051583,Jared,"The place is near the University of Washington, a 20- to 30-minute bus ride to downtown (a bus stop is near the house). Complimentary breakfast is a bonus. 

Clean and comfy — I enjoyed the place. "

7561254,51951367,2015-10-25,45621933,Tim,No problems.  Well maintained.  Good location.  Good value.
7561254,55856015,2015-12-06,14559844,Gurupreet,This was a great spot for my brief stay whilst tending to some business at University of Washington. The house was only a 10 minute walk from campus. The neighborhood was safe and the listing was just as described. Travis was very informative about the check-in process. 
7561254,56317726,2015-12-12,39844001,Alice,The house is very well located and clean. When I was there it was very very quiet. Dario (and Ethan) promptly replied to all my questions.

8028801,46537115,2015-09-11,2157207,Leena,"Cody was a great host and was extremely personable and kind. He showed me a favorite neighborhood haunt, Chuck's Hop Shop -- a place I'm sure I will revisit! We went there to partake in the food truck scene and have a pint. I loved the set up of this airbnb...I got the downstairs floor, there was a middle level with kitchen and small living room, and Cody was up another flight of stairs. This gave both of us a lot of privacy and quiet.  The room was tastefully and simply appointed, and I slept well. For chilly nights, you can turn on the very efficient heater as there is a thermostat on the wall. Bathroom is adjacent for convenience, and I loved the fact that I parked literally right outside of the front door, for easy loading/unloading of my stuff. 

Nearby:
Pagliacci's is also nearby for tasty pizza, literally across the street, and Milano's delivers until 3 am if you're a night owl. A short walk away is Greenwood Avenue, with all of its restaurants and bars. It's a great neighborhood, central to all that's great in Seattle.

All in all, two thumbs up!"
8028801,46988535,2015-09-14,43521396,Kaaren,"Cody was prompt and responsible to be at his residence when I arrived and was versatle about the arrival and departure time.  He was polite and considerate.  The ground floor room was private and also had a private bath with shower right outside the bedroom door.
The sheets were clean and the bed slept well."
8028801,47578390,2015-09-20,9246967,Mike,The Greenwood Go-To is a great place to stay in Seattle.  Cody is an amazing host and the location can't be beat.  
8028801,47949625,2015-09-21,6097333,Karen,"Cody was friendly and waited for me to arrive before heading out for the night . He showed me  the room and told me to make myself at home using the living area TV ect if I wanted. 
 He left shortly after and I only saw hm again in morning as we both were leaving.  My room was comfortable with bed made and it was great to have my own bathroom and on my own level giving privacy for both parties "
8028801,48937324,2015-09-29,43893078,David,"Cody is a warm and friendly host who knows how to stay out of your way but is available if you need anything.  The room was comfortable, and having a private bathroom was a big plus.  Overall, an enjoyable time with a great host."
8028801,50388316,2015-10-11,11562371,Clara,First time using Airbnb and this was a great experience. Only there for the night and left early morning. The listing has very detailed directions and the place was so easy to find. The room had a private bathroom next to it and gave privacy to both sides.
8028801,50729798,2015-10-13,11346491,Natalie,"Cody's place was situated in a nice suburb of Seattle. Checking in was quick and easy and Cody was friendly. The bed was comfortable and it was nice to have a bathroom to ourselves. We loved visiting Chuck's Hop Shop next door, a must for any beer lover! 
Overall I'm happy with the experience and glad we got to spend some time in a part of Seattle away from the usual beaten track. "
8028801,51002778,2015-10-16,13646939,Glen,"Very friendly and accommodating host.  Room is very clean, comfortable and comfortable.  Great location.  I highly recommend this place for anyone visiting the area."
8028801,51100003,2015-10-17,6331724,Laurel,"Our stay at Cody's was great, wish we could have stayed longer. It was clean and quiet and the bed was comfy. The setup of the house and parking is amazing, you have the floor to yourself and parking is right outside. The location is central and there are great local cafes and breweries, i'm sure Cody will be happy to fill you in. Thank you for making us feel so welcome in Seattle!"
8028801,51513039,2015-10-20,7837359,Liz,"We managed to snag this room for a last-minute overnight stay. Cody was prompt in replying, and was right there to greet us and give a quick tour of his place upon our arrival. It's a nice set up, with the guest room and bathroom on the entry floor, making it easy to come and go as we pleased. I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again if it's still available next time I'm in the area. Thanks Cody!"
8028801,53053307,2015-11-04,806550,Lesley,"Our paths did not cross much because Cody arrived home from work just about the time I was heading off to be with my son for the afternoon and evening. Cody is a pleasant, capable host who has provided a really comfortable, good value place for this weary traveler. I hope to return soon and get to know him better.

My 5 night stay with Cody was really, really good for me. His place is  very comfortable. A large, quiet bedroom with nice furnishings. I had plenty of floor space to dismantle my suitcase, find my travel gifts and then regroup. Additionally 4  pillows and a really good  bedside lamp allowed me to prop myself up and read on and off throughout the night. My slightly ill body was on a 9 hour difference sleeping schedule and kept waking up. I was waiting for the dawn while attempting to fall back to sleep. Cody was sleeping two floors up stairs. I was thankful that the arrangement provided enough separating distance, so I did not feel like I might be bothering him in the middle of the night. I also had a totally clean separate private bathroom and easy, no stairs, access directly from the parking area. What more could a girl want!!!!!!

The location is great for bus riders. The off street alley access was a little tricky to find at first but Cody gave me good instructions and 4 friends  and a shuttle  driver found it easily. I was also happy to have Chuck's Hop Shop with its interesting assortment of food trucks and inside/outside tables right next door.  

One really, really, really nice bonus.... Cody plays guitar really, really well. On Saturday and Sunday as he relaxed during the day, he played. I had two wonderful concerts while sitting, propped up snug and warm in the bed, reading...... the music filled the air. DELIGHTFUL!!!!!!

My only want .... No big deal!!!!! was a glass in the bathroom. I was trying to drink extra water because of my cold and taking a couple of medicines. If I had asked, I am certain Cody would have helped me.

Best wishes Cody!!!  NICE PHOTO And Thank you very much!! If you ever want to visit Montana... Mi Casa Es Su Casa, Siempre!!!!"
8028801,53292988,2015-11-07,17381582,Libbie M.,"A great stay in the Greenwood neighborhood of Seattle. Conveniently located, parking right outside the door, and relatively quiet for a place in the city. My husband and I were in town so I could get a bunch of dental work done under sedation, so I don't remember much of the stay, but the bed was comfortable for my doped-up self to sleep in for many, many hours. Thanks, Cody!"
8028801,54625482,2015-11-22,47924155,Tommy,A nice set up where you get some privacy and own bathroom at a fair price. Host was friendly and communicative. Stores are nearby for basic shopping needs and the area also has some restaurants and good bars. Bus routes from the neighborhood connect fairly well to other parts of Seattle.
8028801,55211209,2015-11-29,46100500,Ken,"The host was available whenever we needed him. This place is very convenient if you are interested in staying around Greenwood or Phinney Ridge. The price is very reasonable. Lot's of restaurants and coffee shops not far away and it is easy to access from Interstate 5. 
When we visited it was quite chilly and it would have been nice to have a heated bathroom."
3652612,18448045,2014-08-26,1722109,Hans-Christian,Jayson's apartment is spacious and neat with a very comfortable queen size bed. It is situated conveniently close to all interesting places on Capitol Hill. Jayson is a very friendly and easy going host. He responded to our questions immediately. We were his first guests and so we overlooked some minor flaws in cleanliness which will be overcome once Jayson has handed over the cleaning of his apartment to a professional cleaning service before guests check in.
3652612,18700325,2014-08-30,1291367,Harry,"I booked this Airbnb on the day I arrived in town, and Jayson was awesome and flexible even as my flight was late and he wasn't sure where I was.

Very nice, spacious, well-appointed apartment. Right in the middle of trendy Capitol Hill with great bars and coffee shops. 10 minute walk from downtown. 

Would definitely book again!"
3652612,18919367,2014-09-02,627483,Soham,"Jayson is a great host. Was at the house when we reached, showed us around the house, gave tips on the neighborhood. On the second day, when it was raining, he left us a message with the location of his rain jackets.  Neighborhood was perfect, very close to restaurants, bars and highway as well, without being noisy."
3652612,19105898,2014-09-06,8077432,Mark,Jayson was a great host. Very accommodating to help get us set-up. The apartment was in a great location just minutes walk to downtown.
3652612,19429039,2014-09-12,20437494,Patrick,"This is a great place in an awesome location. 

The apartment was clean and tidy. Jayson checked in periodically to make sure everything was good. He was out of town and arranged for a friend to drop off the key and the friend was prompt. The checkout process was very easy and Jayson was flexible with my last-minute schedule change. 

The location is very centrally located and near to many amenities. It's a short walk to downtown. 

I would definitely stay here again and wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to friends and colleagues needing a place in Seattle. Thanks, Jayson! "
3652612,19656503,2014-09-15,11279332,Katie,"Visited Seattle for a wedding. The apartment was clean and simple- nothing over the top but nothing short of comfortable. Walking distance to shopping, good restaurants and anything else one would need if they were visiting the city. "
3652612,20115907,2014-09-23,21143982,Jesse,"Phenomenal host, location, apartment, everything.  You're right in the heart of capitol hill, surrounded by lots of fun things to do.  I can't recommend the host and this apartment enough.  I will absolutely contact Jayson on my next visit to Seattle."
3652612,22048624,2014-10-28,7029875,Cristina,"Comfortable place, really great location.  Lots of restaurants in the area and it was a short walk to downtown.  "
3652612,34176268,2015-06-05,27079331,Ian,Great location in Capitol Hill. The apartment is extremely comfortable and Jaysonis a very accomodating host. Well worth staying at.
3652612,34734970,2015-06-11,29098900,Sean,"Jayson is awesome! He was extremely accommodating, and proactively sought to get us any info we needed about the accommodations, places to eat, etc. His apartment is is very clean, has all sorts of creature comforts, and the bed is comfortable.
Location wise, his place is central to scads of restaurants, drinking opportunities, live music venues, parks, and is a fifteen minute walk from the conference center."
3652612,36473422,2015-06-28,36399736,Steven,"Jayson's apartment was great. In a prime location in Capitol Hill, everything was clean and he was very easy to reach. Highly recommended."
3652612,36786864,2015-07-01,33512952,Demian,"Great location. You can walk to downtown and the Space Needle. Plenty of restaurants and shops within blocks of you in Capitol Hill. The apartment is bright, clean and uncluttered. This was my first airbnb experience and it was great."
3652612,37768827,2015-07-10,13451860,Pam,"Jayson was very quick to respond to all of our questions and needs.
His place is very nice and clean. We booked this apartment because it was 3 building down from where our daughter lived. It is close to many places to eat and enjoy all the interesting people of Seattle. We loved all the young kids and the diversity of lifestyles, but then we have always been very supportive of personal preferences and choices. Our only discomfort was that we were there when Seattle was experiencing record heat 91-96 and with most places in Seattle not having AC it made it a little uncomfortable. But the people and ambiance made up for any discomfort!! 

Thanks Jayson, we will be seeing you in the future!"
3652612,38619870,2015-07-17,17875552,Brittany,"Jayson's a great host and offered many great suggestions for our stay. The apartment is in the most ideal location for a visit in Seattle-- nestled between Summit and Broadway, you can literally walk to a bus line that can get you anywhere in the city in no time, but everything you'll need is pretty much within a short walking distance anyway (downtown is around ten minutes). As for the apartment, it is rather spacious, and the area was quiet in the summertime since most college students are away. The apartment is perfect if all you're looking for is a comfortable place to sleep and hold your luggage."
3652612,38802005,2015-07-18,20576827,Mériam,"Jayson was very accommodating as he managed to let me access his place earlier than I had asked. The place was really (really) clean and ready to host me. 
I had only one day to visit Seattle and he gave me a lot of tips and advice me to visit some places.
I really recommend this place as it is also well located not far from downtown with a lot of cute coffee place and good restaurants."
3652612,39041573,2015-07-20,1238531,Jaclyn,"Great place for our weekend trip to Seattle, and in a good location. Very smooth check-in/out. Jayson was extremely helpful with tips for restaurants and cafes in the area. Loved the Malaysian pop-up Kedai Makan just down the street! Can sit and eat your food at the pub next door."
3652612,39790708,2015-07-26,36299215,Joe,"Great host. Great stay. The area seems to have a lot of young, hip people, and there are cafe's and bars a few blocks away. There are several bus stops just a block or two away. And there are coffee shops very nearby (including Starbucks).

I wanted to park my car and use public transportation. That was difficult. There is no private parking available. There is a public parking lot a few blocks away - but they did not have a 24 hour rate. After a few phone calls I was able to get them to temporarily add the 24 hour rate to their online menu. It was $24/day.  And I had to renew it online every day. Kind of a hassle. But it worked out.

There was no closet space or drawer space. We had to just stay packed. Not a big deal for us. We managed. It would have been nice to have had a few drawers.

There are a lot of positives here. The place is so centrally located! After learning a few bus routes we were having lots of fun. And Jayson's home is clean and comfortable.

Thanks Jayson! "
3652612,40738517,2015-08-02,12754634,HuiSein,Jayson had been a great host! His place is surrounded by lots of good eateries that we din even need to go back the same place twice during our week stay. His place is also within walking distance from the convention centre which my hub was attending a conference. He even helped us collect our packages prior to our arrival. We really had a great experience!! Thanks Jayson!
3652612,42128987,2015-08-11,14748370,Anthony,"First and foremost, great neighborhood.  Walking distance to some fun bars and great spots to eat.  The apartment is a fantastic location with a great view of the Space Needle from the balcony.  Very roomy and comfortable after long days at the event I was at. There is No AC, but there are fan(s) for air circulation and to keep the temp down at night.   He was more than helpful with assisting me with places to eat in the area and when I had to ship some packages because I forgot to pack the right amount of clothing.    Overall Jayson was a great host and I would definitely stay with him again if my travels make it back up to Seattle.   "
3652612,43501265,2015-08-20,9818032,Sandra,"Jayson is the perfect host, greeting us warmly and helping us get settled in. He maintained great communication prior to our stay to assure us all was well and ready.  He gave us great suggestions for late night dining in the area and tips for the busses. His home was just as described and depicted and was very comfortable and perfect for our needs. The neighborhood is great and walking distance to restaurants, shopping, and of course coffee! The busses to all desired locations are easily accessible and run frequently. The street is lively in the evening but did quiet down enough for good night's sleep. We had a very good stay here and would recommend to all! View from the balcony is really nice too! We actually walked back from Pikes Place Market area, enjoying the pleasant evening, not a long walk at all! Thanks Jayson for sharing your home with us!  "
3652612,45578910,2015-09-04,39070709,James,"Jayson was very attentive and communicative. My stay was pleasant and comfortable. Overall, a fantastic experience. "
3652612,47183987,2015-09-16,12849781,Thomas,For my first time using Airbnb this was a great experience and I absolutely will be using it again. Jayson was very knowledgeable about the neighborhood and great places to visit nearby. Jayson also accommodated my requests to make my stay that much more enjoyable. Overall I would stay at Jayson's place again given the great location of Capitol Hill and Jayson being a great host.
3652612,48814012,2015-09-28,43455380,Sourish,"Jayson was very nice and welcomed me to his place with precise instructions. The place was as described - spacious and cozy setup. Large kitchen with everything you might need to cook up a meal. Great location, close to grocery, bars, restaurants. Buses routes easily accessible. Also, there is a view from the balcony. Highly recommend staying here.   "
7048843,39826794,2015-07-26,18219414,韶辉shaohui,两个学生对这个住宿很满意！
7048843,40145959,2015-07-28,36836437,Brad,Great communication and easy to check in.  Place was simple and just what I needed.  Many thanks for your fast responses to all questions I had.  I enjoyed my stay.
7048843,40773937,2015-08-02,5014502,Ken,"The room is spacious, Kevin is very friendly. The location is a bit inconvenient but still accessible with public transport. "
7048843,41975083,2015-08-10,36759758,Alan,"Before my arrival, as well as during, Kevin was very informative and gave very detailed directions to places to eat nearby, as well as sources of transportation around downtown Seattle. The room is quiet, very spacious, and the King sized bed allowed both my friend and I to sprawl out and sleep very comfortably. The complimentary water and shampoo and body wash were a nice surprise. If I'm ever back in Seattle, I wouldn't hesitate to book again."
7048843,42938088,2015-08-16,39766478,Rian,"Our stay with Kevin was great. We were late checking in, but Kevin was very accommodating and the process was smooth and simple. Kevin was very friendly when we met him outside. The neighbourhood is quiet and pleasant. The room was nice and spacious enough to comfortably accommodate a King bed and Queen mattress. The place in general was very clean. The bathroom was shared with ~2-3 other rooms which was a bit of an issue in the morning but not much. Though we didn't use the kitchen at all, it was somewhat sub-par and probably the only negative of the place. Overall we enjoyed our stay and would recommend the place for a short-term rental."
7048843,43541957,2015-08-20,34956684,Tiffany,"Kevin answered my questions very quickly and promptly with tons of helpful information. The room was clean, bed was comfortable, and a clean bathroom. There was a fridge in the room which was great. There was 2 complimentary water bottles, cups, and shampoo.  It was a very comfortable stay. Location was near public transportation. "
7048843,43732053,2015-08-21,41774862,Bryan,"This was my experience using airbnb is was a great! The host was phenomenal very welcoming, made sure that my friends and I were comfortable! It was a great experience and surely I would contact the host again."
7048843,43981559,2015-08-23,37843671,Jane,"My stay at Kevin's place has been very pleasant. Prior to arrival, Kevin has provided me with very informative messages about checking in as well as tips of getting around the house. The room itself is spacious, bright, clean, and very comfortable. I also had no problem contacting the house owner when I needed help and was replied immediately. Highly recommend this place!"
7048843,44331789,2015-08-25,31182658,Renee,"Kevin gave me all the information I needed to make my trip a breeze. Directions, near by restaurants, and clear instructions of getting into the room. The house itself was a little old so you really had to pull the doors hard to open and close them which was a little noisy, but everything was clean and well maintained. The shared bathroom only posed an issue one morning when I had to wait about an hour to use the restroom because everyone was showering right after each other. However that's expected when 3 rooms share 1 bathroom. Overall it was an easy visit and I'd recommend it for a low maintancene trip. "
7048843,44703015,2015-08-28,41338131,Alvin,"Although we didn't meet in person, the host was very helpful, placing an extra Queen sized bed to accommodate 3 people and also providing useful information on Seattle. The only issue was the toilet was shared among the occupants of 3 rooms. Still on overall a good place to stay and I would definitely stay again when I am back in Seattle."
7048843,45122393,2015-08-31,39754990,Erik,"Kevin was a great host. My cousins and I were in Seattle for just the weekend so we only needed a place to pretty much freshen up and sleep, so the 4 of us were looking for to squeeze into one room. Kevin's large room not only had a king size bed, but he also provided another queen size mattress to help us be more comfortable. Everything went smoothly this weekend and the location is prime as all areas of Seattle were within a quick, cheap uber ride away. The bathroom was shared with 3 other guests, but this didn't turn out to be a problem for us and hopefully not for them either. Overall great stay!"
7048843,45697553,2015-09-05,39307667,Silas,Kevin was very insightful and helpful in our stay and provided us with very convenient methods of checking in and checking out. Was very good at replying messages promptly and catering to our needs.
7048843,46172861,2015-09-08,12009113,Ryan,My group of four had a wonderful stay at Kevin's for bumbershoot weekend. It was easy to check in and the room was exactly as described along with an extra mattress. It's in a nice neighborhood with easy bus access to downtown and a chill place to get some good pizza within walking distance. Kevin was excellent at communicating all the information needed to make our stay in Seattle the best it could be and was always quick to respond to any messages. 
7048843,46768024,2015-09-13,42063423,Kathleen,"Very hands off and low-key, which I loved. Less like a room in a house and more like a hotel room. Kevin was very gracious about communication and recommendations. Also came across another person that lived in the house and she was extremely polite and friendly :)"
7048843,47276733,2015-09-17,21305686,Jessica,"My friends and I loved the airbnb room. It was perfect for our needs. 
The listing description was accurate. We loved that the house was near a big park, community garden, and bus stops. I appreciated that the host always responded back to my questions ASAP. For the affordable price, the room was high-quality, spacious, and clean. No complaints here. "
7048843,48894807,2015-09-29,41504624,Katrina,Phenomenal location. Great place to crash. Sitting to eat a bit of a challenge (if you want to eat in). GRACIOUS host. Clean rooms. VERY accommodating. 
7048843,49393038,2015-10-03,27394242,Marco,"Great communication, easy access, everything was clean and just as described! Great place to stay."
7048843,50054209,2015-10-08,20478989,Das,"A great value for Seattle. It's nothing flash, but if you want a good location and to save a little money, this is the spot. Kevin runs his Airbnb house smoothly so there is a lot of flexibility for check in and coming and going without host interaction. "
7048843,50492543,2015-10-12,13145382,Ann,"The host is nice to give many food and traffic message. This room is lovely, but too small for four person. The kitchen and bathroom is not clean enough. Too many tenants at the same time in this house, so we should wait to use bathroom and kitchen, it's not conveninent. And the other tenants didn't wash dishes immediately, so the kitchen sink is dirty and messy.      "
7048843,50785364,2015-10-14,6618418,Raquel,We are really dissapointed. The bathroom was very dirty. The house smelt not well. The hallway was not clean. We will not come back to this house. 
7048843,51061197,2015-10-17,27585518,Anita,Near downtown. The room is ok. The landlord offered many information.
7048843,52782373,2015-11-01,46973204,Lisa,"Wonderful place!!! Located in a quiet, clean, safe neighborhood. Very close to multiple bus routs making it very easy to get anywhere.  The Room was large, clean and offered many wonderful amenities even had fridge and  tea kettle in the room. Would definitely choose to stay here when returning to Seattle "
7048843,54218593,2015-11-16,48894372,Kaleim,"Kevin has his Airbnb down to a science. Everything was nice and easy, check in and check out is all automatic. Room was exactly as pictured, everything seemed great. For the price it was really good deal."
7048843,55444574,2015-12-01,47742784,Ulrike,We enjoyed the stay-nice host! Easy and fast to go to downtown and nice bedroom. Only wished that the washroom and kitchen is more clean.
7048843,56685043,2015-12-16,22661778,Andrew,Kevin is easy to work with and the stay was nice. The bus routes are by his house and are easy to get to the downtown or Udub.
7048843,57826018,2015-12-29,51382284,Salamatu,"Was very comfortable, Kevin responds quickly to messages and I will stay again in my next visit"
5413564,54836943,2015-11-24,13532450,Laura,The host canceled this reservation 114 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
5413564,58405158,2016-01-02,51189374,Prateek,Spacious house with a nice backyard and beautiful neighborhood. Close to downtown and other places around the city from a tourist point of view. I will recommend this place to my friends!
1251707,12222053,2014-04-26,3623180,Matthew,"Very efficient and just what I was looking for on a brief stay. Reception helped me get in to the room a couple of hours early, which was much appreciated after a 10 hour flight from Europe!

"
1251707,36757555,2015-07-01,26867181,Kate,"We has a nice stay at The Camlin in Seattle. The studios are different sizes because it's a historic hotel, we ended up in the smallest one but it still fit all our needs."
7802266,45315360,2015-09-01,41070215,Bryan,"The location was amazing!  I felt like I was in the center of the rich culture of Capitol Hill.  Scott was a wonderful host that helped me feel welcome in this space.  The room was perfect, but the balcony was amazing!"
7116795,39663442,2015-07-25,37492658,Julie,Booking was simple and Debbie responded very quickly to all my questions. 
7116795,40782103,2015-08-02,37285384,Catherine,"Debbie was great!  She was responsive and even extended our stay one night when we needed it last minute!  She gave us some great suggestions on where to go in Seattle - attractions, restaurants, tours, etc.  

The apartment was very clean, like new.  And, I know Debbie took the time to add a tv at the last minute as well.  The place slept 5 - comfortable queen size beds in two rooms plus a twin size futon in the living room, perfect for a child. Plenty of towels (Debbie even brought more!)/fresh linens and everything you needed in the kitchen.

The apartment was also quiet, it's downstairs/removed from the main street.  It does have a bedroom window that faces the alley which got noisy on trash days/sometimes in the late evening.  Apartment was warm (we were there in late July) but Debbie had two fans for each bedroom.  My only real complaint was the washer/dryer.  This was the first leg of a two week vacation and we wanted to do some laundry along the way.  It's a combo/washer dryer that 1.) had a tiny capacity and 2.) the dryer didn't really work - never dried clothes and clothes ended up smelling bad.  We only put very few clothes in (as instructed) but it still didn't work well.  No biggie though - we ended up leaving the clothes out to hang dry which was fine since it was warm/summer.

I would definitely recommend this apartment - very nice amenities, clean and close to everything (Pike, Space Needle, etc.). And, for extra $$ there is a parking spot out back - which we needed and came in very handy!"
7116795,41178485,2015-08-04,40096348,Cristina,"Very easy check in, Great location.  An overall great experience"
7116795,41793112,2015-08-09,37438407,Jonathan,Our family had a wonderful time at this condo and we would recommend to anyone looking for a place in downtown Seattle within walking distance to anything needed. The unit was clean and has a well laid-out floor plan. Debbie was an excellent hostess and checked in a few times to make sure we were settled in. The unit is also next door to a great donut and coffee shop!  
7116795,42202663,2015-08-11,40031407,Sijian,Great location.
7116795,44463022,2015-08-26,40746057,Nozomi,Good location but the room is basement of the apartment.  Some problems comparing to the price.  
7116795,44920931,2015-08-30,37570302,Jahna,"Debbie was great, very responsive. Pictures were accurate, no surprises upon arrival. This basement apartment was recently renovated. Very well appointed, and super comfortable. It was perfect for two adults and two teenagers who didn't want to share a bed. It is close to both downtown shopping and pikes place market. Great restaurants within a block. Highly recommend for travel with family. "
7116795,46638609,2015-09-12,4018275,Tiffany,"Debbie was very welcoming and gave very clear and helpful instructions about everything. She also gave us very detailed information about the apartment and close by attractions. 

The apartment itself was very nice. It's a good size and is very clean and nice. It gets a little musty, but opening up the windows just a crack helped a lot. "
7116795,47005641,2015-09-14,43794827,David,"The property was spot on as Debbie described!  The unit was beautifully decorated and very comfortable.  As a foodie, I was able to walk to/from Pike's market with some fresh seafood and produce to make a  couple gourmet meals.  For non-chef folks, there are endless eateries all within a few blocks.  

Although I wasn't able to check in early, Debbie had arranged for a place to leave luggage while I enjoyed the day walking around.  She was also very responsive with a minor TV issue.  I'm looking forward  to another stay here soon!  The price, location and amenities are unbeatable for a group of 4.  Thank you, Debbie for a great stay! "
7116795,49154682,2015-10-01,11187153,Rich,Apartment was as described and Debbie was great to work with.  Had a great week and location is one of the apartments best feature.  Would defiantly stay there again.   
7116795,49826115,2015-10-06,3139034,Bill,"The neighborhood was great and the apartment clean and lovely! I definitely feel like the listing was accurate, though the apartment was a bit darker than anticipated. Overall, very satisfactory. "
7116795,50191445,2015-10-10,2639551,Eric,"Debbie was great to work with, promptly responding to all inquiries and providing helpful assistance at every turn. The apartment was exactly as described - if a little darker and warmer than expected - but overall it was very comfortable and we enjoyed our stay there immensely. The location and value cannot be beat!"
7116795,51195414,2015-10-18,20875242,莹,"The condo is very tidy and warm, and with good location. Check in and check out are convenient. It is worth recommending."
7116795,53847662,2015-11-13,550276,Jimmy,Great place to stay for a few days. Cool location. Very detailed instructions for everything that made staying super easy.
7116795,55431826,2015-12-01,13917941,Sam,The apartment was a great space in a fantastic location. Definitely recommended!
7116795,56341304,2015-12-12,29075675,Josh,Debbie was a great host. Everything as described and very nice remodel.
5194332,37989867,2015-07-12,34695266,Erik,"My partner and I were looking for a clean, safe, affordable place to stay while on a short visit to Seattle. Teresa's place met these qualifications and more. Teresa was very warm, welcoming, and helpful. She was flexible with our arrival and departure times and provided great advice about nearby places to go and local transportation options.
The accommodations are even nicer than the pictures and description - very clean, airy, and well-decorated. Teresa provided fresh towels, all the kitchen amenities we could need, and even yummy granola, yogurt, and fruit for breakfast (not a full kitchen, but there's a microwave and hotplate under the counter!). 
The neighborhood is upscale and quiet, even in spite of the popular footpath to Lake Washington just down the street from Teresa's (we didn't get a chance to check it out, but the lake looked lovely from the back patio!). One word of caution - the neighborhood is quite hilly, so, if driving in, be prepared to park on narrow, two-way, sloped streets.
Teresa is new to airbnb hosting, but in our opinion she's doing a stellar job - thanks for having us Teresa! :)"
5194332,38610649,2015-07-17,3953197,Julia,"Both Liam and I both thought we had hit the jackpot with this listing. The studio is located in a very lovely and quiet neighbourhood. Teresa is extremely warm and friendly, I only wish we could have chatted with her more! Inside, the studio is beautifully laid out and decorated, and everything was very comfortable. Teresa had gone above and beyond with the breakfast items she provided; it was very thoughtful. The views from the studio to Lake Washington were breathtaking, and the lake itself is down a short flight of stairs. We spend a lot of our time walking, running, and enjoying dinner around the lake. Transport into Seattle from the house was very easy (there are 2 buses and a light rail), and it took about 20 minutes. I cannot recommend this place enough, thank you so much Teresa!"
5194332,39020375,2015-07-20,32525799,Adina,"This place was fantastic! Teresa was so inviting, friendly, and helpful and we didn't even get to meet her face-to-face. The place is absolutely beautiful with a wonderful view of the lake from the patio. The suite was clean, airy, and refreshing. This is only the second time we have used air bnb and this experience has made us not even consider an alternative means of lodging from here on out. Can't say enough about the wonderful stay at Teresa's place and you would be lucky to be able to experience it too. "
5194332,39506722,2015-07-24,37728,Janet,"What a beautiful studio space!  The studio is spacious, clean (no perfumes or heavy scents) , cozy, and private.  The studio has a comfy bed, huge sofa, giant television, and is well appointed with all the things you would need to cook a meal.  Bonus--Teresa left everything we needed to make a yummy, healthy breakfast.  I also appreciated Teresa stocking the kitchen with dish soap, and there was soap in the bathroom, as well as shampoo.  The reason I mention the soap is because we've stayed at Airbnb homes that haven't had soap in the shower, and NO toilet paper in the bathroom, so I always appreciate when someone is thoughtful enough to provide these things.   Teresa was great at getting back to us when we had questions, she is an awesome host. Thank you Teresa!   I highly recommend this five star studio.   "
5194332,40452728,2015-07-31,34982324,Sara,"We loved Terea’s home.  From the minute you walk up to the house, you know you are in for a nice retreat.  This was my first Airbnb stay and Teresa set the bar high.  The basement studio is spacious, clean, bright and open and nicely decorated. There’s a gorgeous peek of the lake from the patio.  It’s worth taking a walk down the stairs on S Dose to Lake Washington.  Teresa  thoughtfully left yogurt in the fridge along with berries, coffee and creamer.   In all, it was a perfect stay; we really enjoyed ourselves. "
5194332,40914357,2015-08-03,34382665,Rachel,"Our stay at Teresa's was absolutely perfect. While we originally considered Airbnb as a cheaper alternative to a hotel, we experienced more comfort and luxury at Teresa's than we ever could have at a hotel. Not only is the space beautiful, clean, and airy, but Teresa went above and beyond in stocking it with anything we could ever need—granola, yogurt, a plethora of kitchen utensils, even beer in the fridge! After a long day of exploring Seattle, we loved being able to come back and relax in the hot tub on the beautiful patio area. Like others have said, I can't say enough great things about the studio and Teresa as a host. We truly wish we could've stayed longer!"
5194332,41365253,2015-08-07,1649572,Britney,"Very clean and spacious place, lots of amenities were provided such as towels, soap, and breakfast. Bed is big but firm so if you like soft mattresses you might be uncomfortable sleeping. I opted to sleep on the couch because I found it more relaxing. Teresa was very nice and gave us our privacy but was available to answer questions if need be. We were there while the owners were home and I think they were painting or doing some kind of project upstairs because there was lots of banging around late at night. Thankfully my husband and I are used to apartment life so hearing neighbors doesn't bother us as much as some. It is close to the lake but it's a tiring walk if you're not in shape because you have to go up and down a beautiful but huge flight of stairs and cross a street to get there. Overall, for the price we would stay here again. Thanks Teresa!"
5194332,42398657,2015-08-13,17151009,Deborah,Teresa provided us with a fabulous space during our visit to Seattle.  We had our own entrance with a deck near the water and a hot tub as well.  The living space was absolutely beautiful and included a kitchen.  All the amenities were provided including food for breakfast. The house is located close to public transportation and is a great choice for someone who enjoys privacy.  
5194332,42680429,2015-08-15,275269,Inna,"We had a great time at Teresa's apartment! Stunning place, well equipped and beautifully furnished! Even breakfast with fresh fruits was in the fridge! Thank you for all your attention, Teresa! "
5194332,43045681,2015-08-17,124957,Roman,"Teresa provided us a wonderful space that we really loved. The studio was extremely comfortable and we just wanted to spend more time there. The hot tub was an excellent addition and the newly added queen size bed was very comfortable. We also took a wall to the lake and loved it as well. My only criticism, and through no fault of Teresa's was that it was a bit further from the downtown area than I expected. We rented a car and it took us about 20 minutes to get there."
5194332,46597436,2015-09-12,37844324,Rachel,"The photos of Teresa's Airbnb rental hardly do it justice! The high ceilings and beautiful bathroom were a few of the surprises that awaited us. Additionally, the outdoor space is incredible, with gorgeous landscaping and a view of/access to Lake Washington that blew us away. We went to the Thai restaurant the Teresa recommended and the food was fantastic. It was the perfect way to start our Pacific Northwest adventure!"
5194332,47159945,2015-09-16,27922639,Kelly,"After walking around downtown Seattle for the afternoon, I arrived at this exceptionally beautiful studio. The view from the abundant windows as well as the elegantly decorated apartment made me wish I had an extra day to lounge around and take advantage of all the amenities available. 

Don't hesitate to stay here, it is perfect. Five star accommodations!! Thank you Teresa!"
5194332,47259002,2015-09-17,31170423,Jenny,We loved staying at Teresa's place and would highly recommend it. It was so comfortable and stylish. Great to take a walk by the lake in the morning and very convenient for a bus to downtown. I think it was even nicer than the pictures!  
5194332,48281345,2015-09-25,29763420,Allison,"We loved staying here - by far the beat Airbnb experience we've had!  Teresa provides breakfast, the studio is stocked with fluffy towels and a DVD player and Netflix are available. Great location: short walk to the bus or train stops to get downtown and walkable to yummy restaurants (Mioposto and Heyday) nearby. We loved walking on along Lake Washington each morning!   "
5194332,48876234,2015-09-29,34998298,Danae,"Teresa is amazing! The house is perfect and the location is just a block from the lake! Looking out the windows and doors you have a great view! We had never been to Seattle before and she gave us plenty of recommendations and answered all of our questions that we had. If we ever visit Seattle again, I am getting a hold of Teresa! "
