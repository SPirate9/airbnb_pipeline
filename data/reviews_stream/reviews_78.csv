They were very flexible when we arrived a little early, they gave us all te help we needed, and were extremely accommodating. What excellent hosts. They really went above and beyond. "
3293438,51955832,2015-10-25,2112383,Ivania,"It was a pleasure staying at Paul's place. It was just as photos. The location was great. A short drive from downtown and just 2 blocks away from Starbucks, Walgreen's and other businesses. Paul picked us up from the light rail which was great. He and John were so thoughtful to provide breakfast items and snacks. They also gave us suggestions as to where to go in the city. I would definitely stay there again. "
3293438,52350333,2015-10-28,15793406,Barbara,"The house is beautiful and the apartment is set up to meet all of your needs.  The stocked frig and breakfast food went above and beyond our expectations. We enjoyed the hot tub and tranquil atmosphere of the back 
Yard area.  The walk to Pike's Place Market is almost an hour but is pleasant and there are busses you can take. I would recommend this place! "
3293438,52507860,2015-10-30,35337199,Dana,"Awesome experience just outside downtown! John picked me up at the light rail, and gave me a tour of the property and apartment. The fridge was stocked and they let us check-in early which was very kind. It was just perfect for the two of us. Comfortable, affordable, and only one block to the bus downtown. 5 stars all the way :)"
3293438,52706947,2015-11-01,38446696,Alfredo,Five stars!!! hands-down best value in Seattle! 
3293438,53012080,2015-11-03,2672562,Ellen,We had a great time. The apartment was charming and very comfortable. Paul and John were very accommodating to our needs. We came with our bikes and were able to store them in the covered yard. The neighborhood was lovely. We would certainly stay again. 
3293438,53153767,2015-11-05,702535,Erik,"Is there a perfect button? The space is exactly as described and is meticulously maintained. The pantry and fridge were pleasantly and surprisingly well stocked. Amenities include 2 robes. Communication was excellent (pre, during and post). The host maintains the apartment perfectly with precise attention to detail. Easy free parking. Easy access to 90/Bellevue, 405 Downtown. The bed is comfortable. Dimmers on lights. Separate thermostats. The hot tub is on a private patio, very clean (no foam or bleach fumes) and was the perfect temperature.  Thank you for a wonderful stay. i would totally stay here again."
3293438,53628093,2015-11-10,45465790,John,"Before we even arrived, John and Paul made us feel welcome and were very attentive.  They thought of every detail including the peanut m&m's!!!  John went out of his way to make reservations at a spectacular restaurant for our anniversary.  
Very nice guys and clean, well kept place!"
3293438,55802159,2015-12-06,46809575,Kerry,"We completely enjoyed our time in Seattle, staying in your charming apartment.  The accommodations were as described and we were very cozy and warm on a rainy weekend.

John was so kind to pick us up from the train station! We really appreciated all the personal touches that made us feel so welcome!  He also recommended several things to see and do and did not lead us wrong!  The orca passes were awesome, we even left a little balance for the next guests!

The breakfast food was such an added bonus, it made it so much nicer to not have to go out looking for a breakfast every morning!  

Thank you both again, we'll definitely stay here again when we come to Seattle and/or recommend it to our friends!

Sincerely,

Lance & Kerry"
3293438,56482913,2015-12-14,28042145,Kerry,"What a great spot!  The airbnb itself was amazing.  Spacious, well stocked, located close to public transportation and in a convenient neighborhood. Paul even came and picked me up at the train station. Will definitely try to stay here again next time I find myself in Seattle. "
3293438,57030891,2015-12-21,48272464,Amber,"The hosts made us feel very welcome. They were very kind. The description however was a little bit misleading. I had no idea when I booked that we were going to be staying in an attic made into an apartment above their house. However, it turned out well. "
3293438,57351662,2015-12-24,51847758,Kurt,"Paul is great! He communicated with us up to the point when we arrived and showed us where everything was. Like having a friendly concierge :) We enjoyed the hot tub our first evening and he gave us plenty of places to check out. We like our privacy and Paul was very respectful unlike some other places I've stayed. He went out of town and had his friend Barry there to help in any way possible. I'm a tall guy at almost 6'4"" so the shower is at an angle, you can really only fit one at a time in there but can soak in the bathtub if you want. Barry ended up offering us a ride to the train station and we found out we both work in the same field! It was such a pleasant trip I would definitely stay there again. Oh they also gifted us some delicious walnut holiday dessert bread and wished us a Merry Christmas; so very kind hearted."
5620928,34615704,2015-06-09,32717589,Tessa,"Paul and Rachel were extremely friendly and hospitable. Their private apartment is beautiful, clean, and cozy. We enjoyed the comfortable king size bed, their little patio and having a private bathroom. We felt very safe while staying there because the apartment complex is gated and the neighborhood is fairly quiet.
The location is great! We could easily walk to Lake Union and sit by the water and watch all the beautiful sailboats go by. Fremont was also easy to walk to and we had a lot of good food there including chocolate at the Theo factory (heaven). If we wanted to go down town we could easily take a short bus ride to Pikes Place. 
I recommend staying with Paul and Rachel if you're in Seattle! They are extremely helpful with anything you need. The apartment is charming and a great location."
5620928,34903632,2015-06-13,14520689,Suzy,"Rachel was very welcoming, and gave us great directions, and was there to show us around when we arrived.

The suite was extremely comfortable and clean. Convenient to the Fremont area and the lake with ample free parking on the street.

We would absolutely book here again."
5620928,35042295,2015-06-14,35346814,YiXin,"Nice location in a safe and quiet neighbourhood (quick drive to Capitol Hill, Downtown, Ballard), with separate access to the apartment block and the suite. The room and attached bath/shower were clean and tidy.

Rachel and Paul were very thoughtful hosts - fridge with two jugs of water, microwave, desk etc. were all provided. We had a very limited amount of time in Seattle so didn't really chat with Paul, but he was very helpful with local advice on traffic and neighbourhoods.

We'd be happy returning to stay with them!"
5620928,35591199,2015-06-20,28435140,Zhumin,"We had a very good stay in Rachel and Paul 's Master Suite for 6 days. Rachel is very nice. Very thoughtful, helpful though we are not native English language. 
We are very comfortable in the king size bed. The room is clean and space is large. Private entrance is awesome, though we back late (there is long day in summer). Private bathroom is very clean almost has everything we need. There are many books in room for your reading.
The location is prefect. Near downtown. Walking to Lake Union is beautiful ! It took us about 40 minutes to walk to downtown, we enjoy walking! We went to Washington Park Arboretum by bicycle!

We are very happy for staying. Will definitely come back next time!


"
5620928,37226127,2015-07-05,35905798,Greg,"Rachel made me feel at home. The accommodations were as described and very comfortable. The only minor issue was the parking on the street...it was a holiday weekend so it may have added to the challenge.
But all in all would recommend staying here"
5620928,37423029,2015-07-06,7717537,Shreejoy,"Nice and very comfortable place. The host was really kind in allowing us the use of their bikes, and providing us ideas for restaurants to try out."
5620928,38042264,2015-07-12,36908229,Thuy-Mai,"Clean, comfy, and convenient!  Accommodations were very nice and located close to many places worth visiting like the Space Needle and Pike's Place.  There was also ample free street parking nearby, which was a major plus.  Highly recommended. "
5620928,38550331,2015-07-16,37729077,Chris,"Rachel & Paul were very welcoming.  The accomodation was exactly as described and photographed.  It's close ( a short walk) to local shopping and dining.  (Lot's of yummy Thai resturants) and the Queen Anne District.  

I would definitely book again."
5620928,39394421,2015-07-23,30347092,Caroline & Dave,"Fantastic, large bedroom/private bath, in a great location. Easy access to downtown as well as interstates and other neighborhoods, on a bus line."
5620928,40191472,2015-07-28,29539019,Ha Young,The host canceled this reservation 7 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
5620928,40378407,2015-07-30,37729077,Chris,Had another great stay at Rachel & Paul's.  They are very accomodating and I look forward to staying with them again in the future.
5620928,41137677,2015-08-04,7534308,John,"Although we didn't meet Paul, Rachel was extremely accommodating. Right from the start, our communication was excellent, with everything from directions to things to do and see in the area. Rachel very kindly offered to pick us up from the train station after our journey from Vancouver to Seattle. She was immediately very friendly and told us so much about the area.
We had a large room in the basement of a block. The bed was huge and wifi reception was not an issue. There was no kettle or plates in the room, but I suspect this was simply an oversight and only mention it as an observation - not a complaint or criticism - as there was a microwave with some cutlery too.
The location is very good also. There is no huge supermarket nearby but there are plenty places to eat and buy food. It is a 15 bus ride to Downtown Seattle and is in Fremont, a small town with some very individual shops. It is also a short bus ride from Ballard , another lovely but more vibrant town. Check both of these places on Google for more information.
The whole area is also extremely bike friendly. Rachel went out her way to ensure we had bikes available to us throughout our stay.
This was one of our best experiences from a very kind and knowledgeable host and I would definitely recommend staying here on your visit to Seattle. 
"
5620928,51225854,2015-10-18,28132311,Tessa,"This is a great downstairs unit with a huge bed, a nice washer and dryer, and a great / clean bathroom. I really enjoyed my stay and Rachel was beyond accommodating. Much more comfortable than a hotel - although I would mention there isn't a TV which didn't bother me, but might be something someone else would want. "
1905473,13720164,2014-06-02,14100034,Bryan,"I had a great time staying at Stephen's bungalow!
Stephen and Jen were excellent hosts! They even invited me out to a show in Fremont where their friend's band was playing. It was a great time!
The place was clean, and is a great location in the central district. Buses very close to downtown or the university district.

I highly recommend staying here! I might just stay there again! :D"
1905473,16589568,2014-07-29,4982727,Walter,"Steve and Jen were great hosts. They helped us find our way around and gave us some suggestions on what to see. The location of the house was close to the bus line and very walkable.  
I would recommend it."
1905473,17102571,2014-08-07,11529777,Shaowu,房主是一对朝气蓬勃的年轻人，热情、好客、健谈。房间舒适方便，房间里的装饰画多是 Stephen的杰作。特别让我们喜欢的是他们的小院，那里简直就是一个小植物园，有玫瑰花，绣球花，金银花，薰衣草，野菊花等；还有黑莓，蓝莓，覆盆子，草莓。有李子树，小柠檬树，树上果实累累。还有我第一次看到的啤酒花藤。小院里除了有花有果还有蔬菜，有西兰花，卷心菜，西红柿，辣椒，还有甜菜，土豆，南瓜，葱头，居然还有三颗燕麦。小院里还有许多我叫不上来的植物。房东的环保做得非常到位，他对每一件废弃物都能根据再利用价值进行细致的分类，绝不乱丢。傍晚，坐在小院里闻着花香，谈着天是非常惬意的事。这是一个伟大的小院，有着非常好的房东。强烈推荐！
1905473,18803912,2014-09-01,7181828,Matt,"What a great place to stay for PAX!  While we didn't see our hosts much since we were at the convention and touring Seattle, they were very nice for the time we visited.  Check In/Out was very easy. The location is close to the bus line, but we decided to drive/take Lyft out of convenience (~$8).  Parking is very easy here!  Their garden is lovely, and if you're lucky they may have fresh eggs in the morning!  They are very environmentally friendly and have a beautiful home!"
1905473,34229960,2015-06-06,32342675,Haiyan,It was a beautiful house that Stephen has and we truly enjoy our stay. 
1905473,35420875,2015-06-18,35887144,Sean,The host canceled this reservation 2 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
6362918,32653710,2015-05-19,31309601,Rebecca,"Kevin got back to me quickly, which was important in my situation, so I really appreciated it.  He was extremely communicative and met me at the door with the key.  He also checked in partway through my stay.  The apartment is just as appears in the photos- super-charming with what I thought was incredible art.  The neighborhood is also fantastic, particularly for bars and restaurants and nightlife in general.  I found his guidebook to be extremely helpful.  If I had one thing that I would warn about, it would be that this a busy neighborhood and the apartment is right across the street from a music venue and it can be a bit loud on the weekend.  However, if that doesn't bother you, this location is so incredible, I found it to be completely worth it."
6362918,32868336,2015-05-22,33669571,Andy,"A nice apartment in an older building under restoration - the pictures capture the place exactly.  Everything was extremely clean and well prepared, and Kevin was great to deal with.  A nice place and a great value.  Also nicely located in an interesting Seattle neighborhood, and a great central place to get around the city easily.  

My only caution would be to say that this is a downtown apartment near restaurants and night clubs, so there's a fair bit of noise outside until pretty late.  "
6362918,33305611,2015-05-26,14804414,Konstantin,"Kevin was a great host and gave us tips and recommendations on Seattle and the surrounding area. The apartment is in a good location next to shops, restaurants, and bars and is close to Space Needle, Pike Place, etc. Kevin was communicative and very helpful. There is a music venue across the street that can get loud at times.  "
6362918,33469008,2015-05-28,5368495,Amey Rene,"Kevin was awesome! Met us to give us the keys and made our stay easy peasy.

Place is as described and was perfect for our needs!

Would stay again!"
6362918,34086142,2015-06-04,7157533,Maureen,"Kevin was the consummate host. He was thoughtful, communicative, and helpful. I would happily rent from him again."
6362918,34151049,2015-06-05,9332650,Andrew,"Was in an awesome neighborhood! Walkable to a ton of restaurants, bars, music venues, and Pike Market. The place itself was great, and Kevin was a great host."
6362918,34881796,2015-06-13,33527172,Alan,"This was my first airbnb experience, and it was a great one! Kevin was a pleasure to work with, and the apartment is exactly as described. Perfect location, close to Seattle Center (Space Needle), Pike Place market, Centennial Park, and Downtown. As others have mentioned, it is right across from a music venue, but it never really bothered me (or my wife). Would definitely rent this place again if we were going back to the Belltown/Downtown Seattle area."
6362918,35109949,2015-06-15,2522209,Phillip,Kevin handed me the keys in the lobby and very accommodating since we arrived later than expected. Space is clean and just like the pictures. Location was perfect in the heart of Belltown.  Walking distance to Pike Place and to Space Needle. 
6362918,35474760,2015-06-19,33067170,Wil,"Kevin was an excellent host. He was flexible in accommodating my arrival/departure, and, since he lives in the building, he was available and communicative throughout my stay. His place is exactly as advertised, and I found it met all of my needs for my four-night stay. Yes, as the other reviews noted, this apartment is in an area with oftentimes bustling nightlife -- I found that to be a huge advantage! For those less party-inclined, he offered earplugs to help drown out the noise. I'd definitely stay again upon my return to Seattle!"
6362918,35810871,2015-06-22,15864919,Barat,"This is a great apartment, conveniently located and comfortable.  Kevin is a great host, very friendly and accommodating.   He lives in the building and is available to assist at pretty much any time.  We wanted to make a meal for ourselves plus daughter and her boyfriend, and Kevin lent us extra cookware along with additional plates, flatware and cutlery, and he let us use the rooftop (technically part of his apartment, not the rental).  We had a wonderful experience."
6362918,36107114,2015-06-25,365565,Erin,Great place to stay in a great location. It was especially convenient getting off light rail. Kevin was hospitable and helpful. Easy walking to attractions such as Pike's Market and is located on a street with a vibrant night life. 
6362918,36251177,2015-06-26,7327217,Nicholas,The apartment was very comfortable and in a great location -- right in the middle of Belltown. There are lots of great restaurants and bars only steps away. Kevin was a very nice and accommodating host. Highly recommended.
6362918,36783011,2015-07-01,33155790,Dawn,Fantastic location within walking distance of all local attractions. Kevin was a super host making the stay extremely pleasant and enjoyable. I would recommend this B&B to my friends and plan on returning for another visit. 
6362918,37017873,2015-07-03,5820889,Robert,Kevin was a marvelous host and could not have been more accommodating. He assisted me with getting my hire care safely parked and providing me with advice and locating different places around Seattle. The room was clean and exactly how the photos showed. Staying here in this great location was very easy.
6362918,37070047,2015-07-04,13212388,Arnaud,"Kevin is a great host. He made everything possible for us to have the best time in Seattle. Apartment is OK. Might be a little bit noisy but it didn't bother us too much (there was a huge party in a Club not too far)
I had a great time in Seattle. Thank you. I recommend Kevin as a host. :)"
6362918,37568768,2015-07-08,5382507,Sarah,"We had a lovely time at Kevin's apartment in Belltown.  The place was exactly like the pictures, description and reviews.  We enjoyed checking out the nearby food and drinks, but also got out and around the rest of Seattle using transit and walking.  If you're looking for a place that's walkable in Seattle, this is a great spot!  Thanks Kevin.  :)"
6362918,37974300,2015-07-12,26929276,Duc,"Awesome place to stay while visiting Seattle! We did Seattle the car-free way and staying in Belltown makes it possible, with the Pike Place Market just 3 blocks away, along with all the attractions downtown all within walking distance.

Kevin was very accommodating for our late arrival (midnight) and cheerfully showed us the room when we finally did arrive. Everything is as described. Even the noises from the legendary Crocodile across the street didn't bother us. In fact, it adds a visceral beat to the downtown ambience.

We look forward to another visit to Seattle and definitely stay in this Belltown apartment again. What a gem!"
6362918,38178943,2015-07-13,28938067,Rachel,"Kevin was incredibly accommodating and offered to store our bags for us until the room was ready. He was polite, super flexible and really helpful. He also provided lots of recommendations for things to do and was only a phone call or text away. Kevin was super awesome, and I would definitely stay again. Also, you can't beat the location! It's SO close to pike place market and the space Needle-- it's basically perfect. "
6362918,38327571,2015-07-14,37276428,Kelsey,"Our stay at Kevin's apartment in Belltown was perfect! It was our first trip to Seattle, and our first time using Airbnb and Kevin was more than kind and helpful. The location was very conveniently located and the apartment was freshly cleaned! Could not have asked for an easier stay. "
6362918,38720268,2015-07-18,29946779,Matthew,"Kevin was a great host. Incredibly welcoming but not on top of us. What you see on his posting is what you get. The apartment is clean, has an AC unit, great views (you can see the Space Needle) and you cannot ask for a better location in Seattle. You are in walking distance to everything (Pike Place Market, the Seattle Center, Safeco Field, Seattle Art Museum...). On the block itself there are great restaurants and shops. Belltown is a great neighborhood and Kevin's place is the best way to stay there."
6362918,40096540,2015-07-28,28911866,Chhorvy,"Even though I didn't get to meet Kevin in person, he made sure we had a very comfortable and accommodating stay. The apartment is in the most ideal location - walkable to Pikes Market and the Space Needle and only a short cab ride away from Ballard, Fremont and Capitol Hill. All of Kevin's suggestions were spot on and we had an amazing time in Seattle."
6362918,40467495,2015-07-31,36440183,Matthew,The photos listed represent the place very well. Kevin was very helpful and accommodating for our early arrival. Offered great recommendations for things to do around the city. Apartment is in a great location - very walkable to popular attractions like Pike Place and Space Needle. Also very close to the light rail. Would definitely recommend staying at Kevin's apartment. 
6362918,40907320,2015-08-03,33399211,Kirk,"My wife and I celebrated our anniversary in Seattle and had a great experience. The apartment is a beautiful old building, right in the heart of Belltown, which is within a 5-10 minute walk of all the major attractions in Seattle. A short cab or Uber will get you pretty much anywhere else. There are a lot of great cafes, bars and restaurants all within a block or 2 of the apartment. Even though you are right in the heart of Seattle, you are far enough away from the large hotels that you feel more like a local than a tourist. Kevin greeted us when we arrived and let us into the apartment. The room was very clean and a perfect size for the 2 of us. Kevin lives in the same building so we ran into Kevin a couple of times over the weekend. He was very welcoming, gave us some recommendations, and even baked us cookies on our last night.  Considering the location and the price compared"
6362918,41939470,2015-08-10,33297344,Nick,Listing was comfortable and as advertised. Fantastic part of the city that made walking the city very easy.  Michael was responsive to any needs we had and made sure we got settled in easily. Easily recommended for anyone traveling to the city.
6362918,42139201,2015-08-11,7967900,Elad,"We had a really great time at this apartment. The location is amazing! It is close to all the main places in Seattle and it is close to very nice restaurants and live music bars. The host was super nice and even let us in before checkin time. 
Kevin, thanks a lot for hosting us."
6362918,42393862,2015-08-13,31083497,Scott,"This apartment was exactly what we were looking for! It was in an excellent location, within walking distance of a lot of the main Seattle tourist attractions, but far enough removed that you get a nice flavor of living in the Belltown. Michael was very kind and allowed us to drop our luggage off early, and alerted us immediately to any issues with the rental. A great experience!"
6362918,42537386,2015-08-14,35349520,Nick,"Kevin (and his brother Michael) were very helpful and accommodating.  We didn't have any problems, but Kevin was always available if we needed anything or even for a simple question.  "
6362918,42674018,2015-08-15,4994309,Nancy,Great place to blend in with locals. Fun area to walk and explore shops and cafes. 
6362918,42899611,2015-08-16,38606754,Heidi,"The host was wonderful to work with he was very flexible and helpful. He let us drop of our luggage before check-in, gave us great tips about the neighborhood restaurants and Entertainment. We would recommend his listing to all our Friends and hope to go back there soon."
6362918,44764138,2015-08-29,34459630,Marcia,"The apartment was very conveniently located.  It was spacious, clean, and charming.  The host was very helpful and available. I would heartily recommend staying here and would do so again if I travel to Seattle. "
6362918,45246478,2015-09-01,33641279,Paul,"The apartment was exactly as ""advertised"", no surprises.  And was priced appropriately, so it was a great value.  For us, it truly fit the mantra of LOCATION, LOCATION, LOCATION.   That was perfect.   Kevin was most accommodating for all our needs, from multiple conversations responding to our pre-arrival questions to fixing a few inconveniences after our arrival. Extremely consciencous.    The building is old and shows it, but the apartment was clean and comfortable.  We like a more modern bathroom but we made that work. Bed was comfortable.   Although not a great need this trip the portable A.C. unit was sufficient although it was a hoot that the remote control channel changer on the TV turned the A.C. on and off. We finally just pulled the plug on the A.C. and it was cool enough with the window open but that led to.... If there is one thing that was annoying, it was late night street noise from the bar across the street. But that was also a minor annoyance.  We'd stay again without any hesitation at all."
6362918,45545180,2015-09-03,35973469,Cody,"I requested the room on a very short notice, and Michael was able to accommodate. I didn't really use any of the amenities other than the shower, and immediately after the bed, but they both got the job done. The shower head points at the curtain for some reason, and it's awkward to move around in there, but not the end of the world. Michael was very friendly and amenable."
6362918,45627629,2015-09-04,33911571,John,Fantastic experience all around. The apartment is clean and cozy and is centrally located in a great part of Seattle. The hosts (brothers Kevin and Michael) were incredibly welcoming and responsive both before and during our stay. We'll stay here again the next time we're in Seattle. 
6362918,45938821,2015-09-07,28632769,Stacie,"The listing was exactly as described--perfect little studio close to everything! Michael and Kevin were very responsive and helped us right away with any questions/suggestions to make our stay there easier. The apt was surrounded by great restaurants and bars, lots of options to choose from. It was louder than expected due to the bar across the street that had live music every night. All things considered though, we had a great time and being in the thick of everything added to the Seattle experience. Thanks guys!"
6362918,47146792,2015-09-16,15107843,Mike,"Our stay was great. The host was very nice and helpful. The location is great, as it is within walking distance of both pikes place and the space needle. The room was clean and nicely decorated."
6362918,47291505,2015-09-17,42774722,Nicole,Our stay with Kevin was great. He was very accommodating to all our needs. The place was nice and clean. Loved the area. Close to all the tourist attractions including Pike Place Market. Kevin was nice enough to hold our luggage before and after check in. 
6362918,47465434,2015-09-19,36225972,Brie,"Overall nice enough apartment, lacking certain amenities, including things like toilet paper! Host was nice, building close to bars and very hard to sleep at night due to noise. "
6362918,48169855,2015-09-24,5829490,Tameka,"Apartment exactly as described. Awesome location, very clean, attentive hosts, VERY comfortable bed. As others have said, if you're not urban and have noise sensitivity, not the place for you. As a launch pad to the city, it's great."
6362918,48879215,2015-09-29,17513893,Phil,"Man, we had a great time while staying in this apartment. Belltown is absolutely the place to be, and the building has tons of character. Cool art in the hallways as well as the unit. Michael was very helpful and easy to work with. The one downside: The street below the windows was very loud on weekend nights. Not sure what more Michael could do about that; he does provide a couple of good noise-canceling devices."
6362918,49017791,2015-09-30,25326760,Noelle,The place was exactly as described. Michael and his brother were super nice and let us check in early which helped a lot. 
6362918,49880453,2015-10-07,18971554,Yair,"We enjoyed our stay in Michael's apartment very much. The apartment is very cozy and has its very special atmosphere. The bed was very comfortable, great heating and there is plenty of space for a couple. Michael was extremely kind and helpful with everything and communication was seamless. 

People who are sensitive to noise should take into account that the noise from the street and the club at night is significant (although we heard great music performances...). "
6362918,50072593,2015-10-09,39867846,Sue,"Our host was available, although we didn't need to contact him.  The room was warm and cozy and the bed very comfortable. We knew The Crocodile was across the street but didn't think about a possible music event there.  However, the music was good and we had no more trouble sleeping than we would elsewhere in the city."
6362918,50495430,2015-10-12,27415226,Rosa,"The apartment is just as described - very central, within walking distance of tons of sites. perfect amount of space for 2, and the entire apartment was very clean. It was a touch loud (overlooks a music venue) but there was a sound machine available that drowned out the noise and we slept perfectly fine. Michael always made himself really accessible to us, and was always quick to respond to our texts. Check in and out were totally painless! Would highly recommend!"
6362918,50895279,2015-10-15,44443686,James,"Can't say enough good things about our host and our stay other than location, location, location! Perfect spot for our agenda. "
6362918,51280202,2015-10-19,10218201,Ramsey,"Easy to coordinate. Responsive and flexible. Very polite and accommodating. Very good experience, recommend Michaels space."
1856851,9202608,2013-12-13,9858405,Kahyee,Nikki and Will were great. They made our transition to Seattle as easy as possible. They even let us keep our stuff in their garage. I would recommend them to anyone looking for a convenient place to stay.
1856851,9615344,2014-01-03,3229901,Jing,"Our room was clean and comfortable, and we were also provided toiletries, which were a nice touch. Nikki and William were very friendly, and even shared some banana bread with us!"
1856851,10899686,2014-03-12,8168786,Falcon Darkstar,"This is a really nice, clean house, backing right out onto a pathway.  Nikki and William were incredibly hospitable (and clearly enjoy having guests).  They went out of their way to make my stay with them comfortable.  I definitely recommend this place."
1856851,11115318,2014-03-21,12576618,Tae Il,My first time using Airbnb and it was great.  I think mainly due to great host I had in Nikki and William.  They were the extremely friendly and helpful.  They pick me up at the station when I came and dropped me off when I left.  They helped me with directions and ideas for places to go.  The room was just as described.  The best part of the room was the private bath and private entrance made it seem like it was its own apartment.  Their cat Munchkin is adorable and friendly.   I would stay again and would recommend to anyone.  Thanks Nikki and William for the stay.    
1856851,12836419,2014-05-12,9851806,Daryl,"Very friendly and helpful, nice breakfast"
1856851,13154763,2014-05-20,240857,Brenna,"Nikki an William couldn't have been sweeter. They were incredibly welcoming and also understanding when we wanted to stay to ourselves to recuperate from hectic traveling. The room was perfect- great size and the bathroom was nice too. The huge closet easily held all of our luggage. I didn't remember that there was a minifridge and microwave in the room- what a huge bonus!  

I had a great time getting to know Nikki better while William was out. Their baby is so cute and doesn't cry at night so no worries about being woken up by her. 

All in all, a great visit!"
1856851,13264830,2014-05-23,11658134,Tracy,Had a great stay with Nikki and William. Room was neat and clean and love finding rooms with private baths!  Had my own entrance which I like as well. Home was quiet and I wouldn't hesitate to stay again.  
1856851,13486918,2014-05-28,15398662,Elizabeth,"My son and I had a great stay at Nikki and William's home in Seattle. The home was located in a beautiful neighborhood and the bus line into the city was easy, inexpensive and part of the experience- no car needed. Nikki was very helpful, sweet and accommodating. This was part of a fun trip for us and I would recommend staying here to all. "
1856851,13611818,2014-06-01,14231865,Andrew,It was our first time using Airbnb and really did not know what to expect. It was a great experience and Nikki and William were very accommodating. We asked for a list of things to do while in Seattle and Nikki sent us a map of attractions and restaurants that was very helpful. Also we can attest that there is no noise transfer from their new addition.
1856851,13780629,2014-06-04,12519036,Carol,"We definitely enjoyed staying with Nikki and William. Nikki picked us up at the lite rail and  William gave us a lot of information on how to get to the places  that we wanted to see in Seattle.  Great bike path behind there home that we enjoyed walking and only a couple of blocks to catch the bus downtown. If we ever come to Seattle again I hope that we will be able to stay with this couple.  By the way they have a beautiful baby girl.
 "
1856851,13922983,2014-06-08,15338873,Myrna,"Stayed 3 nights, I was gone most of the time, all I needed was exactly what they have -comfortable bed and bath, and the sweet resident kitty was a bonus. Nikki was very helpful and patient on the cell while a Seattle friend was driving me there, since neither of us managed to have a copy of the directions, or a smart phone. If you are someone looking for a coffee shop and breakfast first thing in the a.m., or need a trendy area, you will need to travel. This is a residential neighborhood off  a business strip of Rainier Ave., which handily has 2 bus lines and frequent service that will take you directly to either Capital Hill or the Intl Area downtown, or heading south to the Columbia City area, where you will find shops and restaurants.There's a nice path immediately behind the residence that will give you a pleasant walk downtown, assuming you're a serious walker, and not too many steps the other direction, on the bridge over Rainier Ave, you will get a great view of Mt. Rainier, when it's not hiding in plain sight in a shroud of clouds. There is a major freeway right on the other side of the path, so if you aren't used to city noise, or are a light sleeper, it could be an issue, though ear plugs would take care of that for you. This was my first Airbnb experience, I have no complaints. I was not infrequently disenchanted of the fancy B&Bs where I'd stayed on numerous trips, and as I stated in the beginning, all I need is a comfortable bed and bath. Since the idea of traveling to a new place is to be out and about exploring, this is a nice alternative to hotels and traditional B&Bs."
1856851,17739560,2014-08-17,10367433,Devyn,"I stayed with Nikki and William for a little over two months. They were very nice, informative, and accommodating. They were able to pick me up from the light rail station when I arrived and dropped me off when I was leaving. They let me tag along with them to the grocery store every week which was very nice. The room and the house is exactly as described. Their cat, Munchkin, is very sweet and loves to be petted. Overall, the summer with them was fantastic and I would recommend staying with them."
1856851,18390152,2014-08-25,16593324,Go,"A nice private room with its own bathroom and entrance. The room was as described and they were respectful of my space. The house was in an ideal location; a residential neighborhood but minutes away from downtown, pike place and bell town. I would totally stay here again!"
1856851,18511543,2014-08-27,16682347,Claire Luzia,"Staying at Nikki and William's place was a convenient starting point to explore the city of Vancouver. There are busses and a walking trail that get you to the city centre from their place. The room has a big walk-in closet where we could easily fit our two suitcases. The room also has a small fridge and microwave which cannot be seen from the pictures. The private bathroom has a nice design, it just took a little time until I figured out how to get the shower working. The highway is very close so you have constant noise from there, but since it is a monotonous sound, it didn't bother us when sleeping. Since Nikki and William rent out several rooms, you might run into someone in the kitchen that you don't know.
We just met the hosts for a couple of minutes when we arrived because we stayed with them during the week and they were on their regular work schedules. But Nikki was very fast with answering our questions via Airbnb messages. We could also do our laundry there and they were very accomodating when we wanted to leave our luggage at their place for a couple of hours on our last day."
1856851,18871257,2014-09-02,13370278,Danielle,"Nikki and William were great hosts.  She contacted me before I was due to arrive, answered my questions, and met me upon arrival.  The room and bathroom were very clean, and it was nice that the room has a mini-fridge and microwave.  There is also a walk-in closet which was perfect for our suitcases.  My boyfriend and I are allergic to cats, but the downstairs area is separate from where the cat wanders around, so we felt wonderful!  We had a great experience and I highly recommend this home to others.  "
1856851,19058141,2014-09-05,7685271,Adlai,"Nice room w bathroom, private entrance is awesome, nice deck right outside with seating and access to a nearby bike trail. Nikki & William were great hosts."
1856851,19108537,2014-09-06,16536989,Cortney,Nikki and William's place was great. Super clean and wonderful to have our own bathroom and entrance. We loved the abundance of biking options in their neighborhood. It was also a very easy walk along the Greenway to Seattle's downtown area. I would definitely recommend staying here.
1856851,19295415,2014-09-09,20700670,Curt,"My friend and I had a great experience. The location worked well to get around the city by walking, taking buses and when crunched a but more for time using Uber/Lyft. The room was private and all we needed. The bed was comfortable for a good nights rest. We didn't spend much time in the room and barely saw our hosts, but they were always quick to respond to any questions via text and accommodating to our needs."
1856851,19673395,2014-09-16,17525101,Diane,"Communication was very, very good with Nikki. The place was easy to find and was in a great location for all we needed to do while in Seattle. The place was clean, and Nikki was very nice during the visit. "
1856851,20151060,2014-09-24,20417135,Jeanne,"My daughter and I shared this clean, comfortable room for a week with it's large walk-in closet and en suite bathroom and the bonus of a microwave and large mini-fridge.  The private entrance kept us from disturbing this friendly and welcoming couple; the on-street parking was always available and the neighborhood was on a little-traveled street.  It does back up to a nearby freeway soundwall, but we did not find the level of the traffic noise intrusive.  I should also add it backs up to a city bike/walking path and park, making for a short (1 mile) and pleasant walk into the International District.  I was impressed by how well-located this option was - close to both major downtown freeways and cross-town surface streets. Nikki and William responded to my inquiries within minutes and were very helpful in helping me sort out logistics and providing information on places to see.  They had also stocked the room with maps and brochures which were real timesavers in figuring out driving routes to places we wanted to see or had to be - a bonus for someone who is challenged by Google Maps' turn-by-turn directions! And the bathroom had the helpful basics (body wash, shampoo, conditioner and lotion) while we were there, but you may want to confirm that with your host.  We will recommend airbnb and this choice to anyone looking to travel or in need of a place to stay as they relocate to Seattle. "
1856851,21871277,2014-10-26,16805207,Roberto,"I have been a long time (more than a month) and was my first time both in Seattle and US. Nikki & William helped on everything they could and make me feel at home. I also been able to share time with their daughter which is lovely and cat which is super-super friendly. 

I will recommend anybody who wants a nice and warm welcome to came to this home. "

1856851,25991503,2015-02-01,23615193,Ben,William and Nikki were great hosts. The room was very comfortable and the location is great. Easy access to both Seattle and the East Side.

Nikki and William were very welcoming and helpful during my stay."

We stayed only one night but we really appreciated the area. Easy access to downtown Seattle via the 7 or 9."
1856851,32137024,2015-05-14,11731428,Roy,"Nikki and William were the perfect hosts. They were warm, friendly, and always willing to provide helpful information. The room is extremely comfortable and more than met our needs. Their location is perfect for accessing downtown via I-90.  We look forward to staying with them again the next time we are in Seattle."

1856851,43017434,2015-08-17,18596485,Kylie,"Nikki and William were fantastic hosts. The private room and bathroom were perfect for my long term stay. I had a busy summer schedule and it was easy to come and go without disturbing them and their young daughter. The room was clean, came with plenty of storage space, a lovely bathroom, and even had a mini library of books and some movies. I also loved the location - you can walk > 5 minutes to bus stops that will take you all over the Seattle area. You are also super close to I-90 which was perfect for my commute to Kirkland. I had my car with me, and parking was never a problem at the residence (however downtown parking was sometimes a hassle so taking the buses was a workaround). Overall an absolutely fantastic stay - thanks Nikki and William!"
1856851,44301145,2015-08-25,36535436,Kaitlyn,This was my first Airbnb experience and it was great! Loved the private entrance. Room and restroom were very clean. There is a nice big (empty) closet with plenty of hangers.  Free Wifi and a desk so we could do some work. Neighborhood was very cute and safe. Only took 5 minutes to drive downtown. Would stay there again. Such great hosts. 
1856851,45106805,2015-08-31,38754149,Norm,Listing description was accurate.  We did not meet Nikki or William in person but we did speak with Nikki on the phone. 
1856851,45934865,2015-09-07,27187234,Viola,"We had a really nice stay at Nikki and Williams house. We had our own entrance and it felt like we had our own apartment. We had enough space, a comfortable bed and everything was clean!
The bus station was in walking distance and it took us only 15-20minutes to Seattle downtown. We never met Nikki and William but we texted and they were very helpful. All in all I would recommend this place and would come again! "

1856851,47432486,2015-09-18,38719608,Anand,A great place to stay with convenient access to downtown Seattle. The private entrance makes it easy to get in or out without worrying about disturbing William or the baby. The room was clean and comfortable. Would certainly consider staying here again.  
1856851,47636602,2015-09-21,12368771,Ria,"Our stay with Nikki and William was excellent! We were in town for a wedding and only stayed one night, but they were very helpful. For example, I messaged them about an iron the day of our arrival because my boyfriend's suit for the wedding was wrinkled from travel, and they made sure there was an iron and ironing board in the room when we arrived. Additionally, the room was clean, comfortable, and spacious. Couldn't have asked for more! "
1856851,48113911,2015-09-23,8912676,David,Good sized room and having the private entrance was very nice. The area is safe and quiet as its very residential. Nikki and William were very welcoming and helpful. No problems at all and would gladly stay again.

We were pleased to meet Nikki, William and their adorable Charlotte. Their smile was really a great welcome to Seattle!"

3861673,18603364,2014-08-28,20455262,Claire,"Debbie is a great host! She and her son greeted me and showed me to the separate room behind the house. Their place was easy to find and in a nice, quiet neighborhood. This detached room rental was a great option for me as I knew I would be returning late and did not want to disturb anyone. I could easily go around back at the end of the night with the handy flash light key chain that held the room key. 

I could tell right away that Debbie put a lot of thought into the room making sure that her guests had everything they could possibly need. The bed and pillows were very comfortable providing the good night's sleep I needed for the next day. 

Also, I was able to park right in front of the house on the street which is always a plus in Seattle.

I appreciate the time and thought Debbie put into this rental to make it a comfortable respite from your busy day in the city. I will certainly check with Debbie first the next time I need accommodations in Seattle."
3861673,18611926,2014-08-28,20543710,Igal,"Debbie has gone the extra long miles to make us feel comfortable and at ease. This was my first experience with air B and B and I must say, I did not expect such exceptional professionalism and personal care. With hosts like this, there is no point looking at hotels. 
I will be back here again and encourage anyone to try this brilliant spot!!! 
A+++ "
3861673,18691796,2014-08-30,19583194,Forrest,My daughter and I loved your detached room.  We felt like that we stayed at star 5 hotel. Debbie (host) is so friendly with my girl.  She described in Airbnb is EXACT.  She is very honesty.
3861673,18847010,2014-09-01,3295209,Jason,"The stay here was absolutely perfect and far exceeded expectations. Debbie was very friendly and helpful suggesting local places to visit. The area was quiet and safe, while easy to get to downtown by car.

The room was exceptionally clean and well stocked with towels, soaps, and snacks. The fresh ground coffee for the French press was especially a nice touch.

Would highly recommend for staying in the Seattle area."

The flat has nice, new fittings, space to unpack and my partner and I also appreciated the privacy that the flat offered.

Debbie was a great host -- very warm and welcoming, and interested in making our stay as comfortable as possible. She also makes amazing muffins!"
3861673,19166673,2014-09-07,3040653,John,"The location was perfect for us -- a nice quiet neighborhood near the family member we were in town to visit.
Debbie, our hostess, was a delight. She was friendly, helpful and well organized. We were provided with great instructions for locating the place and it was exactly as described, a private bedroom and bath cottage in the rear of Debbie's home. The room was cosy, spotlessly clean and comfortable.
We hope to find Debbie's accommodations available when we make a return visit to Ballard."
3861673,19246663,2014-09-08,17737194,Malerie,"My husband and I stayed in Debbie's detached guest suite for our anniversary weekend. The room is fantastic. It's even better than it looks from the pictures, and it's immaculately clean. There were several sweet, homey touches (homemade muffins, mints on the nightstand, shower supplies included, etc.). The weekend was hot, but the room stayed cool. The location is perfect - close to everything delightful in Ballard, including fabulous food (Eat at Delancey and Essex). I will stay in this guest suite next time I'm in Seattle, for sure."
3861673,19632237,2014-09-15,20635611,Jin,"It is Suitable room that comfortably fit 2 people. Everything are super clean as ""Five Star Hotels"" The bed was comfortable. Debbie was very kind and friendly. The neighborhood is quiet and lots of restaurants, cafe where are really good, within walking distance. Overall I had a comfortable stay and I would stay here again."
3861673,20039901,2014-09-22,20821020,Natalie,"Debbie's space is amazing. It is inviting, comfortable, stylish, and perfectly located. We were just a few minutes from UW, a short walk from downtown Ballard (my favorite neighborhood in Seattle!), and a short drive from Downtown/City Center. 
Debbie provided everything and more we could have needed to make our stay as comfortable as possible. Homemade muffins, everything we needed for coffee & tea in the morning, toiletries, and an incredibly comfortable bed. 
The room was beautiful as well... Plenty of natural light, roomy bathroom, and closet! I loves that the room was separate from the house which gave us as much privacy as we wanted, but still allowed us to interact with our host - who is so sweet and welcoming! 
I hope to stay here again and highly HIGHLY recommend it!"
3861673,20434886,2014-09-29,5131694,Gunnar," I thoroughly enjoyed my weekend stay at Debbie's private guest studio. The room was beautiful, immaculately clean, very private (with its own entrance) and located in a lovely and quiet neighbourhood. The bed was comfy and everything needed was provided. Debbie was a very attentive host and even gave me a car ride to my workshop on Sunday morning. Highly recommended! 
"
3861673,20593762,2014-10-01,16348921,Steph,"Debbie was a truly wonderful host! I needed a last minute place to sleep before starting my long road trip back to Florida and I found her place and contacted her, and even though I contacted her in the late evening, she got back to me super fast and was able to accommodate me. She was extremely friendly and very helpful with directions and whatnot. When I arrived she showed me the place behind hee house - it was super clean & welcoming and she had a little binder with information & the internet code, dishware/utensils, a little fridge and everything one could possibly need for a comfortable, short stay. The place is quiet and cozy. She was so sweet, even made blueberry muffins to take with me for my trip - and they were yum! :)

Definitely recommend this place to anyone! 5 stars for sure."
3861673,20714947,2014-10-04,13396735,Bradley,This place was a great comfort.  I really enjoyed staying here and felt like I was in a detached hotel.  Thank you so much!
3861673,20777359,2014-10-05,12771565,Tony,"Debbie's place was fantastic! It was a perfect size, spotlessly clean, comfortable and in a great location in Seattle. The bed was so comfortable, the bathroom was perfect, and the extras (flat screen tv with cable, coffee, tea, snacks) made the stay even better. I only wish I had more time in Seattle to stay in the room. I will definitely stay here again. Unfortunately, I didn't get to meet Debbie, but she made me feel very welcome and provided everything I needed for my time in Seattle. "
3861673,20867586,2014-10-06,21784762,Paula,"This was my first time doing Airbnb and it was a great experience. Debbie's house is gorgeous and the guest house is perfect! The location is also great. Debbie was very thoughtful, took care of every single detail- I was very impressed! Thanks for everything Debbie!! I am moving to Seattle next week and I will definitely recommend her place to all visitors."

3861673,21320050,2014-10-14,20383358,Sarah,"Debbie is a fantastic host, friendly, quick to respond and makes delicious blueberry muffins! In Seattle for a weekend away and the location could not be better. Quiet, clean and a beautiful setting. We will definitely re book next time I'm the city. Thank you!"
3861673,21359658,2014-10-15,21874901,Caroline,"Debbie was super helpful and gracious, I needed to print out my boarding pass and luggage receipts and she did everything to make that happen. I had to leave fairly early and Debbie was so sweet about wanting to make sure that I had something for breakfast. The Neighborhood was very quaint, house is located just across from a school which was very quiet from the private room in the backyard. Wish I had more time in Seattle, I'll be back with my husband next time. :) Thank you Debbie your private room is just perfect, super clean and inviting. "
3861673,21667803,2014-10-21,21524406,Sabrina,"Debbie's guest room was awesome. She is friendly and greeted us with a warm smile often. The bed was very comfortable. The coffee was delicious. The bathroom was clean. The neighborhood was adorable and there was plenty of parking in front of the house. She made muffins for us the first morning and left a few snacks in the fridge. With the guest room being detached, we had plenty of privacy and slept wonderfully. I would definitely stay here again. Thank you, Debbie!"
3861673,21710456,2014-10-22,209185,Akua,"debbie was the perfect host with the perfect set-up for an overnighter.

very clean, with plenty of room.  we will be back."
3861673,21758603,2014-10-23,6167950,Sarah,Debbie's guestroom was the perfect place to stay on my trip to Seattle. The detached studio had everything I needed -- from shampoo to coffee and half n' half for the morning -- and even chocolates on the bedside table with a hand-written note. Debbie was a fabulous host with excellent communication and super-organized directions. These little details make all the difference. I highly recommend staying at her studio in Ballard. 
3861673,21965764,2014-10-27,8805247,Helen,"Debbie was an amazing and thoughtful host! You can tell she is an experienced AirBnB host through the communication before and during your stay. 

Her description of the place was as promised and we were extremely satisfied with our stay at Debbie's. It was relatively easy to navigate into downtown Seattle and other neighborhoods. Don't forget to try Paseo :]

I would definitely recommend Debbie to others and would rebook in the future!"
3861673,22090623,2014-10-29,22918901,Eriq,"I was very blessed to find such an oasis. So much personal touch meant all the world. From homemade sweets to individualized messages and clarifies, I could not have asked for a more comfortable and enjoyable experience. I hope to cross paths with Debbie again, and I think this kind of legendary hosting should be the standard. "
3861673,22695493,2014-11-12,20991314,Larissa,"Staying at Debbie's was a fantastic experience! She was very helpful in the planning of our trip (our first to Seattle) and checking in on us occasionally to see if we needed anything. The room was as pictured, super clean and inviting. The fridge was stocked with a few snacks, and she provided scones for us the morning after we arrived (plus fresh half-n-half and warm muffins a few days into our trip!).  Personalized notes, baked goods and a genuineness about her showed that she truly enjoyed hosting us. She has set the bar high for other Airbnb hosts!

Her immediate neighborhood was very quiet and pleasant. We used the buses and rented a car from the rental place a few blocks down the street. No problems with either!

I would highly recommend staying with Debbie. If/when I return to Seattle, I plan to stay with her again!"
3861673,22746078,2014-11-13,13098923,Linda,"Clean, comfortable, warm with amenities like homemade scones on doorstep in the morning. Bathroom is spotless with a tub for soaking away travel soreness. We felt very welcomed. The room is small, so great for 1 person or 2 who get along well. I recommend."
3861673,22785895,2014-11-14,9758242,Eric,"Debbie was amazing! Her guest room was the perfect space, we honestly didn't want to leave. Debbie's attention to detail is honestly unmatched in our experience. She gave us great recommendations on where to eat and hang out. We hope we get the chance to go to Seattle again, and if we do we'll try our hardest to stay with her. She even had some baked goods for us in the morning! Do yourself a favor and stay here, it might be your best airbnb experience, it was ours. "
3861673,22819733,2014-11-15,13243214,Lenore,"The cottage was clean, comfortable, and had everything you need including shampoo and conditioner. It felt as if the floors were heated and it was amazing."
3861673,22910899,2014-11-17,7037587,Sarah,"Debbie was promptly communicative, welcoming, and accommodating.  Her space is lovely, well-built, cozy, comfortable, private, and spotless.  Her personal touches, like in-room french-press coffee and muffins in the fridge, were much-appreciated!  The neighborhood is quiet with easy access to restaurants and waterfront fun.  We loved it.  Highly recommended!    "
3861673,23320515,2014-11-29,19601853,Alison,"Debbie was a fabulous host from the very first interaction.  Her warmth was evident even by email!  She made check-in a breeze, and her guest book made getting settled into the space and connected to the WiFi really easy.  She respected my privacy, but was always a text away if I needed anything.  The brief chats that we had were nice.  She's obviously a caring person who is interested in meeting new people and having new experiences.

The space was exactly as shown and described, and very comfortable.  Debbie has obviously put a lot of thought into making her guests comfortable.  Everything was clean and tidy, the hair dryer had umpf, the water pressure was good, etc.  The bamboo linens were so soft I'm considering buying some for home.  She brought generous (double) portions of fresh baked breakfast items (scones, muffins, quick bread) every other day, with generous pats of butter.  The coffee from Stump Town was delicious (half and half in the fridge).  The system for having her clean the dishes in the main house worked smoothly.  

I was in town to visit family, and couldn't stay with them due to my cat allergy.  This was the perfect set up!  I was close to my family, and had a comfy cozy retreat to return to after being out and about all day.  I would definitely stay with Debbie again, and my family is looking forward to recommending her space to other visitors."
3861673,23407464,2014-11-30,21491566,Tasha,"We had a fantastic stay here! The room was clean and inviting and stocked with snacks, coffee, and baked goods. In a cute area of Ballard. Our interaction with Debbie was brief since we were not at the room much, but she was extremely friendly and welcoming. We would definitely stay here again! "
3861673,23507740,2014-12-02,9501899,Jordan,"Debbie's location in Ballard was fantastic!  Clean, high-quality, and cozy. The radiant heating floors are a nice touch in the cold months. A great spot that I'd try to stay at again if I'm back in Seattle. "
3861673,23595200,2014-12-06,21873465,Leslie,"We felt completely at home at Debbie's space. It was warm, clean, comfortable and perfect for what we needed. I had just had hip replacement surgery and wasn't able to go up the stairs in my own home. We checked in the day I was released from the hospital. I instantly fell asleep in the cozy bed and I am certain it was helpful on my road to recovery. The delicious scones made us feel pampered. Thank you. We will recommend your spot for family members who are visiting. It will be perfect for my dad when he comes to town. "
3861673,23790489,2014-12-10,23436449,Julie Anne,"Debbie's detached room was amazing! She was a great host, super thoughtful, and a plus that she made really good baked goods in advance that lasted us for every morning. Her communication was always timely and professional. I loved how thoughtful she was around hospitality. There was a binder filled with information that really helped my Husband and I navigate our way through suggested restaurants, coffee, and other hangout spots in Ballard. Her place is super clean and she stocks snacks such as: delicious coffee, french press, directions on how to use french press, an electric kettle, dishes, mugs, utensils, half in half in her mini fridge, orange juice, cliff bars, mandarin cuties, tea, an umbrella, books, beach towels, extra towels… All these personal touches made the stay that much more welcoming. The space was just right for two people. This was my first experience in an Airbnb and she's set the bar pretty high. My Husband and I plan on coming back to Seattle on a yearly basis and we would definitely stay here again! Thanks for being a blessing to our trip in Seattle."
3861673,23870703,2014-12-13,4393791,Suzie,"Debbie was very thorough in communicating about directions, contact information and everything we needed. She was a wonderful host. We couldn't have asked for anyone nicer/accomodating.
For some reason, the directions stated put us off course a bit, but we did find our way easy enough. Thanks for the delicious scones!! Also your kindness in sending back my iPhone charger..sorry about that!"
3861673,23945497,2014-12-15,18360929,Megan,"Debbie was an amazing host! She was extremely approachable, welcoming, and friendly. Her warm muffins in the morning were delicious! The room was very clean, private, and comfortable. It had all the amenities that you would need and more. The small details such as the handwritten note and snacks were appreciated. I would highly recommend staying at Debbie's place!"
3861673,24103227,2014-12-20,13740672,Phil,The room was very nice and as advertised. Very quiet neighborhood. Easy access and no hassles at all. Close to downtown. Debbie greeted me and texted almost daily to see if everything was OK. Baked goods (Muffins) on arrival and cookies mid-week were a treat.
3861673,24263962,2014-12-24,22506883,Susan,"We absolutely loved staying at Debbie's Airbnb in Ballard. The unit was perfect for our needs. It's new, modern, very clean and cute. Not to mention, she provided the makings for fresh french press coffee, which went well with the incredible baked items that she left on our front doorstep two of the mornings we were there. Debbie was really great, friendly, helpful. She provided suggestions for places to eat and things to see. Ballard is a great Seattle neighborhood and her place was the perfect location to visit our relatives in Ballard and also take in other nearby neighborhoods, such as Fremont as well as downtown Seattle. We just can't say enough how much we enjoyed our experience. We'll stay there again if it's available the next time we're in town."
3861673,24365152,2014-12-27,6859886,Cynthia,"This place was great!  DELICIOUS baked goods in the mornings, awesome coffee, a super comfy bed and everything else we could have wanted.  Thanks Debbie!"
3861673,24564693,2014-12-30,13949814,Geung,"It was a perfect stay at Debbie's guest suite. It is located in a beautiful neighbourhood, and close to a lovely area to shop/dine/explore. Debbie was so accommodating, with many tips on how to enjoy our suite, as well as information on what to see during our stay in Ballard/Seattle. The suite itself is beautiful- very comfortable bed, great amenities, and a very functional space. The in-floor heating and the freshly baked morning scones were a treat. We look forward to staying here again!"
3861673,25027387,2015-01-05,9005673,Rhiannon,"We absolutely LOVED our stay at Debbie's. The room itself is just gorgeous! It is immaculate, cozy and very welcoming - you feel right at home immediately. 

We could not recommend staying at Debbie's more highly. She is such a lovely host who takes great care of her guests. The coffee, hot chocolate plus home baked goods, are the little extras that make you feel at home. 

The neighbourhood is fantastic. So quiet yet only a short walk away there is so much to discover including amazing restaurants/cafés, coffee (which we loved!) local breweries, boutiques and so much more. 

Debbie provided so many great hints on what to see in Seattle and the local neighbourhood of Ballard. We wish we could have stayed longer. It's hosts like Debbie that make the air bnb experience that much more enjoyable. We will be back! "
3861673,25170120,2015-01-08,15841889,Amber,"Debbie was such a kind and generous host. I can't imagine having a better BNB experience in Seattle.

Her home in Ballard is situated in a very nice, quiet neighborhood right across a small school - which made the area feel a lot safer. Her home is complete with everything you will need for a short stay: clean bedding, sets of towels, toiletries, mini fridge, kettle, coffee press, plates and bowls, utensils and more. We had privacy, felt extremely comfortable and right at home. The place was impeccably clean and tidy too!

Debbie baked the most delicious homemade scones I have ever had in my life, and her blueberry muffins are divine. We love Debbie and would definitely stay at her home again when we go back to Seattle."
3861673,25353880,2015-01-13,2229184,Chad And Kate,"*Disclaimer* - we didn't stay here, we rented the room for my sister who was in town visiting. However, we spent time in the room and met Debbie as well. The room was spotless, the bed very comfortable, the scones and other treats delicious and the radiant heat floors a nice touch. Debbie was kind and super easy to communicate with and even took extra care to make sure her dogs weren't around the yard when my sister was at the room (she's allergic). The neighborhood is adorable, safe, and close to some fantastic restaurants. We'll definitely be renting the room again for future visiting guests!"
3861673,25482266,2015-01-17,25835208,Erin,"There is so much goodness to Debbie.  In her cottage she has created an experience that you just don't get in a hotel: warm blueberry muffins delivered to your door, a floor that is warm to the foot makes the space even more cozy, a fridge with apples, juice, granola bars, and fresh cream, plus a bookcase of interesting books and magazines, a bathroom full of provisions, hand cream by the bedside, an umbrella and a flashlight. Debbie directed us to places of interest in Seattle and was such a kind person. Our stay at her place really  added to our Seattle experience. "
3861673,25542533,2015-01-19,240955,Anna,"We really liked staying in this room. It is just as described, and we really enjoyed the privacy and little added touches, like fresh tea and coffee with cream and scones in the refrigerator. Debbie welcomed us after we had arrived, and was very nice. The room is clean, the bed is comfy, and it is just the right amount of space for two people. The neighborhood is so beautiful, I wish we could have spent more time in Ballard!"
3861673,25644596,2015-01-21,2348225,Ryan,Really nice clean space with everything you need for a comfortable stay.  Debbie was an excellent host.
3861673,25719586,2015-01-24,11160724,Erick,"I am not sure if my trip was for business or a vacation !  Debbie's detached room in Ballard is more like your own private bungalow !!  It was spotless, well appointed and really comfortable.  The bed was fantastic, the towels were luxurious and the French press let me make my coffee just the way I like it.  The neighborhood was just as advertised...quiet, safe and plenty of parking.  Debbie's suggestions for local restaurants were outstanding.  Can't wait to visit again."
3861673,25874521,2015-01-28,24422156,Donna,"Debbie was the perfect hostess.  Her scones are awesome and the space was just perfect for us.  We were nearby our children/grandchildren and we were in a great neighborhood.  Debbie's recommendations about places for coffee, food, etc, were spot on and we really enjoyed walking to several places.  We will definitely recommend Debbie's air b&b to others traveling up this way and we hope to stay here again too."
3861673,26300157,2015-02-09,24952727,Cecilia,"We had a most pleasant stay at Debbie's guest suite located in a nice family neighborhood at the Ballard area. We particularly appreciated Debbie's warm welcome and her sunny personality. The room which is separate from the main house is very private and well appointed with many quality and thoughtful touches. It is rare to find a ""real"" hair dryer that will actually dry and style your hair in a hotel room but you will find one here :) along with big fluffy towels, shampoo/conditioner/liquid shower soap. The mini fridge was well stocked with apples, granola bars, juices and even cream for a relaxing cup of tea or coffee with a French press all provided. My husband and I both had a restful sleep on a very comfortable bed and woke up to some delicious home made scones. Thank you Debbie for making our first airbnb experience such a positive one. "
3861673,26420007,2015-02-12,25723289,Mariah,"Our stay with Debbie was wonderful! We felt right at home, almost as if we were staying with a relative. We arrived late on our first night and Debbie drove us down to 65th Ave so we could get some dinner and even offered to pick us up when we were done. When we got back she had left us cookies as well as muffins in the morning. Her place was so nice and clean we really enjoyed the Guest House. It is also in a great location since we wanted to see many breweries and visit Chuck's Hop Shop. We were able to walk to Ballard and Fremont easily, both places have great restaurants. I would definitely recommend staying at Debbie's place when you visit Seattle, it was also super easy to get to from downtown.  Debbie recommended The Dray to us which is a small tap house with excellent flat breads, we enjoyed it so much that we went back both nights while we were there. "
3861673,26465688,2015-02-13,4487798,Alex,Debbie was a sweetheart! I got lot trying to find the place and she was kind enough to help me locate the place over the phone. The cottage is tucked away in the backyard and the neighborhood is absolutely charming. Great place to go for a morning walk and take in all the beautiful craftsman era homes built in the early 1900's.  Would definitely recommend for that authentic Seattle experience with a private space to (website hidden) Debbie's Magdalena's are the type of dessert that you want to keep to yourself and not share (:
3861673,26531208,2015-02-15,59115,Meggan,"Best AirbnB stay ever. Ever.
Debbie was a perfect host- provided all pertinent info ahead of time, responded quickly to our questions and was willing to accommodate our schedule.
Once we arrived, we were blown away how clean, comfortable and private the guest was. Debbie thought of every detail- down to a lovely welcome note. 
We will definitely stay here any one we're in Seattle."
3861673,26691869,2015-02-17,6109462,Sandra,"Eric and I both loved Ballard! It was a great place to stay in Seattle. Debbie had great suggestions on things to do and where to eat. We stopped by Golden Gardens and ate pizza at Dulancey, both of which we would recommend. Debbie was a great communicator and we loved the muffins. Thank you again for having us! Hopefully we will be back in Seattle sooner than later."
3861673,26746955,2015-02-18,10687013,Dyan,"Debbie's place is amazing! It looks and feels just like the photos.

Next time I'm in Ballard, I will definetly be staying here! Thanks Debbie! "
3861673,26863738,2015-02-21,25477115,Brandon,"Debbie's guest house was the nicest room we've ever stayed in- airbnb, hotel, or otherwise. Absolutely recommended for anyone staying in the area. It's a quick drive to central Seattle, located in a beautiful neighborhood, and provided all the qualities of the ""ideal"" place to stay. Debbie provided a binder full of answers to every question we could've had and recommendations of places to go nearby. Coffee and snacks were included, along with the perfect balance of privacy and accessibility. Thank you so much for letting us stay in your fantastic home Debbie, couldn't have asked for a nicer visit anywhere. I would pay money to be able to give her 6 stars."

I notice the room looked much better in person than the pictures. She left notes for everything you could ever wonder. Sweet welcome notes. I loved that! She stocked the fridge with yummy goodies, the place was fresh clean and airy, color scheme perfect! Her homemade scones in the morning. Where to die for!!! It was nice not to have to leave the room for breakfast. The lace has great energy! I highly recommend it!!"
3861673,27485948,2015-03-05,3263848,Rufus,"Debbie is an awesome host and we had a wonderful experience at her place. As a fellow Airbnb host, I truly appreciated all of the little things that made it a great experience. "
3861673,27534888,2015-03-07,2992498,Kato,"Debbie's place was great. Could not have asked for a more welcoming host. Located really close to the hip Ballard strip where there are lots of great places to eat, drink and shop. If I'm back in Seattle I definitely would like to stay with Debbie :) "
3861673,27752170,2015-03-10,21385413,Tyler,"Our stay with Debbie was a very short one but it was certainly memorable. The room is located behind Debbie's beautiful Ballard home in a very nice back yard. The room was impeccable, the mattress was incredibly comfy and the bathroom was very clean. Debbie left out snacks and coffee, which we definitely enjoyed. We had to leave very early the next morning and unfortunately missed out on her famous scones. We will definitely stay with her again on our next visit to Seattle."
3861673,27831372,2015-03-13,13613570,Heidi,"Debbie made us feel welcome even prior to our arrival. She consistently communicated with us and provided suggestions before we even made it to Seattle. She welcomed us with a smile and freshly baked scones! Her place was perfectly situated for us to take some nice runs along the waterfront and through the neighborhood. The room was perfect. Overall, we had a lovely stay and would return. "
3861673,27993822,2015-03-16,25266215,Sarah,"Debbie's cozy retreat was lovely and so clean and fresh. 
All the amenities of a large hotel. 
Wifi, flat screen,  wonderful bed extra pillows and blankets , coffee with French press, goodies in frig. My first morning here I was served home made scones! 
Debbie also provides a binder full of info regarding local eateries. On my next visit to Seattle I am hoping Debbie's guest retreat will be available! Thank you Debbie!"
3861673,28100183,2015-03-17,28745720,Leslie,"It was an amazing experience! Matthew and I both loved the location. It was quite and relaxing, so many personal touches to the room. It felt like it was our own private apt! From personal note left for us and treats, to scones in the morning, and everything was as seen in the photos too! Easy access to downtown and meeting up with friends. We will stay here anytime it's open while in Seattle! So welcoming, it felt seeing friend! Having wifi and being able to work as needed also was great. I have not enough praise for the hospitality!"
3861673,28141688,2015-03-18,28766909,Madeline,"This was my first time using air bnb and what a wonderful first time experience! Debbie was awesome and very accommodating - even providing treats like scones, tea and oranges for us to enjoy! It was our first time in Seattle and made the trip so special. The bed was so comfortable, room was clean and even cable tv. "
3861673,28377286,2015-03-23,19209268,Ute,"Alles super. Wenn alle so wären wie Debbie, würden wir im Paradies leben."
3861673,28502304,2015-03-24,21467366,Venice,We found Debbie's room was extremely clean and everything was as it looks in the post.  It was in a great location and was a very comfortable stay.  We would definitely go back again.
3861673,28647906,2015-03-28,24941982,Armando,"We felt at home. Debbie is a great and friendly person. The room and bathroom  are very clean. This place is perfect for 2 people, and a kid would be fine. Safe and clean neighborhood.  Would definitely stay here again. "
3861673,28754386,2015-03-29,22332223,Keith S,"Very nice private room with all the necessary accommodations. Detailed instructions for everything - much appreciated. Great neighborhood, easy access to Seattle/Ballard."
3861673,29095480,2015-04-04,16961464,Lisa,"Debbie made me, my husband and 10 month-old son feel welcome as soon as we arrived. She baked us scones from scratch for our first morning there, suggested lots of ideas for places to visit and neighborhoods to explore, and was happy to answer any questions we had. The rental is in a lovely neighborhood that was a couple blocks away from the busier streets and was very quiet. We loved staying here and would gladly stay here again. The rental is small, very clean, and nicely decorated. It's the perfect space for one or two travelers, but also worked out great for us having our baby with us. "
3861673,29179668,2015-04-05,7001759,Rebecca,"This was a great location to our daughter, a very private room, clean and comfortable. We will definitely try to stay here again, Great coffee and scones in the morning. Debbie was friendly and communicated well. Thanks for a great experience. "
3861673,29492274,2015-04-08,6605784,Ralph And Linda,Everything was fantastic! We stayed two different times during the same week. We had an excellent experience! Our other review is a little more detailed! 
3861673,29562386,2015-04-09,2869619,Lindsay,Our stay at Debbie's was great! Exactly as described and spotless! She wasn't actually there while we were there but it was totally easy to get into the room and she was great with communicating. Ballard is a great neighborhood and we had fun! 
3861673,29648282,2015-04-10,30675587,Monica,"Loved our stay at Debbie's, it was our first time using Airbnb and my first time to Seattle. We wanted to stay somewhere close to UW and this was about 15-20 minutes away which worked great. The neighborhood was sweet, the room is a seperate little getaway behind the house sitting in the gorgeous backyard. We appreciated the clean, modern cute room and all the necessary amenities you need, including coffee & tea, and lots of other things. Wish we could of stayed longer than just one night and enjoy a meal in the backyard or seen more of the area, but had a tight schedule. Thank you for a great first experience!"
3861673,29735890,2015-04-12,6605784,Ralph And Linda,"Debbie greeted us personally and made sure that we had everything we needed. The description of the 'cottage' was very accurate. It is such a cute little place, so quiet and peaceful. The heated floors are fantastic! And the scones were an extra special treat! Even the little notes explaining how things work are perfect!~very clear and thorough!"
3861673,31426674,2015-05-05,8036700,Joni,"  The hosts description of the property was perfect.  Neighborhood beautiful and very quiet; room and equipment clean.  Debbie is very
friendly!  I had an exceptional stay!   "
3861673,31525523,2015-05-06,30169816,Ute,Very nice room & easy to reach with public transportation. Perfect for a (much too short) stopover.
3861673,31790945,2015-05-10,15172723,Jacen,"Can this be our home away from home? 

Our flight  later than expected, and Debbie was very flexible for us to arrive when we were ready. The private entrance was convenient and didn't make us feel like we were intruding. Debbie also sent us a well rounded instructions list, so there wasn't any guess work getting situated. 

The place is awesome, its a small converted room, but the bed was awesomely comfortable. There's a TV, plenty of lighting, fantastically smelling amenities in the bathroom, and a mini-fridge with snacks, and coffee. Seriously? This is the best of a BnB and a hotel room, she even has that little luggage holder in there.

In the morning, she greeted me and gave me a good tip on where to go on a morning run in the neighborhood, and she had handmade scones for us in the morning. No joke, these are better than I get in more breakfast joints. She was also very nice and we got a chat for a moment on our way out in the early afternoon. 

Our only issue? We didn't stay longer with her! If all our experiences were like staying with Debbie, I would be okay with never staying in a hotel for the rest of my life. "
3861673,31973246,2015-05-12,31254522,Helen,"Debbie is an amazing host! I stayed for one night with my partner and we felt very welcomed by her kind hospitality. The room is beautiful, clean, and extremely cozy - I would compare it to a very nice hotel stay. Debbie is very thoughtful and prepared a binder full of nice restaurant and sight-seeing suggestions and also baked us delicious scones for breakfast!
Her home is conveniently located in Ballard, Seattle and is close to downtown. I will definitely recommend anyone to stay here! "
3861673,32015478,2015-05-12,2014595,John,"Only a brief stay, but it is a great place. Just as advertised- private bedroom with bath, nicely appointed. Debbie is terrific. Very accommodating and helpful."
3861673,32238962,2015-05-16,14699287,Jaeyoung,"Debbie is very nice. And her house is comfortable. She is so kind to me. Thank you,Debbie~!"
3861673,32738398,2015-05-21,24297949,Deb,"Debbie was extremely welcoming and helpful throughout our stay.  

Ballard is a beautiful place to be in a beautiful city and there are lots of great places to eat within walking distance. 

The neighbourhood is very safe and very welcoming.

It is easy to access the rest of the city via public transport, though this was a problem for me for me because I had hurt my back."
3861673,32897090,2015-05-23,30647518,Sarah,"Debbie was a wonderful host! This was a fantastic first Airbnb experience for me. The room was lovely and very true to the photos and descriptions, but even more charming in person! Debbie's scones, coffee, suggestions on where to explore in Ballard, and overall hospitality was absolutely perfect. I'm sad I couldn't stay longer!"
3861673,33351501,2015-05-27,26321337,Kruthika,Debbie was awesome. The private detached room in her backyard is beautiful and very cozy. It is in a very cute neighborhood which made our stay in Seattle memorable . It is close to all amenities and downtown. 
3861673,33470320,2015-05-28,30060889,Malyssa,"Really beautiful location and guest house. It was so clean and smelled incredible. The bed is so comfortable and it was really peaceful. Debbie goes above and beyond to make the place comfortable. She leaves snacks, chocolates, tea, coffee. Debbie was easy to coordinate with. Appreciated how simple it was and the privacy. "
3861673,33553677,2015-05-29,18945450,Russ And Kathy,Deb greeted us warmly.  Her cottage was clean and very comfortable.  The neighborhood was quiet.  We will return!
3861673,34070916,2015-06-04,32203021,David,"This listing was everything we needed, and everything we didnt think we did. The bed is amazingly comfortable which made it easy for us to wind down and rest. Not to mention Debbies delicious morning scones and afternoon cookies! Stay here. You will only make great memories."
3861673,34535609,2015-06-09,7368231,Mellisa,Debbie is an amazing host. She is easy to communicate w and super sweet (even offer bake goods in the morning!) Her room is clean and provides absolute privacy. The bed is very comfy. I'll highly recommend it!
3861673,34673232,2015-06-10,859057,Mandana,"We had a fabulous stay at Debbie's cute garden house - the place is in a great location, clean, and very comfortable. Debbie had lots of little snacks for us in the house, and even brought us home-made scones in the morning, which were delicious. Highly recommend to stay at Debbie's if you are planing a Seattle trip!"
3861673,34714481,2015-06-11,1338990,Lisa,"Debbie did a great job of communicating -- emails, welcome letter, and greeting me at the door when I arrived. She also accommodated my request to have the room ready a little early. The room itself was perfect for my needs--and incredibly, impeccably clean. I had an amazing night of rest with the black out shades! Thank you Debbie! I would love to return on my next trip to Seattle."
3861673,34833421,2015-06-12,35317091,Anthony,"Everything was wonderful. Host, space and vibe were all awesome... The small things count and there were plenty, clean and inviting, well stocked and highly enjoyable place to spend the night. Thank you Debbie"
3861673,34853546,2015-06-13,178993,Jacque,It was a pleasure to deal with and meet Debbie.  The room was everything it was advertised to be and we felt very comfortable there.  We hope to have a longer stay in a future visit.
3861673,35060228,2015-06-15,2595513,Hayley,We had such a fabulous time in Seattle! Debbie was a fabulous host and the room is so much better than any hotel. Comfortable and has everything you could need! Such a great location (Ballard is fab!) and easy access to the city! Thank you for having us! 
3861673,35217077,2015-06-16,6756800,Lindsay,"We really enjoyed Debbie's place! It was very clean, current, and comfortable. The neighborhood was nice and quiet, with updated homes and mature growth trees. Debbie stocked the room with lots of wonderful extras for comfort, and delivered yummy fresh baked scones in the morning to enjoy with our coffee (excellent too!). Everything we needed was there. We appreciated her friendly, brief greeting! We've stayed other places where the host camps out to gab on the doorstep when you're tired and want to settle in. She made sure everything was ready and cooled the room for us prior to arrival. :-) We will be back!"
3861673,35394231,2015-06-18,711053,Velda,"This is a great, quiet neighborhood to have a rest after you're out running around Seattle like me! Perfect for one person or a couple, and being separated from the main house means you get a bit of privacy. The bed is so comfortable, and Debbie has thoughtfully provided everything that I thought I would need and more. Her scones were ridiculously good too. One of the best Airbnb places I've stayed at, and I would stay here again! "
3861673,35507426,2015-06-19,17135430,(email hidden),Debbie was so sweet! And her scones were delicious! The room was perfect. Private entrance with a bathroom and just enough space. There were little notes all around the room to let me know anything I should know. I will definitely be using her services again! 
3861673,35666212,2015-06-21,32512312,Gaëtan,"Debbie is a wonderful host. She was very reactive on emails/texts. We missed our flight and arrived at 4am, she was very comprehensive and reassuring. The room is just perfect and the private entrance very convenient. We parked easily in front of the house and reached Seattle downtown in 15min. We had a perfect stay."
3861673,35909088,2015-06-23,1799413,Laura,"Debbie's place is wonderful and she was a great host! The room is cozy, spacious, super clean and quiet and had everything we needed- including yummy homemade scones! Debbie was very accommodating, even providing us with an iron and ironing board so we wouldn't have to wear wrinkly clothes to a wedding. The neighborhood is really close to both Green Lake and Ballard and is easy to navigate around- especially if you have a car. Highly recommend. "
3861673,36205695,2015-06-26,7748213,Kit,"The room was exactly as it appeared in Airbnb. What a gem of a place in a nice neighborhood in North Ballard. Less than 5 minutes to the D bus stop that would get you to downtown Ballard or downtown Seattle. A great place from which to explore.

And Debbie was a great host. She was very welcoming, and she even made scones for me for breakfast! All in all, it was exactly as I hoped and a great trip to Seattle."
3861673,36649525,2015-06-30,6493172,Jan,We had an enjoyable stay at Debbie's place and everything was as Debbie described.  The treat on the first morning was very welcome.  The neighbourhood was quiet and public transport was close by.
3861673,36882575,2015-07-02,34367645,Scott,Debbie was wonderful. Very accommodating and helpful. The room was clean and made us feel at home. The weather was hot the week we traveled to Seattle so Debbie setup multiple fans to keep us cool. Highly recommend staying here as the room was perfect and location was great. Nothing but positives
3861673,37019822,2015-07-03,35606574,Ye,Debbie was a wonderful and friendly host. The room was comfortable and clean. We really appreciated the delicious scones she made for us.
3861673,37069062,2015-07-04,34586534,Jenna,"a stellar hostess! Debbie was very accomodating, and her welcome letter was very thorough, answering any questions we had before and during the stay. parking was ample and the studio was extremely clean. couldn't have asked for a better first experience with Airbnb! thanks a million!"
3861673,37469941,2015-07-07,31763739,Jie,Debbie is very nice and considerate. Delicious scones~ Thank you~!
3861673,37621290,2015-07-08,31303555,Delia,"We had a great time at Debbie's room. Great location, and the room was cozy and perfect for our stay. We  also loved the scones and the breakfast treats she provided. Her dogs were also very sweet. Thanks for a wonderful stay Debbie!"
3861673,37716698,2015-07-09,2598562,Clare,Debbie was a phenomenal host! She left detailed notes about the room and the area which made our stay very convenient. She had even installed a portable A/C because of the unseasonably hot weather. The room felt like a hotel and was completely separated from the house. It was also located just a couple blocks to a bus line downtown.
3861673,38467789,2015-07-15,38288699,Will,"It was awesome to have a Welcome Packet (with a chocolate) waiting for me when I checked in. I didn't get to meet Debbie but the room was very comfortable, bathroom was REALLY nice, and there was even oatmeal packets for the morning. The bed was very comfortable and the neighborhood is safe.

The only thing that was not superb was the A/C unit. It was very kind of Debbie to buy given the hot summer this year but it's loud and not very effective. But hey, it's better than nothing (even though it was too loud for light sleeper like me so I left it off). That being said, next time I come to Seattle to visit friends, I will DEFINITELY be asking Debbie if I can stay again."
3861673,38809956,2015-07-19,25777207,Karen,"Debbie was very helpful and friendly, and the room was very private and comfortable!"
3861673,39032428,2015-07-20,35566456,Debra,"The room was charming, clean and notes from the host were helpful.  The host was welcoming and made the experience easy and restful.  The bed is extremely comfortable.  The location is perfect as it is close to public transportation, and yet quiet and peaceful.  The touches provided by the host were thoughtful and made the room feel very welcoming.  I highly recommend this site.  "
3861673,39265578,2015-07-22,7386030,Diem And Michael,"We had a wonderful stay at Debbie’s guest bungalow! First off, my impression of Debbie began many months before arriving. I truly felt we chose the right host and home. She was always quick to respond and stay in communication with us, beginning at booking right through our stay, then through our departure.  

Debbie's home was our last stop on our PNW vacation and it was definitely the cherry on our vacation ""sundae"". We had been visiting family in Wenatchee and didn't leave their home as early as we hoped ~ then we stopped to take a hike in the mountains, which took longer than anticipated. That being said, I felt badly because we ended up arriving at Debbie's home a few hours later than anticipated. When I sent her a message to let her know, she was super easy going and still ensured we felt quite welcomed upon our arrival, despite not being home when we arrived. 

The private detached guest house is located in an adorably quaint, safe and hip neighborhood which is also a comfortable distance to Seattle and, of course, very near local and surrounding neighborhood restaurants and sights. Parking at her home was a breeze, which is hard to say about “the city”. 

The space itself was bright, modern, extremely efficient and impeccably clean…which made this neat-freak very happy. The bed was comfy and all the linens she provides are soft, smelled nice and high quality. 

Debbie has great taste in décor and we could see she also values quality and comfort. Everything you need is provided by her, from natural bathroom toiletries to wine glasses & wine opener. She even created a much appreciated, spot-on handbook of local restaurants and directions for your stay in her home! We were fortunate enough to be able to try several places on her lists and they did not disappoint. (We are a bit obsessed with The Walrus and The Carpenter now. Morsel and The Fat Hen are also a must!) 

Debbie also makes sure you have a nice cup of coffee or tea with some breakfast in your belly by providing breakfast items in the room to fix at your leisure, along with all the dishes and cups you need. One of our mornings, she baked amazing blueberry scones for us. Who knew scones could be so light and fluffy? I usually don’t eat breakfast pastries, and if I do, I only nibble a portion...but this one I devoured, much to my Hubby's shock and dismay! 

I can't say enough about how nice she is and her home is, but I'm running out of characters. I'll end with ~ it was lovely to be able to chat with her, while petting her cute doggies, the morning of our departure. We were very sad to leave but will be sure to see if we can stay with her again next time we visit. Thank you, Debbie, for an amazing experience!!!"
3861673,39612253,2015-07-25,9351575,Sam,"Oh my goodness...we cannot say enough nice things about our stay with Debbie. We arrived in the late afternoon and everything was ready and waiting for us. Everything from the shampoo to the coffee provided was top shelf. The bed was comfortable. The room was quiet and Debbie's neighborhood was charming. We ran to a Crossfit gym about 5 minutes away from the house and when we got back Debbie had freshly baked blueberry scones waiting for us. They were amazing. 

Her area of Ballard is a little bit out of the way from Seattle but easily accessible by bus or Uber. The D Line bus runs all the way up and down 15th street from basically Debbie's front door to the heart of Seattle. There are also lots of fun things to do in Ballard. The Brouwer's Cafe, a Belgian beer bar, was one of our favorite stops on our trip and was a about 7 minutes by bus or Uber. "
3861673,39733291,2015-07-26,13993988,Diane,"Debby's room is private, peaceful, beautifully designed and decorated with a very comfortable bed. We will definitely try to stay here again the next time we come to Ballard. Thank you Debby!"
3861673,40004236,2015-07-27,2560022,Missy,"This airbnb is in a lovely residential neighborhood in Ballard. Our host Debbie was great at communicating in the days leading up to our stay. The suite is exactly what it looks like and is the perfect spot for a couple or single traveler. Debbie has thought of everything to make your stay as comfortable as possible from shampoo, air con, luggage stands, and she graciously made us scones in the morning (which were too delicious). We will definitely stay here again!"
3861673,40075117,2015-07-28,27368209,Alexander,"Debbie was immediately a very warm and welcome hostess. She guided us around her property, answering a few questions and showing us the essentials we needed to come back and clean up from a long week of camping in the Pacific Northwest. Her guest house is immaculate and cozy, with lots of literature - including her own - on things to do and see around Ballard and Seattle.

Speaking of Ballard: It is a fantastic area, one that reminded us greatly of our home back in Minneapolis. Friendly people with many unique and tasty restaurants to sample. We are looking forward to a return trip in the future.

Thanks Debbie!"
3861673,40439159,2015-07-31,25139817,Megan,"
Deb, our host was very welcoming and met us in person. She checked to make sure we were settled and had all expectations clearly stated for food, cleaning, and arrival/departures. She also was of great assistance when we needed ice for a medical issue. We would highly recommend this airbnb site!"
3861673,41073976,2015-08-04,6605784,Ralph And Linda,"This stay was just as wonderful as the other two times we've stayed here. Debbie is a super hostess and the room is very quiet, comfortable and peaceful. "
3861673,41231587,2015-08-05,7595868,Julie,"Deb was an excellent, welcoming host! She made everything about our stay super easy. Room was great, especially French press coffee. Thank you! 

  "
3861673,41924264,2015-08-10,28679892,Jennifer,"Debbie was very welcoming. She left notes around the house that were good reminders for us, which is helpful when traveling can be a whirlwind. She had a great booklet of information on local tourist attractions, shops, restaurants, and things to see. The room was accurately described and quite private, which was perfect for my sister and I. We would definitely recommend staying at Debbie's if you are ever in the mood to visit Seattle or surrounding areas. Thanks, Debbie!!"
3861673,42259280,2015-08-12,6605784,Ralph And Linda,"This little cottage is consistently peaceful, relaxing, and comfortable. We've stayed here several times.  It's in a very quiet neighborhood that is convenient to public transportation.  Debbie is an excellent hostess!"
3861673,42654610,2015-08-15,27131268,Sandi,"I had a wonderful stay at the Air B&B, hosted by Debbie.  My place was cozy, clean & very comfortable.  My host, Debbie was very sweet and kind.  My husband celebrated a birthday, while at the B&B and she made homemade scones with a candle.  Very thoughtful.  The location was very convenient to both downtown Ballard and my son's home.  A great stay... Thank you for the great hospitality."
3861673,43214086,2015-08-18,23222389,Annie,"Cheerful, sweet place in a terrific location with easy parking and access- and a very friendly and accommodating hostess who clearly enjoys that role.  Concise for sure, but we like that kind of coziness.  Couldn't wish for anything more.  The privacy is such a bonus- my husband could play his ukulele first thing in the morning without worries of disturbing the household!  Like like like!!!    "
3861673,43395761,2015-08-19,21815345,Rachelle,"Debbie was very easy to communicate with and the description was very accurate. The neighborhood was a nice quite neighborhood and was just a quick drive to downtown Ballard (maybe 1.5 miles if you're walking). Debbie was in the backyard when we arrived and gave us a very welcoming greeting and even offered to make us fresh scones the next morning. The detached bedroom was private, had an a/c unit in it, full bathroom, TV, books, wi-fi, and even a handy book that Debbie made filled with nearby restaurants and things to do. 10/10 would stay here again. "
3861673,43497568,2015-08-20,406819,Melody,"Splendid little room and great value! This was perfect for our one-night stopover in Seattle. It was tastefully designed, immaculate, and stocked with high-quality essentials (such soft and plush towels!). Debbie was an extraordinary host, from baking fresh scones to accommodating our travel schedule."
3861673,44279276,2015-08-25,12431625,Amanda,"We enjoyed our stay at Debs place.

3861673,44884012,2015-08-30,11395288,Trish,"Debbie is lovely and very personable. Even though we didn't see much of each other. As my husband and I were out all day as night enjoying the wonderful city. 
The accommodation was wonderful too and had all that you would need.  Very clean and comfortable.  Debbie  added a few goodies to the fridge. Inc her yummy home made scones.  I would definitely return  and I wouldn't  hesitate to recommend Debbie's place to anyone else. 
"
3861673,45089274,2015-08-31,37064174,Minh Duy,Debbie was very organized and easy-going. She sent us email/text way in advance with all the information to keep us in the loops. The night we arrived she was out but sent us a text to let us know. Love the privacy of the detached room. Things were clean and neat. It was very simple yet very accommodating. The brochure she prepared was very detailed with recommendations from local eateries to things to see/do complete with hand-drawn directions. Debbie even offered to bake us some scones in the morning. We were very comfortable staying with Debbie and she was a nice host. I'd stay at Debbie's again when we visit Ballard/Seattle. 
3861673,45460642,2015-09-03,30987241,Mary,"My host Debbie made me feel very welcome and even had fresh scones at my doorstep the very first morning I awoke!  the bedroom and bath is very clean and comfortable.  I enjoyed the peacefulness as it is a very quiet neighborhood.  I asked her to provide de-caf coffee as there was none, and she agreed that she would.   I would definitely rent Debbie's little house again when in Seattle, close to bus stop and walk to breakfast café.
Thank you Debbie!    Mary"
3861673,45599519,2015-09-04,39868434,Catherine,Debbie was a great Host. Her cottage provides comfot and privacy. The location ideal because it is near the Sound with great views and restaurants. I would definitely recommend it!
3861673,45651259,2015-09-05,29542465,Merrill,"Debbie's place is exactly as described - it is a great little gust house in a wonderful neighborhood, very convenient to everything!  Deb was very communicative prior to our arrival and provided all the comforts of home during our stay!  This was our first Airbnb stay - after staying here, we may never use statndard hotels again!!"
3861673,46262853,2015-09-09,29542465,Merrill,"We stayed with Deb twice since we had a ""trip within a trip"" to a wedding outside of town.  Deb was gracious about our strange schedule and when we arrived for Our Stay, Part II - we received the royal treatment all over again!  The room is a perfect for a couple and is so convenient to all things Seattle - and if you need some suggestions, Deb provides a great book for fun local places to please all types of visitors.  And bonus for us - we got homemade scones for both of our stays!!  Truly above and beyond!  "
3861673,46440078,2015-09-10,38566502,Callie,"Our host, Debbie, did an excellent job of making us feel welcome, from answering all my questions quickly, to preparing warm, tasty scones the morning after our arrival! We felt like family the moment we met her! The room was clean and comfortable and we loved the area (Ballard) or this B & B. Lots of fun, local restaurants, pubs, and coffee houses within a short jaunt!"
3861673,47259190,2015-09-17,39282954,Erisa,"Debbie was wonderful and super accommodating!  When you talk to her, she makes you feel very welcomed.  Her house is absolutely gorgeous.   When we stayed with her, she definitely provided us with a homie feeling.  She also provides a lot of helpful tips and good places to eat and visit.  If I do go to Seattle again, I'll definitely try to stay at her place again.   "
3861673,47671933,2015-09-21,39197016,Noelle,Debbie was super nice and made us fresh scones for breakfast.
3861673,47712069,2015-09-21,40526341,Katie,Debbie was a great host! She contacted me very promptly while I was making arrangements and sent an email prior to arriving to give directions and general information regarding our stay. My boyfriend and I were visiting for my sister's wedding and were seeking a more private stay since we were going to be busy running around. The location was near the venue (golden gardens) and in a great area! Close to many restaurants and fun things to check out. We only saw Debbie a few times but she was very friendly each time :) we had the privacy and quiet we wanted and it felt like a small home away from home. She also let us come a bit earlier than stated since we needed to change and get ready before the rehearsal dinner and didn't put pressure for us to be out at exactly 11. Thank you so much Debbie! We had a great stay!
3861673,48136527,2015-09-23,19768664,Pauline,We spent a great night at Debbie's. Ballard is a very quiet and nice  district. Notice that you need to take the bus or your car to go downtown as it's a long way to go by foot. The room is lovely and we tasted delicious fresh scones in the  morning.  Debbie is really careful: she  gave us some very useful traffic information as Chinese President Xi was visiting Seattle. We recommend  her room for a trip in Seattle.
3861673,48175887,2015-09-24,38707531,Jon J.,"Perfect room, VERY CLEAN, great location in Ballard and easy parking. Debbie is a great host, her dogs are wonderful and we had a fantastic time. We stayed on two different days and the second day Debbie really helped us by allowing to check in a little earlier. Yes, it is a small room but enough space for luggage and clothing.
Debbie, thank you for making us welcome!"
3861673,48403600,2015-09-26,9944894,Mark,"Debbie was great: alert, accommodating and attentive without being intrusive. Her place was comfortable, quiet and private, with plenty of street parking out front. Instructions and directions were complete and fully comprehensible, and there were lots of nice little touches--including (but not limited to) the home-made muffins provided without fanfare. She even thoughtfully covered the bicycle I'd locked in the yard when it started to rain overnight. Sweet!

I'd caution that although comfortable and complete, the lodging might have fallen short if I'd intended to cook for myself or if I'd wanted to spend time outside. This was not a drawback for me, but might have been if I'd needed space to work or if I'd not been alone. This is not intended as a criticism, but rather as a caution to be realistic about what's included. Considering the price, location, and amenities this was definitely a good deal. I'll be back!"
3861673,48552255,2015-09-27,42164994,Erin,"Wow!  Our stay at Debbie's place was great!! She was the perfect hostess.  The neighborhood was super cute!  We walked to several bars & restaurants.  Her house was adorable!  The guest house looked exactly like it does in the pictures.  
Debbie was so nice and accommodating.  We thought we needed an early check-in so she made arrangements to make that happen for us.  She even had a list of ""To-Do's"" for both the area of Ballard & all of Seattle.

Thank you so much Debbie!  We would most definitely recommend your place to anybody looking for a great place to stay in Seattle!  Hopefully we'll be back soon!"
3861673,48879745,2015-09-29,1649232,Suzanne,We thoroughly enjoyed our 2 night stay.  Our private room exceeded our expectations-Debbie goes above & beyond making sure that every ammenity is available to you. Her homemade breakfast scones will seal the deal!  We were able to store our bikes in her garage & enjoyed the backyard patio area.  Her location is perfect if you want to visit Seattle Center-by car or public bus. We were able to enjoy the Ballard neighborhood too!  We will definitely stay here again if we come back to Seattle.
3861673,49341558,2015-10-03,2742285,Carolina,"i would definitely recommend this place! it is a nice, clean, private rental with a really cosy bed. it's located in a beautiful neighbourhood with walking distance to hip restaurants. nice and uncomplicated host! unfortunately we stayed there just for one night"
3861673,49592602,2015-10-05,21576074,Marcy,I loved my stay.  Nice and clean.  Quiet and beautiful neighbor.  Easy walk to the bus stop with multiple pieces of luggage.  Meet Debbie and she was so sweet and I would have to say she went out of her way to make sure I had everything I need.  Seriously delicious scones.  
3861673,50247445,2015-10-10,3787344,Amber,"Our stay at Debbie's private detached room was great! From the beginning of booking, Debbie was prompt in her replies and sent great detailed information about everything we could expect which only complimented the already detailed listing she has for her AirBnB. The neighborhood is quiet, but only a short walk to a charming street filled with great bars and restaurants. Downtown Ballard is a short drive or bus ride away. The room was very charming, clean and contained everything we needed for our mini-staycation. Debbie even left blueberry scones outside the door for us in the morning. I highly recommend her private room and Debbie, herself, as a great host."
3861673,50745987,2015-10-14,30564604,Angela,"Debbie greeted my husband and I when we arrived to her home. She was very friendly and kind. The room was great. Definitely fits only 2 people max. The room was clean, organized and comfortable. We were very pleased with our 4 night stay."
3861673,50953793,2015-10-16,19811869,Janice,We had a very good time staying at Debbie's place. It was our first time visiting Seattle and we found her local travel recommendations very informative and helpful. The room itself was very clean and fully equipped. Love the scones she made for us before we leave! 
3861673,51444696,2015-10-20,956913,Frederick,"Excellent experience.  Debbie was quite welcoming, the room was separate from the house and well furnished, equipped and provisioned, and the location was great----lots of coffee shops, restaurants, etc. nearby.  -----highly recommended!"
3861673,51876901,2015-10-24,43767810,Jessica,"As first time Airbnb users we were a bit apprehensive, but we could not have had a better, or more relaxed night at Debbie's. We truly lucked out. The room was beautiful and clean. Debbie was the perfect host, kind and helpful but respected our privacy. Anything you could ever need, she has ready at your fingertips. There are fantastic spots to eat within a mile. The cherry on top was definitely the yummy homemade scones! Couldn't have asked for a better host, we will be back!"
3861673,52016217,2015-10-25,47069535,Jay,"Very very nice accommodation.  New, well-appointed, private. Neighborhood seemed fine."
3861673,52679191,2015-11-01,39964388,Steve,"Our host made us feel very welcome. This is a detached accommodation that was completely private. It is very clean with everything we needed. This is a lovely neighborhood. This is close to public transportation and many destinations within walking distance. 
This was a great experience. We recommend this host and location."
3861673,52840720,2015-11-02,693453,Ariana,"Debbie's guest cottage was peaceful and relaxing - well appointed room, nice mattress, plenty of hot water for two back to back showers in the morning. Great location in the Ballard neighborhood, too!"
3861673,53096586,2015-11-04,684374,Kimberly,"Really great place!  Very well appointed, really liked the welcome book with dining suggestions.  Everything was clean and in very nice condition.  And I really loved the privacy. When I come up to Seattle again will definitely stay here!"
3861673,53154870,2015-11-05,39347937,Robert,"Everything was great about my stay. Very nice large and comfortable private detached accommodations. Really appreciated Debbie's touches with everything one could need. Liked the neighborhood and quick access to downtown Seattle. Debbie's instructions plus house rules are excellent. Lots of care has gone into her BnB.
I've stayed in several places within this price range but this was the best."
3861673,53228335,2015-11-06,1111549,Bobbi,I absolutely loved this place! It was so clean and cozy and exactly like the pictures. The house is very nice and modern. When I got in there was snacks and a few drinks in the mini fridge and a hot tea kettle top of fridge. I will definitely stay here again because it was private and quiet and just overall very pleasant. 
3861673,53461415,2015-11-09,42641977,Jackson & Trish,"What a lovely room, and a wonderful host! Debbie made our first Air BnB experience a great one. The room was spacious and well furnished with a great selection of hot teas, coffee and a few other snacks. The location in Ballard is awesome and within walking distance to several local eateries and coffee shops, and only a few blocks from the bus stop that goes downtown Seattle.   Debbie has put together a wonderful travel guide of the area and local restaurant and hot spots. I can't say enough how pleased we were with our choice to stay at Debbies. From the first communication to the time we left she made us feel welcome and like family."
3861673,53799085,2015-11-12,3263848,Rufus,"Debbie is a great host. I have visited twice and will return. The place is clean, quiet and comfortable. I love the location."
3861673,53829889,2015-11-13,9423732,Angie,"Debbie met us upon arrival and was warm and welcoming. She made us feel comfortable to be staying at her place. The neighbourhood was very easy to find, directions were very accurate and close to Ballard, what a great neighbourhood. The detached place was exactly what was listed. It was very clean, the bed was extremely comfortable and all the little extras made us feel right at home. Would definitely stay there again ! thanks Debbie."
3861673,53961588,2015-11-15,6404977,Vianne,"The place was very cozy and in a quiet neighbourhood.  There as a comfy bed, clean bathroom with showering necessities provided, a walk-in closet for extra storage and some extras to make us feel at home (tea, coffee, homemade scones, juice, instant oatmeal, magazines and books, tv). We would definitely come back again the next time we're in Seattle.  "
3861673,54097045,2015-11-16,42260425,Tiemo,"Debbie is a great host, she bakes delicious muffins. The room is in a quiet neighborhood and is well maintained. Overall a very pleasurable first night in Seattle."
3861673,54337016,2015-11-18,47593199,Kevin,"This was our first time using AirBnB.  We had a great experience! Debbie's place was just as described; very clean, quiet and filled with lots of extras that made our stay more enjoyable. She really pays attention to the details. The homemade muffins were greatly appreciated. We're afraid she may have spoiled us for future rentals. Thank you Debbie!"
3861673,54714621,2015-11-23,45290633,Megan,Debbie was great. We had a great time staying here for a wedding that we were going to in Seattle. It was nice to have a private entrance and Debbie was respectful of our privacy. She was so great when we had a few different situation that come up that were less than ideal. She was accommodating and kind. The scones that she made were delicious as well. It was a great stay and I would stay here again. It was a little out of the way of where we had to go for the wedding but it was worth it. 
3861673,54822367,2015-11-23,21646165,Paul,Great space and experience. The room is very cozy and private. Hope to stay with Debbie again.
3861673,54962703,2015-11-25,48299797,Kevin,This visit was great. Debbie is wonderful. So kind and courteous. My wife and I felt very safe and comfortable with her. The room was more than we needed or even imagined. All the extra hospitalities were great! Definitely recommended!!
3861673,55119620,2015-11-28,47059171,Maggie,"The guest room is very cozy and private！Debbie is super nice and thoughtful, and she provides some pumpkin breads for the first morning. Hope to stay with Debbie again!"
3861673,55370235,2015-12-01,5107716,Chelsea,"We had a great time during our stay! The detached garage room felt like we were in nice hotel- and the heated floors were an added bonus. 
Debbie brought us delicious scones the second morning, and waking up to see dogs in the back yard made it feel more like home. It was a great neighborhood, with a lovely little spot called the Fat Hen, where we discovered our new favorite coffee drink- a cortado. "
3861673,55581082,2015-12-02,707599,Shella,"Debbie is awesome! She went out of her way to help us celebrate my partner's birthday, she made us some homemade scones and gave us a candle to boot! For me this kind of service is rare nowadays, so to have a host that's this thoughtful is a breath of fresh air. The detached bedroom space is great, we were free to move in and out without disturbing our host. It was also so easy to catch the D train going to the city so we saw a lot of what Seattle has to offer without having to drive and pay $$$$ in parking fees. I will definitely recommend Debbie and would stay with her again. Thank you Debbie! "
3861673,55680587,2015-12-04,11205482,Kristin,"Perfect, quiet and private space that feels like an oasis in the city.  Debbie's space is warmly welcoming, easily accessible, and comfortable.  Thank you!"
3861673,55828759,2015-12-06,5266075,Swanny,"We were planning a week-end in Seattle, but wanted to avoid the busy downtown. We found this perfect spot in Ballard, which was an great opportunity to discover a very friendly neighborhood with plenty of shops, restaurants and bars. The place was very cozy, clean, quiet and warm. We haven't had the chance to meet Debbie but she provides very great advice on where to go and what to see.  We definitely recommend this place."
3861673,55896038,2015-12-07,42372432,Carol,"I very much enjoyed staying at Deb's place. I was very impressed with the care she took to make sure I felt welcome. She had many little touches that made me feel at home, such as the French press, the items in the mini-fridge and the wonderful products in the bathroom. I liked the inclusion of a ""manual"" which answered all my questions.

The room is lovely, warm, and tastefully appointed. The bed is very comfortable, and that’s saying a lot for me because I always have pain in my back. I loved the comforter, sheets and pillows. It was like a four-star hotel. My night’s sleep was great."
3861673,56134239,2015-12-09,48375512,Karen,Fresh homemade bread in frig and mints on bedside table with a small note saying 'welcome'.

3861673,56665416,2015-12-16,113727,Jeremy,"Debbie greeted us when we arrived. She was friendly and inviting. The suite was even more cozy than expected -- would stay again! It was a short drive to downtown Ballard, which is highly recommended.

Scones were delicious and unexpectedly served as our only breakfast as we rushed to the airport -- what a life saver! Great set up and quiet 'hood. Thanks!"
3861673,56935057,2015-12-20,25253507,John,"We thoroughly enjoyed our experience in Ballard.  Debbie's very quiet detached unit was an oasis for us after a long haul from Shanghai.  She met us and made us feel welcome immediately and was in contact with us on an as-needed basis before and during our stay.  The room was clean as a whistle and the radiant heat in the floor was a real bonus.  We both felt the bed was one of best we'd ever had! Good coffee, oatmeal packs and scones put the finishing touches on our lovely stay.  Yep, we'd love to re-book. The listings of neighborhood sights, restaurants, etc was well organized and most helpful.  The Brunswick & Hunt Restaurant a couple of blocks away was superb!  Well done, Debbie."
3861673,57029478,2015-12-21,36482067,Meagan,"Debbie was a wonderful host, she left instructions and a very detailed suggestion list that proved to be very helpful. She made our stay very comfortable and even left us homemade scones! I'm a sucker for baked goods and they were fantastic! We had a great stay!"
3861673,57434664,2015-12-26,30878500,David,"My son and grandson stayed at Debbie's place. I never met her, but my son met her only briefly and said they had a pleasant conversation. My son was very happy with the room, especially the location, which was very quiet and only a few minutes away from where we were staying."

3861673,57977542,2015-12-30,806550,Lesley,"Debbie's bnb is ""the best"" just because of Debbie herself. She knows what it takes to make a house a home....even for a visitor.   Careful planning has created a welcoming little oasis independent living suite in her backyard garden. The details of her thouggtfulness are msny, many, many!!! The essentials....a very private, safe, warm, quiet place to rest. It is definitely not an extra bedroom in a basement sort of space. The entire place was absolutely spotlessly clean.  The bed is VERY comfortable and we'll made. Beyond the essentials. I very much enjoyed her efforts to add many touches of hospitality and.....as a single example.... I enjoyed her offer of a yummy blueberry scone in the morning  with a pot of green tea. As I  sat reading a couple ""Seattle"" magazines from her book shelf, I reminisced about my former life in Seattle and thought about how nice her comfy chair and good reading lamp would allow a Seattle ""Tourist visitor"" to get a sense of the town and relax. The little fridge provided a proper storage place for a few meal items. She even provided a mini eating area. 

The location is ideal for bus travelers, as the main bus for this part of town is only a block away. For people with a vehicle  there is very adequate parking. The shopping and night life of new Ballard is 5 minutes away, the natural environment Golden Gardens 10 minutes, as are the fish ladder, fisherman's terminal and Shilshole Marina and the most interesting Hiram Crittenden Locks.

Debbie always communicates efficiently and in a very timely manner. Her book of house info is helpful. She is not a lady who leaves things  to chance.... thoughtful, intelligent, commited. It shows!!"
3861673,58028796,2015-12-31,42530578,Sunny,Debbie is Super nice and she prepared everything you need with a high quality! The room is warm and very clean. Cute dogs!

He made us feel right at home in his beautiful condo and the view from our bedroom was absolutely spectacles. We were lucky to be able to meet him sometime. He shared his stories with us and make sure we were confirmable staying at his place. The location was great and we could just catch bus in front of his apartment to the downtown Seattle which makes it very convenient and safe late back. There were quite many restaurants nearby, so it was easy for us to grab some food on the way back.We highly recommend Kevin place for anyone, perfect for visitors and first timers in Seattle! Kevin will ensure you have a great and comfortable stay!!! "

975179,4866674,2013-05-29,6362689,Hajo,"Katie was a great host, made coffee in the morning, gave recommendations for city sightseeing, everything was perfect. The area is absolutely quiet and very nice and reaching downtown via the nearby bus station was very easy. Thank you very much!"
975179,4972844,2013-06-04,6475393,Yvette,"I five days at Katie's place and would highly recommend it to anyone visiting Seattle. The room is clean and warm and Katie definitely makes you feel at home. She was very helpful in suggesting sights to see in the city and great local cafes. Her home is located on a quiet street within walking distance of the trendy Ballard shops area, which also has a great farmers market on the weekend. The waterfront marina area is also close. Enjoy! "
975179,4990891,2013-06-05,3372246,Jana,"Katie was a great host, and the place was just what I was looking for. I had an interview the following day and just needed to be well rested. It was clean and quiet and Katie even broke out the iron and ironing board for me! She also has a very affectionate, very sweet kitty that kept me company:) A great experience, I would recommend Katie's place highly!"
975179,5094523,2013-06-11,1632435,Neon,We had a great stay with Katie. We were in town for some meetings and only stayed one night but Katie was very friendly and helpful. The apartment was very clean and the bedroom was beautiful. We had no problems at all during our stay.
975179,5116485,2013-06-13,5392489,Deyong,Nice place. Comfy and cozy. Katie and Lexi the cat are really friendly. A bit out of the way but public transit takes you right to the city.

Katie is a wonderful host, she gave us some tips on sights to visit downtown and helped us plan the next step of road trip. Her place is very inviting in a quiet neighborhood, which is also very convenient to the city center. Would definitely stay here again and recommend to anyone visiting Seattle - adorable cat Lexi made our stay even more enjoyable "
975179,5422050,2013-06-29,6888620,Lizzie,"We had the most fantastic time with Katie, this was our first Air B n B experience and couldn't have been better.  Her place is great, the room so comfortable and clean and she was a wonderful host - very down to earth and friendly.  Couldn't recommend it more highly.  Oh and Lexi the cat is a gem."

975179,5692532,2013-07-12,6023164,Young,"Katie's house is so lovely! Gorgeous bathroom, a great light room and super comfy bed. We stayed for an entire week and loved the neighbourhood - the street is super quiet, the houses are really pretty and Ballard is amazing. The bus is easy to get to if you don't have a car, too. And Katie was amazing, so welcoming and flexible, great to talk to and she even drove us downtown when we had to get to the airport. Couldn't recommend staying here more! We miss you and Lexie!"

She shared great ideas about ways to spend our evening while in Seattle and we felt right at home. Her sweet kitty Lexi was a fun bonus! We would definitely stay with Katie again :)"
975179,5743675,2013-07-14,7366232,Christopher,Katie is a great host and easy to communicate with via phone or email. The bedroom was clean and well kept with the bathroom just steps away. Staying with Katie was a wonderful experience.
975179,5825125,2013-07-18,6336448,Diane,"It is amazing that someone can open their home to a stranger and by the end of a stay, become good friends.  I loved my stay with Katie!  Her home is so charming as well as the lovely yard that I spend much time in.  I was visiting my daughter who recently moved to Seattle and had also stayed with Katie while looking for a place to live.  My daughter highly recommended that I stay at Katie's for part of my trip and she was right!  While my daughter was at work as a chef in a local restaurant, Katie and I went to dinner twice to visit her.
I would absolutely stay with Katie again and would HIGHLY recommend her place.  She is a native and is so knowledgeable about the area- I learned a lot from her.
 "
975179,5898068,2013-07-21,7408756,Jeff And Lola,"We stayed at Katie's home one night only, but our experience was extremely positive:  Katie is very friendly, welcoming, accomodating, and easy going.  We really felt welcomed to her place.  She also provided us with info on public transportation, and even gave us a ride to the bus stop!  The room, bathroom and all common spaces were very bright, clean and tidy.  Finally, Lexi the cat was an added plus to us."
975179,5919826,2013-07-22,7029151,Megan,"We had a very short but nice stay with Katie. She was extremely accommodating, even let us use her ironing board and gave us lots of suggestions about what to do around town. It was a little hard to get our bags up and down the stairs (the yard is kind of steep) and the bathroom is shared, but the room was clean and we really appreciated the hospitality!"
975179,6194565,2013-08-03,6843566,Margaret,"Where to begin! This was my first time using something like airbnb and it was way beyond my expectations. That of course was due to Katie Logan! Not only was the room charming, clean and spacious(there were two of us), but the hostess thought of the little things- amenities like plush towels, an iron and ironing board, brochures and maps, even an umbrella- it is Seattle after all, though we had great weather. In the bathroom there was a tiny vase with fresh lavender; out back a lovely outdoor seating area. Katie herself is a life long resident of Seattle and had a wealth of knowledge for visitors. 
And then there's the inimitable Lexi the cat! Friendly and welcoming as her mistress. 
In all I would highly recommend Katie Logan's home as a choice find. You won't be disappointed!"
975179,6371106,2013-08-10,1812156,Erica,"Great place to stay in Ballard.  Katie's place is very clean, bright, and airy and the guest room is very spacious. Parking right in front of her house was easy and the neighborhood was very quiet at night even though it was pretty close to the nightlife of downtown Ballard. Katie and Lexi the cat were both very friendly and welcoming and made it easy for me to feel at home during my stay. Highly recommended."
975179,6484968,2013-08-14,2126002,Antoine,"Katie was a wonderful host and we had an unforgettable time at her place!! She contacted us ahead of time to arrange for our arrival, had left the keys somewhere we could easily find them (as she was not home when we arrived) and was very thoughtful throughout. Her place is really cosy and spotless clean. The wifi connection is good. The very nice weather allowed for a couple of lovely breakfasts in the backyard. Ballard is an awesome neighborhood with plenty to do. Bus #40 is nearby and takes you to downtown Seattle in 20-30 minutes. Oh, and Katie even gave us a ride to downtown Ballard so that we could pick up out rental bikes. All in all, a five star experience! We would have stayed much longer if we could have. Can't wait to be back!"
975179,6562758,2013-08-17,7486069,Julie,"Katie was a wonderful host! It was my first time using Airbnb and she provided comprehensive directions to her house in Ballard. On the first night we arrived later than anticipated, so she drove us to an excellent local restaurant for dinner. Katie's home is very clean with all the amenities one could possibly need and a very welcoming cat, Lexi. Even on cloudy or rainy days, the house and room felt bright with its large windows. The house is not far from downtown Ballard, which is a very charming neighbourhood in itself! Many restaurants and cafes which stay open late available, specialty shops, and music venues. The neighbourhood felt very safe overall and all the Seattleites we met have been beyond helpful and friendly.

975179,6911733,2013-08-30,5245939,Claire,"I went to Seattle for a chilled out, restorative vacation and that's what I got, thanks in part to Katie, who was a wonderful host. She was welcoming, easy to talk to, helpful but also respectful of personal space. Her home was a quiet, bright retreat in a neighborhood that I loved. If you're looking for the perfect Seattle retreat, look no further. Thanks, Katie!"
975179,7165133,2013-09-09,7922972,Augustin,"The room was very confortable and cosy. She has a nice cat, and Katie was very helpfull to tell us the good spots of the city ! Perfect and quiet neightboorhood. On conseille cet endroit à tous les français qui veulent venir visiter Seattle!"

975179,7540719,2013-09-23,8811405,Katy,"I had a wonderful stay at Katie's house! visiting Seattle for work and couldn't have asked for better accommodations. Katie's house had all the necessary amenities of a hotel but with the comfortable feel of being home. Katie graciously shared Wi-Fi, her iron and ironing board and encouraged me to help myself to coffee and bananas. Ballard is a great place to stay with amazing restaurants, boutique stores, the beach and the locks. I'd highly recommend checking out Fred Meyer if you need any groceries! Amazing.  Thanks Katie and Lexi for a great stay. I can't wait to get back to beautiful Seattle and stay with you again. "

975179,9629537,2014-01-03,7579346,David,"Katie was an amazing host! Her accommodations were tasteful, clean and inviting, and she went above and beyond to make us feel welcome.  

We needed a place to stay on very short notice, and she replied to our inquiry immediately, making the process as smooth as could be.  

Her knowledge of the local area also made it very easy to find places to eat and things to do.  

And her cat, Lexi, adopted us as honorary members of the family, making us feel right at home,  She seriously is the best cat in the world!

This was our first experience renting a room-only in an air b&b while the owner was home, and Katie put us right at ease! She was outgoing, fun, gracious, generous, and very conscientious! She even offered to give us a ride to the airport when we left (which we accepted). While we didn't see each other a lot during our stay, by the end of our stay we felt like we had made a new friend with Katie!

We couldn't recommend Katie more highly, if you have the chance to stay here you are in for a real treat."
975179,9806413,2014-01-11,103504,Sharon,"Thanks Katie.

975179,10306294,2014-02-11,4291660,Clau,"Katie was a very nice host, she let us book at the last minute. She also allowed and extra person to sleep on the couch. The communication with her was fast and easy. She is very courteous, and easy going. Access to downtown Seattle is really easy if you have a car, it was only a10 minutes drive.  I totally recommend her place to any one to looking for a quiet place to sleep.
Thanks a lot Katie"

975179,11207667,2014-03-24,13302829,David Cameron,"What a gem in every experience of my three day/two night vacation. I should preface that this was my first AirBnB experience that my friend and I have ever had, and the reviews for Katie/Lexi were completely accurate. Katie was firstly very concise with communication, disarming a key exchange to her guest room. She's not only a native Seattlite, but is a world-travelled, gregarious, and engaging human being. Her bucolic home was perfectly positioned for an early morning run to Golden Gardens park, and was short bike-able proximity to historic Ballard (10> minutes on bicycle, 20+ minutes on foot). Adorable bathroom adjacent to the guest room a great plus. Did we mention Lexi, the internet sensation cat that also inhabits the house? Katie is lucky we didn't steal her back to Portland! Adorable. Pssst, renters tip; ask to see Lexi dawn her cape. "
975179,11274884,2014-03-27,6907605,Lindsay,Katie was really welcoming and easy going. I was here for work so it was a peaceful and quiet place for me to get some much needed rest. Her place is cute and very clean and the bed was super comfy. Her cat is pretty adorable too. Definitely recommended! 
975179,11774018,2014-04-14,13903941,Deena,"My stay at Katie's private room in sunny Ballard was my first experience with AirBnb and I would highly recommend it. Katie was very organized, accommodating, hospitable and made me feel at home.  I was participating in a pretty intensive professional and personal development course and she was very respectful of my space and provided a happy environment for me to chill.  Ballard is a really cute neighborhood in Seattle that I hadn't spent much time in and it has become my new favorite!!"
975179,12453353,2014-05-03,1346334,Mette,"We stayed at Katie for 2 weeks.
Katie is a great host. She is helpful and friendly. Made fresh coffee every morning.
The room was exactly as pictured- tidy and clean. The bathroom next to our room is a great plus.
A short walk to historic Ballard- 20 min - with beautiful shops and restaurants.

Thanks to Katie, we honestly recommend ""Private room in sunny Ballard "". "

My boyfriend is a very picky (annoying!) sleeper and Katie was kind enough to provide a fan for him to use at night as a white noise machine. 
Also her cat Lexi is a sweetie! This was my first AirBnB experience and I'm so glad we chose Katie's place to stay! "

975179,15713721,2014-07-14,1647596,Joel,We had a lovely stay at Katie's house in charming Ballard. She made it very easy for us to come and enjoy our day in Seattle. The room and the house are really tastefully decorated and comfortable. Her house isn't so close to coffee shops and restaurants (maybe 10-15 min walk to the nearest one) but the neighborhood is very easy to navigate. Katie had lots of insight and suggestions about Seattle that was very helpful!
975179,15969636,2014-07-19,3292340,Leslie,Katie's house was spotless. She was very friendly and helpful about local activities and directions. We were a little surprised that Katie did not offer breakfast. We did have coffee and were able to watch TV.
975179,16314654,2014-07-25,17795837,Kye,"Katie Logan was an absolutely wonderful host and her home and the room were charming and beautiful.  This was our first time using Airbnb, and we are so grateful to have had such a great experience.  Katie really made us feel at home and the room was very comfortable with everything that we needed.  The bathroom was very nice and we could use the kitchen to cook.  We loved the neighborhood and had a great time walking around Ballard.  It was easy to walk to the lovely downtown and Katie was extremely helpful in giving tips about the area.  I am moving to Seattle and Katie was very kind about giving me information on housing and living in Seattle.  She was so pleasant and easy to talk to and she was a very fun and gracious host.  She has the sweetest, most adorable kitty named Lexi, who made the experience even more wonderful!  It was freezing cold in Seattle and raining during our stay, and it was so lovely to come back to Katie's lovely, cozy house and be greeted by a sweet, affectionate kitty who always wanted to cuddle and keep us company.  It was little things like this that made staying at Katie's much more personal and welcoming than staying in a hotel.  We highly recommend Katie's room in Ballard and thank her for a fantastic stay in Seattle!"

975179,17078305,2014-08-06,1646461,Nancy,I had a terrific stay with Katie in the Ballard area. The location is ideal for exploring the Seattle area plus taking various daytrips. Katie's home was clean with a very comfortable bed and fabulous backyard area for relaxing. Katie was very knowledgeable about the area and had lots of tips on things to see and areas to visit. I enjoyed my stay and hope to stay again soon when I am in the area.
975179,17245441,2014-08-09,5205779,Clément,"We needed a place to accommodate us late (and last minute...) and Katie was the perfect host.

975179,17373703,2014-08-11,11948834,Fergus,Katie was very responsive and made accessing her home easy. Lexi the cat served as the designated greeter. We never actually connected in  person but we felt we had a very positive stay at Katie's. The location is nice and handy & we followed her suggestion of checking out a viewpoint that was wonderful.
975179,17491069,2014-08-12,38157,Annie,"Katie is fantastic and the room is exactly as advertised, clean and comfortable. We stayed only one night, but put poor Katie through the paces.  First, we weren't sure of our arrival time, which kept getting pushed later and later in to the evening until our final arrival was after her bedtime. She was super laid back about it and gave me easy directions for how to get in the house and find our room.  The next morning, I needed an iron/iron board and she took my call while at work and gave me access to a private part of the house so that I could iron a shirt. Finally, a couple hours after checking out, I realized that I had left my groceries in the refrigerator. Even though her schedule was tight and she had other guests who had already checked in, Katie went out of her way to put our food in a cooler and leave it out for us to pick up. The cherry on top is her fantastic cat. All in all, it was a short, but great stay for us. Thank you, Katie!"
975179,17519489,2014-08-13,14367370,Agnes,"Katie is a very nice and kind woman, she was a great host! her cat is very cute and nice too. We liked very much the style and decoration of the house. The bed was comfortable and the neighborhood very quiet at night. In the morning, there was more noise because of works in a close street. The only inconvenience was the fact that the shared bathroom is next to the guest room. The neighborhood is pretty, and we think that the cost of the night was cheap for what it was, compared to all we saw on internet."

975179,17819047,2014-08-18,14246213,Mierka,"Katie was so friendly and welcoming. We didn't see her very much as we were in town for a wedding and we were out and about for most of our stay but it was so lovely to have a clean, well kept place to stay during the night in such a pleasant location. 

The bedroom was well lit and was just the right size for a couple.

Katie made sure to keep in contact with us throughout the stay to let us know when she would be out of the house early or coming back late. 

All in all it was a great experience and we are very happy to have stayed."
975179,18251272,2014-08-24,16135581,Marlee,"Katie was a great and friendly host! She always had a recommendation to give us about where we were going, she is very knowledgeable about things to do around Seattle! Her house is a little far from downtown Seattle, but Ballard is a way better area to explore! So fun and funky, lots of amazing restaurants and sights. And if you want to get downtown, the bus stop is only 2 blocks away with one bus (the number 40) that goes right to Pike Place. Make sure you like cats if you stay - Lexie is a super friendly and cuddly kitty!"
975179,18502267,2014-08-27,20045562,Diana,Katie is a very welcoming host and very helpful.  She offered her air mattress pump as we did not have one and was very accommodating in allowing my daughter to sleep on the air mattress on the floor.  Even though the bathroom is shared and next to the guest room we heard little noise.  Her house is very light and bright and was a very pleasant place to stay.
975179,18622659,2014-08-29,18121370,Arthur,"Awesome place. Katie did a great job collecting materials on Seattle and Ballard so it was easy to find places to go. The place is a bit of a walk to downtown Ballard, but it's near a bus stop that goes to both downtown Seattle and downtown Ballard so it was not a problem at all. The room was nice, the bed was comfy, and the cat was a great ambassador for the house."

The room is simple and clean with easy access to the shared bathroom. It was just a 15 min walk to the main strips in Ballard, and the neighborhood was cute and homey. We also really enjoyed cuddling with Katie's super friendly cat Lexi! It was also very convenient to use the laundry in the house."

975179,19312347,2014-09-10,15871825,Queenie,Katie's father passed away on the first night of my arrival so her unavailability was understandable. She still made the effort to talk with me from time to time to make sure everything was ok. I didn't feel lonely though as her cat Lexi kept me very well-accompanied. I like very much that the house was quiet most of the time. Katie was upfront with the problem of ants in her kitchen and took active steps to fix it. The bed was very comfortable. The room was clean and well-kept. I would stay there again.
975179,20394360,2014-09-28,21648559,Victoria,"Absolutely delightful! Charming, sophisticated vintage home. High quality bedding, towels. Perfectly clean and organized home.

The shower was really nice and the room was perfectly pleasant.
She was very friendly and even drove us to the car rental place in the morning, which was a huge help for us. 
Overall it was a really nice stay. "

975179,24677775,2015-01-01,24916537,Htet,Katie and the cat are such great hosts that we feel like home right away as we get there. Katie's so sweet that she provided us with fresh towels and delicious chocolate treats and snacks. It was also nice to have scented candles in our bedroom. She also gave us orca cards that we can refill for public transportation. We had such a great Christmas getaway thanks to Kaite.   
975179,25001332,2015-01-04,15785957,Bhagyam,"My husband and I needed last minute accommodations in Seattle, and Katie came to the rescue. Clean and comfortable bed n shared bathroom. Thanks to Katie for making us feel at home. Was a bit chilly at night, but she clarified that the heater was acting funny. I fell in love with Lexie, the cat. Very well behaved, beautiful n adorable."
975179,25639137,2015-01-21,24897720,Julia,"Katie was a fabulous and very welcoming host.  She lives in a very nice, safe, and quiet neighborhood that is a quick walk to Sunset Hill Park which is a great place watch the sunset over Puget Sound.  Her house is very clean, fresh and gets a lot of sunlight.

The bedroom has a good mirror and closet, an extremely comfortable bed with a down comforter and plenty of good lighting.  The bathroom is also very clean and the shower/tub is very spacious. It also has a great mirror that bends to allow you to check your hair/makeup from any angle (even the back of your head!). 

Katie was kind enough to clear off a shelf for me in the bathroom as she knew I would be staying for over a week.  She also provided a few snacks, soaps, shampoo/conditioners, and water bottles in the bedroom. 

I arrived in Seattle when Katie was out of the house and she gave me clear directions over the phone for how to get into the house.  She was always available via text if I had any questions.   When I had to extend my stay in Ballard for a few days, I was very appreciative when Katie immediately approved my request.  I was also delighted by the tips she gave me about Seattle's grunge scene and the names of shops where some of the musicians are known to hang out. 

 Her kitty Lexi was a very delightful and talkative companion!  The house and host were amazing and I would stay there again!      "
975179,25975096,2015-01-31,20693394,Kelly,"My stay at Katie's place was fantastic! She was very accommodating when I booked very last minute. I enjoyed being in the heart of Ballard, close to the bus stop and only a short walk to downtown Ballard. Katie always had coffee ready for me in the morning. There were always clean towels, bed sheets and even a basket of shampoo/conditioner and other essentials in a basket in the room. I also loved her cat Lexi, such an incredibly sweet kitty! Would absolutely stay again. "
975179,27241555,2015-02-28,28461874,Josh,She was very straightforward and respectful of my privacy. She even gave me a car ride the next morning to my next destination. Katie is a class act.

She provided thoughtful recommendations and clear instructions. We left on foot and had a great full day out and about. Pristine lil neighborhood full of aromatic flowering trees with plenty of fun things to do at the bottom of the hill. Thanks, we enjoyed it!"

This was perfect and affordable. Nice quiet neighborhood, but close to breakfast spots in the morning. Downtown was a short, easy way up the road. Place is cozy. Very much like crashing at a friend's house. A clean, tidy, nice friend. :)
Definitely recommend it. Oh! And we forgot some pajama pants in our rush to get out the door. Katie was very sweet in contacting us quickly and arranging to leave them outside for us to pick up on our way out of town. Thank you, Katie!"

975179,32666327,2015-05-19,7491577,Jenna,"The room was clean and Katie provided everything we needed. However, if you are sharing the bed, just a heads up that it is on wheels and somewhat difficult to sleep on with two people (the whole bed moves when one person flips over). Ballad was beautiful and it was a safe neighborhood with plenty of parking. "

Even though she wasn't home, she was very thoughtful and guided us how to enter the house. There was no body home, as katie was busy at work,thats why we were a bit scared (only because we were totally new to the place, nothing serious), otherwise the location is very good, its quite and peaceful.Also, we got a sound sleep on our room. We met katie in the early morning, and she was very helpful and provided us with bunch of informations regarding shopping and sightseeing."

She made space in her refrigerator for my food, offered the use of her kitchen, as well as her blender for my early morning ""green"" smoothie. And early it was!  I initially communicated with her about needing to do vocal warm-ups around 6 a.m.  (and using a blender at around 7) to prepare  for a morning performance at 9:30.   Her flexibility was also appreciated.  And I liked that we communicated by phone and e-mail beforehand; she gave me clear instructions for how to get into her home if she wasn't there.  All in all, it was a relaxing, positive experience, and a lovely connection made."

She went out of her way more than once to help us out. Her house is very nice, clean, quiet, and cozy. We felt right at home and we would absolutely recommend her to anybody visiting Seattle."
975179,47337889,2015-09-17,23041280,Jen,"Katie made me feel very welcome, I was able to get the key easily and let myself in. The neighborhood is beautiful and my
Room was perfect! It was exactly what I was looking for.  Would absolutely book again! "
975179,47362288,2015-09-18,453102,Julie,"My flight got in late, so I didn't even meet Katie when I arrived and she'd left before I got up, but I still had a lovely stay. The location was perfect for my needs, the house was charming, and the room was very clean and comfortable. Thanks, Katie!"
975179,47602034,2015-09-20,27507633,Monica,"We spent just 1 night at Katie's but it was a nice visit. She was very prompt in getting back to us, even though it was very last minute. The house was clean and the neighborhood was nice. We were pretty close to the downtown Ballard area, which has many cool shops and restaurants. "
975179,49219238,2015-10-02,1346334,Mette,"Det er anden gang vi bor hos Katie. Katie er en dejlig, imødekommende vært. Hun er hjælpsomog hensynsfuld, frisk morgenkaffe hver dag. Værelset er meget rent og pænt, rene håndklæder efter behov.
Man deler badeværelse og køkken. Dette fungerer fint.
Katies hus ligger et dejligt roligt sted i Ballard. Man kan gå til Ballard med mange gode spisesteder, der er The Locks og en park med en smuk udsigt, alt i gåafstand. Der er god plads til at parkere foran huset.
Kan helt klart anbefales."
975179,49452544,2015-10-04,41392291,Lisa,Katie greeted me like I already knew her and made me feel right at home. The room was clean and comfortable and everything was so easy I didn't have to worry about anything. I will stay here again next time I visit Seattle!
975179,50410225,2015-10-11,14386664,Jenell,"I loved staying with Katie! My partner and I couldn't make it in until the evening, and she was very accommodating about it. The bed was extremely comfortable and the room was very clean. Katie was friendly but also gave my partner and I tons of space and privacy. I would definitely stay with Katie again."
975179,51226776,2015-10-18,11800494,Michelle,"I was in Seattle for a weekend workshop and was very happy staying at Katie's for the night. Her home is easy to find, in a great location surrounded by the adorable Ballard neighborhood. I would definitely go back next time i'm in Seattle!"
975179,52811830,2015-11-01,45957673,Becca,Katie was wonderful! She was able to accommodate me last minute. The house is beautiful and in a great area. I would happily return!
975179,53419731,2015-11-08,10567978,Nina,"Katie was very helpful, kind and respectful. I feel very comfortable in her sweet home. "
975179,53645803,2015-11-10,40234810,Nancy,Everything about my stay at Katie's was exactly as she had described it would be.  And isn't that what we desire from an Airbnb experience?  That bed is very comfy indeed.  Hope I can return before too long.
975179,53862916,2015-11-13,11801784,Caleb,"Great and comfortable place to stay, in a cool, safe feeling neighborhood. Katie was a very accommodating host."
975179,54558812,2015-11-21,3120681,Rachel,"I had a great stay with Katie; I arrived late at night from a delayed flight and she was so accommodating! It was such a convenient place to stay for a couple nights for a work trip, in a great neighborhood. I was very comfortable there. Thanks, Katie!"
975179,54692704,2015-11-22,49578704,Christopher,Katie was a very awesome and lovely host. My girlfriend and I were pleased to chat with her and pick her brain for great sights and restaurants in the area. 
975179,55371469,2015-12-01,9470170,Charles,"Our stay with Katie was wonderful.

When I had to make a trip to the emergency room during our stay, Katie drove my wife to the hospital to be with me. That was only one of her extra caring supports. We really appreciate her thoughtful support for us as her guests."
975179,55818660,2015-12-06,2205500,Sasha,"The neighborhood was fine. Parking was ample. The directions on getting the key was easy.And our host, Katie, left a note for us."
975179,56314360,2015-12-12,29628302,Nathalie,"The listing was exactly as described. The house is cozy and the bed is very comfortable.  The neighborhood is residential--very quiet and safe. Katie was personable and warm, and I felt very welcome in her home. She had coffee in the maker and ready to go every morning! She had water and toiletries and granola bars in the room for me."
975179,57770269,2015-12-29,44630545,Ziting,The house is nice and kitchen has everything we need. I would definitely recommend to other guests.
975179,58224198,2016-01-01,50874405,Hayley,House was very clean and nice. Exactly what we were looking for for the night! Thanks Katie!
8579782,49869666,2015-10-06,20335830,Matt,"Rebecca was very helpful, friendly and quick to respond to any questions I had. Checking in and out was a breeze. 

The apartment was clean, fully stocked with everything we needed and conveniently located between Capitol Hill and Downtown. Walking distance to nice restaurants and bars. 

"
8579782,50534314,2015-10-12,15681073,Ev,"Apartment was clean, cozy, nicely decorated, and most importantly, right next to the convention center. A great plus was having multiple sets of keys/key fobs available so that we could come and go from the convention without always having to meetup first. 

For coffee connoisseurs, it's also a quick walk to the Starbucks Roastery, which you should visit at least once during your stay.

If you are a light sleeper, there is some road noise. However, the location more than trumps this concern for a convention goer. Also, your neighbors in the building are very quite.

Becki was friendly, and responded quickly each time I contacted her. They did request I sign a short term lease outside of the AirBnB agreement, but it was quick and mostly retreads the house rules posted with the listing.

Doug met us in person when we arrived, showed us around the apartment and answered any questions we had about the stay. He called about 45 mins prior to our scheduled check-in and requested to move it up because he had multiple check-ins to do that day. Given that we had come up early to avoid traffic this wasn't a problem at all, but the last minute change would have been a little frustrating if we hadn't known the area and where we were planning to park our car for the weekend. However, once we got there he was friendly to chat with and efficient about getting us checked-in.

All in all, this was a convenient and comfortable home base for our Seattle stay.

"
8579782,53373513,2015-11-08,3940404,Sara,"Becki was very helpful with booking her apartment online. She provided great information about the neighborhood and check-in! The location of the apartment is perfect, especially if you are in town for a conference. You'll be right behind the convention center, so it's an easy walk to/an from conference space.

103920,2504001,2012-10-04,3359531,Krista,"Great place to stay, terrific location.  Accomodations were just what we were looking for and Trung was always available if we had questions."
4322622,50257890,2015-10-10,9485458,Benjamin,"We had the great honor of beeing Liz first airbnbguests.. that did not show, she is a pro host! We loved the house which was in a great neigboorhood with walking distance to Ballard and Fremont with their great  coffeplaces, vintagestores and restaurants! The room was so nice and private since it is on an own floor with an own bathroom. And the house is super clean and has a roofdeck with an amazing view! Liz is a genuinly nice person and we really enjoyed talking to her. We would definately come back if we would travel to Seattle again!"
4322622,51212735,2015-10-18,42795006,Miles,"I had a wonderful stay at Liz's place.  It was very comfortable and quiet, and in a great part of the city.  I found it super convenient to get downtown, one bus goes by the front door. Fremont has lots of interesting sights, for shoppers, eaters, and outdoors people, and they're easy to walk to. Liz had all kinds of helpful information for me, I am very grateful. She said I was her second guest, but I never would have guessed it...great host.
The listing is very accurate, and all the info Liz provided is helpful."
4322622,51420628,2015-10-19,42795006,Miles,"Liz was very amenable when my plans elsewhere fell through and I needed an extra night to stay.  Her house really is pretty, and she knows where to go for tacos. :)"
4322622,51974718,2015-10-25,22651227,Petronio,Liz was welcoming and accommodating. The house was very clean and the bed was very comfortable.
4322622,53297712,2015-11-07,5523992,Beth,"Staying at Liz's place was such a great experience for us. It's in an ideal location that is very quiet, safe, and within walking distance to local restaurants, bars, and cafes. It's about $10 to take a Lyft downtown, or it's just as easy to hop on the bus. We enjoyed ""living like a local"" while staying here as we walked to get coffee each morning and dinner each night. 
The place is exceptionally clean and the bed is comfortable. It's nice having a private bath as well. 
Liz went above and beyond to make sure we were comfortable and enjoyed our stay. She gave great recommendations for coffee, a seafood dinner, and even sent us information about whale sightings in Elliot Bay the day we took the ferry to Bainbridge Island. Liz is genuinely a nice person and we enjoyed talking with her. She is a great hostess! We really hope to return to Seattle and Liz's place some day! "
4322622,53697519,2015-11-11,32768738,Kate,Liz was a wonderful host! Great place to stay for wandering the city. Close to bus routes and great food. Walked to the Fremont Troll area (Milstead & Co has great coffee and staff!) and to the Ballard area. The room was very comfortable and pretty sure the bathroom floor is even heated which is great for cold weather. Would definitely stay here again. Next time we'll leave time to grab a beer with our host. We were sad we didn't have time to hang out more this trip.
4322622,54146917,2015-11-16,45851838,Kelsie,Liz was very welcoming and a great host. The area was perfect for what we were wanting to do. The house was very clean and nice. We are very happy with our first experience and would gladly stay with her again. 
4322622,54455282,2015-11-20,46035883,Heather,Liz was an exceptional host in a lovely quiet home.  Thank you for the great experience.  
4322622,54898133,2015-11-25,17198131,Kc,We had an excellent experience at liz's place. We have stayed at a handful of Airbnbs and I would say that hers was the best organized. Everything was spotless and it was nice to have our own floor. Liz gave us our own space but was available for tips and questions whenever we needed. I can't speak to public transport because we used our car the whole time but there was always parking close to the apartment. I would definitely recommend her place to anyone looking for a spot in Seattle.
4322622,55435042,2015-12-01,22894175,Rachel,I had a great experience staying at Liz's rowhouse.  The room was modern and beautiful and Liz was gracious and welcoming.  Everything was just as described. And the view from the roof is beautiful!
4322622,56605361,2015-12-15,44924338,Georgia,"Liz was a phenomenal hostess, with a fantastic place in a great area. She was exceptionally accommodating, and made sure to point out things about the area that I otherwise would not have encountered. "
7826593,44992812,2015-08-30,41717131,Rafael,Mack's mother was waiting for my arrival and she was very kindly while I was settled in.
7826593,46061078,2015-09-07,19806255,Sarah,"Mack was an excellent host! He was happy to share his recommendations, and was available to meet me when I got to town and show me around the apartment (even offered a ride to his place from the train station). Apartment was as advertised, and a great central location for me to get to everything I was going to see/do that long weekend."
7826593,46534178,2015-09-11,19856686,Hannah,"Diane & Mack were very flexible with the check in times, very accommodating and friendly. Apartment was clean & nice. "
7826593,56342513,2015-12-12,50574942,Ollie,"I had a fantastic stay in Seattle thanks to Mac and Sophia. They were very friendly and attentive and the property was exactly as described in the listing. 

Would definitely recommend this place to anyone. The location is excellent and the property and facilities are great.

Thanks,

Ollie"
4676275,41925555,2015-08-10,26651886,Oz,"The property itself is in a lively part of Seattle, which meant exploring was quite easy!

Additionally, the property was quite homey and I would recommend it to anyone looking to find a place to stay in Seattle :)

"
9507115,57390048,2015-12-25,18601469,Jade,"       The onsite manager Alan was really helpful during the time my friend and I stayed in Eric's place. He helped us to move our big and heavy suitcases when we arrived at and leaved the studio. Also, he replay messages promptly. 
       The studio is fairly close to the downtown area that it takes about twenty-minutes by taking the bus. 
        Overall, it was a great experience to stay in the studio. However, the studio is quite small for two people to stay I have to say. And if you have lots of luggage, it can be really crowded. "
4205026,37793314,2015-07-10,37003117,Richard,"Very comfortable, home-like place. Room is ample for 1 guest. Bath and shared areas are clean and easy to use. Lisa (hostess) is friendly and professional. I can highly recommend this room for anything from an overnight to an extended stay. 5 stars."
4205026,39527852,2015-07-24,37019159,Esben,"Though I was seven hours delayed because of a cancelled flight, I was well-recieved when I finally arrived. The room and home was clean, and the old dog friendly. The two small other dogs were a bit agressive, but Lisa kept them away most of the time. 

It was nice that there was both a washing machine and dryer available free of extra charge.

The house is in a residential area and 35 min walk from the university (20 min bus ride), and about the same from bars and interesting stores, and an hour from the city center. Plenty of busses leave closeby, so it is ok for a shorter stay. But gets a bit expensive with transportation in the long run, where Fremont and Capitol Hills are better positioned between the city center and university.
"
4205026,40362147,2015-07-30,37884452,Robin, The description of the room is very good.
4205026,40549869,2015-07-31,37925844,Clark,Lisa was great. Very able to accommodate us at the last minute. Her little dogs are there - to be sure - but it's all part of the charm. Lisa does not coddle them - she's a good owner. The location was just perfect for us.
4205026,41832107,2015-08-09,9853328,Betty,"The room was nice and the bed was really comfortable. There was a quick boil kettle with coffee and tea, along with water in the room, which was really welcoming. The neighborhood was quiet and residential, and the house is only a few feet away from a really pretty walking trail that tastes you to the U. Village shopping center if you need toiletries or food. Getting downtown was fairly simple too, because there's a bus stop just a block away from the house and Uber's come relatively quickly! "
4205026,42486079,2015-08-13,32382105,Dylan,"I had a very enjoyable stay with Lisa. The room was clean and comfortable, and Lisa was both very welcoming and respectful of my space. A few people have commented on the dogs, which I didn't have any issue with-- they were very energetic, and Lisa mostly kept them in her room. 

I should note that the bed is recessed into the wall, which could be a problem for tall people. At 6'3"", I was fine, but any taller and you might have issues. Overall, very good experience and I would stay there again."
4205026,44719022,2015-08-28,1837745,Birju,"THE room is comfortable, the dogs adorable, the hosts very thoughtful and considerate, the street quiet/safe, and the hospital a short walk away. I got there after midnight and had to leave by 8:30 in the morning, and they left an iron and ironing board so I could get ready for my interview. Thanks Lisa and Sonia!"
4205026,44877209,2015-08-29,40849617,Nick,"Lisa was a very friendly and welcoming host. She was very accommodation as well and made my stay very easy and fun. The room itself isn't very large but it's perfect for someone like myself who didn't spend much time in the room anyway. There was a mini fridge, little desk, couch, and many other small amenities like coffee and tea that were a very nice addition to the room. The bed wasn't particularly large either but then again, I'm 6'2"" :), however it was extremely comfortable and I got a great nights sleep in it. Finally, probably my favorite part was her dog Roscoe. He was a very friendly little guy but also very curious. He would push up the door if it wasn't closed all the way to check out what's going on and he would always lay out on the floor right outside of my door. All in all, it was a great place and Lisa is a fantastic host and highly recommended!"
4205026,48185132,2015-09-24,40768512,文楷,Lisa is very friendly and help me a lot. You will feel it like home. Three dogs are lovely.
4205026,48919538,2015-09-29,43377156,Maureen,"Lisa was super accommodating: I arrived after midnight but she had left clear instructions for getting in, finding my room, etc. The bed was very comfortable and I had a very pleasant night. 5 stars!"
4205026,49506814,2015-10-04,44295698,Stephan,"The location was very convenient, right in the middle of the university district. Lisa was a great host by answering any of my ""out of town"" type questions. The room was very clean and the bed was super comfortable."
4205026,49929026,2015-10-07,20624258,Teresa,"Great location if interviewing or visiting children's... Room is as in photos, and Lisa was very helpful upon arrival."
4205026,52447368,2015-10-29,42317243,Niviann,Very comfy bed. House was very clean. Check-in and -out was super easy. Perfect location if visiting the Children's Hospital or UW. 
4205026,52945691,2015-11-02,19659192,Jeff,"Fantastic stay in Seattle; one of the best airbnb's I've stayed at, both in terms of the room/house and in terms of the organization and welcome I received. Lisa sent a helpful and detailed summary of the room/house, transportation, and Seattle before I arrived, making it very easy both to get to the house and to find my way around the city after I got there. Beautiful and clean room, would absolutely stay here again on my next trip to Seattle."
4205026,53578795,2015-11-09,48277817,Aric,Super nice host.  Really accommodating.  Do recommend.
4205026,53730140,2015-11-11,48200807,Sanam,"This was my first time using Airbnb, and I absolutely loved my stay with Lisa! The room was clean and had everything I needed. Lisa was even kind enough to give me a free ride as I flew in and didn't have a car. She also held my luggage for me after check out! Overall, I had a great experience, and I would highly recommend!"
4205026,53837383,2015-11-13,44045857,Kevin,"I loved staying in the Seattle Room! Lisa was very gracious about my fluctuating arrival time. She and her roommate were warm and welcoming, and fun to spend time with. The room was clean, attractive, and peaceful. The doggies were adorable, once they stopped barking."
4205026,54220129,2015-11-16,43909176,Chen,The decoration of the bedroom is nice and warm. The host is very responsive and helpful. Parking is easy to find and the price is really good in the area. 
4205026,54482501,2015-11-20,9664445,Ellie,"Lisa was an amazing host! She made it easy to coordinate key pickup and arrival. The listing itself is awesome - it's a good sized room with a very comfortable bed and chair. I didn't stay long enough to need the microwave and minifridge, but it would be great if you were in Seattle for an extended period of time. Lisa provides a guest information booklet with a whole bunch of information I didn't even know that I had needed, but definitely found useful. This was basically the summary of my visit, though - Lisa consistently provided details that I didn't know I needed but really appreciated when I found out that they were there. (: You also can't beat the proximity to Seattle Children's - I walked to the top of the hospital campus in about 5 minutes from her apartment. "
4205026,55797697,2015-12-06,10797245,Sara,"Lisa went out of her way to make me feel welcome in her home and city! She provided detailed directions to help me find my way around, and had many suggestions for where to go to enjoy Seattle. The room was comfortable and clean, and included a mini fridge, microwave and basic essentials for a traveler. The location was also perfect for my trip!  "
6746826,45455440,2015-09-02,6202675,Kiet,Phuong was an exceptional host who provided an immaculate retreat away from home for us. The listing description was accurate and I very much appreciated the welcoming brochure of activities shared. Very tasteful furnishing. Pike Place is a MUST see neighborhood with a ton of great restaurants. Our favorite was the Queen City Grill!
6746826,45914786,2015-09-06,2152003,Justin,"Phuong's apartment was amazing, even better than it looks in the description. It's great inside, in the most central location - without being noisy - that you could hope for, and has every amenity imaginable. Highly recommended, and she was great in showing us around the immediate area and suggesting where in town we should head to over the weekend. "
6746826,46258835,2015-09-08,38699393,Shoaib,"Accurate, to the point, and very accommodating! Phuong and Miranda had eggs and bread per request the morning of my arrival for a short business trip. The description is more than accurate and the amenities are superb especially the convenience of a gym for my morning run. I will definitely be staying again at this place! 5 stars all across!"
6746826,46808643,2015-09-13,25281620,John Matthew,"Miranda and Phuong were very welcoming and attentive.  The apartment is in an awesome location, directly next to Pike Place and 1 block from the waterfront; it's an easy walk to anywhere in downtown seattle.  We were there for a conference at the convention center and walking was simple and quick.  The building is clean, modern, and has a nice courtyard and indoor pool.  The apartment has a balcony with a beautiful view of the water and a kitschy/awesome Wyland mural of some Orcas on a nearby building, which we loved.  We had four people bunking in here which was totally comfortable.  The fold-out futon (which is a beautiful piece of furniture during the day) requires a mattress topper to be comfortable at night, but Phuong provided this for us at no extra cost, which vastly improved the sleeping situation.  The only reason I am giving this place 4 stars instead of 5 is because currently there is a lot of construction going on, and no central A/C means you will want to have the windows open most of the time in summer; so there is significant noise issue especially in the early mornings.  However, if you can roll with that punch, it's hard to beat this place for location, cleanliness, ease, and fun."
6746826,47333423,2015-09-17,35571653,Kirsty,"Phuong and Miranda took our booking the day before so very last minute as our booked apartment did not work out. 

We are very gladly did! The apartment is in a great location across the road from the water front and a few minutes walk to the pike place market. We walked to the space needle in less then 20mins also. There are great places to eat and drink all around the apartment and a welcome pack at the apartment also had some recommendations on where to go. 

The apartment itself is just like the photos. It was very comfortable and clean in a very secure building with great communal areas. 

Phuong and Miranda were great hosts and really helped but is at ease and were quick to answer any questions or queries we may have had. 

We will definitely stay again if we are ever in Seattle and recommend this apartment. "
6746826,47449762,2015-09-18,43517714,Ali,"The photos do not do this place justice. Phuong's apartment was spacious, clean, and in the most central location in downtown Seattle with a quirky view of the water. On top of that, Phuong was the most accommodating and welcoming host!! We enjoyed our welcoming package and the delicious wine. Looking forward to staying here again the next time we are in Seattle! Definitely recommending your place for future visits. Thanks for hosting, Phuong!"
6746826,48236469,2015-09-24,1359699,Don,"Very much as advertised - clean, welldecorated and very centrally located in a smart building.  Phuong was very kind and helpful.  Cant ask for much more!"
6746826,48343101,2015-09-25,44445694,Len,"The listing description was accurate and the hosts were extremely accommodating.

The hosts were professional, organized, and prepared to make me feel at home. The directions were clear, concise, and more importantly, easy and conveniently described as to make my stay seamless.

The rental was immaculate. There were ample towels, bedding, blankets, etc. that I didn't need to go out of my way to get anything else. The stay was close to the popular attractions of Seattle, so that was a big plus.

After a busy day, it's nice to head back to a place to rest and relax. This place has been optimized to do exactly so.

I'd even recommend this place to my worst enemy. I left feeling satisfied and would come back to rent if I'm ever in the area. Thank you for being such great hosts!"
6746826,48584042,2015-09-27,40893468,Ulian,"My family and I had an amazing experience. That included a one year old. A lot of that had to do with our airbnb stay at phuongs & miranda. Its in the heart of everywhere you want to be and you can walk just about everywhere. Farthest places were about a mile away. Phuong was a great host. Answers the phone quickly and any questions you may have. The place is very clean with all necessary amenities. On top of that Phuong even provided us with milk for my daughter which was there when we arrived along with wine for the grown ups. What else? Bed is comfy. Foam mattress top makes the futon in the living room comfy too. Theres a nice balcony where you can see the water and ferris wheel while you have some coffee or wine. Id recommend anyone to stay here. Airport goers, use the rail, university exit dumps you about a block downhill walk to the apartment. $3.00 a person. "
6746826,51223920,2015-10-18,18372290,Shintaro,"I had great experience.
Great clean room and also quick response."
6746826,51678447,2015-10-22,34070119,Scott,Great location and great apartment! Clean and well kept and the host was incredibly thoughtful. Phuong took the time to know why we were staying and then customized her approach to enhance the experience. Will definitely stay again should the opportunity arise. Well done!  
6746826,52373087,2015-10-28,47162202,Lily,"My first Airbnb experience and definitely not my last, thanks to an amazing stay at Phuong's apartment. The location near Pike Place was perfect. It allowed us to rest our feet throughout the day, especially when it was raining. The rail service from the airport was convenient and the apartment was lovely, clean, and had all of the necessities. Phuong was so accommodating and sweet. Best part about our stay was the super comfy bed!! My goodness, we didn't mean to spend much time in the apartment but ended up taking many naps and sleeping in because it was so comfortable. Can't wait to return. "
6746826,52744961,2015-11-01,13958746,Todd,"Highly recommended; great host, apartment and location. Phuong was very responsive and accommodating. The clean, safe and secure apartment has everything you need, and building amenities (pool, hot tub, sauna, courtyards) are a definite plus. I would certainly look to stay here again whether traveling for business or leisure.  "
6746826,53307504,2015-11-07,2517099,Kristina,"This place was fantastic. The location is amazing and Phuong was very helpful and accommodating. The place is clean, well decorated and cozy. I couldn't have asked for much more. This was my first airBnb experience but most definitely won't be my last! "
6746826,53801741,2015-11-12,25683064,Brittany,"Phuong made us feel welcome in her condo.  We really enjoyed the location and the place was nice and clean.  She had the needed amenities, and the place was safe and quiet.  The only constructive comment is, when we received the breakdown of logistics and rules, we were highly encouraged not to speak to any neighbors and/or management, and also to state to neighbors/management (if asked) that we were friends with Phuong, rather than AirBnB guests.  This was our first time, so I am not sure if this is a normal request from other hosts?  Also, it did not seem as if anyone really lived there, and was a staged condo used only for AirBnB guests.  Other than that, it was a very pleasant stay, and Phuong was very kind, receptive and responsive.  "
6746826,54050837,2015-11-15,48447477,Thomas,"Phuong was great to work with. She is very responsive and provided a lot of great suggestions. She also provided complimentary wine during the stay. 

The apartment is clean and conveniently located at the heart of Downtown Seattle. Walking distance to Pike Place, Public Market, and the Gum Wall. If you want to go to the bars, it is only a UBER or LYFT away.

Also, the Light Rail is walking distance from the apartment for easy Airport transportation. "
6746826,56195748,2015-12-10,2493722,Tom & Hannah,"The place was really excellent. It's very well equipped and in a great building with a gym. Phuong is also a great host, she met me on arrival and was very helpful for the rest of my stay. It's in a great area in the centre to town, too. "
6746826,58208873,2016-01-01,37599863,Jordan,Gracie and Phuong were great hosts. We got a nice tour of the place and knew that if needed they would be on the call. Would definitely rent again from them. 
6400000,34906671,2015-06-13,35036857,Shalagha,"Amazing accomodation, amazing neighborhood. Market and restaurants at walking distance. Well connected to the city. Blankets, towels, utensils, you name it and there it was, everything was provided for."
6400000,36808398,2015-07-01,25626630,Darren,"Tidy, clean and comfortable apartment in a super convenient neighbourhood - handy to supermarkets, has a bunch of buses going downtown, and walkable to fremont etc."
6400000,38147449,2015-07-13,32309745,Rhondda,"This was a great place to stay- clean and had all the amenities needed. Adorable location, walk just a couple blocks to trader joes, Starbucks and great little restaurants in Queen Anne. Quick drive to downtown Seattle - pikes market, EMP, space needle- all about 1-2 miles away but by staying in Queen Anne, we didn't need to worry about parking and it was a safe, quaint community for family. Great place to stay! "
6400000,39943083,2015-07-27,31527089,Katherine,"Great place! Accurate description. 
Easy directions for check-in. "
6400000,40758052,2015-08-02,15728785,Cynthia,"Apartment was clean and as described. Perfect location in Queen Anne, right on bus line to downtown and to Seattle Center. Quiet neighborhood. Basic kitchen utensils and appliances provided. Pluses and minuses of basement apartment: it stayed cool in spite of record high temps in Seattle; and, unfortunately I could hear every movement of people upstairs (loud enough to wake me one morning). "
6400000,41960215,2015-08-10,23879707,James,"Nice place, had all amenities we required for a comfortable stay. Great location with a lot of useful places/stores locally."
6400000,43878250,2015-08-22,41678000,Stew,House was very clean when we arrived and getting in was very easy. Posting was very accurate and the location was one of the best parts pretty much walkable to most areas and lots of parks nearby. Walls being thin was the only thing holding it back from being a 10 so I rate it a 9/10. Would recommend!
6400000,44319040,2015-08-25,38559552,Jenny,"We had a very nice stay here. The unit was well appointed, but I will admit that we didn't use the kitchen much, so can't speak to that.   Check in was easy and Gene and Shannon were quick to respond to requests.  The location is great, and was easy walking distance or cheap uber/taxi rides to downtown and Ballard.
The neighborhood is quite nice with good food and shops within walking distance- had a great breakfast at the 5 Spot.  parking was easy, even on the weekend.
"
6400000,44975533,2015-08-30,28652472,Kevin And Family,"The apartment was exactly as described and pictured.  Fresh towels were laid out and bath/hair products were provided.  The bed was comfortable with additional quilts and blankets for cooler nights.  Having the full sized washer and dryer was a plus.

The location was fantastic! Walking distance to great restaurants and stores.  Parking was easy too.

Once the family upstairs returned, footsteps could be heard but it was expected (discussed in a previous review) and not really an issue."
6400000,48302173,2015-09-25,42414410,Donna,The location was ideal for our needs and the neighborhood was quiet and safe. We appreciated the privacy of checking in and out independently. When we had a small problem the host responded immediately and fixed it. The apartment was very comfortable and had everything we needed. We would recommend this location to anyone.
1030411,14560750,2014-06-22,15093216,Lina,"We had a great trip to Seattle staying at Kymber's house. She's prompt with her communications and accommodated our additional request for a crib and high chair. The house is beautiful, spotless clean and the beds are comfortable.

Though we didn't meet Kymber in person but we were welcomed with a gift ( thanks again). She left a detailed instruction for the house and neighborhood. The house is close to all the attractions we planned to go and also has parks nearby for my two years old to run around. It is tastefully decorated and has a state of art kitchen and remodeled bathrooms. The neighbors are really nice too. We were even invited to a beer night with them. The two cats are easygoing and my daughter enjoyed watching them. 

We had a great time and will definitely stay here again if we come back to Seattle to visit. Thank you for everything, Kymber and family!
"
1030411,17837757,2014-08-18,9390868,Debora,The owner left us a couple bottles of wine and a wonderful note! The neighborhood is great. The neighbors are friendly and we went out for a drink with many of them. 
1030411,24432058,2014-12-28,17271907,Gail,"Charming Craftsman style home near excellent Seattle Zoo and Green Lake Park. Kymber made us feel very welcome -- and her cats were quite friendly. Nice homey dining room and living room, fabulous kitchen. Beds are a bit high up -- glad they had a stool for short people like me. Immaculate bathrooms. Highly recommend."
1768883,8234169,2013-10-21,6663082,Todd,"I recently spent a week in Seattle, partly for work and partly for fun. Katrina and Rania's apartment was perfect for us. Their home is beautifully done and very comfortable! Although I didn't have the chance to cook, the kitchen would be a great place to prepare a meal. Walkable to many bars, restaurants and downtown (15ish minutes). Parking was easy (pass provided). All in all, a great stay in a great location. Highly recommended."
1768883,9933890,2014-01-20,563568,Ashleigh,"Katrina and Rania's home in Cap Hill was treat to stay in.  Their home is wonderfully and whimsically decorated, the bookshelves stocked with interesting reads,the kitchen is fun to cook in, and the location couldn't be better to take advantage of all that Cap Hill has to offer.

"
1768883,10884556,2014-03-11,8293001,Amanda,"A really clean, cute, colorful place to stay! Well-situated in Capital Hill, two blocks from the Safeway and Bakery Nouveau! Also two blocks from all the great shops and restaurants of 15th Ave and 4 blocks from the excitement of Broadway! The downstairs neighbors were friendly and quiet. There is a dishwasher and onsite laundry. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone wanting a real Seattle experience away from the tourist hype of downtown. The hosts were responsive and helpful as well, and they are some of the best I've worked with through airbnb!"
1768883,15139569,2014-07-03,15443370,Barbara,"We enjoyed our stay in this well-designed apartment. ""Bright"" is definitely a good description - the space was warm and inviting and Katrina was helpful and responsive. And the location is great, within easy walking distance (or a short bus ride) to so many wonderful places to eat and explore.  My first Airbnb experience was better than I could have imagined!  "
1768883,24408242,2014-12-28,22221188,Carrie,The directions about the house were great as well as advice about the area on places to go to.
1768883,38262991,2015-07-14,1868533,Matteo,"We spent a week in the house and absolutely loved it. The location is superb,short walking distance from the main attraccions of Capitol Hill and very close to downtown as well.
The house itself makes you feel like home,which is something i find important when I travel.
It was perfect for what we were looking for. Highly suggest it!"
3868138,17911322,2014-08-18,19979658,Troy,The location is a really good one and the room is comfortable and clean. There's a great English pub at the bottom and an even better residence area on the roof top. We walked to the fonte for breakfast every morning  and it was stellar.  Parking is a challenge but that's Seattle. Great place to stay 
3868138,18362669,2014-08-25,19781160,Christa,"We had an amazing time when we stayed at Miranda & Mike's place.  It is stylish, comfortable, and very conveniently located.  The view is outstanding, we watched the sun set over the water almost every evening.  We walked just about everywhere!  Lots to see and do in walkable distance.  Miranda and Mike were available throughout our stay for questions and advice, couldn't have been more welcoming and kind.  They even left us a nice bottle of bubbly!!  I would not hesitate to recommend this property.  I hope to be back soon!!  Here's a warm thank you to our lovely hosts!!  "
3868138,19058284,2014-09-05,1554184,Dawn,"Staying at Miranda and Mike's apartment in downtown Seattle could not have been easier. I flew in from San Francisco and took the light rail to Pioneer Station, where her friend Bobby met me and walked me to the apartment building. The flat is new and clean. The building is very secure and has a beautiful rooftop with amazing views. It was the perfect spot for me to stay during my 2-day business trip. It's a nice walk along the waterfront in the morning and Pike Place Market is an enjoyable 8-10 minute walk away. Tip Top doughnuts and great coffee are right next door =) Miranda was super friendly and answered any questions very promptly. Thanks Miranda!"
3868138,19427100,2014-09-12,787727,Doug,"Miranda and Mike were fantastic hosts. They were always available and made it really easy to check in and check out. The apartment is right on the waterfront, in the most convenient location, and is basically brand new! "
3868138,19811523,2014-09-18,21426016,Chris,"The location couldn't have been any more perfect. A few blocks away from the Mariners/Seahawks stadium in one direction and close to Pike's Place market in the opposite direction. The condo was furnished tastefully and had everything I needed including some surprise gifts I didn't expect but were welcome!

The impressive open-terrace roof deck with killer views of mount rainier and the sunset was an added bonus. Miranda checked-in to make sure I was doing okay and is a really pleasant, positive and genuinely caring person.

Couldn't have asked for a better trip to Seattle and don't think I'll ever stay in a hotel again!"
3868138,20039891,2014-09-22,15695828,Francois,"Very good location, in the middle of everything downtown.  You can literally walk to any attractions in Seattle.  The unit was perfect and the view is great.  It's great to be in a place where you can walk to nice restaurants and return at the end of the night without ever worrying about a car.

The unit was perfect and every essentials were provided: clean towels, hair dryer, dishwasher soap, shampoo ... It was great to have a washer and dryer since we spent multiples sessions @UrbanYogaSpa ... and this is some serious sweat factory."
3868138,20262461,2014-09-26,1994525,Lisa,"Excellent experience -- this apartment was better than a hotel. Miranda responds to messages immediately and I really enjoyed my 4 night stay. The apartment is clean, well decorated, and stocked with the essentials to make sure it's comfortable (fast WiFi, AppleTV and a few local stations, soaps/paper towels/detergents, and kitchen supplies).

I made use of the apartment gym, which had the latest treadmills, weights, and some other circuit equipment--perfect. This apartment was the quietest I've experienced in downtown Seattle (and I've stayed at a lot of different hotels in this city), and the location was great. Highly recommended."
3868138,20470722,2014-09-29,5960697,Christopher,Great place and very comfortable.  Miranda was very prompt and always helpful.  The home was just as described and in pristine order.
3868138,21967997,2014-10-27,21705705,Blaire,"When we entered the apartment out mouths dropped open. It was in a perfect location and just beautiful. We felt very lucky to be there. Great location to the pier, pike place market, owl and thistle, and much much more. The rooftop deck had a beer festival going on and it was so fun! We played pool and laughed the whole time. We loved staring out at the view. This place couldn't of been better. Miranda was a Doll and brought is champagne and chocolates. She was the best. I would rent any place she hosted. :)"
3868138,22327220,2014-11-03,22693207,Stephanie Brooks,I can't say enough about how wonderful our stay was! The apartment was very comfortable and close to both Pike Place and Century Link field. We were able to walk to dinner downtown and to Century Link for a game. Miranda was so easy to work with! She met us for an early check in and really made us feel welcome! We will definitely be back soon and look forward to renting from her again!
3868138,22547707,2014-11-09,2305601,Michelle,"I had a wonderful stay here. The bed was super comfy, the view was amazing, and the location couldn't be beat! I walked almost everywhere I wanted to see and there's a convenient Starbucks literally around one corner. Miranda was very nice and accommodating. I would recommend staying here and would stay here again myself.  "
3868138,24360744,2014-12-27,14634171,Emily,"I stayed with Miranda and Mike after returning from my most recent deployment. Being military, it's often difficult to predict my schedule, but Miranda was so flexible, and worked with me continuously until I had a solid date/arrival time.  

It's a stunning apartment in the perfect location. I loved the proximity to everything downtown, and the apartment itself was incredibly furnished, with 1st class amenities. Walked to Seahawks and Sounders games. The rooftop level is a city unto itself, with a well equipped gym/yoga studio, movie room, barbecue grills and unmatched views. 

The kitchen was outfitted with everything I needed, just walked to Pike Place Market for the ingredients, and came home to cook. Grubhub is a great app for restaurant delivery, with Mexican, Italian, and Chinese restaurants delivering to the apartment. Jimmy Johns also delivers. 

Like other reviewers have mentioned, Uber works great for getting around the city, and Instacart works like a champ for grocery delivery. 

This apartment is perfect for solo travelers or couples, a third would be tight, but do-able. I fell asleep on the couch a couple times and slept great. 

I was here long enough that I rented a parking spot in a nearby garage, but street parking is usually available, and the pay-by-phone app works great. 

There are some homeless people scattered here and there, just like in any big city. But as a female on my own here, I didn't have a single negative experience with them, even when coming/going late at night. 

I am stationed in nearby JBLM, Wa, and Miranda and Mike truly went out of their way to provide me with a ""stay-cation"" that was perfect for me. Would whole-heartedly  recommend this apartment to anyone wanting to immerse themselves in the Seattle experience.

3868138,24632081,2014-12-31,6095670,Nicholas,The hosts were welcoming and thoughtful. The apartment was fantastic. It was a short walk to Pike's Place market and there were tons of great restaurants in the area. I loved the breakfast sandwiches at Homegrown across the street. The lounge area on the top floor of this building was spectacular! 
3868138,26185590,2015-02-06,10218518,Cory,We have worked with Miranda several times and she is fantastic!

3868138,26401740,2015-02-11,26699212,Michael,"Great location within walking distance to all Seattle has to offer. Great bars, and great food just outside the front doors.  The apartment was clean, and a complimentary bottle of wine was provided upon check in.  Miranda was quick to respond to all messages.  I look forward to booking with her for my next trip to Seattle! 5 stars all around."
3868138,26534254,2015-02-15,26070336,Mason,The apartment is beautiful. We are very happy with the experience. The facility is amazing as well!

Eve was really helpful with her tips on pubs etc.  Will deffo stay again when I return , sofa and bed are extremely comfortable. "
3868138,28550926,2015-03-25,524198,Dan,"I've stayed w/ Eve & Michael a few times now, highly recommended!"

This place was beautiful,  just as advertised,  and Eve was kind,  thoughtful,  and always available. I asked about kitchenwares available in the kitchen  so my boyfriend and I could cook a dinner our last night  in Seattle and she responded in minutes! Eve was so accommodating  and kind. When we return to Seattle,  we will definitely be staying here again!!"

3868138,29206690,2015-04-05,29282963,Nick,"Everything was amazing.  Eve was super accomodating with an early check-in and a late checkout on Easter Sunday.  The apartment has everything you could need for a wonderful stay.  The views from the apartment and the rooftop are simply breath-taking... picturesque.  Getting around couldn't be easy... short walk to Pioneer Square and Pike's Place Market.  A central location with delicious doughnuts and coffee in the building, a real barber across the alley, and the ferry to Bainbridge right across the street.  Modern apartment with super quiet neighbors.  I felt right at home."
3868138,29869215,2015-04-13,3630515,Annie,"Eve's apartment was spacious, well equipped, and beautifully decorated. We rented Eve's apartment for 3 nights and had a fantastic stay! The apartment is in a very tourist/business friendly area as it is close to downtown and the Pike Place Market. We were able to walk almost everywhere we wanted to go, including meeting up with friends to go bar hopping in Belltown (it was about a 30 minute walk). Uber was also really fast picking us up from the apartment, we almost always had someone there in 2 mins. The view of the water from the apartment was amazing, and we loved being able to wake up to seeing the beautiful sunrise in the mornings from the big windows. The building itself is large, and has a lot of tenants, but we always felt like we had the same amount of privacy as any hotel, if not better because there was a private side entrance to the building. Lastly, Eve was such a warm, and efficient host! She surprised us with a bottle of wine, and was always super quick to respond with any questions I might of had. If I didn't have any questions, she even checked I with us to see how our stay was going. I would definitely rent the apartment again next time I visit Seattle!"
3868138,30201930,2015-04-19,27774803,Alex,Great apartment and location. Eve was thorough and accommodating. 
3868138,30836659,2015-04-27,31622161,Marissa,"As a host, Eve was incredibly accommodating, flexible, and kind. The space was beautifully appointed and impeccably clean! Easy walk to Pike's Place, and the highly rated Top Pot Doughnuts is located in the same complex. Not to mention the amazing rooftop views! I would highly recommend both Eve and this space. Thank you!"
3868138,31387083,2015-05-04,434732,Angelo,"Terrific space, easy instructions, could not have asked for something better. Eve is a pleasure to work with, highly recommended"
3868138,32033063,2015-05-12,13246187,Ross,"One of the best AirBnB places that I have stayed at! FIVE STARS! Plush furniture , clean, nice view, would highly recommend this place, best bang for your buck , and don't forget to go up stairs to the roof top balcony on the R1 floor, makes you feel like your living on top of the world with the most amazing views I have ever seen of seattle, and the booking agent Eve is a First Class kinda woman , professional , polite , honest and Absolute BEAUTIFUL person. Tell her ""ross sent Ya"" ;).  "
3868138,32386414,2015-05-17,32011092,Sengdara,"This was our first time using airBnB and it was a great experience, we stayed at Eve's place with our toddler and 3 months old baby, Eve was really accommodating, she went above and beyond to make us feel like home. Her place is nice and clean, the building has all of the amenities that we needed and the building has an amazing rooftop deck with views of the puget sounds and safeco field and great location. I would definitely rent from Eve again."
3868138,32920750,2015-05-23,32704748,Ron,"This was my first experience with Air BandB and have to say it was PERFECT from the moment Eve handed over the keys to the kind extension of a late checkout was wonderful . So thank you for making my first experience so memorable, "
3868138,34128192,2015-06-05,21054166,Steven,"Eve met us after our long flight and 7:35 PM arrival in Seattle.  The apartment was well appointed and as described.  It was spotless.  All the essentials were there for a comfortable stay.  The building is just above Pioneer Square and there are a fair share of homeless people in the neighborhood.  In fact, from our window, facing beautiful Elliot's Bay, we could see a regular crew of about 4 homeless folks camped out at night under the viaduct entrance ramp.  WE NEVER had an issue with any of them, but Seattle has become full of panhandlers, not just around the AirBnB location.  The bed is somewhat soft, but nonetheless, we slept very well.  The linens and towels were new, clean and of excellent quality."
3868138,34654166,2015-06-10,9034580,Chris,"Eve was great. Very accommodating and helpful. The apartment was in a great location for convention centre, shops and bars and pike place market. The apt. Itself was beautiful and really comfortable. Would definitely recommend. Roof top terrace was a great place to chill out with a glass of wine, overlooking the city and harbour. 
"
3868138,35216304,2015-06-16,31654971,Laurie,"We loved staying at the apartment during our visit to Seattle.  The apartment was beautiful - I miss looking out at the sound and seeing the mountains.  It is within walking distance to Pike Place.  Eve was very nice and accommodating and even met us at 1:00 a.m. to let us into the apartment.  We would definitely consider going back.  Our favorite restaurant was the Pink Door.  We just had lunch on the patio (and did not see the show inside), but the view and food were wonderful."

The location was perfect, as well.  Eve made our stay so enjoyable - she was easy to get in touch with and very responsive.  When we come back to Seattle, we're definitely going to stay here again!!"
3868138,35783441,2015-06-22,30557387,Jennifer,"Great space, great location. Looks just like the pictures. We enjoyed our stay and would recommend this to others."
3868138,36069262,2015-06-24,24676290,Austin,What a great experience for my first trip to Seattle in a while! The space was immaculate as described and very warming. Eve was easy to work with even with my delayed flights and accommodated nicely. I will use their services again next time I am on Seattle for sure! !
3868138,36224767,2015-06-26,33211254,Michael,Eve was awesome. Really responsive and quick to communicate. I know Brian really enjoyed his time.
3868138,36957168,2015-07-03,3180681,Karen,"We had a great time in Seattle. We took the ferry to Bainbridge, visited Pike market a few times, went to top of Columbia Tower for unbelievable view, grab sandwiches at Salumi and did some shopping at Nordstrom all within a short walk. The unit was very clean and comfortable. The washer & and dryer a huge bonus for us. Having everything we needed in the way of shampoo and bath products and a bottle of wine was a very nice touch. The weather was unusually warm for Seattle with high 80's most days. I was so thankful to have the air conditioning, even though it could have been a bit more powerful.  I would definitely stay here again. Thanks Eve and Michael for sharing your place with us. "

3868138,39489495,2015-07-24,12511938,Halley,"This place is a gem! Eve is very attentive and accommodating as a host. The view from the rooftop is really unbelievable, you'd be lucky to find anything better at a hotel. We were thankful for the A/C in the summer heat, and the in unit laundry was a nice perk. The location is good, with lots of shops and restaurants within walking distance. We only wish we didn't have to go home!"

Thanks Eve. "
3868138,43965307,2015-08-23,37872468,Amy,"This apartment is perfectly situated - right between Pioneer Square and Pike Place Market, just a block from the wharf.  The view was great from the apartment, but spectacular from the rooftop. It was beautiful when we there so we spent each night on the deck, picnicking and watching the sunset. In the event of rain, there are is a game room, reading room, and a lounge up there too.
The apartment was clean and comfortable - a great place to stay!"
3868138,45244917,2015-09-01,27173230,Yezee (Kate),"I have been staying at the same building for 2 years in a row. I really love the area, and air conditioning! The apartment had everything that we needed to cook a light meals. Love the place!"
3868138,45858236,2015-09-06,37247039,Alexander,This was a rare situation where reality was even better than advertisement. Perfect location. Amazing rooftop. Apartment is so comfortable. This is a MUST. We will be back. 
3868138,47266271,2015-09-17,39498546,Leticia,"Great views, great location. We were able to walk to most places including Pike's Place and many great places to eat. Apartment was as described in photos. Everything we needed was supplied. Great convenience having a washer and dryer in the unit. Having a great place to stay made our vacation truly enjoyable. Fast responses to any questions. We were able to check in early due to our flight schedule and that was a great convenience."
3868138,51299868,2015-10-19,21281342,Scott,"Daniela was a great host. Arriving at the unit presented a couple of slight disappointments - not with the unit as much as its' readiness - and she immediately corrected everything. Daniela had just taken over management of this unit so seeing her provide the solutions right away meant more to me than a perfect arrival.

The apt unit became home over the two weeks we were there. The area is GREAT! My friend from California needed to be in the heart of downtown while I was away at the office during the day - this location was perfect!

Drawbacks to the apt unit is that many of the wall outlets needed messing with to get equipment to charge. Parking leaves a lot to be desired - it is doable to find parking just outside the door, but the owner not offering the garage parking is a significant negative. Another one is that the apt is not truly stocked with food and very little coffee, even. Compared to other Air BnB places I have rented this one was the least ""stocked"". The size of the refrigerator, microwave and stove/over, however, made for a quick remedy to that once we went out to the stores to buy food, drink, etc.

We found that although many of the tenants owned dogs, we never heard a dog bark, even once, during the two weeks. People were friendly, happy and conversant. My friend from California has an unforgettable memory of her first trip to Seattle, and this apt and it's decor, views of the bay and location, entirely contributes to that perfect memory. "

5270886,34830312,2015-06-12,34035370,Jeni,"We took the light rail in from the airport for a very pleasant and scenic ride. Once at Emma's place we noticed right away how clean, beautiful, all the comforts of home were right there. The bed is hands down the most comfortable bed I've slept in while traveling...super dreamy! 
Seattle was unusually warm during our visit, but Emma was quick to come to our rescue. Not only did she cheerfully bring over two really nice fans to cool us down, but she respected our privacy by asking if we minded her stopping by while we were out on the town. She was just wonderful. 

Pike's market had the most amazing peaches; sweet & juicy as all get out - the kind I haven't tasted since I was a kid. I even bought flowers for my sister in law for a song, and now I want to go back again. There's so much to see; we could have easily spent a week or longer :) I hope we get to come back soon - we'll definitely stay here again!

Thank you for such a wonderful stay; we couldn't have had a better location or hosts!!

5270886,36075048,2015-06-24,6724090,Brett,"Wonderful apartment in a great neighborhood, close to everything downtown. Emma was great in helping with our last minute booking, seamless check-in and the parking was a big plus for us. Couldn't ask for more! "
5270886,37812388,2015-07-10,908454,Jonas Toft,Great location. Exactly as described. The apartment was very clean and we were able to fit our family of 5 (3 children) there. We also used the fitness room and patio. We highly recommend it.

The place was very clean, comfy, and accommodating! We would be happy to recommend to anyone visiting Seattle, and happy to stay here again on our next visit!"
5270886,44574905,2015-08-27,11059442,Jenni,"Great space, everything was as described and more. Literally minutes from everything and very easy to find. Emma and Van are very organized thought of every little detail when they put this place together. Keep up the good work, will definitely be back again! "
5270886,45486922,2015-09-03,39070797,Kathryn,"This was our first Airbnb stay, and Emma was very helpful in sending along a PDF of helpful instructions for check-in/out, parking, and many other recommendations for things to see/do/places to eat. The apartment was very well organized and tidy. The location was great - within walking distance to the market. We appreciated the use of the parking garage as we did have a rental car during our stay, and the garage was very convenient, safe, and inexpensive (included with the room!). We would definitely stay here again!"
5270886,45781571,2015-09-06,36057784,Lin,Space functioned very well for our group.  The location was perfect for our needs and the neighborhood felt safe.
5270886,53619350,2015-11-10,12639040,Theresa,Emma's place was setup very nicely. Everything was labelled and well organized. We were even able to cook a seafood dinner the last night of our stay. I loved that we were able to walk to all our destinations. The only thing I would note is that the sofa bed was a little uncomfortable. You can feel the springs in the mattress. I would definitely come back and stay here again. 
6750430,35036984,2015-06-14,26165696,Ian,"When my wife and I decided to spend the night in Seattle, Jessie's place seemed perfect. Turns out, not only was the place quaint and beautifully kept, but Jessie went above and beyond to make sure our stay was wonderful! Great area right by the space needle, comfy bed, cute breakfast nook, and full kitchen! Jessie made sure we were settled in and answered any questions we had promptly. Highly recommended!"
6750430,35424348,2015-06-18,4006645,Christopher,"Nice location for anyone wanting to do things in downtown Seattle or the Seattle Center.  Jessie was great about arranging a meeting time, parking pass, and checking in if I needed anything.  Very comfortable bed but it is a double (not queen, about which her listing is clear) and sort of in a corner of the bedroom so not so convenient for a couple.  If you had more than two staying there the sofa in the living room is a futon sort so it can accommodate more than two people.  The kitchen could use some help - both microwave and dishwasher were out and there are no pots except a very large kettle w/o a lid and one very large fry pan.  If you cook a lot this could be problematic.  A great feature though is a free washer/dryer in the basement of the building (well multiple washers and dryers) and for those traveling for some length of time this is a godsend.
Area is pretty quiet, bathroom is nice, and the very large screen HD TV also a bonus with netflix and other services."
6750430,35507308,2015-06-19,31028046,Neal,Great apartment and great location. The place was very clean and had everything we needed. 
6750430,35720410,2015-06-21,23025724,Reese And Rob,"Our stay at Jessie's apartment was lovely! It was clean and simple and just steps away from City Center, Space Needle, EMP, and the Monorail. I would absolutely stay there again. Jessie met us to give us the keys and parking pass and was so pleasant. She made herself available if there was anything we needed during our stay and even checked in with us on our second day to see how we were enjoying ourselves. The apartment was well stocked with whatever we could have needed (wine glasses, "
6750430,35857754,2015-06-22,30747355,Kady,Jessie's flat was beautiful and clean and so refreshing to be so close to everything! I would recommend this flat to anyone!
6750430,36582788,2015-06-29,4910342,Claire,The location was perfect for our one night stay in Seattle. You are in close proximity to queen anne and Belltown -- listing is exactly as describe. Super easy check in even though Jessie was not able to meet us in person. She was very helpful and responsive. Highly recommend! 
6750430,38167432,2015-07-13,14858570,Erica,"Jessie's place was in a great location, easy to get to and easy to walk to many places in the city. It's was very clean and had everything I needed. She met me the day I arrived and made sure I was comfortable. She even gave me several suggestions for places to eat. I did have a bit of trouble with the door locks so be sure to ask her to show you how to use them as they can be a bit stubborn. 

The only point of stress I experienced was when I asked Jessie about adding a friend to the reservation. She was able to join me last minute and I didn't think it would be a problem since the listing is for 2 people and 2 beds. At first Jessie was not willing to accommodate us ( which cause a bit of stress on the day of my arrival) however eventually she did allow it which made things so much easier for my friend and I. 

All in all I would still highly recommend her place and I am grateful for her accommodating my friend and I. "
6750430,39635821,2015-07-25,3983080,Ilya,"Jessie's place was exactly what we needed. The location was perfect, easy to get to everything. The neighborhood is awesome. The place was clean & both beds very comfortable. No complaints. Jessie was also very responsive & helpful throughout our week-long stay."
6750430,41364672,2015-08-07,33616311,Linda,"The apartment was cozy and tidy. It's a little tight for four people but worked perfectly fine. We enjoyed staying there because it was the perfect location for what we had planned. Jessie had set up the apartment as she described with extra blankets available, which we needed. The area was nice. The mornings were a little loud with a dump truck or a large truck loading or unloading something but it didn't stay long. Overall I enjoyed the apartment it was neat, clean, and exactly how it was described. Thanks for being a great host. "
6750430,45077333,2015-08-31,35108900,Ajahnae,"We enjoyed staying at Jessie's place in Queen Anne! It was the perfect location, very easy to get to and exactly as depicted in the picture. You have a very nice place! The place was very clean and she provided what you'd expect to be there (towels, soap, hair wash, fresh linens, etc) although we didn't have a need for everything (was good in case we left something behind). Jessie was also very responsive to any questions I had and frequently checked in on us during our stay. We were only there to sleep and shower so we didn't use the TV or the kitchen, except to store leftovers and drink water. I'd highly recommend Jessie's place; it's in a great location: near downtown, plentiful uber drivers (very cheap), neighborhood bar (Tiny Bar), restaurants on QA Blvd, etc. I would definitely stay here again if I'm visiting Seattle in the near future. Thanks for hosting us Jessie!"
6750430,46839778,2015-09-13,13275919,Sean,"Jessie was very accommodating, especially given the last minute booking. The place is as advertised in a great area of Seattle. She also did an amazing job of staying in communication, making sure we were taken care of. We had one small issue with the key and she immediately came to help out and resolve the issue!"
6750430,47861499,2015-09-21,13555846,Jerry,"Great host and apartment.
Conveniently located, walking distance from great restaurants and attractions. Very quiet and comfortable.

6750430,48931234,2015-09-29,1638427,Kevin,"Jessie was incredibly helpful setting everything up and a pleasure to work with. The apartment was perfect for us and in a gorgeous neighborhood right by the Space Needle. Had an amazing time in Seattle. Thanks again, Jessie!"
6750430,50101410,2015-10-09,14945066,Andrew,"Great space, felt very homey. Jessie was super easy to communicate with, and was very helpful--she even messaged to check in and let us know there was an umbrella we could use when it was raining one morning!"
3773784,17192975,2014-08-08,6720721,Rachel,"Booking with Seth was stress-free and easy. He responded quickly to our rental request and we were able to make arrangements in a timely manner. My husband and I were welcomed by Seth when it was most convenient for us, and he was gracious with his space and time upon our arrival. He gave us pointers to the neighborhood (great walkability for fabulous food and bars in Capitol Hill) and showed us around a bit. His apartment is located within a block from a city bus line to downtown and the navigation is simple (even for those unaccustomed to using public transportation). We were comfortable throughout our stay and thoroughly enjoyed our experience. "
3773784,17411580,2014-08-11,4540172,Matthew,Cool apartment with lots of interesting art on the walls. We also enjoyed having musical instruments to play. Good location. Enjoyed walks around the neighborhood and there are some excellent cafés within walking distance. 
3773784,17594772,2014-08-14,7517981,Jennifer,"It was so easy to communicate with Seth! He responded quickly and efficiently in the booking process, and made sure to check in with me over text. I had no trouble getting into the apartment even though he was on vacation, and everything was laid out and ready for me - he is the sort of host who places chocolates on the fresh towels. The apartment had a wonderful feel about it, and Seth has done a great job decorating the space. Shower was one of the best I've ever had. :) He's also so generous - he encouraged me to use his art supplies, instruments, candles, and anything in the fridge - I didn't take him up on most of that, but I appreciated the sentiment! My only complaints were that the building is a bit old/musty/dorm-like, and further away from the main Capitol Hill drag than I'd realized (over a mile walk) with nothing particularly close by. "
3773784,17662356,2014-08-15,2919059,Gail,"While Seth was easy to communicate with and friendly, his apartment really did not work for us.  The foldout couch in the living room was badly stained, very old, and had some kind of debris on it, and was unsuitable for sleeping (our stay was prior to his warning about the couch on his listing).  The building that the apartment is in was very musty and in bad repair, and the apartment was two floors down, which is rather inconvenient if you have luggage.  The apartment itself has personality, but could really use modernizing, and the location is not really walking distance to many restaurants, cafes, or shops.  All in all, I felt that the apartment did not live up to the price, which is quite high."
3773784,17899102,2014-08-18,8868676,Roos,I enjoyed my stay in Seth's apartment. It's close to restaurants in capitol hill and has a lot of public transportation possibilities nearby. Seth is very easy to contact and is there when you need him.  
3773784,18741909,2014-08-31,11494662,Helen,"We had a lovely stay at Seth's apartment.  We had a bit of trouble gaining initial entry to the block but once we'd got hold of Seth he was able to sort it quickly.  Seth also gave us a long list of great places to eat in Seattle which was much appreciated and we went to an amazing Vietnamese restaurant called Monsoon which is within walking distance.  The apartment is also well situated for public transport and we used the buses to travel downtown on a few occasions.  Seth was a friendly, helpful host and i would recommend others staying here."
3773784,19282722,2014-09-09,175337,Angela,Great little place with clean towels and amazing water pressure in the shower!  Seth was great at communicating and I would stay again!

3773784,28451726,2015-03-23,25797190,Elise,"Seth's place in a great location, very cute neighborhood and walkable.  The bed was very comfortable and clean.  Seth was easy to reach and very helpful.

From the outside the apartment building is really cute, however, when we walked inside we were a little disappointed.  The building does not seem like it's well taken care of and it smells pretty musty.  We were only in the apartment late at night and early morning, so it worked for us, but I don't know that I'd suggest booking it if you plan on spending a lot of time in it."

3773784,32995612,2015-05-24,29877807,Ariel,Seth's place is a cozy apartment conveniently located in Capitol Hill. There is a bus just across the street that takes you all the way down town. Very close to bars and good restaurants. 
3773784,34495346,2015-06-08,33986488,Meghann,"We had a wonderful experience at Seth's fabulous place. The apartment looked just like the pictures. Comfortable bed and furniture, lovely little touches everywhere - even fresh flowers! The location was perfect - easy to find, lots of great coffee places, restaurants, etc. Seth was so helpful with restaurant and entertainment recommendations, too. Checking in and out went completely smoothly. Would highly recommend Seth and his place to anyone looking for a delightful Seattle getaway!"
3773784,34713435,2015-06-11,31489714,Lisa,"Getting into the building initially was difficult, but once we got a hold of Seth, things were fine!  He is extremely nice- I felt like I had to ""ask"" to use parts of his apartment, but he was welcoming!
His place is indeed cozy and the apartment is well kept.  
It is very obvious he is an artist!  He also has a stack of board games for guests.  If I didn't have family in Seattle, I definitely would opt to stay here again!"
3773784,34949392,2015-06-14,30587255,Ronald,"We had a wonderful experience in all respects with the Cozy Getaway. Seth was prompt and courteous in all correspondence leading to our arrival. He was flexible on arrival day. He provided info about the area--what to see, where to eat, public transportation, parking, etc. The Getaway itself is a charming apartment with big windows, lots of light, hardwood floors, and great art on the walls. It is clean and airy. We were within minutes of everything we wanted to do. "
3773784,35689781,2015-06-21,6083531,Don,"A warm, comfortable apt.  Quiet, great art, Seth left some beautiful bouquets of flowers.  Getting in and out was very easy."
3773784,36061364,2015-06-24,4153917,Katie,"Seth was on top of staying in contact and left clear instructions on how to get into the apartment which happened easily. Listing was as described and the neighborhood is an ideal place to explore all Seattle has to offer. It is in a residential neighborhood for the most part with a supermarket within close walking distance. It is on several very convenient bus lines that can take you anywhere you need to go. Walking around the Capitol district and to great restaurants is hilly like the rest of Seattle, but safe and interesting and accessible if you are a good walker. Apartment is quiet, light, and restful.

Seth was immediately available when I needed anything and very hospitable and friendly. 

Neighborhood is quiet but great. Easy walking distance to food / coffee / etc. 

The apartment was not immaculate, but generally clean. My only feedback would be to make sure it's cleaned between guests. 

Overall great though, thank you Seth! "

The apartment is situated a bit off the main drag, but still walkable to many shops and restaurants. The interior was artsy and quirky, a real creative type's kind of place. I can be a bit allergic to dust and did have some sneezes here. The one recommendation I'd make is that the unit be deep cleaned as there's hair, dust and debris in some of the nooks and crannies of the place. That said, overall still had a nice and quiet stay at Seth's. "

Not only that, but close to major bus lines and a Zipcar spot, and walkable to downtown, the international district, Queen Anne, and the U-District. Cafes, bars, and coffee shops are short walk up the hill, with a Trader Joe's a few short blocks away. Seth's a fantastic host who went out of his way to make me feel welcome. "

Mary is such a great host, she made everything easier for us before and during the stay. The apartment is neat, clean, organize, and simply elegant. Two thumps up for Mary :)"
7241905,40979992,2015-08-03,22448867,Jennifer,This was a great stay! The location was very convenient for our event and the hosts had a beautiful apartment! The added touch of the personalized note and bottle of wine was very sweet!

7241905,46482626,2015-09-11,35017829,Stephanie,"Mary and Eric were great hosts! While they were not available to greet us personally we felt completely welcomed with an adorable note and gift when we got there.  Even before our trip Mary was great following up if we had any questions and providing a print-out to answer any potential questions we might have.  The apartment had everything we needed - it was really comfortable/clean, had a convenient location, and felt super safe.  We had a great time in Seattle and Mary's hospitality definitely contributed to it. Would definitely stay again!!"
7241905,46889915,2015-09-14,38707090,Christina,"Mary made my first Airbnb a very pleasant experience! The thought of staying in someone else home was difficult for me to fathom initially but Mary's attentiveness and welcoming approach made it a seamless experience. 

When I booked with Mary she asked me for any specific request I had, and check in with me multiple times as my stay approached. Upon arrival at her apartment it was beyond my expectations. Mary's place is clean and well kept, she accommodated my requests, and she even had wine, a card, and helpful tips for my stay. I am beyond pleased with my experience!"
7241905,47729208,2015-09-21,27654424,Carina,"Thank you Mary for hosting us in your beautiful apartment :) we really Love it! And we had some great days in Seattle. The flat is close to everything and you don't need a car for visiting the city. Everything was really clean and perfect comfortable :)
Thank you for this nice first AirBnB-experience! Jens & Carina from Germany"

6543677,35695578,2015-06-21,6127118,Félicie,"Very good stay at Felix'home where we felt at home. Felix is very friendly, we liked his home and the neighborhood too. Easy access to downtown (direct bus in 20-30 minutes) and to the beach. Thanks !"
6543677,36883650,2015-07-02,86192,Veronica,"Felix was an amazing host, he went out of his way to make us feel welcomed. When we first arrived, he helped us unload our car and provided great advice on places to go around Seattle and especially the Ballard area (his neighborhood). He also helped us with storage, even after our stay was over. A very approachable and  gracious host to be around and we even had an enjoyable lunch at a local taco place with him. Also the AC was perfect for the heat wave we experienced, we were always comfortable and the equipment was easy to use and hi-tech. The room was exactly as described and the house was kept clean and neat. His dogs were very sweet and well behaved. Overall it was a great deal, a pleasant experience and we would have stayed longer if we could. I would recommend Felix and his home to anyone coming to visit Seattle."
6543677,38282454,2015-07-14,12760766,Alexandria,"My boyfriend and I had a great stay in Seattle, and Felix's place was a big part of it! He made us feel welcome, and gave us great advice on things to do. "

6543677,39115949,2015-07-20,33462669,Denis,"Felix was out of town the day I checked in but he has a cool Bluetooth access app for his front door which was cool, so check in was easy. I was met later that night by his partner Chloe and the dogs which were all very excited to meet new guests. The dogs love a bit of attention so make sure you're prepared to give them a good pat and that it's evenly shared between them, you don't want to be seen to show favouritism Karma will make sure of that. The room was just as listed. Beautifully presented, very comfortable bed, clean and well sized private bathroom. The dedicated split system aircon for the room was great especially for the out of ordinary hot days experienced by Seattle during my stay. The atmosphere of the house was fun and inviting with Felix and Chloe often extending invites to join them in social activities. I really enjoyed my stay here and would stay there again. "
6543677,39393932,2015-07-23,12657396,Justin,"We loved our stay with Felix! Could not have hoped for a better landing spot on our first trip to Seattle. The location is great: we were able to get a sense of local life, but its also very convenient to get into town for all of the touristy sights. The whole place is very clean, the puppies are very fun and friendly, and Felix is a great host. He has a great knowledge of the city that he is more than willing to share. We would certainly stay again! "
6543677,39947234,2015-07-27,34909611,Amy,"My fiance and I stayed 3 nights at Felix's house. The room was very clean and organized. Felix was very nice and accommodating. The moment he met us he told us to treat his home like our home and he gave us some really great restaurant recommendations! On top of all that, his 2 boxer dogs were very well trained and super affectionate which is always a plus! We had a great trip in Seattle thanks to Felix! =)"
6543677,40629856,2015-08-01,23719268,Aissa,"Felix was a great host! Very friendly and welcoming. Shows you around the house, the amenities, and makes you feel at home.  On top of that he also offers suggestions of places to visit in Seattle based on your interests if you need any help with that. The private room is very comfortable, especially with the queen sized bed. It was convenient to have my own bathroom, and his three dogs are adorable.  "
6543677,41949877,2015-08-10,17479462,Frank,"Felix was an awesome host! The room was amazing! It was modern and comfortable! Kloe and Felix made our stay in Seattle feel like we were at home! The location was really nice, it was very easy to get into downtown and around town to do what we wanted. On top of all that, Felix has 3 dogs and they were so much fun to play with! Our stay in Seattle was definitely so much better because of Felix's hospitality. 
The room also had extra pillows, covers and stuff like that. Made it really easy for us to make ourselves comfortable. 

I would recommend anyone to stay with Felix! "
6543677,42448231,2015-08-13,39370768,Shawn,"Upon walking into Felixs' abode, we were greeted with a friendly message offering us coffee and snacks. This was a great indication of how our stay would go. Although Felix was out of town for work, he was very available to us via text/email. Khloe was staying at the house with their awesome dogs and ensuring our stay was comfortable and effortless. These hosts were an amazing host of great suggestions for activities, coffee, breweries, and restaurants in Seattle. "
6543677,42971110,2015-08-16,25661433,Wenyu,Great first airbnb experience for me. I ended up staying three nights at Felix and Chole's home. They are very friendly and kind. The house was beautiful and the room and bathroom were clean and very comfortable. 
6543677,43970006,2015-08-23,19136158,Anne,"Felix and Khloe were wonderful hosts! They are friendly and welcoming and you feel like you're visiting friends. The room was as described and the bathroom was clean. They also did nice things such  letting guests use the laundry and provide snacks and small breakfast items. The location was very good, there are a couple of restaurants, a coffee shop and breweries within walking distance and 2 bus stops nearby.  Overall, I had an excellent stay here and a great trip to Seattle."
6543677,45509529,2015-09-03,18920247,Dennis,Felix was a great host. Was in town for an interview and he answered my questions about living in Seattle. Great neighborhood with plenty of good restaurants. Downtown Seattle is about 15 minutes away by car (took an Uber). 
6543677,47838038,2015-09-21,43670833,Link,"Great NW Seattle location. Home was immaculate. Room was clean, quiet and comfortable. "
6543677,48010630,2015-09-22,24287323,Brenda,"Our stay at the Comfy Seattle Neighborhood with Felix was exactly as we'd hoped it would be.  The room was comfortable, quiet and private.  Felix made communication easy and really made us feel welcomed.  We appreciated the location as well; it was easy for us to drive to locations in Ballard, Fremont, the U District, and Northgate, or take public transportation to experience Seattle's downtown."
6543677,50135576,2015-10-09,31062054,Carissa,"Had an awesome couple of days at Felix's place. The location was great with plenty of places to head out in the evening and easy public transport access to downtown.

Felix has really put a lot of thought and attention to detail into being a host and the room was lovely.

I highly recommend Felix."
6543677,51400487,2015-10-19,846767,Jessica,"I found Felix to be the quintessential Airbnb host for my needs. From the moment I arrived, he was helpful, open and easy to talk to. It was my first week in Seattle and my first day in Ballard. Since I'm considering a move, Felix patiently went through the neighborhoods with me and even offered to show me around Ballard himself, which of course I was thrilled to accept. It definitely made a difference getting a firsthand look at the neighborhood from a local.

His location is not in the heart of Ballard but it is walkable, and for me this is actually preferable because it helps me get to know the area better. Plus, you're near other neighborhoods. I also spent some time in Fremont & Wallingford. Around the corner from his place is the best cup of coffee I've ever had (Slate). Since I was wary about parking while in Seattle, I'll touch on that - I parked free on the street right across from Felix's place twice. No problems. I also did some driving around the neighborhoods and found it pretty intuitive. Nearby are some very cool places worth visiting, mainly the Ballard Locks (stop by the Lockspot after for amazing fish and chips) and Gas Works Park (trust me).

Your room is across from Felix's and he also rents out another room downstairs. A huge bonus is that you have a private bathroom. This is a definite score. Luckily, the downstairs traveler was as fun & relaxed as Felix and the three of us got along great. 

Felix has two Boxers who love attention and are well behaved. They will take their cue from you about whether or not you want to play. I only recommend dog lovers here.

I was very comfortable overall. The room/bathroom was simple and clean. Felix provided snacks and water bottles (potential life saver when you're traveling). Parking was easy. I recommend Felix's place to travelers who are looking for an experience over a solo stay, who are open and willing to explore the neighborhoods and also to those who love dogs. I would (and actually might) stay here again."
6543677,52545925,2015-10-30,47148582,Wendi,"I had a wonderful stay. Easy in and out, close to everything I wanted to see and do, and clean. Felix was a good host, provided everything I needed and made me feel comfortable. Sweet dogs too!"
6543677,53854003,2015-11-13,48079304,Dev,"Felix was awesome. Very accommodating for my late arrival and very clear and informative. His place is very nice, clean, and quiet. Would definitely stay again."
6543677,55463946,2015-12-01,39174351,Monica,"Felix place is just as in the description and in the photos. The location is a great residential area and you can go Downtown by bus very easily. The are a couple of great places near the house to eat; coffee, Chinese, pizza and a Fred Meyer. 

Felix has a very nice decorated place; living room, dinning room, fully equipped kitchen and delicious free snacks. You will find everything you need in the cozy room. The most amazing thing about staying with Felix were his two wonderful boxer dogs; Kai and Karma. Although the bathroom is not in the bedroom, it is that close that you will feel it as private and only you will use it.

I just moved in to Seattle and Felix was a great host who gave me excellent ideas. I will definitely stay with Felix again if I had a chance.
"
6543677,57144867,2015-12-22,47909999,Luis,"For my first time using Airbnb, Felix has set the bar very high for any other host I encounter.
The room and accommodations were amazing. Felix makes you feel right at home and is always willing to answer questions or help with anything you may need. 
Great host, great personality, great hospitality! I can honestly say, my stay with Felix is exactly what an Airbnb should feel like... like you're home."
8187537,47386334,2015-09-18,11217298,Kristen,"This listing was just as described. Great apartment and building amenities! It is a convenient walk to Pike's Market, downtown, and Capitol district. The Space Needle and Chihuly Garden is also a nice (about a mile) walk.

You can take the lightrail from the Sea-Tac airport to the apartment. It was a cheap and easy way to travel between the two places. It drops you off  2 blocks away from the building.

Sarah was really accessible and quick to respond to all my questions. Very helpful! "
8187537,48783131,2015-09-28,1913966,Marsha,"Sarah was friendly, easy to contact and very responsive to questions. The apartment was great - very clean, a comfortable bed and an excellent location for sightseeing in Seattle! The view from the deck is amazing.  I would highly recommend this property."
8187537,49991915,2015-10-08,8269473,Thomas,"Sarah was a great host - from the moment of booking, she was very communicative, updating us in regard to a room switch and offering us free parking. Location of the apartment was amazing. Very close to shopping, coffee, and great restaurants. Walking distance to almost everywhere. Close to water. Apt very clean, bright, and comfortable. Pictures do not do justice. Building very nice with gym and other amenities should you desire. Overall 5 stars -- one of the best AirBnB's we've stayed at through multiple different states/locations."

Bed was very comfy, great shower and tub.  Rooftop deck has some amazing views and was a great place to meet friends and congregate.

Felt very secure with the 24hr doorman.  All in all great trip and great space."
8187537,51959636,2015-10-25,45718836,Diana,"I had a great experience in Seattle at Sarah's condo everyone was very informative & friendly. Place was nice & quiet with a great view of part of downtown Seattle within walking distance to Pike Market & the movie theatre & the mall. Place was clean with plenty of towels. Best part was her bed I literally slept like 8 hours best vacation ever. She had enough dishes to cook a home cooked meal. Wifi worked good cable was on point. Definitely would rent this place again next time I'm in Seattle. 5 star rating in my eyes ;) only negative thing I gotta say is coffee maker wasn't to clean but it wasn't something I couldn't take care of , I washed it really good before I left for the next guest. Thank you Sarah it was a great experience overall much love & appreciation from San Diego California Diana Chavez "
8187537,52350017,2015-10-28,1001726,Debra,"We have stayed in one of Sarah's spaces in the Premier on Pine building before, and it was a wonderful reentry into the country after a  summer abroad. This stay was far less auspicious (just for work) and it cements why we'll make her spaces our go-to spots when we visit Seattle. Very close to my work, small yet open, and with all the comforts we'd ever need. Can't wait for our next visit! (Malcolm)"
8187537,52559350,2015-10-30,9894934,Oliver,"Das Apartment liegt im 25ten Stock eines neuen Hochhausen in Downtown Seattle. Es ist luxuriös ausgestattet und hat einen tollen Blick auf die Stadt. Sarah ist sehr bemüht um Ihre Gäste und löst alle Probleme teilweise schon bevor sie auftreten. Auf wunsch kann ein Tiefgaragenparkplatz mit gebucht werden, so daß man unabhängig ist von den überhöhten Parkgebühren in der Umgebung.
Wir hatten eine schöne Zeit in Seattle und würden die Wohnung jederzeit weiter empfehlen."
8187537,52829283,2015-11-02,493628,Linn,"We did not meet Sarah, but she was quite communicative regarding what we needed to do to get into the apartment and park.  The apartment had an amazing view and we loved going to the roof-top patio to look out at the city and port. It was also a great location for walking easily to the waterfront and taking the sky tram to the space needle."
8187537,53195594,2015-11-06,28635497,Mak,"The host was easy to access and responded promptly.  The apartment was as represented and the neighborhood was a great access point to downtown Seattle. The amenities of the building are a great asset-- a work out room, business office and large social space on the 40th floor with amazing views. "
8187537,53461413,2015-11-09,42641585,Troy,Great Location downtown. walked just about everywhere front the location. Beautiful rooftop deck with panoramic views of the city. Absolutely breathtaking. The apartment was very cosy. Had all the essential items needed to cook breakfast and relax. The bed was probably one of the most comfortable beds i have ever slept on. Sarahs instructions were very easy to follow to check in and out. I highly recommend this unit! Thanks again Sarah...
8187537,54096258,2015-11-16,24285763,Jess,"We loved our stay. Sarah was super accommodating to our several phone calls and questions. The apartment was perfectly sized for us, clean and beautifully decorated. We walked to the market each morning as well as to several restaurants and other shopping. We can't wait to return to Seattle and would definitely stay with Sarah again. "
8187537,54391077,2015-11-19,45490233,Steven,"Sarah was great in responding to me with questions I had and very accommodating. Did get to meet her briefly as well.

Location was great! Few blocks away from the Westlake Station where you can get to and from King Street Station (train) or Sea-Tac Airport. Area seemed extremely safe at night, even walking around past midnight. Easy to walk to anywhere you want to go, I walked everywhere except for the one time I took the monorail (also by Westlake Station) out to the Space Needle.

The building itself was great with a doorman in the lobby. Very secure as well. The condo itself was perfect. Pictures are true to what it really looks like. Plenty of room for myself and would be fine for more, glad I didn't go with a small hotel room. 40th floor rooftop view was great too, almost felt like I didn't need to go to the Space Needle. Definitely will be staying with Sarah the next time i'm in Seattle.

8187537,54999407,2015-11-27,46849621,Olga,"The location of the apartment was perfect! We could easily walk to the market and to the train stations. The apartment is close to multiple stores, which was great! The apartment was very clean and secure."
8187537,55460692,2015-12-01,35880966,Khalil,"Great location, walking distance to everything in downtown Seattle.  Place is well maintained and sets up great as a short term rental.  The 40th floor owners lounge is a great amenity and provides a comfortable space to work or relax.  There was a miscommunication on obtaining the keys from security or concierge (it was thanksgiving and no one at the building to help me) but Sarah worked with me to resolve the problem very quickly.  Would absolutely rent again."

8187537,56936264,2015-12-20,48596515,Beth,Sarah's unit affords a fine view to the sound although the Christmas lighted construction crane smack in the middle of it may portend of diminished visibility in the future. The amenities and security are top-notch even though I did not use the lounge and media areas on the 40th floor. The concierge and reception are very helpful!
8187537,57311506,2015-12-24,49483140,Omar,The place is awesome with its perfect location. It is a clean and safe place. I really recommend it.

Located in the lovely Ballard neighborhood, Lauren's B&B is only a 10 minute drive from popular downtown locations including the Space Needle, is next to a 7-11 convenience store for quick restock, and is within walking distance of awesome Ballard shops. Lauren and Gabriel are also super friendly too! 

Highly recommended especially if you are planning to explore Seattle with a car"

4258515,34231248,2015-06-06,20409876,Cassie,"Lauren, Gabe, and their children were great hosts during our stay in Seattle. I had previously used an airbnb location in Magnolia which I loved, but it was booked this time around so I hoped Lauren and Gabe's place in Ballard would be as wonderful and it did not disappoint.

Extremely safe neighborhood, extremely close to many big bus lines including 2 direct lines to downtown, and there is even a downtown area a few blocks down from the apartment with major nightlife of its own. 

I didn't spend much time in the apartment during the day but it was a quiet place to sleep which looked exactly like the pictures and I slept more soundly than I ever do at home.

Thank you Lauren and family! :)"
4258515,34615698,2015-06-09,31647904,Joe,"I appreciate Lauren accommodating us (party of 4) in such short notice. Lauren is pleasant, hospitable, flexible, and unobtrusive. Her home is located in the heart of Ballard near area amenities and attractions. The rooftop deck offers a relaxing oasis above the city streets. Overall, a prime spot with a fantastic host."

4258515,37707338,2015-07-09,36875867,Leanne,Lauren was very kind and accommodating. My friends and I loved the neighbourhood! 
4258515,38134616,2015-07-13,34072499,Tang,"This is the worst experience with Airbnb, we shared a two bedrooms with Lauren's faimillies with 3 kids and a dog, they go out of their bedroom then we are out of the apartment and go back to the bedroom when we come back, which makes us feel not friendly and uneasy, well we still smell the unpleasant smell of the dog. They didn't wash their dishes and damp the gabage bin  in time as well in the kitchen. The most unfriendly thing is that we can not even leave our heavy bags at her home after 11:00 in the morning of the day we leave back home, which she has mentioned when I check in and let us feel very not friendly, and that is not imaginalble that we hadn't access to the WIFI in such a modern day! I will never come back and live in any Airbnb apartments!"
4258515,39073563,2015-07-20,37441033,Stefan,"La habitación estaba muy limpia y tranquilo. La ubicación es perfecta. Algo fuera del centro de  Seattle, pero uno llega muy rápido y fácil con el transporte al centro. Y en la tarde se puede disfrutar la tranquilidad de Ballard.  

Muy recomendable."
4258515,39660914,2015-07-25,15488093,Hank,Lauren's kids are adorable and the free parking was great and it was also great to be able to walk to old Ballard neighborhood and all the seaside parts on Puget Sound. What a fun city!
4258515,39950203,2015-07-27,2897076,Shelby,Lauren was very kind during our stay. The room is clean and the location is close to lots of fun restaurants and shops in the Ballard area. 
4258515,40460705,2015-07-31,35336983,Jeff,Lauren and her husband were very welcoming and helpful! I was admittedly a little wary as this was our first time using Airbnb but everything went smoothly. We had 4 adults packed into the room so it was a little tight but we made due. The 3 kids were all very well behaved and quiet.
4258515,40858427,2015-08-02,10859134,Gian,Lauren and Gabe's place was in a great location. It was safe and secure and both of them were very kind and friendly. Having a parking space available was a huge bonus!

4258515,41630323,2015-08-08,11279966,Emily,"Overall, we had a great experience! We were only looking for a place to sleep for a cheap price in a clean place - this is exactly what we found! The place is right next to a RapidRide bus stop, which was perfect for getting downtown. There were a ton of shops, cafes, and restaurants a walk down the street. Lauren and her family were very sweet and helpful. They pretty much just let us do our own thing and gave us plenty of privacy, which was fine! Our room was clean and quaint. The fans in the room kept it at the perfect temperature. The only thing that was kind of a hassle was when my friend went back to the condo during the day to use the restroom and the dogs were in there. He didn't want to mess with them, so he had to go somewhere else - but obviously this is not a big deal, just something to communicate! Like I said, we had a great experience!"
4258515,41939678,2015-08-10,33054271,Joanna,"Lauren and her family went out of their way to make our experience comfortable and convenient. The space was small, but nice. Thank you!"
4258515,43508721,2015-08-20,37594798,Mark,"Lauren's place was perfect for where we wanted to be in Ballard.. Easy walk to stores, restaurants and bars.  Easy access to buses for a quick trip downtown .. Very nice host with all of the accommodations we needed"
4258515,43734942,2015-08-21,25170885,Shawn,"Lauren and Gabe are excellent hosts. The whole place was beautiful and very clean, laundry access was a big plus, dinner on the rooftop was fun. The family was real quiet and accommodating. Highly recommend staying here if you're willing to share a space with the hosts. "
4258515,48478264,2015-09-26,44538525,Lindsay,"This place is in a great location in Ballard! The rooftop area with bbq is quite nice and if you have time to use the small gym, it also looked nice! 
The apartment itself was, however, a bit of a disappointment. Just very awkward... Basically this is their 3 small children's bedroom complete  with bunk beds and hard mattresses that becomes your room.  I am not opposed to bunk beds. The hard mattress, however,  was not great nor was I sure the blankets on the shelves were clean. The first one I pulled out did not smell at all good.  There was nothing but a fitted sheet on the bed. No pillow. Nothing. I didn't think there was a door at all when I arrived because it slides along the wall with no way to lock it. 
While Gabe was friendly and took me on a little tour when I got there, I didn't find Lauren particularly nice. 
You have to walk across the kitchen and living area to get to your room. (All five of them and the two dogs retreat to the other bedroom.) 
There is a hamster or gerbil with a squeaky wheel that I listened to for a while that night. At some point he was also brought into their room. I was grateful for that but, again, just awkward... Quite easy to feel like you are inconveniencing them. 
The bathroom is over next to their room. The thought of taking up the bathroom with five other people waiting was a bit off putting. I did not shower. 
In addition, while I think it's a great thing to homeschool, knowing all three kids were home all the time and I was occupying their room did not leave me feeling secure or that my things would be left untouched by little hands, even if the kids were all very sweet. (They're still small curious children.) 
I did not complete my stay. In fact I only stayed one night of the three I'd booked. It was all just too awkward... Thank you, Gabe, for trying. 
I really hesitated in leaving a review but I got numerous reminders to please do so from airbnb and I guess I feel other people should know my experience. I texted Lauren twice upon my departure to talk to her about my experience. She did get back to me. Kind of the attitude I found from her while I was there as well. I'm sorry it couldn't be a more positive review."
4258515,49708595,2015-10-05,26008798,Mark,"The perfect spot to stay in if you're looking to explore the Ballard area. We really enjoyed our stay here, and would definitely stay here again. Very clean and easy to get to. No Wi-Fi in the house though, but easy to find at local cafes and bars and breweries. And there are a lot of breweries nearby!"
4258515,50052961,2015-10-08,15133953,Jay,"Awful experience! I was looking forward to staying at Lauren's; however, she was unresponsive, and after several hours, I let her know that if I didn't hear from her I'd have to make a reservation with a different host. She did not reply to that message until after I had made another reservation. I requested she cancel the reservation as it was the fair thing to do. Only THEN did I get a reply that basically stated she has a strict cancelation policy, refusing to work with me. Note she has a mere 40% response rate. I feel absolutely cheated by her and airbnb.  Avoid. "
637710,3349943,2013-01-14,4667134,Jenn,"We rented Farhad's house for a one night trip to Seattle, and had a complete blast!  The house was amazing, complete art district charm right in the middle of great restaurants/bars/music/nightlife.  We came up from Portlanf for the night for my boyfriend's birthday, I set up the rental, and the group was SO excited once we got inside!  It was a big lovely house, one block from the canal, with three bedrooms, two with two beds.  Farhad himself was SO geat to deal with.  He let us bring our dog, and even recommended some great restaurants, one where we could bring the dog IN to eat with us!  It was one block away and completely delicious:)

We had so much fun and would rent this place again in a heartbeat.  It was both myself, and Farhad's first AirBNB experience and from my side I have to say it was completely great!  If we head up to Seattle again you can bet we will be staying here again!"
637710,3978775,2013-04-01,5201132,Cory,"Farhad was a wonderful Airbnb host. The house was exactly what I needed for the night, he was punctual with communication, and left very clear and reasonable house rules for us to follow.  I would be happy to be hosted be him again.  Thanks so much Farhad."
637710,5074384,2013-06-10,3839051,Thomas,Farhad was an amazing host to my friends and I. He gave us some fresh baked bread to eat and had lots of great suggestions for places to eat and visit. His home was warm and inviting and was in a perfect location close to restaurants and shopping. I would definitely stay here again.
637710,5169435,2013-06-16,6779004,Emily,"We enjoyed our stay at Farhad's house.  When we arrived, we were a little surprised at the fact that the stairs are as steep as they are and there are no banisters.  The fact we have small children, this was a worry.

  The house was comfortable and clean.  Not the easiest location to find as it is in a business neighborhood."
637710,5755453,2013-07-15,6668881,Courtney,Chill housing in walking distance of cute coffee shops and bars. Great option if you're young and on a budget. Farhad was super nice!
637710,5835658,2013-07-18,3684883,Mel,"Farhad's house is in a perfect location. It's walking distance to lots of restaurants, shipping and a grocery store. His house was very cozy and perfect for a group traveling through. Thank you for the tasty bread and the great hospitality. Pet friendly is a plus too!"
637710,5968577,2013-07-24,7002453,Deborah,"Roots@ the Center of the Universe was completely perfect for us. We were a party of 8, mainly family, staying briefly in Seattle on business. We arrived to live music (Farhad checked beforehand whether we would be OK for his weekly band rehearsal to go ahead in the basement), and  the warmest of welcomes. It was a lovely surprise to have the run of the whole house, which is perfectly located to explore Fremont, and an exceptionally generous host. The house is old but the beds clean and comfortable, the shower piping hot, and the neighbourhood quiet. It was our first time to use Air BnB, but I would guess Farhad has set the bar high for future hosts.
"
637710,6002324,2013-07-26,6254719,Dustin,"The level of hospitality shown to my group and I on our recent trip to Seattle was nothing short of spectacular.  From the moment we stepped foot into the door we knew we had made the right choice to stay there and that feeling was affirmed time and again throughout our trip.  I fell in love with the Fremont neighborhood while we were there and honestly feel like I made a lifelong friend in Farhad.  He knows he better call me if he ever visits North Carolina.

Anyway, about the place.  This is not the main downtown drag of Seattle.  So if you want to go stay under the Space Needle this is not the place for you.  But if you want to get a taste of what real Seattle is and how real people from Seattle live, then just stop reading now and book this place immediately.  That is what we wanted, and did we ever get it.  World-class food, beer, and coffee shops all within walking distance and reasonably priced.  Awesome art everywhere and record shops that blow the ones I have at home away.  A sweet park across the street with a jogging path that went down by the water.  I mean what else could you want?

This place is not a 4-Star hotel.  If you think you're getting that for this price then you may be delusional.  But it is 100% honestly represented in all of the pictures and descriptions.  The beds are clean and warm.  There are also 6 of them, which was big for us because we had 6 people.  There is a cool little outdoor area that is very private.  An additional bathroom/shower would have been ideal (there is only 1), but we made it work without too much difficulty.  Farhad will probably leave you some kind of fresh-baked good or fresh fruit, and it will be amazing."
637710,6028639,2013-07-27,1568796,Shanza,I stayed here for an evening with six friends while traveling through Seattle. Farhad was a great host. He recommended many local spots to check out and even brought us fresh bread and other treats from the farmers market. The house was clean and spacious. We would definitely stay here again.
637710,6103528,2013-07-30,6216951,Kit,"We stayed 2 nights in the secluded house in Fremont. Far had was an excellent host dropping by to offer suggestions and fresh baked goods/fruit. 

The place is a best fit for the 20-30 something crowd though it would certainly work for others. 

Noise is never an issue as it is the only true residence on the block. The rest of street is filled businesses with normal 9-5 work hours. 

Highly recommend. 
"
637710,6340391,2013-08-09,5929176,Kelley,"Roots is an outstanding bargain in a great neighborhood.  It’s an eclectic house with 5 single beds, one full bed and a queen futon, so there is lots of room.  The area is great fun every night of the week, so make sure you stick around and enjoy the neighborhood (especially on the weekends because you won’t find a parking place ‘till after 11 if you give yours up).    For a family of 5, there was plenty of space and even Parcheesi, fresh bread and fruit, fully stocked kitchen, friendly host and washer/dryer.  The only words of caution are it’s not for small kids (not safety proofed) and not for fastidious folks (bring your own sheets and wash clothes if you are used to the Ritz).  "
637710,7037282,2013-09-04,1578803,Jessica,"I love this neighborhood! From arcade bars to great food (Paseo, OMG. Tip: call your order in) to vintage shops to the THEO CHOCOLATE FACTORY, I loved our stay at Roots! My friends and I referred to the trip as ""glamping in the city"" because the house had that rustic cabin feel. 

However, in terms of transportation, I didn't feel it was that close to things (but perhaps that's because Seattle is so huge!). Luckily, we rented a car and had no problem but I can see that being an issue for others. "
637710,8058139,2013-10-14,2312710,Laurie,"We had a great stay.  Farhad left some fruit, bread and wine for us which was a really nice touch.  The place was spacious, clean and in a really fun area of Seattle."
637710,9239131,2013-12-16,3551193,Katie,"Farhad's house in Fremont was the perfect place to house my friends for a surprise birthday party for my partner! It's in a super cool area, tucked away between industrial buildings. If this house had a persona in high school, it would be the party guy. I would recommend this place for large groups and people who just want to hang out and party in a neat neighborhood. Not so much for couples or those with kids. 
I'm told the beds were very comfortable, and on Sunday morning we walked over to Theo chocolate and then to the Fremont Market. Totally walkable, totally fun. Thanks Farhad!"
637710,9730189,2014-01-06,10969737,Ian,I couldn't ask for a better host and a better pale to stay!!
637710,10276197,2014-02-10,3587578,Joe,"This is a great, albeit rustic, spot in one of the coolest neighborhoods in town.  The owner is easy to work with and an all around good guy.  This spot is a great choice for bands or any other large group that requires multiple beds and space to hang out.  "
637710,11804111,2014-04-15,349064,Lachlan,"Farhad’s Roots at the Centre of the (Seattle) Universe was perfect for our 6-person group. He was flexible and responded quickly to any of our pre-arrival questions, and once there he gave us the hot tips for the surrounding restaurants, markets and bars.

The house itself had everything we needed — great kitchen, towels, Parcheesi, washing machine, good beds — and a  great sound system. It’s a warm and comfortable space to hang out in with easy access to downtown, and the University area via public transport. 

A nice stroll down the nearby canal leads to the Sunday morning markets, packed full of good Seattle produce and trinkets. Thanks Farhad, there’s a piece of Seattle in all of us."
637710,13259105,2014-05-23,6047319,Sarah,Farhad was a great and generous host. I highly recommend his place. The location is also excellent.
637710,13571386,2014-05-31,14381899,Andrew,Farhad was a great host.  He even let us check in early!  The neighborhood is excellent for going out and walking places.  
637710,15638671,2014-07-13,16295722,Margo,This house was great! Farhad always got back to me quickly and even left nice fruits and local breads for us when we arrived. The location of this house cannot be beat: walking distance to all sorts of cafes and bars and a nice river walk. Really awesome place to stay if you are in Seattle! 
637710,15675474,2014-07-14,6169476,Katie,"Six of us stayed at Farhad's this weekend for a bachelorette and there are definitely pro's and con's. 

The house is exactly as pictured. It's not a fancy hotel, so don't expect that, but it's big, comfy, and in the best location. Tons of bars/restaurants in walking distance, and the casual atmosphere was great for a party. 

While Farhad was easy to communicate with, he definitely seemed a little disorganized and I had to remind him multiple times of our check-in date. Even after establishing 1pm as the check-in time, a few weeks later he didn't remember and wanted to move it to 1:30. Not a huge deal, but when I arrived the woman cleaning the home was still there and didn't leave until about 3:30. Not a huge deal because she was very friendly, but it definitely cut into a few hours of our stay which wasn't ideal. 

We were also supposed to have until 4pm to check out, but on the day of our reservation Farhad emailed me to say he forgot there was another group arriving that night and would need more time to be able to clean before they arrived, and wanted to know if we could leave early. Not being able to have the house on time and then being asked to leave early was not a great combo for making a positive experience. 

The only issue with the house was ants... in the morning we woke up to find ants all over the kitchen and bathroom. It's an easily fixed problem though so hopefully that's taken care of for the next guests. "
637710,15971649,2014-07-19,2905847,Brittney,"Farhad was an excellent host. And his place was absolutely perfect! A group of six of us had to be in Seattle for a work trip and his place was incredibly comfortable. A couple people mentioned that they usually have trouble falling asleep in new situations, but that was not the case during this trip. Farhad was also instantly available when we accidentally locked ourselves out one night. We had a great time staying in Seattle (particularly in Fremont) and this place definitely helped with that."
637710,16075898,2014-07-22,2759063,Jeffrey,"The hosts was responsive and quick to answer all of our questions. He made an extra effort at a quick turnaround so that we could get into the house a bit early. The house was exactly as described and in a terrific walkable part of Seattle. Funky and fun. The house is in a very quiet spot directly across from a park and bicycle trail. There is a bike rental shop one block to the east. Overall, we were satisfied--and especially pleased that the host provided a means to recycle and compost. "
637710,16631334,2014-07-30,12086226,Valeri,"Farhad was a thoughtful and accommodating host. The place itself had a comfy vibe, but for the money I expected something nicer. Although clean, this felt like a party house where I lived in college. We also met with an unfortunate experience our first morning: during the night, a mini mountain of ants had deposited their eggs on a bookshelf in the room where our baby slept.  It was fascinating and disgusting. Farhad immediately offered to get an exterminator, but I didn't want to expose the baby to poisons.  Not ideal. (Though after cleaning them up, the ants didn't come back en masse). 

We still enjoyed our stay. And the location was perfect--we loved being right across from the canal.

I think there are nicer places on AirBnB for less money. We waited a little too long to book anything. In a pinch, we'd probably stay there again."
637710,16778782,2014-08-02,13188401,Samit,"good location, perfect place for the weekend that was planned."
637710,17123011,2014-08-07,13045575,Kenneth,"Clean only by the standards of a party or frat house. Kitchen filthy. Sugar ants everywhere - kitchen, bathroom, bedrooms. This apparently is an ongoing problem. We were advised to keep all food in fridge or plastic bags. We felt it necessary to wash everything in the kitchen before using it.

Small, low power microwave. Tea kettle and French press, but no coffee maker. Although described as a ""fully equipped"" kitchen, few pots and pans, and most of those in really bad shape (heavy burned on crust in one pan, for example).

No air conditioning + no screens on windows = mosquitoes. Not enough fans for each bedroom.

Exposed wiring and fire hazards. Wires taped together with electrical tape. Hard to find light switches. Fan missing grille, so blades exposed. Holes in walls, rotten / broken woodwork, bathtub disintegrating.

Street parking very difficult during business hours. Didn't tell us about parking issues until the day before we arrived. Some of us had to pay to park.

Only house on block, in between tall concrete walls in industrial neighborhood. 

Two wash cloths for four people to share. No kitchen linens. When we asked for wash cloths and kitchen linens, got brief answers on text messages that basically said 'sorry"" and use paper towels. But then the next day, he dropped off washcloths and linens and mentioned ""I just got back in town."" Why didn't he just tell us he was out of town and would bring something the next day? We went out and bought some.

Asked us to check out early - apparently based on other reviews, that's a pattern. Asked if it would be okay for his band to practice in the basement, but when we requested quiet, he replied no problem.

Odd seating in living room (one full size futon, one easy chair, two office chairs, a padded bench). Not enough chairs in kitchen. Odd assortment of chairs, one very rickety. Downstairs bedroom has one standard twin bed and another that is very high--would need a small stepstool to get into it. One upstairs bedroom has two twins. The other has a full bed with a nice mattress and a twin bed. 

This is clearly a ""party house."" Overall, this place would be best for a group of friends not planning on doing much cooking and not concerned with cleanliness. Definitely not suitable for children. Stairs have no railing, floors filthy, lots of evidence of marijuana (yes, we know it's legal in Washington, but some families might prefer not to be confronted with it in every room).

On the plus side, it was right on the Burke-Gilman Trail and just a couple of blocks from the heart of Fremont. Host dropped by some organic strawberries and plums, Cheerios, and blackberry honey the second day. We were happy to have recycling and composting available."
637710,17243206,2014-08-09,19169795,Jeff,House worked just as planned. Needed a spot for extra friends to stay at during my wedding. Great location and plenty of space. 
637710,17347400,2014-08-11,16354635,James,"Farhad was very accommodating, allowing my group to check in several hours early.  We ended up hanging out a bit while his band played on our second night at the house.  All the guys were very friendly and welcoming and a great time was had by all.

The house was very clean and comfortable.  Wi-Fi was easy to connect to and we had no complaints about the entire experience.  Would absolutely book a reservation with Farhad again."
637710,18129220,2014-08-22,5772900,Tongji Philip,"This place is fantastic--although it is a bus ride from downtown, it has everything you need nearby. I traveled to Farhad's place with my parents, and we really enjoyed the spacious place and the zen garden, as my father named it. Fremont is a really cool area and we did not see that many tourists. All in all, it is a great place for groups of various sizes."
637710,18470442,2014-08-27,850133,Angelique,Our stay at Roots was perfect. The place / location / everything was great. We didn't get to meet Farhad but we did meet his lovely girlfriend Emily who was very sweet & welcoming. She gave us some really nice bread and the fridge had drinks for us all. We would not hesitate to stay there again next time we are in Seattle.
637710,19127505,2014-09-07,17792172,Juan,"Great place to stay in, perfect location. Belgian restaurant down the street was delicious, we had a lot of fun at the arcade nearby as well. Accommodations were comfortable, it was nice to have a back yard to hang out at. Stayed there with a group of guys and the location was great for turning up the stereo a bit without bothering any neighbors."
637710,19841164,2014-09-19,16928444,Micheal,"I rented Roots for 2 weeks and it has been amazing. There were many attraction nearby and transportation is very easy to access. Farhad has been really kind and always text ahead of time before he drops by to pick some of his band stuff. One of my favorite things is his backyard, where it's really chill and comfortable. "
637710,19998622,2014-09-22,13503793,Amy,"This house was the PERFECT location for the Fremont Oktoberfest. Unfortunately, that was the only perfect thing about it. This was more like a party house than anything and definitely NOT family friendly. My son (who is 24) loved it but the rest of us were not so pleased. Farhad was gracious and checked on me several times. I appreciated that very much. I would not stay there again, but I would recommend this place for anyone going to the Oktoberfest that does not have small children because of its location."
637710,28707460,2015-03-29,27076927,Wenyan,"Farhad was a very welcoming and hospitable host. This place was stocked with some kitchen essentials (good coffee, tea, milk, cereals, a bottle of wine, etc.) and the kitchen was well equipped with pots, pans and dishes. We felt at home at this place and Farhad was great about telling us about the best activities and food in the area. He asked us if his band could practice one night and we had no problem with it, they were really good! We highly recommend staying at this place if you want to be in the center of an awesome neighborhood and don't have unreasonable expectations."
637710,31208484,2015-05-03,30416243,Luann,The reservation was canceled 45 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
637710,34518773,2015-06-09,11633844,Ryan,"Awesome house, awesome location, once in a lifetime experience. Farhad made sure we had everything we needed, and everything we wanted was just a block or two away. Highly recommended. "
637710,36522736,2015-06-29,18584041,Tanya,The house was everything we needed.  We brought a steamer but I saw that there was a brand new iron available to use. We did not cook at all...we went to one of the Thai restaurant recommendations and it was delicious. The house was in the perfect location for the rehearsal dinner at The Red Door and the wedding at the Foundry. Thank you!
637710,37076331,2015-07-04,35319023,Frank,Farhad is a very friendly cool cat. I felt at home in his place with my musician son.  The neighborhood has vibrant night life with many places to eat and have fun. Check-in was max easy.
637710,37296925,2015-07-06,30171953,Amy,"This house is amazing; Farhad is a wonderful, accommodating host! It's everything in the description, and yet so much more! We were celebrating a bachelorette party and everything that we could need or want to do is within a block of the house. There is, indeed, quite a nightlife in the neighborhood, but if you are a musician or a band touring locally, Roots in a dream location! The basement is completely set up to run through your set list, and the backyard is a PNW-lovers ideal chill spot! My friends and I will be returning to Roots as often as we can!"
637710,38645735,2015-07-17,37381514,Ronnachai,"Host is very nice. The house is very big, convenient to travel not far from the city. Also calm ,clean and ready to use. There are a lot of towels cleaning supplies Pillows are more than enough for seven people. Thanks again for the hospitality provided. I feel like being at home. 
"
637710,39905275,2015-07-27,28510816,Herman,"Farhad's place was a great place for us to host our out of town guests for our wedding weekend. I found our stay to be exactly what I expected from the pictures and description. We were able to sleep 7 people comfortably. We wish we would have had an extra day to maybe take advantage of that backyard, would have been nice to hang out back there in the shade and relax. But we were so busy we never got the chance.  I saw some reviews where people felt that it was more of a party house than a family vacation home, I'd say that's correct, but in our opinion that isn't a bad thing at all. It's sandwiched between 2 large buildings and therefor there is the opportunity to turn things up a bit, once again, we would have loved to have done that but we were too busy. I'd absolutely love to stay here the next time we have out of town guests because not only is the house fun and accommodating.. It's in Fremont! One of the greatest neighborhoods in Seattle and even if you aren't a fan of Fremont its centrally located and anywhere in the city is a quick bus ride away!"
637710,41924367,2015-08-10,27420616,Justin,"We rented the place for 1 week with 6 of my friends and what a week it was. The house is really private and you won't be disturbed. If you not quite sure because of the pictures, don't worry about that, the pictures don't do justice to how wonderful this place is. A lot of space, beds are comfy. Easy access to the city by bus. We had to go to the KeyArena each day which is pretty much at the center of the city and it was easy.

Farhad's a nice guy, made us feel right at home. Left us a list of places to go get food, beer, coffee and other stuff. I'd rent the place again without thinking about it. I almost wish I was still there at the moment actually!

Rent the place and spread the world that Farhad's place is the best place to stay in Seattle!"
637710,43509439,2015-08-20,19156125,Martin,"Many thanks to stay at the ""Center of the Universe"".
Farad is a very friendly and helpful host.
It was awesome to stay in a House witch is full of history.
One of the greatest neighborhoods in Seattle and even if you aren't a fan of Fremont its centrally located."

1150519,5581507,2013-07-07,6526379,Juha-Pekka,"Since this house has no reviews yet I want to share our experience!

We (our family, kids 5 & 8 years old) just had wonderful two weeks vacation in Sarah's and her husband's house. The house was exactly like in photos in a really nice old Ravenna neighborhood about 15 blocks north from University of Washingon. 

Sarah responded very fast to us and was really nice and helpful. She even invited us over to a glass of wine and tour of the house the day before we moved in as we were already in the Seattle area couple of days earlier. It was nice to go through all the practicalities of the house face to face and to meet the nice people who actually live in the house!

The house itself is a great old well renovated house. We especially appreciated the hardwood floors and the great kitchen. Instead of eating out all the time it was nice to just walk to Whole Foods (4 blocks away) and buy groceries and prepare food in the well-equipped kitchen or with char-coil or gas grill. Also the washing machine and dryer were useful for us. The house has three bedrooms + sofa-bed downstairs in the living room but in reality it is best suited for two couples or a family like ours. 

I think the only negative thing with the house was that during the rare Seattle summer heat wave (we had max 89 F) the upstairs of the house gets quite warm (especially if you forget to cover the roof windows in one morning) as the house is old and does not have air conditioning. We are used to this with our summer cottage in Finland but for someone who has lived his life in a/c house: Remember to cover roof windows with curtains in the morning, it helps a lot!

Our kids appreciated the fact that the house has a good entertainment center and a good Wi-Fi network where they could get their iPad games working. Also the neighborhood Cowen Park playfield (in Ravenna Park) was their favorite in addition to swimming in Green Lake (10 blocks). 

There is plenty of restaurants within walking distance, a good Whole Foods grocery store + regular Safeway nearby. Good upscale shopping mall University Village is 1 mile away and you can walk there via Ravenna park. The house has an easy access from I-5 and in good traffic conditions downtown Seattle is just 10 mins away by car if you are in a hurry. The bus line to downtown stops just one block away from the house  and takes about 15 mins. 

As a frequent runner, I appreciated the fact that the neighborhood is good and safe for running with good trails nearby (Green Lake park or Burke-Gilman via Ravenna park). And finally, since this was Seattle, the nearest coffee stand, Cowen Park Coffee, is just one block away and has really good coffee!"
1150519,6073031,2013-07-29,6761624,Dorothy,"I came to Seattle for a wedding with my sister and 3 children under 9.  This house worked out fantastically for us.  There are 2 bedrooms with queen size beds, and the baby's room, in which Sarah lent us a twin size air mattress.  We all slept comfortably upstairs.  I'm not exaggerating when I say that the master bed is one of the comfiest ones I have ever slept in!  The house is centrally located- we walked to the park, Whole Foods, and around the neighborhood.  Parking was right out front.  The kitchen is wonderful with lots of nice cooking equipment and fridge space. There is a great paver patio outside where we ate and the kids could play.  We felt right at home.  We had some family over a few nights and many of the out of towners were envious of our lovely abode.This was my first airbnb experience and I hope the next one lives up to this one.  Sarah is a great host and truly offers a wonderful place to stay.  I would do again next time!"
1150519,8716085,2013-11-13,9205793,Mark,"Instead of a standard ""review"" I've decided to write how I spent  just one of my days in the host's home to illustrate how perfect this place is:

On an unseasonably warm and dry Seattle October morning, I woke up next to my young son and found it hard to peel myself out of the ultra comfortable queen size bed. I snuck down the hardwood stairs of this craftsman home to find my wife cooking breakfast on the island range utilizing the provided cast iron cookware & plating my breakfast atop the granite counters in the gourmet kitchen.  With a presentation like that I skipped sitting in the full dining room & sat at an island stool.
  After breakfast my son was calling so I took him less than a 5 minute walk through the tree-lined neighborhood, to a local coffee shop. It was our 3rd day & the barista already knew my name & order which is a testament to how quaint this neighborhood is.  
  When arriving 'home' we walked up the flagstone walkway to be greeted by the eager recipient of the coffee. I pointed to the bottle of champagne thoughtfully gifted to us by the hosts & sitting on the coffee table stating ""that's being used tonight""! 
  After a chuckle, I walked upstairs where I took a shower in the  smartly tiled bathroom,  I reached up and opened the skylight above my head & just enjoyed the contrasting cool breeze while I took that hot shower. 
 I then had a bit of work on my laptop to do so I made my way into the 2nd bedroom that offers itself as an office. After a quick ""hi"" to the fish on the desk (never caught his name) after work-
  I gathered my son & walked half a block to a park that was magical, within minutes it seemed as if we were in the middle of the forest on some fun trails. I got back for a lunch with my wife and son at the Whole Foods market about 4 blocks from home.
  Once back, I decided to go to the basement & catch up on some laundry using the modern front-loading machines.
 During which, I played in the family room exploring all of the GREAT toys that our new friend left to share. 
 Finally, as evening began to approach, it was time for that quick 10 minute drive downtown to drop my son off to family.
  I rushed back & met my wife for that glass of bubbly which we shared in the candlelit living room. We sat and listened to some soft music enjoying the leather sofa & the acoustics the home provides with the high-end surround sound.
 My wife told me we were going to a quiet Italian restaurant that was just a block away.  It was quaint & delicious. We had a short romantic stroll back and the evening ended as the day began...comfortable & perfect- 

We will never forget this trip. "
1150519,17258358,2014-08-10,1994302,Gargee,"This home and its great hosts made for a terrific summer stay in Seattle: lovely decor, peaceful yard, walking distance to park and commercial, and even some inside tips on the best spots in the neighborhood.  Couldn't have asked for a better experience!"
1150519,18895030,2014-09-02,17271557,Harley,Our time in Seattle was great.  Sarah and her family's home was perfect for what we needed while we were there.  Their cute Craftsman was warm and inviting.  It had much more charm than staying in a cold hotel somewhere.  We even took advantage of going to some of the places Sarah suggested and really enjoyed the bookstore.  Staying here was a very enjoyable experience.
1150519,33250358,2015-05-26,11919262,Erin,"We had a comfortable stay in this beautiful craftsman home.  The neighborhood is very nice, parking was very easy, and the location allowed us to walk to many places.  It is a quick drive to downtown.  We kept the upstairs windows open while we slept since it gets a little warm upstairs in the summer.  The neighborhood is incredibly quiet, however I suspect it is under a flight path.  We heard a few planes at night, but it wasn't much of an issue.  It was a breeze communicating with Sarah - she is very friendly - during our stay and overall we enjoyed our time in her home. "
1150519,34938247,2015-06-14,28105618,Coleen,"Sarah as traveling during our stay so unfortuanly we were not able to meet her in person. However she immediately responded any time I had a question before, during and after our stay. The house and neighborhood are exactly as described! Their home is perfect! warm cozy, clean, and in a great location. Walking distance to a park, lake, grocery stores and the University of Washington. It was so nice to sit ou in the backyard in the morning and have coffee. The swing on the front porch was so relaxing and peaceful. The beds and furniture were all comfy! We had a wonderful, stay and hope we have the opportunity to experience another visit to Sarah's home In the future.
Thank you so much!!"
1150519,36781777,2015-07-01,21194832,Tory,We absolutely loved this house. It was exactly as advertised and felt homey and comfortable. We would absolutely stay here again. Thank you sarah!
1150519,39803184,2015-07-26,31185573,David,"We felt right at home, and the listing was perfectly accurate. "
1150519,55369188,2015-12-01,486337,Marley,"Our family of four stayed in Sarah's home for five days over the Thanksgiving holiday. The photos of the home do not do them justice. The craftsman home is adorable and nicely decorated. Seattle was very cold when we arrived and upon opening the door we were welcomed with a gust of warm air and a welcoming mini mud room. We got settled in pretty quickly and enjoyed our stay. Aside from the wonderful home, the location can't be beat. Our boys played at the playground across the street and there are plentiful restaurants and great grocery stores nearby such as PCC and Whole Foods. We hope to stay here again! "
4887845,55271415,2015-11-29,38343733,Bill,The host canceled this reservation 195 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
6403878,35348480,2015-06-17,23589718,Gustavo Borel,"List description is pretty accurate. Apartment is very nice and clean. Location is great, 5-minute walk to Market (one of main attractions of Seattle) with several restaurants. It is also only a 15-minute walk to convention center where I walked to during my stay. Communication and access to apartment was very straightforward. "
6403878,35510938,2015-06-19,5928575,Matt,The location is amazing right across from the aquarium on the water. The place is really nice and no clutter. There is a parking garage down the street a foot bridge and train tracks just outside. Great location.
6403878,35617108,2015-06-20,32367524,Lisa,Very nice location in downtown Seattle.  Clean. Comfortable bed.
6403878,35726815,2015-06-21,29418508,Razi,"The best thing about Cristian's place is its location, right next to Pike Place Market! Just a short walk and you're there. I also took public transportation from the airport which was easy enough and also a short walk from Seattle's rail system. His place was also very clean and simple, which was perfect."
6403878,38540575,2015-07-16,37355030,Abigail,"This apartment was spacious, yet cozy, with a lot of living space, yet the personal touches throughout the apartment made it feel like a much homier living space. The location is AWESOME: just a 10-minute walk from the ferry, and only about a half-hour's walk from the stadiums and other activities/entertainment.The apartment was very clean, and the building felt very accommodating and safe, I highly recommend this apartment."
6403878,38647522,2015-07-17,6965700,Alina,Place was very clean and was in a really great location steps from the market. 
6403878,39236599,2015-07-21,38458400,Amber,Fantastic location. Easy to walk everywhere. Very secure building. Clean and comfortable. 
6403878,40136778,2015-07-28,11176846,Vanessa,"The apartment itself was fine (once we got in). The waterfront is steps from the apartment and wonderful to walk around at any point during the day! The apartment was clean and simple. There was a train at night  (Sunday) however, that passed multiple times starting around 2am. The tracks are directly behind the building so it's quite loud. The set up to retrieve and drop off keys was a bit of a hassle with luggage since it's a 13 minute walk from the apartment. Not sure why they can't find a location next door for that. It doesn't seem as though anyone lives in this apartment other than Air BnB guests so there's not a personal contact, just two 3rd party applications that help you navigate any obstacles like we had - keys weren't dropped off by prior guest, cleaning team was late to apartment. It all worked out though and we are happy we had an apartment so close to everything - Pike Place, Belltown, Piers etc. Thanks! "
6403878,41412417,2015-08-07,7900532,Jamie,"My husband and I had an excellent experience staying in Cristian's apartment for 2 nights. The building is in a perfect location: easy walking distance to waterfront attractions, downtown restaurants/bars, and Pikes Place market. We were able to see and do a lot without a car. There are cabs readily available 24/7 directly outside of the apartment as it is right next door to a Marriott. The apartment itself is clean and the bed is really comfortable. There is a train that runs directly behind the building several times a day, but you really can't hear it when the doors and windows are closed (it didn't bother us). It was abnormally hot the days we were there and the fans provided really helped make it comfortable. I would definitely recommend Cristian's place for couples or friends; it is a nice, quiet place so probably not for partiers! "
6403878,42402754,2015-08-13,142404,Christian,"We rented Cristian's apartment at the last minute as our previous airbnb host in Seattle had cancelled, so it was above our planned budget and standards. The apartment was  clean, bright, spotless, and looked brand new. The kitchen was functional for standard cooking (but I could not make my famous chocolate mousse!) and having washer and drier on the premises was a big plus. The only main issue we had with the place is that it is very noisy, due to a major freight line driving right behind the building at all hours of day and night. As it happened to be a very warm week in Seattle, we started by leaving the windows open, which made sleeping close to impossible. Later we closed those windows at night, but were still awaken periodically by the big freight trains, resulting in an exhausting stay in Seattle."
6403878,43068266,2015-08-17,37096190,Sophie,"Cons: Elevator is hard to find. The apartment is right next to a rail road so it's kinda noisy when the train goes by.
Pros: Overall, we had good experience. The apartment is clean and neat with great location to many attractions withing walking distance.  
Would recommend this place for any one to visit Seattle. "
6403878,44139136,2015-08-24,4755413,Cheryl,"Great location -- just a short walk from Pike's Market. Very clean and comfortable. Getting the key from the ""key cafe"" was a bit of a hassle, but overall a great, affordable choice for a stay in Seattle."
6403878,44431279,2015-08-26,34070865,Jen,"The space was very comfortable and in a beautiful location, right across from the water. Cristian was very helpful, answering any questions we had right away. 

It's a very close walk (with some steep uphill parts) to Pike Place and Belltown. We enjoy walking and had a quick walk to the Space Needle & EMP Museum, as well. There's a lot to do and see within just a few minutes from the place. 

Something to note- there is a train that goes by right next to the building. It's loud when the windows are open, but with all sets closed, it's more manageable.  

The keys are picked up at another location about 10 minutes away, so walking with suitcases would be a little bit difficult. Uber or cabs are great around there."
6403878,45384383,2015-09-02,36084151,Ronan,Great location for pike market. Really clean and spacious but a train goes by and it's quite loud. If you're visiting downtown definitely check this place out.
6403878,45560810,2015-09-04,126958,Kevin,Great time in Seattle. KeyCafe didn't function the way that one would expect. Key was with apartment cleaners. Had to get an additional taxi and meet cleaners for Key. Loved the location. Apartment was comfortable and perfect for our needs. Had a terrific time. 
6403878,46133840,2015-09-08,37188967,Arianne,"Great stay. Christian was very easy to work with and promptly responded to all my questions.  The apartment was clean and had great amenities such as the full kitchen and utensils to cook with. It was really close to Pike Place Market and the piers as well! The only downside was the train that runs right behind the complex. It did wake me and my husband up a few times because we slept with the windows open. I would stay here again when I visit Seattle next time!

"
6403878,46404073,2015-09-10,21796096,Terry,"The use of Pillow as an intermediary totally soured me on this property, and it made me think about whether I would ever use ABNB again. The check in was ridiculously cumbersome. I had to walk five blocks after I got the key. Pillow gave me three different passcodes to the lock box. Although the customer service people tried to help, they were 600 miles away. I will NEVER stay in a Pillow property again."
6403878,47254339,2015-09-17,15945666,Jo,"A great place to stay in Seattle - location was absolutely perfect to explore Seattle, I don't think you could get any better than this. Walkable to so many attractions and so much great food. Cristian's apartment was really spacious and was a very comfortable base for me during my stay."
6403878,47470678,2015-09-19,17570445,Jordan,"I would say this experience was just ok.  I've stayed at quite a few Airbnbs and this was the most cumbersome.  

Pros:  GREAT location.  Walking distance to everything!

Cons:  Apt was a little dirty.  The backs of the bathroom doors were filthy with dirty fingerprints and there was something splattered on the sides of the kitchen sink

-A bunch of the windows in the apt were broken, so you couldn't open them.  Despite Seattle's cool weather, Christian's apt gets very stuffy. 

-You have to pick up and return the key at a separate location and it's just weird and ghetto.  It's in a random lock box on a building 4 blocks away. Not convenient in the pouring rain. 

-Check in and check out were totally inflexible. 

-The bed was made in a very weird way.  There was no fitted sheets.  It went mattress, flat sheet, pillow topper, flat sheet, comforter...flat sheet.  The bed was lumpy and uncomfortable

-When we booked, the place listed ""hot tub"" in the amenities...but we couldn't get into it.  When I asked the management company about it, they said the property had no hot tub and removed it from the amenities list.  

Overall, you kind of get what you pay for.  We tried to spend very little time in the room but probably won't return even if we're in Seattle again."
6403878,48067683,2015-09-23,6470812,Christopher,"Aside from the scavenger hunt to secure the the key to the condo and the occasional noisy train, Christian's place was perfect. Great location!! Within walking distance to Pike Place, Space Needle, EMP museum, aquarium and Tula's jazz club. Christian was very responsive. It was nice to have a washer and dryer in the unit, as my visit to Seattle was day 6 of my trip. I hope his place is available during my next visit to Seattle."
6403878,48528954,2015-09-27,1997206,Jacqueline,Cristian was very responsive to emails and the location is unbeatable! Apartment was easy to find although we did have to get the key from a separate location with our luggage as well as dropping it off after the stay. Overall great stay and time in Seattle!
6403878,49227432,2015-10-02,41668373,Jay,"This condo is very well situated - adjacent to an elevator which makes the walk to Pike Place Market much easier - yet fronts on the Alaskan Way road which takes you to all the waterfront attractions.  You really don't need to rent a car if you stay here.
The condo is spacious and adequately furnished - the kitchen and dining area is perfect for bringing in fresh food from the market and cooking it up!
My host was very accommodating and patiently explained how to retrieve the key for the condo which really isn't that far away - if you are planning to walk much.
Best accommodations I've had while in Seattle!!"
6403878,50660702,2015-10-13,44015831,Bruce,"Christians home is all about location. It was literally 5-15 minutes  walking to the places and restaurants we wanted to visit. The elevator at the front door was a god send allowing us to get to Pike Market without climbing hills or stairs.

Overall the condo was clean and provided us with all of our basis needs.

5213468,27820929,2015-03-12,15041199,Travis,Another amazing stay! Really love it here.
5213468,28034734,2015-03-16,13907898,Eugenio,"The units has amazing views (even better than in the pictures!) and it is in a convenient location.  Besides that, Eve is a great host.  She was very informative through the booking process, and she even left me a bottle of wine as a welcome gift!  "
5213468,28193804,2015-03-19,15041199,Travis,"Perfect, as usual!"
5213468,28580236,2015-03-26,15041199,Travis,Another perfect stay!

The amenities were great and Eve did an excellent job of providing all the info we needed.  I wholeheartedly recommend this rental!"
5213468,30080701,2015-04-17,6929464,Catherine,"Awesome apartment in an adorable spot with all the details you didn't realize you needed (umbrella, washer/dryer, roof access). When I'm back in Seattle, I'll be staying at one of Eve's places. "
5213468,30242849,2015-04-19,8661583,Rudi,"My first visit to Seattle and we loved the place! Walkable to both pike market and space needle area (and Uber when we didn't feel like it :) ). Great view, looks right on space needle. We also got full privacy: place was ready for us, and hosts were always easy to reach."
5213468,30790809,2015-04-27,29846520,Lisa Marie,"As I was getting situated with my flight and hotel reservations, a coworker mentioned ""why don't you just Air BnB it?!"" I've never used Air BnB ever in my life, but I decided to give it a look. I originally booked another one of Eve & Michael's Apartments, but the morning of my flight they offered a complimentary upgrade to a more spacious & modern apartment. I have no idea what the previous apartment was like, but this one was nothing short of AMAZING.  Eve had a prior engagement when I was scheduled to arrive, however she explained exactly how to get in to the apartment.  She accommodated my early arrival, which I feel most people wouldn't do for you.  Upon arrival I walked in to a stunning view of the space needle, along with a bottle of wine, granola bars, and some chocolate. Sweet touch! The apartment was SO cozy that I didn't even want to leave to explore the city!  Everything is as described in the apartment, and mostly everything touristy is within walking distance.  Eve has been so attentive to my questions and concerns. When I come back to Seattle, I will definitely be staying with Eve and Michael. Thanks so much for your hospitality!! "
5213468,32515447,2015-05-19,27248421,Liz,"This apartment is very nice. A perfect location near the Pike Place Market. Eve was really nice to arrange our check-in with us because we arrived in Seattle pretty late at night. Overall, I will definitely recommend this place to my friends in the future:)))"
5213468,32891951,2015-05-23,22498508,Evelien,"The apartment is in a great location. Most of downtown walkable. Beautiful views from the apartment. Beds are very comfortable, bathroom large, livingroom very nice. Two big screen tv's, no cable but plenty of other options (apple tv and roku). Host Eve very quick in responses and very pleasant to deal with."
5213468,33360833,2015-05-27,29106772,Rebecca,"This was my first Airbnb experience, and it could not have gone better! Eve was kind enough to accommodate an early check-in for us, and then worked with us when our flight ended up being delayed. She even checked in with us during our stay to ensure everything was going well. The apartment is in a wonderful location, only a short walk to Pike Place Market and downtown. The apartment is just like the pictures, modern yet comfortable with gorgeous views. I will definitely try to stay with Eve again if I return to Seattle. "
5213468,33786731,2015-06-01,29868630,Michael,"The place was great. Real modern and clean. It was nice to have a washer dryer in the place and entry into the building was very secure. Perfect location, just a block or so from the action: Pike's Market, Aquarium, Seattle Art Museum, ferry, shops, bars, and restaurants. The only drawback was the air conditioning. It was a hot weekend and not very strong a/c. The rooftop patio was a treat too. Our host was gracious enough to let us store our baggage for a few hours after checkout while we toured the market,waiting for a late flight. The bottle of wine was a nice touch too."
5213468,34748570,2015-06-11,15450012,Vitali,An absolute 5-star stay for me in Seattle at Eve & Mike's place. Thank you Eve for coordinating everything - and for the small but thoughtful welcome gift :) It's these little things that made my stay amazing.
5213468,34977525,2015-06-14,19572290,Meera,"My friend and I stayed at Eve's place for the Seattle marathon, and to have some fun in the city.

The apartment was great-- very clean and great amenities.  The location was perfect-- centrally located and near lots of fun restaurants, bars, and the water.

Eve was super helpful and responsive.

I would definitely come back and we thoroughly enjoyed our stay!"
5213468,35213231,2015-06-16,1653621,John,"Got an early check-in of 1PM. Apartment was immaculate clean, new, all the basic necessities, including wine and beer! Perfect central location. Expensive but cheaper than the equivalent hotel suite. Free parking on street at night, and $12 early-bird all-day parking at the nearest lot one block away. Recommended. "
5213468,35916235,2015-06-23,29959899,Jonathan,Excellent location near everything Seattle has to offer. Loved the place and views! Responsive owners. Pictures don't do justice to the views!
5213468,36218720,2015-06-26,35506411,Jay,Great first experience with Airbnb.  Eve & Michael made sure things were set for my stay and everything was as advertised.
5213468,36574963,2015-06-29,16096084,Jb,"We originally booked to stay at https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/3380159, but once we arrived we were stunned by the heat in the apartment. Eve assured us that she JUST turned on the air-conditioning units and that it would cool off. It was unbelievably hot in Seattle that weekend and after an hour, the place was still sweltering. We called Eve to let her know we would have to move to a hotel. We were so disappointed because the ad stated air-conditioning, not window units! Eve promptly sprang into action and to our surprise, MOVED US to a nicer unit with central air! They have 29 units, so I guess this was not that difficult, however, we were extremely pleasantly surprised! The new unit was amazing, perfect in every single way! It was not the original location we desired, but we quickly fell in love with the area and walked our tails off. Best sushi we have ever had was Japonessa- must try if you stay in Seattle. Overall, I highly recommend staying with Eve and Michael as Eve is the absolute master at customer service and ensuring you have a 5 star experience. Although it was a rough start to our first air b & b experience, we left extremely happy and totally satisfied!"
5213468,37331047,2015-07-06,15490110,Thomas,"In midst of heatwave in Seattle, Eve and Michael were able to quickly shift gears and change our reservation to an air conditioned unit, albeit at higher but discounted rate. The unit was incredibly nice w views of Puget Sound.  Location great w restaurants, bars, etc proximate."
5213468,37768874,2015-07-10,20229160,Karen,"Fantastic communication and attention to detail. I loved this property and the thoughtfulness that went into the many details to make this a comfortable while still being very close to many of Seattle's best restaurants and attractions. When we come back, we'll be staying with Eve again. "
5213468,38655444,2015-07-17,4346130,Shannon,As promised this is a fabulous apartment in an awesome building with a beautiful view. Eve was also a great host for visiting Seattle! 
5213468,39799638,2015-07-26,31268988,Daniella,"From the very beginning when I started communicating with Eve about the apartment and neighborhood, I knew my stay was going to be great! Eve was responsive up until the day of check-out making it known she was available for inquires and making sure my stay was comfortable. The apartment is exactly as advertised and so is the location. I highly recommend this place and Eve as a host! "
5213468,40496150,2015-07-31,37202527,Gwen,"We had a great experience staying in Eve's apartment.  The location is perfect and the apartment is roomy, comfortable, and well appointed.  The views are great.  The bed is very comfortable!  Eve was flexible with our check in and made the process very easy.  There was detailed information that made it easy to navigate the area.  I'd highly recommend this property."
5213468,41281530,2015-08-05,39986291,Anmol,Great host and a great place!
5213468,45096901,2015-08-31,37740935,Zak,"Morgan was extremely friendly and helpful, we couldn't have asked for a better host. The apartment was amazing. It was well furnished and had fantastic views of the city. This was my first time using Airbnb and if this experience is indicative I don't see a reason to ever use a hotel again. "
5213468,47856039,2015-09-21,22050241,Sarah,"We had a wonderful stay at this location and Daniela was extremely responsive and helpful. She got back to me almost immediately with any questions and concerns we had. The unit itself is amazing. The views are absolutely incredible...they have to be some of the best in the city! The bed was comfortable for two people and overall, apartment well appointed with what we needed. Stylish and modern design and building. Very quick walk to Pike's Place Market, walking distance to anything you could want downtown. HIGHLY RECOMMEND! Thank you, Daniela. We will be back!"
5213468,52085437,2015-10-26,7782715,Rylan,The location and apartment was perfect! The view really can't be beat and we were close to everything.  Daniela was nice and accommodating to our needs.  I would recommend this place to anyone visiting Seattle that is looking for a unique and amazing experience. 
5213468,54011374,2015-11-15,2197793,Michael,"My stay was great!  The apartment was in a great neighborhood and building, was very clean and comfortable and had an amazing view.  Jocelyn made everything easy with extremely clear instructions and was very flexible when I had a last minute request.  Would highly recommend this listing to anyone."
5213468,55525068,2015-12-01,49702242,Tina,"This was our first booking with Airbnb and couldn't be more pleased!  We decided at the Last minute to book a vacation to Seattle to simply be tourists.  Booking was instant and very easy.  We worked with Michael and he immediately answered any and all  questions we had, even on Thanksgiving day! Michael gave us an extensive list of restaurants all within walking distance and all highly reviewed.   We Absolutely loved the apartment and it's clean modern decor.  The view was Beyond Spectacular from  both the living area and the bedroom.  Additionally there is a rooftop common area with even better views! Both indoor and outdoor spaces have a cool, contemporary decor.   The kitchen in the apt. is stocked with the essentials for cooking and dining for 2-4 ppl.  It's only a couple of blocks to Walk to Pike Place to shop and prepare our own fresh meals and dine with the most spectacular VIEW!  There were a few essentials missing; ironing board, hairdryer, extra blankets etc.  I messaged Michael that we could live without them for this trip, but should be there for the next guests.  We were out at the time I messaged, and when we returned every single item I had listed was waiting for us at the front door along with a bottle of wine!  The Location was perfect for us, It's a nice walk to the EMP Museum at the Seattle Center and all it has to offer.  We rented bikes and rode to a tailgate party near Century Link and Safeco Fields (though it's a walkable distance).  With the bikes we rode to Freemont, Gasworks Park and the Ballard Locks.  Took the Ferry to Bainbridge Island where you can easily ride around the island (note easy walk to Seattle Ferry dock and once on Bainbridge 2 block walk up to town to shop and dine for the day - no bikes necessary) We rode along the Elliot Bay Bike Trail North, and South around to West Seattle (or you can take the West Seattle Water Taxi for a spectacular view of the city - and some nice eateries and a beach.  With bikes  we could ride to the Fauntleroy Ferry and to Vashon Island as well.  LOVE THIS CITY and this apt. with it's Views made it  one of the best vacations we have ever had - we will definitely be back!
Thank you Michael etal."

931154,10564489,2014-02-25,10114126,Joey,"This is my first time booking an accommodation via AirBNB and the experience was fantastic! Jordan's reply was fast and all instructions and information were clear. No hassle checking in at all! As we reached way before the checkin time, the helpful and friendly concierge staffs helped us looked after out luggages and we can go out for out lunch. The amenities of the apartment was awesome too! And most of all, a very spacious, clean, comfy and you-name-it-we-have-it facilities and toiletries apartment. Last but not least, a very friendly security guard too! A overall superb experience! "
931154,11486204,2014-04-05,12212969,Clay,"This place was Awesome.  clean, well kept, close to everything.  nice price and customer service was impeccable.  Will definitely be using this service again.  "
931154,12563466,2014-05-05,1846590,Lawrence,"I have been to Seattle a few times but this is the first time renting a place from Airbnb's website. When I saw the pictures of the location, I fell in love with it! We had a group of 6 so needed a big place with at least 2 bathrooms. This was the place.
When we arrived, only then did I realize what a great location it was! Just 5 minutes walk to the nearest shopping centers and food areas. The rooms were just like the pictures, the facilities were as described. Good thing is the security is good as well!
If you decide to rent a car, there is parking included!
I had requested for early check-in but arrived much earlier than I expected but I was still allowed to check in. It had been an enjoyable stay and I would be sure to rent again if I have the opportunity in the future."
931154,12861213,2014-05-12,4137629,New,"Great location, great building, great apartment. The apartment was spotless, welcoming. We were 5-10 min walk from Pike place and the restaurant at the foot of the building (italian) was amazing! Definitely would recommend this as a great place to stay. "
931154,13467395,2014-05-28,8290694,Anne,thanks to stay alfred we had a great time in Seattle. nothing beats the location and the view of the apartment! i can only recommend staying in one of the many apartments they offer. 
931154,14775989,2014-06-26,14086029,Joshua,"Jordan's condo in the Met Tower was the perfect place for my family to stay while visiting Seattle. The location is superb for hitting all of the major tourist attractions, from walking to Pike's Place Market and the Space Needle, to hopping on the light rail to catch the Red Sox & Mariners games. The condo has a phenomenal view with thoughtful amenities, and it's a beautiful experience to enjoy the Seattle skyline before walking downtowns for a glass of wine in one of the best restaurants in town, Barolo. Hands down the perfect place to experience downtown Seattle whether it's your first visit or one of many. Thank you again, Jordan."
931154,15626144,2014-07-13,5803066,Todd,The place was very clean and organized.  Close to many places Seattle has to offer.  I would stay there again.
931154,16312601,2014-07-25,17638212,W,"We had a great time. Everything was exactly as described. Check-in and out was easy. Walking distance for us to key sights - Pike Place Market, Space Needle, Waterfront. Garage was great, since we had a rental to stow somewhere."
931154,17152835,2014-08-08,16263523,Gaina,"Very clean and nice condo unit next to everything. We were a party of 6, 5 adults and 1 child and enjoyed being close to all the attractions. Everything was close by and within walking distance. Check in was really easy and fast. Jordan was very helpful and responded quickly to my questions. "
931154,22645296,2014-11-11,20477232,Delynn,"First impressions with the concierge was excellent, very well organized and felt like they were expecting us.  Very smooth check in process.
The condo was a pleasant surprise, good layout for the bedrooms, had an open view and a peak even at the water.  Great area, walking distance to everything.
Good amenities, gym was much bigger than I would have thought for a condo complex.
Would definitely book again and recommend to others."
931154,26618284,2015-02-16,3149059,Adam,Great experience. Very easy and everything was well organized and simple. The location was perfect - easy access to all of the city.
931154,30289577,2015-04-20,9146664,John,The apartment was clean and new. My colleague and I were attending a conference at the convention center and shared the unit. We were exactly midway between the conference center and Pikes Market area where many of the great restaurants are. This was my 3rd conference in Seattle and the best location so far. Slight issue with heat in bedrooms on the first night but resolved in early morning. Check in was easy and communication prior to arrival was good. This unit would be perfect for a large family or an extended stay as well. 
931154,31649938,2015-05-08,30418627,Milo,"I stayed here with 5 other people, and this apartment was perfect for us. There was an extra pull out bed, so all 6 people could sleep comfortably. The kitchen had everything we needed.

The location was very convenient. It's close to Pike Place, and it was a short walk to the glass museum and Space Needle."
931154,31926704,2015-05-11,24640127,Andrew,"Loved the balcony - could pop out easily and enjoy the beautiful cool weather. Easy access to pool two floors below. Hot tub, sauna and brand spankin new gym were also a nice touch. Beautiful outdoor common area with access to grills and tables is really well done.

The actual apartment is simple. Plenty of room for 4 people to hardly notice each other and never get in the other couple's space. Nice touch to include a little basket with tea, coffee and snacks. We used that up!

Neighborhood is easily walkable to Pike's Market. We walked everywhere and later on in the trip used Uber and Lyft to take quick $5 trips to all the tourist spots.

no complaints from this group! "
931154,32139928,2015-05-14,32597090,Gary,Nice place. All info accurate.
931154,32538229,2015-05-19,25645380,Andrea,Great place! Easily within walking distance of sites. Clean and well equipped. 
931154,34626588,2015-06-10,28936616,Monica,"Listing was accurate. 6 of us stayed and were able to fit comfortably. Responses to inquiries were quick. Walking distance to convention center, other activities and restaurants. Concierge was very helpful. "
931154,34931704,2015-06-14,17894603,Ashley,"Place was clean and great. This was our first experience with Airbnb and it was a good one. I was in town with my husband and parents so we wanted 2bd/2ba and it was cheaper than us booking with a hotel. Checking in and out was easy. There were some minor issues with the price upfront and it ended up costing more than anticipated when originally booked, but that didn't detract from our experience. Jordan and stay alfred were very responsive to our questions and needs. Thanks for a great trip. I would definitely stay here again."
931154,44463082,2015-08-26,26486682,Yuyang,"All in all, the apartment is satisfactory. The location is super good, downtown close to many restaurants, stores. During the stay, the host was responsive to my (website hidden)'s a good place to stay in downtown area."
931154,53151213,2015-11-05,1109327,Ken,"Liked the apartment, liked the area/location, and loved the view. Overall, very nice. That said...getting into the place was a bit overdone. I've stayed at AirBnB's all over the world, and never had a setup like this: extra contracts to sign, 15 pages of Rules/Reg's to read, and way too much other stuff. They even wanted me to download their App, to get even more stuff. A hotel would have been easier.

I get they are trying to run a 'company within a company'...but this was ridiculous. "
6349598,39706590,2015-07-25,23696693,Alec,A simple Seattle weekend trip without any problems.  Thanks!
6349598,40669269,2015-08-01,24951604,David,"Turnkey operation.  Haley showed up timely to let me in an give a tour.  Fresh towel hot shower internet connection, everything I needed. Clean. "
6349598,41830259,2015-08-09,9730052,Jarrett,"Haley was responsive and accommodating. Check in and check out were simple and straightforward. She left detailed information about the property and the surrounding area. The place was lovely; clean, comfortable, and well furnished. The location was very convenient. The neighborhood is trendy, and there are a lot of bars and restaurants within walking distance. I'd definitely stay there again."
6349598,42971616,2015-08-16,9092615,Steven,Great location and beautiful space for a fun weekend in Seattle.  Hayley was very attentive during the checkin process and provided a great experience overall.  Would highly recommend.

Please contact her

8483477,48646895,2015-09-27,44432892,Laura,"We had a lovely stay at Anna's condo. The location was perfect - close to downtown and all the things we wanted to do.  Space was just right for two. I will mention that the furniture configuration is different than the photos.  For example there is not a full sofa, but a love seat and two barrel chairs,  but it was fine for our short stay in Seattle.  It was clean and fit what we needed. "
9151374,53543652,2015-11-09,24212341,Mike,"TL;DR - This place has a ton of potential, but I can't recommend it due to the complete lack of responsiveness of the host (never once responded to any of our concerns in the 4 nights we stayed), the lack of WiFi when it was promised, the bath tub drain was clogged, and the total lack of basic essentials like toilet paper and hand soap.       


PROS: 
The location was great and the apartment was nice.       


CONS:
However, after dropping the keys, the host mentioned she didn't have the wifi password on her, and that she'd run to the office and message me later. She then left to let us settle in. We first noticed there was no hand soap or toilet paper in the bathroom. So I messaged her, and got no response. I messaged her later about the WiFi, which looked like the modem wasn't connected to the Comcast backbone, and never got a response. We ended up going to Target to stock up on TP and soap.       


The next morning, when we used the shower, the bath tub drain was almost completely clogged, and there was a residue on the bath tub floor. I texted the host again, and got no response.

Josh was incredibly helpful and communicative.  He met us and let us in to the apartment, made sure everything we needed was available, and did everything he could to make us feel comfortable.  We will definitely be recommending his place as well as returning!"
6822322,38179338,2015-07-13,36547427,Manjoe,"The apartment was very nice in a very nice location that was very close to the downtown area. We were an hour late but Joshua was available to give us the keys once we called on arrival. The apartment was as described with all the amenities and WiFi. We asked for an air mattress on top of the futon, but opted to only use the air mattress which was great.

Would definitely come back again."
6822322,38460395,2015-07-15,35743280,Will,"Many thank you's are due to Josh for being an amazing host. Unfortunately, I didn't get the pleasure of meeting Josh in person, but he nevertheless facilitated my arrival with ease and efficiency despite my travel to Seattle having been delayed. I can't stress enough how helpful he was. 

 The apartment was exactly as advertised. My friend and I felt right at home for our 1 night stay. I took the bedroom and he used the roll out futon with which he said that he was able to enjoy a good night's rest. 
The location is great as it is indeed in the heart of Capitol Hill. Plenty of nearby restaurants, bars and a convenience store for temporary grocery needs. 

Josh was a great host and this listing was exactly what I was looking for during my one night in Seattle. I definitely recommend this listing and would stay there again in the future. "
6822322,39201289,2015-07-21,9360614,Sara,"Clean, spacious apt with bike storage! Josh responded immediately from reserving to questions and inquiries when we arrived. He gave us tips and points if interest in neighborhood. Apt is in amazingly convenient location to restaurants, a coop, trader joes and great bakeries and coffee shops. Parking isn't bad. Apt was simple and accommodated kids without the worry of breaking everything in sight Would definitely stay here again!!"
6822322,40142640,2015-07-28,38011807,Evan,"Joshua was communicative every step of the way since we could not meet in person. The apartment was very cute, clean and convenient for walking around Capitol Hill. "

6822322,41246831,2015-08-05,23821100,Robert,"We weren't able to meet Josh but he was available as needed and getting into the place was no problem. It's an older building but it's in a great area close to a couple of bus routes that head downtown and a short walk from a few main hot spots in Capitol Hill. $10-14 Uber to downtown generally. It has some character but isn't dumpy at all. There is only off street parking but it wasn't too hard to find an open spot; a lot might be needed on weekdays, but they are close by. The place was clean and tidy, not packed with amenities but just right to come back to and crash. The bathroom was clean and showers hot. Good wifi. Some neighborly noise because of the old building but nothing bad. All in all a good place to stay in a good neighborhood to hang out in. "
6822322,42431008,2015-08-13,5816170,Hanna,"Josh was always available and helpful.   The place was clean, and in a great location - love Cap Hill!"
6822322,44682967,2015-08-28,40443620,Kevin,"Joshua was very friendly and prompt on responses. The location was perfect, right near the middle of Capitol Hill across from restaurants/bars and near different types of shopping from food to home goods. The unit itself was VERY sparse and basic, no frills. No TV. But again, for the price and location if you just need a place to sleep its perfect. "

The location is quite convenient and easy to find.  The apartment building itself is a bit dated, especially compared to those surrounding it but quaint.
The apartment was as described.  Just for information, the floors are wood and not really sound proof.  Every time someone upstairs was walking, I could hear it."
6822322,49820856,2015-10-06,44303989,Chelsey,"I had a great time during my stay at Joshua's place. It was exactly what I needed, a simple but nice home base to explore the city from. Very close to transportation, and lots of interesting things to do, places to eat, and bars to go to nearby. I loved Capitol Hill!"
6822322,52233851,2015-10-27,5895957,Liz,Saying in Josh's apartment in Capitol Hill is a perfect location to explore the area and nearby attractions. I would recommend staying here!
1764233,8936966,2013-11-26,1398748,Marc,"My stay with Melissa was fine, the cable TV did not work, but otherwise everything was functioning fine.  I would rate the place as tidy, but I wouldn't say it was super clean.  I did have an issue with locking my keys in my room and Melissa was helpful in getting the door open as soon as possible.  "
1764233,9599898,2014-01-03,10088636,Sharon,"Melissa was a very friendly, nice and helpful host. 
I liked her very much. If I didn't like something, she would be willing to work with me to help. "
1764233,12742763,2014-05-10,4245573,Andreas,"The neighborhood is very nice and quiet. Near by is big shopping centre (5 min walking). UW isn't far away either. The house is shared with six other people but there is not much contact between them. I found it very convenient that Melissa provided a bike to rent. WiFi was fast and stable, TV didn't work. All in all I felt comfortbale for a 2 week stay."
1764233,17196702,2014-08-09,11920003,Jeffrey,"I stayed here for ~90 days while interning at a downtown tech company.

General comments: Almost exactly what you'll expect from the other reviews and pictures. My additions: The wifi was fast enough to stream HD movies. Mass transit to downtown isn't great on the weekends, but there's a bus stop 3 minutes away for an express bus (74) to downtown but only during rush hour, and a local bus (30) to U District with connections to downtown all the time. There are a lot of other buses a bit farther away, too. The U Village mall (5 minute walk away) has grocery stores, restaurants, Starbucks, etc, as does U District which is 25 minutes on foot or 10 minutes by bus. There aren't many late-night food options. Papa Johns (2 AM), McDonalds (24 hours), Safeway (1 AM) and Starbucks (2 AM) seemed to be the only places with locations open much past 10 PM.

Particular to this room: It's in a sort of half-basement (the window's at ground level), so it was 10-15 degrees cooler than the rest of the house and much of the city during the mid-summer heat wave. There's a bathroom just down the hall, and laundry facilities in the next room. There isn't really any good place to work in the room or the houses's public spaces (and, in fairness, the listing didn't claim there'd be any), so I just went to the U Village mall Starbucks when I needed to be productive. "
1764233,17980137,2014-08-19,19870191,Amanda,Melissa came and greeted me shortly after my arrival. The room was exactly as pictured - the neighborhood was charming and quiet. It was a pleasant and very private space to stay in. 
1764233,20741908,2014-10-05,2204166,Isabel,"The location of this house is formidable. I wish I could have seen Melissa more often. The room is big and if you do not mind some humidity and thin walls, then you will be happy. "
1764233,23781816,2014-12-10,13412095,Dave,"The place was as described, quiet and one to UW village. No issues."
1764233,27770605,2015-03-11,27695195,Luca,"Ho visto Melissa una volta. Mi ha accolto calorosamente, una persona molto affabile. La stanza pulita e confortevole, dotata di frigorifero personale e di tutte le comodità. Il bagno sempre pulito e rifornito. Gli altri ospiti socievoli e tranquilli. Una esperienza davvero positiva. Mi dispiace non aver visto Melissa per ringraziarla prima della partenza. "
1764233,28034545,2015-03-16,672879,Van,"This was the first time I stayed in a private room so I wasn't sure what to expect. Though there were a number of other rooms in the house, it was surprisingly very quiet.  It was great to have onsite parking, because street parking was bumper to bumper.  Had company business nearby, so the location was perfect; easy to find and near to some great restaurants and bars. Would stay again if I needed to be in that area. "
1764233,42666242,2015-08-15,16873726,Joanne,"The neighborhood was very nice, close to the bike trail and cafe. My time there didn't start off so smoothly however. When I first reserved, Melissa wrote me back and suggested that I might prefer another room, one upstairs. I wrote and said that I would like that if it wasn't more expensive. She didn't reply. I assumed that meant I was still in the basement. I arrived almost two hours after the check-in time and the room in the basement was not ready. There was dirty linen on the bed and the carpet needed to be vacuumed, with some white stuff spilled all over it. There was a strong smell in the house, a smell like a bathroom that needed cleaning and old food. Because the basement room wasn't ready, I assumed that I was supposed to be upstairs so I went up and took possession of the room she had offered me in her email-- this room was ready.  I wrote her an email telling her what I had done. It was not a quiet night, as a man woke me at around 10:00 talking loudly on the phone outside my window. I had to get dressed and go outside to ask him to please be quiet. The next morning, I found three emails from Melissa, telling me that I was not supposed to be in that room and apologizing for being late to clean my room. She also told me that the man who had just left my room had taken the keys with him and I would not have my keys until the next day. I took the sheets I had slept in and swapped them with the sheets in the basement room, and repacked my clothes and toiletries and moved myself downstairs. I also went out and bought a fan, for white noise. So it was a difficult start to my stay. I also have to say that I did my showering at my daughter's apartment because I was uneasy with the lack of cleanliness in the basement bathroom (the upstairs bathroom was much cleaner). Also, people did do laundry  (right next to my room) after 9pm and the people next door were very fond of singing happy birthday at midnight (twice it happened!)-- but they also played some very nice flute in the early evening! That is all to be expected in a city, however, and I was happy to have my fan."
1764233,43146247,2015-08-17,40529958,Darryl,"Melissa was very helpful and responsive. The room was as described in a nice neighborhood of Seattle, right next to the university."
1764233,45258888,2015-09-01,28429086,Fu-Pang,"The room was exactly as pictured, and very close to U village mall. The WIFI didn't work properly twice during my stay, and Melissa was very helpful in solving the problems. I will recommend it to those who are seeking a room with an inexpensive rent and a compatible quality. "
8812578,52919100,2015-11-02,31256789,Teri,"We reserved the 2 bedroom, but due to a little mix up, actually ended up staying in the 1 bedroom next door.   So, I cannot review the interior of the 2 bedroom.  Everything inside the 1 bedroom was just as described.  It was cute & cozy, neat & clean.  Communicating with Tiffany was great throughout the procees.  She always responded very very quickly and was very accommodating. The location & free parking was fabulous for us!  "
7228499,42887631,2015-08-16,37610064,Fong,"Very clean, conveniently located family friendly accommodation in quiet neighbourhood - great for views and exploring Seattle by foot if you don't mind steep hills. Listing was as described and host promptly answered all questions asked. "
7228499,43277972,2015-08-18,8732868,Sydney,"Amazing home, and it was just as pictured and described in the listing."
7228499,44146385,2015-08-24,30044596,Lue,"Blair was very easy to work with and the online reservation option made life that much better.  The house was as described and in a great area with beautiful views.  For families with kids, there is a convenient little park with a playground around the corner (in the back of the house).  Plan accordingly and be careful on walks as there are pretty steep hills.  The house has a great sized kitchen that is nicely stocked with dishes, glassware, and pots and pans.  Two bathrooms helps tremendously.  "
7228499,44436279,2015-08-26,18011984,Roger,"Staying at Blair's place was great. It was everything as described - it was clean, had a lot of space, had enough beds for our party of 6, and also had great views of the city. Blair left very clear instructions on how to use the place, e.g. where the key is, how to use the WiFi, what to do for clean-up afterwards. He was responsive to the messages I sent him. I highly recommend this place. Thanks, Blair!"
7228499,44670229,2015-08-28,39445948,Tony,Great stay.  House was very clean and roomy.  Everything is working properly.  And good view from the 2nd story bedroom window.
7228499,45185944,2015-08-31,41355692,Ellen,"I was able to book Blair's place last minute on a lightning sale for a girls night. My friends and I wanted to have a dinner and sleepover night but none of us have a place that would accommodate that. Blair's place was perfect. The kitchen was well stocked with appliances and the beds were very comfortable. Although, we were only there for one night I would highly suggest staying here for a longer stay. It is very comfortable and near a lot of great sights in Seattle. "
7228499,45334995,2015-09-01,11498299,Elsa,"We had a short but wonderful stay at Blair's beautiful home! The house is gorgeous, in a very quiet area and the view is fantastic. Would love to stay again!"
7228499,45507606,2015-09-03,41556527,Spencer,"Amazing location, home is in good condition and worked well for my multigenerational family. Excellent communication by host. Would certainly recommend! "
7228499,45798571,2015-09-06,13833400,Andrew,Place was great and is in a nice location if you don't mind hills. Blair was also very accommodating.
7228499,46139707,2015-09-08,37894531,Irina,"Queen Anne is great (and hilly, so bring some comfy shoes and prepare to work out your calves). The house is lovely and perfect for a group of friends or a family."
7228499,46435160,2015-09-10,35676412,Amy,We had a lovely time in this adorable home. It was clean and welcoming and had everything we needed. I'd stay here again!
7228499,46485962,2015-09-11,30912317,Jack,"There are plenty of space as described fits 8 people without an issue. Place is clean and well equipped with all daily needs. Priced very fair as well for our needs.  Nice neighbourhood and very close to Kerry park for a night view :)

"
7228499,46648256,2015-09-12,9996475,Jeff,Beautiful listing in a great part of town. I'd highly recommend it for anyone visiting the greater Seattle area. A short walk around the neighborhood on a clear day has some of the most beautiful views of the Seattle skyline.
7228499,47090823,2015-09-15,6757685,Heather,everything was great for our bands stay. as described and perfect location 
7228499,47406130,2015-09-18,3590996,Francis,"Modest home and nice amenities. Don't know why the cleaning fee was $100+ when we were given instruction to throw sheets and towels into the washer. Pictures were a lot nicer than reality, but it was ok."
7228499,47656918,2015-09-21,38023324,Katherine,"Blair was a great host and the house was great! It was my 1st time staying in Seattle & using AirBnb & I was very nervous! We were a group of 8 ladies staying and coming in at different times. I asked Blair lots of questions and shared all my concerns for my guests and he would always reply immediately & with great feedback. Very nice, very professional, very accommodating! I would definitely want Blair as a host again and would love to stay at this house again! Great neighborhood, house was super clean when we arrived. The 8 of us loved staying here! I wish I was still there :)
- Katherine C.  "
7228499,48109632,2015-09-23,10076027,Sabrina,Great - we were there for just one night but it was perfect
7228499,48357795,2015-09-25,8586764,Kelley,"Cute home in the hilly Queen Anne neighborhood within walking distance of the Space Needle. Our kids loved the bunk beds downstairs, and we enjoyed the private suite upstairs. We've been on the road too, so having a washer/dryer was much appreciated!"
7228499,48428452,2015-09-26,40656722,Carla,Blair's house was perfect for what our group was looking for! There was plenty of room for us 8 girls and we couldn't ask for a better view! Perfect location! 
7228499,48703078,2015-09-28,751219,Ryan & Lorelei,Beautiful spot in a central Seattle location. 
7228499,49148444,2015-10-01,2755404,Paul,"Blair was helpful and easy to get ahold of when we needed to ask questions. In fact, when we had a travel change, he was flexible and reasonable. The house itself is clean, simply furnished and very comfortable. The neighborhood is not fancy, but it's very, very well-located if you want to get to downtown, especially to Amazon's offices, which are about 7 minutes away by car. One note: it's on the top of a steep hill, so if you're thinking of walking around and using the house as a base, that's great, but it's more San Francisco than Seattle in that way. The views of the city are frankly amazing from the upstairs bedroom, and the downstairs full/twin bunk is very comfortable. A truly nice small home for Seattle visitors."
7228499,50194828,2015-10-10,31311441,Shoshanna,"The place was essentially as described - clean, neat, and welcoming - however, it unfortunately hadn't been fully prepped for the number of guests we'd registered. Luckily, Blair was very responsive and coordinated getting us most of what we needed and we were able to make do without a problem. He also generously refunded a portion of the charges to make up for the mishap, which was much appreciated. All in all, it's a nice place in a great location and we were quite satisfied."
7228499,51280235,2015-10-19,21071115,Aaron,Everything was great!
7228499,52831473,2015-11-02,3916953,Scott,"Quaint house in quiet neighborhood. Clean, Easy access to house, lots of room for 7 of us, seemless check in/out. Perfect for a weekend with some friends.  Only downside is that If your group doesn't have a car thee is not much in the way of food and drink within walking distance however quite central so great access to several neighborhoods/downtown within minutes. Overall excellent."
7228499,53266693,2015-11-07,46425621,Janet,The house is as described and met our expectations.  The previous reviews are accurate.  Loved the location and the ability to walk to Queen Anne's downtown (Trader Joes and Molly Moons) as well as downtown Seattle and Lake Union.  The views are beautiful especially at night. Yes we saw a sea plane on Lake Union.   We hope to stay here again since this worked out perfectly for our family. Blair was quick to respond to my pre arrival questions which was appreciated.  
7228499,53902090,2015-11-14,440250,Jarrod,The house was in a great location with an outstanding view and suited the needs of my wife and I and our two children perfectly. Blair was a very accommodating host. 
7228499,54095617,2015-11-16,9858809,Max,"Awesome house. It was perfect to host 8 people for my birthday weekend. Perfect location in Seattle. Close to awesome bars, restaurants and downtown. Would highly recommend to any group of people visiting the Seattle area."
7228499,54711819,2015-11-23,44788786,Arianna,"We had 10 girls stay at the house for a weekend getaway - and it was a great (and very comfortable!) experience.  The listing represents the house well and accurately.  It's centrally located, and there are awesome views of the city and the Space Needle from the top of the hill (a number of great bars and restaurants are short walk or quick drive away).  The house is well-equipped.

Blair was an attentive and responsive host, promptly answering any and all questions (and even helping to locate a favorite sauce pan that had been left behind by one of the guests).  (Thanks for being a great host!)

I would highly recommend this rental, and we would certainly  love to book it again in the future."
7228499,55369134,2015-12-01,44528659,Rose,"Accurate description. Liked the neighborhood, though the hills were tricky with all the ice. We had someone fall and hurt his wrist. "
7228499,55833053,2015-12-06,34945404,Reese,Blair quickly responded to my messages prior to the trip and addressed all my concerns. The house was very comfortable with awesome views of the city in all directions. Blair was very easy to contact during our whole stay.

7228499,56937835,2015-12-20,41666886,Alicia,We had a lovely time at this house. Blair was quick to answer questions and the view of the city was fantastic. The house was perfect for my friend and family get together. 
7228499,57315971,2015-12-24,10689579,Alex,"Listing description was great, exactly as illustrated. Blair was responsive and helpful, all information needed in description!  Thanks for the easy and pleasant stay!"

5848400,31749690,2015-05-09,1032014,Zach,"Wow, what a fabulous space!  A beautifully cared-for home with great amenities and decor.  We felt very comfortable in the home and the property-management company was very helpful and prompt.  It was nice being in Queen Anne and living like a local for a while- a very lovely place to live.  A bit of a walk to downtown Queen Anne, but very enjoyable and totally doable- even with our 3 kids.  "
5848400,32377338,2015-05-17,31370574,Jim,this was my first time to rent a home like we did on this trip to Seattle and i was not disappointed... the home was just as beautiful as we had hoped for and the pictures of the home were perfect.  i had my 4 youg adult children and i was the old man but  there was enough room to make everyone happy.
5848400,37321500,2015-07-06,32914480,Christopher,"The house and surrounding neighborhood are beautiful. The house itself it nicely furnished and well equipped. The weekend my friends and I stayed was unseasonably hot, but the house came equipped with a number of fans, which we found already set up and running upon our arrival. They only think for larger groups to be aware of is that, while there are two bathrooms, only one is equipped with a shower (the other has a tub) and it is connected to two of the upstairs bedrooms, making it necessary to walk through one of the bedrooms to get to it.  "
5848400,51272223,2015-10-19,36082222,Nancy,"Although the roads were narrow, I loved the neighborhood!! The color scheme outside of the house was indicative of the period that it was built. Inside, antiques were everywhere!! Especially loved the stained glass lampshades--- most hanging fixtures were as old as the house. There was plenty of room & was comfortable. The kitchen was roomy & well equipped. LOVED the green space in the backyard!! Having to walk thru a bedroom to get to the main bathroom, wasn't too convenient, but manageable. Would recommend this house to others!!"
8939595,51420411,2015-10-19,9933272,Katie,"Listing was as-described. Slept well - mattress was nice (not too firm, not too soft). 

Hooks were available to hang my shirts/coat, and there were side tables to rest my phone and a glass of water. Towels and washcloths were well stocked. "
8939595,51595208,2015-10-21,46595180,Kevin,"Great experience, great location. Right in the middle of the university, easy to get around using the trains and buses. Getting downtown was really easy and fast. The house was just as described, I booked the room really short notice and he was very accommodating with everything, thanks again."
8939595,52173084,2015-10-26,23294833,Annie,"Super endroit, super quartier, en plein cœur de l'université de Washington. Superbe maison. Nous avons été très bien accueillis par Ethan qui nous a aidé et nous a conseillé pour notre tour de ville. Je recommande sans hésitation!"
8939595,52458494,2015-10-29,23352555,Glenn,It was a wonderful experience. Ethan was there on site to take care of everything. It's set up more like a hostel so I got to meet people coming and going from all over the country and world. Nice old house and great stay!
8939595,52653108,2015-10-31,47439867,Favour,"Enjoyed my stay. Room was very spacious, and clean. Will definitely book again. "
8939595,53081494,2015-11-04,46403816,Jay,"I had a good stay at Dario's with Ethan. An old charmed house conveniently located 2 blocks of University of Washington, within walking distance of transit line which you can take a direct express downtown for sightseeing. Room is nice, with working heater, and was warm when temperature dipped. This bed has soft sheets! Common area and bathroom were kept clean and everything was quiet, low-key, no stress, free to come and go. Talked to Host Ethan for awhile, cool guy!"
8939595,53150574,2015-11-05,34846449,Rachel,"The location is quite convenient, only ten or more minutes away from the campus. Also quite close to restaurants and supermarkets. The room is also clean and tidy. The hose is helpful and friendly. The only thing is the house is quite old and the furniture as well. The food (fruits) in the fridge is not as fresh as I expected."
8939595,53313945,2015-11-07,17453944,Aviyah,I had fun. The environment was clean. The location was superb. The smoke was accessible and undeniable seattle was the bomb and Dario was a great host
8939595,53627889,2015-11-10,46003463,Conrad,"This is a great location, didn't get a chance to meet the host. But plenty if food for breakfast in the kitchen."
8939595,53939137,2015-11-14,45034439,Daan,"A room in a squeaky house without a host.

I have stayed in the house for 3 nights. Even though the house was fine and close enough to downtown, it was strange that I have not met the host once.
You receive an entrance code for the house, parking at the back.
Kitchen without table to sit at with possible other guests.

All in all room was ok, bathroom could have been cleaner.

When booking this, you should see this a room with decent location and free breakfast. Don't expect hospitality and during low season you might be all alone in a squeaky house with very squeaky bed."
8939595,54327823,2015-11-18,2506509,Nancy Glenn,"Wow, what a comfortable bed and yummy breakfast with appealing food and drink choices. I enjoyed other guests in the great shared space.  The entire house is wonderfully organized and there is even easy parking in back.  I arrived at night and stumbled a bit to find the house number and identify the correct house...once I got inside, the four night visit was restful and enjoyable on all counts.  The walks in the neighborhood to the Saturday Farmers Market and to the University of Washington campus were an added benefit.  Thanks!  Nancy"
8939595,54398938,2015-11-19,5326824,Amy,"The host was a manager, Ethan, who was friendly and cleaning as I entered.  I would stay again, mostly because of a great location walking distance to fun shops, restaurants and bus services.  The refridgerator was fun, kitchen available with many fun foods.  Could use a dining room table or coffee table so we can eat more comfortably!  I needed to check out an hour later, and Ethan was very easygoing about it. "
8939595,54493601,2015-11-20,12927893,Ryan,"Centrally located on campus, great spot. And definitely would use again!"
8939595,56709910,2015-12-16,51317739,Kevin,Was a pleasant experience overall. Nice neighbourhood  and if you're feeling a bit adventurous it's a fairly short walk from downtown Seattle
1797207,14615000,2014-06-23,4069491,Skyla,"Oh boy, where to start! I guess, first and foremost, this condo is in an amazing location. Half a mile away from both the Space Needle and Pike Place, it is the perfect basecamp for everything you want to in downtown Seattle. Check-in was quick and simple, check out even easier. The room was comfortable with tons of amenities, and does comfortably fit 5-6 people. I'd highly recommend this location, and would gladly stay here again."
1797207,18007344,2014-08-20,2886092,Abir,Condo is in a fantastic location on 1st ave. Plenty of space to sleep 6. The unit was cleaned very well and had all the toiletries and amenities we needed. The parking space was large enough for my full-size rental car. I would gladly stay here again.
1797207,20144413,2014-09-24,6022300,Julin,"Located in the central of the tourist spots, the apartment is amazing! We arrived on a sunday and sally was very welcoming. "

1797207,35077112,2015-06-15,17287766,Stephanie,"The location of this apartment was AMAZING.  Walking distance to everything we wanted to see (Space Needle, Pikes, even the ferry).  The apartment was clean, the towels were plushy and soft, the beds were really nice, there was even DirecTV when we wanted to veg out a bit.  Also, seriously the nicest pullout couch I've ever seen (it felt like a regular bed).  Throughout the booking process Darik was very responsive to all my questions."
1797207,39262613,2015-07-22,27542243,John,"Very comfortable, and in the heart of just about everything. A short walk to the space needle, shops, restaurants, waterfront and attractions, Pikes Place Market etc. Had a fantastic time in Seattle and at this location. "
1797207,41730940,2015-08-09,11132123,Bernard,Great location to stay. Condo was also well-stocked with supplies. Beds are also very comfortable. 
1797207,51108428,2015-10-18,30502301,Paula,"Ruri met us at the entrance and showed us to our room and then a quick tour to the open air terrace overlooking the Seattle waterfront and the building amenities.  Our unit was nicely equipped and the welcome basket was nice.  All in our party raved about ""How wonderful the beds are and the pillows were perfect.""  We even enjoyed the fireplace while listening to the music station.  We definitely were thrilled to have the bakery so easily accessible.  The rooms were clean and spacious.  A bit of a maze to negotiate the parking garage layout."
1797207,56847684,2015-12-19,23077023,Stephen,"Thank you Darik for your great place. It was perfect for us. Great neighborhood with plenty of places to eat, drink, and shop!!! It was exactly like the pictures on the website. They were very helpful with our check in and checkout process, and I really appreciated that.

6796066,37618552,2015-07-08,4776913,Jena,The place was very cute and very girl & LGBT friendly. Everyone I met was really nice. Thanks for letting me stay! :o)
6796066,38033884,2015-07-12,1405559,Remi,"The location of this house is very good，public transportation convenient. Super market and grocery store and restaurants are all within walking distance( 5 minutes at most ). Ane is a nice and considerate hostess,  the towels, shampoo, conditioner, body wash and body cream are all nicely prepared. The room is beautifully decorated. She even prepared the membership cards for shopping around. Sending me messages to make sure our arrival go smoothly, providing aroma oil therapy advices by leaving us notes. Besides, the other 3 housemates are friendly and helpful too.  A great experience ! "
6796066,40122127,2015-07-28,34748525,Kathy,I had a nice stay here. The location was great for using public transportation.  Ane's roommate are very helpful and nice.
6796066,43012888,2015-08-16,13498737,Amber,The room was exactly what I was looking for. Good price I  a good area.
6796066,43577041,2015-08-20,10508056,Gabrielle,Ane and her housemates were all really friendly and welcoming. A funky bedroom with good transport links into the city.
6796066,45161949,2015-08-31,17834971,Rachel,Ane and her housemates were amazingly welcoming and made me feel like the house was a warm home to come back to.  The house is filled with colorful knickknacks and cool art and the cat is full of love and can't stop craving cuddles.  Best experience I could have hoped for!
6796066,46760861,2015-09-13,35511706,Emily,A truly magical room in a beautiful home! Ane welcomed me as I was arriving and offered support throughout my stay. Added bonus: I got to snuggle with a roommate's cute cat! The photos do not do the garden justice. I would recommend this for someone looking for a safe space to stay with good vibes.
6796066,48616949,2015-09-27,23639059,Sara,"This room was charming, clean and comfortable! Since this was my first trip to Seattle, I especially appreciated how accessible the house was - just a quick walk following an easy light rail trip from the airport.
Thanks to Ane and Lacy for making my first nights in Seattle so pleasant!"
6796066,50706655,2015-10-13,42052478,Jessie,"Ane and her housemates were very welcoming and made me feel right at home amongst the succulents (and there are many succulents indeed)! The house constantly smelled like good food as someone always seemed to be cooking up a delicious veggie concoction in the kitchen (some ingredients locally sourced from their garden in the front yard). 

Ane was very thoughtful and provided me with everything I needed for my stay - maps, information about Seattle and even discount cards for the local grocery stores. The house is conveniently located near stores and restaurants and public transportation in North Beacon Hill which is just a stones throw away from downtown Seattle. Overall it was a great stay!"
6796066,53128042,2015-11-05,8618406,Karen,"Ane and her roommates were kind and respectful, and the house had a peaceful and gentle vibe. The house was always quiet and I felt very safe. I was cold my first night and let Ane know about it- she then provided me with a portable heater, which kept me comfortable throughout my stay. Parking right out front was easy and always a spot. Highlights: the freshest rainbow chard and herbs from the outdoor garden; queer friendly; Zane the sweetest cat; Ane helped me get in touch with someone for my research (the reason I was in town)! "
8155580,56913158,2015-12-20,43231806,Surasak,"This is my first experience using Airbnb. It is very great atmosphere around because in the area it also apartment of UW students. So don't worry about neighborhood. In my opinion, if everything is done, it will be very awesome experience for intern or exchanged student for short period of time. Timo is very friendly and funny. I will definitely miss him. However, during the period I stayed, I might face some difficulties about laundry which is not finish since I came till I left. It was a good offer to stay at another house in the first week because this home didn't finish yet. But actually my main reason that I chose the house near UW because I don't want to pay bus fare. After I maintain moving to this house, my room wasn't well painted. Anyway I may get compensation by getting 1 person per room. I do confirm that if everything is done (you should ask the detail first), it will be very awesome. When you read this comment, everything may finish already. So if I cut the bad thing which can be finished in the future, I can comment this 5 stars!!"
7853498,43010177,2015-08-16,27539771,Dan,"Bethany is the best! Her decoration skills are exquisite, her leather couch is super comfortable, her chess skills are pretty spectacular and her infectiously cheery personality will brighten your day. I only stayed one night and now we're like best buds. Seriously! "
7853498,43451283,2015-08-19,5797812,James,"I really enjoyed my stay at this cosy little space. It's an ideal location; relying solely on public transport I was able to quickly and easily access to Downtown, and the northern side of city and even the airport. The house itself was a really nice place to stay, including most comfortable couch I've ever slept on and a beautiful view of downtown Seattle and Union Lake. 

As a host Bethany was simply fantastic. Welcoming, and accommodating of my last minute schedule changes, she not only made my stay at her place fantastic, but my time in Seattle a memorable trip.
She took the time to show me around some the cities best spots and recommended others I could visit on my stay. We even cooked a meal together on her back yard grill. My only regret is that we couldn't have hung out longer.

Whether you just need a place to stay or a friendly guide and companion, Bethany's place is a fantastic choice for your visit to Seattle."
7853498,44246425,2015-08-24,41777551,Mark,"Couldn't have asked for a better host or a better spot for my first trip to Seattle. Nestled in the city's Fremont area, it's a very chill, friendly blend of people and places: great food and drink within walking the distance. The bus to downtown is literally a block away. It was great! Bethany was a very accommodating host, allowing me to come and go as I pleased. Her home was my home for two days. After walking around Seattle all day, I was happy to plop down in her backyard, open a beer and relax. Awesome. Friendly. Helpful. Good stay. "
7853498,45350406,2015-09-01,32538922,Tyler,Bethany and the neighborhood were super cool. Very laid back vibe. I was in town for a wedding and Bethany made it clear that it was cool if I came and went whenever I wanted. The house was kept very tidy. In the mornings Bethany had coffee brewing. She was always up for a good conversation! When I had some down time Bethany offered to take me around the neighborhood and show me the sights. She was very knowledgable about the area. If you are a young single traveler I would highly recommend staying here!
8533375,51337191,2015-10-19,3654022,Jason,"We could not have asked for a more perfect place to stay. The location is a quiet verdant neighborhood with interesting shops a walk or quick drive away, and about one minute from the I-5, putting the whole metro area within a 15 minute drive. Getting to the university was easy too. Allison and Crai were so nice, and Crai's recommendations were excellent. The space was very private and clean."
8533375,53538742,2015-11-09,19499942,Amanda,"Alison and Crai's apartment was a lovely and perfect destination for a weekend getaway in Seattle. The accommodations were comfortable, private, sizely, and accessible. Alison and Crai were gracious hosts, even providing us with fresh baked cookies upon our arrival, and a fresh supply of coffee and teas. 

The location was perfect. The town of Wallingford is charming, and Crai (as an accomplished travel writer) proved to be a great resource in navigating the trip. There is plenty to do in the neighborhood, as well as easy access to transportation should you want to go elsewhere. 

The pair made coordinating very easy and were great to work with. 

I highly recommend this apartment. "
8533375,55218714,2015-11-29,3400212,Eugene,"Had a great stay here. Unit is very roomy and quite seperate from the hosts since it has its own entrance. Very peaceful neighborhood with lots of things nearby. Would recommend to anyone needing a place to stay right in Wallingford. 

Unit had everything we needed during our stay like soap and towels."
7636185,45750886,2015-09-05,43121426,Simon,"Angela met us when we arrived and made us feel very welcome. She accommodated our short notice request, and provided lots of local knowledge and advice on places to go in Seattle - including a great little local pub just around the corner! The area has some nice cafes and restaurants and a local supermarket a few blocks away. Jefferson Park, a beautiful neighborhood park just up the street from the property, offers a stunning view of Seattle.
The location was a short walk to the train station with direct link to the city center and airport, and there are local buses nearby. 
The cottage was perfect for our needs, clean, spacious, and nicely presented, with a fully equipped kitchen, modern bathroom, comfy bed and plenty of closet space. It is also air-conditioned, has a large TV, with cable, and a good selection of books. Wifi was available and worked well.
The cottage is a stand-alone building, at the rear of Angela and Herman's house. The set-up is private and easily accessed. Street parking was available.
We really enjoyed our stay, and would strongly recommend this cottage to any couple who are keen to stay reasonably close to the center of Seattle.
Thank you, again, Angela and Herman, for your hospitality!"
7636185,46338645,2015-09-09,18147739,Molly,"""Cozy cottage"" is a spotless, comfortable retreat in a walkable neighborhood, just two blocks from incredible Jefferson Park, with its spectacular sunset views of downtown Seattle and Elliot Bay. Angela and Herman are thoughtful and engaging hosts. "
7636185,48246424,2015-09-24,6209813,Vince,"Wow ! Great place ! Great host ! Great location ! Cozy , felt brand new ! Bed very comfy ! We HOPE TO BE ABLE TO COME BACK !! "
7636185,49063967,2015-09-30,7064746,Ann,"If visiting Seattle, this is the place to stay. Angela & Herman's place is immaculate and has all the comforts of home.  There are many niceties that are extras and Angela even introduced us to the Aero Press coffee maker.  Tasty.  Easy to get downtown to see all the sights. "
7636185,49371283,2015-10-03,10667928,Monique,"This place was really nice! Very clean and modern. Nice decor and the bed was comfy. Had everything you could need for cooking, short walk to a coffee shop and easy to access the airport or downtown Seattle. Would definitely stay here again. Angela was super nice. Thanks for a perfect stay!"
7636185,49675385,2015-10-05,6172709,Nicole,"The cottage was cozy, equipped with all of the essentials (and more-bread, coffee,wine), nicely decorated and quiet. We brought our 9 month old and Angela provided a Pack 'n Play, baby bath tub, toys, booster seat and she even rented children's books at the library! She went out of the way to make our family's stay comfortable. We will be back for another stay in the future!"
7636185,50010694,2015-10-08,10948866,Laura,Great place to stay! Very close to downtown & everything was clean & cozy.  Easy & quick communication too.
7636185,50716162,2015-10-13,2445439,Jedediah,"Had a wonderful stay in Angela and Herman's cottage. The place came stocked with all the conveniences, and the hosts were very accommodating. A great place from which to explore Seattle, and convenient to the light rail. Would happily return!"
7636185,51050513,2015-10-17,44677871,Vincent,"Herman and Angela's modern-chic cottage is a hidden gem for travelers seeking proximity to downtown Seattle without the huge price tag. The studio size cottage is comfortable for two and a luxury for one person. The well equipped kitchen is useful if one wishes to prepare simple meal. The host has basic essentials like bread, jam, milk, etc. and I especially appreciated the coffee and Aeropress! I have the privacy needed while also enjoyed a couple of friendly conversations with the host throughout my 3-night stay. The light rail, which is walking distance from the cottage is great as it connects the airport and downtown with several stops (to places of interest) in between. I would recommend people buying an ORCA card. $30 allowed me to take train and buses during my stay without having to worry about keeping change on me. I will stay at the Cottage again on my next visit ... no-brainer!"
7636185,51542158,2015-10-21,43533062,Brandon,"Angela, the primary person that we talked to, was extremely kind and helpful. She was a very generous hostess that gave us a lot of great advice about the city.

The cottage was exactly as advertised. The photos of the place are spot on. Everything was in perfect working order. It was a great place to come back to after a day of exploring.

As mentioned, the neighborhood is a little outside of downtown Seattle, but it was very conveniently located. We were probably a 5 minute drive outside of downtown Seattle and about a 15 minute drive form the airport."
7636185,51748643,2015-10-24,44639375,Lisa,"Angela & Herman's ""Little Cottage"" was beyond our expectations. It was cozy, and had all the amenities we needed. Great location for anyone visiting Seattle (10 minutes from pike via uber or car). "
7636185,52077824,2015-10-26,17052499,Clarissa,"We loved staying at the cozy cottage! It was just as described- convenient, clean, and in a great location! Angela was a great host and made sure that we had everything that we needed. The cottage was the perfect size for two people and we had no problems during our stay. I would definitely recommend the cozy cottage and would stay here again. Thanks for being such a wonderful host, Angela! "
7636185,52560845,2015-10-30,22219245,Leala,"Really inviting host, the place was really cute and just great. Enjoyed the neighborhood and being close to Jefferson Park. I enjoyed staying there, definitely recommended."
7636185,52846803,2015-11-02,35906535,Daniel,Angela and Herman's cozy cottage was an absolute joy to stay in. It is EXACTLY how it looks in the photos and I say that it in the most complimentary way possible. Angela checked in with us and made sure we felt comfortable and accomodated. They gave us some great suggestions and answered all of our inquiries. I would absolutely stay with them again.
7636185,53091946,2015-11-04,8851087,Kathryn,"We loved this cozy cabin.  Angela is a gracious hostess.  She responded quickly to our request to book & was very helpful when we arrived to make sure we had all the pertinent information; door lock code, wifi code, etc.  The cabin is great! It is very comfortable & nicely decorated. The kitchen is very efficient and we loved the aeropress coffee maker.  The closet was nice and big and the space was just great for our layover between Alaska and Texas.  We were very pleased with the accommodations & look forward to staying here again.  "
7636185,53466804,2015-11-09,43107282,Julia,"My husband and I stayed here for part of our honeymoon and we loved it!! We arrived at night but could easily spot the cottage from the street - it looked just like the pictures! Angela was kind enough to greet us with a celebratory bottle of wine but was clear that she didn't have to if we needed space. 

The cottage was warm, cozy, modern and perfect for two. Not to mention the location was VERY convenient to just about anywhere. It's just a small walk to the Beacon Hill light rail station. I would highly recommend buying an Orca day pass at the Link kiosk. We were able to navigate the city so easily and we're really happy with how close the cottage was to good eateries and bars. 

The kitchen has basic utensils needed to cook, make coffee, toast, etc. The bed was comfortable and the cottage has plenty of closet space for two. The only (very small) issue we had was the size of the shower and that was mainly because my husband is 6' tall. It was ok for me (5'2) but he had a difficult time maneuvering in it. One tidbit: make sure that you get in the shower first and turn it on. Or if you want to get the temp right before getting in, aim the nozzle away from the shower door so it doesn't spray on the floor.... (Oops!). Overall, it was a great use of space! 

Angela was always quick to respond and give suggestions. There was an issue about locking the door on our first night (ours, not theirs - I blame it on jet lag!) and Angela sent her husband out right away to check it out. 

I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this cottage to anyone and hope to be here again someday! "
7636185,53718587,2015-11-11,47735817,Lindsey,"The place was just as described - very clean, modern and private. It was the perfect little getaway. Angela was very welcoming and made sure that we were settled in once we arrived and offered some suggestions of places to see while in the city. Overall it was fantastic, thank you!"
7636185,54373529,2015-11-19,44208958,Kate,"Angela was incredibly helpful and welcoming.  When we arrived, we had a pack n play, a bathtub and a rock n play - all the basics that we use at home with our 2 month old.  She checked in with us to make sure that we were all set and comfortable,  and that things were good with the cottage.  The cottage is super cute and clean, and feels very private.  Overall a great experience!"
7636185,54562529,2015-11-21,46525048,Charleigh.Pearson,I had a wonderful experience in this cozy little house. Would definitely come here again. Wonderful hosts as well :) 
7636185,55559992,2015-12-02,17151671,Lori,"We had a wonderful experience staying at this great little cottage in Beacon Hill! Angela was very welcoming and very responsive to all my questions. The place is just as described and in a great location for us (our son's family lives only blocks away). It's a short walk to the light rail and close to local restaurants and shopping. The cottage was extremely clean and there was coffee, bread for toast and toiletries available for our use (and we did use them). We plan to stay again when we go back to visit in the spring. Thanks Angela & Herman!"
