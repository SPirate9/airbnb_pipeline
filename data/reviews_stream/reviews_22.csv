6423204,34152155,2015-06-05,1728197,Drew,"The cabin was great, and only about 2 blocks from all the rest shopping and food in the Ballard neighborhood. Check in and check out were super easy, and they left maps and notes about the house so we felt right at home. A great experience."
6423204,34467978,2015-06-08,33664190,Joe,A friend and I booked this house for a long weekend. It could not have been in a better location. Great local food and beers are within walking distance and the house was perfect fit for a weekend stay. Thanks a ton!
6423204,34723470,2015-06-11,33603635,Stephanie,"Great location! So many restaurants and shops within walking distance. Also very easy to drive into downtown, everything we wanted to see/do was close by. The house was exactly as described, simple accommodations, but  comfortable. Mark and Marti were easy to get in contact with and very helpful. "
6423204,35118412,2015-06-15,26373438,Heather,"Delightful! It is exactly as Mark and Marti describe...a little worn on the outside but warm, welcoming ( instantly felt at home) on the inside. LOVED the location - walking distance to amazing coffee shops, dining spots, parks, a library, the water.  Easy access to downtown Seaatle and other neighborhoods in Seattle. I'd live here forever if I could!
The space inside the was awesome - loved not being linked to technology (currently no wifi - they do plan to offer that soon though) and the visual stimulation/distraction of a TV ( currently no TV - they do plan to install one though). The beds were great. Layout of the home was spacious. Didn't take advantage of the backyard but would have had we been there a day longer!
The only bummer was the wash machine had broken earlier in the week and leaked onto the old floor causing a musty smell that permeated the home but was resolved when the doors were open. Also Marti was awesome and stopped by to give my friend and I $ so we could do laundry at a laundromat close to the home...she even checked out which laundromat would be the best for us and had good Yelp ratings. Above and beyond is what I would say about these hosts! Looking forward to coming back and staying again!"
6423204,36026271,2015-06-24,12474414,Jamison,"Mark & Marti have a great little house in the heart of Ballard steps from all the nightlife, restaurants, and weekend farmers market. The house has all the amenities (no internet) that you need for a great stay. Never met the hosts but they were quick to respond to email and check in was a breeze. Cool little backyard was another plus. I would stay here again in a heartbeat."
6423204,36293004,2015-06-27,832688,Amy,"Mark & Marti's cottage is fabulous. Great location in Ballard, right by the bus line, good restaurants, and BREWERIES. The apartment is very clean and organized, with everything necessary for a comfortable visit. I would definitely stay here again. "
6423204,36705503,2015-06-30,9880745,Julia,"We had a great time -the cottage was perfect for our family of 3 and the location is great, only a block away from all the fun Ballard has to offer. Thank you!"
6423204,36925146,2015-07-02,34872504,Aimee,"Mark and Marti had an incredibly clean and comfortable space set up for us upon arrival. It was a great place to stay, within walking distance of several cool places in the Ballard area. We would highly recommend this place to any AirBnB guest!"
6423204,37585905,2015-07-08,27666700,Julie,We had a great stay here! There is a splash pad down the road so my toddler had a blast! The beds were very comfortable! The backyard it was relaxing sitting at the patio table! Marti and Mark were very helpful! 
6423204,38185712,2015-07-13,1859368,Renee,"The cottage is modest and simple but such a perfect location to experience the Ballard scene. My sisters and I slept like babies in this quiet, comfy spot. Thank you!"
6423204,38513684,2015-07-16,4337601,Sushiil,"My parents stayed at this cottage so that they could attend my wedding locally.

The cottage was spacious, clean, and had everything my parents could have needed. The location is perfect-just a couple of blocks from Ballard downtown. Mark and Marti were very communicative throughout the process. I highly recommend staying here if you get the chance!"
6423204,39637703,2015-07-25,6823848,Ursula,"The cottage was not as attractive as the photos and description.  It was very clean and is cute.  However, it is in serious need of many repairs.   With some sprucing up and maintenance it would be a much nicer rental.   Windows did not open and front and back door let in all the bugs when open.   The neighborhood was disappointing and somewhat dumpy.  "
6423204,41147791,2015-08-04,9319783,Dave,"Great experience, highly recommended"
6423204,41646255,2015-08-08,34651902,Krista,"The listing was accurate, the location was great!  We could have done a lot more in the house but we spent a lot of time exploring Seattle.  "
6423204,42165826,2015-08-11,6882507,Daniel,"We loved our stay in this rustic cottage right in Ballard. It sure is a gem in the midst of all the modern apartments going up all around! Our expectations about the house were right on, since it is well advertised that it is an old house, clean on the inside and a little crusty on the outside. It served us well as a place to sleep at night and take some rest during the day, while being right in the heart of town. Mark checked in with us often to make sure we were set up and had all we need. The only thing we had to do to prepare the house for our 1 year old explorer was to move some items up and put in outlet protectors. Simple, cozy, cabin like feel. Reminded me of going to my grandma's lake house."
6423204,42896212,2015-08-16,6707168,Mark & Rosemary,"The cottage was clean, with everything we needed. The location is very central in Ballard, close to restaurants, coffee shops, bars, boutiques, and a great farmers' market. We had a good time.

As honestly stated in the property description, the cottage looks run-down from the outside, although it is very charming on the inside. A bit of yard work and a coat of paint would help a lot to improved the curb appeal and perhaps discourage some of the homeless that congregate in this area."
6423204,44146162,2015-08-24,28071337,Martin, We had a great stay at the cottage - we had everything we needed and mark and Marti were very helpful and resourceful - we would stay there again for sure ...
6423204,44738437,2015-08-28,6884566,Joel,"Mark and Marti were warm and welcoming hosts, making sure we had everything we needed; they also had the initiative to call and confirm our plans which was much appreciated.  Planning a holiday for family takes quite a bit of work and i was happy that staying at Mark's house, his attentiveness really took a load off my mind.  The interior of the house is, as mentioned, very well kept and clean - it is also very functional and the kitchen utensils are modern and new.  We had a great time at the place, and thank Mark for hosting us!"
6423204,45276794,2015-09-01,7303429,Brian,"Mark and Marti were great, responsive, nice. The place was in a fantastic location, and very well-maintained. We didn't see an ironing board (we were here for a wedding), asked them about it, and they dropped an iron and an ironing board off same-day. It would have still been a great stay even if they hadn't been able to do that, but it just speaks to the kind of nice and helpful people they are. Other than that, the place was exactly what we were looking for: a great and comfortable base of operations in a great location/neighborhood. We'd stay here again for sure."
6423204,45635651,2015-09-04,18945122,Chelsea,"We had a great time in Seattle and the house in Ballard was in a wonderful location with lots of brilliant restaurants, bars and shops. The house had plenty of space for our party of three and we were very comfortable during our stay."
6423204,46053919,2015-09-07,1527529,Victoria,"We had a great long weekend in the Ballard. Great location.   Plenty of coffee shops, restaurants, etc. within just a few blocks.  Nearby grocery store and well equipped kitchen made cooking easy.  Everything very clean.  We traveled with our toddler and the 2nd small bedroom was great for him.  There is a small playground in the neighborhood.   The bathroom is quite small but functional and clean.  We'd definitely stay again."
6423204,47017639,2015-09-14,322873,Laura,"Mark and Marti provided all of the necessary information for an easy check-in. Although they weren't onsite, we had everything we needed for the stay. The house had a lot of charm and was clean. The biggest appeal was it's proximity to Old Town Ballard (2 blocks), which was great for exploring. "
6423204,47226917,2015-09-16,17610694,Scott,We showed up a little early which was our bad - been on the road for 3 weeks now so our timing is off. The house is super cool and in a perfect location. It's got everything you need and the hosts were quick to respond and didn't bother us at all once we were in the home. I loved Seattle and the neighborhood. So great. 
6423204,47435654,2015-09-18,44129208,Jade,"Great hosts! Very quick and thorough communication. Set us up perfectly for our stay. Their small, quaint cottage was perfect for our needs and made our stay in Seattle feel a bit more authentic. Ballard is a beautiful little area not too far from downtown destinations. Two places in that area we really enjoyed were Caffe Fiore and Morsel (insane biscuits). All around, we were very pleased with our stay!"
6423204,47774896,2015-09-21,2484070,Nathan,"Mark and Marti's cottage was perfect for our 3 night stay in Seattle.  The space was exactly as described and everything was set up for our arrival.  The cottage is well furnished and very comfortable.  The location is the perfect place to stay and enjoy all that Seattle has to offer without being in the hustle of downtown.  There are countless restaurants, coffee shops, and bars within a five minute walk of the cottage.  We loved our time and would be sure to book here again!  Thanks!"
6423204,48125139,2015-09-23,3904755,"Heather, Mike & Eleni","The house is so comfortable and cute, it is perfect for 2 or 3 people.  The kitchen was outfitted well for cooking.   You could stay here for a long or short term stay.  Described accurately, the hosts are very welcoming.  We appreciated how clean it was.  Would definitely stay here again, it was a great value.   "
6423204,48362019,2015-09-25,2742285,Carolina,thanks for the smoothe communication! my brother and father enjoyed the house! 
6423204,48758073,2015-09-28,20268754,Sarah,"This cottage was exactly as described and was perfect for a weekend getaway.  We love Ballard and have never stayed so close to the ""main drag"".  It was wonderful to be able to walk to restaurants, shops, coffeeshops and the Ballard Farmer's Market.  "
6423204,48969549,2015-09-29,1652945,Sue Nell,"Easy check-in, great location for access to Ballard, Fremont, the Locks,  delicious restaurants and shops. Very spacious and clean inside."
6423204,49145000,2015-10-01,43269979,Ken,Nice cottage with convenience and privacy. The check-in process is absolutely easy. Many restaurants and bars within 2 blocks. Probably the best QFC in 1.5 blocks. Overall a very good choice.
6423204,49724651,2015-10-05,19584929,Liz,"We loved our stay at Mark and Marti's cottage! The location was unbeatable, walking distance to restaurants, cafes, shops, and grocery stores. Ballard is an awesome neighborhood. Great communication, quick to respond. Cottage was very clean and comfortable, exactly as described, lots of space and even a little backyard area. Thanks Mark and Marti!"
6423204,51471961,2015-10-20,6688169,Thomas,"Roberta and Dan we're very nice. The cottage was awesome and in great condition. Many windows (and screens to keep the bugs out). The place is very private, quite, and surrounded by trees. You feel like you are at a lake resort but only 10 minutes drive from the hippest of Seattle's neighborhoods. We enjoyed listening to the many ducks and paddle-boating on the lake. However, our canoeing adventure quickly became a swimming adventure. Getting in a canoe is harder than it looks, but at least we have an embarrassing story to tell."
6423204,52352302,2015-10-28,33054585,Dustin,Perfect charming cottage in the heart of Ballard. My 4 year old son even loved his room with the bed. Hat tip for the hosts having the place decorated for Halloween too!
6423204,52534465,2015-10-30,46965112,Dennis,Everything was well documented and easy.  A great place in a great neighborhood.  
6423204,54251875,2015-11-17,37092566,Eva,"The cottage was lovely, and just as described in the listing.  It is quite convenient to all the great stores, coffee houses, etc. in Ballard.  We especially liked having off-street parking.  "
6423204,54448031,2015-11-20,3484556,Sadie,"Great location and good place for the price. The house was a bit musty, but otherwise quite comfortable. "
6423204,54823863,2015-11-23,22931712,Jessica,"The home was just as described. Very charming and clean just a few minutes walk to the bus stop, grocery store, and restaurants. Mark and Marti were so thoughtful they provided umbrellas, the discount card to the grocery store and growlers so you can fill up at the local brewery. These little details made you feel like you were at home. Would definitely stay again when I return to Seattle."
6423204,55984316,2015-12-07,50148117,Nora,Very nice cottage\and location was ecelent in Ballard
6423204,56703771,2015-12-16,36355261,Yabin,The 1919 Cottage offers exactly what it is told to be.  Very cozy and comfy.  One of kind experience. 
6423204,57075791,2015-12-21,4869864,Roxy,Great place to stay! Charming and homey. Quiet but still close to the main part if Ballard. A wonderful full kitchen and their awesome comfy couch were highlights. Also they have a driveway for you to park which is really convenient. 
6423204,57255255,2015-12-23,7860282,Tawnya,"We loved this little cottage (one of the last houses on the block not turned into massive, multi-unit condos) and it was perfect for me and my daughter.  Cozy, yet plenty of room.  We appreciated the thoughtful details like umbrellas (which we used!).  We would absolutely want to stay here the next time we visit friends in Ballard! "
6423204,57555254,2015-12-27,37697536,Pam,"""Charming"" is the perfect word to describe this cottage. The common areas were awesome for a home this size. Location was terrific and within walking distance to great shops and restaurants. Marti and Mark supplied all essentials necessary for a comfortable stay and were responsive to all our needs.
"
3697351,16532717,2014-07-28,18842735,Matthias,"Jakub was a very nice host. He is super friendly and he is willing to either show you around or leave you alone completely, however you wish. He is a talkative guy and the room is exactly what he advertised. You can use the kitchen and fridge if you wanted to and also the bathroom is spotless. The appartment is located around 5-10 minutes by foot from space needle and also 5-10 minutes from the pike place market. The neighbourhood is very nice and seems safe to me. "
3697351,16599250,2014-07-29,1778973,John,Jakub was very accommodating of my last-minute request to stay at his place. It's a nice apartment building in a great location. Jakub couldn't be any nicer or enthusiastic. I enjoyed my brief stay and appreciated the good night's sleep.
3697351,16643841,2014-07-30,6452709,Shekhar,I had the opportunity to stay with Jakub for one night (which amounted to approximately 7-8 hrs total. I flew into Seattle at night and had plans to leave early the next morning for the Olympic National Forest to do some hiking. I did not want to spend a ton of money on a hotel so I chose to stay with Jakub. His apartment is as advertised…minimalistic. However this fit my needs perfectly. Jakub was extremely gracious and friendly. He allowed me to sleep on his floor mattress while he slept on the floor with a sleeping bag. I felt like I got to know him fairly well considering I was only there for about an hour of waking time. Jakub also lives in a very nice part of the city within close proximity to bars and restaurants. He is not far from Pikes Place and there is a view of the space needle from his window. If an inexpensive crash pad in a nice neighborhood with a gracious host is what you are looking for than this is the place for you!
3697351,16692049,2014-07-31,3712040,Umesh,"Great location! Clean apartment! Excellent company! Jakub's apartment is a gem located in the heart of the Seattle downtown area. Easy access to all the great Seattle spots as well as transportation. Jakub is an excellent host. He was timely with his responses and made me feel very comfortable in his apartment. I will definitely stay here again, and I highly recommend his place to others that are interested in visiting Seattle!"
3697351,17016978,2014-08-05,18840641,Spencer,Jakub is the best! Really great guy and very generous with his place. Very very good price and a prime location. Jakub was very flexible with our hours and taught us a great card game called Flux. Would definitely go back and stay if I were in Seattle. 10/10.
3697351,17121705,2014-08-07,10801499,Jem,"Staying with Jakub was awesome. It was exactly as described and the Japanese style mat was very comfortable. He was very hospitable, offered us food etc. He also laid out a foam mat and sleeping bag for my sister. We all ended up hanging out together and going to a mariners game. I would definitely recommend Jakub place to people who want to have an awesome experience in Seattle!"
3697351,17237109,2014-08-09,16839327,Morgan,Jakub was very friendly and accommodating. His place is clean and comfortable and the location is great for exploring downtown Seattle. 
3697351,17322470,2014-08-10,16350848,Julien,"Jakub's place was exactly as described - minimalist and comfortable. It's in a very convenient downtown location close to Pike Place market and you can see the space needle from the window.

The best part was Jakub. He took his evening to give me a personalized tour of Seattle with some amazing views (and trolls!) and made for some great conversation. Thanks again!"
3697351,17388005,2014-08-11,18140729,Huimin,Jakub is a nice and helpful host. His apartment is very close to every attraction in downtown. The great view of Space Needle in the apartment is a bonus. 
3697351,17527771,2014-08-13,18140729,Huimin,Jakub is a very nice and helpful host. The location is perfect which is walkable to most of the downtown attractions. In the apartment we can enjoy the beautiful view of Space Needle. I really enjoy my stay here. 
3697351,18345114,2014-08-25,19143423,Jeffrey,"Jakub was a great host! Since his place just has one main room where we slept, we had quite a bit of conversation and even played Dominion a few times. He was very kind and hospitable.

His place is conveniently located in Belltown, close to a number of nice restaurants, among other things like the original Starbucks, the Space Needle, etc. I was surprised how many times I mapped something and realized how close it was. Walking to Seattle's international district on the other side of downtown is easily doable as well. The photo on his listing is accurate, and the bed (futon?) he provides is quite comfy.

Would definitely stay again."
3697351,18891179,2014-09-02,18824211,Marty,Jakub was very friendly and accommodating. The location is amazing and close to everything. Better than a hostel.
3697351,19135107,2014-09-07,17419990,Jean-François,Vraiment bien situé. Super accueil. Super Sympathique. Je le recommande!!!
3697351,19276646,2014-09-09,19465180,Georgina,The room is exactly like it is depicted on the Website and it is in a great location. Both downtown and the Space Needle Area are about 10-15 minutes away by foot. Jakub is a friendly Host that will help you out with directions and other questions that you may have. also the wifi is fantastic.
3697351,19482868,2014-09-13,20453861,Charlene,"The apart is in a in a perfect location, close to almost everywhere like pike market space needle and many museums. Jakob are really friendly and helps me a lot .He even took me to explore a great park and we saw a super beautiful view. I will recommend anyone who try to visit Seattle to live in his place."
3697351,19543462,2014-09-14,7184229,Alok,"Jakub was an awesome host! Very flexible, and went out of his way to make sure I was comfortable. Thanks!"
3697351,19613333,2014-09-15,1874121,Annie,"Jakub's place is exactly as advertised.  My boyfriend and I slept on the floor - one of us got a mattress and the other a sleeping bag. Both of us had no trouble sleeping. Jakub was responsive via email prior to the trip and met us at the door when we arrived, as promised. He recommended a great place to grab a coffee and donut. That was about the extent to our trip - short and sweet. Thanks for the place to crash, Jakub!"
3697351,19702780,2014-09-16,2568900,Jayson,I had a short one night stay at Jakub's place. He was a great host and was really friendly.
3697351,19892172,2014-09-20,14142536,Samantha,"A nice home base to explore Seattle since it as about 4 blocks (10-15 min walk) away from pubic transportation. It is also really just 5 blocks away from the Pike Place Market. 

However, the room was really small and there was an additional 2 people and 2 dogs staying there that we did not know of. The host failed to inform us of that earlier. Also, the tenant before us only left after 7pm that day. Which meant that we pretty much spent day 1 with no key access to the place. 

Also, the sheets were not fresh. After the previous tenants left, we used the same ones (not washed) and it seemed to be the same for the next tenants that arrived after us. 

The bathroom also seemed like it wasn't washed for a really long while. The stains on the sink and the tub seemed to indicated so. "
3697351,20261187,2014-09-26,5409563,Bilal,"Jakub was a good host. The place was as expected, and super close to downtown. I was slightly surprised when there was 2 other people crashing there when I arrived, but they were Jakub's friends and were really friendly so wasn't a problem."
3697351,20391479,2014-09-28,11776362,Shalaka,I had an enjoyable time hanging out with Jakub and his room-mates!
3697351,20690786,2014-10-04,14953816,Song Lee,great location. 
3697351,20751427,2014-10-05,20313075,Ian,Perfect location. It was exactly what I needed. Jakub is a great host!
3697351,20960270,2014-10-08,21105880,Lyn,"Good location, accurate listing description. Jakub is a great host - accommodating, friendly, easy to talk to. This wasn't an issue but it would have been nice to know he had another roommate and two dogs. I definitely recommend!"
3697351,21008412,2014-10-09,21362523,Raisa,"Jakub is a nice guy. I was at his place for 1 night. I walked to almost everywhere. Some of the places are pike market, space needle, downtown, the showbox (concert area) and many more. "
3697351,21290752,2014-10-14,10736266,Tiancheng,"Jakub is friendly. He is very nice to accommodate you and make you feel comfortable. The location is awesome. You can see the space needle from the window and 5 min away to the Pike Place Market. BTW, he has 2 little dogs. So if you are afraid of dogs, that might be a small problem. But other part is good!"
3697351,21948404,2014-10-27,12191048,Joel,"Jakub was a super host, very helpful, accommodating and was always up for a chat."
3697351,22090691,2014-10-29,22392970,Jia,"It was my great pleasure to stay in Jakub's place. He is a very nice and friendly person, his apartment is on the heart of Seattle. Almost every places are walking distance, seeing Space Needle from his place was one of the advatages."
3697351,22425122,2014-11-06,1559105,Stephann,"Jakub and Kelsey were friendly, helpful and accommodating and I thoroughly enjoyed my stay with them. A short walk from the light rail and downtown, nightlife within a block or two. You couldn't ask for a better location. I'd also like to point out that Jakub really does take his reviews seriously - he's acted on improvement suggestions from other reviewers and I believe the photos and his thorough listing details are fair descriptions of what you should expect. You must have some expectation management though - don't expect a 5* ensuite hotel room with maid service. Instead, expect a friendly experience that a hotel couldn't provide."
3697351,22540146,2014-11-09,22573321,Morgan,Jakub and Kelsey were wonderful hosts. Their location near Pike Place cannot be beat. Our sheets and sleeping bag were freshly cleaned when we arrived. We were able to come and go from the apartment as we pleased. 
3697351,22791609,2014-11-15,20908877,Alec,"Jakub was so, so, so nice and unbelievably accommodating! We were in town for a concert and unfortunately we didn't have much time to chat due to time  constraints that night, but Jakub's home is lovely and the sleeping arrangements he provided made for an overwhelmingly comfortable stay. It was incredibly brief but it was absolutely perfect for what we needed--we couldn't be more grateful! "
3697351,22921481,2014-11-17,23124980,태웅,"Good host, Good location
He is so kind."
3697351,23047823,2014-11-21,23594123,Sam,"I had an amazing time staying with Jakub and his roommate Kelsey. They are two very kind hearted, helpful and friendly people. The conversations were amazing and the atmosphere was relaxed. Each night I felt like I was at a friends house for a sleepover. It was always friendly and lighthearted,their cute dogs helped too! I will definitely be back to Seattle to stay there again! I arrived early and it was no issue and One night, I came home late and they waited up to make sure I was comfortable to get into bed without waking them. Perfect location and perfect hosts. Way better than any hotel! :) Thanks again guys!"
3697351,23160307,2014-11-24,22693176,Tracy,"Wish Jaukub would've gave us prior knowledge that he was sick as well as had two little dogs. The shared room was very messy and the smell was atrocious. Tried to stay out of apartment as long as possible to avoid the mess and smell. However, on the positive side, Jakub is very nice. "
3697351,23492268,2014-12-02,21472431,Dominic,"Cosy apartment in a great part of town. Close to everything you'll want to see. Jakub was a kind and friendly host, who was happy to help with anything a asked. Anyone would be happy to have Jakub as a host."
3697351,23548913,2014-12-04,15186812,Kyle,"Jakob was an excellent host. I flew in rather late and he was more than accommodating. He and his roommate were both interesting and excellent conversationalists, and I very much felt at ease with them. The place was comfortable and well situated in the city.  "
3697351,23672413,2014-12-07,24343632,Benjamin,The space was intimate.  Jakub was very accommodating in the sharing of food.  I slept well.
3697351,23761266,2014-12-09,19569623,Tracey,"My aunt and I stayed at Jakub's during the beginning of December for two nights. Jakub greeted us at the door and was friendly and accommodating. 

PROS: Great location. Jakub's place was in the center of downtown and was walking distance to pike's place which we walked to every morning. We were also walking distance to west lake mall and space needle. Although we used uber when it was dark out. 

Jakub and his housemate were nice although we didn't spend much time at his place. He provided us with a twin bed and a sleeping bag just as stated. 

CONS: My aunt loves dogs but not where she sleeps. Jakub's roommate has two small dogs. There was a slight dog smell upon opening the door and she wasn't too happy with it. Half the time they were locked up but the other half they were running around. I didn't mind too much. 

Other that that, great location friendly host! If you don't mind dogs, I would recommend his place for a short stay.

3697351,23806978,2014-12-10,5553545,Yvonne,"The host is easy to communicate,  room have smell to me. Location is great! Roommates are quiet and easy going. "
3697351,23915475,2014-12-14,17267591,Falguni,Jakub was very nice. The location of his apartment was good because it was close to a lot of the tourist attraction sites. This place is good for someone who doesn't plan on staying indoors and is looking for a cheap place to crash after a long day. 
3697351,24042173,2014-12-17,14381138,Alexandre,"Awesome stay ! Jakub accepted me in a very short notice without any problem. The place is comfortable and very well located.

Jakub is really nice and interresting.
Definitly a place where I could come back. "
3697351,24205645,2014-12-22,21734069,Hitomi,"The location is very convenient for travelers to sightsee and the price is reasonable, so I could enjoy my stay in Seattle and save my money! Also, Jakub is friendly and his roommate is quiet. There were two small lovely dogs. That was never problems for me."
3697351,24256054,2014-12-23,25015921,Vincent,Exactly what I was looking for for one night. Gave me his Wi-Fi-password. All in all really friendly!
3697351,24465345,2014-12-29,15087806,Sil,"Jakub is very easy to communicate and also fun to talk with.  The location of the apartment is also very close to all of the tourist attraction places and the public transportation as well. The only difficulty for me is the sleeping bag that i found difficult to sleep with without a pillow, else everything is perfect! My friend got the futon with the pillow but i got the sleeping bag. If you ever travel along with a friend, one of you would have to sleep with the sleeping bag. Jakub has also 2 dogs in the apartment and a roommate."
3697351,25035281,2015-01-05,20734807,Pau,Jakub and his roommate were great hosts. His place is in an awesome location for the price. We were three sleeping in the same room and I didn't have any problem with noises. There are two small dogs in the apartment that are lovely. If you want to save money in a short stay in Seattle Jakub's is perfect.
3697351,25184278,2015-01-08,25416387,Carlito,Great location and great price.
3697351,25352612,2015-01-13,13489378,Williamed,"Jakub is a really great host! Very kind, friendly and hospitable. His apartment is ideal for a short stay, its clean and comfortable and you get full use of the kitchen. Really well located if your planning to do the tourist thing in Seattle, so close to the market and surrounded by great bars, shops, restaurants. Also super close to Westlake station if your travelling from SeaTac. 

Its a great little spot and its super cheap. Would definitely recommend staying with Jakub! "
3697351,25480512,2015-01-17,7845251,Alex,Great place to stay. My friend slept on the mattress and I used the sleeping bag. The dogs were really cute. In a very walkable part of town close to many things to see perfect as a place to crash for the price. Jakub and his roommate were very friendly and accommodating.
3697351,25531952,2015-01-18,5423284,Angele,"Jakub does his best to make you comfortable and hosts people like they are friends, he will do his best to accommodate you even if you are requesting last minute. I am glad I stayed there. Plus, the price is fair and the location is amazing!
Everyone sleeping on the same floor was not nearly as weird as I thought it might be, since everyone is so nice and the bed and room is so comfy. I recommend staying here!"
3697351,25640660,2015-01-21,25177842,Masashi,"Jakub and his roommate are very nice people. They help me and dinner with me. I love them.
Thanks a lot! My friend!"
3697351,25665072,2015-01-22,25660122,Joe,Great location and gracious host! My only regret is not having more time chatting with Jakub.
3697351,25786934,2015-01-26,21118607,Katie,"The location of Jacobs flat is fantastic, close to all of Seattle's attractions and near to public transport- a really good price considering! Jacob was very helpful at organising our check in, as he was out for the day. 
The bed was comfy, a little of a squeeze for 2 people but there is also a foam mattress if you are traveling in a 2. 
The only downside is the cleanliness of the bathroom, it needs improving!
Perfect for a nights stay to visit Seattle, thanks Jacob."
3697351,25905482,2015-01-29,15298896,相田,"Actually, I was nice to me who did not understand English well.
It was a trip to very good Seattle.
英語が分からない私でも、とても親切にしてくれました。とても良い方です！"
3697351,26100973,2015-02-03,25150481,Mariya-Andoniya,"Great location and unbeatable price. Jacob and his roommate were super accommodating and nice. I'm a classical musician and was in town over the weekend for an audition. On the day of my audition Jacob let me practice in the room all morning and he and his roommate went out to give me some privacy. 
If you don't mind sharing a room with two more people and don't seek the privacy go ahead and book. "
3697351,26166398,2015-02-05,15499773,Meredith,Jakub and his roommate were hospitable and helpful for my boyfriend and I who were visiting the city. They gave us great suggestions and we always felt welcome. We loved the dogs too!
3697351,26329365,2015-02-09,3878159,Cory,This was a great location downtown. For the price you could not ask for more. Jakub was great to communicate with and made getting into his apartment very easy. 
3697351,26492133,2015-02-14,7010902,Tony,"Jakub's place is conveniently located in downtown Seattle, close to Belltown and Pike Place market."
3697351,26871352,2015-02-21,24802406,Yanxi,Really good location and very nice host !! Good experience
3697351,26966867,2015-02-22,10981763,Rosslyn,Jakub and his roommate were both friendly and accommodating. And the doggies were super cute :) The shikibuton was super comfortable!
3697351,27400470,2015-03-03,21707281,Aaron & Jon,"I had a great time. Jakub and Kelsey are a lot of fun, and the puppies are adorable. The location is ideal for exploring downtown Seattle. The mattress is surprisingly comfy. I slept well every night. I would 100% rent if I were in Seattle again."
3697351,27741764,2015-03-10,21819667,Shannan,"Perfect location for walking around the city. Jakub made my check-in extremely easy and stress free. The bed was also super comfortable and his roommate was nice enough to aid in tips for enjoying the city. I would highly recommend this place and, if willing, hopefully stay at Jakub's again."
3697351,27842179,2015-03-13,125499,Eitan,"I had an excellent stay at Jakub's place. I was warmly welcomed to the apartment and immediately given a key to the place. The location is very central, close to major attractions and light rail station. The studio apartment is cozy and the mattress comfortable. The two small dogs are very friendly and stay in their cage when needed. I definitely recommend."
3697351,27971734,2015-03-15,12251931,Meghan,Great location. Apartment is minimal but that was perfect for us! Dogs were cute and hosts were friendly. Four is a bit of a squeeze but totally worth it.
3697351,28304006,2015-03-22,25777411,Yeongmo,It was my first time and it was really good he is friendly and helped me a lot to get some information about seattle I recommend you to stay here
3697351,29473060,2015-04-07,28452678,Belle,It's very cheap and reasonable at this price point.  It is a mattress on a floor in what feels like a college dorm room.  Nothing wrong with that as long as you know it's what you're getting.  Never met Jakub but he was very responsive via text.
3697351,29908922,2015-04-14,8235634,William,"My stay was fine. The location is very good (can't get much better than that). If you like dogs, is OK with not having a clean and organized place, and don't care about sleeping on a mattress on the floor, this is THE airbnb option for you. If you are looking for a on-a-budget place, this is also a good airbnb option for you."
3697351,30113506,2015-04-17,17788745,Simon,"Jakub was very friendly and responsive and welcomed us with a some cookies. Although the room needs a clean and looked much tidier on the picture. I didn't used the kitchen, because I had no need for it; neither I used the bathroom, because I didn't felt hygienic enough for my usually rather low demands. And guys, you gotta do something about that smell!"
3697351,30874790,2015-04-28,29388697,Jared,This is a great place for a great price. If you are looking for just the basics. Jakub is a great guy!!!
3697351,31186048,2015-05-03,17489348,Hannah,"Jakub and his roommate was very friendly and helpful.I had a excellent stay in 
his apartment.Close to major attraction just a few mins walk.Recommend to you for a great place & great price"
3697351,31613012,2015-05-07,31744102,Derek,Jakub was very gracious in his accommodations and was very easy to talk to. His apartment also has a great view of the space needle and access to a lot of nightlife nearby. Would definitely stay here again.
3697351,31728550,2015-05-09,16404629,Houshun,"It was a really pleasant experience staying w Jakub while I was in Seattle. He's a really friendly guy and will do his utmost to make you comfortable at his place. And the location of his apartment is really superb, it takes only 5 mins to walk to Pike Place Market. Definitely a good bang for the buck!"
3697351,32517331,2015-05-19,30449489,Sarah,I had a great time staying at Jakub's. Him and his roommate were very friendly and provided a lot of privacy despite the close living quarters. The space is cheap and simple but it's in a boss neighbourhood (walking distance of everything in downtown) with a fantastic view of the space needle so if that's what you're looking for I would certainly recommend you!
3697351,32695119,2015-05-20,30840806,Alyne,"Jakub replies timely and professionally to all communications and is such a nice guy - fixed me a bowl of his pecan granola with blueberries and bananas!
Great location - walking distance to many of Seattle's finest."
3697351,33474360,2015-05-28,33830450,Martin,Jakub is a very nice and pleasant guy. It was a pleasure to meet him. The flat is in the perfect area for exploring the city. Everything was very uncomplicated like getting the key and coming and going whenever you want.
3697351,33906315,2015-06-02,7744511,Tamara,I felt very welcome by the host and his roommate; and the location is great.
3697351,34284824,2015-06-07,19932415,Jonathan,"The room was as advertised, very cozy and in a great location for an amazing price. Jakub and his roommate are extremely nice and accommodating. I found the puppies adorable since I've owned pets, but if you are someone who never owned pets or does not like animal smells,  you may be a bit bothered."
3697351,34655300,2015-06-10,19031658,C,"This is a solid bare essential place. If you're ok with dogs, a funky smell, and a dirty college roommate feel. Be aware if what you're getting yourself into! His roommate was friendly and provided a lot of privacy despite the close living quarters and the location is unbeatable!"
3697351,35456880,2015-06-19,30345822,Rohit,The location of a place is excellent and it's very easy to go around Seattle from there. Jacob wasn't present when i arrived and the place was really messy. He came back after 2 days and had put efforts to clean it up. Both Jacob his roommate are really very friendly and welcoming. I had a good stay and have no complains apart from the fact that the place was very messy. 
3697351,35657566,2015-06-21,7903863,Alethea And Tyson,"The place was exactly as described. Some might call it squishy, as it is only a studio and there are 3 mattresses on the ground, but it didn't bother us. It is perfect if you are looking for a simple, inexpensive place to sleep in a super convienent location. :-)"
3697351,38562878,2015-07-16,13453187,John,"Jakub's roommates were friendly and accommodating when I got there. If you don't mind sharing a small efficiency with a couple of other people, this is a good deal for the location ..."
3697351,38598782,2015-07-17,14074894,Elodie,"very nice place to stay, very well located!
we didn't meet Jakub but he made everithing so that we feel at home!"
3697351,38794358,2015-07-18,21659915,Ty,Very communicative about check-in/check-out. Perfectly friendly and helpful - no complaints. 
3697351,39092813,2015-07-20,34230604,Rebecca,"It was exactly what the photos and description said it was going to be. He is an awesome host! I would recommend staying here. Plus, there's a cool view of the Space Needle! "
3697351,40139485,2015-07-28,19654156,Frank,Jakub was a friendly and informative host.   The place was just as described.  
3697351,40592980,2015-08-01,7511440,Woo Jun,everything was great and clean. the bed was comfortable.
3697351,41122206,2015-08-04,3630696,Bryon,"Jakob was very easy to work with, always accessible and the apartment was as shown in the picture. Two other guests stayed while I was there and they had 2 dogs. As such, there were some issues with cleanliness from the pets, but other than that everything was as expected. I even forgot an item at the apartment and Jakob let me get it hours after check-out, which I really appreciated. "
3697351,41351347,2015-08-07,8029207,Ashley,"Jakub was away while we stayed, but his roommates were very helpful and welcoming. The place is in a great location, we walked everywhere! The roommates had great suggestions for food and things to do. There's plenty of maps and info for guests. I stayed here with my friend and we both fit comfortably on the bed. The dogs are a definite plus- they are so adorable!! "
3697351,42319204,2015-08-12,39311271,Michael,I wanted a nice place to stay just a few nights and this was perfect. It's right next to several main attractions like Pike's Place and the Space Needle. A place to sleep and shower were provided and that's all I needed!
3697351,42563511,2015-08-14,38519503,Austin,"The room was very small and cozy. There's no privacy except in the bathroom, but that worked out well because Jakub and his roommates take their time to know their guests. Both Jakub and his roommates were very friendly and inviting. They answered any questions we had and were both interesting to talk to. Jakub was very accommodating to our travel needs. He was flexible and allowed us store our luggage past the check out time.  Overall, it was a pleasant stay."
3697351,44160931,2015-08-24,1130897,Jose,"This was a wonderful place to stay. Located right in downtown, everything was close by. Jakub was very warm and welcoming and helped out very much. He had print outs of tourist attractions and points of interest. 12/10 would stay again!"
3697351,45365931,2015-09-02,3120691,Hutch,"Nice, minimal space in an ideal location downtown. Great host, great value."
3697351,45703470,2015-09-05,18471364,Casey,"Jakubs places was perfect for what we were looking for. He provided all the basics. We just need a place to sleep for 1 night and it was fine. Location couldn't have been any better, and Jakub coudnt have been more on point. Very nice and helpful."
3697351,45904235,2015-09-06,16758323,Austin,Jakub was welcoming and his apartment is quite well represented by his photos. He was friendly and talked with us about Seattle and provided helpful suggestions.
3697351,46263182,2015-09-09,20026485,Greg,"Jakub was a great host and the accomodation was exactly as advertised.  We slept on one side of the room on a dense mattress on the floor, and Jakub slept on the other side of the room.  He had helpful signs placed here and there that let us know the location of clean towels and dishes etc.  The location in Belltown is fantastic.  The neighbourhood felt safe.  Jakub's place was clean and he was very accommodating with our schedule.  He had no problem with our coming and going at any hour.  We will request to book Jakub's place again in the future."
3697351,48297897,2015-09-25,41321857,Romana,Jakub was a perfect host. Very good location :)

3697351,50185028,2015-10-10,42805076,Stephanie,"Great location! Extremely central & close to major attractions (i.e. Space Needle, Chihuly Gardens, Pike Place Market, 1st Starbucks, Kerry Park & Grey's Anatomy's Meredith Gray's fictional home). Place was clean and just as advertised in the posting. Jakub was great in having the apartment labeled accordingly, making it easy to identify your areas of use. Also, he was very easy to communicate with and made our stay incredibly easy and comfortable. If you are looking for a place to crash while you are in Seattle, I highly recommend that you give Jakub's place a try!"
3697351,50639391,2015-10-13,21268700,Emma,My boyfriend and I stayed with Jakub for one night. Everything was exactly as it appeared in the listing and Jakub was very welcoming and accommodating!
3697351,50821117,2015-10-14,44938506,Catherine,Jakub was very welcoming and helpful. Ideal place to stay given its location. 
3697351,50892919,2015-10-15,46101968,Ivy,"Jakub's apartment was in a great location and is advertised exactly as is. Everything in the apartment was easy to find and it had a beautiful view! Three of us fit very comfortably there and when we woke up in the morning we could walk to many amazing places. Also, Jakub was a great guy and we had fun talking to him."
3697351,50940658,2015-10-16,13902742,Hilary,"Great location and super comfortable mattress! If you are looking for a place to sleep and not anything more, Jakub's place is a good option in Seattle. "

3697351,51458840,2015-10-20,43219659,Jordyn,"Great place to stay in downtown! My friend and I both slept comfortably at jakub's place. Perfect for if you just need a place to sleep. Perfect location for sightseeing - it was easy to walk from here to anything we wanted to see downtown, and close to transit around the city and from the airport."
3697351,52968778,2015-11-03,22015816,Cat,My two friends and I stayed at Jakub's over the Halloween weekend. It was a great location and was accurate as described. 
3697351,54530932,2015-11-21,10178744,Kelsey,Jakub gives really awesome and clear directions on how to check-in. It was really easy. The arrangement is exactly as his post says. Really convenient location!
3697351,54614096,2015-11-22,46520126,Lindsay,"Felt very welcome, just like home. Perfect downtown location, easy to find and navigate being unfamiliar with Seattle. "

3697351,55822341,2015-12-06,21506951,Alma,"The listing was completely accurate and Jakub was kind enough to let us check in significantly later than we had initially projected. Both hosts are excellent conversation partners! The water pressure was great in the shower. All in all, it was totally worth it, a great stay!"
6512378,33549276,2015-05-29,34067364,Rebecca Gift,Our hosts were absolutely wonderful. Super accommodating and welcoming. This was our first time with Airbnb and we were extremely pleased. We would definitely recommend Art and Jamie to anyone we know staying in Seattle:-)
6512378,34662464,2015-06-10,34198406,Gilbert,"Very comfortable stay!  I was attending a conference and did little more than sleep at the Quiet Place, so didn't get to interact with Art and Jamie much, but the little contact we had was very pleasant.  Would love to have spent some time on their deck!  Lot's of interesting plants, too!  Thanks to both for being excellent hosts!"
6512378,41604714,2015-08-08,16926812,Charles,"Art and Jamie made me very welcome in their home for my three week long stay.  I was taking classes that required me to leave the home very early, and sometimes, to return very late.  Art and Jamie were very accommodating and very kind, and I never got the notion that my schedule caused them any problems.  The room was very comfortable, the bed was great.  Art has a very nice collection of books, and I made it 2/3 of the way through his copy of Walden before I left.  I had full access to the kitchen and sufficient space in the refrigerator for my needs.  I had interesting conversations with each of my hosts, and like them very much.  The neighborhood is relatively high density with a lot of cars parked on the street, but I had no problem finding a nearby place to park.  Because of the hilly terrain and the stairways into the home and up to the bedrooms, this is not a rental for someone with difficulty walking or climbing.  There aren't any restaurants in easy walking distance, but there is a really nice Italian place that I discovered on my last night.  Ask Art for directions.  All in all, this was an excellent rental that met all my needs and was a pleasure besides."
6512378,42289868,2015-08-12,18297413,Chris,"I had a great stay with Art and Jamie. Although I was on the move and my trip to Seattle was pretty fast and furious, they offered me to eat dinner with them and coffee in the morning. 
The next day they helped me figure out the town.  Great amenities, the self controlled AC was the best part!"
6512378,43042624,2015-08-17,33683205,Brian,"Art and Jamie were very kind and great with contact, I felt very welcome in their home.
My room was very pleasant and comfortable. Cute place. I'd definitely stay with them again!"
6512378,44386648,2015-08-25,19706013,Matthew,"Art was a great host, it felt like he cared about my trip and he did a great job making me feel like I was at home. The bed was very comfortable and they were very accommodating of my late schedule."
6512378,49020235,2015-09-30,42299758,Jeremy,"Art and Jamie were great hosts. I was in town for a conference and only stayed one night, but it was very nice to relax and get a good night's sleep after a day of travel. Very accommodating and welcoming!"
6512378,49379086,2015-10-03,21409878,Sandeep,"I had a wondrous short stay at Art and Jamie's place! 

Their apartment is but a 10 min drive to all the nearby areas downtown! Art was extremely helpful and reliable during my stay. The house has a unique decor. The room is a good size, with A/C, and the bed was comfortable.

Overall, an awesome time!"
6512378,49797330,2015-10-06,40035661,David Elias,"My stay at Art & Jamie's house was really nice. Really quiet, clean, perfect."

6512378,53908688,2015-11-14,42795006,Miles,"Had a great stay at art and jamie's.  They were very flexible when I needed to alter my arrival and departure, which I appreciated.  The neighborhood is quiet, and their house is convenient to to useful bus lines.  While there aren't many stores right nearby, I found it very walkable/safe, I don't mind hills much. "
6512378,55497244,2015-12-01,39464788,Cameron,Great! 
6661617,35336370,2015-06-17,34313804,Michael,Laura's place is brand new and beautiful.  Great neighborhood and close to everything.  Don't miss the funky artist's house 1 block over. We'll be back.
6661617,35845992,2015-06-22,35007036,Holly,Laura personally gave us a tour and the townhouse was clean and comfortable.  There was designated parking but we also found street parking available.  The neighborhood was quiet and friendly.  Laura was flexible with our check in and check out times making it more comfortable for those of us with late flights.  We had a great vacation and Laura was a super hostess!
6661617,36572675,2015-06-29,34945955,Carisse,"This place was in such a lovely neighborhood and yet near enough to great restaurants, shops, and bars. The rooftop views for sunrise and sunset are an absolute must! The house itself was spacious with lovely rooms and had nice homey feel to it. Laura was a lovely host and I hope to be back soon!!!"
6661617,37766255,2015-07-10,35214661,Charlie,"Laura is a great host with a fantastic house. The townhouse was spacious, clean, and comfortable. The roof deck had plenty of seating and a wonderful view, we ate breakfast on it almost every day. 

There was an unprecedented heat wave in Seattle during our trip and Laura purchased fans for every room just before we arrived. She also gave us a tour of the house when we checked in. We will definitely be staying here again the next time we visit Seattle.
"
6661617,38071279,2015-07-12,10338174,Eric,Great house. Great location. Great host.
6661617,38558728,2015-07-16,27835758,Camilla,"“Lovely new house, beautiful space, layout and facilities, immaculately clean and the roof terrace was perfect and the parking a godsend.  Wi-Fi, Apple TV and the sunshine.  Who could ask for more. Would definitely stay again.”  "
6661617,39943238,2015-07-27,11206273,Andrew,"Laura's place was a wonderful experience.  Her three story town home was absolutely beautiful. Tucked back in a small neighborhood, it was far enough away from the crowds to provide a quiet getaway, while still being close enough to walk to many great restaurants and local bars. The view from her rooftop was breathtaking. I would highly recommend anyone visiting Seattle to check out her place. "
6661617,45250297,2015-09-01,1906618,Matt,The apartment was brand new. We were the first people to spend a full month there. Laura and Alex went out of their way to make sure we were comfortable and you could tell they cared about our happiness. The neighborhood has changed so much since I was young and we felt completely safe there. Within walking distance you have Uncle Ike's and Chuck's Hop Shop. The rooftop deck was so peaceful. I would highly recommend this listing.
6661617,46140617,2015-09-08,9972068,Julian,Our communication with Laura was great.  We arrived in Seattle and found the townhouse to be in a great location. The rooms were spacious and provided the perfect space for myself and the other three in our party. 
6661617,47738448,2015-09-21,7229825,Victoria,"My friends and I had a great time at Laura's town house. Our decision to stay here was influenced by the view from the roof, and we weren't disappointed. Fantastic place to come back to and relax at after a long day of sightseeing.  We had six people so two slept on a pull-out futon which they reported as surprisingly comfortable. Would certainly recommend staying here if you have four in your party, six if some don't mind sleeping in the same room as the kitchen."
6661617,48543899,2015-09-27,27241454,Murray,"Great location.  Clean and modern place.  
We had a very nice time at Laura's place.
Perfect for a weekend in Seattle "

6661617,51251109,2015-10-18,14996470,Jason,"The place was great - as described, clean, and comfortable.  Was a quick trip to Seattle, made all the easier and enjoyable by working with Laura and staying at her very nice home. "

6661617,54072440,2015-11-15,7117075,Amy,"Laura's house was great - good location for my family.  Her home was immaculate, comfy beds, easy keyless entry."
6661617,55031738,2015-11-27,38985694,Jordan,"Laura was amazing from the moment we booked. I reserved her home for my family over the Thanksgiving holiday and they were very impressed. Everything was clean, easy to use, and the rooftop deck was a highlight of their stay. Such a beautiful view! If I didn't already have a home in Seattle, I'd book Laura's AirBnB every time I came."
6661617,57435318,2015-12-26,809512,Kursad,"We had a wonderful  stay at Laura's house. The place was really tidy and clean! It had all of the basic needs, a nice kitchen and a living area. We would stay there again! "
1457330,15424615,2014-07-08,17053060,Ivan,"Annie was very thoughtful: extra towels, individual soaps, maps, and even groupon suggestions!  Her description of her home and the little details were extremely accurate.  This was my first Airbnb experience, and I am thrilled.  She made this such a positive experience I intend to use Airbnb for all of my tennis travels throughout the year.  "
1457330,17857818,2014-08-18,18263658,Rob,"The house was great, centrally located, clean, and convenient! Annie was great to communicate with, and I highly recommend her home. Super positive experience."
1457330,35085299,2015-06-15,1034837,Allan,"Annie's house was wonderful. My wife and I were in town for a wedding. We were joined by my parents in law and sister in law. They all enjoyed the individual rooms (especially the comfy mattresses which my father in law was very impressed by), the common spaces which encouraged conversations and tea, the great outdoor picnic table to enjoy summer meals, and the two bathrooms for preparing to head out to meet family and friends in Capitol Hill or Pioneer Square. The space was also very kid friendly, enabling us to invite our niece and nephew over for dinner and to play games in the backyard or indoors in the basement. Annie's home is also very close to some very nice local restaurants, especially in columbia city and along Rainier (our favorite from back in our graduate school days is the Taco Bus El Asadero). Although we didn't really use the kitchen for more than heating up leftovers or washing dishes, it had everything we needed to feel like home. Overall Annie and her family have a wonderful home, in a great neighborhood, and were wonderful hosts making sure we had everything we needed for our stay."
1457330,45110780,2015-08-31,38801180,Ann,"Great host! Very welcoming and we felt right at home.  Thanks, Annie!"
2027236,9431418,2013-12-28,938310,Thien,"I'm glad to be one of the first guests that Jennifer and Shawn hosted and I feel right to choose to stay with them. The place is cozy and comfortable. Jennifer and Shawn are nice and friendly, and they really work on making me feel at home. I got my own bathroom, had some nice complements in the room like snacks, fruits, etc. The room is quite isolated to the rest of the house so you'd get your privacy. The bedding stuffs are very clean and new. I'd recommend this place to my friends."
2027236,9503061,2013-12-31,9338066,Oriane,Jennifer was a great host ! We spent 2 days to her house with my boyfriend ans she was very helpful and nice ! I  warmly recommend her to everybody who wants to have a nice time in Seattle. 
2027236,9730253,2014-01-06,7335751,Leslie,"Had a lovely stay at Jennifer and Shawn’s place. The bedroom and private bathroom were comfortable, clean and welcoming, and I appreciated the private entrance. The owners were great hosts. I chose to keep to myself, as I was seeking some respite from a stressful few months and they gave me the space, while also being available for any needs/questions I had. Had I been more sociable, I would have enjoyed spending more time with them. Would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a comfortable place to stay, with warm hosts, in a very convenient location in the city. "
2027236,9918044,2014-01-19,6494849,Eric,"I stayed here with my girlfriend several weeks ago. Our stay was generally excellent. Jennifer was very hospitable, and had great suggestions for local restaurants and things to do. The room was very nice and had all the amenities anyone could want. We did have a run-in with a loud/barking dog that was temporarily in the back yard, but this was resolved quickly, and I don't think this would be an issue for future guests. "
2027236,10070258,2014-01-28,6265146,Braden,"This place was great! With it's private entrance it was very easy to get in an out without feeling like I was disturbing Jennifer or her family. 

The room was clean and warm.

Because it is a little out of the city I was happy to have my car. For the most part I drove to the Tukwila light rail station ( park-n-ride ) and took the light rail downtown. But one of the days I did take the bus which stops one street over from the house, so even if you don't have a vehicle it's easy to get around.

Thanks again Jennifer!"
2027236,10240137,2014-02-08,11658134,Tracy,Have stayed more than once with Jennifer and her family.  This is a wonderful room for a quiet stay as it has a private entrance and private bath. It's a great location as well - I work in Bellevue and it was 30-35 mins in the mornings.  I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again. Tracy A.
2027236,10570181,2014-02-25,11336399,Christian,"The apartment was in a good condition and everything was prepared and clean. 
I can recommend the place for everyone who want to visit Seattle.

2027236,10728776,2014-03-04,1020684,Sarah,We had a pleasant stay! Jennifer was beyond hospitable even when our flight was cancelled and we had to arrive much later than expected. She is a clear communicator and was available during our stay. We especially appreciated the private entrance.  
2027236,10741871,2014-03-05,7156079,Robyn,My friend and I only stayed one night and left early in the morning for our flight out. The privacy was nice so as not to disturb Jennifer and her family when we were coming and going. Beautiful area as well! 
2027236,11104309,2014-03-20,3473546,Tyler And Hannah,This was an amazing space. Tons of DIY goodness and a lot of love was put into the room. A great find for sure. 
2027236,11121580,2014-03-21,11612566,Pamela,I had a lovely time at Jennifer's home in the city.  The privacy was great and as I am a care taker for my elderly mother who is a chatter box.  The silence was wonderful  I was able to sit in the sun and knit and their sweet dog Luna came by to say Hi and was nice and not intrusive at all.  It was all I hoped to find for a get away from home near home.
2027236,11159208,2014-03-23,12967455,Daniel,"Great place to stay: quiet, convenient, clean, and comfortable."
2027236,11220445,2014-03-25,237687,Susan,"The room was a restful retreat from long walks and bustling city streets. Jennifer and Sean have thoughtfully provided fixings for coffee in the morning. The bed and pillows are super comfortable -- better than some hotels!  The views of water, the city, and surrounding coastlines from the hilly streats are amazing!  Charming neighborhood restaurant (Pulcinella) was a walk away on 10003 Rainer Avenue South.  Glad to have found this room on airbnb."
2027236,11274526,2014-03-27,5553545,Yvonne,"Totally share the same greatness pleasure of staying as the comments below.

We'd love to be back!"
2027236,11654084,2014-04-10,9376693,Doug,Excellent host.  Quick to respond and all the details were as promised.  The private room was comfortable with lots of creating hand crafted decor that really added added to the space.
2027236,11676925,2014-04-11,9877766,Theresa,Jennifer and Shawn are a friendly and fun couple.   Their cat Dwayne is a charmer.;-) We enjoyed our stay with them.   
2027236,11710258,2014-04-13,11423348,Cristian,We had a wonderful/ very comfortable stay!   The private entrance made our arrival/ departure stress free.   Everyone the room was so welcoming!   She really goes out of her way with the little details.   We couldn't thank her enough for making our stay so wonderful!
2027236,11751264,2014-04-14,12746107,Liza,This space is perfect for a stay just outside of the city.  The private entrance allowed for a stress-free departure! 
2027236,12142247,2014-04-23,12709951,Diana,Such a beautiful space! I found the space to be quiet and cozy and just what I needed after a long day of travels. Jennifer and her family were very welcoming and super helpful with directions as I clearly don't know my way around (email hidden)t. THANK YOU!
2027236,12296187,2014-04-28,11887087,John,"Jennifer is a gracious host and her guest room, home, and neighborhood are absolutely delightful. For two days running, we drove to the Ranier Beach light rail station and took the trolley into downtown Seattle.  Parking was plentiful and FREE on the city streets close to the station.  One evening we drove to the Ranier Beach community pool and made use of the hot tub.  It was inexpensive and we rented towels for 50 cents. So, future guests, bring your bathing suits!  We also visited Kubata Gardens, just a few blocks away. Delightful!  Lots of inexpensive ethnic restaurants and a Safeway in the neighborhood.  We opted to rent a GPS unit with our rental car and are glad we did.  Lots of twists and turns to get from the airport to Jennifer's place. But what a joy to hang out in a real neighborhood where real people live, with easy access to all that Seattle has to offer. "
2027236,12660004,2014-05-07,13460620,Katie,"A perfect spot to stay south of the city! Our flight got delayed, and we didn't arrive until much later. Even with our late arrival,  Jennifer was very accommodating and had everything ready for us. The privacy and little details in the space made this a great experience. Would highly recommend!! "
2027236,12797339,2014-05-11,14810125,Pavlina,"What a wonderful place to stay! Cozy and warm and (email hidden)ry comfy bed and cute little bathroom :) 
We would definitely stay there again! LOVED the cat by the way! What a loving feline friend."
2027236,12873100,2014-05-12,15262211,Mark,This was my first Air BnB experience and it was perfect. Jennifer was easy to communicate with throughout the process. The room was clean and even had coffee and treats. It was quite and in a great neighborhood. I will definitely stay again. 
2027236,12928360,2014-05-14,244900,Katerina,"Jennifer's place was perfect; it was clean, cozy, private, had everything you need. I highly recommended!"
2027236,12947919,2014-05-15,9008845,Martha,"I was grateful to find a quiet, and comfortable stay for my last night of a week trip. Jennifer was most kind to let me come a little early in the day, and was very helpful with suggestions of places to visit, and a great Italian restaurant for dinner. If you're looking for a safe and restful place for an evening or more, please give this one a second look!"
2027236,13000881,2014-05-17,13110180,J Jackson,"Our stay was brief but Jennifer and her family were very friendly. The space was clean, comfortable, and close to the airport. Everything we needed for our short time there."
2027236,13026422,2014-05-17,11965261,Nritya,The reservation was canceled 14 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
2027236,13048215,2014-05-18,341922,Ernie,Our visit was brief just a quick overnight.  The space was true to the description.  Nice attention to detail.  Jennifer was timely in her communications.  We would recommend this listing to others.
2027236,13185506,2014-05-21,7553940,Danielle,"This was our first experience with airbnb and it won't be my last. Jennifer was a great host. I arrived much later than expected and Jennifer had no issues with that and was accomodating. I indicated in advance that my daughter and I would like our privacy and she respected that. When I did bump into her, she graciously asked if there was anything that we needed. The room itself was the perfect size for my daughter and I. The subtle cheerful household noises made us relax since we did not feel like we would had to tiptoe around. There was security in knowing that we had a family to turn to should we need to. The neighborhood was very quiet and safe."
2027236,13471261,2014-05-28,2737145,Vivian,"We stayed at Jennifer's place for a week and it was a lovely experience. The suite was beautiful, bright, and clean and the private entrance allowed us to come and go as we pleased. It also came with a lot of thoughtful finishing touches -- some toothpaste, coffee, and even some snacks. While we did not have too many opportunities to interact with Jennifer and her family, she was extremely accommodating, even mailing me back something that left behind. And an added bonus: loved their cat (Dwayne) and dog (Luna) who were both adorable and friendly. If you don't mind the slightly longer commute to downtown, this place is a gem and a great place to stay in Seattle!"
2027236,13527599,2014-05-29,244900,Katerina,"Jennifer's place is a gem, clean, private and comfy. Nice neighborhood, easy commute. Highly recommended!"

2027236,14604849,2014-06-23,11592588,Katrin,We stayed four days and enjoyed every single one of them. 
2027236,14819399,2014-06-27,4223443,Joshua,I enjoyed my stay here in Seattle. The location is a few blocks away from the bus line. The 106 took me right to the heart of Seattle. Extremely nice place and people. If you want some peace of mind while still being close to the city this is the place for you 
2027236,14965675,2014-06-30,15188241,Kristin,"Jennifer was great! Very responsive to all modes of communication. Our stay was super short as we were just sleeping there for one night on the way from Vancouver to Portland, but it was just what we needed. The place is perfectly cozy and all the small touches like coffee, alarm clock, wifi and bathroom toiletries were really appreciated. Super considerate! We also loved meeting the very friendly cat, he was super charming :)"
2027236,15091312,2014-07-02,13906500,Janine,"It was a great place to stay with a lot of privacy. It was very clean and although it is not that close to the city center it is easy to reach with public transportation. We only met Jennifer and her family once, but they are very friendly and made us feel comfortable."
2027236,15224952,2014-07-05,13353645,Stacey,"LOVED staying at Jennifer's home! The space feels like a private studio and featured conveniences I didn't even know I wanted - the amount of amenities provided in the space is impressive. The attention to both aesthetic and functional detail is amazing. It's the perfect outpost for doing some extensive exploring of the area, which I hope to do in the future."
2027236,15751185,2014-07-15,14047967,John,"We loved both the room and our Host's. Best shower in Seattle! Lots of little extras made this stay more than enjoyable. Jen is also a massage therapist and well worth the price. Treat yourself . . . It's worth it.

Luna the doge is friendly and greeted us each time we returned ""Home"". All in all I'd say the best value on AIRBNB.

Thank you Jen & Shawn . . . See you next (website hidden): Thanks also Jackson
"
2027236,15924205,2014-07-18,16286478,Laura Lynne,"My only regret is that I did not have more time to spend here. Jennifer was beyond understanding of my travel woes as I missed a day and came in late due to car troubles. If I am ever able to return to the area I wish to stay with her again. When it was late and I was having trouble in the dark, her husband came to make sure I got in ok. Great great people , location and amenities!"
2027236,16271560,2014-07-24,598021,Kristina,"Our host greeted us as soon as we arrived and showed us to our room. The room was exactly as we had been expecting it to be. It was clean, cozy, and private. The neighborhood was also quiet and had a beautiful view of the lake. "
2027236,16607747,2014-07-30,14599747,Jessica,Awesome place to stay! Really loved it. Nice and close to downtown too. 
2027236,16696886,2014-07-31,9376693,Doug,Jennifer has excellent communication skills.  Great space close in a quiet neighborhood yet still close enough to Seattle makes this location very favorable.
2027236,16706570,2014-08-01,13920001,Ashley,My husband and I stayed overnight for 1 night and had a lovely experience. The room was nice and very clean and was easy to use. We felt very comfortable and as it was our first AirBNB experience and we were very pleased. Would recommend this space to others. 
2027236,17099010,2014-08-07,14033134,Hera,"It was really great time to stay with Jennifer's family. First of all, the bus staion is very close. Second, private enterance and bathroom are perfect. Lastly, wonderful neighborhood. Of course the family is so lovely and kind. When I visit in Seattle again, I'd like to stay their place again. If you find some place to stay in Seattle, don't hesitate. Thanks Jennifer :-)"
2027236,17289019,2014-08-10,17655342,Josh,Jennifer was very friendly and let us in when we arrived. The house is in a good location and is easy to get in and out of the city. I would recommend staying with Jennifer and her family and would stay here again.

2027236,17440428,2014-08-12,16467600,Adam,"Great bedroom and patio area with extremely comfortable bed and everything we needed including a perfect patio area, mini fridge & coffee machine."
2027236,17559405,2014-08-14,9852996,Christian,Jennifer and her husband were very nice hosts. They were helpfull anytime we had questions about the city. The room corresponded to the description. We warmely recommand to stay at Jennifer's home
2027236,18302223,2014-08-25,13993331,Connie,"Great location, about 15 minutes out of downtown Seattle, about 45 minutes from Olympic National Park. Accomodations were comfortable with the ability to come and go without feeling like you were disturbing their space. We were able to mix nature and city activities very comfortably."
2027236,18406451,2014-08-26,16667402,Valerie,"This was a beautiful room in a quiet neighborhood only 15 minutes from downtown Seattle.  The bed was unbelievably comfortable, and the room was very clean.  We would definitely stay here again!"
2027236,18544099,2014-08-28,99110,Don,"Jennifer went out of her way to make us welcome. We'd failed to notice her 4pm checkin time and needed to drop our stuff and shower. She scrambled to make it work. The room is small, but tidy, neat and self-contained, with its own bathroom, kitchenette and private entry. The home is located on a quiet residential street, with abundant parking. Jennifer's son, who greeted us, is a sweet kid and an excellent host. One word of caution: Dwayne the cat loves to be petted but will bite when he's had enough, so be careful. "
2027236,18562139,2014-08-28,19130465,Lynda,"Jennifer & Sean made us feel very welcome & gave us plenty of info on Seattle.
Their home was lovely the room was as described & we enjoyed having our own bathroom.
There was plenty of parking for us to leave the car.
Would stay again."
2027236,18669185,2014-08-30,997246,Andrew,"My girlfriend and I had a very pleasant stay. The room is just as described in a cute little neighborhood in Seattle. I would definitely stay again. Incredible value, especially for travelers like us who were looking place to sleep and wash up before continuing our trek in Washington!"
2027236,19020541,2014-09-05,13431461,David,Lovely stay at Jennifer's place. Super comfy bed and convenient location to bus into Central Seattle.  
2027236,19147473,2014-09-07,4219479,Emma,"Jennifer's room is really cute.  Having your own bathroom and private entrance makes it a perfect space!  The decor and design is lovely, and the shower is really nicely designed.  

It's a very pleasant place to stay with a really comfortable bed.  

The area is really serene and picturesque.  Jennifer was very nice to deal with also. 

We had a car so it was very close to downtown and to the airport which was convenient. "
2027236,19267143,2014-09-09,15156737,Tomas,"Hallo,
We got what we expected and a little bit more."
2027236,20006819,2014-09-22,5348321,Steve,"Jennifer was very welcoming and provided great communication before we stayed at this place. She made sure we have everything we need and also providing a ""nearby attractions"" booklet that was really helpful. Jennifer and her family were on vacation during our stay, so unfortunately I didn't get to meet her, but she did everything she could to accommodate.

I work from home and there was no desk in the room, but Jennifer allowed me to work on their dining table during the day. She was really flexible and I appreciated that so much!"
2027236,20216337,2014-09-25,21573522,Dusti,My stay was just what I needed I traveled from Portland Or. To Seattle for work and Jennifer was accommodating to my late arrival and the room was so Cozy!
2027236,20551635,2014-10-01,18130493,Susan,"This was our first time using airbnb, but not the last. Jennifer made us feel welcome. The room is great, you can make your coffee in the morning in the small kitchenette and sit outside and enjoy the peace and quiet. Nice neighborhood. "
2027236,20652185,2014-10-03,5819957,Courtney,"We stayed here twice, at the beginning and the end of our trip. The greatest thing was having a separate entrance and not feeling involved or intrusive in their family life. The details are adorable and the tiled shower was a delight. The soft sheets, memory foam pillows and comfy bed afforded me the most restful sleep of the trip. A highlight was a morning walk through nearby (and free) Kubota Gardens. "
2027236,20718290,2014-10-04,17552704,Chris,The room was as described and ready for us when we arrived at 4p. We meet Jennifer and she was polite and showed us around the room. She also gave us good information for getting around the area for the day. Was a pleasant stay and would stay here again. 
2027236,20746659,2014-10-05,15142751,Brittany,"The room was cozy and very clean. The bed was wonderfully comfortable after a long day of traveling. We didn't get a chance to meet our hosts, but their dog did come by to say hello."
2027236,20932103,2014-10-07,21921636,Steve,"Jennifers room was exactly as described and made for a very pleasant stay while in Seattle.  Altho we did not get to meet Jennifer or her family during our stay due to a busy schedule on both sides we were very warmly greeted and treated by their pets!  Both Luna dog and Dwayne the cat were gracious hosts.

The binder left in the room with suggestions on local bars, restaurants, and recreational things to do was also helpful. We took a nice little stroll to the local pizza joint that was recommended for a late evening snack after a long day of travel and sight seeing.

Overall this was a HUGE value as we would have spent more than double on a hotel stay.  If we are back in Seattle there is a great chance we will be staying here again :-)"
2027236,20953682,2014-10-08,5819957,Courtney,Staying here was a delight! We enjoyed the back patio and private entrance. One of my favorite memories on this trip was our morning walk through gorgeous (& nearby) Kubota Park. The neighborhood had amazing  views of the water and mountains. There was a  comfy bed and memory foam pillows and some cute details like the colorfully tiled shower and tiny sink. The place was perfect for us. 
2027236,21182054,2014-10-12,4968074,Erin,"Loved staying in Jennifer's home! Te room was perfect...def equipped w the necessities.
Coffee, coffee maker, fridge and microwave. Amazing shower! This after 3 days camping was a must. 

Jennifer her son Jackson and Shawn were all so welcoming friendly..I would def recommend this place! "
2027236,21397964,2014-10-16,99371,Douglas,"our hosts were courteous and attentive,and the house and our space were exceptional.the room was as pictured with great little surprises around each corner,surprising little things that make you think,wow,i wish i had thought of that."
2027236,21444261,2014-10-17,22306630,Meghan,"Jennifer's little room is an awesome reprieve from the city! It was clean, homey and had a really zen, peaceful quality to it! The porch area was great to have our morning tea on (the tea and coffee was graciously provided) and we got to take a walk down to the water. The neighborhood is beautiful and the early morning mist and crisp air of the PNW made us so happy. Thanks so much Jennifer!"
2027236,21490430,2014-10-18,1893461,Roger,I arrived by cab late in the evening after a business trip and was warmly greeted by Jennifer and her son.  They were very friendly hosts and gracious with their time.  The room was exactly as described and comfortable.  I will definitely stay at this property on future trips when I have more time for exploring the city. 
2027236,21612189,2014-10-20,16714050,Isabel,"Jennifer was a great host, we arrived there early but she was able to drop us off at the location"
2027236,22114134,2014-10-30,22349344,Alyssa,"She was very welcoming. We got to get a lot of information about the city and where to go. The space was emaculate and way updated since the last pictures shown. The private access was nice, but we're talkitive people so we left the house door open most of the time we were there. The dog and cat were really friendly and the side amenities made everything much more like home."
2027236,22154085,2014-10-31,10180027,Veronica,The room was super cute and really convenient for our trip. Definitely would recommend it to others
2027236,22444135,2014-11-06,23126846,Anna,"The picture says it all! Unique room with little touches to make you feel at home -- coffee fixings, soap, a fan for light sleepers and plenty of towels. There's also a wonderful little folder of local attractions and restaurants that the host personally recommends! Would definitely stay there again."
2027236,22597993,2014-11-10,22154814,Rosalyn,"Jennifer's home was lovely, clean and  very comfortable. she greeted us at the door and showed us to our room. I have to say the room was much bigger than i anticipated. The bathroom was very clean and filled with all the necessities. The bed was extremely comfortable and the drawer full of information about the city. Ex: where to eat, how to find major attractions, major roads, etc. my first time in Seattle was made all the better, knowing we were coming back to a cozy home at the end of a day in the city. Parking is easy to find, the house was easy to find. Also, their pet luna is adorable, we loved her too."
2027236,23009518,2014-11-20,22456065,Janessa,Jennifer was so sweet to pick us up from the bus station and she was incredibly flexible with us and our schedule. We were out most of the time so unfortunately we didn't get to interact much with her and her family. But the room was amazing (especially the private entrance and the shower)!!! Overall it was an amazing experience! :)
2027236,23193743,2014-11-24,15977469,Nichole And Chris,Jennifer and Shawn have created warm and welcoming guest accommodations. The house overlooks Pudget Sound and is close to city attractions. We were thoroughly impressed with the thoughtfully stocked room which provided the ultimate relaxation during our stay. This bnb is going in our book of favorites and our go-to location when visiting the Seattle area. Thank you Jennifer and Shawn for your hospitality!!
2027236,23273271,2014-11-27,21326931,Timothy,The attention to detail and wonderful artistic influences in this private comfortable dwelling are awe inspiring. The hosts and accomodations are warm and delightful.
2027236,23323177,2014-11-29,14850235,Cindy,"Me and my boy friend stayed at Jennifer's during Thanksgiving holiday. They were really friendly, respectful, communicative, and made us comfortable. Unfortunately we were traveling most of the time so didn't have enough time to hang out. "
2027236,23523186,2014-12-03,14850235,Cindy,Me and my boy friend stayed at Jennifer's during Thanksgiving holiday. They were really friendly and made us comfortable. Unfortunately we were traveling most of the time so didn't have enough time to hang out. 
2027236,23899034,2014-12-14,19204870,Linda,"We had a wonderful time whilst on vacation. Having the light rail so close by was very convenient.  Your advise was fantastic whenever I approached you with any questions. We found your place relaxing to come back to after a full days outing. Shower was fantastic and all the little extras you have placed around the room just added that extra touch of welcome.
Thankyou again for having us stay."
2027236,24583171,2014-12-31,14736660,Cheng-Lin,A lovely and warm place with a quiet neighborhood. I enjoyed the stay and the convenience of its location. I only had the chance to talk to Jennifer on phone but I can tell she is a friendly and warm-hearted person through her voice and the decoration of the house.
2027236,27800112,2015-03-12,2652931,Ande,"Jennifer answered each message and we were greeted by her when we arrived at her wonderful home in Seattle.  Our private room was exactly how it was described and she had provided us with a fridge, microwave & coffeepot with coffee & filtered water!   Our bed was very comfortable, the shower was a reliable source of good hot water and Jennifer & her family were very considerate of our privacy.  It was our first time to Seattle and Jennifer provided a neat folder of maps, suggested restaurants, nightclubs, groceries, parks, transportation, etc. not only in their neighborhood but in the city.  I'm sure the Spring/Summer months are beautiful in her back patio that our private entrance opened out onto and I won't easily forget the view from the front porch with the beautiful Camelia tree & view of Lake Washington."
2027236,28217155,2015-03-20,28259645,Tyler,"Delightful room in a nice part of the town - full of nice little touches that we were wonderfully surprised by, including a drawer full of fresh towels and individual soaps, a selection of tea, coffee, lotion and shampoo. It had all the personal touches of someone who really cared about making our experience a positive one. The deck outside was lovely and the dog never bothered us, and was really quite friendly.
AND THE BED. IT WAS SO COMFY OH MAN. And those pillows with the little like, cooling gel in the middle. It was so relaxing after a long day exploring the busy city to come back and decompress in such a charming room. 
Highly recommended. We will be staying here again if we ever come back through."
2027236,28361298,2015-03-22,27367615,Tiina,"The photos do not do this adorable room justice! A great place with a lot of amenities. The bed was especially comfortable! The side entrance was great for privacy, but I could pop my head out into the house and ask Jennifer or Shawn anything. They definitely know the area and gave spot-on directions! The nieghborhood is nice and quiet, and you have view of Lake Washington right from the street. It was a great way to start my vacation!"
2027236,28398610,2015-03-23,27550722,Caroline,"Beautiful space, lovely neighborhood, felt very private and homey. Will definitely stay here again next time my boyfriend and I come through Seattle."
2027236,28880917,2015-03-31,27958488,Daniel,our experience was great. Jennifer and her husband were very accomodating and gladly answered any questions we had. the room was clean and comfortable and the neighborhood was calm and beautiful. Would absolutely think about returning.
2027236,28971821,2015-04-01,30049532,Susie,"A wonderful cosy room with private entrance, bathroom and mini kitchen.  Very clean, comfortable and quiet.  Directions to the house were clear, easy to follow and Jennifer was friendly and easy to contact.  The location is close to downtown Seattle and the neighbourhood has water views.  Very happy with our first night ever booked with airbnb."
2027236,29149341,2015-04-04,6273123,Vinay,Felt like home. Everything was clean and as mentioned in the summary. Short stay but my wife and I had a good time. We were also told where to get the best food and views of the Seattle skyline and we did just that!
2027236,29589062,2015-04-09,25567818,Manis,"The bed is amazing. Comfortable, quiet, full of quirk and wonder. Recieved with genoristy and I left feeling relaxed, rested and capable of continuing my adventure. If I need to stay on the South Side of Seattle again, it'll be here."
2027236,29944017,2015-04-14,7494258,Amanda,This place was great. The neighborhood is beautiful. I don't have a car and it was still very easy to get downtown via bus. The room is very clean and the private. The bed is VERY COMFORTABLE. I will definitely be staying here next time I go to Seattle.  
2027236,30093149,2015-04-17,30215008,Mark,"Jennifer was away for a few days,  and no one was home when we arrived but we were able to find our way into the room as prearranged.  When we did meet Shawn he was very nice, as was Jennifer when we met her.  The room was adequate for the price.  The bed was comfortable and the shower had been updated with a rainhead.  The house is in what seemed to be a safe neighbourhood.  Restaurants in the area are slim but there are a couple.  We found a good Italian restaurant 10 minutes away!  It was a fair drive to the points of interest.   We would not stay there again on our next trip but it certainly is fairly adequate for the price."
2027236,30349257,2015-04-20,30985153,Chen,"I like the house,Go to the airport and the city is very convenient.and jennifer is a very kind host.if I go to the Seattle again,I I still will choose to live there.
"
2027236,30474541,2015-04-22,12115388,Christine,The room is very cute. I did not see the hosts but they left everything I needed in the room 
2027236,30549280,2015-04-24,27895366,Caitlin,"This was our first time in Seattle and our first time using airbnb, and we could not have chosen a better place to stay. The location was a bit out of the city, but perfect after our hectic days. It was nice to come back to a quiet house and free parking. The room is spacious and clean, the bed comfortable, and the chaise lounge a nice touch. Our biggest deciding factor in choosing Jennifer's place was the private entrance and private bathroom. The amenities in the bathroom came in handy! We never actually met Jennifer (just her dogs!), but she responded to my messages quickly and in a friendly manner. Overall, I'm so pleased with the accommodations and would definitely stay there again!"
2027236,31118073,2015-05-02,30372114,Fred,Great location! Great host! Wonderful room!
2027236,31392166,2015-05-04,6372255,Lisbeth,"Relax in the City was even cuter than pictured, and Jennifer was a great host, even giving me a perfect brunch recommendation. The bed was extremely comfortable, the shower was great and the small details made the place feel very homey. I really enjoyed my stay and would certainly love to stay there again if I am in the area. "
2027236,31555658,2015-05-06,244900,Katerina,"Jennifer is welcoming, easy to communicate with.  The place is super clean, private, modern, quiet, easy commute to downtown Seattle. This nice backyard is a bonus. Highly recommended!! "
2027236,32348059,2015-05-17,26215520,Schuyler,"Had an amazing time with Jennifer. Her bed was so comfortable and everything was perfect. Jen also has two dogs that are beyond adorable. I highly recommended her place, it's the perfect spot. "
2027236,32980341,2015-05-24,2058498,Krista,"Thoroughly enjoyed my stay at Jennifer and Shawn's place. Super comfortable accommodations-bed was super comfy with memory foam pillows. Beautiful location great for a walk around the neighborhood after a long day, close to the light rail, and it was lovely being greeted by Jennifer's two adorable dogs outside every morning. Great restaurants in the neighborhood to choose from - Redwing Cafe and Nate's Wings for local fare. Absolutely enjoyed my stay. Thank you again!"
2027236,33380963,2015-05-27,10285368,Sali,Great little space! Just as pictured. Lots of fun little details. The shower was nice and hot and the bed was soooo comfortable. Loved her animals. Would definitely stay again whenever on a budget. 
2027236,33686281,2015-05-31,31678603,Jonathan,"Very comfortable place, reasonably convenient for downtown Seattle (short walk. bus & light rail).  Very comfortable bed, helpful host & funky Gaudi-esque shower! "
2027236,33922112,2015-06-02,21209932,Wendy,"Jennifer and her husband Shawn are wonderful host! Shawn told us his Mt.Rainier experience gave us good suggestions, and I scheduled a massage with Jennifer which was great and helpful to my Mt. Rainier climbing trip. The room was so so so cute, very clean, lovely decoration made by Shawn. Super nice neighborhood, easy access to public transportation go downtown Seattle. We loved it!"
2027236,34076406,2015-06-04,31615673,Alicia,"While me and my friend's visit to seattle was short and sweet, we felt very comfortable and welcomed by Jennifer and her husband for our one night stay. The room is as described... and the mini fridge and microwave are a nice touch! If ever in the area again, I would not hesitate to stay here again. "
2027236,34228916,2015-06-06,33537403,Rob,We had a good stay at Jennifer and Shawn's place. We had everything we needed for our short visit to Seattle. Very comfortable. I like the fact that we had a private entrance and we had the use of the patio deck as well. Luna is an adorable dog. Perfect experience for a first time Airbnb-er.
2027236,34281559,2015-06-07,5620493,Kris,"Wonderful, friendly host.  Clean room, comfy.  We didn't spend much time there except to sleep.  Great first AirBnB experience!! "
2027236,34621067,2015-06-10,27409462,Aline,We loved our stay in Seattle at Jennifers cozy room. There's all positive! And we loved your dogs and cat (hope the cats leg is doing better!) Thank you again for the lovely host. Aline&Nico
2027236,35547429,2015-06-20,26025343,Mikayla,"Our stay was incredible! It was a peaceful place to come back to when we had been out all day and we had the freedom of coming back late and not having to worrying about waking anyone up, which was very important to me. Jennifer was very helpful with getting us set up when we got there and she was very kind whenever we had any questions and she had some awesome recommendations on food, the Pho was definitely a hit! Overall the trip was amazing and staying in such a wonderful, quiet room made everything that much better. I would highly recommend this home to everyone! Thank you so very much!"
2027236,36192316,2015-06-26,32067159,Chloe,"We really enjoyed our stay in Jennifer's home. The room is private and cozy. It has its own bathroom which was really nice. I did not meet Jennifer in person, but she made herself available by phone. Their dogs are very sweet and even spent some time with us in the bedroom! "
2027236,36397466,2015-06-28,28725238,Maggie,"Nice house in a warm family and it can keep the privacy in separate entrance because we are travelers and in the non-regular living time arrangements.The dogs are cute and warm-welcome,thanks for Jennifer hosting "
2027236,37129149,2015-07-05,23794150,Suzanne,"My mom and I stayed for one night in Jennifer's suite, which is as pictured, except there's a nice chaise-lounge in place of the loveseat. Since there's no other furniture for seating in the room besides the bed, this was nice so one person could rest there while the other sits on the bed.

If you're visiting during the summer (especially during a heat spell like they've had this year) - you will want to note there is no air conditioning here. Jennifer definitely notes this in her listing, but it's something to be aware of. She kindly had the fan on full-blast when we arrived, but since it was late in the day, it was quite hot in the room (the outside temp was 92) and didn't cool down for comfortable sleeping until after 10:30 p.m. The bed was very comfortable, complete with memory foam pillows and a cute built-in reading lamp in the corner above the bed. The bathroom is very nice, but very small - so expect to go one person at a time.

We chose Jennifer's listing in part because of its proximity to the light rail, so those doing the same should note you must take a city bus from the nearest light rail station, and it's about a 3 normal city block walking distance from the closest stop.

I've had three stays on Air BnB, but think it would be helpful if they add a section that notes if breakfast is provided, and if so, at what level. This would be helpful for planning. There were a few apples and candy bars, bottled water, coffee, and some ramen noodles - but not any juice or cereal/milk here. We gratefully ate the candy, apples and enjoyed the water!

Many other reviews also mentioned interacting with Jennifer/her family, so we had thought we would meet her at some point - but this didn't happen until we were leaving the next morning and she happened to be outside as we were doing so. She was super-nice and friendly. I personally like meeting/interacting with my hosts, and would have found it helpful to have had at least one in-person conversation, but since she had a client upon arrival and didn't subsequently reach out to us, we weren't sure if this would be welcomed. I did text her with a question, but unfortunately there was trouble with Air-BnB's messaging and it didn't get to her till the next morning. Again - this is just another reason I personally think each host should make an effort to at least personally greet their guests once if they're home during their guests' visit.

All-in-all, the suite met our needs and was a nice value, so we are grateful!"
2027236,37502467,2015-07-07,2754047,Raul,"Jennifer was a sweetheart and very communicative throughout the process. We didn't get a chance to meet her because of our schedules but the room was great and as described - comfortable bed and pillows and a very impressive shower, I must say. The private entrance was key since we had an early flight in the morning. Only reason they don't get 5 stars is because their dog barked quite a bit when they weren't there. Besides that, it was a great place to stay and great experience. Thanks guys!"
2027236,37843444,2015-07-11,14125338,Jakub,Our stay was great. Room was nicely prepared and communication with Jenifer was excelent. Room looks even better than on pictures!
2027236,37943437,2015-07-12,27071490,Juan,"We felt very welcomed in Jennifer's home. The room was cute and cozy. The lights had dimmers which was pretty nice. Having a fridge was useful to store the many food items we had acquired thus far in our travels.

The house was a short drive away from the freeway so it was very easy to drive to Seattle. We would definitely stay here again."
2027236,38816780,2015-07-19,27708189,Isabelle,"My husband and I stayed for 2 nights in Jennifer's place. We have a little chat with her when we arrive and she was very nice. The apartment and the bathroom are smaller than it looks on the picture, but all the amenities are there. It's also clean, well decorated and we really enjoyed the private entrance and the deck. The first evening was a little bit noisy, because the hosts were having some guests at home. But the second nice was very quiet and we were able to relax. The location is good, but it's better to have a car to reach the train station. "
2027236,39166950,2015-07-21,33663728,Flo,"Nice room and a very friendly host. Everything was clean, we enjoyed our stay."
2027236,39730910,2015-07-26,25952434,Astrid,Von Jennifers Zimmer aus konnten wir alle unsere Wunschziele problemlos erreichen. Das Zimmer selber war schon fast eine kleine Wohnung; bestens ausgerichtet mit kleiner Kühlschrank/Mikrowellen-Ecke und einem eigenen Badezimmer! Mit der Terrasse vor der eigenen Eingangstür kam richtige Ferienstimmung auf! Die Einrichtung hat sich im Vergleich zum Foto verbessert.  
2027236,40192983,2015-07-29,23339491,Birgit,Nice and clean room in a quiet neighbourhood. Own entrench and a good terrace. We had a good stay. 
2027236,40472360,2015-07-31,12693874,Britt & Chris,"We enjoyed our greeting from the dogs, especially as we were missing our own dogs at home! The space was clean and the bed was very, very comfortable. We took their recommendations for places to eat etc & really enjoyed walking from the house down to Jude's and dipping our feet in the lake. Great stop off south of Seattle before we continued on to Oregon - lovely space with its own private entrance."
2027236,41345806,2015-08-07,9686049,Laura,The room was very nice with lots of amenities like coffee and a hairdryer.  We enjoyed having breakfast on the back porch.  The location is very convenient to the city. Check in was very easy. It is attached to a house with an active family; ok if you're not looking for absolute quiet.
2027236,41369708,2015-08-07,21140691,Andreas,"We stayed e few days in Jennifer's AirBnB and didn't miss anything. The room was clean and cosy, the neighborhood is calm and people were very friendly. We felt like at home! Shawn and Jennifer are very nice an uncomplicated hosts. We would stay again in their AirBnB. Highly recommended!"
2027236,41735370,2015-08-09,30698454,Alessandra,Good room size comfortable bed and shower. Thank you!
2027236,43611336,2015-08-21,32408377,Rhea,"Prima uitvalsbasis voor een trip naar Seattle. Het bed was super comfortabel en de badkamer voldeed ook aan alle verwachtingen. Echter is het huis wel ietwat gehorig, maar niet storend.
Het contact voorafgaande aan het bezoek verliep duidelijk en op een prettige manier. Hierdoor voelden wij ons direct welkom. 
Ik kan een verblijf dan ook ten zeerste aanraden als je een verblijfplaats zoekt in de omgeving van Seattle. "
2027236,43938792,2015-08-23,8014074,Kelsey,"Jennifer and Shawn were great hosts! They were very hospitable and had lots of great suggestions for us for places to check out. The space was just as sunny and cozy as it looks in the pictures, and the bed was super comfortable! They also have some pretty cool animals who are really friendly :) (although they'll leave you alone if youre not an animal person, dont worry).  Would highly recommend this place, and would definitely stay here again!"
2027236,44281793,2015-08-25,31425653,Jeff,Room well accomodated. Clean.
2027236,45373333,2015-09-02,35039640,Isabel,We stayed in Seattle before our Alaskan cruise to visit my husband's family this place is perfect. As we just came to sleep we were out all day the bed is heaven!! So soft and with Feed pillows!
2027236,45563465,2015-09-04,25647609,Lore,Great place for us to stay over before an early morning flight! 
2027236,45656995,2015-09-05,7424717,Dahlia,"Thank you guys for a really amazing stay! I liked everything about it...your family, the room, the surroundings and most of all our chats! I wish you the best of luck with business and would recommend you 1000 times over.  And hopefully someday you come and visit me in Croatia! "
2027236,45933113,2015-09-07,10395425,Katia,"This was our first experience with AirBnB and it could not have been better!  We selected Jennifer's place based on the cost and reviews, and the reviews do not do the room justice!  We knew the reviews mentioned a comfy bed and fluffy pillows but there were so many extras (shampoo, lotion, coffee and MILK, oatmeal, soup, snacks for the owner's pups!) also.  I actually wasn't feeling well our first day there so we decided to stay in rather than go out to dinner.  We found snacks, tea, other small items in the cub board that made staying in and relaxing possible.  It was just like being at home!  If we go back to Seattle, we'll def.  stay at this place again.  Highly, highly recommended!  "
2027236,47348126,2015-09-18,34111643,Rebecca,Jennifer's place is in a good location to get in and out of Seattle. Quiet neighborhood.  Small bedroom and bathroom as stated. Great breakfast place nearby called Geraldine's counter.  Good communication with Jennifer before and during stay. 
2027236,47629476,2015-09-21,34437664,Laine,"Hosts were very obliging. Allowed us a later check out as we had a late flight. Lovely bed!
We took the light rail into the city the first day after a long walk, but found the 106 bus, a short walk from hosts and about the same time into the city as the train. A comfortable stay. Thank you, ?Jennifer
"
2027236,47965592,2015-09-22,9926874,Erin,"We absolutely LOVED this spot! A perfect place for someone looking for a convenient and comfortable location near SEATAC. We arrived later in the evening and after a long day of travel, this was VERY easy to find and check-in. The private entrance was an added bonus!"
2027236,48312131,2015-09-25,37717908,Liz,"Though I did not get a chance to meet our hosts, my friend did and they were lovely! I wish we had had a chance to see them more, but our trip had us out and about quite a bit. Loved the room. The bathroom is super cute and the shower is AMAZING. The neighborhood is great. Stunning views. We would definitely stay here again. "
2027236,48884545,2015-09-29,10112463,Lauren,The apartment and host was very accommodating. A little ways from downtown if you are looking to hang out in the city. Perfect for a couple or solo traveler.

2027236,50447299,2015-10-12,5355672,Dorothee,"Kleines, dunkles, sauberes Zimmer. Gut zur Ankunft nach langem Anflug da in Flughafennähe. Ungeeignet für Aufenthalte um die Stadt kennen zu lernen. 
Nur im Sommer buchen. Es ist ein feuchtes, kühles Zimmer. Als wir im Oktober dort waren kamen die Besitzer erst am Morgen unserer Abreise auf die Idee das Zimmer zu beheizen....."
2027236,50780980,2015-10-14,979536,Kaitlyn,Enjoyed staying at Jennifer's place! We ended up getting in pretty late but she greeted us at the door and showed us to our room. The bed was super comfortable which was awesome cause we had just driven all day. Very cozy and the shower felt amazing!
2027236,50937150,2015-10-16,2708109,Joanne,"Our stay was a quick one, but very valuable the night before our flight back home.  We were close to the airport and able to manage an early checkout without fuss at 4 in the morning.  I did not have the opportunity to meet Jennifer but felt very welcomed by Shawn and their two lovely pets.  

The place was very clean and cozy.  There were plenty of extra towels, snacks, and even a thoughtful, much appreciated heat pack to apply to sore muscles at the end of the day.

Thank you for sharing your space Jennifer."

2027236,52340709,2015-10-28,9559828,Sara,We loved our experience staying with Jennifer. The bed was extremely comfortable the location was beautiful and the room was pleasant and beautifully decorated. We were there on business research and development for a cannabis business and we were grateful that they allowed us to consume outside on the private deck. It was a great value for our dollar and I would definitely consider staying with them in the future!  
2027236,52984388,2015-11-03,45315195,Christina,"This was just an amazing experience! The home has so much character! The bed was comfortable, pillows fluffy, wonderful shower, clean, all of the great adjectives! "
2027236,53613221,2015-11-10,17129157,Robin And Victor,"We arrived at night and the lights were left on for us. Jennifer's instructions on how to get in were detailed enough to curb our late night fumbling! The room was clean, bright and well stocked for a long weekend. We were warm and cozy. Shawn was very gracious in giving us hints and directions and showing us his craftsmanship! Thank you Jennifer and Shawn."
2027236,55356067,2015-12-01,42531569,Marisa,"Jennifer was nice enough to stay up late to greet us since our plane did not arrive until about 10 pm. The room was super cozy and cute! They have a little fridge and microwave, so it's perfect for little groceries or leftovers. The bathroom had all necessities (towels and soap) so if you forget anything, chances are this place will have them. The room was always warm when we got back out of the cold  weather! The location was super convenient and the neighborhood was nice and pretty close to the freeway. All in all, I highly recommend this place!"
4599119,25631695,2015-01-21,6211900,Adam,"Paige was great, very patient with my questions both before and during my stay. The space is just fantastic for my wife and I, for its decor, furnishings and location, when we come to Seattle."
4599119,32807785,2015-05-22,6211900,Adam,"This is my 2nd time in Paige's home and it was just as enjoyable as the first! Every amenity that could have been there WAS there: big, deep bathtub, lovely and quaint backyard amidst the springtime blossoms in the private garden, big kitchen, fantastic coffeemaker (no, really!) and very comfortable living and dining rooms. Paige is a a treat to interact with and was very helpful answering my few questions and providing an extra bed in the spare bedroom/office."
4599119,36850417,2015-07-02,5708117,Mary,"The listing was exactly as described.  Paige was welcoming through emails and extensive, complete printed instructions.
We liked her recommendations for favorite local restaurants and services. ( I used the nail salon and it was great !) We also are continuing to enjoy breakfast at the Bryant Cafe !  The recommendations helped us feel immediately at home in the neighborhood."
4599119,43209787,2015-08-18,1887571,John,"It was a beautiful home, exactly as advertised.  The location was exactly right for our needs, and we were very comfortable.  Working with Paige was easy, clear, and a delight.  We recommend this home fully."
7660932,41556956,2015-08-07,34435705,Judy,"This little space is an absolute gem!  Tucked behind the garden in a lovely and friendly neighborhood, this studio is very private and peaceful.  The room is tastefully decorated with object d'art, antiques, and art which gives the space a lovely ambiance & sophistication.
No detail has been overlooked, and the small touches -  herbal teas, lavender scented soaps, high quality cotton linens, etc -
makes one feel the genuine care that was made in preparing the space for one purpose - the comfort of the guest.  "

7660932,42212344,2015-08-11,1370341,Jesse,"Alan was an excellent host.  Very helpful from the get go, and did everything possible to make sure I felt accommodated.  He gave me a quick tour of the room, showing me everything it had to offer.  He continued to be helpful throughout the trip, making sure everything was going well.

The room was exactly as described and more.  It's nicely sized for one person.  Everything I needed for a few day stay in Seattle.  Neighborhood was nice, and the room is located a short walk from a few Madrona places.  It's also a cheap ride to many other Seattle locations from there.  

Thanks again Alan, and I hope to stay there again!"
7660932,42497031,2015-08-13,2733519,Sara,"I am so happy to have found this place!  It is so cute and comfortable, nestled in a beautiful neighborhood with both a hub and beach close by.

7660932,45207900,2015-08-31,29081348,Rayne,"I had a fabulous time staying at Alan's chic studio. Alan is the perfect host. He is gracious, generous, considerate and interesting. He made me feel comfortable and taken care of during my visit. 

The studio is conveniently located in the beautiful old neighborhood of Madrona. It is two blocks from the downtown bus and within walking distance of several cafés and restaurants. (I did not need to use a car at all during my stay.)

The space is handsomely decorated, comfortable and private. It was a little home away from home for me. And, I highly recommend taking at least one bubble bath in the claw foot tub.

Thanks Alan!"
7660932,46102126,2015-09-07,42226465,Lyall,Gracious friendly host. Charming private cottage in beautiful Madrona neighborhood.

The cottage was very cozy, very private, quiet, and easy to get to as well. I must say, I fell in love with it.  

The Madrona neighborhood one of the best neighborhood of Seattle. I was blown away with its beauty. Very green and lots of beautiful houses around and friendly neighbors. It’s located right next to Lake Washington yet close to everything else in Seattle. I was simply wowed. 

For others looking to book, I high recommend booking with Alan. 

It was a pleasure doing booking with Alan, and I would definitely book again.
"
7660932,48832473,2015-09-28,37536901,Maurizio,"Alan is a  very great host. I had just moved to Seattle, and Alan helped me with luggages by picking me up with the car. He was always happy to help me. The accomodation is very nice and cozy with a vintage touch in a great neighborhood of Seattle. Highly recommended."
5259194,26660568,2015-02-16,23317853,Jungmin,"Louis and Kevin were one of the best hosts I have ever had. They were good at communication. We got there little later than what we supposed to yet they were nice enough to greet us and even when we were leaving, they came out to say good bye. I had everything I need in their house!  Not to mention they live in an amazing neighborhood!! Literally two blocks away from busy night life area. Very very recommendable. "
5259194,26959774,2015-02-22,11233626,Neil,"Louis and Kevin's lovely house is in the perfect location. Easy to find from the highway and Pike Place Market is within walking distance, not to mention situated next to the vibrant streets of Pike and Pine. 
They straight away made us feel at ease in their very personal and warm feeling home. 
Kevin was so helpful in recommending local bars to visit and attractions to go on our 1 day visit. Their knowledge of Seattle, certainly made our trip more memorable. 
The best part about AirBnB has always been meeting new and interesting people we were so glad we didn't go with a hotel.
"
5259194,27022501,2015-02-23,25495010,Jamie,Louis and Kevin have a beautiful & inviting home! The location is ideal; it is within walking distance of downtown Seattle and all the hot spots on Capitol Hill.

Their cats were friendly & adorable and we hope to return to stay with them in the future!
5259194,27558577,2015-03-07,3480986,Aadra,"Wow, wow, wow. Louis and his partner Kevin are two of the nicest people we've ever met. Not only were they superb hosts, offering us flexible arrival and departure times, serving us coffee and providing recommendations, they are incredibly lovely people who left a mark on us with their kindness. I LOVE their home which is so beautifully decorated and their gorgeous cats are very friendly. This location is about a 5-10 minute walk to some of the coolest bars, coffee joints, restaurants, independent stores on Capitol Hill. The bedroom has everything you could need to be comfortable (lots of towels! extra blankets! toiletries! coffee maker! beautiful art! lovely garden!) for a Seattle visit. Our only regret is staying a single night. We can't wait to go back and when we do, we will certainly stay here again!"

The listing is incredibly accurate, and you'll find that Capital Hill is filled to the brim with great stuff to do - and Louis and Kevin will be happy to tell you about it if you're interested. The room/bathroom are clean and the stay was seamless. I would consider booking a trip to Seattle again just to stay here. This is what airbnb is all about!"
5259194,28182207,2015-03-19,5448697,Stephanie,Louis & Kevin are great hosts - beyond friendly - and their home is beautiful. I was in Seattle visiting UW and felt so welcomed into their home after a long day on campus. Arguably one of my most enjoyable Airbnb experiences. Would highly recommend to anyone traveling to Seattle! 
5259194,28526302,2015-03-25,28192858,Kelli,"Louis and Kevin were great hosts. They were very friendly and approachable. They greeted us warmly upon arrival and were always open to chatting. They also provided useful recommendations for places to visit around the city. Their home was inviting and comfortable, particularly when the fire was lit. The neighborhood was peaceful, but also near a variety of interesting spots. Overall, we had a great experience, and we highly recommend staying with Louis and Kevin. "
5259194,28616474,2015-03-27,16180099,Marisa,"We had the most wonderful time staying with Louis and Kevin! The apartment is adorable, and everything was clean and and well-maintained at our arrival. The location of the house is awesome; we found that we could walk just about anywhere--to Pioneer Square, Pike Place Market, downtown, etc. The immediate neighborhood, on the edge of Capitol Hill, also has a ton of great restaurants and bars and an overall fun feel. One evening, Louis and Kevin were kind enough to invite us to share a bottle of wine with them--and it was such a pleasure talking with them!--they're so friendly and have really interesting perspectives. Highly recommended. Thanks so much, Louis and Kevin, for the great experience!"

We loved the beautiful house, and the creative yet classy renovations. The back yard has gorgeous gardening, and the street and surrounding houses are all very pretty
We really did walk every where - very central! We found lots of fun things to do in the close neigbourhood. 
Kevin and Louis go out of their way to make a true 'home away from home'. 
Highly recommended.

Highly recommended."

5259194,29863802,2015-04-13,20743562,Alyssa,"looking for a quirky character house, in a brilliant location? This is the place! 

We had a great three nights at Kevin and Louis' place during our trip to Seattle. It was our first time to Seattle, but we easily found our way to the house; it's in a brilliant location and we quickly became accustomed to the fantastic neighborhood, which is made so much easier by being within walking distance to some many things. 

The house has bundles of character and charm, and the bedroom is exactly as expected - warm, comfy, spacious and secure. Although you are very close to restaurants and bars (highly recommend The Skillet, which is just around the corner) the street itself is very quiet, and no issues at all with noise at night. 

Upon arrival Kevin made us feel incredibly welcome, and provided us with some great tips and information as well as maps for parking and finding our way around the city. 

Thanks Kevin and Louis for having us :)

Alyssa and Ben"
5259194,30057228,2015-04-16,31112636,Brent,My girlfriend and I had an awesome time staying with Louis and Kevin. They were very warm and welcoming from the start by giving us recommendations on where to go to hang out while we were in Seattle. Seattle was the first stop in our road trip to San Francisco and they even gave us suggestions on things to do on our journey. We loved the cozy atmosphere of the house and the two friendly kitties that kept us company in the morning! Parking and location were great and everything was clean and tidy. Overall a wonderful experience for our first ever AirBnB stay! We hope to come back again soon!
5259194,30140846,2015-04-18,13906395,Marlaina,"I had a wonderful stay with Louis and Kevin at their lovely and eclectic Victorian home in a great Seattle neighbourhood.  Louis and Kevin were very welcoming and helpful with suggestions for getting around Seattle and I had a great conversation with Kevin, as he had just been at a town hall presentation by the same person who was the keynote speaker for the conference I was attending. The room was spacious, immaculate and very quiet. I would highly recommend Louis and Kevin's fun/cool house on Capital Hill! "
5259194,30347084,2015-04-20,5409381,Molly,"Louis was an incredibly warm and generous host. We arrived a little later than planned and was greeted with nothing but smiles and parking (which is really difficult to find in the area). 

The house is simply charming with artistic touches throughout. Including his two adorable cats Sam and Little Girl. We will stay there again the next time we're in Seattle."
5259194,30460669,2015-04-22,11559792,Lisa,"Louis was a great host; he made arrival very smooth.

The room was perfect and the bed was one of the most comfortable we have ever slept in! Our hosts made us feel comfortable and welcome and they were very helpful with restaurant and sightseeing suggestions. They are in a great central location in the city so you can walk or take a bus pretty much everywhere. We did not rent a car and did not feel like we needed one to get around. They also had a Keurig for their guests to make coffee/tea in the morning which we thought was a nice touch. Thank you Louis and Kevin for making our trip a great one! We would absolutely love to stay with you both again next time we visit Seattle :)
5259194,30635449,2015-04-25,3655529,Alex,"Staying with Louie and Kevin was a great experience. Our flight got in late and Louie was up to happily greet us at 10PM with a free parking spot in the alley behind their home. The house is very clean with a beautiful yard and in a prime location in Capitol Hill. We were 2 blocks from Elysian Brewery, Plum Bistro, and Chop Suey concert venue. Pike Place, Space Needle, and the other touristy spots are all within walking distance also. In the morning we were greeted by their friendly cats and offered coffee where we got to sit and talk all about the city. I'm happy we were able to stay at their home and will do so again! Thanks!!"
5259194,30727244,2015-04-26,331569,Deborah,"Listing description was very accurate, Kevin and Louie's home and garden are beautiful, artistically done and with an inviting warmth.

You first arrive to their home and it's plush and green with the kinda of personality and love that can only be found in a home built on love and time. I literally love everything about their home, though I was barely there and the bed is SUPER comfortable. Happy they shared their home with me!"
5259194,31111590,2015-05-02,29629853,Michael,Absolutely great hosts. They have a beautiful home and are extremely welcoming. They had everything that I needed and provided what I forgot!

5259194,31822045,2015-05-10,13078721,Caleb,"I really enjoyed my stay at Kevin and Louis' place. The house is quirky and full of characters, especially the backyard and garden. The location is just a stone's throw away from Pike/Pine. I walked to downtown Seattle, Pike Place Market, Olympic Sculpture Garden, Space Needle, Kerry Park, Lake Union, and Capitol Hill without using any public transportation. 

Kevin and Louis are very friendly and helpful. I had to make a last minute change to my trip and they were able to accommodate. Will definitely stay there again. Thanks. "

5259194,32965384,2015-05-24,11191641,Drew,"Louis and Kevin were excellent hosts; friendly, relaxed, very accommodating.  My bedroom was clean and comfortable, the bathroom between the bedrooms is small but very clean, plenty of hot water, towels, etc.  A keurig coffee maker with a variety of coffees and teas was available 24hrs. Wifi was good & easy to access. I had stuff in the refrigerator and had access to the stove if needed (I didn't). There's TV to watch if you're so inclined. The house is nicely located, perhaps a mile and a bit from downtown (easy to walk downhill, not so much back up) and half a block from the nearest bus route(s) that will take you downtown or farther out in Seattle. Public transportation is robust. There are lots of coffee shops and restaurants within a five minute walk if you don't want to stray far.  The campus of Seattle University is five blocks away.  
I was there for a week, could not have asked for a better place to stay, or better hosts. "
5259194,33380056,2015-05-27,27726437,Torchiam,"the house is warm and peaceful.

5259194,33915339,2015-06-02,31042326,Samantha,"We had a wonderful stay with Louis and Kevin! They were flexible with our arrival time, despite our plane being delayed, and very welcoming.  They provided a map of Seattle and took the time to point out particular destinations and the best ways to travel around the city, which was very helpful! They have a lovely home and the bedroom and bathroom were great. I hope to get back to Seattle soon and would stay there again!"
5259194,34414521,2015-06-08,66287,Ingrid,"Louis and Kevin were great hosts! They immediately made us feel welcome even though we arrived late at night.  The location of their place is perfect, super close to Capital Hill, and the room is just as described.  We'd definitely recommend their place to stay in Seattle!"
5259194,34592114,2015-06-09,34405585,Rebecca,"Had a wonderful experience staying here. This was my girlfriend and I first time using air bnb and it could not have been better. The hosts were extremely nice and welcoming right from the beginning. It was also our first time visiting Seattle and they let us have a map of fun things to do around the city. The house is not only clean and comfortable, but also walking distance to downtown and numerous parks, restaurants, and bars. We were there on a Sunday so we were able to park right on the street for free with no problem.  Hopefully we will be back to Seattle and we would not hesitate to stay at this place again!"
5259194,34849724,2015-06-13,29034328,Lewis,Louie and Kevin are amazing hosts!   Their are very welcoming and full of helpful suggestions on what to see and do!
5259194,35042267,2015-06-14,31376139,Xiao,"We stayed for one night and arrived late in the evening and departed quite early next morning. Louis and Kevin were so considerate that they left the keys to us with so much trust and make everything in perfect order.

Louis and Kevin's house is one of the best I have ever seen in design and styles. I even love more their two cats, they are as friendly as their hosts.:-)

I would love to stay at the same place next time and recommend to my friends!"
5259194,35344857,2015-06-17,4515155,Bronson,"Wow, this was the best AirBnb experience ever! Louis & Kevin's house is in a great location, walkable to tons of restaurants, bars, bookstores, and tons of tourist attractions in Seattle. Our room was big, comfortable, clean, and gorgeous, like the rest of the house. There is a nice living room outside the guest rooms, and front and back porches to hang out on as well. We shared a bathroom with the guest in another room, but we hardly saw the other guest and it felt very private. Kevin and Louis are mostly on the 2nd floor, so we didn't feel like we were crowding them. Coffee and filtered water are available in the dining room. 

The back yard was filled with flowers, and we had our coffee on the back porch every morning. And we got to spend some time getting to know Kevin and Louis, and they are lovely people! We were sad to leave! "
5259194,35429540,2015-06-18,35636098,Jeff,We had a great stay at Louis & Kevin's place. The house feels more like a lake cabin and it's just a short walk downtown. They both made us feel very welcome and we'd love to stay again. The gardens that surround the house made it easy to forget we were so close to downtown Seattle.
5259194,35549254,2015-06-20,26249915,Brian,We had a wonderful first experience with an airbnb stay.  Louis and Kevin have a charming older home with a delightful garden on Cap Hill.  Clean room with a equally clean shared bathroom.  Coffee in the morning- what more could one need.  Parking can be a tricky proposition but is manageable and we had no problem.  Loved our stay and would recommend this to anyone as long as they can negotiate stairs.  Louis and Kevin could not have been more helpful with information and suggestions during our stay.  Great AirBNB hosts.
5259194,35659936,2015-06-21,21286215,Aaron,Louis and Kevin are excellent hosts. We were warmly welcomed into their home and enjoyed our stay.  The house is spacious and ideally located in the Capital Hill neighborhood within walking distance to many of Seattle's attractions.  Kevin was generous with his time and suggested a number of places to visit in the neighborhood.
5259194,35941331,2015-06-23,3572325,Christina,"Louis and Kevin welcomed us into their home in the trendy Capitol Hill area, a part of town that is full of fun bars and restaurants. We had rented a car and were worried about finding a place to park it, but Louis and Kevin showed us a designated spot behind their house. Their home is otherwise very walkable to major points of interest within Seattle and very close to the bus stop. The room and bathroom were very clean and spacious with lots of character. We also very much appreciated Louis and Kevin's recommendations on what to see and eat around town. We would definitely stay with them again!"
5259194,36129262,2015-06-25,35421327,Michael,"We had a wonderful time staying with Louis and Kevin. We arrived in Seattle before our check-in time and they let us come by early and drop off our bags. When we got to the house they sat down with us, went over a few maps of the neighborhood and gave us the lay of the land. It was great to be able to sit down and pick their brains about where we wanted to go and the neighborhood spots they loved. We got a great breakfast/brunch recommendation and found out about an exhibit at the EMP museum that we would have found out about on our own. 

Great location, very walkable neighborhood, tons of closet space in our room! "
5259194,36250326,2015-06-26,34528599,Lucia,"The room and the bathroom clean and perfectly suited our needs. Luis was a great host, very caring and helpful, gave us great tips for visitor's attractions in Seattle. We would recommend it to everybody."
5259194,36768358,2015-07-01,30484127,Rachel,Louis and Kevin were the BEST of hosts.  They made us feel right and home and gladly gave us the lay of the area with maps and a weath of information. They have toiletries and such if you forget yours and they were great to share a glass of wine with. I would highly recommend their place and conversation.
5259194,37166026,2015-07-05,32385139,Martha,Kevin and Louis were wonderful hosts! They have a lovely home and openly welcomed us by giving us city recommendations and even a cup of coffee each morning. Their neighborhood is full of life and lots of quality restaurants. We couldn't have been more happy!
5259194,37375550,2015-07-06,14453508,Angie,"Louis greeted us at the door with a smile and showed us directly to our room. It was warm, inviting, clean. We received a quick tour of the house - the public spaces and our bathroom. We met Kevin a short while later, and was invited to sit down with them, and with a map of the Capital Hill neighborhood (and beyond). We got the lay of the land, they talked about their favorite places, the where-to-gos and the must-dos in Seattle. They answered all our questions. Their house is lovely and so comfortable and a great starting place for exploration. They have a sweet front porch for a lovely chat - thank you Louis. They were gracious hosts, I enjoyed talking with them. I would definitely stay again. "
5259194,37565111,2015-07-08,32993004,Begonia,"Louis and Kevin are a great host. Their place is homey, safe and clean. One block away from the Seattle U. I had a great stay. Thanks Guys."

I certainly will come back!"

They are very nice and helpful to my travel. I also cooked breakfast and dinner here, here let me feel easy. Thanks very much."
5259194,38522238,2015-07-16,35539879,Kim,"We felt us very welcome. And it is a very nice home and close to the City center and attractions.  Everything was clean and good atmosphere
"
5259194,39271845,2015-07-22,31302022,Nora,"Louis and Kevin were so nice. They gave us suggestions. They are helpful. There are also many shops and restaurants nearby. They made us feel at home. I like their house very much, especially the garden. If I go to Seattle again, I will definitely stay in their house again."
5259194,39400075,2015-07-23,22053474,Tara,"Clean,  comfortable,  convenient and quiet.  An ideal setting.  Would absolutely stay again.  Also... cats!!!"
5259194,40084731,2015-07-28,30536646,Rodrigo,"Something very special happened here. An almost instant affinity began a delightfully pleasant experience and a remarkable feeling of belonging.  These hosts, Kevin and Louie are gentle, funny, affectionate and respectful. We had coffee, beer & broke bread with these new friends. Airbnb as a experiment was cool.  Airbnb with the right people is an unforgettable experience. I highly recommend this home. We miss you guys. Wish you had a home in Vancouver. Xo Fans & Rodrigo"
5259194,40470384,2015-07-31,36671251,Rick,"My girlfriend and I really enjoyed our stay at Louis's and Kevin's house.  They were very responsive to my messages and questions prior to our visit, and they welcomed us right away upon our arrival.  The house was clean and was a very comfortable place to stay.  We really liked the Capitol Hill location.  There are multiple dining options nearby, and we were able to walk or bus to any location we wanted to visit.  We would definitely stay with Louis and Kevin again, and we recommend their place as a great place to stay when visiting Seattle.  "
5259194,40696635,2015-08-01,6086627,Sarah,"Louis and Kevin were very welcoming, and their house is beautiful and conveniently located. We had a great stay in Seattle. "
5259194,41035653,2015-08-03,39966974,Kathryn,"Louis and Kevin were welcoming and considerate hosts. The house was very clean, and had a wonderful creative vibe. We really enjoyed our stay.  A highlight was sitting out on the front and back porches, particularly the back porch looking over a fun garden. 

The location in Capitol Hill is near many restaurants... very lively at night. We were there when the weather was quite warm. There is no AC, but the house stayed pretty comfortable, and we did not need to turn on the fan in our bedroom.

I would love to stay there again."
5259194,41924375,2015-08-10,10154161,Becky,"Louis & Kevin are super cool hosts, and their house is charming, and the cats are sweet and adorable, and the neighborhood is *awesome* (and conveniently on a direct bus route to the Seattle Center!). We were out most of the time, so we didn't get a chance to hang out with our hosts, but they were super nice when we got in and gave us lots of recommendations for stuff to do and places to eat around Seattle. A+++++++ would definitely come back!"
5259194,42478530,2015-08-13,40752018,Tommy,"We stayed three nights in this lovely house with a great location. Capitol Hill's cafés, bars and restaurants were within a walking distance, yet the area was nice and peaceful.  The room was spacious, tidy and comfortable, as well as the bathroom we shared with another guest. A coffee maker and kitchen facilities were offered to our use. Luis and Kevin were warm hosts who offered sightseeing tips and advice for how to get around. In addition, the beautiful garden in the backyard made us forget we were in the core of the vibrant and lively city of Seattle. We'd definitely stay there again! "
5259194,42824925,2015-08-16,7473690,Emmanuel,"Superbe maison à 20 min à pied de downtown dans un quartier très agréable.
Louis et Kevin sont des hôtes très sympathiques qui font tout pour que le séjour se passe bien."
5259194,43379083,2015-08-19,3202492,Frank,"We had a really great stay at Louis & Kevin's place. The location on Cap Hill is very centrally located, within walking distance to a number of great restaurants and bars on Pike St, and pretty close to downtown as well. The bedroom itself is spacious and includes a ""walk in closet"", which was very convenient. We especially loved the two cats who live here: they were very friendly, loved to be petted, and would greet us at night when we came home. Overall a great experience and we would definitely stay here again!"
5259194,43531070,2015-08-20,12573931,Emma,"Louis and Kevin were great hosts- they were very communicative, gave us helpful local tips and the room was very clean. The house is located close to the sights of Capitol Hill and it is also conveniently located to visit the other areas of Seattle. "
5259194,43781915,2015-08-22,7315876,Kate,"Louis and Kevin are wonderful hosts.  The room was perfect in every way--comfortable bed, spacious closet, good reading light.   The house is in a vibrant neighborhood within easy walking distance to downtown.  Kevin and Louis made helpful suggestions of places to go based on our interests.  We are only sorry we did not have time to enjoy their beautiful back deck."
5259194,43929383,2015-08-23,17477014,Kyle,"When we arrived, Louis and Kevin were out of the house for a minute, we gave them a large window we'd be there so this was totally cool. There was another guest there who let us un. We LOVED their house, built in the early 1900's with it's quirky touches and modern conveniences. The room we stayed in was the perfect size for two. We had a coffee/water station right our our door which was nice. VERY close proximity to Capitol Hill, but also secluded up and back from the street so it stayed pretty quiet. We were given a key and invited to come a go as we pleased. Overall, a very ideal situation for those wanting to stay near Capitol Hill!"
5259194,44324184,2015-08-25,39025658,Alberto,"Fun House is very charming. Louis & Kevin are kind and welcoming. Room and bathroom are clean and spacious. What can ask for more?
My only regret was not having enough time to chat more with the guys."
5259194,44775010,2015-08-29,28725309,Darnelle,"Louis and Kevin made me and my son feel welcome right away. The house and great, clean and close to downtown and everywhere we wanted to visit. 
They have two adorable cats that my son would have rather play with all day than visit Seattle. 
I am so happy to have stay there. Louis and Kevin made my stay so much better and where so patient with my son. "
5259194,45243451,2015-09-01,6542114,Barbara,"Louis and Kevin are gracious and personable hosts who made us feel instantly welcome. They clearly love their neighborhood and their city, and marked maps for us with things to see and do based on our interests. We had great wide-ranging conversations with them on their rain-protected back porch looking over a lovely, lovingly-cared-for garden. The house is old, with tons of personality, and we were very comfortable. The two cats are friendly and playful (Sam likes to be petted but not picked up). It was our first time in the Capitol Hill neighborhood. We liked the vibe: a mix of gay and straight, young and old, with loads of small restaurants and unusual shops, but still just enough grit to keep it real. Downtown sightseeing is a convenient half-hour walk, which seemed quite safe to us, even at night. We hope to stay there again on future visits to Seattle."
5259194,45506710,2015-09-03,10011864,Marina,"Louis and Kevin are great hosts, they really make you feel at home. Their house is beautifully decorated and cozy. I really enjoyed the neighborhood, with plenty of good cafes and restaurants. "

They responded quickly to the request and had the room ready to go. They were delightful hosts and even gave us recommendations and a map of places to go and see in the area. We had a really great time, I would highly recommend staying with Louis and Kevin! "
5259194,47069692,2015-09-15,345465,Megan,"Kevin and Louis were wonderful and accommodating. They always answered messages promptly, which was especially good when my travel plans unexpectedly changed last minute due to a cancelled connecting flight. Their house is beautifully decorated and impeccably kept. Although I'm normally a light sleeper, I got an excellent nights sleep on the comfortable bed. I also noticed that the neighborhood, although adjacent to some many great restaurants and bars, was nearly silent."
5259194,47224874,2015-09-16,14533985,Gillian,It was great to meet Louis and Kevin who were most welcoming on our arrival. They gave us lots of good suggestions and advice about the local area and things to see downtown. The room was comfortable and the house was well-appointed and tastefully decorated. They made us feel at home and we enjoyed our conversations with them.
5259194,47588870,2015-09-20,17206281,Doug,"Louis and Kevin were wonderful hosts. Their home was very clean, and the bed was comfortable. As soon as I arrived, Kevin let me drop my stuff off, gave me great suggestions for things to explore the city, and marked down all of the relevant sites on a printed out map. For someone new to Seattle, this really made a big difference for me. 

They were very responsive to any emails or texts. After I left, I for some reason thought I had left my bathroom bag (even though I had taken it with me), and they quickly checked the house and got back to me. 

Lastly, the location was phenomenal. Very close to all of the restaurants in Capitol hill, and only a 25 minute walk to downtown. Very much recommended.
"
5259194,48082810,2015-09-23,38647686,Andy,"Both Kevin and Louis (and the cats) were very friendly and also helpful, with local recommendations regarding Volunteer park and a local (vegan) place to eat. The house is lovely with some great art work to look at. It is in a great location, walkable to downtown and near lots of interesting places around Capitol Hill. "
5259194,48310846,2015-09-25,43047695,Faye,"We were very warmly welcomed by Kevin and the cats, and shown everything we needed to know about their home, restaurants, and sites to see.
The description was totally accurate.  The bed was extremely comfortable.  I slept soundly both nights.  I was grateful for the one cup coffee maker and that it was ready to go.   We also loved the backyard garden.  It was not only a great place to sit and enjoy the perfect weather, but I took about 50 pictures. Kevin credited Louis with creating this very inviting space.
We found the neighborhood to be delightful.  We especially loved that public transportation was very convenient."
5259194,48483789,2015-09-26,3833192,Aurélien & Honorine,"We had a wonderful time at Louis & Kevin's place. The room is perfect, with a very confortable bed. Louis & Kevin are lovely host. They gave us very good advices on what to see and do in Seattle. Definitely a good address :). "

The house is fantastic with a gorgeous yard. Louis and Kevin were very helpful with information and incredibly welcoming. And it was great to have coffee!"
5259194,49799409,2015-10-06,5987676,Greg,"Louis & Kevin are so super sweet and welcoming. They have a lot of great pointers for seeing the city and their home is absolutely adorable. 

Their place was super close to the conference location I was attending. The room and bed were comfortable and a great place to come back to at the end of the day."
5259194,49954220,2015-10-07,23794909,Jenny,"The home was certainly relaxing and warm. The neighborhood was quiet itself, but surrounded by an amazing array of restaurants, bars, and other happenings. Kevin and Louis were so welcoming, succeeding in making us feel like we were positive additions to their home. Why does anyone bother with hotels?"
5259194,52076098,2015-10-26,11248782,Tom,We had a great stay in Seattle. Kevin was quick with communication and very accommodating to our schedule. The location was close to great places to eat and we loved playing with the house cats. We will definitely look to stay again the next time we are in Seattle. 
5259194,52378519,2015-10-28,20460254,Isaac,My friend and I had a very comfortable stay here. Kevin was super hospitable. I would definitely stay here again. 
5259194,52549067,2015-10-30,16031069,Rosalyn,"I rarely make time to give an Airbnb host a review but Kevin and this beautiful home are worth it 10000% The location was great and Kevin provided me with excellent directions. The century home is beautiful, and made us feel welcome immediately. Clean and spacious, with a couple of crazy cats, and the kittens are nice too ;) Kevin was in town while we visited but unfortunately we missed Louis although I'm sure he's great. Kevin is a thoughtful listener and almost acts as a therapist to his guests, who he treats as well as family. I couldn't rate this listing any higher, it gets my utmost respect. After travelling for 2+ months, I was having a very hard time sleeping with my back injury and Kevin brought me an air mattress that gave me the joyous relief of sleep. He shared tips on places to go that suited our wants and desires and he helped me out the door when I didn't want to leave. He is welcome in my home anytime, anywhere in the world. "
5259194,52865870,2015-11-02,2542244,Michelle,"We really enjoyed our stay with Kevin and Louis. Large, comfortable room and a great location for walking, dining and bar-hopping. Kevin gave us some great recommendations, and we had fun exploring on our own too. "
5259194,53277197,2015-11-07,47138503,Artur & Agata,"Absolutely fantastic. Any recommendation would fall short of the true pleasantness. Louis and Kevin are just the best, very helpful and friendly. They have a very nice and cosy home located in a great neighborhood close to Seattle's downtown. We felt very welcomed there. The room was nice, and the bed was very comfortable. If you are looking for a great place to stay, that's the address."
5259194,53467960,2015-11-09,43112380,Kate,"Louis and Kevin were fantastic hosts for our weekend away. They were very welcoming and helpful with excellent suggestions for places to visit and local restaurants to check out (especially the book store...LOVED it),  and they provided maps and directions. Their neighbourhood has so much to offer! Their house is charming, comfortable, very clean and decorated in a funky eclectic style. We loved the fire on a rainy fall evening and sitting out on the covered porch. Oh, and their sweet cats. We will definitely stay with Louis and Kevin again next time we are in Seattle."
5259194,53833412,2015-11-13,47348675,Kathleen,"Louis & Kevin are the best hosts I've ever met! Their house really felt like home with such a hodgepodge of whimsical décor and two of cutest cats. After a long day walking around brisk Seattle, it always felt so cozy coming back here.

They were very accommodating and very welcoming, even printing out maps of their general area, highlighting all the go-to eateries and pubs around their neighborhood. It was my first time in Seattle and, I must say, Capitol Hill is THE place to be!! The walk down Pike/Pine to downtown is a breeze, but if you've seen it, zigzagging around this neighborhood is a MUST! I already want to go back!

The room was very clean, comfy, quiet, private, with access to the front door or restroom within two steps of your doors. Everything was perfect! Highly recommend staying here; can't wait to come back and visit L&K again! Thanks guys!! (:"
5259194,54319997,2015-11-18,7017027,Kate,"Could not ask for a better place to stay! Kevin and Louis were great hosts, very friendly. From the moment I got there they helped me navigate the city and restaurants to try. The room was beautiful and I hope to come back to Seattle soon."
5259194,54981593,2015-11-27,12914206,Tracy,"Kevin and Louis were so welcome and inviting in staying in their home!  I have a mobility disability and they met me at the car and carried my suitcase in which was greatly appreciated!  Once I got situated and discussed my plans for the week, Louis spent time with me to suggest some alternative activities and places.  I wish I had taken their suggestions more, but I had a full schedule with area friends.  My mother joined me partway through the trip, and they were equally welcoming to her.  

The accommodations were just as described, and as a cat owner myself I really enjoyed playing with their cats - it distracted me from missing my own!  I was out late most nights, but I know that they were making fires some of the nights.  A couple of my friends got to meet them as well, and really enjoyed getting to know them and talking about their home and the area.

If you're lucky enough to get into their calendar, you won't regret staying with Kevin and Louis!  The location was nicely situated downtown, and they allowed me to park behind their house rather than deal with street parking.  If you like a lot of interaction with your hosts, they're both very warm and friendly, and if you're away or prefer your space, that's equally an option.

Thank you SO much for your hospitality gentleman!  When I come out to search out apartments next year I'll be sure to look you up!"
5259194,55084687,2015-11-27,19452313,David,"Louis let me in and was very friendly. He showed me around the house and was overall very pleasant. It was a very nice house and a great location. A+, would stay again."
5259194,55472912,2015-12-01,17562069,Alex,"After spending 2 nights at Louis & Kevin's house I can't really recommend it enough. Upon arrival, Louis welcomed us into their home, gave us tips of the area and had even printed out maps (which came in super handy). Kevin was equally as welcoming when we met the day after too. The room/house is nicely decorated (love the framed leaves) and comfortable, there's a Keurig for morning coffee and you're close to Pike-Pine/Capitol Hill/Downtown, so all bases covered! We were given plenty of space and whilst we didn't need too much help, I am sure K + L would have been on hand straight away.

If you're travelling to Seattle and want a great place to stay with lovely hosts then I wouldn't look elsewhere. Thanks Louis and Kevin!"
5259194,56076101,2015-12-08,6849124,Peter,"A very welcoming, clean and cozy bed and breakfast. Louis and Kevin are very friendly, easy to talk with, and accommodating as hosts."
5259194,56320266,2015-12-12,49312826,Erica,"If every Air Bnb experience is as wonderful as staying at Louis and Kevin's in Seattle, my fellow travelers and I are truly blessed! They are informative and kind, their home immaculate and cozy (fireplace crackling at night!) and their cats cuddly and fun! Plus, their location in Capitol Hill has great places to eat and lots of character! Thanks, gentlemen, for a delightful stay!"
5259194,56424919,2015-12-13,6559540,Emi,"Kevin and Louis were wonderful. They were extremely welcoming, pointing out the best restaurants and bars in the area and even sitting with us to talk about Canadian politics and urban studies. The room was lovely -- perfect for two people and also very clean. I would definitely recommend them and hope to stay there again when I visit Seattle. "
5259194,56669511,2015-12-16,19421726,Ashley,"This is a wonderful place to stay! It is very close to a lot of restaurants and bars in capital hill, and pretty close to the more touristy attractions (space needle, pike place market, etc.). The room is comfy and cozy with a nice bed, perfect for 2 people.  Louis and Kevin were wonderful hosts! Very helpful and accommodating, and lovely to chat with.  Their two cats are adorable and friendly, and even like to cuddle with guests! Overall, this is a great place to stay when visiting Seattle.  I can't recommend it enough!"
5259194,56777598,2015-12-18,28895487,Pierre,"Nous avons été parfaitement reçu par Louis et Kevin. La chambre était très confortable, la maison charmante et idéalement située. Nous recommandons chaleureusement ce logement.

"
5259194,57161446,2015-12-22,16068734,Jason,"Louis and Kevin provided me with warm hospitality on my trip to Seattle. They responded to my request very quickly, and were happy to accommodate my arrival after a late flight.  The room was clean, comfortable, really all I could ask for, and the location was super-convenient."
5259194,57402833,2015-12-25,8441863,Keith,"Location. Location. Location. Louis and Kevin's home was incredibly charming, had plenty of character, and did I mention location? Kevin greeted us on our first day in Seattle with maps in hand and took the time to sit down with us to make sure we had a good feel for the city. Given Kevin and Louis' extensive time in the area, they were able to recommend a number of activities for us to do based upon our interests. Whether it was a new restaurant in town, a bookstore, or a museum, Kevin and Louis were able to point us in the right direction. They were fantastic hosts and always made themselves available, even for small talk as we would usually recount our day exploring the city. 

In addition, the room was more than accommodating. To begin, just a few steps outside of our room, Kevin and Louis provided filtered water and a Keurig for hot coffee and tea. They also included candies to nibble on which was a nice little touch. The bedroom and bathroom were very clean, and the flannel sheets were a great addition to an extremely comfy bed. The room also hosted a large closet with extra heavy blankets for chilly nights.   

This was a five star stay. I highly recommend Kevin and Louis as hosts for your next stay in Seattle. "
4251426,28122162,2015-03-18,7050617,Rob,Pretty good location and great views of the city. Had all we needed. Appreciate the customer support too!
4251426,38490252,2015-07-16,31979832,Robin,"This condo is lovely and very well managed. The pre-visit communication was clear and the check-in experience was easy and quick. The neighborhood was superb - steps to the vibrant waterfront and only a block or two to Pike Place Market. Many excellent restaurants and shops are all around. The views from the condo and balcony are beautiful and the place was spotless with all the amenities and items one could need. This property cannot be considered luxury-level, but it is above-average for sure. The pool/spa area was enjoyable and our limited interractions with on-site staff were very positive. Parking was a breeze. The weird Soviet-style floor-standing AC wasn't very efficient but it was adequate. The bed was very cozy. The couch could be better. I'd consider this good value and I give it two thumbs up!"
4251426,51776814,2015-10-24,21377767,Seung Oh,"아름다운 숙소였습니다. 뭐하나 빠짐없이 잘 구비되어 있었고 청소상태도 매우 깔끔했구요. 그런데 문제가 있었습니다.
저희 일행중 한명이 따로 자동차 랜트를 했었는데 차량 주차가 한대 밖에 되지 않았던점.. 그리고 저희 일행의 차가 도둑을 맞아 트렁크에 있던 가방을 분실하였습니다. 아파트 자체 주차장 관리가 제대로 되고 있지 않았던것 같습니다. 좀더 안전한 여행을 위해 이 문제점은 꼭 해결되어야 할것 같습니다."
8036985,45026199,2015-08-30,4425500,Will,"Ciara was a fabulous host, and met us immediately upon our arrival.  The location could not be better, and the studio is gorgeous and clean!  Everything is easily walkable from their location whether it be Pike Place Market, the space needle, or amazing dinners at the many wonderful restaurants and bars in Belltown!  This place is perfect!"
8036985,45443824,2015-09-02,4145158,Walt,"The apartment is absolutely lovely and is located close to everything in downtown. I arrived to see a fully furnished studio apartment and everything was well arranged and prepared. I even have a gift box full of goodies and a starbucks card! The ref was also fully stocked with drinks. Complete plates, cups, utensils as well as cooking pans etc. The bathroom is huge and clean. Above all, the apartment offers the privacy you would need as you have the apartment all to yourself. Something I value most when using Airbnb. 

Overall, the apartment is great! We had some technical issues with internet but nothing enough to outweigh how great the apartment is."
8036985,45546303,2015-09-03,3664245,Jayne,"Ciara was a wonderful host, she responded to every question we had very quickly and warmly. The apartment is truly in a perfect part of Seattle, easy access to most attractions and very trendy. 

The apartment itself was adorable, beautifully decorated, and very clean. Exactly what we were hoping for.

"
8036985,46042054,2015-09-07,42333596,Beth,"Great place to stay in a convenient location! Right in the heart of downtown and 10 mins from almost anywhere! Ciara made my experience easy by being accommodating to our check in and check out time, giving us an apartment overview and welcome kit with wine and snacks, and having the place clean with lots of amenities. She was also very responsive to messages and questions which made me know I picked the right place!

The only con was parking. I got a ticket even though I paid, bummer!"
8036985,46207217,2015-09-08,42337234,Cynthia,My friend and I stayed for the evening downtown. The hosts were so accommodating and so nice. The apartment was so clean and decorated beautifully. It was a lovely stay. It felt like I was in a hotel. They helped us with parking. There was a book of popular Seattle attractions and restaurants that they had put together. Ciara was so welcoming and helpful. I look forward to using this apartment in the future. 
8036985,46341304,2015-09-09,15738568,Nathaniel,"I chose Ciara's place over a room at the Hyatt on Denny. They were comparable, but Ciara's was a little less expensive and a little closer to where I wanted to be. I'm glad I chose Ciara's place. It was just as described; clean, modern, and comfortable. I would definitely recommend the studio to anyone who wanted to stay in Belltown."
8036985,46536050,2015-09-11,9464458,Julie,Ciara was a fabulous host and always responded to my questions immediately. The studio is really cute and comfortable and in a great location with lots of good restaurants in the neighborhood. I go to Seattle a lot for work and will definitely stay here again.
8036985,46653182,2015-09-12,29578369,L. A.,"The loft was very clean and centrally located. The owner made the process easy, and was easy to communicate with. The only negative about the entire experience was there wasn't air conditioning in the building. So after long days of walking the street it was a little muggy even with the windows open. I would highly recommend this place to people!"
8036985,46948065,2015-09-14,1288008,Carolyn,"Ciara was incredibly attentive and made sure all of our needs were met. She was accommodating to our schedule too, which was a huge plus! The studio is really nice and spacious and fit our needs. I would definitely recommend staying here."

8036985,47512649,2015-09-19,42652284,Navy,"Ciara was an awesome host! She was very attentive and communicated with us before, during, and after our stay. She provided very easy and straight-forward directions upon checking in. It was a breeze. Her studio was stunning and our stay was pleasant. The location was ideal, especially that restaurants and bars were walking distances. And also, tourist attractions weren't as far either! She provided us with some refreshments, necessities in the bathroom, and a cute note when we arrived! I would recommend Ciara's studio for any who'd like to stay in the downtown area of Belltown! Very up and coming hip area. "
8036985,47791915,2015-09-21,13112955,Reilly,"Ciara was communicative and very helpful. The place was quite nice and in a great location. I would recommend bringing earplugs if you're a light sleeper, the noise from the street can be pretty loud if the windows are open."
8036985,48102093,2015-09-23,41586308,Hk,"Home away from home in Seattle. It's cozy apartment and have everything you need right in the heart of everything. Checking in was a breeze with Ciara providing precise instructions. 

You could walk easily to downtown Seattle, Pike Market and even the Space Needle."
8036985,48419203,2015-09-26,2199044,Laura,"We were in Seattle visiting our niece.  Ciara's condo was perfect for my sister and I.  It was just as described.  Very neat and clean.  We were welcomed with a nice greeting on a chalkboard and an umbrella, (just in case).  She even left slippers for us to use.  I would definitely recommend staying here.  It is walking distance to everything, space needle, pike's place, sculpture park and the waterfront.  Ciara was very helpful from our booking all the way until we checked out.  She answered any questions we had very quickly.  If you're traveling to Seattle, definitely check this place out."
8036985,48953888,2015-09-29,44757056,James,Ciara was a great host and very responsive to any questions we had.  My wife and I were first time Airbnb users are didn't really know what to expect but the check in process was extremely easy and everything went without a bump.  The unit was nice and exactly as described.  Nice neighborhood and good location where you can walk to most anything.  I would definitely stay at Ciara's place again if in Seattle. Very cool rooftop deck with grills and stuff.
8036985,49151749,2015-10-01,19980109,James,"Perfect place to stay during your visit to Seattle. Everything went smoothly, and Ciara was a great hostess. Close to everything."
8036985,49299927,2015-10-02,4606640,Jenny,"Ciara made me feel welcome from the moment we were in touch. She was very thorough in all our interactions, especially with all of the necessary details to access her apartment- the check-in was flawless! I was beyond thrilled to enter her gorgeous flat (exactly as advertised!) to a friendly welcome note handwritten on her whiteboard. It was such a nice touch after a long journey, and I felt right at home. What a perfect place to hang my hat and explore the city. "
8036985,50474662,2015-10-12,6788463,Matt,"A great space and a great host.  Ciara was very accommodating and the location is great, particularly if you're using transit.

Check in was easy, and Ciara made sure we were set on all basic supplies.

Definitely recommend!"
8036985,50798887,2015-10-14,2657447,Lambert,"Great location and space, as it is walking distance to most attractions nearby.  Host was extremely attentive to needs and provided recommendations for places to eat and go.  Would definitely stay there again and recommend to all as a go to spot."
8036985,51074787,2015-10-17,45361294,Cristina,"Ciara is a very prompt communicator -- she accepted our request within 5 minutes and was extremely responsive to questions. Her instructions were quite thorough, which I appreciated.

She is also a wonderful host -- we were welcomed with a sweet message on the whiteboard, and she stocked the fridge with some pop, hot chocolate, water and cider for us. She provides a list of sites to see and restaurants to try, as well.

Her apartment is beautifully decorated! I loved it -- very clean, very quaint. Be aware that it does get noisy at nighttime. You will hear the buses and people shouting at nighttime, especially.

Her apartment is in an awesome location -- walking distance from Pike's Place and the space needle. Belltown is an incredible area -- lots of places to eat and shop at. We walked around so much! Loved it!

There is also a link station nearby to take you over to the airport -- it's about a 35 minute ride."
8036985,51298173,2015-10-19,6714514,Helen,Ciara was a great host. She responds quickly to our questions and is accommodating. The apartment was clean when we arrived and had everything we needed for a short trip. She even provided courtesy water and soda. The location is close to most Seattle attractions and public transportation. I recommend this place. 
8036985,51645042,2015-10-22,45771510,Kristen,"As first- time AirBnB users, my husband and I were very pleased with the ease of the whole experience. Ciara was great communicating throughout the process and made everything a breeze. Her place is in a great location- easy waking to several tourist attractions and downtown. Overall fantastic experience all- around. I would definitely stay here again. "
8036985,51913401,2015-10-25,36338727,Paul,"This place was excellent!  Pictures did not do it justice. The apartment was very clean, modern, and had great storage and counter space.  Ciara was very helpful with the whole process and responded quickly to our questions throughout our stay.  The apartment is steps away from a bus stop and grocery store, and a very short walk from tons of shopping and Pike's Place Market. Our friends also used Airbnb, but their places were overpriced by far in comparison. In a nutshell: we won't bother looking for other places if this one is available for our next trip to Seattle. "
8036985,52201129,2015-10-26,42343694,Kat,Great location! Just a short walk to Pike's Place Market and the Crocodile. The neighborhood was pretty nice. Ciara was a helpful host. This was my first airbnb experience and it went very smoothly. Ciara made a list of things to do in Seattle and provided us with wifi access. The studio was clean. The building was nice and quiet.
8036985,52699400,2015-11-01,2862619,Dan,Ciara's place was nicely centrally located and delivered to us in a clean manner along with detailed instructions.

8036985,53302309,2015-11-07,41581945,Kirsten,"Ciara was a wonderful host. The apartment had all the accommodations we needed, including a nice handwritten welcome message.

8036985,53930359,2015-11-14,11454338,Wes,"The apartment was clean, easily accessible, and in a great location. Our host, Ciara was prompt, courteous, and made the whole process super simple and quick. Couldn't be happier with the experience. "
8036985,54110028,2015-11-16,28989057,Cheryl,"Ciara was great to work with. She was extremely responsive and went the extra mile to allow us to check in a bit early. Her studio is comfortable and stylishly decorated and it is in a great area, walkable to everything we wanted to do. I just wish she could have prevented Saturday's rain ;)"
8036985,54273863,2015-11-17,47857796,Ruandy,"Ciara made me feel very welcome and communication with her through texting was great! She was very helpful as far as helping me find any local spots I might need. The studio apt was clean and very cozy. A pleasure to have stayed at. 

Neighborhood was also great with tons of places to eat and shops within walking distance.  I'd recommend this place to a friend and stay here again. Thanks Ciara! "
8036985,54453591,2015-11-20,4514077,Laura,"Love this place! Ciara was great.  The information about he apartment is accurate.  Easy to find, centrally located, parking.  Will stay again!"

The building was quiet and close to everything. We easily were able to walk everywhere and Ciara's suggestions of local places to eat and visit were really helpful. Ciara was always quick to respond to our texts and was super accommodating to our last minute late check out request. We will definitely stay here again! 
8036985,55002135,2015-11-27,2313678,Portia,"Ciara was a wonderful host. Before the trip, she reached out via text to provide all sorts of information and was always one text away. When we checked in, she had written a nice handwritten note to welcome us (which was a thoughtful gesture). 

Her apartment was super clean, cute and in a great location. It was close to Shiro's (a sushi restaurant that is one block away) and close to the Space Needle. We will definitely go back and stay at her place again when we're in Seattle!"
8036985,55371768,2015-12-01,14419873,Daniel,"Really good and friendly host - the little touches provided were very much appreciated. Very clear communication and instructions, checking in and out was a breeze. Loved the clean sheets, towels and kitchenette. Apartment is in a great location and cosy, as described. Can get a little chilly in the winter (for guests from the tropics) as central heating isn't strong and only seems to be switched on certain hours. Lovely spacious bathroom but it can get cold!"
8036985,55832554,2015-12-06,19186005,Sue,"Everything was awesome, Ciara was super easy to communicate with and the location of her place is outstanding.  No complaints at all!"

Nice quite neighborhood.  The Studio was just like the pics.  Was very comfortable and relaxing.  Easy walk to the downtown shopping area of Seattle, Seattle Center and Pike's market.  Having parking in the parking garage was great.  Much easier to load on unload my baggage.  
Ciara had a very nice welcome note as I entered the studio.   We be coming back in the future and have no doubts about renting this again.   "
8036985,56939165,2015-12-20,34337743,Marc,"Great host, great location, beautiful studio. Will come back next time!"
8036985,57902018,2015-12-30,1614744,Robyn,"Check in and check out where very easy.  Ciara provided great instructions on access to parking and the apartment.  When a few minor issues came up, Ciara quickly took care of them.  The apartment was clean and had everything we needed.  It was great to be so close to the Space Needle and Pike Place Market so we could walk.  This apartment is everything you would need for a stay in Seattle, and the free parking is a great bonus."
6115704,32377801,2015-05-17,8759543,Ana," We loved our stay in this apartment. It has such an astonishing view for which we were partially prepared from the photos. You have to experience it to fully enjoy it. Another good thing is that apartment is in the middle of everything so we could get everywhere on foot. Pike Place Market and shops as literally under the apartment, but you can also find great restaurants and bars near by.

We haven't seen our host, but Luly prepared info for us and responded to all my questions quickly. It was a short but great week in Seattle. "
6115704,33138017,2015-05-25,5642839,Davide,"Great experience! The apartment is perfectly located in downtown Seattle, few minutes on foot form the light rail stop and the Pike Market, with a spectacular view of the bay and the Olympic national park. Very comfortable. People at the concierge are very friendly. L and her manager promptly responded to our questions. Highly recommended."
6115704,34210795,2015-06-06,29245540,Lee Anne,"This is a beautiful condo with a spectacular view of the market and Puget Sound.  Couldn't ask for anything else.  It was very relaxing to just sit and watch the boats go by...very peaceful.  The accommodations were very comfortable and plenty of room to spread out.   The private parking was wonderful - what a plus!  L and her assistant were ready with suggestions and the restaurants suggestions were delicious.   It is very close to everything you need and within walking distance to everything.   If you wanted to, you could even walk to the baseball and football fields. 

We weren't disappointed in anything!  Thanks - we loved Seattle and will recommend L's place to everyone."
6115704,34646105,2015-06-10,1139913,Joseph,Really nice stay in Seattle.  Easy checkin.  Condo is lovely. Even though their was no a/c the condo cooled off nicely at night.   The sofa bed is very comfortable if you req an extra bed. The view is second to none.  I would stay here again. 
6115704,35092229,2015-06-15,31829538,Virginia,"The pictures of this beautiful place do not do it justice.  It was amazing.  The views were to die for and the place was immaculate.  Working with L's team made the check in process a breeze. Andrew contacted me and gave me all the directions I needed to find the place, parking and check in.  The only disappointment was that there was no TV available. The TV was there but the cable was not hooked up in one room and in the room where it was hooked up the cable provider stated on the TV that no channels were available. Needing to view the news for work made that a little difficult but that was very minor.  Very happy with the trip and would definitely stay there again. If you are on the fence, take the plunge there is no way you could ever regret it. Much cheaper than paying for hotel rooms with cars and daily room taxes and surcharges.  The rate was great and the parking free. Thanks so much for your hospitality."
6115704,35561846,2015-06-20,21863782,Amy,Nice condo with beautiful view. Very comfortable. Close to everything and within walking distance. Thank you L and her assistant. We will recommend L's place to everyone.
6115704,36107200,2015-06-25,33394671,Josh,"Great place, the pictures are the actual place. If you want the downtown experience, this is it. Pikes place is a 2 minute walk. Great food in any direction. "
6115704,36387037,2015-06-28,4205722,Sonia,"Beautiful Condo - Beware : NO AC!
We stayed at the condo from June 26-28th 2015! It had a beautiful view with floor to ceiling windows. The condo was located about 2 blocks from Pike Place Market, with lots of restaurants, bars, and coffee shops near by. It was also conveniently located in the same building as the City Target. There was a huge problem with this condo, that we did not realize until we checked into the unit. There is no AC! We arrived in Seattle during a heat wave which dis not help the matter. The temperature inside the condo was sweltering and unbearable. There were also no ceiling fans or regular fans in the apartment. I take the responsibility for obviously missing this while booking. I assumed such a beautiful, modern, upscale accommodation would naturally have a standard amenity  such as AC, I thought wrong and was thoroughly disappointed . We couldn't enjoy the condo because of the heat, there was absolutely no air flow. I had no choice but to go to target and purchase 2 fans which the host did reimburse me for. The fans barely helped the problem. There seem to be some communication issues as well with renting this property. I had originally requested a parking pass which wasn't provided to me at check in. I was simply given a fob with keys on it, so I assumed one of the keys would let us into the parkade. I was wrong, the concierge did not give me a parking pass. After several minutes of driving around, and not having any luck. I had to call the property contact. She wasn't aware that I needed a parking pass, which was surprisingly considering I requested it from the host directly. She was nice enough to meet us and give me the pass. Our main issue is that there was no AC and it wasn't comfortable at all in the apartment. I understand I missed that in the add but I don't want future renters to go through the same discomfort we did.
I also want families and people traveling with children or elderly guests to be aware. It was cooler outside than it was in the condo.
Its such a shame for such a luxury condo. It really takes away from the experience. Even in other seasons, you would need some sort of air movement in the condo, at the moment there is none. I left the two fans I purchased and set up behind for future guests but its not a solution its more of a band aid to the problem. It was very difficult for us to enjoy our stay, or to sleep at night with the temperature being so hot in there. "
6115704,36866169,2015-07-02,27677090,Cathy,"Beautiful condo and incredible views! The location cannot be beat! Photos provide an accurate representation. Only 2 complaints: 1) there is no A/C and the condo has an entire wall of west facing windows....needless to say, the condo heats up during the day.  However, it cools down quickly in the evening if the windows are open; 2) the sofa bed in the office is quite squeaky. Overall, though, a very nice place to stay."
6115704,38836050,2015-07-19,31467281,Rowel,Super easy to get the keys from the concierge... Love all the extra amenities- pool/gym/sauna...unit was clean and well furnished... Enjoyed the balcony and amazing views from all windows.... Made it super convenient to explore the market and surrounding attractions.
6115704,39748073,2015-07-26,32145323,Jessica,"Great condo, great location."
6115704,41933294,2015-08-10,31825747,Mark,"Kendra and Luly were great hosts with a spectacular place to stay. Ideal location, super convenient, close to everything and a view that is simply one of the best in Seattle. We will definitely be back! Thank you!"
6115704,43033656,2015-08-17,17108235,Lp,"Beautiful flat in a convenient location. We just stayed in, enjoying the view. The apartment does not have air-conditioning and that's quite common in Seattle. Opening the windows and the fans kept the place cool. "
6115704,46119671,2015-09-08,27667954,Tom,"The pictures and description of this place were very accurate.  It is a great spot and I would definitely recommend this place.  Walking distance to almost anywhere, and it is clean, and the concierge's were all very friendly.  The hosts were not involved in much of the process, but did respond when I had questions, although not always as fast as I would have hoped.  This ended up being a minor issue, as the building had a leak during our stay on a higher floor, so the concierge had to contact me directly to let me know that there would be some maintenance workers in our apartment.  It would have put me more at ease if the hosts were available right away, as they did not respond to my phone call, and took about a half day to respond via email.  It turned out to all be OK, and I realize this was nothing anyone could anticipate, but it could be improved on.  Again, this would not stop me from recommending this place to others.  It was a great experience and I very much enjoyed it."
6115704,50173809,2015-10-10,5926210,Jessica,"Location, location, location! Great spot, walking distance to everything including the light rail to and from the airport. The view is amazing! Overall, this condo is a nice rental. The pictures are exactly what you get. However, we have used Airbnb several times and this was our most frustrating rental to date.

That being said here are a few things to consider: 

Noise. The condo does not have AC which we were aware of but that required sleeping with the windows open for adequate ventilation; even with the fans. The location places the master bedroom window directly above the Showbox, which is a music venue and the Pike Place market, both of which are very noisy at different times of night/early morning. Bring ear plugs, even if you are a heavy sleeper. 

Second bedroom: Sleeper sofa not comfortable at all. Squeaky and you can feel the wire springs through the mattress. 

Basic amenities: There were no trash bags on site. Also, there was an ironing board but no iron. Coffee maker but no coffee. Minor set backs, but worth mentioning as other airbnb rentals have not overlooked such details. 

Party room: Was advertised as an included amenity and we requested to book it as soon as we made our rental commitment. We were told they would schedule it, no problem. The week we arrived, we were scheduled for using the party room for that Friday night. Two days before our scheduled party, we were emailed to let us know we couldn't use it after all and so we had to scramble to relocate our get together. Not convenient at all. 

Paperwork: We were not sent the additional required paperwork until the week before our trip. Once completed, I had to email it three times, to three different email addresses, before it was actually received. Apparently the owner had a new personal assistant and the building manager was transitioning out of his role, so this may not be a future issue. "
6115704,51056371,2015-10-17,45327465,Tim,"Neighbourhood is great.

It is so close to everything, the markets, good coffee, a supermarket
I loved the view. it was spectacular.

Maggie and Luly were very responsive to us"
6115704,53383553,2015-11-08,8759543,Ana,"This is my second stay in the same apartment and everything was great, same as first time: great location in the center, awesome view, clean apartment, very responsive hosts that helped me with my requests. The only annoyance is the building security screening, but on the other hand, that might make you feel safer."
6115704,55005030,2015-11-27,3108437,Christina,"My husband and I had a fantastic time in Seattle due in large part to a stay at Maggie and Luly's! As advertised this apartment/condo is right in the heart of downtown, in easy walking distance to all of the major tourist spots (Pike's Place, the piers, aquarium, Pioneer Square, Seattle Art Museum, Seattle Public Library, etc). The condo is clean, comfortable and had all the amenities needed, but the real draws for staying are the views and location (A City Target is in the first floor of the building...how handy!). As others have noted, you'll hear bands (email hidden) 12 stories below on the weekends but b/c we stayed in fall/winter and the windows remained closed it wasn't an issue. I would definitely recommend this as a great spot to check out the City (and the free parking space was a huge plus)!"
6115704,57649080,2015-12-28,1163596,Leanne,"Maggie was really responsive to all of my questions - that was super appreciated! The condo has a really gorgeous view (we could watch the great wheel and the ferry boats all day). It was a really great place to stay for a week over the holidays.

Our daughter was happy and comfortable on the sofa bed in the second room. The bed and view in the main bedroom were just perfect.

All of the people at the concierge desk were friendly and helpful.

The location can't be beat if you love being in the middle of the city -- with anything you need nearby and easy delivery to this condo if you don't want to leave."
1961950,23773536,2014-12-09,549525,Tim,"David's little apartment located next to his Bed n Breakfast is a fantastic little stay. 
Firstly, when David meets you at the bed and breakfast he runs next door and the first thing you notice is the impecable attention to detail and cleanliness. This is not a ""bonged out dot comer"" renting their apartment for extra bucks, this is David's business and his whole operation shows that.
The apartment we stayed in, the basement unit, was cozy and well built with utility in mind. The layout, towels and change of beddings (like a hotel!) made are stay all the more pleasurable. He details the height of the ceilings, as it may lead one to feel claustrophobic; however, I am 6'2"" and felt absolutely at ease and comfortable as the place is open and warm feeling.
David provided us with local information and details every possible question you may have in a couple of handouts he gives you when you meet. 
This place was such a good value and perfectly located on a quiet block in Capitol Hill. Apparently we were Davids first renters through AirBNB, knowing how this site works.... (good reviews = bookings) hopefully his unit won't be booked the next time we return.
Thanks David , you are a true proffessional , Airbnb could learn a lot from you. "
1961950,24765676,2015-01-02,23593835,Emily,David and his staff were great and friendly. The place was clean and perfect for the two of us. Kitchen had everything we needed to have a handful of meals in. Place was plenty warm even when the temp. outside hit below freezing. Location was great space needle and pike market were about 30 min. walk away and for places a little further public transportation was close and easy to use. The neighborhood was adorable with lots of little places to eat and a pharmacy and grocery store less than 10 min. walk away. When we checked in David gave us lists of everything we needed to know about the area and some general Seattle information. They were extremely helpful and I carried them with me everywhere. Plus when we checked out we were able to leave our luggage that his next door bed and breakfast until it was time for us to leave. I can't wait to come back to Seattle.
1961950,24992716,2015-01-04,2325006,Hollis,"Bunker 11 is perfect if only for the location.  It's right in the middle of capitol hill.  Short walk to EVERYTHING you'd ever want to see.  The apartment itself is awesome in its own right.  It's a full studio apartment complete with a kitchen, bathroom, sitting area, eating area, etc.  It was, in a word, AWESOME!  David was super friendly, incredibly knowledgeable about Seattle and Cap Hill. I'd stay here every time i came to Seattle if I could. "
1961950,25111973,2015-01-06,25268647,Tiffany,"My friends and I stayed at Bunker 11 for the weekend and it was GREAT! I would definitely stay here again for my next trip to Seattle. The location in Capitol Hill is walking distance to a lot of awesome restaurants and shops. David was very accommodating and helpful, he gave us a list of restaurants to try and attractions to check out. The room was very clean, roomy, and comfortable. I can't wait to come back. "
1961950,25216408,2015-01-09,6033,Cam,"We had a fantastic experience at the bunker 11. Place is big, super clean, fully stocked and well located in Capitol Hill. David was extremely friendly and responsive to all our questions. He is a PRO!! Will definitely come back next time."
1961950,25363383,2015-01-13,25141087,Bryan,"David is a superb host. Very accommodating and communicative. Arrived in the morning and the room was not quite ready. Allowed us to leave our belongings at his B&B. We arrived in our room a few hours later with our bags already in the room. The room was a great studio and spacious as described. Since the B&B was not at capacity he invited us to partake in the breakfasts, but we did not get a chance to. I would definitely come back!"
1961950,25444543,2015-01-16,6172188,Sam,"David was the perfect host and the apartment was perfect and exactly what i was after. 
David was very understanding that due to train delays I was going to be a few hours late and even though I managed to get there before midnight, he was willing to coordinate a place to leave the keys. 
Great location and very clean and sweet little place. Definitely stay there again in the future."
1961950,25686065,2015-01-23,191823,Meredith,Great experience all the way around. I got in early to David's place which was perfect. The place was super clean beautiful practical design and detailing. It has everything you need. Very warm and cosy. Perfect location. David was super informative and sharing of information. Very organized. Would go back and highly recommend staying at David's place.  
1961950,26214929,2015-02-07,25756063,Alison,"David was the absolute best. He made us feel comfortable in the apartment, the neighborhood, the city and the region at large. It felt like we were staying in town with friends, except for more clean and accommodating. This was our first experience with airbnb and we'll never stay in a hotel again. "
1961950,26425389,2015-02-12,3597842,Justin,"David and his place were excellent! Meeting for the keys was easy as he was nearby and accommodating of our late arrival time. The place itself was perfectly (really perfectly) located in safe/happening Capitol Hill, a short walking distance to many bars/shops/eats, and not much further to the downtown area. David was super friendly and knowledgeable of the area, and gave us recommendations on local places to check out. Housekeeping cleaned the place daily (a nice touch along with toiletries and clean towels that make it feel less like you're in someone's home) and the parking space in back is really clutch if you have car - though Seattle doesn't necessarily require one. Would stay here again/ recommend a friend. "
1961950,26825016,2015-02-20,11524138,Isa,"Bunker 11 was a beautiful place to stay. It exceeded my expectations! David was a pleasure to work with. I had a very short stay so I didn't get to use all the amenities. The sheets and bedding smelled fresh and clean, and the pillows were plush and comfy. I have already recommended it to friends who are going up for a visit, and I would definitely book it again if it's available the next time I'm in Seattle!"
1961950,27760505,2015-03-11,26380721,Harry,"David was an excellent, helpful host & Bunker 11 was perfect for our visit to Seattle. It was clean, comfortable, quiet, & relaxing. The Capitol Hill neighborhood Bunker 11 is located in was delightful and was very accessible to downtown Seattle."
1961950,29916200,2015-04-14,26827186,Scott,"David was a great host and bunker 11 was the perfect place to stay for my first visit to Seattle. Very clean and quiet, and close to downtown. Basically able to walk pretty much everywhere! I would definitely recommend to others, I would stay here again."
1961950,36701120,2015-06-30,34742562,Cherilyn,"David met us upon arrival & went over a few necessary rules to know about Bunker 11.  He then took time to go over maps of the nearby businesses & also about downtown & Seattle Center.  He explained how to utilize the bus system.  The free parking by the apartment was perfect.  No public traffic just guests' vehicles.  The apartment was exactly what was advertised.  Clean, spacious, and just right for the 3 of us.  We were only two blocks walking to Broadway street & lots of eating places, a market, pharmacy, etc.  We used the bus system most of time in Seattle & found it very easy to navigate.  We would stay here again!! "
1961950,55521888,2015-12-01,2657292,Mary,"It was clean, in a great location. There was housekeeping daily which was a pleasant surprise! The kitchenette area was very useful also!"
1961950,56833650,2015-12-18,4953057,Marcela,"This place is wonderful. Definitely a great place if your going to be in the area for a few days. Great location. Host  really took the time to think about the guest's visit, had a detailed list of local restaurants and even had makeup remover available with the toiletries."
1961950,57411178,2015-12-25,22717589,Jonathan,"Amazing Room!  The house is older and quaint, but the interior of the room is modern and bright.  Great facilities (kitchen, bathroom, clothes shelving and parking all fantastic).

Will absolutely stay here again!"
4106041,20456467,2014-09-29,8718389,Wei,"It was a great experience to stay in Seattle! The apartment was clean and comfortable. The location is really convenience to reach everywhere, and located in a very safe residence area. Miranda is really a nice, warm and kind person !!! I'm happy that I made the decision so right : )"
4106041,21795062,2014-10-24,20826708,Ilya,"If I could give six stars, I would! Miranda was a wonderful host - warm, welcoming, responsive, efficient, and respectful of her guests' privacy. The apartment (a junior 1bd) is superbly located, stylishly furnished, very fresh and modern. 

The apartment is top floor (!), with high ceiling. One thing to be aware of is the fact that the apartment faces an office building across the street and hence we kept blinds down during daytime on weekdays. "
4106041,22558482,2014-11-09,14412486,Amy,"Really great location, very walkable. Beautiful place, very nicely set up and perfect for business + mini-vacation in Seattle. Miranda was super helpful and available for any questions."
4106041,24600641,2014-12-31,4521536,Brooke,"Price gouging at it's finest!  So I paid $3300 for a stay for a month for an apartment that rents for $1690 tops because it has furniture, a view of an office building, and horrible water pressure?  

I started doing AirBnB years ago by renting out my room in our cramped NYC apartment because it was a way to offer guests who couldn't afford a hotel room a place they could stay in at a cheap rate while meeting cool people.  Since then I've traveled all over and met some truly amazing people who I hope to visit again.  My stay here was the complete opposite of what AirBnB is all about.  I never met Miranda she sent her friend to give me the key upon arrival.  Apparently she's never actually lived a day in the apartment either since when I called to ask how the shower worked she called maintenance for help.  It was ultimately not the shower, just the terrible the water pressure in the building.  And there's a whole list of instructions on here not to let anyone know you're staying there, probably because when I looked at a unit for rent in the building the leasing agent told me there is no subletting allowed or the tenant can get thrown out.  

Rent here at your own risk, had I had the time to shop around I would have learned most furnished places go for $1600 a month tops.  In fact I'm now renting a great furnished place with parking included in a much nicer building with a view and a gym for $1400.  I chose this rental because it was the closest walking distance to work, only to have Miranda try to price gouge me another $300 when I needed a place just for a few days until mine was ready and wanted to extend the rental.  Needless to say my work put me up instead for those few days and I was happy to get out of this place.  The apartment is nice, but not even remotely close to worth the money.  Learn from my mistake, do your homework and shop around or break up your stay and stay with other AirBnB people who actually live in their homes."
4106041,24698571,2015-01-01,190761,Kristen,"The unit was located in a pleasant neighborhood, very close to downtown and walk-able.  Was a nice secured entry building and the unit was very clean and spacious.   The one bedroom was a junior one bedroom, but fine for two people."
4106041,25566080,2015-01-19,25715534,Ben,"We had a fantastic experience with Miranda and Michael. They were extremely professional and friendly (they even greeted us with a bottle of wine!). The room was exactly as advertised and very clean. They really helped make our trip to Seattle enjoyable with such an easy process. Thank you guys for the hospitality. Overall, great experience! "
4106041,25732064,2015-01-24,3698358,Jessyca,"My stay was absolutely fantastic! The place looked exactly as advertised in the pictures. I was greeted with a warm welcome and wine. There were even chocolates on my bed. Any trouble I had, they were quick to respond! Someone mentioned the water pressure and I would agree it is not the best but honestly it was not an issue. I would stay at this property again in a heart beat. Such a great location to the heart of the city and super close to the convention center. For being a work trip, this location offered ther perfect combo of comfort and convenience. Thank you Michael-- you and Wally were sooo wonderful!! "
4106041,26529955,2015-02-15,13205606,Lorie,"My boyfriend and I arrived in Seattle early so Miranda was nice enough to let us check in early. She couldn't meet with us at the time so she had her friend help us get situated. There was a bottle of wine and chocolates on our bed, which was absolutely sweet. The place was super cute and at the heart of Seattle so everything was really close by. "
4106041,28619835,2015-03-27,27941226,Katrina,"I enjoyed my stay at Eve's & Michael unit a lot. The location is terrific, you can walk to all major attractions and the Convention center. There is a great all organic store 4 blocks away, the coffee downstairs is to wake up for and the rooftop with a grill is a nice addition. I also very much liked the bed - so comfy. Eve was extremely helpful and welcoming. The bottle of wine was a nice welcome too!"
4106041,29924728,2015-04-14,28900513,Brydon,"My stay at this apartment was all I needed and more for a great stay in a Seattle. The location is super close to town and transit to other areas but also quiet. Especially great for me was its proximity to the convention centre should you similarly be attending an event. The apartment is bigger than expected, bed is super comfy, wi-fi is fast plus Eve and Michael have set up some great connections to uber and local grocery delivery. A+ all round."
4106041,30494435,2015-04-23,25770900,Michael,"I came to Seattle for a conference and was looking for a place close to the convention center. The apartment was everything advertised and Eve went above and beyond to make my first Airbnb experience a great one. 

The apartment was just a short walk from the conference center and convenient to shopping and dining establishments. The kitchen was stocked well enough to allow me to cook my meals in.  

Any time I had a question, Eve was very quick to respond.  I let her know of one minor maintenance issue and told her that she could wait to have it corrected because it was not a major deal.  It was fixed within 2 hours while I was out. 

There are many more positives about the apartment, but I will close with this. Any time my wife and I return to Seattle, we will call Eve. "
4106041,31546966,2015-05-06,10665651,Alistair,"I had a really nice stay, the bed was super comfortable, the room was really beautiful, and the apartment is very nice. My host, Eve, was friendly, although I barely saw her while I was doing my own thing! The area is perfect, very close to downtown, nice shops, cafés and some of the best food I've eaten this trip. Easy access to public transit and public parks. What a nice spot! I totally recommend staying here. :)"
4106041,31841074,2015-05-10,32380341,Sarah,Eve had excellent communication before and during our stay. Her place is perfect if you need to be by the invention center. Her responses were almost immediate. 
4106041,32978352,2015-05-24,7716133,Ray,"Awesome Eve's place was right in the center of everything we wanted to see.  We had planned on using Uber to get around however we were so close to all the sights we wanted to visit we just walked.  The apartment was small but nicely laid out and everything was very clean and fresh feeling.  Felt like being at home.  I have a hard time sleeping when I travel and am not sleeping on my own bed.  The bed here fit me like a glove.  Eve is very professional she met us and showed us all we need to know.  Well make sure and ask her about using the shower.  It has a little water saving device which was a little tricky to figure out once I got in the shower.  Once you know what to do the shower is wonderful.  If you rent this place it will help make your trip perfect.
"
4106041,33616386,2015-05-30,20654299,Anna,"Eve was such an amazing host, she was responsive and truly cared about my overall experience.  I look forward to visiting Seattle again soon and getting an Airbnb from Eve."
4106041,34153201,2015-06-05,33678498,Amy,"The listing was very accurate, exactly like the pictures and Eve was great! She made the whole process super easy and was very accommodating to my flight times. The apartment was just like a hotel, very modern and clean. She gave great instructions so you knew exactly what to do for check out and how to leave the house. Next time I'm in Seattle I would totally rent from Eve again! "
4106041,36016273,2015-06-24,28588535,Miranda,Wonderful stay in a lovely spot! Great location to walk to everything. Eve was a kind and conscientious host. Definitely recommended. 
4106041,37270809,2015-07-05,37198525,Damola,"I had an absolutely amazing experience this past weekend staying at Eve & Michael's Airbnb in downtown Seattle!

This was my first time using Airbnb and thanks to these two it will not be my last! The apartment was completely decked out and furnished by someone with great taste! I particularly enjoyed the art work in the apartment and the choices made in furniture selection that gave it a very uptown and modern feel!

Eve was extremely accommodating and made our stay a true pleasure. She suggested great sites to see and fun places to visit for a great night life. She even bought us a bottle of wine!

Hand's down Eve & Michael made my Airbnb experience and my trip to Seattle was no doubt enhanced as a result. I will be sure to look them up the next time I am in town!"

Breakfast was cooked to order- excellent food!  Barbara, the host, is friendly and knows Seattle well.    I have stayed at several B&B's in the Seattle area.  Casa de Esperanza is  a great  find.   Will definitely return."
826436,3732404,2013-03-09,4186929,Vitya,"We spent three nights in Art Deco BnB on our last visit in Seattle.  Great location in a quiet part of Seattle, short walk from the Light Rail station. Cozy home with a lot of character and a pleasant and caring host  Barbara. We would recommend (website hidden). Breakfast was delicious."
826436,3856084,2013-03-21,4016410,Danielle,"This was truly a wonderful experience. Barbara was a delightful host and fun to chat with, but also understanding if you prefer to be alone. The room was clean and the bed was really comfortable. Breakfast was always tasty and Barbara was more than willing to accommodate any food allergies. The location is perfect, close to water and also very convenient if you don't have a car (it is pretty close to the Light Rail). I would definitely stay here again!"
826436,4026307,2013-04-03,3179798,Cristina,"I had a very comfortable stay at Barbara's Bed and Breakfast!  Spent almost a week there while I searched for more permanent housing in the area.  The breakfasts were delicious and varied, and she is quite accommodating of food allergies and preferences.  I enjoyed the Mexican shower and the Art Deco decor.  Barbara is a kind, thoughtful host, and a delight to chat with.  Definately recommended!  :)"
826436,4312267,2013-04-27,4270633,Mike,Barbara is a great host.  She was very friendly and cooked a delicious breakfast every morning.  The house was clean and interesting with a lot of art everywhere.  I'd stay with her again if possible.
826436,4438460,2013-05-05,6060876,Julia,"I had a wonderful time at Barbara's bed and breakfast. 
The Helen Keller room is a lovely room with a very comfortable bed and Barbara’s cooked breakfasts are delicious.
Barbara is a wonderful host. She is happy to provide you with everything you need. She gave me the best recommendations to explore Seattle and I loved our inspiring conversations. Thank you Barbara for a true home far away.
"
826436,4650061,2013-05-18,5945204,Susan,"Barbara was very warm and friendly. The bed was comfortable. Barbara made very tasty breakfast with varieties. I stayed a week in her house and had several breakfast with her. She has lots of interesting story and photo to share on the breakfast room table. Her garden grows beautiful flowers. She decorated the breakfast table with fresh flowers. I enjoyed the stay in her house and a few nice conversations with Barbara.

非常好。很好吃的早餐 
"
826436,4683251,2013-05-20,5992699,Marian,"Staying at Barbara's B&B was a highlight of our weekend in Seattle - because meeting Barbara was a joy.  She is a delightful host who will entertain you, feed you wonderful meals and be available for whatever you need.  For me, B&B's are about meeting the people who run them, having a comfy bed and being able to use them as a base to get around.  This experience was marvellous in all those ways! "
826436,4821507,2013-05-27,6495399,Ilya,"Nice quiet neighborhood, lots of parking.  Room was clean.  Shower is on the same floor and I was not sharing it during my stay, but I believe that was because Barbara was out of town.  "
826436,5080808,2013-06-11,4723047,Jody,"Barbara is an amazing hostess! My husband and I stayed with her for part of our honeymoon and our trip was greatly sweetened by Barbara's delicious cooking and detailed knowledge of the area. She gave us wonderful tips on how to get around Seattle, where to eat, what parts of Olympic National Forest and Mt. Rainier to see. But aside from those helpful things, she was a delight to be around! Oh, and her cooking is amazing! The first morning she made us an egg mcmuffin sort of thing with fresh guacamole. The next day she prepared a broccoli and mushroom quiche. Another day was breakfast tacos with fresh, homemade home fries. And she offered to send some of the rhubarb pie and bread that she made from scratch with us for our adventures. If you have an opportunity to stay at her BnB, definitely take it! You won't regret it!"
826436,5188073,2013-06-17,1419984,Beth,"Barbara is a wonderful woman - attentive host on top of great conversation and intriguing life experiences to inspire, adding to my already exciting trip to this great city. I would absolutely stay again, and recommend Barbara (and her wonderful breakfasts!) to anyone in the area. "
826436,5318642,2013-06-24,6486899,Dwayne,When in Seattle the best place to stay is with Barbara. The homemade breakfasts were very tasty and got us off to a good start. Barbara goes out of her way to make sure you are comfortable and all your needs are satisfied. The price for our room was among the best in the city and when you throw in the breakfast you wonder how you got such a great deal. Seattle is an expensive city to visit and Barbara makes it affordable for anyone to enjoy. My wife and I will return to Seattle in the future and our first choice would be to stay with Barbara. I will add this was my first airbnb experience and I am hooked. No more overpriced hotels for me. 
826436,5790614,2013-07-16,6965769,Keith,"We were made to feel very much at home in a warm, friendly atmosphere. Comfortable beds and generous breakfasts. Barbara was a great hostess.
"
826436,6013803,2013-07-26,7347323,Miyuki,"Barbara's B&B is a perfect place for those who look for a simple yet comfortable accommodation. It is conveniently located in a quiet neighborhood just about 5 minute walk from Mt. Baker Light Rail station. Just hop on the Light Rail and in 10 to 15 minutes, you are in downtown Seattle. Don't forget to visit Lake Washington which is about 10 minutes on foot from her place. The Vietnamese restaurant called BEN THANH near Mt. Baker station was decent. Columbia City has more choices of restaurants including Senegalese, Thai, Japanese, etc. 
Barbara is an intelligent woman with a big heart. She did everything to make my stay comfortable and memorable. She graciously let me leave my luggage at her place for the entire day after I checked out as my flight did not leave until late that night. When I left her B&B for the airport, she walked with me to Mr .Baker Station. What a kind hostess she is!
I enjoyed our conversation over her homemade quiche and fair trade coffee for breakfast. Thank you, Barbara. 
"
826436,6068013,2013-07-29,6118509,Sascha,"Barbara goes out of her way to make you enjoy your stay at Caza the Ezparanza. When my friend Nanna and I stayed she tried to make a traditional Danish treat, which we really enjoyed and appreciated. Overall Barbara is an absolutely loving women and a wonderful host."
826436,6166405,2013-08-01,3885079,Susann,Barbara is a very gracious host. She serves delicious breakfast daily which is a huge plus. Her place is close to the Link light rail station and it`s a short walk to Lake Washington. The room is lovely and the bed very comfortable.
826436,6469855,2013-08-13,2283710,Carmela,Lovely home and Barbara is a great host.  She helped us with all of our questions of how to get around and find things.  The room is set up a little differently than the pictures as well as the breakfast.  The room is great with where the bed is located (in front of a window in the east for great morning sun.)  The breakfast was yummy and Barbara made sure she met our request for wonderfully strong coffee in the morning (and plenty of it!)  I would recommend staying with Barbara and hope our travels bring us to her neck of the woods again.
826436,6561604,2013-08-17,7192870,WahChin,"Barbara is a cheerful & positive & humorous ,, nice  lady.
Her room very clean ...she made very nice & delicious breakfast 
Unfortunately , this is the first & last during our stay ...the subsequent days she had a ad-hoc request to Canada to help a friend , & we unable to spend more time with her...."
826436,6762582,2013-08-24,7726809,Jim,Barbara is a gracious host nice older home very close to Lake Washington and close to the Rail station
826436,12931857,2014-05-14,14866019,Joshua,"First time using AirBnB and I'm sold now because of Barbara!  I could not have asked for a better stay than at Casa de Esperanza.  Perfect for couples, singles, art lovers, or those seeking close access to downtown.   I stayed here for two weeks and was blown away by the kind service and delicious, homemade breakfasts.  She is truly a delightful host and I would recommend her to any family or friends on their way to the Seattle area."
826436,14121840,2014-06-12,14303914,Martin,"Barbara is a great host, accommodating and friendly, witty and intelligent. She made my stay really enjoyable, her house is comfortable and fascinating and the breakfasts excellent with delicious fresh eggs every morning from her chickens. The location, being so handy for the Light rail station, is perfect, with easy and rapid access to the airport and the city, with the added attraction of interesting local walks. Barbara is a great conversationalist  and made me feel right at home, we parted as good friends. When I return to Seattle I'll definitely stay again."
826436,14416032,2014-06-18,9701922,Jeff,"I had noticed Barbara's many positive reviews before booking my stay, so I was already expecting that my host would be a friendly, generous and interesting person.  She was all of this and more.  What a fascinating woman! If my schedule has not already been so full, I would have enjoyed talking about a multitude of subjects with Barbara for hours.  

She was very generous with her time and even walked me the several blocks to the location of my meeting. And her breakfasts are exceptional! What more could one ask for?"
826436,14734356,2014-06-25,5870493,Kris,"This is a very comfortable lodging convenient to light rail service, in a lovely home. The most unique features are Barbara's wonderful hospitality and her delicious and healthy breakfasts. Barbara is a warm generous person who goes out of her way. She cooks using organic and local ingredients including eggs straight from the chickens. We will go back when we visit again. 
"
826436,15106347,2014-07-02,16282634,Nicholas,"Barbara is one heck of a host! I had never used Airbnb before this, but the room and the comforts of her home were above and beyond my expectations, and her casual charm put me at ease the minute we said hello. Plus, she cooks like a champ. I sincerely wish I had spent more time hanging out and talking with this fascinating lady. If you ever want to visit Seattle, I highly recommend planning a stay with Barbara."
826436,15561150,2014-07-11,17730785,Ann,We had a great time. Barbara is a wonderful hostess and we felt very welcome in her beautiful home. 
826436,16420297,2014-07-27,10322189,Karen,"Barbara was a caring, attentive host.  She helped us figure out public transport options, helped us decide on must-see sights, gave her honest opinion on different tourist attractions, and all the while making us feel right at home in her sweet home.  A delicious breakfast awaited us each morning.  The neighborhood was simple and quiet.  We stayed in the second-floor bedroom which was lovely and very quiet with lovely light in the morning.  The accommodations are simple and homey -- just what we wanted for our trip.  "
826436,16660653,2014-07-31,4673537,Esther,"Barbara was very welcoming, flexible and accommodating; Delicious cook with great variety over the three days I was at Barbara's home. Charming suburb and I often came home late at night, so the close-by Light Rail was terrific."
826436,17105615,2014-08-07,17443070,Ben,"Barbara is such a lovely lady! She was so kind and generous to me during my stay. Her breakfasts were always great and her company and conversation were fantastic too.

Her place is right near the light rail station which takes you right into the heart of downtown Seattle. She has a lovely large home in a safe neighborhood. The bed and room were clean and cosy.

Thanks Barbara for making my stay in Seattle great!"
826436,17629541,2014-08-15,15483174,Yuan,"I stayed Barbara's home for seven days. It's a really nice and sweet house. I stayed there just like I stayed in my home. The house is near the light rail, you can use 10 minutes walk to there. She also made delicious breakfast for us, most of food were organic. Barbara is a really nice lady and I am glad to meet her. I spent wonderful time in her house."
826436,17962016,2014-08-19,18804060,Alix,"Barbara lives in a very nice old art deco style house with a a countryside inspired garden. The house is nicely located in a residential neighbourhood. It is easily accessible by public transport (light rail).

Although the room itself was fine as seen in the pictures, our experience in Barbara's house did not completely meet the expectations triggered by the extremely positive comments of other users and by Barbara's ad. Maybe we came at a inconvenient point of time for her, but the common spaces of the house (hallway and living room) appeared to be rather chaotic with a lot of boxes stored in the rooms, things lying around in an un-organized way. Actually what made me decide for the house was the picture Barbara gives of her house on her page such as the common spaces and the nice breakfast table. Unfortunately, this is not really what we got. When we were there it was rather unappealing to hang out in the common spaces (although it got better after we said something).

Finally, although I was aware that the bathroom was shared, I found the bathroom rather unfit (especially the shower) for being shared with strangers.

All in all, our experience was not what we expected, but we admit that we might be just a little bit disappointed of the place."
826436,18710619,2014-08-31,14904902,Jennifer,"I stayed with Barbara for a few weeks while I moved to Seattle and it was an absolutely wonderful experience. Barbara was incredibly welcoming and had a lot of advice about the area, making my move smooth far smoother than I could have imagined. She is also a fantastic cook and just in general a friendly and warm person. I would recommend anyone stay with Barbara, whether it be for 4 days or 4 weeks. You won't regret it."
826436,23802046,2014-12-10,10372721,Matthew,Barbara was a great host. I arrived on short notice and she was totally flexible and cool. Her home is awesome and really gives you a great sense of community. The room was great and the desk was very practical. Parking is very easy to find as well which is very convenient. One of the coolest aspects of Barbara is wow informed she is of international cultures. Had great conversations and learned several things from her. She also gave breakfast in the mornings or whenever you decided to eat breakfast. She runs an art gallery which was very cool and fun to see in person.  I would definitely consider going back again. 
826436,37845089,2015-07-11,20935492,Danzhu,"I arrived on July 4th and Barbara went out for the holiday weekend, so she asked her friend to take care of me. Everyone I met there is really nice.
The room is on second floor. Its layout/decorations had changed a bit. It looks smaller than that on the pictures, but as I went there alone with a 28-inch luggage and a backpack, the room had enough room for me to lay down the opened luggage.
It took me 10-15 mins to walk to the light rail station. The Lake Washington is not far away. It's great to walk around the lake. I stayed in the house during a hooooot week. The house is lovely. Amazingly, it has no air conditioner, but the living room was cool with breeze even when it was hot outside.
Barbara made good breakfast. I had smoothie (yummy), fresh fruits picked directly from her yard, toast, omelet.
I had a good time. Will live here again if I go to Seattle next time:)"
826436,39212542,2015-07-21,37494582,N. Leila,This artsy home is a close walk to the light rail and Lake Washington in a quiet and safe neighborhood. We felt very welcome. Barbara does the breakfast as there is no kitchen access. She is a lovely hostess.
826436,41977783,2015-08-10,29035934,Alex,"Barbara was a gracious and welcoming host and her home was lovely. Absolutely comes as advertised, my 11 day stay with her was wonderful"
826436,42946701,2015-08-16,17343206,Rena,"Barbara is an amazing person. She is very caring. She also serves great breakfast. I loved the daily coffee, organic pancakes, poached eggs and toast. She also prepares a sauce to go with breakfast from fruis and berries in her garden. The fruit that she served in the morning was also amazing. She provided great suggestions regarding transportation and what to see/do in Seattle. "
826436,46009480,2015-09-07,188233,Jason,She welcomed us into her beautiful house and ran her AirBnB more like a real bed and breakfast. She cooked us breakfast and brewed coffee in the morning. Such a great host!
826436,47791133,2015-09-21,77409,Elena,"Barbara is very good at sharing necessary information with her guests on how to get from her house to downtown Seattle, even to providing an Orca card for use on the light rail and bus. I enjoyed hearing about Barbara's work and the artists she represents in her gallery.  Her breakfasts are terrific: quiche, fresh fruits or smoothies, zucchini bread, etc. Also you can come in and make tea whenever you want.   I did find that the bedroom was smaller than it looked in the photo, and the furniture has been rearranged, so the rooms look different. There was no longer a mirror in the bedroom, which meant spending more time in the shared bathroom. 

Note to future visitors: If you take the Link to her place, just come out of the station, avoid that circuitous walkway if you have luggage, and just walk across and up the street.  If you have heavy bags, taking a cab or Uber would be better the first time because there is a hill up to her street. Much easier to walk down when you're departing.  The walk to the bus #14 is through a lovely neighborhood and there's a beautiful lake and park right there by the bus stop which is worth walking in."
826436,48434414,2015-09-26,22419223,Stacyann,"The space was pretty much as advertised.  The light link rail stop is a short walk, albeit with a bit of a hill and an overpass that you will not enjoy lugging your luggage over, which made it convenient.  The bathroom does not lock, but we did not have any issue in that area (not sure if any other guests were there though).  The breakfast was very tasty and Barbara was very helpful with spots to check out in town and informative about Seattle and the neighborhood.  If you don't mind a quirky house with a little character, this space is a good spot just outside the city proper."
7026898,36644697,2015-06-29,3879417,Todd,"Robin and her husband were the perfect hosts. They provided coffee, breakfast, tips around town, and the place felt like I had my very own lovely apartment with a spectacular garden. There is a park 20ft away and it's close enough to everything you might want to do in Seattle."
7026898,37245959,2015-07-05,33561291,Ines,"It was our first time in Seattle and we expected the accomodation to be a rather noisy place due to the location being so close to downtown. But we were surprised how quiet and nice the area is where Robin and Dave live. The room is in the basement, with an seperate entrance through the yard. It was a very clean and spacious room with a comfortable bed and coffee & tea making facilities and a nice and new bathroom. We were allowed to use the family's washing machine and tumble dryer which is very convenient especially during a longer trip. While we were there, the weather was very hot, but the room was pleasently cool and we could even use the yard for having breakfast and dinner. Robin and Dave were very friendly, helpful and welcoming and we enjoyed the time we spent at their place very much. If you're looking for an accomodation which is clean, comfortable and quiet with privacy but yet not more than a 15 minutes drive from downtown, this is your place to stay!"
7026898,38187871,2015-07-13,29892360,Yihao,"We enjoyed our stay at Robin's house! It's located at a nice quiet neighborhood and very easy access to groceries. The garden view is fantastic, it's beautiful to see the how the greens mix with the blue sky. Robin is very helpful and nice to talk to, this is another unforgettable airbnb experience! :)"
7026898,38659848,2015-07-17,26995012,Lindsay,"Robin and Dave's rental is the PERFECT place for a Seattle getaway and true to the description in the post. Only about a 15 minute drive into the city , or a quick bus ride, it provides all the conveniences without having to be in all the hustle and bustle. 
Robin and Dave  are very warm and welcoming and even came by with a yummy cucumber salad from their garden and dropped off local chocolate as a gift for our anniversary.
We definitely recommend renting their  beautiful home and are looking forward to visiting again! "
7026898,40287455,2015-07-29,39465485,John,Robin contacted me immediately and provided all necessary information.  Very helpful.
7026898,40641387,2015-08-01,36480452,Tia,"We felt very well taken care of during our stay. There was coffee, tea, and granola bars. The house was in a quiet neighborhood and it was nice to be able to relax from our busy schedule. We did not have a car when we arrived and the bus stop was about half a mile away. It was definitely a manageable walk, but just be prepared for it. The garden in the backyard was absolutely beautiful. Overall a very positive experience and I hope our future Airbnb stays are just as comfortable! "
7026898,44312555,2015-08-25,35607120,Mary Ellen,"Robin was a good communicator and let us know clearly when she would be around to answer any questions.  She graciously permitted us to split out stay into two portions--disappearing to the San Juan Islands for three days in the middle of the week.  (Highly recommend the San Juans, by the way!)  Robin was friendly without being intrusive and gave us good advice about where to eat, shop for groceries, and take yoga class!  The private entrance and the garden view were real plusses!  The garden is outfitted with artwork created by Robin and her husband as well as lovely plantings.  We had brief troubles with the internet due to high winds and Robin's husband fixed it promptly.  The neighborhood is a quiet, safe, average neighborhood within 15 minutes drive of Seattle Center with very easy access to I-5 (the main thruway).  Robin lives on a dead end and we were able to conveniently park in a driveway across the street.  The rooms look exactly as they appear in the photos and I have no complaints at all.  The bed and chair were comfortable and we were happy to have access to laundry facilities.  The only thing I could have wished for was a magnifying mirror on the other side of the mirror on the table, but that is a small personal need--I can no longer apply eye makeup without magnification!  We would definitely stay there again.  "
7026898,45798329,2015-09-06,11248518,Gillian,"Robin has been nothing short of a gracious host during my family's stay at her place. She was very efficient and prompt in keeping up with us to ensure that we will have no trouble getting into the apartment at all. We checked in pretty late on the first day and she was extremely nice to wait to show us around.

Robin's apartment is honestly lovelier on person. The large windows open out to a wonderful view of her well kept garden. Large comfortable beds, plush towels, and a variety of amenities made our stay very comfortable. 

It was my family's first experience with an airbnb accomodation and they are converts. We definitely would recommend Robin's place to anyone who visits Seattle."
7026898,46750060,2015-09-13,41011255,Natalie,Robin was a great hostess! She made us feel very welcome. She was excellent about communicating when we booked and throughout our stay. Detail-oriented. We loved the neighborhood. Everything in listing was exactly as described. Highly recommend!
7026898,47226545,2015-09-16,27449210,Alger,"I booked Robin's room for my family.
The room is literally like she described, even better.
My family are very satisfied with the comfortable, specious, and cozy room.
It might be one of the excellent B&Bs I have ever seen.
Thank you, Robin and Dave."
7026898,47789475,2015-09-21,18831238,Diana,"Robin was an amazing host! We had just driven 15 hours and didn't arrive until 9pm but she was there to greet us and show us around. The room is beautiful and stocked with all the amenities! Everything was clean and comfortable. 
I had originally extended the our stay an extra day but due to unexpected circumstances I needed to change it back and Robin was nothing but accommodating and understanding. 
The room also has a lovely view! "
7026898,49347432,2015-10-03,42692722,Paul,Everything was set up nicely when we arrived.  Our plans drastically changed and Robin was very accommodating to additional days.  Parking on 27th Av is an interesting experience not advised during snow or ice.
7026898,49863361,2015-10-06,8290041,Melinda,"Robin and Dave were accommodating hosts who provided us with materials about how to get about in Seattle.  The highway exit to their neighborhood from I-5 is easy to find. Their neighborhood is a spacious, quiet one, northeast of Roosevelt Way and thus an easy drive into downtown.  In addition to being spacious, it's also homey and in early October we were greeted by reddish leaves among the greenery.  Robin's and Dave's garden is a joy to behold. "
7026898,50356863,2015-10-11,20034161,Nhi,"We had a wonderful experience at Robin's place! It was only 16 mins drive from Downtown Seattle, but the air and the atmosphere is totally different - thanks to the garden view. Room was clean, bed was comfy, bathroom was spacious enough, and Robin was very responsive whenever we needed. We would definitely come back."
7026898,56945964,2015-12-20,933998,Jack,"We had a truly exceptional stay.  Robin and Dave are utterly thoughtful hosts.  The guest quarters are quiet, private (separate entrance), well appointed (comfortable bed!), and altogether pleasant.  Robin was there to greet us, checked in to make sure our stay was going well and to ask if we needed anything.  

The location was perfect for our needs.  We're walkers, and we spent plenty of time wandering around NE Seattle on foot.  The house is only 2 miles north of UW, which made it easy to catch a concert on Saturday evening.  In fact, this would be a great stay for anyone spending time on campus.  We hope to come back soon!

One more thing:  we had the pleasure of enjoying Dave's acoustic guitar during the afternoon.  A fine complement to a wonderful visit!"
7026898,58676761,2016-01-03,29294625,Matt,"Upon arriving, Robin met me and provided a thorough tour of her place. The private room is immaculate and use of the washer/dryer was convenient during the stay.  The location is quiet and is located in a nice Seattle neighborhood. Access to all of the city was easy. Robin is a warm host and I'd stay at her place again."
1386306,6262358,2013-08-05,2972262,Sean,"Lisa and our hostess Mary were delightful. Mary's home was perfect for our visit, while Lisa met us with the key to show us around. Later that evening we enjoyed sharing wine while engaging in a fun conversation with them. We will definitely plan to return when next we visit Seattle, and give Lisa and Mary's Garden Room our highest recommendation. "
1386306,6385437,2013-08-10,8018166,Nephi,i had a lot of fun staying at the garden room. lisa made me feel very comfortable. i would most definitely stay there again.  
1386306,6739967,2013-08-23,2266170,Mark,"We stayed with Mary our host while our daughter and we went through freshman orientation at UW.  Originally, our stay was for my wife and I, but I learned we had somehow failed to sign-up our daughter for on campus housing for her orientation, so she ended up staying with us in our room on a blow-up mattress we brought.  We originally paid for three nights, but both my wife and daughter needed to get home right after orientation, so we planned for two nights only.  I contacted Lisa about all of this, and she was very accommodating. 
The house was very well situated to campus, dining, shopping, etc... The house itself was charming and very clean, everything was ready for our arrival.  The night we met Mary after our arrival we discussed times for all of us showering in the morning.  Mary was up and ready before us, so the single bathroom was ours alone.  
After the first night we found the bedroom and bath cramped for the three of us, this is best an accommodation for a couple or less. We opted for other accommodations the second night as a result.  My wife and I look forward to staying on visits with our daughter in the future. 
I gave it four stars only because of our personal situation. Overall, the location, easy access to campus, dining, shopping, etc.., ease of parking, cleanliness and charming aspect of the house, positive responsiveness and accommodation of both Lisa and Mary, my evaluation warrants five stars.  If you're looking for a very clean and nice place to stay close to campus and the Children's hospital, this fits the bill nicely.   I highly recommend it."
1386306,6901603,2013-08-29,8098943,Nazli,"this is a wonderful clean room in a nice place near Washington university. there is no other guest in the house and it means you just share a lovely house with one other lovely lady who lives there, but she is a busy woman that most of the day is out. She is so friendly and kind. much more than you can imagine. I totally recommend this place to everybody."
1386306,6976854,2013-09-01,8337784,Ken,"The place was very hospitable. During our two-night stay Mary was friendly and gave us useful information about her nice and peaceful neighborhood. We especially liked the bath room, which was spacious and clean. As a first-time airbnb user, we were very happy with our choice of stay.
"
1386306,7268548,2013-09-13,2653543,Ann,The house was perfect for my needs. Clean and quiet with a well equipped kitchen. Mary was a gracious host. And in a great neighbourhood with an outdoor mall within walking distance. I will gladly book again when visiting Seattle. 
1386306,9027013,2013-12-02,9692569,Stacy,"Lisa was easy to communicate with during the reservation process and quick to respond to questions. Mary was very kind and accommodating, the house was clean, the bed was super comfortable, and I felt safe walking my dogs in the neighborhood. If you stay in the Garden Room, ask Mary if her grandson will be staying over and bring earplugs unless you enjoy the chatter of a 2-year-old.  "
1386306,9205541,2013-12-13,4076370,Sri,"This place is very close to Seattle Children's and I had a wonderful stay.  Mary was a great hostess. It was very quite and comfortable. 
I really enjoyed my stay and highly recommend it! "
1386306,9302466,2013-12-19,10251633,Natalie,Super welcoming and warm hosts. Bed was super comfortable and the room was cute and clean. Highly recommended!
1386306,10116064,2014-02-01,10664050,Jessica,"This room is perfect location for those working at the hospital or nearby UW. Mary is a wonderful house mate and genuinely cares about your stay. Case in point, I had to leave early because of a family emergency and she generously offered to not only drive me to the airport on short notice, but also mail me my things I left behind in my hurry. The home is clean and cozy,  but be sure to bring layers if you are not used to the Seattle ""moist"" cold. Everything about this room is wonderful and the welcoming company is priceless ! "
1386306,11039879,2014-03-17,13059244,Gia,Lisa was very prompt in responding to my last minute request to stay at the Garden Room. She sent me a bunch of maps and directions and when I nevertheless got lost she drove and picked me up. I stayed with Mary (the garden room is in her house) for three days and she was a very friendly and helpful host. The room was clean and the bed was incredibly comfortable. Lisa and Mary invited me to enjoy hor d'ouvres and wine one evening with their friends and everyone was very welcoming. It was so useful to be able to rent Mary's bike as well since I could easily tour the neighborhoods without worrying about figuring out public transit. Thanks again for a great visit ladies!
1386306,11315719,2014-03-29,10933528,Mary,Accommodating hostess - luxurious bed - everything comfy & clean. Straight shot to UW.  Definitely will be using these accommodations again!
1386306,11371133,2014-03-31,11521295,Marlene,"The Garden Room is comfortably furnished, and located in a nice quiet neighborhood. Mary was a very welcoming hostess and helpful with providing information about local transit and things to do in Seattle."
1386306,11522006,2014-04-06,13549028,Hye Won,"Hostess: 
- Lisa was very prompt with her responses, and the checkin/checkout procedures were simple. She emailed detailed instructions about how to get around near Seattle. 
- Mary was the hostess staying in the house. She was friendly, kind, and helped me to feel at home during my stay. She respected my wanting to just rest (enjoy alone time) during my break from work. 

About the place: 
- Kitchen: Mary allowed me to use the kitchen freely. I used the toaster oven, electric kettle, refrigerator, and stovetop for a few quick meals. 
- Internet: I was not able to get a stable connection, even though Mary tried moving the router to a more open space to help with better connection 
- Room: Comfortable bed, 
- Bathroom: Shared bathroom. Towels provided in my room.
- House: right next to Gilman trail. (The walk to UW campus was 25 to 30 mins) Very close to U-Village. Street Parking available.

Other:
- Mary's grandson stays over on Tuesday nights. That night I woke up in the middle of the night because he was crying (maybe due to helicopter noise from the hospital?). But since I didn't need to wake up early in the morning, it didn't bother me much. 
- It was really cold one night, so I turned on the heat. But a few hours later I noticed the heat was switched off. Instead of turning on the heat again (since Mary might've been hot with the heater on) I just slept with my hoodie on. (I think I felt cold more because I'm used to Cali weather.)  
- Since I was sharing the space in Mary's home, I was obviously very careful not to make noise after 10pm. 

Overall:
I got my much needed rest while staying here. I haven't visited UW campus for nearly 5 years after graduation/moving to CA, so I was very happy to be able to stay near campus and just relax. Thanks to Lisa & Mary for being a kind host!"
1386306,11701633,2014-04-12,1532751,Ano,cozy. easy logistics. close to UW Children's hospital. thanks for a great stay!
1386306,12753999,2014-05-10,9139514,Inger,"I arranged housing for one of a group doing a residency at UW, so can't personally comment on this stay. However, I received no complaints from her, and heard secondhand that it was lovely."
1386306,13169780,2014-05-20,2287355,Jackie,"Lisa facilitated the room booking by being very responsive requests and by providing lots of information. Mary is the host, and she is a really lovely person--good natured, kind, unobtrusive--I felt right at home. I met her little grandson, who stayed one night of my two-night stay, and that was no issue at all for me. The house is small, but not too small. A tall person or someone used to large spaces may find it a bit close. The room is exactly as pictured and the bed is very comfortable. The internet signal is quite weak in the bedroom, but is good in the living room and just outside the front (website hidden) location: I was using public transportation and Lisa gives the buses to take. Follow the directions! The house is almost just across the road from the stop. It takes two buses to get to downtown but they come frequently, no problem there, and once you get oriented you see that there are more options for buses. It is also about 3 minutes' walk from an upscale grocery store--great food, if a little expensive--and just a few steps to the bike path. I attended a seminar at the Talaris center, and Mary's house is about a 5 minute walk from there. So for me it was all excellent: wonderful host; nice comfortable, clean and tidy home; great location."
1386306,14277661,2014-06-16,14456105,Aakash,We had a warm and cosy stay at the apartment. We surely stay at Lisa's if we ever visit Seattle again :) 
1386306,14631346,2014-06-23,14456105,Aakash,Lisa is a fabulous host. The place was exactly what it looks like on the website. Very neat and clean room. The neighborhood was very peaceful with ample parking.    
1386306,15036664,2014-07-01,13887051,Adam Bradley,"Lisa and Mary were great hosts. They were there for anything I needed, yet giving me privacy and space. The room was very adequate, and the whole house was really nice. Great Location - right beside the Burke Gilman trail, right beside Seattle Children's hospital, and just a few minutes from University Village. Very satisfied - I plan to come back when in Seattle. "
1386306,15736418,2014-07-14,5900896,Allison,"Lisa was very kind, helpful, and personable in facilitating the garden room booking. I enjoyed communicated with her via email, but did not have an opportunity to meet her during our stay. She provided me with lots of information about the area, checking in procedures, maps, and personal recommendations. I really appreciated the open communication and fast response for a pretty last minute trip. I feel super lucky to have found this room available on short notice, in an excellent location in the city, really close to where we wanted to be, lots of interesting things for us to do very near by, and very reasonably priced. Mary is the host in this house, and she is very kind and helpful, but not at all obtrusive. She made it clear that we were very free to come and go as we pleased, and treat it as our home. It was very nice to be able to stay in the room or leave whenever we wanted, and we had absolutely no issues with our dog staying with us. It was quite hot in Seattle during our stay (90) so it was very warm in the house throughout the day. Most residences in the area do not have air conditioning, but after it cooled off at night it was just fine with the fan on us. We had the fan going at all times, so heard no other noise. We also met Mary's grandson (funny little guy!) but did not hear anything during the night, and it was not a bother whatsoever. It is a small home, but the room had enough space for 2 of us with 1 dog for one night. The room itself is a nice size for a smaller home. It was great that the bathroom is right next to the bedroom door. It has a nice vanity area, but is overall quite long and thin. I was able to store a few things in the fridge, and had some tea and rice milk in the morning from the kitchen. The outside area was nicely kept for a small space and it was a beautiful morning. I LOVED the Burke-Gilman trail right next to the house, and we used it a couple times to explore the area, go to a near-by Metropolitan Market for (expensive) produce, see University Village, and go to a vegan bakery. Great place for walking with a lot of cyclists and runners. Excellent location. There was one instance where we had to park the car a little farther down the road as all the other spaces were taken, but could otherwise park right near the house (no cost). We ended up not really staying in the room long enough to be overly interested in the available WiFi, but I wasn't easily able to access the network on my phone. We didn't bother Mary about it, but I'm sure it could have been figured out. It might be a bit of a weak signal, though...."
1386306,15982022,2014-07-19,17839504,Frank,"There wasn't one moment I felt uncomfortable. They were very welcoming and the house was clean and charming. I will definitely be coming back and recommending it to all of my friends. The neighborhood has everything you need without having to enter Seattle traffic. 

The backyard is very private and you're welcome to read a book while waiting for your significant other to wrap up their shower. Speaking of the shower, it has amazing water pressure. Since I was suffering some back problems it was such a relief. Opposite of my shower in Paris.

Places like these will make me an Airbnb addict. "
1386306,16923936,2014-08-04,14432328,Maria Born,"It was very lovely staying at Lisa's. The room and the house was very nice and cosy. We also met the houseguest Mary. She was very sweet.
Just be aware of that the public transportation to the place is a bit inconvenient. You have to change buses several times from downtown and to other areas and sometimes you have to wait quite a bit. You can benefit from downloading the app ""one bus away"" which can make it a lot easier :-)"
1386306,17208117,2014-08-09,16393885,Kateri,"The location turned to be excellent as to my week-long seminar.  Mary was helpful when approached.  I do think such things as availability to hair dryer, iron, washer and dryer should be discussed on arrival.  Leaving the front door light on even though it is still daylight acknowledges that the renter is expected at whatever time they ultimately arrive.

Thanks Lisa and Mary.

Kateri"
1386306,17633360,2014-08-15,1915167,Elizabeth,"This was a comfortable, convenient, safe base for us to explore Seattle. We appreciated being able to have our dog with us, who adored the backyard! Our host, Mary, was kind and attentive."
1386306,17775517,2014-08-17,18404399,Colleen,"This is the second time I've had the privilege of staying with Mary (via Lisa) in her lovely home. First with my boyfriend and my dog and second with my 8 year old daughter. Both experiences were WONDERFUL! There was clear communication and they were both so kind and incredibly helpful. For example, my boyfriend's back seized up the first trip and they found a great chiropractor close by and searched high and low for a heating pad for him! 

Mary's home is delightful. Clean and sweet and comfortable. It is situated in a great neighborhood and still quite close to all things fun in Seattle. We had no problem finding good food and puppy and kid parks close by.

I've been here twice and wouldn't hesitate to stay again on our next adventure there."
1386306,18214506,2014-08-23,7023125,Moleca,"Lisa responded fairly quickly to our last minute AirBNB request - we submitted it on Sunday night, received a response on Monday, and were flying out to Seattle on Tuesday. Her emailed instructions on public transportation to the house were helpful as well; there is a bus stop right by the house and the grocery store is a 5 minute walk away. We met Mary at the Garden Room briefly and did not see her much throughout our stay, but she was always warm and welcoming. The house is well kept and very comfortable (there were 2 of us), and we overall really enjoyed our 3 day stay there. "
1386306,18292674,2014-08-24,17287241,Carlotta,"Lisa greeted us with a warm welcome, it was a good host very helpful to our requests. The room is very comfortable and clean. Advice to other travelers to go there!
"
1386306,18629518,2014-08-29,18144125,Joe,"First off, it is difficult to find a reasonably priced place that will allow pets, let alone both a dog and a cat. It is near impossible to find a place that allows a dog and a cat and is within a neighborhood as walk-able as U-district. As stressful as this experience could have been, Mary (our host) was beyond inviting and made things as simple and comfortable as possible. We really enjoyed our stay and would highly recommend staying here."
1386306,18670092,2014-08-30,19299564,Windy,"We had a wonderful experience staying in the Garden room! The home was beautiful, comfortable, & inviting, close to everything, & Lisa & Mary wer both very helpful! Mary went out of her way to help us after a long day/week of traveling. Highly recommend! "
1386306,18962363,2014-09-03,20237408,千玲,"I stayed at Mary's house for three nights. It's a sweet house. Everything is clean and tidy and Mary is a good host that take care of my needs but gave me private space ,too. It was really a nice experience of my first time to use airbnb!"
1386306,19868032,2014-09-20,15941693,Bibiana,"I really enjoyed to spend a time at Lisa's place. Who lives there is Mary, a wonderful and kind person, who make me feel confortable during my time is Seattle. It is a cozy and clean restroom, really close to the Seattle Childrens's Hospital. I believe it is a great option for people who, like me, was planning to work or study for a period in that hospital. Thank you Mary for everything!"
1386306,21105070,2014-10-11,5797832,Sapana,The room was cute and cozy. I was there for a conference at UW and it was very centrally located for this purpose. The host was welcoming but I also felt I had my privacy which was perfect. I would definitely recommend this place. 
1386306,23240413,2014-11-26,21264340,Joan,"The location was so convenient for us as our daughter lives right near Magnuson Park.  Also, it is close to three good grocery stores.  Our host was very good about sending us reminder emails with details regarding how to get into the  house.  It was a comfortable room with a nice bathroom and good shower.  I would definitely request this location again as the price was in our budget."
1386306,23677267,2014-12-08,13887051,Adam Bradley,"I Love this Place, truly. Great room, great kitchen, lots of privacy, respectful hosts, right beside the Burke Gilman trail, and close to UW. What more could I ask for?"
1386306,23883696,2014-12-13,168320,Kate,"Lisa's place was lovely. The room was nice and clean and quiet, just what I needed. The apartment is lovely as well and conveniently located to a really great Thai restaurant right down the street. Would highly recommend!"

1386306,26383051,2015-02-10,4456464,Maylene & Charity,We spent one night with Mary while visiting family at the Seattle Children's Hospital. Check-in was super easy and the room was comfortable with all the basics. The bathroom was only shared with one person so showering was easy. The location was perfect for visiting the hospital. We would definitely recommend for people visiting that area.
1386306,27721514,2015-03-10,4256178,Jennifer,"Communicating with Lisa before the stay was easy. Then Mary met me at the house when I arrived. She was kind and easy going and her place was exactly like the picture showed.  I was here on business and kept pretty much to myself and Mary made it easy for me to have everything that I needed so I could enjoy my stay. I would recommend staying here. Street parking was easy, and the house was quiet.The only drawback was that the internet was a bit slow. I would highly recommend this place."
1386306,27897677,2015-03-14,7100956,Josephine,Room was extremely cozy and comfy. Mary was additionally really sweet and helpful. I really liked that there was a welcome binder and it showed you where everything was.. very thoughtful and helpful! The house is about a 12-14 minute bus ride from the UW campus (there are about 3 buses that you can take to campus - each stop within a 2-3 minute walk). 
1386306,28305829,2015-03-22,24417914,Neilly,"Wonderful warm hostesses and home. Mary was generous with her time taking me to discovery Park one day . Comfy clean, couldn't ask for better. House is right on the Burke Gilman Trail makes it convenient for riding or walking. "
1386306,28582679,2015-03-26,4456464,Maylene & Charity,"This was our second time staying at the Garden Room and we really enjoyed our stay.

1386306,29021610,2015-04-02,16311758,Holly,"Warm home, nice neighborhood, great welcome folder with tips on using the shower knob and local restaurants. I would definitely stay here again! "
1386306,29538501,2015-04-08,286545,Yuriy,The Garden room was great. We only stayed one night and we had a great nights sleep on a very comfortable bed. Everything was very clean and just a great place overall. 
1386306,29783455,2015-04-12,28128301,Cassie,My stay overall was great. The room was really nice and the bed was very comfortable. The house is in a great location-within walking distance to grocery stores and a shopping complex. Mary answered any questions that I had either about the area or what sites to see since this was my first time in Seattle. I would definitely recommend staying here if you are visiting the University as well. 
1386306,31831494,2015-05-10,16425497,Xinxin,"i would come back to the same place, if visiting seattle again. safe, close to a store, and uni, Orca card worked really well around seattle. The place is clean and fresh, recycling and compost is convenient.

Mary is a super cool person, lovely to have met her. And thanks Lisa and Mary!"
1386306,31886999,2015-05-11,28367593,Lily,I had a great stay here. The room was as beautiful and cozy as in the pictures. Lisa was great about communication. Mary greeted me when I arrived (and talked me through when I went to the wrong place).  Mary was super nice and accommodating. The location was perfect for visiting children's hospital and steps away from the Burke-gilman trail. I would definitely stay again.
1386306,32332188,2015-05-17,11521663,Linda,"This was our first AirBnB experience and we felt like we were in our own home!  Thank you for the most comfortable stay...from our host Mary who took the time to come to the street fair to visit our popcorn booth, (Miss Hannah's Gourmet Popcorn Co.) to the cozy, comfortable bed that enveloped our tired and warn bodies after a hard days work.  The location is so close to everything!  Your basically in the heart of the city, but feel like you're in a small town.  We would happily stay here again!"
1386306,33459959,2015-05-28,174174,Katie,"We were hosted by Mary who is a lovely, generous and tidy housemate at this AirBnB. We were very impressed by the quality of this accommodation, it's safe neighborhood location and it's proximity to the bike path, parks, restaurants and of course the Children's Hospital. We absolutely loved our stay in Seattle. If we go back, we will definitely try to stay here and will recommend it to all of our friends as well. Mary and Lisa, thank you so much !!

The house is very bright, clean and welcoming. In the room was a prepared tray with water, tea, a water boiler and a sophisticated folder full of useful information and directions, which makes you feel like you're staying in a hotel. The great waffles that I got one morning just added to that impression. 
Thanks for the great accommodation!"

We were able to arrive late on our first evening with no issues as she arranged to have the keys in a lock box.  They were available for any issues and had some good recommendations.  Any issues or questions we had, Peggy took care of it and had answers.  It was smooth sailing all the way.  The place itself is really nice and functional.  It served our purposes just fine and we'd be happy to stay again.

The place is cozy and comfortable, in a nice neighborhood, quaint, quiet, and safe neighborhood.  Yet, it's not too far away from anything either.  It was a very pleasant first Seattle experience for us."
6202214,53268779,2015-11-07,31845638,Allan,"Peggy and Rick are such a nice couple! Very available and willing to help with anything. Their basement is incredible, spacious and has its own entry system, apart from the main house. Everything is brand new, the decoration is very tasteful and you'll find everything you need in appliances and other basic items. The neighborhood is very quiet with good restaurants nearby. There's also a QFC Grocery Store just a few blocks away (but be ready to go up uphill, this is Seattle). "
6202214,55741564,2015-12-05,5658985,Michael,Peggy and Richard were very helpful and responsive. The space was perfect for our needs and parking was convenient.
1539463,7946325,2013-10-09,8043355,Dagný,"My boyfriend and I spent a week with Rainer. His house is very big and beautiful and the bedroom we had upstairs was big and comfy. We had our own bathroom that was across the hall. Rainer was incredibly helpful and gave us endless tips on where best to shop, what was best to see and so on. The house is pretty close to downtown, and we walked there almost every day, only half an hour or so, but there are also buses that go straight downtown in a walking distance of 2 minutes. The dog is a big sweetheart, and we absolutely loved having her there. We had the most incredible time there and Seattle is a great city. I would definitely recommend this place!"
1539463,8106883,2013-10-15,2334514,Arman,"I had quite a pleasant stay at Rainer's. I booked the place last minute and he got back to me quickly so that I was able to make arrangements. 

He was quite knowledgeable about the city and his place was well kept and very inviting. It was situated in a quiet neighborhood and within walking distance to the most happening places near downtown seattle.  I had everything I needed to have a comfortable  and pleasant stay. 

I'd recommend his place to friends and would consider staying there during my next visit. 

"
1539463,8355044,2013-10-27,4270102,Den,"We (me and my wife) went to Seattle the first time for 2 full days to explore the city downtown and some notable landmarks (like Space Needle and Pike Place Market).

Rainer is one of the most interesting and wise people we've ever met. It was a pleasure to meet him. He gave us a lot of tips on exploring the city.

House itself is just a brand new mansion! We had a room + our own bathroom with everything we might need. We felt comfortable and warm at this place. Dog lives near the front door (she is very friendly!) and she didn't disturb us anyhow. Other important amenities: coffee machine and fireplace! 

We're going to visit Seattle next year and will try to catch up with Rainer at that time and stay at his place again.

Location: perfect for those who love to walk. For others there is a bus stop 1 block away :)

We're happy about this stay and trip overall!"
1539463,10587233,2014-02-26,9706946,Theresa,"I stayed there 4 nights and it was just perfect. A nice and very clean house. Good access to puplic transportation. My room was very comfortable and light and an own big bathroom including towls and shampoo. The dog didn't disturb at all and is well educated. Free access to the laundry, coffee machine and refrigerator. Rainer is a very kind host. I just enjoyed all the conversations with him. He has a good knowledge about the city and country."
1539463,11493511,2014-04-05,912564,Steve And Michael,"We really enjoyed staying at Rainer's lovely home. The room was very comfortable as was the separate bathroom. 

Rainer was the consummate host - making sure we did not lack for any convenience. 

The neighborhood attractive, quite and very well located close to the Capital Hill area. Downtown Seattle and the University of Washington are easily accessible.

We highly recommend Rainer's Air BandB for your Seattle stay."
1539463,13582997,2014-05-31,15565618,Michael,"I spent a few days at Rainer's place and really liked it very much. Rainer is a friendly, caring and prudent host. The same applies to the dog Sheila, by the way. The house is located in a calm neighbourhood and you get your own bedroom and bathroom, all nice and clean. It's also very convenient that you can do your laundry when needed.
Within walking distance are downtown (about 2.5 km), hotspot Capitol Hill, a nice grocery store and countless cafés, bars and restaurants. You can also ride the bus to downtown which departs nearby. Rainer has lots of advice and recommendations at hand, so you never feel lost in the new city.
If you consider exploring the region by rental car (which would be a good thing to go to the outlet center or to go see national parks) then I would choose this place over a downtown location any time since it's no hassle regarding parking space.
I had a great time in Seattle and hope to come again one day!"
1539463,13803101,2014-06-04,7224271,Alissa And Steve,"Our 4 night stay at Rainer's home was very enjoyable. The house is in good proximity to Capital Hill and downtown (20min walk) and in a nice, safe neighbourhood. Rainer was very friendly and had great tips about things to do and see in the area. We also loved meeting Sheila (the adorable and loveable dog)!   "
1539463,13918900,2014-06-08,14937232,Yongzhi,"It is really great to live at Rainer's home. Very clean bedroom and wonderful private bathroom! Also, during the days I spent in Rainer's home, I felt warm and friendly. By the way, there are so many advices and I really appreciate that!"
1539463,14174514,2014-06-13,1369635,Nilofer,"Rainer is a kind, generous and friendly host.
I had a wonderful stay at his home - so inviting and relaxing. It was beautiful, comfortable, clean, spacious and in a lovely Seattle neighborhood. 

He is well traveled and worldly so be sure to make some time for great conversation. 

Thank you so much for hosting me Rainer.
I hope to be back."
1539463,14669443,2014-06-23,7532869,Lauren,"Rainer was a great host. The house was very clean and quiet. The bathroom was conveniently located across the hall from the bedroom. Rainer was very welcoming, helpful and friendly. We didn't stay at the house very long any of the days we were there but Rainer made it a point to check in with us and see if there was anything we needed. Overall we thoroughly enjoyed our stay and would come back again for future trips to Seattle. "
1539463,15115419,2014-07-02,16912359,Xiwang,I stayed in Rainer's house for three days. Just got back from Seattle. It was a great experience. Rainer is very nice and helpful. The house is spacious and the neighborhood is very safe and tranquil. The bus directly takes me to the downtown in 15 minutes. I had a very good time with Rainer. Highly recommend!
1539463,15548377,2014-07-11,17057236,Gianne,"I love the time at Rainer's house! He is friendly and flexible . The sunset from his patio is pretty! I like the location because it is a quiet suburban area and yet I can still easily get to any tourist spot by bus 2 or 8. The room and bathroom are super tidy. I can't ask for more! If I go to Seattle next time, I will choose to stay there again. "
1539463,15655316,2014-07-13,17691433,Anona,This was a perfectly lovely place to stay. The room and bathroom was very clean and new looking. The location was perfect for anyone who enjoys getting to know a city through walking. I suggest have a cup of coffee ( which he provides) while sitting on the patio enjoying the view.
1539463,16111310,2014-07-22,16976660,Kathy,"Our visit was nice, and we found our host Rainer to be very gracious. He gave us lots of advice about things to do and see, and we had full use of the kitchen, too. Parking was very convenient, as was the location--so close to many Seattle attractions!"
1539463,16513741,2014-07-28,1814035,Toni,"Rainer was a lovely host.  He offered lots of privacy yet was helpful as needed. 

The home is inviting and the Madrona room and private bath was perfect for my short business stay. 

The location is terrific. I had an invigorating walk to Lake Washington one afternoon and enjoyed several fabulous meals at local eating establishments. 

I highly recommend enjoying this space."
1539463,18656793,2014-08-30,16401432,Connie,"I stayed here for a month for an away rotation, and the experience was completely positive on all fronts. Rainer is a wonderful host-- gracious and accommodating. He became much like an Asian mother to me. The home is beautiful, and the amenities are all new. If there was something I needed, Rainer likely has it and is willing to help you get it. He is a knowledgeable fund of information and full of helpful suggestions. 

Access to public transportation is abundant if walking a few blocks does not bother you. Getting downtown or to any of the hospitals is quite easy. The neighborhood is quiet and safe as I found myself running or walking in the evenings. This is a highly recommended place to stay."
1539463,18838606,2014-09-01,8015121,Martin,"Rainer was a gracious and helpful host. He have us some great tips on places we could walk to for food and drink, and made himself available for any questions we had. The house was is a great location! The bus stop is just nearby to take downtown or elsewhere, and there are many different areas with restaurants and bars within walking distance. The house was spotless and was obviously very well maintained. Overall a very wonderful experience!"
1539463,22855699,2014-11-16,23126827,Raj,"Beautiful house, wonderful host. Rainer and his wife made me feel like I was at home. Everything was as described, comfortable room and bed with a mini Library which has some great books, a private bathroom. Loads and loads of privacy. Fast Internet. 
Rainer is very knowledgeable and a great guide, you can pretty much ask him about anything and he'll have an answer. 
The place is very close to all the happening in Seattle, great restaurants nearby.
I lived here for 2 weeks and Overall I had a fantastic experience, I also indulged in a traditional Tea ceremony with the folks. It was beautiful.
All in all I highly recommend this place to anyway that is looking to stay close to Cap hill, downtown, madrona,central district.
Cheers!"
1539463,27056825,2015-02-24,10705641,Laura,"Very welcoming host and housemate!  Near the bus line, so take earplugs.  Otherwise, a great, convenient place, clean, uncluttered and well-lit.  It would've been nice to have more time to get to know them!
"
1539463,28274740,2015-03-21,12582159,Tim,"Before arriving communication was great between Rainer and I via the Airbnb and website and text.

Rainer welcomed my girlfriend and I to his lovely home and showed us around. Special attention was given in showing us how to use his coffee maker. (If you like coffee, give this machine a try.)

The house is immaculately clean and the photos represent the house well. As his description states, you have access to a private bathroom a few feet from the room.

One other review mentioned earplugs for the bus traffic sound. Neither I or my girlfriend were bothered by any sound. In fact we felt very comfortable.

Public transport is apparently close. Didn't use it as we walked, had a car and used Uber. Getting around from Rainers home is simple any way you chose. 

All in all a great place to say if you are visiting Seattle."
1539463,29886966,2015-04-13,22489693,Christy,"Oh, my! Our stay at Rainer's home was outstanding and so very comfortable. He and his wife are lovely hosts and made us feel right at home. Our private bedroom and bath were perfect. Thank you, Rainer and Jing, for sharing your home with us :)"
1539463,31069761,2015-05-01,9330540,Kash,What a gorgeous house and welcoming hosts! Everything in the room was as described. Very comfortable room with a private bathroom. Very convenient location and great neighborhood to take a walk. Rainier has been in Seattle for a while and he is very knowledgeable about everything around here. I would definitely recommend this place if you are visiting Seattle. Awesome collection of books too in the room.
1539463,32647526,2015-05-19,22022390,Ane,"Me and my friends stay at Rainer's house went very smooth. He was a nice and helpful host who made sure we had everything we needed. Our privacy was respected but we also got advice on how to explore the city when we needed that. We could come and leave as we wanted. Rainer is very easy to communicate with! The location was also perfect for us. The only drawback with this place is that the bed might be a bit small if you are two friends traveling instead of a couple. For us introverted Norwegians, sharing a duvet and everything was a bit uncomfortable. But I guess you have to adapt to the culture ;)"
1539463,38823501,2015-07-19,6167479,Herman,"Where do I begin? My six week stay with Rainer by far has been the best airbnb experiences I have had. The house, room, kitchen, etc are exactly as they are described in the listing and perfect for what I needed during my stay. Rainer is very responsive through all modes of communication and is more than willing to provide recommendations on things to do and eat and places to see. The location of the house cannot be beat! The description he includes about the neighborhood and walking distances/times to places are spot on. Additionally, in a major city like Seattle, the free parking around his neighborhood is unbelievably convenient. Overall, I cannot highly recommend this place enough! "
1539463,39349284,2015-07-22,2223731,Kent,I really enjoyed my stay with Rainer and his wife.  They have a beautiful home that is very comfortable and exceptionally clean.  They were very friendly and hospitable.  The coffee was delicious in the morning.  I wish I could have stayed longer.

Die Unterkunft war wirklich klasse, ich war mehr als positiv überrascht! Rainer, der Gastgeber, mitsamt seiner Frau waren freundlich, allzeit hilfsbereit und trotzdem sehr unaufdringlich.
Der Raum war nicht groß (auf dem Bild ist das allgemeine Wohnzimmer zu sehen) zum übernachten auf für viele Tage (ich war 10 Tage dort) absolut ausreichend. Die Lage ist super! B s Downtown Seattle mit dem Bus 15 Minuten (inklusive Gehzeit zur Busstation) und die Gegend ist mit den öffentlichen sehr gut vernetzt! Selbst zu Fuß von Downtown in reichlichen 30 Minuten zu erreichen. Die Nachbarschaft ist sehr durchmischt (was ich sehr positiv finde), d.h. von jung bis alt, von reich bis arm und von (bildhaft gesprochen) schwarz bis weis alles vorhanden, inklusive der Straßenparty am Wochenende.

Bei meinem nächsten Aufenthalt in SEA werde ich sehr gerne wieder bei Rainer anklopfen!

+++++++++++++++++++++++

The lodging is great, it was apositive surprise to me! Rainer, the host is great (including his charming wife!). Helping, always on service but nevertheless very discreet.
The room tend to be smaller but even for longer stays absolutely comfortable. The location is great within an vibrant neighborhood and still close to Seattle Downtown. By bus 20 minutes (inkluding walk to bus station, greatly cross-linked to the public tansport and even by foot within 35 minutes walking distance from Downtown.
If I come back to Seattle I will again knock at Rainers door."
1539463,41637915,2015-08-08,1020444,Ryan,Rainer's place is in a great location close to Capitol Hill. The house and accommodations  are nice and clean and it really is a steal. On top of this Rainer and his wife were very friendly and helpful during our stay.
1539463,42274840,2015-08-12,2466660,Martin,"Wonderful, clean house in a safe and quiet neighborhood. Everything was as listed. Very convenient access to Seattle and surrounding attractions. "
1539463,43076135,2015-08-17,16200832,Katie,"We had a great stay! Rainer and his wife are both lovely, accommodating people full of advice for people new to Seattle. We enjoyed walking into town each day.  The house is just a few blocks away from some great cafes and shops and if you like walking,  you can easily get in and out of town on foot. 
The room is great and we felt very comfortable to just come and go or enjoy our room without pressure to be social, but also enjoyed chatting with our hosts.  A really easy going home. 
More plums than can be realistically eaten by two human beings. Local and freshly picked! "
1539463,44128333,2015-08-24,36536345,Mark,"My wife and I really enjoyed staying at Rainer's home.  He has a beautiful house that is very inviting and comfortable.  The bedroom is great and the private bathroom across the hall is well appointed.  There is free parking right in front of the house on the street which worked out well for us and his location is convenient to much of the city.  You won't be disappointed.   I was able to talk to Rainer a couple times during our stay.  He is a great host and very knowledgeable about Seattle and the surrounding areas.  He can offer many options for touring the area if you need that.  If we travel out west again and need a place to stay, his home will be first on our list."
5096363,25777878,2015-01-25,6188181,Jenna,"Emily's cozy West Seattle home proved to be an absolutely perfect place for our quick overnight stay! While we didn't interact with her in person, all of her communication was clear, warm and friendly--she was super clear on any helpful details, too, which made the logistics a breeze. The room is a good size, the bed is very comfortable, the bathroom is right next door, and you have the lower level to yourself for a nice bit of privacy. Seattle guidebooks on the room's beside table and a box of treats/commonly-forgotten-when-packing items were such nice little touches! Would very happily stay here again."
5096363,26798266,2015-02-19,14862663,Jason,Comfy bed and only a couple blocks to the bus. Emily is very friendly and give you your privacy :)

The room and the bathroom are very nice, and we were pleased to find a box of treats and toiletries left for us. We didn't meet Emily in person, but communication with her was very quick and clear. Would definitely stay again!"
5096363,33329318,2015-05-26,21009100,Amanda,"Staying with Emily was very simple and straight forward. She was prompt in communication and easy and flexible to work with. Her home is quiet and she likes her privacy, which means you also get yours :) I never got the chance to interact with her personally but she was very nice through text and over the phone. I appreciate her trust and for allowing me to come and go as needed as I was left with a key! There were a generous amount of toiletries left and the bedroom had a very handy book of info on places to visit which I did use and plus the WiFi code. I would recommend Emily and stay with her again!"
5096363,33421017,2015-05-27,111996,James,Emily's setup is very comfortable and clean. I appreciated having the patio door by the bed for fresh air and plenty of light.

Thanks again! "

We didn't have a chance to meet Emily, but our stay was a good one. We would recommend this house to anyone who wants privacy and the ability to come and go as you please!"
5096363,35118046,2015-06-15,33498486,Reid,"Great place to stay, room was perfect. Bathroom was clean and stocked with plenty of fresh towels. Bed was very comfy too."

5096363,35546572,2015-06-20,29813765,Madeline,Emily's place was welcoming and comfortable. Just a few minutes walk to the bus to get into downtown Seattle in 15-20 minutes. We would love to stay with Emily if we are in Seattle again.
5096363,38332402,2015-07-14,24698618,Sarah,"Lodging in Seattle can be quite expensive, so we were happy to find this affordable listing for our stay! Emily has a very nice town home in West Seattle, which was about a 10-15 minute drive (depending on traffic) from downtown. The room itself was spotless and very cozy, certainly big enough for two people and our luggage, and it was great to have a private bathroom. Emily was very accommodating with parking and bike storage, as well. Since she lives above the room, there will be a little noise when she is at home, but nothing more noticeable than what you'd experience in any hotel. We also appreciated the magazines and goodies she left in the room for us, and she was easy to reach by text message. Great host and place!"
5096363,38773243,2015-07-18,37576999,Christopher,"Emily did a fantastic job as a host! A very nice setup with a lot of character! A gift box was left with razors, shampoo, etc... And there were treats in another box, which we loved! West Seattle was a beautiful place and the bus stop was well within walking distance to head right to downtown! Thank you so much Emily"

We prefer to keep to ourselves, so it was perfect for us. The bed was comfortable and we had a great night's sleep."
5096363,39138827,2015-07-20,14728026,Marijke,"Very nice room in quiet neighborhood.  Emily allowed us to make last-minute arrangements, which was very nice when our previous plans fell through.  Easy bus access (about 2 blocks to the stop).  Room looks exactly like the picture, very clean.  Box of treats most appreciated!"
5096363,39649937,2015-07-25,36633602,Nancy,"My host's communication prior to my arrival was clear, concise, timely and welcoming. The accommodations were exactly as described in the listing: friendly, comfortable, clean and convenient. It is small, as space in Seattle is at a premium, but the bedroom and bath are ideal for one or two people. There is plenty of closet and stow-away space and multiple attractive personal touches. I appreciated the privacy and ability to come and go independently. The wi-fi connection was a godsend. The location just off a busy artery is surprisingly secluded and quiet, yet only steps from bus lines into Seattle. This was an enjoyable, repeatable experience."
5096363,40640797,2015-08-01,10876532,David,"Straight forward, lots of privacy. Comfy bed. Not a bad thing but the room is on the smaller side which is nice to know ahead of time."

Such a great first Air BnB experience! Thanks Emily! 
5096363,41853987,2015-08-09,11673295,Signe,"I had a great stay at Emily's place. The room is cozy, with all amenities provided, including a towel and snacks/water. Her home is in a quiet neighborhood, with Seattle a 20 minute scenic bus ride away. Emily was easily reachable before and during my stay, via airbnb and phone.   I would definitely recommend staying here if you want a comfortable night's rest & don't mind commuting from downtown. "
5096363,42744713,2015-08-15,21187551,Dave,"Private room and bathroom. No problems with arrival, stay or departure. We heard the host upstairs but never saw her, which makes for a private experience which we liked."
5096363,43407086,2015-08-19,34225625,Travis,"Perfect, just as advertised."
5096363,45014988,2015-08-30,11428690,Andre,"The room was exactly as described: cozy and quiet.   The room is also extremely private.   I never met the host the 5 days I stayed there however I felt that if I needed anything Emily would have been there for me.  Location was perfect  with easy access to downtown Seattle by buss, ferry or car.  Would definitely stay there again the next time in town. "
5096363,45354799,2015-09-01,6660712,Stephanie,Emily was a great host. My partner and I only stayed for one night but it was easy to find and the room was all set up for us with an extra goody box upon arrival. It was cozy and quiet and I'd be happy to stay again. 
5096363,46065115,2015-09-07,24442702,Griffin,"Great location in West Seattle. Easily accessible to downtown Seattle (about an 8 mile Uber drive, or 4.5 miles to the harbor where you can take a $4.75 water taxi into downtown, also close to bus stop). I had everything I needed, plus a box of goodies and some much-needed toiletries! Emily was kind enough to leave travel books, etc, which helped me navigate the city. Check-in and check-out were extremely easy and smooth and Emily responded very quickly to all questions and even helped me with public transportation. I recommend!"
5096363,46914369,2015-09-14,32856153,Lynn,"The accommodations were clean, quiet, and private.  The room was small, so I would recommend it for sleeping only.  Lynn Rowell"
5096363,47601451,2015-09-20,44384020,Nicholas,Extremely clean and awesome spot in West Seattle. Everything wa a exactly and described. Planning on staying here again the next time I'm in town. A great host with a beautiful home.

5096363,48487586,2015-09-26,26246698,Leah,"Emily's place was wonderful. A friend and I stayed just for a night, rather last-minute, and Emily was super-accommodating with the schedule. The space was quiet and very lovely, pretty and clean, and she even left some goodies for us! The bed was very comfortable. Emily was responsive and helpful in our communications. A recommended spot to stay if you're in the area!"
5096363,49745992,2015-10-05,9839193,Elyse,Emily's place was exactly as advertised. The bed was amazingly comfortable and the private bathroom was right outside the door. We did not meet Emily but the experience was exactly as expected. Emily also leaves a great goody box! 
5096363,51394069,2015-10-19,33817016,Dana,"Emily's place was perfect! The room was cozy and clean. Emily was so sweet to provide us with little goodies in the room as well.  I also loved the fact that she made it as private as possible by leaving the bottom floor to us while she stayed upstairs, yet still being available for any questions or concerns we may have had. Definitely perfect for a weekend's stay in Seattle. "
5096363,53722772,2015-11-11,5350210,Kathie,"We enjoyed our stay at Emily's place and greatly appreciated that she was able to take us and our small dog with very little notice. Her townhouse is warm and welcoming and the queen sized bed is very soft/comfortable. 

The bathroom amenities were very appreciated and everything was really well put together. The bedroom has its own thermostat, so you can turn it up if you get cold. Key pickup and dropoff was easy and convenient. 

Only downsides were that even with two mats at the entrance, I still felt like we were tracking in leaves/rain from outside. I guess that's par for the course with Seattle weather, but I still felt bad about it! 

Also, there is only street parking, and while we were parked overnight on the closest street someone tried to steal my boyfriend's bike off the roof rack. Luckily the lock did its job, but I recommend removing valuables and locking your car if you need to park on the street. Overall the neighborhood seems safe, it's mostly other townhouse complexes and doesn't seem sketchy. "
5096363,54078944,2015-11-15,42646350,Kian,"Great and clean room and bathroom! fresh towels and great box of goodies of snacks and beverages. 
I want to thank Emily for her hospitality!"
5096363,55490655,2015-12-01,46616652,Meinolf,"Gemütliches ruhiges Zimmer. Es war alles so wie beschrieben.
Die Gastgeberin Emily habe ich in 4 Tagen nicht einmal gesehen. Aber alles hat prima geklappt.Die Lage ist sehr ruhig. Zur nächsten Busverbindung muss man ca. 5 Minuten zu Fuß laufen. Internet Verbindung war super."
5096363,56704784,2015-12-16,31042532,Leila,Emily was very accommodating.
7162664,40487164,2015-07-31,974465,Joseph,We had such a great time staying in Seattle at Michele's home.  The place looked just like in the photos and matched the description perfectly.  Michele had great communication throughout and made the whole process very easy for us.  The neighborhood was great too!  Thanks again!
7162664,41419577,2015-08-07,25863617,Kate,I had a great time staying at Michele's house in Seattle. The house looks even better in person than it did in the pictures! Really beautiful kitchen and deck area and a great view of the city. Would definitely recommend staying there!
7162664,42032991,2015-08-10,15858830,Simon,Great communication and very easy to get to. Great to have the parking permit as well.  The apartment itself was really nicely kitted it and even nicer than the photos. And the view of the needle was great. Also really easy to wander to the space needle and get the monorail into town. A lovely stay in Seattle.
7162664,42922034,2015-08-16,5919853,Tina,"Michele's house was true to the photos.  It was clean and cozy. It is an older building but renovated nicely with modern finishes. The deck was amazing for early morning coffee and views of the Seattle skyline and Space Needle.
Having the parking permit worked out well and nearby spots were pretty easy to find.
The location was great. Getting downtown was easy from there.  The Space Needle and Chihuly Glass Garden/Exhibit were an easy walk, along with several neighborhood bars and restaurants.
Michele made checkin and checkout extremely easy.  She left helpful instructions and suggestions for places to eat and things to do in Seattle.
She was readily available by text or phone for any questions.
I did not want to leave and would definitely stay there again on my next visit to Seattle."
7162664,43568885,2015-08-20,41133956,Raviv,Simply perfect.
7162664,44318003,2015-08-25,33494879,Carrie,"Michele's home truly is a GEM in the heart of the city! She was an excellent host, making our arrival and departure  seamless. We adored the modern feel of the space, the luxurious bedding, well stocked kitchen, and the patio!! The sunny patio was amazing, with a spectacular view of the space needle and the cityscape.  We spent a lot of time at the house, relaxing, cooking, and sipping wine on the patio, it was truly an oasis. The location was perfect, and it was no problem not having a car, we were able to walk everywhere!  We will stay here again any chance we get! Thanks Michele, for a perfect mini holiday!"
7162664,48184166,2015-09-24,35385979,Sylvie,"Michele's house is a little gem in a friendly neighbourhood of Seattle, conveniently located with great restaurants. The house itself is lovely, modern with a zen touch, very comfy.  The deck is really a nice place to relax.
Michele is very helpful and answers quickly all your questions. She makes herself available if there is any problem to fix. 
I'll definitely try  to stay at her house if I ever come back to Seattle ! Thanks. "
7162664,49024749,2015-09-30,26431137,Angel,"Host made me feel welcome! the listing was described accurate, I liked the neighborhood.  "
7162664,50553101,2015-10-12,3818121,Gabriel,"Michele's place was great! Very clean, perfect location, and a great view of the space needle from the living room and the deck. Highly recommended."
7162664,56359855,2015-12-12,9018719,Melisa,The host canceled this reservation 10 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.

8866927,56292870,2015-12-11,13246618,Paul-Charles,"What a wonderful place to stay. Warm, cozy, and very comfortable. I really enjoyed my stay and look forward to visiting again."
8866927,56824564,2015-12-18,51253545,Steve,"The space was just as advertised: cozy, comfortable, and had everything I needed for a relaxing stay. The decor was accommodating, including a good couch and a super comfy bed, along with a fridge and nice mini-kitchen area. The apartment itself is separate from the main house, so it's completely private. And it's in a great neighborhood, only a five minute drive to some great shops and restaurants along Ballard Ave and Market Street. (If you're looking for a cool little neighborhood tavern, I recommend a fun, old school bar called Hattie's Hat. Great food and atmosphere.)

I would definitely recommend Tim's backyard bungalow to anyone visiting from out of town; it's a great place to relax and explore one of the great old areas of Seattle."
8866927,57109426,2015-12-21,9595208,Katie,"Tim and his wife were excellent hosts. Didn't get a chance to meet them, but they were more than easy to communicate with over text. My girlfriend and I were stranded in Seattle and they were able accommodate us last minute. Not only that but their place is well equipped and very cozy on a rainy Seattle eve. Highly recommend!"
8866927,57803806,2015-12-29,259314,Dena,"Tim and Kelly answered all our questions and offered to provide anything we needed.  The bungalow is clean, comfortable, and cozy.  The kitchenette is well equipped for preparing simple meals. We enjoyed runs and walks around the neighborhood.  This is an excellent value and we will definitely stay here again. "
1684236,8154976,2013-10-18,8942402,Rex,"A pleasant hassle free experience staying with David.

Our first experience with Airbnb was rocky, being let down by three hosts in a row – why do those hosting not keep their booking schedules current? We selected and booked only one at a time, then had our deposit returned to start the process again. After three false starts we were becoming desperate to find a place on time, then David came to the rescue.

David was obliging enough to meets us at 11.15pm (admittedly he was just finishing vacuuming the place spotless), given a good rundown on the facilities, set us up with the free WIFI and off to a very comfortable Queen sized bed – (love the soft red duvet cover).
Next day David was still considering his guests by installing new LED low temperature bedside reading lamps – much used and appreciated.

We were given an excellent value stay for two weeks in an apartment with a fine 13 story view in a solid older style building with excellent insulation and sound resistance. The freeway is close but the noise is a gentle hum more like a distant surf beach unless you wish to sleep with an open double glazed window which most would have no need. 

Just adjacent the Conference Centre, it was easy walking distance downhill to Pikes Market, a bus from there to the Space Needle and return by bus, $2.25  to a stop 500yds from the apartment – location excellent for those without a car.

A good sized 42"" TV in a comfortable combined living room / kitchen, a good sized separate double bedroom, bathroom with good quality glass sliding shower doors over the bath and excellent storage facilities. All linen, towels, soap and spare toiletries in the cupboards along with an ironing board and iron.

Furniture is mostly new and contemporary with a comfortable leather lounge suite (loved the rotating arm chair) and a good book selection.
The compact kitchen facilities includes a dishwasher, full sized cooker and refrigerator with microwave over – all necessary cookware, eating crockery and cutlery. Coffee and filters available for travellers who have not yet purchased their own stocks, was a nice touch along with the thoughtful chocolates.

We have given a detailed description of the facilities because David was off to Italy a few days later and had not the time to promote his apartment in the way most others do. Despite having little detail in the description, we were so glad we took the chance and correctly guessed that David and his apartment would be up to a reasonable standard – we were pleasantly surprised that it exceeded our expectations.

David, you will be the only person we contact for accommodation when next we are in Seattle (about January14) and you have our email address to stay with us when next you visit NZ – we must continue that chat about ecology and sustainability.
Thanks again – Rex & Glenys
"
1684236,9313217,2013-12-20,8905955,J L,"I had a great stay in this bright cozy condo which is a perfect base from which to explore Seattle downtown, Pioneer Square and the waterfront. Really enjoyed the view and the nicely appointed living area. Comfortable bed too. David is a perfect host and very helpful to make sure my stay was a pleasant one. Very affordable rate too.
Would definitely stay here again."
1684236,9689000,2014-01-05,10640734,Wendy,"Location and Price are a great match.  We walked and used public transportation to reach all of our destinations (Pike Place, Pacific Science Museum, EMP, Space Needle, Grocery Store, etc.)  It was a couple blocks from the bus depot, and a few more to the light-rail which will take you directly from the airport to downtown Seattle for $3.  You'll have to pay for parking, so if you don't want public transportation, be aware parking is atrocious but doable.

David was a great host.  He left us a stocked fridge, treats, wine, and gave us directions to all the tourist locations we needed.  Laundry is $1 each for washing and drying in the complex, and David provided the detergent.  He also has a small but nice supply of DVDs. The apartment was wonderfully warm in the winter, and the view was great.  We enjoyed our stay."
1684236,9917551,2014-01-19,11043289,Jason,"What a fantastic host David was. He left us all sorts of information about how to get around and gave us recommendations about great places to eat. The apartment itself was incredibly clean and organized, and really made us feel comfortable when it came time to relax between adventures. Everything was there, even all the kitchenware we needed to make breakfast in the morning! 

The bonus for us was that he wasn't kidding when he said he was close to the convention center (and downtown in general). It's practically right outside your door! You can't beat that location.

We had a great time staying at David's place, and would absolutely recommend it to anybody going to Seattle! We're even hoping to come back ourselves. "
1684236,9977668,2014-01-22,3119086,Brandon,"David's place is fantastic and he was an excellent host. Great communication prior to my arrival and he was flexible on the meeting time for my check-in, which was much appreciated. And he even had a bottle of wine for a welcoming gift - too nice! The space was very clean, super quiet, and could not be better located to access downtown or Capitol Hill area on foot or public transportation. I did have a car and found parking in a several block radius each night, but parking isn't a given in that dense area of town and might take a few minutes of searching to find a spot. The size is ideal for an individual or couple. Fast wi-fi, cable, comfortable bed, clean, great view...yeah, I'll be checking in with David first to see if his place is open next time I'm in Seattle!"
1684236,10674105,2014-03-03,1580729,Kate,"This was a wonderful experience! I was in town for a conference at the convention center, and David's apartment couldn't have been more convenient. He put together a binder full of information not only about the building (laundry, etc.) but also all sort of visitor information and things to do, which was very helpful. Despite the fact that my flight got in quite late at night, David met me at the apartment to go through the binder and give me the key. Everything was great-- comfortable bed, nice kitchen, coffee maker and coffee, extra towels and little hotel shampoos and soaps in the bathroom. I highly recommend staying here! "
1684236,10975867,2014-03-16,10347568,Erica,"David was a great host. Very flexible considering our flight didn't land until 2:15 a.m. and we didn't get there until about 2:50 a.m.. He was in communication with us the whole way through. When we finally got to the building, he was in the hallway and said ""Welcome to Seattle"" which was great! He also included a nice binder book full of directions and recommendations. His place is in a great location. Very easy to get around. The only minor thing was the bed was more firm than I'm use to, so it took some adjusting. However, I would definitely stay with David again! "
1684236,11171101,2014-03-24,11267903,Mandy,"My experience was great! David is a gracious host; he provided excellent communication and directions to the apartment, and greeted me warmly when I arrived. He was also meticulously organized, and provided a binder full of useful information about the apartment and the city. The apartment was clean and comfortable, and the view is great! Its location is also extremely convenient; downtown is literally around the corner, and many of Seattle's amenities are a short and enjoyable walk away. I was in Seattle for a conference, and I could easily run back to the apartment for a break between sessions. I also had no trouble walking from Downtown or Capitol Hill alone in the evenings; the area is well-lit and quite social. I felt very much at home, and I would definitely stay there again!"
1684236,11346318,2014-03-31,4718513,Avigayil,"We had the most lovely stay at David's apartment. As we were going to ECCC at the convention center you really could not get any closer than this. It was a perfect home base for our weekend stay. The furniture in the living room is super comfortable (love the colour too!) and when the sun is out it is a joy to sit in that room. The real bed was nice and though you could hear the traffic while in the bedroom, it actually lulled me to sleep. Love the shower head and the bathroom comes well stocked with anything you might forget on your journey: soap, shampoo, toothpaste, etc. David was very friendly and accommodating as we arrived in Seattle a bit late due to delays crossing the border. Very pleasant stay and lovely host - highly recommend!"
1684236,11805894,2014-04-15,6602915,Adam,"David's place worked out great for us.  We took the light rail in from the airport and it was quick and easy to find his place from the train station.  The location of David's place was great, we either walked or took a bus and it was super easy to get around the city.  The apartment was clean and comfortable.  We didn't do any cooking because there were so many great restaurants nearby but if you wanted to the kitchen is pretty well stocked.  I would stay here again if we came back to Seattle and highly recommend it to anyone who is just in Seattle for sightseeing like we were!"
1684236,13145122,2014-05-20,2510170,Andrew,"David was a perfect host! Upon arrival he met us at the apartment and explain everything we needed to know.  The apartment was very clean, kitchen stocked, and in an ideal location! Will definitely stay there again and recommend others to his apartment.  Thanks David!"
1684236,14010493,2014-06-10,4436754,Matt,David's place was a great little one bedroom 2 minutes from the paramount theatre. Something broke in the bathroom and he came over ASAP to fix it. Great place great guy.
1684236,14179251,2014-06-14,9019790,Julia,"We had a three nights stay at David's apartment. It was awesome. The apartment is centrally located, basically everything is walking distance. David was waiting for us at his place to hand over the keys. The fridge was stocked with everything you could ask for. We had a great time. I definitely can recommend this place and would come back at my next stay in Seattle."
1684236,14389073,2014-06-18,3387420,Giovanni,Just echoing the sentiments of others on here David is a great host and made my time in Seattle all the more enjoyable. He was very flexible with my check-in and made an extra effort to get me settled before noon. Great communication throughout the process and provides a very useful binder with info on the city and travel brochures. The apartment itself is very clean and comfortable. The kitchen is amply stocked in case you're ever hungry or thirsty. While I ate out for the most part I really appreciated that. The apartment is centrally located in a very safe neighborhood and you can walk to most places in 10-15 minutes (Pike Place Market is a 15 minute walk west). Would love to stay here again if I return to the city - thanks David!
1684236,14695834,2014-06-24,7532792,Stacie,The apartment was exactly as advertised.  The location was perfect.  Great for 1-2 people.
1684236,15129072,2014-07-03,11685411,Tim,"This was a great place to stay in Seattle particularly for me as I was attending a conference at the Convention Center (literally 5 minutes walk away). David was there to meet me and talk me through anything I wanted to know. The apartment is well fitted out and the well stocked larder and fridge/freezer made my stay much  easier and enjoyable.
The apartment facilities were all very good - everything I needed down to scissors and a roll of sticky tape! "
1684236,15444105,2014-07-09,7074039,Suzanne,"David's place was easy to find and conveniently located.  He met us in the  lobby of the building, then took us up and showed us around the apartment.  It was very cozy and clean.  He left the kitchen and fridge fully stocked, so we didn't need to go out shopping right away for groceries.  My only suggestion for future guests (during the summer months) would be to bring ear plugs.  If you leave the windows open at night, you can hear quite a bit of traffic noise.  Once the windows were closed, though, the apartment was quite quiet. "
1684236,15670970,2014-07-14,12082771,Kathie,"David was a wonderful host.  He kept in touch the entire week up to our visit and made himself available to meet us to hand over the apartment.  The location was perfect for our needs. Right off of Pike St. 10 blocks up from the Pike Market.  

Everything you could need or want is within walking distance from the apartment.  We actually had a car and turned it in early to avoid parking fees ($22 and up).  The buses run nearby and it is a short walk to the transportation tunnel and the monorail.  I have a bad foot, and I had no troubles getting everywhere we wanted to go!

The apartment had all of the conveniences we could have asked for.  It was clean and well appointed.  The bed was very comfortable, and, even though it was very hot, the fans provided kept a nice breeze going.  Kitchen had everything we could have asked for.

David thought of everything before he left.  There was a blow dryer in the bathroom, as well as hotel sized shampoos, conditioners, soaps, razors, etc.  He was very meticulous in the comfort items.

I would definitely recommend David's place for a single, or a couple, looking for a great location and a private, clean and comfortable space to vacation.

Thanks David! We will be back!
"
1684236,16198837,2014-07-23,13901269,Michael,"David was an excellent host. We experienced travel difficulties that delayed our arrival, but David remained upbeat and welcoming. We stayed in his apartment for four days. Not only did it save buckets on hotel costs, the unit was full of comfortable furniture, good books, and pleasant neighbors. It was an ideal, low-key visit."
1684236,16608196,2014-07-30,13141105,Allison,I booked this place for my parents and David was very easy to work with.  He was quick to respond and provided all the necessary information for my parents' arrival. My parents told me that his place had a nice view and was very clean and convenient.  He was very accommodating and flexible with the check-in time. He even had food in the refrigerator and an umbrella for the rainy weather.  Overall they had a great and enjoyable time staying at his place.  
1684236,16973090,2014-08-05,8283049,Katie,David was am excellent host. His apartment was very clean and inviting. He was incredibly flexible with the key drop off even meeting one of my friends to pick it up. The guide book he left was super informative and the market down the street really did have a great breakfast sandwiches! I would absolutely stay in this apartment again when I venture to Seattle in the future.
1684236,17263975,2014-08-10,13620110,Jackie,"The apartment is just as described with the added bonus of food in the fridge and tea/coffee supplied! Comfortable bed, tidy living space and short walks to most of the places we wanted to see. We also felt secure leaving our stuff there as lots of permanent tenants and someone at the reception desk. Thank you, David"
1684236,17610552,2014-08-15,10482536,Kaci,"David was extremely helpful, he had Seattle really laid out for us. He had so much insight into the city. The apartment was as described and it was in such a convenient location to what we wanted to see. This was absolutely fantastic and we would definitely stay here again."
1684236,18033687,2014-08-20,19795124,Brian,"David did a great job making us feel at home here.  He left a binder with information about things to do in the city, and even left a bus card to use during our stay.  The location is ideal (close to many attractions, easy public transport to/from the airport), and I would highly recommend.  "
1684236,18396087,2014-08-26,13026933,Francois,"Great location for conferences in Seattle, easy to get to with light rail from SeaTac. David met me at my convenience and even let me eat some of food in the apartment.  He has a binder full of useful info for visitors and communication was good.  Clean.  Would definitely stay here again."
1684236,18935289,2014-09-03,3464643,Claudia,We had a great time staying in David's house.  It was a convenient spot and we were pretty comfortable.  Would definitely recommend it if you are attending a conference.
1684236,19363170,2014-09-11,17831567,David,"I thoroughly enjoyed my stay. I was in Seattle for an event at the convention center, and this apartment is right across the street. It was clean and comfortable. I was greeted promptly when I arrived and everything was great. This was my first experience with Airbnb, and I couldn't have asked for anything better."
1684236,20012330,2014-09-22,6091473,Ray,"We had a great long weekend in Seattle. David met us outside the building and showed us to the apartment. My walk to the convention center was just across the street. The location was outstanding for walking to restaurants and the pier. Though we did not spend much time in the apartment it would be our first choice the next time. Ray
"
1684236,22790998,2014-11-15,20588419,Mario,"Great location and value for any activity at the Convention Center and nearby hotels such as the Sheraton. The condo was an easy four block walk, and was the perfect place to sleep and cleanup  while attending my conference. David also procured an air mattress and sheets for a temporary guest I had on two days. "
1684236,25692511,2015-01-23,23611043,Otto,"I was extremely impressed with this unit. Not only was the view excellent, as the pictures show. But the unit was stocked with food and drinks (including coffee and filters for the coffee maker - which was a very nice perk). In addition, the unit was quiet and comfortable, the WiFi worked well as did the cable TV. This is a great example why AirBnB is so much more comfortable than a hotel room. Also, there is a grocery store in the building, and garage parking around the corner. I look forward to staying here again."
1684236,28285739,2015-03-21,23611043,Otto,"Everything is ""as advertised"" and there were no surprises. A couple things that I really enjoy about this unit include its view, the grocery store around the corner, and convenient parking at the convention center. And of course it's location between Capitol Hill and downtown. I look forward to staying here again."
1684236,28817243,2015-03-30,5884533,John,David was a great host! Good communication and accommodating with arrival time. We were attending Emerald City Comic Con so the location was perfect. Great secure building and David had a visitors pass for free street parking. The bed was a little hard for me but that is just personal preference everything else about the stay was great.
1684236,31780162,2015-05-10,29061011,Grace,"David was very welcoming. The apartment was exactly as pictured and described, SUPER convenient to the convention center. David was a great host and left us a plethora of food/drinks. I loved his welcome package and the preloaded public transport ticket he had ready for us. He had a variety of shampoos, conditioners, body soaps to use. Very friendly and a great place to stay."
1684236,32209173,2015-05-15,16403530,Iain,Great stay in Seattle. Would recommend. Thanks!
1684236,34408873,2015-06-08,5007591,Birgit,"I highly recommend David's apartment in Seattle, near the convention center. Communication was easy, location was perfect. Very clean and the attention to detail (awesome guide book!) is greatly appreciated. Fast, reliable internet. 
My arrival was very late due to flight delays, thank you to Doug for waiting up for me. 
The stocked fridge was unexpected and so helpful - all in all an outstanding experience. I hope to stay here again."
1684236,35339022,2015-06-17,17789060,Nathan,"Great neighborhood, very close to the central attraction of Pike's Place, Convention Center, Pioneer Square, and Westfield Center.  Also very close to some amazing restaurants (5min walk).  The place was clean and very easy to get to.  We were even offered to have whatever was in the fridge which was great."
1684236,35909987,2015-06-23,28937335,Richard,"We had a wonderful stay at David's apartment.  It was everything described in the advertisement and more.  David met us upon arrival and made us feel right at home.  There was even food in the cabinets and refrigerator for us just arriving in town.  The view was spectacular, and the address is right in the middle of everything happening in downtown Seattle.  Everything in the apartment was convenient.  We truly enjoyed our stay in Seattle.  Thanks David."
1684236,37470600,2015-07-07,2104411,Sarah,David was very friendly! The space was exactly as described - very clean and organized. I would definitely recommend.
1684236,39743111,2015-07-26,19786141,Sharleen,"The location was perfect, near lots of shops and restaurants. The fridge was full of groceries, and David provided a very handy guide for the area. We would highly recommend this apartment, and would stay here again on our next visit."
1684236,42653390,2015-08-15,7134026,Steven,"I wished to rent an apartment as I was in Seattle work for a convention and wished to stay a little longer to see the city a little. For such trips I prefer an apartment to an hotel room.

It was the first time I have had an apartment where the host moved out so I could rent it.  The apartment is quite homely with personal furnishings for the host.

The apartment is only two minutes from the convention centre which is great.  It meant on a couple of times I could pop back to get changed or drop something off before going on to do something else.

It is also near to all the main amenities including Pike Street market which is worth an afternoon to wander around

David was a great host and replied promptly to messages which was very useful"
1684236,44298355,2015-08-25,10475280,Ernst,"This is in an ideal location right next to the convention center in Seattle and beyond that the accommodations were superb. 

Check-in and check-out were convenient and flexible with my schedule."
1684236,46154114,2015-09-08,9772072,Olga,"The location is great, everything is pretty much walking distance from the place. The apartment is roomy and clean and has everything you need. "
1684236,47001164,2015-09-14,43461354,Lisa,"David was great! 
His communication was A+ and timely. 
The apartment was in the most convenient and central area... Plenty of public transport access... 9 blocks from pike place market... A little store around the corner for if u need drinks or snacks. He also allows u to help yourself to drinks and snacks he has in the apartment. 

It's a cozy little space, great for 2-3 people. Queen size bed and an air mattress. 
Would definitely recommend to friends and family and visit again if I find myself in Seattle again! :-) 
He also allowed us to have a later than normal checkout for our late flight. Sooooo accommodating!!!! 

thanks David! "
1684236,48942246,2015-09-29,44391672,LaShaun,"David's place was EXCELLENT!!!! I was skeptical about renting, however, after reading the other reviews, it made me feel comfortable about my decision. He was everything as all of the previous renters had described. He met us downstairs and escorted in. I immediately felt at home. The view was FANTASTIC!! The place was clean, he provided plenty of towels and extra linen; as the other's stated he welcomed us to anything in his refrigerator. We bought a few groceries and snacks which was a nice option. He gives you a parking pass for free parking and the tenants are very friendly. Due to the easy access of everything I truly look forward to going back just to explore the beautiful Seattle a little more and I hope David's place is available. 
"
1684236,49834639,2015-10-06,44892515,Qinbo,"My friend and I had a pleasant stay at David's house.
His response was always timely. The directions prior to arrival were detailed and clear. The space was exactly as described (even better). The location was perfect, easy access to most attractions. In addition, the view was spectacular. The housing conditions were great. Bedroom, kitchen and bathroom were equipped with everything we need.  Drinks and food in the cabinets and refrigerator were provided for us. There were also books and dvds, though we don't have enough time to enjoy.  If you're looking for a nice place for your travels I would definitely recommend this spot!  :))"
1684236,50440296,2015-10-12,12671893,Jill,"David's space was awesome! The view of the city was very cool. Having a kitchen was perfect as we picked up fish from the market and cooked it back at the apartment. It is the most convenient location to everything- we literally walked everywhere. David left maps and travel booklets of the city for guests. Bed was comfy, lots of pillows :). Definitely recommend staying here, David was a wonderful host. "
1684236,51439617,2015-10-20,31762069,Greg,"Our experience at this location was incredible. This definitely was a 'mi casa es su casa' host. We were greeted with an informative binder filled with entertainment locations and detailed bus and train maps as well as maps of the differ be downtown locations. He informed us of where extra pillows and blankets were, provided a stocked fridge and freezer that we were free to take from (we relaxed with a few delicious beers), and he had a full stocked toiletry cabinet. If there's ever one thing I forget when traveling it's something toiletry related. He had baskets of soaps, disposable razors, shampoos, and more. He also left us with a twenty dollar bus/train card for us to use. We had an incredible vacation in Seattle and one of the main reasons was the comfort and security we felt in our Airbnb "
1684236,52004734,2015-10-25,5179876,Karen,"Everything was just right at David's apt. 
The fact that he allowed us to use anything in his fridge was really thoughtful, so we didn't have to purchase too much milk or too many eggs! Having a transit pass available was a big plus. 
Great location! In Capitol Hill;5 min walk to monorail; 10 min walk to Pike Place Market. 
Not that it was important to us, but the couch wasn't comfortable enough to watch the tv( which was rather high on the wall)."
1684236,54157938,2015-11-16,17624527,David,Everything was as described. Incredibly flexible in working with your schedule and went above and beyond.

The neighborhood is amazing with restaurants, coffee shops, and the University Village shopping center all within walking distance. I would gladly stay here again! "

4589654,28308586,2015-03-22,26737735,Albert,Nice big space for a great price. Not too far of a drive from the heart of Seattle.
4589654,28507832,2015-03-24,29691334,Steve,"We enjoyed the 'main floor' of this house at the edge of a pleasant neighborhood of older homes. The rooms were very comfortable, well supplied and very nicely decorated. A nice feature of this property is the multitude of interesting books available. Ms Brecht was always prompt and complete in communicating. A fair bit of aircraft noise might bother some at night depending on air traffic patterns."
4589654,30155619,2015-04-18,30366743,Charli,"Cute spot. A bit further from downtown Seattle. The house is MUCH bigger than the photographs let on, and our host was very helpful. "
4589654,32651989,2015-05-19,24427210,Anders Piil,"Travelling with our parents can be a challenge and My Mum could not stay at the loca, which I thought was fine. So we left before we use the house. 
Roda was incredible - she gave us a full discount. Service and kindness which I will incorporate into my own flat om Airbnb. 

Thank you Roda - we had a nice time in Seattle - and you have a big honour in that "
4589654,33151694,2015-05-25,7058105,Lainey,"The description is accurate - a sweet home away from home. Roda was quick and responsive, and though we did not meet,  let us check in early to drop our luggage since we had a morning arrival. That was incredibly kind and luxurious.The keycode access was convenient. The neighborhood definitely requires a car or public transit. It is apparent this is a pet-friendly place, (just faint pet smell) but everything was clean and the bathroom was spotless with fresh linens. Overall a great experience, very easy to book and a great base for our Seattle adventure!"
4589654,40058629,2015-07-27,4376120,Nicole,Roda was very kind and sweet over the phone and helpful with all my questions while she hosted me in her lovely house. Thank you so much for making my first experience in Seattle welcoming and easy. Roda is amazing and I would recommend her to everyone.
4589654,45096807,2015-08-31,34934077,Nikki,"The home was lovely, very comfortable, and in a good location to travel around Seattle. Roda was great with helping us to plan our trip and keeping in touch!"
4589654,47111966,2015-09-15,35047500,Bonnie,"Roda has been extremely responsive, always answered my messages almost immediately. Nice, bright, clean and spacious apartment located on a quiet street, around 15-20 minutes drive from downtown Seattle, depending on traffic. The neighbourhood isn't the glitziest part of the city, but we didn't encounter any problem. "
4589654,47449668,2015-09-18,37834263,Cherise,Host was kind and welcoming. We only stayed for a couple nights but it was enjoyable. Easy access into the house but felt bad that my boyfriend and I forgot there are tenants downstairs and were watching the TV very loud the first night. Definitely kept that in mind during the second night and tried to be mindful of being respectful to the long-term tenants. Great price & location though since we were visiting family. Also loved the wine! Thank you Roda!
4589654,48249996,2015-09-24,36394213,Nicholas,"It was clean comfortable and really easy to get to. Roda made everything great, and even threw in a bottle of wine! Great place to stay."
4589654,48941245,2015-09-29,9850161,De'Andre,"What can I say?  My buddies and I were wowed by Roda's place!  To say that it was perfect for our trip to Seattle would be quite the understatement.  From the selection of beds to the warmth of the home and the location, we loved every aspect of our stay.  While the neighborhood may at first appear to be ho hum and maybe not the trendiest, it was quiet and a perfect distance from both the airport (about 15 minutes) and downtown (again... 15 minutes).  The proximity to highways and such was key.  We were in town to see our beloved Chicago Bears play the Seattle Seahawks, and ended up taking an uber to the stadium for next to nothing.  A 15-minute drive (if that).  All in all we had a great time, Roda was available to answer my questions, and the accommodations were as nice as they appears on the site.  This will be our place of choice if/when we come back."
4589654,49526098,2015-10-04,44474435,Ning,"It's really a wonderful house. Everything is perfect. Environment is also good and there are many beautiful adornments in the house. What's more, it's also convenient if we want to go to spots. In conclusion, this house is really a good choice if you want to travel  to Seattle."
4589654,53194157,2015-11-06,3363783,Anette,"Roda's apartment was perfect for us. First off, the location was great, we were working close by at Boeing. The interior is nicely done, the kitchen had all amenities and it was great returning here after a long work day. The place was very clean and communication with Roda and her husband was easy. I can highly recommend this apartment."
4589654,54596430,2015-11-22,7549056,Jim,I have to say Roda's place was nothing less than GREAT.  This old home in a historic neighborhood is so comfortable and convenient it rates A+.  Especially the hospitality Roda & Marvin give.  The little touches in this home make it a very inviting place to stay.  Cleanliness is above & beyond along with an ample supply of consumables to make the stay easy.  If there is another trip to Seattle I will check Roda's availability before checking for a flight.
6714817,36311687,2015-06-27,35111130,Jesse,"Lovely place -  spotless, cozy, and comfortable, with lots of nice sunlight, though it is on a busy, bright street, and so may not be the right place for light sleepers. Cody was super responsive and thoughtful. He even left us travel toothpaste, etc. by the sink!"
6714817,37878387,2015-07-11,35524849,Laura,"Cody was a fantastic host, from the beginning we were able to communicate  effectively about the details of the reservation. He was not able to meet us in person but he had a designated person who opened the door for us right we we arrived.  When we arrived at the apartment, we found  a welcome letter, instructions and recommended places to eat and check out, that provided a very nice touch and were very helpful. The apartment itself was absolutely beautiful, I loved the decor and we found it extremely clean and welcoming. It was very comfortable and the bed was fantastic. We really appreciated having that air conditioning during that heat wave. The neighbourhood is very charming and conveniently located by an Interstate that would take you to downtown in about 10 minutes. Also, within walking distance to Freemont, which has lots of restaurants, shops and the Freemont Troll.  During our stay Cody continued to communicate with us and asked how things were going, we really had the most wonderful time and are truly grateful for the opportunity of staying in such a sweet home.

282934,3768802,2013-03-12,3078354,Amber,"We had an amazing stay at Andra's place! We were in town for the weekend to visit friends and the location was ideal for us. I can't imagine that it wouldn't be for anyone visiting Seattle. Close to downtown, Fremont (literally about 8 blocks) , Ballard, Queen Anne etc. The street itself is very charming and the actual apartment is great! Tastefully decorated, very spacious (nice open layout) with a separated bedroom with a comfy bed. Fully stocked kitchen and nice small touches. (Extra toothbrushes in the bathroom, Q-tips, shampoo etc.) Andra also left fresh coffee beans from a local coffee roaster and a gift certificate for the actual coffee house, as it was located just down the street. Nice personal touch. Andra was great, she checked in with us once we arrived (as she was unable to meet us) and made sure we had everything we needed, also checked before we headed out. I couldn't say more positive things about this apartment, my husband and I are frequent travelers and this is definitely a place that I would highly recommend to anyone! There isn't anything I would have changed about the experience. "
282934,3949139,2013-03-30,2125604,Kyungmin,"I had an excellent stay at Andra's place. Her place was well furnished and decorated so that I feel right at home. The place was located near coffee shops and restaurants, which were only several blocks away. I would definitely choose to stay at her place again next time when I visit. Thanks Andra!"
282934,4151229,2013-04-14,5650746,Kara,"Andra made my first visit to Seattle quite memorable.  She was the perfect hostess - there if you needed her, messages throughout the visit and suggestions on what was happening in Seattle during my stay.  The apartment is gorgeously outfitted and she took care to leave special touches - a gift certificate to the local coffee house, fresh coffee beans/grinder w French press coffee maker, a complimentary bottle of prosecco in the refrigerator for my birthday away from home, extra toiletries and fresh cut flowers on the dining room table.  Thank you so much!!  Anyone who stays at Andra's house will enhance their stay in Seattle. I can't wait to come back in the summer!
Kara"
282934,4681964,2013-05-20,5922450,Dennis,"Our stay at Andra's Fremont guest apartment went off without a hitch. Extremely clean and well equipped with everything we needed.   Quiet neighborhood and lovely sites and restaurants within walking distance.  We would make a ""next time""."
282934,4864004,2013-05-29,6191927,Pam,"Wonderful experience!  Accommodations were excellent with all necessities available.  Close to everything.  Host very kind.
Thanks!"
282934,4964688,2013-06-04,201948,Albrecht,Nice and quiet residential neighborhood. The apartment has lots of space and is recently decorated with all new appliances and cozy atmosphere. Andra is a great host and everything went smoothly. Truly recommended. 
282934,5103447,2013-06-12,6329014,Rachael,I can't say enough great things about Andra's place. Everything was super tidy. There was nothing overlooked. The kitchen had everything one would need to cook (but with so many great restaurants withing walking distance we didn't use it). The bed was very comfortable. The location was super convenient to walk to downtown Fremont. I would definitely stay here again!
282934,5204976,2013-06-18,400363,Susan,"Sophisticated and comfortable apartment in the relaxing Fremont neighborhood. Once the owner's personal apartment, I found everything I needed. It is a walk-in basement apartment, but surprisingly light and bright. Andra has added some thoughtful touches like stamped postcards to send to family and a $5 gift card to the fantastic corner coffee house. On street parking was always available. We spent three days there and will most definitely return."
282934,5298482,2013-06-23,4694594,Jennifer,"Our stay at Andra's apartment was just perfect! We were visiting Seattle for business, but it felt like staying with a friend and living like a local. Andra's attention to detail made our stay so comfortable. The apartment was spacious and included all the comforts of home: dreamy bed, fluffy towels, and toiletries. I almost felt like I over packed. The gift certificate for the coffee shop was most appreciated our first morning out, super cool and really tasty!

Location, location! We had a car and parking was a breeze on the street. The apartment was walking distance to some great restaurants, we highly recommend Via Trubunali pizza. Andra had prepared a binder full of recommendations for everything, from where to eat to what to do in Seattle, complete with maps showing the distance from the apartment. Our only regret is we didn't stay longer. We stayed 4 nights, but could have stayed another week. We'll definitely be back Andra, thanks for everything!

"
282934,5411590,2013-06-29,5956765,Chris,"Andra did a great job of making this place feel like home. She was very responsive during the reservation, check-in, and during the complete stay. She also let us use her washer and dryer on the same floor as the apartment, which was very convenient. The fireplace in the apartment was a great touch and we used it every night. I would highly recommend this apartment for the space, location, value, and owner. When we return to seattle we would love to stay here again. "
282934,5600292,2013-07-08,5940999,Chan,"My wife and I stayed in Andra's apartment during the July 4th weekend and everything was perfectly prepared for us. Bedroom and bathroom was clean, living room was nicely decorated with all we needed. The apartment is really quiet and parking was always available right across the street.
Lots of local information was available on the table, but I regret that I did not have much time to explore those cool places.

I would love to stay here again, and recommend to my friends."
282934,6146362,2013-08-01,5242957,Eric,"My wife and I enjoyed our stay so much, that we didn't want to leave. The apartment was even better in person than it was in the photos. It was incredibly clean with a nice modern decor that still felt home-y and comfortable. That comfort was something I appreciated. Being away from home for 3-weeks on a business trip could have be stressful, but this apartment felt like our home away from home, and allowed us to relax and unwind after long day of work.

Andra was an excellent host - providing the type of hospitality you won't get from a hotel (or most B&Bs for that matter). She had - literally - binders full of great info on things to see and do, and places to eat in the area. She was available when we needed her, and always quick to respond if we had any questions about the apartment.

The location is great. Right around the corner is Lighthouse Coffee Shop - which, in my opinion, has one of the best espressos in the city. Just four or five blocks away on Fremont Ave., between 42nd and 45th Streets are some outstanding restaurants and coffee shops, and nice little grocery store.

Right down the hill is downtown Fremont where you'll find more great restaurants, ice cream, bars, and shops. Fremont has some great tourist attractions too like the Fremont Troll, the Lenin statue, and a Sunday street market.

Public transportation was a breeze. Also right around the corner is the #5 bus stop. This bus will get you to Seattle Center and downtown in about 15 - 20 minutes (depending on traffic and the volume of riders). If you make the short walk to downtown Fremont, there are about five more busses that will get you around to the various neighborhoods of the city.

I would caution that it's very hilly in the area - some of them rather steep. This wasn't too much of an issue for me and my wife, but it's something to prepare for. If you do make the walk from downtown Fremont back to the apartment, I recommend walking up Fremont Ave., as it's less steep than walking up Greenwod or Phinney.

This is definitely a 5-star apartment and location, and I highly recommend it. This will be the first property I check for my next business trip to Seattle."
282934,6365680,2013-08-10,6628678,Jeff And Dre,"Andra’s place…where to begin!?! Clean, new, beautifully done basement apartment (in a safe neighborhood of very nice 100 year old homes on a hilltop – about 10 seconds from the heart of funky, fabulous Fremont!). 
Our hosts were thoughtful - left many personal touches, local publications, items we need yet always manage to forget, tons of area recommendations, yummy local coffee and soy creamer in the fridge. Natural and organic products all around. 
Easy street parking. If I were still a young person living in Seattle I’d be thrilled to make this sweet spot my home! And as much as we want to try new places each year….well, why risk disappointment? We know a good thing 
when we see it, and appreciate, again, the obvious effort and thoughtful attention to details our hosts put into this perfect little hideaway. 
"
282934,6704753,2013-08-22,985494,Eden,"Best. AirBnB. EVER! We've stayed at a few now but this one wins. Andra made it so easy to get access and was super responsive and provided all sorts of extras that made the stay extra easy: maps, coffee, wi-fi, postcards, you name it! The place itself is immaculate and beautiful and the location is fantastic. Paseo's--essentially a national treasure when it comes to pork and sandwiches--is a short stumble away, as is most of Fremont, including the Troll. If you're there on Sunday, you have to take a walk through the nearby market! The zoo--with its jaguar cubs--is also incredibly close. There is also an express bus to whisk you downtown. I wish we could have stayed longer!"
282934,6867491,2013-08-28,6599990,Michael & Kristin,"We stayed at Andra's apartment for three nights, and she was a wonderful host. The apartment was lovely--furnished and laid out very nicely, spacious, clean and well-stocked. Andra provided reusable shopping bags, which were very handy, as well as a fully stocked kitchen and bathroom. She also left a gift certificate to a very good coffe shop around the corner, which was a very thoughtful touch, and provided a binder with info on local restaurants, which was especially useful when we were still a bit jetlagged the first night. The space was great to begin with, but those extra touches are what made the experience so enjoyable. We'd definitely stay here again if we're back in Seattle."
282934,7006206,2013-09-03,2885227,Cody,"My husband and I came to Seattle to visit with family and attend a wedding.  Andra's guest apartment was more than we ever expected.  It was so easy to get into, with her providing easy access.  It is also in a fantastic neighborhood, just blocks from great restaurants and a beautiful zoo.  Having such a peaceful, well equipped apartment made us feel like locals.  The place was immaculate and made us want to buy a second place in Seattle! 

The only thing we would suggest is that it would be difficult without a car.  We were lucky enough to use a family spare, but it might be tough to use public transport to get around in this part of town, although we didn't try very hard. "
282934,7343535,2013-09-16,5237762,Emily,"The apartment was lovely - very quiet and comfortable. We really enjoyed having the full kitchen. It was around the corner from some great shops and cafes. Andra also helpfully provided information on local sites, including a hiking guidebook we used to pick out a place to hike on the weekend. We also appreciated the well-curated list of vegan restaurants in town that Andra had prepared. Overall, we loved our stay and hope to stay again soon."
282934,7460834,2013-09-21,3112682,Nicola,"Anda's place is an absolute dream. I used to host on airbnb and I took pride in paying attention to details and doing little things to make sure my guests had a great place to call home for their visit. Well, Andra's attention to detail put me to shame. Everything is even better than you could hope for. It is beautifully decorated and in a fantastic neighborhood with easy access to public transportation and wonderful coffee shops, restaurants and stores within walking distance. There was a gift card for coffee waiting upon our arrival, pre-stamped postcards on the desk, a selection of helpful guide book including one Andra put together herself, an incredibly comfy bed... the list goes on and on. My boyfriend and I were so happy to have this nest to come home to every night. If ever back in Seattle, we would definitely stay here again! Thank you Andra!"
282934,7850647,2013-10-06,8263378,Lynn,"My husband and I very much enjoyed our stay in the Modern Guest Apartment in the Fremont area of Seattle. Even before we arrived, Andra was helpful with information on how to get there by bus; it worked out perfectly and saved us search time. The apartment lived up to the nice look one sees online. The unit was clean, with everything in good working condition and nice design touches all through; plus quiet and peaceful. We also appreciate that Andra is concerned about the environment. We were encouraged to recycle and her system was explained; there were organic cotton towels in the bathroom etc. We love the Fremont area and we're excited that now we know a place where we can comfortably stay while we explore the area. We will be back!"
282934,8116175,2013-10-16,8725145,Eileen,"Having this cozy apartment as my home base during a recent trip to Seattle was a huge part of what made the visit so great. The place is absolutely lovely and it's clear Andra put a lot of effort into perfecting every last detail (I especially loved the cute pre-stamped postcards—I couldn't resist sending one!). For the eco-conscious traveler, the apartment is well-stocked with many green products, from bathroom toiletries to biodegradable trash liners. The apartment is within walking distance to many of the great restaurants, shops, cafes, and more that Fremont has to offer. Andra was a friendly, considerate, and responsive host throughout the process, and made my first AirBnB experience a great one. I'd recommend this place to anyone looking for a stylish, clean, comfortable, and spacious spot in a vibrant but quiet neighborhood."
282934,8214435,2013-10-21,4955345,Luis Mauro,"Andra is nothing less than stellar. Her attention to detail is impeccable. That paired with her well appointed and tasteful space, you can't go wrong with spending a night here.

And there's coffee.. coffee upon coffee. I definitely recommend and will stay here again should the opportunity arise"
282934,8406853,2013-10-29,3178456,Steven,"After racing on the treadmill of your life for some time and you have the wish to just step off for awhile, not because you don't like your life, but sometimes you just need to do without it all for a brief period of time... to recover...space in your heart and mind. Where would you go? I hesitate to suggest you stop at Andra's place in Fremont, you just might decide to stay! Cozy, comfortable, convenient and centrally located. Minimal (a la Zen) with needed appliances, a comfy bed with exquisite linens and environmentally sensitive cleaning and household supplies throughout. Andra has thought of everything, not in an imposing way but in a way to offer you what you might want to try as an alternative to your habitual way of doing. There is a great note for the forgetful on the inside of the door to the laundry room. You'll have to stay and do a laundry to see it. And there is a great, one-of-a-kind coffee shop just a 3 minute walk over a block and up a block. Real! You can stay but just don't schedule when I want to return!"
282934,8600825,2013-11-07,9274232,Thoa,"Great location, amazing space, Andra is a thoughtful and accommodating hostess. We had everything we needed and extra. Thanks Andra for making our stay in Seattle so memorable!"
282934,8667376,2013-11-11,6664175,William,"Staying at Andra's, the Seattle Sojourn, was such a pleasure, and really made the trip for my girlfriend and I. Upon first arrival, you'll notice spare slippers to use once you get in the door, a wonderful three ring binder detailing everything you need to know about the place, and pamphlets and magazines encouraging you to get out and see Seattle. As a sweet surprise, she also had a gift card for a local coffee shop for us to use, and buss passes. 

This was really a treat, and so very thoughtful. Thanks Andra!"
282934,9140508,2013-12-09,2316057,Jen,Lovely and well-cared for space. Wonderful attention to detail. Enjoyed the location and the neighborhood and the afternoon light. 
282934,9244735,2013-12-16,2478272,Alejandra,"I spent three nights at this amazing place last week. Everything was perfect from arrival to departure time. Beautiful space in a great location. I'll be sure to book this place during my next Seattle visit.  Andra, thank you for being so accommodating."
282934,9727475,2014-01-06,519657,Ken (And Connie),"Its understandable why Andra has such great reviews on Airbnb- she thinks of everything. So many wonderful touches, the place has everything you need, is tastefully decorated and is full of maps, books and magazines about Seattle and Freemont. Highly recommended!
"
282934,10193984,2014-02-05,80897,Stephanie,"My partner and I live in Seattle in the summers and know the neighborhoods well.  We needed a place to stay for a special family event and our own place was being repaired.  You will be very happy if you stay in Andra's beautiful, well-designed apartment in Freemont  Everything you could possibly need, she has provided in the apartment and the neighborhood is full of great food, excellent coffee and strolling.  Don't miss Rock Creek for dinner and Lighthouse Coffee for delicious cardamom and banana bread.  

Andra was very responsive to all my questions and was a great host.  We would stay there again in a heartbeat.  "
282934,10294968,2014-02-11,11020851,Marty,"This is a lovely place in a wonderful neighborhood. Extremely well-appointed with everything you need, plus more. Andra's attention to detail and her extra touches such as French Press coffee and coffee gift card outdid even our favorite spot in Paris! We walked up and down many hills exploring neighborhoods, parks, good food and coffee shops. Fremont is very walkable and the bus downtown stops just 1-1/2 blocks away. Thanks Andra!"
282934,10365309,2014-02-16,7723732,Polly,"I want to live at Andra's place. She thinks of every little detail- start to finish. Very well stocked with everything you need. Full-size fridge, oven, stove, microwave. Stocked with the best coffee in Seattle, plus a gift card to that same coffee place! The apartment is super clean and well organized. Extra bathroom supplies are provided. She also has lots of info about things to do and places to eat. There are Seattle magazines with more information as well. I will definitely try to stay here again!"
282934,10880415,2014-03-11,4302263,Zac,"I would not hesitate to rent from Andra again. The apartment is clean, centrally located and on a clear day you can see the mountains!

Parking can be tricky, but that's Seattle for you. 

There is nothing lacking in this apartment. Nothing at all. Andra gave expert advice on where to go hiking, where to eat, where NOT to eat which took our trip from being an A to an A+.

I'm looking forward to our next trip to Seattle so that we can stay here again.

Do yourself a favor and book this little gem. 

(Oh, by the way, the kitchen is fully stocked with anything you would need to make a gourmet meal from ingredients you gather from Pikes Place or the grocery store that is just a mile away..shame we didn't have time to take advantage of that with all the great dining options within walking distance of the apartment!).

"
282934,11053110,2014-03-18,8491457,Julie,"Our 5-night stay in Andra's apartment was an unexpected and significant addition to pleasurable memories of our most recent Seattle trip to visit family! Andra's attention to detail is remarkable, from impeccable cleanliness to placement of furniture, rugs and artifacts, to numerous and well-designed clothes hangars! The place was wonderfully designed, light and airy thanks to well-placed windows, recessed lights, and rheostats. Each room could not have been more thoughtfully furnished or functionally equipped: 

Everything in the kitchen was thoughtfully well-organized and intuitively  accessible—nothing was needed that wasn't right at hand. The bathroom is spacious, beautifully lit—a ""real room""—with wonderful paint and tile colors, and more lovely towels than two people could ever use. The bedroom may have the most comfortable bed and bedding I've ever slept in! Closets and dresser were well-placed, attractive and roomy. Bountiful books and magazines offered various perspectives and guidance on Seattle's many resources; even a beautifully-designed set of boxed cards detailed Seattle landmarks...to be shared on a comfy, attractive couch. 

So often, home-away-from-home is simply to be endured, and leaves much to be desired; by contrast, Andra's place was not just a space in which to sleep, but also a place in which to enjoy preparing and sharing a meal, reading mid-day, or sitting comfortably, listening to music while writing home.

Andra's consideration really extends to every aspect of providing a thoroughly functional and very attractive home for her guests. Her welcome and communication are responsive, clear, and timely, but not in the least intrusive. There is no feeling that one must adapt as a guest to living in someone else's home—not a feeling we like when traveling; instead, Andra has gone out of her way to provide a home that feels in every detail as though it's YOURS! 

I felt ""at home"" enough, in fact, to forget my hat when we left; Andra was quick to send a message welcoming me to stop by for it if we hadn't left town. She left it on her house porch at my request...wrapped in lavender tissue paper in a small bag, like a gift. Another small but significant detail.

Andra is, in my opinion, an ideal host, and I am delighted to give her apartment the highest recommendation possible. My son owns a business in Seattle with clients and collaborators from Asia through the US to Europe. He has Seattle visitors. My husband showed him ""our"" apartment; my fear now is that on a subsequent visit to Seattle myself, someone may already have booked what I quickly came to feel was My Place!"
282934,11286804,2014-03-28,6182266,Brent,"Andra was a gracious host, and her guest apt was the perfect retreat to decompress after very long work days. The space is immaculate as the photos suggest, spacious, yet cozy at the same time. For a basement apartment it has an abundance of natural light. Wifi worked well, and I needed it to perform as business creeped into the evenings. I never had to adjust the thermostat. Climate was perfect. I intentionally took the train to Seattle, so I would have to get around on foot. That allowed me to explore the neighborhood and dine locally. It was a treat. I wouldn't hesitate staying here again. Five stars!"
282934,11683097,2014-04-12,12064241,Anne,"Andra set a high standard for our first Airbnb experience that will be hard to top for our next hosts.  We were thrilled with the accommodations--fresh, clean, cozy, tastefully decorated, and thoughtfully furnished.  We were welcomed by a chilled bottle of champagne and a refrigerator stocked with just enough of the necessities to get us through our first morning.  Most importantly of all, the bed was comfortable, affording us a good night's sleep which allowed us to rise feeling rested and ready for another fun day in Seattle.  The neighborhood not only felt safe, it had a friendly feel and finding on-street parking was never a problem.  In the future, we'll definitely plan our Seattle visits around the availability of Seattle Sojourn.  We wouldn't want to stay anywhere else!"
282934,12078528,2014-04-22,9711463,Michael,"We stayed at Andra's place last December.  When we came back to Seattle in April it was the first place we looked for.  No more needs saying but:  Her description is accurate.  Her accommodation is comfortable, quiet and very well equipped. "
282934,12667615,2014-05-07,14304184,Alan,I had a very enjoyable stay at Andra's apartment. It had everything I needed and more. Great value and a handy location. Will definitely look to stay there next time I'm in Seattle.
282934,12893306,2014-05-13,14100439,Taylor,"What can we say about the Seattle Sojourn and Andra that hasn't already been said?! The space is fantastic. Nice, large living and kitchen area fully equipped with everything you need to kick up your feet and relax. The bathroom was nicer than most hotels, with extra linens and any toiletries you may have forgotten. The bedroom provided plenty of closet space and a large, comfortable bed. We felt right at home- only my house is not as clean or as nicely decorated! Andra went above and beyond in providing us with recommendations and suggestions in the Seattle area. She was very easy to communicate with and graciously walked us through the AirBNB process (as we were first timers). She was even so thoughtful as to leave us a coffee gift card we could use right around the corner! Fremont is a fantastic neighborhood and we really feel like we hit the jackpot in renting Andra's space. We HIGHLY RECOMMEND Andra and her accommodations!!  "
282934,13140076,2014-05-20,7803635,Jon,"Andra was a great host - helpful when needed but otherwise leaving us free to do our thing.  She provided plenty of helpful books and magazines for planning our outings.  The neighborhood is relaxing, beautiful, central to other neighborhoods, and walking distance to a bunch of great bars and restaurants."
282934,13505979,2014-05-29,4366788,Shaun,"Andra's apartment was lovely and perfect for our trip! It is located in a very cute neighborhood and easy to access different parts of the city.The apartment itself was immaculate, comfortable and had everything we needed. I appreciated the small touches, like nice soaps, a compost container, helpful books and magazines about the city, and all of her amazing vegan suggestions. I highly recommend and would definitely come back."
282934,14270000,2014-06-16,7723732,Polly,This was my second time staying at Andra's place. It was just as wonderful as the first. I highly recommend! 
282934,14692832,2014-06-24,11297381,Kevin,"Our stay with Andra was wonderful.  The apartment is beautiful, large and comfortable.  Three different friends we were traveling with, staying at other places nearby, commented on how nice it was when they came by to give us rides.  Everything you could possibly need was provided from kitchen to bath, including some extra toiletries you might have forgotten.

The amount of thought and attention Andra has paid to the apartment and her guests is clear.  There was a large amount of helpful information about Fremont and the rest of Seattle in the form of guestbook, brochures, magazine, maps, etc.  Her communication prior to our arrival was excellent. She greeted us when we arrived and made sure we got in OK, and then pretty much left us alone, though there was no question she would have been easily available had we needed something.

The apartment is in a great, quiet, friendly neighborhood.  Fremont is a cool area, and it's easy to take the bus downtown to popular destinations like Pike Place Market, etc.  We found it convenient to walk and bus most places we needed to go, but the hill from the apartment down to the part of Fremont where the restaurants and shops is is no joke, though we managed to make it fine many times.  The hill to the bus stop that takes you downtown isn't too bad though, but, in general, it felt like everything in Seattle is uphill both ways, so be prepared if you plan to do a lot of walking anywhere in Seattle.

We loved our time in Seattle and staying at Settle Sojourn made it even better.  We definitely hope to stay there again."
282934,14988825,2014-06-30,10124366,Kailai,"We were really surprised by how nice Andra's place is! It's the most beautiful AirBnB we stayed in so far. We really loved the neighborhood as well, maybe even more so than downtown Seattle. Andra was kind enough to offer us Seattle traveling tips and metro cards, they are great help! The kitchen is well equipped and the overall place is very well decorated!"
282934,15448222,2014-07-09,14843916,Marla,"This apartment was wonderful. It had everything that an excellent rental apartment should have, plus more. The host was very helpful, providing information about nearby restaurants, sites, bus transportation, and written instructions for the apartment. The neighborhood is attractive and appealing. The walk north from the Fremont waterway is a steep hill that isn't evident on maps, so plan for a challenging hike or riding the bus!"
282934,15774260,2014-07-15,16881578,Eddie,"We had a wonderful 5 night stay at Andra’s Seattle Sojourn in the Fremont neighborhood of Seattle in July of 2014.  Andra was a perfect hostess, accommodating and available.  The apartment is completely private, fully stocked with everything we could need, and impeccably clean and well decorated.  

Some of our favorite touches included: equipment and ingredients to make a great cup of coffee (plus a $5 gift certificate to the local coffee shop around the corner), a welcome bowl of rainier cherries (yum!), numerous helpful guidebooks and magazines to help plan our activities, Andra’s own list of recommended restaurants and shops within walking distance, and Orca transit cards to help with getting around the city.  We loved staying in the beautiful Fremont neighborhood and enjoyed a peaceful walk to breakfast every morning before venturing into downtown Seattle.  The bus stop to take you downtown is less than a five minute walk from the apartment so we really couldn’t have gotten a better “best of both worlds” situation.  

We would highly recommend Seattle Sojourn for your next AirBnB experience in the Seattle area and will definitely be repeat guests if we venture that way again in the future."
282934,16269423,2014-07-24,343432,Andrea,"I had a wonderful experience at the Seattle Sojourn, thanks to an impeccable apartment and a terrific host. The apartment has everything you need and more, thanks to Andra's furnishing, care, and helpful tips on how to not only enjoy Seattle but also get quickly up to speed with local logistics. A+ "
282934,16676506,2014-07-31,17735304,Tiffany,It was a wonderful place just right outside of downtown Seattle with a wonderful host that's close by only if needed. Close to everything but still far away. It was a great private place at the end of the day to go to rather than a hotel room. It felt like a home away from home. I would stay there again!! 
282934,16987064,2014-08-05,16755072,Terry,"Everything is there that you can imagine, glasses, pots, hair dryers, hangers, etc. etc. You shouldn't have to worry about anything you might have missed or need on your trip."
282934,17508498,2014-08-13,13032653,Emily,"We had a wonderful stay in Andra's Fremont apartment. The house is perfectly located in Fremont within walking distance to so many awesome restaurants. The apartment itself was amazing. It's just the right amount of space with everything you could possibly need and it's in pristine condition. She included so many thoughtful details, like restaurant suggestions, a gift card to the coffee shop around the corner, orca transportation cards to use during the stay, and prestamped postcards! Andra was an excellent communicator leading up to our stay (even checking in to see if we'd like milk or cream for our coffee when we arrived!). She made our first stay in Seattle so comfortable! It really allowed us to feel like locals and picture what it's like to live in the area. I would highly recommend this stay to anyone looking to visit Seattle!"
282934,20601270,2014-10-02,7723732,Polly,I've stayed at Andra's place several times and it's always a pleasure. Everything you could possible need or want she's thought of. I highly recommend!
282934,20962236,2014-10-08,8491457,Julie,"My husband and I stayed for a second time at Andra's Seattle Sojourn apartment while visiting family who live in Ballard. Our visit was five nights long, and we were as fond of the place and of Andra's consistent thoughtfulness and generous hospitality as we were during our first stay (see my previous review). This time, we were treated to comforting beverages (craft beer AND wine!), in addition to milk to start our day before we could food shop. Our small granddaughter—very curious about where we were staying—took one look at our exceedingly comfortable bed, and declared that it looked ""so comfy that I want to climb into it."" We enjoyed breakfast each day at the round table, happy to know that Andra has provided everything needed to make food prep and meals easy and pleasurable. Knowing this from our first stay, we had looked forward to inviting family over for dinner, but due to their plans that will have to wait for our next visit.

On this trip, I was in the throes of migrating from my mobile phone to a slightly newer one of my son's, and was in techno-misery, failing to restore full function to either phone. As a result, I was unable to notify Andra of our timing in checking out, and hope we didn't inconvenience her. Gracious as always, she left a clear and kind voice mail in late afternoon to check whether we'd left, assuring us that she'd wait a couple of hours before entering the apartment. Above and beyond considerate! Many thanks, Andra...I finally was able to access your message when we got home to the east coast!"
282934,23282234,2014-11-27,3228594,Mary,"Andra has done an amazing job renovating and decorating her basement apartment located in one of the most desirable and trendy neighborhoods of Seattle. The apartment was clean, quiet, and fully stocked with everything you need to live comfortably for an extended time. For me, the organic towels and cleaning supplies were an added touch for my allergies and green lifestyle. Andra also provides a notebook with nearby coffee shops (walking distance) and local vegan restaurants. Thank you, Andra, for a wonderful stay! You're a gracious and thoughtful host."
282934,23975075,2014-12-15,9899478,Roman,"The host lives directly above the apt. and the laundry room is apparently shared access - although we didn't actually need to use it.

The apt looked fantastic - as good or better than in the photographs. Andra was very attentive to us as we arrived, providing everything we needed to know - everything was perfect.

We had a rental car and parking next to the apt was fairly painless - always a parking spot within 200 meters."
282934,25747685,2015-01-25,24135527,Patrick,"My stay at the Seattle Sojourn was an incredible experience. The apartment was clean, comfortable, and stocked with everything I needed. Andra was a great host, too. Even though we didn't get many chances to run into each other, I was well taken care of. Andra provided a ""mini-clean"" halfway into my two-week stay and left the apartment immaculate. She also provided excellent recommendations for the Fremont area and even a gift card to a nearby coffee shop. Street parking was convenient and the apartment was in a great area near plenty of restaurants, groceries, etc. I would very highly recommend the Seattle Sojourn!"
282934,26362714,2015-02-10,8491457,Julie,"My husband and I have stayed in Andra's wonderful apartment a number of times, (see reviews), always appreciating her warmth,  thoughtfulness and the impeccable condition of her lovely place. This time was unique in that I fell ill during our stay, for which I felt very apologetic! No one likes feeling awful away from home, but I could not have been more comfortable anywhere than tucked in at SeattleSojourn! Thanks, Andra, for your graciousness and recuperative energy! We hope to see you soon again, under healthier circumstances!"
282934,26744039,2015-02-18,16550979,Jennifer,"There's really nothing I can say that hasn't already been said by all the previous reviewers. The place was perfect, exactly as described with everything we needed and in a great neighborhood. I would go back again & again. Andra was very accommodating, helpful - and only around when we needed her. :) It's a total steal and felt like home."
282934,28982541,2015-04-02,25096058,Carolyn,"I could not have asked for a better experience.  Andra is a wonderfully thoughtful host.  I appreciated all the little details like a local IPA for my beer loving self, the locally sourced and organic essentials and even pre-stamped postcards.  The apartment is beautifully furnished and the bed and linens are super comfy. I forgot something at the apartment and Andra graciously offered to drop it off at my local office.  Beyond the call of duty for sure!

As far a the location, I'm a former Seattleite that comes back to town for work quite a bit and can't think of a better location.  You have access to so many great neighborhoods on foot, by bus or by car.  I had no issue finding parking either.  Seriously guys, this was such a great place I almost don't want to tell you how great so that I can have it all to myself when I return!"
282934,29573069,2015-04-09,29524,Soo Hyun/Vicki,"We enjoyed Seattle Sojourn very much!  The space was beautiful - spacious yet cozy at the same time.  Very clean, and nicely appointed.  We had everything we needed and more, and we wanted to stay in some of the time just to enjoy the space and cook our own meals.  It was also very conveniently located, and most places we went to were no farther than 15 minutes away by car, and we see now that we would've been fine without one too.  Sweet neighborhood, and Andra made us feel very welcome.  "
282934,30454319,2015-04-22,29238394,Andy,"Seattle Sojourn is an excellent lodging. The host was very flexible with a late arrival. Welcoming aspects included printed signs and instructions posted around the rooms, helpful but not intrusive. There were complimentary snacks and some basic food amenities (good coffee, tea and ale), in a kitchen that had all the appliances we needed (actually more). The bed, bath and laundry facilities were likewise all that we could have hoped for. As nice as the pictures posted on the website make it look, it's even better!"
282934,31336799,2015-05-04,6259860,Debbie & Frank,"This is the gold standard for AirBNB experiences. Everything was very clean, comfortable and well thought-out. Andra has thought of everything down to the smallest details, without going to excess.

Located about a 5 min walk to cafes and restaurants and 10 min to the busier commercial area of the neighborhood, you have all the good stuff without the noise. A great cafe is 2 min away, as is a bus stop. (The bus takes you downtown in about 15 min, and runs every 20-30 min.) As you get into a really comfortable and solid bed at night, you can hear a pin drop. We've never slept this well when visiting larger cities.

Andra was also great when it came to communicating everything about the place and Seattle as a whole, in a very timely manner, and only as much as you wanted to know. She let you know she was there to help, but was never intrusive. 

We've been traveling constantly over the last 3 years all over the world, and this is by far the best place we've ever stayed."
282934,32609793,2015-05-19,6454410,Edward,"I'm pretty much going to repeat what all the other wise reviewers have said--- this apartment and it's host are perfect.  Andra's friendliness and attention to detail for her guests are unmatched.  
The apartment is private, quiet, VERY, VERY clean and well appointed with such care and comfort it was difficult to leave.  
Andra was wonderful and ready with great suggestions and tips for a first-time Seattle visitor.
Will definitely return!"
282934,35131900,2015-06-15,7723732,Polly,"Many people in their evaluations of Airbnbs comment that it was great place and they would stay there again on a future trip.  Well, I've actually done that now several times at Andra's place! I think that says it all. It is my first choice in Seattle. Her place is always super clean, well organized and has everything I need. She is the perfect host and I highly recommend her place!"
282934,36013706,2015-06-24,20271366,Lois,"Our host made a contact with us right away after the reservation was confirmed and continued to be available by email and text.  The lodging was exactly as described, if not better.  Every detail was attended to there.  The location was excellent for us and the host even gave up her parking space for us to make our stay more convenient.  We really appreciated that."
282934,36780349,2015-07-01,32795153,Nicholas,"Sojourn Seattle was exactly what my wife and I needed for our vacation. The apartment space was modern, clean, and superbly furnished--a case study in attention to detail. The full kitchen and laundry made our stay so much more pleasant, as we were able to cook a few of our own meals and immediately wash our clothes after long outdoor activities. Andra met us early when we arrived and gave us a thorough introduction to the Freemont area and tips for getting around. Prior to our arrival Andra compiled a list of activity recommendations via email, many of which we explored. A helpful handcrafted guidebook in the living room area directed us to many delicious restaurants and coffee shops within walking distance of Sojourn. She placed a few local treats in the fridge, much to our surprise and delight--just a bit of icing on the hospitality cake."
282934,42812859,2015-08-16,6628678,Jeff And Dre,"Because our first stay two years ago was so wonderful, we knew we'd be back. They absolutely SPOIL YOU here! No detail is overlooked - everything you might need in the kitchen and bath, special items just for us, organic snacks, EXCELLENT bed and pillows, buttery sheets, CLEAN (which we especially appreciate)...thank you so much! We can't wait to return."
282934,44304442,2015-08-25,3074400,Leah,"I was impressed with how clean and organized Andra's place was. She had notes and instructions posted to eliminate guesses on how to use everything. Her guest book with area restaurants came in very handy. 

Andra also was very responsive to answering questions and providing directions. I would highly recommend her place."
1175308,6278520,2013-08-06,6921570,Rachael,"Myself, my husband and our 3 year old son stayed in this house for 2 and a half weeks.  We had a very enjoyable time there! We helped mind the owners chickens who were very cute and we enjoyed being able to collect fresh eggs from them every day.  The house is located in a very friendly and nice part of Ballard and it is withing walking distance of some lovely parks.  A favourite of ours was Salmon Bay park as there is a big sandpit there which our son loved.  The house is also within walking distance of Market Street where there are some lovely shops and restaurants. Ballard Market is definitely a must on the weekend too!  All in all we had a lovely stay :-) and the Davidson's were very helpful and welcoming!
"
1175308,6614334,2013-08-19,6672388,Paul,"My wife & I enjoyed our stay immensely.  The ""free breakfasts"" were fresh & exceptional (they had 4 chickens that furnished 2 Jumbo eggs daily).  Our 4 year old grand daughter visited, daily, to play in the back yard & got excited with equipment & chicks.  

Hope to visit again!"
1826155,9801604,2014-01-11,4392785,Miaoxin,"their rooms are clean and warm, it's really convenient to live here because the area is safe and there is bus stop right next to the house. host family also gave us complimentary breakfast with fresh fruit and fresh daily baked stuff. I got sick one day they even got me medicines. it's a really good place to stay for any reasons !!"
1826155,10667104,2014-03-02,3671781,Cynthia,"Love this place and Melissa and Abil were great! From the moment we walked in the door they helped us feel at home. They helped us find our way around Seattle from entertainment, to places to eat and shop. There home was so comfortable, and they had a great way of helping us to feel at ease and welcome in the space. Melissa also spoiled us with a wonderful baked treat every morning ..a different one every day..along with fresh fruit and coffee!
I would definitely recommend this spot to others, and stay again when I am in Seattle."
1826155,11253367,2014-03-26,6555024,Esther,"Melissa & Abil were the perfect airbnb hosts. They had the most amazing baked goods and fresh fruits everyday & were absolute gems to stay with. I would definitely stay with them again. Their place were filled with the most amazing art deco & close to the buses downtown. I cannot have more praises for them. They were the loveliest people ever: full of knowledge and tips for Seattle. Also, their cats are the cutest x"
1826155,11617906,2014-04-09,12775436,Kathryn,We stayed in the Sweet Suite and the Arty Cedar Room which is where I left my review.  LOVED THIS PLACE and our hostess too!!!
1826155,12769198,2014-05-10,15195643,Kathryn,"Boyfriend and I ended up booking this room as a result of a last minute adventure to Seattle and we were just looking for a place to crash but Melissa and Abil ensured that staying with them was one of the highlights of our trip. The house was beautifully decorated, warm and inviting and the room itself was gorgeous with an extremely comfortable bed. Everything was clean and well looked after and our hosts from the get go were extremely lovely and hospitable. The continental breakfast in the morning was such a treat and the location of the house was perfect for walking around and exploring the city. The neighbourhood is charming and surrounded by cool places to eat or drink. We returned at the end of many hours of exploring in the rain to cold beer and great conversation around the kitchen table and couldn't imagine a better way to end a day. Will definitely be recommending this listing to friends and have placed it on the top of my ""places to stay"" list for Seattle."
1826155,13196600,2014-05-21,13783170,Izzy,"The house: Beautiful. The room: Top notch. The assistant(Jenna): The coolest. The hosts: Amazing, energetic, wonderful, and any other synonym to those words. Melissa and Abil  were spectacular hosts. My boyfriend and I enjoyed every second of our stay in Seattle. Most of the reason our stay was so great was because of these two amazing women. Melissa baked the best pastries for breakfast (ask for her awesome Banana nut muffins). Abil knows everything there is to know about beer, and she even had some there for us to taste and discuss, which was AWESOME! We weren't too sad to leave Seattle, these two ladies have earned a spot in our lives and this is not the last time we will be staying with them. I can guarantee your stay at Bed, Baked, and Beyond will be memorable.

1826155,13360673,2014-05-26,5440727,Lena,"Melyssa and Abil were the best hosts we've stayed with so far: super friendly, open and funny! We had a great time in Seattle and fell in love with this city partly because we got to meet such wonderful people as Melissa and Abil!
The Victorian style house that we stayed at had it's vibe and character: our room was very neat and clean with a huge king size bedroom. The breakfast every morning was so delicious that we couldn't get enough: every day freshly made pastries along with fruits and berries. Melissa and Abil were very knowledgeable about what is going on in the city, and thanks to them we were able to get to the local summer fest - FolkLife! Awesome experience in Seattle thanks to Melissa's and Abil's hospitality! Thank you ladies! Will miss you and Seattle! Cheers from California!"
1826155,13698368,2014-06-02,9350747,Cat,"First of all, the accommodations:  Very charming and comfortable.  Melissa and Abil's home was so lovely and inviting.  You can see that they love their home and enjoy sharing it.  Our room was just as listed and the bed was very comfortable. There are area's throughout the home to kick back and read , lounge or even entertain guests. It was great to be in an established neighborhood with anything you could want within walking distance (or a short ride away if you don't care to walk).  We easily walked First Hill, Capital Hill and Downtown.
Now for the hosts:  Melissa and Abil make the experience of staying in their home- priceless.  They make you feel invited and care for you as though you are friends.  You can tell that these two women want to make your experience in their home the best it can be.  I would recommend this listing to anyone."
1826155,15277931,2014-07-06,12230622,Alice,"We had a wonderful time at Melissa and Abil's home! They are really nice and help you for everything, they think about everything. There home is very comfortable, nothing is missing. It's clean and you have a wonderful breakfast.
Very good price-quality ratio!
I would definitely recommend this place, and stay again if I come back to Seattle."
1826155,15450597,2014-07-09,2205155,Hong,"We really enjoyed our stay at Melissa and Abel's beautiful house.  They were extremely friendly, helpful, accommodating, and professional.  Melissa's muffins are to die for!  Yummy!  We will definitely stay there again.  Highly recommended."
1826155,15908898,2014-07-18,15268432,Becky,"How many ways can you say ""fabulous!"" The room was very comfy and quiet, the Wi-Fi strong, the linens of high quality, and cleanliness top-of-the-line. The Victorian house had both a parlor and living room where guests can stretch out, plus a front porch AND a lovely backyard with plenty of seating where we could enjoy idle evenings. The hosts assembled a great Continental breakfast--the fruit was always at its peak ripeness and Melissa's muffins, scones, and apple turnovers were beyond delicious. We were impressed by the hosts' hospitality and generosity. The free Pike Brewery craft beer in the fridge was a topper! The location of this B&B was ideal for us--it's between Jefferson and Cherry, two main arteries for bus lines. With the frequent buses and Car2Go, we had no problem getting around the city. We highly recommend a stay here!!! "
1826155,16084123,2014-07-22,12616983,Laura,"Abil And Mélissa are amazing and so
Nice. The place is very clean And cute. Every morning we had Home made muffins which were so yummy :) And on a sunny day you can enjoy the patio. If you need any tips about the city Abil And Mélissa will always kindly Help you. Thank you Abil And Mélissa, we truly enjoyed our stay in Seattle. "
1826155,16309779,2014-07-25,5685600,Jennifer And Loren,"We had so much fun with Abil and Melissa!  They were great hosts and really made us feel like we were visiting friends.  They were available for questions and recommendations, but we were also able to enjoy the space privately when we wanted.  

The fridge was stocked with beer from Abil's brewery and Melissa made us a delicious breakfast every morning.  We are tea drinkers and they made the tea to order and even had tea cozies for the pots, so it stayed hot throughout breakfast.  They created a very social environment and we got to chat with some of the other guests during breakfast if we all happened to make it down at the same time.  

The home is beautifully decorated, but comfortable.  We stayed in their suite.  The home has a vintage feel, but the bathroom had been recently remodeled and felt very new and clean while retaining the vintage charm.  The bed was soooo comfortable and we got a great night's sleep each night.  

The location is very convenient.  There was a parking space in the driveway for our car, so we didn't have to worry about getting a parking ticket.  It is about a 40 minute walk to downtown, so on a nice day that is very doable.  The are about one block from a bus stop which runs directly to downtown or you can take a cab or Ubercar for $5-10 depending on where you are going.

Abil and Melissa have created an airbnb venue that really feels like a B&B, more so than a lot of other venues where we have stayed.  We would definitely recommend staying there.  You'll get to meet a lot of friendly, open-minded people.

"
1826155,16737483,2014-08-01,17217100,Meghan,"Our stay with Melissa and Abil could not have been any better. From the delicious breakfast treats to great conversation to the clean and comfortable accommodations, this was the perfect place for our visit to Seattle. "
1826155,16986644,2014-08-05,14456238,Jae + Kodiak,"Step into Melissa and Abil's one-of-a-kind home and you will be transported back decades in time. The home they have lovingly and artistically put together is an experience not to be missed! Every room is a treasure with ornate details to drool over and antiques to admire. 

This place should really be advertised as a B&B, and is a steal considering the price you pay and the experience. You get to greet each day with bright, energetic women serving you delicious, homemade (and gluten-free, if desired) breakfast. When we needed ideas of great night spots, they not only gave us fantastic recommendations, but they even called up the place to see who was playing that night. 

These are the kind of folks that won't hesitate to go the extra mile to make your experience the best it can be. You even end up wanting to skip your travel plans to just hang out with these rad ladies :) 

The Sweet Suite in particular was a bed for queens. We actually slept the best we had in months on those fluffy, cloud-like pillows. It was really nice to have a private bathroom: modern plumbing with a super cool, original, antique sink.  The windows gave us a lovely breeze at night and was quiet enough it didn't keep us awake.

Quite frankly, after staying with Melissa and Abil, we felt inspired to step up our own Airbnb game and it would be a loss for anyone not to stay with them! "
1826155,17167199,2014-08-08,17920695,Anna,Melissa and Abil were wonderful hosts! Charming home in a quiet neighborhood but only a short walk/bus ride to Capitol Hill or Downtown. I was in town on business and definitely preferred the homemade breakfasts and warm company in their home to a hotel. The Sweet Suite was very clean and comfortable and a great place to come back to after a long day.  
1826155,17509435,2014-08-13,14370809,Sarah,"Melissa and Abil were fantastic hosts, truly meeting the ""beyond"" in their ""Bed, Bath, and Beyond"" slogan. Not only was the house lovely: antique furnishings blended with funky modern accents; breakfast consisted of a freshly baked muffin, a different one daily. Pike Street Brewery beers filled the fridge, courtesy of Abil, Pike Street Brewery tour guide and shipping goddess. YUM! and AHHHH!, respectively. Both women offered great advice for local eateries and tourist spots and even provided packing materials for some of our fragile stuff. Lovely garden, hip urban neighborhood, and convenience to downtown make this B & B a wonderful vacation escape. Five ++++ stars, ladies. We feel like we've made some new friends, and hope to return again soon!"
1826155,17778474,2014-08-17,18808487,Hiram,"Sheltered by a long grown cedar, gently curved steps welcome you through the lacy blue screen door to your home for now. The warm embracing welcome from Melissa and Abil help root you to this new place of wonder.
They greet you each day with warm muffins and smiles while you chat with other guests,and there is always a beer in the fridge.
They are there if you need visitor guidance but also respect your private time and space.
Two awesome women with a wonderful home away for your visit."
1826155,17965843,2014-08-19,17736970,Jennifer,Melissa and Abil were both very warm and welcoming. The room was clean and felt very private and the breakfast Melissa made was delicious. They were accommodating with our earlier check in and check out time and gave us plenty of suggestions of activities in the area. I definitely recommend others to stay here.
1826155,18472077,2014-08-27,16067342,Karen,"I previously wrote a review for the ""Cedar Tree"" room and the whole wonderful experience of staying in Melissa and Abil's delightful home. The ""Sweet Suite"" was a great room. Wonderful new private bathroom and a very comfortable bed. Much attention was obviously given to each detail. "
1826155,18875523,2014-09-02,16107215,Matt,"An absolute pleasure. I had such a great time with Melissa and Abil. They have a beautiful home, amazing breakfast foods, and a cat an earthquake couldn't wake up. The location is a perfect distance from downtown and the room is extremely comfortable. I wouldn't think of staying anywhere else in seattle."
1826155,19134318,2014-09-07,10900367,Kim,"Wow! We had the best time at Melissa and Abil's place, the Sweet Suite. The house is so beautiful and has a really unique and awesome character. The room was also very very nice and the king-size bed is the softest; the private bathroom was very clean with plenty of towels and the shower has great pressure and heat. We enjoyed some time hanging out in the back shed which was very comfortable and a great place to kickback. 

The location is very central and it was a short and cheap lyft/uber ride to wherever we ventured. Public transit is also available close by and seems pretty easy. 

Our hosts, Melissa and Abil were incredibly kind, warm, welcoming and so so cool! We went to see Abil's brewery tour at Pike Brewing Co which was very educational and super fun. Melissa's fresh-baked pastries and fruit plate breakfasts were an awesome way to start the day! They are truly great folks and it was really nice to talk to them throughout the day about our trip. I would definitely recommend this place to friends and would love to come back and visit again!"
1826155,19467518,2014-09-13,12133271,Enrique,"Melissa and Abil were great hosts. They made me feel very comfortable and always had muffins and fruit out every morning for breakfast. They have great insight on what's going on in their city and offer great suggestions to their guests.  They're place is clean, bright, and cozy. It feels more like a B&B. Also, Abil always has a great selection of beers from the pike brewing company.  I would definitely stay here again and recommend for anyone who are looking for gracious hosts, to stay here.  I promise you won't be disappointed."
1826155,19753877,2014-09-17,21064485,Amy,"We enjoyed everything about our stay. The room was very cozy with a very comfortable bed. The adjoining bath was nicely done and provided everything we needed.
Our hosts, Melissa and Abil made us feel right at home - just like part of the family.
We loved our breakfast every morning. The fruit plate was beautiful and delicious and the baked goods were outstanding. 
The neighborhood is very nice. It felt friendly and safe. And was very close to places we needed to be.
Will definitely come back and I've already recommended this to friends."
1826155,20306707,2014-09-27,14485230,Rachael And Eric,"Arriving at Melissa and Abil's beautiful home was like coming home, or more accurately, how I WISH it felt to come home.  Both Abil and Melissa were so warm and welcoming; it felt like visiting old friends.  Their home is beyond beautiful and has more then we could have wanted.  The bed was the BEST!  Cannot say enough about this experience.  We can't wait to come back and stay with Melissa and Abil again!"
1826155,20621005,2014-10-02,20373863,Deanna,"What an amazing experience we had in the Sweet Suite Cherry Hill! The house was great... close to everything, clean, beautiful & comfy but the hosts are the real hidden gems :) Melissa & Abil were so inviting, warm & helpful, they made you feel like you lived there. The neighborhood was easy to navigate with a lot of restaurants, pubs & shops within walking distance. Downtown is a short car ride away and transit looked like it was pretty easy to get around. We will definitely be repeat guests in this charming guest home!"
1826155,22590978,2014-11-10,7027331,Jessica,"What a spectacular stay!  From beginning to end, our time at the ""Sweet Suite"" was perfect.  We were talking about our return visit well before we left.  We were immediately greeted and given a tour of this beautiful turn of the century home.  Everything - the bedroom, the bathroom, the house, the yard - was better than we had hoped. It was so easy to feel comfortable here.  The large king size bed was incredibly comfy.  If it hadn't been for Melissa's outstanding baking every morning (yes, every morning!) I don't think I would have wanted to get out of bed!  The daily baked good, plus Abil's wonderful selection of fresh fruits and outstanding coffee made mornings a joy.  Both Abil and Melissa can recommend whatever you need in the city.  I've rarely felt so welcomed and cared for.  I can't wait to go back and to recommend this wonderful spot to my friends!"
1826155,22707522,2014-11-12,22740196,Eric,"Melissa & Abil were great hosts! We loved how they are very attentive to our needs. It was our first time in Seattle and they gave us lots of recommendations. Very very nice and lovely couple. 

Their house is very beautiful and huge, with a lovely setting and appeal to it. The room that we stayed at was very cozy and the bed was very comfy. The bathroom was very clean and perfect size. Everything was as described.

They served breakfast which was really yummy and freshly baked, we loved it! The place where it's located is very close to lots of restaurants and pub's. We loved our stay here, will definitely come back!! Thank you Melissa & Abil! "
1826155,22912438,2014-11-17,23088269,Kathy,"My husband and I had never stayed at a B & B before and the experience was wonderful. They were so welcoming into their home, felt like family without the 'drama'. Come and went as we pleased with complete privacy while we were there.  We stayed on the 2nd floor in the ""Sweet Suite"" and had  a very comfortable bed (you won't want to get up) and clean bathroom. Plenty of hot water. Also used a couple of refrigerator shelves specifically labeled for  guests. Melissa provided home-made, fresh out of the oven muffins, fresh fruit every morning and all the coffee we wanted. Very nice décor through out whole the house. Made us feel 'special'. We didn't want to leave and ""we'll be back'..... "
1826155,23259308,2014-11-26,22002177,Graham,"A warm welcome, a wonderful atmosphere, feel like you're home from home in the most perfect b&b in the world? Then you've arrived at Melissa and Abil's.
This was only my second airbnb stay; I didn't see much of my host at my first though that was largely due to my busy schedule. Abil was there to greet me and gave me a wonderfully comprehensive introductory tour, explaining all about the local area, transport and the lovely fresh muffins, fruit plate and tea (perfect for an Englishman!) provided each morning for breakfast.
It is in a residential area but great bars/bottle shops and a retail dispensary are only a ten minute walk away on East Union.
When I met Melissa later that night we enjoyed a wonderful karmic coincidence as I recounted some of my past employment; it emerged that she had collaborated on a project with the same person I had, who now resided in Seattle and I was able to meet up with him a couple of days later for the first time in eight years!
The room was a nice size, good ensuite and one of the most comfortable beds I have ever slept in!
I also went along to Abil's tour of Pike Brewing Co-great beer of course.
So this is an amazing place to stay, a real home from home and has encouraged me to keep using airbnb in the future."
1826155,23930693,2014-12-14,24693599,Justin,"This home is AMAZING!! What a beautiful place to stay with wonderful hosts! So much effort on the part of two these wonderful women has obviously been put into making this home a fabulously beautiful little bed and breakfast. Staying here truly makes you feel at home. When we arrived for the first time ever in Seattle we were greeted at the door and helped inside where our names had been written on a smartly decorated chalkboard, immediately making us feel very special. A fun and sharply dressed Mrs. Abil began showing us around the home and offered to help us with getting our bags upstairs. From the delicious home cooked continental breakfast, to the the super cool and well thought out 420 friendly outdoor Potting Shed, to the awesome music almost always playing throughout the home stereo system, the fabulous claw-footed bathtubs, to the Old World craft oriented  historic neighborhood with walking distance  recreational pot shop and headshop, and not least of all, the wealth of information available to you from long time Seattleites Melissa and Abil. It also is pretty sweet to be able to get a little free advice from an experienced, professional private chef and a nutritionist with a Masters Degree. We will stay here every time we come to Seattle! I would say this home and it's hosts should be MUST visit location for anyone coming to Seattle who wants to feel like an educated local right away. "
1826155,24215450,2014-12-22,24977746,Sally,"The accommodations at Seattle ""Sweet Suite"" Cherry Hill at Bed, Baked and Beyond were fantastic.  I felt pampered in a way that I have not felt staying at much more expensive hotels in downtown Seattle.  The room was beautifully furnished with antiques, a gorgeous four poster bed and luxurious bedding.  There was a water pitcher filled and left in the room with glasses.
The bathroom was SO nice - beautiful and spotlessly clean and with all the amenities - fluffy towels, soaps and even a hair dryer!  
The continental breakfast included was homemade apple cake - absolutely outstanding - accompanied by fresh fruit and fine coffee.
The location is ideal - quiet, yet very close to downtown with the option to ride the bus in if you choose not to rent a car.  The neighborhood is charming and completely safe.
The best part of this bed and breakfast are the hosts!  Abil and Melissa welcomed us so warmly!  They are long-time Seattle residents and were able to advise us on places nearby to eat or have drinks.   They gave a spot-on recommendation to a Vietnamese restaurant very close by.
I will definitely be staying at Bed, Baked and Beyond on my next visit to Seattle!"
1826155,24980985,2015-01-04,25095495,Zach,"To say that Melissa and Abil made us feel welcome is an understatement. They brought us into their own home and made us feel as comfortable as if we were at our own place. The neighborhood is charming and close enough to downtown that you can walk. Surrounded by eateries and and a plethora of things to do, this location is ideal and perfect for a getaway. We loved it and we will most definitely be staying with Melissa and Abil in the future. "
1826155,28548353,2015-03-25,6509240,John,"OK - so I am a regular business traveller who has tired of anonymous hotel rooms and so have been trying ABNB for a while now. 

If you can imagine the polar opposite of staying in a Hilton/Westin/Sheraton - well, M&A's amazing place is it.

It's not just the excellent location, historic building, thoughtful decor, smart remodelling, wonderful breakfast, waking up to the smell of baking muffins. 

It's not that everything is as advertised and works (better internet and cable than my last stay at the Fairmont!)

At the heart of the deal are two genuinely brilliant souls who will make the weary traveller feel like they've arrived home, even when that place may be 5000 miles away.

And isn't that what ABNB is really supposed to be about?

200% recommended. Can you give a place 6 stars? :-)

1826155,28675546,2015-03-28,29344388,Chenxiao,Melissa and Abil are so nice and offered many helpful suggestions of transportation and visiting sites. Also the homemade muffins in the breakfast are so awesome that I even want to eat them everyday after coming back home!!
1826155,28863227,2015-03-31,24843394,John,"Melissa, Abil and Courtney made sure that my wife and myself felt very welcome when we arrived and throughout our stay.  They have a beautiful place with a great location and provided tons of great suggestions for restaurants.  The morning started off great with tasty baked goods every morning.  We loved the bedroom and they made sure we were 100% comfortable the whole time.  The neighborhood is wonderful for walking and it was a great location to see spring time in Seattle.  We would gladly return to visit our new friends!"
1826155,29668700,2015-04-11,27872688,Becca,"Melissa and Abel are not only delightful people, but they made my short visit to the Emerald City fantastic! Super kind and knowledgable they had all the right recommendations for us.  {even to surprise Abel, who is most wise and a brewmaster, on one of her splendid tours @The Pike Pub & Brewery} #funtimes #fabulous 

The ""sweet suite"" is truly sweet; exquisite decor {throughout the whole house I might add} and a bed that is just what you need after a few...many....tokes in the ""potting shed""  or their gorgeously landscaped backyard.   Potting Shed: It's one of those places that is oddly familiar that makes you feel immediately comfortable. 

The inspired fresh baked muffins each morning are incredible & a reason to visit!  "

The house was fanastic, it was like being home staying in a traditional victorian property. Would recommend this to anyone looking for Seattle accomodation (sure beats a hotel) oh and the potting shed was really cool. Very nice experience :)"
1826155,30378925,2015-04-21,20438181,Tim,Melissa and Ability are wonderful host's. They are very helpful with ideas of what to do in Seattle. Yummy home made muffins and tasty coffee.

1826155,33543306,2015-05-29,3026587,Lorenzo,"I spent 4 days in Melissa and Abil's house during a business trip to Seattle. The experience has been really great! The house is nice, clean and well located. You can easily reach downtown Seattle by bus or on foot and the neighbourhood is full of great restaurants. Melissa and Abil are among the best hosts you can find! They pamper you with fresh biologic fruit and home-baked muffins every day, they help you in every way possible during your stay and they always have funny stories to share with you. I stayed in the Sweet Suite for 2 days. The room is great! it is nicely furnished, it has its own private bathroom and the bed is huge and probably the most comfortable bed I've slept into.
If you are visiting Seattle I really suggest to stay at Abil and Mellissa's."

1826155,35539576,2015-06-20,27782085,Lara,"We LOVED our experience at Bed, Baked, and Beyond. We loved the Bed - we slept SO well. We loved the Baked - we were there for a week and had a different kind of fresh baked muffin waiting for us every morning with yummy fresh fruit (some peaches even specially ordered from TX) and we especially loved the Beyond - great walking neighborhood, the other guests were wonderfully engaging, we watched crows help themselves to cherries from the tree in the back yard from our perch in the potting shed. We loved Melissa. We loved Abil. Every detail of the house is perfect, from the tea cups to the cocktail books. We LOVED Seattle! "

Everything in the room, as well as the house in general, embraced the victorian feel with awesome personal touches such as the art on the walls and the multiple rooms designed for relaxing and hanging out. Everything was very clean and well kept with nothing but good vibes all around. The hosts Melissa, Abil, and there assistant Courtney were all very helpful and knowlegable about the area and nice places to visit. The location is really awesome as well, just minutes away from downtown and numerous attractions. Overall a very awesome experience and comfortable/homey place to stay, with delicious homemade breakfast each morning!! Can't wait to visit again!"
1826155,37548751,2015-07-08,28474309,Jason,My wife & I thoroughly enjoyed our stay. Ms Melissa & Ms Abil are so easy to talk to & truly know how to make their guests feel at home. We can't recommend them highly enough. Would definitely stay there again.
1826155,37776164,2015-07-10,31988663,Jean,"Staying in the ""Sweet Suite"" was a great way to end a vacation in the Pacific Northwest.  I was able to have a restful and relaxing time there.  The location was wonderful.  I did not have a car and was quickly able to take the bus into the city.  Every morning Melissa baked a wonderful breakfast treat and served it with fresh fruit.  Yummy!  Melissa and Abel were wonderful hosts.  When I come back to Seattle I would like to stay there again!!"
1826155,38898717,2015-07-19,37072918,Colin,The hosts were very welcoming and helped us with anything we needed. We enjoyed staying here.
1826155,39207114,2015-07-21,13536192,Maria,"This was the first time I booked a private room in someone's home. I have to say this was the best Airbnb I have EVER stayed at. Melissa and Abil were very welcoming and warm. They took me in as if we known each other for a long time. Their home is amazing. The room was wonderful, comfortable, quiet and clean. Melissa makes the best bake goods and the best part of the whole stay was the yummy breakfast and coffee. 

Their house is located in a great spot of Seattle which is walking distance or bus ride to everything. 

Melissa and Abil were helpful with suggestions of where to eat, visit, etc. which was super helpful for me. 

I would definitely stay here again on my next visit to Seattle and suggest their home to anyone looking for a safe, clean and comfortable place to stay. "
1826155,39541446,2015-07-24,37730763,Haley,"We had our first Airbnb stay at Melissa and Abil's  and it was a wonderful first go! Our room, and the rest of the home, were perfectly clean and welcoming. Checking in and out, as well as communicating prior to arrival, was prompt and easy. It wasn't only a beautiful place to stay but an amazing opportunity to meet wonderful new people and learn of great, local places to visit and eat. We couldn't have had a better stay! "
1826155,40752989,2015-08-02,16588235,Ellen,"Is it weird to be homesick for an Airbnb?  After our week-long stay in the Sweet Suite, we are back to reality and missing the smell of muffins in the morning and stimulating conversation with our vibrant hostesses. Happy to report that the grounds and accommodations are exactly as advertised with a touch of charm and attention to detail that can't quite be captured in these photos.  We felt comfortable coming and going as we pleased, but whenever we needed something or had a question, one of our hostesses was always available with answers, recommendations, or supplies. Words could never elucidate just how special this B&B is and certainly not only 500 of them; suffice it to say this is fast becoming one of our favorite vacations ever thanks to our stay in the Sweet Suite.  Thank you, Melissa, Abil, and Courtney! "
1826155,41223413,2015-08-05,462595,Kim,"If you want to feel like you are at home but with extra pampering, stay at Sweet Suite in Seattle.  We loved the place, the hosts, the vibe.  We arrived a bit late -- no problem.  We were warmly welcomed and Melissa's morning muffins were a highlight of our trip to Seattle.  This ""bed, baked and beyond"" guesthouse won our hearts.  The bed was super comfy and the outdoor area was a great place to relax.  We hope to come back soon!"
1826155,41933841,2015-08-10,32204864,Melinda,"First ABNB experience. IT WAS AWESOME. Melissa, Abil and Courtney welcomed us like family and proceeded to treat us as such.  Everything about Bed Baked and Beyond is outstanding. Rooms had everything one would need, even a flat screen if you had to. The beds were heavenly and luxuriously dressed. The bathrooms gorgeous and shiny clean! The Grand Lady, the house herself, was solid and quiet. Never heard a sound. Slept like a dream. Hostess Melissa's warm morning muffins, fruit and coffee always started us out right. The house is appointed with delightful art and vintage charm. Never had a problem with street parking, even when coming in late. We all want to recreate ""The Potting Shed"" in our own homes. I will never stay anywhere else in Seattle!"
1826155,42541845,2015-08-14,15000116,Laura,"We had an amazing time staying at the mansion. We stayed in the bay window suite and the loft room and both were great with very comfy beds! The muffins were delicious and we loved hanging out in the potting shed. Melissa, Abil, and Courtney were all so hopeful and gave us great recommendations on food and things to do. Abil's brewery tour was also great and definitely recommended. We hope to stay here again the next time that we are in Seattle!"
1826155,42863154,2015-08-16,36271560,Michelle,Best place I've ever stayed!! The best host in the world! We felt right at home and the muffins were out of this world!
1826155,44282838,2015-08-25,31776983,Burt,"Melissa was very accommodating of my needs. She, Abil, and Courtney were great hosts who helped me in having a pleasant and relaxing few days."
1826155,45469563,2015-09-03,35261497,Jordan,"It’s hard to describe how awesome our stay at Bed Baked and Beyond was. Melissa, Abil and their assistant Courtney went out of their way to make our stay the best it could be. 

We drove into Seattle with our own car, but were relieved to see plenty of on-street parking. When we finally pulled up we knew we would be in for a treat. Being one of the biggest and most well kept houses on the block, a beautiful victorian mansion with a massive cedar tree and plenty of plants lining the walkway. 

We were greeted by Courtney, who promptly helped us with all of our questions and showed us to our rooms. The house was as beautiful inside as it was out. With vintage stylings and unique adornments. 

Our rooms, aptly named the “Sweet Suite” that opened with a heart covered key were warm and inviting. The amazing hand carved four post king sized bed was a pleasure to sleep in, and the unique vintage paintings and lovely south facing sun window with plenty of cushions and pillows added to the cozy feel. The newly renovated  bathroom with a wonderful walk in shower was a pleasure to use. Even the shared bathrooms upstairs and down were spacious and pristine. 

The common areas of the house were clean and beautifully decorated. Each with their own unique styling. The kitchen and dining area are equally charming, and did i mention free beer?
Each morning we were greeted to a beautifully set table with a fresh fruit plate, tea, coffee and an amazing home baked muffin, with each day a different kind. Melissa is quite the amazing cook! 

The backyard and garden is lush and green, with lots of little trinkets and things to find. The “potting shed” offers a place to relax and enjoy the enigmatic seattle weather, with an old stereo playing the local independent radio station. 

Melissa, Abil and Courtney were always there to provide us with ideas on things to do, or just offer some genuine company. We really enjoyed getting to know these ladies and making new friends in Seattle.

Our time spent here was just how a vacation should be, relaxing, magical and hassle free. We were quite sad to leave, but we will be back to visit soon and know exactly where we will be staying!"
1826155,46583049,2015-09-12,35514828,Tom,"This was the perfect choice for our stay in Seattle, their home is so beautiful. They made us feel very welcome and had great advise for places to eat. Plus the muffins that Melissa makes every morning for breakfast are absolutely amazing!"
1826155,47346189,2015-09-18,33114598,Luis,"From the moment we arrived we were warmly welcomed and completely looked after better than we could of ever hoped for.

As for the room itself it was absolute luxury.  We both agreed that it was easily the nicest bed we have ever had anywhere including home.  The bathroom was lovely too with a great supply of lotions and shampoos etc.  The whole place was perfectly clean and the house itself is beautiful.

The muffins were out of this world good and a plate of fruit each morning in the lovely dining room was a perfect start to the day.

Its a lovely neighboorhood which feels very safe close walking distance to some lovely bars and eateries.  Only a short stroll to downtown although we did choose to get the bus back most days after walking around the city all day.  This was easy and convenient also.

All in all it was the best holiday accomodation ever in a beautiful house with beautiful people.  I think anyone would feel comfortable and able to be themselves in this great atmosphere.

I enjoyed a fair amount of time in the famous pot-ting shed which was just perfect place to chill after a day in the city.  My better half also enjoyed some lovely local beers provided with a great amount of knowledge.

Why stay in a hotel when you can feel more comfortable and get a much warmer welcome in a place like this.

Bed Baked and Beyond gets 10/10 from me."
1826155,48862762,2015-09-29,24750641,Vanessa,I seriously can't describe how special the whole experience was. It was like staying with the family you like. Like some bad ass organic sisters you never knew you had. All the little things and finishing touches clearly show their passion and dedication to the property and their guests.  I could go on and on and on....  Just go! I can't wait to come back.
1826155,49325143,2015-10-03,40228165,Susan,"My boyfriend and I stayed at the Bed Baked & Beyond Cherry Hill Guesthouse for 4 days during our vacation to Seattle. It was our first experience with AirBnB and we could not have asked for anything better! :) The house was beautifully decorated and had lots of character. We stayed in the ""Sweet Suite"" which was amazing! It had an incredibly comfy king size bed, a big bay window, and an attached bathroom. We also loved relaxing in the pot-ting shed and socializing with the other guests. The freshly baked muffins and fresh fruit plates every morning were delicious! The neighborhood was very safe and only a short walk to many good restaurants and good ol' Uncle Ike's! ;) We could not have asked for anything better and look forward to staying here again on our next trip to Seattle :)"
1826155,49609422,2015-10-05,35950016,Laura,"We were so comfortable Abil and Melissa's place.  Unfortunately, Melissa was out of town and we did not get to meet her, but Abil was very warm, friendly and helpful.  Courtney, their assistant, was a pleasure, as well.  The whole place was charming and clean, homey and comfortable.  Their place is close to downtown but still quiet.  We enjoyed Abil's recommendations on where to go, the breakfasts and the other guests, too.  We would go back in a heartbeat!!!"
1826155,50108497,2015-10-09,41771209,Nate,"You have stumbled onto a rare AirBNB gem. Book your stay here now before you miss your chance.

From the moment you arrive you are greeted with friendly and accommodating hosts. Everything is beautiful, clean, warm, and comfortable.

The room is large, clean, and very comfortable. The private bathroom was amazing with toiletries provided, fresh, thick bath towels, and home filtered water so you can drink right out of the tap.

Every morning a fresh breakfast of amazing fruit and fresh baked goods are provided. The hosts prepared a different baked good for every day of my stay and also accommodated my dietary requests by making the items with gluten free flour. I don't drink beer but free beer is provided any time of the day.

The hosts are kind, helpful, and generous. They gave me some fantastic recommendations for eating out that only locals would know about.

I've stayed in a lot of AirBNBs and have generally had a great experience, but this place goes up and above. I'm sad to leave. You will love it."
1826155,50408373,2015-10-11,33373326,Michael,This was one of the most fabulous places I have stayed in. Melissa and Abil were even more fabulous. 
1826155,51513747,2015-10-20,27664998,Peter Christopher,"Melissa and Abil are the hardest working innkeepers  in Seattle, who in addition to working at other jobs have made their home a beautiful refuge in downtown Seattle.  Using vintage decor completely in harmony with the bones of the house every room is unique and the common spaces are like drawing rooms made by Oscar Wilde.  And that doesn't even get to the homemade muffins, preserves, and fresh fruit offered every morning.  But the best part of our all too brief visit, was getting to meet and talk with Melissa and Abil, who are totally involved in the fabric of their neighborhood and are a great resource to all the city has to offer and are just very cool.  As far as we're concerned, this place has become another Seattle landmark and is worth a visit just to stay there.  Chris and Robin."
1826155,52093911,2015-10-26,44877841,Kenneth,"Melissa and Albi are such wonderful hosts! Melissa waited up for us and helped us navigate when the cab dropped us off a mile away. She oriented us to the house and let us settle in. She took our preferences for breakfast drinks (coffee or tea) and made sure to let us know that breakfast is served hot from the oven between 8-8:30am, but we could eat later if we wanted. Fresh fruit and home baked pastries got us out of bed in the morning. It was delicious! Everything was exactly as described and even more wonderful in person. The house was warm and inviting and the potting shed had blankets for when it got chilly at night. They made wonderful recommendations for dinner (Place Pigalle and Wild Ginger) were highlights as well as the beer tour from Albi. The neighborhood felt safe and we frequently walked around to enjoy the nice weather. We will definitely be staying here in the future whenever we make it back to Seattle."
1826155,52899540,2015-11-02,3794130,Todd,"I loved my room. Melissa and Abil made me feel right at home. The room was comfortable and clean. Everything I needed was provided: soft/comfortable bedding, towels, bathroom amenities. The house was peaceful and quiet and in a great location. The breakfast Melissa made was so delicious! They were both helpful in guiding me in what to see, where to go, and how to get there. So many extras that were not expected, but very appreciated, I can't list them all. This is my best experience staying away from home. I can't wait to visit Seattle again. I will definitely stay here again, hopefully soon. Five star experience offered by a five star couple."
1826155,53229987,2015-11-06,48029854,Adam,"Our hosts were the best! They made our stay a true delight. Great people!  They helped us with ALL info. ( local hots spots, transportation, special events ...you name it!)
Hosts made us fresh muffins every morning. Best I've ever had!!!  Great rooms. Very clean. Our stay there will not be the last. WE WILL BE BACK LADIES!
The neighborhood is peaceful and you can relax knowing your safe and near all transportation if you don't feel like the drive to either side of the city!
We would recommend you stay here if your visiting Seattle for any reason.*****rating for this B&B!"
1826155,54100443,2015-11-16,42818742,Jackson,"Our stay was exceptional! Our hostesses were so warm, inviting, helpful, and accommodating. They allowed us to have an early check in which was a huge help. The place was beautiful and well maintained. We had everything we needed. Convenient location not far from downtown. Free coffee and breakfast in the morning was sweet as well as free beer!! They were very quick to get back to me on any questions or concerns I had. 5 out 5 stars. Will definitely book again next time I'm in Seattle!"
1826155,54374419,2015-11-19,44618412,Carl,"Melissa, Abel, and Team do a fantastic job in creating a hospitable environment for their guests.  Muffins, coffee/tea, and fruit are available every morning, the rooms are spotless, and the common areas in the house are great for chatting (or getting work done).  Above all, the hosts truly want you to experience all that is Seattle.  They'll answer questions, point you in the direction of their favorite spots, and allow you to experience Seattle like a local."
1826155,54755569,2015-11-23,47918951,Allison,"Melissa and Abil really open their home to visitors. We felt so comfortable during our entire stay and the breakfasts were fantastic. Melissa and Abil go out of their way to make recommendations of things to do. Their home is centrally located and just a short distance to many activities. Thanks Melissa, Abil and Courtney"
1826155,55423426,2015-12-01,47501836,Tim,This was our first bed and breakfast experience. I'm delighted to say it exceeded all our expectations. From the moment we arrived we felt welcome and at ease. Courtney and Melissa were very knowledgeable about the area as well as the local hideouts. Each morning we were greeted with a beautiful fruit plate and a mouth watering muffin. The home was kept very tidy. You could feel it is something they enjoy doing and sharing with others. If we ever end up in Seattle again I look forward to staying again.
1826155,56383845,2015-12-13,47557770,Erin,"Wow. From the moment we entered the door, we felt comfortable, welcome, and at home! We couldn't have asked for better hosts. They had great recommendations and were available to answer any questions. The room was great (comfy bed). Loved the location, too. Great muffins and fruit plate :) we really could not have asked for a better experience. Bravo!!"
1826155,56722198,2015-12-17,47132125,Jay,"Melissa and Abil are great hosts. They were very helpful when I was planning my activities around Seattle. The fresh-baked pastries that Melissa made every morning were the best. Every morning I was excited to see what tasty treat she had made for breakfast. I was never disappointed. The house has a classic/vintage feel to it but, everything works like new (shower, WiFi, etc.). There is a lot of stuff (food, drinks, pot shops) within walking distance of the house. This was my first time at a bed and breakfast and it was a positive experience. I would stay here again and recommend it to my friends. Thanks Melissa and Abil.   "
7798575,45622603,2015-09-04,6066477,Jonathan,"Staying with Tanya was a blast. She really opened up her home to me and was very generous with her space. The apartment was very pleasant and homey, but by far the best part of the experience was interacting with Tanya herself, who is a very goodhearted and all-around excellent human being. Also she has a really sweet (mellow!) greyhound named Bella who lies around all day. Bella is the best.

Anyway! Highly recommend."
7798575,46650823,2015-09-12,9226976,Koan,"Great host, great location.  Tanya was amazingly friendly.  The location is central to downtown and a bunch of attractions.  The couch is comfy and Bella the dog will give you a sniff once a day to remind you who's boss.  All in all, highly recommended.  "
7798575,47328379,2015-09-17,2064395,Peter,"Tanya was an incredible host. Even though I was only staying on the couch, she made me feel like a very welcomed guest.  She gave me lots of local tips on Seattle and we had some great conversations.  (And Bella her greyhound is a sweet girl.)  Her apartment was perfectly situated for someone wanting to explore central Seattle - SO CLOSE to the Space Needle.  Close to a number of bus lines to help get you around town.  I wish that I stayed there longer, would definitely stay with her again!  Mille grazie!!"
7798575,47591337,2015-09-20,5062652,Lily,"I had a wonderful stay with Tanya. She made everything easy and seamless. Beautiful apartment, neat, clean and welcoming. Surprisingly comfy couch. And the sweetest dog you could ask for.  I'd definitely hope to stay with Tanya again on my next trip to Seattle."
7363701,39692123,2015-07-25,29101913,Mischell,"We had a lovely stay in Steven's apartment. It is large and very clean. The Capital Hill neighborhood is a fun part of town, close to restaurants and other places of interest. We checked in with Steven's mother and checked out with his sister. Both women were very friendly and helpful. The only thing to note is that the apartment is in the basement and does not have a lot of natural light. This was not a problem for us, but may be for some guests."
7363701,40402110,2015-07-30,2194473,Tony,We had a quite stay in Steven's clean  apartment. The area is very pleasant with a residential feel. The apartment is located in the basement with access via the side fire egress passage. We could not get phone signal and the wifi wasn't working which made it difficult. We got wifi from a near by (website hidden) had no signal so we had a quite time there.
7363701,41436807,2015-08-07,30081191,Ashlee,"Steven's place was a great place to stay while visiting Seattle. The description and pictures do it justice--it's a cozy, vintage apartment in North Capitol Hill that made us feel like we were staying at a friend's place. The place was clean and well put together--Steven had even left some bathroom amenities for our use (which was helpful as I forgot my shampoo). I'd definitely recommend this place to a friend--nice vibe, good price, and a kind host. "
7363701,42171654,2015-08-11,22587053,Stacie,"Steven was very welcoming, we felt right at home! His place is centrally located and easy to walk to all the attractions downtown and in Capitol Hill area. We even walked around Lake Union. Thank you we had a wonderful time! "
7363701,42973085,2015-08-16,4082355,Iain,"Steven was very accomodating. We arrived late at night, and he made great arrangements for us to get in to the apartment. The apartment is very comfortable and spacious. Bus line to downtown is right outside the door! We had a great time seeing the city!"
7363701,45109077,2015-08-31,26825360,Gil,"Steven was a wonderful host. His space was wonderful, well kept and close to all the attractions we wanted to see, mainly the convention center.

We'll definitely come back next year!"
7363701,46780499,2015-09-13,42117043,Nick,Thanks for the accom. Nice comfy apartment and good location. 
7363701,53980853,2015-11-15,13507304,Robin,Steven was a great host. He was very accommodating and he even texted me during my stay to see if everything worked for us. Also his place was really hip and in an awesome location. Thanks Steven! 
7363701,56418339,2015-12-13,49898143,Jeanne,"Steven met my husband at a prearranged time to hand over the keys and give us access to his apartment. It has a great almost private entrance in a very quiet location. The one-bedroom apartment is exceedingly clean and very tastefully decorated. The bed is comfortable (though is a mattress and box springs on the floor). Marty slept on the couch because we are used to a king-sized bed and didn't ""downsize"" so well. The couch is exceptionally comfortable.

The Capital Hill location is a few blocks downhill from Broadway, very convenient to lots of things. The apartment is an older one, and is kept up very well. I will definitely stay here again.  This is my first airbnb. The only reason for the 4 stars is the age of the place, which the host cannot fix."
7363701,57817788,2015-12-29,47474938,Krista,The host canceled this reservation 5 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
7363701,57851559,2015-12-29,41645247,Mark,Fun one bedroom. Very close to good eats. We had a great time. 
9186256,54686510,2015-11-22,10441864,Dana Kay,"Krystal was very accommodating with our check in. We were welcomed with wine, a cheese tray, and a few necessities in the fridge. Plenty of fresh towels, great Wifi, nice TV, convenient location, and decent beds! Met all of our needs!"
4438160,24472052,2014-12-29,23252148,Kevin,"House was in a great location. Amazing kitchen area and we felt very welcome. The downstairs carpeted area didn't do so well for our allergies, but overall it was a great experience!"
4438160,40497514,2015-07-31,38033779,Mason,"The house really is as pretty as pictured, and Sasha left me with everything I needed to have a relaxing stay in Ballard (including restaurant and grocery recommendations). Also the house is a convenient 2 blocks away from the bus stop.  I would recommend staying here if you get the chance."
4438160,42283758,2015-08-12,37036334,Lu,"My family enjoyed their 6-day stay at this nice and clean two-story Ballard house. We got everything we need and the location is more convenient than we expected to get to Seattle downtown. The hens in the yard are very cute and provided us fresh eggs everyday. The extra mattress was provided per our request. The host Sasha gave us all the details we need to know before we came. Comparing with 4 people living in hotels for 6 days, the Ballard Home gave you more space and cost much less. Thank you Sasha for everything. "
4438160,44666330,2015-08-28,7261047,Avery,"We had a really nice stay here. The house is in a nice, quiet neighborhood. It's a short drive or long walk to downtown Ballard. There are also a few bars and restaurants within a short walk. The layout is one BR, an office, and a bathroom on the first floor, and another BR, bathroom, and the kitchen and living/dining room upstairs. The upstairs is recently remodeled and the kitchen is much bigger than it looks in the photos. Sasha was very easy to get in touch with. She provided a futon mattress to use in the office, which was a nice option for one of my kids, but I wouldn't put an adult on the futon. There's off street parking and a smallish but nice yard. "
4438160,55357023,2015-12-01,29958630,Susan,"I had a great time. The house is very spacious, clean, and decorated quite well. "
7534300,40678500,2015-08-01,39570574,Jinping,RICK对我们的招待非常热情，准备了丰富的水果饮料和早餐。房子非常整洁干净，床非常舒适，卫生间真的比自己家的还要干净很多。整个房子的装修非常现代，布置简洁明快。客厅有超大玻璃窗户，整个客厅非常敞亮。房顶有很好的烧烤炉和视野。房子街区很安静，离湖边很近的距离，差不多只有3－5个街区吧（记不清了）。
7534300,41507646,2015-08-07,9290629,(email hidden),"Great host! Gorgeous house!  And they put up with my crazy schedule, which is always a plus.  Highly recommend.  "

His hospitality and warmness I would recommend to anyone that is wanting to experience a great host, a great view, and overall warmness to Seattle.  I cannot recommend him enough!"
7534300,42366266,2015-08-12,40334670,David,"Rick was extremely welcoming of me into his beautiful home.  He ensured that I was comfortable and antiquated with his home.  I had full use of the facilities and yes, the view is beautiful.   "
7534300,43875490,2015-08-22,22166251,Mary,Rick is a fantastic host! I felt immediately comfortable and relaxed in his beautiful home. The listing description is extremely accurate. Guests here will be pleased.
7534300,45197462,2015-08-31,37164556,Ryan,"Rick was an excellent host! He gave great recommendations and even helped us get into a private social club. Rick had coffee and breakfast for us every morning and even went out and got fresh pastries for us.

The house was incredible and even better than the listing. The view from the rooftop deck is incredible and the walkout basement was great too.

The house is a short Uber from downtown. Overall, great experience."

8455865,52859823,2015-11-02,45370869,McKenzie,"Our stay in Bill's home was excellent from start to finish.  Bill met us at the house with the keys and a bottle of wine to welcome us to the city, and let us know he was available should we have any questions or concerns.  The house itself is gorgeous (we especially loved the kitchen!) and the Queen Anne location made getting around the city very easy.  All in all, it was a great trip and we thoroughly enjoyed the experience.  Thank you, Bill and family, for your hospitality!"
8455865,55377761,2015-12-01,25440351,Jules,"Multiple times in the weeks prior to the trip, Bill and I communicated by email.  He made it very clear that he will do whatever necessary to work with our arrival schedule.   He also made some special accommodations for our young adult children in terms of sleeping arrangements.    The home was exactly as portrayed.  The gourmet kitchen was completely equipped and along with the oven downstairs, we were able to cook a Thanksgiving dinner for 8 people and share it in that beautiful home.   The neighborhood is magnificent and on street parking was never a problem.   The home is large, modern, and comfortable.  We look forward to a return trip!!!"

The house was spacious and the kitchen waiting to be used - which we did readily.  The bedrooms are small but functional and while the single bathroom had not been updated, everything worked and was clean.  

The sun/yoga deck is the true highlight of the property and Darlene was easily available to answer questions both in advance and during our stay.  Overall a nice property and positive experience.  

One item to note for prospective AirBnB users... this is not a classical rental property - it is a well lived in and neighborhood home.  Part of the experience is watering the plants and feeding the cat.  We enjoyed the comforts of home while still on vacation - enter this property with this mindset and all will be good; if you are looking for a pristine condo feel, this is not your cup of tea."
3613516,45142040,2015-08-31,2013159,Arthur,The view is certainly amazing. Darlene left towels and some snacks out along with a thoughtful note. We very much enjoyed our stay here.
838764,3800650,2013-03-16,5340844,Michelle,The house was great and so was Wayne.  It had more room than I expected and a beautiful master bedroom and bath downstairs.  Everything was spotless and the towels and sheets were laundered to perfection!   Would definitely stay again and recommend to anyone :)
838764,4449995,2013-05-06,3786027,Christina,"It was a great house, great location, Wayne was super! Very helpful and attentive to everything. We couldn't have asked for a better house to spend time in. The backyard was very cozy and with the house only a block from the beach, you couldn't ask for a better location! We will stay there again when we are in the area! And since our son lives in West Seattle, that will be often!"
838764,5207930,2013-06-18,5724834,Belvon,"Wayne is a very accommodating host.  The house is quite comfortable and surprisingly spacious.  The best part is that it is located a block from Alki Beach. The next time I stay in Seattle, I would definitely come back here. "
838764,7948616,2013-10-09,6723341,Jerry,"Nice house in a terrific location.  It's a short block away from the water, running and bike paths, and all the places to eat and drink on Alki Beach.  There's a fire pit on the patio too.  Wayne was a great host with a lot of local information.  We had a great time. "
838764,9348564,2013-12-23,8190362,Silvia,"Great house, great location, great host!"
838764,9958491,2014-01-21,2424430,Kyle,"Wayne is a very friendly person and his house is beautiful. It slept all 8 members of our party in relative comfort. We didn't use the patio areas at all, but the rooms are good, beds are clean, and the surrounding area is very nice. Wayne gave us a nice verbal tour of the area when we checked in, which was very helpful.

If you're going to be spending most of your time in the city center, Alki beach is a bit secluded -- it takes about an hour to get from Wayne's house to Belltown, but if you rent a car, have time to ride the busses, or don't mind paying for cabs you can't find a better spot.

We did have a bit of a misunderstanding regarding payment since we were such a large party, but Wayne has since updated his listing on Air B&B to more accurately reflect his requirements, so that should be cleared up."
838764,10514745,2014-02-23,9524109,Lilian,"Our family of six having a good time at the place, it is nice and clean, close to the beach, shops and restaurant.  Wayne have been a great host to all of us, he respond fast and take care issues right a way. We all enjoyed staying there.  "
838764,10708874,2014-03-03,11496685,Xavier,"We were a group of 8 friends and we stayed for just a week end at Wayne's house, and it was perfect ! The house is very big and comfortable. Even with 8 people, we all have a lot of space. It is located close to a lot of shops and restaurants, in a quiet area, and you are only to 30 minutes from downtown Seattle with your car (even less if you are not going during rush hour). Wayne was very nice. We arrived just before midnight, and he was waiting for the visit of the house. He was available for us if we needed something. You can go there, you won't be disappointed !"
838764,11735180,2014-04-14,2430202,Tom,"Wayne was a great host and very helpful- his place was just what we were looking for, and in an excellent location.  We would definitely stay here again!"
