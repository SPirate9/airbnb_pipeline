935862,52489461,2015-10-30,43286523,Bill,"Was contacted a few days prior to travel to make sure all questions were answered.  Accommodations were excellent, the location is within walking distance of nearly everything.  Check in and check out was painless and quick.  Everything went off without a hitch.  Thanks again!"
935862,53363632,2015-11-08,42786918,Regina,"What an amazing place to stay at. Better than the images I saw, and we had an amazing view of the harbor. Everything was clean and supplied. We were literally only two blocks away from pike market."
935862,54693889,2015-11-23,6472823,Tess,"This was the first time I have not meet a host person at the property.  It actually worked out just fine since our flight was changed and our arrival to Seattle was delayed by a few hours.  I did receive all of the info I needed via E prior to our arrival.   The welcome packet was detailed and very handy.   It gave us all of the details we needed.  

The property itself was great.  The location was perfect: right downtown in the middle of all of the oceanfront/downtown action.  The staff at the desk were very friendly and helpful.  We were on the 6th floor with a corner condo.  The furnishings were comfy and clean, as were all of the linens.  The snack basket was nice and the kitchen was just the right size.  We didn't do much outside of sleep there as we spent most of our time out and about.  There were no noise issues and the view of the waterfront and wheel was just right.    
I would recommend this place to my friends and would stay there again should we need two bedrooms.  It's perfect for visitors who want to be downtown and within walking distance to the sites in that area.          "
5183938,26232918,2015-02-07,5625824,Benoit,"I had a great time in Miranda's place. Great location, perfectly equipped, this is definitely a 5* AirBnB experience.
During my stay, we had a wifi problem. Miranda fixed it within the day. She has been always available for any help. Really grateful! Thanks. Ben."
5183938,26405182,2015-02-11,6624998,Paul,A smooth and enjoyable experience. The accommodation matched the pictures. Modern and comfortable. The listings says there is a hot tub and wireless intercom which is not correct. There was no way to let in guests other than walk down to the lobby which was a minor inconvenience. Otherwise the stay was great. 
5183938,26632571,2015-02-16,6212486,Nigel,"Great hosts that welcomed me with a bottle of wine & chocolates. I was met by their associate, Wally, who showed me around and introduced me to the apartment.

Apartment is in a great location and beautifully designed and equipped with all essentials. Pictures are all accurate."
5183938,27010385,2015-02-23,14033246,Marella,"Upon arrival, we had a bottle of wine and chocolates waiting for us. The hosts accommodated all of our needs. The apartment was brand new and fully furnished. I suggest anyone who is going to Seattle for the first time to stay here! It is a 10 minute walk from all the major tourist points and has great shopping right down town. The water is also a quick 3 minute walk nearby too. Great area, very young and lively. I had a great time and would definitely stay in another place hosted by Miranda and Michael. "
5183938,27154548,2015-02-26,3115758,Tunde,Fantastic apartment with a great gym and awesome roof deck. 5 star stay all around. Looking forward to staying here again. 
5183938,27349345,2015-03-02,27537017,Frank,"Great place to stay, very quick communication and very flexable.  Highly recommend."
5183938,27701850,2015-03-09,7486486,Luis,"Eve was very nice and very helpful. Her place is extremely clean, and the location in an amazing. I would definitely stay there again. "
5183938,28136405,2015-03-18,624787,Kiley,"Eve greeted us outside and walked us in to the unit.  We were immediately at home.  The unit was spotless, plus she left a bottle of wine and some chocolates.  When we walked outside (our first time in Seattle), we found ourselves right in the heart of one of the coolest areas.  I have to say, if you stay here and you like pizza, eat at Roccos.  Just do it.  Do it now.

The unit was perfect, Eve was friendly and helpful, and the area was a perfect central location for us to explore everything Seattle.  I highly recommend it and we might even rent it again!"
5183938,28337082,2015-03-22,11162942,Monique,"Our stay at this unit  was actually really nice. Eve made it easy to check in and even let us check in early.  The apt is exactly what the pictures look like and the TV set up with the netflix was a nice touch.  The bed was super comfy as well! We loved everything about the place, even the faux balcony.

Parking wasn't too crazy. We befriended the security guard across from the apts which was cool bc he eventually let us park in the lot for free. 

Prior to this I read reviews about this apt being in a bad area of town, but it wasn't so bad. There were a few sketchy people walking around, but if you go about your business then everything should be all good. We were able to walk around until 2am which was cool. 

Definitely would stay here again. "
5183938,28732521,2015-03-29,28916027,Maryam,"Had a perfect weekend in Seattle which was in large part because of this great home-like place we stayed at. I'll repeat what others have said - great location, even better host, clean and cozy. But I'll also add that what struck us most was how our experience was both home-y and professional at the same time. Eve is very responsive and goes the extra mile. The house was well stocked and whatever else we needed (chopping board, coffee filters) was provided immediately. In fact, Eve had a friend drop those things off because she was not in the immediate vicinity at that very moment. I find that exceptional service. Would stay here if I'm ever in Seattle again."
5183938,28999746,2015-04-02,1417099,Travis,"Eve is very communicative, prompt, and thoughtful. She made my stay quite easy and stress free, and enjoyable. The place itself is clean, new, modern and quite lovely. I spent more than a couple hours with the Netflix TV after my workday :) I didn't get to use the gym as I had planned, but it looked simple and clean. I did enjoy the rooftop view, and the location can't be beat."
5183938,29213297,2015-04-05,12846036,Brett,"Eve was a great host. When we arrived, she wasn't feeling well so she arranged to have her colleague, Wally, drop off the key. He was more than helpful. The location was great and within walking distance to everything downtown. She checked in with us during our stay to make sure things went smoothly. No complaints."
5183938,29612445,2015-04-10,3032777,Caitlin,"Eve was an amazing host, to say the least! Her instructions for arrival made everything extremely easy and stress free for the two of us after a long flight. She was also gracious enough to check in with us a couple of times during our stay to make sure that everything was as we expected and gave us a few tips of things to enjoy around the city. The apartment is in a great location! Right in the heart of downtown and literally within walking distance of EVERYTHING! A very beautiful home in a beautiful city. Thank you, Eve! "
5183938,29887336,2015-04-13,30670746,Gert,"Eve is the ideal host - thoughtful and forthcoming, yet professional and discrete.
Checking in was a breeze and right away allowed us to kick back and relax after a long day of traveling.

Respectful of our privacy, she only once checked in via text to make sure everything was to our satisfaction. Yet she was easy to get a hold of and was immediate in her response, with suggestions that were spot on - e.g. best Eggs Benedict in town.

With an apartment and a location that exceeded the high expectations we had from the details of the posting, our experience turned into something that was reminiscent of a five star stay that can tango with the best of them - and walk away with gold.

Next time I’m in Seattle, my first choice will be Eve’s."
5183938,30298334,2015-04-20,26680501,Louis,"Eve and Michael were fantastic hosts! The apartment was beautiful and in a great location close to the waterfront, the attractions and an array of restaurants. The apartment surpassed my expectations and I couldn't have asked for anymore. I would highly recommend this property to anybody visiting Seattle. "
5183938,30536705,2015-04-23,17263961,Rebecca," Eve was extremely accommodating and was there waiting for me when I arrived. She showed me around and made sure I felt at home. She even left me a nice note and a welcome gift! 
The apartment itself was impeccable.Everything was brand new and super clean. The location couldn't be beat. I would love to stay here again!"
5183938,31521061,2015-05-06,1777553,Michael,"Eve was a wonderful host... She made our stay very enjoyable! The room was very clean, new, and modern. Also it is great location, very close to the downtown Seattle."
5183938,31892463,2015-05-11,25208247,Yena,"Eve was friendly and her house was really wonderful! the only thing we were dissatisfied was that shower water press was quite weak. Overall, her apartment is clean, comfortable and located perfect place. I would choose her studio if I visit Seattle again :) "
5183938,32931863,2015-05-23,19005484,Pete,"Eve's place is crazy convenient, within stumbling distance of great food, shops, and bars (or a few minutes uber away from most fun spots).  The apartment is clean, looks just like the pictures, and even has a pool table and other games down in the building's common rec room.

Eve was quick to check me in herself, showing me the details, and was responsive throughout my stay.  Great spot & easy to work with - I hope to be back soon :)"
5183938,33163310,2015-05-25,24195979,Josh,"Eve is a very nice host. She welcomed with a bottle of wine, and always responded to my questions quickly. The place is in a great location, walking distances to all the major tourist sites, bars and restaurants. I will stay in her place again next time I visit."
5183938,33555679,2015-05-29,30420275,Madeleine,Eve was very professional and the apartment was exactly as portrayed. It was also in a great location! I would stay here again! :) 
5183938,33951309,2015-06-02,22951559,Charise,"Eve was very prompt, friendly and provided great suggestions for activities around the area.  The apt is perfectly located right in the middle of the city making it easy to walk to almost all major landmarks.  I would highly recommend this location for convenience and comfort!"
5183938,34295810,2015-06-07,30998139,Patricia,"Eve was very responsive and a great host.  We walked to Pike's Place, ferry terminal, shopping, dining and other attractions. If you don't have a car or would prefer to walk, then this is the place to stay.  It's about a 15-20minute fast pace walk to/from the rail station. Belltown has many restaurants, bars, and night life of your choosing.  
I would definitely stay here again. "
5183938,34701254,2015-06-11,323091,Darren,Beautiful apartment with great restaurants around. Near to attractions and easy to get around. Eve was also extremely helpful!
5183938,35200911,2015-06-16,25613228,Rachel,The location at 206 Bell was phenomenal. We were able to walk nearly everywhere. There are a ton of great restaurants in the immediate vicinity and the apartment itself felt spacious and clean. We would absolutely rent this space again! 
5183938,35918393,2015-06-23,18516533,Dani,"This was our first Air BNB experience - it went without a hitch. Eve was great, we didn't need anything throughout our stay but she always maintained contact. Couldn't have asked for a better location, close to shops, bars, pike place market - walking distance to every attraction! If we ever come back to Seattle we would definitely stay here again. "
5183938,36523502,2015-06-29,7079426,Christina,"Our experience at Eves place was great. The place is neat, beautiful & within walking distance to everything.  And Eve is prompt at communicating. We are definitely use Eve's place when returning to Seattle. "
5183938,38111805,2015-07-13,31373872,Justin,We had a great experience!  The apartment was in an excellent location in relation to everything in the city.  Eve was there waiting on us when we arrived & checked in to make sure everything was going well.  She was very quick to respond when we had questions too.  The apartment was decorated very nice & we would definitely stay again at one of Eve's places when we are back!
5183938,38491205,2015-07-16,25730912,Becky,"We had a wonderful stay at Eve and Michael's beautiful apartment. Eve was very good about communicating with us before and during our stay. She met us early on checkin day to allow us to store our luggage so we could explore Seattle unemcumbered! The apartment had everything we needed with several nice touches showing that Eve pays attention to details! So nice! The apartment is in a great location! We walked to the Space Needle, Pike Place Market, and to the Bainbridge Ferry Dock. There are numerous bars and restaurants right there which was a huge plus for us! I would definitely stay here again when in Seattle!"
5183938,39272224,2015-07-22,31150356,Marnie,"Our stay here was very nice. Just as it is pictured. Also has a nice quiet roof top patio. The apt was clean, bright, airy and fresh.  Eve was very responsive when we had questions. Great location in terms of area amenities.  Lots of good places to eat and a couple grocers close by. 
We would stay here again definitely :)"
5183938,39556450,2015-07-24,38483759,JoAnne,"The location is perfect.  We didn't arrive at the apartment until around 10pm, after a long flight, and found many restaurants/bars within just a short distance.  It is a short walk to Pike's Market.  The apartment is very much like pictured and was fairly comfortable.  The lack of air conditioning bothered us a little but there are two fans that provided moving air and helped keep us cool.  And the rooftop patio is a nice bonus!  What a view!  Eve was a great host; she kept in touch with us and was very quick to respond."
5183938,40084962,2015-07-28,31420703,Stacy,"Everything was wonderful, and Morgan and Eve took care of every question we had. The location was perfect, and we walked to several wonderful recommendations (many recommended by Eve). We have no complaints at all!"
5183938,40571705,2015-08-01,31476469,Doug,"Eve made us feel very welcome.  We were met promptly after we texted and shown the ins and outs of the apartment and the building.  She even gave us a bonus bottle of wine! The apartment is fabulous, clean, modern and well furnished.  It has a beautiful view of the water and includes access to a roof deck with stunning views of the city.  We couldn't have been happier. The weather the week we were in Seattle was 90 degrees so we were provided with area fans and just opened the apt up at night which cooled it down quickly.  I would definitely stay here again.    "
5183938,43032413,2015-08-17,32008703,Danielle,"Enjoyed our stay, thank you!"
5183938,43660591,2015-08-21,33920675,Ilya,"We very much enjoyed our stay at Morgan and Michael's conveniently located Belltown apartment. The apartment was perfectly situated in the heart of Belltown amidst myriad restaurants and bars. Aside from some minor inconveniences with our keys (which Morgan helped alleviate with a gift certificate to a local restaurant) and the lack of air conditioning in the apartment, we were overall very happy with our stay. We would recommend this apartment to future Air BnB travelers. "
5183938,44104438,2015-08-24,32707733,Allison,"The accommodations were perfect for what we needed. It was clean and nicely appointed, and the bed was comfortable. The place doesn't have A/C, which was a little challenging since it was warm and we were on the 7th floor. Also, since we had to leave the window open at night due to the heat, the noise from the local bars, clubs, and restaurants made sleeping challenging on Friday night. That being said, the location was ideal for walking around the city, and there were plenty of really good restaurants right in the neighborhood. Overall we were happy with our stay."
5183938,45240747,2015-09-01,17598107,Susan,Morgan made us feel very welcome and allowed us to come into the apartment to leave our bags while we went to the Chihully museum.   It was a bit early so we appreciated her allowing us to do that.  She greeted us with a smile and a bottle of wine.   The place was great and we enjoyed the view and our closeness to everything.  We didn't have a car so we walked to all of the places we wanted to go.  Seattle is a great town and we felt like condo owners!  Furnishings were beautiful and spacious surroundings. We even did all of our laundry one night so we didn't have to take it home!
5183938,47030723,2015-09-15,26603874,Katie,"This place is the best! Perfect location, great amenities and lovely hosts! We would definitely stay here again! Thank you "
5183938,47895585,2015-09-21,1782724,Paul & Terra,"Awesome home away from home during our stay in Seattle! The apartment is beautiful and immaculately clean (as pictured). We loved waking up to the beautiful views of the water every morning. Location is super convenient to downtown attractions. Having laundry in the unit was a bonus. Daniela was an excellent host, very communicative. Would absolutely recommend and stay here again. "
5183938,48530381,2015-09-27,38024511,Henry,"The emailed instructions as to how to enter the block of apartments were unclear. We had to wait for someone to enter the block and follow them in. There was no information concerning the key which was left in the flat. We found out from another resident that the key also opens the door of the apetrment block. The apartment is not luxurious. The furniture is basic and the bed linen ordinary. In particular the pillows smelt. 
The TV does not work as a TV. It can be used only to watch films. We asked Daniela how it worked but she was unsure. When we tried it appeared that a code was required. We were not provided with a code. 
The detailed instruction that we received after we booked asked us not to make contact with other occupants or the manages of the flat. From this we inferred that Michael is sub-letting the flat. In a further email we were asked not to make too much noise as the occupant below was threatening legal action. All this left us feeling very uncomfortable. 
For the same money we could have stayed in on of Seattles better hotels. 
All in all very disappointing.  "
5183938,48975734,2015-09-29,36439046,Maruja,"The apartment was so beautiful, in the best neighborhood, clean...
Daniela was very helpful and I highly recommend this apartment "
5183938,50172549,2015-10-10,38230716,Andy,"Fantastic! Great location and very clean,bright and fresh apartment. We were made to feel very welcome during our stay. Hosts were very helpful. We would definitely love to stay here again. "
5183938,50812135,2015-10-14,45943722,Teresa,"Great location, wonderful neighborhood and close enough to Pike's Market to enjoy that area also. Our hosts were great, very quick to provide us with what we needed, within an hour, actually. "
5183938,51353691,2015-10-19,7965414,Jack,"Great trip! Despite our late arrival, check-in went smoothly. During our stay, Daniela was very responsive and attentive. The apartment was just as lovely as it looks to be in the pictures, and the location is fantastic."
5183938,55725079,2015-12-05,47646851,Peter,"Really nice location! Good view over the city (nice roof-top), rooms are clean and well prepared, check-in and -oit went easy.. Defenetely worth staying in this location while visitting Seattle!!"
5183938,56354958,2015-12-12,28939994,Doug,This is a great place to stay in Seattle. Super easy check-in/check-out. Place is as advertised. Comfortable bed. Quiet building. Great gym on the first floor. I only wish I got to spend more time there when I was in town. Will definitely go back!!
5183938,56827568,2015-12-18,6414308,Jeffery,"Clean, convenient and a super location in bell town. Thank you!"
5183938,57919236,2015-12-30,40474614,Carol,"Great place! Check-in/check-out was easy. Clean. Amazing location; walking distance to Pike Place Market, Seattle Center and so many great restaurants and bars. Highly recommend. Like in any major city, it's a little sketchy walking around at night but the place itself is awesome with a pool table, table tennis table and small gym downstairs."
2187563,13465838,2014-05-28,10900019,Adam,"Don was great. He emailed us confirmation and direction along with house rules the day before our arrival. He greeted us as soon as we checked his place. It's a lower level of his home. Beds are comfortable. The place was clean and just like the posted photos. Plenty of towels, blankets, pillows for our party of 6 people. We rented a van so Don's home is just a short drive to town, and it's on a quite nice part of town. Over all we really enjoy our stay and definitely return to Don's place in the future travel to Seattle.  "
2187563,13661226,2014-06-02,12294989,Megan,"We had a great stay at Don's place in Wallingford.  The listing was just as described and perfectly accommodated our family of four.  The kitchen was well stocked, the place was very clean, and the books and kids' movies were appreciated!  Don and his family were just upstairs and were available as needed (in our case, he even delivered the supplies I needed to remove my daughter's splinter!).  The Wallingford neighborhood was quite nice... just wish I'd had more time to explore it.  We will definitely stay at Don's place again if it's available during out next visit to Seattle."
2187563,13979433,2014-06-09,14341442,Susan,"Don was a great host and the place is super. My partner's mom was going into surgery and it was a nice place to have to rest in between hospital stays. 
Kitchen is well stocked so if you want to cook there are plenty of pots, pans etc. 
The place was clean, beds were very comfortable, had Dish TV, wireless and off street parking (which is great to have in Seattle). 
Don's will be the first place I'd stay if going back to Seattle area. "
2187563,14173298,2014-06-13,16541350,David,"Don was extremely helpful in making sure all of details were set prior to my arrival. The fresh cookies on the kitchen table were also a nice touch. His place is clean and spacious and located in great spot in Wallingford. Just a 2 min walk to pick up an express bus to downtown and a 5 min walk for excellent Thai food (Djan's) on 45th. 
"
2187563,14274245,2014-06-16,6306092,Agnes,"This was a wonderful location for my family while visiting for my husband's graduation at the University of Washington. The apartment was clean and had wonderful amenities. It was well lit and felt like home. All off the bedrooms had colorful linens. The kitchen had everything they needed to have breakfast during our busy weekend in Seattle. The location was close to the UW and to 45th St. which had several restaurants and shops. The owner was wonderful, he brought warm chocolate chip cookies upon their arrival! Thank you! I look forward to booking this airbandb for future family and friend visits. My family loved the comforts of this home! Thank you Don!"
2187563,14626551,2014-06-23,15749949,Joshua,"Really enjoyed our stay. Very comfortable accommodation with all amenities provided. Lovely, quiet neighborhood close to everything we needed. There are some very nice walks in the area, and we enjoyed being close to the waterfront. It felt like home."
2187563,14760060,2014-06-25,2456697,Jasmine,"This Wallingford suite was pleasantly exactly what we expected: convenient, clean and efficient. The big, comfy bed and giant TV were pluses for us when we just wanted to hang out and relax. For some pro tips, hit up the BBQ and casual taqueria joints just a couple blocks away on 45th st. 

As for the host, Don was incredibly responsive and clear with directions. Highly recommended to couples and families! "
2187563,15088519,2014-07-02,11024850,Kohki,"My parents truly enjoyed the stay, the neighborhood was very nice and quiet and the room was very spacious and clean. Don was very responsive and it was very well prepared. I recommend it !"
2187563,15256038,2014-07-06,5537031,Conor,"The apartment was very comfortable and Wallingford is a great neighborhood to be based out of. Although I didn't meet Don, he checked in regularly and it was clear he wanted to make sure we had a good stay."
2187563,17567929,2014-08-14,8628388,Suzanne,"Excellent apartment in Wallingford part of Seattle.  The host Don is very welcoming and even brought us home-made cookies. Very responsive host. Gave us a great recommendation to Afghan restaurant (Kabul) with delicious food up the block. We enjoyed the neighborhood. Condo was spotless. It is a well set up two bedroom.  We had 5 people there for one night.  It is a basement but its halfway up, so it is much nicer than most basement apartments.  Without a doubt, I would stay there again."
2187563,17940458,2014-08-19,17225763,Ka-Lun,"Don welcomed us with some home-made cookies, which was very nice of him.  The unit was neat and clean, well-lit, and quite comfortable.  The neighborhood was okay.  One thing, though, that should be noted is about sound insulation with the unit above.  The apparent lack of good sound insulation resulted in disturbing noises; our stay would have been much better if the early morning noises were not audible.             "
2187563,21868771,2014-10-26,6639633,Paul,"The listing description was accurate and the location is great. Close to Zipcar and bus routes and lots of walk to food options. We slept six. The sofa bed is good in a pinch and better than just about every sofa bed I have slept on. The high quality comforter was a nice touch. Although no meals were prepared there, having wine glasses stocked was a nice touch for the couple of bottles we opened. The TV is very high quality and allowed us to see the Sounders clinch the Supporters shield. The landlord is very nice and conscientious and allowed an early check in and late check out. I would definitely stay again. The only reason for not giving it five stars is that sleeping for 6 is a stretch. For four or five people it is great."
2187563,23644204,2014-12-07,23314900,Sarah,We had a very pleasant stay. The hosts were more than accommodating to our needs (even bringing us their own high chair to use). The apartment was very clean with off street parking. Don was very responsive and easy to communicate with. We would definitely stay here again when we visit Seattle. 
2187563,24008385,2014-12-16,24346221,Kim,"Don's place was wonderful. This was my first trip to Seattle and my first time using airbnb and it could not have been a better experience. The apartment was spacious, comfortable, and very clean. There were plenty of towels and the kitchen was stocked with all the essentials: pots, pans, dishes. We were able to cook a meal while we were there which was really nice after eating out so much. The apartment is in walking distance of so many good restaurants and grocery stores. If I had to mention one thing negative, it would be the noise from the foot traffic upstairs but that's me trying to find something to say... Don and his family live upstairs. Noise is to be expected in the unit below. Overall, the airbnb was fantastic Don is an amazing host. He even brought us the most beautiful and delicious holiday cookies. I would definitely stay again the next time we're in Seattle! Thank you again Don!!"
2187563,29108413,2015-04-04,28197365,John,It was a great start to our vacation to arrive to homemade cookies on the table and an obviously clean and well kept up apartment.   The apartment was in great shape and the kitchen was well equipped.  This was our first experience with airbnb and will definitely do it again.
2187563,29456129,2015-04-07,28027535,Lisa,"Myself and two young children stay here at Don's. We felt very welcome and during our stay Don lent us a few things to make traveling with kids a little easier. I would stay here again in a heartbeat, plus I have told my friends about it too."
2187563,29786212,2015-04-12,30500441,Zach,Don made the experience easy. I felt comfortable in the house and it was very clean. The space was larger than I thought it was going to be. Access to washer and dryer is a huge +. I would definitely recommend staying there if you want to be close to downtown without the price.
2187563,30148629,2015-04-18,29870143,John,"Sweet light-filled basement apartment, with plenty of room for a family, fully stocked kitchen and appliances, and welcoming to pets.  
Very responsive and welcoming owner."
2187563,30632453,2015-04-25,30822712,Anna,"This place was perfect for the purpose of our visit Seattle with walking distance to the WU and with internet access providing the possibility to read mail and work a bit. 
Food stores can be found pretty close and as the apartment had a kitchen with the basic equipment, it was easy to do some basic/general cooking. There were also many restaurants close by for the days we did not want to cook... 
By bus, we could explore downtown Seattle on our spare time. It would have been a good idea to either check out the bus stops before arriving/getting the app but it worked out pretty well anyway.

Visiting in spring also provided us with a bonus of many very beautiful front yards to admire when walking around in the neighborhood. 

When the family was at home, it was possible to hear sounds of steps and muffled voices from the level above, but that did not bother us much."
2187563,31083341,2015-05-01,6626819,Philip,"Don's place is exactly as described, a wonderful place in a wonderful part of Seattle. "
2187563,31226520,2015-05-03,40205,Teri,"Lovely experience! This apartment is spacious,  clean and well-located. Beds were comfortable, the DVD/Tv worked great, and the host left a bouquet of fresh flowers to greet us. Seamless Air BnB experience."
2187563,32001823,2015-05-12,31928706,Ryan,"The neighborhood was beautiful and the apartment was very nice, just as described. However this is not the place to stay if you are not morning people. The family lives above the unit and to say they are loud in the morning is an understatement. Their kitchen is located directly above the master bedroom and beginning around 7am you can distinctly hear that they have at least 2 small children and a dog... running, screaming, barking, you name it. Seeing as we were on VACATION for the weekend, we really would have liked to sleep in. We attended a concert on Friday night that went until late, and we ended up getting only about 5 hours of sleep that night because of the noise. If we had known there was going to be a crying baby, we would not have chosen this place for our getaway. If you are a family who also has young children, or you are early risers, then this is a lovely house. Otherwise, here's your warning, because there was none in the listing."
2187563,35219982,2015-06-16,25750902,Joey,"My family had a great time at Don's place. Really quiet neighbor, and many nice restaurants.  "
2187563,36527419,2015-06-29,31767448,Graham,The place was as described and perfect for our stay. The best part were all of the toys - my kids had an awesome time playing there!
2187563,36826104,2015-07-01,9931047,Dongchuan,"Don's apartment is clean and tidy, and has everything travelers need, highly recommend!"
2187563,43366421,2015-08-19,34148627,晨瑶,"Don's apartment was great! Clean,good location and it almost has everything we need! Don was very responsive and helpful,he lent us a few things including a large box of toys which made traveling with children easier,and tried his best to help us make sure all of (website hidden) family loved this place and we really enjoyed our stay."
2187563,43885289,2015-08-22,35940789,少霞,The experience is perfect. We had a comfortable staying in Don's place. The location is close to the downtown. It is very convenient.
2187563,44882788,2015-08-30,28105907,Kate,"We stayed here with my son and my sister's family, and it was the perfect place to reunite with family. Don was very quick to reply to emails and very attentive to answer questions. The place is really great, with a full kitchen perfect for family meals, and even a big box of toys and books that were very popular with my 2 year old son and nephew. The location can't be beat if you want to stay in a cozy quiet neighborhood. I highly recommend it. "
2187563,45729322,2015-09-05,24353387,Albert,"The house is in a nice and quiet location. Not close to the city center but if you're visiting by car it's really close.
The place was clean and all setup for us. We even had some delicious cookies on our arrival :)
The door works with a PIN, so it's pretty convenient if you're planning to check-in late at night."
2187563,48527325,2015-09-27,31085731,Craig,"We loved our stay with Don. Great neighborhood, location and apartment. Don was very accommodating and generous. Would stay here again in a heartbeat. Thanks again Don!"
2187563,49855869,2015-10-06,18609700,Dan,"The house was great, Don was very helpful, and the location is very convenient, close to UW and restaurants"
2187563,50337449,2015-10-11,14092826,Joseph,"Don's space was perfect for our needs. Very close to some excellent restaurants and bars on 45th, and within a 15 minute walk to the U District. The apartment was spacious and clean. Check in and check out were simple. Would stay again."
2187563,51244667,2015-10-18,37610217,Rian,Don's space was great. We were in Seattle for a college football game and it was right near where we needed to be. Also very accessible to bars and restaurants. It was clean and the neighborhood was quiet and peaceful. Would definitely stay there again.
2187563,53358163,2015-11-08,2459408,Kate,This was the perfect place for our visit to Seattle! A very comfortable and cozy place :)  Convenient location and lots of street parking made it easy to get everywhere.
2187563,54464423,2015-11-20,2989304,Jeff,"Don's place is everything you need in a SUPER walkable area, you can get to any type of store/restaurant in Wallingford in less than 10 minutes, downtown is 10 minutes away by car. It was the perfect place for us when we (a young-ish family) moved here and were waiting 2 weeks for our long term rental. 

The suite is very clean and warm (during the cold November rain), has all the necessary kitchen items, extra sheets as needed, and plenty of extra toys/movies for the kids. 

He was immediately responsive if we had any questions and, and even dropped off chocolate chip cookies when we first arrived. "
2187563,55875707,2015-12-06,50401505,Matt,"This was a great place. Awesome location, great price and fit four adults very comfortably! "
2187563,56258630,2015-12-11,2755718,Nick,Very nice 2bedroom suite that's close to everything. Don was very accommodating and I will be staying here next time I'm in Seattle.
5991734,33013383,2015-05-24,32686765,Matt,"The cottage was very nice, and even better than we expected from the posting. The studio cottage was spotless, well maintained and felt brand new. This was our first Airbnb experience, it was easy and well worth it. It was few blocks from the beach and totally quiet throughout the day and night. Jessica provided local information and good directions to the cottage and she was easy to work with."
5991734,33752741,2015-05-31,31754171,Rebecca,"Jessica was a wonderful host and she was easy to communicate with. The cottage/MIL hut was super cute, clean and cozy. I enjoyed my stay very much!"
5991734,34871265,2015-06-13,32758341,Richard,The description was accurate. We found the accommodations spotless and homey. It was a friendly and quiet neighborhood and made us feel at home as we have lovely gardens at our home as well. We appreciated the chocolate and the host checking in with us during the week to see if we needed anything. We would not hesitate to use this place again. 
5991734,35100712,2015-06-15,32378552,Liz,"Very beautiful and private studio cottage in west Seattle. 5-minute drive to Alki beach with shops and restaurants. Very clean, hostess is very friendly and easy to communicate with. Everything included to make coffee, tea, watch TV, and mini-fridge for food. Highly recommend!"
5991734,35808994,2015-06-22,22134925,Yudid,"The cottage was absolutely amazing.  It was quiet and serene.  We felt very relaxed with a beautiful lush green view out the windows.  Jessica was easy to communicate with and left a helpful, easy to follow guide with tips in the cottage.  I enjoyed the short walk to the beach, but beware of the steep hill coming back!  We found that walking to take a water taxi (only $4.75!) was more enjoyable than tackling the bus system and transfers.  You won't need to take much to the cottage, Jessica has it outfitted with just about every thing you would need.  Thanks for the coffee and helping to make our trip wonderful and relaxing.  

"
5991734,36029877,2015-06-24,33046127,Michael,"I did not get a chance to meet Jessica - We were only staying here one night, before we headed to the airport, and as an attempt to learn how it felt to be in West Seattle.  

The suite itself is great - Do keep in mind that it's a bit close to other houses, but it still feels very private.  The european-style bathroom may be a bit jarring to some if you aren't prepared for it, but it stands as a great example of one, and a good use of very compact space.  Unfortunately, the shower had an issue the morning we were leaving - Jessica was incredibly responsive, and the issue was repaired immediately, but we were already on our way out.  This isn't a negative mark by any means, as things happen -- Instead, I'd like to point out how responsive she was, and that the issue was addressed immediately.  I don't think you can ask for more than that.

There were plenty of books regarding the history of the area we had never seen laying on the coffee table, and the suite was fully stocked - No complaints there at all.

All in all, a pleasant stay - There aren't many options in West Seattle, this is one that certainly rises above.

"
5991734,36224785,2015-06-26,5895079,Renee,"The Hut was great!  As soon as you arrive, you know it's going to be a great place to spend the night. it's beautiful, the grounds are perfect. 
The space itself is nicely appointed. It has the most interesting bathroom!  There're is coffee for the morning. "
5991734,36701998,2015-06-30,23942988,Fred,"What a great little house! It's well furnished, clean, and welcoming. Fairly new construction but true to the Northwest Craftsman style throughout. Located perfectly...just minutes from Alki Beach and both West Seattle Junctions (Alaska/Admiral), and a nearby path takes you to the Schmitz Park hiking trails. Jessica has prepared a wonderful guidebook with lots of tips for activities, dining, and sightseeing. You won't go wrong here!
"
5991734,38134732,2015-07-13,32775307,John,"Jessica - thank you! We had a great stay at your property. Everything was as described and, honestly, nicer than we anticipated. The space is very nicely appointed, and quiet. Plenty of room for a couple. Location is very walkable to California St. restaurants and shops. Alki Beach is an easy, pleasant walk. Thank you for helping to make our stay in West Seattle a great one."
5991734,39224421,2015-07-21,37937958,Holly,"We had a great stay at Jessica's hut this weekend! It was beautiful, quiet, and a great location. Everything was clean and bright, and everything we needed was there. Easy access to sights around West Seattle and in downtown Seattle. We would definitely stay here again!"
5991734,40099556,2015-07-28,34310192,Nancy,"This was the perfect place for us!  Very clean, private, quiet.  We were able to walk all over West Seattle and go to the farmers market and Alki Beach.  The place was exactly as described and we loved the innovative shower bathroom combo!   Our previous airbnb was a total disaster so we are happy that this one was a such a success, and highly recommend it!
"
5991734,40471550,2015-07-31,36762612,Haodong,An excellent place to stay!
5991734,41398482,2015-08-07,29939135,Tasha,"Such a beautiful place to stay! One of the best airbnb's I've had ever. Very close to Alki beach and coffee shops. Clean and comfortable — the closest to a hotel I've been in, but cozier. I'd definitely recommend it!"
5991734,42264093,2015-08-12,6640193,Kate,"This was an EXCELLENT place to stay while visiting Seattle. The room was perfect! The bed was comfortable, everything was immaculate and just as described, and it was just a quick 15 minute drive over to downtown Seattle. Jessica was a wonderful communicator and very accommodating. It was nice to have a guaranteed parking spot in this nice little neighborhood. The price was right! The bathroom also gave us ideas on how to remodel our half bath in the basement of our own home! :) 
I would recommend this spot as a great place to stay. There was a binder with info on local attractions, and it was very close to beautiful Alki Beach. "
5991734,43392031,2015-08-19,24804759,Bella,"We love the place. Although the shower room is small, it's very clean and cozy. We would love be back again."
5991734,43637475,2015-08-21,34702318,Kyle,"My girlfriend and I had a great experience at the Hut. Check-in and checkout were super smooth. Jessica was well prepared and provided us with all kinds of information before the stay. The hut was very quiet, cozy, and clean. All the amenities we could've wanted were there. My girlfriend absolutely fell in love with the shower. We left with zero doubt that Jessica's Hut was the perfect place for us to stay and we will definitely recommend it to our friends traveling up to Seattle.

We both loved the location - we walked to Alki Beach several times. The nearby water taxi is an awesome way to get downtown. "
5991734,44124078,2015-08-24,28548394,Laura,"This place is a great alternative to staying at a hotel. It's located in a very quiet area. Very cute space, even though its only one room its still pretty spacious. The place was really clean except there was something crusty on the bedspread. Also I didnt like that we weren't aloud to go into the garden but overall this is a really nice place to stay for a night or two but wouldn't stay here for longer than that. We did not get to meet Jessica but she had very good communication with us prior to our stay"
5991734,45085870,2015-08-31,27045741,Robert,This is a lovely neighborhood and very unique as you feel like you are in a forested setting. Everything needed for recuperating from a day's touring or other adventures is comfortably available and well appointed. Would definitely consider staying again if business takes me back.
5991734,45510421,2015-09-03,2722799,Karina,"Jessica is a wonderful host! Everything was as advertised, all questions were answers really quickly. Best sleep ever! HighlyHighly recommended! "
5991734,47740938,2015-09-21,15398713,John,"We really enjoyed our time in ""The Hut"" as Jessica calls it. It is a charming apartment above a garage, and although it only has one room, it has everything you could want. The bed was really comfortable, and the bathroom was unique to say the least - toilet, sink, and shower all in the same space! But it works!  It was also nice to find a refrigerator and microwave and coffee maker available. The neighborhood is quiet and felt safe and we found an astoundingly good Greek restaurant (Kokora's) right down the street. The hardwood floors were really nice too. We would love to stay there again and probably will as we didn't have enough time to do everything we wanted to do."
5991734,48086936,2015-09-23,29604269,Glenn,"This was a lovely little home in a very peaceful part of West Seattle.  The home is beautifully appointed. It is extremely clean, includes coffee, wireless, bedding and towels.  The area is very quiet.  We loved our stay here and will be back!  Thanks again!  "
5991734,48744973,2015-09-28,42713839,Steve,We really enjoyed our stay in the cottage!  The location was peaceful and quiet and we loved exploring West Seattle.
5991734,49066490,2015-09-30,10531641,Thor,Such a great little spot! A total gem right next to a huge beautiful park. I would highly recommend to anyone looking for a sweet little spot a little outside of downtown Seattle. I also spoke briefly to the homeowner and she was wonderful.  
5991734,49650710,2015-10-05,25706020,Jennifer,"We had a great time staying at the Hut in West Seattle. Jessica quickly responded to any questions that we had & made great suggestions for some local hikes/restaurants. Although West Seattle is a little further out from a lot of the city activity, it was only a $15 Uber ride if you want to avoid driving/parking downtown. Unfortunately we never had a chance to try out the famed water taxis due to timing. The cottage itself is very charming & had everything that we needed for a long weekend stay. We really appreciated the mini fridge & the hairdryer. We would definitely stay here again if we ever make it back to Seattle."
5991734,50939306,2015-10-16,20576681,Darren,"The Hut is a cozy, quiet, clean, comfortable spot in a great West Seattle location.  Jessica had available all the necessities for our stay and then some - including the delicious Theo's chocolate bar she left for us.  Thanks!"
5991734,51311604,2015-10-19,9707508,Christine,We had a such a great stay! Place was great location and the perfect size for a week-end away.
5991734,52065651,2015-10-26,25583414,Mary Kay,"My husband and I visit our daughter, and her little family of two almost every 2 months.  We chose an Airbnb property to book this time for it's privacy.  The property, listed as a Lovely Wooded Mother-in-law space, with the ""entire home/apt"" available to us was exactly what we were looking for.  The cottage was exactly as featured on the web site. The cottage was very warm, and inviting, the location perfect to get around where ever we wanted to go..And it also featured a wonderful European Bath that reminded us of our travels abroad.    On this visit, which happened to fall a week before Halloween, allowed us to participate in the West Seattle Harvest Festival, with the Farmers Market at it's peak, and the Halloween parade, lead by the West Seattle HS marching band, we could not have had more fun.  We believe all of West Seattle turned out for the event.  We also drove out to the country, and visited Jubilee Farms, a Washington Land Trust Property for pressed hot apple cider, pony rides, a pumpkin trebuchet throwing!!!  Wonderful!  We felt like we were home, at the  Lovely Wooded Cottage..We also constructed a mermaid costume for our 2 year old grand daughter.  The best!"
5991734,52553100,2015-10-30,46245685,Greg,Everything about this experience was positive! Home was very clean and comfortable. Neighborhood felt safe and was right where I needed it to be. The host was quick to respond and easy to communicate with.
5991734,54163445,2015-11-16,12128757,Christopher,Jessica was great. The place was clean and cozy and the photos were accurate. The only unfortunate part was the bed sagged a bit in the middle - nothing a new mattress won't fix. We enjoyed our stay.
5991734,55218660,2015-11-29,5658078,Lee,"We were very happy with our stay in ""the hut"". It has to be the prettiest hut anyone has ever stayed in. It's nicely laid out and very well furnished, with a comfortable sofa and living area, good lighting, thoughtful kitchen area, and tiny but excellent bathroom. People shouldn't be deterred by the European shower arrangement- it's clever and great! The hut is a little hard to find, and the path to it is kind of off-putting, but once you're there, the entrance and setting are lovely. We hope to stay there again."
5991734,56487793,2015-12-14,573378,Justin,Stayed here twice now and it's fabulous.  Nice quiet location.  Very clean.  Numerous small touches like a chocolate bar on the coffee table and extra shampoo/conditioner in the cabinet.  We will stay here every time we're in West Seattle.
7674720,46840789,2015-09-13,43051444,Shawn,They made me feel at home right away with the cookies and beer.  The area was great and quiet and just relaxing place to stay.  It felt like you were staying in the country  but in a city setting.  Very very nice.  
7674720,48250328,2015-09-24,34921745,Derek,"Jonathan and his wife were gracious hosts. They truly made me feel welcomed into their home. Had some good conversations, provided numerous recommendations, and a clean, comfortable room. Public transportation is just a block away and easy to get to/from downtown."
353039,1621069,2012-07-03,2401945,Barb,"#300 was a large and comfortable apartment for the four of us.  Great location, we walked everywhere.  Had a great time in (email hidden)anks so much to Johnny also, very friendly and helpful host :-)"
353039,3708024,2013-03-06,2652793,Lauren,"We had a great stay here! Host was readily available to answer all questions very quickly via email/phone. Apt was lovely - just as expected. The location was absolutely perfect for our visit and desire to stick mostly to the Capitol Hill area, but not too far from downtown/water. A QFC is literally across the street and so helpful for last minute items and to make breakfast at the apt. We definitely recommend!"
353039,6101829,2013-07-30,5925779,Max,"Our stay at St. John's was wonderful.  We arrived a bit before check-in time and the apartment was already clean so they let us in early.  The place is very comfortable, even with 4 people.  The living room is a nice place to relax, with big windows that get a lot of sunlight.  The bed is big and the fold out couch is definitely sizeable enough for two people, and it's pretty comfortable.  The location is great.  It's right in Capitol Hill, with lots of bars and restaurants nearby.  And Downtown is only a short walk away.  Couldn't ask for anything more!  We really enjoyed our stay here and would definitely come back."
353039,7273215,2013-09-14,6988380,Diane,"This apartment was exactly as described and we were thrilled.  It was stocked with items and amenities that we didn't even realize we would need until we got there.  They thought of everything!
The neighborhood is very ""urban"" so be sure you're comfortable with that.  The location is perfect and we were very pleased with the nearby grocery store and restaurants.
I met Johnny once and he was very nice.  We enjoyed his unobtrusive attitude and felt ""at home"" right away.
Thanks to all involved!  We had a wonderful week!
"
353039,7874544,2013-10-07,3142715,Vickie,"The apartment was centrally located and secure. We walked to just about everywhere we wanted to go. It was very clean with every amenity -- including coffee. Very good restaurants nearby.  Since this is an urban area, the only issue was the drama outside in the wee hours of the morning plus there is no elevator so pack bags accordingly! Christine was a wonderful host and returned our phone calls promptly. "
353039,11401345,2014-04-01,4024997,John,"What an amazing trip! We had such a good time at this spot, it was perfect for what we needed. Christine was the perfect liason and really helped us get in and out comfortably. What I loved about this place was the comfortable bedroom, and the access to so much of the Capitol Hill nightlife. The apartment building had a lending library of DVDs, so I even managed to watch Thor 2...a hidden perk! I am excited to head back to Seattle and I will definitely be calling Christine again. If I had one complaint, it would be the stairs, which were fairly hefty, but by no means a deal breaker. Thanks again, and please stay here when you go to the Emerald City!"
353039,19268981,2014-09-09,3625064,Charles,This apartment was prefect for us and it's located in the best spot. This location was super clean/quite and extreme comfortable! If you're looking for a good spot to call home while you're in Seattle this is the place. Thanks again for hosting us and I look forward to coming back to stay at this awesome apartment!
353039,20006276,2014-09-22,17382922,Norma,"Christine était sur place à notre arrivée pour nous accueillir, nous aider gentiment à monter nos bagages au 2e étage (pas d'ascenseur) et répondre à nos questions. Un concierge est aussi sur place pour aider au besoin. Malgré son aspect vieillot, l'appartement était impeccable, pratique, le lit de la chambre était énorme et très confo, le divan-lit ferme mais confo aussi, 2 TVs, grande épicerie ouverte 24h en face, dans le coeur d'un quartier ""alternatif"" de Seattle. Restos et bars abondent dans les alentours alors nous avons peu cuisiné.

Les gens de cette ville sont passionnés et enthousiastes (en anglais ""LOUD!""), ce qui se traduit par des niveaux sonores élevés, nuit et jour. Si vous voulez dormir la nuit, n'oubliez surtout pas vos bouchons d'oreilles! Les vendredi et samedi soirs, nous avons eu droit à des cris (voire hurlements), aboiements, percussions, klaxons, musique vrombrissantes de voitures attendant aux feux de circulation et démarrant sur les capeaux de roues, et ce jusqu'à 4h du mat. 

Nous avons tout de même aimé notre séjour, le prix raisonnable de l'appart par rapport aux hôtels et le fait qu'en 15 min de marche on était au centre-ville. Je le recommande aux jeunes gens venus apprécier la vie nocturne mais pas aux familles avec enfants ni aux personnes âgées ou avec le sommeil léger."
353039,21961984,2014-10-27,12274932,David,"Great location. Walking distance to many great Capitol Hill restaurants and bars.  Clean, spacious apartment with comfy bed.  Christine was very friendly when checking us in.  We would definitely stay again."
353039,28368786,2015-03-22,27374254,Mellissia,"Because of a change in travel plans, I needed to find a place to stay in the Capitol Hill area and literally only had a few hours to find one. When I saw this listing was available, I requested to reserve it and was greatly relieved to receive a friendly confirmation from Christine in less time than I had even hoped. When I arrived, she gave me a tour of the building and wanted to make sure I had what I needed, including a parking permit. Although this apartment is located in a fantastic area  where one can walk to countless stores, restaurants, bars, etc., I needed to use my car and was thrilled to be able to park it so close by. The apartment itself is huge! I loved the furnishings and touches that almost felt like I had gone back in time to an earlier era when this building was newer.  It was a bonus to have a QFC across the street and a Starbucks on the next block.  :-)"
353039,35367839,2015-06-18,27462940,Alex,"I didn't actually meet Christine, but the building manager, Johnny, was great. He was very helpful when the drain in the bathroom clogged and even carried my suitcase up the stairs when I arrived. The apartment is nice and cosy with lots of helpful amenities, but is actually quite loud at night. There is a pub across the road and another one right downstairs. If you are a light sleeper, I am not sure that this apartment is right for you. Further, Christine told me that they would hold my bags as I had a late flight. What she actually meant was that I could leave my bags unattended in one of the rooms in the building that all of the tenants have access to. Considering I had my laptop and other valuable items with me, this made me very uncomfortable. Otherwise, the apartment was lovely and clean and very close to lots of things to do, see and eat."
353039,36266889,2015-06-27,28630124,Per,"Comfortable and clean apartment.
Cool part of town. 
Plenty of  restaurants and bars close by. Walking distance to downtown. 
Will recommend this place. "
353039,38655013,2015-07-17,37154398,Stacie,"We had such a great time staying here! Our unit had air conditioning, which is rare for Seattle apartments and a welcome surprise. The neighborhood was so lively. Lots of cool places within walking distance. Johnny was a wonderful, personable host and his 3rd floor art is hilarious. We stayed in a lot of places during our trip, but this place was our favorite. Thank you Christine & Johnny!"
353039,44143673,2015-08-24,27872109,Ted,"Great apartment in a great location! Very clean and spacious, great for entertaining. Only criticism is the noise from the crowd outside the QFC. Bring earplugs for sleeping."
353039,44559914,2015-08-27,27080324,Holly,"Location was fantastic, l loved being in among all the little shops and micro-creameries (some of the best ice cream I've had).  The tap water was weird - the 'cold' side was often hot, but the building manager was working on it. Christine was very accommodating and friendly.  It was a little bit noisy, but I didn't find it a problem (there was a white noise generator we didn't use, and the AC covered any other noise)."
353039,45114458,2015-08-31,39281066,Chris,"Our experience with apartment 300 was absolutely phenomenal. The room was clean and the furnishings made the area feel warm and welcoming. The Host, Christina, was incredibly friendly and accommodating. We were absolutely satisfied with the apartment and would definitely rent again if given the chance!"
353039,46703746,2015-09-13,16883825,Gavin,"Myself, wife and son all enjoyed our stay at St. John's apartments. Christine was easy to contact and very accommodating. She met my wife early at the apartment as she and my son were in town earlier than myself. The apartment was large, well furnished, clean and comfortable. There was even a guide in the apartment that recommended restaurants and gave details about the apartment. It was within walking distance to my conference but in the capitol hill neighborhood which is full of restaurants, coffee houses and shops. The apartment tenants were quite though the transient population outside were loud at times.  Overall we had a great time."
353039,53554569,2015-11-09,47932372,Nipunn,"Nice apartment in capitol hill area. Walkable to downtown. QFC grocery store across the street. Neighborhood can be a little loud at night, but wasn't an issue for me. Apartment had a huge DVD collection which was definitely a plus! Christine was responsive during booking."
7208439,42215426,2015-08-11,13646102,Ellen,"We had a wonderful stay in Jiang's apartment.  The location is terrific, with views of Lake Washington and Jiang's lovely garden.  The lake is a short walk away and once at the lake you can stroll or jog along the lakeshore for miles.  Great neighborhood restaurants within walking distance too.  Easy access to UW ( I was visiting my daughter who is a student there) and Seattle. Convenient for the airport also.  The apartment is charming and comfortable with everything you need.  And Jiang is a wonderful host, made us feel very welcome.  We will be back!"
7208439,42609645,2015-08-14,40594847,Dustin,"This was my first Airbnb experience and it could not have been better. JoAnn was the most gracious host we could have asked for and the space was immaculate, comfortable, and perfect for our stay. The location was amazing, among beautiful homes along the water. The water view from the space was hard to beat and the location to downtown was extremely convenient.

Could not say enough good things about this space and the host. We will definitely be back if we are ever in Seattle."
7208439,42962623,2015-08-16,39074538,Annie,"This is the first time that I used airing and this place left very good impression on using it. I had a very good stay for a couple of nights. The location is very convenient and her place is very clean and well kept. Also the host, Mrs. Jiang is kind and very welcoming too. She made sure we were comfortable. She even offered an umbrella for us to use when it was raining. 
There are trails for us to run along the lake and many restaurants in walking distance. 
If I use airbnb in Seattle again, I'd definitely go back to her."
7208439,43298547,2015-08-18,2079959,Marilee,"JoAnn is a great host! There were nice touches throughout the airbnb, making this a warm inviting place to stay. The patio was wonderful with a wonderful view of the lake and Mt. Rainier. There are great city walking paths nearby and it is walking distance to great restaurants.  JoAnn had a wonderful map with these places listed. JoAnn also had coffee, tea, and other breakfast items available for her guests. "
7208439,44251144,2015-08-24,41768614,Jonathon,Excellent host. Jiang was extremely friendly and Helpful with timely communication and clear instructions. The unit was very tidy and some lovely snacks were provided. Amazing location and close to downtown Seattle. Would highly recommend this property to anyone wanting to stay in Seattle 
7208439,45138261,2015-08-31,40562738,Artem,"The apartments are pretty spacious with an awesome lake view. The grill is perfect and helps you feel an instant american way of life, sitting on a terrace with steaks on a dinner.=) The host is very helpful - Joann does her best to make the stay unforgettable!"
7208439,46300471,2015-09-09,11333646,Seth,"JoAnn was incredibly gracious, kind, welcoming and just an overall positive and warm person. I didn't personally stay in the unit as I reserved it for my parents, but they were extremely happy with their stay and would stay again any time they come visit. They said the bed was super comfortable and they slept well every night -- which is saying a lot for them."
7208439,46941301,2015-09-14,10624389,Cindy,"We had an AMAZING stay at JoAnn's apartment last week!  JoAnn was a wonderful and thoughtful host -- she was easy to communicate with & was always available to answer questions and help with anything that we needed. 

The apartment itself is well equipped and spacious & we even had fresh tomatoes from her garden!!  It's in a beautiful location near Lake Washington (with incredible views of the lake) and the neighborhood is lovely & quaint.  Yet, it's also close to downtown as well as many cute neighborhoods nearby.  We loved exploring Seattle (what a beautiful city!) and coming home to JoAnn's peaceful apartment.  It was an awesome experience -- highly recommended!! "
7208439,48548619,2015-09-27,20840331,Deb,"This was a very pleasant surprise.  First, we drove into the neighborhood and thought we must be in the wrong place because it was so nice.  Then we saw the great view from the prior patio overlooking Lake Washington.  So nice and relaxing.  The apartment was cozy, very clean, and had all of the amenities and more.  Also, it is centrally located so everything we wanted to do and see were close by.
JoAnn was a great hostess and very responsive throughout the booking and rental process.  Her attention to detail was wonderful and it made our trip very enjoyable."
7208439,48966846,2015-09-29,41112217,Steven,"Jiang was great. I unfortunately did not get a chance to meet her but hope to in the future as I am a local guest. Even being across the globe she maintained great communication and ensured we were able to easily gain access to the unit.

The view was fantastic and we enjoyed grilling on the porch with the overlook after a long day of hiking. The unit is very well kept, clean and laid out very well. Highly recommended! "
7208439,50100062,2015-10-09,4732002,Joy,"JoAnn was a great host!  My mom stayed at her place when she visited us in Seattle.  JoAnn made sure the place was clean and everything was prepped for my mom's visit.  She was helpful, friendly and kind - everything you could ask for in a host!"
8704438,49869848,2015-10-06,37431044,Taylor,"I had to book a very last minute business trip to Seattle and all hotels were booked. Jason responded to my inquiry very quickly and was very accommodating to my schedule, which is the most important element for my trips. Additionally, the place itself was very clean and met all expectations. Great location as well! "
8704438,51069381,2015-10-17,18668487,Benjamin & Aysha,"We couldn't speak more highly about our experience staying in Jason's downtown apartment. So many amenities that helped us to feel very comfortable and ""at home"". We were so happy to have a kitchen to use, wonderfully fast wireless internet, great media options, amazing views of the city, and in close proximity to so many great restaurants and shops. The memory foam bed was also very comfortable. The off street parking was invaluable! The price of Jason's space was far and above more valuable  than the offerings of local hotels, which didn't include parking in their price. Jason was kind, flexible, and responsive. We would highly recommend staying here for a great time in Seattle!"
8704438,51494705,2015-10-20,41462554,Jerry,"Jason's place is impeccable!  The furnishings, decor, and extremely comfortable bed made this a very pleasant two night stay.  This location is in the heart of downtown Seattle, which makes for a vibrant, urban, hip experience.  Less than a 10 minute walk to the Fish Market, straight down Pine.  I have found a new place to stay when in Seattle.  Nicely done Jason!"
8704438,52536706,2015-10-30,2819319,John,"Jason was a great host. He was very communicative in the lead up to the visit and everything was as he said it would be. The internet connection was blazing fast, the place was spotless, and I felt very comfortable there.

It's located just off the main part of Seattle's downtown, so it's very central and easy to get places.

A highly recommended place to call home for a few days."
8704438,54009555,2015-11-15,36292647,Jayneil,"If you are planning to stay in Seattle,  this is hands down the best place to stay! It's affordable as well given the amazing view and being in central downtown. Everything is within a couple of blocks - waterfront, pike market,  restaurants, night clubs etc. 

Jason(host) has really kept the place clean and well maintained. Also he replies to your very quickly. The unit also has a big TV with soundbar and Netflix."
8704438,56819877,2015-12-18,38881476,Mark,"WOW,

What a great place! Easy access to anywhere in the Seattle area, beautiful view, washer/dryer, underground parking, I could go on and on...

I was here on business and found this apartment to be sooooo much better than a hotel room. 

Jason couldn't have been more accommodating.  There is nothing about this property that you could be disappointed about!"
8704438,57211058,2015-12-23,20246294,CheryL,"the apartment is spacious enough for 2 people. very centralise and close to the monorail if you plan to head to the space needle. the apartment also has great facilities; gym, shuffleboard, swimming pool and some scoccer machine game. Jason was accommodating and nice enough to extend our check out timing a little later."
8704438,58194806,2016-01-01,7449972,Jordon,"What an incredible stay! Everything was just as it appeared, and I could not have asked for more informative hosts. Will definitely be back. "
2391699,13639510,2014-06-01,6245026,Jack,"Sandy was by far the best AirBNB host I have had to date and I suspect will have. Her home is very comfortable, she is very welcoming and I couldn't have had better suggestions of what to see and do in and around Seattle. And on top of all that we went trail walking on my last day and talked non-stop about everything from philosophy to dog food. Thank you Sandy!!"
2391699,13990195,2014-06-09,14943776,Chris,"Sandy has a beautiful home which is close enough to the city to explore Seattle in the weekends but also quiet enough to calm down after work. Even though I never had a dog before, I had a ton of fun interacting with her two dogs, who were super friendly and well-behaved. Sandy was a great host herself too, we always had something to interesting to talk about and she was willing to help me when I needed it. Having never been in Seattle before, I couldn't have gotten a better welcome than I did from Sandy!"
2391699,14481565,2014-06-20,7678373,Neha,"I had a lovely time at Sandy's place. The neighborhood is perfect and close to everything, especially to direct buses to UW, which was valuable for me. Sandy was very friendly and respectful, and her dogs are really cute! I would totally stay there again..."
2391699,16916887,2014-08-04,96949,Annette,"I enjoyed my stay at Sandy's place very much. Sandy is a wonderful host, always open for a nice chat but also totally respecting one's privacy. Plus she gave me tons of good advice about what to do and see in Seattle!
Her house is nicely furnished, perfectly clean and the dogs are well behaved. It is in a lovely residential neighbourhood, close to Downton Fremont and bus stations. Thanks again for your hospitality, Sandy!"
2391699,17952133,2014-08-19,18271102,Mara,"What a great choice!  Sandy made me feel welcome and had great recommendations.  The space was clean and comfortable.  The neighborhood is really nice with local options for food and walking around.  Public transportation is within walking distance; you can catch a bus and be downtown Seattle in 15 minutes.  Sandy's dog, Jax, is awesome and enjoys petting but is also very relaxed and laid back.  When I go back to Seattle, I will definitely stay here again!"
2391699,18091068,2014-08-21,14694583,Yegor,"Sandy was a great host, very welcoming and hospital. The room provided was just as described - very clean, and suitable for short or long term stay. I would highly recommend."
2391699,18318229,2014-08-25,17611850,Shauna,"Sandy was a wonderful host and made me feel like I was staying with a family friend rather than a stranger! I've been to Seattle before but not in a very long time and this was the first time alone. Sandy provided me with great tips for my trip regarding traveling around town and to and from the airport and destinations to visit. The room was perfect and comfortable. The area had some construction going on but it was hardly noticeable, the neighborhood was very quiet. It was very easy to get to the touristy areas in Downtown Seattle and the Seattle Center. The Fremont area was great to visit too though and I had a great time walking around the area. Staying with Sandy was extra nice because I felt like I had someone to talk with and check in with, which added a feeling of safety for traveling alone. I would absolutely stay with Sandy again and recommend her to anyone traveling to the area."
2391699,20739185,2014-10-05,17738994,Rob,"Sandy was very welcoming, and very helpful (and provided very helpful directions).

The room (and the house generally) was very nice. The bedroom was very nice, with a large en suite shower room.

The location was good, and I felt safe walking home after dark."

2391699,22339025,2014-11-03,12459050,Rupika,"I had such a rejuvenating time staying at Sandy's home. She is adorable and the stay was perfect. The room is beautiful, bright and very clean. The house is very well connected by public transport and has tons of good restaurants and coffee shops. I Couldn't have asked for a better host and such a safe and beautiful place to stay.   "
2391699,22545354,2014-11-09,16414552,Joel,"I got a wonderful hostess , the place is described exactly as written .
Sandy has been a great help to reach places , which bus to take , where it was good to eat , and in particular was the focus of a good conversation on the way .

Highly recommend for those looking for a quiet and safe holiday fun ."
2391699,22716368,2014-11-12,6446844,Mira & Susheel,"Sandy is a warm and welcoming host . She is great company and goes well with a hot mug of tea on a cold Seattle evening !

A terrific location , that lets you explore Fremont on foot.. "
2391699,22949044,2014-11-18,4228387,Leona S.,"Sandy was a warm and wonderful host; she was clear in all communications, thoughtful in laying out details for guests, and just great for fun & insightful conversation! The room was exactly as described; clean, safe, and comfortable. The location was very convenient. Overall, this room was everything my sister and I were looking for in our Seattle trip - I will definitely book again with Sandy in the future!"

Tivemos ótimas conversas, incluidos caminhadas pelos parques da região, ela sempre me perguntava como havia sido meu dia, muito atenciosa, até ganhei um presente de Natal. Novamente, Sandy e o quarto são incríveis!!!"
2391699,24068899,2014-12-18,1621548,Sarah,"I only have one complaint, and that is that I didn't have enough time to stay longer! Sandy is terrific, her home is wonderfully clean, bright, welcoming, tastefully decorated - - and she's so fun. The room is exactly as pictured and described. Sandy has included so many personal touches such as extra personal items, extra blankets; just whatever you could wish for. 

There are plenty of power outlets for your own mobile devices, high speed internet, very nice lighting for reading and bedside tables for your 'stuff'. 

If you are planning on a visit to Seattle, Fremont, a unique section of Seattle, is a must-do, and Sandy's place is a must-stay. "
2391699,24127481,2014-12-20,24918420,Jason,We had a great stay at Sandy's. She is a very warm and kind person. I didn't spend much time in house but everything was great and the dogs were very adorable too. The house is located very close to Downtown Seattle (by drive) and I-5 freeway as well.  
2391699,24420194,2014-12-28,3191263,Ivy,"Sandy provided a very comfortable place to stay - it was warm (in-room temperature control!), cozy, with a nice bathroom. She gave me a lot of great information about the city."

The room and private bathroom were super clean and Sandy was very very nice, friendly and informative. I would definitely love to stay at Sandy's house again the next time I visit Seattle."
2391699,26331675,2015-02-09,17426730,Yan,"Sandy is so kind host for traveler and her dog (Jack) makes feel home during my stay. I booked a single bed room which is quiet and cozy and shower, wifi, air-cond, bed are all great. maybe the only thing  I can complain is the weather in Seattle but we are lucky to have the sun shinning in the Sunday for this time. 
The experience of living in Sandy's offering is great. I would rank 10 of 10 of this time.  "
2391699,26684020,2015-02-17,887083,Virginia,"I arrived at Sandy's home around 7:30 pm after a long day of travel. Sandy warmly welcomed me and oriented me to her home. I was in Seattle for a 4-day course, and this was a perfect place to stay. I was able to prepare light meals and Sandy was respectful of my privacy and at the same time, wonderful company when I was home. The house and room were very clean and nicely appointed, just as her listing describes. The location was wonderful, a quiet and pretty residential neighborhood near great shops and restaurants. I had everything I needed for a fun stay in Seattle. I would happily stay there again. Thank you, Sandy. highly recommended! "
2391699,26887597,2015-02-21,24727285,Nick,"Sandy is awesome.  She is a wonderfully pleasant person and she is very helpful with giving you the layout of the neighborhood.  The place is clean, comfortable, and I had everything I needed.  The key-less entry and the private temperature control in the room are both very convenient features.  Sandy has a medium-sized dog named Jax and he growls a bit when you first meet him but he is really well-behaved and is just being protective.  The bed is a twin bed but it is quite comfortable and I am a rather large guy and it worked just fine for me.  I am in Seattle often and look forward to staying with Sandy again in the future.  I definitely recommend. "
2391699,27023169,2015-02-23,27179457,David,"Sandy was very friendly, accommodating, and helpful in figuring out things to see in Seattle. The room was nicely appointed and very clean. Access to downtown by bus was easy, with only a couple minute walk to the bus stop. Would definitely consider staying here again next time I am in Seattle!  "
2391699,27176420,2015-02-27,7057324,Amanda,"Sandy was a wonderful host. She was very warm and welcoming and made me feel right at home. She was great to talk to and had great recommendations for things to do and places to eat. Her place is beautiful and in a great location. It is very close to downtown, only about 10 minutes by bus to anything you need. The bed was really comfy and the in-room temp control was great. My only complaint was that I couldn't stay longer! I would definitely recommend staying with Sandy."
2391699,27352400,2015-03-02,1789855,Anand,"Sandy's house is warm, inviting and extremenly comfortable. I reached a couple of hours earlier than expected but Sandy had already ensured my room was ready and I was checked in no time! That speaks volumes about Sandy as a host! The room itself is neat and comfortable and has a very good view. As suggested, her house is very close to a lot of fine restaurants and Seattle downtown. Cab costs about $15-20 to get there. There are buses that go and are also convenient but I didn't use them. 
Being in the pet industry, Jacx was really the highlight for me! He is such a friendly boy and was always ready for a scratch-behind-the-ear. Sandy has trained him to retreive the mail and such a cute sight to watch! 
If I ever have the opportunity to return to Seattle, sandy's house is the place to be!"
2391699,27507138,2015-03-06,21152785,Albert,"Wonderful place to stay. Room was comfortable and had its own toilet, sink, and thermostat. The location is great, needing only a 15-20 minute bus ride to downtown Seattle. 

Sandy is an excellent host. She was very nice and knowledgeable about the area. She does have two dogs so that is something to consider if booking.

She also shared many interesting insights on the local politics of her community."

The location is really nice, putting you in a gorgeous neighborhood with a lot to explore, but not far from downtown and the rest of the city. The room is nice and quiet, with nice natural light and air. The space is immaculate and very welcoming. Sandy is a great host and I definitely recommend this place."
2391699,29050733,2015-04-03,27076433,Edith,"Sandy met me at the door when I arrived and welcomed me into her home. She showed me around the house, telling me things like kitchen use, recycling, and so on. Most helpful were the info sheets on the bedside table: one a walking guide of Fremont neighborhood and the other a list she had made of neighborhood food spots. I used both of those extensively. Sandy was actually gone for a good part of my stay, but left me feeling very welcome and with enough knowledge of the house that I was quite comfortable. "
2391699,29151851,2015-04-04,29572241,Ty,sandy was great.  wasn't there long.  everything was smooth and easy!
2391699,29328871,2015-04-06,4634690,Hellen,Sandy is such an elegant nice lady! She gave me a house tour at first and then gave me a list of good restaurants or places to go in the neighborhood and Seattle. She also invited me to join her watching a great film! It was really fun hangout and communicate with her!
2391699,29493638,2015-04-08,19694863,Lindsey,Sandys place was exactly as listed. Room was very clean with plenty of natural light but also dark when you wanted it to be. Also was nice having my own bathroom. Sandy was very friendly and offered great suggestions for things to see and eat in the area. Also her 4 legged companions(Jax and Roux) were wonderful and gentle dogs. Sandy also was great with allowing me to store my bag after checkout time so I could continue to soak up my last little bit of time in Seattle unobstructed. Would recommend her place in a heartbeat. 
2391699,29591954,2015-04-09,3263848,Rufus,Sandy was a delightful host. I enjoyed getting acquained with her and sharing stories of hosting on Airbnb. The room was clean and comfortable and she made me feel quite welcome. 
2391699,29747993,2015-04-12,27136609,Omar,"My stay in Sandy's home could not have been any better. Before my arrival she provided detailed instructions of how to get there from the airport and that was very helpful. Once there, she provides you with information about the local neighborhood and suggests restaurants and other activities that you can do. The location of her home is particularly ideal! It was about a 15 minute bus ride to either UW or downtown and the bus stop is less than 5 minutes away. The room is exactly as it is described and depicted in the pictures. I will definitely stay here again next time I am in Seattle. "
2391699,29900071,2015-04-13,28008264,Alan,Sandy was a congenial host and made me feel quite welcome. Room was as pictured and the bed comfortable. Quiet street with convenient bus access to downtown and the UW. Difficult parking on the street in front of the house but available around the corner on a busy road that is well lit.
2391699,29929538,2015-04-14,29234434,Jean,ing with Sandy was wonderful.  Her house is clean and bright and Sandy herself is very friendly.  The Fremont neighborhood is fun to walk around with many small cafes and restaurants.  Fusion Beads is right around the corner which is the best bead store I have ever visited. I will definitely stay again when in Seattle.
2391699,30167854,2015-04-18,30968525,Nina,"Great room and surroundings!
Sandy is a very friendly and educated host. The room was exactly as shown in the prictures - cosy and tasteful.
The Freemont neighbourhood is a most idyllic and very nice and quiet place.
Thank you, Sandy!"
2391699,30364210,2015-04-20,30814008,Sheila,My stay with sandy was short but sweet! My private room was clean and very cozy. Sandy greeted me when I came in late and we chatted for a few minutes (wish it could've been longer). If I ever travel alone to Fremont again I'll rebook with her for sure! 
2391699,30434405,2015-04-21,10459959,Subhendu,"Sandy,
Very simple house rules. 
The room was perfect and well organized.
I had a good conversation and I had a sound sleep.
I will stay again if Sandy accepts a late night booking next time :)

2391699,31416920,2015-05-04,31688066,Travis,Sandy is the best! Was in a jam due to an unresponsive host and she saved the day with a late/last minute booking.  5 stars all around.  Thanks Sandy! 
2391699,31538281,2015-05-06,5784826,Raquel,"Staying at Sandy's house was the best experience I've had with airbnb so far. The house is great, better than a hotel, really good value and quite easy to get to downtown Seattle... and Sandy is lovely and so easy going. I wish I've had more time to talk to her, as I really enjoyed our little chats. I would recommend anyone going to Seattle to stay there. Thanks again for everything!"
2391699,31683256,2015-05-08,3029106,Victoria,"Sandy has the four star air bnb. Very clean and comfortable room with a private w.c. Excellent location near restaurants, shops, and transit."
2391699,31933463,2015-05-12,22056744,Yibin,"It is really a nice experience to live in Sandy's home. Although it is a pity that she wasn't at home during my visit, she asked her good friend Mary to make the reception for me. And I actually pay a room's price to get an upgrade to a house:p The house itself is very clean and tidy, making people feel at home. Besides, Fremont is really a nice neighborhood with all beautiful houses and peaceful environment. It is very sweet for Sandy to collect many useful information about Seattle and it did help especially when I was trying to find those statues. Overall, it is really a good place to live in Seattle and a good host to be expected!"
2391699,32511843,2015-05-19,887083,Virginia,"This was my second stay with Sandy. She's a wonderful host and it was like visiting with a friend. Her home is clean, comfortable, and inviting. She was helpful with suggestions about things to see and do in the area. I was in Seattle for a workshop and staying with Sandy worked out so very well. Everything about my stay went smoothly. I would not hesitate to stay with her again should my travels bring me to Seattle! "
2391699,32758599,2015-05-21,16890276,Stefanie,"Sandy is a great host, very welcoming and helpful. Got the best advice from her when planning to visit Bainbridge island. Thanks a lot! Her place is clean and cozy, bus stop to downtown is nearby and Fremont is a really nice area to explore that is not that much featured in popular tourism spot. Enjoyed the riverside and Theo chocolate factory tour a lot. Even some of my local Seattle friends don't know about that. "
2391699,33103531,2015-05-25,1741016,Maanek,"Sandy provided me with an incredible stay at her house in Fremont. Her neighborhood is unbelievably charming and safe. As advertised, the location is pretty much 0-3 miles from almost all points of interest in Seattle. She keeps the house very clean and comfortable for her guests and has a very friendly dog as well. Sandy is very conversational and knowledgeable about points of interest in town. She has her own routine, so it is likely that you will not always be around the house when she is present, but ask her for any pointers that only a local would know.
The Space Needle, the Queen Anne District, and Pike Place market are about 1.5-2 miles of walking away from her place. The UW campus has a nice running trail leading into Fremont, so there are many paths and locations to explore starting from Sandy's house.
Sandy has a very nice house and price for someone looking to venture into Seattle for a few days and I would stay for a second time."
2391699,33345657,2015-05-26,33907100,István,"What a wonderful host! Sandy was incredibly warm and welcoming, and her two doggies were very sweet and friendly. The room was beautiful and clean. Great experience!"
2391699,33657159,2015-05-31,28933525,Luke,"Sandy presented me with helpful maps and resources to getting the most out of the area. The space was clean, quiet, and inviting. I hope I can return soon!"
2391699,33979813,2015-06-03,24232478,Stella,"Sandy  was very welcoming and gave me a tour of her home and showed me my room. The room is exactly like the picture, clean and cosy.
Her home is blocks away from the Fremont troll and bus stop 16 which will take you to downtown Seattle.
I stayed for three nights and had a great time in Seattle.
"
2391699,34154635,2015-06-05,33779902,Randy,"This was my first time using Airbnb for lodging arrangements. It did not take me long to search of the perfect room. Rates and location was my top concerns. Combined with the numerous outstanding user reviews, I didn’t need to look any further. The request for scheduling, payment of reservation, and general questions via messaging with Sandy was not an ordeal and didn’t take a lot of time at all. Her prompt reply to my inquiry was within a few hours of me clicking the send request button. She and I kept in contact all the way up to my travel date. With the help of her suggested directions and Google Maps, I was able to locate the house without any problems in the dark as my flight arrived in the late evening. The  introductory and overview of her place was quick, to the point and welcoming. I slept very comfortable while there. I cannot thank Sandy enough for her kind hospitality and accommodations. I will definitely book her place again should I find myself traveling through Seattle again. I will also advise all my family, friends, and coworkers going to Seattle to consider staying at Sandy’s place. "
2391699,34250797,2015-06-06,15793055,Paulo,"Between car-smashing trolls and communist leaders, Fremont is a great place to visit with lots of bars, restaurants and parks.

As for the room, it was very clean and spacious, the private half-bathroom makes the experience more practical. My stay was short, but Sandy was very enjoyable to talk to and very helpful, letting me leave my bag during the afternoon and and making arrangements so I could pick it up a towel I forgot at the house.

Overall my stay was very enjoyable and I highly recommend Sandy and the room."
2391699,35194334,2015-06-16,4228387,Leona S.,"My sister &I have stayed with Sandy before, and yet again she was the most wonderful host. The place was excellent, as always. Sandy's completely amazing, kind, clear, and responsive. Definitely our #1 Seattle airbnb choice - it's everything we need in a place to stay and Sandy's the best!"
2391699,42814826,2015-08-16,27417481,Johannes,Sandy was a wonderful host. Always friendly and helpful. The place was exactly as advertised and I had a very pleasant stay during my two months in Seattle. I highly recommend her as an AirBnB host.
2391699,43901633,2015-08-23,28575265,Midori,Sandy Was  an amazing host. She made sure I was comfortable and knew my way around the city.

2391699,44395116,2015-08-25,18332744,Gerry,"This was just a one night stopover for me before I drove to San Francisco. I had done my sight seeing in Seattle during the day and got to Sandy's at 5pm. The room was perfectly as described, spotlessly clean and it was obvious that a lot of thought had gone into layout and guest needs. 
Sandy was warm, welcoming and such good company that I regretted that I hadn't booked to stay a little longer. 
"
2391699,44469407,2015-08-26,40990516,Cheng,"Fantastic experience! The room is clean and tidy, very comfortable, Sandy is so nice and considerable, she also shared a map with all the attractions nearby. I should stay here for more days, definitely."

She was kind and very lovely to chat with. She provided a nice, well kept room and even offered me plums from her garden...(yum!). Thank you Sandy for the stay!"
2391699,45242240,2015-09-01,32227775,Laina," Sandy was a delight to work with well before I met her. On the day of my arrival, I needed to drop off my bags before the set arrival time.  Although she couldn't be there at that time, she made sure that I could get in to her home, with directions that were clear.   The room looked exactly like the photo, clean and comfy.  When we did meet, I found her to be caring, personable, lovely, and warm.  She even lent me her athletic shoes when the changing weather caught me unprepared!  How many people would do that?  We had much in common, so chatting with her at breakfastime and chance meetings was a delight.  Her dog is a dear!  I pointed out a potential hazard with a piece of furniture--she accepted it graciously and began problem-solving immediately.  Sandy turned out to be one of the highlights of my trip. "
2391699,45560125,2015-09-04,12013517,Alex,"Sandy was incredibly gracious and accommodating. The room was excellent, the location wonderful, and everything was perfect. She even gave me two bags full of plums from her tree before I left. I'll stay again for PAX next time I go too if she's got an opening!"
2391699,45934983,2015-09-07,34764600,Nathan,Sandy welcomed me with her two very friendly dogs upon my arrival. She was very prepared and was the perfect guide for a first timer to the city. The room was very clean and just what I needed. Walking distance from everything in Fremont/Wallington!
2391699,47248988,2015-09-17,34309741,Anne,"I had a lovely 2 nights at Sandy's accommodation in the Fremont area of North Seattle.
The place was just as it looked in the photographs and was extremely clean.
Sandy was a very welcoming host and was very helpful in finding me alternative routes to places I was going, other than those suggested by my GPS, so that I could avoid traffic congestion. 
When I am next in Seattle, I would love to be able to stay at Sandy's again and would highly recommend her accommodation."
2391699,48161182,2015-09-24,29494550,Diane,"I have just spent a fantastic week in Seattle, visiting from England, and Sandy was the perfect host.  She was very helpful and friendly, and her home was exactly as described on Airbnb.  The house is very clean and tidy and it is a really good homely feel about it.  The neighbourhood is really good, and is perfectly placed for getting buses to Downtown Seattle and many other areas around Seattle.  It is within a 15-20 minute walk to everything that Fremont has to offer.  The room is a good size and the bed is very comfortable, with a good size wardrobe and large chest of drawers.  Sandy makes you feel very welcome in her home and I will definitely go back there again next time I visit my son in Seattle.  I would highly recommend this place to anyone."
2391699,48528510,2015-09-27,12763387,Brian,"Sandy's place is in a great location away from all of the crazy traffic in downtown Seattle. I found it very easy to get to the bus stop if I wanted to head downtown. There is also plenty to do nearby within a 20 minute walk.

The room had plenty of space to store all of my things and was very comfortable. The curtains blocked out nearly all of the light so I was able to sleep in everyday (even when I didn't plan to!).

Sandy is also a lot of fun to chat with. Be sure to get to know her if you have the time. Overall I had a great experience here!"
2391699,48714876,2015-09-28,18686753,Victoria,"Sandy's neighborhood is great for those seeking to stay in a more residential area of Seattle close to downtown proper and full of great cafes, restaurants, and bars.

Everyday she gave me recommendations based on where I was headed which were superb. Sandy also made me feel at home and was always happy to help or just chat. The location in Fremont is excellent with downtown a short bus ride away and Fremont accessible through walking.

I highly recommend anyone looking to immerse themselves in Seattle stay here!"

Adorable well-behaved dogs were a treat to be around. 
Sandy was always accessible and responsive. Highly recommend! "

The location is great, many bus stops and very close to UW and just about 15-20 minutes to downtown (Pike Place Market, China town, Pioneer Square...). The house is very clean and tidy, and i definitely fell in love with it. Sandy provided absolute privacy for me when i needed but also feel free to have a long chat with her because she is such a lovely lady who gives a lot of advices and suggestions.

I used the buses a lot during my 5 night stay, and the bus stops are a 1-2 minute walk from the house, and they run frequently. I did not have a problem getting around, $8 for the day pass on metro.

I stayed in the smaller room, and it couldn't have been more cozy. Clean, comfy, and super warm with its private heater. I was extremely satisfied!

Her house is nicely settled in the Fremont neighborhood, a quiet but quite active area, if one makes good use of the maps and the recommendation lists Sandy provides for her guests. Her two dogs are a great load of fun too! Her home is cozy and the room has everything one needs. The heater makes it especially comfortable in winter. Additionally, Sandy was very helpful and always around when I was in need of asking questions. The WiFi worked well and the mattress is super relaxing. All in all it was a great experience and I would definitely like to stay with her again!"
2391699,57771683,2015-12-29,30712729,Tam,Obviously Sandy is an amazing host from all her other reviews. I'll write about things that are not mentioned.  If you're a runner like me Sandy's place is ideal. It's 1 mile south of Green Lake.  Total distance to and around the lake and back is 5.5 miles. If it rains outside you can walk to the neighborhood gym 1 block away from Sandy's house and they charge $20 for a day pass or $50 for a week.  Awesome newer gym with nice equipment.  Sandy has plenty of street parking even in Seattle which is unique.  Her location is ideal because it's close to both 99 and I-5.  Getting around is a breeze. Sandy is a great find.
9151865,56329934,2015-12-12,21545556,Shinjae,"I stayed at Vivian's place since it was located in SLU, the area where I had to work for a few days. The place was clean, located in a very nice neighborhood. I didn't get the chance to meet Vivian personally, but her boyfriend and their friend welcomed me. The room was very clean and the place has a full kitchen that you could use. 

At first, I was disappointed that this place doesn't have a private bathroom which was different from the listing description. I knew this after I requested to book. One night, at around midnight, it was extremely loud that I couldn't sleep since Oscar and his friend were playing xbox until like 1am with a loud shouting. I felt like I am staying at college dorm :-(  Since I had to work, I wished it was more quiet at night and they were more considerate to guests. Another thing was that I had to call someone (their friend) to enter the house each time. Hope these are things that future guests might want to know before booking, and I hope Vivian and her friends who stay there can improve!  "
4395578,28706661,2015-03-29,11886545,Rana,"Great place in Ballard to stay in! Communication, check in, and checking out is all easy. Will definitely stay again!"
5630783,28443542,2015-03-23,29413223,Monica,"Chris greeted us upon arrival to their beautiful studio. The place was clean, well laid out, and exactly what we needed. This is a great  studio apartment in a wonderful location in Seattle with access to Greenlake and other cute neighborhoods. We would definitely stay again. "
5630783,28628040,2015-03-27,29583335,Michelle,Awesome location!! Reasonable price. Just enough space to be comfortable. Thanks for being a great host! 
5630783,29008589,2015-04-02,28910771,Robert,"Great location, comfortable private apartment--exactly as advertised. Our hosts were welcoming and respected our privacy.  Easy walk to the lake and good coffee shops!"
5630783,29757790,2015-04-12,1668000,Deb,"Great communication with host. Apartment just as described in a beautiful neighborhood. Close to public transportation, recreation shopping and restaurants. Very clean and well furnished."
5630783,30701352,2015-04-26,30303351,Megan,We loved our stay. Great hosts and fabulous location. Just a short walk to the heart of Tangletown and also to Green Lake itself. The place was cozy and exactly how it had been portrayed in the listing. Chris was welcoming and responsive and not in the slightest intrusive. Our experience here was an A+ and who can beat a few local microbrews in the frig as a surprise welcome to Seattle?!
5630783,30890526,2015-04-28,30779532,Renee,"This place is the perfect place to stay when visiting Seattle! The locale is wonderful as it's within walking distance of so many amenities, i.e. restaurants, coffee shops, the PCC Market (best grocery store ever!), and Green Lake is literally one block away and was a perfect place for my morning jog.  The neighborhood is peaceful and beautiful. It's close enough to the City to not be stuck in the car for a long drive when heading downtown, but far enough away to be outside of the hectic city pace and ambiance. The apartment itself is very lovely, extremely clean and obviously well-cared for, feels very ""homey"" and comfortable, and it has everything you need for a short or long stay. The hosts are great; they gave us a warm welcome and were completely accommodating. There is literally nothing bad to report whatsoever here. Many thanks to Chris and Maria for everything!"
5630783,31470776,2015-05-05,8050465,Brian,"Our family of 4 had a great time at Chris and Maria's apartment.  It was clean and comfortable, gets great light, and has semi-private sitting area outside. The apartment is walkable to the amazing Greenlake Park in one direction and to coffee, restaurants, playground, and market in the other. Both Chris and Maria were around, available without being intrusive, and very helpful with  suggestions and answering our questions.  Overall, a very lovely spot in a lovely quiet neighborhood. We'll definitely be back."
5630783,31791306,2015-05-10,6088670,Sharita,"Great location,  great space and I would love to revisit this location again."
5630783,32479774,2015-05-18,5051578,Ed,"Chris and Maria were perfect hosts; attentive and available for any help needed. The space is in a wonderful Seattle neighborhood as well.  It is an easy walk to Green Lake Park, good restaurants, and bus stops that will easily take you to any part of Seattle.  Being a walk-out, it is well lit with huge windows. The kitchen and bath (as well as the entire apartment) were very clean and fully equipped.  I highly recommend this apartment for anyone wanting a perfect place to stay in Seattle. "
5630783,32974184,2015-05-24,1036180,Caroline,"We stayed at Chris and Maria's studio for 3 nights with our 2 young children and we had the best time! The location is superb! Situated only a couple of blocks from Greenlake and its trails and walking paths, our kids were able to ride their bikes and run around the grassy areas every evening before or after dinner. The #16 bus is a short walk away and got us into the city centre in under 15 minutes. The PCC natural foods market is another short walk away, or you can easily drive to it as well as the nearby Whole Foods at 65th and Roosevelt. 
The studio space itself was spacious enough that the four of us did not feel cramped. The space was incredibly clean and well stocked with towels, bedding and bathroom necessities. The kitchen has the basic cooking tools, and we brought a small blender with us for our other needs. Chris and Maria were also kind enough to leave us some juice boxes and beer in the fridge :) 
This spot is all about the location in our opinion, as it is a wonderful balance between being super close to the city and right in the quiet greenery of the Greenlake neighborhood :)
Thanks for the wonderful trip guys!"
5630783,33684687,2015-05-31,21937457,Andrew,"We loved staying at this studio and found it incredibly comfortable.  Chris and Maria included several convenient touches, like a few drinks in the fridge, coffee for the coffeemaker, and Seattle information.  The place has lots of light and a sweet little patio that made it easy for us to enjoy the evenings while our toddler slept.  The bed is incredibly comfortable, and there is a lot of storage--three big closets-- to make it easy to settle in without tripping over luggage during your stay.  The apartment is very quiet too, located on a calm, residential street and without any notable noise from the upstairs house.  Greenlake is a great neighborhood with fun amenities in walking distance, but parking is still easy.  We would definitely stay here on our next trip to Seattle.  "
5630783,34013321,2015-06-03,6631684,Amy,"Chris and Maria are so nice and willing to help us to feel comfortable and enjoy the vacation in Seattle. This is really a lovely studio with everything you need. Clean, bright and warm. Close to Green lake and also easy to get to downtown. This is the best place to stay in Seattle and I wish I can come back for another vacation and stay longer. "
5630783,34416830,2015-06-08,17911298,Sissi,房子位置非常好，在绿湖边上却没有挨着繁忙的公路，周围环境非常优美。内部陈设非常舒适，干净整洁。房东人非常好，非常细心，冰箱里有啤酒和给孩子的饮料，厨房竟然配了做饭的油。洗浴用品也是非常有品质，还配了吹风机、熨斗。我们一家三口住的都不想走了，我们还会回来的。
5630783,34800017,2015-06-12,32993053,Gary,The accommodations were perfect and just as described.  The owners were very accomodating and helpful.  You could not get a better location one block from Greenlake.
5630783,35822938,2015-06-22,16113697,Zachary,"Chris and Maria's place could not be any more comfortable.  Although we didn't a get a chance to meet them, they left us snacks and great suggestions on things to do for the weekend.  They were also very accessible if we had questions.

As far as the place itself, it appears just like in the photos and descriptions left by other reviewers. It was clean, spacious and again, comfortable. We just wished we could have stayed longer. You're also literally 1-2 blocks from Green Lake,which is gorgeous."
5630783,36151024,2015-06-25,5091846,Devin,"The place is a sweet little gem in a terrific neighborhood right by Greenlake. I wish I could have stayed longer. It they were booked!

Chris was a great communicator and was kind enough to greet me despite my late arrival. I heartily recommend staying here!"
5630783,37189519,2015-07-05,5041258,Gabriel,Great neighborhood. Great location. Place was as advertised. Clean and comfortable. Chris and Maria were communicative and  accommodating. Very friendly and a pleasure to work with during the whole process. Would absolutely recommend this place. 
5630783,37758111,2015-07-10,3578223,Shannon,"We had a wonderful stay at the studio!  It's in a great location, my husband and I walked to nearby coffee shops and brewpubs, and walked around green lake in the mornings.  The studio is nice, clean, we had everything we needed.  We bought groceries at the nearby store and made dinners there each night.  It was a perfect place for our stay in Seattle.  Highly recommended."
5630783,42612985,2015-08-14,40612523,Kristin,"We had a lovely stay at this airbnb location. This was our first experience and we lucked out. We liked it so much (the location, the quietness of the neighborhood, and comfortable situation) that we stayed an extra night. Chris was very helpful in figuring out the trickiness of adding an extra night but not simply altering an existing reservation by contacting airbnb help desk. We would stay here again in future. "
5630783,43495497,2015-08-20,14776965,Vicky,"We really enjoyed our stay with Chris and Maria, they were incredibly helpful leaving maps and schedules for us to use. They went above and beyond allowing us to print tickets using their computer and by leaving our bags before our afternoon train. The apartment was spacious enough for 3 of us given we spent little time in it. The bus is within walking distance and takes you downtown within 30mins. There's also great eateries within walking distance. Thanks guys for all your help and direction - we really appreciate it! "
5630783,44315369,2015-08-25,344051,Anna,"Very nice, spacious studio in a great location just a few blocks from beautiful Green Lake. Everything is provided to make the stay comfortable and the owners are so nice and everything went really smoothly. A great experience in a peaceful neighborhood just a short drive from the city center. "
5630783,45370712,2015-09-02,17220660,Katharine,We loved our stay at this Studio Apartment. The location was ideal and the place was clean and had everything we could ask for. At times you can hear footsteps and noise above you but honestly it is negligible compared to all of the wonderful aspects of this place. We loved the private entrance and the keypad on the door made coming and going so easy. The neighborhood was so cute. At one point the Carbon Monoxide Detector went off (it needed a new battery) and Chris came down to help us with it. He was so helpful and nice. We would definitely stay here again. 
5630783,45684688,2015-09-05,21210418,Robin,Thank you Chris and Maria.  We felt very comfortable in the apartment and loved the location!  We'll be back someday.
5630783,45974606,2015-09-07,4540015,Genaro,"This is a great studio apartment with plenty of light and superbly clean. Chris is a great host who made us feel at home and offered recommendations for Seattle. I would definitely stay at this gem again. It is also located just a few steps from Green Lake Park, coffee shops and restaurants."
5630783,48501629,2015-09-27,34458859,Biswajit,"The host, Mr Cris has been very supportive and friendly all the way through. We spent nice time in the apartment for almost 14 days. It was indeed comfortable and pleasant. We are looking for staying there during our next visits."
5630783,49908867,2015-10-07,38407179,Debbie,"Chris and Maria's place is lovely, bright, quiet, comfortable, and inviting.  The description and pictures provided are true to the space. Its proximity to the Green Lake area makes it very desireable. Chris returns messages quickly, is very accessible, and pleasant. This was my first experience using Airbnb and it has been very positive. I definitely recommend this place!"
5630783,50449305,2015-10-12,40530273,Freya,"Excellent stay. Quiet neighborhood, walking distance to cafes, park and zoo. Plenty of parking and easy access to get into city and surrounding suburbs. 
Nicely laid out apartment, suitable for 2 adults and 2 kids-good kitchen and nice bathroom. 
Would definitely recommend. 
Chris was great at communicating and very quick to respond to any questions we had. "
5630783,53481611,2015-11-09,2265363,Prescott,Chris and Maria were the most welcoming hosts for my mom visiting her grandson for the first time all the way from Virginia. They both took time out of their day to visit with her and make her feel very comfortable. As for the apartment it was very clean and plenty spacious. Thanks Chris and Maria!
5691933,51768249,2015-10-24,2343002,Sara,"The listing was exactly as described, and all of the items were in place when we arrived per the detailed instructions. As we were there for business, I can't speak much to the neighborhood from a social/tourist perspective, but it was right in the middle of the business area we needed to be in. The view is truly phenomenal!"
5691933,53334515,2015-11-08,13549988,Rachel,Great experience! Would recommend staying here to anyone. Location was perfect for needs. 
5446156,31006422,2015-04-30,3525899,Ben,Amazing apartment with a spectacular view! It was clean and made me feel at home. Super centrally located and all the amenities in the building mean you'll never have to go searching for anything. Whole Foods is two blocks down the street and you're only a 8 mine wall from the Space Needle or Pike Place Market 
5446156,31717567,2015-05-09,12270334,Sandi,"The Via6 building is in a great location for sightseeing. It is a 15 minute walk from the major downtown Seattle attractions. The shops on the first floor were convenient for morning coffee, a packable lunch to go or a late dinner. The unit was very comfortable from bedding to seating to electronic devices(wifi & cable). There is construction across the street but the unit is amazingly well insulated. With the windows closed, we heard none of the street noise(very quiet area already) or the construction work which ended early afternoon. We would very much welcome an extended stay when we return to the area."
5446156,32626567,2015-05-19,25842948,Scott,"Great location, great facilities, professional service.  We will definitely be coming back."
5446156,33106002,2015-05-25,29439337,Sarah,"The Via6 was the perfect location for my recent trip to Seattle, and the apartment was beautiful.  We loved being able to walk to so many major sites (Space Needle, Pike's Place, Chihuly Museum, ferry boats, etc) and have the convenience of the building's market and coffeeshop at our home base.  Everyone was so helpful in answering questions before our stay and providing check-in/check-out instructions, as well as recommendations for places to visit on our trip.  Highly recommend!"
5446156,33586421,2015-05-30,19812692,Nikolaus,"This is a great place in a great location. The 3pm arrival time is serious as the management company only drops of the keys at the front desk then. Note that you are working with a professional company, so this is not your typical Airbnb experience, which is not necessarily a bad thing. 

Roofgarden was great. "
5446156,33994108,2015-06-03,17020496,Tag,"Really enjoyed staying in this 2-bedroom condo. Can't beat the location and the unit has the largest balcony in the entire building. The building has great amenities and stores on the ground floor. Despite construction across the street, the windows kept early morning noise to a minimum as well."
5446156,35384895,2015-06-18,2163799,Sean,"I and my two colleagues unanimously agreed that this was absolutely the best place away from home that we have ever stayed! The apartment was clean, quite, comfortable, and modern. The roof-top balconies, both the private and the shared spaces, were so amazing that we spent every evening out there; we mingled with locals and other visitors and made new friends. And the location can't be beat. We were within walking distance of everything we hoped to see and do while in Seattle. Thanks Jordan, Via6, airbnb, and Stay Alfred for an unforgettable home-away-from-home. "
5446156,38401950,2015-07-15,37849,Danny,"This is a nice apartment! Check in was super easy. Was surprised that it was actually at the top floor of the building...incredible view! Tons of great ammenities downstairs (coffee shop, bar, niche convenience store). Via 6 is within walking distance to all the action in Seattle. We could get to the convention center, Pike Place Market and the nightlife of Belltown all within a 10 min walk. The only unpleasantry: they are building the new Amazon HQ directly across the street from the apartment. The construction starts EARLY, so until completion expect to hear the sound of construction crews before the sun comes up. This may not bother some, but if you are a light sleeper expect early wakeups. Overall would stay here again."
5446156,38852875,2015-07-19,8936655,Lacie,"This listing is part of s corporate housing company Stay Alfred, and it was great! Super easy to pick up keys from the concierge and the apartment is baby friendly with the patio that looks onto the garden. Within walking distance of all major attractions (Pike Place Market, Aquarium, even Capitol Hill) and the directions left for departure are clear and easy. "
5446156,43382714,2015-08-19,28992896,Lauren,"We are still in our home-away home when I write this.  Nice apartment, convenient location, easy access to major attractions.  The construction going on across the street does leave us feel noisy, but this is not the fault of the landlord.  We enjoyed the time spent at the patio area (on the 7th floor)very much."
5446156,51034249,2015-10-17,43699967,David,"Everything was better then expected. Check in was simple and the step by step instructions were perfect. I brought my wife and 2 kids and they were blown away by the location, layout and cleanliness of the apartment.
If we get back to Seattle I will try to book this place again!!"
5446156,52912012,2015-11-02,29631888,Julia,"Wonderful apt and building. Alot of amenities. Felt secure, was quiet and in great shape. Great, secure parking where elevators take you write to your floor. Hope to stay here again on my next visit to Seattle."
5446156,54439915,2015-11-20,19844328,Dianne,"It was a bit confusing on signing the documents ahead of time since they were never sent to me. But it was nice that they text you and let you know that you have yet to sign the agreement, which was easily done after. Everything else was perfect. Check-in is extremely easy and the convenience of the apartment was awesome! The apartment was very clean and nice. Would highly recommend this place to people who want to stay in Seattle. "
5446156,55343053,2015-12-01,36275715,Jim,"This was my first Airbnb trip and I may be spoiled forever.  This unit was clean, comfortable and had all of the comforts of home.   I traveled with family (4 adults and 1 child) for the Seattle Marathon and the building is perfectly located close to all the downtown Seattle has to offer.  The building staff was always friendly and key pick up and check out was effortless.  The unit included a free parking space with indoor garage parking which was a bonus since we rented a car to visit more family in Bellevue.   The first floor convenience store, coffee shop and restaurant means you never have to leave the unit for supplies.   if you love donuts, Top Pot is just around the corner on 5th.  
The living room has a pullout couch bed and all of the sheets/towels that were provided were clean.   The fact that it also comes with a washer/dryer in the unit meant we could throw a load in before we left and came home with clean clothes.
This is a hidden gem.  If you are coming to Seattle, book this unit and don't bother to look elsewhere.

5446156,56332389,2015-12-12,1620237,Aleksei,"It was a great stay. Apartment was clean and nice!

Building has very nice amenities."
5446156,57284844,2015-12-24,27243538,Shawn,"My family and I loved staying here.  The building was ideal with all the amenities.  Having the Assembly Hall in the lobby for amazing morning coffee and bagels was perfect.  The unit is walking distance to Pike Place and downtown shopping, which was decorated for Christmas and really brought a nice touch to our amazing trip to Seattle.   

The unit was comfortable and has everything we needed.   The kitchen was equipped if we wanted to cook our own meals, but we chose to instead eat out at the many good  restaurants that are in the immediate area.  The beds are comfortable.  Apartment is clean and well maintained.  Having the washer and dryer in the unit is convenient and helps if you don't want to overpack for an extended stay.  

We would definitely stay here again.  "
20868,54332,2010-06-18,112743,Debi,"If you want a quiet place that's in a great neighborhood, five minutes from the freeway and feels like a home away from home, this is the place.  My husband, myself and our adult daughter stayed at Amy & Joey's and were delighted with the accommodations and the comfy beds!  The great coffee maker and the beautiful decor of the suite was excellent.  Whenever we had a question we were able to ask Amy or Joey.
If you book early enough you can book to have your hair done by Joey too!
We will definitely be coming back!

AirBnb is much more professional than VRBO and they will now get all my business when I'm traveling.  Airbnb sent confirmations and reminders that were timely and professional.

20868,89919,2010-09-04,153017,Mary,"It has been a wonderful experience to have the MIL condo of Amy and Joey in Seattle. Not only is their condo tastefully decorated, they have both been hospitable, friendly and helpful. Their place is beautifully kept and with a perfect armour which one would expect back at home. I have no hesitation to recommend their place to any reasonable traveller. In fact we do look forward to renting their MIL condo again on our next visit to Seattle. Thanks a lot Amy and Joey. We look forward to meeting you both again on our next trip. Best wishes to you both and wish you two a great summer ahead. Thanks be to Katie who has helped to make our stay more memorable. "
20868,98069,2010-09-16,123117,Paul,"Lovely spot to stay, is a little way out of town if you are reliant on public transport, but we loved this area and the apartment ,would return again.
"
20868,104040,2010-09-24,214791,Kevin,The place was exactly like they described it.  My wife and I really enjoyed it.  We stayed in a hotel for our last two days and wished we would have continued our stay with them instead.
20868,106229,2010-09-27,212669,Steve,"It was such a pleasant trip to Seattle, and staying at Amy & Joey's place made it feel like coming home every night after a long day of sightseeing.  The place was clean, comfy and quiet, with very good location.  I would highly recommend to anyone, and definately stay here if I have a chance to visit Seattle again.  Thanks Amy & Joey!!   "

Accommodations were good.
Nice area and good location in Seattle.

I would recommend their 2 bedroom suite to fellow travellers."

VERY responsive to my questions & I would highly recommend this place!

See you again soon!!"
20868,125363,2010-10-24,191648,Don,"Absolutely perfect.  We loved the attractive décor, exceptional cleanliness and welcoming comforts – individual coffees, seasonal candies.  We felt like expected and welcome guests.  This is the place to land if you’re visiting Seattle.  Many thanks."
20868,137035,2010-11-11,39696,Jennifer,"I just recently spent three wonderful nights in Amy & Joey's MIL condo. What a beautiful place! More than enough room to host my group. The kitchen is great and fully stocked with plates, glasses, pots and pans, toaster oven, microwave and even a great individual-cup coffee maker - absolutely everything you would need to make a home-cooked meal away from home. The bedrooms are beautiful, large and the beds are comfy and full of luxurious comforters and pillows. The living area is complete with two couches, large TV, table and chairs in the eating area and even a fireplace. Amy & Joey were always available by a quick email or text and were attentive to everything we needed. My favorite place to stay in Seattle."
20868,154712,2010-12-16,304119,Jennifer,"Amy & Joey's place was beautiful, comfortable and clean. It was nice to feel at home while on the road. I would definitely consider staying here again if the need arose."
20868,170632,2011-01-15,293662,Michael,"Wow This place is easy to find, Easy to get to, And so easy to get to downtown Seattle. Close to a mall, Close to food, and just great. So this is Michael and what did I love about this place. The bed was so comfortable that after we went to the museum of flight (lots of walking) all I could think about was how comfortable that bed was going to be. We did need to ask about Toilet paper and Joey was on the ball two min's later I had enough ""TP"" to do the whole house. The home is quite and neat. Hands down they will be the first place we look next time we are in need. Also I didn't know it but Joey is a Exclusive Hairstylist and from the looks of it he is well liked by his customers So if you are in town or going to be in town Drop him a line and see if he has room to fit you in his schedule. Thanks for a great retreat, and a place to recoup"
20868,176898,2011-01-31,362467,Susan,We stayed in town while our floors were being refinished. Perfect for our needs. Everything was as advertised. Comfortable and more than sufficient. Good choice for a family since the unit has two large bedrooms and a well appointed kitchen.
20868,178027,2011-02-03,200487,Ligaya,"Amy & Joey accepted our reservation in a single day - super quick response time! The place had easy parking as the neighborhood was residential, just a fifteen minute drive to the city. They had the plate immaculate, heater on and a candle burning when we arrived. Comfortable beds and professionally staged decor, too. Thanks, SuperHosts!"
20868,179243,2011-02-07,357621,Daniel,"Great place. Large, spacious, clean, great decor, and the owners are very thoughtful about making it comfortable.  I'd definitely recommend it to anyone and hope it's available when I visit again. "
20868,185695,2011-02-21,376288,Desjarles,"I recently visited the city of Seattle and had the pleasure of staying in a very nice condo owned by Joey and Amy Furlan.  The place was very easy to locate and once I arrived, I was amazed at this two bedroom fully furnished condo. Everything was clean and the atmosphere was nice and I felt as if I were home. I would gladly stay at this condo again on my next visit to Seattle. 
Thanks a lot Joey,
D.J."
20868,206720,2011-03-22,431007,Patricia,Great little condo.  Clean and had everything we needed for a great weekend in Seattle.
20868,212243,2011-03-29,403920,Isaku,"We were four (myself,my wife and two children of 11 yars-old girl and
8 years-old boy. The place was just perfect for us!  Quiet neigborhood.
Joey our host was very quick in attending our needs. The fact the he runs a hair studio upstairs made us feel at ease case we come up with needs and questions.
My friends in Seattle area when knowing abou the place and its fare
confrmed us that we got a good deal.
Next time we visit Seattle, this place will be our number one choice
without any doubt."
20868,222705,2011-04-11,392112,Marcia,Good place.  Easy.  Super clean.  Comfy king size bed.  Great location.  
20868,245132,2011-04-30,397650,Alla,The mother in law condo was very nice and clean we had a wonderful time in Seattle joey and Amy were quick to answer any question we needed answered our family enjoyed every moment there we defiantly recommend this place to stay.
20868,285370,2011-05-28,501940,John,The house was comfortable. We had a mix up with the keys on arrival. This was sorted out quickly and they were apologetic and very accommodating.
20868,364169,2011-07-10,586264,Deb,"We stayed in Seattle for 2 nights and Joey's place was perfect for us. It gave us room to spread out, relax and prepare meals. Joey was very responsive and available. The condo is beautiful and just minutes from the downtown sights. We will definitely stay there again if we are back in the area."
20868,368171,2011-07-12,444757,Chandra,"My family and I just got into Seattle from an Alaskan Cruise and were tired and needed some space beside a small cabin that we shared for a week! This was perfect and very nice especially for the price, I was extremely pleased and when I return to Seattle I will be looking Joey up if the space is available, everyone was impressed. Joey was very nice and helpful as well, beds comfortable and we used his washer and dryer to wash a weeks worth of dirty clothes. "
20868,412005,2011-08-01,815038,Mel,Very easy arranging the accommodations.  Joey was a great host.  Would recommend to others.
20868,501500,2011-09-05,428563,Ann,Very Comfortable setting --gracious host - we had a great time while in Seattle -- We are all coffee drinkers and the Keurig coffee and pot were great to have. The chocolate was very sweet surprise and with the 6 of us there we  satisfied our sweet tooth.The best thing was use of laundry facilities ... we could not have better hosts for our stay in Seattle -- we cannot thank you enough and will highly reccomend to friends and family--
20868,530319,2011-09-14,237780,Colleen,I rented Amy and Joey's condo for my parents stay. It was their first time to Seattle since I moved here 4 years ago. The condo was perfect...great location and my parents said they slept better than they do at home. It was great for them to have a nice place to stay and rest between siteseeing. I will definitely book there again for my out of town guests.
20868,549615,2011-09-20,710344,Elizabeth,"The mother in law suite was the perfect place for our group to stay in Seattle.  We stayed here for the second 2 nights of 4 nights, spending the first 2 nights upstairs  in Joey's other suite.  We were two couples traveling and the rooms were great.  The king size bed was big and comfy.  The queen size bed was not the best, but the private living room, kitchen and bath more than made up for it. They has cable tv so we could watch the football games on sunday and the private parking spot was nice even though parking in this area was very easy.  We bought fish at Pike place and cooked it at home on our first night in the suite.  Overall a great place to stay and a quick drive downtown.

5 stars!
"
20868,602657,2011-10-06,443654,Valerie,Our first experience with airbnb will definitely not be our last. We were delighted to be able to be so close to downtown Seattle & have our own corner of the world. Everything that was advertised was present & so much more. Would definitely recommend this outstanding host.
20868,722676,2011-11-15,454905,Patricia,super comfortable bed!
20868,783035,2011-12-13,1338990,Lisa,"Apartment perfectly met our family's needs; it was spacious and provided the comforts of home. Great hosts, too: Jess and Joey were attentive and friendly. Thanks!"
20868,828268,2012-01-02,808431,Phil,"Jess and Joey were very accommodating with our last minute booking. Great location, less than a 10 minute drive to downtown Seattle, super comfy beds, very spacious suite! Everything was perfect. No surprises."
20868,853854,2012-01-09,1565920,Russell,"Great, stress-free experience!  Stylish, clean, comfortable and conveniently located 3 houses down from a city bus stop (bus #73 took us right into the heart of the city).  Complimentary Kuerig coffee cups & bite-size candies added a nice, unexpected touch.  We'll certainly be staying at Jess & Joey's flat again in the future and we've already shared our positive experience with many of our close friends."
20868,1005201,2012-03-17,1099459,Anthony,Jess and Joey were great host. There was not a need we had that they did not anticipate. The level of cleanliness of the rental was appreciated. I also liked the attention to detail that they put into preparing the space for guest. Including the little garden areas outside of the windows. I would definitely rent with this couple again. 
20868,1207062,2012-05-01,1632372,Tim,"Nice, clean apartment with comfortable furnishings and ammenities. Great location (quiet yet convenient). Friendly, helpful hosts. Couldn't ask for more. 5 stars! "

allerdings nicht für Raucher oder Lärmempfindliche Menschen.
Joey's Friseursalon ist genau über der Wohnung und das macht Tagsüber einen Heidenlärm von oben.
Rauchen ist strictly nicht erlaubt,im Haus und auf dem Grundstück"
20868,1398624,2012-06-02,1829088,Janet,"The condo worked out well for our family.  The location was convenient, just a short drive to the main attractions of Seattle.  The plentiful supply of towels and the special coffee were appreciated.  We would stay there again."

Jan & Chris"
20868,2259009,2012-09-10,752065,Renee,"Perfect hosts and blissful stay! Jess & Joey were super quick to respond via email/text so we managed to book the place within 24 hours. Their communication was excellent - fast and clear.

The condo is about five minutes from I-5 and we found it easily. After being road weary, it really felt like home-away-from-home. The bowl of candy was such a fun surprise to greet us. The furnishings were all very comfortable and tasteful. The king bed has to be the most comfortable bed we have ever slept on - super plush.

It was a 5-10 minute walk through a cute, residential neighborhood to some nice restaurants for dinner. It was a 5-10 min drive to downtown Seattle. Highly recommended and would love to stay there again next time we're in town."
20868,2427153,2012-09-27,2984609,Marlena,The condo was very nice! We enjoyed our stay. Beds were very comfortable. A bus stop was only 1/2 a block away! Perfect! The coffee every morning was a wonderful extra! Thank you Jess and Joey! We will definitely request again in the future!
20868,2661247,2012-10-20,1794887,Kitty,Condo is close to the I-5 but still in a quiet neighborhood about 15 minutes from downtown.   Jess and Joey were easy to communicate with and we enjoyed staying in this rental.
20868,2924661,2012-11-19,4142203,Azita,We had a pleasant stay at Jess and Joey's condo.  The condo was very clean and spacious and minutes to downtown Seattle.  I would highly recommend staying at their condo.  
20868,3074576,2012-12-11,1926668,Derek,"Super-easy to work with, a huge clean apartment.  No trouble at all getting in or out.  A bit of a hike from downtown but it was in a nice, quiet part of town."
20868,3350037,2013-01-14,510057,Ravindra,"Every thing was exactly as described. Very neat. 
We stayed for one night and Jess and Joey sent an email to let us know where the keys are.
We left at the checkout time and didnt realize that we forgot our bag and they texted us about it. They boxed it up and arranged to get that shipped. If not we probably had to drive 400 miles to pick the bag. 
They were very fast in responding. 
We enjoyed the Coffee and candy!!!
Thank you very much Jess and Joey"
20868,3383158,2013-01-21,4426518,Amy Lou,this was a cozy spot for our stay in Seattle!
20868,3431758,2013-01-28,1413898,Paula,Great place to stay! Didn't meet Jess & Joey but everything was perfectly arranged. I was in Seattle for a two day intensive program at Kerala Ayurveda just 1/2 mile away. Will definitely stay again.
20868,3498531,2013-02-08,4836977,Michelle,"Great hosts, who were accessible yet totally unobtrusive.  Easy to find place in safe location with great nearby ammenities.  Just as pictured, great beds.  Definately would stay again if they'll have it  :)"
20868,3631215,2013-02-26,5028912,Betsy,"Lovely apartment! Clean, quiet, comfortable and well-supplied. Bedrooms  were roomy with ample closet space. No negatives and we will certainly stay here again when we come to Seattle!"
20868,3645276,2013-02-26,5191493,Chantell,"Jess and Joey are great! Their space is cozy, clean and in a great neighborhood. They are wonderful hosts and were patient when I had techincal issues with airbnb's website. "
20868,3698902,2013-03-05,2324233,Beth,"Our daughter & son in law are remodeling their home so we needed a place to stay in their neighborhood (Maple Leaf) while visiting them in Seattle. Booking with Joey and Jess was timely and easy and the accommodation was spotless, nicely decorated and  exactly as described. The bed was comfy and the bathroom well stocked with extra towels and shower supplies. The bus stop to go downtown is a half a block away and there are restaurants within walking distance.  We stayed 4 nights and if our next trip to Seattle requires the booking of accommodations we would definitely try to book this apt again.  One last note is that while we did not meet Jess and Joey, they left their cell phone number in case we needed anything.  However, this airbnb has been so well thought out and executed, there wasn't a thing we needed."
20868,3835925,2013-03-19,5074261,Emily,"Jess and Joey were very helpful and unobtrusive.  Everything was exactly as pictured, and we had no problems whatsoever."
20868,3862638,2013-03-22,1974952,Karen,"Jess and Joey's place was great.  My mom and I had a nice stay during our stopover in Seattle.  We liked having the separate apartment, complete with living room, kitchen, and two bedrooms.  It was a little chilly in the apartment but Jess and Joey left a number of easy-to-use space heaters for us to adjust the temperature as we desired.  The apartment was self-serve but Jess and Joey made themselves available if we had any questions or concerns.  We would definitely stay here again.  "
20868,3895966,2013-03-25,5322920,Maesha,Jess and Joey are absolutely amazing and a total Godsend! Would totally recommend them!! 
20868,4497560,2013-05-08,6078837,Leah,Everything was great. Very clean. The kitchen had everything we needed including a coffee machine.The bedrooms and bathrooms were stocked with extra towels and blankets and there were even maps and brochures for different places to visit in Seattle. Everything was really well organized. We couldn't have asked for more. 
20868,4661583,2013-05-19,3236508,Vincent,Stayed for 3 days with four adults and a four year old. Very compact and functional place and close to the freeway on/off ramp. Did not get to meet either Jess nor Joey but checking in/out was a breeze.
20868,4964300,2013-06-04,5739821,Cody,Great place to stay.  Very accomodating hosts.  
20868,5050975,2013-06-10,3678003,Mike & Sally,"Really an excellent experience in all respects. We were able to do an early check-in and found the unit perfectly ready and set up on our arrival. It is convenient, private, quiet, and equipped with pretty much everything you might want or need for a visit to the area. The hosts are a positive delight to work with, responding quickly to all queries and able to resolve any and all problems you might have.

We only used their place for one night this time, as an overnight stay in the Seattle area for my brother's visit here from Virginia. We will certainly be using it again in the future.

As an example of the care and attention taken here, the unit was provided with a Keurig coffee maker and a full supply of coffee pods. It is, if anything, rather nicer than shows in the pictures and the beds are very comfortable."
20868,5348834,2013-06-25,6458601,Michelle,Nice clean house big enough for us five. 
20868,5402865,2013-06-28,2216791,Kay,"Our stay at Joey and Jess's was great!  The pictures of their cute place show it just as it is!  So comfortable!
Plus ""the best breakfast place in Seattle""  Patty's Eggnest 
Not far away!"
20868,5500556,2013-07-02,5111270,Annie,"Good location, close to the bus stop and I-5. Enjoyed our stay. Nice and tidy place, everything was well-organized. Thank you for accommodating us. "
20868,5747151,2013-07-15,5101685,Vanessa,The condo was clean and incredibly comfortable!  There was plenty of space for four adults and my toddler.  Jessica was always quick to reply to any questions I had and was very easy to get a hold of.  Will definitely be staying here next time we visit Seattle!
20868,6030977,2013-07-27,7331638,Joe,"Very clean and comfortable, nice and cool, extremely friendly host."

20868,6234448,2013-08-05,4857372,Kristine,Jess & Joey's condo was very comfortable.  They were very accommodating.  After a 14 hour drive with kids it was just the kind of place we needed. Thanks for helping to make our stay in Seattle easier.  
20868,6355935,2013-08-09,7599089,Wendy,"Jess and Joey were great!  They responded immediately to our emails and even ran a fan down to us at our first mention of it being ""warm"" in the house....(unusually warm weather for Seattle).  The apartment was perfect for our family, and it was nice to kick back and feel ""at home"" even far away from our own home.   We only wish we had a few more days to enjoy their place in Seattle."
20868,6667729,2013-08-20,1323865,Abra,"Jess & Joey's place is clean, spacious, and very homey. They were great to communicate with and Jess provided excellent information of what to do while in Seattle. I was very pleased with this property and highly recommend staying here!"
20868,6822473,2013-08-26,6968299,Marnie,"Our stay with Jess & Joey in the mother-in-law condo was terrific!  The space was perfect...comfy and clean, cool and quiet, and just the right size for our party of 4.  It was also situated in a great location for our activities in the city.  Jess was fantastic with communication, responding swiftly and sending very clear, concise information.  I definitely recommend staying with Jess & Joey - I know I will when I am in Seattle again!"
20868,6856417,2013-08-27,1648902,Marcy,"Great location, close to all downtown Seattle attractions.  Easy to find.  We liked the privacy of a private entrance.  All the comforts of home including coffee, dish-ware, laundry, Wifi, TV, and linens.  Best part of our stay was the king bed.  Probably one of the more coziest and comfortable beds I have ever slept in.  We never saw Jess and Joey but they were easily accessible by email for questions.  We only stayed 1 night but it was perfect for our Seattle visit and would stay there again.  So much better than a hotel and more cost effective.  Very clean and decorated nicely.  We highly recommend Jess and Joey's place to anyone visiting Seattle.  A great stay.   "
20868,7699706,2013-09-30,7594303,Russell,"Great location, just off I-5 on Lake City Way.  Convenient for downtown, the U district or going north.  Easy access.  Found a really nice bookstore/cafe not far away called VIOS.  

We were only there one night with two couples.  Good beds, comfortable area to visit in.  Full kitchen.  

We will be back."
20868,7875620,2013-10-07,8095789,Kelly,We had a great stay.  Plenty of room for us and 3 kids.  Good location and nice neighbourhood.  We found everything we needed to make our stay comfortable and convenient.  
20868,8094226,2013-10-15,9034794,Gina,"We have a wonderful stay at Jess & Joey's place! 

The hosts are very efficient and friendly, and the whole condo is very clean and neat, comfortable and nicely decorated...will definitely return when in the area!

Thank you!      "
20868,8293675,2013-10-24,8181051,Karolyn,The apartment is conveniently located and comfortably appointed.  This is our first time booking with airbnb and it was great!
20868,8980962,2013-11-30,4019278,Miyu,"It was great staying at Jess & Joey's place. Big house, clean beds, towels, bathrooms. The only thing that I was disappointed about was the location. It was not as convenience as I thought from the description. If you would like to go down town a lot, it won't be a great place to stay. If you like to stay a house that has a vast space and don't really care about convenience, this place will be awesome and perfect for you! Other than the inconvenience, I enjoyed staying this house! Thank you! "
20868,9339564,2013-12-22,3181079,Sarah,"The condo was perfect for our weekend. It is not huge, but the rooms were surprisingly roomy and the beds very comfy. The hosts never stopped by we knew how to reach them if we had to. Great spot in North Seattle! "
20868,9822038,2014-01-12,7990856,Morgan,"The space worked well for us. The master bedroom had plenty of space for our pack n play to fit, etc. The king bed was nice although too soft for our liking. The kitchen is functional but has very old appliances, the microwave was almost falling off the wall, fridge had some rust in the trim, etc and no dishwasher but we survived! Living room was small but comfortable. Our biggest complaint is that we were unaware there was a business being run on the floor above us. They started as early as 8am and went as late as 8pm some nights. You heard loud walking around, etc pretty much all day. Made it very hard for our daughter to nap there.  Parking spot was good for a compact car anything bigger can park on the street in front.  "
20868,10820542,2014-03-09,12052834,Juli,"Jess and Joey Furlan are Excellent hosts. The basement apartment is great. I was in Seattle from LA, CA to get medical care and Jess and Joey could not have been nicer or more genuine people. My husband and I were so lucky to have found this place and Jess and Joey. The neighborhood is very nice. It is on a fairly busy street, but that is convenient for getting around. If you are VERY sensitive to noise they do have wood floors upstairs and people walking during the day (as I noticed from an earlier review) but honestly it has not bothered me and I was sleeping a lot of the time during the day due to my health treatments. I don't like most hotel rooms at all so it was a real blessing to find this place. I would recommend you stay in any of the places J&J have to rent. The place is clean, comfortable and has all you need. If you want to be near downtown and the nightlife you will have to travel a bit but after seeing that area I would rather be here. Public transportation here is great. We rented a car and there is a parking space out front and street parking."
20868,14695875,2014-06-24,15542700,Mary,"Jess and Joey's apartment was spacious, comfortable and convenient!  I have lived in Seattle so found getting to and from downtown and other areas very easy to navigate.  That said, I could see (if you aren't familiar with the area), the apartment may seem a bit out of the way.  The apartment is on a busy street so if traveling with a small child (as we were), be mindful of having them outside.  There are a couple good parks for playing close by though."
20868,14814787,2014-06-27,1982319,Jennifer,"Wonderful place and great hosts. Highly responsive. One recommendation would be to air out the place before guests arrive as it was quite musty smelling. Also, removing already opened food from the cupboards and fridge would be more sanitary. Otherwise, beautiful location and property! Thank you."
20868,16366592,2014-07-26,17849918,Nicole,"Great place to stay! The beds are very comfy. The private entrance and parking space allowed us to come and go as we needed, and we never felt like we were bothering anyone. Jess and Joey are super responsive as well. You can hear the people above walking around a bit, but it is not bad. Overall, I highly recommend!"
20868,17434247,2014-08-12,15181145,Penny,"I rented this suite for my family for a 3 day weekend.  2 couples and two children stayed here very comfortably.  I inspected the suite when my daughter Naomi arrived.  The suite was very clean, spacious, very attractive on the inside and located on a pretty but busy street.  The frig was large and able to accommodate all the food they needed for the weekend.  The dining area was very pretty.There was vast amount of closet space so this could be a nice place for a longer stay.  There was big screen TV in the living room and also WIFI.  The children were very comfortable with their parents and also sleeping on the two couches in the living room.  My son in law Alter said everything was fine and the rooms were very nice. I noticed complimentary coffee and tea.  Also the host left listings of nearby eateries and pubs. "
20868,28528797,2015-03-25,17267707,Justin,"Jess and Joey are very nice and understanding people. There was a double booking snafoo with the airbnb but right when they realized it would be an issue, they contacted me as soon as possible and booked my friends and I two hotel rooms not far from their place. The hotel was very well rated and Joey drove there personally with us to make sure we got into our rooms safely and settled. The hotel rooms were also double the price of the airbnb but jess a Joey covered the whole price. Everyone makes mistakes but they handled it extremely well and professionally. I would highly highly recommend these two and their service!  :)"
20868,32869215,2015-05-22,22305729,Liang,"nice place,perfect location"
20868,33090150,2015-05-25,2206509,Holden,We had an excellent time staying at Jess and Joey's apt!  They hosted 6 of us without a problem and we were all very comfortable.  Definitely recommend staying here if you're in the Seattle area!
20868,34281330,2015-06-07,19576677,Sheryl,"My group of 6 really enjoyed the place and the neighborhood.  The rooms were spacious and the area was livable and clean. We all had a positive experience, thank you!"
20868,35232985,2015-06-16,32790966,Prashant,Really enjoyed our stay. Joey was very prompt in replying any questions we had. Spacious unit and we all slept comfortably. 
20868,35645240,2015-06-21,2937500,Vince,The place was great - easy to setup and great location for our activities in north seattle.   Jess and Joey were very responsive in setting up this stay and coordinating logistics.  The space had a lot of room.  We weren't around much to take advantage of the amenities - hopefully the next time.
20868,35934169,2015-06-23,32304909,Ayanendu,"We stayed at  Jess & Joey's for 2 nights.  Nice location - near to downtown.  Excellent hosts - they responded to our queries/needs pretty fast, easy to communicate.  Nice sized bedrooms.  Given the price, nice place to stay.  We were 4 adults and 2 small kids - the kids slept in sleeping bags in the master bedroom (thanks Joey for the sleeping bags!).

I wish the bedrooms had night bulbs/night lights.  Also, the bedroom curtains are not heavy and allows light to come through - the room was filed with light at 5 AM, disturbing our sleep.  A heavy curtain in the windows may probably help.  I am giving a 4 star, instead of 5, for the curtains.  "
20868,37147179,2015-07-05,204773,Danielle,My family had a fantastic stay with Jess & Joey; they were extremely hospitable (went out to get fans during the Seattle heat wave) and were very accommodating. My parents love the place and will certainly consider it for future Seattle stays. thank you!
20868,37764370,2015-07-10,35148926,Sundar,"On the positive side, it is a nice place and it helped us with our intended purpose. The condo was fully furnished and the kitchen was well equipped. We happened to rent it during a streak of very hot weather (90F+); despite not having A/C, the unit felt cool with all the fans Jess/Joey had furnished within it. The Internet worked well and I was able to VPN to my workplace all through the day. The Keurig coffee machine saved the day for me.

On the negative side, the neighborhood is little run down; the ceiling is thin which means noise from upstairs can be bothersome. The TV had no Disney Channel which the kids found it hard to deal with. The allotted parking space is hard for large vehicles, but there is space by the roadside that comes in handy at times. The ventilation grill over the microwave needs fixing and significant cleaning."
20868,43020283,2015-08-17,28783297,Tara,This was our first time using air b&b and it was great.  The hosts let us know exactly what to do and what to expect and we're always available if I had questions.  The suite was clean and well stocked with everything we needed.  This was a great experience and thank you to Jess and Joey for hosting us.
20868,55217981,2015-11-29,6760247,Cassidy,"Jess and Joey were great hosts! Even though they were out of town for the holiday weekend, they were quick to respond when we had questions about heat, wifi, etc.  The apartment was comfortable and spacious, with luxurious beds and plenty of room for hanging out with family. We loved having a private entrance and parking spot, and the location was great!"
8307502,48824826,2015-09-28,44790821,Carrie,"We loved our short stay in West Seattle.  The accommodations were absolutely beautiful, and our host was fantastic.  We wished we could have stayed longer and look forward to staying here again in the future.  "
8307502,49667230,2015-10-05,41221476,Andrew,We had an amazing stay. Terry provided everything we needed and then some. The house is in beautiful condition and had more than enough space for four of us. We really couldn't have asked for anything more. 
8307502,50687904,2015-10-13,40160949,Amanda,Terry was amazing. Walked me through the house. Showed me all the ins and outs and provided everything and anything I could possibly need. She is very considerate of her guest needs and went above and beyond make a feel welcome. The house itself is gorgeous. The pictures did not do it justice. Neighborhood was very nice. Roads were a bit confusing but did not take long to figure it all out.
8307502,53484636,2015-11-09,44938188,Shawn,"Terry and her boyfriend were helpful, kind and really passionate about the place.  We threw a dinner party on saturday evening, with about 20 guests total.  The open kitchen, dining and sitting room allowed us to easily accommodate 20 people, the deck would've opened up things even more although it was raining.  Terry was flexible with checkout which helped get the kitchen respectable for the cleaning service.  The master bedroom is gorgeous with an incredible tub/shower that look out over the city waterfront and harbor island.  Parking was a little limited for a group that size but we made it work.  Beds were comfy, kitchen was well stocked with cooking utensils and the double oven was a life saver.  The decor was nice but not so fancy that you were afraid to live in the house.  Warm and inviting.  We would definitely come back."
8307502,54852851,2015-11-25,38857685,Marcy,"Terry is the quintessential hostess.  She went above and beyond to make sure our needs were accommodated.  The house is stocked with lots of extra amenities that make you feel at home. 
The house is beautiful with an amazing view of the city.  The location is perfect for easy access to the West Seattle bridge, and the neighborhood is fun to walk with challenging hills, if desired!
We thoroughly enjoyed our stay!
Thanks, Terry for the wonderful home away from home!"
8307502,55396079,2015-12-01,3654812,Mary,"GREAT PLACE, GREAT VIEW...WONDERFUL ATTENTION FROM THE HOST.  WE SPENT A GREAT LONG WEEKEND AT TERRY'S PLACE.  "
4110396,20465375,2014-09-29,9818686,Dima,"Ali was a great host! He always responded to my messages within minutes and was very polite. I was in Seattle for a symphony audition and he was okay with me practicing violin most of my stay there. 

The location is great! Very close to Pike Place Market and there's a Whole Foods 3min away. The room was very cozy and the view is fabulous! The apartment building is very nice and there's a few restaurants right there (a good Vietnamese spot on the corner of the building). If I'm back in Seattle I would definitely want to stay at this place!"
4110396,22325359,2014-11-03,22175608,Nando(Edgar),"Ali's apartment is awesome! The views are great and everything is close to his place. His place is very clean, neat and comfortable!

He's an excellent host, easy to talk to and always answering all my messages within  minutes. I highly recommend his place and I will definitely stay there again in the future!"
4110396,23976206,2014-12-15,24587998,Max,"Great spot to enjoy the city. Contemporary interior with a warm, homey feel to it. Staying there is way better than at a hotel. Hopefully you get the chance to stay there.
"
4110396,25695488,2015-01-23,25557800,Ryan,"Ali was a great host. Check in was a breeze, the room was exactly as listed and the apartment was cozy, clean and had a  great view of Seattle. I would recommend  this room anyone wanting prime walking distance to most attractions during thier visit to Seattle."
4110396,26279299,2015-02-08,23090068,Josselyn,"Ali is a great host, he advised me and gave me some good deal to discover Seattle. His apartment is nice and it is exactly as on the picture ans with an amazing view on the Space Needle. I recommend this place!"
4110396,26463779,2015-02-13,15743493,Sean,The place is located in the central of downtown area where through the window in the bedroom you can see the Space Needle. The traffic is very convenient and Ali is a responsive host. Had a good night there. 
4110396,26541089,2015-02-15,7010902,Tony,"Ali's place is in a very convenient part of downtown that is pretty much walkable to everywhere. It was very clean and Ali provided everything we needed (towels, soap/shampoo, coffee). On top of that, his place has an amazing view of the space needle."
4110396,28467545,2015-03-24,27360593,Florence,The reservation was canceled the day before arrival. This is an automated posting.
4110396,29761126,2015-04-12,8673992,Eric,"Insane location! Take the light rail to downtown from the airport and you are just a few blocks to the apartment. Close to the convention center and public market etc. Great view from the room, comfortable bed and clean. "
4110396,30080973,2015-04-17,2085868,Gabriel,"Ali is a great guy, very hospitable and attentive. The apartment is clean and neat. Overall a great experience."
4110396,30396773,2015-04-21,29165420,Rick,"What a fantastic time I had - thanks, Ali! The apartment is clean and comfortable with a million-dollar view of downtown Seattle. It has one full bedroom, one full bath, is on the 19th floor in a new building, and walkable to many restaurants, banks and Whole Foods (about a 5-minute walk). Ali is very responsive and it was a real testament to him that he permitted me to stay in his home while he was away on a trip. So, although I didn't get to meet you face to face, Ali - thanks again. You made my trip to Seattle restful and comfortable. "
4110396,31921048,2015-05-11,561156,Frederick,"Of the best places I've stayed for many reasons: one-Ali is a great host. He makes you feel very comfortable and his energy was so chill- felt like staying with family. Second- location, location, location- amazing. Third- the building is new , incredible views and very comfortable! 5 star pad! "
4110396,32369208,2015-05-17,17426660,Jason,Ali was a very friendly and accomodating host.  He was easy to work with and quick to respond to messages.  He keeps his apartment very clean and comfortable.  This apartment is right in the center of Seattle and has a amazing view of the Space Needle and downtown from the 19th floor!  The building has a gym and an observation deck  with a view of the whole city.
4110396,32865257,2015-05-22,33332082,Henry,"Ali's place is great and we would be open to staying at his place again. The apartment is clean and modern. There's a gym in the building which is much appreciated, and the place is a convenient 10-15 min walk to Pike's Market and watering holes on Capitol Hill. You can see for yourself that Ali tends to respond very quickly to messages. He was also pretty accommodating, making check-in a breeze."
4110396,32917638,2015-05-23,32511426,Patrick,"Ali was kind, gentle, and welcoming. Our stay was very quick, just for the night before we caught the ferry, but he made us feel right at home. It is a very convenient location for accessing the pier. Thanks for everything Ali!"
4110396,33708704,2015-05-31,18215523,Siddharth,"This was a great stay. The location is perfect, right close to downtown. The view from the room is lovely. 

Ali is super nice and very easy to work with. He made it easy to coordinate with him as to when we were going to drop by. I'd definitely recommend staying here!"
4110396,33839497,2015-06-01,33274389,Jonathan,This was my first time using Airbnb and it was a great experience. Ali was very nice and accommodating. The room was comfortable and the view was great. Full marks from me.
4110396,34043520,2015-06-03,16807896,Renee,"My first Airbnb experience, and Ali gave me a good one. The space is clean and neat. The location is good. Everything is in a walking distance. Highly recommended."
4110396,34144304,2015-06-05,18742722,Tram,"This is my first airbnb experience where the host is still living at the place (he would sleep on his couch). I thought it was a bit bizarre but Ali was so polite and very informative about Seattle. It just felt like he was our roommate, which we didn't mind at all. He usually travels, I believe, but it so happen he had no travel plans when we booked his place. His apartment is at the perfect location in downtown Seattle. Everything is in walking distance! Which I loved. "
4110396,36189791,2015-06-26,33159328,Shreya,"Ali is a wonderful host, and the views of the Space Needle and its surrounding areas are gorgeous, especially when the sun is setting. Not only that, but Ali was very responsive, provided the essentials we needed, and was very friendly. I highly recommend this place to stay if you want a central location in Seattle with a stellar view (and host)!"
4110396,36319854,2015-06-27,34796223,David,Had my nephew stay a night here and he loved it.  Great views and Ali was friendly.  Thanks Ali.
4110396,36667773,2015-06-30,10235404,Lukas,You can see the spaceneedle from the bedroom wuhuu
4110396,36848484,2015-07-01,34556420,Tiffany,"Overall it was a much better deal than staying in a hotel in Seattle. The view was amazing and the advertisement is accurate. The location is located in a financial district so it feels a little dead in the evening, but it's not a far walk to go out for dinner. I used the place to crash only so I do not think I am good for giving a review. The place was clean enough."
4110396,37025457,2015-07-03,8399990,Enya,"Ali's appartment is beautiful and clean, exactly like on the pictures. It is also ideally located with parking around the building. We haven't met Ali in person but we had a perfect stay at his appartment and the communication was easy and reliable.
Thank you so much Ali!"
4110396,37163705,2015-07-05,5721637,Jim,Description was very accurate. Ali checked in frequently and responded in a very timely fashion. Great stay! 
4110396,37604189,2015-07-08,4149330,Beaureguarde,"This is a great space. Anyone looking to feel a part of the city, should stay here. Ali's correspondence was on point and his space is one I could totally visit again when I'm in town. Thank you for providing this for me. Be back soon for sure! "
4110396,38498779,2015-07-16,12789294,Bas,"Location was pretty much perfect in Seattle. Never far away from anything you want to visit downtown. The room was clean and had the best view of all the Airbnb's I've visited! I mean how can you beat the Space Needle in your bedroom! But Ali is the reason you use Airbnb, he was friendly, easy going and had the very best recommendations! I had an amazing stay! "
4110396,38837823,2015-07-19,24773150,Curtis,"Perfect location if no vehicle. Easy walk to restaurants, Pike's Market or Space Needle. Link Light Rail ($2.75, 40 minutes from airport) drops you within 4 blocks of his place. Clean, as promised, great first Airbnb experience. Thanks Ali. "
4110396,39086301,2015-07-20,34859350,Luolan (Gloria),"We had a wonderful stay at Ali's place! Ali was friendly and easy going. His apartment was clean and comfortable. The view of the Space Needle at night was fantastic! The location is very convenient too, very close to bus stops and downtown. "
4110396,39219546,2015-07-21,3968095,Steve,Ali waited up for me when my flight was delayed and was a gracious host. I arrived late and left early so we didn't interact too much. His house is clean and comfortable - it was much cheaper than a hotel and just as nice.
4110396,39343633,2015-07-22,38620042,Leslie Korengold,"Great location for walking to many attractions.  Outstanding views from both windows of the Space needle, Sound & city (19th floor.). Owner is very polite, quick to respond with any questions and accommodating.
It was the perfect place for me to stay (aka sleep) while in town for less than 24 hours and not have to pay hotel rates."
4110396,39919331,2015-07-27,30599950,Megan,"Location was very central, easy walk to the wharf as well as Capitol hill's great food an bars. The view was fantastic. Kitchen had all supplies needed. Parking was difficult, we ended up spending over $70 to house our car, but a nice stay overall."
4110396,42279000,2015-08-12,36093772,Xin,"The room has a great view to downtown area as it was advertised. Ali is very nice and recommend us some great restaurant nearby.  Room is very clean, has all the supplies needed there. We enjoyed our stay there. Thank you!"
4110396,42675177,2015-08-15,34076721,Jh,"Perfect location! Kind hospitality! and fast response!
everything was perfect so I could satisfactorily enjoy my business trip. Thanks Ali. "
4110396,43036483,2015-08-17,24653944,Matthew,"Ali was a great and thoughtful host. He provided easy access to/from the building and gave us ideas on where to go and the best way to get there. The apartment was clean and well-maintained. The location was perfect - it's centrally located to everything, so getting around by foot was fast and easy. Pike Place Market was about 10 minute walk as is the Space Needle. I would highly recommend staying at Ali's place. And before I forget, the views are incredible - both from the living room and the bedroom. "
4110396,43675357,2015-08-21,5767961,Bryce,"I only stayed for one night and was very impressed by the views! Ali was great about communication and everything went smoothly. 

Just FYI: Depending on the time of day you get into Seattle traffic and parking can be a bit of a challenge in this part of the city. "
4110396,44125682,2015-08-24,14469743,The,"The apartment was really nice, had everything necessary for a great stay. The location is excellent  - about a 15 minute walk to Pike Place Market, 4 blocks to Whole Foods and 3 blocks to the link rail. Ali maintained contact throughout our stay to answer any questions that arose. "
4110396,44561909,2015-08-27,13004495,Demetri,"Apartment was great -- totally clean and with views even better than promised. Easy to get in and out and right in the center of town. Didn't get to meet Ali in person, but he was very responsive and friendly via email. Couldn't imagine an easier, better home base for my stay in Seattle."
4110396,45365867,2015-09-02,5837988,Joseph,"Great location, very clean and comfortable. Would stay there again."
4110396,45704728,2015-09-05,15401013,Haley,"Ali's apartment was AMAZING.  
Exactly as described and more! 

Ali was very accommodating to adjustments with our schedule and delays. As well as very fast at communicating; he was available at all hours for any questions I had. 

I would absolutely stay again!"
4110396,45950770,2015-09-07,37684770,Amy,"Ali was very responsive and his apartment was great! The view of the city and the space needle from his apartment is amazing! The best thing about Ali's apartment is that it is in the middle of EVERYTHING. Downtown, pike's place/market, space needle, & aquarium/piers are all within walking distance. If you're a tech nerd, the location is right next to Amazon (hehe). "
4110396,46290955,2015-09-09,39878994,D.L.,"Ali's place is very nice and has a great view! Unfortunately our paths didn't cross and we we're able to meet in person, but communication with him was great and we had a very positive first Airbnb experience."
4110396,47206245,2015-09-16,7229520,Dannielle,"Wow! This place is amazing. The location is fantastic meaning you don't need a car.  All you have to do is hop on the light link from the airport and walk a few blocks and you're there.  The view is fabulous and it's fun to watch the float planes land on Lake Union, at see the Space Needle at night. Another great perk is there's a Whole Foods only a couple of blocks away.  The building is secure and everyone is really friendly, and there's a nice rooftop patio on the 11th floor.  Lastly, Ali was very welcoming and friendly and made the whole process easy."
4110396,47338968,2015-09-17,43634332,Kris,Great place! Great communication and for the price and location we were very happy!
4110396,48074609,2015-09-23,7204494,Nancy,"Staying at Ali's place was our first Airbnb experience, and it was positive in every way.  Ali was easy to communicate with and anxious to make sure we were comfortable and happy.  The view of the Space Needle was breathtaking and a highlight of our trip.  We loved using his spacious kitchen, and grilling some delicious halibut from Pike's Market.  Our favorite places were just a 5-10 minute walk, including Whole Foods at just 3 blocks away.  It couldn't have been more convenient.  Thanks to Ali, we arrived excited to begin our adventure, and left refreshed.  The bed, and even the pillows were perfect.  As a result, we'll be anxious to us Airbnb again."
4110396,48300019,2015-09-25,42122496,Sebastian,First time booking at Airbnb and it was totally awesome. Though he was out of town there was no problem getting in and finding everything. Communication was very good. The place was just a couple blocks from space needle or pike place market away. Can just recommend this place. 
4110396,49003871,2015-09-30,31485119,Brett R,"What a great accommodation with unbelievable downtown/streetscape views. It was everything described and even better once I arrived. Ali made the arrangements to get me in remotely and everything was beyond me expectations. Thanks for the usage of the Fitness, Theatre, and Office Rooms. The Kourig Coffee and Gas Grill for the steaks was a win-win. If back in Seattle, you can bet we will be back. Thanks Ali! "
4110396,49452870,2015-10-04,41423517,Steven,"Ali was a great host! The place was very nice and was only a few blocks from everything. 

Tip: If coming from the airport, take the Link Train which cost about $3 per ticket. This will take to about 4 blocks away from Ali's place. From there, you can either walk or take an Uber."
4110396,49717987,2015-10-05,5887653,Natasha,"Ali was fantastic! He was very communicative through out our stay and made our arrival very simple. I sat and chatted with him for a while - what a nice guy! His place is gorgeous, overwhelmingly gorgeous views, comfy bed, everything was wonderful. Next time I'm in Seattle I will definitely be staying with him!"

4110396,50425870,2015-10-12,17341794,Crystal,"Despite confusion and miscommunication on my arrival time, Ali was quick to ensure I got in safely and set up the room for me. He was helpful in recommending places to eat at and how to get around Seattle. Would recommend Ali as a host."
4110396,51519808,2015-10-20,20311573,Bart,"The view was amazing, and the neighborhood has everything you need."
4110396,51755540,2015-10-24,40743660,Bree,Great location. Ali was helpful; gave food suggestions that were within walking distance and helped me figure out public transit to his place.
4110396,52494518,2015-10-30,3994236,Hakeem,"It is simply Amazing. Everything went as planned, even though I did not have the chance to meet with Ali, he made everything available for my stay. The place is clean in a well-secured building & in a nice location with spectacular views.

I would definitly stay here again when visiting Seattle."
4110396,53237309,2015-11-06,35248859,Paul,Great stay and very last minute ! 
4110396,53367252,2015-11-08,46340615,Michelle,"We loved Ali's place! Ali was responsive so check in and out was super easy! The place is very modern and the view is spectacular, just amazing. His pictures don't do the place justice, it's a lot better than it looks. Comfortable bed and all the channels on tv you'd want. Location is also walking distance to literally everything in Downtown. I'd love to come back here next time I'm back in Seattle! "
4110396,54141024,2015-11-16,4728369,Ariana,"The location was the absolute best. We were able to walk 10 minutes and be right in the middle of Pike Place Market or we could walk 20 minutes in be in Capital Hill watching live jazz or drinking cider. The view is pretty awesome if it's not raining :) While I didn't meet Ali, he made sure that I had access to everything I needed during my stay. If I had a question he would respond almost immedately! If I were to come to Seattle again- I'd definately try and stay at Ali's. "
4110396,55712520,2015-12-05,4107806,Kobe,Very nice and comfortable 
4110396,56546973,2015-12-14,18521593,태형,He was very kind to us also friendly even tough we didn't talk too much because we had to look around downtown Seattle and we felt exhausted just one night two days trips but Ali's house has really good night view:) we were very comfortable in Ali's house!!
2693700,13799587,2014-06-04,2307730,Jo And Jacob,"This is simply the best AirBnB, exactly why I love this site. Spotlessly clean, bright and colorful, surrounded by flowers and a fantastic view of the sunset from the porch, private entrance, full modern kitchen with everything you need, huge bathroom, I cannot recommend a stay here enough. 

The LOCATION alone! There are no hotels in Fremont, and it is the absolute best place to stay in Seattle. Right next to the canal and the Burke-Gilman trail, you can bike very conveniently or just walk to the tons of shops, coffee houses, bars, restaurants, and general artistic quirky charm that makes Fremont so great. Parking on the street was no trouble, even on the weekend, and we found the Oasis to be central and perfect for exploring downtown, Ballard, North and West Seattle.

Manuela has shared her home and seriously underpriced it's value, so I can only hope the people who are lucky enough to book here are fully respectful and appreciative, so they don't ruin it for everyone. She's a warm and responsive host, available but gave us complete privacy during our stay (we never saw the family at all, a son and husband, thank you to you both as well for sharing your beautiful home!), so we felt like we had a very safe and very private home during our vacation, which is priceless, and made the trip really great and worry-free. 

This is the ideal of an AirBnb, don't miss out if you're staying in Seattle!

2693700,13980402,2014-06-09,209416,Kara,"The apartment was absolutely lovely, exactly what we were looking for. Everything was clean (like new) and good quality. We were able to prepare a wonderful meal utilizing the kitchen. The bed was also very comfortable. It was charming, colorful, private, and felt like a home away from home. Manuela was also a great hostess. She provided a list of places to go in Fremont and surrounding neighborhoods upon arrival. If there was anything extra we needed, she was happy to accommodate. I would give this apartment the highest possible recommendation...a real gem."
2693700,14203773,2014-06-14,690307,Solomon,"Enjoyed our stay at this lovely studio in Fremont.  Manuela left us a couple beers, some coffee and a great set of nearby restaurant suggestions!  It's near a busy street though, so if you're a light sleeper you may want something to block the road noise."
2693700,14359900,2014-06-17,6556636,Andy,"Fantastic!  Truly an urban oasis.  Fremont is a very happening part of town, as is Ballard.  Good bus service between downtown, Fremont and Ballard make this a great spot for folks on foot.  Personally, I had a wonderful experience walking to the Ballard Locks and all the way up to Carkeek park via Golden Gardens beach.  That's some distance, but a lovely NW Seattle experience.  Manuela is a great host and the space is exactly as described in the listing.  Highly recommended and I would be happy to return."
2693700,14456075,2014-06-19,16787171,Maitri,We had a very restful stay. We felt right at home. It was a perfect amount of space for us. The patio and garden outside were a wonderful bonus. The kitchen was well equipped. So nice to be able to cook our oatmeal for breakfast and heat up our restaurant leftovers with freshly cooked rice. (We brought our own rice cooker.) Manuela is a very gentle and kind host.
2693700,14783601,2014-06-26,13621963,Patrick,"Loved the place!  It really is as nice as the photos posted.  The neighborhood was great, plenty of walking to enjoy and easy bus access.  Fremont is truly a wonderful place with so much character, and this urban oasis fit in well.  Manuela was a great host who checked on us and made sure everything went as well as possible.  I would recommend this place to anyone who travels to beautiful Seattle!"
2693700,14922866,2014-06-29,10932259,Lishka,"We LOVED Manuela's Fremont Urban Oasis. The place was so clean and comfortable. Also beautifully decorated. I loved the round knitted rugs.  Manuela left a local beer and local coffee for us to enjoy upon arrival and for our stay. Very thoughtful host. The location was perfect. We walked into the super cute Fremont neighborhood, for good food, drinks and music. The surrounding neighborhood felt very safe and nice.  I would totally rent this apartment full time if I could. Thanks Manuela for a great stay in Seattle!"
2693700,15142821,2014-07-03,130055,Kelli,"The Fremont Urban Oasis was perfect for our family's recent vacation to the Seattle area.  Manuela and her family were extremely welcoming and have prepared the space with comfort and style in mind.  The fresh-baked cookies and fresh-picked flowers on the table when we arrived immediately let us know that we were being cared for. :)  Manuela's son was so sweet to share his toys with our 15-month-old, too!

Fremont is a super cool city with so many fun things to do!  We loved the Fremont Troll, the farmer's market on Sunday, Theo's chocolate factory, ETC Coffee, and the many beautiful parks and restaurants.  Staying outside of the big ""city"" gave us just the experience we always look for when using airbnb.  Thank you for another great time!  "
2693700,15229258,2014-07-05,16329321,Jen,"We absolutely loved our stay at the Fremont Urban Oasis with Manuela!  She is so  kind, and clearly put a lot of thought, time, and love into this home-away-from-home.  
Fremont is such a lovely neighborhood, and it was nice to be so close to downtown Seattle, yet finding such a homey place to stay outside of the city.  This place truly is an urban oasis, and I would stay here again if I find myself in Seattle.  The garden is beautiful, and they have put so much though into making this apartment feel like a home.  "
2693700,15324638,2014-07-07,10843562,Jenn,"We loved our time in Seattle at Manuela's beautiful studio. The rooms were so clean and inviting with lots of wonderful personal touches like  beautiful flowers on the table when we arrived and delicious coffee. The kitchen had all the dishes we needed to cook a full dinner, and the bed was incredibly comfortable. Manuela was great to communicate with and had lots of maps and information for our stay. It was a great location, just a minute from two major bus lines that go downtown and walking distance to Fremont, Ballard, and the Burke-Gilman trail which we ran and biked on. We would love to stay there again some day if were ever back in the area. "
2693700,15927362,2014-07-18,17386952,Mabel,"Manuela's place is exactly as described. The studio is charming and perfect for two people. We definitely were not disappointed. Location allowed easy access to the bus (like a minute walk away) and the trail lead us through a more scenic route towards fremont. We were gone most of the day exploring and it was a relief to be back at the studio for a relaxing shower and comfortable bed to sleep in. Manuela was also a wonderful host. She respected our privacy but would respond to our questions via text right away when we had any. She helped us with directions and provided excellent recommendations on places to visit and how to get there. When we plan to visit Seattle again, we will definitely look into staying here once more. "
2693700,16013234,2014-07-20,754353,Caroline,"Had so wonderful days in this beautiful studio. Everything was great. Michaela was so nice and helpful. We used the bikes to discover some parts of Seattle. In our opinion it´s the best way to get to know the city. So sad we had just three nights. We will come back definitely!!!
Caroline & Marcel"
2693700,16249693,2014-07-24,13895450,Wendy,Great place to stay...just as it was advertised!  Very comfortable and walking distance to so much including Lake Union.  Would highly recommend this as a great place to stay except if your easily annoyed by noise...can hear the street and footsteps upstairs.
2693700,16379104,2014-07-26,18426608,Michael,"Spacious, comfortable and private. The suite was exactly what we were looking for. Very impressed by the design and fit out, every aspect well thought out.  

Close to great restaurants in Ballard and Fremont. And when we weren't eating out, it was easy to prepare meals in the well appointed kitchen. 

Manuela was very helpful,  providing recommendations on what to see in Seattle and when. 

If I'm fortunate enough to return to Seattle I would not hesitate in staying here again."
2693700,16513992,2014-07-28,1912737,William,"The stay with Manuela was very nice.  Exactly what we were looking for.  Spacious setting, comfortable bed, nestled in a very cool part of town.  She gave us tips on where to go eat including the cpp market place where my girlfriend and I grabbed some lunch and walked over to river to enjoy our meal.  Overall our stay was very nice and would highly recommend it."
2693700,16662913,2014-07-31,16549432,Malia,"Manuela's studio was exactly as it was listed: clean, quaint, and close to shops and restaurants.  It is also walking distance from the trail that leads to Lake Union. Perfect for a morning run or afternoon walk. Manuela was a wonderful host and accommodated us greatly. She left us a list of restaurants and attractions nearby, as well as local coffee beans and beer to make our stay that much more enjoyable. (Go to Paseos! It was fantastic!) If we head up to Seattle again, we will make sure to stay here. "
2693700,16897076,2014-08-04,1931827,Mallory,"Loved staying here. It was very comfortable and close to everything that Fremont has to offer, not to mention great bike paths to get to other parts of town. Would love to stay here again, Manuela was a darling host. Bed was comfy, wifi worked okay, and the coffee she left us was delicious. "
2693700,17184437,2014-08-08,3755688,Jowi,"Manuela was a great host! She even brought toys for the kids, and responded swift and kind to all of our questions. She gave us great tips and was fun to talk with. Fremont itself is a gem; feels like a friendly village in a big city. Feels like coming home. The Fremont Urban Oasis is just as described. You will hear the steps of Manuela and her son above your head but they're very considerate and not noisy at all. Would stay there again in a heartbeat."
2693700,17504145,2014-08-13,16106348,Theresa,"Manuela was very welcoming. She walked us through the apartment and showed us everything we needed to know when we arrived. She said she'd be available if we needed anything else. She included a list of recommended restaurants in the area, maps, and bus schedules

The apartment was well equipped and just as described. Everything was clean, and it felt very safe and private. 

The neighborhood was nice and quiet, but within walking distance to downtown Fremont (with bars, restaurants, and shops). There was also a bus stop right at the end of the road. 

We would definitely stay here again if we were ever in the area. "
2693700,17752309,2014-08-17,16312383,Amy,"Our host Manuela left a base of beautiful fresh flowers for our arrival!
The place was exactly as described and was very cozy and comfortable.  Fremont is a lovely neighborhood with too many restaurants to choose from! The kitchen and bathroom were full
Size and very clean and tidy.  The big bed was comfortable also.
We loved this little home away from home and would be very happy to stay here again should we return to Seattle. "
2693700,18004921,2014-08-20,11574996,Lynn,"Manuela's house was perfection. My friend and I loved our stay so much we have already said we would like to stay there everytime we go to Seattle. It was clean, spacious and beautiful. She was a great host. "
2693700,18625309,2014-08-29,4912177,John,"This was our first visit to the area, so staying in the Fremont area was a perfect way to see many different parts of Seattle.  The busline is very close and there is much to do within walking distance.  The studio is very neat, clean and cozy.  Many maps of the area and the bus/ferry schedules are provided as well as recommendations for places to eat, etc.  Manuela was a great host, very friendly and made sure that we had everything we needed.  I would wholeheartedly recommend others to stay here, and I would definitely stay here again if I am back in the area."
2693700,18877345,2014-09-02,16550979,Jennifer,"Agree w/reviewer who said this place is ultimate AirBnB. Exactly as described, clean, airy, spacious, perfect. Host was available and responsive by text but left us completely alone, which I totally prefer. Space was private; a little traffic noise during rush hour but otherwise bucolic. Location cannot be beat, nor can the price. I enjoyed it very much and hope to stay again. (Also, big tub to take a nice soak in, which was great on the cool & rainy day we stayed.)

This was my first AirBnB experience and I'm afraid it has totally spoiled me."
2693700,19078799,2014-09-06,15709688,Joanna,"We had a great stay at Manuela's place. Manuela was very welcoming and left us maps and guides and gave us some really nice tips (Paseo included :0)). The apartment is lovely - it has everything you would need and is clean and very comfortable. Fremont is a fab neighbourhood; full of cool shops, restaurants, cafes and bars. We didn't have a car, but it was easy to reach downtown Seattle by bus (the bus stop is just down the road from the apartment). If you stay here you'll have great time in Seattle!"
2693700,19275715,2014-09-09,4011357,Irene,"We loved the studio! It was immaculate upon our arrival; very clean, well decorated with lovely furniture and has a large comfortable bed and comforter.

Manuela is a sweet host and she left us a vase of flowers upon our arrival as well as tips on restaurants nearby and tasty coffee. She also checked in with us to make sure we had everything we needed. If it's not on the restaurant list, I would also add Joule and A Whale Wins (amazing clams!).

Thanks for letting us stay!



"
2693700,19347711,2014-09-10,439840,Brian,"This is a beautiful and comfortable apartment is a great neighborhood!  I would highly recommend a stay.  The space is perfectly clean!  It's modern and cute.  There is lots of light and nice privacy.  It has a great kitchen and bathroom.  The bed is wonderful.  There is a nice garden that you can see that is perfect.  There is lots of good and interesting places eat and see.  

Manuela is a perfect hostess!  Commutations were very easy and she was completely responsive.  It could not have been easier.

Yes, I love this place and I would highly recommend!!!
"
2693700,19418706,2014-09-12,10331180,Stephanie,"I stayed at the Fremont Urban Oasis while I was in Seattle for work. It was perfect. The location couldn't be better as it is so close to amazing walking/running trails, and to great places to eat and drink. The apartment is clean, bright, cozy and had everything I needed. The bed was so comfy. I can't wait to stay again soon. "
2693700,19596852,2014-09-15,4919659,Sean,"We really liked this place.  It was a sweet, private apartment in a great Seattle neighborhood.  It delivered as advertised."
2693700,19975365,2014-09-21,8586552,Matthew,"Manuelas' place was fantastic. Came down to watch the seahawks stomp the broncos (again). Her garden suite was clean, quiet and was a quick 10 min cab ride to the stadium. (About 15 bux).  The welcome bottle of beer in the fridge was appreciated as was the little book of local destinations. Freemont itself is a great neighborhood with plenty of great bars and restaurants. If it wasnt for the game we probably would have just hung out in Freemont for the two days we were there. Would def stay here again, thanks Manuela!-Matt & Mark."
2693700,20086948,2014-09-23,11518761,Kaline,"We've seen quite a few nice Airbnb apartments during our travels on the West Coast, but Manuela's urban oasis in Seattle would win the price for the most perfect and cozy temporary home. The apartment is located in beautiful Fremont, provided more than everything we needed (great bed, great shower, great kitchen) and was arranged and designed with a lot of love. Thank you for the warm welcome, Manuela, we would have loved to stay longer than 2 nights and definitely would come back! "
2693700,20238994,2014-09-26,19253472,Stephanie,"Just returned home after 5 days in Seattle and surrounding areas. The Fremont Oasis was just that - peaceful, welcoming, comfortable, everything was as listed, and met all of my needs for the two night stay. It's located in Fremont - very cute neighborhood with plenty of restaurants and cafes (Uneeda Burger and Lighthouse Roasters were my visits), and it's close to activities and parks. Easy to find, would definitely visit again. "
2693700,20492180,2014-09-30,9956342,Lynn,"Excellent communication - and just a lovely place!!  Great cooking kitchen, with a wonderful glass enclosed outdoor area. We would highly recommend it!!"
2693700,21125661,2014-10-12,19002427,Alison,"Manuela was a great host and we loved the space!  Everything we needed was there, and the location was fabulous.  It was exactly as described, quiet, and it was so nice to have a full kitchen.  The location is walking distance to everything in Fremont, and it's a short drive to downtown Seattle (10-15 minutes).  Very private - it felt like home!"
2693700,21658747,2014-10-21,134653,Margaret,"I loved staying here for several nights. Between the down comforter, plenty of on-street parking, a full kitchen, and cozy atmosphere it was perfect. The home address is very well marked on the garage door, which made our midnight arrival easy. It really felt like a home away from home. Manuela was easy to communicate with and was readily available. It was also so nice to be just a few minutes away from morning Top Pot Doughnut runs as well as a variety of restaurants in Ballard. In all, I wouldn't hesitate to stay again! "
2693700,21802452,2014-10-24,3484556,Sadie,Great stay!  Super cute place with all details for a good experience thought out. 
2693700,22019439,2014-10-28,7335806,Shannon,"If ever there was a cozy place to rest after days of outdoor adventuring, it was Manuela's. My favorite part of staying at the oasis was the extra long tub and the teas Manuela so kindly left for me (as I imagine she does for all of her guests)! Super clean, comfortable, and easy. Thank you."
2693700,22107259,2014-10-30,1639347,Amy,"We were very welcomed by Manuela.  We had a bit of trouble finding her Fremont Urban Oasis but a short phone call brought us directly to the door.  The Urban Oasis is very well appointed and attention to detail remarkable.  This was one of the best equipped home/apartment locations we have visited.  Beautiful view atop a city hill! We were impressed with the completeness of the kitchen and its readiness to accommodate a fine meal ""at home""!  The Fremont Urban Oasis has a very comfortable queen bed with a fabulous comforter!  Hope we can stay again and again!  Amy and Bill"
2693700,22373398,2014-11-04,2697894,Carol,"Our stay at the Fischer's studio was just as described: an ""urban oasis"".
It was wonderful to have such a cozy, inviting space to come back to after exploring the surrounding areas. Every detail was covered and there was a clear set of instructions about functional aspects like the thermostat and the lock on the door, etc. Manuaela expressed being available if there were any questions and concerns and the few times I reached out, she was quick to respond. I would most definitely recommend this comfortable airbnb destination for anyone staying in the area."
2693700,22657412,2014-11-11,15688684,Jewel,The place was just as adorable as you see in the photos! It is more than fully equipped and very private. Manuela was also very nice during our brief encounters and always easily reachable. The place is in a safe and quiet neighborhood and  is a short walk away from the Fremont center and a quick drive away from Ballard.
2693700,23053023,2014-11-21,15121499,Kathryn,"Manuela is a fantastic host. She made me feel welcome from the moment I arrived. The space is so lovely and in just the perfect location. Really, a dream listing! Thank you Manuela!"
2693700,23152237,2014-11-24,21616695,Heather,"Our stay was delightful. The location was perfect for our leisurely weekend, and perfect for use of public transportation to get us to the Seahawks game. The studio was perfect; decorated beautifully and equipped with everything necessary for a comfy stay."
2693700,23268461,2014-11-27,22592734,Kaylen,"This place is adorable and very homey! As an added bonus, it's about a 5 minute walk to shops in ""dowtown"" Fremont and a 25 minute walk to Ballard. The bus stop is also on the corner, which is great for exploring the greater Seattle area.  

Manuela was completely accommodating as a host. We were greeted with a Fremont Brewery beer in the fridge, local coffee, and a list of her favorite nearby spots (try the Carpenter and the Whale for upscale dining, but beware it shares a building with another restaurant, Chippy's, which can easily be mistaken but also has a great happy hour). The apartment is situated under her family's house, but you can't even tell they're there save the occasional light footstep.  We were told they are unable to hear anything that happens in the apartment, and we do keep later hours and listen to music at night, so this was proven to be true.

Though we were out and about for most of our vacation, Manuela seems very open to questions, concerns, etc. We did stay over Thanksgiving and requested to stay a little later because our flight was at night, and she was completely open and gracious about our request. Overall, a great experience and highly recommended!"
2693700,23430611,2014-12-01,262611,Jane,"Fremont Urban Oasis is great! The space is absolutely charming and warm. There are lots of fluffy towels and great dishes and it has a super comfortable feeling. Manuela was there when we arrived and told us everything we needed to know. There was a great menu and store guide. We loved that there was no t.v. It is in the basement of the hosts' home, so if you don't like a little noise, this might not be the place for you. The garden and seating is also quaint with great views. We absolutely felt like we were in another place; like France or the country even though it is literally right in between Fremont and Ballard. We can't wait to go in the summer and have a glass of wine o the patio. Oh, the patio is private. The bed was great and the duvet felt like a warm hug. The in floor heating made things extremely comfortable and we were there in the freezing cold. Nice work on re-modeling the space. The personal objects and pictures made us feel like we were visiting a friend."
2693700,23578307,2014-12-05,4351928,Sangon,Manuela's place was one of the most beautiful and well equipped among all airbnb I stayed. Price is reasonable. location was perfect for whom drives car. I love her room setting. Bathroom and kitchen are very cute and have a nice touch. Overall it was super nice. I can't have a single complaint about this place.
2693700,23633132,2014-12-07,22904767,Robert,The apartment was clean and ready for our arrival.  We were informed where to find the key prior to our arrival.  A binder was provided with important information about the apartment and neighborhood.
2693700,23945957,2014-12-15,5742193,Stephanie,"Manuela met us when we arrived, showing us around, telling us about how to use the key.  The place had its Christmas lights on, which definitely welcomed us and when we returned after doing some initial shopping more xmas lights were on outside the place. Manuela told us to ask for anything we needed. We also saw Manuela when we went to leave."
2693700,24087405,2014-12-19,15121499,Kathryn,"I love this place! I've stayed here a few times now and will book every time I am in Seattle and it is available. Absolutely gorgeous home, Manuela is a wonderful host, the location is awesome..what's not to love!!!"
2693700,24322799,2014-12-26,6654442,Tasmin,"The Urban Oasis is a lovely little hideaway in Fremont. Well thought out design; it was cosy and modern at the same time. There is a full kitchen - complete with everything you would need to make Christmas dinner! We also really liked that Manuela supports local businesses and you get to taste their products during your stay. We did hear a fair amount of foot traffic from above during our stay, but we were staying over the holiday period when everyone stays home (including us) far more than usual. The deep bathtub with mood lighting was a favourite as well as the underfloor heating. The studio is within walking distance from landmarks and shops. We had a great stay. "
2693700,24531698,2014-12-30,5898186,Holly,"This space was perfect for our stay in Seattle.  It had everything we needed, was very comfortable and we loved the way it was set up.  Was a great base for exploring Fremont and Ballard.  We had our own car and never had problems finding parking in front of the house. Manuela was very helpful and responsive throughout the process.  We would definitely stay here again! "
2693700,25080740,2015-01-06,3766917,Sean,"My wife and I enjoyed our stay in the Fremont Urban Oasis.  Manuela was a gracious host.  The apartment is warm and comfortable, and surprisingly private, given it's a floor of a family home.   Because of it's position on a hill, we never saw anyone through any of the windows, which made it quite a nice retreat.  The kitchen proved perfectly adequate for our occasional cooking.  The neighborhood is good for walking, being nicely placed between good bars and restaurants, a grocery store, a great coffee shop up the hill called Lighthouse Coffee, and the lovely Woodland Park Zoo.  

The Fremont Urban Oasis is a basement apartment.  We definitely heard noise overhead from the pets and children.  So if you are after a very quiet spot this place probably isn't for you.   (The noise was clustered in the morning ~8AM and evening ~7PM with relative quiet in between.) But if you are looking for a quiet spot, Fremont probably isn't for you either.  
"
2693700,25591825,2015-01-20,9648899,Alyssa,"Amazing location with an easy walk to local Fremont businesses. Manuela's apt is lovely and warm, with all of the kitchen amenities to make the stay easy. She made it very easy for us to get into the apt and feel welcome through our visit. Look forward to returning!"
2693700,25741495,2015-01-25,13584908,Peggy,"This is a lovely place in a great area. Oasis is an accurate description; it's perched above Fremont and is very private.  The space is beautiful and comfortable, and Manuela was a wonderful host."
2693700,25908348,2015-01-29,16496578,Drasi,I felt extremely welcome and communications were timely and excellent! The place is adorable.
2693700,25983423,2015-01-31,26556405,Jennifer,Such a nice place to stay and Manuela was very helpful and friendly!
2693700,26023161,2015-02-01,3504523,Ned,"The Fremont Urban Oasis made a perfect home-away-from-home while my girlfriend and I were visiting Seattle. Very comfortable, with plenty of natural light, and tasteful and creative furnishings. Manuela was a terrific host! Super friendly and easy to communicate with. We plan to book a stay at the Urban Oasis again, the next time we are in Seattle."
2693700,26214173,2015-02-07,10331180,Stephanie,"The apartment is clean, welcoming and has everything that I need. "
2693700,26514848,2015-02-14,25094894,Matt,Our host was very kind in preparing the place on such short notice.  Great little studio.  Very quiet location.  Quality furnishings.  10 minutes walk from the best places in Freemont.  The thoughtfully landscaped patio is refreshing and fun.
2693700,26584476,2015-02-16,4120288,Paul,"We felt very comfortable, she met us when we arrived and showed us around the space in her beautiful home.  We had a great time.  The bar of Theo's chocolate, made in Freemont was a nice extra touch.  Great chocolate and great space."
2693700,26800064,2015-02-19,15026495,Sarah,Manuela's little apartment was just what I needed for a little relaxation time. The sitting area was peaceful even with the traffic near by and the sunset was beautiful. Her place was a wonderful home away from home.
2693700,26940429,2015-02-22,2929485,Amy,"Manuela is a great host.  She made sure that our expectations were set before we arrived and had contingency plans for us if we couldn't meet up.  She made sure we had fresh coffee for breakfast, which is a requirement in Seattle.  Overall, it was a great and welcoming experience!"
2693700,27279073,2015-03-01,1126217,Randy,"I did not get a chance to meet Manuela, but her communications were excellent.  We arrived a bit early, and she left the key for us.  The studio was immaculate!  It was cleaner than most hotels!  It was exactly as pictured, with all kitchen appliances, an excellent bathroom, comfy bed, and plenty of towels.  Free on street parking is a big plus in Seattle!  There is only one word of caution:  the 15 or so front steps could be a problem if you have bad knees.  Highly recommend this place; we will stay here next trip up to Seattle if we can..."
2693700,27454731,2015-03-04,4317503,Eva,A lovely little apartment in a great location close to all the popular spots. West facing for great afternoon light! Nice and modern. Very clean. Great kitchen and bath tub! The only thing to point out is that the owner lives above and there is some noise from walking. It did not bother us because we were out for dinner and it stopped by 8pm. Manuela was prompt and we met briefly for a nice chat. We d stay here again. It was lovely! Thank you! 
2693700,27694755,2015-03-09,6306339,Naomi,"Beautiful cottage, private and relaxing yet walking distance from the water, shops, and restaurants! The space is perfectly equipped for visitors and Manuela is a great host, very accommodating to our unpredictable travel schedule."
2693700,27846423,2015-03-13,8935574,Sarah,"This is a cute little apartment in a great location close to nice restaurants and public transportation. West facing for great afternoon light! Nice and modern. Very clean. Great kitchen and bathroom! The only issue for some folks might be that the owner and her family live above (as this is a basement apartment) and so you can hear noise above you. It usually stops by 10PM but if you go to bed early, are a light sleeper, or might be jet-lagged it might cause some problems. For the most part it wasn't an issue but I did get woken up in the middle of the night once from noise above. Otherwise this is a great place and would recommend it."
2693700,28126829,2015-03-18,8998087,Julian And Shanna,"Manuela's Urban Oasis is everything we could have wanted. The bed was comfortable, the kitchen useful, the patio area private and contemplative. Well worth the money. Manuela was gracious, unobtrusive and incredibly accommodating. Probably the cleanest air B&B I've ever been in. Really central and quiet location. We walked everywhere.  Perfect visit!"
2693700,28318757,2015-03-22,20841749,Gabriel,"When I arrived, Manuela gave me a quick tour of the well-furnished suite and I was left to discover a few local treats she'd left for us. Her decorative touches have made it a cozy place to base a longer visit – we could easily have stayed for a stretch.

The kitchen is fully stocked and the gas stove and convection oven are possibly the best I've ever cooked on. Everything there and throughout the space feels like a well put-together home. "
2693700,28797684,2015-03-30,1984749,Mallory,"Manuela met us at the door and that was the beginning of a memorable week. Her house is comfortable, spacious, and beautifully appointed. The kitchen is stocked with every thing needed to cook a full course meal; which we did one night, instead of eating out. We enjoyed sitting on the sofa reading, and sipping drinks. I think the bed and duvet were the most comfortable I've ever slept on! The patio is perfect for sitting and watching the hummingbirds. 
Fremont, a vibrant neighborhood, with vintage stores, restaurants, groceries, and Flying Apron, a gluten free bakery, is an easy walk along the Burke-Gilman trail. Also nearby is Ballard another foodie neighborhood.
I highly recommend staying at Fremont Urban Oasis and will most definitely stay there again!"
2693700,29285620,2015-04-06,1982100,Janet  & Ram,We really enjoyed our stay at Manuela's. She was very easy to communicate with. The studio was a very sweet space and the bed was so comfortable. We would love to come back and stay again!
2693700,29563726,2015-04-09,1442773,Suzanne,"Manuela was in constant contact which made communication very easy.  House was adorable and clean, and in a great, accessible neighborhood."
2693700,30137586,2015-04-18,28833372,Pashtoun,"The room was absolutely charming. Not only was the space welcoming, bed comfortable, and deep soaking tub delightful, but our host left special treats for us like local coffee, bath salts, chocolate, and quality staples. We enjoyed the tasteful music and reading the books. The outdoor patio was gorgeous. We can't say enough good things about this place or our host. For those of you who are sensitive to noise, there was some foot traffic since the host and her family live above the apartment, but it didn't bother us."
2693700,30423481,2015-04-21,2348225,Ryan,"Manuela was a wonderful host - great communication.   Charming, clean and quiet room, with close proximity to everything you would need.  I would stay again."
2693700,30535236,2015-04-23,15121499,Kathryn,My stay here was perfect! This is the third time I have stayed in Manuela's home and I just love it. The aesthetic is so great! Location is perfect! Super comfy bed. A perfect place to call home.
2693700,30777095,2015-04-27,13412218,Jessica,"We had a lovely stay at the Urban Oasis; the space is comfortable and tasteful.   As is mentioned, it is a downstairs unit; we were woken up early by the noise upstairs.  Otherwise, everything was great; sweet space and great location."
2693700,31066282,2015-05-01,18121805,Sara,"We had the most wonderful stay with Manuela, I only wish we were there for longer. The apartment is so comfortable and welcoming, and the garden patio is amazing. Manuela greeted us when we arrived and made sure had everything we needed. We were within walking distance of everything we came to Seattle to do, the whole trip was just right. I would recommend this listing to anyone, and I hope I get to stay here again!"
2693700,31282385,2015-05-04,22320601,Ralf,"Ein herzliches Willkommen durch Manuela in einem tollen Appartment, ruhige Lage in einem sehr schönen Teil von Seattle, ideal für Fußgänger wie wir oder auch Radfahrer. Etwas weg vom Großstadtgetummel, aber super gut erreichbar. Sehr gute Parkmöglichkeiten, nahe gelegene Geschäfte und Restaurants. Die Unterkunft bietet alles, was man braucht, und auch ein bißchen mehr. Einfach ideal für einen Trip nach Seattle, absolut empfehlenswert. Dankeschön für alles, wir kommen sehr gern wieder und dann für einen längeren Aufenthalt, da Seattle und die Umgebung unglaublich viel zu bieten haben."
2693700,31883276,2015-05-11,10213931,Harry And Jessica,"Manuela was a great host and her place is excellent. With good communication, check in was easy and the apartment was available despite arriving early. Everything was clean and as presented in the photos; different bedding was available in case it was too warm; there were fresh flowers on the table as we came in, as well as some chocolate, and local beers in the fridge. Although the flat is directly under Manuela's home it is secluded and very peaceful; the sun takes its time getting round to you but in the afternoon it's a pleasure to sit outside on the patio. The Burke-Gilman Trail runs down by the river (and extends for 12 miles) which makes for good runs, and you can easily walk to Gas Works Park to sit on a hill overlooking Lake Union (sunset recommendation). There is a comprehensive welcome pack and plenty of suggestions for food / drink / activities, but Fred Meyers superstore is about a ten minute walk if you're cooking for yourself.

If you're driving take note - the hill is quite steep, but you can usually park directly opposite the house so you shouldn't have to walk far. At least two different bus routes into / out of Downton Seattle run from about 150m away and the neighbourhood is fun, friendly and full of places to go (so many restaurants and bars). No TV is a bonus - get out and explore or just sit back and read a book in the sunshine. We'd definitely come back!"
2693700,32458436,2015-05-18,27626970,Edel,"We had a lovely stay here, Fremont is a lovely area, good if you want away from the hustle and bustle of downtown seattle. Manuela was very helpful and we really appreciated the book of recommendations of things to do and places to eat. Thank you."
2693700,32801707,2015-05-21,27068567,Beth,"Manuela is very welcoming yet shows full respect for her guests privacy.  The apartment is perfectly described as an 'oasis'. It is a quiet, secret little niche just blocks from an otherwise noisy high traffic area, comforting and immaculately clean. The Fremont area is our favorite place to stay in our frequent trips to Seattle and the 'oasis' is our new home away from home...I was in no hurry to leave it."
2693700,33253671,2015-05-26,30533485,Crystal,"The Fremont Urban Oasis was our ""home away from home"" during our five night stay.  Manuela was sure to keep us informed of her availability during our stay, and we were easily able to communicate.  She had a nice binder with printed information to help orient us to the property and the neighborhood.  Manuela even left us a welcoming local brew in the fridge, which was a very sweet gesture.  The property was very neat and clean.  Exactly as pictured on the profile.  I would definitely return."
2693700,33763182,2015-06-01,14605717,Marian,"The host made me feel very welcome...I loved the apartment and felt safe and comfortable.
"
2693700,34122492,2015-06-05,8046470,George,"Manuela's apartment is a beautifully designed space, very light  and airy, with easy access by bus or biking/walking trail to Lake Union, downtown Seattle and Ballard (a nearby neighborhood with many restaurants). It has a small garden, bursting with flowers (in June) and very nice to sit and read in. We will definitely stay here again when we come to Seattle."
2693700,34314335,2015-06-07,25916852,Ricky,"Perfect haven in the quieter area of lower Fremont. Very comfortable and private with plenty of natural light. Well-stocked kitchen and bathroom. Eclectic furniture and book/CD collection. A vase of fresh flowers, milk/yogurt/beer, coffee/tea await our late night arrival. Manuela is very responsive and unfortunately we did not have time to chat in person. We will definitely stay there again so ""bedankt en tot ziens""!  Brunch at Joule and dinner at Pomerol meet our high expectation - take out from the Pie to enjoy our lovely terrace (broccoli cheddar and mac pesto are so good) is heavenly. Visit to Gas Works Park with a scoop of Sasquatch from MollyMoon rounds up our stay."
2693700,34608969,2015-06-09,2073947,Andy,"Manuela was there to greet us even though we got in late from Rainier National Park. The apartment is a very cute bottom floor suite. She was very kind to let us use her washer and dryer to clean up after a long hot day in the woods. 

The apartment is very well appointed, especially the kitchen. It's definitely a tea / coffee lover's paradise! The bathroom in particular is very well organized and has very nice fixtures. The bed is soft and comfy with plenty of blankets and pillows. 

Manuela has a lot of very interesting books, my girlfriend and I couldn't stop browsing and pre-reading. 

Overall a great place to stay! "
2693700,34850430,2015-06-13,784735,Samantha,"Manuela made us feel SO welcome during our stay at her space. She was very open and communicative. She arranged for an easy arrival and her binder of useful maps and tips came in very handy. The space is in a wonderful neighborhood, very walkable and quiet. We rented a car for our visit and had no problems parking on her street. As Manuela and her family live upstairs, we could hear foot traffic, but nothing that disturbed our sleep or relaxation. The kitchen was gorgeous and a pleasure to use. The space was open and filled with light and very comfortable. The private patio/garden makes this place a real gem. We loved our stay and would highly recommend Manuela and her space!"
2693700,35284624,2015-06-17,21389634,Vicki,This was one of our favourite apartments on our most recent trip. It was clean and beautifully decorated and the patio outside was lovely. Manuela was very helpful and accommodating.
2693700,35379889,2015-06-18,7281153,Elizabeth,Manuela has thought of everything. Her place is extremely well stocked and comfortable. It's in a super interesting neighborhood.  I highly recommend it. 
2693700,35537727,2015-06-20,15695517,Travis,We loved our stay in the Fremont Urban Oasis. Manuela was very nice and hospitable. The apartment was spacious and well decorated. Highly recommended!
2693700,36255794,2015-06-27,20458134,Leigh,"We had a wonderful stay at this light, spacious apartment with a fab outdoor space. The apartment is in a great location for both local sight seeing and the rest of Seattle with regular buses to the city very close. The apartment has everything you need and Manuela had left us some lovely local coffee, beer and chocolate as a welcome! 

Manuela is a great host making sure you are comfortable and have everything you need. She respected our privacy but was always available when we needed her. She has thoughtfully put together a binder of local recommendations which we used a lot! We would definitely stay again!"
2693700,36524657,2015-06-29,31355630,Nicole,"We enjoyed our time here. Everything was as described or better and the apartment was spacious and clean. The bed is comfy, there's a deep tub for soaking, and the patio is a great space to sit and relax. 
Manuela was always quick to respond to messages as we planned our trip. 
We stayed here without a car and found it very easy to walk to local restaurants and take the bus downtown. 
We would definitely stay here again and recommend it to friends and family!"
2693700,37035162,2015-07-04,16959699,Helen,"Great location nice and quiet. Well equipped, clean and the courtyard patio was a lovely place to sit and have coffee in the mornings."
2693700,37347896,2015-07-06,35157545,Shaun,"Great location, close to good restaurants "
2693700,37834867,2015-07-11,29007351,Mandi,This location is super close to great restaurants and bars.The studio is a great size for two people. Nicely decorated and comfortable. Manuela made sure she was available to contact in the event needed which we appreciated greatly. 
2693700,38975121,2015-07-20,23156032,Sarah,"Absolutely lovely little apartment, absolutely perfect of our needs. Despite the size it felt really spacious and the unique decor was beautiful. We stayed for 10 days as a base for our trip to Seattle and it was lovely. Fremont has lovely bars and restaurants just a few minutes walk away and I would definitely recommend the Theos chocolate factory tour. The bus is just at the end of the road with about 3 lines going into Seattle every 20 minutes or so. 
Manuela emailed us on our arrival to check that we had found everything and was most welcoming. 
The welcome arrival pack was a nice touch with the Theos chocolate as well. 
"
2693700,40071240,2015-07-28,23955927,Rachel,"The Fremont Urban Oasis was absolutely perfect for our honeymoon in Seattle. This was our first experience with airbnb and all future airbnbs will be compared to this standard. There was a lot of natural light and the decoration was impressive. The kitchen had all of the necessary cooking utensils and was a great space. The big bathtub was a bonus and the water pressure was great. The covered outdoor patio was awesome and got a lot of use. There is no TV which was nice because it forced us to talk to each other and not be lazy while on vacation-- haha! 

The location was amazing. We ended up getting a rental car because we wanted to visit Mount Rainier and the Olympic Peninsula; however, it was not necessary. Just a couple of blocks to the center of Fremont for shops, restaurants, and bars. There is a pizza shop a block away that is open until 3:00am which was great for after a late night. There was never an issue with parking on the street in front of the house. We looked into taking buses into downtown Seattle, but realized that for a few more dollars, we could uber in half the time. The most we paid for an uber was $20 because it was a ""surge"" from downtown to the oasis because of Amazon's anniversary party at one of the stadiums-- every other time we paid between $10 and $15 each way (downtown, Ballard Locks, University area). 

Manuela was on vacation for the first half of our stay, but she put us in contact with her husband who was very helpful-- especially with the laundry. Both of them were very quick to answer our questions. 

As has been mentioned in other reviews, you can definitely hear the family walking around upstairs. I am a light sleeper when not at home, so it did wake me up; however, it made sure we got an early start every day and got the most out of our trip. My husband, on the other hand, slept through it no problem. 

We would absolutely recommend this airbnb to anyone that is looking to spend some time in Seattle. Next time we have the opportunity to visit Seattle, we are definitely hoping the Fremont Urban Oasis is available! 

"
2693700,40226157,2015-07-29,15121499,Kathryn,"I could fill pages with great things about Manuala and her lovely, lovely, wonderful listing. I am overjoyed when I see that her listing is available because I just adore staying here. It's perfect. Beyond comfortable, in a great location, fantastic decor.. the best. I will stay here every time I possibly can! "
2693700,41319435,2015-08-07,20855418,Mary,"This apartment is in a great location, near everything. It is well furnished, and feels cozy and welcoming at the end of your day.

Manuela provided suggestions in a book along with insider tips on great markets, coffee roasters, and cafes. The apartment had everything we needed and more."
2693700,41590923,2015-08-08,8417077,Becca,"Manuela was a terrific host - provided privacy and attentive. The space is in a terrific location, very comfortable, and has fantastic amenities. We would definitely stay again!!"
2693700,41930363,2015-08-10,31520485,Michelle,"Manuela's urban oasis was the perfect place for our stay in Seattle. The Fremont neighborhood has so many fun and interesting attractions, which are all in close in proximity to the house. The house itself is so incredibly cute and cozy. It's a real joy to stay in."
2693700,42399269,2015-08-13,7929212,Frederico,"Fremont Oasis was indeed an oasis in our trip to Seattle. Manuela was incredible attentive, and her tips were great. The location is very special, with easy transportation to Ballard and Downtown. The house is spotless clean and very quiet, making the perfect place to rest after a busy day exploring the city. Hope we'll come back some day!"
2693700,42820265,2015-08-16,29258039,Christie King,We really enjoyed this place (we came for the last Geocaching Block Party) and wish we could have stayed a week. It was clean and cozy and we loved having breakfast outside in the cold air on the garden patio. We kept imagining ourselves living there. We will definitely stay there again when we get the chance to return to Seattle!
2693700,43254995,2015-08-18,9196305,Samantha,"Manuela welcomed us with some local chocolate and beer, as well as some beautiful flowers from the garden. The apartment matched the description in the ad and was close to a strip of restaurants and coffee shops.  The place was perfect for our stay and had everything you would need for a comfortable visit to Seattle. It had ample cooking utensils and appliances, a pleasant outdoor patio, a very  nice kitchen and bathroom, and a super comfy bed - the only thing missing was a full-length mirror. We will definitely try to stay there on our next visit to the area."
2693700,43893510,2015-08-23,16823567,Richard,"Manuela left flowers & chocolate, together with some food essentials in the fridge.  The beers were particularly welcome after a long flight!  The apartment was very clean and had everything you could need.  It was absolutely as described in the listing.  A bonus was that the downtown bus route was only a few hundred yards away and at $2-3 a trip was brilliant, saving much on taxi fares.  Freemont was a great place to walk to & Ballard also really good. We'd stay with Manuela again."
2693700,44414270,2015-08-26,34001033,Sierra,"Top notch! Manuela was such a wonderful host.  She was very accommodating with allowing my husband and I do our laundry and gave us many suggestions for making the most of the area.  The apartment is impeccable.  The decorations and furniture make the place feel like home, and Manuela has stocked the kitchen with all the necessities and more!  Seattle was the last stop on a two week long west coast road trip, so we were wanting to spend our time relaxing and staying in.  The house is also close to the center of Fremont and Ballard, and is near a great biking and walking trail.  As described in the rental description, you can hear the family moving around upstairs.  We are early risers, so this was not a big deal at all."
2693700,45223178,2015-08-31,15121499,Kathryn,"Awesome, as always! This is the perfect spot and Manuela is just a fabulous host!"
2693700,45405979,2015-09-02,5402953,Alexis,"Great stay in Fremont with Manuela in her basement apartment.  We greatly enjoyed the neighborhood and Manuela made us feel welcome with local treats and an extremely clean and well decorated spot!  Just a walk to a nearby brewery and many restaurants in Fremont.  Manuela's guidebook was great in directing us to her favorite spots as well!

Only negative was there is some residual noise from upstairs since this is a basement apartment.  Didn't bother us since we are early risers but may be of concern for light sleepers or those looking for full peace and quiet!  "
2693700,45852879,2015-09-06,42124456,Nicole,"We never met our host, but she made us feel very welcome. Her home was warm and inviting and had all the comforts of home! We enjoyed our stay very much and fell in love with the Fremont district! "
2693700,46119553,2015-09-08,17131313,Erica,"Manuela was a great host, and the space was awesome! She was available upon our arrival and for questions - but not intrusive. The apartment is tastefully decorated, clean, and well-lit. The multitude of windows make it bright and warm. This apartment is perfect for two people. There are plenty of restaurants and things to do in the area. My husband and I walked pretty much everywhere we went. Manuela has a book of recommendations at the apartment that was definitely of use to us. We would definitely stay at this apartment if we are in the area again. My husband says, ""I give it 6 out of 5 stars."" "
2693700,46398830,2015-09-10,15121499,Kathryn,This must be the 6th time I have stayed at Manuala's home. I will book every time it is available and she will have me. It is just the best!!!
2693700,47193102,2015-09-16,15121499,Kathryn,Manuela is the best! The Urba Oasis is super comfy and charming. I'm a regular. Particularly appreciate the delicious local beverage awaiting my arrival in the fridge. Location is awesome. All and all this is just a great place to stay!
2693700,48061608,2015-09-23,28969100,Christian,"Wir haben uns bei Manuel von Anfang an sehr wohl gefühlt. Das Appartment wirkte von Anfang an sehr gemütlich und persönlich. Schön war auch, dass Vorräte wie z.B. Gewürze etc. vorhanden waren. Wenn wir uns mal eine kleine Mahlzeit zubereiten wollten, mussten wir nur das besorgen,was wir tatsächlich auch essen wollten.

Die Wohnung liegt sehr verkehrsgünstig, alles hat gepasst.
"
2693700,48248164,2015-09-24,667728,Juston,"Manuela's place is cute, comfortable, and well appointed.  It's an airy studio on the ground floor of their house with a separate entrance, its own key, and a separate patio.  I had a great and comfortable stay and would definitely return. "
2693700,48860052,2015-09-29,13650869,Jessica,"Manuela was great to communicate with. She was very welcoming when I arrived and showed me around to helpfully explain everything. This is a great place to stay if you want to visit the suburbia of Seattle. Loved the proximity to Ballard, Green Lake and the University district. "
2693700,49113326,2015-10-01,7801981,Mary,"This is a wonderful place to stay.  It is really spacious and beautifully decorated. We took the light rail from the airport and then a bus to Manuela's home.  Once we got the hang of it public transit was a snap.   There are a great number of places to eat and shop within walking distance or a short Uber ride.  We had wonderful smoked BBQ at a place called Drunkey's BBQ, just down the street, and fresh fish at Rock Creek Seafood and Spirits about a mile away. Although I only took a shower the tub is to die for. Enjoy!"
2693700,49466140,2015-10-04,42550610,Steven,"The place was nicer and cozier than expected from the listing. Host made it very easy for us when we arrived and it felt very welcoming with all the extras provided: Some items in the fridge, coffee, seasonings, honey, etc. Also very welcoming to my son when they shared some Legos and books for him to play with while we were there.
Was a wonderful experience and I will definitely stay here again when I return to Seattle. Highly recommended in every regard. Location was great, very close to walk to all the fun that is Fremont and right next to a bus stop that gets you to the heart of downtown. Only negative I could think to list would be the noise from upstairs. If you're not used to people living above you it's enough to notice, but certainly not unreasonable. I've stayed at other B&Bs and airbnbs in Seattle; so far I think this is my favorite!
Thanks for the excellent stay!"
2693700,49899048,2015-10-07,21773868,Jim,The urban oasis was very nice.  Lots of very nice touches.  Would stay there again whenever we wanted to be in Fremont.
2693700,50042407,2015-10-08,15245003,Sunshine,"Manuela's place was a great place for us to stay the night. It was very tidy, cute, and peaceful and it seemed as if a lot of thought and personal touches had gone into the space. It was nice having no TV in the place as a distraction. The studio is very conveniently located to a bunch of great stuff in the Fremont neighborhood. We walked and explored and found some great options for food and drinks. We had very little interaction with Manuela, but we did meet her briefly, she was really nice and sweet."
2693700,50926480,2015-10-16,5091458,Lesley,"We loved Manuela's place! It was nicely appointed with a fantastic bed, big bathroom and everything you need in a kitchen.  We were surprised at how quiet it was given its proximity to the main street of Fremont.  Parking also was never a problem.  Manuela was easy to communicate with. We highly recommend her place!"
2693700,51901094,2015-10-25,42227442,Nancy,"We loved our visit. The space was very cute and comfy. There were fresh flowers, cold drinks and delicious coffee when we arrived. I really enjoyed the extra big bathtub. The location was great. Walking distance to downtown Fremont and also Ballard if you're up for a little longer trek. Also buses at the corner. Manuela wa a lovely hostess. Great place!"
2693700,52615095,2015-10-31,1655441,Tateum,"Manuela has a lovely apartment with lots of privacy. It's walking distance to lots of good places to eat and drink. If we didn't walk, we used uber for transportation, which was so easy! We loved our stay. Thanks, Manuela! "
2693700,52751634,2015-11-01,10016746,Lauren,"We had a wonderful time staying in Manuela's urban oasis. Upon arrival, she warmly greeted us and gave a quick tour and let us get settled in. She gave us our privacy.

The space has amazing character. We spent hours pouring through the bookshelf and listening to the Johnny Cash CD we found on the side table. 

Coming in on a Saturday and being below the main house, we did hear some foot traffic, but nothing that was overly distracting. Kind of made the place feel normal and homely. 

Overall, this space is perfect for 2-3 people that want to be close to town but slightly outside of the hustle and bustle. Highly recommend. "
2693700,53495085,2015-11-09,39981500,Morgan,"Manuela was very timely in contacting me regarding check-in. She also personally welcomed us, and checked in to make sure that we had everything we needed. The accomodations were clean, comfortable and well stocked. "
2693700,54477269,2015-11-20,15121499,Kathryn,Manuela is the best!! I will stay here every chance I get!
2693700,57866686,2015-12-30,41479802,Rachel,Manuela was very kind and in touch just the right amount. She made the studio feel so homey and it was a true home away from home experience. She left us a welcome chocolate. Her books were a joy to explore. The kitchen was perfect for cooking in one night and the location was perfect for exploring. Thank you. 
2693700,58185054,2016-01-01,1384887,Emily,"The urban oasis was the perfect landing pad for our  adventure in Seattle and beyond. Although there are a few busy streets nearby and we weren't sure how quiet the house would be, my fears were gone as soon as we stepped into the apartment. It was beautifully clean, simple, and quiet. I loved the care and artfulness of the space. It was just personal enough to to feel cozy without feeling like we were invading someone's home. We appreciated the coffee, tea, and chocolate that Manuela left- just right for coming down from travel abc launching off to the next adventure. The neighborhood seemed great, though there wasn't time for us to explore Frenont. "
6315269,33710537,2015-05-31,17742325,Cindy,"This is a terrific place to stay if you have a conference in the Convention Center.  It's right around the corner, 3 minute walk away.  The apartment is super clean and cozy, and I felt right at home after a long day trip.  This is so much better than a hotel!  Also very close to attractions such as Pike Place Market.  Super comfortable place with very professional host. Thanks so much for offering this apartment to rent short-term.  I will definitely return if I come to visit Seattle again."
6315269,34791340,2015-06-12,32709130,Amy,"Our first Airbnb and Seattle visit was wonderful. Bruce met us and welcomed us warmly to our home away from home. The condo was spacious, thoughtfully appointed and very close to many tourist attractions. If you turned left on Pike Road, the Convention Center was a few blocks away and Pikes Place was a little further down the road. Turn right and you were a few blocks away from the Starbucks Tasting Room and Melrose Market( filled with wonderful sandwich, cheese, wine and flower shops and a butcher. Nordstrom, Macy's and the Monorail were also within walking distance. We had a fabulous family adventure in Seattle and highly recommend this condo to anyone looking for a true city experience."
4126284,19917736,2014-09-20,7830756,Grant,"Natalie was a welcoming and entertaining hostest with a cozy, colorful and clean home. She accommodated us on relatively short notice and helped with the booking. Her doggy was also a sweetheart. I would stay again! :)"
4126284,20310673,2014-09-27,20863217,Kate,"Natalie is a warm and welcoming host! We didn't see much of each other because we are on opposite schedules, but I got the feeling I could ask her for something if I had needed it. I was able to come and go as I pleased, which was really convenient. Her condo is very clean and spacious. Her dog is super sweet! I would stay with Natalie again in a heartbeat. "
4126284,20535788,2014-09-30,1404473,James,"Natalie was an excellent host. I highly recommend her. She was very welcoming, helpful and relaxed. The bedroom was clean and bright and the futon was comfortable. Her dog is very friendly and super cute. There is a train station only a short walk from her house which goes downtown.

We would stay here again and wish Natalie all the best."
4126284,20791914,2014-10-05,10410344,Maria Bang,"The house was great and the host was kind. Everything was perfect.
It was a little bit of a walk to the train with a lot of luggage, but besides that it was in a nice location close to the city centre."
4126284,22112155,2014-10-30,21780674,Jason,"As someone who lived in the Seattle for a little over a year, I visited this area once in the summer before booking on Airbnb. It's an interesting area which is going through a period of  regeneration.

I stayed with Natalie and James for 3 weeks and spent most of my time at their place during the day and was out in the evenings when they entertained. Both enjoy cooking and entertaining and though their house is a good size, you'll know when others are home. The bedroom is located on the 3rd floor across the hall from the master bedroom. There is street parking which is readily available.

One thing to be aware of is that this location is 10-15 minutes to downtown Seattle and having a car is definitely a must if you want to get anywhere quickly. I would definitely recommend Natalie's place. Their dog loves attention and both Natalie and James are friendly hosts. "
4126284,22247038,2014-11-02,11646883,Julien,"The unit of Natalie fits perfectly with what we expected when we arrived in Seattle. Her house is very well located, clean and spacious. Great place, we really recommend! "
4126284,50403373,2015-10-11,13299030,Ru,"The house is lovely and good location. Shampoo and body wash are provided in the bathroom. Very clean room. The host is very busy, we didn't get to see her. She changed her plans of going back home at our last night without informing us. And no replies of message. The room we stayed is small but spacious(there r 2 airbnb rooms in floor 3) without curtain that covers the sunshine(just some pieces of gauze). "
9215782,55484818,2015-12-01,6866673,Bob,"My partner and I had a great experience staying here. Ali greeted us with a nice note and bottle of wine.  The place was exactly as shown in the pics 

Apt is centrally located and easy to get to downtown.  We were able to walk downtown to do our site seeing    There are some great bars, pubs and restaurants in the neighborhood as well

Only negative would be parking in the neighborhood can be tough.  Though we were always able to find a spot and public transportation is right around the corner "
9215782,56359963,2015-12-12,35100366,Roberto,The host canceled this reservation 27 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
1407502,14125924,2014-06-12,6903424,Janna,"My stay at Nicole's surpassed all my expectations. Her home is beautiful, super comfortable, and conveniently located in a very safe, fun neighborhood. The guest space comes with an open outdoor patio with a garden. She provides very nice bedding and a Keurig coffeemaker in the guest room with organic coffee (or alternatives if you prefer tea, decaf or hot chocolate). Nicole herself is great: funny, kind, down to earth, and extremely helpful. Nicole was good at commuting before and during the trip. She made me feel welcome and helped me to find great places to go around Seattle. She's a chef and is well connected to the ""foodie"" scene, so has a lot to say if you're interested in finding great spots to eat -- everything from food trucks to french bakeries. This was the perfect traveling experience for me. I highly recommend Nicole's place to anyone!"
1407502,15142567,2014-07-03,5118198,Eric,"My experience with Nicole was excellent because although she is super busy working in her home she displayed a real sense of calm.  I think what makes her unique is that she's worked with many many people in a multitude of situations.
We did get to have a few moments to talk about some shared interests which  given both our schedules was nice. The neighborhood is a quiet residential one so getting a quiet night of sleep is easy.  Nicole does have a small dog, Louis who is an ambassador  par excellence.  He makes anyone feel welcomed and accepted into the household.  "
1407502,16259441,2014-07-24,15607490,Janet,"My experience with Nicole was excellent.  The room is private with a private bathroom and is on a beautiful patio.  I understand that future guests will have an even nicer arrangement since Nicole is planning to renovate the bathroom.  The property itself is situated on a super pleasant and quiet street within walking distance of shops and restaurants.  Nicole herself is a highly accomplished and experienced person who is very friendly, easy to talk to and extremely forthcoming with advice on where to eat and what to do in Seattle.  She'll even advise you on other stuff like real estate and how the area compares to other places.  I hope to go back soon!"
1407502,18269122,2014-08-24,19332149,Sabrina,"Nicole was a gracious host. She had put a bottle of sparkling water in the little kitchenette fridge as well as a bar of chocolate and some fruit in the room.  The room and bathroom were private, clean, and comfortable.  The patio was a nice place to relax after a busy day.  Nicole has a very sweet dog who will come and visit you if you let him.  I found the neighborhood to be pleasant and safe.  For those using public transport there is a bus stop about two blocks away where you can catch a bus to downtown.  Overall, I had a very positive experience."
1407502,18723906,2014-08-31,17943587,Sharon,"I had a GREAT stay. My room was REALLY nice. I enjoyed my visits with Nicole and Louie. Will do it again next year. 
Thank you for helping to make my stay a GREAT ONE. Sharon"
1407502,19273700,2014-09-09,19135296,Audrey,"This 6 night visit was my first experience with this sort of accommodation - AirBnb or any other - and I learned a few things: photos don't necessarily represent a part of the house that is available to the visitor; prior to booking ask more questions about amenities; book a room that has its own heat controls and thermostat; try to find out the details of the accommodations before booking.  I say this because though I was provided with a ceramic bowl, I was disappointed that the utensils and the 4"" plates were plastic. I had to ask for a mug which was promptly delivered with a glass as well.  I provided my own flatware.  The food area was dusty but the bedroom and bath felt clean.

Nicole was easy to communicate with by email during the online booking and in answering a few questions prior to my arrival.  I was out of the townhouse from about 9-9 every day.  Other than the initial brief introduction our paths did not cross.  I had a problem with the heat coming on too often during the first night.  I texted Nicole about it but she didn't respond for 3 days.  Perhaps I should have telephoned though it wasn't as bad after the first night.  The room is on the bottom of 3 floors of a townhouse and is next to the garage.  The heat all goes up of course.  If I kept the bedroom door (which opens to the hallway) closed the room was comfortable.  The hallway has the microwave and the apartment refrigerator, the front door, the stairs that lead up, and the door to the garage.  It was always very chilly.  The room is small but the twin bed was very comfortable.  The attached private bath was very nice.  I didn't spend time in the patio area.  Street parking after 9 pm almost filled up.  It's a nicely quiet location for sleeping.  "
1407502,19698617,2014-09-16,20741664,Judy,"This was my first experience with Airbnb so I was a bit apprehensive. But my stay at Nicole's was great. Even though it was late when I arrived Nicole was there to greet me. The space is perfect for one person with a bedroom, bath and a patio out the back. Everything was neat and clean with no surprises!  The neighborhood is safe and  quiet. It was a convenient place for me as my daughter lives in Ballard. Much easier than being downtown.  I will certainly stay at Nicole's during my next visit to Seattle! Thanks, Nicole!"
1407502,20723549,2014-10-04,13008308,Travis,"I had a great time staying in Nicole's downstairs bedroom. It was very private and a small desk allowed me to work and make phone calls. The house is a quick walk to a couple of neighborhood bars and a brunch place with great crepes. An extended walk would get you to downtown Ballard with a much wider selection of dining and amusement venues. 
Oh, the microwave, fridge and coffeemaker were great to have on hand!"
1407502,23490533,2014-12-02,17943587,Sharon,My stay was wonderful. My room was nice and warm. Love the visits from Louie every morning and when I got home. Nicki is a wonderful hostess. 
1145941,5346454,2013-06-25,2785093,Stacy,"We had a nice stay at Terry's house in Seattle.  The living room is spacious and the dining room feels cozy, while overlooking the patio.  Due to the weather, we weren't able to enjoy the patio, but that's usual for Seattle.  We used th ample counter space in the kitchen to prepare for my grandson's birthday party.  The bedroom are upstairs, and there are a few stairs to get to the front door.  The bedrooms were cozy and we couldn't hear the traffic on the main road.  Thanks for letting us stay there!"
1145941,5459909,2013-07-01,6572153,Jawed,"We had wonderful time. Location was very convenient. Check in and check out was smooth. No problems at all. Loved Seattle. It was my first time using Airbnb.  It felt like walking into a friends home and being given their bedrooms for the few days. The house was located close to public transportation and farmers market, and the bedrooms and bathrooms were clean and comfy. I would definitely recommend!
If  they had few fans for the summer it would be cherry in the top"
1145941,5659767,2013-07-10,6572921,Lynda,"We stayed at Terry's Seattle home for a week in July 2013. The home was clean and very comfortable.We really felt like we were home.   Eggs, bread, condiments, milk, juice, fruit  coffe and tea were left for our use..The home has charm and the view from all windows of trees and foliage makes you forget you are in the city. This was our first time using airbnb and Terry was very patient and understanding with us. We were so busy enjoying ourselves and our daughter's wedding that we completely lost track of time, overstayed our agreed upon stay and missed our flight. It turned out to be a blessing. Terry was very gracious and allowed us to stay at a discount and we had more time to visit with our daughter!
Steve was our local contact person and he was also very helpful and kind. He provided us with an iron, ironing board and hairdryer. THe location was perfect for us and close to Greenlake. We would not hesitate to stay again.
Thank you Terry and Steve,
The Ivans "
1145941,5811646,2013-07-17,6948706,Aura M,"This house was awesome for our group. Bus stop was close by. The markets were close by. The house was very comfy and welcoming. It felt like we were at home. Terry was awesome in answering any questions I had. I would definitely recommend this place to stay  and hopefully I'll be able to stay there again. Thank you so much again Terry! 
"
1145941,5888592,2013-07-21,6887578,Necia,"We had a nice stay at the Tudor house in Ne Seattle.  It was clean and bright, convenient to the downtown express bus, and was a very pleasant home away from home for our Seattle visit."
1145941,6049273,2013-07-28,6796029,Ying,"Our stay here is wonderful. Terry is very warm and welcoming. Very fast on response to any questions. Instructions are detailed and precise. 
The house is clean and spacious, well stocked kitchen with fresh fruit, juice, egg, bread and milk. The location is very convenient to markets and surprising not very noisy considering it is right on 15th st. We had a very pleasant stay here. Would recommend for any family to stay here."
1145941,6555375,2013-08-17,6444489,Michelle,"The house is charming and in a convenient location.  Terry was available for questions and we had no issues.  When we arrived there was food in the fridge and plenty of fluffy towels.  Overall, a good experience."
1145941,6786208,2013-08-25,6755943,Neal,"House was very spacious, more so than we expected.  Everything was comfortable and clean.  There was food in the fridge when we arrived so we didn't need to run out buy something the first night.   It was a good experience and we would stay here again."
1145941,7431557,2013-09-20,231034,Natalie,"Great house and host in Seattle. We were in town for a business trip and it took about 10 minutes to get downtown, which was really convenient. It was also a short drive to the University of Washington. One downside was we didn't realize there wasn't a TV in the house (it's stated in the listing but I missed that)."
1145941,7776170,2013-10-02,8609816,Connie,"This house was wonderful and in a great location for us if you want to be in the Green Lake, Roosevelt, Ravenna area! The beds were so comfortable, luxurious towels in the bathroom, and plenty of extra things in the bathroom if you forgot something.
The kitchen was well stocked with everything for whatever you want to cook, and also juice, coffee and tea. 
It was cold and rainy while we were in Seattle and the house was nice and cozy! Terry was great and responded right away to our questions! We would definitely stay there again. Thanks, Terry!"
1145941,8040640,2013-10-14,7839404,Blake,"Terry's house was perfect!  Very spacious and clean with a nice decor.  The kitchen was a great place to cook in with all the necessities.  Overall great experience!  Thanks, Blake."
1145941,8145274,2013-10-17,4789620,Pallavi,"Gorgeous place, and Terry was soooooo thoughtful to have bread, fruit, milk, juice and more already stocked in the fridge (especially since we arrived really late)!  The apartment had a lot of character. Location was great. Perfect for business travel -- just 15-20 minutes to Bellevue, Redmond and moments to downtown. "
1145941,8410243,2013-10-29,9074083,Antoine,"A beautiful house, similar to the description on the website. Everything was fine, except a little electric problem in the kitchen. However, the owner reacted really fast and proposed several solutions. I recommand this place if you want to stay in a convenient but quiet neighborhood in Seattle."
1145941,8899197,2013-11-25,9084506,Scott,"As an Airbnb first-timer, I'm really happy that we had such a great experience staying at Terry's house. Terry was a wonderful host and made extra effort to accommodate us, and the house has such character in a very central area of Seattle. It was great being able to walk to the Whole Foods, and it's also walkable to the University District where there are a ton of great restaurants.

Terry's home was our home while we were in Seattle, and it was sad to leave!"
1145941,9286600,2013-12-18,10081680,Mohamed,"I stayed for 10 days at Terry's lovely house when my family came to visited me in Seattle and I enthusiastically encourage whoever is reading this review to stay in that house for a memorable experience. First, the owner is a wonderful and nice person who responds to your enquiries very quickly (very easy to reach and very helpful, however I didn't face any problems while we were here). Second, the house looks exactly like the pictures or even better. You will not find any unpleasant surprises. It's very clean, organized and really full equipped (the kitchen is perfect with a microwave, big fridge,toaster, dish washer, a lot of cooking pots, plates, glasses, food, and spices). If you live in Seattle so you probably know how good the location is, if not so it is a quiet place to stay yet it is in the heart of everything.The U district is in a walking distance (10 minutes), and green lake (about the same distance to U district), Northgate mall is just 10 minutes by bus. 4 blocks to the south there is whole foods that is open 24 hours and 6 blocks to the north there is Safeway which is also open 24 hours. If you don't have a car, you will find a bus stop just 3 blocks to the south (15th avenue with 65th street with many routes serving u district, downtown Seattle, and capitol hill). 
"
1145941,9440243,2013-12-29,9153032,Stephen,"Overall, a nice if slightly worn and funky place.
Perhaps a bit spartan in utensils, cookware, furnishings and lighting (as compared to a home that is lived in full time). The access to a washer and dryer was very helpful. The wood provided for the fireplace was a nice touch and made the first floor warm and cozy. 
Our host also provided a small, lit and decorated Christmas tree for the season which made that week very special. 

Things for guests to be aware of:
-the oven runs hot, perhaps as much as 50 to 100 degrees (burned our cake), so take an oven thermometer and test before using
- the master bedroom door doesn't have a latch, so it can't be closed effectively
- of the two DVD players , neither we're hooked up to the TV and one doesn't work at all, but resolvable if you are handy
- look under the modem for the correct network name and password
- the front door rattles if it is windy (and there is no weatherstripping), so use a match book in the door jamb to stop the rattles
- there weren't enough sheets for all the beds - or we just couldn't find them late the night when our other family members arrived - so if you will need all the beds, be sure to ask during the day before they arrive and make the beds up prior to the knock on the door

-Regards, Peggy and Steve"
1145941,9835727,2014-01-13,1641998,Liza,"Terry was extremely responsive to all our needs despite her absence. Our favorite amenity in the house was the fireplace which we used every day. The house is spacious and is well reflected by the pics you see. I would have appreciated the beds to be slightly more comfortable but that's not something you can ever guarantee when you are reserving a house on airbnb or a hotel room anywhere. The house was well located for easy access to I5 and a quick trip almost anywhere. The wifi happened to not be working great during our visit but Terry assured us that wasn't the norm for her previous visitors. Enjoy your stay.
"
1145941,9916667,2014-01-19,10917151,Bryan,"Terry's place was awesome! Conveniently located in the Roosevelt Neighborhood of Seattle, it was conveniently close to the University of Washington, The Aurora Bridge and the Fremont Troll. Terry was also supercool. She was quick to answer any questions, and infinitely patient with me being a first timer."
1145941,10025778,2014-01-26,11279090,Andrew,"Very cozy and homey charm! Great location, just minutes to downtown. Charming neighborhood."
1145941,10131916,2014-02-02,10200460,David,"We came as a family of 4 with two kids 4 & 7 for a full week.  This place lived up to all expectations.  Bedrooms were comfortable, the house was perfectly situated to get down to the University, and easy to get on Interstate 5.  Terry was always very responsive to emails, and text messages.  We would highly recommend this place for any length of stay in Seattle.    "
1145941,10654226,2014-03-02,1786903,Emily,House was in a great location and comfortable. Terry was wonderful to work with. Would love to stay again!
1145941,10958640,2014-03-15,11844731,Lynn,"We enjoyed our time at Terry's home, it was not without a few glitches of concern, but Terry was willing to correct the situations in a  timely fashion even though she was in Michigan. 
The flowers and flowering trees were lovely being from snowy WI spring in Seattle was reassuring that we would soon have spring in WI as well. . 
The kitchen and dining room were used extensively for gathering friends and family for celebrations of my mom's 80th Birthday, we made many new and memorable memories at the humble abode of Terry.  We would re-book at Terry's home in the future without a second guess. Thanks Terry ! Lynn "
1145941,11080251,2014-03-19,12674104,Leah,Terry is an amazing host!! The house is great with a very relaxing atmosphere. Great location! Minutes from downtown areas! Definitely recommend this over any hotel! Had a wonderful time in Seattle and can't wait to stay here again! Thanks!!!
1145941,11382241,2014-03-31,13499976,Jason,"My friends and I had a great stay at ""Home Away from Home."" We were a group of 5, and we stayed for three nights. Terry was very helpful and accommodating, and the house is even more comfortable and homey than it appears in its photos. One of the best features is the wood-burning fireplace; another is the excellent kitchen; and yet another is the super comfortable sofa and chairs. If there is a drawback it's the small size of the dining table, but that seems a minor inconvenience compared to all the awesomeness the house and its owner have to offer. "
1145941,12331763,2014-04-29,11967394,Rosie,"We stayed at Terry's place for 10 days with a group of 5/6 people. The house is perfectly located: a number of great and diverse restaurants are around the corner. Super easy access to bus routes which goes actually right downtown. The house is cosy and comfortable and features everything one need. Terry is very responsive on text message, and all went very smooth. Thank you! 
"
1145941,12570678,2014-05-05,14207235,Kathryn,"Terry's house was a perfect place for my group to stay, and everyone was thrilled with the space. We had six people, and there was plenty of room (nice to have two bathrooms!); the twin beds are a tall twin with a roll-out trundle bed underneath. (We had to bring a desk chair from upstairs to use at the dining room table, though.) It was great to be able to cook at home, and it's really a beautiful house and nicely furnished. The location is excellent, a Whole Foods within walking distance. Our big van didn't quite fit in the small driveway, but there is parking on the street. Everything was clean, fresh sheets and towels, etc. I did wish that there had been some sort of booklet listing instructions/ amenities (we weren't sure if the fireplace flue was open, for instance, or whether there was a hairdryer in the house-- turns out there wasn't; it might have been nice to have more info about nearby restaurants and shopping, etc). Also, although Terry always responded to emails and texts, sometimes it took a rather long time. But overall an excellent experience and I would certainly contact Terry to stay again! Terry, thanks for everything :) "
1145941,12787810,2014-05-11,13896533,Selena,"The stay at ""home away from home"" is fantastic. The house is even prettier in reality than in pictures. I would stay there again during our next visit. "
1145941,12978713,2014-05-16,13679912,Jessica,"My sister and I stayed at Terry’s house while visiting the area.   We chose this property because we wanted to be located in this area of Seattle.
First the positives- the house was clean and spacious. We didn’t cook, but the kitchen appeared well stocked with pots, dishes, small appliances, etc. There were also basic condiments in the fridge and cabinets.  The bathrooms were updated and well stocked with towels.  The beds were firm and comfortable.
Now for not so positives: The house is on the corner of a very busy street and all the bedrooms are exposed to that noise.  If we had been aware of this (I was surprised this was not mentioned in the reviews) we would not have stayed here.   The weather was warm during our visit so we did have the windows open. 
I would not recommend this property to someone who is a light sleeper. We would not stay there again because of the traffic noise.
"
1145941,13237138,2014-05-23,11770578,Robert,"""Home away from home"" was truly a great spot! The spacious pictures of the house matched what was there, and the flowers and  landscaping were spectacular. The four of us were in Seattle to attend a conference, and the house was a perfect place to return to after a busy day. Using the bus to go downtown worked well, and the heart of the neighborhood was only a few blocks away and an easy walk. Don't miss the bookstore/Greek Cafe on 20th & 65th. 
Terry was very accessible, and helpful in suggesting places to visit in the area. We all highly recommend her place."
1145941,13356552,2014-05-26,5925650,Kelvin,"My stay with Terry was excellent! I stayed in Seattle during the late spring, early summer. Nice and cool at night and nice bright blue skies during the day. 
Pros:
Comfy beds
Quiet neighborhood
walkable restaurants nearby (highly suggest rainy city burgers)
LYFT/ UBER cars are nearby for pick up
Only takes about 20 mins to get to Pike's Place

Cons:
The neighbor next door has a rooster that can wake people up."
1145941,13542090,2014-05-30,995581,Anna,"Cute place, very cozy. Perfect for our team of three in town for a meeting. "
1145941,13671790,2014-06-02,14225441,Renee,"We really liked staying at Terry's house! It was perfect for my family! The location is great! So easy to get everywhere and it's a great family friendly neighborhood. My kids even found a tetherball out on a side walk a couple of blocks up that they had fun with.

We had a slight family emergency and my sister, who was also visiting Seattle, had to stay with us, as well. Terry was very accommodating, she dropped off extra sheets and towels. We ended up with 6 people and it was perfect! Will definitely be staying again next time we're in Seattle!"
1145941,14022023,2014-06-10,14019574,Julie,Terry was very accommodating and great to work with. We really enjoyed the house and it was easy to walk to shops in the neighborhood. 
1145941,14335736,2014-06-17,8167259,Carolyn,"We had a lovely stay at Terry's ""Home away from home"" in Seattle.  Very comfortable and clean-as-a-whistle! A wonderful find!
"
1145941,14679288,2014-06-24,12729250,Abraham,Terry's place was very convenient for us and we enjoyed the stay there.
1145941,15443798,2014-07-09,2723586,Leah,"Terry's house was spacious for our family of six traveling to Seattle. My kids especially appreciated having a bed of their own versus another hotel sofa bed. There were three buses (71, 72, and 73) that went into downtown Seattle and the Westlake transit center, which was convenient for Pike Place Market or Link transit to Seatac airport. The neighborhood is developing and there is a great restaurant, Pies and Pints, only a few blocks away as well as Whole Foods Market. Overall, it was nice to relax and escape the hussle of the tourist area. "
1145941,15586323,2014-07-12,8156331,Kaoru,"Terry's house is in the residential area and close enough to downtown. We had enough beddings for 5 members of our family. It was very nice to have a large space to move around in the house. Thanks, Terry!"
1145941,16072779,2014-07-22,5152867,Donna,Terry has a lovely home in a great location.  Thoroughly enjoyed our stay.  Location is ideal for sightseeing around city. There is a bit of road noise if you're a light sleeper however. Terry had kitchen stocked for breakfasts which is a nice touch. I would strongly recommend this home!
1145941,16319544,2014-07-25,17982271,Andy,"Terry was a great host!  Would definately stay here again.  Very close to pretty much everything you could want to do.  Took about 15 minutes to get downtown by car.  Very close to bus stops that will take you straight into downtown, which we used most of the time.  There is a Safeway within walking distance, and we ate at Mojitos, a cute little latin food place that was absolutely amazing.  The house was very cute.  Driveway will be hard to park in if you have anything bigger than a mid-sized sedan, our honda accord barely fit, but there appeard to be a lot of on-street parking.  House was very comfortable and welcoming.  The dishwasher was broken when we were there, but overall was not a huge deal."
1145941,16542800,2014-07-29,13648113,Anita,"This property worked out perfectly for our relatives, who were in town for a wedding. The location was convenient to our University of Washington wedding venue, as well as to other Seattle landmarks. I would recommend this place, but they DO need to fix the dishwasher. "
1145941,16686123,2014-07-31,9061573,Fari,"We were absolutely delighted with Terry's home. Over the years, I've stayed at many vacation rentals in several countries and regions and this was by far, my best experience. The house has a very homey, cozy feel, every detail is well thought out, bedrooms are the right size and beds very comfy; and I cannot brag enough about how well the kitchen is stocked, both with equipment/utensils, and with condiments and all necessities to prepare what your heart desires. 
The location is very convenient. I would absolutely recommend this place to anyone considering a stay in the Seattle area. Just a lovely place."
1145941,16891640,2014-08-04,7184298,Mary,"Terry made getting to her place and getting access, really easy. We arrived into Seattle early  and we were allowed to get into the house, as  previous guests left the day before. It was really useful and we were very grateful. 
We really loved the house and it's being restored really well, especially the kitchen which was well equipped and Terry left some welcome bits for us to eat, which was really kind.  The house was in a great position to get around and on a really good set of bus routes, covering all the downtown and University district.
Overall, the main problem, it was a bit of a squeeze for six adults, the third bedroom was a bit small, it's really for smaller kids. Also with only the one bathroom, you need patience.
 However, all  that aside it's a great house in an area in transition, meaning it's being renovated in parts, but do not be put off, its safe, interesting and well linked via public transit, if you need it. 
"
1145941,17333983,2014-08-11,13484359,Amy,"Many people have had positive experiences renting from Terry- and most likely that would be because nothing went wrong with her house. When something does go wrong with her house, the experience turns awful. I have never had such an awful host- whose lack of communication was shameful. She has not replied to any of my emails in the last week to try to remedy the situation we were put in. I would never rent from her again nor recommend that anybody does. I was trying to give her the benefit of the doubt to right her mistakes before I wrote a review of her house, but she never replied to me even just to apologize. Very Lame. My family rented her house August 3rd thru August 10th on their vacation to attend my wedding in Seattle, Wa. They came out a week in advance to visit with me and help me with all the things that needed to be done (including food prep for the wedding). We rented Terry's house because it stated that it would have a nice newly remodeled kitchen to cook food in, with a working dishwasher,working sink, etc. My family is a family of cooks, and the main reason for renting the house was to cook together as a family and avoid eating out and to help with wedding food prep. We have happily stayed in many rented homes, and understood that normal issues can arise, but have never had such a frustrating experience. We were told by her cleaning person upon arrival that the dishwasher was 'broken' and not to use it, and to not open the dishwasher door. This was an upsetting welcome, but wanted to give Terry the benefit of the doubt that she would resolve the issue in a timely manner. So on our first night there, we started washing the dishes by hand, which is when we discovered that the kitchen sink was leaking. We were assured by Terry that she was on top of things, and going to have the sink and dishwasher repaired by midweek. Somebody came out halfway through our stay to look that the sink, which he fixed, but the dishwasher was never fixed. Terry does not even provide a drying rack to dry hand washed dishes. So as the dishwasher sat there filled with last weeks washings and fluids in 80 degree heat, the smell of the rancid bacteria that filled dishwasher was enough to drive my family out of the room. My father writes- "" By mid week the putrid smell coming from the dishwasher was overwhelming in the kitchen, even if you had the window open and were only making coffee. We could not handle the smell any more, and decided to dip out the rancid water and solids. I used vinegar as an antimicrobial and splashed it around inside of the dishwasher, this reduced some of the insanitary condition and the odor for the rest of the week. In thinking about it..."
1145941,18412496,2014-08-26,17720854,Yvonne,"Our stay in Terry's home couldn't have been better!  It was very clean, comfy and well stocked!  The house is very quaint and nicely furnished .  We had beautiful evenings while in Sesttle and enjoyed the patio area.  The bathrooms were very clean and she had plenty of nice towels for all of us.  The kitchen was very nice and we appreciated the treats and staples in the fridge.  It takes a
little while to get into town because if the traffic but we allowed ourselves the time and never had any issues .  We would highly recommend this home and would stay there again!  Thanks Terry!"
1145941,18647830,2014-08-30,14832866,Mark,"Terry was very responsive and is very thoughtful.  Her Home Away from Home is a lovely house that reminds me of the house I grew up in, strategically located just north of the U district, within walking distance of Whole Foods.  It is nicely furnished.  Terry really went the extra mile, such as stocking the fridge with strawberries, eggs, orange juice, etc.  The Internet works very well.  There is a nice patio in the back where we enjoyed having our meals.  We definitely enjoyed our stay.  : )"
1145941,19118946,2014-09-07,10933754,Anna,"My family stayed here for a week while they were in town for my wedding. It was the perfect place! The house was clean and spacious and in the perfect location...easy access to buses, grocery stores, and centrally located to visit all the Seattle has to offer. The backyard patio was our favorite spot to hang out. There was a grill and fire pit and we spent many nights gathered around visiting with each other. The kitchen was stocked with anything we would need to cook a meal, which we did often! She even left a few things for  breakfast in the fridge when they arrived. Terry was very responsive with any questions we had and left plenty of directions in the house on how to use the appliances and such. I would definitely recommend Terry's house to anyone wanting a great deal on an awesome house in Seattle."
1145941,19486642,2014-09-13,20669636,Kelly,"Terry's home was great and fit our needs perfectly.  It was clean (which is a must for me) and had all that we needed to make our stay comfortable.  The space was good and allowed us room to relax.  It was close to public transportation making it easy to get where we wanted to go without having our own vehicle.  The wi fi worked well. 

Terry was a wonderful hostess.  She checked in on us (via a email/text) to make sure everything was to our satisfaction right after we arrived and we later in the week with additional information.  We enjoyed her home and will definitely stay there again on our next visit.  "
1145941,20330152,2014-09-28,15919447,Wendy,"Home away from home is a true description ! The home is so comfy it was hard for us to leave each day. 
Terry was always good about answering my inquires within a reasonable time. 
This was my first time using Airbnb , what a great introduction .
Wendy"
1145941,20664079,2014-10-03,21414920,Linda,"My husband and I enjoyed staying in Terry's Seattle ""Home away from Home"".  The house was clean and comfortable and we felt very much at home there.  We made a few home cooked dinners and found the kitchen to be completely stocked with every tool, utensil and spice we needed.  There was coffee for us to make in the mornings, which we enjoyed...thank you Terry!  

The queen sized bed was comfortable and we did not hear any traffic from the street.

1145941,21336241,2014-10-15,633835,Akiva,"We came out to Seattle for ten days with our family and stayed at Terry's beautiful house.  Her house is not only beautiful, it is well stocked, clean, and very well kept.  It was very spacious, and offered plenty of room for both my wife, son and I and my brother, his wife and baby.  We had extenuating circumstances during our stay and Terry was more than accommodating.  She went above and beyond to make sure the house was clean and safe for our immune-compromised toddler, and made sure we felt like home.  The house is very conveniently located, only a ten minute drive to University Village, and a short drive to downtown Seattle.  The neighborhood boasts some very nice playgrounds nearby.  We are very thankful to our warm host who made our stay in Seattle feel like home!"
1145941,21579196,2014-10-20,5096557,Carrie,"A lovely place to stay! We had a large group in for the weekend for a convention - 8 in total - but the house was a great fit for us. Close to our event space and the 5, we were within 5-15 minutes of practically anything we wanted. "
1145941,21896749,2014-10-26,21782857,Jan,"We loved this rental - so comfortable and nice. Beds were very comfortable. Good location for us. Owner was very responsive, and had left the refrigerator stocked with breakfast items for us. We will definitely book it again."
1145941,22048039,2014-10-28,17785505,Lura,"We loved Terry's Home away home. the house looks exactly the the pictures, it was very comfortable and welcoming. Terry was great to communicate with, she always responded quickly  and was very polite. We were up for my mom's surgery at UW and needed a place for 6 people. I wanted somewhere comfortable for my mom where we could all be together.  There was plenty of room for everyone and it was nice being able to go ""home"" from the hospital. I'll definitely be checking for openings if we have to come back up and would recommend this house to anyone heading to Seattle. "
1145941,22121026,2014-10-30,19072680,Joe,A fantastic house in a great location!  The house is very comfortable with lots of charm and space.   Located with easy access to most of Seattle's top destinations.   Terry was very easy to work with.   Highly highly recommended.  Fit our group of six (4 adults and 2 kids) very comfortably.   One parking spot on site and easy access to more street parking within a couple of blocks if there is more than one car.   
1145941,22250783,2014-11-02,22199279,Carlie,We had such a wonderful time at Terry's home! This was my first time using AirBNB and it couldn't have been better. Terry's home is beautiful and very close to anything you could want to do. I would happily stay here again. Thanks Terry!
1145941,22484779,2014-11-08,2771317,Mairead,"Terry was an excellent host. We needed some stuff that house didn't have (like hairdryer) and we wrote to her and got them in no time. That was quite awesome! She was very responsive at all times and always ready to help, provide advice, etc. The house looks exactly the same as in photos, it is really cozy and we truly enjoyed our stay there. The location is great as it is away from the crowded city center, but is really close to it, only a short bus ride to the downtown, so... perfect location.
I would highly recommend Terry's house and herself as a host!

1145941,23774999,2014-12-09,2691849,Daniel,"Terry was great to deal with. We never actually met her but she was very responsive via text. The rental is a full house with a fully equipped kitchen, warmly decorated, and very much like being at home. Be aware that there are steps up to the front door and the bedrooms are on the second floor."
1145941,24700266,2015-01-02,16274132,Beth,"Terry made her home welcoming for my family's Christmas visit by putting up a real Christmas tree and tasteful decorations! We enjoyed playing games at the roomy table in the dining room and everyone felt comfy in their rooms with soft sheets and ample blankets. The location was convenient to everything we wanted to see including downtown, the U Distict and Whole Foods. Thanks so much Terry!"
1145941,25472213,2015-01-17,4586525,Jennifer,"Terry's home was a perfect respite for us when we came to town for the funeral of a family member. We were 6 adults, and there was plenty of room for all of us. The house was spotless, roomy, with comfortable beds, and well stocked with bedding, towels, coffee and breakfast food. The location was also great, with easy access to other parts of town, and in close proximity to restaurants and markets (a HUGE Whole Foods is just down the road) We only had one minor issue while we were there (a clogged bathroom drain) but Terry was very responsive in taking care of the problem for us. We would definitely stay here again. "
1145941,26041206,2015-02-02,19139476,Kevin,"She was awesome!  We loved our time here.  The place is beautiful, clean, and felt like such a cozy home.  It was as advertised and a great deal."
1145941,26168653,2015-02-05,26930534,Steven,Terry was very responsive and just generally very easy to work with. Great experience. House was clean and exactly as described. Would definitely book again. 
1145941,26280415,2015-02-08,22630048,Andrew,"The place is a lovely home, with a well equipped and organized kitchen (including a good selection of spices).  The living room is peaceful and comfortable, the dining area perfect for a meal and good conversation. The beds are comfortable and the place is quiet, despite being next to a moderately busy street."
1145941,26736259,2015-02-18,5379845,Andrea,"We couldn't have asked for a better place to stay in Seattle. The location was perfect -- it was easy to walk to the Whole Foods, to Third Place books, and to other shops and restaurants. The house is beautiful, even better than we could have hoped, and it had everything that we needed, including food for breakfast, shampoo and conditioner, and other household staples. Terry was responsive and helpful, kindly allowing us to check in early and answering all my questions quickly. The beds were comfortable, the house was clean, and we felt very much at home. "
1145941,27036431,2015-02-23,21772000,Catherine,"This is a great place to stay in Seattle. Terry's Home away from Home provides a fully equipped kitchen, comfortable living space and great location. All our needs were met. Thanks Terry!"

We were able to stay at ""Home away from Home"" in Seattle and it was perfect for our needs.  We really appreciated and enjoyed the comfort of the home, as we pow-wow'd for hours each day.   The kitchen was perfect for our needs, and Terry even provided muffins for us (so kind!).   The beds were so comfortable, and the location of the home was excellent.   We hope to be back again.  Thank you very much, Terry!"
1145941,27593421,2015-03-08,27477040,Sara,"This was one of my favorite AirBNB experiences! The home was beautiful and very welcoming. It felt just like my own home. There was every household item that you can think of and it was well taken care of. We got in late but it was great to come ""home"" to a well lit house that smelled amazing. Terry had all the information (WiFi password, map of the kitchen, etc.) in easy to read places and was very well organized. The house itself was in a good location, close to the freeway and bars/restaurants. The house was better than we could have expected and I would highly recommend it! "
1145941,28002801,2015-03-16,2143109,Crystal,"My family and I stayed at Terry's beautiful home in March. We had an absolutely wonderful time. The house is gorgeous and very clean. It slept two couples, one single and two kids very comfortably. Terry was great. Though we didn't have the opportunity to met her in person, she was very responsive and helpful. It was a great experience and I hope to stay there again.  "
1145941,28193668,2015-03-19,4873557,Beth,My parents and in laws stayed here during the birth of our first baby. They raved about the place. They noted all of the extras on hand. We'd gladly recommend this spot to family and friends during future visits. 
1145941,28517809,2015-03-25,26762330,Faith,"We felt like we were visiting an old friend who made sure we were welcome and comfortable. The house is really charming. There were five people in our party and we all enjoyed the house immensely.  When we arrived there was a lovely bottle of wine and a special surprise in the centerpiece that made us feel welcome. The house appointments and decor are very nice. Cable,  wi-fi  AND a fireplace made us feel right at home. It was raining most of our visit, but we still enjoyed a sun break in the backyard. The dining room has a great table and we had the chance to sit and visit with some fine wine. We also loved the track at the beautiful high school across the street. Downtown was about 15 to 20 minutes and easy freeway access. made for great day trips. A few evenings we walked to some great restaurants in the area and loved Pies and Pints! There is a great fresh farmer's market and Whole Foods a few blocks away. Seattle is so much fin we will book again in the future and recommend it for anyone looking for a  new way to experience the city."
1145941,29063262,2015-04-03,2097040,Julian,"This is a great house, in a great location. Next time we visit Seattle, we will stay here again! Thanks Terry for being a great host! "

1145941,30669028,2015-04-26,21763084,Leslie,"Terry was great: very responsive and genuinely wanted us to be comfortable and enjoy our stay. She made that easy with a few little extras and a home that felt, well, homey. It was a great place for us to gather family from across the US for the weekend. Good location, too, with easy access to town and to all things Seattle. "
1145941,31044661,2015-05-01,8072414,Aapo,"I stayed with my brother and dad here. The house is big and comfortable, at a very nice spot for university area.  Highly recommended."
1145941,31515718,2015-05-06,27802188,Lory,"We loved staying at Terry's house. The kitchen was wonderfully stocked with basics and beyond, the living room was both cozy and airy, the beds were all very comfortable with nice linens, and the bathrooms were spotless, with modern fixtures. Terry responded to every query within minutes, and went out of her way to make us comfortable, giving us access to her laundry machines (by appointment) and even bringing us flowers! Staying at Terry's was a 100% positive experience."
1145941,31877667,2015-05-11,11483042,Jessica,"Terry was very welcoming - fresh eggs from the chickens next door was a really special touch. The house was adorable and perfect for our group. The neighborhood was great and had tons of awesome shops, restaurants, and bars within walking distance. I would definitely recommend this space to anyone looking to stay in Seattle. "
1145941,32372336,2015-05-17,22496089,Velia,"Although we just had 3 days/ 2 nights at Terry's house, staying there was great. The place is located within easy (bus) driving distance to Seattle downtown & near to Green Lake - perfect to get to know Seattle's diverse facets. The house itself is quite commodious - with a full equipped kitchen & 3 bed rooms. Terry was very kind, accommodating & flexible during the whole time of our stay; if you have any questions, she answers/ helps you immediately. I would like to stay there again, when I visit Seattle next time. "
1145941,32751770,2015-05-21,28979578,Yihan,"It's a really nice place for a family to stay. I was with other five family members. We enjoyed our stay a lot. It's really convenient to buy some food and cook at home. The host Terry was very helpful and she responded quickly. The only shortcoming was that there is only one shower even though there are two bathrooms, so people needed to wait a little bit to take shower. Overall, I recommended this place!"
1145941,33893204,2015-06-02,24377046,Christine,"This was our first experience with airbnb.    Terry was accommodating and let us check in early.  Her home is nicely decorated (although getting a bit worn in some areas) and is well appointed with towels, toilet paper and most essentials.  The only thing missing were hangers in the closets (there were a few but bent & old for the most part).   
It was certainly more spacious than a hotel room (although not quite as spacious as the photos) and there were 5 of us, so we thought it was good value for a city area.  
As for location, I think the positive comments on this are based on the fact that the home is close to Whole Foods and easy to get on/off I-5 etc.  
The 2 negatives for me were:
1) on a busy road with lots of bus traffic
2) no air conditioning and no screens on windows, so when we tried to open the windows to cool things off, mosquitoes flew in and the buses were very loud.  2 of the 3 bedrooms face the street.  There is a fan in every bedroom though.  The master faces the back and is quiet.  This would be less of an issue in the fall/winter.
You should be aware that Terry and/or her housekeeper live in the basement.  This actually made us feel safe.  This is mentioned in the property description, but I missed it."
1145941,34198071,2015-06-06,21085679,Janette,"Terry's ""Home away from Home"" really and truly was a home away from home. Everything about this house is awesome. It's spacious and cozy at the same time. I really enjoyed the way the house was decorated and had a homey feel to it. It was also walking distance to major bus lines, and some bars and restaurants that we had fun wandering into. My friends and I really enjoyed ourselves at this airbnb, we even lit a small bonfire on our last night. If we ever make it back to Seattle, this is where we will stay."
1145941,34928901,2015-06-14,2326346,Maria Cristina,"I got this place for my five adult family members. The house was nice and clean.  Terry was thoughtful to leave a few groceries for her guests and eggs from the chickens next door. Terry was also responsive to my questions about her place.

 My main concern was confusion with Terry’s rules on “unregistered guests” and a call out to potential guests. From my messages I felt I was upfront that my entire family would be in the same area with me, using multiple airbnb hosts.

My family arrived from a 15 hour flight Sunday afternoon and decided to have take out and eat dinner together at Terry’s airbnb. The next morning I received a message from Terry that there were reports of unregistered guests staying “most of the time” at her house. I explained to her that my sister’s family just came over for dinner. She asked me to the review our messages and her posting on house rules.

After reviewing our message history and the description of the place, I did not see any explicit mention from Terry prohibiting visitors from coming over. The only mention I could find was in the Terry’s house rules listing stating “we don’t appreciate parties in the house with people not staying at the house without prior approval”. Again, the only time my other family members were over was a short Sunday dinner. It was not a party. I explained to Terry that my sister’s family was staying in another airbnb and not staying in her house.  I received a message from her that no visitors are allowed to come over, apart from the 5 adults that were registered because of liability issues.

After Terry made me aware of the liability issues she face from having visitors over, I let my family know because I did not want to put Terry in jeopardy with that or her neighbors. Terry did allow my family to come for quick visits between the hours of 12 – 7 pm however, it was disappointing and embarrassing for me to tell my family that there were restrictions for other family members. My sister’s Airbnb host graciously allowed my family to use her house as meet up spot going forward.

This is the first time I’ve encountered a “no visitor: restriction with airbnb so I did not think to ask this before booking this house. Had I known about this “no visitor” rule, I would have definitely chosen to find another place for my family to stay even if it was more expensive"
1145941,35207144,2015-06-16,30176605,Mary Beth,"We loved our stay at this true ""home away from home!"" Terry made us feel very welcome with the house all set up for the six of us, supplies for breakfast, and a kind offer to text with any questions. There were helpful directions to find things around the kitchen, which made it easy to get breakfast prepared and enjoy our days in Seattle. We had everything we needed! The back patio was a wonderful place to eat breakfast.

The location is great. We walked to Green Lake the first afternoon where I tried stand-up paddle boarding for the first time. 

It was warm during our stay, so we needed to cool down the rooms by having the windows open. There's traffic noise for the two front rooms, but the fans helped a bit to tone it down, and with the windows closed, you can hardly hear it. 

Thanks, Terry!"

The bathroom upstairs was good size, with both a shower and a bathtub and the bedrooms were all comfortable. The house is easy to get to, and only a few miles from downtown Seattle - the parking on 68th street is probably easiest to use, and it's just a short walk across the street. The rooms are well sized, and easily accommodate a small group get together.  "

1145941,42672462,2015-08-15,12923297,Julia,"Terry was a wonderful and attentive host. One morning we enjoyed fresh eggs and chocolate dropped on our doorstep! The house was close to everything and easy to get around Seattle. Parking was at the location, on the street, which was a real plus. The home has a great feel! Plenty of room to stretch out."
1145941,42925139,2015-08-16,32792741,Ellen,"Very clean, cute, and comfortable house with some great spaces for people to gather. I had a short stay here with a group of girls, and Terry was very welcoming (left us a card and muffins!) and made our stay very easy by communicating with me promptly via text to arrange details. Well-equipped kitchen and pretty rooms with no clutter. Great location - close to I-5, Greenlake, North Gate, etc. Overall a great (albeit short) stay here! "
1145941,44108370,2015-08-24,33561388,Carol G,"The house is lovely, very clean , with plenty of good size rooms in which to spread out. It is more than enough for a family of four.  The back patio is a great space for eating and visiting. The kitchen is well-stocked and organized; we appreciated all the spices and basic condiments available.  Terry left us fresh fruit and delicious eggs from her neighbor's upon arrival and left us chocolate on our departure.
Terry was very quick to respond to any questions via text. We appreciated her spirit of generosity.  The house was well-stocked with linens and towels and paper products.
The house location was great, near Green Lake. Easily accessible. Can be a little noisy with traffic at certain times but the fans provide white noise.
Our stay was very comfortable, easy and enjoyable.  We would return."
1145941,45148518,2015-08-31,2700084,Patrick,"nice place and great value!  reasonably close to the conference we were attending.  terry was very responsive and accommodating.  she even left some (new) juice, soda, water, and eggs in the fridge to welcome us to her home.  everything was clean and towels were nice."
1145941,45335293,2015-09-01,31220588,Maia,"This truly is a ""Home away from Home"". House is in a beautiful neighborhood-- easy access to everything you want to do in Seattle. Close to a bus that takes you to Green Lake, U District, Downtown, etc! We stayed here with a 4 month old baby and it was perfect! Terri was a wonderful host and was very attentive to anything we needed. She gave great idea for dinner and drinks & made us feel right at home. Of COURSE we will be staying here again when we come back to Seattle! LOVE from Oregon!!!"
1145941,45888685,2015-09-06,5705395,Spencer,"Terry is a very gracious and helpful host. Nice place with good amenities. House faces a busy street across from a high school, so can be noisy at times.."
1145941,46575712,2015-09-12,3269199,Amir,"Terry was very responsive and had detailed instructions with everything in the property. The location was great with amenities within walking distance and Greenlake a little further away. The property was very clean and well stocked, though it does need some TLC. One of the doors had a broken hinge and the floorboards were not in a good state. We had an issue with the heat when we checked in but Terry was on top of it and got someone to fix it asap. The one issue I had during the stay was with the downstairs dog making a mess in our patio (which was eventually cleaned up by them) but prevented us from using it."
1145941,48267851,2015-09-25,34043234,Samuel,"Great place and even greater host! Terry left us all the amenities you could ever need, from shampoo to fresh eggs from the chickens next door.  We couldn't find the remote for the cable when we arrived Friday night and Terry had a new one to us Saturday morning. I strongly recommend Terry and her home."
1145941,48909628,2015-09-29,42720587,Guanyi,非常棒的房子，地点便利，离超市药店都很近，卧室温馨干净，厨房设备齐全，冰箱里准备了食物和饮料，虽然没与房东见到面，但处处感受到她的用心。
1145941,49072584,2015-09-30,44939525,Christopher,Terry was an amazing host. She thought of everything I would need and then some. Not to mention the house is beautiful and was in a perfect location for me. With many bedrooms to choose from and a comfortable welcoming feel I hope to book this house again the next time I'm in Seattle. 
1145941,49715652,2015-10-05,39490733,Mariann,"Big, comfortable house in a convenient location. The kitchen is fully stocked with pots, pans, dishes, spices, etc. Terry invites guests to eat food in the house. When we arrived there were delicious organic apples, free-range eggs, and orange juice in the fridge. Thanks, Terry! We rely enjoyed our stay."
1145941,50158849,2015-10-10,27014977,Wei,"It's lovely house.if there is a chance,I will choose it again.Terry is very nice host.English is not my mother language,so maybe I cannot express my words exactly.what I want to say is I am very happy in Terry 's house."
1145941,51262267,2015-10-19,5096557,Carrie,"This is the second time we have stayed with Terry and once again, she bent over backwards to help us out.  We have a large party of professionals in town for an event and having a house to stay in really helps everyone out.  Terry is quick with replies and happy to help out if she can.  We really appreciated the chance to stay again!"
1145941,53385293,2015-11-08,20958152,Yumi,"Terry was extremely thoughtful. The kitchen was fully stocked with everything, including eggs, oj, sparkling water and muffins. The location was perfect for us and the house was cozy. "
1145941,53580302,2015-11-09,45490485,Lance,"Terry was a godsend.  Her home made me feel at home, ver spacious, recently remodeled kitchen (done very well I might say). I could tell she took great pride and joy being a host.  The house was immaculately clean, the bed made very nice, towels laid out.  She even had a little something I could eat and drink until I could get to the store.

The location was also perfect - 5 minutes to pretty much everything, including an amazing long forest park just 3 blocks away and #1 restaurant according to yelp just 2 doors down.

It was very romantic and charming.  You will love it and you will be very well taken care of... likely the best you'll every find with Airbnb. "
1145941,53927954,2015-11-14,28938535,Erin,"Had a wonderful stay! The house was beautiful and just as described. Terry even left some fresh fruits to enjoy! She was easily accessed by phone if needed, yet we had complete privacy. 
Thanks again for the excellent hospitality! We hope to stay at this 'Home away from home' on our next trip to Seattle. "
1145941,55195132,2015-11-29,623055,Brian,"Terrific home in a great location. We stayed for five nights, and cooked a Thanksgiving dinner for six adults and two kids. The kitchen has everything you need, the living and dining rooms are super comfortable and spacious, and the bedrooms were all comfortable. Everything was clearly explained, and Terry responded to several of my texts within minutes during our stay. There is definitely some street noise from two of the bedrooms, but you're then within a 5-10 minute walk to great restaurants, coffee shops, and Whole Foods. Bonus - a working fireplace for those cold, rainy Seattle nights! "
1145941,55693469,2015-12-04,17368672,Luke,"Terry's home is beautiful and had everything we needed for a comfortable stay. The location is very convenient, with easy access to great spots in Seattle. They even provided a generous selection of breakfast snacks! I would certainly recommend Terry's home to prospective guests!"
1145941,56402019,2015-12-13,49132466,Josh,"Our group had such a great time in Seattle and Terry's house and hospitality was perfect!! The location is great, quick to get to downtown Seattle and central to great tourist spots and restaurants. Terry was responsive and helpful before and during our trip. It made for a great weekend at a spacious and inviting house."
1145941,56984372,2015-12-20,22554694,Chris,"Terry's house is fantastic! Great location and plenty of room for everyone. I enjoyed the convenience of how close things are to her place and how homely her place felt. 
Make this a must rent when in town next. "
1146966,5025109,2013-06-08,1358786,Justin,Ann was a great host who was very kind and welcoming. Not only did Ann do everything she could to make sure we were comfortable but she even went out of her way to put chocolate bars on our pillows! If you are visiting the Seattle area I highly recommend staying with her.
1146966,5185350,2013-06-17,5350712,Gina,"Ann was an amazing host! She was in great communication with me surrounding my transportation and arrival. She is a gracious host and made sure that all of us that were staying were comfortable and had anything we needed to make our stay the most enjoyable! She even provided us with transportation to our event the last day to prevent us from lugging suitcases! 
The house is beautiful and really is nestled in the trees. There was an amazing view from my treetop room. I was on a busy schedule and did not get to spend time out in the beautiful backyard garden, nor get a nighttime fire pit experience! I definitely will on my next trip however! I would most certainly recommend anyone staying with Ann!! Thank you Ann!!!!"
1146966,5231680,2013-06-19,2883555,Nan,"This living situation couldn't have been more perfect for myself and 2 of my guests staying in Seattle last weekend. We each had our own beds to stay in - which was at the maximum, all we really needed. Ann's place is equipped with 2 full bathrooms so there was no wait for the showers in the morning. Ann was a delightful host and ensured that our safety and comfort needs were met first and foremost. She even has a great backdoor space and fire pit that we didn't get a chance to experience/enjoy! I would definitely stay at Ann's again! "
1146966,5328038,2013-06-24,5173749,Noah,"Ann was great and the house is incredible. I stayed in an upstairs bedroom and a bathroom was across the hall. Ann was a super accommodating host. Comfy bed, great location, so many good things to say. I stayed for 3 days and felt comfy/safe the whole time. "
1146966,5477087,2013-07-01,5945346,Katie Anne,"Ann was a wonderful host! She was accommodating and friendly. Her house is lovely, and the Treetop Room was private, quiet, and comfortable. Ann's home is close to many shops, bars, restaurants, and bus lines. I'd definitely recommend staying here if you're looking for a cozy spot to stay in Seattle. Great views, too-- we were able to see Mt. Rainier from her patio!"
1146966,5610607,2013-07-08,6806167,Tom,"Ann hosted my husband and me for an entire week in July 2013.  This was our first experience with airb&b and she set the bar impossibly high for hosts to follow!  She opened her entire home to us, and I spent hours cooking in her newly refurbished kitchen!  She was exceedingly helpful and made our week spent in Seattle with our daughter and friends so delightful.  She has a very secluded home in a lovely area in Seattle and a garden that is heavenly.  Couldn't have asked for a more generous soul to share living quarters....we certainly hope to return some day..."
1146966,5862901,2013-07-20,6432892,Tony,"Great rooms, great location in Fremont within walking distance of shops and restaurants on 36th. We loved our stay there. Possibility of having to share upstairs with another guest/family might be a drawback for some, and older guests should be aware of that the house is on a steep hill if walking. Would definitely consider staying there again."
1146966,6349234,2013-08-09,7180450,David,"Super hostess, house is charming older home in a woodsy part of Fremont, lovely view of Mt. Ranier - super kitchen to prepare a meal for al fresco dining on the deck and relaxed conversation with Ann and others.    "
1146966,6428429,2013-08-12,7386721,Fiona,"Had a great stay. Lovely location and charming host. House is on a steep hill (so be warned, although all of Fremont is pretty hilly) with a pretty view over the garden and Fremont. Charging outlets for electronics are a bit limited and internet access was spotty but Ann spent a whole day trying to get it fixed. I take my hat off to her that she kept her cool. Very much enjoyed talking with Ann and the other guests. "
1146966,6607320,2013-08-18,7677354,Yves,"Nous avons passé 2 jours fantastiques chez Anne; nous étions à l'étage, chambres confortables et ravissantes et salle de bains pour nous; Anne nous a laissé l'accès à la cuisine, salon et salle  manger. Nous avons pu dîner sur sa terrasse, au dessus d'un joli jardin avec vue sur le Mont Rainier.
Anne est adorable, gentille, serviable. elle nous avait acheté des croissants pour notre petit déjeuner!
elle avait invité des amis le vendredi soir et nous avons pu discuter et échanger avec ceux ci; nous avons ainsi pu rencontrer des ""locaux"" de Seattle très sympathiques et garder des contacts. Nous avons partagés de très bons moments avec eux et notre hôtesse; séjour super et nous recommandons cette adresse; nous reviendrons chez Ann lors d'un prochain séjour . MERCI à Ann"
1146966,6756819,2013-08-24,6079166,George,"Ann is a welcoming and generous host. We had a wonderful time in Seattle staying at her house. The room has a fantastic view of the garden, the city and the mountains in the background. You walk a couple of blocks and you are in a lively artsy neighborhood with lots of cafes, bars, restaurants and shopping; back at the house you are in a forested oasis of peace and calm. We would definitely go back to Ann's house when visiting Seattle."
1146966,7033833,2013-09-04,6647728,Manu,"From the moment Ann welcomed us with a warm hug and a Theo's chocolate bar we knew the stay would be pleasant. Everything worked just fantastic - the bed was so comfortable. The location was fantastic for coffee lovers like us: two great coffee shops within just a few minutes walk downhill.  Throughout our visit Ann was very helpful, she even volunteered to give us a ride downtown to catch the train to the airport. "
1146966,7202107,2013-09-10,1569618,Sheila,"Talk about a wonderful weekend.  The charm just positively oozes from this home.  This was a HOME for a weekend.  The lovely garden out back, the patio perfect for taking in the sweet air and the massive mountain, the comfy room and great bed...all priceless.  This home is located super close to the main strip in the funky area of Fremont.  Ann's hospitality and care (my hubby feel while there and she gave him a great pain relieving treatment) made this weekend absolutely perfect."
1146966,7341925,2013-09-16,2162970,Ryan,Anne's House was great and very accessible to everywhere we needed to go. It's the type of place to have quiet when you want it and close to the main drag for some fun. Comfortable bed and shower with great views of the city. 
1146966,7428587,2013-09-19,270117,Richard,"We were recently in Seattle and after 5 nights in an impersonal hotel we decided to try Airbnb.  We chose the Freemont area and Ann graciously accepted our last minute reservation.  We had a clean, spacious room, with a very comfortable bed and a great view through tall trees of Lake Union and the Freemont area. It's a quick walk down hill to Freemont shops and restaurants.  Ann's house has a very welcoming feel thanks to the artwork and fabric that decorate the living and dining rooms.  We took over her kitchen for several meals (the nearby Puget Sound Consumer's Coop has excellent produce and a wide variety of organic foods) and we enjoyed visiting with Ann and other guests around the dining room table.  I look forward to our next visit. "
1146966,7651389,2013-09-28,630534,Brandy,Ann is a wonderful host! Staying with her at her home was comfortable and convenient while I was in town for a class. Thanks again Ann!
1146966,7718381,2013-09-30,8729453,Julie,We had a great stay with Ann in Fremont. The house is in a really quiet street but just minutes away from the many good bars and restaurants in Fremont. Our room was very cosy and sharing the bathroom with other guests was no problem. Ann was very welcoming and gave us helpful advice about places to go and things to do.  
1146966,10168004,2014-02-03,11695611,Chris,"Ann was a wonderful hostess and her home gave us exactly what we were looking for - a cozy, warm place to relax after busy, pre-Super Bowl activities. The location is close to restaurants, coffee shops, and the Seattle buzz we find fascinating. We walked around the Fremont District, Wallingford and even treked to Ballard for lunch one day. Ann absolutely cares that her guests have a great experience and we would certainly stay there again.
 "
1146966,10434595,2014-02-18,1591965,Brian,"It was great hanging out at Ann's house. Very beautiful house with great views. Even though it was a little cold, enjoyed sipping coffee on the deck reading with my daughter.

The room was nice and large and waking up with great coffee each morning was a nice treat.  And Ann is a wonderful, very generous host.  I'll be back."
1146966,10783318,2014-03-07,6439972,Adam,I stayed with Ann for a few weeks while working in Seattle. Ann was easy to talk to and easy to reach. The bed was comfortable and the views nice. I recommend Ann's house if you are staying in the Seattle area.
1146966,11261557,2014-03-27,3179610,Dwayne,"Fremont is a fantastic neighborhood, and this spot perched on the hill is a great place to explore it from. The walk up the hill is short, but invigorating. The room is pleasant, has a space to work on a computer, and was very clean. I didn't cook, but the kitchen is well set up, and would be a nice spot to prepare a meal. On site parking is a big plus if you are driving.  Ann is a fine host, and covered all my questions.  In short, a clean, well appointed room in an awesome neighborhood run by a great host.  "
1146966,12271457,2014-04-28,5925844,Scott,"I really enjoyed my stay at Ann's place. It's comfy, quiet, and the bed in the Mountain View room, was very comfortable. As you can see from the pictures, it's very homey, a bit old-fashioned and worn, but well kept and clean."
1146966,14731287,2014-06-25,14177067,Terry,"Ann's place is a lovely little oasis in the middle of a bustling city.  Entering it was like stepping into a private little world.  The window from our bedroom looked out on the backyard.  Every morning I could hear birds chirping and squirrels skittering along the trees.  It was so peaceful and pleasant, that it almost felt like camping in the middle of the city!  Fair warning:  Follow Ann's directions to the B&B because your GPS will give you problems because it will appear as if this segment of North 40th Street is simply a steep driveway.  

This little segment of Fremont, the documented ""center of the universe,"" is special.  It is located close to everything, but almost feels like you are in the country.  We were also fortunate in regard to weather during our visit.  Most mornings Mt. Rainier was visible from our bedroom window.  It was quiet and peaceful, a great way to the start the day.  Though we did not use the firepit in the backyard, we often sat there at the end of the day and simply enjoyed the (bug-free!) outdoors.

Ann herself was a wonderful host, helpful when we needed her to be, but respecting our privacy.  Her home is lovely with artistic touches everywhere.  We had a great time and very much enjoyed our time there.  "
1146966,15055146,2014-07-01,1971733,Caroline,"We've stayed with Ann twice now, and her place is such a nice place to be and she's such a great person to work with!  Helpful but not intrusive, friendly but spacious! Her house in a great part of Seattle as well, located near a lot of things, like parks, restaurants, movies shopping etc. so all-in-all, it's a great experience."
1146966,15494059,2014-07-10,8708580,Lily,"This is wonderful place to stay!! The room is in a lovely house with a garden and it has stunning views. It is spacious, comfortable and quiet. Fremont is terrific neighborhood. It is lush and hilly with beautiful and houses and gardens. There are lots of shops and (very good) restaurants nearby, and the house is about five or six minutes walking from several different bus routes that take you to downtown Seattle in about twenty minutes.  I stayed there alone for part of my stay and was quite comfortable walking around the area at all hours of day and night. Ann, the host, is also great. I had a complicated reservation and she was great with communication and was very kind and accommodating. Once I met her in person I was even more impressed. She is friendly, warm, generous, and helpful, and makes you feel truly at home. I loved my stay (and will in fact be returning for another!) and highly recommend Ann and her place!"
1146966,17094944,2014-08-07,14551480,John,"Ann was home to greet us when we arrived and introduced us to the other guests staying at her house.  She also familiarized us with the house its facilities for cooking and laundry etc.  She also gave us a yummy chocolate bar.  The listing description was very accurate and complete. 
The neighborhood was very nice and quiet and well maintained.  It was  set apart from the main street with lots of trees and raspberry bushes.  It was like a retreat in the middle of the city."
1146966,17492032,2014-08-12,7099785,Charles,"The place was as-advertised, very nice, in a very pretty area of Fremont with great views.  Ann was very friendly and kindly let me drop my bags off before the actual check-in time to make things easier for me. "
1146966,17838572,2014-08-18,17254485,Ryan,"Our experience with Ann was great. Even though we weren't around the house very much on our stay, Ann was always very welcoming and eager to help us out with recommendations about Seattle.

The location of the neighborhood suited us very well, we took the bus downtown almost everyday to see the more renowned sights. Later in our trip we visited the Ballard Locks and Ballard Ave by bus as well. Everything was very easily accessible by public transit (bus) from around Ann's home. It was nice to come back to laid back Freemont after each day out and about.

The room was exactly what we needed. It was large enough for our suitcases to be lying around, but not feel cluttered. Ann's backyard is very nice and peaceful if you want to enjoy a book among the flowers, birds and squirrels."
1146966,18051047,2014-08-21,13955808,Greg,"Nice house and location, close to heart of Fremont. Large room with nice view.  The street looked like a steep driveway.  The doors to the rooms do not have locks on them and the upper bathroom was a bit steamy do to lack of window that could open."
1146966,18349777,2014-08-25,7299261,Bret,"Can't recommend this place enough. Ann is a wonderful host who has an incredibly friendly and engaging spirit. Her place must be seen to be believed, tucked away up and among the city hills and yet just a short bus ride from downtown Seattle. It doesn't hurt that this spot is in Fremont, a neighbourhood with an abundance of great food and coffee shops. Staying here is a must and I hope to make it back again myself some day! "
1146966,18633441,2014-08-29,975560,Theresa,"Ann's place feels like a vacation getaway in the middle of one of Seattle's coolest neighborhoods.  Beautiful ""country in the city"" setting.  My room in the attic was outfitted with basic, no-frills necessities, and had a lovely view of Mt. Rainier through the trees.

At the time of my stay, there was no lock on the bathroom door.  The other guests were aware of this, and there were no awkward moments of accidentally walking in on somebody doing their business.

Due to flight and bus delays, I was late arriving at Ann's house.  She very graciously picked me up at the bus stop in her car, and drove us the short distance back to the house.  She really went above and beyond as a host.  Easy to contact and very responsive.

"
1146966,18880524,2014-09-02,14056753,Karen,"Ann was extremely accommodating regarding our late arrival. The bedroom and bathroom were a little grungy but otherwise fine. Location of the house is good, several bus stops nearby and downtown Fremont just a few blocks away. Easy access into the house, and Ann gives you some space in her fridge too. She's also very communicative.  Would recommend."
1146966,19150728,2014-09-07,1091645,Margot,"Ann's home was a great home base for us on a weekend trip to Seattle. Fremont is a great little neighborhood and it was very easy to get to anywhere in Seattle (we mostly used Uber or walked, but Ann gave us the bus schedule as well). The room is neat and minimalist, just note that you may be sharing a bathroom if there is another guest staying across the hall, but the bed was comfy and the bathroom wasn't a problem at all. Thanks Ann!"
1146966,19332736,2014-09-10,1971733,Caroline,"Ann is always a pleasure to see and is very welcoming.  We've stayed with her three times now and she's like a friend, and of course, a neighbor to boot, since we often stay at her place while we rent our own house!   
Her home, back patio and location are perfect for getting around easily to many areas and sights in Seattle worth seeing, so we highly recommend her nicely appointed rooms."
1146966,24101897,2014-12-20,21097410,Xiang,"The location is quite good which is right adjacent to the Fremont downtown while very quiet. The host is experienced and professional in handling all the issues during our stay here, and quite warmhearted to try to accommodate our requests. It has been a great experience trough airbnb in finding such a nice host."
1146966,41420705,2015-08-07,37841695,Richard,"Ann was very welcoming.  Good overall space, plenty of room in the bedroom.  "
1146966,42113137,2015-08-11,30673332,Monika,"My friend and I were just visiting Seattle to explore the city and Ann's place was the perfect place for us to stay. The house has a nice open feel to it and Ann is super sweet.  The surrounding neighborhood is great too, lots of places to walk to and eat or grab coffee! Parking is not bad either. Ann was able to provide a space for us right outside her house but if that wasn't there, I still feel like we would've been able to find something pretty easily.  "
1146966,43033504,2015-08-17,6204901,Helen & Peter,"Ann was a delightful host.  The accommodation was cosy, comfortable and most convenient.  Each evening it was great to return to the ""forest"" enclave away from the hustle and bustle of Fremont.  A shared kitchen and bathroom with other guests was not an issue and worked well.  Our host had lots of information on hand and happily shared her local knowledge and travel experiences.  When we return to Fremont we are looking forward to staying with Ann again.

1146966,43649833,2015-08-21,1269689,Matt,"My son and I had an excellent stay with Ann. Everything was nice and clean and exactly as described in her listing. Ann herself was very nice, easy going, and interesting to boot. We were very happy with our time there."
1146966,44310417,2015-08-25,37843264,Michael,"The place looked even better than how it looks it person! My sister, cousin, and I stayed in the rooftop room and it was more than enough space for us. Ann was also very accommodating and open to feedback. I texted her about needing an extra comforter and she got it to us right away. She even got us bottled water because she thought we may not enjoy drinking the sink water. The only downside to the place is that there is no microwave but that shouldn't be a deal breaker. Plus, it's probably way healthier to ditch the microwave anyways. The place was located three blocks from restaurants / bars. Will definitely be staying here again if I'm back in Seattle!"
1146966,45251219,2015-09-01,33576560,Cynthia,"Ann was very welcoming. She is very kind, informative and is always responsive. The house is very clean and I love how artsy it is. The house is nice and quiet which is great when you come from a day out in the town and ready for rest. For my trip we went back and forth to the city and the distance was perfect. "
1146966,46157193,2015-09-08,20279973,Russell,"Ann was sweet and welcoming. She gave us a pleasant tour of her house and great recommendations of the city. She supplied us with plenty of towels and gave us some nice chocolate.

The neighborhood is nice and quiet. Restaurants are within walking distance.

Had a pleasant stay. Thanks Ann!"
1146966,46645467,2015-09-12,42920714,Saleel,Ann is a wonderful host. The room pictures are pretty accurate and she made us feel quite accommodated. The beds were clean and neat and so was the bathroom. She also gave us Seattle made dark chocolate which was yummy. The neighborhood is very nice and lively and close to downtown which makes it convenient. The patio has a great view too. I would highly recommend the place
1146966,47491971,2015-09-19,41210392,Carine,"Ann really succeeded to make me feel like home!  She was there for me and adapt herself to my needs.
Being there was really simple and she made my life easier during my trip.  I enjoed my time there.  "
1146966,48294939,2015-09-25,39430215,Martha,"Ann was very welcoming and kindly accommodated our need for a later check-in time. The house is surrounded by beautiful trees and yet Mt. Rainier can still be glimpsed from the balcony. Our room was very  comfortable, and we enjoyed visiting with our host, though our time was limited. We would definitely love to stay with Ann again!"
1146966,48577985,2015-09-27,5469300,Siew Wan,"Anne has a very lovely, cozy home with lots of character, tucked away on a quiet street with lots of mature trees.  The room was comfortable and clean with a great view of the Fremont area.   All went smoothly with arriving and departing as Anne kept good communication with us.  "
1146966,49185776,2015-10-01,40425581,Cecilia,"Ann's home is amazing! Such a cool space and location. We had a car which made it easy for us to get around but Fremont is definitely worth exploring and a very interesting area. Ann was a lovely host, very friendly and hospitable. The room is bright and comfy and it's great to have a bit of privacy with the landing space between rooms. The pictures don't do it justice, really lovely home. "
1146966,49681024,2015-10-05,4422766,Ga Rick,The listing was as described. The house was very nice and walking distance from Fremont restaurants and shops.
1146966,50179756,2015-10-10,14089981,Julie Jia-Fen,"Fremont is a nice neighborhood. Taking the bus, we could easily get to downtown and other spots. The room is neat and clean. And we had full access to the kitchen equipments and open area."
1146966,50554722,2015-10-12,36243196,Shermaine,"The listing description was very accurate, it helped my friends and I to quickly locate the house. The neighborhood was peaceful and quiet, seems to be a very safe place. The host was friendly and warmly welcomed us."
1146966,51197525,2015-10-18,45629952,Ursula,Thank you Ann for letting us inside your beautiful and well-kept home! The house is beautiful inside and out with amazing views of Seattle. It's a short walk to a bus stop and a short ride to downtown Seattle. Very clean and an amazing first air BNB experience. She even left chocolate for us!
1146966,52061526,2015-10-26,42144805,Ron,"Everything was better than I expected and I felt very welcomed. The house was great, full of interesting art and great views.  Room and space to make the stay a wonderful time.  In a great neighborhood and can't wait to go and stay again.  A delightful, full of life host."
1146966,52894287,2015-11-02,1105605,Alberto,I had a really nice stay with Ann. Everything was wonderful and the place and its surroundings were very nice and charming. Ann was really welcoming and on top of everything -- even when we arrived from the airport at midnight. The place is really close to a lot of great spots in Fremont and I absolutely recommend staying here. I'll definitely be staying with Ann again next time I'm in Seattle.
1146966,53373930,2015-11-08,46794232,Lisa,"My stay at ""Treetop and mountain views - Fremont!"" was my first experience with Airbnb, and it was outstanding. Ann was caring and attentive, and she even greeted me with an offer of a cup of tea upon arrival, which was late due to my flight being from the East Coast.

The premises themselves were truly lovely. Every morning I awoke to a gorgeous treetop view of one of the main bridges to downtown Seattle. The rainy season had begun, but the trees still sported many leaves and I can easily imagine how even more beautiful this location must be in the spring, summer, and early fall.

My room was wonderful. Spacious, clean, and unique, it was always a welcome place to return to after a long day, whether that having been spent sightseeing and hiking or attending a training. The entire house reflects Ann's artistic and creative sensibilities, and it was a delight simply to sit in the living room and look around, taking it all in.

I loved being close enough to Fremont to walk around and discover things on my own. Indeed, I could have spent all my time in Fremont and been completely happy. Lucky for me, Ann had the bathroom and bedroom well-stocked with Fremont and Seattle-centric magazines that offered all sorts of ideas for potential excursions and great places to eat. And as suggested by Ann, the proximity of the Lighthouse Coffee Roasters, only a few (albeit glute-enhancing) blocks away, was a lovely taste of both local flavor (mmm - their lattés were great!) and milieu.

At Ann's suggestion, I took advantage of several sunny days to walk around Fremont and hike in Discovery Park. I also had the unexpected chance to take a ferry to Vashon Island, which was a fantastic treat.

Ann's home was even prettier than ""advertised."" My bedroom and the shared bathroom were impeccably clean (actually, the whole house was). The wifi worked without a hitch.

I would recommend this venue wholeheartedly. Ann's commitment to ""doing this right"" and her enthusiasm about the Airbnb experience overall make her a wonderful ambassador for this experience. Indeed, I hope I'll be able to stay here when I come to Seattle again, hopefully within the next few months - and maybe I'll even bring my husband!

I heartily recommend this listing."
1146966,54605670,2015-11-22,46941953,William,"The house was wonderful, on a hill overlooking the Fremont neighborhood of Seattle. The host was very welcoming, and made me feel at home, with lots of local info about what to see and do.  Good kitchen facilities, with lots of space to do your cooking and store food in the refrigerator."
1146966,56329619,2015-12-12,31654343,David,Very welcoming and accommodating.  Ann is a great hostess.  
1146966,56639958,2015-12-15,9859152,Benjamin,Everything was perfect.
1146966,57255319,2015-12-23,3457540,Carol,"Ann was a charming host and the treetop cottage was also charming.  I'm fairly picky when it comes to a clean kitchen so that could have been better. There was a little confusion with some of the details which could be resolved with more distinct house rules - like parking, trash & compost separation (Seattle has very strict and specific requirements), and inadequate internet, minor issues which would have made for a more complete stay.   "
6975036,39472514,2015-07-24,36557278,Cam,The host canceled this reservation 14 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.

6975036,41386724,2015-08-07,5756322,Chelsea,"Meg, her two cats, and her roommate made us feel very welcome. The room was nice and clean. The bathroom was very clean as well. 

It got a bit warm since there is no AC, and a a little too loud with the windows open, since they are street-side to a busy street.  "
6975036,42710014,2015-08-15,36819621,Teresa,"Meg's Belltown apartment is ideally located blocks from the Westlake lightrail station, and easy walking distance to Pike's Place Market and great restaurants. Her place is light and clean, though a bit warm without A/C. The urban neighborhood and street noise may be an issue for some, but we found it interesting and still slept well. The balcony is tiny but perfect for sitting back with a glass of wine and people watching from above, with a great view of the Space Needle and harbor. The cats are sweet and Meg's roommate was very nice. "
6975036,48786215,2015-09-28,43901925,Joanne,It was easy to connect with host. Access to apartment was easy - parking was great. Area was easy to walk to downtown core. Great restaurants and pubs nearby.Apartment was clean and quiet. Thanks so much.

6975036,54180241,2015-11-16,446106,Peter,"Me and my buddy stayed at Meg's place.  There was a misunderstanding about the place since I searched for entire places on AirBNB, but Meg was understanding when I found out She was only renting out 1 room.  I still went forward with the reservation since it was in a great location in Belltown.  Meg and Amanda were very accommodating and very nice.  The parking was the biggest issue since they only allow 4 hour time slots and you cannot pay ahead of time so we had to come back every 4 hours to refill the meter until after 8pm on Saturday & Sunday is free.  The best thing about the place was it was very clean and it was walking distance to everything like Pike's Market, Space Needle, and tons of restaurants/bars nearby!  "
7324041,38801114,2015-07-18,6350484,Beth,"Tim and his wife were awesome!  Very easy to communicate with and their place is so cute, with plenty of room.  There we 2 of us, but could easily have fit 4.  And I loved the garden right outside.  We had a fantastic time here!  The bus stop is a quick walk down the street, and there's a great bakery a few blocks away.  I'd definitely stay here again, thank you both so much!!"
7324041,39121574,2015-07-20,26177680,Greg,"Tim was a perfect host! I really enjoyed the ease of checking in and out and would highly suggest this rental to anyone going to seattle. The apartment and property were well maintained, clean, and very easily accessible from downtown Seattle by city transit or by Car2Go. 
Could not have asked for a better experience!"
7324041,39447541,2015-07-23,34542101,Ryan,Timothy was very welcoming and the suite was absolutely perfect. Had everything we needed to make our own meals and truly enjoy our time

7324041,40374471,2015-07-30,26806408,Chris,"Tim has a pretty nice studio in the basement of his home. It's clean, has laundry and kitchen facilities, and even a pull out mattress inside the couch. The space is conveniently located near a grocery store, and we never had any issues with the neighborhood. Tim as a host is excellent: he was there to greet us and let us in, never was a bother, and was easy to communicate with. "

Gracous Hosts, Very Clean & Comfortable, Convenient Location in an Interesting Neighborhood - A Great Value!!!!
Timothy made me feel very welcome from the beginning and was so easy-going about my late arrival on the first night. I arrived weary from a long day travel, coming alone a day ahead of my friend but I felt instantly at home. He greeted me warmly and showed me everything. The apartment was very, very clean and exactly as pictured (with the addition of a couple of floor lamps).  The bed and the pull-out were both very comfortable and the ch-ofa was perfect for lounging.  The kitchen was very useful and the washer/dryer, too.  Nice linens, natural soaps, k-cup coffee and chai - lots of very nice 5-star touches. Like I said, an excellent value. Over the top is the gorgeous garden and sunset views from the backyard. We enjoyed using the patio for breakfast. It was hot the week we were there or we would have been out there at happy hour too. Fortunately Timothy's place has AC, a luxury in Seattle. The convenient unit controlled in the apartment worked great and I imagine it'll keep you cozy in winter, too.  The neighborhood was an eclectic funky mix and we found some incredible ethnic food like the Salvadorian bakery for pupusas, the Hung Long (yes, that's right) Asian market to have a fish cleaned and fried and Giononi's for a slice of New York style pizza listed by the New Yorker magazine in the top 100 USA pizza. That is about 2 blocks away where you'll find grocery, pharmacy, target,etc. and the bus stop. We had a car because the neighborhood is convenient but not right in the center of things. If you are saving money or don't mind a little hike you'd be fine without one here.  Overall I find the location is A+ though because it's close enough, less crowded and has character.  The little dive bars and etc shops in ""downtown"" White Center made for one of the best nights of our trip.  The apartment felt like home right away and really provided the perfect place to meet my friend and share some great times.  We had room to spread out, luxury to hang around late in the mornings instead of searching for coffee and breakfast places, we were lucky enough to visit during tomato season and Timothy brought us a gorgeous bowl of delicious tomatoes! I highly recommend this place! 5 stars"
7324041,42005394,2015-08-10,38474845,Shruti,"My boyfriend and I had an excellent time at this studio. The location worked out well for us and Tim was an exceptional host. He was extremely responsive to my questions leading up to the trip and made a point to greet us when we arrived. He's extremely hospitable and thoughtful, not wanting to be in the way but very much accessible for any questions. 

It's on the lower level of the house, and looks out onto their garden with a little table and chairs. 

The studio comes equipped with all the amenities - washer/dryer, full kitchen, living room area with tv and movies, clean bathroom and ironing board/iron. The space is extremely well organized - no clutter at all - everything you may need accessible and well organized. 

We had a car, which made it really easy to get around and enjoy West Seattle and well as driving out towards other parts of the city. I think it helps to have a car if you're staying in that area but we did take the bus a few times to go into the city center area.  
"
7324041,42330209,2015-08-12,38514511,Philip,"Tim was a great host! He went out of his way to make sure he could welcome us personally and show us around the space and give us tips on things to do in the area. He was also conscious about giving us our space once we got settled in.  Communication was quick and easy. 

The space is lovely, and has everything you need. I really enjoyed the decorations and furnishings, and it gave us plenty of space to launch our travels from. The air conditioning a welcome addition for the unseasonably warm days during our stay. 

Parking was easy, and getting to the house and back to downtown and about was convenient. It was a great deal for the space and amenities it provided. We were even impressed by the quality of soaps and toiletries provided!

The backyard was lovely and a great way to start the day on the way out. 

Overall I highly recommend staying here!"
7324041,43094410,2015-08-17,14639208,Mati,"Tim made us feel right at home! He showed us around, told us a little bit about the area, and even found a great air mattress for a fourth friend! The place is wonderful and has a great vibe. It's really spacious and having that morning cup of coffee in the garden is perfect. 
Thanks Tim! "
7324041,43653243,2015-08-21,38887091,Mehana,"The hosts were very welcoming and sweet. We got fresh flowers and tour of the studio when we first got there. They were very attentive and helpful when needed. Their home is located in a residential area with a shopping center within walking distance. The center seems dangerous at night, but very busy during the day. A nice and convenient place to stay. They have a lovely garden and beautiful view."
7324041,44345535,2015-08-25,40582305,Yen-Fei,"Tim and his wife are great hosts! They are welcoming and make us as comfortable as staying home. The studio is neat. We had everything we need. The view and the family garden are wonderful. It's nice to sit in the garden to enjoy the weather. Also, the location is good. Shopping plaza and bus stops are all within 5 mins walking distance, Bus 560 to the Seattle/Tacoma Airport and Bus D-line to Pike Place Market and cruise ship terminals. It's very convenient!  "
7324041,44932740,2015-08-30,4351417,Bonnie,"We really enjoyed our stay at Tim's studio.  There were three of us (my mom, aunt and me).  I used the sofa bed and it was very comfortable (it was the most comfortable sofa bed I've ever slept on).  The sofa bed is big enough for 2 people so if there are 4 people staying there, it would be fine too.  Loved the garden.  The house is located in a quiet residential area with a shopping center located in a few blocks away.  Also the bus stops located near the shopping center.  Very convenient.  About 30 min to downtown Seattle by public transit.  The studio is very spacious, quiet, clean and tidy.  Tim was very helpful and welcoming and always prompt with replies when I communicated with him.  Highly recommend his studio for anyone who wants to stay in quiet residential area and use public transit to explore Seattle.  "
7324041,45288457,2015-09-01,16317215,Cristina,"Tim was a great host, super helpful and he recommended us the greatest crab restaurant in town!!

7324041,49105987,2015-10-01,31754647,Jessica,"Tim was a great host! We stayed for a month when we first moved to Seattle so we would have time to search for a permanent home.  Tim was very responsive, accommodating, and even offered to move our car if necessary when we had to leave town for a few days.  The apartment is spacious and comfortable. Lots of light and a comfy couch make it a great home. We would stay again if we didn't live in town now!"

It's a very roomy studio included with a full refrigerator, stove and washer/dryer set. I would definitely recommend staying here. It's not too far from downtown and there are a few shopping plazas around including a target just in case you need to pick up essentials. We had a little trouble with the lock but Tim was quick to help us out. Thank you, Tim. We hope to be back soon!"
7324041,51438064,2015-10-20,16063508,Grace,"Tim was great and very helpful. Very convenient to have washer and dryer in unit. Studio is spacious and convenient to grocery, stores, and bus."
7324041,51953450,2015-10-25,45693003,Janice,"Tim is super friendly and welcomed us warmly! He was very understanding when my boyfriend accidentally locked us out (apparently he didn't understand that the bolt should NOT be out at all!) but he took care of it and we made sure it didn't happen again!

The kitchen was very nice! Not a lot of cookware like pots and pans, but he has a lot of baking dishes. The stove works really well. The fridge is very nice! The bathroom is really warm and clean, and the entire place is just very open, airy, yet perfect for me and my boyfriend.

This place is the perfect spot to head to downtown or explore southern part of Seattle. We had no trouble driving to downtown, and renting a car and living here saved us money compared to just renting a (very cheap) hotel. 

We would definitely love to come back again in the future! What a great place!

(P.S. bring an HDMI cable so you can watch movies/tv on the big screen from your laptop. There is a limited number of channels, which was a problem when we wanted to watch the baseball postseason games.)"

He was always available if we needed anything and was very welcoming! This lovely studio in West Seattle was also a very easy commute to and from downtown, the bus stop was only a block away from the studio. We very much enjoyed our stay here! "

My boyfriend and I stayed for 4 days in his apartment, which is really clean and ideal for two persons. It has everything you need, like cooking supplies, hair dryer, cleaning supplies and washing machine and dryer.
His apartment is located in a quiet neighborhood, but a lot of grocery stores are available in 5 minutes (walk). Seattle Downtown, SeaTac or the Southcenter Mall are reachable on only 15-20 minutes by car!
I would totally recommend his apartment if you want to explore Seattle and the nature around!"

Faith is a really sweet person who is responsible and available when most needed, such as when coming and going from her place. She is open to suggestions and wants to make it a great experience for everyone!"

The suggestions I gave her last time were acted on for this visit and it was a very comfortable stay! Her bed is awesome and the apartment is spacious, simple and peaceful. Faith is a lovely person and she makes it so easy and convenient to rent her space. It is in a great location--a walk away from the fun section of Seattle called Fremont. It is also right down the street from SPU, the college our son attends. Thanks, Faith, for having us in your place!"

The bed was comfortable. Her building had a nice patio, and there was laundry on site which came in handy on a long trip. 

The location was great and very safe. It was walking distance to the Fremont neighborhood, where we found tons of great restaurants, shops, and a co-op. Then it was a quick bus ride or Uber to the attractions downtown. 

I had a great experience, and would definitely recommend staying here!"
4116645,34092855,2015-06-04,25108436,John,"Faith's apartment worked out great for me as a convenient clean and comfortable home base for my time in Seattle. Though out of town, Faith was very responsive and receptive arranging for an additional day's stay last minute. Getting around from her place is easy, especially if you're looking for a workout up and down QA hill!
Thanks, Faith, for your excellent if remote hospitality! I'd happily stay again and recommend the apartment to others. "
4116645,34183685,2015-06-05,25108436,John,"So, this is just for the additional day that Faith graciously approved. All great. Thanks!"
4116645,34636313,2015-06-10,31429684,Kathleen,"Great location! We really enjoyed our stay. We stayed 5 nights before our Alaska cruise. Pier 91 is an easy 7 minute drive from the apartment. We took a 15 minute bus ride to Seattle center for sightseeing, the bus stop is less than 1 block from the apartment. There is a wonderful bakery, a coffee shop, a pizza place, and 2 Thai restaurants within a block. Fremont is a 12 minute walk across the bridge where we found several places to eat, shops, and a natural food market. We were able to wash our clothes in a coin operated laundry on the same floor as the apartment. It was really nice having an elevator to get to the apartment so we didn't need to carry our luggage up stairs. "
4116645,37415829,2015-07-06,1931732,Stephanie,"Apartment is in a great location! Very close to the Fremont neighborhood that has lots of restaurants, cafes, and bars.

Brendan was great, he answered a bunch of questions for me and told me about some good bars and restaurants before we got there.  We only stayed 2 nights but he checked in just to make sure everything was good.  The location was great, about 10-12 min walk to Pike/Pine downhill, we cabbed back mostly.  The apt was easy to find, clean and comfortable.  It was perfect for what we were there for.  Thanks Brendan!"
3932674,32997888,2015-05-24,12115561,Peter,"Brendan was a great host. Very accommodating for my early flight in and welcoming to me and my friends. He even offered the beer in his fridge to us haha. He was also very responsive and clear with the instructions on how we would get the key to the place, and how to lock up on our way out. Would definitely stay here again."
3932674,34959322,2015-06-14,23698622,Ryann,"Brendan was very responsive and accommodating. The apartment was very clean and exactly what we were looking for. In a great location, close to a grocery store and in a great area of Seattle. Between Ubers and walking we were able to get around very easily. 

Would definitely recommend staying at this spot! "
3932674,39797186,2015-07-26,10351891,Brian,"During our stay Brenden our host made sure he was available to help or answer questions. However the apartment was perfect. It was clean, well laid out and entry was just as it was communicated. We had no issues and enjoyed our stay. The neighborhood was great also with loads of bars, restaurant and overnight parking lots in the area. Certainly would stay here again and recommend to others "
3932674,40803336,2015-08-02,37087077,Jing,Nice modern apartment in a historic building in a charming neighbourhood. Wandering Goose a few blocks away was great for breakfast. Brendan was very nice and extremely responsive to all our questions. 
3932674,44905130,2015-08-30,1312348,Andrew,"Brendan was a fantastic host - super responsive and accommodating. Checkin was very easy. The apartment is great, very comfortable, in a cute older building but all modern inside. Good quiet location, close to all the action in capitol hill and walking distance to a grocery store and starbucks (of course). He was even nice enough to let me use his garage parking space. Much appreciated! Highly recommend this place."

6134382,31757622,2015-05-09,21340972,Laura,"We did not get in till late, and we had to leave shortly after we woke up.  He was helpful with our rushed last minute timeline.  We met him in the morning and he was very kind.  Although we didn't spend more than three minutes with him.   His home was beautiful, comfortable, and thoughtful.  I would stay here again."

The proximity to the bus stop was an important feature for me, and getting around on mass transit was easy from here.  

The room was clean and the bed comfortable.  I liked having a window that opened to the fresh air.  I would be delighted to stay here again some day.  "
6134382,33710174,2015-05-31,26503119,Patricia,"Harry met me and showed me my room, including shared facilities of kitchen, bathroom and lounge. He showed me the way to the bus stop, discussed what I might like to see and do in Seattle and was very friendly and helpful."
6134382,36529372,2015-06-29,10236052,Louis,"I needed a furnished room for a two-month stay as I contemplated a cross-country relocation to Seattle. Harry and Rich were willing to take a stranger into their home for an extended period of time - and boy am I glad they did. I couldn't have dreamed of more welcoming hosts. They really made me feel at home, despite any messes I may have made in the kitchen. Harry and Rich are perfect hosts. They look forward to hearty discussions with their guests and really took a personal interest in my journey out west. The space was exactly as described, in a beautiful townhouse close to the bus stop and a less than 15 minute walk to Puget Sound. A completely delightful experience.  The highest recommendation for my newest friends. "
6134382,37098685,2015-07-04,6375595,Tristan,"Harry was a fantastic host, very welcoming and great to converse with"

Harry & Rich have a lovely home! It's modern, clean, and very welcoming. Approximately a 15 minute drive from downtown (pier 57, pike place market, etc)  and walking distance to various restaurants and other ""tourist spots.""  Would definitely stay here again! "
6134382,38457427,2015-07-15,2733444,Isaac,We really enjoyed our stay with Harry. The house was super clean. Very comfortable bed. I highly recommend his place. 
6134382,38773709,2015-07-18,32995611,Daniel,"I stayed at this place for three nights but would have loved to stay longer. Strongly recommended. Harry and Rich are the perfect hosts, so is the house. New, in a cool area, with free parking on the street. Cafes, restaurants and the bus station to downtown are just around the corner. The room and the bathroom were even better than what I expected. (The towels are the softest towels I have had on a four months trip.) Harry is very responsive and made me feel welcome from the moment I booked. Together with Rich, they just want you to enjoy the stay, are very helpful with information regarding the city and activities. Thank you, Harry and Rich, for the short but very good time I had in Seattle!"
6134382,38941169,2015-07-19,37478571,Vlad,"This was my first airbnb experience and it was awesome! My hosts were incredibly attentive and welcoming. They clearly enjoy what they do and although I’ve never met them before the whole experience felt like I was visiting good friends. My initial inquiries got a nearly instant and exhaustive response. They followed up with further details shortly before my arrival. I wasn’t familiar with that part of Seattle but didn’t have any problem finding the place. I was a bit concerned not knowing the area yet it appeared to be easily accessible and a short  drive from all my favourite places in Seattle. It was very easy to find free parking steps away from the entrance. The house itself is brand new, nicely decorated, and has a convenient layout with shared living area and kitchen occupying its middle level separating guest quarters from the rest of the house. The place is very modern, spacious and cozy at the same time. My room downstairs was overlooking a small garden, had a very comfortable bed, a few shelves and a large closet. It actually appeared to be better than I anticipated based on the photos. I was sharing a bathroom with another guest. It was conveniently located in the hall between our rooms. Just as everything else in this brand new home the bathroom was very modern and clean. 
Overall, I found this place to be ideal for my weekend trip down to Seattle and a great value. I highly recommend both the place and its amazing hosts."
6134382,39252368,2015-07-21,37512830,Stephanie,"Harry was very flexible with our late check in and the room was clean and comfortable stocked with clean towels. The shared bathroom wasn't a problem and was also stocked with shampoo and conditioner, which was nice. We would definitely stay here again, the location was great and everything was tidy and welcoming!"
6134382,39334513,2015-07-22,1709593,David,"Great place, nice host. We had an easy stay.  Place is clean and neat, very well decorated.  Would not hesitate to recommend or stay there again. Thanks!"
6134382,39471216,2015-07-23,18351985,Julio,"Rick and Harry are very welcoming and helpful people during my recent stay with them. My stay was a very last minute thing, and they were very gracious to get in me in their very clean, comfortable and modern home. The room I stayed in was very nice, with a window to the back yard. The bed was very comfortable and clean, with no sort of odor that you might encounter when you stay with other people (I guess I'm more sensitive to smell). Bathroom was also very clean with all the essential toiletries provided. Both bedroom and bathroom are right next to each other, and away from the main living space, which gives you privacy as well. Near a decently wooded park area where I took a nice walk around. There are some local bar and restaurants within walking distance as well. Highly recommend staying here if your passing by Seattle."
6134382,40190622,2015-07-28,38086531,Brandon,"Harry and Rich were excellent hosts. From the spur of the moment booking till the moment that we left they were both welcoming and accommodating. The room is really beautiful, which is quite befitting of the house itself. Talking with both Harry and Rich was really great, they were able to make great suggestions to us for potential excursions. Over all it was an amazing stay! "
6134382,40372832,2015-07-30,36628301,Piotr,"I couldn't have asked for a more pleasant experience! Wonderful, friendly hosts and a beautiful home. I only wish I could've stayed longer. "
6134382,40483288,2015-07-31,25322166,Stephanie,Harry has a great house!  I love the way he has decorated with inspiration from natural elements.  The bed was very comfortable -- it was actually the only bed we slept on that week that did not make my back sore at all.  Harry is friendly and a good host.
6134382,40803052,2015-08-02,5925159,Lailan,"Harry & Rich were very attentive hosts, generous in giving ideas for me to explore West Seattle, and I'm glad I did! Ate the most amazing almond croissant at the Junction, walked through a beautiful forest, and rented a bike at Alki beach to ride along the water, a perfect day of little adventures hanging out where the locals do.  The view from West Seattle toward the sound is breathtaking, and I highly recommend bringing a picnic out to Lincoln Park on a warm day.  The room & bathroom are lovely, and the bed & pillow are extremely comfy, I slept very well! It's the bottom floor of a well-decorated modern townhouse, so there's lots of privacy.  I was very appreciative of Harry & Rich for coming to pick me up at the airport late on a Saturday night, it was very convenient & allowed me to rest and relax after a long flight.  I had everything I needed to feel comfortable."
6134382,41116383,2015-08-04,36364736,Connie,Wonderful. Most important very clean. Hope I  was as good a guest as he was a host.

Very well connected with downtown, airport and bay area. I wish to have more time to spend with them. Thanks Guys!  "
6134382,42867989,2015-08-16,36671336,Teresa,Harry and Rich were perfect hosts. Their home was modern and clean. They were easy going and easy to talk to. They helped me navigate Seattle and told me where the interesting things to see were. The bed was more comfortable than my own. I would highly recommend this Airbnb to anyone. This is my first experience and I am now spoiled.
6134382,43244489,2015-08-18,36671336,Teresa,Harry and Rich were great hosts. The room and bathroom was clean and bright. The neighborhood was quiet and safe.

6134382,44807285,2015-08-29,38802333,Tim,"Harry and Rich were great hosts. They were interesting to talk with and shared a lot of good info about the area. Their home is modern, very clean, in a nice neighborhood, and within walking distance of restaurants, parks, and the waterfront. The bed was incredibly comfortable. Getting picked up by Rich at the airport and being able to drop off our bags before check-in were greatly appreciated. They made our first time using airbnb and our introduction to Seattle good experiences. Many thanks Harry and Rich!"
6134382,45745171,2015-09-05,1574663,Val,"Staying at Harry's place was a dream! The room is just as described and everything was clean, modern, and comfortable. The two guest bedrooms and bathroom feel very private since they're on a floor below the main living area. The neighborhood was quiet and safe with a cute little shopping district on California Street. Getting to downtown/pike place market/seafront + other attractions was easy via the water taxi — and the free shuttle picks up 2 blocks from Harry's front door! There are also busses that can zip you downtown with stops nearby. Harry and Rich were incredibly friendly and hospitable. Keurig coffee! Welcome mints! A pdf of cool things to check out in Seattle! If there's a category above ""Superhost"" they should be first in line. xx!! val"
6134382,45993674,2015-09-07,20872589,Carolina,"Harry and Rich have an AMAZING HOME.  The design was lovely, spotless and they thought of everything ( a shoe horn by the stairs, brochures for suggested tours, clear instructions, treats and water).  It gives me something to aspire to as a host.

My boyfriend and I had 15 hours between when our cruise ported in Seattle and when we needed a place to rest.  The bed was comfy and slept so soundly. Even with guests next door.  

I had a chance to meet Harry briefly and he was warm and welcoming.

I loved the map idea:)  I spent a few minutes looking at all the places his guests have arrived from and made my own mark.  I may steal this very clever touch:)"
6134382,46189334,2015-09-08,17272699,Char,Although we didn't get to meet Harry during our stay we felt very welcome in his home. The place was in a great neighbourhood and the room itself was comfortable and spotless! It was exactly what we needed for our quick day trip to Seattle.

Tuvimos un detalle de error de fecha y gracias a Harry no hubo problema, nos apoyó en todo momento.
El barrio es super seguro, bonito, y con muchas opciones para comer.
La casa es muy bonita, cómoda, realmente nos hizo sentir como en casa.
La habitación es más bonita de lo que se ve en la foto, el baño super limpio, te dan facilidad de toallas limpias, así como shapoo y jabón.
Nos apoyaron dando una orientación de los lugares que debíamos ir, en nuestra breve visita a Seattle.
"
6134382,51174580,2015-10-18,2578620,Kevin,"If you plan to visit Seattle, don't hesitate and book with Harry & Rich. House is clean, and decor has a mordern look.  Harry & Rich responded to all my inquiries promptly. They provided great suggestions on restuarants and things to do. My room was clean and the bed was comfy. The neighboorhood is quiet and had that suburb vibe. I did not had any trouble with parking. If I'm back in Seattle, I know who to go to. Thanks Harry and Rich!"
3930681,19489147,2014-09-13,7731455,Eshani,"We had a wonderful stay at Caleb's apartment. Caleb was traveling during our stay, but his neighbor Leah was very responsive and accommodating to our schedule; she seamlessly coordinated our stay. 

The apartment is clean and roomy, and at a great location to explore downtown Seattle. There are many restaurants and bars within walking distance, but the location of the apartment is tucked away into a quiet street, resulting in little noise at night. 

Parking is a bit challenging in the area, but we parked at a nearby garage that was quite affordable. 

Thanks for a great stay!"
3930681,19549931,2014-09-14,5419530,Shawn,Leah was an awesome host!  Very communicative and .  Such a nice place to stay.  Easy walking distance to all the fun that is Capitol Hill!  We will definitely try and stay here again when we are back in Seattle.

3930681,20104216,2014-09-23,20629035,Rebecca,"This was a wonderful place to stay.  Right next to but not on top of Capitol Hill made it quiet but so close to lively city areas.  I really enjoyed staying here because it felt like a home - it felt good to return to after a long day of touring.  It was well lit and comfortable.  Getting to the kitchen through the bathroom or the bedroom added a bit of quirky charm.  Checking in and checking out was a breeze.  I would definitely stay here again.  

The only downside I saw here was the upstairs neighbors played loud bassy music for a while but inside of quiet hours."
3930681,20165653,2014-09-24,18847412,Rick,"Lovely and cozy apartment, neat as a pin and very tastefully decorated. In a very nice neighborhood - close by to restaurants, coffe houses, grocery stores and public transportation.

Extremely comfortable stay and would highly recommend Caleb's apartment for future Airbnb-ers.

3930681,20765681,2014-10-05,20912911,Amelie,"The apartment was fantastic and conveniently located just a quick walk away from downtown. The neighborhood is vibrant with great restaurants and bars, and just off of I-5 for those looking to explore Seattle's surroundings. Leah was wonderful - she checked on us a few times and was super quick to respond to emails. Everything worked out perfectly and I would definitely recommend this apartment for anyone looking to discover Seattle. "
3930681,20883181,2014-10-06,1544767,Drew,"My experience couldn't have been better. The place is amazing, quiet, safe, comfortable and clean. Perfect location, great furniture, beautiful big windows with a ton of natural light. The bathroom is a little outdated and basic but it works and that's all you need.

The check-in process was easy, and Leah was very helpful on our last day, when we had left our luggage with her after checking out and were running late picking it up again. I'd definitely stay here again!"

3930681,21370308,2014-10-15,6158332,Vanessa,The apartment is spacious and in a great area. I appreciated the fact that we had booked last minute and this was no problem at all. 
3930681,21647948,2014-10-20,14021060,Bizzy,Host was friendly met us on time and answered questions as necessary. Apartment was clean and had all the necessities. Comfy bed. 
3930681,21817848,2014-10-24,1696325,Leigh,"Nice little apartment a couple blocks from the Broadway/Harrison hub in Capitol Hill, one of my favorite in the city with lots of restaurants, a grocery store, bars, parks, and lots of people on the weekends. 15 mins walk from Pike- Pine corridor, probably the coolest neighborhood in the city. 

The place was well organized, clean, pleasant. I requested to stay the night of, and was accepted within an hour."
3930681,21952917,2014-10-27,6986005,Caitrin,Caleb and Nina's home is in a perfect location in Capitol Hill. Their home was comfortable and cute and our whole stay was problem free :) Highly recommend.
3930681,22456946,2014-11-07,21378386,Brian,"We had been planning our trip to Seattle for over a year and when we discovered airbnb it definitely stroke us as a great opportunity to experience life as a resident rather than a tourist. Caleb and Nina's place is located in such  a central part of town that it really is hard to beat. Just for that I would've never stayed at a hotel. The space, the convenience and the hospitality are remarkable. We got to meet Leah two times and she gave us recommendations and encouraged us to explore the city. Insights you don't get if you stay somewhere else. It was a very personalized experience. The home was very cozy and beautiful. Overall I highly recommend everyone who visits the city to stay there."
3930681,22655055,2014-11-11,8587964,Sarah,"Leah, Caleb's contact, initiated contact and always replied promptly. The apartment is comfy and cozy. Rooms are large and sunny. Kitchen and bathroom are a little funky, as it is an older apartment. Towels and bathmat could use an update. Location is terrific in a quiet residential area but convenient to shopping and downtown. Great view of the Space Needle from some side streets. You'll get a good feel of the Capitol Hill area. Very accommodating to visitor's schedule."
3930681,22771590,2014-11-14,18282235,Georgia,"Caleb's apartment is perfect. It is centrally located & walking distance to great coffee shops and restaurants. The apartment itself is spacious, well designed and a comfortable place to call home whilst in Seattle. Unfortunately I didn't get to meet Caleb as he was out of town but his neighbor was extremely communicative and helpful. I would definitely recommend this apartment and hopefully stay again!"
3930681,22893186,2014-11-17,9009010,Kelsey,"We had a terrific stay at Caleb's place. It's exactly as described -- clean, sunny, and perfectly located. Leah, who helped us during our stay, is super helpful and easy to communicated with. Highly recommend this sweet, sunny, comfortable spot! "
3930681,23171612,2014-11-24,1523157,Joseph,Everything was great and exactly what we expected. Great place in a great neighborhood. Leah was great in making sure we knew what to expect.
3930681,23870935,2014-12-13,1175971,Ilya,Caleb's place was super nice and clean! Really central to all the fun stuff in Capitol Hill. Thanks for being a great host. 
3930681,24001609,2014-12-16,22800489,Diana,Great space and very easy to find from the freeway. The apartment has a nice kitchen and is in a fun location in Seattle.  
3930681,24062021,2014-12-18,257817,Jeff Lee,"Great place, comfortable and clean. Location is perfect. "
3930681,24118093,2014-12-20,20174130,Brent,"Great experience! Wonderful location, clean, helpful and accommodating. Would highly recommend!"
3930681,24196648,2014-12-22,1877328,Mina,"We couldn't have picked a better place. Checkin was easy and convenient. The location was perfect and parking was never too difficult to find. The place itself was the perfect size for my fiancé and me. Leah was great at communicating with us and answering any questions we had. 

I highly recommend choosing this place; you won't be disappointed!"
3930681,24313280,2014-12-25,7835797,Kevin,"We spent one evening here and it was a good location to some of the restaurants I wanted to visit in Capitol Hill. The place was clean and spacious. There were some books on Japan that I found incredibly interesting. The bed was comfortable and overall a nice experience.

It would have been nice if there was a parking spot available for us. The location was the biggest selling point but I had to park 6 blocks away which didn't make it worth it. 

Leah was really good at responding to our messages and was very accommodating for our stay. She made our check-in and check-out very easy which was appreciated."
3930681,24334908,2014-12-26,17496932,Caspian,"Spacious light-filled apartment in a great location in capital hill. Parking during our stay could be found within a couple of blocks from the property. We didn’t get to meet the host Leah, but found her to be extremely helpful and prompt with communication. We had a special request, which she was able to accommodate for us. "
3930681,24593769,2014-12-31,4717142,Julie,"Amazing place!  Great experience, wonderful house and location.  Very easy to work with and accommodating.  Would come back to visit again.  Thank you!"
3930681,24841348,2015-01-03,23579165,Farbod,"Great home in the middle of an awesome community in Capital Hill. The apartment was well heated, comfortable furniture and easily accessible to everything. This is an ideal spot for a couple who enjoys experiencing everything about Seattle (local feel, downtown attraction and beautiful home decor). I love Seattle and would most definitely stay at this location again on my next visit. "
3930681,24998235,2015-01-04,25464676,Gideon,"Experience was great!  The apartment was beautiful and cozy, and the location was excellent.  I would definitely stay here again."
3930681,25137744,2015-01-07,24337203,Alexander,"We are happy that we stayed in this place for our two nights in Seattle. It felt like home. Other than the linens and the bed, which were crummy and small, respectively, this was a home. The bed was actually a thing. I'm a big guy and had trouble sleeping. My old lady is gonna buy one of the books that she read while she was there. It was that kind of place, along with having a fully stocked kitchen. This was also a bang for it's buck. "
3930681,25360581,2015-01-13,24909058,Christopher,"Our host was great. The instructions were clear, and we had no delays getting into the unit. The unit itself was fantastic, and very comfortable. I have no complaints about any part of my visit or my experience. Huge thank you to the wonderful hosts."
3930681,25567711,2015-01-19,2161607,Jason,"This is a great place to stay: close to plenty of shops and great restaurants. Not far from Broadway. The space is large, but warm and cozy. Our host was responsive and helpful."
3930681,26435131,2015-02-12,10042488,Wyatt,"Had a great short stay at Caleb and Nina's cozy apartment. The arrival and departure was seamless, the place was exactly as advertised, and the neighborhood had plenty to eat, drink, and see within walking distance."
3930681,26514060,2015-02-14,1092364,Noah,"An exceptionally good Airbnb experience. I booked last minute—day of—and the host accepted my request immediately and gave easy, clear instructions on how to get in. The apartment itself is beautiful, really nicely decorated, comfortable, homey. The bed and pillows were very comfortable for me to sleep on. The place is also situated in a great neighborhood—a perfect place to wander around on foot. Glad I chose this place to crash for a night."
3930681,26609515,2015-02-16,3004560,Stephanie,"We enjoyed our stay: beautiful decor, walking distance from a trendy part of town, clean and quiet space. With that said, be prepared to circle for far longer than 15 minutes to find a parking spot, especially on a Friday or Saturday night. If you plan for this, you'll be fine. "
3930681,27968992,2015-03-15,28496187,Christina," The host was away during our stay, but has a nice neighbor who emailed arrangements with us.  She was flexible and helpful.  The place itself was fine, a little basic (i.e., without extras), but pretty much as depicted on the website.  Excellent location.  An offstreet parking spot was a decided plus--especially in this neighborhood.  One downside (which bothered me but not my husband) was an upstairs neighbor who favored a heavy bass track on his stereo, or perhaps a drumming track, that he played at night.
The rating system doesn't seem to accept half stars, but I'd give it 3.5 stars."
3930681,28105538,2015-03-17,5776788,Drew,"Staying at Caleb's place felt like staying at home. It was cozy, clean and super convenient. Basically, everything I needed was within walking distance. The pictures are accurate. 

I never met Caleb in person but he was always quick to respond to texts and very accommodating. I have a few more trips to the area coming up and this will be my first choice. "
3930681,28446405,2015-03-23,247238,Kate,"Caleb's place was fabulous and the location is perfect.  It's a beautiful neighborhood and easy to get to other parts of the city from there.  It's within walking distance of lots of great restaurants, bars, coffee shops and little shops.  It was really a pleasure having Caleb's place as a home base.  I couldn't have been happier.  And his neighbor, who helps arrange the stay, was very accommodating, friendly, and helpful.  I would stay there again in a heartbeat.  Oh, and the light in the apartment is beautiful.  "
3930681,30487311,2015-04-22,20959234,Maddie,"We did a very last minute trip and Caleb/Leah was so accommodating. The apartment was cute, clean and right in the middle of the action on capital hill. We had a great time!"
3930681,30586974,2015-04-24,1015943,Greg,"Nice place in a great location.  Excellent communication.  Quiet, yet easy walking distance to Capital Hill restaurants and bars.  I look forward to coming back and staying again."
3930681,38436230,2015-07-15,36573124,Michaela,"The place was very nice and looked exactly like the pictures. It was in a great location and I couldn't have been more happy about it. Unfortunately, I did not get to meet Caleb but his neighbor, Leah, was amazing. She was very helpful and all of her instructions were clear and easy to follow. I would totally stay here again. "
3930681,38551084,2015-07-16,14106268,Becky,"Where to start?! First off the location is prime, walking distance from so many bars and restaurants. Although I did t get to meet Caleb and Nina, their place is sooooo lovely and SUPER CLEAN. They have all the amenities a traveler needs.  This is such a lovely gem. I will be staying there again next time I'm in Seattle. 

Thank you guys so sharing your home with me. 

"
3930681,38642997,2015-07-17,36011253,Abdulrahman,The apartment was spacious and clean. The artwork in the place is beautiful. The area was close to everything. Leah was very helpful with the instructions. Thank you Caleb and Nina for allowing me to stay. I'll be back!
3930681,38760620,2015-07-18,35911202,Hazel,"This was our first ever airbnb experience, what a pleasure to have Leah available on site for any questions we might have.  Everything was exactly how it appeared on the website, check in was seamless and the location ideal.  Lovely sunny, warm, clean apartment would love to stay here again. "
3930681,39089406,2015-07-20,10373993,George,"It was a comfortable stay. Apartment was true to advertised and clean. Hosts were very communicative and helpful. Neighborhood is fantastic. Lots of retail, restaurants and bars within just a few blocks. "
3930681,44247915,2015-08-24,3631283,David,"Leah, Caleb's neighbor, was handling requests while Caleb and Nina were out of town. She responded to our request quickly even though it was late at night. When we told her we would use the couch, she said would provide an extra set of sheets, pillow, and blanket. Timing was such that we were arriving just as Leah was leaving, so she showed us around. Apartment looked exactly as in pictures. It's an older place, but was very clean and conveniently located. Capitol Hill can be difficult for finding parking, but the unit's parking spot was available which was great. We only stayed one night, but given the value of this place, we wouldn't hesitate to stay here again."
5078244,29589234,2015-04-09,1725749,Julien,"When I'll go back to Seattle, I'll stay for sure at Alberto's place. He's such a nice host! "
5078244,29884715,2015-04-13,29905947,Donavan,"The neighbourhood was fine. However we didn't really get to see the neighbourhood. But for the price, this is a steal! :)"
5078244,30113047,2015-04-17,1503536,Tjark,"Alberto was a very nice and helpful host. The room in his apartment is not very large but sufficient if you only need a place to crash during the night. However, you get what you pay for.. The kitchen and the restroom could be cleaner though. "
5078244,31499621,2015-05-05,10106464,Adelaide,"Le logement correspond bien à la description. Nous étions proche du centre-ville en bus. Alberto est sympathique et accueillant.
Le matelas n'est pas très confortable et en effet, cela pourrait être plus propre. Mais pour 40€ à Seattle c'est un bon rapport qualité prix."
5078244,31754851,2015-05-09,30848420,Louise,"Alberto was a very friendly and welcoming host! Clean and nice apartment, great location in a nice area!"
5078244,31991893,2015-05-12,7517588,Karen,Alberto was very welcoming and accomodating when we arrived earlier than expected. We were easily able to park and buses were only a 5-10 min walk so we had that option too. The sofa bed is comfy and the accomodation was all we had hoped for. Alberto was available to answer questions if we needed but also gave us space and privacy. Thank you Alberto. 
5078244,32558684,2015-05-19,27227618,Darrin,"Alberto was a perfect host. This is a perfect crash pad for anyone who wants to take in the city all day and get a good night's rest to do it all over again the next day. Neighborhood was awesome. It's a straight shot for about 20 blocks to downtown, with easy bus access too! Will definitely stay again when I decide to return."
5078244,32726487,2015-05-20,30848420,Louise,"Second time I stayed at Alberto, he is a great host!"
5078244,33143311,2015-05-25,23823260,Emilio,Alberto was a great host! He gave us great recommendations and spend a lovely night playing chess and drinking sake
5078244,34319662,2015-06-07,32841770,Michael,Alberto made us feel very welcomed when we arrived. He allowed us to come a little earlier to check in an drop off our luggage. His neighborhood is very nice and quiet and is close to downtown. He was very knowledgeable about the area and different things to do in the Seattle area. I would stay at Alberto's place again when I'm in the Seattle area. 
5078244,34605525,2015-06-09,7485789,Julian,"This was a very good deal for the price. Very close to Capitol Hill and the International District. Alberto was very nice. The apartment is cleaned to... bachelor standards, which I didn't mind, but fussier people might. I liked the place."
5078244,34834185,2015-06-12,2072215,Sonia,"Great host! had an interesting conversation with Alberto in the evening. He made our stay very easy. Nice, quiet location, easy reach to downtown with constant public transportation. Alberto is 100 % recommended"
5078244,35227590,2015-06-16,27074776,Christian & Joyce,Alberto was super helpful and easy to deal with. The neighborhood was nice and it was easy to get around. the room was fin and the place was clean.  
5078244,35317884,2015-06-17,14128312,Inge And Jannes,Place is ok if you stay only for one night.
5078244,35683136,2015-06-21,30241184,Marion,"Alberto nous a très bien accueilli. Facile à joindre via l'application avant/pendant notre séjour. Son appartement est bien situé, calme,  équipé comme décrit dans l'annonce, propre. Nous avons apprécié notre séjour à Seattle et la gentillesse d'Alberto."
5078244,36197270,2015-06-26,11262376,Ellen,Alberto was very welcoming.  Room was fine and just as advertised.  A very big plus to have  such an economical place to stay so close to downtown.
5078244,36415578,2015-06-28,33531614,Wilson,The host made us feel welcome by introducing himself and touring us around the apartment. The listing description was accurate and the neighbourhood was great! It was close to where we were visiting.
5078244,37002773,2015-07-03,7098310,Matthew,Had a good stay with Alberto. Friendly and the apartment is clean. I stayed for 1 night (which is his minimum as of when searched and booked). After booking he said he doesn't normally accept 1 night stays and prefers two or more. Listing needs to be updated of his preferences. Other than that I had a good stay. 
5078244,37998854,2015-07-12,28036898,Tom,"Alberto made me feel very welcome and took the time to show me around parts of the city. He's a great host and a friendly guy. The room has a sofa bed and is comfortable and clean, there's a bus stop right outside the apartment building so you can be downtown in 20 minutes."
5078244,38313420,2015-07-14,36104926,Maximilian,Alberto is a very nice and welcoming host. His apartment is in a nice area and not far from downtown. I would totally recommend his place!

5078244,39021454,2015-07-20,34016106,Urszula,"Alberto was a nice host, room was OK, and there was no problems. Transport to city was close, and convenient. Thanks Alberto for having us."
5078244,39948684,2015-07-27,35447503,Heejun,Thankyou alberto
5078244,40352406,2015-07-30,37198236,Jenny,"The house condition was not up to our expectation. We wish it was cleaner, larger, and better location, but owner is willing to offer refund immediately after we expressed our concern."
5078244,40695241,2015-08-01,33995613,Tommy,"Good experience, great price. Would recommend. "
5078244,44619479,2015-08-27,25052546,Devon,Alberto had us to stay very last minute and was more than accommodating. There are a couple bus stops right outside which makes things really straight forward for getting into the city. Would recommend! 
5078244,45103647,2015-08-31,38416333,Danny,"Had a wonderful stay with Alberto. My friend and I were out most of the time, so we didn't get to know Alberto too well.  However, he was welcoming upon arrival, and respected our privacy when we were staying in the room. If you are looking for a place to crash at night after a full day out exploring Seattle, look no further than this private room.  The bus stop in front of the apartment is very convenient. "
5078244,46487732,2015-09-11,3770335,Sheila,"This is a cheap, clean private room in a good location. Alberto was easy to coordinate with. We recommend this rental. "
5078244,46752486,2015-09-13,32048345,Nicholas,"The information and listing details were accurate. However, host stated that it is a flexible time check in. But a day before, i was told that im not allowed to check in before 6pm.

Of cause i wasnt happy about it and, in the end it was worked out and i was able to still check in on my desirable time.

After checking in. The room was in a MESS! Bed sheets that were given to me by the host was dirty and filled with hair. I double confirmed with the host, and he claims that its washed and cleaned.

The bathroom condition was bad too. Bath tub was slippery and not cleaned.

But still have to thank the host for the effort to allow me to check in on my desirable time. "
5078244,47014656,2015-09-14,1970307,Michelle,"Alberto was very friendly and accommodating. His place is quite cozy and tidy. We felt very welcome, our stay was reminiscent to crashing at a friends place. The sofa bed is a little creeky, as a heavy sleeper I was fine, but my friend woke up a few times.  Overall I would recommend it for an affordable place to stay."
5078244,47217504,2015-09-16,40816721,Krystal,"If you're looking for a cheap and safe place to stay in Seattle, that is exactly what you'll get here. Don't expect much more."
5078244,47331864,2015-09-17,44101591,Amit,Simple living and easy stay
5078244,47407320,2015-09-18,24300824,Bong,"Host is nice. However, just a little bit late check in. It was say 6pm check in but end up 9pm for me to check in. The bed sheet is not really clean and wondering hasn't wash from previous guest. Bathroom is not really clean and full of trash in the dustbin. Kitchen is messy too. Personally, I'm not recommended unless you really prefer for a cheaper price that's it."
5078244,48395122,2015-09-26,39895073,Dominik,"Good location, easy free-parking on the road, nice host, no problem that we checked in late (9pm)."
5078244,48659070,2015-09-27,44951777,Amrita,"The neighborhood is good and well connected to downtown. If the room was a bit more cleaner, it would have been a great stay. I appreciate Alberto's quick response to emails. "
5078244,48973202,2015-09-29,3203676,Owen,"Big thanks for allowing me to check in at 2:30am after my travel was significantly delayed!! Lesser hosts would have said no. Nice guy, good communication, accurate listing, everything was fine and the location was good value too."
5078244,49642813,2015-10-05,2392876,D M,"We enjoyed our stay with Alberto very much. He was extremely accommodating, allowing us to check in early and leave late. We didn't see too much of him (as we were out all day, every day), but when we did see him, he was always very friendly.

The apartment has a very convenient location with a bus stop right in front of the building--and the ride to downtown is only 15-20 minutes. 

We slept well (although the mattress is a bit soft), and it was very quiet. And we loved being able to make breakfast in the kitchen, and leave a few items in the refrigerator.

All in all, it was an excellent experience."
5078244,49863573,2015-10-06,8554626,Terry Logan,It was easy to check in.
5078244,49965816,2015-10-07,45943039,Vasyl,"Big thanks for Alberto, everything was good a great location at a great price!!"
5078244,50150815,2015-10-09,33929287,Jonathan,"Alberto is a busy man, yet he made me feel at home.  His is a great location at a great price.  Yet, more importantly, I did not feel like a ""guest"" in his home."
5078244,50363558,2015-10-11,44608321,Marjorie,Alberto was really nice. The room is as described and only 10 minutes away from downtown by bus.
5078244,50805046,2015-10-14,44625751,Chun-Chieh,"We really have a great time in Seattle~
And Alberto gave us everything we want. And made us feel welcome! The room is as described. Small but good enough."
5078244,51258892,2015-10-18,26494579,Jack,"Alberto was very helpful and welcoming, even though we only contacted him last minute due to a cancellation.

5078244,51463017,2015-10-20,44643680,Maria,Alberto fue correcto en el trato
5078244,51672197,2015-10-22,35467145,Erin,"Alberto was very courteous and hospitable. Apartment has plenty of available street parking nearby, and food and drink within walking distance.  Neighborhood was close to other areas of the city."
5078244,52129400,2015-10-26,45314432,John,"Alberto was very friendly and accommodating, even to the point of loaning me a couple of things I'd neglected to pack. His apartment is small but very clean, orderly and quiet. The apartment faces the small parking lot in back of the building, not the street. You get your own room, as opposed to crashing in somebody's living room with a curtain divider. The fold-a-bed couch was more comfortable to sleep on than I'd expected. Public transit access is good: a 2-minute walk to frequent bus connections to downtown and the Metro (12 minutes), U. of Washington (25 minutes), etc."

5078244,54751984,2015-11-23,47808568,Eike,Small but adequate room in a quiet surroundings. Bus takes you in 15min to downtown. Alberto was friendly and had towels and bedding for US. I would recommend this to someone who looks for a cheap place to stay

788146,3067285,2012-12-11,831531,Robin,"We had a great time in Seattle, and Sedora and the Art House were a big part of our great experience. Sedora was beyond accommodating helping us navigating the transportation system, getting to know the city and even giving us a ride in a pinch. 
It was also fun to be in the Columbia City area of the city. It is a very cool part of Seattle with great restaurants (that Sedora had good recommendations for) a fun destination.
The Art house was creative and fun, as well as warm and welcoming.
We enthusiastically give Sedora and the Art House the highest recommendations.
"
788146,4332327,2013-04-28,6104817,Charles,"I really enjoyed staying with Sedora!  She was super kind and welcoming.  She is also a world traveller!   Her house is comfortable and spacious.  The room was well-lit and clean, as was the bathroom.  In short, I highly recommend staying with Sedora for your stay in Seattle.  "
788146,4921137,2013-06-02,5974611,Mark,"The Art house and its host, Sedora, are wonderful!  I stayed for 28 days while relocating back to Seattle, the space is great.  Very conveniently located to light rail (a bit of a hike) and the great restaurants / community of Columbia City, this is a great location.  In addition to the location, the room is very spacious and comfortable.  Sedora is a wonderful hostess and made me feel extremely welcome.  Highly recommend staying here if/when you're visiting Seattle."
788146,5120361,2013-06-13,1777675,Shelia,"Sedora was an excellent hostess and I'm really looking forward to going back to Seattle to see her.  I love her area and her house location is easy to find. I highly recommend her house as a fun Seattle stop-over. The room is spacious and the house is clean and cozy.  Her garden is thriving, welcoming and perfect for a personal retreat."
788146,5166433,2013-06-16,4574795,Onyi,"I have nothing but great things to say about Sedora! She is the perfect host and just a great person to be around. Her place is a really cute and neat unit that makes you feel at home. She clearly has an eye for creativity and this comes through beautifully in her house through eclectic artwork, decorations, etc. I could go on forever but I will simply say that I almost cancelled my train to Portland to stay and hang out longer. My time in Seattle couldn't have been any better!"
788146,5216185,2013-06-18,6591949,Betsy,Sedora's room was very comfortable and everything we needed was provided. We had had use of a lovely sitting room downstairs and her kitchen. Sedora is a very interesting and gracious host. We had a lovely time staying with her.
788146,5333308,2013-06-24,6968823,Tiffany,"I had a fantastic stay with Sedora and her cat Bijou! The house is lovely, clean, and welcoming. I enjoyed siting in the back garden so much. Sedora was a lovely host and I am so thankful to have met her! She was a perfect, unobtrusive host, but as I was traveling alone I enjoyed her company very much on a hike through Seward Park followed by yummy ice cream. Columbia City is a really fun and diverse neighborhood; I hope to return to explore it more! Thank you Sedora!"
788146,5514718,2013-07-03,322736,James,"Sedora was a fabulous host. She is thoughtful, fun, and flexible. She let me check in early even though I arrived at 8:30am, and showed me around the area. We chatted a lot since we had a lot in common. Also, her cat is adorable. I really enjoyed staying at her house."
788146,5819294,2013-07-17,3436616,Josephine,"Sedona was a wonderful host. From the time I arrived Sedora made me feel completely at home. I had a fantastic time and extended my stay as there was so much to see and enjoy in Seattle and in the district where Sedora lives. Its a short busntrip into downtown, and its on the light rail link so its easy to get to from Seatac airport. there are lovely walks or bike ride down to Seward Park. i could not recommend Sedoras place highly enough and I am definitely going back!"
788146,5875082,2013-07-20,3250071,Karina,"Sedora was a wonderful host and is a lovely person. Her home is a reflection of her hospitality and generosity. It's also a clean, tidy, and comfortable place. I felt welcomed. Couldn't have asked for more. I'm looking forward to my next stay with Sedora; I believe you will, too."
788146,5905659,2013-07-22,333010,Helen,"Sedora was a lovely host - friendly, warm, and flexible to our arrival/departure times. Though we were only there for one night, she made us feel welcome and we felt at home, rather than strangers in someone else's house.  Her home was clean, cozy, and comfortable and just a short walk from restaurants, cafes, and delicious ice cream. Thanks again!"
788146,6053514,2013-07-28,3794337,Leena,"Sedora is a warm and welcoming and generous host...like visiting with an old friend!

The rom is large and light and airy and quiet with a shared bathroom which posed no problem.

5 minute walk to small neighborrhood with amazing bakery and good restaurants.

Very centrally located"
788146,6255065,2013-08-05,7581646,Kevin,"Sedora was a kind and thoughtful host. Can hold a conversation but can also give space.  Her home is warm and colorful - lots of art - and the room was very spacious, comfortable and quiet.  The backyard, which I only ventured into and lounged once because I was usually out and about, was relaxing and reminded me of a book cover of a Gabriel Garcia Marquez novel.  It's a 5-minute walk to shops and cafes and Seward Park, which is about a 2 3/4 mile perimeter peninsula jutting out into Lake Washington, is an absolutely awesome place to run along the shore or hike.  Thanks Sedora!"
788146,6492348,2013-08-14,6794251,Paul,"This was my first AirBnB experience.  It was GREAT because of Sedora.  Really cool house and garden.  The tomatoes are SWEET and Sedora shares!.   

The room is upstairs and the bathroom is (theoretically) shared but we were the only ones to use it while we were in the house.
Both the room and bed were comfortable.

Sedora went out of her way to get local info for us - she even researched bike availability for us before we got there.  (Think twice before biking in Seattle - you will know what I mean when you see the hills.)    

The location was perfect and Seward Park is just a short distance away (1 mile).  Swimming, hiking, picnicing  nature walks etc.

Sedora gets 5 stars from us!"
788146,6690633,2013-08-21,7421856,Rebecca,Sedora was a lovely host and a was very easy to be around. The city was easily accessible through the nearby mass transit systems. Columbia City is a really neat neighborhood with a cute strip of stores and eateries that display the diversity of the area. I'd definitely stay here again.
788146,6773730,2013-08-24,8292611,Chris,Sedora was a wonderful host.  The house was amazing.  It was an extremely positive experience and we loved the neighborhood!  I would highly recommend this place to everyone.
788146,6849687,2013-08-27,7332753,Yuko,"I booked Sedora's place for my brother, who was coming in to town from Japan to attend my wedding.  when I sent the inquiry, Sedora responded very quickly, and the booking experience was very smooth.  Sedora is very friendly, and her house is gorgeous!  I was jealous of my brother who gets to stay in such a beautiful home full of arts.  Sedora also shared vegetables from her garden.  She was very flexible with my brother accessing her kitchen and bathrooms etc.  My brother had a wonderful and relaxing stay!  Thank you Sedora."
788146,7039996,2013-09-04,7848221,Susie,"We had a great stay off the beaten path.  Very economical stay even though had several wedding functions downtown.  The bus stop is a short few blocks away and cost $2.25 to ride to downtown, but does take about 30 minutes for the ride. Very accessible from SeaTac via the light rail-stop is .9 miles away (we walked even though Sedora offered to pick us up)  Don't miss Seward Park and pizza at Tutta Bella in Columbus City, both an easy walk away.  Very quiet and private. We had use of the kitchen and enjoyed preparing dinner from the Farmer's Market."

788146,7426798,2013-09-19,6815436,Manuela,"Sedora's lovely house is exactly as pictured. The bed room is spacious and the bed is very comfortable. Sendora is hospitable and very easy and interesting to talk. And made me feel very much at home...We had also dinner together, great walk and I really loved talking about the differences between our countries in front of her fire place.

Downtown and airport are easy to arrive by public transport.

Easygoing & highly recommendable. Thanks for making my stay so comfortable."
788146,7549646,2013-09-24,7459377,Satchaphan,"It was a real pleasure to stay at Sedora's even for just 2 nights. She is a very sweet and accommodating host. 
The house is warm and cosy with a beautiful garden. The room is large and clean.
I felt very much at home and would like to thank Sedora for her genuine hospitality."
788146,8177055,2013-10-19,147046,David,"Staying with Sedora is a great example of Airbnb at it’s best -- making social connections that lead to incredible travel experiences.  I felt so welcome in her beautiful home, so comfortable and relaxed.  The location of her home is excellent -- close to the light rail and bus stops, an excellent natural foods market, and to the amazing Seward Park.  Very clean, very quiet, and a welcome respite from any amount of dark clouds and rain that Seattle may present to you.  Her cat, Bijou, was also delightfully well mannered and allowed me to brush her and give her kitty treats as well :-)  I am thankful to Sedora for all of her kindness and generosity, and for the wonderful environment she created that made my stay in Seattle so memorable..."
788146,13692529,2014-06-02,15350158,Barb,"Sedora made my stay in Seattle seamless. She responded promptly to emails, went above and beyond to provide assistance with getting around and where to go for anything I needed. Her home is super welcoming and comfortable, and she has the best cat in the world. "
788146,21826944,2014-10-25,2013451,Mary Lee,Sedora is a wonderful Host. Her house has an never-ending plethora of eye treats. Her kitty Bijou was fun to pet and cuddle. My room and bed was very comfy. Lovely view. I especially loved that I could use her kitchen and store my food. My daughter was only .6 mile away on the same street and there was plenty of room to park my borrowed car. Thanks again Sedora for sharing your lovely and interesting space with a fellow traveler.
1069562,26122447,2015-02-03,873645,Annemarie,"Allison was a superb host.  She was very accommodating, leaving us clear and detailed instructions and a very thoughtful card, gift and guide books. Her home was very clean and comfortable. We felt like we were at are own home, enjoying music, wine, and great books. My girlfriend and I would hands down recommend Allison's place to anyone visiting Seattle. 

We certainly will book again the next time we are visiting! "
