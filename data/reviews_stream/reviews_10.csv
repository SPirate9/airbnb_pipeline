2297917,45027259,2015-08-30,15776344,Danny,"Awesome place to stay! It was clean, stylish and homie. Close to everything, takes about 10 min to get to downtown Seattle.  "
2297917,45092471,2015-08-31,10286341,Lena,"This is a lovely little space, perfect for a couple, or a small family looking for a quiet place to settle in. There's a full kitchen and a great patio out back. Donna was in touch right away when we had an issue come up, but we never felt any intrusion on privacy."
2297917,45781761,2015-09-06,2869409,Tamar Naomi,Donna was a wonderful host and communicated extremely well! I was able to obtain information easily on how to get settled in the apartment and found the place with no problems. The apartment itself is just as advertised. Very cozy and comfortable! Would certainly recommend this for people visiting family or friends in Northern Seattle.
2297917,47077716,2015-09-15,6336023,James,"What a great place!  Warm and cozy, yet spacious, with all the amenities.  This was our second time staying here, and we plan on using it in the future."
2297917,47537670,2015-09-20,25656872,Jen,"How do I love Carkeek Retreat? Let me count the ways. 1) Beautifully appointed down to the smallest detail; 2) Gorgeous color scheme throughout; 3) soft lighting; 4) heated floors in the bathroom; 5) fireplace with remote; 6) day bed in the window...perfect for well whatever; 7) quiet & private; 8) did Donna mention Carkeek Park is quite literally steps away?; 9) cozy but not small; 10) full kitchen; 11) 1/2 mile from groceries, coffee, drug store, breakfast places, etc.; 12) queer and trans awesome; and 13) nicest Airbnb I've stayed in yet...and I'm picky. Fantastic place. "
2297917,47909112,2015-09-21,25484821,Cassi,"The bathtub!!!!! And the heated floor tiles!! So amazing. Really lovely host--very kind ...also, super close to greenwood ave (great coffee shops and places to snack and hang)"
2297917,48708005,2015-09-28,40113039,Jessica,"The Carkeek Retreat was a perfect place for my new husband and I to stay the night of our wedding at Carkeek Park, right next door! Thank you, Donna, for providing a beautiful, private space for us. The location was so convenient for us, it could not have been better."
2297917,49273268,2015-10-02,15880952,Daniel,"Really beautiful space, highly recommend it!"
2297917,51475028,2015-10-20,269798,Blair,"Fantastic rental!  My parents were visiting and this lovely apartment is in our neighborhood.  They loved everything about it -- the front room with cozy fireplace, the heated bathroom floors, the very comfortable bed (and they are picky!), the open feeling and view to the beautiful back garden.  Will definitely use Carkeek Retreat again for out of town visitors, it's ideal!"
5325809,27372678,2015-03-02,22348499,Hanzhe,We had a very amazing stay in this amazing place. It is a great fit for a family to stay. Quiet rooms and nice kitchen are really suit for family to live with. We enjoyed our stay!
5325809,28610766,2015-03-27,3694418,Julie,"A BIG thank you to Michelle for providing an awesome place to stay in while my family of four visited Seattle for the week! We are first time Airbnbers (is that a word?) and were nervous booking for the first time. I have to say that even before our arrival my nerves were calmed because of the excellent communication with Michelle. She was quick to respond to my questions and eager to help in any way she could. Once we arrived to the townhouse the butterflies were completely gone after opening the door. Clean, cute, cozy and comfortable! You felt like you were in a home, but not in a place that you had to see much of the other persons stuff. It was great!The parking space was a bonus for our car rental too. There is a bus stop down a lil hill that you can easily find and the neighborhood is a nice one to walk around in. No worries at all. We would definitely stay here again and recommend it to all to book. Very happy visitors! Oh, and we left a flower vase for you to fill! Make sure you buy at least a small bouquet of flowers that are available all over the city. Beatutiful…enjoy your stay!"
5325809,29428796,2015-04-07,29105452,Jeroneka,Amazing! Thank you
5325809,29783835,2015-04-12,2440463,Connie,Michelle was very kind and organized. The apartment was in perfect conditions and she answered everything question on time. I would highly recommend this choice! It's not so close to town but it's ok if you have a car!
5325809,32606120,2015-05-19,2147655,Linda & Chris,"We're very pleased with our stay at Michele's. It is exactly as stated in the description. Location is great, close to some local attractions. Great food around the area as well. Michele has been quite prompt in responding to any questions that we had. All in all, we're quite satisfied with our stay there. "
5325809,34023779,2015-06-03,26700866,Andi,"I loved staying at Michele's townhome! It was adorable, comfortable, and had everything we needed. My friends and I loved using the Bluetooth speaker and watching Netflix in the living room. The neighborhood is cute and very conveniently located. Michele was a great host and made sure we had everything we needed. Would definitely recommend and would love to stay here again next time I'm in Seattle! "
5325809,34937952,2015-06-14,28529444,Heidi,"We truly enjoyed our stay at Michele's townhouse.  It was so comfortable for a group of five and very close to the University of Washington, so we had a quick trip to the graduation ceremonies.  The directions were very clear and the townhouse was as adorable as it looked in the pictures.  My father who does not like to stay in hotels, was thrilled to have such a nice place.  We really enjoyed our first experience with booking a place on AirBnB and couldn't have picked a better place to start.  Thank you Michele."
5325809,35500501,2015-06-19,2662396,Alison,The blinds and windows were open so it made us feel welcomed. The place was bright and airy. The house was exactly was described and meet our expectation.
5325809,36205785,2015-06-26,29579505,Deanna,Thanks Michele! Great directions and info on how to check in ourselves.The  townhouse was fabulous  very clean great space. Kitchen had everything we needed for cooking. The area is close to all the downtown attractions it made it very easy to get around the city. Nice restaurants close by also. The beds were comfortable and area is quiet. It made our trip much more enjoyable than staying at a hotel we would definitely stay here again on our next trip to seattle. Thanks again !
5325809,36671223,2015-06-30,20997395,Herbram,"It is adorable, inside is neat and clean, we can find everything we expect to find at home. Its located on quiet neighborhood but very close to bus stop (200 mtrs)

Me and wife happy with kitchen, microwave, oven, coffe maker, even coffe grinder all works and at our disposal. My boys (8 and 17) are happy with netflix (well, they fight over remote).

Check-in was easy, michele give clear guide how to get there. We arrive very late at night, michele has all light on and everything ready for our arrival."
5325809,37780900,2015-07-10,31556791,Chris,"Michele is a fantastic hostess, great communication and the property was wonderful, perfect  for our needs. I would recommend it highly."
5325809,38049856,2015-07-12,29630768,Marco,"Michele was great! She is super flexible and makes her home very welcoming. The location is awesome as well and not far from all the attractions, the best of all is Seattle is super easy to navigate making getting to her location simple. Definitely would recommend this stop. "
5325809,39732234,2015-07-26,5308427,Dina,"Adorable is an appropriate description, and the neighborhood is very quiet.  Plenty of room for four adults, even though the 2nd bedroom has just a twin bed.  Initially surprised there was no air conditioning, but soon realized it's really not needed!  Coming from the very hot/humid Midwest, the Seattle summer weather was refreshing.  We used Uber drivers all week, and every single one of them was punctual, polite, and helpful.  A plus when you have elderly parents with you.  Michele was great from the very beginning, and stayed in touch as needed.  The keyless lock on the door was a feature that was really helpful.  Seattle is beautiful, vibrant, and has something for everyone."
5325809,40851720,2015-08-02,39717354,Scott,"Michele was wonderful and friendly to work with! She made us feel absolutely at home with this gorgeous townhouse. We had a slight miscommunication and Michele refunded 1 nights stay immediately, and without hesitation. I would definitely stay here again."
5325809,44680984,2015-08-28,2749844,Anton,"Had a great stay, house is just as described - clean, comfortable and in a good location. Enjoyed our stay very much."
5325809,45098734,2015-08-31,36128068,Emily,"We didn't meet Michele in person but she was extremely responsive when we needed to get in touch and were arriving to the area.  There was a power-outage in the area due to wind storms, and she sent us the information without hesitation and fortunately it was back on that evening.  We were comfortable, and enjoyed our stay.  There was some dog or cat hair around the apartment, but otherwise it was clean. The dishes were accessible and the appliances all worked! Happy with this stay."
5325809,47047901,2015-09-15,8107156,James,"Michele’s townhouse was every bit as nice as promised and beyond. It was very inviting and spotlessly clean with plenty of room to relax. We found the location, in a very nice, quiet residential area, to be great and appreciated the assigned parking spot in back. The spaces are exactly as pictured and everything works. Having the laundry inside the house was especially handy. We had a great vacation and hope to stay here again when we return to Seattle!"
5325809,47669338,2015-09-21,32907193,Tanya,"I had an enjoyable stay at Michelle's house and would recommend her house to anyone looking for a clean house with all amenities in perfect working order. 
Thank you! "
5325809,48694947,2015-09-28,16601078,Mahdi,Amazing house. Great neighborhood. A short drive to great nightlife and University of Washington. House was clean and included plenty of utensils. The host will e-mail you with all the info you'd need. 
5325809,49320100,2015-10-03,19834903,Kim,We enjoyed our stay at Michele's place had a couple problems with the water in the tub backing up and when we ran the dishwasher the water backed up into the sink I let Michele know about this and she said she would have someone look at it other than that we basically just used the place to sleep at as we were in town to visit our kids.
5325809,50704473,2015-10-13,5224931,Joseph,"Charming townhouse in a great neighborhood. Location is nearby majority of Seattle’s local attractions, shops, restaurants, night life entertainment and major freeways.  The house was clean and provided all the needed amenities as well as a designated parking space.  

Michelle was a great host and was highly responsive to all inquiries and questions that we had about the property.

I would definitely stay again and highly recommend this property to those looking to visit Seattle. We enjoyed our stay very much.
"
5325809,55438797,2015-12-01,4825415,Ravi,"We really enjoyed staying here. It's quite comfortable! We cook a lot, and the range & oven is brand new & gas, which makes me happy. It's winter here, and the apartment is warm & well insulated. The apartment comes with a parking spot & cable, so it's very nice. "

5673552,30740955,2015-04-26,4996653,Linda,"So very perfect for us, this lovely loft! We were in Seattle for less than 48 hrs, and were hanging with family and friends almost all of the time, but this place is SO awesome, I wanted to move in! ;) And I live in a national scenic area in The Cascades of The PNW, on forest land that is deeply sacred & beautiful to me; land I give my soul to, that enriches my life beyond measure.
This lovely loft has a personality. I'm an painter & not a writer, but let me continue on by saying this: it is clean, arty, organized, resides in a great neighborhood, & belongs to organized, friendly hosts. While we did not meet them, we communicated back & forth, & felt very welcomed, while at the same time getting the personal space we always seem to need when traveling. 
Thank you, Brittney, for everything. And, thank you for the extras, like the wine! We brought a couple bottles & micros to share w/fam, but as usual, that all got gone very fast, so it was nice to come back ""home"" to the loft & to a bottle of ""drinkable now"" red. 
Having adventured quite a bit, for such a hip place, I must comment on the bed (yeah; I realize I'm showing my age here). The bed was wonderfully firm & very cozy comfortable. This loft was so very well equipped for our purposes. As world adventurers that visit the great Fremont/Ballard area of Seattle often, we're so delighted to have found this beautiful, well-loved loft in downtown Fremont! We hope to be back soon & will happily recommend it to friends & family."
5673552,32579738,2015-05-19,8652608,Ed,"Brittney's place is great! Our group of 4 spent 3 nights in Seattle (first time for all), and were very pleased with the location in Fremont as a base for our activities. The place is on nice urban neighborhood corner with light traffic, but is less than a 5 minute walk from awesome shops, coffee, food, and some bars (fremont brewing was really good). The bus stop was also only a 5 minute walk away, and it will get you right downtown to pike place market in about 20 minutes. The place was really unique being in an old store front, the perfect open space for a small group or couple (late night games of foosball were fun). Place was very clean. Even better were Brittney's notes and tips on things to do (very professionally laminated/put together) and to top it all off she left us two bottles of wine! Brittney made a solid effort to be a professional host. If you like hip neighborhoods, a nice helpful host, and are looking for a unique place to stay, I definitely recommend this place. "
5673552,33142027,2015-05-25,31155381,Amanda,"Brittney's loft in Fremont is fabulous!  I would recommend the loft and the location to anyone looking to have a fun and adventurous vacation in Seattle.  We were a group of three girls and it was plenty of room for us. The loft is decorated beautifully and is such a unique space. It was also extremely clean and organized. We thoroughly enjoyed not only the accommodations but also the neighborhood, which has fantastic restaurants, cafes and bars within walking distance.  There is also a beautiful running path by the canal which is easily accessible from the loft.  Brittney made us feeling extremely welcome and provided various comforts we weren't expecting like wine, snacks and toiletries. She left us maps and an awesome restaurant/bar resource book as well. She was also very easy to get in touch with to arrange the key exchange and the check out process.  Can't say enough wonderful things about this experience :) Thank you Brittney!"
5673552,34338288,2015-06-07,16324244,Timory,"Absolutely beautiful industrial loft that was so homey and comfortable! The surrounding area is full of tons of fun stuff to do, great restaurants, bars, coffee shops, and all within easy walking distance. Brittney was very helpful and easy to get in contact with when I had questions. She also provided lots of little things to make the stay even easier. It took my husband and myself no time at all to feel like (and wish) this was our home. He would also like me to add that the internet is great :)"
5673552,35186947,2015-06-15,10713190,Patrick,Brittney's studio is so amazingly open and cozy at the same time! Checkin went smoothly and she had great recommendations for local fun. Very quick to communicate and 10/10 would stay here again.
5673552,35806305,2015-06-22,32924140,Andrew,"Loft was great - very clean, comfortable and well-equipped.  Host made everything very easy and made herself available in case she was needed (which she wasn't).  Fremont is a great part of Seattle, close to downtown, but with it's own unique, interesting character.  Loft is on a nice street in a convenient location within easy walking distance of downtown Fremont.  This was our first Airbnb rental and we were a bit nervous, but this turned out to be a great alternative to a first class hotel. We would definitely stay here again. "
5673552,37148692,2015-07-05,30421491,Izzy,"Brittney was an excellent host and communicator she quickly responded to each inquiry with professional and thorough information.   Her tastefully designed loft is centrally located in the Fremont area and walking distance to many great places.  She left us thoughtful amenities, crispy clean sheets and plenty of fluffy towels.  I recommend staying in Brittney's care if you are traveling to Fremont."
5673552,40950366,2015-08-03,37275407,Evan,"Brittney was an amazing host!  She was always quick to respond to any questions I had and the check-in/check-out process was an absolute breeze.  The loft space itself was even more amazing than the photos make it out to be, if you can believe it.  It is walking distance from a seemingly unlimited number of bars and restaurants and a relatively short cab ride to anywhere else we wanted to go.

When I make it back to Seattle I'll have my fingers crossed that I can stay here again!"
5673552,46152489,2015-09-08,39609501,Joan,"This was a wonderful apartment to stay in - very clean and comfortable and located in a 'quieter' part of Fremont. We were greeted with 2 complimentary bottles of wine, such a nice treat! We were looking for a place near where our son lives, which is near 'The Troll' and this was perfect. We were able to walk to nearby coffee shops and the Fremont Brewery (awesome). The only thing that took some getting used to was that there were no coverings on the upstairs windows - we felt like people could see us dressing etc. in the bedroom. "
5673552,51771998,2015-10-24,9182953,Ervin & Martha,This place is an example of minimalistic living!  It was a good location for us as we explored the city of Seattle!
7343707,41668681,2015-08-08,23358089,Thanh Xuan Sr.,Brodie's home is absolutely breathtaking. The home is lodged away from any industrial disturbances and is remote enough for you to soak in the view. Brodie himself was a very understanding and hospitable host and there is no doubt we will be returning if we step foot in Seattle once more.
7343707,42333193,2015-08-12,4056403,Eva,"Brodie was a great host! Very accomodating and flexible when we had a last minute change of plans!
The house is absolutely incredible! The view is gorgeous and upon arriving we wished we were staying longer in Seattle! 
The place is very well equipped, practical and comfortable!  And again, that view!!!
If you have a car, staying at Brodie's place is a perfect way of relaxing after a day walking around the city! We would truly recommend it!"
7343707,43109100,2015-08-17,32431963,Emily,"Brodie was a great host. He was quick to respond, provided the information needed when it was needed. The house was very clean, had beautiful views, and was perfect for a family! We had 6 adults and everybody had a bed to sleep in. "
7343707,43525862,2015-08-20,9040300,Sheila,What a gorgeous place to be. Every morning it was like waking up in heaven. We were 15 to 20 minutes away from all the places we wanted to visited and were incredibly happy to leave the city and return to our sanctuary each night. Brodie was on text 24/7 and followed up with every question and request we had immediately. the house was super comfortable for our family of 6. If I go back to the area - I wouldn’t do it any differently.
7343707,45111933,2015-08-31,24847134,George,"Wow, what a place. If you don't want to deal with downtown and you have a rental car, Brodie's house is perfect. We happened to arrive  during a crazy storm that knocked out our power (and nearly 500k in Seattle) but it didn't prevent us from having a good time and taking in the view. Brodie could not have handled it any better and was very apologetic about the situation we were in. He offered to put us up in a hotel, which we politely declined, and gave us flashlights, lanterns, and candles right away to get through the night.... and after we got home he promptly reimbursed me for the trip! The combination of the amazing house, price, and that Brodie was such a solid guy really made us feel great about our stay and despite the freak storm.... we'd come back again in a heartbeat. "
7343707,45988213,2015-09-07,40425472,Jolene,We loved it . We had everything we needed. The view was great. Very secluded. So glad to have off street parking.
7343707,48305752,2015-09-25,42368750,Ina,It is a very nice place to stay. We had one bathroom each and three rooms. Just ask Brodie something and it is already done! Highly recommended. Next exhibition in Seattle and if possible we will stay at Brodie's place!
7343707,48951366,2015-09-29,44696548,David,"First of all, Brodie is quite responsive and replied to all our questions before our arrival. We felt very secure as well knowing he was available and lived very close had we needed anything. 

Now, let's talk about the house... This location was amazing. The house was clean, the view was beyond spectacular, and it was within about 20 minutes of everything we needed. We were there for work, but because of this hidden location, we felt like we were on vacation. 

This was our very first experience using airbnb and I don't think we'll ever do anything different. Thanks to Brodie for making our first time a great experience and next time we're going to Seattle, I know where we're staying."
7343707,49926324,2015-10-07,44339002,Randi,"My husband,son and I stayed at Brodie's place for two days.   The neighborhood was beautiful and quiet and only minutes to downtown Seattle.  I can't say enough about the view! As you walk down the stairs to the house there it is-  Breathtaking views of the ocean!  We sat on the deck for hours just watching the tide.  The house was beautifully decorated and very clean.  Our biggest surprise was the Kuerig coffee maker which we were already missing from home.   He thought of everything.  Thanks Brodie!  We will definitely be back.  "
7343707,50347568,2015-10-11,7096593,Charlene,"Brodie's home was perfect for us.  We were in town for a wedding in Edmonds and wanted to find a nice place to stay where we were close to the wedding but could still get to downtown Seattle without driving too far.  The view is breath taking - pictures do not do it justice.  We spent much of our time sitting outside enjoying the peaceful setting while watching the seals frolic about.

Brodie is a casual, easy going, generous host.  If you have questions or needs he is prompt to reply.  I feel he went beyond my expectations.  Compared to other homes I have rented, this one is top notch. 
"
7343707,51373999,2015-10-19,39055899,Tina,Brodie is a great host who was very responsive and flexible. The location is amazing with breathtaking views right out the back door. The location made this a truly memorable trip for us.
7343707,56676872,2015-12-16,49268487,Chris,The listing was just as described and possibly better.  The view makes the place worth it. 
7343707,57141185,2015-12-22,173500,Ingrid,"Wonderful place with a fantastic view.  The house has a great patio and inside is very well done, spacious, well kept and clean.  Our favorite part was all the windows and view of puget sound.  During much of our stay a bald eagle sat on the tree directly outside the window.
The location is a very nice residential neighborhood and probably our top choice on where to stay when visiting Seattle.  It has nearby parks along the beach and a short drive from the zoo and downtown.  
Brodie had everything we needed there including coffee.  He was very responsive to our questions."
7343707,57544032,2015-12-27,48821842,Louanne,We stayed for 3 days during Christmas and could not have been happier with the location or the accommodations!  Brodie was a great host.  The setting was even better than expected.  Looking forward to another visit real soon.
7439802,46910730,2015-09-14,15449081,Sarah,The penthouse is stunning. A work of art! Chasten was over the top accommodating to us and really went out of his way to make sure everything went smoothly. Cannot recommend this luxurious stay enough!
7439802,48748309,2015-09-28,42849719,Elizabeth,5 Stars!!!  The penthouse is well appointed and beautifully decorated. Chasten is quick to respond to any questions.  It was a great central location to explore Seattle. We did a ton of walking and used Uber when we needed it.  Would book this listing again in a heartbeat!  
7439802,51324201,2015-10-19,39773079,Richie,"Chasten's penthouse was amazing!  Top of the line finishes, convenient location, and a luxurious feel.  Chasten was prompt in all communication and he made me and my guests feel very welcomed.  Would not hesitate to stay there again on my next visit to Seattle."
7439802,54250499,2015-11-17,33203013,Amy,"Have you ever walked into a place and couldn't believe how spectacular it was and how you were hoping it wasn't a mistake that you were lucky enough to be staying there?  Like the best dream you didn't want to end?  I have just described the grace, beauty and sophistication of Chasten's penthouse.  If you ever have the opportunity to rent it, don't hesitate! It is wonderfully located just two blocks from Whole Foods, a tram across the street and Pike's Place Market no more than a 15 minute walk. It is beautifully and masterfully decorated and appointed.  There is nothing more you could ask for in the kitchen for the most gourmet of chefs.  The bathrooms and showers were so spa-like.  The view occupied three walls of windows and the roof was so great, I wished it weren't raining so I could barbecue up there. Speaking of rain, it gives you a great excuse to cocoon inside the penthouse with a great bottle of wine, some smoked salmon, grapes and figs from Pike's Place, and some French bread from Le Panier wishing that you could live there forever.  Chasten has done everything possible to this penthouse to make me want it as my own, from great art, to wonderful conversation inspiring books and collections of heartfelt objects.  It is an oasis to a weary traveler that speaks of world treasures within its own walls, offering insight into the world outside, while keeping you surrounded by the ultimate in comfort and luxury inside.  Chasten, you have done a masterful job!"
7439802,55381773,2015-12-01,5744249,Stephen,"""Brought to you by Crate and Barrel"" - that's what it was like."
7439802,57134879,2015-12-22,9947954,Jeong,"Chasten was easy to communicate with and very accommodating and a gracious host. We had everything we needed and the place was just amazing. Impeccably clean, simple, modern and luxurious ambience. It was a perfect place for our family to unwind after a busy day of exploring the city."
7439802,57439512,2015-12-26,34958031,Jeffrey,"Great penthouse unit in the happening South Lake Union neighborhood.  Not a single thing could be improved.  Top notch.  Chasten was responsive, even though he was in Europe on vacation.  Hope to stay there again.  "
666897,30999680,2015-04-30,17607592,William,"Great place in a quiet location, prefect if you are going for work as I was. There are nice bars and restaurants not too far away, probably 20 minutes walking. Qing was very helpful during my stay and I would definitely stay here again"
666897,31821969,2015-05-10,24829123,Winston,"Charming cottage, centrally located.  It was convenient for us to visit our daughter and walk or bus to many great sights.  Onsite parking was very helpful because of two hour parking restriction in the neighborhood.  Looking forward to future visits."
666897,32582989,2015-05-19,13245599,Mindy,"We stayed at Qing's cottage for a belated honeymoon, and it was just perfect! Easy walking distance to the Pine/Pike street attractions, and close to a couple of bus routes. Tucked away in a fenced in yard with gorgeous flowering trees. We were greeted by a woman staying in the front house. She gave us some suggestions for restaurants nearby, and then gave us our privacy. The house was very comfortable, and we enjoyed our stay very much."
666897,32792846,2015-05-21,27028671,Ivan,This was a lovely little cottage and was exactly as described. The neighbourhood was nice and quiet and we had easy access to the city. Having the space for our car was great too. Our host was very lovely and attended to all our needs promptly. Only issue we had was the toilet blocking quite easily.
666897,33554299,2015-05-29,206203,Amanda,"My scheduled host did not show up and Nina (Qing's mother) was kind enough to host me on very short notice. The place is cozy and comfortable, good internet, a bit spare in the kitchen but I was able to cook my meals just fine. The area is quiet and centrally located. You can bus or walk most anywhere. I enjoyed the whirlpool tub. I slept well there. I was happy to have a place to stay."
666897,34147619,2015-06-05,3179761,Linda,"This cottage was just the right size and the right location....enough out of downtown to be quiet--great café, Broadcast Coffee, within walking distance to downtown Pioneer Square, etc.  I liked the location.  Did rent a car and walked so I don't know about access to public transportation.

Cottage was nicely decorated and stocked with all that might be needed for a basic stay."
666897,35470879,2015-06-19,32722056,Ann,"The appt was cute and the house manager, Lena, was very helpful and patient; we arrived later in the evening and had many questions.  "
666897,35928452,2015-06-23,32217192,Janelle,"The cottage was nice for the price but definitely needs a bit of work. We arrived 20 minutes early, but luckily after a few tries, we found the house manager who said that the place was available for early access which was wonderful. The grounds are not well kept up and there was a random fridge sitting on our porch. Besides needing to be fully cleaned (there was a lot of dust and spiderwebs in some areas) it was a nice place. The bedroom is located upstairs via a narrow spiral staircase. The bedroom has skylights (windows in the ceilings) that allows A LOT of natural sunlight in. It's very nice, but not when you want to sleep in. The kitchen and all around house amenities are extremely limited, but we made it work. We didn't meet or speak to Qing, but talked to the house manager (who is really hard to get a hold of) .. There weren't any big issues that needed to be addressed. "
666897,39562205,2015-07-24,1598933,Levi,"Checking in and arriving was very easy. The location was great and had parking access and just a quick drive from a lot of things in the Cap Hill area, and not too far from downtown. Definitely near a lot of restaurants and great things to see/do/eat."
666897,40493682,2015-07-31,9432895,Patrick,"Qing’s place was a great place for my brother’s visit to Seattle. It is spacious and convenient to public transportation and is situated in a quiet neighborhood not far from where I live. The kitchen and bathroom are modern and clean. The wifi worked well and Nina, Qing’s mom, was very helpful. There was a slight delay at check-in as the host said the previous guests departed hours later than expected and left a mess. Nina had just steam cleaned the carpet and was trying to get it dry when we arrived. Afterwards, everything went very smoothly. As my brother was packing to leave for the airport, he noticed a trail of ants in the loft space. I called Nina and she responded as we reached the airport. She apologized and said she’d take care of it. Overall, my brother’s stay at Qing’s place was positive and I would request to stay at Qing’s place again in the future."
666897,40879727,2015-08-02,30255159,Serena,The host canceled this reservation the day before arrival. This is an automated posting.
666897,40968939,2015-08-03,20085608,James,"Good value but could use a little attention to make it outstanding.  Lena was very welcoming and accommodating.  We appreciated her letting us keep our sea kayaks inside the gate. Super cute cottage with a really nice little deck.  It was unusually hot, so a fan would have been nice (as the sleeping area is in the loft.)  Conveniently close to public transportation. Since we had just camped and kayaked for 4 days, the laundry machines came in really handy.  There are sugar ants though and, while they put out ant traps, I didn't like having to dodge them on the bathroom counter."
666897,44125952,2015-08-24,8905824,Deborah,"My boyfriend and I stayed four nights here. The door is locked by a key code so we were able to arrive late at night, which was great. However, we almost couldn't find the place! There's a tall fence with a latched gate around the property and no lights were on. Once we found our way inside we both thought the house was cute and the bed was comfortable. The house is in a convenient location (25 minutes walking or a very short uber to Pioneer Square). We had to improvise a bit to make food as the kitchen's pots, pans, and knives were limited. The kitchen and bedroom were clean, but the rest of the place could've used a little more attention. Overall, we enjoyed our stay. "
666897,44841760,2015-08-29,41857238,Janis,"There was a keypad for access so never checked with anyone.  The neighbor hood was typical of that area, close to Seattle U.
The entrance didn't look so ""lovely"" with an old refrigerator on one side of the door and an old futon couch on the other side.  The inside was ok, not the best cleaning job, dishes were in the sink!  Had to plug the dishwasher in to wash all the dishes.  Bed upstairs was comfortable and the location was great.  The futon in front of the tv had a definite dip not for sleeping!"
666897,45793414,2015-09-06,21835294,Drew,"The cottage was ok. The wifi was solid, and the place had towels, which was nice. Could have used some more kitchenware, and we couldn't get the heat to work. Great location, fair price, and it was nice and quiet. All in all pretty solid."
666897,50001198,2015-10-08,11736388,Samantha,"This cottage was absolutely perfect for our stay. It's in a lovely neighborhood and getting around was easy. The back patio had a grill which was great for enjoying the nice weather. The bed was very comfortable and the apartment was clean. The pictures show exactly what the place looks like. Also, Lena let us check in early, which was great.
"
666897,50777916,2015-10-14,11656275,Rachel,My husband and I really enjoyed Qing's place. It's in a great location and is the perfect size for two people. 
666897,57470630,2015-12-26,32773481,Joel,"Qing was very welcoming and the property was lovely. The location was perfect for our needs, and there was plenty of street parking with the supplied neighborhood parking pass. The space was private and secluded. I'd definitely stay here again."
387464,1062816,2012-03-30,2010763,Katie,"We have loved our stay in your charming, little backyard cottage. The bed was great! Love your choice of bright, sunny yellow for the common area and soft bule for the bath. The atmosphere you created was perfect.  Thanks!  We will be back."
387464,1080234,2012-04-03,1991744,Tricia,"The studio apartment was a convenient, fairly private, and clean place to stay during my short stay in Seattle. It was easy to coordinate and communicate with both Jason and Susy. I would stay there again."
387464,1087534,2012-04-05,502164,Carrie,"Great apartment! Super cozy, but enough space to live comfortably. The apartment is beautiful decorated in a clean, modern style. The bed was incredibly comfortable, with a large flat screen TV in front. Bathroom was spacious with new tile and amenities. The kitchen is minimal, but does have the essentials (fridge, microwave, coffee maker).
Jason and Susy were great hosts-- easy to deal with and attentive to my needs.
"
387464,1099516,2012-04-08,1869274,Greg &,"WOW! truly a 10! This is a gem, very quiet, private setting, the studio is a separate building in the rear of the Demeny's home, very private feeling.  It was CLEAN! and so very nice! great appointments, coffee provided....Jason was very gracious and very pleasant to talk with though we only met for a few moments.  I plan on visiting this Gem again soon and often.  
In addition, its got new and modern amenities.  If one wanted to make use of the kitchenette, the capability is there for simple food preparation.  I could go on and on, but I can't recommend this accomidation highly enough.  Two words readers...BOOK IT! :)"
387464,1120055,2012-04-12,1904037,Maud And Julien,"we had a great stay in this cozy and bright studio! lots of charming details: fresh flowers, chocolates, travel guides... highly recommended!"
387464,1213282,2012-05-01,1717811,Irene,"Owners are very easy to deal with online and got back quickly with answers.  my parents stayed here while our home was on the market.  their comments were that it was very nice, but it would have been nice to have a closet to hang up clothes.  Also should note that there are stairs and you need to walk up a steep driveway in case you have any physical disabilities."
387464,1266840,2012-05-12,2093911,Tyler & Jessica,"We really enjoyed our stay at Susy and Jason's Backyard Studio. It was private,very cozy and clean. It had everything we needed and it was so much better than staying in a hotel room including the price.Jason and Suzy included a free parking space for us! Who doesn't love free parking? The location is in a nice quiet neighborhood and close to everywhere we wanted to be including downtown.  

 We met Suzy and her daughters briefly and they were very nice. Suzy provided us with a list of good restaurants and things to do. It was very helpful.  We plan to visit again in the near future to see Canada. We definitely want to  be staying at Jason and Susy's Backyard Studio. My advise is Just Book It. Don't look any further.  "
387464,1310143,2012-05-20,2224127,Cindy,"I myself did not stay here but I actually reserved the place for my mother for a week. she LOVED it and i was very impressed when i went inside a few times while picking her up. jason and susy were VERY sweet and their little ""mother in law suite"" or what ever you may call it is quite charming! very well redone and the place is in a great neighborhood with lots of stores and places to eat within walking distance. we would definitely stay here again!! "
387464,1351642,2012-05-26,1814035,Toni,This place is sweet!  It's newly remodeled; all the furnishings are beautiful. It's tucked away in the tree-filled neighborhood close to bus stops for easy access to downtown. Jason and Susy are lovely and accessible if needed but allow complete privacy if you want it.  Stay here and feel pampered and cozy.  I most definitely recommend it!
387464,1405732,2012-06-03,1581651,Karen,I loved this little cottage.  Clean and simple.  The location worked out very well for me.  I could walk to the store or my daughter's house.  My grandson had fun playing there too.
387464,1437542,2012-06-08,250425,Andy,"My wife and I spent 4 nights at Jason and Suzy's place and had a wonderful time.  The studio is very nice, well lit, tastefully decorated with great kitchen and bathroom. Great location close to U, good bus service nearby and directly off the I-5 heading north out of downtown. Jason and Suzy were very helpful and made our visit a comfortable and enjoyable one.  We hope to visit again.  "
387464,1465312,2012-06-12,2040087,Kay,Great location - right on the bus line and within walking distance of a great breakfast cafe and of course very near Udub and Greenlake. We would definitely stay here again.
387464,1493390,2012-06-16,1742320,Aaron And Gillian,"Their studio was amazing. When you envision the ""perfect AirBnB"", this was it. The place felt brand new and we really felt like we were staying at a luxurious hotel, of course for a fraction of the price. While we never met our hosts (our schedules were extremely busy), there was still great communication and everything we needed to know was clearly defined. We wish we could have stayed longer!"
387464,1514621,2012-06-19,471447,Sue And Al,"We LOVED staying in Jason and Susy's cottage..It was in a lovely neighborhood... we enjoyed seeing all the beautiful landscape on the street...Its about 6 miles from downtown Seattle..but public transportation is available..The cottage was brand new and immaculate ..they paid very close attention to detail when furnishing the cottage....Jason and Susy are a friendly couple who you can tell enjoy being host's .....
"
387464,1543584,2012-06-23,2574655,Nancy,"We absolutely loved the adorable little studio provided by Jason and Susy!  They are located in a quiet older family neighborhood that we found to be very relaxing.  The studio is clean, cozy, and affordable and is only a short drive to downtown.  We heartily recommend them to anyone that visits Seattle."
387464,1634753,2012-07-05,115676,Al,"Clean, comfortable, and cute. Very nice neighborhood and conveniently located."

387464,1835018,2012-07-30,1583710,Danielle,"This was a perfect place for my husband and I. It was quiet and cozy, located in a great neighborhood and had convenient access to public transportation. Suzy and Jason were so easy to communicate with before and during our stay. We would definitely stay here again if we have the opportunity. "
387464,1874345,2012-08-03,803340,Gerald,"Excellent location, close to lovely Green Lake, perfect getaway,nicely decorated. Only regret that we didn't book longer than 3 days. Great appreciation to Jason and Susy for our wonderful experience in Seattle. We'll be back soon. "
387464,1912660,2012-08-07,2222312,Lisa,"Highly recommend this studio!  It  is comfortable, clean and quiet.  In a very nice neighborhood.  Susy and Jason have done a lovely job decorating it - it is darling, and they were extremely helpful.  Bus stop is just around the corner and you are walking distance to restaurants.
   "
387464,1936583,2012-08-09,3141679,Courtney,"This is a great place to stay! It is super clean and just adorable. The neighborhood is beautiful, and right on a bus line. Susy was very helpful, flexible, and accommodating. I would definitely stay here again!"
387464,2053848,2012-08-21,2808857,Conny,"we absolutely loved our stay at Jason and Susys  and can highly recommend it. Well thought out cottage that was spotless
with everything you might possibly need to make your stay comfy .
Loved the chickens and cat roaming around and we could not have been more pleased with everything.
I don't know if it was mentioned in the description when booking but the
very nice bathroom is not wheelchair accessible which was not needed in our case but might be nice to mention for all your rentals unless you already are doing that and I missed it."
387464,2213562,2012-09-06,2699027,Thomas,"Very nice, this really fit our needs!  Quite courteous and accommodating hosts, a clean contemporary, well-maintained compact studio in a quiet and centrally-located neighborhood.  Our stay was 2 weeks long.  We look forward to staying here during future trips to Seattle."
387464,2239156,2012-09-09,686046,Jan,"True serendipity. This cottage is an oasis in metro Seattle.  Bright, clean, newly remodeled, tastefully decorated, conveniently located and very private ... one could only wish for a few more days to explore this beautiful city.  Our hosts were available to give advice on shopping, restaurants, and sightseeing. On-street parking in this residential area was not a problem, and the bus to the market and wharf was just a two minute walk.  I hope this cottage will be available for my next trip to Seattle."
387464,2284572,2012-09-14,3353142,Toni,"We spent 4 days in this adorable suite nestled in a wonderful neighborhood. It was close enough to enjoy Seattle and yet we were tucked away in a safe, beautiful  place at night. Street parking was a breeze, right in front of the suite. We really appreciated the cleanliness, design, and all the attention to detail in making this a convenient, comfortable place to stay. Oh, and the bed was especilaly comfortable, and the fresh flowers were appreciated!  It was obvious to us that the suite was well thought out.
Susy was great with communication before our arrival. Jason was a kind and gracious host. (BTW, Ray's was great! Thanks for the recommendation.) We would defininately stay here again. Loved it. Thanks, Susy & Jason!"
387464,2369109,2012-09-22,1452223,Amy,"Jason and Susy's backyard studio provided a quiet, cozy and convenient base from which to explore Seattle. I appreciate that they arranged to leave the space right in front of their house available for us to park in. Although it wasn't guaranteed the spot would be open, we were there 3 nights, and it was always waiting for us. The neighborhood is beautiful, the bus to downtown is steps away, and the neighboring 3 chickens were adorable! I would definitely stay at Jason and Susy's again. "
387464,2427365,2012-09-27,2835591,Mark,"We had a wonderful time staying at Jason and Susy's studio. It was exactly what we needed - clean, comfortable, cozy, convenient. It felt like a home  away from home instead of an impersonal hotel. The space itself is lovely and has all of the amenities that we needed. We brought breakfast back to eat at the studio one morning and wanted salt & pepper. Lo and behold, they were right there in the kitchenette. Small details like that were great! It seemed like Jason and Susy thought of everything. 

The location is perfect for anyone with business at UW. It's near the campus, University District shopping complex, restaurants, cafes, etc. Parking was easy and the neighborhood is beautiful. We will definitely book at their place again!"
387464,2486740,2012-10-02,3502015,Naomi,"Jason and Susy are so sweet to leave some toys and baby blanket for us to use. It's a beautiful place, we even get to enjoy the moon while sleeping. Too bad we don't get to see neighbor's chicken. We will stay here again for sure next time."
387464,2525961,2012-10-06,3721229,Heidi,"This little studio is much nicer than it photographs. Everything about it is new and nicely done. The studio is a good size. The bathroom is spacious, new, clean and nicely organized. Located on a tree lined street of well kept single family homes. Restaurants and fitness studios are right down the street. Susy left me everything I needed to enjoy my stay. Thanks Susy and Jason for a hassel free, relaxing Seattle visit."
387464,2697561,2012-10-24,3150082,Kathy,"I recently stayed at Jason and Susy's studio for 7 nights and it was a great experience. The studio was perfect for my visit with my daughter who is attending the Univ. of Wash. It's very clean, intelligently equipped, located in a lovely, quiet neighborhood and Jason and Susy are wonderful hosts. They are communicative, thoughtful and responsive. I LOVED having a parking space right in front of the house when coming ""home"" late at night. The space isn't guaranteed but it was always available each evening I was there. There is a security light for after dark arrivals, an efficient, silent wall heater for quickly warming up the space on those cool, rainy Seattle nights and a kitchen with all the essentials. The bed is comfortable and the TV is large with a wide assortment of available channels. If you like privacy, comfort and safety in an attractive, clean, bright space, book Jason and Susy's studio. "
387464,2879535,2012-11-13,2385626,Steven,"What a warm, inviting, and private guest house.  This place lived up to it's listing and then some.  Jason and Susy were delightful and informative, perfect hosts.  I look forward to staying here again."
387464,3163014,2012-12-27,2146115,Gaetano,"Siamo stati molto bene nel piccolo appartamento nella zona nord di Seattle, in un quartiere molto bello. L'appartamento è sì piccolo, ma caldo e accogliente, e perfetto per due persone. Lo avevamo scelto perche' vicino alla casa di nostra figlia, sulla 25th street, ed è andato tutto bene. Nei giorni di pioggia di Seattle, tornare a ""casa"" è stato sempre molto bello."
387464,3357392,2013-01-16,1429853,Idona,Even though we visited in January we were pleasantly surprised how much light filtered through the windows and skylights.  It is a very cheerful and cozy studio with all the necessary amenities and Jason and Susy were excellent hosts!  We highly recommend it for those looking for a great value and cozy place to stay! 
387464,3385113,2013-01-21,107894,Elisabeth,"My boyfriend and I recently stayed in Jason and Susy's backyard studio for two nights, and it was the perfect choice for our Seattle weekend getaway. I didn't get to meet Susy and Jason in person, but they left a welcoming note with clear instructions for how to operate the heater and lights, as well as a flashlight in case we came home after dark and needed help getting up the driveway. They really thought of everything! 

The studio itself is lovely, charming, private, and stocked with hotel-quality amenities (minus that sterile hotel feel). It's clear a great deal of care went into the design and decoration of the space. After a long day of walking around the city, it was wonderful to come home to such a bright, warm, comfortable spot. The neighborhood is also cute, safe, and within easy driving or public transportation distance of everything Seattle has to offer.

This was a perfect Seattle experience. We were sad to leave the Backyard Studio, and would definitely stay here again."
387464,3698298,2013-03-05,3178456,Steven,"Susy and Jason's backyard unit  is a cozy, convenient and quiet cottage within easy walking distance of cafe, grocery store, Ravena Park and public transportation.  It was well stocked with necessities and appliances for a comfortable stay: warm and clean. A good deal. "
387464,3765772,2013-03-12,5165879,Eriko,"We had a nice relaxing time in this clean, comfortable, quiet and cute studio. I found everything I needed, there was even some green tea that I love, that was a great surprise for me! I was a little worried that maybe it's too far from downtown but the bus stop is actually right near the studio and only 30 min. ride to get to downtown! And don't forget to visit the beautiful Ravenna park! That was my highlight of the stay."
387464,3845241,2013-03-20,1429853,Idona,"This is the second time we have stayed at Jason and Susy's cozy backyard apartment.  As before, it is spotless and has everything we need for a lovely stay.  Thanks again Jason and Susy!"
387464,4359947,2013-04-30,2808857,Conny,"This was our 2nd stay with Susy and Jason and it was perfect again.
They have done some work on the outside of the cottage which makes it even cuter and Susy was such a gracious host.
The location is perfect for our needs and we'll absolutely stay there on our next trip to Seattle."
387464,4453982,2013-05-06,5654893,Eva,"We had a great stay in Suzy and Jason's appartment which is nicely furnished and very clean.
They were very nice and helpful. Thanks to them ! "
387464,4500550,2013-05-08,5775807,David,"If Jason and Susy's family was not in town using the apartment, I'd be there now. Awesome place. FIVE STARS ALL AROUND.  "
387464,4612554,2013-05-15,5696911,Alissa,"The studio was lovely!  Not only was everything immaculately clean, but Jason and Suzy had thought of everything… from fresh flowers on the table, to extra blankets and an umbrella. It really was a home away from home. I really appreciated the extra effort that they put into this studio to not just make it a place to stay, but to make it a beautiful and special place to stay. I was also very impressed with the size. While it is a studio, the bed must have been at least a queen size, and there was still room for a pack-and-play (the portable bed for a kid), plus the tables and chairs and room for our luggage. So it really is a great size. Jason and Suzy were great hosts, when we go back to Seattle, we definitely will stay here again.  As other reviewers have mentioned, we had no problem parking and there are cute restaurants nearby. The Grateful Bread company and Top Pot Donuts are delicious! "
387464,4682374,2013-05-20,5926490,Elizabeth,"We were very satisfied with all aspects of our stay. The studio is in a quiet, family neighborhood with chickens and children, but feels very private.  It is well appointed with great attention to detail. Hosts were friendly yet not intrusive. Several restaurants are within walking distance. We would stay there again."
387464,4771204,2013-05-25,3150082,Kathy,"This was my second stay with Jason and Susy and in total I've stayed in their backyard studio for about 10 days. I love it. They are wonderful hosts: super organized and communicative with a lovely, quiet, private studio that has a great bathroom. It's my idea of the perfect airbnb listing and they operate it beautifully. (And if you are a fan of Seattle's Top Pot Doughnuts, the Wedgwood location is only about five minutes away!) Thank you Jason and Susy, I really enjoyed staying with you again."
387464,4943672,2013-06-03,3892016,Pam,"My girlfriend and I stayed at Susy and Jason's backyard studio while attending weekend classes in Seattle.  It was the perfect little spot - nice, big bathroom, extremely clean and the bed was very comfy!  The fresh flowers inside added that special touch, and the adirondack chairs outside on the little porch were a great spot to rest and rejuvenate after a long day.  It's in a great character neighbourhood, and a very convenient location."
387464,5112805,2013-06-13,5208871,Sharrol,"The backyard studio apartment was accurately represented by the photos: comfortable, clean, and private.  My husband was very comfortable staying there and gave the studio apartment two thumbs up.  "
387464,5596655,2013-07-08,3101843,Émilie,"We really like our stay at Jason and Susy. They are two very well organized hosts. The apartment was ultra clean and you will find there almost everything you can possibly need! They were very accomodating, letting us check-in earlier! Great location also, we found a few cute markets in the area! Would definitely recommend and go back if we ever travel to Seattle again! Thank you Jason and Susy ! 

"
387464,5847802,2013-07-19,6950880,Emily,"Our stay with Jason and Susy was amazing! 
Their place is even cuter in person. It's warm, inviting, modern, cozy... This was my first time traveling to Seattle and staying here made it easy. It's still central enough that it only takes about 10 minutes to drive to all of the cool spots, yet far away enough that you can get a peaceful night's sleep. 
Not to mention I got to know their kitty... The sweetest little cat ever!
Thank you guys so much! "
387464,6069313,2013-07-29,4311580,Birgit,"Our last 4 days in Seattle were great! Many thanks to the lovely studio of Jason and Susy, which had all commodities and privacy and for us was located close to our friends. We really felt at home, so thank you again!  "
387464,6194427,2013-08-03,6820951,Jacob,"I had a great visit to Jason and Susy's studio apartment!  It was the perfect home-base for exploring the city.  I loved that I could spend all day downtown and then escape to the quieter University District.  Jason and Susy were very helpful with anything I needed, from directions to restaurant recommendations.  The space was exactly what I needed for my stay.  It had all the necessary amenities, plus some nice extras like the large tv.  It was like staying in a nice hotel but with the added touch of personality and hospitality from the hosts.  I would definitely stay here again."
387464,6319481,2013-08-08,5980033,Steve,"We stayed recently for 3 nights and really enjoyed the studio-  super cute, clean, and well-done!!  The online pics really don't do this place justice.  Location was great- we were able to get around easily with our rental car and parking was never an issue.  Hope to be able to make a return trip some day; would not hesitate to stay at Jason and Susy's again!!  "
387464,6422521,2013-08-12,6756800,Lindsay,"We had a wonderful stay! The backyard cottage was clean, current construction, nicely decorated (felt like home), great natural light and fresh open air with two skylights and french door open to cute patio. Everything we needed and more! Thoughtful books, magazines, maps, ferry schedules in Seattle, and games. Was very private on lovely quiet street. Awesome cafe one block away and a few minutes from U Village shopping. Had great parking all 4 days. Comfortable bed. We'll be back!"
387464,6490072,2013-08-14,2129502,Aya,This place was very clean and comfortable. It was perfect for a couple nights' visit in the city. We appreciate the hotel feel with clean towels and toiletries.
387464,6738997,2013-08-23,7751434,Britta,"It was our first airbnb-experience and we had a wonderful stay! The cottage is clean, nicely decorated and it felt like beeing in a comfortable hotel. Everything we needed and more (even coffee, tea, and goodies in the bathroom available!). For guest information we could use books, magazines, maps, ferry schedules in Seattle, and games. Area is nice (small houses around), not far away from U Village shopping, Green Lake Park and small cafés. Comfortable bed and well equipped kitchen. We will definitely make this cottage our first choice when returning to Seattle! "
387464,6944710,2013-08-31,5775807,David,Always a wonderful and affordable place to stay. Jason and Susy are also wonderful hosts
387464,7240139,2013-09-13,6627843,William J,"We were delighted with this cozy cottage. It's located in a very nice residential area with easy street parking, was clean, quiet (very private), and has a great little porch. It fit our needs perfectly. The Demeny's are gracious, unobtrusive hosts. We'd retun in a snap!"
387464,7377705,2013-09-17,2230731,Diane,"Very well-thought out cottage, with all the amenities you need.  Immaculate and in a great residential 
neighborhood that is near restaurants, coffee shops, University Village, Burke Gilman trail nearby for more than 40 miles of bike trails.  We brought our bikes, and they even had a bike rack for us to use. A parking space was left for us. Friendly, considerate and very thoughtful hosts!  Would love to stay with them again! "
387464,7481367,2013-09-22,7068220,Kelly,"This studio apartment has everything going for it. It's tucked away in a quiet, residential neighborhood, housed plenty of thoughtful details to make guests feel cozy and at home (electric tea kettle, plenty of utensils, and really nice, plush bath towels, etc.), and is just a hop, skip, and a bus ride away from anywhere you want to be in Seattle. I didn't meet Suzy and Jason in person but their hospitality was felt through all their communications and all the thoughtful details in the place. I don't think I could have had a better first airbnb experience! "
387464,7631425,2013-09-27,5775807,David,"Continues to be my favorite place, Spacious, good price, quiet, close to things yet embedded in a great neighborhood, and gracious hosts (and kids).  "
387464,8354434,2013-10-27,3973002,Sarah,"Cute, quiet, clean, and in a great neighborhood! Jason and Susy were great hosts. Can't wait to stay here again!! "
387464,8480196,2013-11-02,1971733,Caroline,"Although we live in Seattle ourselves, we'd rented our house, also via Airbnb, but didn't want to leave the City.  So we downsized for the week and loved it.  The garden suite is a lovely little place, delightfully located in a nice neighborhood near: the library, the PCC Market and Whole Foods; a lot of great restaurants; good connections by bus; and nice parks.  We walked and took the bus almost everywhere, except the days I had to drive to work at night, outside of Seattle, and I'd be driving anyway....I met Jason and really enjoyed talking with him as well!"
387464,8664231,2013-11-11,826977,Melina,"I loved the place and wanted to stay longer! The location is private and tucked away from noisy streets or freeways, slept like a baby here. It was easy to get to health food stores, nearby restaurants and freeway access. Everything was clean and comfortable, exactly what I love in a home. Thank you!
"
387464,8723527,2013-11-13,5775807,David,"The best location, amenities, solitude and price combined"
387464,8814807,2013-11-19,8503106,Beth,So peaceful and quiet.  A true retreat in a very convenient part of the city.  AND 3 very quiet and peaceful chickens were on my doorstep one afternoon - very fun!
387464,9127215,2013-12-09,149028,Adrienne,Very cozy! Nice touches and quiet. Thank you for letting us stay with you!
387464,9855470,2014-01-14,2606859,Cherrie,"Jason and Susy were wonderful hosts! They were easy to communicate with from the start and were very accommodating with our early check in and ensuring a parking spot for us. Their studio was super adorable, cozy and very calming. It was such a perfect place for us to stay for a few days while we tied up loose ends with moving out of our home in Seattle and move to San Diego. 
When we arrived they left out toys for my son and it helped so much to distract him while I got us settled in. My husband joined us the last two nights and he found the bed super comfortable (all of us did)! He also wanted me to add he loved that there were bath products provided...
I would highly recommend for you to stay at Jason and Susy's while you're in Seattle!
Thank you again so much for having us and making our last few days in Seattle enjoyable and comfortable! 
"
387464,9964867,2014-01-21,11215150,Josha,Had a great stay.  Wonderful apartment.  Thank you!
387464,10687831,2014-03-03,8856175,John (Chiang),"Jason and Susy were very accomodating with our arrival time and made it just that much more easier for us to check in, especially with such a late arrival into Seattle. The place looks exactly like the pictures and gave my girlfriend and I many ideas on how to remodel our own home in Milpitas. Communication with Jason and Susy was very easy and I would not hesitate to stay there again. "
387464,10873539,2014-03-11,2808857,Conny,"The Backyard Studio has become our home away from home, when visiting our son in Seattle and we can not say enough good things about it. It's clean,well equipped and very cozy in all weather. Thank you Suzy and Jason"
387464,11570863,2014-04-07,5460893,Kayla,"I love this place! It was beautiful and the hosts were so incredibly nice. The place was spotless and a lot bigger than I imagined! I know where I will be staying on future trips!
Thanks again!!"
387464,11651318,2014-04-10,5775807,David,Still my favorite place in Seattle. Their oasis is usually booked these days. No wonder
387464,12396332,2014-05-01,11166641,Cathy,"I so enjoyed my first stay at the Backyard Studio Apartment. It's obvious that so much love, care and detail has been put into the place.  
Convenient location, easy bus access, everything you could need, and a tranquil retreat at the end of the day.
Jason and Susy are the perfect hosts and very respectful of guest's privacy.
Will definitely visit again."
387464,12534320,2014-05-05,6756800,Lindsay,"We had another wonderful stay in Jason & Susy's place. This time, I really utilized the kitchen space to prepare some food for a baby shower. The large space inside the fridge was a lifesaver as I had melons, pineapple, grapes and strawberries! 
The studio always feels like home. Even in a downpour, the skylights provide nice natural light while maintaining privacy. The hairdryer and shower products are appreciated as well! We are multiple return customers and that says it all!
Thanks again!
Lindsay :-)"
387464,12825857,2014-05-12,4186106,Johanne,"Fantastic studio apartment.  Quiet, clean and comfortable.  Could not have asked for anything more.  Jason and Suzy were a pleasure to deal with.  I would recommend this place to any family member or friend visiting the area."
387464,13194150,2014-05-21,3819881,Carol,This was a wonderful experience all the way around.  From the time I contacted Susy and Jason to the time I left. They were very responsive as I was setting things up. Their place was super clean and quiet. I heard the occasional lovely noises of children and chickens. Otherwise it was very quiet. The neighborhood is residential and very close to where I had my meetings. I look forward to returning for a future trip...
387464,13546070,2014-05-30,15320152,Flora Sanchez,"The studio apartment is clean, quiet, and met my needs. I love that it has a small porch with two chairs to sit outside. The backyard is open, yet provides a lot of privacy from the street. It is pleasant, relaxing and clean. The neighborhood was nice, clean and felt safe, as did the apartment. Bus stops are conveniently located and there are several stops within 1-4 blocks. The closest bus stop into downtown (which is agreat connection to everywhere else in Seattle) is only 1/2 block from the apartment :) The skylights are nice but make it difficult to sleep in. I would recommend a stay here to others, especially if your target visit is University of Washington as this apartment is quit close to the UW."
387464,13683517,2014-06-02,2012417,Michael,Everything was as advertised or better. Some nice touches beyond the obvious included quality shampoos and soaps in the shower and an early-as-we-wanted check-in. Highly recommend.
387464,13828656,2014-06-05,6137414,Katja,"This is such a great and neat little studio! I loved staying there. Everything you could possibly need is there, and Susy and Jason left notes to explain how everything works, which I really appreciated as I didn't get to actually them in person. Everything is as seen on the photos. It's maybe a little smaller than I expected from the pictures but super clean, comfortable and cozy. There is a bus stop right around the corner that takes you to U District in 5-10 minutes (a nice 30-min walk) and into downtown Seattle in 30-45 minutes. The skylights in the studio are a really nice touch, but they do mean that the moment the sun is up, it gets pretty bright in the studio, so bring an eyemask if you want to sleep in. "
387464,13901733,2014-06-07,5300420,Mathew,The studio was wonderful. Very clean and comfortable. I really enjoyed my stay and will be returning to stay again. Susy was very responsive to my questions and made me feel very welcome. 
387464,14338452,2014-06-17,5300420,Mathew,My family and I stayed with Jason and Susy over UW Graduation weekend and I couldn't have worked out better. The place was very comfortable for my mother and grandmother. Parking was a breeze and getting to and from campus very smooth. I've stayed in the studio several times and highly recommend it. 
387464,15443850,2014-07-09,6809299,John,Fantastic location - we will return.  
387464,15752847,2014-07-15,14414696,Sébastien,"Suzi et Jason ont été des hôtes charmants, discrets et attentionnés. Le quartier ne présente pas d'intérêt en lui-même, mais la proximité immédiate d'un arrêt de bus permet de rejoindre l'université en 10mn et le centre-ville en 20mn. L'appartement était confortable. La décoration de bon goût. A noter (et c'est visible sur la photo) qu'il n'y a pas de gaz ou de plaque de cuisson, seulement un micro-ondes (non visible sur la photo)."
387464,17037370,2014-08-06,6309928,Helen,"Adorable studio cottage in a lovely residential neighborhood -- very convenient to I-5, downtown, Seattle Center and University of Washington -- close to restaurants and grocery stores including Whole Foods. Nicely decorated and perfect for one person or two who really like each other. We didn't ""hang out"" there as we were busy with family and friends -- but there are two nice Adirondack Chairs on the front porch of this cute cottage. Walking up the driveway is a bit steep and there is small gravel in the lower level of the back yard so I don't recommend stilettos, however, if you are wearing them in the first place I suppose you have the ability to navigate it! Our hosts Jason and Susy were terrific and gave us complete privacy. Their two daughters and new puppy were delightful! 
We highly recommend this cottage and think that the value is excellent!  "
387464,19040355,2014-09-05,17578220,Christina,"The backyard studio was a great place to stay in Seattle. It is really close to University of Washington and the amenities around the university. We loved a local spot for breakfast, Top Pot Doughnuts, it is very near. The neighbors were friendly and welcomed us to Seattle. The neighborhood was cute and the homes were very nice. It was a great place to come back to at the end of the day. The location had very good access to I-5, which we used to get around town."
387464,19225349,2014-09-08,1543205,Cathy,"Jason and Susy's backyard apartment was clean, charming, beautiful, and very welcoming. Everything looked just like the pictures. When I arrived, the family was having a gathering, and everyone waved and gave me a warm welcome. As hosts, they were swift with communication and very flexible when I had to arrive a day later than anticipated. I appreciated that they left a note for me with instructions, and when I had to check out half an hour later than anticipated, they were also accommodating. Overall, a fantastic experience. I'm very happy that I stayed here and would recommend the place to anyone visiting Seattle."
387464,19518117,2014-09-14,3717885,Diana,"Very comfortable apartment. Clean, quiet and private—a perfect retreat
after a long day of exploring. I would definitely stay here again. Thank you Jason & Susy!"
387464,20031051,2014-09-22,7117946,John,"This apartment was wonderful and exactly as described: very clean and cozy. All the amenities of home (kitchenette, refrigerator, microwave) but with the convenience of a hotel (cable, wifi, alarm clock). It is in a residential area, so it is mostly quiet, but people do live here, too! I was attending a conference at UW, which was just a 5 minute drive (or a quick bus ride) away, but I managed to enjoy the neighborhood. There are two bakeries and a donut place in walking distance, a Safeway up the street, with a few other restaurants around. I think this place is perfect if you are visiting the university, but also want to relax and get work done (away from students :D). Thanks for the great experience!"
387464,20348933,2014-09-28,5885932,Alex,This place is awesome. It was very cozy and perfect for what I was looking for. Very private and the family was really nice.
387464,20783785,2014-10-05,5976576,Song-I,"Jason and Susy's studio is wonderful. It is well-kept, clean, and incredibly charming.  I had some hectic days in the city for a quick apartment hunt, and what a relief it was to come home to this quiet and lush neighborhood! Parking was always available out front (no charge) and Jason and Susy left great and caring instructions upon booking and arrival. Highly recommended :)"
387464,21122516,2014-10-12,3717885,Diana,"Thank you Jason and Susy.
Your place is perfect! I highly
recommend it."

Very convenient to Northeast Seattle. In a good neighborhood. Hosts communicated well."
387464,22214529,2014-11-01,4235313,Tess,"My stay at the cottage was awesome. Perfect location for what I needed, very clean and comfortable. "
387464,22437449,2014-11-06,5775807,David,Better every time
387464,22539262,2014-11-09,6756800,Lindsay,"Our stay at the Backyard Studio was wonderful as always. They put up a new fence (new puppy?) that provides even more privacy from the street. The studio is always clean and comfortable, private and quiet. We had street parking right in front each of the three days. The coffee provided is much appreciated. Great hosts!"
387464,23322039,2014-11-29,939483,Annelliott,"This was the perfect solution to a crowded house over the holidays. Easy access, comfortable bed, and lovely hosts. It went off without a hitch and unlike most relatives they didn't stink after 3 days. "
387464,23933066,2014-12-14,24736179,Tedd,"Jason and Susy's backyard studio was as described or better. Upon arrival, the studio was very clean and felt like home. I would definitely recommend people to stay at their cozy studio!"
387464,24000128,2014-12-16,3721229,Heidi,"Lovely, convenient and comfortable studio in a great neighborhood. Strong wireless connection makes it a good spot for business travel. Hosts provide a comfortable stay -- available but unobtrusive. It's my favorite place to stay in Seattle. "
387464,24307750,2014-12-25,18427198,Carrie & Nick,"We had my parents stay at Jason and Susy's studio over the Christmas break.  The hosts made my parents feel very welcome and everything was easy very clean, clear, and comfortable.  My parents liked it so much that they asked to stay longer.  We're very appreciative that our hosts could accommodate even though they were leaving town.   We would definitely have future guests stay there! "
387464,25334043,2015-01-12,17791870,Jinny,"Jason and Suzy made me feel very welcome in their backyard apartment. The studio was beautifully decorated and very clean, I wish we could have stayed longer! I would take this apartment over a hotel any day. It felt secluded but yet within easy reach of downtown. We especially loved that Top Pot doughnuts was within walking distance- so delicious! "

387464,25660218,2015-01-22,113536,Mia,"My partner and I had a great stay at Jason and Susy's studio! We were visiting family in a nearby suburb and welcomed the chance to get away and hang out in the city for a few nights. 

The apartment is bright, clean, and inviting, located in the backyard of a charming house on a quiet street. The bed was cozy and we especially loved the mini refrigerator and microwave, which enabled us to have a few somewhat healthy meals and avoid eating out. Easily accessible by public transportation and with plenty of on-street parking. 

Unrelated to the studio itself, we also loved giving pets and scratches to the little gray outdoor cat that came wandering by. :) 

Thanks so much, will definitely keep this studio in mind the next time we're in Seattle!"
387464,25965198,2015-01-31,16260168,Liz,"This studio is very nice, it was quite a treat! Jason and Susy were respectful of privacy and gave us the space we needed. Their neighborhood is perfect for an evening walk and close to the things we needed. Our fault for not reading carefully that there is no stove or freezer - but we made do."
387464,26063333,2015-02-02,9911829,Thomas,Jason and Susy left us a personalized page of instructions and responded quickly to our needs when we didn't know the internet code.  When we arrived we appreciated having the studio warm.

387464,26278944,2015-02-08,16638458,Hayley,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay! This little place had everything we needed  for our short, touristy Seattle weekend. It was a great home base, a very privately situated mother-in-law house in a quiet backyard. I especially appreciated the shampoo, hair dryer, and teapot/tea selection on hand. It's the little things! Also, it's far enough away from downtown that parking is easy and brunch lines aren't too bad."
387464,26746396,2015-02-18,19330919,Sara,"Great neighborhood within walking distance to cute cafes and pubs. The mini fridge was great for leftovers, The porch chairs were a nice touch. Street parking was easy to find."
387464,26838683,2015-02-20,27368696,Suzanne,"Communications were excellent. They accommodated our ever moving schedule.  Very nice to talk to, (website hidden) is just as wonderful a second time round. Highly recommended."
387464,27038906,2015-02-23,8179952,Robert,The studio was wonderful.  It felt like home as soon as I stepped inside.  Comfortable and beautifully decorated with lots of natural light.

Immaculately clean with very tasteful and inviting decor, it is an environment where I felt at home at once. Stocked with all the usual necessities, and then some, there was nothing lacking for my stay. It is very private, and situated just down the street from public transportation. Our son and his family live nearby so we hope to return again and again."
387464,30205457,2015-04-19,13322676,Lewis & Kata,"This is a stellar spot in NE Seattle. Despite Susy & Jason being out of pocket for our stay, the communication was great, check-in a breeze, etc. The place itself is immaculately clean, well-appointed, very stylish and cozy. The location is very solid, only a few blocks from public transport. You'll have everything you need here and you'll feed quite at home.  The buddha in the backyard is a nice touch! Thanks for helping make our first trip to Seattle a great one."
387464,30711314,2015-04-26,9906947,Ginger,Susy and Jason have a beautiful place. Warm and inviting.  They were great hosts! They communicated clearly and made us feel very comfortable.  Their cottage is in a great neighborhood.  Close to many restaurants and the freeway.  We had nice weather and were able to walk to dinner. Given the opportunity.... we would definitely stay here again.

387464,32079722,2015-05-13,26692196,Melissa,"Cozy and clean, a little jewel box  -- the pictures didn't do it justice!  Jason & Suzy's studio had everything I needed and more.  everything seemed brand new.   My first AirBNB experience and it was fantastic.  Easy check in, a quick chat with Suzy -- very nice :)   The location was great for my work trip, but I would love to have been able to explore the neighborhood, with its lovely houses and yards (love the blooming rhododendrons) and nearby restaurants and shops.  maybe next time!  "
387464,32375515,2015-05-17,3518939,Laura,"This was a fabulous studio for my stay in Seattle.  A perfect size for 1 or 2 people, very clean, and private.

387464,33684020,2015-05-31,31553774,Linda,"The backyard studio was a wonderful place for us to stay.  It was in a quiet, convenient and safe neighborhood.  The studio was clean and inviting.  We would definitely stay again."
387464,34016956,2015-06-03,5960009,Olga,"Susy was very easy to communicate with, even though we never met in person. She emailed us specific directions and everything was ready  for us when we arrived.  The little cottage was clean and very comfortable. I would highly recommend this place to anyone and we would be delighted to us it again."
387464,34198069,2015-06-06,29711062,Diana,"We had a wonderful time in this adorable backyard studio cottage. Beautiful, quiet, clean and cozy neighborhood and home, close to everywhere we wanted to be, our stay was far too short! Thank you Jason and Susy for your hospitality. We look forward to staying again on our next trip to Seattle."
387464,35288841,2015-06-17,25663423,Deirdre,"Wonderful experience at the backyard cottage. we rented it for my in laws who stayed there for over a week while visiting us (not enough room in our inn). they loved the space, which was clean and spacious & inviting.  The loved the nearby breakfast spot and walking in the neighborhood. The hosts were wonderful and even brought over to us (nearby) the items left behind. We would definitely use again. "
387464,35908864,2015-06-23,3168427,Vivien,"Wonderful guest cottage in a lovely neighborhood!  We ate at 3 different, great cafes/restaurants  just a short walk away.  The bus stop, about a 2 minute walk away, allowed us to leave the car parked while we went downtown.  Very accurate description of the facilities.  We stayed 5 nights and would have loved to stay longer!!!!"
387464,36295089,2015-06-27,28467010,Maya,"We loved our stay at Jason and Susy's guest cottage. The neighborhood is great and very quiet at night, even with all the windows open. We walked to several great local spots from there. Jason and Susy were wonderful hosts - extremely helpful, friendly, and flexible. They gave us great restaurant recommendations, too. The space is beautiful and bright and clean with everything you need. I would love to stay at Jason and Susy's again next time I'm in Seattle. "
387464,36529350,2015-06-29,1558073,Kevin,"Jason and Susy's backyard studio is in a great neighborhood and we loved staying there.  The studio was clean, nicely appointed, and offered everything that we needed.  We will definitely return!"
387464,36947977,2015-07-03,30597330,Richard,"Perfect host, perfect little spot to lay your head down. This was exactly what I needed and it worked out famously."
387464,37302668,2015-07-06,31370068,Amanda & Doug,"Staying in Jason and Susy's backyard studio was an awesome experience! We immediately felt at home when we arrived, and were greeted by a thoughtful note and a list of restaurant recommendations. We loved how close we were to the city, yet it was located in a beautiful neighborhood!"
387464,37740442,2015-07-10,25545985,Sean,"Jason and Susy's backyard studio is a modern, cozy home away from home. We had a wonderful stay, and our hosts were available to address any concerns but remained distant enough to make us feel like we were in a private residence. We would highly recommend this studio to anyone! Very clean, too!"
387464,37968891,2015-07-12,32238805,Adria,"The space was great!  It is a quiet and comfortable room, and is close to great neighborhoods. It was a perfect homebase to explore Seattle from. The hosts left a nice note for us upon arrival, with recommendations for places to eat and things to do. The room was clean, parking was easy, the bed was comfortable. All in all, it was a wonderful first experience with airbnb. I highly recommend this place. "
387464,38710154,2015-07-18,6309928,Helen,"This was our second stay with Jason and Susy -- they live in a lovely residential neighborhood in the Ravenna district in Seattle. My sister lives around the corner, so it is very convenient when we come to visit. It is exactly as it is described -- a studio in their backyard -- clean, sweet and delightful!! Susy and Jason are wonderful hosts because they leave you alone!! If you need something, they are there for you, but very thoughtful about giving you complete privacy.
Thank you Jason and Susy!! See you next time.
"
387464,39379075,2015-07-23,30377282,Emma,"Beautiful, cozy studio. The perfect retreat in a lovely neighborhood."
387464,39926134,2015-07-27,15383437,Kayla,Wonderful place to stay! It was quiet and cozy. They recommended restaurants and were wonderful hosts. I would definitely stay here again. 
387464,40894725,2015-08-03,30560876,Jarod,We had a wonderful stay here! The pictures and descriptions were accurate. It's a great studio apartment in a great location. Highly recommended!
387464,41426327,2015-08-07,3529023,Laura,"We had a wonderful stay in Jason and Susy's studio. All of the instructions were clearly laid out and everything was so simple and easy. The cute little studio was super clean and cozy, perfect for two people, and extra quiet. It's separate from the main house, allowing for extra privacy. 

There were lots of nice little touches, from Trader Joe body products in the shower to an ironing board and iron to a TV with satellite channels to reliable wifi (which may not seem like a big deal, but as a Canadian without a data plan for this trip, it was much appreciated). 

The studio was located really close to a transit stop, so we were able to get anywhere we needed to go easily. Although we did a lot of sightseeing, we also had a lovely brunch at a restaurant called Bryant Corner, just around the corner from the studio. It was one of Jason and Susy's recommendations for Seattle dining spots from a handy list they left for us. 

We didn't get to meet Jason and Susy while we were there since they were away, but they had someone looking after the studio while they were gone. I can't think of a single thing we'd change, and we'd definitely stay there again the next time we visit Seattle!
"
387464,43033552,2015-08-17,5288562,Victoria,"Jason and Susy have a wonderful little cottage -- it's really a treat to stay there. While it's small, it's really perfect, with every little amenity attended to, and nestled into the middle of an awesome neighborhood. We were really comfortable, and found the neighborhood an excellent place to explore Seattle."
387464,44898849,2015-08-30,23468847,Emily,Susy and Jason provided clear instructions upon entering and inside the apartment. Very personalized and welcoming with recommended eats nearby. So helpful!
387464,45294962,2015-09-01,19979562,Lisa,"I stayed at Jason & Susy's backyard studio apartment for 2 nights and had such a wonderful experience! The place is exactly what's shown in the pictures, if not better. Cleanliness & quietness are extremely important to me when I travel, and this studio provided just that. I especially loved how clean the bathroom was and the bed was super comfortable for my mom & I to sleep in. Would definitely book this place again when I come back to Seattle!"
387464,46905252,2015-09-14,26383615,Peg,"We enjoyed our stay at the backyard studio apartment.  It was  comfortable and very clean.  It was stocked with everything we needed.  The hosts were welcoming, gave excellent directions for finding the apt. and getting settled, and responded promptly to questions we had.  The neighborhood was lovely and was convenient to our daughter's home, as well as restaurants, grocery stores, and the University.  The apt. met our expectations and we were very pleased with it."
387464,47244446,2015-09-17,33505005,Mareike,"We had an awesome stay at Susys and Jasons Backyard Studio. Our flight was delayed and we just got in to Seattle at about 10 pm. But Susy gave us helpful instructions to find everything. The studio has everything you need for the stay. It is cute, very well decorated and the bed is very comftable. We would have loved to get to know Susy and Jason but we were pretty much gone all day cause we did not have much time visiting Seattle and just got back to the studio late in the evening. But we knew that if we needed any help Susy and Jason would be available to help us!"
387464,47649009,2015-09-21,36528721,Jennifer,"We really enjoyed our  studio apartment. The neighborhood it was located in was great. There were a lot of great places to eat, see and visit. We found some great places to eat thanks to our host's suggestions. Everything was decent in closeness to the locations and sites we wanted to see. Even though we didn't see our host we felt at home in our studio apartment. They took the time to leave suggestions and personal note welcoming us. They also check in with us and made sure everything was going well with our trip. The place we stayed was exactly like it was mentioned and showed. It was just enough space for the time and amount we were there. We had a great trip and felt like home here. Was better than hotel and felt like really living in Seattle."
387464,47991569,2015-09-22,799364,Kayt,"Jason and Susy's petite studio was a perfect home base for a recent two-night trip I took to Seattle. I enjoyed the privacy and the central location. It was close to my friends' neighborhoods and I felt safe returning late at night on my own. I don't often travel to Seattle without my husband and daughter, but when I do I will cross my fingers that this little Airbnb gem is available. P.S. I'm glad that they included a note in the listing about using an eye mask; I brought it and needed it."
387464,48497385,2015-09-27,32145764,Nicole,"Cozy, comfortable studio! Conveniently located with a very home-y feel. We were able to explore the city and have a safe, warm place to come home to at night. Would definitely stay here again!"
387464,49007055,2015-09-30,32645687,Kc,"EXACTLY AS EXPECTED! Wow what a great stay! The hosts were accommodating when I asked to check in early. The neighborhood felt safe as well.

What a beautiful studio! I was extremely surprised how roomie it was for 2 people for a studio in a backyard but it will be exactly what you would hope/imagine an Airbnb stay to be. 10/10 would book again! Thank you so much!"
387464,49501367,2015-10-04,42643112,Yan,"Wonderful place to stay. Good and safe location,comfortable and privacy room. We didn't meet host,but everything we needed were prepared in the studio. It was a nice experience to live here."
387464,50290210,2015-10-11,9911829,Thomas,"everything was exactly as described.  The room is comfortable, quiet, and the rain on the skylights was comforting. "
387464,52323596,2015-10-28,2773671,Dan,"Perfect little studio - clean, tidy, and easy for getting to UW.  Would choose it over any of the area hotels every time!"
387464,55343171,2015-12-01,13737373,Donna,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Backyard Studio Apartment. It was clean, comfortable and located just where we like. The fresh coffee and cream was an added bonus! We will be back."
387464,56349749,2015-12-12,5775807,David,Stayed there many times.  It's my go-to.  
752483,3172155,2012-12-28,4204616,Rick,"My family and I rented this townhouse for the Christmas holiday and had a great experience.  The location was fantastic as it is walkable to my family's home as well as a great variety of shops and restaurants.  There is a fantastic space needle view from the 2nd and 3rd story especially at night.  

It took a night or two to get used to some significantly hard mattresses but other than that, we had a GREAT trip."
752483,3243870,2013-01-03,3916222,Marshka,"
Vaibhav’s place was ideal for our stay in Seattle.  We were travelling with my mum so it was great to have our own bedrooms on separate floors with a bathroom each.  We were in Seattle for NYE and after a lovely dinner on Broadway St we had a great view of the fireworks on the Space Needle from Vaibhav’s deck.  The area around the condo is vibrant and fun and there are many funky restaurants and bars.  We were also able to park the car for our 2 day stay, using the parking permit provided by Vaibhav and we were able to walk to downtown easily from his place. 
"
752483,11196508,2014-03-24,7255150,Grady,"Wonderful unit; very comfortable, with beautiful views, plenty of space and accessibility to all types of attractions and services.   Vaibhav was very accommodating and friendly, and while he was away for the weekend, we were easily able to reach him with questions and general inquiries.  We would be more than happy I stay there on a future stay."
752483,21998620,2014-10-27,13108853,Daniel,Easy and experience. Great location. No hassle whatsoever. Parking pass was appreciated. 
752483,28820728,2015-03-30,28472883,Nicole,Vaibhav made us feel very welcome by leaving detailed check in instructions and being available to answer my questions.  His condo was clean and comfortable.  The listing description was completely accurate and the neighborhood was ideal.  It was a great place to stay!
752483,29142501,2015-04-04,18599336,Stefan,Excellent place in a great / lively neighborhood of town. I highly recommend to stay at Vaibhav's place.
752483,29931727,2015-04-14,29464033,Alexander,"Vaibhav made us feel very welcome! We had a wonderful time, and the neighbourhood is the best in Seattle. 
"
752483,30314710,2015-04-20,29392247,Christina,"The place was as described: well kept, BEAUTIFUL view of the Space Needle, and I have to say, this house was in the perfect location! It was conveniently located in the heart of Capitol Hill and was easily accessible to many restaurants, bars, and the Starbucks Reserved Roastery (I'm a huge coffee lover). 

In addition, something came up with the house during my stay and Vaibhav was very quick to respond and was a super helpful and flexible host! Highly recommend others to stay at if they're looking for a place near many points of interests with a breath-taking view. 

"
752483,32598904,2015-05-19,2033876,Jeff,"My friends and I had a great time at this place in Capitol Hill, the location is great in a quiet street.  It is however close to shopping, restaurants, and a grocery store (all a few blocks away) so you get the best of both worlds.

Vaibhav was a great host and was diligent with communication.  The flat was just as listed as we found ourselves quite comfortable here.

Though a parking pass is provided for the street, it is very hard to find an available spot in this neighborhood.  Once you have a spot, you may want to hold onto it if you can!"
752483,34345951,2015-06-07,19090215,Marc,"Good communication with host. Condo is difficult to find at night; small, unlighted numbers. The unit is behind another in the same complex, off the street. Apartment as described. 3 level, lots of stairs. Nice neighborhood, will need the parking pass. First time I've paid a cleaning fee, must be to clean the place after we leave. "
752483,38547779,2015-07-16,6863858,Vivien,"I didn't meet Vaibhav in person but he responded text very fast so checking in was extremely easy! The house is at a great location, easy getting downtown ( we didn't even have a car ). Vaibhav was nice, he let me leave my luggage at his place for couple hours after checking out. I would recommend his place to everyone! "
752483,46168263,2015-09-08,7035181,Sean,"Overall great place in the heart of the Capitol Hill neighborhood. Great views of Seattle skyline, quiet, close walking distance to neat neighborhood and short taxi ride to downtown. Plenty of space in Vaibhav's place for several if needed, he's a great host! Thank you Vaibhav!!"
752483,47531051,2015-09-20,41091932,Russell,Capital Hill is a great area and the location of this property is very central within it. Excellent location.
6133684,32417416,2015-05-17,33043812,Kelsey,"Janice was very easy to communicate with and very helpful with all of our needs. The space is very clean and big, more than enough for my boyfriend and I and all of our bags, and very private and cozy. There is parking and easy access all over the city!

Great experience!"
6133684,37468402,2015-07-07,33065317,Emily,"The apartment was exactly as described, and was very comfortable. The location is quite convenient; next to two bus stops and fairly close to a shopping plaza. Janice was very welcoming and helpful, and let us bring our two cats with us, which was great. I would definitely recommend this apartment/host."
6133684,48460397,2015-09-26,15380499,Phillip,"The apartment was very comfortable, incredibly quite, and private.  It was very convenient for our West Seattle activities.  Janice had no problem accommodating our extremely late arrival.  Janice let us use the fireplace and she even let us run a load of laundry.  Amazingly we never crossed paths.  We look forward to staying with Janice again on one of our future trips to West Seattle.    "
6133684,48852129,2015-09-28,45047014,Anuhya,"I stayed at Janice's place for one night. Great place to stay for a couple nights. She was quick to respond to my last-minute booking request and was generally quick to respond which I really appreciated. There's a pizza place, bakery and other shops about a fifteen minute walk away, but otherwise it's mostly houses. So, a quite neighborhood. It is a basement apartment, so you can hear people walking around and talking upstairs but I never found it overly loud during my stay. Downtown isn't too far a commute by bus. 

The apartment was spacious and nicely decorated... exactly how it looks in the pictures. It was a very private room with its own room key and an exterior key to a side entrance, so I didn't have to exit and enter through the house's front door. Some nice touches I didn't expect were the boardgames in the shelf and a basket full of all sorts of bathroom things like floss, q-tips, shampoo, conditioner and much more which was nice. Janice, herself, was friendly and seemed like an interesting person to talk to if I had more time. 

"
6133684,51357452,2015-10-19,44355707,Dmitriy,"Janice was great and very welcoming. We were able to get into the room as soon as we got there and found everything really neat and clean. There was a much-needed coffee maker, a microwave, and a small fridge with a freezer unit. The bathroom was very well equipped and had a giant mirror. There is a door with a lock on it for people who want privacy and the room is heated and had two thermostats for heating different parts of the room. There is a great bed and a really comfortable couch if you are with a partner who is bothered by your snoring. The room also has plenty of outlets for those who enjoy their electronics."
1494986,7099304,2013-09-06,183992,Lisa,We had a lovely stay at William's apartment. Very romantic. Beautiful private garden with an amazing hot tub. Would reccomend staying here to any and all friends traveling to Seattle. William was very nice and helpful. He had lots of reccomendations for the area. We couldn't have asked for a better place to experience Queen Anne!
1494986,12317568,2014-04-28,14382697,Megan,"We had a really great stay, the place is beautiful and clean and comfortable. Thanks for having us!"
1494986,23177787,2014-11-24,9777654,Erroll,Nice modern place. Everything was clean. We didn't use the hot tub but is an awesome amenity. 
1494986,25035301,2015-01-05,841126,Buckley,"We usually stay in West Seattle but wanted to stay somewhere more central, specifically Queen Anne. From the pictures William's apartment looked clean, modern, and functional. The apartment was everything we hoped. Clean, well decorated, functional and convenient. We enjoyed walking the stairs to the top of the hill, walking down the stairs to Lake Union, and walking down the hill for coffee and groceries. Great location, great apartment, looking forward to staying there again."
1494986,26115471,2015-02-03,18945028,Sarah,"Pristine property perfect for a couple. Well appointed details throughout contained everything we could need for a week of exploring the city and relaxing in comfort. I would recommend this property to any of my friends and family.

The floor plan shows a garage which is not in use, however we were able to park directly in front of the unit without any difficulty throughout the week.

Central location was only a $10 Uber ride to most destinations.

A very wonderful experience."
1494986,38556211,2015-07-16,1687064,Reggie,"This was the perfect place to stay for me and my family. It as really quiet and peaceful and the house was located in a convenient location in Queen Anne. Inside was really clean and had just the right amount of space for us. We loved being able to relax on the patio and look out to the trees. Unfortunately, we didn't have time to take advantage of the spa. The coordination with William was seamless. I would stay there again next time in in town.  "
1494986,45666593,2015-09-05,8707109,Jacomien,"We had such a good time at Queen Anne Garden Gateway, the apartment exceeded our expectations. Very modern and luxurious and in a great part of Seattle. We stayed for four nights and by the end of our stay the place really felt like a home. The bed is extremely comfortable and the television huge. We liked the place so much that we actually just stayed in and cooked for 2 nights, the kitchen is well equipped with everything you may need. There is a great supermarket just down the road. Definitely recommend staying here."
1494986,47465743,2015-09-19,17778049,Charlotte,"The host provided very comprehensive instructions on how to enter, etc.  We felt the property was exactly as promised.  We would stay here again.  It was across the street from the #2 & 3 bus stop which took you right to Seattle Center.  We walked from the property as well and found ourselves in the wonderful neighborhood of Queen Anne, a mere heart pounding steps (that's Seattle) away."
1494986,49446397,2015-10-04,4910861,Victoria,"The unit is beautiful and so clean! William (our host) was so patient and answered all our questions promptly. He sent us recommendations of restaurants and bars in the area, as well as grocery store which was such a huge help. The pictures don't do it justice. It's so quiet and in a great neighborhood. It's in a very central location and only a $7-8 uber ride to downtown or pike place. Four of us stayed and there was plenty of room. The unit is so comfortable (especially the beds), we didn't want to leave! We really loved staying here. We will be back and will definitely stay here again."
1494986,55739656,2015-12-05,281421,George,"William was a kind host and very helpful. We ran into some trouble on our way up to Seattle, but once we arrived to our final destination, everything was set up perfectly and without wait.

His list of local grub and other local options was a great help for first-timers in the Queen Anne area."
8608233,58235123,2016-01-01,33005883,Alyssa,We had a great time staying at Allen's place! It was just as described and had everything we needed. Allen was easy to communicate with and checking in and out was simple. The condo is in a great location by the Sculpture Park with lots of restaurants and attractions within walking distance. We got there just in time to watch the sunset from the rooftop deck overlooking Elliott Bay. Gorgeous! I would definitely stay here again. 
7881802,48473092,2015-09-26,5448046,Tracy,"We enjoyed staying here. The neighborhood was very quint and everything was accessible. It only took a mere couple minutes to walk to my new favorite coffee shop. Additionally, parking was really easy. We loved staying here. "
7881802,50778190,2015-10-14,43606047,Sally,"The house was exactly as described and more.  It was perfect for our group of 8 and had more than enough of everything we needed for our stay.  We loved all the family friendly items in the house: the pack 'n plays, the toys for various ages, the baby gate, the baby monitor, the extra folding table and extra queen blow up bed. The open floor plan was great for the family gathering we had; it allowed everyone to have spaces for talking and sitting with each other.  We used the charcoal grill several times and the stove was modern and very functional.  The surrounding neighborhood was amazing - lots of great little cafes, specialty shops, library, post office, grocery and other shopping was within walking distance, as well as several churches and parks.  The climbing tree with the rope swing in the front yard was a huge hit with the kids!!  Will definitely look to rent again when we go back to Seattle."
7881802,52858986,2015-11-02,5475887,Amoris,"The house was very clean and was described well on the site. The 4th bedroom is a finished basement room with a fold-out couch, so I would say if you have several couples in your group, someone will have to sleep on a fold-out (or the bunk beds). There are only 2 actual beds for couples. Sleeps 10 seems generous to me unless you bring an air mattress. But the home is warm and cozy and the directions to get in were easy. Plenty of street parking, nice neighborhood, close to grocery store and coffee shops, nice big front porch, fridge had all the condiments needed. Bring a stereo or speakers for your phone if you want music, there doesn't seem to be any music devices or radios in the house. OVERALL we were very happy with the home and only add these details for future folks to be able to plan their trip appropriately! The price is right with this one! "
7881802,54116879,2015-11-16,45617604,Shannon,This is a beautiful house in a great neighborhood.  Description and photos were accurate.  Would stay there again.

4632923,24779338,2015-01-02,19457140,Lindsey,"Lovely, eclectic spot! Perfect for walking around and exploring the Capitol Hill area.  "
4632923,28347892,2015-03-22,21459998,Nate,"We really enjoyed our stay in Capital Hill. The apartment was comfortable, and Margot made us feel very welcome. My wife and I like to be pedestrians as much as possible, so the location of this apartment is perfect. There are tons of bars and restaurants all within walking distance. We spent a lot of time out on the balcony, and the view is great. 

There was no TV, so that is something to be aware of. We don't really watch TV all that much, but if it is part of your routine, make sure to bring a laptop or ipad.

We would definitely stay here again.  "
4632923,33034421,2015-05-24,1827089,Sherman,"Margot's apartment was amazing. It had lots of amenities. Towels/linens, full kitchen, and super comfy beds! Great location :)"
4632923,47110603,2015-09-15,4720052,Veronica,"The apartment was clean, conveniently located and had what we needed. Just wish there was a TV ;)"
4632923,48746545,2015-09-28,11953158,Lana,Great apartment. View was amazing. Awesome location. Host was very quick to respond to any questions we had. 
4632923,55296097,2015-11-29,20622370,Diana,"Margot was extremely helpful and very prompt in responding to any questions.  She was a very nice hostess.  We didn't meet her, but she was available for any questions via phone/text.  When we arrived, we were a little confused as to how to get to her apartment., but that's because I did not see her email with the instructions. For me it was a challenge as it does not have an elevator, and the apartment is on the 3rd floor. But, by the second day it was fine and I got better at minimizing the trips by being more organized and not forgetting things in the apartment or the car.

The location is very convenient, and once acclimated I was very comfortable in the neighborhood. Quite a few interesting sites within walking distance - Bruce Lee's gravesite is about 6 blocks away and it's in a beautiful park that includes a museum, lake & just a very peaceful and calming environment.  Bakery Nouveau is a 7 minute walk (5 for most people), and is to die for.  Many restaurant to choose from.  We had a car and it seemed like everyplace was only a 5-20 minute drive.  I found it to be very convenient.

We had 6 for Thanksgiving dinner, and it was a bit of challenge in terms of pots and pans, but we made do and we had a wonderful meal.  There should be plenty of space for 4 people for a short stay. Bed's were comfortable and the whole home was warm & cozy. The furnishing was quaint, so if you're expecting a 5 star hotel,  this is not the place. 

I would choose this place anyday over a cramped hotel. I would not hesitate to recommend this place if your looking to visit Seattle."
1900698,9063578,2013-12-03,2269636,Pavel,"I enjoyed staying in Julia's home. The room is comfortable and clean. The location is very convenient and number of good restaurants and cafeterias are around. Julie is very positive and energized person. I am strongly recommend this place for staying in Seattle weather if you are traveling alone or with somebody else.
Good luck!"
1900698,9187831,2013-12-11,1516656,Nick Fei,"Julie's bedroom bed is so comfortable, it's heaven. The air-con is a bit noisy , but who needs the air-con? The room and the bedding are very warm even if it's the coldest month. Julie is very friendly, and she looks like 15 years younger in person"
1900698,9383329,2013-12-25,8594511,Shuping,nice place
1900698,9623328,2014-01-03,10785825,Kaylee,Had a great experience staying with Julie for the week I had left of my trip. Super comfy bed and had all the essentials. Close to the transit system that will get you to the airport or to downtown Seattle. Julie is a great hostess and can tell you where to go and what places you have to check out. I would defiantly stay here again when I am back up in the area. 
1900698,10302353,2014-02-11,5283732,Thor,"Nice apartment.  Great bed.  Pleasant hostess.  The neighborhood is only so-so, but convenient to the airport."
1900698,10475222,2014-02-20,4102344,Corinne,"Julie was a fantastic host-- she picked us up from the lightrail, even though the house is super close and its an easy walk. Great neigborhood, great house- like the other reviews said, the bed was super comfortable. "
1900698,10711089,2014-03-03,12668677,Lurelle,"Julie was an excellent guest. I appreciated the decor of the house, and her friendliness when I arrived. Check in and check and was extremely easy.

The location is connected with some cool trails, and extremely accessible to the Beacon Hill Neighborhood."
1900698,11068038,2014-03-18,5685656,Vinay,"This was a last minute reservation, Julie was super chill and courteous enough to accommodate and work with my arrival time.  The location is ok, room and bed were comfortable. The place was clean and nice!"
1900698,11199817,2014-03-24,8166039,Lara,"Julie is a really easy going host and it turned out we have some things in common. The room is cozy, but the bed is comfy and there are lots of pillows. For me, it was a convenient place to sleep while I visiting friends who also live in Hillman/Columbia city area over the weekend. Thanks!"
1900698,11334476,2014-03-30,13353490,Kenzie,"Julie was welcoming and friendly, we enjoyed our stay at her house. The house itself was tidy and well kept, and the room was indeed very cozy. "
1900698,12286590,2014-04-28,13317712,Camille,I had a very pleasant stay at Julie’s house. It’s comfortable and clean. Julie was very friendly.
1900698,12667755,2014-05-07,5924931,Colton,Julie was a great host. I didn't get a chance to meet her but she had everything set up. It was nice and cozy and felt like home. The neighborhood was wonderful as well. Very awesome experience.I would stay again. Thanks!
1900698,12769885,2014-05-10,10127894,Diane,"Our stay at Julie's home was perfect. She is kind, left us her kitchen with arrangement to cook, the bedroom is very comfortable and it is easy to park the car in the street. If we have a new journey at Seattle, we shall be delighted to live again at her. Thank you !"
1900698,13050242,2014-05-18,11529333,Ludymila,It was awesome! Really clean and comfortable! And Julie is really nice!
1900698,13117714,2014-05-19,12959749,Kurt,"Julie was sweet and her place was great, exactly as described and good value. "
1900698,13258169,2014-05-23,6167959,Samuel,"It was a nice stay at Julie's place! The neighborhood is quiet, the room is sweet, and most important Julie is very considerate. I run late to get to the house  and Julie got plans that day, but she made sure we were able to get into the house without any trouble.

Julie's collection of novels and movies surprised me. A fan of The Game of Thrones would love to stay here :)"
1900698,13446262,2014-05-27,15244209,Matthew,Although our adventures kept us from seeing Julie that much we couldn't ask for a more relaxing experience. We felt right at home and the room was very clean. Would definitely stay here again when we venture out to Seattle again!
1900698,16706150,2014-08-01,13766485,David,Julie was a very nice host and extremely easygoing.  Her place is very conveniently located near the light rail and bus lines.  She's also very knowledgeable about the local area in Columbia City.  The neighborhood itself is very up-and-coming with a gym and lots of nice restaurants within walking distance.
1900698,17057744,2014-08-06,13278315,Ines,"Julie is a great host! She has to work a lot, so we barely saw her, but every time we did, she was super nice and gave us helpful tips about Seattle!
The room is very cozy and the bed is amazingly comfortable. The bathroom is very clean like the rest of the house too. It is just a short 5-10 minutes walk to get to the light train that brings you directly into the city and the bus stop is even closer!
If you would like to relax one evening and just watch a movie, you are at the right place. Julie has an awesome movie collection for all ages!
We loved our stay and can only recommend Julie and her beautiful house!"
1900698,17107025,2014-08-07,17576162,John,Julie was a wonderful host with a beautiful home in a well placed location. I would definitely recommend staying with her.  
1900698,17448471,2014-08-12,8231750,Amandine,"Julie's appartement was well for a couple days in Seattle : quiet, confortable and affordable. The downtown is easily accessible by bus (30 min, one bus every ten minutes). We haven't seen Julie so much but she was a good host."
1900698,17640843,2014-08-15,18743249,Michelle,"Julie was a great host for the three nights we were in Seattle. We didn't get to see her too much because of our schedules but she was kind enough to let us take advantage of her great movie and tv show collection. Bed was comfy, bathroom was conveniently right next to the bedroom and we never had any issues with parking .  Overall great stay!"
1900698,17723402,2014-08-16,19710471,Brandon,We had an awesome stay at Julie's place...the bed is beyond comfortable. Cool neighbourhood and an easy drive to downtown Seattle...we would definitely stay here again! 
1900698,17956956,2014-08-19,1416394,Calvin,"Julie's place was great! She left specific arrangements to help us settled in the place as we ended up checking in late. Great location, placed in a real secured neighborhood and just a short drive to the downtown. She was always available through her phone. Overall, great experience!
"
1900698,18253696,2014-08-24,7642863,Marie,"Julie was a very hospitable host with tons of recommendations of what to do in Seattle. I felt very welcome. She even invited me to come along on a girls' nightout, so I didn't just feel like a regular traveler on her way through. Julie's spot is a bit further from downtown though, so you'd better be traveling by car - it sometimes took me over an hour using public transport to where I wanted to go in the city. Make sure to check out Columbia City, it's just a few blocks away and has the great bakery in it, with amazing sandwiches, cookies and very tasty coffee!"
1900698,18355600,2014-08-25,19785162,Brad,Great place & great experience!
1900698,18576862,2014-08-28,19927677,Alison,"Convenient location and comfy bed. I didn't see much of Julie because I kept myself so busy, but would definitely recommend a stay here."

Above all, Julie is nice and cute person! She constantly responses very quickly and worth to rely on:) Next time I come back to Seattle, I'll definitely choose her place. Thank you, Julie."
1900698,18943775,2014-09-03,16656432,Jessica,"Very nice room in a nice neighborhood.  We felt very welcome and comfortable in Julie's home.  Great place to stay for a few nights!
"
1900698,19090539,2014-09-06,6371844,Lene,"Julies House lies in a multicultural neighbourhood, the bus stop is just around the corner with some nice bakery´s and restaurants. Julie is a relaxed and nice host, and likes to decorate her house for fall :)
We do recommend her place!"
1900698,19275147,2014-09-09,19300198,Richard,"Located just a short walk away from Ranier Ave., the main drag in eclectic Columbia City neighborhood.  Julie was most helpful and the room was quite comfortable."
1900698,19395239,2014-09-11,19080245,Derek,"Julie was an excellent host. She actually responded back to my request within about 5 minutes of asking its availability. The house was clean, cozy, and the bed is as comfy as described. There is a bus only two blocks from her house which takes you straight downtown. We only had two days in Seattle so we did not get the chance to hang out with Julie as we were charging the city from sun up to sun down. Nonetheless, she was still accommodating and incredibly personable. I would highly recommend staying with Julie if you are in Seattle."
1900698,20018749,2014-09-22,19600469,Yujia,"Love Julie's cozy room, love those pumpkins. It's just same as the picture, and very clean.
Julie's airbnb house is very close to the bus station, and neighbers are safe. Next time I will still choose stay with her.
朱莉很友好，她家离7号公交站很近，7号线基本可以把所有的市中心有名的的景点走完, 很棒。"
1900698,20434242,2014-09-29,9145952,Elizabeth,I only saw Julie once during my three night stay but she had the room set up so I didn't need anything.  I knew she was only a text away if I needed to contact her for anything. The room was exactly as described. The location was perfect for my needs and I would absolutely stay here again the next time I visit my sister in Seattle.  I'm not sure if it's noted in the general description but this wouldn't be a great place to stay if you have mobility issues.  There are two flights of stairs that you need to walk up in order to get to the room.  It's not a problem for me but I can see it being a real problem for others.

1900698,20972249,2014-10-08,1729573,Jeremy,Fantastic! Julie was very hospitable and welcoming. Very relaxed stay. Easy light rail access into the city. Plenty of dining options nearby and all you could need in the kitchen to cook if desired.

Julie est quelqu'un de très agréable et gentille !!"
1900698,21679051,2014-10-21,1747361,Iam (Stephanie),"My stay at Julie's place was great. The apartment is clean and well located. Just one block from the bus stop and a few more down the other direction to all the cute shops and restaurants in the neighborhood. 

Although she was away for most of the day working, she made the effort to spend a little time with me when she was home. She's a great host. "
1900698,21858413,2014-10-25,21042230,Martin,"Julie's place has a warm and cozy feel to it. It's conveniently located to get to Seattle, as well as exploring the various restaurants in Columbia City. I would come back and stay here again."
1900698,22019311,2014-10-28,20624365,Sarah,"My friend and I had a wonderful, short stay at Julie's. The room was clean and comfortable with towels laid out and waiting. Julie is excellent at communicating and responding. She even sent a heads-up that there may be a power outage (which fortunately was not the case when we arrived.) I would easily stay with Julie next time I am in the area.  "
1900698,22364225,2014-11-04,21741791,Linda,Nice 3-story townhome.  Comfy bed.

1900698,22749875,2014-11-13,4981665,Brian,"Not sure what to add from the other reviews.  In short, friendly host, good location with some food options nearby, street parking in the neighbourhood.  

Thanks Julie for making the stay so simple and hasslefree! 

Brian "
1900698,22857205,2014-11-16,1874470,Julie,"Julie was very easygoing about the whole process, even with my many last minute plan changes. The room was comfortable, clean, and the bathroom is close by. She is a gracious hostess."
1900698,23195692,2014-11-24,23948485,Catherine,"Julie was, and undoubtedly still is a great host. Very laid back, open, and easy to talk to. Bed was very comfortable, and public transport not too far away. Would definitely recommend staying with Julie while in Seattle, and would do so again myself."
1900698,23781626,2014-12-09,22002597,Chee Lam,The reservation was canceled 21 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
1900698,28584093,2015-03-26,29586243,Gerie,"Awesome place, wonderful host. Julie is adorable with a capital A. She is a friend if you want one, a ghost if you don't. The place is gorgeous and near many great amenities. I would recommend to anyone staying in Seattle"
1900698,29463292,2015-04-07,30131124,Franck,"Excellent stay at Julie's place. Quiet and very clean house. We really enjoyed our stay!

1900698,29900021,2015-04-13,30729849,Andrew,"We had to book last minute because other plans fell through, Julie was on top of everything and made us feel welcome, the light was on for us, and we had a good night sleep both of the nights we stayed. The place isn't far from downtown. She was very pleasant and accommodating."
1900698,30562096,2015-04-24,3450612,Mark,Julies place was great. She was very well-prepared and accommodated me with any information I needed. She also checked-in periodically if she had schedule changes  in case I needed anything which I thought was very professional and kind. Her place is quiet and easy to get to. The Columbia City portion of Seattle has a nice downtown with a pretty good sports bar and a couple live music venues. Parking was a cinch. 
1900698,31528119,2015-05-06,2494842,Joseph,"I stayed in Julie's room for 6 days at the beginning of May. Julie was out of town the entire time, so I did not meet her.  She was extremely prompt in responding to my emails before and during the stay."

1900698,34423546,2015-06-08,27028367,Belle,Flight came in late and Julie was very accommodating to our situation we had no trouble getting to our room.  Although we didn't meet her we did feel very comfortable sleeping at her place.  
1900698,34736600,2015-06-11,28883377,Ken,"My stay at Julie's was good; it was during a series of extremely hot days, and she was kind enough to have a fan set up and running when I arrived.  Thank you Julie. "
1900698,35820493,2015-06-22,27975995,Glacen Mae,The place was perfect for our short stay in Seattle. Julie provided very detailed directions which definitely helped us when having to check in.  We were provided everything that we needed.  We saw her only once during our stay and she was lovely.  I would recommend staying here if you are traveling by yourself or with one other person.
1900698,36070129,2015-06-24,627570,David,"The listing was entirely accurate. I was pretty busy during this trip and Julie was always kind and open, but also let me be. The house and neighborhood is quiet. All around good experience."
1900698,36237134,2015-06-26,24634685,Jennifer,"Listing description was accurate. It was a fairly short trip, Julie made it super easy for me to get to her place from the airport & helped settle me in nicely. "
1900698,36404110,2015-06-28,9836072,Diana,Wonderful stay with Julie. She has a closet full of bath products in case you forget something. The bed is super comfortable too. She makes you feel right at home!
1900698,36785208,2015-07-01,31022769,Reina,Living in Julie's house is definitely a good experience! Her house is cozy n convenient to the downtown!
1900698,37329834,2015-07-06,1485689,Corinna,Julie is a really nice person and she is very easygoing. Her townhouse is great located. We had a rental car and no Problems finding a parking spot. To downtown the bus is only one block away. At last i have to say that this is not the cleanest place we have stayed at. But it worked out for us. We would come back to Julie. 
1900698,37912407,2015-07-11,37259716,Jason,"Great first airbnb experience. Accurate description of the listing all around. Slept extremely well on a very comfortable bed each night of my stay. Staying with Julie felt more like staying with a friend. She was very welcoming and instantly made me feel at home. The conversations alone is reason enough to return again, but I will book again next time Im in town for comfort of the room and local restaurants as well.. 10/10"
1900698,38130847,2015-07-13,19362661,Luisa,Julie was a wonderful host! Her home was comfy and welcoming. There were many places to go in her neighborhood and she provided great suggestions. It was also a short drive to downtown and capital hill. We would definitely recommend staying here and this would be our go to if we came to visit again! Many thanks!
1900698,39205195,2015-07-21,21935070,Roni,Julie was such a delight! She is a great host and her place was very pleasant to stay at. There are some really great restaurants just a short walk away. Very safe and diversed neighborhood. I would definitely recommend staying with her.
1900698,39691399,2015-07-25,38683495,Joanna,Julie's place is cozy and quiet in a nice community. We had a perfect stay. Close to the rail and there are dozens of places to eat in the neighborhood. She had some great recommendations. Hope her place is available next time we go back.
1900698,40337048,2015-07-30,35724552,Bryce,Great little place to spend a week. Good location and everything was clean. :)

1900698,40894058,2015-08-03,30564974,Joe,"I deeply appreciated having a clean, secure and cooled room within 30 minutes walking distance of Seafair @ Genessee Park, about 15 minutes to Columbia City Light Rail Station, and less than 10 for Geraldine's for Breakfast.  Not to mention a 5 minute walk to the King County Metro Route 7.  I really liked being able to just plop my stuff down and mind my own business while I photog'd Seafair 2015 as a photojournalist & writer for the Whidbey Daily."
1900698,41409871,2015-08-07,26270429,Richard,"I had a great experience at Julie's. Parking was easy to find. I used light rail every day. Julie was a helpful and gracious host. The room  and bathroom were clean. Like guests before me, I found the bed very comfortable. There were many interesting shops and restaurants within walking distance. I would love to stay here when I travel to Seattle again."
1900698,42677959,2015-08-15,32650877,Nicholas,"I'll write less about the listing (you get a super comfortable room in a beautiful home situated in a diverse neighbourhood, which gives you the authentic Seattle experience, and truthfully you can just read the description). Instead I'll tell you about Julie, who is an absolutely amazing human being. Generally when someone describes themselves as funny, it's a major red flag. But I have to say (and hopefully this doesn't raise expectations too high) that Julie is genuinely funny and awesome to hang out with at the occasional breakfast time or in the evenings, when her schedule allows. Even more so, when I had a minor catastrophe at the car rental place on my last day, she went way above and beyond to help me and make sure I got to my next destination as planned - I can't imagine too many other hosts would have done the same. She truly makes you feel welcome and I couldn't recommend a stay with Julie highly enough."
1900698,43123644,2015-08-17,32549219,Wen,Comfortable room and clean bathroom.I had two quiet and safe nights with my mom.Our first place in America.Pretty and kind Julie. 
1900698,43506245,2015-08-20,37280826,Sasha,"I had a great time staying at Julie's. The room was nice and the bed was super comfortable, as other reviewers have said. The house was in a nice area and was close to many restaurants (including Geraldine's Counter, an awesome breakfast place that's only around a 5 minute a walk away!). There were several bus routes a close walk by and it took around 45 minutes to get to downtown by bus. Also, Julie was a great host. She was very welcoming and friendly and helped me to see other parts of Seattle that I wouldn't have otherwise seen. She is easy to talk to and a great conversationalist! I would definitely stay with Julie again both because of Julie herself and because of her home. "
1900698,44693189,2015-08-28,13830814,Al,Great find! Very nice place with the #7 bus right down on the corner.
1900698,45280695,2015-09-01,13550110,Ivan,"Julie was amazing, very easy to contact. She also replied emails and text really quickly. She was extremely kind and friendly in person and online. The place was nice and clean, we love how soft and comfortable the bed was. Parking was also easy, since there was a lot of around her place. If you don't mind walking, there was some nice food places around the area as well. Overall, I would highly recommend Julie's place again. In fact we plan to book with her again next time we visit Seattle."
1900698,45520140,2015-09-03,42434653,徒西斯de启示录,居住房间还算干净，只是所在位置不尽理想，似乎是比较早期的城区。有点像北京南城改造以前的概念，比如龙须沟什么的，虽不至于那么严重，但人文方面有点像。
1900698,46296086,2015-09-09,7322851,Carolina,"Although we only met briefly, Julie was a wonderful host and made sure we were taken care of.  Her house is very clean and comfortable and I especially loved her recommendations in the city.  I would definitely forward her place to any Seattle visitors in the future!  "
1900698,46713262,2015-09-13,18270865,Alyssa,"My fiance and I had a great stay with Julie! When we arrived she gave us a quick tour of her super cute home. The room was clean and comfortable. She provided maps and guides of Seattle as well as a list of some of her favorite restaurants in the neighborhood, which was very helpful. (We actually tried them all and we were not disappointed!) The 7 bus is a short walk from Julie's home, which made it super easy to get to downtown Seattle. Overall we had a great time here and Julie was a wonderful host!"
1900698,52066087,2015-10-26,417062,Kendra,"The apartment was quaint and cozy as promised.  Julie's directions were perfect from the Link and Columbia City has a real ""home town"" vibe to it.  Julie gave us some restaurant choices that were very tasty and nearby.  Julie was very responsive to all our needs even though she was away for the weekend.  Great host!"
1900698,52824766,2015-11-02,40993742,Grace,"Julie was a wonderful hostess! She was there when we arrived to give us a tour and show us  her place. The bed was super comfortable and the space was very comfortable. She is very close to public transportation which was a huge plus for us since we did have a car. She even offered to pick us up from the light rail on our first night so we wouldn't have to drag our luggage in the rain. She was very easy to communicate with and we texted back and forth several times throughout our stay. 
This was my first experience with Airbnb, and Julie did a wonderful job making me feel comfortable and excited about using the service in the future. "
6561753,35150285,2015-06-15,34671110,Pete,"IOHouse was the perfect place to stay in Seattle. The hosts helped me pick a room that worked with my dates. My schedule had me arrive very late, but it was no worries. Everything was as expected and advertised. 

I felt completely welcome and safe. Everyone was super friendly and the diverse mix made for a very interesting and accepting environment. The house was clean (especially the shower, yay!) and my bunk was comfortable. 

Location is awesome. Great food and coffee a block away. Easy bus and Uber access to downtown. 

This was a perfect hostel to stay at, and I would absolutely stay again. 
"
6561753,36042225,2015-06-24,21687926,Iain,"Everything was as described: this is a hostel for folks in the tech industry and beyond.  Folks starting their careers or reinventing them. 

The location is superb; Capitol Hill is a wonderful neighborhood and you can get pretty much anywhere you need to go.

It's early days yet for the annex, but even in the time I was here the amenities were improved.  Beds are clean, the floorplan is spacious and open.  There's a grocery store nearby and plenty of cooking equipment, so it's possible to eat inexpensively or at any number of fantastic restaurants.

But the main thing is the people and they were great."
6561753,38406875,2015-07-15,8712088,William,The location is very good. There are a lot of people here but everyone there during my visit was very nice. The house also has a sweet balcony.
6561753,40521556,2015-07-31,37550965,Andre,Listing is accurate. A bunk in a cool house in a cool neighborhood.
6561753,41791931,2015-08-09,37244577,Cao,"It has been a good experience. I met some interesting people with good personality. I enjoyed talking to them. The room is spacious and the matress is firm, which I found very comfortable."
6561753,42762944,2015-08-15,39975054,Ji Hwan,"My main purpose was to give a presentation in four-day-conference at WSCC, and after that I did travel for three days. Overall, I had an excellent experience and wonderful time :) Details are as below;

1. Location : Here, you can really feel what the life of Seattle is. From the downtown Seattle, it takes around 35-minute-walk to this place. 

2. Distance : I like walking, so I walked to and back from University of Washington, Pike Place Market, Space Needle and Washington State Convention Center. It is kind of up-hill when you are from the downtown, but that means it is down-hill to the downtown, which really helps when you are going to downtown.

3. Transportation : Bus system is very good to the downtown. From and to Tacoma airport, you can take Link Light Rail and it is super convenient.

4. Room : You will going to share one room and one bathroom with four people including you. It is not as convenient as super-expensive hotel, but it is clean and cozy enough, and you can have opportunities of hanging-out with friend who will share the room with you. You can also do laundry.

5. Food : There are seriously good cafes near this place.

I strongly recommend this place to anybody, and definitely I will try to get a room again here if I have chance to visit Seattle next time."
6561753,44026839,2015-08-23,4876612,Shaun,"Andrew's place was just as described.  It was a very nice shared place with a lot of cool and interesting people in a great location.  People had lots of great stories, and were overall awesome.  They even had a big potluck the Thursday I was there with everyone from both houses.  Surprisingly (given that it's a shared space) everything was also very clean and in good condition as well.  If you can handle staying in a shared space, I would definitely recommend the Io Annex."
6561753,45405376,2015-09-02,40631742,Michael,"Great location with a comfortable bed and easy access. Check in is no-hassle, despite arriving late in the evening.

Thanks Ken!"
3946160,19549991,2014-09-14,10996930,Sunny,"We had a delightful stay in Ken's studio apartment.  The sofa bed was very comfortable, the kitchen convenient and the bathroom spacious.  The location was ideal for a short walk to downtown or a quick walk to the number 7 which goes to downtown Seattle .  Lots of ethnic restaurants close to the apartment."
3946160,19975967,2014-09-21,15498771,Donald,"I enjoyed my brief stay here.  Ken was a good host, and the unit had all the essentials. This is a great spot for anyone who will be traveling on Amtrak. "

3946160,20295542,2014-09-27,13418407,Chris,Kens place was really nice and had all the modern comforts that you would need. Location is a short bus ride or a 30-40 min walk to Downtown and the flat is in a nice area. Ken lives adjacent to the studio which makes it really easy if you have any questions about Seattle. Overall very satisfied!
3946160,20372545,2014-09-28,21225258,Eugene,We had a great stay with Ken. His place was clean and cozy and he was very helpful. He even organized a taxi for us. We would recommend it.

3946160,21613003,2014-10-20,21856187,Amy,Kens place was perfect for our 3 night stay in Seattle.. The place was small but it was nice!! The sofa bed was comfy and my boyfriend and I had a great nights sleep. Ken was also very easy to get ahold of when planning our trip. Thanks! :)
3946160,21733958,2014-10-22,14928454,Sarah,"A very comfy, clean, well-equipped spot for my out-of-town friend. Ken was a responsive and very respectful host. "
3946160,21837209,2014-10-25,19349899,Paul,"Ken's studio is fantastic!  The bed was super comfortable, and the kitchen is great if you're interested in self-catering.  The location is great, as well - a cheap cab ride or Uber to downtown, but also easily walkable to the stadiums/train station/light rail.  Wish I could have stayed longer!"
3946160,22038399,2014-10-28,10210352,Ryan,"Ken is great! The studio is perfect for a short stay. Ken was extremely responsive with all of my questions, even when I contacted several times very late in the evening. The studio is in close proximity to everything and is a close drive/uber ride to all major areas. The airport is only a 15-20 min drive and is very easy to access the highway from here. I would definitely recommend this place!"
3946160,22080021,2014-10-29,5015274,Sachi,"Ken was great.  He was easy to communicate with and helpful when we got a little bit lost on our way to the studio.  The place was clean and even had complimentary beverages in the fridge.  

Most impressively, when my traveling companion left a pair of pants behind, Ken found them and offered to ship them home (I will pay for shipping, of course).  Thanks for going the extra mile, Ken!  "
3946160,22222991,2014-11-01,23155691,Bryan,"This was a great value. Very nice, clean. Perfect for a place to crash while visiting the city. Complimentary beverages were greatly appreciated. Our host, Ken, was very accommodating and friendly. Wonderful, helpful communication! Best first experience I could have imagined with airbnb. Thank you! We'll be back!"

3946160,22414901,2014-11-05,2374451,Tim,"Really easy experience staying at Ken's. He was even nice enough to leave us a few drinks in the fridge. The keyless entry made checking in easy, and on our schedule which was super convenient. Ken even checked in once via text just to see if there was anything else we needed. "
3946160,22697177,2014-11-12,17636672,Christy,"Ken is a nice host, been responsive to all queries and welcomed me on my arrival. The place is clean and cozy, as shown and described. Bed was comfortable enough for a sofa bed. It's in a quiet leafy location with a small Park. Quick and easy, single bus ride to downtown. Pleasant stay in overall :) 
Thanks again."
3946160,22756859,2014-11-13,22303973,Travis,"I had a little trouble finding it because it's tucked away into an alley, and I was driving in the dark. The description was completely accurate. The room was tidy and the internet was fast. There were free drinks in the fridge, and the shower was pleasant. I only stayed one evening, and it was perfect for what I needed."
3946160,22975741,2014-11-18,23866348,Abraham,"Waking up in Seattle was a magnificent feeling! What made it really genuine was the comfort of Kens private studio. Very clean and warm. Location was Great! Ken was very helpful and stayed in touch just in case i had questions. I can't wait to visit the Emerald city and when I do, I will make sure to book again."
3946160,23026614,2014-11-20,23830203,Kay,"Ken was an amazing host, he provided us with quality answers on what restaurants we should try and gave us the insider/local scoop on where the ""underground"" ones are. He took the time to make us feel at home by greeting us in person and we chatted for a little bit about other restaurants that might interest us. This is huge because both of us are foodies and the main purpose for our travel is to be able to try amazing food vendors. Thanks a lot Ken! If I visit again, I would stay here again!"
3946160,23109368,2014-11-23,20290685,Rachel,Ken's private studio was exactly as described and he was nice enough to leave complimentary drinks in the fridge for us. No disturbances and no trouble coming and going as we pleased. AMAZING location - very close to the interstate and downtown Seattle. It made for a very quick commute no matter the destination. Ken checked in with us throughout our stay to make sure we were happy with our accommodations. 
3946160,23276716,2014-11-27,7698953,Kelvin,"We stayed in Kens place for about a week and it was a great experience. Ken is beyond helpful if you need help with the local area or advice, and regularly makes sure things are going smoothly. The place is clean and in a great location. Cant really ask for much more than that. "
3946160,23307245,2014-11-28,23740973,Kallie,Kens place was exactly as described. Perfect for a few nights in Seattle. Close to downtown and Capitol Hill.

"
3946160,23855074,2014-12-12,1479513,Kristina,"Ken's studio was a wonderful place to stay in Seattle. It was just as the pictures looked and enough space for two of us to sleep for two nights. It was clean and had everything we needed. The pull out bed was actually one of the most comfortable I've ever slept on. The small fridge, microwave, toaster and coffee maker was perfect for breakfast before heading out to explore the city. 

It was very conveniently located off the main freeways and easy to commute anywhere in the surrounding area. And although close to the freeway, was extremely quiet during the night. 

Ken was very easy to communicate with about arrival time and providing us with suggestions for places or restaurants to visit. We would definitely stay here again. Thanks Ken!

"
3946160,23948694,2014-12-15,1532507,Arturo,"Ken pretty much went out of his way to make us feel welcome and comfortable. He made himself available whenever we had questions or just wanted to talk about Seattle, and he was more than accessible through phone contact over the weekend. Ken is extremely nice and accommodating; he did a great job as a host. Also, his place is conveniently located sort of sandwiched near the Central District and the International District so Seattle's Chinatown isn't too far of a walk or bus ride away and there are plenty of local establishments within walking distances. The neighborhood is nice and quiet; there are I think at least two parks (Judkins and another) a couple minutes away via walking if you want to hang around outside. Ken's place is also luckily just a few yards away from a bus stop on the #7 route so getting around isn't a problem. If I come back to Seattle in the near future, which I'm definitely leaning toward, I would use Ken's place again without hesitation."
3946160,24088044,2014-12-19,24498617,Sijun,"It's a really awesome experience. The place is clean, comfortable, and convenient. The bus station is only 3 mins walk, really close to downtown. This is the first time I booked my accommodation using airbnb, it turns out it is a brilliant idea. The host is really nice, and at last we became friends.  We had a lot of fun together and we have a lot of things in common. If you want a quiet place, and feel the city more, this is your best choice. If next I'm going to visit this city, I will definitely choose to stay here. "
3946160,24269269,2014-12-24,22383140,Cece,"The room is exactly as the same as the pics, very clean and cozy. Drinks are offered in the fridge. Great experience."

Ken was very accommodating and texted us on our first day to see if we needed anything. The location is close to the Link train and we would uber it the nearest station just because it was too cold to walk there. I would definitely recommend this place or stay here again!"
3946160,24882087,2015-01-03,24914536,Diana,"My boyfriend and I were looking for a small and cozy place for our last-minute getaway to Seattle and this private studio caught our attention. The place looked just like the pictures shown on the listing--clean, comfortable, & cozy. It had everything we needed for our short stay. The location of this private studio was pretty convenient as well. The host, Ken, was really friendly and helpful with giving us restaurant suggestions. Overall, our experience was great!

3946160,25419078,2015-01-15,8778617,David,"Ken was a very considerate and accommodating host. He met me a little early to drop my bags off before checkin.

There was even a great coffee maker with all the trimmings, and the kitchen & bathroom were stocked with a few nice bonuses to make the stay that much more comfy. A+"

I am happy to report I agree with all the nice things other previous guests had to say. The space is very neat and inviting. Ken is very easy to communicate with. I unfortunately did not meet him face to face (as I had hoped) but his housekeeper was my point of contact and very professional and courteous. Hopefully if I am able to return this property will be available again :) thanks again Ken!! 
3946160,26003401,2015-02-01,20633994,Priscilla,"Ken was an amazing host! He was really accommodating and the pictures looked exactly like place. When we arrived, there were waters and coffee for the Keurig. I would definitely book this spot again next time I'm in the area. "
3946160,26088821,2015-02-02,21234894,Jessica,The apartment was exactly as described. The bed was comfortable and everything was very clean. The location is great.

Bed was comfy, water was hot, & luckily my boyfriend is from San Fran so parking on the hill was not a problem! We got a chance to meet him as we were both leaving at the same time. He was very welcoming, chatted with us for a couple of minutes & recommended a local coffee shop down the street. Thank you, Ken!"

3946160,26684420,2015-02-17,18337416,Morgan,"Ken was extremely communicative and friendly throughout the entire experience.  From the moment I booked to the moment my boyfriend and I left, Ken made sure we felt welcome and had everything we needed.  He even got the room ready early so we could rest after our flight to Seattle. 

The listing looked exactly at pictured and described--clean, cozy, and even a bit bigger than expected.  There's a large closet to store luggage and clothing, the fridge was stocked with some drinks and even creamer for the coffee Ken provided (very thoughtful!).  Another perk: keypad entry for the door.  No need to worry about losing keys or returning them at the end of the stay!  

Overall, the studio more than met our needs for a 4-day stay in Seattle, and Ken was a great host.   Thanks so much for a wonderful trip!"
3946160,26867628,2015-02-21,1142761,Caitlin,"Everything was wonderful!  The room was SUPER clean..cleaner then hotel rooms I think.  It was a quiet neighborhood.

You have total privacy it was a pleasant surprise to see a few beverages in the fridge that you can help yourself to. The room was accurately described it had a quality feel to it as soon as you walked through the door you didn't need to meet the owner as he supplied a pin code that gives you entry into the room . The 7 bus is a 5 minute walk to the 1-90 have exact change for $2.25 fare this takes you to downtown, the Internet was very fast, there was no oven/cooktop, and TV but we already knew that from the description of the room would defiantly stay again thanks Ken.

3946160,27317655,2015-03-02,5250132,Joanne,"My friend and I loved staying here for our weekend trip. We didn't expect the hill climb, but Seattle seems to be full of hills anyway. The studio is compact, clean, and comfortable. The kitchenette was stocked with utensils & drinks which were really appreciated! Pretty close to all the downtown spots, and a 10 minute rail ride from King Street Station. Would recommend to anyone staying in Seattle that doesn't like the artificial feeling of a hotel. "
3946160,27526294,2015-03-06,1599037,Charles,Ken's place is very comfortable and cozy. The coffee/tea Kuerig is great! He was Johnny-on-the-spot with instructions and answered a couple of questions I had even though it was a late booking. I will definitely try and stay here again the next time I'm in Seattle!
3946160,27576481,2015-03-08,18286140,Celia,"Ken is a cool guy and a great host. He offered us tips around the area and even let us use his beautiful kitchen upstairs. Overall, a really clean and cozy apartment with a surprisingly comfortable pull-out bed. Would definitely recommend."
3946160,27780416,2015-03-11,27355891,Hidetoshi,I stayed at Ken’s studio for two nights. He is very responsive and I didn’t have any communication issues. I like the location. Easy access to downtown. Good view from the top of the hill. The studio was clean and comfortable. Everything was tidy. He gave me a recommendation for sightseeing spot in Seattle and every spot was very nice. Thank you very much!
3946160,27894003,2015-03-14,14522637,Lisa,"Thoroughly enjoyed our 2-night visit to Seattle. We stayed in Ken's studio and appreciated his comfortable accommodations and thoughtful amenities. Over the duration of our visit, Ken was readily available by phone for information. 

We brought a car and street parking was plentiful next to the apartment. 

Would definitely rent again from Ken during future trips to Seattle!"
3946160,27971280,2015-03-15,28989403,Julian,"Lovely, cozy place in a good location. The place was clean and there were drinks in the fridge. Bathroom and kitchen were very clean; great experience overall"
3946160,28207229,2015-03-20,26927259,Ali,I couldn't have asked for a better space and host. Completely private studio. Ken checked in on me every day. Nice and clean. I slept like a rock. My only complaint is that the space isn't available for my next trip to Seattle!
3946160,28279235,2015-03-21,14106540,Tommy,"Ken's apartment was great. Quiet, super clean and conveniently located. He had water, beer, sodas, and coffee in the fridge! It's a simple apartment with a couch bed (comfortable:), clean kitchen and bathroom. Parking was effortless and when we drove to the airport it only took 20 minutes.  We needed a flexible check in time as we weren't arriving until late at night and Ken made it effortless with the door code. He responds to messages immediately and I would definitely recommend staying here while in Seattle. "
3946160,29055035,2015-04-03,1902672,Gauthier,"Actually on a one month road trip, I wanted to discover Seattle in a few days and to be honest, Ken's house was perfect for that. The place is quiet, very clean and you re welcomed with sodas and beers in the fridge "
3946160,29168438,2015-04-05,5555721,Cheryl And Sunny,"We really liked this private studio, it was clean, quiet, and comfortable, and comes as described. We appreciated that Ken checked in on us and replied to messages promptly. You can enter the studio with a door code - super convenient and easy. The location was great too. We decided to walk one day to Chinatown instead of taking the car and it is only about a 20min walk. "
3946160,29411407,2015-04-07,28409135,Gloria,"My first airbnb experience and Ken set the bar pretty high for future hosts. Great location for anyone visiting Seattle (5-10 min from everything!), kept immaculately clean, and this comfy loft had everything we needed! A keurig coffee machine was just an extra icing on top. Wish we stayed for longer than a night, but I'll definitely be back and recommending this stay to all my friends who are planning to visit Seattle!"
3946160,29595660,2015-04-10,14150712,Thea,"We had a great time staying at Ken's place! Definitely felt like a home, and just a short buss ride from the heart of Seattle. There were even complimentary drinks, shampoo, soap and more. We would absolutely stay at his place over a hotel again. "
3946160,29773575,2015-04-12,14910781,Michael,Communication was great. The place is just like the pictures describe. The neighborhood was okay. The complementary drinks came in handy and were a great surprise. Ken is great.

It's relatively close to downtown, either a short bus trip or a longish walk. If I return to Seattle I will absolutely stay here. Thanks Ken!"
3946160,30975636,2015-04-30,15152679,Patricia,"Ken's downtown studio was ideally located a short bus ride from Seattle. The studio is spacious, clean, and filled with natural light. The drinks in the fridge were a nice plus. I will definitely stay here again. "
3946160,31286371,2015-05-04,1549391,Gordon,"Nice cosy studio apartment that is just 20 - 30mins bus (No. 7) ride to downtown, Pike's Market and some of the lovely attractions in Seattle.   Ken is a really nice guy, invited us to his gathering and also helped us arranged to have our luggage to be stored in his place after we checked out as our flight was much later.   :)"
3946160,31506547,2015-05-06,25975041,Gary,Ken and his studio were great! His studio is located in the international district which is near downtown and public transportation. The studio was clean and included everything we needed for a comfortable stay. He worked with us on the check in time and quickly answered any questions we had before and during our stay. 
3946160,31700203,2015-05-09,22657593,Ken,"Very nice, quiet, clean studio.  Great location, near downtown.  Ken was always available in case of a problem. Highly recommend."

3946160,32240838,2015-05-16,7754265,Saeyeun,"Nice place! The studio is clean and cozy, bathroom is also very clean. It's a little far from downtown, but bus stop is really close to house. Ken is kindly and thoughtful host! He prepared some beer, water and coffee! It was really nice. I highly recommend Ken's studio."
3946160,32677544,2015-05-20,25564881,Graham,"My wife and I had a great time staying at Ken's place which is very accessible for all that Seattle has to offer. This was our 2nd Airbnb experience and we were a bit worried about check in, as we were arriving early in the morning. 

However Ken was there and took our bags, as arranged and we went off to explore downtown via the No 7 bus until the studio was ready. 

On our return Ken explained everything to us. The accommodation was excellent, clean, tidy and is exactly, as described and shown in the pics. The beverage and bathroom package were welcome additions."
3946160,32883782,2015-05-23,28070819,Ben,"We had a great stay in this apartment! The space was clean and comfortable, and Ken was very accommodating! It's a little ways from downtown, so if you don't have a car, expect to take a bus or Uber. The ceilings are very thin, so we could hear talking, alarm clocks, etc, which kept us awake longer than our eastern time-zoned bodies would have liked, but I don't fault Ken for that. Overall a great visit to Seattle!"
3946160,33449777,2015-05-28,31830866,Alfred,A++ would definitely stay again. Immaculately clean and near to transit. Thoughtful attention to detail by our host. Thanks for everything Ken!

3946160,33809110,2015-06-01,12606101,B. Bea,"Ken's studio was clean, conveniently located and his directions to the studio were clear. The keyless entry was also very convenient. I really appreciated the little extra touches: water & other beverages in the fridge, coffee pods available for the Keurig, plenty of hangers in the closet, and nice, thick towels."
3946160,34112001,2015-06-04,20826906,Arman,"Everything I needed. Very comfortable bed, good wifi, nice kitchen and bathroom, good location. A great value. The studio was professionally kept, and felt like a hotel suite more than anything. Drinks in the fridge and having coffee available were a nice bonus"
3946160,34279578,2015-06-07,27926385,Damian,"Our stay was very comfortable.   The unit is a keyless entry which makes access very convenient.  Ken was very accommodating at allowing us to checkin early.  We met Ken once so he could welcome us and give us some of the highlights of the city.  He did assure us he would be available if we did need anything and he would check in periodically.  The unit had everything that we needed, including all the hotel basics such as fresh towels, soap/shampoo, extra pillows, and coffee maker.  The unit did not have a television but the fast wifi made up for this and we did not spend much time in the unit anyway.  The bed is a fold out and turned out to be quite comfortable if you like a firm mattress.   We were able to easily get downtown using the bus which runs every 10 minutes or so.  It was about a 20 minute walk to the international district.  The unit is in a quiet residential neighborhood.  I would recommend staying here if you want to avoid paying the higher cost of staying downtown."
3946160,34633113,2015-06-10,14856354,John Paul,"Ken was very accommodating.  The apartment was a cozy, quiet space, plenty of amenities, close to the freeway to get downtown.  Ken checked on us via text to offer any assistance or make recommendations about local sights.  We had a full itinerary so we never needed his help, but it was nice to know he offered.  Would definitely recommend to others."
3946160,35286884,2015-06-17,27275196,Erika,"We stayed at Ken's studio for a week in June. We had a great stay.
The place was exactly as shown in the pictures. The place was clean and cosy. Check-in was smooth and easy. 
Ken was a great host. We made sure we had everything we needed (includning drinks in the fridge, the and coffee). 
We can surely recommend staying at Ken's place in Seattle."
3946160,35390752,2015-06-18,33118755,Elliot,"Great experience, the property was located close to the stadiums and it was easy to grab an uber down town!

3946160,35635334,2015-06-21,27784752,Alisa,The location is perfect for exploring Seattle. Close to public transportation and not too far to even walk to downtown. Ken made sure we were comfortable and provided recommendations for places to eat.

3946160,37031817,2015-07-04,14561141,Lucinda,"Ken made us feel very welcome by quickly responding to texts before arrival and even texting us 1/2 way through our stay to see if we were ok and needed anything or any recommendations about what sights to check out.  
The neighborhood was clean and the condos in the area are newer.  The unit is just as it’s pictured and was very clean.  A great place to stay!
Downtown was a quick drive away. "

3946160,38579646,2015-07-17,4481064,Sean,"Ken has the details down! Most importantly this place is great, quiet and secure. The bathroom and kitchen are beautiful, functional and newly renovated. The fridge had a few beverage options (nice touch). There was a nice, quiet fan to keep things extra cool. "
3946160,38713915,2015-07-18,1790521,Bren,Great little apartment. Exactly as described. It was perfect for two of us in town for a soccer game at CenturyLink field which was a short Uber ride away. 
3946160,38840932,2015-07-19,32087018,Todd,Very neat clean new room. Free drinks were nice. 
3946160,39729780,2015-07-26,25176152,Laura,Ken's studio apt was perfect for our stay in Seattle. The place was very clean and the perfect size for our party of two. Ken is a great host. He left us coffee and beer and checked in with us to see if we needed anything. He gave us great recommendations for one of the days when it rained. The apt is located close to many bus stops and is about a $6-$7 uber ride from Pike's Market. We even walked downtown one day which took about 15-20 minutes. I would definitely stay at Ken's apt again and I recommend it to others. Thanks for the hospitality Ken! We had a great stay!

3946160,40937302,2015-08-03,34956701,Scott,Kens place was wonderful. It was in a quiet location just outside of the city. Very clean and organized. He was readily available for anything we needed. Parking was free on the street which is a huge plus. Bed was comfortable. Bathroom was clean with all the necessities you need. Kitchen was well stocked. Offers drinks that are in the mini-fridge. Very accommodating. Will definitely stay again! 
3946160,41326534,2015-08-07,31175724,Carl,"Ken's place is exactly as depicted on the website, except that the bed is dedicated, not morphable into a couch. I stayed with a friend and we shared the bed quite comfortably. It was exactly what we were looking for: clean and simple. The provided beverages were also quite welcome. 

Ken also accommodated our early arrival by allowing us to drop our bags off when we arrived in town, then we adventured until later that evening. "

3946160,43932312,2015-08-23,17942599,Den,"Ken is great. Excellent and timely communication. Offers to assist with local eateries or other venues nearby. Studio was well stocked with kitchen essentials and bath needs, (check kitchen before you head to grocery, many staples are stocked) Bed was very comfortable, and studio is downstairs from his residence in a quiet neighborhood. It is very close to city/ Seattle, making trips into downtown less than 10 minutes away. "
3946160,44546457,2015-08-27,700755,Barbara,"Ken's place is very clean, nice and cozy.  The bed is very comfy.  Thanks for hosting us!"
3946160,44779561,2015-08-29,36355817,Daniel,Got in really late. The place was a little difficult to find. Don't believe I was informed of the apartment letter. The experience while stay was great. Bed was already set up. Some water and coffee provided at no charge. Bathroom was fine with the exception of the shower drain being backed up
3946160,46164790,2015-09-08,18518268,Kathleen,Ken's studio was very clean and in a great location. Street parking was very easy.  He was friendly and communicative and checked in with us during our stay. I would highly recommend Ken's place for your Seattle stay!

3946160,47967571,2015-09-22,37633105,Lacey,"Overall, Ken's place did just the job we needed it to! It is much smaller than we anticipated, but we didn't need too much space to begin with. We had some issues with hot water, I had 2 showers that were luke warm. The place was VERY clean with the exception of a full trash can on arrival, we were unable to find where to take out the trash so we just kept piling it on. 

Ken was really responsive to all the questions we had, and gave great recommendations on places to eat! Would definitely stay here again!"
3946160,48153524,2015-09-23,12205870,Mackenzie,"Ken's home was located in a quiet area near the bike trail and very convenient to downtown! The free parking was a plus as well. Despite Ken being out of the country, he communicated with me and was able to accommodate on short notice. "
3946160,48690207,2015-09-28,4532938,Anne,"Ken's place is about a 10 min uber ride to pike's place. The place it self was perfect for a weekend getaway. There were bath and kitchen essentials for your use. He even had drinks in the fridge for us to enjoy. There wasn't a tv in the studio but that was fine but it's just an FYI for anyone who needs a TV. But in all, the place was perfect for our little weekend get away. "

It was in a quiet neighborhood, with a walking distance to parks and lot's of restaurants. We had Vietnamese Pho and Bun in a nearby restaurant. They were so good!!

I will recommend Ken's place for your stay in Seattle.

3946160,50641588,2015-10-13,34115534,Dao,"Loved this apartment. Extremely clean and cozy. Private entrance is a nice touch.  Location isn't walkable to downtown but only just about a $10 uber ride to downtown, and it was always pretty easy to call one. Also some great Vietnamese pho places within walking distance. We only saw Ken once when he dropped off a brand new ironing board and iron that we needed to prepare for a wedding -- wow, what a great host!"
3946160,50815265,2015-10-14,46146244,Stefanie,"Prior to 2 days before I book, I did not even know about Air B & B. The unit was as described. The unit is just three miles off Capital Hill ,y primary location
Ken was very responsive to my questions and exceptional helpful with dining reservations. unit entrance was a challenge. Ken was available by phone and help me find the door. I can see that trying to find the unit after dark could be a challenge.
Ken did visit with me  after I returned from dinner
I definitely would stay again
Finding the "
3946160,51050081,2015-10-17,34689170,Mj,Ken was friendly and very accommodating. The place was clean and neat and included great amenities. Quiet neighborhood with decent distance to downtown Seattle.
3946160,52044548,2015-10-26,17625134,Tammy,Ken was really resourceful and accommodating with my stay. He gave me lots of recommendations and made everything for the room comfortable. The room itself is extremely welcoming and has all your essential needs to make your stay relaxing. The location was conveniently located next to several bus stops making it convenient to get around. Make sure to get an orca card or exact change for your bus rides. I would definitely book this Airbnb for my next visit to Seattle.
3946160,52466505,2015-10-29,36048635,Petra,"Ken was a great host, making it very easy to access to apartment without us even needing to meet! We made this reservation the morning of our first day staying there, so being able to instant book this spot was a great advantage. Definitely a very clean place, and the beverages were a nice touch. Kitchen provides enough appliances (microwave, fridge) to be able to make some snacks but with no stove top you can't really make full meals. The place is not as close to downtown as I imagined, but still a manageable walk (30 mins) or a quick Uber ride away. "
3946160,53144573,2015-11-05,19650963,Johnny,Ken's place is exactly what we had wanted and expected. It's just like in the pictures. Nice clean spot that is not too far away from downtown.

Perfect stay for 2, good location, will come back again :)"
3946160,53797524,2015-11-12,21450984,Nicole,"Great place, very small but super clean and had everything we needed. Easily able to get a later checkout time which was nice. Definitely recommend this place. "
3946160,54014238,2015-11-15,47516459,Steven,"Although we never met up, Ken was a great host! He responded to messages quickly, had access to the room when we needed it, and checked it to make sure everything was ok.

The room was located with a set of apartments, next to a garage and labelled Suite G. The room was easy to access once Ken sent me the code and we didn't even need keys. The room was hotel room quality and cozy. There was a bedroom, bathroom and small kitchen. 

The wifi was good and there were enough outlets for devices for two people. I also liked the bluetooth speaker. There was an air ionizer and also temperature control in the bedroom and kitchen area.

The bed was ok, there were extra pillows in the closet and it was decently comfortable. Nearby was a nightstand with seattle magazines, and a closet with a few hangers.

The bathroom was good: heat lamp, handsoap, hand, face, and body towels as well as shampoo, conditioner, and body wash (labelled as lotion) in the shower.

The kitchen had a keurig, small fridge stocked with water and two beers and soda, and cups and plates.

This place was good for our two night stay since it was minimalistic but had all the essentials. There were a few parking spots around the hill too since a friend drove us around. All in all, a solid place to stay in Seattle."
3946160,54299558,2015-11-17,48815920,Jesse,"Ken is a great host. His hospitality went above and beyond and made our stay so much easier. His food recommendations were great. And the house location is perfect. Just about everything in the city is, at most, a 15 minute drive away. "
3946160,54878554,2015-11-25,27195219,Ranny,This is my first Airbnb.  The room is clean and warm. It's convenient to everywhere. The bus station is close to house. And Ken is so nice. 
3946160,54957372,2015-11-25,3717885,Diana,"Ken's place was quiet, clean and comfortable, perfect overnight stop for an early morning flight out of Seatac. Although I never met him, he was a gracious host, available promptly via email."
3946160,55727675,2015-12-05,33267014,Tyson,"Ken's place was great! Exactly as it looked in the photos, very clean and in a great location that was less than a $10 uber to get to downtown. Would definitely stay again. Thanks Ken!"
3946160,55976795,2015-12-07,40656551,Edwin,Great experience staying here. Very clean and well kept just like new. Easy check in procedure and Ken was able to check me in earlier on request. Highly recommended and I will stay here again. Thanks!
3946160,56744407,2015-12-17,24151820,Laura,"Like a hotel! The place was perfect for a few short nights in Seattle, especially for a young couple. The location was accessible enough with public transportation, and Lyft/Uber made things way easier come the late hours. When we arrived, we simply punched in a door code which made everything so simple. Also, the fridge came stocked with two beers, some sodas, and waters, not to mention a Keurig which was free for us to use. Ken was extremely accommodating via text, and made sure to provide recommendations if we needed them. "

158345,406722,2011-07-30,140245,Jessica,Marcia was awesome!  Very gracious host. She went out of her way to make us feel at home. We cooked a big dinner in her big kitchen and she had everything we needed to do it. This was my first Airbnb experience and I will never forget it. I will definitely stay there again. Thanks :)
158345,415949,2011-08-02,858472,Clark,Marcia was incredibly helpful and gracious!  The bedroom and bathroom are very neat and clean.  Marcia took the time to help me get acquainted with the neighborhood and public transportation.  A great place to stay!
158345,421758,2011-08-05,832019,Fred And Bessann,"Marcia welcomed us to her charming Ballard home and had everything ready for us, even a walking map of the community. We had evening plans and did not get much of a chance to visit with her, but would like to. The room was comfortable and quiet and we enjoyed breakfast out on her patio and a stroll through the pleasant neighborhood, which is close to the Chittenden Locks, an interesting sight if you are in Seattle."
158345,429163,2011-08-08,856211,Dennis,"Marcia Cote was a tremendous host.  When I mislaid my mobile phone, she assisted me with contacting the parties needed to replace it.  She also did my laundry along with hers and gave me suggestions about what to see in Seattle.  When I come back to Seattle, I will stay at 1914 Craftsman in Sunset Hills. "
158345,437772,2011-08-11,918530,Emily,"I felt very welcomed by Marcia, her home, and the neighborhood (set back from busier Ballard a little bit, and near the beautiful Golden Gardens beach). Marcia was very kind and communicative (even considering our busy schedules during my visit!). I would suggest it as a great stay for anyone visiting the Seattle area!"
158345,442375,2011-08-13,924658,Gabrielle,"The room and bed were comfy, the neighborhood is very quiet.  Marcia was helpful - printed out maps so we could walk to local restaurants.  The 17 bus takes you to Ballard's main drag and to Westlake in downtown Seattle.  I found a great bike rental, Dutch Bikes on Ballard Avenue, so I could have more mobility.  Marcia will let you cook in her kitchen , but don't.  There are terrific restaurants around Market and Ballard, and just north of Marcia's house is an awesome bakery for breakfast that also does lunch and dinner in their cafe next to the bakery.  I think I gained 5 lbs in Seattle. 

From Dutch Bikes you can follow the river trails around or go into the city.  We went to the arboretum and all around it.  

That 17 bus also takes you to Lake Union if you want to kayak around and see the seaplanes come and go and look at the famous houseboats."
158345,450169,2011-08-16,815443,Carene,"The location is fantastic, if you enjoy walking.  Great Italian restaurant a few blocks away.  Easy access to downtown Ballard.  Quiet neighborhood which makes sleeping in the front, upstairs bedroom quite wonderful.  The bedroom is large, clean and guest friendly.  Marcia had cookies and chocolates, along with Ballard maps in the room.  The bathroom is sparkling clean. The host is friendly, accommodating and welcoming.  I highly recommend this host/room to anyone visiting the Ballard area. "
158345,454545,2011-08-17,563637,Nova,"Marcia was our first hostess on Airbnb.  She was a very gracious & accommodating to our needs  Marcia truly made our first experience worthwhile.  We were only there for one night but she opened up her home to us as if we were family.  Her home is very clean and cozy and full of character.  She had maps of the area and the neighborhood is fantastic!

We will stay again.


"
158345,472419,2011-08-24,921121,Dana,Marcia was a great host! She went out of her way to make me feel at home and even baked cookies and made breakfast for me while I was there! The bed and room was very comfortable. I would definitely recommend anyone to stay there. It was like having a mom away from home. Very clean home in a nice quite neighborhood.
158345,478843,2011-08-27,837448,Lynne,"Marcia was a wonderful host!  My daughter and I enjoyed staying in her charming home while visiting UW.  Although Marcia was unable to be at the home the day we arrived she checked on us, and made sure we had everything we needed.  When we did meet, she felt like a friend after a short time.  Home, room, and bathroom all very clean.  Comfortable bed. Nice, quiet, safe-feeling neighborhood, yet close to downtown Ballard, the university, and the city.  Several little ""gifts"" were a bonus, such as cookies and tea one afternoon and breakfast (made to order) another morning.  I wholeheartedly recommend staying with Marcia; she was a delight!!"
158345,507548,2011-09-06,973597,Kowsy,It is a privilege to stay at Marcia's.  Genuine care. Went out of the way help us.  Felt very welcome and at home.  Loved the turn of last century house.  Great communication and well organized.   Highly recommended.

She recommended us some great restaurants which are within walking from her place. Her place was well located for us so getting around was no problem. Enjoyed her company immensely and wished we had more time with her. Definitely recommend.
158345,602488,2011-10-05,1002360,Roland,"Marcia is a super host! The accomodations were clean, airy, and spacious. The charm of the 1914 Craftsman and incredible hospitality made us feel like we stayed with a favorite family member!"
158345,612239,2011-10-09,1159485,Karen,"Marcia was a wonderful host! We loved staying in her charming, eclectic home and would do it all over again! She went out of her way to make she we had everything we needed and more.The house and neighborhood were both lovely, as were the fresh baked scones!"
158345,615150,2011-10-10,1173910,Dee,Marcia went out her way in helping me with the logistics of my short stay and I am very appreciative of her help. She is also a great host-she really tries to make guests feel at home. The bedroom I stayed in was extremely quiet  and comfortable..Her house is easily accessed by public transportation.
158345,648155,2011-10-20,1245234,Patricia & Alain,"Marcia was a great host.  She greated us with a warm smile and made us feel  at home upon arrival.  The front room where we stayed was clean and very comfortable.  Although it was in the front of the house it was very very quiet.  Ballard is a beautiful community and  close to centertown Seattle. 

She recommend beautiful restaurants, also had coupons for us to use.  She also had maps and different visitor's information that was very useful.

I highly recommend Marcia and we had a wonderful stay.

Patricia & Alain  "
158345,664058,2011-10-25,874073,Lindsay,"Everything was fresh and clean.  I didn't see Marcia all that much, but when I did she was very nice and helpful.  There are many personal touches to this place.  It's a great home base if you are visiting Seattle."
158345,722618,2011-11-15,1367719,William,"Marcia could have been more accommodating and helpful. As someone who does not travel well (I am a stress case) it was very comforting to not only stay in an area like Ballard, which had everything I wanted within walking distance, but also to have a host who knew the area so well and made us feel totally at ease. "
158345,850939,2012-01-08,1568953,Brighton,"Marcia was a kind and gracious host. Her organization and ability to predict our needs such as making available  maps of Seattle helped us to make the most of our time in Seattle. The room was was very clean, well designed, comfortable and warm during our winter stay. On another note, Marcia happens to live in a great find of a district called the Ballard, there is a wonderful restaurant and bar scene just a 5 minute drive from Marcia's house. Blake and I would definitely urge you to stay with Marcia if you are lucky to visit Seattle!"
158345,892238,2012-01-30,1639102,Elaine,Marcia was a great host.  She was thoughtful and very helpful.  The bus line was easy to get to downtown.  The home is very comfortable and we enjoyed our stay with her.
158345,914546,2012-02-11,1254574,Ingmar,"Unfortunately, I didn't meet Marcia in person as I got ""home"" too late but my girl-friend met her and said that she was super nice. Also, she clearly puts a lot of attention to details and everything was very well prepared with cute welcome notes and everything. To be recommended!"
158345,1014521,2012-03-18,1858253,Janet,Marcia is an amazing airbnb hostess!  Her instructions were easily followed and her home was tidy and absolutely lovely.  The bedroom I enjoyed for the night was quiet and the bed was fabulously comfy!  Thank you Marcia!
158345,1046153,2012-03-26,486277,Susan,"Very comfy bed and well equipped accommodation
The neighborhood was as quiet as a prairie grassland campsite,,
Friendly welcoming host. 
I would definitely book again next time I am in Seattle

"
158345,1087566,2012-04-05,1107424,Pamela,"This place was perfect for us. Marcia is an amazing host, so sweet and considerate and really went out of her way to make our experience great. We have a little 1 year old and so she pulled out old toys and books and was extremely accommodating. We love to cook and so the big kitchen was an awesome bonus! The place is beautifully located - quiet and peaceful, but seconds away from a bus that goes all the way to town and just 8 blocks from a 24 hour supermarket. Marcia's roommate is awesome too - she entertained our little one and helped us out a few times when we needed it! We'd definitely stay here again."
158345,1119889,2012-04-12,2015194,Laura,"Marcia's warmth floods her house, it really is a home away from home.  Marcia really went out of her way to make me feel welcome & comfortable.  The area is very pretty, it would suit anyone who wants somewhere quiet to stay, and is just 20mins walk from the thriving bars and restaurants of Ballard.  The bus to downtown stops right at the end of the street, but note that buses run infrequently at night.  For those who want to cook, Marcia's kitchen has any kitchen appliance you might need."
158345,1144915,2012-04-17,100754,Teresa,"Marcia was a GREAT hostess from start to finish. She made me feel welcome long before I got to her home. Her house is really nice, and clean. Marcia works a lot so I did not see her much or her roommate, I felt like I had the place to myself. There is a nice porch out back with a place to sit for coffee in the A.M. My bed was SO comfortable, the room bright and airy. The location is great as well, I had a car and recommend one but public transit it pretty good on Seattle. She took me to a nice breakfast at a local eatery, Patty's Eggnest, a real treat. Marcia had many little ""things"" around the house to make an Airbnb'er feel welcome & at home. I am a host myself and I will be ""borrowing"" some of her ideas to add to Jane's Place in Montana. Thanks for a wonderful stay!!"
158345,1189582,2012-04-27,2148552,Todd,"My visit  was perfect for what I needed right now in my life. Marcia was a great host, she was very calm, respectful and curtious. She opened her home to a complete stranger. I felt safe and comfortable. We had open and wonderful conversations. Marcia is a real Gem and a really cool person. I would easily stay again at her home and great location the next time I visit Seattle. So Thank You Marcia "
158345,1240904,2012-05-07,10913,Cory + Shelby,"Our stay with Marcia was perfect. She's a very kind and thoughtful host. Her place is really welcoming in a lovely neighborhood in Ballard, our room was quiet and clean and we could easily come and go. We brought our bikes and she let us keep them on the enclosed porch for safety. Parking on the street was not an issue. It's a great location for exploring Ballard and Fremont, but a bit further from downtown than we anticipated. A great couple days!"

The second floor room had a beautiful territorial view and an amazingly comfortable bed.  Marcia made us feel instantly welcome, and we cannot recommend staying with her highly enough!  "
158345,1382353,2012-05-30,2090584,Paul,Wouldn't hesitate to stay again or fully recommend to others.  Marcia was happy to chat if we wanted to but was unintrusive otherwise.  Wonderful balance that not all hosts would naturally have.
158345,1407628,2012-06-03,2457354,Jude,"Marcia's hospitality was superb, making us feel at home, as if with new housemates...a home away from home I hope to visit again. She sets a high bar for bnb's."
158345,1416244,2012-06-04,2479388,Jeff,Marcia was flexible with us when our plans changed & we were running late.  She went out of way to accomodate us and get the keys to us since we would be coming back to the house late.  She had everything set up for us and made our stay comfortable.  We would highly recommend her.  
158345,1422045,2012-06-05,2414588,Jerry,Very friendly ! We would recommend Marcia anytime !

158345,1517170,2012-06-19,544617,Chris,"Marcia made it possible for my friend and I to easily locate her house and traverse the surrounding area with ease. Her home is in a great location about 30 min bus ride from downtown, and a few minutes walk from a cool little each hangout. I will be looking forward to stay with Marcia again :)"
158345,1593021,2012-06-30,2225760,Danielle,"We had such a wonderful time staying at Marcia's home. She was completely welcoming and made us feel comfortable. We loved being so close to everything in Ballard and spent a lot of time there. 
She was very thoughtful and had a shelf in the kitchen and space in the fridge for us to store food if we needed to. 
I completely recommend her and would definitely stay with Marcia again if we are in the area. "
158345,1618124,2012-07-02,1254231,Millicent,"Although our encounter with Marcia was brief, she was a very kind and thoughtful host.  Her home and the surrounding area are gorgeous and relaxing.  I highly recommend spending time here if you're in the Seattle area.  "

158345,1679178,2012-07-10,2765425,Rachel,"My husband and I enjoyed our brief stay at Marcia's charming home. We did rent a car and the house was easy to locate. For walkers the house is  about a 15 minute walk east to a street bustling with restaurants and shops. We walked eight minutes west to have a traditional seafood style dinner on the water! As for the house we felt that the value was great. Large windows poured in natural light and detailed instructions left us feeling confidant about important things like bathrooms and coffee. We spoke with Marcia briefly but our time was pleasantly private. There is one full bath located upstairs where the airbnb room, Marcia's room, and Marcia's roomate's room are all located, and a half bath on the main level. We recommend Marcia's home! Also the bed provided a GREAT night's sleep after a long day of travel."
158345,1834690,2012-07-30,1993701,Priscilla,"All I can say is ""WOW!"" I was in Seattle for 3 weeks and Marcia opened her home to me completely! It was wonderful to experience Seattle from a resident's perspective. Marcia ensured I had everything I needed and added some special welcoming touches as well. I would highly recommend Marcia's for anyone looking for a place to stay for a night, a week, or longer. The bed was great, the room was great, and the hostess is one of those special people with a big heart. A pure pleasure staying here!"
158345,1915575,2012-08-07,2872756,Alessandra,"My boyfriend and I spent 5 fabulous nights at Marcia's beautiful craftsman home. She was a wonderful host.

The location was perfect! Only a 5-10 minute drive to the heart of Seattle."
158345,1924132,2012-08-08,1149652,Nikkia,"Marcia was a wonderful host, eager to give recommendations of her favorite coffee spots in the area.

158345,2121053,2012-08-28,1792082,Barbara,"Marcia is an incredibly warm and helpful host. In her beautiful house I felt immediately at home.

158345,2138715,2012-08-29,1938655,Britta,"Marcia was a wonderful host! She was warm and friendly and very helpful, made us feel right at home. The house is beautiful and clean and cozy, we wished we were staying longer and would certainly come back! "
158345,2174001,2012-09-02,93793,Ellen,"Marcia and I never met, but I saw another renter at the house. The bed was very comfortable and the house is very close to the Ballard Locks where the salmon run museum is. The rent is very reasonable. I would come again and recommend it to others."
158345,2179251,2012-09-03,3021897,Jackie,"My boyfriend and I came up to Seattle for a night, and stayed with Marcia. Her home is lovely, and she was so helpful and kind. Ballard was a great neighborhood to walk around, and Marcia made it easy for us to come and go throughout the day. Would definitely recommend to others and would definitely come back to stay next time we're in Seattle! "
158345,2217072,2012-09-06,3034720,Jamillah,"Marcia was an awesome host and her home is beautiful. Though we didn't get to spend much time with her, she was so gracious and thoughtful. I wish we were able to take advantage of the kitchen and garden a bit more but we weren't there enough. I highly recommend staying with marcia and I would personally come back over and over when I am in the area. "
158345,2407655,2012-09-25,3149901,Karen,"Meeting Marcia in person was like visiting an old and dear friend. I arrived at night, having never been in Seattle and traveling alone I felt very comfortable staying at Marcia's.  I love older homes and Marcia has done an amazing job preserving the character of her home.  The new rain gardens are beautiful and during the day looking out the big windows from the room with the gardens below is so charming. Great meals and great conversations. Highly recommend. "
158345,2425078,2012-09-26,2047447,Katja,"Thank you Marcia!
I arrived after Marcia left for work and met Mirna and had a little chat with her. As I was so tired after my flight from Europe I just took a shower and went to bed - very cosy and comfortable room. The next morning I drove to Golden Garden and had a long morning walk! Perfect for my first day in the Seattle area - after buying fresh salmon at Pike Place at 8.30am I continued my journey to Idaho.
Marcias place was fantastic for all my needs. I recommend staying in Ballard!g"
158345,2494093,2012-10-03,1810376,Jimbo,"What a great stay we had at this charming home by the sound.  Everything is walking distance.  Best of all is the sweet hostess Marcia. She is a wonderful gracious host.  Her home is inviting and warm.  We came as strangers and left as friends.  We were able to get around town easily and traveled into Seattle to see all the tourist stuff but found ourselfs drawn back to the wonderful area of Ballard.  It's a can't miss spot with tons to do.  We walked to dinner, saw a great show at the Sunset Tavern and during the day explored the Locks and Botanical Gardens.Ray's Cafe was a great meal and perfect spot to give you the feel of a true meal by the sea.  All good here and recommend this to anyone."

Has a great home in the highly desirable Ballard neighborhood of Seattle, within walking distance of fantastic restaurants, and beautiful views of the Puget Sound.

158345,2711000,2012-10-24,3906872,Rebecca,Marcia was an amazing hostess. She welcomed us into her house and make us feel right at home. My daughter and I spent two nights in her home and loved it. Her home is in a great location to walk downtown and to get around to all of the sights that we wanted to see on our visit. Marcia was very friendly and helpful and being able to use the kitchen was a bonus!
158345,2758627,2012-10-30,3149901,Karen,"Second time here and that says it all for me!  I knew the lay of the land and it was like going home, my second home.  Marcia had time to help me get to Trader Joe's for food.  We were able to share a great morning walk that included the most important stops; coffee, scones, yarn, picking up friends.  My short walk to the Ballard Senior Center where the Ling Gui Qi Gong seminar is held is so close.  Again, comfortable bed, warm shower, very welcoming host, why stay any where else.  Thanks again Marcia, until next. "

158345,2994881,2012-11-30,3644160,Kyle,"Our stay at Marcia's house was nothing less than amazing. My friend and I stayed with Marcia for over 25 days and every single one was better than the last. She didn't treat us like guests... she treated us like members of the family. We were even given the opportunity to have Thanksgiving with her which was a blast! 

The entire time Marcia went out of her way to help us with anything we needed from time to time. During this time she was always super friendly and willing to do anything in her power to make us feel more comfortable. On some days where it seemed the rain would never subside (I know right Seattle!) she even gave us a ride if she wasn't busy! 

Her house was always super clean and extremely well kept. My friend is very OCD and even he thought Marcia did a fantastic job of keeping everything up to an extremely high level of quality. We honestly couldn't have choosen a better place to stay for our 25 days... not including the fact it was extremely easy to get to downtown Seattle from her house. A quick 5 minute walk and you would have access to the 40 which brings you right into the heart of Seattle or really anywhere else you would want to go!

My friend and I were originally from Ohio and we moved to Seattle to ""set up shop"" and begin a new and far more exciting life. It wasn't easy moving 2,500 miles away from our parents but Marcia made the feeling of being ""homesick"" irrelevant. Not only did we meet a wonderful and caring woman we made a great new friend during our time with Marcia. I would HIGHLY recommend anyone who wants to travel to Seattle or at least get to learn about Ballard (which is amazing) should stay with Marcia. I can guarantee you will not be disappointed with your decision!"
158345,3085484,2012-12-14,1708656,Kasie,"Our stay with Marcia was wonderful. We needed a place to stay after my husband's surgery and wanted to be in Ballard (we used to live in the area). Marcia's house worked out great. We had everything we needed to live (not vacation) for our 2 weeks and it was very comfortable for my husband to recoup. We were able to cook most of our meals since Marcia has a nice, large kitchen and lent us any tool we needed including a cart to roll groceries to the house from the store just a few blocks away.

We also had plenty of privacy since Marcia has such a busy lifestyle and was rarely home. It was like having the large house to ourselves. Friends and family were able to visit us without any problems.

We love the Ballard area and needed to get my husband walking to help in his recovery. The location was great to be able to walk to the locks, grocer, bank, movie theatre, coffee shops and historic Ballard. We even did the second Saturday Art Walk.

Marcia was very accommodating and helpful. It also helped that she is a nurse and offered to assist if we needed help with changing dressings or administering shots.

We would definitely stay again. Thanks Marcia!!"
158345,3146136,2012-12-24,2438160,Matthew & Martha,"Marcia appoints the room and her kitchen with tremendous care and forethought.  She was very helpful and willing to chat, a very warm and welcoming host.  The room is very warm, comfortable, spacious.  I would definitely book with her again.  She will be top of list of return trips to Seattle.  

All plumbing, windows, heaters, locks functioned well.  Really no complaints.  The neighborhood is beautiful.  Near the locks so great in Summer.  A bus stop is literally around the corner, but I opt for catching the #40 to downtown off of 24th since it gets me a nice brusk 5 block walk and some local coffee shops to walk by.  A seamless experience. "
158345,3176642,2012-12-29,965510,Rodica,"Marcia was very graceful and accommodating during my mom's stay at her place. The room was clean, quiet and warm - and Marcia was an amazing host, opening her beautiful home to my mom over the holidays. Marcia was also incredibly flexible and understanding about our checking in and checking out times. Looking forward to staying with her again!  "
158345,3245192,2013-01-03,4168225,Douglas,"We truly enjoyed staying at Marcia's.  We had a great room with a view of Mt. Rainier (when it wasn't cloudy), the house was very nice and comfortable, and we really appreciated the kitchen privileges. We also enjoyed getting to know Marcia. We highly recommend a Ballard location for getting to know Seattle. Our special treat was a snowy owl roosting several blocks north of Marcia's. "
158345,3372654,2013-01-19,4575583,Brian,"We absolutely loved our stay with Marcia. We were relocating out to Seattle from the east coast and we stayed with Marcia during our first week and a half in Seattle as we looked for an apartment. Her house is in a beautiful location, a short drive to anything you could want in Ballard, which offers lots of great shops and amazing restaurants. Her house itself is a beautifully maintained, decorated, and super clean craftsman with so much character. Marcia let us use her kitchen as much as we wanted and was really flexible when we needed to stay a few extra days. One awesome unexpected perk was the beautiful view of Mount Rainier from the cozy bedroom window on a clear day.  Marcia was such a sweet hostess and we couldn't have asked for a better introduction to our new life in Seattle."
158345,3423999,2013-01-27,1131896,Elizabeth,"Great place to stay in Ballard in a nice craftsman house, nice neighborhood, with a comfy bed, great hospitality and a warm welcome! "
158345,3475797,2013-02-04,4649125,Evi,"Marcia provided an incredibly warm, welcoming stay in her cozy home in Ballard. My partner and I really appreciated little touches such as notes welcoming us, her flexibility, reliability, coffee, cinnamon buns, and genuine friendliness. It was truly a pleasure staying with her; it felt like staying with family. When she asked us if there was anything else we needed, I couldn't think of anything she hadn't already provided. Thank you Marcia!"
158345,3504965,2013-02-09,1299280,Eva,"I love this place.  Marcia was a great Host and the space was
uber convenient places of interest in Ballard.
Thanks Marcia .   Sincerely Eva"
158345,3528064,2013-02-12,678520,Akiyo,"My boyfriend and I really enjoyed staying with Marcia in her beautiful home in a wonderful neighborhood. Her house was warm and full of light, and our room was so comfortable; we felt very much at home. Marcia was such a thoughtful and helpful host and she really makes sure that you have all that you need. We really appreciated all of her helpful notes around the house, and the many city brochures she kept in our room. Marcia is such a warm person and was a delight to talk to; we wish we could have stayed longer and spoken more! We would definitely love to stay with her again when we are back in Seattle."
158345,3585370,2013-02-19,837448,Lynne,"Thoroughly lovely long weekend w/my girls at Marcia's.  We all enjoyed, again, Marcia's lovely home in this Ballard neighborhood.  It was very relaxing, cozy, homey.  We enjoyed visiting the Ballard farmer's market, nearby Greenlake, and even south Whidbey Island.  Marcia's place has become a great ""2nd home"" for us when visiting our daughter at UW.  Marcia is a considerate and thoughtful host and I look forward to our next stay.  Highly recommend!!"
158345,3701028,2013-03-05,4932704,Marta,"Lovely home and hostess.  Very convenient loacation.  Will return, happily."
158345,3734256,2013-03-09,4239309,Willem,"Close to the salty water in a upscale neighbourhood a comfortable room with a view.
Marcia is a very welcoming host, easygoing, social with a super interesting job in the icu.
Thanks Marcia!"
158345,3759591,2013-03-11,5383067,Eric,"I don't believe we could have had a better host than Marcia. A beer waiting for us upon arrival, not to mention a last minute stay that she bent over backwards to accommodate!

Extremely clean home, terrific location in Ballard near buses/beach/parks, enormous amount of information available for the tourist type. I was only there for a quick business trip, but if you had more time Marcia seems to be a wealth of information.

Marcia also was a great host in that she saw my brother and I were both exhausted from the day and allowed us our privacy and an early bed time. 

Couldn't be happier, STRONGLY RECOMMEND!!!"
158345,3884422,2013-03-24,1576155,Robert & Korrina,"My girlfriend and I only stayed at Marcia's for one night, but we had an awesome time there. Marcia was a very attentive and kind host and her house is a gem.  The bed is very comfortable and the no-tech, oldie-worldyness of her home makes for a very pleasant retreat - even for one night. it's so much nicer to wake up in the residential streets of Ballard than a I-5 Motel 6 or a crummy downtown hotel. I would definitely come back here! Thanks so much Marcia!  "
158345,3921908,2013-03-27,1679229,Mari,"Marcia was a wonderful host and her house was lovely! We would definitely stay with her again if we come back to Seattle. She was knowledgable, friendly, and flexible regarding check-in. 

Thanks a ton for hosting us,  

-Mari & Stephen"
158345,4005454,2013-04-02,1548681,Brendan,"Marcia is a very out-going, friendly and helpful. Her room was tidy and cozy and the house was in a great area. Ballard is a little jewel of a neighborhood North of Seattle, just 20 minutes from downtown. The neighborhood has so much to offer as far as hip nightspots and great eats that we only ended up going to Seattle once during the 4 day stay.

We highly recommend staying with Marcia in this great area."
158345,4067973,2013-04-07,5591022,Mariah,"Marcia is the best host you could possibly ask for! She is one of the sweetest people you'll ever meet and she definitely knows how to make you feel at home. She was unavailable during our check-in time, so she left detailed notes for us when we got there so there was no confusion. Her home is beautiful and the bedroom was very cute and clean. The bed is also very comfortable! She provides clean towels, toiletries, extra blankets, and just about anything else you might need. She also put a label maker to great use to clarify any confusion with switches, door knobs, or faucets. She encourages guests to take advantage of whatever they may need, including the kitchen and living room. She also helped us with directions around the city and told us we could call and ask for help at any time. I can't imagine that you could find any host more accommodating than Marcia. Overall, our experience was fantastic and I would love to go back to Seattle just to stay here!"
158345,4182533,2013-04-16,3149901,Karen,"Once again, a fantastic home to relax in.  Marcia is an amazing woman who welcomed myself and my husband Leo.  I believe this is my third or fourth stay with Marcia and really is like going home.  For what ever reason I need to be in Seattle staying with Marcia is the icing on the cake.  Highly recommend. "
158345,4536894,2013-05-11,2837264,Sandrine,"We only spent one night at Marcia's place but it was an overall good experience.Even if Marcia wasn't able to welcome us,she had left us the keys and all the instructions to feel comfortable in her (website hidden) feels like a BnB with a lot of things labeled, a cupboard and shelves in the fridge dedicated to guests and a closet full of brochures and maps to get around (email hidden)e house is quite old and I've been sometimes bothered,being allergic to dust.The house is in a really nice and residential neighborhood,a 10 to 20-minute walk from Market St and Ballard Avenue where you can find a lot of trendy shops and restaurants.Going downtown via public transportation is a little bit trickier and often requires transfer (it can easily take 45 minutes,if not an hour).We only met Marcia for a quick chat and she seemed like a very sweet and open-minded person."
158345,4599900,2013-05-14,1722722,Shira,"I never got to meet Marcia, but she leaves her guests such wonderful and clear instructions that I didn't feel I was getting the short end of the stick. Everything is labeled and explained thoroughly and she makes herself very accessible to reach out to, which was definitely appreciated! Her home is quaint and charming, and Ballard is a wonderful neighborhood to live in, if only even for a few days' vacation."
158345,4626127,2013-05-16,2208634,Amy,I loved Marcia's space and wished I could have stayed longer. Great neighborhood. Marcia was very flexible.
158345,4712804,2013-05-21,21857,Donna,"I had a lovely stay in Seattle at Marcia's home in Sunset Hill, Seattle. Everything was comfortable and clean.  Marcia is gracious and helpful.  The neighborhood is great, and it is easy to get there on public transportation from the airport.  I would definitely stay there again."
158345,4786680,2013-05-26,985447,Jennyanna,"Being with Marcia felt like coming home. She exudes warmth and kindness and what a better place the world would be with more people like Marcia in it. Just thinking about her puts a smile on our faces. Her house and garden reflect the person she is: creative, comforting, welcoming. We had a great time sharing stories and laughter. Her house is in a quiet residential area with great walking opportunities. She was extremely helpful explaining the bus system and suggesting funky places to visit. We hope somehow, somewhere we'll see Marcia again. Truly a very special person with a heart that will always have room for yet another human being. Thank you Marcia for being you."
158345,4877741,2013-05-30,4683922,Laura,"My stay in Ballard was really special due to my circumstances. And I have to also say that choosing to stay at Marcia's house was truly a great decision. She really goes above and beyond to make sure you have what you need to enjoy your stay at her home while visiting Seattle. Her home is so centrally located to restaurants, shops, the ocean. It's lovely and walking around the neighborhood is truly lovely. Coming from Texas I was in amazement how Seattle has its own arboretum. LOVELY and Marcia is so sweet. We really enjoyed the time we spent with her. "
158345,5113428,2013-06-13,5872236,Patricia,Had a fabulous stay with Marcia! I am moving back to Seattle this summer and her home and her great company are perfect for me while I get through this transition. I have already booked my return visit while I wait for my Van Lines truck to arrive at my new place. 
158345,5176067,2013-06-17,5499098,Jessica,"Beautiful home, easy-going host. We came to Seattle for a friend's wedding, and Marcia was helpful and welcoming even as we were in and out at all hours. A+"
158345,5262789,2013-06-21,1368039,Marsha,"My stay with Marcia was wonderful.  She made me feel right at home, the room/house is comfortable and clean, and the neighborhood is fun for walking, with nearby views and great food.
Marcia has lots of information available about the neighborhood and Seattle in general available in pamphlets, a nice touch. I hope to get back when next I am in Seattle!
"
158345,5284143,2013-06-22,6887673,Vivian,"Marcia was wonderful!  Our bedroom was very clean and the tourist info pamphlets she had prepared were extremely helpful.  Thanks Marcia, will definitely come back again."
158345,5377863,2013-06-27,5462960,Alan,"My wife and I were very happy to stay at Marcia's large house in a quiet and charming section of Ballard overlooking the Sound. Marcia is completely organized for AirBnB customers with small notices posted in the large kitchen indicating storage areas, etc for us. We had an upstairs bedroom with large walk-in closet and comfortable bed, plus excellent and clean bathroom to ourselves.  And did I mention the house was large!  While we were staying in her house Marcia was on night shift so for much of our stay we actually had the house to ourselves, although we did manage to have some short conversations with our host who is very friendly and accommodating.  

For people who are concerned, there is ample street parking in the neighborhood, and the house is within walking distance of public transport and a little bit more of a walk from a number of restaurants. 

In short we had an extremely pleasant and relaxing stay at this AirBnB. Highly recommended."
158345,5399603,2013-06-28,2494549,Judy,"Marcia is a delightful, thoughtful host. She stayed in touch with us and made sure we had easy access to her home when we arrived at an unspecified hour in the late afternoon. Marcia was out visiting her family in Ballard when we arrived but we had clear instructions that enabled us to find our comfortable bedroom and get refreshing showers. We departed again before Marcia returned so we met her for the first time when we got back around 10 pm.

Marcia's charming older home is located at the top of Sunset Hill with a rain-friendly flower garden graced with garden art and a views of the bay. We had a comfortable bed and restful night in a quiet setting. We had instructions and everything we needed to make our own coffee and tea in the morning in a well appointed kitchen. 

We definitely hope to return to Marcia's AirBnB when we again visit Ballard to see our daughter. We enjoyed chatting with Marcia and shared our common garden interests and ideas for good food sources in the Seattle area.

Judy Davis and Jack Kysar"
158345,5522925,2013-07-04,5756938,Grace,"Marcia is a gem. This was our first Airbnb stay, and we LOVED it, mostly thanks to Marcia. She's unflaggingly friendly and hospitable -- I felt as though I'd known her for years! She's generous in a way that many people aren't, inviting us to pick her raspberries, making us sun tea, driving us to the bus station when we missed the bus. I'm sending everyone I know to Ballard to stay with her. Her home is gorgeous and the bedroom comfortable. Plus, the area is charming, good public transportation makes getting around a breeze, and the restaurants in downtown Ballard are to die for. Bottom line: we love Marcia! Stay with her!"
158345,5674319,2013-07-11,678520,Akiyo,"This was my second time staying with Marcia, this time for a week, and once again she was a wonderful host, and her house was the perfect place to stay and rest after many long, busy days out. Marcia is the most kind, accommodating host you could ever have, and will make sure you have everything you need and has lots of helpful advice about Seattle. This time I had a chance to relax in her rocking bench in her beautiful and peaceful garden, and it was the best way to unwind after getting back home."
158345,5705706,2013-07-12,7389974,Harry And Trish,"Marcia is great. We had a friendly visit in the morning. The bed was very comfortable. Classic craftsman house. Clean, well kept, a blend of history, art pieces and at least one sewing machine. Quiet neighborhood close to Shilshole Marina, the  Ballard Locks and Rays Boathouse where there's a dynamite happy hour."
158345,5785591,2013-07-16,4706613,Shoshona,Marcia is warm and engaging. She was helpful and flexible. The house is in a wonderfully quiet neighborhood with views of the water. A great place to stay. I would definitely return!
158345,5940299,2013-07-23,6195254,Rosamma,"Had a very comfortable week in Marcia's home. She was very attentive, warm and friendly and most of the time we had the entire house to ourselves. The location was perfect for us and i was able to meet up with my daughter, a friend, and later that week my husband and son joined me. It was a quiet neighborhood and i really enjoyed the mile walk down to Golden gardens. The use of the kitchen allowed us to eat breakfast in. We will be staying here again i hope when we are in Seattle again.  "
158345,6006678,2013-07-26,7042373,Brenna,"Marcia was an AMAZING host. Her house is absolutely beautiful, clean, and close to all the fun places to go in Seattle. My husband and I felt very comfortable, and Marcia gave us our space but was always available if we needed something. My only regret was not being able to stay longer than 2 days and get to know her better!"
158345,6072138,2013-07-29,5326960,Michelle,"Although I never got to meet Marcia, I would say she is an amazing host! Her warmth and hospitality is evident throughout her warm and welcoming home. "

Marcia is very flexible, and accommodates whatever you need to do, from leaving you alone to do your thing, to helping in any way with whatever problems you have. I highly recommend her and her house."
158345,6396273,2013-08-11,2944088,Amy,"Marcia's home was lovely and inviting, and my sister and I enjoyed our stay! Even though we unfortunately barely saw Marcia, her warm presence was felt through little personalized touches that made us feel welcome. The neighborhood was beautiful, and getting to downtown Seattle was easy both by car and bus (we did both). Also, there is a very organized and thorough display of brochures including transit schedules. I highly recommend staying at Marcia's-- I would again!"
158345,6446653,2013-08-12,7970488,Eunji,"Unfortunately, I couldn't meet Marcia because of my schedule, but I can say surely she is an awesome host! The room was so clean and nice, and I could see that she took great care of the room for people who stay there. She was very nice and kind giving me information which I needed, and she cared about not only the room but also my time and experience during my stay there. I strongly recommend this wonderful room and host. "
158345,6501166,2013-08-14,7858340,Mooky,"This place is a wonderful!!  The host is warm and kind and helped whenever she could. Her home is a beautiful Victorian house and our room was perfect.

She has been most welcoming and her quaint home in quiet and lovely Ballard  is a wonderful starting point for visiting Seattle. She has provided us with loads of information about this place and has been very helpful in every way.
We can absolutely recommend Marcia as an airbnb host, she's open-minded, interesting, fun to be with."
158345,6685321,2013-08-21,2402160,Yara,"Marcia is truly an amazing host! She made our stay very enjoying and fun and we did love time that we have spent talking to her. Our son, Ezra, was very happy to be around Marcia as well, so overall we simply couldn't have a better start to our West Coast trip.

The house is located at the beautiful Ballard district and is 10 min walk to the water and a pier where you would have an amazing view at the sunset. Take a 10 min drive the other way to Ballard Ave and you will find lots of awesome restaurants, coffee shops and cute little stores. 

We would definitely want to be back to stay at Marcia's place again sometime in future or to just come over to pay her a visit.

Thank you for the wonderful stay, Marcia!"
158345,6778263,2013-08-25,6393794,Jill,"This was a great location for everything we were attending for a wedding in the Ballard neighborhood of Seattle. Taxis were quick and reasonable, plus we were easy to find when friends had the time to pick us up. We were 'at home' so little, but Marcia had everything nicely organized and set-up so there was no getting lost or being uncertain about anything. Our first experience with airbnb was quite positive. Will definitely use again...and stay with Marcia again in Seattle if the circumstances arise!"
158345,6813625,2013-08-26,7365426,Cheryl,"We didn’t get to me our host unfortunately, but the instructions were great to get into her home. The room we had was very nice and comfortable.

The best thing we liked about it: it is within walking distance of Cafe Besalu, where you'll find the best pastries outside Europe (definitely worth a try....and the long queues outside).
We highly recommend Marcia's place, and doubly so for its proximity to Cafe Besalu :)  "
158345,7436924,2013-09-20,5208463,Julia,Marcia's home is located a view miles away from downtown in a really nice neighborhood . The view is stunning...

We were fortunate enough to get to meet her in the morning of our brief overnight stay post wedding extravaganza. Just as sweet and kind as I expected after having had such lovely interactions setting up our stay. Thank you, Marcia! "

Her house is located in a quiet neighborhood with very little traffic, near Puget Sound and Ballard main street.  The room was very clean and spacious, and the shared bathroom was a very easy situation (due to our host).  Marcia was very accommodating to our needs (especially to my wife, who has chemical sensitivities; clean house but no chemicals!)."

I couldn't fault our stay and would recommend, whole-heartedly, that you stay with Marcia. "

158345,8313275,2013-10-25,1368039,Marsha,My stay with Marcia was as delightful the second time as the first. I love the Ballard neighborhood and the comfy room.  
158345,8343017,2013-10-26,1454761,Nicole,"We were greeted by a very pleasant and witty Marcia in a bathrobe apon arrival.  She had left us a nice trial of notes and keys to get ourselves into her place.  She then continued to welcome us into her beautiful home, with every little detail taken care of.  A perfect AIRBNB host.

Marcia also drew us a hand map full of great recommendations for food.  Her map could challenge siri in a duel and win - and she drew it in a blink of an eye! 

Most of all, we loved her wit. Few people can match the wit of my BF and in a bathrobe no doubt :)

There was plenty of parking available on the street.  The bed was super comfy.

Overall a very pleasant experience.  Thanks Marcia! "
158345,8424071,2013-10-29,9637732,Joan,"We made a last-minute reservation and it turned out to be the perfect spot!  The house is in a quiet neighborhood, close to bus lines, and in easy walking distance to the downtown district of Ballard.  I've already made another reservation for my next visit to the area."
158345,8516667,2013-11-04,4706613,Shoshona,"This was my second stay with Marcia; the house is quiet and comfy, in a great walking neighborhood. Marcia is very helpful: she lent me her scissors and gave me pipe cleaners to finish the Halloween piggy costume for my granddaughter! I will return next trip!"
158345,9119949,2013-12-08,6826507,Lara,"An incredible host in a beautiful city :) I have a lot of airbnb experience, and certainly Marcia is one of the best hosts I've ever stayed with. Highly recommend staying in this beautiful home! "
158345,9304350,2013-12-20,2242299,Jim And Stefania,"Marcia's location was just perfect- bus stop at the corner and several good connections for visiting the city by public transportation. Ballard is its own neighborhood with plenty of walking opportunity, A weekly sunday market, even ballroom dancing down the street! 24 hour grocery store in walking distance.
Marcia was a perfect hostess. She offered valuable tourist ideas. She also encouraged us to use the house as our own- we enjoyed using the kitchen and sitting in the dining room to read. she has a terrific garden so we were disappointed that it was too wet/cold for us to take advantage of it during our trip. Marcia had a busy work schedule so we did not see much of her. Despite that, she found time to help me mend a personal item as she is very skilled with a sowing machine- thank you Marcia! We highly recommend Marcia .

158345,9433896,2013-12-28,10663267,Kenneth,"This is a great deal for Seattle, especially if the Ballard area is right for your stay.  A gracious host in a lovely home.  What more could you ask for?"
158345,9530964,2014-01-01,10762431,Sandi,"Marcia's home is completely comfortable and inviting, easy walking distance from all the best of Ballard (I recommend Pestle Rock Thai Restaurant - very fresh, creative yet authentic & delicious).  Marcia is lovely - I'm going back!"
158345,9553283,2014-01-02,5217252,Sara,"Had a wonderful visit. It's a cozy room, Marcia is sweet, and the neighborhood was so much fun to explore! "
158345,9748159,2014-01-07,8017942,Maiju,"Staying with Marcia was warm, cheerful, lovely, welcoming and delightful experience. Marcia is a most friendly person, even though she was not feeling well and were working a lot during our stay, she always had a big smile and nice words to us. Already before our stay she sent me good information about Seattle and search the right bus routes. We were just happy to meet her and enjoy her positive and good humor.

The room is nice, clean and tide. There is lot of light in the room and space as well. We could use kitchen when we wanted and be in the house like we are in ours. After long trip you really appreciate that! The neighborhood is beautiful and peaceful and the bus to the city leaves right front of the house. 

Thank you Marcia, we definite recommend this sweet room in Sunset Hill!"

158345,9989940,2014-01-23,11304787,Jeremy,"Great experience. Comfortable room with a nice view of the Ballard neighborhood. Quiet neighborhood with a 10 minute walk to all the best bars/restaurants in Ballard. A little far from the Capital Hill/Downtown area, the bus kind of takes forever, but a car share service like Car2Go makes it real easy. Marcia is super nice. Clean room, nice bathroom, nice kitchen available. I would definitely stay here again. "
158345,10067620,2014-01-28,11157191,Bev,"I thoroughly enjoyed my 1st experience with Airbnb and with Marcia at Craftsman in Sunset Hill, Ballard. Altho i did not see Marcia for a few days, her notes were totally welcoming and when i did meet her, she was very pleasant and open. My room was spacious, quiet, clean , convenient for the conference I was attending in Seattle. I felt very comfortable in her home."
158345,10235110,2014-02-08,2400554,Nick,"Marcia is the perfect host! She respects her guests' privacy, is very thoughtful and always a pleasure to be around. She even mended a button on my jacket for me, which I really appreciated. The house is very cozy and only minutes away from some very good eats & coffee shops, not to mention the Locks! "
158345,10257649,2014-02-10,9637732,Joan,"Thanks for everything, Marcia!  I had a great stay.  Sorry I missed you, but enjoyed the visit with Raleige.  She was very accommodating.  I hope to stay with you again this fall on my next trip to Ballard."

I would recommend Marcia's place, good stay."
158345,10692568,2014-03-03,9974913,Julia,"My friend was in town and I didn't have room for her, so I set her up nearby at Marcia's. Marcia was super responsive prior to the reservation in answering questions. The house was big, and there were cute signs leading up to the clean, neat room. Very beautiful house with artsy decorations. Marcia had left very clear information regarding the amenities, and my friend slept great! The internet was nice and strong for her to do work easily. We never got to meet Marcia unfortunately, but the opportunity worked out great!"
158345,11111123,2014-03-21,4143892,Katie,"We stayed at Marcia's for a week and a half while visiting Seattle. The room and house were exactly as described and soooo comfy! Marcia was great about communicating details and suggestions to us during our stay, and everything went smoothly. The house is in a great neighborhood with easy bus access to downtown and a quick walk into the historic district of Ballard. To save some money on our trip, we bought groceries and cooked at home for several of our meals, which was also a breeze and such a nice amenity to have! We would definitely recommend staying here to anyone coming to Seattle, and hope we will be able to come back soon. Marcia, I'm only sorry we didn't get to see more of each other during our stay!"
158345,11191589,2014-03-24,1385715,Vonelle,"Marcia lives in a lovely neighborhood very close to Discovery Park and lighthouse, which was on our must-do list and one of the reasons we choose her area. She was a very gracious hostess and even invited us to join their dinner party the first night we were there! Bed was comfy, everything was great!"
158345,11268829,2014-03-27,13007631,Karen,Marcia's home was the most welcome and wonderful place to stay. She even put up an extra cot for us and made the bed. I would certainly return and stay there again. 
158345,11280635,2014-03-28,11404283,Shawn,"This is a great house in a great neighborhood. Plenty of street parking, super comfy bed, and nice and quiet. Marcia sent an email a couple of days before our stay with all the information we needed for our stay, and she has plenty of pamphlets and flyers for area attractions. 

Easy walk to restaurants, and the area was nice for just walking around with no destination in mind. We only stayed one night, but this place would make a great ""home base"" for a longer stay in the Seattle Area.

Definitely recommended!"
158345,11309432,2014-03-29,450316,Wilhelmina,"Marcia was so gracious and her darling room and home were just right! Our travel plans were chaotic, as we were planning and orchestrating a tea party and juggling a few too many moving parts. She was flexible, understanding and speedy with communication; her house was cheery and the room was welcoming, clean and peaceful; the neighborhood, view and nearby landmarks will make you want to move to Seattle (made me want to move back!). I highly recommend this place for anyone who wants an authentic and joyous Seattle experience. "
158345,11341060,2014-03-30,11158172,Sean,Beautiful home. Marcia is awesome. Definitely would stay here again. Really close to the Locks and some nice fish and chip places. Comfortable bed. Nice bathroom. Overall a very inviting vibe. Would definitely recommend. 
158345,11418922,2014-04-01,450316,Wilhelmina,"My sister and I had a wonderful stay at Marcia's sweet craftsman home, which was cheery, clean and inviting. We slept like babies and woke up to the sound of songbirds. It was hard to leave such a great spot but as we left we had a stunning view of the Olympics from the front yard. 

We were juggling a lot of moving parts during our trip and Marcia's patience, kindness and hospitality made our time in Seattle joyful, comfortable and memorable. Staying in this beautiful part of Ballard will make you want to move (back, in our case!) to Seattle. We hope to stay with Marcia next time we're in town."
158345,11546618,2014-04-07,4307248,Janet,Marcia was helpful and responded quickly to my questions.Her home is lovely and my upstairs room felt private and was very quiet.There is a bathroom close by my room which was convenient.

158345,11721621,2014-04-13,4538731,Francois,"Marcia is just a lovely host who gave us very detailed directions to find her house. The room is very clean and is located in a very quiet neighborhood, also walking distance to Ballard, our favorite area in Seattle (lots of nice cafés and restaurants). Thanks a lot Marcia."
158345,11782531,2014-04-14,2102383,Raymond,We had a great stay with Marcia.  She made us feel welcomed immediate by offering us something to drink and eat (she just had a party that night) and showed us our room.  We also met her friend Walter and had a lovely conversation getting to know each other before retiring for the night.  The bed was nice and firm which is great for us (with bad backs). The area is safe and quiet and parking very accessible outside.  If you get the chance to stay here we highly recommend you to visit the Ballard farmer's market. It's not to be missed.  We would definitely stay with Marcia in the future.
158345,11963922,2014-04-20,13467326,Chris,"  A great place to stay! Marcia is an excellent host, we feel we've made a new friend. It was like being at home - but better.  We're talking up her place and AirBnB among friends.
  This was our first experience with AirBnB and my first visit to my hometown in over ten years and a chance to show it to my partner. Has it ever changed. We had a great time, but wish the Seattle roads weren't so pot-holey. Perhaps it was the Spring weather or the political climate, but it also seemed to me many Seattleites were more rude and depressed these days. Thankfully we had Marcia's place to hang-out in. 
 "
158345,12036557,2014-04-21,11662593,Tim,I had a wonderful stay over at Marcia's place.  My first arrival was welcomed with a personal board with my name and a welcome note.  Pleasantly surprise.  Lovely craftsman house in a great neighborhood and minutes drive to the heart of Ballard.
158345,12166992,2014-04-24,2904576,Gregory,"Marcia has a very lovely house in a nice and quiet neighborhood in Ballard. The room is very cozy and only a 15 minute walk from the heart of Ballard.

I didn't get to meet Marcia as she was out of town during my stay, but everything was setup for me when I arrived and her daughter stopped by to check in on things. Exactly what I needed!

Thanks Marcia!"
158345,12308659,2014-04-28,14350140,Jean,"A series of firsts: first Airbnb, first trip to Seattle etc. so we did not know what to expect! Happy to find a comfortable bed at the end of a very long trip from Belgium. We never met Marcia, she was out of town, but we had a very enjoyable stay at her lovely home in Ballard. We followed the instructions left by Marcia, got a little help from her daughter Raleigh who lives in a self contained apartment in Marcia's home, and otherwise made ourselves at home. Thanks!
"
158345,12659765,2014-05-07,13322597,Betsy,"This was my first experience with airbnb and it was definitely exceeded expectations.. The location was great for us.  The Sunset Hills neighborhood is a nice area to go for a walk and getting to the main shopping and dining area in Ballard took only about 15 minutes on foot.  
The bed was very comfortable and the bedding was top quality.  I really like the well organized information about things to do in the immediate and wider area.  The first few days we were there was hot and it was nice to have a fan available in the spacious closet.
Each day we started with the coffee that was available to brew in the kitchen.
Host Marcia was away during our visit, so her daughter, Raleigh stepped in and was friendly and helpful.
I hope if we visit Ballard in the future we will be able to stay with Marcia again.
"
158345,12736437,2014-05-09,1336466,Ezra,"Host and I never had opportunity to actually meet; she was returning from a trip,

My room had everything I needed, and the bed was really comfy and cozy. I have a back issue, so that was important to me. The shared bathroom was spotless clean. In the kitchen there was airbnb space for my food, and everything was labeled and easy to find. Coffee was provided and the best I've tasted!!! I did not connect with Marcia while I was there as she works at the hospital. But she communicated how I could get in touch with her if needed. I would love to return when I am back in Seattle."
158345,14218133,2014-06-15,9615326,Nathalie,"Marcia knows how to put a guest at ease to make you feel at home. I was able to use the kitchen to prepare dishes that also allowed me to save money. She respected my personal space while being available for advices, informations and practical help. For me, Marcia is a very benevolent person. 
During my stay, some renovations took place in the house, causing dust and sometimes noises (not a big deal) but Marcia was accomondante."
158345,14626449,2014-06-23,15721812,Bernard,She was very warm and inviting. Made us feel right at home. The room was comfortable and we felt at ease using the kitchen and living room downstairs. Would stay there again.

Quiet residential neighborhood.  Picolino's, a fantastic Italian restaurant, is within easy walking distance. Room is on the 2d floor with shared bath just across the hall. Due to owner's work schedule we met only once as I was checking out. A vertical fan in the room really helped to keep the air flowing."
158345,14925584,2014-06-29,16500602,Sean,"I stayed at Marcia's place for one night. The neighborhood is very safe and quiet and the room was very clean. I didn't have too many conversations with Marcia but she was very polite when asking me if I could leave the room by 10am so that she could clean the room before she left. Overall, I would recommend Marcia's place to someone who is looking for good price to stay at a good place. "

She takes an interest in her guests and genuinely cares about their needs and them as a person. My husband and I moved here from Ohio and needed a place to stay while we looked for apartments and jobs. Marcia let us do laundry, store food in her fridge, and offered us help on great things to see and do. I would absolutely recommend staying with her to anyone. She is really awesome. "

She is a warm and welcoming host, and the information she had printed up for guests made sure we knew how to use the shower and the wifi.
Marcia's home is in Balllard, and we loved exploring the shopping close by, and even made it to the Nordic Heritage Museum, a real treat.  
Anyone who stays with Marcia will enjoy the area, and a pleasant place from which to explore Seattle."

We would stay again gladly."
158345,20169557,2014-09-24,20931989,Laura,"This was a lovely first experience for me using airbnb. I've gotta repeat what many other reviewers have already said -- Marcia was so warm and welcoming, instantly put me at ease.

The house is gorgeous, has great bones, a treat to get a glimpse of. The neighborhood is so pretty and sedate, with historic houses in every direction -- residential but then too a very short enjoyable walk to old town Ballard with its many restaurants. 

This upstairs room is well situated, just across the hall from the bathroom, facing the quiet street, with big windows that give you fresh air for a great sleep. The bed is super comfortable and the linens soft and fresh. Colors are tasteful and soothing, just overall a lovely space.  Overall I had a fantastic experience, and will certainly be a repeat guest with Marcia."

158345,20948953,2014-10-08,19208444,Tobias,I had a great time in Seattle and one reason for this was staying in the great AirBnB room of Marcia. Everything was really comford and clean. To stay in Marcia´s wondefull hause is like having an little own private apartmend with an  own bathroom. I can just suggest to everybody who is looking for a calm and nice host to go to Marcia in Ballert.
158345,21069179,2014-10-11,16969603,Bella,The reservation was canceled the day before arrival. This is an automated posting.
158345,21444289,2014-10-17,22127044,Abel,"This is the perfect place! 15min to downtown Seattle and in a cute, comfortable neighborhood. Marcia makes sure you have everything you need to be comfortable & have an easy stay. We are definitely coming back next time we need a place in Seattle. "
158345,21545004,2014-10-19,16105751,Melissa,"This was my first Airbnb experience. 

Way before I arrived Marcia was good about emailing me with details and asking if I needed information on anything like transportation, etc.   She was good with providing me with details on letting myself in since she would not be home.  When I met Marcia she made me feel at ease. She was friendly and helpful in pointing out good places to eat. The room was clean and smelled fresh and clean. Her home and room is as pictured. 

I was there for two nights and pretty much gone every day until late at night. The price was just right for what I needed - a clean room with a comfortable bed and clean bathroom. 

I only saw Marcia that one day when I arrived and then it almost seemed like I had the house to myself.  I would definitely come back if I ever had to come thru Ballard which by the way, her home is very close to downtown Ballard.

Thank you, Marcia, for your hospitality and sharing me your home. 

"
158345,21661849,2014-10-21,21008070,Sheila,Marcia made an extra effort to meet us even though her work schedule is demanding. We felt safe in her home and neighborhood. We loved being able to walk to Ballard for the self-guided walking historic tour (pamphlet provided by Marcia) and the Farmers' Market.
158345,21732811,2014-10-22,12849878,Victoria,"Marcia's place is great! She is a very friendly, energetic and accommodating host. The room is comfortable + clean and I felt very welcome!"
158345,22053294,2014-10-28,13007019,Kari,"Marcia made me feel at home right away. She gave me a cupboard and space in the fridge for a little food I brought with me. I even had the pleasure of joining her and her family for dinner, which was delicious, and a nice surprise. The house is a beautiful Craftsman home with lots of nice sunlight. It is quiet, cozy, spacious and clean. The neighborhood is a pleasant 10 min. walk to several restaurants, coffee and tea shops."
158345,22164903,2014-10-31,2046720,Amanda,"Marcia is a great hostess! Warm and friendly and easy to get along with. The room was everything we wanted it to be; clean, quite close to the vibrant NW market street and within walking distance to buses heading downtown. Would definitely recommend Marcias place!"
158345,22221665,2014-11-01,17840945,Margot,Marcia was very warm & welcoming. The room was spacious and comfortable in a very nice neighborhood of NW Seattle. I recommend it highly. 
158345,22315057,2014-11-03,3086426,Marvin,"Marcia was a wonderful host and made me and my girlfriend feel welcome in her home. We didn't see her when we first arrived, but she provided us the instructions on how things worked. We met her the next day and she was friendly and helpful.

The neighbourhood is great - it's a few minutes drive from the locks and Ballard's main street, where the bars and restaurants are. You'll need a car to get into downtown, but better yet, just stay in the neighbourhood.

The room was comfortable and cozy. The mattress was a little too soft for my liking - but I have a bad back.

We would definitely stay in the area, and with Marcia, again."
158345,22660658,2014-11-11,11366107,Denise,"Marcia takes hosting guests seriously and it shows through the effort and care she puts into making the stay comfortable and her home welcoming. Had a great room and a comfy bed, can't get better than that! "
158345,22780757,2014-11-14,2623488,Nicolette,"Marcia was very prompt and thorough in her communication- which was greatly appreciated. She has a lovely historic home in the very hip Ballard neighborhood of Seattle. She is close to restaurants and shops, and there was a bus stop just down the street. Her home is clean, comfortable, and very quiet. The heater in the bedroom is fantastic. 
I also really appreciated that she cleaned the bathroom every day I was there.  The wifi was fast. Two drawbacks- the bathroom was missing a doorknob and entry through the front door was difficult. Didn't have too much interaction with her, but the little I had- she was lovely. Would stay here again. Thank you! "
158345,23014431,2014-11-20,4532746,Alaïa,"I stayed here with my mom for a night on our way back from Vancouver. Communication with Marcia was very easy: she responded promptly and sent detailed instructions ahead of time for our late-night arrival. A nice little list of helpful info about the house was on our bed, and the room was even labeled with a crafty sign. The stairs were fine, and you could sense the character of this historic home from the ""old house"" smell. The bed was comfortable enough for weary travelers, although a bit uneven/soft. There were plenty of blankets and clean towels as well as a stockpile of local maps in the closet. We only saw Marcia briefly in the morning, but that worked fine for us. Overall a cute old house in Ballard, only a couple blocks from the water in two directions (and the fish ladder at the locks) and a 10-minute walk to the cafes/boutiques of Market St."
158345,23209283,2014-11-25,14063039,Kristin,I was able to get to and from Marcia's house from the airport.  I took the light rail to downtown where I caught an express bus to her house.  On leaving I took a city bus back to the light rail and then to the airport.   A few blocks to the fish locks and walking along the water.  A few blocks the other way for coffee and rolls every morning.  A comfortable bed and quiet room.  It worked out very well for me!
158345,23485637,2014-12-01,5178343,Nicole,"Shawn and I stayed at Marcia's house  a few days ago, and it was a cozy, comfortable experience. It had been snowing and we were freezing. When we got up to our room, it was soo warm and welcoming. We didn't get to meet Marcia, but did meet her daughter who was welcoming, helpful, and sweet. We were thankful for the use of Marcia's clean and extremely organized kitchen where we cooked a little dinner and breakfast. We had a quiet, nice stay. Thanks Marcia!"
158345,23734854,2014-12-08,12972233,Nancy,This was my second stay at Marcia's.  I felt very welcome.  She has a lovely home and my room was very comfortable.  The bed was heavenly!  Marcia's home is in a lovely neighborhood.  I hope to stay there again.
158345,23817816,2014-12-11,13008405,Trish,I've stayed with Marcia on more than a few occasions. Marcia and I have become friends and I am more than familiar with her house and her neighborhood. Ballard is a great place to be around Seattle! Marcia's airbnb room is comfortable and roomie and a great value!
158345,23999250,2014-12-16,23496987,Judith,Fabulous!  Marsha's home is beautiful; she is fun and a gracious host.  The bedroom is spacious and the bed is very comfortable.  My son and daughter-in-law just moved to Seattle and I plan to make this my home away from home.  
158345,24311533,2014-12-25,24716613,Am,"Room exactly as pictured and , even better, super warm and cozy.  The bed was comfortable (I brought my own pillow and ended up liking Marcia's pillow better!)

There is plenty of room to hang out if you want to spend a lazy afternoon in. Love the sunroom and the living room. We were welcome to use the kitchen which was a huge plus. The kitchen is well stocked , has coffee tee and all you will ever need.

Marcia answered all my questions promptly and worked out key exchange in advance. Things were set up such that we would be able to enter the home even though Marcia was not there and I appreciate that.  There were notes left here and there that covers all bases (how and where to find what we need, etc.) Maps and guidebooks/pamphlets are in the room. The map of Ballard/sunset hill neighborhood was marked by Marcia so we know where her home is and where groceries stores are. 

The neighborhood is cool, quiet , but also has plenty to keep you occupied. Plenty of amazing restaurants, microbreweries, bakeries and stores (and record shops if you are into that kind of stuff!). The waterfront is just a few blocks away.

We enjoyed our stay and will definitely be back.

158345,24566210,2014-12-30,7903883,Brey,"Marcia was a perfect host. We got back to her home fairly late and had to leave early, so we didn't get to actually her. However, her notes and general communication were very welcoming and comforting. Her home was lovely and the room was great. One of the best night's sleep my husband and I have had recently. Thank you greatly Marcia! "
158345,24629718,2014-12-31,25264972,Charlie,"Ann & I enjoyed our brief stay at Marcia's house -- she responded quickly to our request, the arrangements for our stay were well communicated, and we found the accommodations very much as described: cozy, comfortable, and in a great location.

158345,25879845,2015-01-28,1368039,Marsha,"Marcia is always very welcoming and gave me a cup of hot tea with an offer of a snack when I arrived.  She carried my bag upstairs and was, as usual, helpful and friendly.  I enjoyed my stay with her.  The bedroom was cosy and warm, and I was made to feel at home.  I always feel so comfortable in Marcia's home, that it is beginning to feel a bit like home when I return."

The room was charming and we felt quite welcome. I would highly recommend if you're staying in Ballard anytime soon."

We didn't have the pleasure of meeting her in person, but she provided detailed instructions for us, and was kind enough to check in and make sure everything was going smoothly. We loved the bedroom which was quiet and peaceful. I haven't slept so soundly in weeks! Thank you, Marcia, for your hospitality. We had a great stay and would highly recommend it!"

158345,27117005,2015-02-25,14260809,Hwajin,"More than happy to leave a review for a place which made my stay most memorable in Seattle. First of all, I'd love to thank Marcia for providing a cozy and clean room. I was so lucky to meet her and her family during my stay. She was a wonderful host, genuine and caring. (She even made me some strawberry shortcake that was super delicious:))

Excellent location, safe neighbourhood, cozy room, but above all, what I loved most was her wonderful hospitality. 

"
158345,27170644,2015-02-27,2120230,Philip,Marcia's place was a great spot to explore Seattle from. Ballard is a charming neighbourhood and there are lots of nice places to eat and drink. I'd recommend The Walrus and the Carpenter on Ballard Avenue which does great seafood.
158345,27320823,2015-03-02,13356437,Rosa,"Even though our stay was short the room was clean and the bed was very comfortable. We woke up early the next morning to a beautiful sunrise with Mt. Rainier in the distance. Lovely home, quiet neighborhood very close to Ballard Locks, restaurants and shops. We felt completely at home."
158345,27562297,2015-03-07,5060744,Ding,marcia was a very welcoming host with whom the communication was easy and pleasant.  i very much felt at home in marcia's house.  the private room itself was spacious and clean.  the bed was very comfortable.  the location is great.  the spectacular view of water and the olympic range in the neighborhood was mesmerizing every single time i drove toward it.  great value overall.
158345,27684866,2015-03-09,16881531,Brennan,"We never met Marcia, but she made everything so easy via messages and written communication. The house is  charming and comfortable--although very warm! Definitely recommended. Ballard is a cute area. "

158345,28658367,2015-03-28,28188246,Hannah,"We had an awesome time staying with Marcia. She made us feel welcome and didn't hesitate to make sure we had everything we needed. She gave us great recommendations (Ray's Cafe in Ballard is delicious) and the room was comfortable, clean, and had a great view. Public transportation is easily accessible from the house and Uber/Lyft are alternatives (FYI -- for some reason when putting in the address, it goes to the road on the back of the house, so we'd usually go to the corner). We had an amazing time in Seattle and would definitely recommend staying with Marcia ! Thanks so much for the great stay."
158345,28705391,2015-03-29,26185202,Danyele,Marcia was a gracious host. Very nice and informative. She make my trip to Seattle a pleasant one.

I loved the comfy bed and level of freedom she allows to come and go. The neighborhood is beautiful and safe. Hopefully this place will be available when next I need a place to sleep in Ballard. "

158345,29304902,2015-04-06,7559074,Andrew,"My girlfriend and I stayed for 2 nights on a weekend. I really liked the house, lots of space to find a place to sit, the room was nice, the bed was comfortable. I like how organized Marcia was with house rules, labelled drawers, brochures for local sights,etc. The house was in a nice neighborhood, easy to get to the water, parks and downtown."
158345,29414797,2015-04-07,1212587,Owen,"What a great place to stay! Marcia's wonderful room was truly comfortable, a home away from home- quiet, relaxing and more spacious than we thought from the picture. It was also the perfect base to explore the really fascinating area of Ballard, with it's incredible restaurants, bars and breweries. We met Marcia briefly and she proved to be truly an welcoming and thoughtful host. Highly recommended!"
158345,29815673,2015-04-13,25835500,Neela,"Our week in Ballard was such a wonderful time! We felt welcomed and comfortable at once and loved the house and the neighborhood. Marcia was always helpful and funny, so we had no problems at all finding everything and enjoying our days. Sometimes we went home earlier to have a cup of tea and then go out again to watch the sunset. If we have the chance to come back to Seattle we would definitely try to stay with Marcia again. "
158345,30098589,2015-04-17,2316779,Matt,"Nice old house on a quiet, tree lined street, walking distance to great restaurants and the Locks.  Comfy, quiet room and an excellent, friendly host, Marcia.  Looking forward to coming back soon! "

The residential neighborhood was beautiful, with lush front gardens lining the street. It  was an easy walk down to the Ballard Locks. Marcia was very helpful giving me directions for my next destination in the city and I truly enjoyed talking with her over a cup of tea. The bed was very comfortable. I would definitely stay there again!"
158345,30524352,2015-04-23,18245963,Mary,"Marcia was wonderfully warm and welcoming to myself and 7 yr. old daughter! My daughter was quite tired out after a flight across the country. Marcia was very understanding and gave us a great recommendation for dinner and was sensitive about providing a quiet environment for both of us to get to sleep early. 
 
Marcia's home is in a quiet, beautiful neighborhood. The location is ideal for a peaceful night sleep. The room was just as described with a very comfortable bed. It was delightful to wake up to lush green and flowers galore in this quaint Ballard neighborhood. "
158345,30877436,2015-04-28,29657244,Sandra,"We had a great time at Marcia's.  Her home was lovely, our room was large and comfortable, and in a great neighborhood.  She lives close to very nice places, Ballard is very convenient for us.  We will come again."

feel welcome and comfortable. We loved visiting Seattle--
what a wonderful city you have--and staying in a home added to our ""feel"" for the city. We enjoyed our conversations with Marcia and her family

All the best,
Leonie"
158345,32522686,2015-05-19,28726641,Revathi,"We never crossed paths with Marcia during our stay since we came in and went to bed before Marcia got back from work and left after Marcia left, but Marcia's instructions were so concise and clear that our stay was very smooth and comfortable, regardless. Very comfortable room and amenities, and had a great sleep for the night. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone who's in the Seattle Area! A skip and a jump from places like Ballard Locks and the University area, which was all very convenient."
158345,32826500,2015-05-22,30993416,Kaylee,Marcia had a unique and lovely house. She gave us directions to downtown via transit and was very welcoming. We will certainly stay again if we return to Seattle.
158345,33261042,2015-05-26,1640999,Henrik,We had a great time at Marcias home in Ballard. Marcia is a nice and welcoming host and the room was lovely and clean. The neighborhood is quiet and residential and only a short drive from hip Ballard Ave. with bars and restaurants. Don't miss the Sunday's farmers market. We would most definitely stay here again.
158345,34116686,2015-06-05,26579858,Bernie,"Very organised airbnb so easy.  Marcia was great.  Helpful re buses into the city.  We enjoyed staying in a relaxed, quiet neighbourhood.  Convenient bus ride to city of Seattle.  Great kitchen and welcome use of space.  I would definitely stay at her place again."

158345,34618747,2015-06-10,25299132,Safak,Marcia's house is comfortable and quite. Marcia was welcoming and gracious host. We had a very pleasant stay. Thank you Marcia..
158345,37573066,2015-07-08,12297029,Sylvain,"Marcia is a great host, nice and welcoming. She is also very helpful on planning your stay in this wonderful city.
The place in Ballard is very cosy, nice, quite and well located since it is a short drive or even a walking distance to golden garden park and the lock.
We strongly recommand this place."
158345,37644503,2015-07-09,7248022,Kathy,Our host Marica made us feel welcome to her lovely home by sending us emails and having a cute sign outside our bedroom welcoming us.  She was flexible as we stayed for two days and then left for two days returning then for another day at her home.  She let us keep hanging clothes and a suitcase in a closet while we were gone to have more room in our car.  Her location is fabulous as it is a short walk to restaraunts and even the water that looks out to the Olympic Peninsula.  
158345,38100677,2015-07-13,11521663,Linda,"Lovely vintage Ballard home!
We loved staying with Marcia!  Upon arrival we were warmly greeted and given dinner suggestions. The room was very large and bed extremely comfortable!  We had a bathroom all to ourselves and were given instructions on how to operate the older fixtures. The home is just a few blocks from the Ballard Locks which we were surprised to discover. We had a bonus adventure there our first evening before dinner. I highly recommend staying here and would book it again when we are in Seattle!"
158345,39272795,2015-07-22,31689052,James,"What a great experience! Our hostess was completely welcoming and very helpful. She provided us with good advice about enjoying our first visit to Seattle. She made us feel comfortable in her home immediately. The room was large and the bed was perfect. The location of the house was very convenient to all of the sights in Seattle, and especially so to the very interesting neighborhoods of Ballard and Fremont. We were within 30 minutes of everything we wanted to see (and we wanted to see everything)."
158345,39595336,2015-07-25,11735167,Jakob & Wilma,It was a very pleasant stay. The bed was very good and it was very quiet.

158345,40627144,2015-08-01,37435349,Wendy,"This was my very first airbnb experience and it was a 5/5 stars! Marcia's home is beautiful and she is a fantastic host. She was very quick to respond to any questions I had and even though I only saw her once while I was there, she was the sweetest most welcoming person! She left little personalized notes for us and she also always left a few lights on at night so we would have no problems getting up to the room. The room is exactly as pictured and both the room and the bathroom were spotless when we arrived. That was a huge plus for me given that filth in general tends to give me anxiety. Ballard is quite a ways away from the airport and the downtown area, but it is a cute little part of town with tons of shops, cafes and restaurants. If you have a car, getting around Seattle won't be an issue. We used the public transportation system and it worked for us. Buses seem to run pretty late and they were never jammed packed with people or anything. All this to say, we didn't mind using the bus to get from Marcia's home to any of the touristy places in downtown Seattle. If I go back to Seattle, I would totally stay with Marcia again, so I totally recommend! Thank you Marcia!"
158345,41066478,2015-08-04,30971680,Beth,"This was our first Airbnb adventure so we weren't sure what to expect.  However, we were made welcome as soon as we entered Marcia's home and very much enjoyed our three night stay.  The room was clean and quiet, and the house was charming.  Meeting Marcia was like reconnecting with an ""old"" friend.  When we next visit our Ballard relatives, we will certainly plan to stay here again.  "
158345,41608693,2015-08-08,28284185,Colleen,"We had a wonderful stay at Marcia's place! She gave great details of how to get to her house from the airport and we had no problem finding it. Her home is very clean, comfortable, and well set-up for airbnb guests. Though we never got to meet Marcia in person, she was very responsive to all messages and made sure we had everything we needed for a good trip to (email hidden)e even accommodated an extra guest in our room by providing a cot for her to sleep on. There are plenty of brochures, maps, and information booklets in the room about what to do and see in Seattle which we really appreciated! Thank you, Marcia!"
158345,42129009,2015-08-11,34514444,Hongye,Nice host 
158345,42591252,2015-08-14,36089214,Miganoosh,"Marcia is a great host.   Although she was not home when we arrived, she gave us detailed instructions as to how to get in, and, had left us a welcome note at the entry to our room.  The room was clean and the carpet was newly cleaned.  The house was clean and it was great to have our own bathroom.  Comfortable bed and clean sheets.  When we met her later, Marcia helped us plan our time more efficiently.  Her knowledge of the local area and the amount of time required to go to Mount Rainier was right on the dot.  Although we did not use them, she thoughtfully provides her guests with a slew of maps and brochures for local activities."
158345,42828117,2015-08-16,31431590,Julia,"Marcia was a welcoming and warm host.  She left very clear instructions about staying at her home and took time to make sure I was comfortable and had what I needed.  Her house is amazing and located in a beautiful and quiet neighborhood in Ballard.  If you like older homes with a lot of charm, this is the place for you.  The room itself is spacious and very homey, with a great view!  When I come back to Seattle, I'd love to stay here again.  Thanks, Marcia!"
158345,44103299,2015-08-24,31835694,Sherri,"My host was the nicest and sweetest person ever. Always willing to help me with directions, which I always needed."

158345,44978131,2015-08-30,37085480,SienLiang,"Marcie is friendly and helpful. Great fun talking to her.  She is also very accommodating.  The room is spacious and clean.  Nice neighborhood and quiet, near the Hiram m Chittenden locks.  Would stay there again!"
158345,45282602,2015-09-01,39413469,Tim,"Marcia is a wonderful host, she made us feel very welcome in her cozy home. It was too bad we had so little time to get to know each other (because of our tight schedule), but we definitely will come back here if we visit the city again. 
To Marcia: whenever you are in Belgium, contact us and we will be honored to have you as our guest."
158345,45927212,2015-09-07,22225101,Sarah,"The host was very friendly and - caring. Lights were left on in the house for my arrival late at night.
The neighborhood is fascinating, lots to see and do. A daytime bus journey to Seattle.
The house which is a beautiful family home is spacious in a very American style.
The bedroom was very comfortable with plenty of lighting.The kitchen has all the conveniences plus coffee and tea and a beautiful deck out the back.Also, at the front a true American porch. There is a walk in closet off the bedroom.The bathroom is nearby with plenty of hot water and clean towels.
There are plenty of leaflets and maps for local attractions. It was a wonderful place to stay and I  would thoroughly recommend it."
158345,47041706,2015-09-15,37091115,Jay,"Marcia, the host, was wonderful, welcoming and always wanting to make sure I was comfortable and checking if I need anything. She was not there a lot so I had the house to myself most of the time. The house and neighborhood are very quiet and lovely. The listing was accurate. bed was comfortable with ample space and a nice bathroom. 
In hot weather the room can be warm, though Marcia has a very nice fan in the room. There is a rug in the bedroom"
158345,47984505,2015-09-22,40617629,Judith,Marcia hosted my husband and me while we were visiting my niece in Seattle. This was our first time using Airbnb. Marcia was welcoming and made us feel at home immediately. We were busy all day and it was so nice to come back to a comfortable bed and the peace and quite of Marcia's home. The neighborhood was perfect for us. We highly recommend Marcia as a host.
158345,49393426,2015-10-03,15133953,Jay,Nice accommodations and well located. Marcia was easy to work with and provided everything needed to make my stay a good one. Thanks!!
158345,49659020,2015-10-05,34788678,Janette,"Marcia was a wonderful host.  We felt welcome from our first acceptance email, in our correspondence, when we arrived and all during our stay.  It was great.    

In addition, Marcia had some wonderful touches to the comfortable, clean, quiet accommodations.  For example, lots of brochures, bus schedules, magazines and guides were available.  In the beside table drawer was a flashlight, scissors and a little sewing kit.  And she also provided a welcome guide with guidelines for our stay,  an invitation to use the kitchen and many other details that made us feel at home.

The neighborhood was very quiet and pretty.  As we expected from Marcia's listing, it was about a 10-15 minute walk to downtown Ballard. 

Marcia also kindly allowed us to drop our luggage off a bit earlier than normal check in and also leave them later then normal check out which was very nice and much appreciated.

I would highly recommend Marcia as a host and her home as great, quiet, clean and comfortable accommodations.  "
158345,53045664,2015-11-04,41422680,Lucy,"Great neighborhood, easy to walk to lots of places.  Marcia made us feel welcome although we rarely saw her.  It felt like we had the house to ourselves.  Very comfortable."
158345,54444692,2015-11-20,46549982,Geoffrey,"Five Star: *****!  Marcia's home is spacious and fragrant.  She is not only gracious but also considerate, such as providing labels so that one need not search around for things.  We felt like honored guests, or even as cousins meeting for the first time.  We liked her friends.  Her neighborhood, Ballard, is also inviting.  Our experience could not have been better."
158345,56223168,2015-12-10,39383551,Rachel,"Marcia is seriously the BEST hostess. She has a fantastic and roomy house, and the room was huge with a large walk-in closet, perfect for storing your belongings. She provided us with many amenities and allowed us access to her washer and dryer, along with the kitchen. The location is pretty close to downtown ballard, and walking distance from the locks. Although we didn't see her a whole lot, she did keep excellent communication.  I highly recommend staying with her. She is such a pleasure. We had to extend our stay, and she was very accommodating."
158345,57922371,2015-12-30,23339777,David,"We were in Seattle for three nights visiting friends and relatives. Although we did not have much interaction with Marcia (due to conflicting schedules), instructions to her house and for accessing the room and facilities were perfect. Marcia's house is warm and welcoming and the room is amply large, clean, and includes a private bathroom. This is one of the most comfortable beds we've ever slept in and combined with the super-quiet neighborhood, we had three peaceful and restful nights. Very convenient to all that the wonderful Ballard neighborhood has to offer (including some of Seattles best bakeries). We barely used our car as everything is walking distance. A fantastic experience. Highly recommended."
1633025,7427375,2013-09-19,140732,Craig,"Great location, very quite and easy to get downtown."
1633025,7539633,2013-09-23,362710,Robert,"Anthony was a fantastic host & we had some wonderful conversations.
A beautiful character home which was quiet and peaceful in a delightful neighbourhood. 
Excellent bus service and possible to walk to downtown. Close to Volunteer Park and a few minutes to restaurants & supermarket.
Thoroughly recommended!"
1633025,7612623,2013-09-26,8903429,Bethany,"I had a wonderful, peaceful stay in their house. I was very impressed with their generosity! "
1633025,7836035,2013-10-05,7815328,Paula,I had a lovely stay in this cozy home. I felt very welcome and Margot was so friendly and caring! I felt like at home. Breakfast was included which was really nice. I have only positive things to say about this place and the host. 
1633025,7893849,2013-10-07,2597303,Kirsten,"I had a great stay! A comfortable room in a quiet, convenient neighborhood. Margot was super friendly, and flexible when I arrived later than planned and my brother joined me at the last minute."
1633025,8030342,2013-10-13,1278295,David,"My stay was brief - one night - but it was a very restful and quiet evening. The accommodations are exactly as they are represented and the hosts welcoming. I would not hesitate to stay here again. A lovely neighborhood and home that lives up to the promise of a ""cozy nook""."
1633025,8069454,2013-10-14,2263650,Tony,"Margot and Anthony were lovely hosts – very kind, welcoming and all-around great people. Their clean, comfortable and cozy home is in a quiet, beautiful area that is within walking distance of many cute neighborhoods with great shopping and restaurants. We even walked downtown both days – it's really not far. (If you don't like walking, there are tons of buses nearby to choose from.) Would definitely stay again on another visit back to Seattle!"
1633025,8126612,2013-10-16,9110990,Adam,"My stay with Margot was fantastic. On very short notice, I needed a place to stay for a week while I started my new job in Seattle and searched for an apartment. Margot was more than accommodating to my situation. And when I finally found an apartment for myself, she gave me a ride to my new place so that I did not have to go to the trouble of moving all of my belongs via taxi or bus. The bed was comfortable, the location was great, and Margot is a wonderful person to talk to. I highly recommend staying here!"
1633025,8202483,2013-10-20,2134217,Jan,"Margot´s home is super nice and comfortable. She is a welcoming host and you will feel at home immediatly. The room is very clean, the bed is very good and wifi is extremely fast. The location is great, you can even walk to downtown in 20 minutes if you feel like it. Highly recommended!"
1633025,8220621,2013-10-21,8595415,Gail,"my first AirBnB experience!. Margot was a lovely & fun host and We so enjoyed the personal care, warm home and her super sweet pooch...she even jumped in enthusiastically to help us find music and dancing for Friday night! Staying in a room inside a home is much more personal and staying in a neighborhood rather than downtown at a hotel just made for a richer experience!"
1633025,8577460,2013-11-05,6426992,Michael,"Margot and Anthony were great hosts.  I enjoyed staying with them and would like to do so again.  They are interesting people.  I was busy when I was there for to race in a big rowing regatta, but their place is convenient, easy to get to downtown or the UW on the bus lines close by."
1633025,8733860,2013-11-14,9555047,Sam,"Anthony is a great host.  He has a nice setup for travelers and is very accommodating.  It was a pleasure getting to know him, and I enjoyed staying in his place."
1633025,9932497,2014-01-20,3704384,Lorne,"Margot and Anthony were very accommodating hosts! It was always convenient to come and go, and I always felt welcome to use the kitchen and the fire pit outside."
1633025,10166751,2014-02-03,11693129,Ashur,"Margot and Anthony were incredibly welcoming and hospitable. They welcomed my girlfriend and I into their home and then allowed us to find our own way offering guidance whenever and however asked. The use of their hot tub as an incredible addition to our Seattle adventure. Their house is a nice walking distance from everything that we enjoyed while still retaining a quiet tranquility. 

I would recommend their cozy nook to any and all especially for the price. It is not big and it is not fancy, but it perfectly suited my tastes. 

Thanks so much guys!!!!"
1633025,10342601,2014-02-14,4337022,Roger,"Margot and Anthony were very gracious hosts.  I stayed with them two nights, and when the first night didn't go perfectly (Margot was a little sick so not as attentive as she probably would've been), she even offered to host me for another night free of charge, which was extremely generous of her!  Of all the Airbnb's I stayed at during the week, I got the best sleep there as their futon was extremely comfortable!

Pros: really comfortable bed, own bathroom, gracious hosts, laundry on site, ample street parking, pretty central location, large/nice TV in room

Cons: other amenities not readily available: coffee/coffee maker, condiments (but you do have full run of the kitchen), no closet/hangers"
1633025,10396527,2014-02-17,11740890,Sara,"Margot was a phenomenal host! Her warmth, knowledge of the city, and interest in me getting my needs met as her guest made this a fantastic experience.  Margot went out of her way to help me navigate my trip within and leaving the city.  I highly recommend staying at this location!"
1633025,10650399,2014-03-01,12509730,K.,"An amazing first airbnb experience. Anthony & Margot's house is a sweet spot to land in. Anthony is a warm, helpful, kind host (Margot was out of town)...he offered info on buses, local coffee shops & more. I felt at home and welcomed and enjoyed our conversations, but also felt I had privacy and could be in my own zone. A wonderful balance! The room was simple, clean and comfortable and the house is a bright, welcoming space. Highly recommended!"
1633025,10718258,2014-03-04,10548838,Lois,"I had the opportunity to stay with Margot & Anthony for three nights beginning Feb. 28th.   Their home was centrally located to the bus stop and to my son, that lived a few blocks away.   The bedroom/house was quiet, the bed comfortable, the bathroom is right next door, and Lily is a very sweet greeter dog!  I would recommend their home.   "
1633025,11110591,2014-03-21,5062454,Katie,"Margot and Anthony were the perfect hosts for what was a thoroughly perfect vacation. They were warm, helpful, funny, and totally easy going. We were even treated to warm cinnamon buns and banana bread! How awesome and delicious is that?! They also have the most adorable dog in the whole world who goes by the name of Lily. Good lord, what a muffin! She is the canine equivalent of cinnamon buns and banana bread. That being said, we do NOT endorse eating her! The house itself made us feel instantly at home and was just a stone's throw away from all the wonderful things that Seattle has to offer. We will assuredly be contacting Margot and Anthony the next time we visit the Emerald City in the not too distant future because they were simply the best!"
1633025,11588394,2014-04-08,5400302,Bernd,Very friendly and natural hospitality!! I will come again.
1633025,11765122,2014-04-14,12161590,Diane,"I felt Margot's warmth and caring even before I moved in to ""The Cozy Nook"".  She sent me messages to let me know that they were eagerly awaiting my visit.  Both Anthony and Margot made me feel very welcomed in their comfortable home. Margot gave me some eggs, which were freshly laid, by their own hens in the yard. 
The room is spacious and the bed is comfortable. It was a plus using the washer and dryer on my stay. Unfortunately, I was not able to use the hot tub, but will try again on my next visit. Their newly remodeled bathroom is gorgeous! I look forward to coming back to Margot and Anthony's ""Cozy Nook"" the next time I visit Seattle. And even if you don't stay at their home, be sure to read Margot's book, PARADISE IMPERFECT, about the family's year living in Costa Rica.  I am truly enjoying it!"
1633025,12077269,2014-04-22,13221814,Lucile,"Margo is the best host. Very kind and helpful. You should really go to her place to visit Seattle. Close to eveything, a really nice neighbourhood and the house is lovely. You will really feel like home. Big room, new bathroom, i had the most wonderful journey. I wish i can go back next time i'm in Seattle."
1633025,12308521,2014-04-28,1512266,Heidi,"I had a great experience staying at Margot & Anthony's place.  Margot was very accommodating to my late check-in (between 10pm-10:30pm) which I really appreciated.  Unfortunately I didn't get to meet Anthony, and I only spent a short while talking to Margot.  Margot was lovely and very helpful with all my questions and gave me lots of recommendations for what to do in Seattle (it was my first trip there).  She was very friendly and I would have enjoyed having her around for the rest of my stay, but she was leaving town for a few days so I had the house to myself for the weekend.  

The room is situated in the back of the house behind the staircase, so even though it's on the first floor, there's a sense of privacy.  Also, the private bath is newly remodeled.

Excellent location - beautiful, quiet, charming residential neighborhood.  only a 10-15 min. walk uphill to 15th Ave., or a 7 min. walk downhill to a few more shops and restaurants.  It's also very close to the Arboretum, which I got a peek of and it looked beautiful.  A few bus stops are within a block or so, and it's a short bus ride to downtown and the tourist sites.

Amenities: 
At first I didn't care too much for the hot tub, but using it was really nice after a long day of sightseeing.  I was glad that they don't use chemicals in the hot tub.  Coffee and tea were provided for the mornings.  Margot even offered use of her guest passes for the Y.

You can't beat the price for what you get.  When I return to Seattle, I would definitely consider staying here again."
1633025,12501319,2014-05-04,13123072,Amanda,"Margot and Anthony were great hosts.  Since I was there during the week, they were of course busy with work for a lot of the time, but we managed to meet up and chat throughout the week.  I was in town for some job fairs and Margot was very encouraging and offered suggestions for further connections. The room is fairly private and quiet, so it's a great place to stay and sleep.  The location is perfect for public transportation and walking. Since I was there during nice weather, I found myself walking down to Capitol Hill quite a bit. And Lily is a super dog. I'd often find myself working on my computer and glance down to find her curled on the floor next to me."
1633025,12807043,2014-05-11,10696772,Jay,"Anthony was delightfully accommodating.  We had a crazy whirlwind schedule and didn't actually get to the house until pretty late but with good communication we minimized the impact on the house hold.  Lilly (the dog) was nice too :)  The room was adequate, the layout of the house worked well for having guests and the house is welcoming.

Thank you for hosting us and your flexibility Anthony - take care.

Jay 

P.s. The yard/garden looks amazing already.  I think I need to come a harvest some of that rhubarb for you
"
1633025,13468856,2014-05-28,2994521,Lisa,"The experience staying with Margot & Anthony was amazing! The neighborhood is lovely, very green, and very safe. The house is cute and cozy, the room is carpeted, and both the bed and the couch are comfy. The bathroom is new, very clean. The hosts have been friendly and helpful. We also enjoyed interacting with their sweet doggie :)"
1633025,13577800,2014-05-31,4274504,David,"Great stay, quiet home in a great neighborhood, 2 bus lines to downtown right there, plenty of places to eat within walking distance. "
1633025,13897905,2014-06-07,6535279,Daniel,"Anthony was a great host. The room was very cozy, homey, and highly affordable, and there's also a very comfortable couch. The dog Lily was also very friendly and playful! The place is in a great neighborhood too.

I would have preferred if there was also a table, as it was pretty hard to use my laptop in the room. Alternatively, you could use it in the living or dining rooms. All in all, I would highly recommend this place."
1633025,13984009,2014-06-09,15763134,Carol,"Great space to stay! Everything was clean, cozy, and comfortable. Wonderful quiet neighborhood, restaurants and shops within walking distance, and an easy bus ride downtown. The house has a beautiful backyard for relaxing and a delightful dog to keep you company."
1633025,15286608,2014-07-06,7114571,Danny,"This place is pretty cool.  I liked it.  And I had a beautiful July 4th here...  It is definitely a good value given its niceness, location, et cetera."
1633025,15491784,2014-07-10,726673,Summer,"Margot was very warm and welcoming from the moment I checked in. I really enjoyed our talks. Harry and Ivy where very friendly and kind also, I really enjoyed my stay and was made to feel like one of the family. When I return to Seattle I will always choose the Cozy Nook!!! The Hospitality cannot be beat!! The bedroom and bathroom were clean,comfortable, and cozy. I was told to made myself at home in the public rooms,which I did. I feel like I have made lifetime friends and cannot express enough how much I enjoyed my time with this family. Thank you Margot, Harry, and Ivy for making my stay at your home so enjoyable!!!! (Leigh)"
1633025,16198885,2014-07-23,7340618,Daniel,"Cozy Nook really does describe it. Extremely friendly dog.
Margot was a very sweet host, room was tidy, everything was in order where it needed to be. GREAT bathroom. Sofa was enough for 6' dudes, Bed surprisingly comfy. Hot tub in clean and working order.
Lots of plants and flowers, gotta dodge bumblebees in and out, but I'm a wuss.

Connected to city from bus just an easy 15-25 minutes away. Would definitely stay again."
1633025,16597675,2014-07-29,18394284,Ethan,"Margot is a great host, very accommodating and considerate, staying at her house just feels like home and the house is in very good location. She gave me lots of suggestions on Seattle city tour. I would definitely stay at her house again the next time I visit Seattle."
1633025,19085899,2014-09-06,19657623,Alexandra,This was a great place to stay! Margot and Anthony were extremely accommodating and gave us some good advice on the local coffee shops in the morning. We would definitely stay here again.
1633025,19322349,2014-09-10,6836879,Lisette,"Great stay at the Cozy Nook. Made me feel at home, lovely room and great starting point for exploring Seattle. Rented a bike for the days I was there and this made me really flexible in what I wanted to check out. Recommend staying in lovely Capitol Hill, and having a chat with Anthony."
1633025,19592257,2014-09-15,9236477,Joan,"Anthony was very welcoming. I felt comfortable coming and going from the house and doing my own thing. The place was clean, quiet and beautiful. Lovely yard and gardens and tiled front wall. I felt right at home. Used the kitchen twice, very convenient."
1633025,19803477,2014-09-18,20967269,Yeu-Li,"I stayed one night in Margot and Anthony's house. They have a charming  house in a quiet neighborhood, located about 2 blocks away from the nearest bus stop. The room was comfortable and spacious, the bathroom was very clean and new, and amenities such as wifi were very welcome. Anthony was very welcoming upon my arrival. Their dog Lily was adorable and never disturbed me in any way."
1633025,20043694,2014-09-22,20450998,Dean,This was my first experience as a Airbnb guest and Margot & Anthony made it a smooth process. Extremely clean & modern bathroom. The room was clean and was exactly as described w/ a big flat screen tv. If you want privacy then this is the place for you. Anthony was available to answer all questions that you may have even though i checked in late and checked our early to catch my flight. Definitely would stay again.
1633025,20192765,2014-09-25,16966298,Colleen,"I appreciated the convenience of this location -- many major bus lines were a hop, skip and a jump away.  There was a grocery store a few blocks away and nearby restaurants as well.  The wi-fi log-in info was much appreciated -- so much easier to learn about what was where when you are connected! Lily, the resident dog, is a doll!  Such a wonderful happy presence and a joy to play with.  "
1633025,20876526,2014-10-06,5244681,Gabriela,"Margot and Anthony were very responsive from the start.  They answered questions about their home and their neighborhood and I knew it would be a very good fit.
Everything was ready for my arrival and had the fortune of hanging out with their super cute dog!!
I am sorry I did not get to meet Margot but Anthony was very nice.
Their home is in a beautiful neighborhood and they have a super nice garden and swing in their porch
 "
1633025,21101135,2014-10-11,5900439,Heidi,"Anthony was delightful and welcomed me warmly, as did his lovely dog, Lily, who was indeed the best welcoming dog to a stranger that I have ever met! The cozy nook was quite comfortable, and the home is in a lovely neighborhood. A wonderful place to stay!"

1633025,25717440,2015-01-24,12104454,Janet,"Anthony is very friendly, helpful & like his sense of humor.  Location great, just 2 blocks away from bus to downtown.  I was gone each day 8am to 9pm, so just having a private bedroom suited me fine.  Adjacent bathroom has had a lovely remodel. I never used the kitchen or other ""family"" spaces so no comment there. Street parking was never a problem.  I wouldn't hesitate to rent this ""cozy nook"" again!"
1633025,26668579,2015-02-16,2880466,Peter,Great location walking distance to Capitol Hill fun. Cozy house with warm and generous hosts. Look fwd to returning sometime. 
1633025,26727846,2015-02-17,1475257,Charles,"I agree with all the other 100% positive comments about this cozy situation. Anthony was really friendly and helpful, didn't meet Margot. Wonderful neighborhood, great views on the walk I took. Close to cafes, pubs etc. Added plus - they have a really cute, friendly doggie! "
1633025,26771240,2015-02-18,1475257,Charles,"The cozy nook was my first and so far only experience with Airbnb. It was fantastic - Anthony was really friendly and generous, very quick to reply, and made the whole experience very easy. It was quiet and comfortable. He offered me tea and coffee and fresh eggs from his own chickens. 100% positive experience."
1633025,27292429,2015-03-01,3831403,Peter And Sarah,"This is a great choice for a Capitol Hill-focused low budget trip. Margot and Anthony were very accommodating regarding a last minute change. The room was nice and clean, the home seemed very comfortable and it was nice to have a guest bathroom right next door. We also loved being greeted by their ridiculously cute dog in the morning. Great communication. Thanks!"
1633025,27612635,2015-03-08,28348966,Megan,Anthony made us feel very welcome our first night and answered all of our questions about the local area. The house was beautiful and exactly as described in a very nice quiet neighborhood setting. The free parking was a huge bonus for us because we drove to Seattle and we would recommend staying here to all of our friends. 
1633025,29151465,2015-04-04,22222067,Aj,"This place was great. The neighborhood was peaceful and adorable, but not too far from downtown, so it was a perfect place to stay the night. They were very accommodating, and even though I came in very late, they were thoughtful and left a treat for me to give Lily at the door (though she never even barked - just snuggled!). I loved it here and would definitely stay here again. "
1633025,29584619,2015-04-09,2796726,Christina,"I had a wonderful experience at Margot and Anthony's. Sadly Margot was out of town during my stay but Anthony was a delightful host and made me feel incredibly welcome - as did Lily, the resident dog who is truly the sweetest and most loving animal I have ever met. 

The house itself is stunning and you can't ask for a better location - a few blocks from the Seattle arboretum (gorgeous) and a three minute walk to major bus lines that take you straight through hip and fun Capitol Hill to downtown Seattle / Pike Place Market.

The room I stayed in was impeccably clean and larger than I expected.  The bed was surprisingly comfortable and despite my jet lag, I woke up incredibly refreshed and ready to start my day (it helps to wake up to beautiful songbirds and a gorgeous blooming garden outside your window). 

The room also has a private bathroom, which is newly remodeled and fancier than most hotels. That said, if you are looking for a gorgeous, relaxing, safe and quiet environment in the heart of Seattle, look no further - this is the place for you.

1633025,29960206,2015-04-14,26343430,Chris,"Didn't get to meet my hosts but the place is lovely and the bed comfy. 
Awesome shower and a pretty garden as well."
1633025,30247340,2015-04-19,30268210,Lynne,"I had a very comfortable stay and Anthony was a very friendly and warm host.  He made arrival and check-in very smooth and was helpful in answering my questions about the surrounding area and offering suggestions.  The house is very well situated on a quiet street and is within walking distance to some great little restaurants and coffee shops.  The room was very clean, quiet and spacious with a sofa, chair and large screen TV in addition to a comfortable bed.  Overall a great stay!"
1633025,30622043,2015-04-25,20975666,Joanne,"Very accommodating, friendly, & easygoing hosts- very clean & comfortable space. Made us feel right at home! The house is in a great location, short bus ride downtown. Would definitely reccomend & stay here again!"
1633025,33543296,2015-05-29,28282752,Mary,I had the best time staying in this cozy room. I didn't get to spend much time with Margot but Anthony was a fantastic host. They made me feel right at home and I was actually very sad to leave. Their home is surrounded by beautiful gardens and friendly neighbors. It is a perfect escape out of busy downtown seattle but is still walking/biking distance to all of the restaurants and fun the city has to offer. The room is also a good size with windows on both sides so you get a wonderful breeze. I couldn't recommend this place more. Both the place and people greatly exceeded my expectations. :)
1633025,33723237,2015-05-31,33615324,Dean,"Great place, close enough to downtown that it was a pleasant walk in summer but far enough away that it is peaceful at night.  Anthony & Margot were very welcoming and made me feel very comfortable in their house.  Check-in was easy and had a really enjoyable time there.  Would stay again."
1633025,34876854,2015-06-13,33283169,Jonathan,"Margot and Anthony were wonderful hosts. The house was conveniently located on several frequent bus lines and within walking distance of the main parts of capitol hill. The room was comfortable, quiet, and clean."
1633025,36126762,2015-06-25,31779563,Nikolas,"Great host - great house - beautiful and calm neighborhood and it´s easy to reach Seattle Downtown by bus! 

Highly recommended ! "
1633025,36420690,2015-06-28,7077495,Miriam,"Anthony was very helpful showing us the bus schedule so we could get to class on time. We pretty much had the place to ourselves with Lilly the dog. It was a hot weekend, a fan in our room would have been nice  The beds were clean and comfortable, the bathroom was nice, wished there was a place to sit in the cool back yard. Quiet neighborhood close to everything we needed!!"
1633025,37852501,2015-07-11,32341482,Antoine,"I really enjoyed my Stay by Margot & Anthony, the house was clean and well equiped. 
Everything was readdy as I came, my bed and some towel. A book with a short description of the house and the shops and transport possibilities around the house was left for my convenience. 
Great stay, a place I can recommend! "
1633025,39752630,2015-07-26,31183941,Nerida,"My daughter and I stayed here for a mini vacation.  Margot & Anthony were out of town so they gave us a heads up with some info on where to find things.  We loved it!  Our room was cozy and the bath had a nice shower.  We loved waking and hearing the soft cluck of the chickens, they had a lot of personality! We really liked the neighborhood and were within a mile of most things with easy access to bus or light rail.  We would definitely stay again."
1633025,41759339,2015-08-09,34794956,Edwin,It was a good place to stay! Comfy Room ;)
1633025,43813172,2015-08-22,37545350,Iwona,"Excellent! Margot was such a great host - thank you so much for all. 
Highly recommended. Well positioned charming house on a lovely, safe street in this beautifully hilly & green area of Capitol Hill. If life allows I'll be back again! "
1633025,45840759,2015-09-06,28194251,Amaris,Everything was just as expected and we loved it! We weren't there very much but when we did see Margot and Anthony they were both very welcoming. They also have a super friendly dog that we got to play with for a little bit. If I am ever in the area I hope I can stay here again! 
1633025,50824561,2015-10-14,44628638,Peter,"I booked this just as I was pulling into Seattle  so I'm fortunate Anthony was able to accommodate me on short notice. Anthony is a super nice guy who answered any questions I had, provided me with some ideas on what to see in Seattle and beyond that just let me do my thing. Super easy, super comfortable (bed was really comfortable!) and in a neighborhood that's quiet at night but close to the action. A+"
1633025,53651916,2015-11-10,2991837,Dan,"This place is great. Quiet. Easy walk to cafes, restaurants, and stores. Clean and comfortable. I definitely recommend it and hope to return myself."
1633025,56703033,2015-12-16,49892608,Andrew,Margot and Anthony have a very nice place in a great location.  Its on the quiter side of capitol hill but still a short walk/bus ride to plenty of bars/restaurants.  I had a great stay and would definitely stay here again if I wind up back in the area.
9373607,54205689,2015-11-16,18894186,Matthew,"Leo and Katie were fantastic hosts- they are happy to recommend things to see and do around the neighborhood, and I was very comfortable in the loft bed after working all day. Their apartment is walking distance to everything in the University District so it is super convenient to get around as well!"
9373607,55033718,2015-11-27,18697184,Elvin,Leo and Katy was amazing :) their place was really close to everything and easy to get to wherever you are going in Seattle. They were also very friendly and nice

Their home is conveniently located near the University of Washington as described. "
9373607,56098705,2015-12-08,15045862,Melissa,Katy and Leo are wonderful hosts. They made us feel at home and even gave us recommendations on where to go in Seattle. They are a quirky couple who will help you out if you need anything. The place is also very accessible with many shops and buses nearby. Getting to downtown is easy. I definitely recommend this place if you're looking for an affordable and cosy place to stay at (;
9373607,56282162,2015-12-11,50599791,Jose,The place is all that you can see in the pictures. A cozy loft bedroom very clean and smells very good. Leo and Katy are great host they are always willing to help you in anythign you need. I have a very good experience during my stay with Leo and Katy and I don't hesitate to stay with them again.
9373607,56748403,2015-12-17,16400110,Elizabeth,Leo was great. I arrived very late (i.e. around 2am) and he met me at the door and made me feel welcome. The place was as described. I would definitely stay here again.
7402190,39134936,2015-07-20,9455871,Alex,"Carolina's place was simply amazing. The house, room included, is super clean with no pets, so those of you with pet allergies can rejoice! Carolina is an excellent host and the location is easy to get to from Capitol Hill or downtown Seattle."
7402190,39466662,2015-07-23,9455871,Alex,Carolina was an excellent host and very considerate. I had a wonderful time chatting with her after work and her place is super clean. Would stay again when I am in town!

7402190,39856157,2015-07-26,37716911,Sam,"Carolina's place exceeded my expectations.  Very nice and modern appointments.  The place was exceptionally clean, and I would think ideal for someone with allergies.  I only had one brief interaction with Carolina, but she was very sweet and accommodating.  For the most part I was out in Seattle exploring, but this was a great place to come home to.  Located on a quiet street.  In all -- ideal.  "

7402190,40987851,2015-08-03,5913054,Donn,"The room was exactly as advertised. Very quiet a good place to crash after a busy seafair weekend. Door was a bit tricky, but not problematic.  Carolina is a very gracious hostess very welcoming."
7402190,42438343,2015-08-13,38719705,Victor,"Nice room, private, with TV, it was cool enough even though it was hot outside. 
The host was very friendly and she had everything set up when I arrived. She facilitated all I needed from the house. The neighborhood was fine as well. I could Park the car across the street without any issues. Totally recommend this place for anyone."

7402190,43099999,2015-08-17,17310534,Laura,"Carolina's place was great. Be aurícula house, not far from downtown, in a quite residencial neighborhood and with a huge grocery close too, so you can get there your dinner after a nice day around the city, or a good breakfast to start a brand new day. 

The room has all what you need, including a closet and a great TV. Wifi runs well. Everything is clean, the bathroom is big and the kitchen has all you can need. 

Carolina couldn't be at home for checking in, but the comunication with her was easy and fast. In fact, we were talking each other before our visit to Seattle in English often, and she can sepas Spanish too perfectly. 

We would be back at her place again. "
7402190,44806936,2015-08-29,10853262,Tom,"The home was beautiful, our room was well kept and very comfortable. Would definitely recommend Carolina's airbnb listing!"

7402190,45431936,2015-09-02,4254997,Tanya,This home is brand new (recently renovated!?) and was clean as a whistle.  It was very easy to access and I slept very well in the spare bedroom. There is on street parking and it was quiet.

7402190,47831440,2015-09-21,26638161,Lindsey,"Carolina has a great home - very comfortable and clean. She made it very easy to coordinate our late arrival and was a kind host.

 "
7402190,47986154,2015-09-22,303764,Melissa,"Carolina, was an excellent host. As stated her home was beautiful,clean and tidy. She had prepared towels and blankets for us before we arrived and had a bunch of travel information to get around Seattle. Overall the experience was short and sweet, no complaints. Just only wish we could have stayed a bit longer.  "
7402190,48056628,2015-09-22,41148522,Sandy,The host canceled this reservation 15 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
7402190,48593404,2015-09-27,43238250,Cara,It's a beautiful neighborhood close to everything if you have a car. The house is beutiful and very clean. The bedroom allows us 2 ppl to rest comfortably and Carolina happens to be not around during our stay so basically we have the house all to ourselves. I would definitely recommend Carolina's place to anybody who needs a good place to rest and tour in Seattle city. During our stay Carolina was always quick to respond to any of our needs. I believe if Carolina's around she'll be a great host to live together and would be super helpful for the first-timers to Seattle city. Thanks a lot Carolina.  
7402190,49049977,2015-09-30,81855,Narissa,"It was a pleasure staying with Carolina. Her place is clean and very comfortable. She was very hospitable and made us feel welcome.

The back porch area was especially nice. And the location can't be beat if you're looking for a peaceful locale - it's a beautiful residential area with plenty to do just 5, 10, or 20 min walk away. Transit access is also readily available. "
7402190,50190765,2015-10-10,850221,Lori Michele,"Carolina's place is safe, clean, comfortable and quiet!  It was easy to catch an Uber or Lyft downtown for my events that I was in town for.  I didn't meet Carolina.  We did share messages and she was very responsive.  Thanks!"
7402190,53327518,2015-11-08,36298614,Kevin,"Carolina has an awesome place. Clean, safe, and quiet. She was very friendly, and she invited me out several times with her fiends in Seattle."
7402190,54825005,2015-11-23,3017488,Mark,"Grey accommodating host with a beautiful unit. Place was very clean, spacious and chic. Parking was easy to find and the entire experience was great. Just be aware that it is a nearly queen size pull out couch bed, not a real bed. :)"
7402190,56429123,2015-12-13,2919265,Nancy,Carolina was very welcoming and accommodating though I did not get to meet her in person. Coordinating arrival was very easy and efficient. Her house was lovely and a great place to explore Seattle. 
7402190,57068494,2015-12-21,50477135,Wee,"It was a safe and quiet neighborhood. Transport towards downtown is just a less than 5minutes walk away. Carolina was helpful and always reply to all my queries. Although i did not see her during this trip, i will definitely stay at her place again if i am back in seattle!"
3269390,14646413,2014-06-23,16547040,Anna,"Diane is a wonderful host and was extremely accommodating, our flight came in late and she was more than happy to work with us. The cottage itself was beautiful and well maintained and the neighborhood was very safe. We would not hesitate to stay here again whenever we're in Seattle. "
3269390,14878133,2014-06-28,16503998,Lauren,"Loved our stay with Diane!  Great location, wonderful amenities, easy check-in/ check-out.  Would recommend to friends and family!"
3269390,15060840,2014-07-01,512242,Kelly,"This place was great it is exactly like the pics, only better. It was very clean, tons of storage, very relaxing. We loved the neighborhood it was quiet, but not so far from places if you need. The drive to down town was quick and easy and the Ballard is just a quick shot north. We could walk to a grocery store to get some basics so we didn’t have to go out just to get a drink or snack.  There are great places to eat a few blocks away on Princess Anne (Grub for breakfast, a must go!).  Diane was very polite and gave us our space, but let us know she was around if we needed her even gave a quick whats where when we got there. Check in and out was easy. I would absolutely recommend it to someone."
3269390,15412255,2014-07-08,10286257,Kimberly,"Diane was a great host! Didn't get the chance to meet her but there was plenty of communication before and during the trip. She provided detailed instructions on how to find the place, and the cottage looked exactly like the pictures! The washer/dryer came in handy, and the one-time use detergent packs were convenient. There was also plenty of closet space. The neighborhood is nice and quiet, and downtown is only about a 10 min drive away. There is a bakery just around the corner, which is good for breakfast before venturing out for the day. Would definitely recommend this cottage - great location and it felt homey!"
3269390,16717966,2014-08-01,12743532,Dawnyale,"The listing was even better than the posting describes.  The neighborhood is a walker's paradise. There are so many restaurants, bakeries, and coffee shops within walking distance.  One of the best parts is the distance to Kerry park.  All of the iconic pictures of Seattle are from Kerry park.  It is a must do for any person in the Seattle area. 

Diane was very gracious and the place was perfect for our arrival.  She checked in with us after a few days to ensure that we had everything that we needed.  It was a great place to spend some time in Seattle. 

I would definitely recommend the space :) "
3269390,17244667,2014-08-09,9932372,John And Karolina,Everything as advertised. We really enjoyed our time in Seattle with Diane.
3269390,17471860,2014-08-12,19063301,Monika,"The cottage was quite lovely and communication with Diane was always prompt. Even though, I did not get the pleasure of meeting Diane, her personal disposition through a phone screen was quite pleasant. I strongly recommend if you are looking for lovely accommodations in the Queen Anne area to look no further! "
3269390,18057246,2014-08-21,5789750,Darren,"Very nice cottage.  Clean, finishes were top notch and great location.  The area was a very nice part of the city with easy access to all the attractions and many restaurants around it.  We were able to walk downtown in about 30 mins or so, and a bus ride back  up the hill was easy to catch. We would definitely stay here again if we are in town.  Diane was a great host.  Any issues we had were handled promptly."
3269390,18200756,2014-08-23,16542191,Jason,"Diane was quick to reply when I requested a shorter stay for my parents while they were visiting Seattle. My parents were very pleased with the cottage. Clean, comfortable and well decorated. I'll definitely consider Diane's Cottage when friends and family visit in the future. Thanks!"
3269390,18695767,2014-08-30,20373139,Mike,This was are first experience with Airbnb and won't be our last. A beautiful studio that had everything we were looking for. Diane made us feel welcome from the minute we arrived!
3269390,19139013,2014-09-07,16755521,Michele,"Nice neighborhood, very  comfortable space, and convenient easy access to down town and great neighborhood stores and coffee shops."
3269390,19516572,2014-09-14,902386,Lisa,"Lovely Cottage
Quick responses from a wonderful Host"
3269390,19737025,2014-09-17,13251842,Dan,Great place great host!  Thanks Diane!
3269390,19890774,2014-09-20,20629669,Jared,"We just stayed with Diane this September for 3 days.  Her place is a cute little cottage in a great part of Seattle.  There are a couple of coffee shops right at the corner (Macrina Bakery was fantastic).  A bus runs right past the house, so it's very easy to get downtown.  Kerry park was within walking/running distance and allowed for some very pretty sunsets while we were in town.  Queen Anne Ave is right down the street and has more restaurants, coffee shops, ect.  Overall it was a great location and the place was fantastic.  Diane was great!  This was our first experience with Airbnb and she made it very easy.  She even let us into her cottage a couple of hours early!  If we ever come back to Seattle we will certainly love to stay with her again.

"
3269390,20137033,2014-09-24,16211663,Candace,"Diane's guesthouse was even better than the pictures. I knew she had to have had some design training because the space was so perfectly used for comfort and beauty. The storage is so generous you can have your suitcases out of sight and find everything. There is a lovely, cozy, sleeping area, a nice sofa, and a well equipped kitchen, including coffee and condiments (which we didn't use). I really appreciated the soft lighting as well. The bathroom has a big, walk-in shower with a good shelf for toiletries. Diane even provides good quality shampoo and conditioner. There is a stackable washer and dryer and loads of extra towels in the bathroom.
The neighborhood is amazing! Restaurants and shops are steps away. Macrina's bakery is famous in Seattle, and it doesn't hurt to have a full service grocery store about 20 steps from the door!
Diane gave perfect directions and was very helpful."
3269390,20579964,2014-10-01,8922312,Kyle,"Diane made my girlfriend and I feel extremely welcome upon arrival and even went as far as giving us a little tour of the unit and suggestions of nearby eateries, watering holes and markets. We stayed for four nights and enjoyed every second. The location is perfect if you want to be near all the sites Seattle has to offer but don't want to stay in the busy/noisy downtown area. The studio is no more than 2.5 miles to any of the major attractions. We took uber and lyft pretty much everywhere and never paid more than $8-$12 each way. The airport is reachable by train/bus or uber/taxi. The train/bus combo costs about $6 and an uber to the airport will run you about $30 ($75+ from the airport as they only allow black cars at SeaTac, no uberx). Overall a great experience and we will definitely venture back to Diane's if the chance arises. "
3269390,20897048,2014-10-07,18518466,Roy,"We were late getting to the cottage but Diane was waiting for us at the gate to the cottage upon arrival.  A very pleasant welcome.

The cottage was as advertised and pictured...so very charming and clean as can be.  We loved it.  The neighborhood was also charming...and convenient...with a very short walk thru an alley to a (I use the word again) charming market with everything you need available, including fresh hot soup, coffee and a variety of quality pastries.  Queen Ann Dr, a few blocks away, is replete with shops, restaurants, markets, et al. 

All in all a wonderful stay in a charming cottage and neighborhood."
3269390,21036432,2014-10-10,227322,Kathleen,"We loved our stay (3 nights). The cottage was beautiful inside, and the location is perfect: close to Ken's market for food (one half block away), a coffee shop called Bustle around the corner, and the #2 bus one block away. You do not need a car here. Walking the neighborhood is a vacation in itself. And the main Queen Anne area is a 10 minute walk away with restaurants. Along the streets, you might find a little ""free library"" box with great paperbacks to read.  Now about our stay: very comfortable bed, cotton sheets. Lots of storage for clothes and luggage. Wonderful cooking area, just as it appears in the pictures. The bathroom is great with a shower I'd love to have at home. It has a handle set away from the water flow, so you can adjust the temperature easily, then step in. There is even a stack washer dryer in the bathroom. The patio area was so nice and private. We sat at the table with our glass of wine and watched the moon rise.  Diane was very communicative and helpful.   "
3269390,21335010,2014-10-15,14857605,Pat,"Diane gave us ample notice and reminders about our stay. The cottage was warm, clean and inviting. It was the perfect location for us. The off street parking was great. Very walkable neighborhood, many stores and bakeries as well. We would definitely stay there again. The overall stay was wonderful!"
3269390,21592435,2014-10-20,21013137,Sarah,We had such a wonderful time staying in your cottage last weekend. We were able to walk to or ride the bus to many of our favorite places around town which made things very easy. Having a washer and dryer was wonderful as it was rainy--warm dry clothes were very welcome! Thank you so much for your hospitality.  I've already recommended your place to friends.
3269390,22231054,2014-11-02,20485073,David,"We stayed in Dianne’s cottage for 8 nights.  The cottage was exactly as represented on AirBnB.  The cottage was newly remodeled with beautiful granite cabinets, fresh white cabinets, wood laminate floors, marble shower and bath floor.  It’s exceptionally clean and is nicely decorated.  Plenty of closet and drawer space for our “longish” stay.  Equipped with everything you need for dining (dishes, tableware, cookware, stove/oven, microwave oven, utensils, etc.).  There’s even a gas grill on the fenced patio.  Diane provided many little things that you need (but often forget) when staying in a unit with kitchen and laundry.  She included: Keurig style coffees, tea, sugar, butter, condiments (Ketchup, Mustard, Mayo, etc.), spices, etc.  Laundry soap and dryer sheets were also included.  The nicely appointed unit is essentially a great room with a separate bath/laundry room.  A parking space, WiFi and DirecTV are provided.  The cottage is located in a wonderful neighborhood at the top of Queen Anne’s hill. We enjoyed several neighborhood walks and enjoyed the many “stairs” in Queen Anne (Diane provided a map of all the stair locations.)  Don’t miss the incredible Seattle skyline/harbor view from Kerry Park. We also enjoyed several nearby restaurants (5 Spot, Betty’s, Hilltop Ale house) and shopped for groceries at the nearby Trader Joe’s and Safeway.  We really enjoyed staying in the friendly and quaint Upper Queen Anne neighborhood.  It’s just minutes to the harbor, downtown, the space needle, Pikes market and access to I-5.  We will plan to stay at Diane’s cottage during our next visit to Seattle."
3269390,22460519,2014-11-07,862835,Colleen,"Diane's Guest Cottage is perfect in every way! It has everything you need and is very clean and well located. We enjoyed our stay while in Seattle and the guest cottage was just right for us. The area is one of the best neighbourhoods in Seattle and you have shopping, restaurants, cafes and everything just a few blocks away and also around the corner!
Diane is a conscientious host and answers quickly and she has supplied the cottage with everything you will need and extra1
I highly recommend Diane's Guest Cottage!"
3269390,22730064,2014-11-13,12442701,Susan,"Diane communicated w/ me before my arrival re: directions, which was helpful. Since I arrived late, she turned on the lights. The neighborhood is very quiet and safe and I walked each day up to the village shops and restaurants. It's a cute little place for one. "
3269390,22906932,2014-11-17,3904278,Michael,"The Stand alone Guest Cottage is fabulous. Everything is new, the place is clean, and it's located in a great neighborhood - Upper Queen Anne. Few minute walk to downtown Queen Anne. We drove but preferred to use Lyft from downtown Pike Place Market."
3269390,23034241,2014-11-21,7085929,Julie,"The guest cottage is as described.  Great location on QA hill, quiet, clean, comfortable.  Diane was very responsive.  I would return again."
3269390,23332281,2014-11-29,22115824,Neal,"
Diane's ""Stand Alone"" is a great choice and all that it was described. A great location, very clean, very comfortable and very quiet with all the amenities one or two people need for a week's stay in Seattle. With off street parking and a very short walk to the bus line transportation issues are all covered and its convenience to upper Queen Anne restaurants and shops provides wonderful options for visitors. All in all a great value.  Neal."
3269390,23593766,2014-12-06,20803436,Angela,"Beautiful neighborhood location with off street parking, close to many shops and restaurants. Cottage is impeccably decorated with many amenities including a Keurig with coffee, washer/dryer, current magazines and even condiments! We would definitely stay again and recommend to friends. Everything was exactly as promised and more! "
3269390,24522780,2014-12-30,11163143,Kathleen,"This stand alone cottage in Upper Queen Anne was a nicely designed, compact living space with everything to make guests comfortable. The cottage is as depicted in the photos. Diane was quick to answer our inquiry emails, provided directions to the cottage, and left keys for us. We met Diane one time but otherwise we had our privacy. The neighborhood is quiet. We have been in Seattle numerous times so we were not there as tourists but were there for a family event. I knew I would be doing lots of cooking and the cottage kitchen had everything I needed: cookware, utensils, a full size refrigerator, large farm house sink, good garbage disposal, undercounter lights, lots of counter space, cabinets, a small pantry and plenty of closet space with drawers and hangers. There is also a compact front loading washer and dryer which worked just great as we did many loads of laundry. The cottage is less than a five minute walk from Ken's Market and although not an inexpensive grocery, it was convenient and easy to get to for food items. Just a few minutes away are a Safeway and a Trader Joe's as well. There are also a number of small shops and good restaurants along Queen Anne Avenue. Would certainly recommend this property and we would stay here again. "
3269390,25012292,2015-01-05,22404703,Kenaz,"Diane's guest house is situated in Queen Anne, very conveniently located to restaurants and activities. The guest house is very comfortable and was extremely clean. Thanks Diane for a great trip!"
3269390,25616999,2015-01-20,7070652,Stephanie,"Diane made it easy to check in with good directions and instructions about parking and keys. The cottage and its fittings seemed practically brand new, the place was immaculately clean, and we found it perfectly comfortable for our short stay. The neighborhood is beautiful and convenient to other parts of Seattle. I would definitely stay here again and highly recommend it."
3269390,26099538,2015-02-03,4886921,Angela,The cottage was perfect for our needs! Exactly like the pictures and nicely appointed. It was a perfect location for us and getting downtown was easy although there are a number of wonderful shops and restaurants that are walkable. Loved it!!
3269390,26322834,2015-02-09,25773433,Sarah,We enjoyed our time in Diane's cottage.  Everything was as described and it worked perfectly for our needs.  Thank you!
3269390,26730541,2015-02-18,591564,Faith,"Diane thought of everything! She has an eye for detail which made our stay wonderful. The kitchen was fully stocked with pans, baking sheets, and major appliances. She also had a full sized refrigerator and washer/dryer (fully functioning for medium sized loads). The bonus was the wonderful heat vent that would go on in the bathroom so when you got out of the shower it was nice and toasty. I would absolutely stay here again because it had all the amenities like home, was private, clean, and well decorated. While we never personally met Diane, she was extremely responsive and had the place super clean upon arrival. There is a great neighborhood grocer (Ken's) and a lovely bakery/coffee shop (Macrina) just a walk around the corner. We preferred to have a car (fantastic that this has 1 parking spot); I would suggest doing so if staying in the Queen Anne area if you want to tour Seattle. The only thing that I didn't notice was WiFi, but not a problem for us. Terrific stay, Diane! Wish every AirBNB was just as great as this cottage was for us."
3269390,27147680,2015-02-26,2469622,Thomas,"The cottage was very clean and looked as in the photos. Diane provided many amenities -- coffee, soap, shampoo, detergent, condiments, plenty of towels, etc. The only thing missing was toothpaste. I assume she'd have given me some if I'd asked, but instead I bought some from the nearby Safeway's. Diane was accessible and friendly.

The cottage is located in the heart of Queen Anne, atop the hill. If you enjoy long walks, and don't mind walking up and down the hill (it's steep), you can even walk to the Space Needle or Pioneer Square.

The WiFi didn't work at first, but after a quick talk with Diane I got it running. I think the problem was that the password is case sensitive, and I didn't know that. 

The cottage has Direct TV with access to 100s of channels. "
3269390,27464071,2015-03-05,26708999,Bev,"We were very pleased with the accommodations it was just as advertised. It served perfectly as our home away from home. Behind the mirror doors was a most generous amount of storage; drawers, shelves, hanging area and enough room to get our suitcases out of the way. The queen bed has a memory foam mattress - very comfortable. The local grocery was a half block away - so convenient. Diane supplied many extra niceties: kurig style coffee maker with coffee and creamers, zip lock bags, a great assortment of kitchen utensils, dish soap and cleaning supplies, laundry soap, shower soap and gel, shampoo and conditioner, hair dryer, garbage bags, plenty of towels, and some local interest reading materials, maps, and schedules. There is an ample amount of outlets for recharging electronic devices. It was to chilly to use the outdoor patio and grill but what a nice space to have in warmer weather. We would definitely stay here again."
3269390,27736469,2015-03-10,7057736,Joe,"Can't add much to the glowing reviews already posted..spotless, full of amenities, quiet, comfortable, private parking, in a safe neighborhood close to groceries and coffee, public transportation.  Didn't meet Diane, as I had a full schedule, but communication was quick and efficient...I'll be back."
3269390,28307293,2015-03-22,2914881,Amy,"I had an absolutely wonderful time at Diane's lovely guest cottage. It was well stocked with all the amenities one would find at home, providing a truly comfortable and welcoming place to stay. The location was great, communication with Diane was prompt and easy, and I truly could not have been more comfortable - in fact I have already booked a repeat trip a few months down the road. Thanks Diane!"
3269390,29023701,2015-04-02,11278939,Elisabeth,"Diane was very available when I needed to contact her. She made sure I had everything I needed and gave me clear directions on how to access the cottage. The place itself was amazing! The layout is really nice inside and accurately reflects the pictures online. The fact that it included wifi, washer dryer in the unit, a parking space, privacy, high-end finishes, private bath, and directv (with a ton of channels) is hard to find and made the unit feel extra luxurious. I had the perfect stay. Additionally, I accidentally broke a glass while washing it and dropping it in the sink and Diane was very understanding and nice about it...even offering to send in her handyman to help clean it up. I would love to stay here again. Everything was perfect, perfect, perfect!"
3269390,29551297,2015-04-09,27136484,Colleen,"Absolutely loved this cottage. It was clean, cute, and had all the kitchen items you'd need to cook for yourself instead of eating out! Easy walk to the best bakery in Seattle, Macrina. Easy to walk the Queen Anne area and right by a bus route that takes you downtown. Would stay here again in a heartbeat! "
3269390,29839961,2015-04-13,20177055,Nancy,"Diane's Guest Cottage was fantastic - it was a great size for 2 people, and we greatly appreciated the off-street parking. The location can't be beat - the neighborhood was quiet and easy to navigate, with tons of food options up on Queen Anne Ave. A couple of other key touches were the ample closet space and the nicely done shower & bathroom. We would love to stay here again!"
3269390,31528645,2015-05-06,25680058,Juliet,"Diane's Queen Anne cottage was so nice, it made me rethink how much house I really need.  Just as the pictures show, the space is new and nicely decorated with high-end finishes. The kitchen is complete with appliances and a huge refrigerator plus the little things like spices, cling wrap, foil and even chip clips.  Trader Joe's is nearby and I saved a bundle eating in. The bed was very comfortable and there was plenty of hanging and storage storage space for clothes  Diane was available to offer tips on the Seattle scene, and made sure I had  someone to call if she wasn't home.  

It would have been nice to have an overview of how things worked, like the wifi code, recycling bins, thermostat etc.   The wifi is pretty sketchy so I hope she gets a booster.  She supplied plenty of Keurig coffee pods but the machine did not perform well, and although I found Seattle tap water to be drinkable, it would have been nice to have a filtered water dispenser in the fridge.

The location was great.  Close to city sights and central to freeways.  The cottage backs onto an alley with a dedicated parking spot.  I was surprised how quiet it was, and perfectly safe.

Don't miss Discovery Park on the coast, just 10 minutes by car with its 11 miles of hiking trails, awesome views, a lighthouse and pretty beach."
3269390,31950975,2015-05-12,20176746,Bryan,The pictures and description do a great job of capturing the essence of the Guest Cottage. Although Diane was not around during our stay she was very responsive to a couple of our questions and very accommodating. The cottage is perfect for a couple and good enough for a small family. A very nice abode in a wonderful neighborhood. An easy walk to fantastic food and drink options and public transportation is readily available and close.
3269390,32756107,2015-05-21,3516367,Mary,"The guest cottage was wonderful!  The cottage was exactly as described, beautifully appointed, very comfortable and sparkling clean.  
It's located in a convenient Queen Anne neighborhood with a private patio and parking.  We loved our visit and hope to return soon."
3269390,33258343,2015-05-26,1113751,Lisa,"This little cottage is exactly as described.  Most of it's kitchen, and it's a nice kitchen.  There's some some really thoughtful touches: lots of hooks in the bathroom!  a nice throw on the sofa!  a bed so comfortable my husband searched for the tag to find out what kind of mattress it was!  Really appreciated the roomy closets which meant the suitcases weren't taking up floor space in the cottage. It's an open plan, which is good for two people.  Turns out that Queen Anne is the perfect neighborhood from which to explore Seattle.  The number 13 bus which is about 5 blocks away takes you right downtown.  Restaurants and markets within a nice little walk.  Pretty neighborhood.  There's also a parking space in the back which is very convenient.  Nicely done, Diane!"
3269390,33576249,2015-05-30,2914881,Amy,"This was my second stay in Diane's cottage and it was just as lovely as the first! Cozy, clean, charming and comfortable, this little home is one of my favorite places to stay. It doesn't hurt that it's a short drive to my favorite Seattle coffee shop either! Will definitely stay here again and again as my job brings me to Seattle often. Thanks so much Diane for a great home away from home!"
3269390,33982019,2015-06-03,661484,Aaron And Jessica,"Perfect location! Off-street parking was a breeze, too. We had an easy walk to Kerry Park, quick access to public transit when we needed it, and always felt so relieved to come back to such a cozy space. The kitchen really is the star of the show. It's a great set up for meal prep and Diane even had delicious coffee on hand for us to brew. Thanks for making our Seattle trip such a delight! "
3269390,34767992,2015-06-12,7499441,Megan,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay here.  Great neighborhood (upper Queen Anne), private parking, private entrance, private patio (with BBQ), and private laundry.  It is a very nice studio apartment.  Diane was very friendly and open.  We like to walk, so we enjoyed the easy walk (downhill) to the Space Needle and Seattle Center.  We highly recommend this cottage (and will be back again)!   P.S.  Our daughter recommended a couple of mobile apps, UBER and LYFT vice using taxis.  It worked out wonderfully for us (getting back up the hill).  The drivers were all nice and friendly, the service was fast, and the cars were clean."
3269390,35069353,2015-06-15,17479697,Jen,"What a fantastic little cottage! The cottage is exactly as pictured. It's really beautiful and has everything you need. The kitchen was stocked and even included things like condiments, spices, sugar & coffee.

Diane was a wonderful host. She contacted me ahead of time and gave me directions. She was also kind enough to store my luggage after I checked out since I had a later flight.

I loved the location of the cottage. Queen Anne is a beautiful and quaint neighbourhood. You are walking distance to multiple grocery stores, restaurants & shops. The area is well serviced by buses to take you downtown Seattle. 

My only negative feedback is around the wifi. The wifi signal was very weak. I assume the router was in the main house because the signal only worked in the bathroom which was closest to the house. Not exactly the most convenient place to use wifi. "
3269390,35377007,2015-06-18,7281153,Elizabeth,"Diane's cottage is in a wonderful neighborhood. It provided a really fun Seattle experience.  We enjoyed the convenience of having a great bakery and good grocery store steps away.  There are also lots of excellent coffee shops within a few blocks. 

The cottage is as shown in the pictures.  It abuts and is accessed from a back alley which provides convenient parking - a big plus in Seattle. "
3269390,36365566,2015-06-28,797196,Dessislava,"This is a really great place to stay in.  It's in a great neighborhood, with lots of little restaurants, bakeries, coffee shops and stores around within walking distance.  The cottage is located in a quiet alley, so it was easy to sleep with the windows open without much noise from the outside.  Everything is exactly as described, very nice furniture and appliances, everything works great.  The bed is so comfortable!  There was a heat wave in Seattle during our visit, and Diane was gracious enough to provide us with an extra fan to cool off.  She even brought us some great cherries from a farmer's market!  They were delicious.  Communication with her was effortless, and the whole stay at the cottage was perfect.  Thank you!!"
3269390,36947834,2015-07-03,11047928,Rosemarie,Diane was an awesome host all around. On arrival we had a bowl of Rainier cherries waiting for us to enjoy. The neighborhood is just fantastic and very centrally located from just about everything. The accommodations are just as they are pictured and was the perfect place to call home for 4 days. 
3269390,37479934,2015-07-07,25590251,Frank,"An absolute delightful, cheerful and self-contained accommodation.  Well equipped and nicely decorated.  Would be hard pressed to have designed it better myself.  Great location in quiet Queen Anne neighborhood.  Terrific walking opportunities to overlooks of the Cascade Mountains and Elliott Bay.  +/- 15 minutes to downtown Seattle by car.  Buses available less than one block away.  If you have a fondness for baked goods, Macrina Bakery is just around the corner and Top Pot Donuts is close by, too.  Mixed feelings about promoting this property too much because it may make it more difficult for us to rebook it in the future.  Diane is a gracious hostess."
3269390,38256712,2015-07-14,14657371,Christine,"Great neighborhood location! This property is in the quiet neighborhood of Queen Anne but only 1/2 mile walk to a strip of restaurants, shops, and grocery; and equally short walks to a variety of bus routes for very easy access to downtown Seattle and surrounding. Accomodations were exactly as photographed, clean, and comfortable. Bed/mattress was super comfortable! While we did not use the kitchen fully, it would be a consideration for others who are interested - there was a good variety of kitchen supplies provided. Our only criticism was that the wi-fi signal was weak (router might be located in the main house?). Would absolutely stay here again & would recommend!"
3269390,39480782,2015-07-24,7493270,Alexandra,Diane provided everything we needed. She was friendly and very accommodating. The cottage is at a great location and we would love to stay there again.
3269390,40205726,2015-07-29,31825867,Tim,"Diane's guest cottage was absolutely perfect experience for me and my wife. The place was immaculately clean and was completely updated. She has stocked the place fully with plates, glasses, coffee maker, and everything else you could think of needing. There is a nice flat screen with DirectTV channels and Wifi. There is a comfy couch and kitchen table setup. The bathroom was completely stocked with towels, soap, shampoo, etc. Having a washer and dryer in-house was amazing.   

 This cottage is located in a perfect location in Queen Anne neighborhood. There are plenty of local shops, restaurants, coffee shops, grocery stores all within short walking distance.  Diane is very easy to communicate with and we would absolutely come back and stay again on our next trip to Seattle."
3269390,40599101,2015-08-01,34790996,Stephanie,We loved staying in Diane's cottage. The neighborhood was nice and quiet. The location had so many nice restaurants close by. It was very convenient to Seattle Center and Pike Place. We were very comfortable here and would definitely recommend it to others!
3269390,41724760,2015-08-09,17455912,Marci,"Diane was warm and inviting.  She gave us some good suggestions and was easy to reach.  Even though there was no air conditioning, Diane provided us with fans which seemed to do the job.  The neighborhood is quiet and several restaurants near by, we loved the 5 Spot on Queen Ann for breakfast and Macrina Bakery was very good too.  A bus line runs near by if you don't mind waiting 20 minutes or so.  Buy an ORCA card and save time and money if you ride the bus or light rail system. UBER was everywhere and easy to use too.  "
3269390,42432802,2015-08-13,4131573,Michael,"Great place in a nice neighborhood. Diane was warm and welcoming, and gave us helpful advice for making the most of our visit."
3269390,43217525,2015-08-18,16928593,Barry,"Diane was very helpful in advance of our trip.  She  gave us all the information we needed and was very helpful in dealing with a local issue unrelated to our stay with her.

The cottage was comfortable and well equipped.   My wife thought the bed was more comfortable than ours at home.  The neighborhood is very nice and safe.  A great grocery is less than 1/2 block away and many nice restaurants are  only a few blocks away.  

Although there is parking you could easily visit most of Seattle without a car from the cottage.  We like walking and generally walked downhill to Ballard, Fremont, or the edge of downtown.  Returning uphill was  a cheap Uber ride.  

We would stay here  again."
3269390,44112027,2015-08-24,7554730,Kristin,The Guest Cottage was in a GREAT location and was very clean. It was exactly as advertised and we were overall really happy with our choice to book here. There are plenty of awesome coffee shops/restaurants/bars within walking distance and the backyard offers a cute spot to enjoy a drink or a morning coffee. I definitely would stay here again! 
3269390,44747480,2015-08-29,24795090,Charles,"Very friendly and helpfull.
Clean, modern and spacious flat.
Nice neighbourhood!
"
3269390,45376977,2015-09-02,19200033,K,"The Cottage is a hidden gem in what is known in Seattle as the most upscale neighborhood in Seattle!  Nestled among Victorian homes, the Cottage was easy to find, generous parking, and beautifully appointed!

The Cottage was immaculate - clean and sparkling - with high-end linens and all the thoughtful touches of ""home"".  A full-size stove/oven, refrigerator, and sink; along with a coffee maker and kitchen ware that a person would need is at your fingertips, neatly stored in her generous kitchen cabinets.  

Diane & John also made sure the bathroom was well stocked with those small touches that makes traveling so much easier!  Spare toothbrushes, toothpaste, shampoo/conditioner, and even laundry supplies if you need to do a quick load of laundry!

50 steps away is a boutique, high-end market, a delicious coffee shop, and a few steps further, an unbelievable bakery, fully stocked with delicious food, breads, sweets, and coffee!  Simply divine!

Although a ""studio"", my fiance and I never felt cramped or uncomfortable! The flat screen with DirecTV was a great touch, as were the furnishings - think Pottery Barn - made staying there such a delight!  I cannot thank Diane enough for an amazing space and we will definitely be back!"
3269390,45942241,2015-09-07,13438120,Abbi,"We loved staying in Diane's cottage. It was relaxing, quiet, comfortable and the amenities were exactly as described. We would definitely stay here again!"
3269390,46480809,2015-09-11,12515553,Wayne,"The stand alone cottage was modern with quality inclusions and fittings, exactly as described.

It was sited in a quiet, very pleasant neighbourhood, in Queen Anne West.

It was well situated with a bus stop within half a block and stores and restaurants within easy walking distance.

Diane was a very friendly and helpful host who afforded us complete privacy."
3269390,46873221,2015-09-14,5370710,Christina Hoa,"Staying at Diane's was a great experience! The cottage was clean and well-stocked with amenities like bath towels, soap, and kitchenware. These sound like ""givens"" but you'd be surprised how many airbnb hosts don't even provide these basics. 

Diane was communicative leading up to and during our stay. Though we never needed additional help from her and thus, never actually met her, we had absolutely no problem getting to the cottage and letting ourselves in because of Diane's clear instructions. 

Additionally, the cottage is located in Queen Anne, a very affluent, safe neighborhood in Seattle.  

One of the best airbnb hosts I've booked with. I highly recommend staying at Diane's cottage if you are in Seattle! "
3269390,47632357,2015-09-21,31551882,Jayn,"Diane's cottage in Queen Anne was great. Exactly as described and close to the bus, market and restaurants. Would definitely stay here again."
3269390,48538295,2015-09-27,41210215,David,"We really loved Diane's guest cottage. It was in a great location, and easy to find. Diane was great to work with even though we didn't get a change to meet. The one question we had she got right back to us about. Being able to able to do a load of laundry was especially nice. The cottage was clean and nicely finished. This was our first Airbnb experience and it couldn't have been better. "
3269390,49763478,2015-10-06,6508475,Elaine,"Diane was a great host! She answered all my questions and concerns quickly. The cottage was perfect for two people and had everything you would need to feel at ""home"". The bed and couch are super comfortable. We loved the Queen Anne area and all the cute little shops around. Overall, an amazing place to stay when in Seattle!"
3269390,51106316,2015-10-18,25681458,Laura,We loved our stay in Diane's airbnb! While we didn't meet Diane she was really helpful and kept in touch via messages. We loved everything about the accommodation beautiful place. We enjoyed being able to shop at kens market and cook rather then spending money eating out every night. Washing machine was great for us mid trip :) the only thing I could t comment was the mattress and pillows a bit hard for us but I have seen many reviews where others loved that so just a personal thing. The bus to the city sigh across the street we used every single day. Queen Anne shops a short walk away - plenty of dinner and breakfast places and we felt really safe walking back at night. Free wifi was great too! 
3269390,51531583,2015-10-21,19013071,Kenyarda,"Great place in an excellent location.  Lots of shops, restaurants, and cafes within walking distance.. (or a short drive down the hill).  Diane was out of town so I didn't meet her but check in was super easy.  The cottage looks exactly like it does in the picture.  I'd definitely stay here again the next time I return to Seattle."
3269390,52233130,2015-10-27,7511850,Clara,"The cottage was the perfect place for my husband and I and our 4 month old baby. Comfortable, clean and has everything you could really need. With a baby, we really appreciated the laundry machines and the full kitchen to have breakfast, take out and other easy stay at home meals- we stayed five days and had lots of meals. Nice to have parking too! Very easy to get around Seattle from this spot (driving) but we walked up to Queen Anne street often for dinner/lunch. We would definitely stay here again and recommend it to all our friends. "
3269390,52695573,2015-11-01,29042686,Ross,"Diane, you have a fantastic place which worked out perfectly for us! So quiet, clean and modern with everything we needed. The location is terrific in Queen Anne, as we could get everything we wanted within a few blocks. Would love to use your place again!"
3269390,54318073,2015-11-18,45685373,Dave,"We were delighted with the accommodations provided by Dianne Bennett. The cottage was perfectly situated in the Queen Anne neighborhood, which made traveling within the Seattle area very easy. Off-street parking was a big plus for us. We were very pleasantly surprised by the condition and decor of the cottage. We had everything we needed. We highly recommend this AirBnB location for anyone visiting Seattle. We had an excellent experience!"
3269390,55096230,2015-11-28,25590251,Frank,"Just like taking our own home with us:  warm, cozy and clean.  The space and appliances are so well laid out.  Better than advertised.  Can't imagine staying anywhere else when in Seattle.  Looking forward to our next visit.  5 stars!"
3269390,55736453,2015-12-05,17533046,Arthur,"The Queen Ann apartment was exactly as described on Airbnb. It was located in a beautiful and quiet neighborhood . The apartment was clean and well-appointed with tasteful, contemporary furnishings. The  kitchen had a modern look, and it was fully equipped and even had a nice array of spices. We loved the location of the apartment because it was pretty close to the heart of the hustle and bustle of Queen Ann and Downtown Seattle. Diane, the owner, was very helpful.  She gave us all of the important information we needed to get into the apartment with ease. She also gave us the location of nearby grocery stores, which was really helpful. There were numerous sight-seeing brochures in the apartment to help us plan excursions. All very much appreciated! We could tell Diane had put a lot of careful thought into making this residence comfortable and welcoming for her guests. If you're looking for a unique way to enjoy Seattle from a vibrant neighborhood, then this is the place for you!"
3269390,56150017,2015-12-09,38246898,Kathy,"I can't say enough wonderful things about our 4day stay in Diane's adorable cottage. Had just spent 3 days downtown at a conference. So the quaint Queen Anne district was a very pleasant change. The cottage looks exactly like the pictures and Diane has thought of every detail. Easy walk to Ken's market which carries a little bit of everything including homemade soups. The bakery across the street has great breakfast, lunch and treats. A little farther walk ( but easy) is Queen Anne ave north with Trader Joes, pubs, boutiques, etc. Such a lovely neighborhood. Many folks that we spoke to on our outings apologized for the weather. It was chili and drizzly, but coming from SoCal, even the weather was a treat. I'd love to return in the spring to do some more exploring. I would absolutely recommend Diane's cottage to anyone looking for a peaceful getaway."
3269390,57623350,2015-12-28,19729331,Rosemary,"I loved Diane's place.  It was comfortable, nicely furnished and the perfect location."
24212,132632,2010-11-02,273313,Biddy,"great apartment, super central, great bakery downstairs, great hot tub and swimming pool, nice shared BBQ patio on the top floor. Recommended"
24212,306595,2011-06-10,177170,Mike,"great place, fantastic location...i highly recommend. "
24212,382558,2011-07-19,534454,Phil,"Beautiful Condo, Great Location, Easy check-in!!! Thanks!"
24212,934868,2012-02-20,1275057,Taryn,"The apartment was pretty much perfect! It had everything we needed, was extremely clean and in an amazing location.  It was 2-4 blocks from some really great restaurants.

Darik and Sally were very nice. The whole booking process was very easy."
24212,954036,2012-02-27,1556128,Carson,"This was a nice place to stay:  bright and clean, centrally located with a pool that was always empty.
"
24212,1161860,2012-04-22,1498737,David,"Had a wonderful experience in this lovely 2 bedroom apartment. The kitchen was surprisingly well stocked with supplies and goodies. The beds were very comfortable, and the decor was really attractive. I would definitely rent from Darik and his wonderful staff again!"
24212,1251327,2012-05-09,1223325,Rebecca,"Darik was awesome! He always answered the phone when I called. He would respond to me e-mails within minutes of sending them. The condo was so clean!! The condo is in ""Like New"" condidtion, staff was polite, showed us all around the place. Did I mention how quiet this place is. The view, oh the view. We walked everywhere. Very easy walking to the Space Needle, and to Pikes Market. The food and coffee shops are everywhere. I do not recomend the pizza place that is right downstairs. But that is not Dariks responsablity. I would HIGHLY recommend this place. Thank you Darik for all your help and sharing your place with us."
24212,1466034,2012-06-12,378773,Susan,"Great place and great service.  A lovely and secure building in a great central location of Seattle.  The manager came down and met us when we arrived, showed us to the parking garage, then helped us take our things up to the apartment and gave us a tour.  She continued to be friendly and helpful the entire stay (but not intrusive).  The Condo itself is great - nice view from the living room, a comfortable sofa bed and comfortable master bed.  The 2nd bedroom had a very hard bed which was pretty uncomfortable.  The kitchen was fully stocked and the bakery just downstairs was a treat in the mornings.  There is a fair amount of street noise, especially on weekend nights, so you might want to bring ear plugs.  We had to shut the windows because of noise, but had an A/C and heater to keep the temperature perfect.

All in all a great place to stay, and we'll be back
"
24212,1498277,2012-06-17,2374937,Lesley,Wonderful place and very helpful owners.  I would highly recommend - virtually was a three bedroom with kitchen and laundry.  I miss it now!  
24212,1544932,2012-06-23,457516,Lyn,This apartment is both beautiful and very convenient.  We loved staying here.
24212,6557089,2013-08-17,6688123,Susan,"This is a wonderful place to stay.  Great location, nice furnishings, comfortable beds, good parking, great amenities.  The bedroom with the wall bed is rather small but the bed is very comfortable.  We just were staying for three nights (my husband and myself in the larger bedroom and my brother in the small room) so we were quite comfortable.   Everyone was great to work with--they went out of their way to give us an early check-in.  I would highly recommend this unit."
24212,6938359,2013-08-31,2383401,Andrew,"We had a great time @ Darik's rental property.  My girlfriend and I stayed with another couple so all told there were 4 of us in the condo.  They've done a great job of staging it and the photos on the site are as advertised, with the grey area that the roof-top BBQ deck is on a separate building across the complex and is a shared space with the regular tenants.  

Pros: Great service experience from the property management team.  Easy in & out, friendly and accommodating with the check in time.  Very responsive to issues during the stay.  Prime location very close to bars, restaurants and the market.  

Cons: 40 gallon electric water heater meant cold showers for a couple people in our 4 person party.  Checkout instructions included washing dishes, towels and sheets - which we found a bit forward considering the hefty cleaning fee."
24212,9879990,2014-01-16,8495230,Art,"Exactly as described.  Great two bedroom place.  Clean, had everything we needed.  Location is excellent, as you can walk to everything in Belltown and then some.  We walked to Century Link Field, Queen Anne Hill, and places in between.  Great restaurants in the area, also.

I would strongly recommend the location.  Darik and team are very professional."
24212,10465904,2014-02-20,11372302,Andrew,"I had a great experience being hosted by Darik and the Seattle Oasis team. Everything was smooth and the place was kept very nicely. I especially appreciated the attention to detail - all sorts of little things were there to make the stay easier, including a fully stocked spice rack to make complex meals with! Thanks, everyone, and hope to see you again."
24212,15568643,2014-07-12,5108758,Emily,"Incredibly helpful staff that manage the property. Welcomed and met me at the front door, to offer a guided tour of the property. Incredibly professional and no confusion what so ever about how to gain access to the space. The views off the public terrace are incredible...the grill up there too makes a trip to Pike's Market a real treasure. We cooked up the fish we bought at the market. A beautiful property, as described in the listing. Would stay again without a second thought."
24212,15680496,2014-07-14,9689796,Nan,"Positives:  The check in experience was easy and the staff very accommodating.  The condo is quite nice, clean and quiet.  The location is excellent.  The beds were comfortable.  The bathroom was clean and spacious and the towels and robes were very nice.  The check out process was also easy.  The hosts provide lots of information - both electronically and written - about the condo, how to operate things and the surrounding area.

Negatives:  The condo is quite small.  It says that it will accommodate 6 but that is with everyone stuffed in like sardines.  The one bedroom has a murphy bed and when the bed is down nothing else really fits in the room.  The other bedroom is roomy however.  The other negative is that there is a very large and loud air-conditioning unit on the floor right by the table.  Not sure why there is no central air.  The air-conditioning unit makes this a 4 star versus a 5 star overall experience."
24212,18229509,2014-08-24,13007791,Nick,"This place was terrific. It is located in a perfect spot within walking distance to all the major sites. The apartment was very nice and of course had an amazing view of the water. When we come back to Seattle, we will surely see if this place is available. "
24212,20143089,2014-09-24,13393115,Nigel,Were made very welcome. Location was great. Very central to everything.
24212,21064059,2014-10-10,16073380,Alison,"We had a nice stay. As previously mentioned, it's not a typical air bnb stay -- run by rental company and formal. I received multiple emails prior to our stay which was slightly annoying and confusing, but overall the communication with host was good. Condo location was perfect -- I was attending conference at the convention center and enjoyed my walks to and from. Many things to do nearby. My 6 month old baby, husband, and parents stayed. There was plenty of room. We awoke sweating from main bedroom first night... Learned needed to keep door open for air of window open, with fan on to drown out city noise (baby). Shower nice. We didn't have time to use any building amenities but pool looked ok. Would recommend staying here, price and parking were great for location. "
24212,21874266,2014-10-26,11214811,Cindy,The condo was perfect. Super comfortable and all with a great view. Highly recommend the condo
24212,26935037,2015-02-22,14928946,Vicki,The condo was located in a great area!  Seattle Oasis Vacation Rentals was very helpful and easy to work with.  Couldn't have asked for better customer service!
24212,30132554,2015-04-18,28182918,Keith,"Great place and matched description perfectly.  Clean, well equipped with all the necessities and a great location.  Service was great, as we were greeted and given a tour of the facilities and answer any questions we had.  We stayed for a week and I would stay there again in a heartbeat. "
24212,32050318,2015-05-13,27624705,Yuhan,Nice unit. Close to pike place market. I would recommend to my friends in the future. 
24212,33233291,2015-05-26,28397275,Feifei,房东在公寓门口等待我们，非常热情的给我们指引停车的位置。房子很舒适，比较适合4人同行。房子位置比较接近中心城区。但是晚上睡觉会有些噪音，因为紧挨马路，所以过往车辆的声音会比较明显。
24212,45065590,2015-08-31,3413907,Joseph,"This was one of two apartments run by Seattle Oasis Vacations (“SOV”) that I reserved back in early May to cover nine people coming into town for the Penny Arcade Expo at the Seattle convention center, August 27-31st.  Unfortunately, a week before we had to leave I was informed the apartment I was going to be staying in was no longer available due to bed bugs.  As such, this review is a compilation of what my five friends (two couples, one single) had to say about the apartment they stayed in.

There were no problems with communication before the rental, though it was handled primarily by various SOV representatives rather than Darik himself.  The company has their own app you can download on your phone which links to their website which was chock full of useful information regarding the rental as well as visiting Seattle in general.  
  
My friends had great things to say about Bruce, the guy who let them in and gave them a tour of the space.  He covered everything my friends needed to know.

In regards to the actual space, my friends enjoyed the experience and thought it was a very pretty apartment though they concluded that with five people it was a little too cramped for comfort.  The two couples slept on a normal bed and a murphy bed, respectively, and the single slept on a fold-out couch, leaving little room for maneuvering around the apartment.  Specifically, the room with the murphy bed only had about a foot of clearance between the bed and the other three walls.  

Initially there weren’t sheets available for the fold-out but they were able to have sheets brought up in a timely manner.  There was also a pair of underwear found in one of the closets that apparently hadn’t been caught by the cleaning crew. 
     
The location was very good, with a brisk walk down to Pike Street Market or up to the convention center.  As often as not Uber was used to get around which was painless and fairly cheap (~$6).  There was a wonderful bakery just outside the building that I was told they visited on a daily basis for breakfast.

I think if you’ve looking to have 2-4 people this would be a good choice for your stay in Seattle."
24212,48501288,2015-09-27,14945679,Emily,"We felt very welcomed (there was even a welcome basket) when we checked into the apartment. The apartment was clean and well maintained. The building was safe and it is in a very central area of the city. If was the perfect apartment for four people (two couples). There is even an amazing deck upstairs with beautiful views of the sound. 

The only downside was the noise at night (lots of bars and clubs in the area) and construction starting at 7am on Saturday (there is a condo being built next door). "
24212,50926408,2015-10-16,2218935,Adam,"Everything went great. We were met at the street, led into the carpark and guided through the apartment. 

A few minor things needed looking after (shower leaked a bit, fan wouldn't turn off, etc) and were *very* promptly addressed.

Couldn't be happier with the apartment or the customer experience!  "
24212,53842838,2015-11-13,4184014,Laurent,"Check in was easy. 
The apartment's location is OK but it is not a very lively neighborhood. Not a great view on the bay (picture a bit misleading).
Now, this a apartment is managed by a rental facility. This is not a home, but an apartment for short stays. It is quite impersonal. There are A LOTS of rules, and documents to sign. And people who manage don't care about you. They just want you to follow the dozens of rules they have set up. 
So, among all my airbnb experiences this one was really not a great one.  "
24212,56095946,2015-12-08,47840351,Doc,The place looked amazing.  Great views of the city and water.  This location is perfect because of all the restaurants and attractions within walking distance.  Loved having secured access to the building and parking below.  I just wish we had more time to take advantage of all of the amenities.  LOVED IT!!
7692789,42968188,2015-08-16,22695407,Calli,"Rob was extremely accommodating and friendly! His condo is located in one of my favorite parts of Seattle and is a quick uber ride away to anywhere else you'd want to go. The room and bathroom he provided were spotless. His balcony has a great view and he even bought us milk, muffins, etc. He definitely puts a lot of thought into the comfort of his guests.  I would absolutely stay with him again!"
7692789,43711426,2015-08-21,41009911,Bruce,"Rob is a great host. He made my stay in Seattle comfortable and enjoyable. I was not good prepared before visiting this city, but with Rob's help I could quickly figure out places to visit, food to taste, and things to try. Also, Rob has a beautiful and big condo. Both the view and location are just good for me. "
7692789,44074397,2015-08-23,1400339,Mia,The neighborhood was great. Fabulous location for a weekend away to Seattle. Wonderful parks and views. Eateries and shopping close by. The bus is right there for a quick way to get around if you don't want to drive into Seattle downtown.  Rob was a wonderful host and his coffee and muffins for the morning were a sweet touch. I loved his loft and style. My husband and I had a wonderful and comfortable time. The bed was cozy and  the room had a nice vibe. 
7692789,44621703,2015-08-27,27085121,Giorgia,"Our journey in Rob's house was completely PERFECT. He was so kind and he provided for everything to be perfect, we felt at home! I really recommend Rob's home ! Also the neighbor is great! "
7692789,45161620,2015-08-31,15402364,Janel,"We loved our stay with Rob! The place was easy to find, right on the bus line to downtown Seattle, and absolutely BEAUTIFUL! The views were outstanding and we were lucky to see Lake Washington on a windy day. The condo itself is gorgeous, very comfortable. The art pieces in the condo are amazing! It's very nice that we were able to have our own bathroom. Rob is SO friendly and accommodating, he was able to work around our later check in and out, along with us leaving early and coming back late each day. We felt very comfortable here, and we would definitely stay again!! Thanks Rob!"
7692789,46191667,2015-09-08,9820560,Chetan,The place and our stay was royal. Everything was great and we didnt feel any inconvenience. I had forgot to bring a few things but Rob's house was well equipped. Rob was very nice and professional and communicated every details about the house. He even provided snack items for us. I'd definitely choose the same place in the future.
7692789,48213838,2015-09-24,43426287,Sarp,"The listing and photos are 100% accurate, you can be fully confident that you are going to get the room you expect. The bed is really comfortable, there is lots of space to put clothes, a clean and well decorated bath with steam hot water available. Rob was also extremely helpful on my 11 days I spent in his home. Not only that, people that live in the apartment are also extremely friendly. I would totally recommend this place to anyone planning their stay in Seattle."
461567,1832473,2012-07-29,3013526,Stephen,Donna Linn was a wonderful host. Very nice place with nice views in a quiet neighborhood.  Loved it.
461567,2023608,2012-08-18,1165639,Jennifer,"I spent two night's during a very unusual Seattle heatwave.  Donna went out of her way to make sure the upstairs apartment was cooled down, (fan, air conditioning, blinds).  The room(s) were very comfortable, clean and spacious.  Kitchen area was adequate (we weren't there to do alot of cooking anyway).  Coffee, tea and snacks were provided.  The bathroom and shower were particularly nice.  The only drawback was that there was not a private entrance.  Donna was a pleasant, accomodating hostess.  Will definitely come again.  "
461567,2075061,2012-08-23,3031989,William,"Airbnb:

I am pleased to offer a review of Donna Linn's facilities and services.

Facilities: Practically new, if not new. Spacious, airy, great bathroom and shower features. Well equipped. Clean. With view of mountain range, clouds permitting. Outside deck through door wall. More than adequate parking space in front of home. A major bus route to downtown one block away (another a short four or five blocks away to Fremont/downtown). A large nursery, similar distance, with beautiful plant displays and excellent garden cafe.

Services: Arrived very, and rudely late. Donna was up, greeted me and had laid out food for a tidy breakfast in the AM or late night snack. Gracious and most wanting to make my Seattle stay a success. I highly recommend a stay here. On return visits I plan to stay again.

Bill"
461567,2094316,2012-08-25,534535,Stephan,"We only spent one night at Donna's beautiful place, but from what we could tell it would be very suitable for a longer stay in Seattle. It is very spatious and well equipped and in a charming neighborhood. On a clear day, you can even see the beautiful Olympic mountains from the bedroom windows. The fact that you share the entrance to her house did not seem an issue at all.
Unfortunately, the communication with Donna on the day of our arrival was not as smooth as could have been, but presumably this was a one-time exception as she seems to be a reliable and kind person. And the compensation she offered was more than fair.
All in all, we can recommend this place, just make sure to get in touch early enough to avoid misunderstandings."
461567,2099555,2012-08-26,2609477,Amanda,"Lovely, albeit short stay. Never got to meet Donna, but her place was nice and on a quiet street. It was even close enough for a long walk to Delancy for some incredible pizza. Recommended! "
461567,2175808,2012-09-02,2971867,Jean,The reservation was canceled the day before arrival. This is an automated posting.
461567,2468669,2012-10-01,2176204,Michael,"My boys and I had a great time. The house is modern, clean, quiet, and filled with natural light. We enjoyed watching the full moon from  the private deck and watching the sunset from  the dining table while eating dinner. Donna went out of her way to make us feel at home. She borrowed children's  books from the local library for the boys. She laid out stuffed animals for my youngest. And she supplied us with breakfast treats in the fridge. I enjoyed swapping stories with her over coffee. What an enjoyable care free weekend in Ballard."
461567,2596889,2012-10-13,3599067,Mary,"Charm was a great find.  It was clean, comfortable, spacious, quiet, in a good location and there was a great view (if the clouds went away).  
Mary is very pleasant and makes one feel right at home.  I hope to return and get to know her and her lovely kitty again in the future."
