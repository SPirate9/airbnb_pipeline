699460,5023940,2013-06-08,6358233,Deni,"This is a quaint cottage/artist studio in the very attractive leafy suburb of Ballard.  Nice bright airy bedroom upstairs with lovely clean bathroom downstairs.  There is also a nice garden in which to sit and good parking space in lane way behind.  We found public transport close by and easy to use.  Gave us a break away from driving in the congested Seattle traffic!
Patti and Benson were really helpful with places to see and answered our many (sorry) questions!  We enjoyed chatting to them and felt that they indeed respected our privacy.
We have unfortunately had a couple of unpleasant Airbnb experiences but we would be happy to stay in their accommodation again.  Thanks gang!"
699460,5087634,2013-06-11,559532,Katrina,"My husband and I had such a wonderful time at Patti and Benson's Ballard bnb. The house is beautiful, relaxing, neat, and in a perfect location to enjoy one of the best neighborhoods in Seattle. Patti was a fantastic host. She made us feel right at home, recommended great local restaurants and coffee shops, and we even got to see her artwork in a nearby shop. We will definitely stay here again the next time we're in Seattle. "
699460,5334757,2013-06-24,6958431,Elizabeth,"Patti's studio was amazing and in the middle of great restaurants and not
Far from the locks. I really recommend staying there!"
699460,5547975,2013-07-05,1397707,Jing,"This place is crisp clean and elegantly comfortable! 
I was delighted by the smell from the sheets and pillow every night. 
Sitting in the garden, enjoying a cup of tea while the mint and lemon grass in the breeze still blow green...I will always have a smile on my face when I look back:)
Patti and Benson made my stay in Seattle such a pleasant experience! Thank you!"
699460,5664428,2013-07-10,7020534,Anselmo,"This couldn't be a better location for us to visit Seattle.
The studio is located in a charming and comfortable house with a beautiful artistic touch and a lot of privacy for its guests. The neighborhood is lovely and has great shops, restaurants and activities and it is also very well connected with downtown through public transportation.  Patti and Benson are very nice and kind people.
I can't imagine a better deal than this."
699460,5812446,2013-07-17,7026628,Allison,"My family and I had a wonderful stay at Patti & Benson's bnb! We are happy we could stay in such a beautiful, clean, spacious, and welcoming place.  Patti was such a friendly and helpful host.  It was also an excellent location - close to downtown Ballard, but yet on a quiet street.  We hope to stay there again on future visits to Seattle! "
699460,5892705,2013-07-21,7140479,Patty,We had a great stay at Patti and Benson's and I would highly recommend staying here! Patti was very accommodating and the house was impeccably clean and inviting. It is located in a quiet neighborhood but there are plenty of dining options within walking distance.  If I ever find myself in Seattle again I would stay here in a heartbeat!
699460,5946994,2013-07-23,5502120,Valentine & Quentin,"Great Location to visit Seattle. We ended up staying a lot in Ballard and only went to downtown Seattle once. 
The house is spacious, comfortable and very clean. 
Patti was very flexible with the arrival time and check out. The house is decorated with Patti's artwork and she is very talented.
There is a little parking area in the back of the house where we left the car for 2 days while we went around by foot or bus. 
Great place to stay. "
699460,6027953,2013-07-27,7107768,Steve,"We had a magnificent three days at Patti and Benson's. We couldn't have asked for a more charming place to stay in lovely Ballard. The house was perfectly maintained and beautifully decorated, and our hosts were friendly and accommodating but also gave us a good deal of privacy. I'd highly recommend this place to anyone visiting the Seattle area. My girlfriend and I cannot stop discussing a potential move to this magical city someday!"
699460,6180204,2013-08-02,7432732,Chris,"Patti is a conscientious and responsive host.  She provided spot-on tips for dining and activities in the Ballard area.  The house is immaculate, peaceful and full of unique character.  The off-street parking in a huge plus as street parking is limited in the neighborhood.  The location is excellent- easy walking distance to most Ballard points of interest.  Ballard is an awesome area- so much going and with quick access to downtown Seattle.  This was our first airbnb experience and a fantastic introduction to an outstanding service."
699460,6302247,2013-08-07,6859065,Craig,"It was a pleasure to meet Patti, see her art work, and enjoy her historical home. I would definitely recommend staying at her place, and enjoy the Ballard area of Seattle. Patti makes you feel right at home."
699460,6354103,2013-08-09,1505272,April Joy,"Patti and Benson's were so quick to respond to questions which helped ease my fears since this was our first Airbnb experience.

They were so accommodating to our schedule and didn't mind the fact that we were coming in a little later in the evening after the Mariners game.  Patti was at the place to greet us, show us around, and explain everything to us.  As late as it was, she even stayed to give us suggestions on places to check out while we were visiting.

The home itself was great!  We had the place to ourselves during the evenings which was when we were there anyway.  It was clean, spacious, and very close to a everything in Ballard!

It's definitely a place I would consider going to again!

Thanks Patti and Benson!"
699460,6419725,2013-08-12,4174182,Wayne,"The Shaw's house in Ballard is clean, quiet, and comfortable.  We enjoyed our stay here and would stay again.  It is close to many restaurants, stores.  You must be able to climb stairs - the bedroom(s) is one story up.  It is very nice to have available the large kitchen and also the table space and shelf room in the bedroom.  There is wifi.  And I found the drive to the U district and downtown to be not too arduous.  Patti's art work makes the place particularly special.   "
699460,6651517,2013-08-20,8382607,Fiona,This was my first airbnb experience and I'm a convert.  Patti was an exceptionally good communicator and this was very much appreciated when we ran in to troubles at the beginning of our trip. The house was a delight with Patti's beautiful artwork throughout. Ballard is a really pretty suburb and I'm so glad we stayed there and not downtown. We were without a car but found no problem at all with the great bus system.
699460,6784333,2013-08-25,7379765,Michael,"Patti and Benson were perfect hosts!  The house is beautiful, super clean, comfortable, and full of art.   It is located in a great neighborhood that has many restaurants, cafes, and bars within easy walking distance.  We felt absolutely safe walking home at night.  The bus to Fremont/downtown is a block away, which made getting around the city easy.   
We felt comfortable, relaxed, and welcome during our time in the house.  I wouldn't even considered staying anywhere else on my next visit to Seattle! 
"
699460,6931563,2013-08-31,5975222,Elspeth,"Patti and Benson were wonderful and their place was so charming, clean and welcoming. Not only is it a lovely place to stay, but it is in a great location - quiet house but just blocks from everything you might need! "
699460,7088767,2013-09-06,8401852,Mitch,"So nice to stay at the Shaw's BNB/Artist studio. Beautiful, clean house. Friendly and inviting hosts. Wonderful neighborhood to explore if you have time. I would stay here again next time i plan a trip to Seattle. I highly recommend staying at this BnB. Would be great a place for a small group (2-4) to stay."
699460,7105917,2013-09-06,3836613,Serina,"Amazing location, space, character, artwork and hosts! We had such a great time staying here. Thank you Patti!"
699460,7229938,2013-09-11,6281730,Debbie,"Staying at Patti & Benson's place could not have been a better experience! We were fortunate to stay there before and after a very hectic wedding. Their place provided the peace and serenity we needed to balance to the intensity of all that went on during the week. Patti was very accommodating to our ever changing schedule.  We enjoyed visiting with her as we settled in. The location was beyond convenient; the outdoor spaces, the off street parking, the location to downtown Ballard and the one block walk to The Java Bean for a true Seattle Coffee experience; the old world charm of the house, combined with Patti's art and charming, clever and humorous touches were a delight. Everything was clean, comfortable and serene. We appreciated the maps of the area, and the book on Ballard history. We would definitely return and have already recommended their place to others."
699460,7326786,2013-09-16,2819513,Diane,"Patti was a very agreeable host.  She was friendly , considerate,   helpful and always willing to answer questions.  Her art work was lovely, and it added to the ambiance of the accommodations.  We only met Benson once, but he was very friendly as well.  The B & B had a nice bedroom, bathroom and kitchen, and most of the time we were there, we were by ourselves since Patti used her studio space during the day while we were gone.

Our main negative about this stay was in relation to the location of the B and B.  We hadn't realized ahead of time how far away Ballard was from the downtown area.  Since we didn't have a car, we had to rely on buses which were relatively slow, even though frequent.  So, this would not be a good location for people without a car who wanted to explore the city.  Most of the time, after a long day of sight seeing, we didn't feel like another hour bus trip to another neighborhood, so this location limited our evening activities.  But none of this would be a problem if you're traveling with a car.

The other caution about this accommodation is that the bathroom is down a steep flight of stairs from the bedroom.  This was clearly mentioned in the description of the property, but it is something to think about if you're elderly or have trouble with stairs."
699460,7483415,2013-09-22,7912573,Caren,We had a wonderful experience renting from Patti & Benson.  They were very accommodating for our late arrival. The home was very clean and welcoming.  We even received homemade cookies.  Coming from the East Coast the neighborhood was convenient for moving out daughter into Seattle University  and visiting our son 2 blocks away. Off street parking was a plus. We will definitely stay here on future trips. 
699460,7558094,2013-09-24,8392941,Stephane,"Patti was a gracious host. The home was super cute, clean and nestled in a lovely neighborhood. I appreciate that we had parking available in the back and had an entire house to ourselves. I would definitely stay here again :)"
699460,7651747,2013-09-28,8696162,Nancy,"We spent several days in Seattle and loved staying in Patti's house/studio. It was clean and provided a welcome retreat at the end of our busy vacation days out and about in the city. Patty was friendly, welcoming, and helpful. We definitely recommend staying here!"
699460,7739808,2013-10-01,7101003,Wei Neng,"Patti and Benson have a tasteful and lovingly restored gem of a house in the heart of Ballard, a pretty and eclectic neighbourhood with lots of interesting shops, restaurants, cafes, bookstores, plus a regular farmer’s market. 

Patti crafts beautiful artwork from a variety of materials and uses the living room as a studio, but she was super considerate regarding our privacy, and we practically had the entire house to ourselves during our stay. She generously offered us the use of the well-equipped and spotless kitchen, washing machine and small sitting room, in addition to the spacious and comfortable bedroom and great bathroom/shower upstairs. She also took pains to give us maps and helpful advice on the best things to see, do and eat in Ballard. 

We had a fantastic Italian-inspired dinner at Volterra, visited the Ballard Locks and salmon ladder, bought fresh milk, pizza slices and cheese at the Ballard farmers’ market, poked around the independent bookstores, and even spent a quiet afternoon reading in the well-stocked Ballard library just minutes from Patti’s house. There is a large supermarket (QFC) for groceries, personal conveniences and deli meals. There’s really nothing not to like about this. Thanks very much Patti!
"
699460,7990904,2013-10-11,9197642,Wendy,"Stayed here with my adult daughter and had a wonderful time. The neighborhood is great, everything is within walking distance. Patti was a lovely host and we really enjoyed chatting with her about everything from art to the history of the Ballard neighborhood. Thanks for a great stay! "
699460,8144730,2013-10-17,5548832,Christie,Patti and her husband were great hosts. The house is immaculate -so clean and nicely appointed.  Great location.  Quiet and cozy.   It's actually a very nice sized home and so fairly priced! Thanks again! 
699460,8183473,2013-10-19,3154852,Hanna,"Patti's studio was a great way to be in an urban neighborhood and feel at home, but without all the work! The house was extremely clean, filled with light and art and was not cluttered in any way. There is everything you need, and nothing you don't need. The location is perfect for walking to restaurants, bars, the Ballard Locks, and I definitely recommend checking out the Ballard Athletic Club which is only three blocks away and had $8 drop in yoga classes. We would definitely stay here again. It was a great Airbnb experience. Thank you Patti for being such a great host!"
699460,8209809,2013-10-21,5316589,Sophie,"If you're looking for a charming place to stay with lots of character and within walking distance to restaurants, cafes, yummy bakeries, pubs, etc....then look no further.  Patti and Benson have a minimally decorated, clean studio with all the necessary amenities for a comfortable stay.  Patti was a lovely host and I look forward to staying here on my future visits to Seattle/Ballard.
Thank-you Patti and Benson"
699460,8363399,2013-10-28,5409887,Elizabeth,"What a great place! We loved Patti and Benson's Artist Studio Cottage! So unique and interesting and close to where we wanted to be!! (I love older homes)

Patti was very hospitable and welcoming and we enjoyed viewing her art around the house. 

The kitchen was perfect (we like to be able to cook for ourselves) and we were so comfortable. 

Thank you for a great stay!!"
699460,8697062,2013-11-12,9320891,Jason,"My partner and I had a great great time staying at Patties and Benson AirBnB.
Their was parking in back of the house for my truck, the house was super clean and very quiet. The bed was perfect as was the fluffy towels and nice water pressure in the bathroom.
QFC and downtown Ballard were with easy walking distance.  
They was many restaurants, shops, cafés, and a large theater. We went to a late night movie and walked back to the house and felt safe. The house is a easy drive to down town, the university district, and Queen Anne. Parking is free on Sundays in Seattle so we parked at the Seattle center, walked to Down town and did all the tourist things. We took the tunnel back from Chinatown and the Monorail from West lake center. We both decided that next time we will stay at Patties and Bensons and hangout in Ballard. We both had a great time and got the rest and relaxation we both needed. We would stay there again.
"
699460,8977431,2013-11-30,8428035,Sally,Great Bed and Breakfast.  Very quiet and comfortable bedroom.  Centrally located.  Would stay there again
699460,9074825,2013-12-04,10182083,Maile,"A friend and I were visiting Seattle and wanted to stay in a neighborhood outside the downtown but one still accessible to the downtown area and to other Seattle neighborhoods.  This was our first experience on airbnb and staying in Patti and Benson's studio in Ballard was a great experience.  Patti and Benson are incredibly thoughtful hosts and the studio was clean, cozy, and decorated with nice art -- including some by Patti herself.  Patti met us when we arrived rather late from the airport, gave us a tour of the studio and its surrounds, and also directed us to a nearby French bakery serving some of the best croissants we'd ever had.  Unfortunately our time in the area was limited and mostly booked, so we weren't able to spend much time enjoying the studio or Ballard's unique offerings except in the evenings and early mornings.  But it was still a wonderful experience and I would recommend the Shaws' studio wholeheartedly."
699460,9200319,2013-12-13,8831571,Ellen,"Patti and Benson are great hosts and their Ballard accommodation is uniquely creative and comfortable, We thoroughly enjoyed our stay! "
699460,9244517,2013-12-16,9874420,Mary,"Patti met us warmly when we arrived and showed us the rooms, which were spacious. Her Ballard Artist's Studio is comfortable and warm, very neat and clean, and sprinkled with her art, which my children and I enjoyed looking at and talking about together. The beds were comfortable and the house stayed warm through the night, despite the Seattle chill outside. If we had needed anything, I knew Patti was nearby and accessible by phone. The studio's location suited us perfectly; it's a few blocks from our favorite bagel source, as well as the Ballard Branch Library and Market Street. We would gladly choose to stay here again!
"
699460,9309227,2013-12-20,10372235,Kayo,The home is clean and beautifully decorated with a personal touch that permeates it very being.  Patti is a wonderful presence; we enjoyed our conversations and her art.   With the added benefit of easy access to public transportation we thoroughly enjoyed our stay and all that Seattle has to offer.  I would highly recommend this accommodation to anyone who might be interested in a visit to Seattle.
699460,9375379,2013-12-24,10611506,Natanella,"Staying with Patty and Benson was awsome. Their house is a beatifull mixture of eclectic and eterial . Patty's art pieces thogether with little tresures each with its unique story - draw you to linger and think about people who made them . 
The accomodation was impecable and location in the heart of Bollard made everything very close - miryad of galleries, cafes , restaurants small eclectic stores , parks all connected by cobble stone streets - take you to a magical place. 
Patty and Benson are very sweet friendly artsy couple who's quiet spirit made us feel very welcome to their beatiful home . Will come back again!"
699460,9416883,2013-12-27,2394206,Patricia,"My son and I spent Christmas at Patti and Benson's lovely house in Ballard.  We had a great time and with a very comfortable and cozy
kitchen we created a great Christmas dinner.  The house is very clean and fun.  It has a light and airy feeling with all the comforts you would want, the bathroom is great and visitor friendly.  As artists they have added unique touches that make it more 
personal and eclectic.  I would highly recommend it for anyone. 
And location is perfect!"
699460,9497625,2013-12-31,10190613,Paul,"This is a great place to stay. The large bedroom upstairs looks out on the street and is very bright and comfortable. The bathroom is downstairs and has a good tub/shower. The hosts are welcoming and only around during the day. You can walk to the grocery, library, bookstores, coffee houses, excellent restaurants (including Ballard Annex Oyster House at 5410 Ballard Ave NW), and to the working waterfront. Ballard is a great neighborhood and convenient to downtown via the #40 bus. I recommend this property without reservation."
699460,9585199,2014-01-03,8962680,Lanita,We found Patti and Benson's place to be charmingly comfortable and well appointed. Patti was friendly and helpful. The Ballard location can't be beat for a Seattle visit.
699460,9706109,2014-01-06,9762041,Laura,"We enjoyed the clean, ample space.  It was so nice to be able to make a cup of tea or coffee in our kitchen, sit at the table to visit, sit on the couch in the sitting room to read and sleep on very comfortable beds.  Patti met us upon arrival and was very kind and accommodating."
699460,10217069,2014-02-07,10859029,William,"Superb value.  Have been staying at Patti's studio the past month and it has been great; she looks after things very well.  The studio is just my sort of place:  a lovely older house well looked after and in close proximity to all the action in Ballard.  You can walk to the movies, the pubs, the cafes, the restaurants and the groceries.  Old Ballard is only 10 minutes away by foot through a very tidy neighborhood.  I am looking forward to my next month at the studio. "
699460,10257563,2014-02-10,5409887,Elizabeth,"We had our second stay at Patti and Benson's place. The nicest hosts and place. The location and setting are perfect for our twice annual event. What a joy to know that we can stay there and have such beautiful hospitality and convenience. 

Thanks again for the fabulous stay!!!!

Elizabeth and Jim"
699460,11015730,2014-03-17,12371020,Nell,"Patti & Benson have a lovely home. It is clean, nicely decorated, and they provided even more amenities than we needed. Ballard is a really nice neighborhood with interesting shops and good restaurants. Patti & Benson were very nice about us being there with our toddler. There was a lot she could get into, but they trusted that we could prevent her from causing any major or minor catastrophes, which I greatly appreciated. I would recommend staying here. It's a great spot for the price! "
699460,11417019,2014-04-01,13356235,Liz,"Patti's studio is a lovely house, perfectly positioned in the heart of Ballard.  The house we clean and well equipped.  Patti was flexible in meeting is late when our flight got delayed and we were able to stay an extra night as well.  The location is ideal for walking to breweries, morning bakeries, and just down the street from the bus line going downtown.  The only downside was a weak internet signal, but we found we'd rather be out and about, not surfing the web at home, so it wasn't really a problem.  Patti was really nice, but we only saw her at check in.  Otherwise, it was like we had the house to ourselves.  
We would definitely stay here again!"
699460,11490196,2014-04-05,8756447,Marielle,"The pictures simply don't do it justice! My boyfriend and I stayed for a few nights in April and have a wonderful time. The place was charming, unique and absolutely why we love travelling with AirBnB. Patti was a gracious host, the space was large, clean and felt like a home away from home. The location was great, walking distance from a grocery store, a great coffee shop and the Ballard main strip, not to mention easy to commute downtown. We couldn't have been happier with our stay or recommend this more!  "
699460,11624839,2014-04-09,6224742,Jane,"We had a great stay in this house that is charming and clean as a whistle.  Patti is a most welcoming hostess, and we found the accommodations attractive and comfortable.  Would not be the best for someone who has trouble with stairs so be sure to take note if stairs would be an issue.  This is a great location and we loved having off street parking. We hope to return.  Thanks, Patti!"
699460,12369259,2014-04-30,12507083,Anna,"I booked Patti and Benson's house for my parents and their friends who were visiting town. They absolutely loved it. The house itself is just a few blocks from central Ballard, which is one of my favorite neighborhoods in Seattle. Patti has a studio in the house but is not intrusive at all, and my parents were exited to meet a local. All in all, I would definitely recommend this place! "
699460,12547844,2014-05-05,3592638,Kari,"The property was beautiful, comfortable and very clean. Patti was very nice and helpful and provided information about the house and the area to help us enjoy our stay.  Would absolutely recommend this property and host.  Loved this area of Seattle."
699460,12761818,2014-05-10,3177474,Chuck,"Patti & Benson were wonderful hosts.  Charming place just blocks from Ballard's best places, very clean, great communication.  Would recommend a stay to anyone visiting Seattle for a few days/weeks."
699460,13249029,2014-05-23,13624488,Alexander+Agnieszka,"Our last stay on our 3-week trip of the westcoast was one of the highlights of our still brief experience with AirBnb. Patti made us feel at home from the beginning. The house is super clean and lovely decorated. We wanted to stay longer to enjoy the beautiful garden, house and above all Pattis company. The Ballard district is flourishing and offers many great places to eat and relax. "
699460,13577910,2014-05-31,4074748,Thomas,"Patti and Benson were very accommodating and run a clean, comfortable and roomy Airbnb.  If you like a quaint and unique urban setting the Ballard / Fremont area is the place.  This Airbnb is located conveniently to these Seattle neighborhoods. 

We will definitely return."
699460,13788465,2014-06-04,3608716,Martha,Second stay at Patti's place and it was as nice and convenient as it was last year.   Patti is very responsive to email and communicates promptly.  She is a great hostess.  We will definitely use Patti's place again whenever we have guests in Ballard. 
699460,13850173,2014-06-06,16148208,Bill,"We had an enjoyable stay at Patti and Benson's airbnb.  It was immaculately clean and the Ballard location was perfect.  There was plenty of space inside and a picnic table on the lawn outdoors.  The bed was very comfortable.  The narrow, winding staircase between the upstairs bedroom and downstairs bathroom could pose a problem for people with balance or mobility problems, but there's an excellent bannister and we were fine with the situation.  Patti was very friendly and helpful."
699460,15177583,2014-07-04,958258,Kirralee,"We loved staying at Patti and Bensons beautiful Ballard Artist Studio. The house is in an amazing location - very close to cafes, supermarkets and everything you need including a bus to downtown. The house was very clean, the bed was super comfortable and there was so much space. Patti and Benson are kind, friendly and understand how to be the ""perfect air bnb hosts."" We highly recommend staying here on your travels to Seattle!"
699460,15386429,2014-07-08,8401852,Mitch,Another great stay at the Ballard Artist's Studio. Patti and Benson are very kind and accommodating hosts. I love walking down to the Ballard neighborhood shops and restaurants. Thanks again! 
699460,15626578,2014-07-13,9995855,Karl,"We were very pleased with our stay. Patti and Benson were wonderful hosts, very welcoming. The house is clean and very well situated in Ballard. Would defently recommend staying in Ballard when visiting Seattle, great neighbourhood. 
The stay was everything we expected and good value for money. 
Only thing that was negative  was the fact that the whole living room was occupied (the one in all the pictures) so there were few places to relax in the house. "
699460,16292323,2014-07-25,6857099,Kelsey,"Patti and Benson were excellent hosts, their space was clean, and not to mention huge. It was really neat getting to share the space with Patti during the week, her artwork is super incredible, and she is very sweet. I was using their space during an apartment search, and it was very easy for me to work in the space as well as cook. The studio is also super close to downtown Ballard, so you can walk to all sorts of bars and restaurants."
699460,16470490,2014-07-28,16382450,Paula,a lovely home on a quiet street but walkable to lots of restaurants.  very thoughtful hosts.  would welcome the chance to stay again.
699460,17562917,2014-08-14,1608058,Erin,"The most beautiful house/ art studio  truly !
We could not get over how amazing this place was 
Gracious comfortable 100 year old house very artistically 
Appointed every detail is lovely as can be 

Comfy light filled bedroom beautiful sitting areas 
Patty's art is just beautiful I certainly wanted to buy the piece hanging on the wall
 tasteful art work and ephemera throughout thr house 
I could move in tomorrow without blinking 

Close to lovely ballard shops restaurants and 
Amazing bakery around the corner 

Hit a snag trying to cancel our reserve as our timing on our 
Trip had changed and I missed the cancel date by one half day 
So if five day cancel be aware of the window ! I was unclear 

We had hoped for a refund  if patty could rent it out easily 
But  patty did not want to do that at all

So we pAid for three nights and stayed one ! 
big ouch ! We would have been happy with a credit as well for future use 

As we are frequent air b nb users it was a costly mistake 
That We c ertainly won't make again that's for sure !!

Lovely place to stay great locale and price  and patty welcomed us with 
Some great chocolate as well

699460,17829405,2014-08-18,16349825,C.L,"Patti was there to meet us upon arrival and gave us a quick tour of the place--mentioned where to get groceries, explained any house tidbits--in a nutshell, set us up nicely.
great place to stay to explore Ballard in a quiet neighborhood. charming and relaxing."
699460,17994903,2014-08-20,389723,Julie, The house is a super quaint old house on a quiet street. Patti is an artist and had her beautiful art on display in her studio. The kitchen had everything we needed to cook dinner and eat out in yard on her picnic table. Ballard is a hip neighborhood where coffee shops are plentiful and people watching is a blast. Sunday was the farmers market with delicious food options. My husband loved that the water pressure was very good in the shower. We easily took the bus to Seattle center and Pike market from Ballard. The upstairs gets a little warm but at night we were comfortable with the provided fans. The only bathroom is on the first floor so it's a little tricky for night visits. All in all we loved the Ballard house and highly recommend it. 
699460,18518062,2014-08-28,13420569,Kathy,"We loved staying in this beautiful, clean and comfortable retreat.  Very convenient to Ballard' s best shops and restaurants.  The bus stop at the end of the alley made travel to downtown and other neighborhoods quick and easy.  "

She showed me her studio where she worked. It was interesting and one of a unique point of the house. "
699460,19311223,2014-09-10,15092343,Roland,Patti and Benson were wonderful hosts. They gave us very useful information about the neighborhood; what to see and do in this interesting part of Seattle. The house was clean and very well kept.
699460,21204677,2014-10-13,20039827,Jacalyn,"Patti and Benson were very kind and welcoming. Patti was helpful with any information I needed to find my way around the neighborhood. The house was very neat and clean, which is very important to me. Patti's art studio was so interesting and unique. It was a pleasure to meet this interesting couple. I would stay there again."
699460,21418681,2014-10-17,16776702,Rina,"Location: Ballard has many good restaurants and bars so it's so nice location. Patti's art studio nearby are good bakery and good 24h-open grocery. And a bus stop takes only 3 minutes walk.

Room: There is very beautiful & artistic. I really like. Bedroom and bathroom are also clean, comfortable. The kitchen is good I enjoyed cooking.

Host: Patti is really kindness person! I met Benson only a few minutes, but I think he also very kindly man. I really look forward to see them again. I'll definitely request to book their house on Airbnb!"
699460,21605494,2014-10-20,12792830,Rachel,"Patti and Benson are wonderful hosts with a beautiful home in a quaint, seaside neighborhood. Ballard is a walkable community, perfect for exploring and conveniently located near Golden Gardens Park (beach with public fire pits). I had a magical experience popping in and out of the local shops, walking along the beach, and enjoying this artistic home. I would highly recommend this Airbnb!"
699460,21865876,2014-10-26,5409887,Elizabeth,"This is our third time with Patti and Benson. This location works perfectly for our event and the place is charming and both Patti and Benson are so accommodating and welcoming! We really enjoying seeing Patti's art throughout the house, also! 

Thanks again for being wonderful hosts!
hugs, Elizabeth and Jim"
699460,22095093,2014-10-30,13126300,Miriam,"Patti made us feel very welcome. Our space was roomy and very clean. Great location in the city.
It was fun to visit with such a talented artist."
699460,22271457,2014-11-02,5178343,Nicole,"Patti and Benson's place is just lovely. Communication was clear and very helpful. The location is perfect with great neighborhoods to wander around, good restaurants, consignment shops and convenient to downtown Seattle. We'll definitely recommend this to friends and stay here again."
699460,22537862,2014-11-09,599731,Kyla,"Patti was a wonderful host and the studio is charming. She gave a great tour of the house and shared useful information about the neighborhood, including a fantastic breakfast tip: there's an incredible bakery right around the corner with the best croissants and quiche you could imagine outside of France. The house is impeccably clean and the bed/bath were perfect--a great base to explore beautiful Ballard.    "
699460,22987209,2014-11-19,5830672,Anna,"Place was decorative, clean and peacefull and I think it suits very well for families or for couples. 

If you are interested in hanging around Ballard-area this is a great place to stay. (there are lots of nice cafés, one situated just nearby is called ""Java Bean Coffee House"") 

Ballard was fairly difficult to reach through the public transportation (King County Metro). I wished to visit cinemas in downtown area so this was a bit of a bummer, but I only had needed to check this out before I made my booking. Ofcourse, if you travel with your own car public transportation is not a problem and the place suits you much better!"
699460,23218148,2014-11-25,6951326,Connie,"We LOVED staying with Patti, who is a fantastic host. This was one of the best AirBnB experiences I've had. The space is clean, unique, and beautiful. The Ballard location is also fantastic - walking distance from fabulous coffee shops and shopping. I'd highly recommend staying here if you're coming through Seattle! "
699460,23437534,2014-12-01,22458404,Pamela,"We had a wonderful stay at Patti and Benson's Airbnb in Ballard. They are thoughtful and considerate hosts who have created a warm, comfortable atmosphere in their 100 year old home. We loved being a few blocks away from downtown Ballard and a great grocery store.  The #40 bus to downtown Seattle was just a block away.  Our stay at Patti and Benson's was perfect and we highly recommend their place for your stay in Ballard."
699460,23837687,2014-12-12,8850842,Frank,"We truly enjoy staying at Patti and Benson's BnB! Their 100 year old home/Patti's studio is graceful, artful and comfortable. The location is close to wonderful shops and cafes in the community of Ballard and public transportation into to downtown Seattle is frequent and easy to access."
699460,24160625,2014-12-21,9491145,Dain And Andrea,"We really enjoyed staying here.  Patti made us feel welcome and at home.  The  house is very clean and comfortable.  The off-street parking and location are perfect.  It is within walking distance of the old Ballard area of shops and restaurants.  Highly recommend...

699460,24486764,2014-12-29,3608716,Martha,"Patti's place is always comfy, easy, and a great place to stay.  This is probably the third time we've stayed there."
699460,25164719,2015-01-08,22648917,Molly,"Patti was an excellent host - friendly and helpful, but unobtrusive. The house was immaculate and comfortable, and beautifully equipped for a multi-day stay. The neighborhood is very pleasant and has many conveniences - grocery, restaurants, buses, library, parks, etc."
699460,26238893,2015-02-08,5409887,Elizabeth,"We LOVE staying at Patti and Benson's lovely airbnb. It is a perfect location for our twice a year event. AND we love the beautiful old home with it's nooks and crannies and living with Patti's super art! 

I love the bedrooms and EVERYTHING is super clean. YAY!!!!

Having a kitchen is a huge plus. 

They are both very welcoming and friendly. 

This was our 4th or 5th stay with them and we will do it again. 

What a great time we had last weekend. 

Thank you so much!"
699460,26935759,2015-02-22,5774048,Alice,"Great stay - really nice and characterful house a very short from bars and restaurants of Ballard. Very clean and comfortable, and quiet at night on this residential street. Patti was flexible and hospitable as a host. Would stay again :-)"
699460,27105016,2015-02-25,5346159,Steph,"This was such an easy airbnb experience! Patti was so helpful and great upon check-in, and then I had everything I needed: full run of the kitchen, clean bathroom, beautiful bedroom. I had absolutely zero complaints or concerns while staying there, the place is beautiful, clean, quiet, and walking distance to all the shops, restaurants, bars and coffee places in Ballard. I would highly recommend this place to anyone who is looking for a place to stay in Ballard, especially if you need a 2 bedroom place, the home is enormous and you will generally have the whole place to yourself. "
699460,28517182,2015-03-25,26601869,David,"Great stay at Ballard Artist's Studio! Patti Shaw, our host, was welcoming and sweet, and her art work is exquisite. It surrounds you in this beautifully quaint, coastal cottage. The simplicity of the design and the decor helps create a calm and casual atmosphere, a perfect getaway. Tremendous neighborhood with a wonderful stretch of shops and restaurants in Ballard. Coffee everywhere. Downtown Seattle just minutes away. Thank you, Patti and Benson! We'll be back someday. "
699460,28815390,2015-03-30,12267045,Julie,The aesthetic at the house is lovely and peaceful. We enjoyed the quiet stay there and felt very comfortable. It's also just a short walk to great restaurants and coffee shops like La Isla and Hot Cakes.
699460,30602402,2015-04-25,26927796,Katie,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay. The house is pristine and beautiful with a fabulous, central location within walking distance to (website hidden) - the shower is awesome! 
Thanks much to Patti and Benson - we'll be back."
699460,31037074,2015-05-01,13223757,Lindsay,"I had a wonderful experience staying at Patti's. She was readily available by text, gave me a warm welcome, and it was so fun seeing all of her artwork. The house itself is beautiful, and in a great location. Having parking in the back alley is AWESOME. I would definitely return on another trip to Ballard! "
699460,31234458,2015-05-03,12723264,Kathy,Patti and Benson's home is a historic and artistic delight in the midst of  a wonderful Ballard neighborhood.   The listing was quite accurate and Patti even made sure we knew that the bedrooms were upstairs and the bathroom downstairs.  Patti gave us a warm welcome to her simple and tastefully decorated and charming 100 year old home/studio.  The beds were comfy - the linens and towels lovely.   There is even off street parking and a short walk to some of Ballard's best coffee and bakeries .  
699460,31912299,2015-05-11,30591684,Kayli,"Patti and Benson made us feel right at home at their beautiful artist studio.  We loved being able to go to the Ballard farmer's market, just a 5 minute walk away, and cook a delicious and local meal.  The location is perfect to entertain yourself during your stay with lots of different activities, but also perfect to relax in the beautifully landscaped yard.  Best of both worlds.  The listing is accurate and I highly recommend staying here."
699460,32340734,2015-05-17,17781930,Miriam Lily,"Patti gave us a warm welcome and was a very helpful host! We enjoyed staying at her original and lovingly decorated studio in the middle of beautiful Ballard. Thank you so much again and all the best, Rebecca and Miriam"
699460,32764789,2015-05-21,17848320,Tanya,Lovely artisan home in great location! Very warm and welcoming! Thank you Patti and Benson! I will book again when I am back in the Ballard area!
699460,33356562,2015-05-27,28101039,Tim,"We really enjoyed staying at the Studio, although this belies the fact that you have the whole house with Patti and Benson in the house opposite at the rear.  Patti was so delightful, friendly and helpful.  My wife and I stayed two nights on our own and were then joined by my wife's brother and sister-in-law for one night only.  There is a tremendous selection of shops and restaurants very close by and Ballard is a lovely friendly area.  We certainly recommend the Studio without any hesitation."
699460,33589732,2015-05-30,3376139,Frank,We really enjoyed our stay with Patti and Benson.  We especially liked Patti's artist's touch to the house and being able to see her studio up close. Quiet and comfortable but only a few blocks from the centre of Ballard with all of its food and fun.
699460,34057001,2015-06-04,27765438,Jill (And Ray),Patti met us at the door and made us feel very welcome. She gave us a tour of the Lodging and provided us with valuable information about Seattle. The BnB was exactly as it was listed and the neighborhood was excellent
699460,34782299,2015-06-12,31914770,Sandra,"Patti was a great hostess--a memorable person creating memorable experiences/stays in her beautiful artist studio. I loved discovering the little unique touches around the house! I also loved the location, which is within walking distance of restaurants, boutiques, grocery store, library, park, and, of course, the wonderful Ballard farmer's market on the weekend. I thoroughly enjoyed my stay! The listing is accurate and the pictures give you a good idea of the ambiance. I highly recommend staying here."
699460,35634378,2015-06-21,25557155,Lena,"This is the perfect place to stay if you're looking for a great Seattle experience!  Patti was incredibly welcoming, made sure we were comfortably settled and had great suggestions for places to check out around town!  The house itself is super cute, clean, and is very well located.  Highly recommend.  "
699460,35988961,2015-06-23,6147352,Kerb,"The tour was clear, fun, and brief.  Patti showed us some of her artwork at our request.  My parents enjoyed the quiet neighborhood and comfortable front porch surrounded by lush foliage with morning coffees in hand.

I will certainly recommend Patti and Benson's place to out of town visitors!"
699460,36110321,2015-06-25,16831778,Maureen,Patti welcomed us warmly and spent quite a bit of time answering my questions about her art and talking also about the neighborhood and Seattle.  Very friendly and accomodating!
699460,36372610,2015-06-28,30023404,Michael,Patti and Benson were great.  Fun neighborhood and easy parking.  Quaint old home.
699460,36892937,2015-07-02,17848320,Tanya,"As a return guest, I am happy to announce it was delightful as the last time I stayed at the artist's studio. Thank you Patti & Benson for making me feel right at home."
699460,37051334,2015-07-04,32091435,Phil,"Wonderful hosts, only saw Benson briefly but did speak with Patti a few times during the visit.  Beautiful home in a quiet neighborhood, walking distance to a public garden and the locks as well as multiple places to eat.  Would definitely stay here again when in the area."
699460,37556760,2015-07-08,7588091,Sid,Thanks!  Nice stay at your studio and look forward to our next visit.....easy visit and comfortable.
699460,37741716,2015-07-10,1632518,Florence,"A most wonderful experience: great location, easy transport to downtown and the airport and shopping near by."
699460,38375384,2015-07-15,15150912,Arielle,"Patti and Benson were wonderful hosts! From check-in to check-out, they were always friendly and gave the best suggestions on local food and different neighborhood attractions. The house is filled with their own artwork, which adds an even more personal touch. Because they live in the house directly behind, we often exchanged ""good morning's"" on our way to grab breakfast and explore. To say this house and it's hosts are welcoming would truly be an understatement. I highly suggest! Nestled in Ballard, it's also quite convenient as everything is walking distance. "
699460,38818034,2015-07-19,8756447,Marielle,"This is our second stay with Patti and Benson, and just like the first it was exemplary. Patti and Benson were accommodating, kind and so helpful. Their place is beautiful, walking distance to everything we wanted to visit in Ballard and filled with gorgeous art. They truly go out of their way to make your trip perfect without ever feeling intrusive. We can't wait to stay with them again soon!"
699460,39383041,2015-07-23,8371699,Joy,"The location was absolutely amazing if you want to be in Ballard.  It is a very easy walk down to the main thoroughfare where all the restaurants, shops and bars are located.  Patti is an excellent host.  She made sure I had everything I needed and is nearby if you need anything during your stay.  The house is beautiful and comfortable.  One thing to keep in mind for some guests is that the only restroom is downstairs, but you will be sleeping upstairs.  This isn't a problem for me, but for some people it might be an issue.  I highly recommend this host, and this rental.  I would stay here again. "
699460,40207191,2015-07-29,32157766,Margaret,"Patti is a lovely host.  I enjoyed the historic house, and it was convenient to public transportation (I didn't have a car).  I wasn't there long enough to take advantage of all the amenities (like the kitchen), but it certainly was a great place to stay."
699460,40717250,2015-08-02,27744847,Hans,"It was a very nice stay in Pattis house.  Quite neighborhood and only 30 mitutes from down town. also the bus connection to Seattle is quick and easy to manage. 
So we really enjoyed our time"
699460,41199822,2015-08-05,32341703,Marie-Laure,Nous avons passé un très bon moment au studio. Patti et Benson sont des gens très charmants. Le logement  correspond exactement à la description. Le quartier est paisible avec de nombreux restaurants et magasins accessibles à pied. 
699460,41318368,2015-08-07,6922344,Christian TASSY,"Patti was an exceptional host... She gave us lots of advice. House artist with a great soul. Exhibition of the work of Patti in the House : fantastic... Place very clean, near shopping and downtown Seattle. We strongly recommend."
699460,41736424,2015-08-09,31355463,Mel,"Patti was great to work with (we didn't get to meet Benson). She met us at the house at the agreed upon time and made us feel welcome. It's a 100-year old house so bedrooms are upstairs and the bathroom is on the first floor which could be a challenge for some people. The bathroom was my favorite, nicely remodeled and filled with artwork. The house is half a block from the bus stop and a block and a half from a nice grocery store. It's a great location. We rode the bus to Pike Market and spent the morning there. After a nap, it was a short drive to the ship locks and Ray's Café for dinner."
699460,42264462,2015-08-12,12294825,Andy,"What a great place to stay in Seattle. The three of us had a good time in Ballard! Patti and Benson made us feel very welcome on our first ever visit to Seattle with a nice chat in the garden, with practical info on the environment, the city, public transport etc. The house was very clean, with beautiful art all around. A pleasure to see and to live in. The house is located in a small, quiet street with amble space for parking at the back of the house. Description and pictures on the website give a very good image of the house, rooms and it surroundings. Certainly a place we would recommend."
699460,43214264,2015-08-18,15335976,Email,Everything was as advertised.  Perfectly fine. We expect to return.
699460,43653122,2015-08-21,38860818,Kate,"Patti is a great host! Very easy to communicate with and helped us figure out places to go in Seattle. Patti had tons of brochures and bus schedules in her house which was super helpful! Also, we got the entire house which also doubles as Patti's art studio but that wasn't an issue and we only ran into each other once! Fantastic art work in the  house too! Highly recommend!"
699460,43919371,2015-08-23,7137075,Linda,"Patti and Benson were great hosts. The studio fit our needs perfectly since we were attending a wedding nearby. It is a clean, well appointed studio. An added treat was spending time with Patti as she walked us through her studio and shared her creations. Thanks!"
699460,44349495,2015-08-25,19810531,Kate,"Our hosts were warm and welcoming and showed us around their historic home in the quiet Ballard neighborhood. Great facilities - great kitchen, bathroom, bedroom and lots of maps / touring info . Easy Seattle access. Short walk to fast bus downtown - can leave the car at home! Would stay again. "
699460,45071439,2015-08-31,18761258,Victoria,Patti was very welcoming and her studio is a very beautiful 100 year old house that is her active studio and packed with wonderful art. She is there during the day but we had the house to ourselves at night. It's walkable to Ballard Avenue and is in a charming residential neighborhood. This is a great place to stay for a weekend in Seattle. 
699460,48921122,2015-09-29,43467584,Dennis,"We found the Ballard Artist's Studio a delightful and attractive place to stay.  Patti welcomed us warmly, and made sure that we were comfortable with her arrangements. The photos faithfully tell the story:  the place is lovely, light, clean, interesting, a characteristically well-crafted Ballard bungalow.  The location in Ballard is excellent:  a short walk to a choice of coffee shops and bakery, a bit further to the central down down Ballard area and the famous Ballard Avenue.  The parking situation in back of the B&B is easily accessed from a main thoroughfare.    The price is reasonable."
699460,49149791,2015-10-01,33360350,상완(Steve),"Located in Ballard area and Patti&Benson's house was simply FABULOUS! Patti gave us clear and specific introductions and we could directly feel more than 100 years of history of the house.
Watching Patti's artwork all over the house was also fantasticl!! Would definitely stay again!! Thumbs up!"
699460,51696758,2015-10-24,1495892,Gregory,"My family and I live in Ballard; I booked the Artist's Studio for my mother while she was in town for a visit.  Go ahead and book it - you won't regret it!

I highly recommend both the accommodations and Patti's hospitality as a host.  In terms of the latter, Patti was very responsive and communicated with me well throughout the process.  It was a pleasure interacting with her and learning the history of the house.

In terms of the accommodations, it's a beautiful older house a few minutes walk from everything in downtown Ballard.  The bedrooms are nicely decorated and very comfortable.  When my mother arrived, there was a liter of Talking Rain (sparkling water) waiting in the refrigerator.   The bathroom is very nice and, according to my mother, the hot water is quick and plentiful.  Bonus points for being very well-lit at night, as it made my mother feel safe when she walked home."
699460,51879728,2015-10-25,5409887,Elizabeth,"We love staying there! Patti and Benson are super hosts. The house is interesting with Patti's art everywhere. We really enjoy this kind of house that is older and beautifully kept up. It is a perfect spot for our bi-annual event. The kitchen is great with a fun pantry. 
Thanks again to Patti and Benson!!"
699460,52863609,2015-11-02,801288,Katherine,"The Ballard Artist Studio was a great place to stay in a walkable neighborhood with amenities nearby. Communication with Patti was easy and responsive. She provided a nice tour of the house and gave helpful local recommendations. The studio has a lot of charm, and has everything you need for a short stay. Off-street parking was a nice bonus."
699460,53754715,2015-11-12,15736596,Bonnie,"I had a truly lovely time staying in the artist's studio. The house itself was charming, unique and quite cozy. Those neighborhood was great for walking around and getting a feel for a distinct part of Seattle. I had the chance to chat with Patti and witness some of her creations- very special! She was so helpful and kind. Would definitely come back and stay again. "
699460,53972366,2015-11-15,3941420,Conor,"Wonderful accommodation in the Ballard neighborhood. Patti was welcoming and helpful. Old Ballard and Freemont are close by and you will see some of Patti's work in various treasure filled shops! Downtown is a little ways away, but taking the bus in means you don't need to deal with parking etc.. "
699460,54277012,2015-11-17,48178223,Elizabeth,On first arrival the house was beautiful and welcoming. Patti and Benson are very nice hosts. A great perk to the home was the off street parking. This home was relaxing and unique. I would recommend this home to others.
699460,54718805,2015-11-23,9585351,Lars,"Lovely stay at Patti and Benson's Artist Studio.  Great communication, really nice place, very clean, comfortable.  The bed and linens are comfy!  I travel by bike (and train) and Patti had set up a secure place for my bike in the house -- a good accommodating touch.  Patti and Benson are, of course, very knowledgeable about Seattle should you need suggestions.  Their place is in a great location in Ballard, very close to lots of action, and access to bike trails and transit to take me further in my explorations of Seattle.  Altogether a positive experience!"
699460,56810377,2015-12-18,48027822,Alice,"It was my first Airbnb experience and it was really good! The studio was clean, quiet and very convenient. There are a lot of Patti's art works in the studio, which was super cool. Patti was very nice, and she told me lots of useful information about Seattle and Ballard. I'd love to stay here next time!"
3404557,15472053,2014-07-09,17378171,Yiyang,"This organization has multiple locations in Seattle and I was the very first guest of this one.

The host Andrew and Matthew are very friendly and helpful. It is a safe and quiet place with great view of union lake. You can also have a clear view of Space Needle. 

I always ride the bike (they provide for free) to the Gas Works Park or University of Washington.

I am sure you will enjoy this place as well."
3404557,16025477,2014-07-20,14906624,Kaila,I really enjoyed my short (too short) stay at the Hacker House. The accommodations went above and beyond my expectations and the location was absolutely perfect. It was a beautiful 30 minute walk to the University and there was plenty of great food and site seeing nearby. I had the opportunity to meet some super cool/smart people and learned far more than I had intended to (Considering I was there for a statistical genetics course). Matt was super helpful and I would love to have to opportunity to stay again in the future.    
3404557,19410012,2014-09-12,17575775,Daniel,"Aaron did a fantastic job of ensuring the house was great. The people here were very friendly. Some also did a great job of teaching me a few life lessons before I left.
The house rules were very flexible, it was easy to feel at home.
The house always adjusted well whenever they needed to add new items to the house.
There were occasional events where we got a chance to meet up with the hackers from the other houses.
Overall, this variety of hackers was a great group to live with and learn from."
3404557,20299402,2014-09-27,8869798,Leron,"I enjoyed meeting all the kind people at the house. It's a welcome change from a hostel atmosphere. Gone are the wild parties and people getting sick in the hallways. This is a place for people looking to accomplish something during their time in Seattle. Everyone I met was working on something, or looking for a position, or making computer art. It was very impressive. It's a good idea to have a place like this."
3404557,28966010,2015-04-01,27010157,Tyson,"Nothing but positive things to say about the experience. The location is idyllic, with stunning views of lake union. The people are awesome, and this can be a great environment for meeting new people and sharing ideas. Matthew, the house captain, is awesome, and very chill. 

Public transportation is quite accessible, but sometimes can be a moderate 10-15 mins away, which might bother some. 

I used the house as a springboard to explore Seattle and possibly settle here, and for that the house is perfect.

Highly recommended!!"
3404557,44755023,2015-08-29,31309643,David,"My 4 months at Cor36 can only be described as exceptional - I was constantly surrounded by fascinating people doing equally fascinating things.  Paul, the house captain is a swell guy, and the bunkbed style accommodation was refreshing.

Highly recommended."
7247767,38801512,2015-07-18,32765293,Matt,"Had a great time with Scott and Dennis! They were awesome hosts and the place is exactly as described! Great location, and very accessible by public transport!"
7247767,39135054,2015-07-20,38774961,Sen,"First experience to use Airbnb, but a very pleasant one. The house is very close to the UW campus, and the neighborhood is quiet at night. Scott and Delmis are so friendly and we felt very welcomed. I wish we could spend more time there, but we had such a tight schedule. 

I would definitely recommend this place to friends visiting UW Seattle."
7247767,39459687,2015-07-23,29318826,Anina,"Thank you Scott and Delmis for having us! we had a great time in seattle! the stay was just wonderfull! they are both very friendly, helpfull and knew a lot of good places in the area and of course in the city! they gave us good tips and advice! their neighborhood has a lot to offer, see and very good spots to eat! the bus to seattle downtown is near and takes you there in about 15 minutes!
the room we had was very comfortable and cozy! the own bathroom is just next to the room, wich is pretty luxury! As i said, the stay was wonderfull and it felt almost like home! we definitly recommend this place and if we return to seattle there is no other place for us to stay! "
7247767,39844499,2015-07-26,13305154,Erin,Scott and Delmis were great hosts. So welcoming and a friendly smile and were eager for their guests to love Seattle as much as they do. They had great suggestions for things to do and places to eat. Great location to get to a lot of the awesome neighborhoods in Seattle and their home was very walkable throughout the U District. 
7247767,40388656,2015-07-30,39197458,Wilson,"Great hosts, location and accommodations."
7247767,40666717,2015-08-01,39251779,Dana,"This was my first Airbnb experience and it was amazing!
Delmis & Scott are amazing hosts and the space was great. Central to so much, and they had the answers on best ways to get across the city and where to go. I look forward to staying here again, the feel was comfortable, and room was great. I felt more relaxed and wouldn't go back to booking a hotel again. 
Best,
Dana Baird"
7247767,41004518,2015-08-03,5406659,Kimberly,"Scott and Delmas have a great place!  Scott and their son were out of town during my stay, but Delmas was very friendly and was happy to talk about the neighborhood and answer questions. The bedroom and ensuite are very comfortable and relaxing. It was a great space to come home to after running around town all day. I think the neighborhood can get noisy, but there was a little fan in the room that provided white noise (and was very welcome after hot days) so I didn't have any problem sleeping. The house is very convenient for bus travel. I had a great stay!"
7247767,41659388,2015-08-08,38517056,Karen,"Scott and Delmis were awesome hosts who made our stay in Seattle such a fun and enjoyable experience. The accommodations were accurately described with more than enough space for our luggage. The bathroom was big with the skylight above the mirror providing all the needed lighting during the day. My brother and I always got to see and chat with them when we arrived in the evening, sharing our explorations for the day and listening to their experiences of having lived in Seattle as well as suggestions for going about the city. We are truly thankful for your hospitality and for being our first Airbnb hosts."
7247767,42195715,2015-08-11,39775124,Matthew,"This was our first experience with Airbnb and we could not be more satisfied with our experience. The hosts were very welcoming, informative, friendly, and accommodating with our hectic schedule. The house was in the perfect location for our needs, we walked to most of the attractions while we were in town, there were numerous shops and cafes nearby and a great and upbeat community. The house itself was impressive to say the least! Recently remodeled, very airy and numerous fantastic vintage pieces, the bed was very comfortable, more than enough storage space in the bedroom and the bathroom and the shower was amazing, prefect shower head pressure and space. We will be using Airbnb for all our future vacations. "
7247767,42621421,2015-08-14,34952737,Shelby,"This was the perfect place for the end of our road trip! Everything exceeded any and all expectations. The house was very modern and open, then room was large and had its private bathroom! Scott and Delmis even provided us with a list of places they recommended. We did not spend much time in the house due to our travel plans but the time we were there, I felt very at home and comfortable. I would recommend their home to everyone! "
7247767,43715192,2015-08-21,29590491,Nile,The place was better than pictured & they went out of their way to make sure we were comfortable.
7247767,44007832,2015-08-23,40534933,Haley,"Host family was warm and welcoming, even made coffee and pancakes in the morning. Super sweet! Neighborhood was good, with easy access everywhere."
7247767,46631172,2015-09-12,38916034,Kwandell,"This was my first time in Seattle & I enjoyed every moment of it. Scott & Delmis were such helpful in anything I needed. Very wholesome people, was very easy going had numerous conversations with them about various topics. I didn't know any places to check out, but when I got there they had two pages filled of things to do in the area which helped me out greatly. Their house setup was awesome and great location in the U District which allowed me to walk the area or catch a bus that would take me directly to Downtown. Scott & Delmis were great and I would recommend them to anyone looking for a place to stay in Seattle. "
7247767,47291465,2015-09-17,37468820,Kim,"Amazing location, beautiful house and great hosts. The bed was comfy and the attached bathroom was (website hidden) Family Friendly: Scott, Delmis and their son were really kind and welcoming to our 2 year old, plus there's a great park just down the road. However, the house isn't the most ""toddler-proof"" and worth noting that the bedroom is off the main living space, so it could be hard to get littlies into bed early when others are socializing."
7247767,51099668,2015-10-17,295772,Scott,"Perhaps the best Airbnb stay yet. Delmis recommended Paseo, which is now one of my favorite restaurants ever.  Scott and Delmis and their wonderful son are fun, warm, and welcoming.  The room with its private bath was extremely comfortable and outfitted with all the little things that would come from very thoughtful people. The location is the best.  Walking distance to my favorite vegan pizza shop, and down the block on the other side of the street is my favorite Hare Krishna restaurant.  That's not the name of it; it's not clear what the place is from outside, but it's not to be missed.  The owner is a real sweet guy. He makes the place. And, The Ave is just a short walk with all it has to offer.  "
7247767,53383068,2015-11-08,1743000,Abby,"My boyfriend and I had a great stay at Scott and Delmis's house! They have a lovely home. Our room was very nice with a comfortable bed and spacious newly renovated bathroom. It was easy to come and go with the key code on the front door, and Scott was usually around and happy to recommend coffeeshops and restaurants. The location was convenient to explore the University District. There were guests staying in the other room but we didn't see them during our stay as each room has a private bathroom. We would happily stay here again! "
7247767,55049957,2015-11-27,49222649,Taryn,"This was our first time using AirBnB and Scott and Delmis set very standards! They have a lovely home that was clean, warm and welcoming. They happily answered any questions about the area and suggested some great places to eat. The location was great, just a couple blocks from UW campus. We will definitely be staying here again if we're back in the area. Thank you for the great trip!"
7247767,58161610,2016-01-01,39081042,Donnie,"My second stay with Scott and Delmis was excellent. This time I had the larger room in the back which had a much larger bathroom. Very clean and comfortable room and common areas. WiFi works great. The road noise was even quieter in the back bedroom than when I had the front bedroom (but it's not that bad and only during peak traffic near rush hour). I was able to walk to bus stops within a block or two, and also a drug store and grocery store within a mile. I could not ask for a nicer stay!"
6714652,38203836,2015-07-13,4579481,Gaby,"Our host, Jon and his family, were so kind and willing to make any accommodation to make us comfortable. This was really a great experience for our specific trip. "
6714652,39234769,2015-07-21,38288622,Tim,The place was great and had everything I needed. I stayed there for 5 nights and had an amazing time. Jon and his family were extremely accommodating and checked in to ensure there was nothing else that I needed. I would definitely stay there again.  
6714652,39864061,2015-07-26,38975959,Natalie,"We had an amazing time!  Jon and his family were so accommodating, checking in with us to see if we needed anything. The studio itself is really cozy, with lots of natural light. It is only about 10 minutes to downtown by Uber or you can take the bus straight there. We will definitely be back!"
6714652,41475631,2015-08-07,27447198,Brittney,The whole experience with Jon was very easy and relaxed. Jon was willing to be accommodating with my work schedule in regards to meeting. When I arrived his wife Monica helped get the room all set up and even gave me their wine key. Both very sweet people and the space is intimate and has a very peaceful secluded feel. 
6714652,42304672,2015-08-12,38679038,Jodi,"Tastefully decorated, well-lit place to stay with a very convenient location, open floor plan and friendly hosts. The numerous operable skylights and surrounding trees provide excellent opportunities for beautiful scenery and fresh air."
6714652,43152941,2015-08-17,11943576,Richard,"Jon's was a great host and went out of his way for us!  He was very quick to communicate and answer any of our questions.  The location of this property is not only convenient but also gorgeous, the studio is cozy and photos are accurate.  "
6714652,44043174,2015-08-23,29593641,Mary Ann,"Wonderful stay!  We were so thankful for this tranquil hideaway. It was very quiet, extremely quiet and very, very cozy. 
The neighborhood is exceptionally safe and convenient and is in a very desirable part of Seattle. 
The space/unit, was fantastic. It was a brand new structure that was a completely separate/stand alone unit, tucked behind the owners beautiful home. Totally private, quiet, safe.  It was like our own private tree house and has many large skylights for stargazing and adding to the peaceful energy. 
It had an awesome, huge tv, with full cable and HBO. 
Very comfortable, relaxing stay, with a very nice family. If we needed anything, Jon was a text away. Jon and his family were so very kind and easy going. 
We greatly appreciate this space on airbnb,"
6714652,45397104,2015-09-02,20123606,Amalia,"We had a great experience. Would definitely recommend it to anyone needing a place in the area. Our check-in went smoothly. Jon was out of town when we arrived, which we discussed when we made our reservation. When he arrived home he stopped by to ask if we needed anything. I messaged Jon with a few questions before he arrived home and received prompt and helpful responses.
The listing photos and description were accurate. 
We got food from Mulleady's Irish Pub our first night there. It's a short walk from the studio. Great food and atmosphere. We would have ate at the pub, but our 22-month-old daughter was antsy. Also, Mulleady's sells and fills growlers :)
Grateful to Jon for letting us stay at his studio with our 22-month-old. She enjoyed ""playing"" the drums. (During our stay, there was a drum set in the work-out zone.) There are a couple parks with jungle gyms within walking distance. 
The studio is very close to a few bus lines. One day, we needed to get to University District and we only had to take one bus."
6714652,45903660,2015-09-06,43215646,Rosemary,"Beautiful neighborhood, with lovely walks and great views. Jon's recommendation of the neighborhood Irish bar was perfect. "
6714652,50113996,2015-10-09,39546425,Andrew,Great experience! The place was very clean and quiet. Just want I was looking for!
6714652,52221513,2015-10-27,42152493,Teresa,Great place. Clean. Quiet neighborhood. Close to great places. Nice to feel like I was living in Seattle even if it was just for a weekend
9300972,57705226,2015-12-28,19927978,Erin,"Didn't get a chance to meet Caitlyn and get husband but she was very easy to get a hold of and explained everything clearly. The place was lovely, in a great location with buses nearby that take you straight into downtown. The snack and pamphlets left along with the toiletries were a lovely touch by the hosts."
6278756,36116865,2015-06-25,18481932,Casey,The place is exactly as described and Malika was super friendly and helpful.
1472532,6522160,2013-08-15,390730,Jim,"Just loved this apartment. The building is a brand new construction in the heart of downtown. The apartment looks great and has everything we needed during our stay. The rooftop deck has amazing views of downtown and waterfront. This is an ideal place to stay, if you want to experience Seattle. I stayed in both of Neha's apartments in this building and my experience with Neha was just fantastic."
1472532,6572110,2013-08-17,6742215,Garth,"The unit is in a new apartment complex conveniently located in Belltown. Very easy walk to all the top attractions in Seattle. I think we were only the second guests in the unit. It was clean and comfortable but needs ""warming up"" in terms of making it more homey and welcoming and less ""hotel room"" like. I spoke with Neha about this and she said she would be working on it. 

Neha met us and let us into the apartment right on time. 

The complex had a great workout room that we didn't get a chance to use unfortunately but will be a nice plus for thosethat aim for a workout. "
1472532,6607344,2013-08-18,8106452,Joe,My wife and I made a last minute reservation with Neha. Her communication is incredible! I would recommend her apartment to anyone looking for a brand new place to stay in a great part of the city. Thanks again Neha!
1472532,6695281,2013-08-21,7784477,Andrea,"We had a wonderful stay at Neha's apartment in Belltown.  The apartment felt like a luxury hotel room - bright, exceptionally clean, and fully furnished. 

We needed to park our car for the few days we were in Seattle and Neha was very accommodating in arranging a parking spot in the garage. 

The apartment is very close to downtown and Pike's Place.  Some great restaurants in the neighborhood too.

Only downside was that the Hemp Fest was happening while we were in town so it was a tad noisy on Saturday and Sunday night but much quieter on Monday night."
1472532,6772792,2013-08-24,1238047,John,I loved the Location of This Brand New Apartment. It was Clean and quite. Perfect for my business trip. 
1472532,6822139,2013-08-26,2458395,Bali,"Great, brand new apartment in Belltown.  Walking distance to restaurants and local bars.  Roof top deck offers great views of the water and downtown Seattle.  Would stay here again."
1472532,6941534,2013-08-31,7955157,Marypat,"Lovely place to stay, within walking distance of everything.
Safe and clean. Building managers are very helpful. Great do park across the street for good dog/people watching.
Thanks so much, we had a great time."
1472532,7107420,2013-09-06,2033141,Adnan,Great stay
1472532,7250210,2013-09-13,2589769,Anna,"The location is very convenient and the parking garage is extremely handy since Bell street was closed due to road construction during our stay.  It was very noisy during the weekday, which mean sleeping in wasn't really an option but when it's done, it'll look great! Just bad timing for my trip.     

The apartment is walking distance to a lot of great places to eat, drink, shop, and just hang out.  Roof top deck has nice view of the water, as well as the Space Needle.  The washer/dryer is also a great convenience so you can minimize your packing.  


  
"
1472532,7368949,2013-09-17,8072250,Bradley,"This apartment worked out great for our family of three!  The building (hence the apartment) are brand new and the apartment is nicely furnished and was very clean and inviting.  While we didn't get a chance to use either, the exercise room is very well appointed with brand new equipment, and the rooftop deck has amazing views with comfortable seating and a couple of gas grills.  True to the listing title, the apartment sits right between Pike Place and the Worlds Fair location (think Space Needle, EMP museum and Chihuly Gardens) and was an easy walk to either location as well as from the Westlake station (the station the airport train ends at).  We arrived by air/train, but on the one day we wanted to get out and explore a bit, there were three ZipCar locations within blocks that had plenty of available vehicles.  To sum it up, it was a great place to stay, Neha was a great host,  and I would highly recommend it to others!"
1472532,7516147,2013-09-23,923856,Tyler,"I really enjoyed this place, great location both for walking and public transport, check in/out was very smooth and the place was exactly as advertised. I would stay here again . . ."
1472532,7852292,2013-10-06,2971814,Eric,"Everything was perfect, host, location etc..... Neha was a great host. don't hesitate to book this place

E"
1472532,7987334,2013-10-11,8676741,Liliya,We really enjoyed our stay! Check-in and check-out were  simple. The place was spotless and a great view. Thanks!
1472532,8212775,2013-10-21,7492933,Carissa,"Great experience in Seattle!  The condo offers all that it suggests and was in a great location for the conference we attended.  The building is new and beautiful.  Its central location near tourist attractions, the pier and the conference center was ideal.    

As for our host, Neha was quite attentive to our requests and put up with a lot of questions early on.  Answers came promptly and concisely with never a concern.  Wifi was great in the room and the utilities were excellent.  Parking was tight, but convenient in the building itself.  

No question, we would stay again at the same place without a second thought."
1472532,8381849,2013-10-28,9283310,Carson,The room was really nice and Neha was always available when I had a question or concern. We would definitely stay there once again.
1472532,8430033,2013-10-30,3605326,Crystal,"I had a pleasant stay at this condo. It's very modern in an equally modern building, much is walkable and there are good bars/coffee shops on adjoining streets. Didn't have a chance to take advantage if the rooftop view, which would have been great as the apartment faces a wall if an adjoining building. "
1472532,8510158,2013-11-03,34587,Raymond,"This was a wonderful place to stay, clean and well kept. Very convenient, and many small stores, convenience markets, and restaurants very close by. Could easily walk to both the Pike Market and Space Needle areas. Highly recommended."
1472532,8618022,2013-11-08,5353439,John,"Awesome, clean apartment in a great downtown location. I would definitely stay here again. "
1472532,8648915,2013-11-10,6429621,John,This was a great place to stay if you want to be close to Pike Place Market. I chose this place so we could avoid driving much and it was perfect.  The furnishings were very nice. Very comfortable bedding and furniture.  Neha was very helpful with instructions.  I'd certainly do it again!!
1472532,8714601,2013-11-13,8879781,Gayle,"We had a great extended weekend stay at this condo.  The location was very good: within easy walking distance of downtown and very close to some exceptional restaurants.  In addition, we flew into SeaTac and caught the light rail transit to the end stop and were then about a 5-10 walk to the condo: saved on the cab fair and acquainted us with the neighborhood.  The place itself was clean and very suitable for our needs and accurately represented in the photos. The Belltown area is being revitalized, but some of the seedier aspects can still be experienced - no big issues but you do need to be aware when out after dark :) 

Neha was very helpful and attentive through the whole process and responded to my emails quickly and efficiently.  She was eager to share her ""local"" knowledge, recommending some wonderful places to eat and pointing out the special happy hour deals that could be found.  She was very accommodating to our schedule and arranged for us to drop off our bags before the official check-in.  I would certainly stay here again on a future trip."
1472532,8737522,2013-11-14,6624991,Cameron,"The apartment we stayed in was just as described. Very clean, comfortable, and with great amenities. Having a well priced parking on location was a great addition. Neha was very communicative which made the stay very smooth."
1472532,8808547,2013-11-18,10002892,Ragavan,"The place was just as described, centrally located and very clean. Neha was very responsive to all of my questions. The parking garage came in very handy so we didn't have to hunt for parking in downtown Seattle. Great experience overall!"
1472532,8949610,2013-11-27,9965023,Dan,It was a nice location and we really enjoyed our stay.  I recommend staying here.
1472532,9017799,2013-12-02,942282,Alex,"Neha's place was just perfect for our holiday in Seattle. Check in and access to the building was simple, the listing was super clean and organized, and the view from the roof terrace was breathtaking!

The space was big enough to host my parents for dinner (4 ppl total) and the kitchen was equipped for cooking. We also had access to paid parking, which was a real life-saver given how hard it is to find street parking in Belltown.

Thank you for making our stay so effortless and enjoyable!"
1472532,9087668,2013-12-05,3947544,Erik,Best place to stay! Easy transfer and entry!
1472532,9168296,2013-12-10,10139142,Sally,"Neha,

Thank you for welcoming us into your home. It is in such a great location, walking distance to all sorts of great restaurants, stores and Pike Place Market. We really enjoyed coming ""home"" to your home each evening.

Thank you again,

1472532,9188493,2013-12-11,8516789,Marcus,"Neha, was very easy to work with, communicated exceptionally well, and made my stay easy. I had a last minute overnight trip for business and in a very short window Neha worked with me to make the trip effortless. The apartment was very comfortable and had all the amenities I could have hoped for. Compared to what you would pay for 1/3 the space at a hotel in downtown Seattle Neha's place was a bargain. "
1472532,9349106,2013-12-23,1149022,William,"We had a nice nine-day stay at Neha's apartment, which is new and centrally located.  Construction on the street outside made getting in and out a small challenge, but once we figured it out it was fine.  The cozy 5th floor unit is fine for one or a couple, and is well-furnished and comfortable.  We never actually met Neha but she was responsive to emails and a call.  Overall, a very good experience."
1472532,9564965,2014-01-02,10634245,Jeff,"Great place, great location and Neha was a great host. Would definitely stay again. "
1472532,9766950,2014-01-08,10151806,Joe,"Neha was very helpful and easy to work with.

There was no toaster in the unit; Neha went out and bought one for me.  Much appreciated!

It's good to know ahead of time that access to the parking is in an alley between 2nd and 3rd off battery. It's an unmarked garage door.  Bell street is closed, so be prepared for that. A good thing, keeps it quiet.
The keylock to get into the building is very unusual.  It's to the left of the door in the wall; a special slot, separate from the standard front door key hole.  I had to call Neha to figure that out after some frustrating minutes.
Overall, a great place-quiet, light, well-furnished.  I'd recommend a dresser for the unit or shelves in the closet at some point for those of us with longer stays.
I hope to stay there again!  Highly recommended."
1472532,9810091,2014-01-11,8777647,Brian & Jana,"As a host myself, I have to be honest and transparent.
Niha's place was: clean, Ikea modern'ish, and is a STUDIO.

The bed/bedding is of poor quality (both main bed and futon). Amenities in the kitchen are sparse, not even a wine glass. I would also recommend, at a bare minimum, to Niha, 'include soap'.

Overall, Niha's place, represents moderate value.

1472532,9858570,2014-01-14,11072278,Lindsi,"Neha was super accommodating for us. The unit was clean, warm and welcoming. We plan on staying here again next time we are in Seattle."
1472532,9955177,2014-01-21,7705592,Bertrand,"The apartment is located in the nicest area of Seattle, with lots of excellent restaurants, 10-15 min walk from Pike public market or Space needle. The place is clean, convenient and with a lot of charm. The check-in/out was easy. I definitely recommend this place as well as the host.
"
1472532,10046810,2014-01-27,10823418,Tara,"We had a great stay here. It was very clean, had everything we needed, and was very comfortable. The bed especially was so cozy!

Loved having the Roku box for a relaxing evening after walking around Seattle all day.

The location was perfect - we couldn't have asked for better!"
1472532,10192078,2014-02-05,10451464,Marianne,I would return to Nehas condo in a minute! Great place to stay and the people were wonderful. And thank you Neha for accommodating us while we waited for our flight. Had an awesome trip. Highly recommend staying here.
1472532,10268603,2014-02-10,5652358,Ronna,"Neha was a FANTASTIC host.  She was very accommodating and considerate.  For example, I told her I was flying in very very very late and she stayed up to buzz me in at 2AM.  It was also snowing when I was there so she offered to let me check out a little bit later if necessary.  

The apartment is in a great location in a new and modern building with roof access.  Very close to Pike's Place and the Space Needle.  However it is about a 40 minute ride to the airport via cab.  Next time I will try to use their train system to save money on that end, If you have the time I would go that route because the unscheduled cab ride was 50 plus tip.

Anyway, everything you need is inside the house: towels, blankets, extra blankets, extra pillows, shampoo, hair dryer, kitchen utensils, television, wifi, etc.  Like I said, everything you need!

Thank you Neha!  Will be back soon 3"

1472532,10504905,2014-02-22,12272533,Lyndsey,"Great location to downtown and beyond. On the corner to a coffee shop, mexican restaurant and pub with artisan pizza and craft beer - all non-chain, local establishments! Perfect size for a small family. We'll be back for sure."
1472532,10578596,2014-02-25,5838611,John,"Neha was a very nice host, who didn't mind when I called her directly after the door buzzer call box inadvertently called the wrong host. The place worked very well for my family, even our 6 week old daughter found it perfect. Would recommend this place and stay here again without hesitation. "
1472532,10754360,2014-03-05,9671110,Erin,"We had a great stay at Sid and Neha's place!  We booked a room with them for two nights after our flight to the east coast got cancelled at the very last minute.  The Instant Book process was simple, quick, and efficient, and Sid was very gracefully on hand to answer our questions about finding/entering the apartment.  The apartment has excellent amenities, is in a safe space, and has a very comfortable bed.  We enjoyed our stay here and felt very much at home.  Would definitely book with Sid and Neha again if we come back to Seattle!  Thanks so much!"
1472532,10821281,2014-03-09,10931340,Mariel,"This apartment was brand new and in a great part of town. It suited our needs perfectly! Everything was clean, and it was nice knowing there was a full kitchen available if we needed it. We ended up using the washer/dryer, as it was wet all week in Seattle! Sid & Neha were very prompt with getting back to us with anything we had questions about. Thank you for a great stay!"
1472532,10918106,2014-03-13,7920116,Natasha,"The apartment is bright, modern and cozy. Access into the building and lock box was a breeze. The location is great and within walking distance of restaurants and bars. Although we were only at the apartment for one night, we really enjoyed our stay. "
1472532,10988301,2014-03-16,149325,Sharon,"We had a great stay at Sid and Neha's place – it was right in the middle of everything and they were even courteous enough to let us check in early when our plans changed. We walked everywhere and didn't miss having a car a bit. 

The toiletries and in-unit washer/dryer were a nice touch for a longer stay in Seattle. Would absolutely stay here again or at another of Sid and Neha's properties!"
1472532,11109402,2014-03-21,1604192,KimThi,"Sid and Neha's apartment is true to the photos and description!  We were looking for a place to stay in which we could get around without a car.  This was perfect for our 3 day visit to Seattle.  We used the lightrail from Seatac to Westlake (last stop), and walked about 10min to the apartment.  Upon arrival we had a bit of a snag getting into the building but we recovered and from there it was smooth.  Our apartment was clean, full of amenities, and well lit with natural sunlight.  There were plenty of extra linens, closet space, and the mattress has a memory foam topper. As for the neighborhood, we were excited to see so many options of great restaurants, coffee shops, bars/lounges, and much more.  Everything was was within a 1-3 block radius.  We enjoyed Bedlams 90's vibe coffee shop accross the street from the apartment building. We also had a great dinner at Local 360 which is one block away.  Sid and Neha recommended some places to get oysters which did not disappoint! Pike Place, City Target, and downtown shopping was also close like everything else.  We did walk to the Chihuly Gardens and Space Needle, all in 15min.  All an easy city walk with no hills!  I highly recommend staying at this apartment if you would like to have a urban experience with Seattle charm! We met so many friendly and helpful locals!  Thank you Sid and Neha!"
1472532,11131346,2014-03-22,3229464,Sara,"Great location - lots of restaurants within walking distance. We dined at WASABI Bistro & Japanese Lounge and enjoyed loads of fresh sushi during happy hour. After dinner, we spent some time on the rooftop terrace watching the sunset, and the ships glide across the water. 

Starting the moment we walked in the foyer we felt at home. The upbeat music in the bright foyer, fast elevator…

The one bedroom apartment was neat, clean, and comfortable! Sid and Neha thought of everything - simple and tasteful decor, dishes/cooking pans, Seattle-specific magazines, Roku TV, wifi, plush towels and toiletries, comfy bedding with privacy curtains, etc. 

Highly recommend - we will certainly stay here again next time we visit Seattle! "
1472532,11172124,2014-03-24,9411770,Wendy,"The cute 1bdrm apt is centrally located and in a modern, high tech building.  While it's less than 10 min walk to Pikes Place,  there's plenty to explore along the way.  Neha and Sid were great hosts and was able to accommodate for our flight schedule.  We've completely fell in love with the city and looking forward to staying with Neha and Sid during our next visit!"
1472532,11279830,2014-03-28,5913080,Anna,"This is in a great location! So close to everything! Restaurants and grocery/liquor stores, and shopping. In walking distance to the market, and the Space Needle. But honestly the walls are so thin in the apartment. And the trash shoot is right next to the door, so if you enjoy gotten woken up at all hours of the night, this place is defiantly for you. Other then the thin walls and loud noises all night keeping you up this place is great. "
1472532,11333428,2014-03-30,4823568,Erika,"Our stay at Sid and Neha's was great! Sid was super responsive and friendly before and after our check-in. The listing itself was clean and close to a lot of great restaurants and bars. If you're looking for a comfortable place to stay in downtown Seattle, this place is the one! :)"
1472532,11395164,2014-04-01,426105,Joe,"Great location, easy walking distance to a lot of main attractions, the financial center, and lots of restaurants and bars.  The place itself is clean and good sized.  There was a kitchen and washer/dryer, but we didn't stay long enough to use it.  The building is brand new, with a view deck and gym in the lobby.  Overall, the place worked out great and I'd stay here again.  The only negative thing I could say is that we were told to use the buildings intercom system to get a hold of the host at arrival, no one answered, so we had to wait a few minutes for someone else from the building to let us in to the lobby to get the keys.  On the other hand though, we needed somewhere to store our bags for a couple extra hours at departure, I called the host and they responded right away and were able to help us out.  Overall I was very happy with the place and would stay again."
1472532,11456587,2014-04-03,13338796,Matthew,"I enjoyed staying at this comfortable apartment in a great location. It was convenient to everything -- Belltown restaurants, downtown, and the waterfront running trail. 

The two sleeping areas are the couch/fold-out futon and a curtained enclave that is the bedroom. 

If you need extra space, the roof deck and first floor lounge are great amenities. "
1472532,11486652,2014-04-05,12303595,Kayje,"This was a fantastic place to stay!  Couldn't imagine a better location, and the apartment was clean and comfortable.  Tons of bars and restaurants within just a few blocks and easy access to downtown, Capitol Hill, and the water.  It was a little cold for the roof deck during our stay, but the views were lovely.  Sid and Neha were responsive and friendly when we had questions about the parking. Highly recommend this place!"
1472532,11548336,2014-04-07,6699500,Britt-Marie,"Location! Great Place! Easy to stay! This 1 bd apt in in a nice building, clean and secure. The apt is a good size for a short stay and well decorated. The bathroom is gigantic! Tons of closet space, if you need it. Short walk to Pike Market and to Seattle Center (Space Needle, Museums, the Arts, Concerts). Wonderful restaurants, bars and shops are super close. We would definitely stay here again!"
1472532,11708534,2014-04-13,11556422,Felipe,"Neha and Sid are great hosts. The apartment was clean and beautiful and brand-new. It was well stocked with everything you need.  Getting in and getting out was very easy. Instructions were all very clear and easy-to-understand. We are very happy that we chose this option we were first time Airbnb users. 

"
1472532,11810499,2014-04-15,13598517,Tony,"Great apartment and fantastic location with nice local bars and restaurants. An easy walk to downtown, markets and attractions. Super comfy bed, and sofa bed and clean and tidy throughout. The roof terrace is a great way to unwind at the end of the day and watch the sun set over the mountains. We really enjoyed our stay here. "
1472532,11965210,2014-04-20,5041378,Whitnie,"Sid and Neha were excellent hosts. Their apartment was exactly as was listed on the profile, and had everything we would need for our stay. Location is ideal for anyone wanting a downtown experience. Parking is not included and was an extra charge. Would definitely recommend this apartment!"
1472532,12384907,2014-04-30,8587916,Anna,"We had a great 2 night stay at Sid and Neha's Belltown condo, in the heart of all things Seattle, within easy walking distance to Pike Place Market, the Seattle Art Museum and downtown. Great views from the comfortable roof deck! Neha was available to help with any questions at a moment's notice. Recommend Macrina bakery on 1st Ave for breakfast and/or lunch and The Mix Martini Bar, around the corner on 2nd, for martinis and small plates. 
If you have a car, the garage is very safe and convenient."
1472532,12432176,2014-05-02,13620638,Jori,"Sid & Neha's charming downtown apartment is perfect for 1-2 people looking to walk the Seattle sites! The apartment has a very nice kitchen, free Netflix and wifi and is comfy and homey, making your stay very enjoyable. Pike Place market & the Space Needle/EMP museum are both an easy walk away, so bring good walking shoes. The rooftop deck provides a great view & a sunny spot for lounging around. Would highly recommend this place to anyone heading to Seattle!"
1472532,12585772,2014-05-05,14417434,Mary-Grace,Sid & Neha's apartment was exactly as promised and very clean.  The check-in process was easy.  The location is great - close to many things.  I was sorry it was raining because the views from the rooftop deck were amazing!  I would definitely enjoy staying here again and for more than one night!
1472532,12669737,2014-05-07,682617,Brad,Great place in the heart of Belltown. The building is brand new and it is on a beautiful park/street. The place was just the right size. Small but quaint. Everything was very easy and went off without a hitch.
1472532,12823850,2014-05-12,6736897,Scott & Daria,"The apartment superbly met our needs.  The location was great, and the view from the rooftop deck was amazing.  Sid, was very accommodating and easy to work with. The large bathroom was quite nice. My only comment -- the kitchen is minimally appointed in terms of gear, so if you intend to cook a lot, it could be you might not have everything you'd want.  Other than that, an overall great place. I'd highly recommend this location!  
"
1472532,12947335,2014-05-15,13232776,Arin,"We had a great experience at Sid and Neha's apartment. It was clean, modern, and in a great neighborhood. Most main Seattle attractions are within walking distance. Checking in and out was fairly easy. We had a slight learning curve with the electronic key, however Sid and Neha were available to answer any questions quickly. The roof top deck also had a beautiful view. "
1472532,13095585,2014-05-19,14810423,Lisa,"This was a perfect place for two people...great location. Walking distance to great food, bars, waterfront, you name it. Really comfortable, clean and quiet.

We did not have a car and frankly, didn't need one. Great location with a fun vibe. Rooftop has a great view and is fun for a glass of wine, or two!"
1472532,14153989,2014-06-13,15026407,Adam,"This place was amazing and couldn't be located in a more perfect area! I stayed here while I was in Seattle to attend a conference at the Bell Harbor Conference center and this was a quick 10-minute (or less) walk from there. The space itself was perfect and had everything I needed (great bed, kitchen, and workspace). Oh, and the WiFi was perfect as well. Check-in was easy and Sid was super available via text and phone when I couldn't figure out how to work the key (you have to turn it counter-clockwise). Next time I'm in Seattle, I'm definitely checking to see if this place is available! If you visit, make sure to spend some time up on the roof!"
1472532,14217535,2014-06-15,9061317,Monica,"This apartment was a perfect place to come back to (especially after 20hrs of flying) Perfectly located and in walking distance to everything (downtown, space needle, pike market). Equipped with everything I needed. Would definitely stay here again if I came back to Seattle. The recreation room downstairs was a great way to meet other people & I had a lot of fun playing games against them. "
1472532,14504988,2014-06-21,12989988,Teri,Great apartment in the heart of everything!  Easy walking/bus distance to all the touristy sites and easy walk from the light-rail station from the airport.  The apartment is a little small but suited our needs just fine.  The bed is very comfortable.  The check-in/out process was very easy.  The roof-top deck has a great view.  We enjoyed our stay immensely.  Would definitely book here again!  
1472532,14773773,2014-06-26,13540307,Shari,Thank you for the use of your apartment.  It worked well for our stay in the city.
1472532,15556172,2014-07-11,14508443,Neil,"Easy access, great space, didn't need anything from the hosts but they provided a great stay"

1472532,15865086,2014-07-17,2216069,Ryan,"Sid and Neha's place was easy to find and just what I needed for a conference in Seattle. The walk into town is just far enough to get the heart rate up and see a few things, yet close enough to pop back before going out in the evening.

I didn't use the gym or roofdeck as planned, but they're there and quality. The apartment is compact, quiet and has all the things you'll need for your stay.

I'll stay there again."
1472532,15950731,2014-07-19,13971112,Christina,"Great place, great neighborhood with plenty of restaurants and shops to explore.  Be sure to ask about garage parking and to check out the rooftop view."
1472532,17167727,2014-08-08,18201253,Jonathan,"The location was ideal, and the rooftop was even better. The interior of the condo was very modern and comfortable, with all the kitchen, laundry, and bathroom amenities one could ask for. Checking in was a little complicated, but much of that was due to our late arrival and a problem with my phone. The check-in process was very smooth, and the directions were easy to understand.
    Overall, it was a great interior, location, rooftop, and host, all for a good value. I'd definitely recommend it."
1472532,18782429,2014-09-01,13308926,Molly,"This was the perfect location to walk anywhere within the city.  We loved that it was in the middle of everything.  Check-in and check-out were very easy, and the hosts were very good about being available if we needed them.  This place had everything we needed / wanted.  We would definitely recommend a stay here, and hope to be back soon!"
1472532,19594289,2014-09-15,16614882,Joanne,"This was my first time using Airbnb. Sid was quick to reply to my first enquiry. He stated his new condo was an easy 10 minute walk to Pikes Market. That was accurate. 
The apartment was clean, and comfortable. We also had a parking spot for just $15 a day.
We loved going to the roof patio featured in this picture. There's plenty of seating and a great spot for morning coffee or an evening drink.
"
1472532,19722568,2014-09-17,8523080,Eileen,"What a great location. Close to restaurants, Pike Place Market, the Space Needle, and shopping. The rooftop deck is a major plus for relaxing."
1472532,19821447,2014-09-19,1317703,Gail,This was a perfect place for our short stay in Seattle.  Great location.  Friendly host.
1472532,20081247,2014-09-23,1783987,Peter,We stayed for 4 nights in Sid and Neha's apartment. The apartment itself is very cool and stylized as is the building itself with a pool table and packman machine in the common area. Being able to checkin late was also a bonus. The shared rooftop area was excellent and although there was other people using it it was never full. The downsides would be the bed was too soft and as someone with back problems I ended up sleeping on the couch by the forth night. The biggest problem however is the other occupants in the building on two of the four nights there were loud arguments/fights going on in the hallway outside the apartment. Also the area around the flat; bell street/2nd street isn't the safest. Obviously these are things sid and Neha can't control but it's worth bearing them in mind when booking the flat.
1472532,20276165,2014-09-27,9325325,Cindy,"We stayed from Sept 23-27.  The place is clean, nice and the location is the best (my boys love the 'game' on the 1st fl)!!! We checked out the roof and it's very nice! Everything is walking distance (tourist attraction, Ride aid and restaurants). This is our first time exp with Airbnb and our first visit to Seattle. Will def stay again if we visit Seattle. ** no AC (don't need one and don't use the heater either!!  the weather is so nice!!). Thank you Sid & Neha!"
1472532,20487373,2014-09-30,13650869,Jessica,The location is absolutely fantastic! Would definitely stay here again. This was my first time using Air bnb and my experience has been really positive. The apartment matches the photos provided and we felt very safe staying here.
1472532,20594132,2014-10-01,16087809,Brad,"Excellent location, clean condo, and all the expected amenities.  The rooftop terrace gives an incredible view of the city! Couldn't have asked for a better place to stay in downtown Seattle."
1472532,20987900,2014-10-09,14037361,Cody,"Excellent location right in the middle of everything.  Amazing views from the rooftop deck.  The space was clean and comfortable, and everything we could've asked for during our stay in Seattle."
1472532,21077687,2014-10-11,8511905,Jennifer,Our stay was great. The location and accommodations were wonderful for the value. Checking in and checking out we're very easy. Never got to meet Sid or Neha but they communicated very well via phone. I would recommend this place and stay here again.
1472532,21171835,2014-10-12,22091528,Derick,Awesome bachelor spot to book in a good location for Seattle action. Didn't spend too much time in the room but it had more than enough to accommodate.
1472532,21333466,2014-10-15,402880,Anne,"I arrived a bit early, while te apartment was still being cleaned, but Sid buzzed me in so that I could leave my bags and go exploring. The place is very cool--cheerful, well-equipped, spotless. It was a little smaller than expected but not cramped. Fantastic location!! We could easily walk to all the main downtown attractions, The rooftop deck (pictured) is a big plus."
1472532,21462489,2014-10-18,19891633,Stephanie,Great place!  Sid and Neha were super nice and let me drop my stuff off early.  
1472532,21509681,2014-10-19,5724231,Foosker,"I had a wonderful stay at Sid and Neha's place. Their condo is warm and comfortable and in an awesome location. 

The building is new and the no smoking group hour the bldg is a plus. New amenities, parking available and a comfortable bed make for a easy time. 

The place is located at the heart of Belltown which gives to immediate access to great restaurants and shopping, Key Arena and downtown. It also gives you quick access to Great neighborhoods like Ballard and Queen Anne which I love just as much. 

I highly recommend this place for a party of one or two who are looking for  a comfortable stay and the heart of Seattle. 

Sid and Neha are great AirBnB'ers - great communicators and easy to follow instructions for arrival, stay and departure. "
1472532,21589611,2014-10-20,15472036,Reed,"Sid and Neha's place was exactly what my roommate and I were looking for. It was cozy, comfortable, and so conveniently placed I couldn't believe it. The rooftop alone was worth the entire trip and I would love to go back the next time I'm in Seattle. "
1472532,21818288,2014-10-24,22899202,Sadie,"This was our first Airbnb booking.  Sid and Neha had simple instructions for entry.  Condo was clean.  We loved being in Belltown.  Close to all of downtown. 
Thank you for a great experience and we didn't even meet.
Sadie"
1472532,21939977,2014-10-27,16925968,M,"We thought the unit was clean and convenient.  It is a walker's paradise. 

One of the things that is important to us when traveling is being home away from home.  Comfort is key to the success of our rest and relaxation.   While the building is new and clean with tons of modern touches-it did not suit our personal preference as one of our favorites.
The place would be excellent for a younger crowd as the furniture and bed decor spelled ""college student"" not middle aged couple. 

We were able to do a lot of walking and sightseeing without the need for a car.  We would recommend our younger friends to stay at this place."
1472532,22011328,2014-10-28,14171089,Terri,"Great one night stay in Seattle- the place was clean and comfortable when we arrived, and Sid was very gracious and accommodating with our requests to have a slightly earlier check-in and out. The bed was comfy and cozy and the space was perfect. Great location right in the middle of everything we wanted to do. A great experience!! "
1472532,22079113,2014-10-29,21847333,Tuesday,Thanks so much we loved the space!

The instructions regarding check in and out procedures were very easy to follow. Sid and Neha were also very accommodating and helpful when we had questions. Overall, the experience exceeded our expectations, and we couldn't have been any happier with the apartment.  "
1472532,22480391,2014-11-07,9714928,Oliver,"Nice appartment hosue in the northern Seattle downtown area, very conveniant walk to Pike Place market and HardRock Cafe.
Shorty's bar and a couple of other restaurants and bars just around the corner.
One bed appartment with good to sleep on fold away couch in living room, no doors to seperate bedroom from living room and kitchen, but that did not bother us.
Washer and dryer in spacious bathroom.
Very nice shared lobby with pool billiards, TV and well equipped gym!
Also very nice roof top with BBQ and Spaceneedle view."
1472532,22994625,2014-11-19,11182069,Aaron,"Listing was as-described, & the location was incredible. You cannot ask for a better walking score pad. Comfortable & clean, as well as quiet. Recommended."
1472532,23093715,2014-11-23,1389912,Jon,"Super cool apartment, perfect for me wife and I to have a fun weekend in Seattle. The location is great - walking distance to lots of cool bars and restaurants, Pikes Place Market, the Space Needle and museums, etc. Getting in and out was smooth - Sid has that process down. "
1472532,23198203,2014-11-24,23988894,Forest,"Absoulutely beautiful and cozy little apartment in a quaint newly developed area. Very streamlined check in/out process, as well as a nice upstairs deck! Would definitely recommend it to anybody wanting to stay close to downtown and Seattle Center, and in good traffic a short ride from the airport!"
1472532,23591409,2014-12-05,2413933,Amritansh,"This is a nice little apartment very conveniently located. With the instant booking, setting this up was a breeze. Sid sent me all the instructions. I had a question about the keys and he was super prompt in responding to me. Couldn't ask for more. I would definitely stay there the next time"
1472532,23820592,2014-12-11,5566462,Mathilde,"This was my first time staying at an Airbnb in the Seattle area, I've always stayed at hotels near my office downtown. The apartment is in a convenient location surrounded by neighborhood restaurants and bars; and a quick walk or taxi into downtown. I'm a light sleeper and this unit was quiet -- I did not get woken up once by elevator noises or hotel doors opening and slamming shut :) The wifi was a breeze, the linens and towels were ready for me when I arrived, and the unit was clean, bright, and cozy. I had a question about access to the building and the host was very prompt to respond. I was even able to catch Monday night football during my workout at the building's gym! Would stay here again and definitely recommend this Airbnb listing.

"
1472532,23943321,2014-12-15,2065202,Cristin,"The place is in the perfect location and we had a great time in Seattle!  The apartment has everything you need including a collection of Seattle books, maps, transit info, etc...  I plan to rent this place again on my next trip to Seattle!"
1472532,24404340,2014-12-28,20316651,Hubie,"Great location, apartment, and communication!

Contact with Sid was easy through Airbnb, and he answered my questions about the listing.  Once my booking request was accepted, I received a message with detailed instructions for the stay.  A copy of the check out instructions were also printed in the apt for easy reference.

The location is great!  A short walk to either Pike Place Market or to Seattle Center (where the Space Needle, EMP, and Chihuly Garden are located).  There are several restaurants and bars close by.  The apt is also next to a bus line, and parking is also available (for a small fee).

The apt is well kept and clean.  The bed has a memory foam top, making it soft and inviting.  There is a large bathroom with washer/dryer, which can be useful for longer stays.  Having an apt with fridge, stove/microwave was ideal for a trip over the Christmas holidays, when many restaurants are closed, and having new/modern appliances is very nice.  A large screen tv with hulu provided convenient entertainment.

The windows look over an alley between buildings, but I don't go on trips to stay in the room.  A rooftop deck is available, for those desiring a view (personally I'd recommend instead a short ferry ride across and back for a great view of the skyline).

"
1472532,24738032,2015-01-02,1968421,Ellen,"The apartment and its location were perfect.  Short walk to many restaurants, Pike's Market, Ferry Terminal, yoga studios, Seattle Center, etc.  Enjoyed the gorgeous roof top deck for viewing New Year's fireworks.  Will definitely stay there again when next in Seattle. Sid is very accommodating and responsive."
1472532,24935348,2015-01-04,6848580,Daniella,"Sid was very accommodating. We rented a car last minute and he gave us a parking spot for the night. We arrived very late in the night and Sid was attentive even at such a late hour. The apartment was central to all spots of seattle. We had a lovely time and felt right at home. There was no body wash or shampoo and conditioner, be prepared to bring your own. The washer and dryer was a nice feature after a week of traveling.  "
1472532,25159460,2015-01-07,14368749,McKinley,"The apartment was clean and modern. The deck on the top floor of the building was nice and had an excellent view, though the room itself had a view of an adjacent hotel. The parking garage space was easy and convenient to purchase from Sid, who also readied the room early for us. "
1472532,25269492,2015-01-11,1657862,Genevieve,"We had a good stay at Sid's Dowton flat!  Sid was a personable host, quick to respond to e-mails and very accommodating throughout our stay.  The flat was excellently located (easy walk to restaurants, downtown and public transit; a superb location for our meeting at the Conference Center), very clean and well-stocked.  A great, no-frills, modern option for 2 to 3 people."
1472532,25761990,2015-01-25,24096045,Ben,"I really enjoyed my time staying here. The place comfortable with a lot natural light. The apartment is in walking distance to plenty of restaurants, cafes, bars and sites!  Although I did not meet Sid in person, he was very responsive to my messages and accommodating to my late arrival.  I highly recommend Sid's place.  "
1472532,25853343,2015-01-27,15694119,Sam,"Immaculate room, fantastic accommodations, perfect instructions. Thanks for a seamless experience."
1472532,25917802,2015-01-29,16923296,Kevin,"Good communication from Sid.  Clean, well represented by the posted pictures.  Enjoyed my stay, will definitely stay again in the future."
1472532,26096064,2015-02-03,23627598,Travis,"My girlfriend and I thoroughly enjoyed our stay. The check-in was very easy and we had no problem locating the apartment. It was a beautiful space and the location was perfect. We timed it, and it literally took us just 5 minutes to walk to Pike Place Market. The apartment was also walking distance from a number of great bars and restaraunts. We would definitely stay here again if we come back to Seattle."
1472532,26153744,2015-02-05,17047405,Neng,"place is clean and tidy, bathroom is large. location is amazing.. you can practically walk to everything. roof top patio is amazing. extremely convenient. Sid was very responsive with questions. complex amenities are great as well... pool table, ping pong table. 
Russell Wilson was out and about just down the block.

 "
1472532,26352596,2015-02-10,289247,Bianca,"Sid was a fantastic host. He was quick to respond to any inquiries and was there to troubleshoot immediately when we were having trouble with the WiFi. He was also very accommodating with our late checkout request as well as with storing our luggage before our late afternoon flight out.

The apartment was clean, well-appointed, and exactly what we needed. The central location is perfect: there are great bars, coffee shops, restaurants, and shops all within five minutes walking distance, plus Pike's Place Market was not even a ten minute walk away. I would definitely recommend staying here on anyone's next visit to Seattle."
1472532,26439329,2015-02-12,12854011,Lauren,"Super clean, nice apartment. Great view from the rooftop and on a very nice road, a short walk from everything (bars, pike place, etc). Building is brand new, very secure, all amenities were covered and very easy to check out and in. Thank you!"
1472532,26517887,2015-02-15,12353260,Jo,"My stay at Sid's place was perfect. The room was comfortable and, as these short stays are so much about location, the neighborhood was awesome. I enjoyed walking throughout eclectic Belltown, and a big plus was the secure parking garage and the dynamic rooftop."
1472532,26766023,2015-02-18,27651541,Leah,This was a wonderful experience. Everything was just as described and the location was wonderful! We really enjoyed going up to the rooftop and looking at the gorgeous view of the city at night! 
1472532,27212607,2015-02-28,20952644,Michaela,"Great place to stay. Central location, easy to walk everywhere. The apartment was exactly as pictured, clean and modern. I'd stay here again."
1472532,27350693,2015-03-02,20567140,Stephanie,"Sid's place was the perfect spot for my first time in Seattle.  We were able to walk everywhere with ease and enjoyed many restaurants and bars close to the apartment. Check-in was very easy and the apartment was clean, comfortable and full of light.  Although we did not take advantage of the amenities within the building, it was great to see the pool table and work out area downstairs just in case we wanted to use them on our down time. 

I highly recommend heading up to the roof top for a great view of the water.  It was nice to sit out there at night and watch the sunset. I ended up renting a car during my stay and took advantage of the parking within the building.  Sid made it very easy and gave great directions.  Overall I had a great experience and would highly recommend Sid's place for your Seattle stay.  Thanks again, Sid!"
1472532,27516373,2015-03-06,22546086,Eric,"Small but nice place in a good building.  Great for walking during the day as advertised, but somewhat sketchy at night.

Apartment is in perfect shape and had excellent basics, as did the building.

I would stay there again."
1472532,27590159,2015-03-08,526840,Ashley,Enjoyed our stay! Convenient location and very walkable neighborhood. The apt was clean and Sid was easy to get ahold of with questions. Would stay there again. 
1472532,27922522,2015-03-15,10330949,Jane,"Sid was available and helpful. Location, neighborhood was great. Lots of wonderful restaurants. We walked everywhere, never used our car."
1472532,28062878,2015-03-16,29281408,Samson,"Host was very accommodating and welcoming! The place was more than we had imagined, and it made for a memorable overnight getaway on the day of our wedding."
1472532,28209975,2015-03-20,6179781,Etienne,"The location was nice. Very close to Pike's, bars, and good restaurants. The washer and dryer were a big plus! The parking spot was also a nice perk. However, we found that the availability for linens and towels (1 towel, 1 wash cloth per person) was limited, kitchen supplies were also slim pickings (example, no filters for coffee maker), and a no response with a question concerning the parking spot was a bit disappointing. More positive notes, check in was a breeze, and the building has a pool table, foosball, and ping pong.

Not necessarily a place for those who want to head to Pike's and throw together a meal in the apartment. We did leave an oyster shucker for the place so if they're available, and you're up for the shucking, head to the market, pick up some Kumomoto oysters and get to shucking. Yum. Over all an ok experience."
1472532,28458454,2015-03-23,29769018,Whitney,"Super glad I chose to stay in this apartment. It was my first time visiting Seattle and this place couldn't have been in a better location. True to the description, all of the major attractions in the area are a short walk from the apartment. It was super clean and cozy as well. Sid was great - quickly responded to my emails and made the whole check-in / check-out process a breeze. Very glad that this was my first Airbnb & first Seattle experience."
1472532,28543020,2015-03-25,12869913,Josh,"Great host. Nice place. Very comfortable bed. Occasional issues with neighbors noise level, but overall a very positive experience."
1472532,28868436,2015-03-31,6809678,Jeffrey,"Friendly, available, organized. Thanks!"
1472532,28969954,2015-04-01,2360504,Christopher,"My girlfriend and I were only there for a night but Sid's place was as described. The neighborhood was next to a great coffee shop and some awesome restaurants and bars, so driving was definitely not necessary. It was a very quiet space with a great view and we would definitely stay there again given the chance. Definitely great place with a very gracious host. Thanks Sid. "
1472532,29157944,2015-04-05,12949252,Paul,"Many thanks to Sid for very clear arrival instructions including the light rail from the airport.

A fantastic location plus a very clean and well provisioned apartment. The buses from 3rd avenue can take you all over (get yourself an Orca card for great value) or stroll downtown. For the evenings that we had an early night, having Netflix was very much appreciated too. Some lovely places to eat very close by.

Our first stay through Airbnb and a very happy one. Thanks again Sid - brilliant!  Sarah & Paul."
1472532,29660624,2015-04-11,7833223,Nicki,"Sid was super accommodating to our entire trip.  The location is great to downtown, the convention center, space needle and pike market.  We had a great time!"
1472532,29830142,2015-04-13,16258256,Joey,"This was my first time in Seattle and it was fantastic! The apartment was right in the heart of the city, and I was able to walk to all of the great tourist spots (Space Needle, Pike Place Market, etc.). I didn't even have to rent a car (although parking is available). The room was very clean, and the roof deck was amazing. Too bad the weather was a little to chilly to enjoy it; I can't blame Sid for that though!"
1472532,30040879,2015-04-16,19286013,Patrick,Excellent location. No problems. Having the parking there was great. 
1472532,30571080,2015-04-24,9166955,Jeremy,Sid was very accommodating during our stay in Seattle. The apartment was located in a very convenient location for out of town guests.  If/when we visit Seattle again we hope the apartment is still available. 
1472532,30770071,2015-04-27,5803000,David,"This was a great central location for our Seattle ""get away"" weekend.  Easy walking distance to the Market, Space Needle and within 30 minutes walk of the sports stadiums.  We had a blast - wish the weather was just a bit warmer to have enjoyed being up on the roof - that view is exceptional!"
1472532,31642377,2015-05-08,26146871,Kim,Very nice apartment in nice area. Roof terrace is a great place to watch the sun go down. Very walkable.
1472532,32040794,2015-05-12,19477349,Fuyang,"Sid was quite nice and flexible about checking in and checking out time. The room is clean and neat, had everything you need when you travel. The location is good too, walking distance to a lot of bars...   "
1472532,32082943,2015-05-13,32378954,Kaylee,"And friend and I went down to Seattle just for a day for a mariners game, and we decided that we would try out airbnb for the first time, and let me tell you, that we will only be staying at Sid's place from here on out. It was better than we expected. It was perfect. Checking in was so easy and simple. The place has great parking. The room was extremely clean and comfortable and the location was on point. I would HIGHY recommend this place for anyone looking to stay in the emerald city. "
1472532,32313920,2015-05-17,16671219,Megan,"This apartment is such a gem! Check in was quick and easy. The apartment was so clean and tidy. Was within walking distance of so many great restaurants and coffee shops. 

I can't wait to come back!"
1472532,32762709,2015-05-21,26843162,Kelli,Perfect little flat in belltown! We never had to move the car. And beautiful views from the roof! WOuld def stay here again. ThAnks sid! 
1472532,32814357,2015-05-22,28242640,Jane,Check in and Check out is easy. Sid responded instantly with questions I had about the apartment before I booked and responded quickly to my texts the day I arrived. Great location! We walked everywhere to eat and explored pike place market.
1472532,33068004,2015-05-25,26823278,Jamie,"Great first experience with airbnb! Sid was a great host and flexible with check in times. The apartment was spacious, clean and located in a great location. We were able to walk to a variety of places (space needle, pike place market, pioneer square) from the apartment and there were numerous great restaurants nearby. We would definitely stay here again!"
1472532,33530156,2015-05-29,2326753,Cathy,Sid was great. We had a great time in Seattle and was even able to take advantage of the roof deck. Great location! Recommended! 
1472532,33677505,2015-05-31,22342963,Rissa,"The check in instructions were quite extensive and we were a bit nervous about something going wrong. However, Sid's detailed explanation was so easy to follow when we actually got there, we were both really impressed at the ease and accuracy of the actual check in process. We absolutely loved the top floor rooftop deck. Wonderful to sip cocktails and enjoy the view. The location was excellent, there were lots of places to eat and drink on surrounding blocks. Close walk to Pikes, the Space Needle and we even walked to a Mariners game which was nice and easy and took about 30 minutes.  The apartment is quite a bit smaller than we were imagining from our interpretation of the pictures, but it didn't matter much since we were out and about most of the time. We did use the kitchen for cooking breakfast which had all the utensils and such for cooking a mean. Also, Sid has a Roccu so we could watch, Hulu Plus and Netflix. This was cleaver. I also really appreciated that Sid had an option to pay an additional parking spot rental fee per day to park in the closed underground garage in the building. This really made things easy on us and feel like our car was safe the whole time. That was a major plus. My husband says he may stay in a hotel next time for a but extra space, extra towels and a more comfortable bed. All and all, we had a wonderful time and Sid's apartment worked great for our needs. I really appreciated how quickly Sid always got back to me. It was always within 24 hours. P.S. The sheets felt like heaven!"
1472532,33965944,2015-06-02,7010306,Mike,"Sid's place was super easy to stay at! Check-in and check-out was flawless. I've stayed there twice and never met Sid face - to - face, but he's always been available for questions. Location is awesome and low-key, rooftop patio is rad.  Definitely will try to stay there again."
1472532,34065010,2015-06-04,22779095,Darren,We had an absolutely perfect experience at Sid's apartment.  It is located in a great spot within walking distance to many areas of attraction.  Perfect communication with Sid-great instructions and we had no problems at all!  Would absolutely stay here again next visit.
1472532,34183691,2015-06-05,15376890,Clarissa,"Sid was very helpful and accommodating.  We had booked at the last minute and weren't able to request for parking beforehand.  Sid helped us secure parking In the building at a moment's notice.

The apartment was very clean and had a nice kitchen and a spacious bathroom.  Wish we could've stayed longer.  It's also just as advertised, five minutes away from Pike Place Markey and literally steps away from some cool cafes and restaurants.  Would love to stay here again next time."
1472532,34518909,2015-06-09,10911796,Tabitha,"A perfect way to experience Seattle! The location is just unbeatable. We were able to walk every and didn't have to worry about a car. It was also right around a ton of coffee shops and restaurants just off the crazy tourist traffic of Pikes Place so you really got to experience Seattle as if you truly lived there yourself. The apartment was perfectly neat and tidy and the building was awesome, we enjoyed a couple rounds of ping pong before we went out every night :) The host was awesome, even staying up until the wee hours of the night to buzz us in since we flew in late. Thanks so much for a great stay!"
1472532,34938014,2015-06-14,28595315,Amy,"What a great place in a great location! Sid was kind enough to call and let me know that he was able to get the place ready for us, even though we were asking to check in almost 3 hours early. The lock box for the key was easy to use and the studio was spacious and comfortable for the two of us. 

The bathroom was huge and the shower had an adjustable shower head, so I was able to pump up the water pressure a bit. My friend took a long bath after all the walking day two and loved the tub!

There is a little market across the street, so we were able to get a few things we needed quickly and Biscuit Bitch is a great breakfast spot on the same block.

Overall, it is a great location - I felt safe walking around, it's pretty and easy to walk to all the local attractions - we did the Space Needle, waterfront, Wakefield Mall and downtown all by food - the only place we took an Uber to was the Stadium Tour (which was only $16 one way to get there - so not too shabby).

I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a sleek, comfortable place to use as a jumping off point for exploring downtown Seattle on foot."
1472532,35308433,2015-06-17,32647010,Jens,"Great place at a great location! The apartment had everything we could have asked for, and is within walking distance of pretty much everything you'd want to see in central Seattle. Clear instructions made checking in and out absolutely friction-free. Superb experience overall!"
1472532,35390768,2015-06-18,32293596,Gary,"Great location!  Just a few blocks from Pike's Market.  Awesome restaurants in the neighborhood.  Staying here we felt like ""locals"". Check-in was exactly as described and hassle free.  The unit is well equipped with a fantastic roof top view of the city. Parking is available in the bottom of the building but with this central location you really don't need a car. We only stayed one night but look forward to staying a bit longer on our next trip to Seattle."
1472532,35539839,2015-06-20,27914421,Steve,"Great location and apartment and photo's were 100% accurate.
Sid made the process very easy with clear instructions.
Apartment was spotlessly clean and had everything we could have asked for.  Great place to stay."
1472532,35695378,2015-06-21,24788201,Joshua,"The apartment building is ideally located for leisure at all times of day. In-unit laundry is a lovely luxury for this cozy apartment. Views of the city on the rooftop are unforgettable. 

Sid was technologically accessible before and throughout my stay. I highly recommend this home away from home. "
1472532,36652577,2015-06-30,20830146,Julia,"Overall, we had a great. stay.  The apartment is in a great location and has fantastic rooftop and nice gym. We also appreciated how accommodating Sid was with our check in and check out.  For us, the only downside was the Tempur-Pedic style bed was very soft and we woke up with some neck/back pain.  However, not sure if this has been a problem for others since we are used to sleeping on a firm mattress. "
1472532,36947204,2015-07-03,6455035,Pam,"Just amazing!  This place is in the most perfect location!  Seriously!  So close to everything Seattle has to offer!  You are within walking distance to darn near everything!  I think our favorite feature in this apartment (and we had many) was the rooftop deck!  What a view!  There is a great restaurant downstairs that has a fun Happy Hour and right around the corner the other direction is a yummy little biscuit place.  

Apartment was very clean and well stocked.  Sid was great with communicating and worked with us on an early arrival.  

I think the only issue might be the soft mattress, but that is purely individual.  I certainly wouldn't count that as a negative because someone else might find the mattress too firm or just perfect!

We happened to be visiting Seattle during a time when they were getting hotter than normal temperatures and no rain for quite some time.  Since this is not normal for Seattle, most apartments, homes, stores, restaurants, etc. do not have air conditioners.  That is the case with this apartment; and since there are only two windows that open and they do not allow for any flow of air, it was pretty warm (hot) in the apartment.  There is a fan in the living room area, but was just not enough to cool the apartment down.  I must say, I bet that had we mentioned this to Sid, he would have probably brought another fan in or something.  He is really good at responding to your requests.  We were just there a short time, and didn't feel like bothering him at our weird hours!  (the breeze up on the gorgeous roof top deck will cool you off!!! or downstairs in the main lobby area; it is chilled pretty well with AC there).        

We didn't need to use a parking space, as we did not have a car.  We walked everywhere or used Uber.  

Honestly, if you are ever in Seattle and need a place to stay...I would say PICK THIS PLACE!  Location is superb, roof top deck is gorgeous, amenities are amazing, restaurants and bars are abundant, owner is available and always willing to provide helpful information!     "
1472532,37547116,2015-07-08,13094801,Eldon,Great location and apartment!   Sid was very responsive and helpful throughout the stay.  Walking distance to a number of awesome restaurants.  
1472532,37834911,2015-07-11,15774603,Travis,"Convenient, very nice, and clean.

My girlfriend and I spent 3 days in Seattle and stayed at Sid's condo.  This place is just cool.  The building is clearly brand new and the amenities are sweet.  There's a gym, game lobby, and a gorgeous roof terrace overlooking the city....and that's before you even enter the condo itself.  

Sid's place is modern yet comfortable.  It is very clean and only about a 10 minute walk to Pike Place Market.  Also, there's a great restaurant/bar attached to the building that has some killer Moscow Mules (only $5 from 4-7 and 10-12 M - F).  

Sid was very responsive and his instructions were clear and easy to understand.  

Restaurant Recommendations:  Rocco's just around the corner on 2nd ave., Top Pot on Blanchard and 5th Ave for doughnuts (Obama's eaten here - good or bad thing depending on your preferences), and El Borracho near Pike Place Market ($1-$2 tiny tacos and $4 margaritas.  Try the Carnitas and the $2 Steak taco..yum).

Summary:  Clean, cool, convenient, great host, great location.

I would recommend Sid's place to anyone and everyone"
1472532,38369905,2015-07-15,3126855,Sally,Wow - the rooftop terrace was lovely - even better than the photos! A shaded area with comfy seating and fabulous view of the harbour. We spent lots of time in the Pike Place market area which was an easy walk away - bought lots of amazing food - and spent time in the cool bistros as well. Loved the pub right on the ground floor - 60 beers on tap! Sid was so helpful with directions and the flat was perfect - spotlessly clean and perfectly located.
1472532,38694999,2015-07-18,568496,Pete,"Sid was easy to work with. He provided all the detailed information we needed to get in and make ourselves comfortable upon arrival. Afterward, he checked in to be sure we had everything we needed. The apartment was very comfortable for the two of us. There were plenty of maps, guide books and magazines to learn more about Seattle. Everything was very clean and orderly. We had all the supplies we needed. The washer and dryer were especially helpful since we had just come from a week of camping and hiking. 

The rooftop deck was my favorite aspect of the apartment. The weather was beautiful so we got to enjoy it almost every night. There were lots of interesting restaurants and attractions within a short walk. One of my favorites for breakfast was Macrina Bakery which is just a few blocks away. 

We enjoyed our visit very much! It was delightful."
1472532,38862752,2015-07-19,2014461,Emily,"Sid's apartment was exactly as advertised, clean and comfortable. He was very accommodating about an early check-in, which was very nice after an early morning of traveling. Can't wait to return to Seattle and stay in his your place again!"
1472532,39272081,2015-07-22,287617,Emily,"My boyfriend and I stayed at Sid's apartment for three nights and had an amazing time. The apartment is comfortable and clean, and had everything we could have wanted or needed. The TV had Netflix, which was great, and the wifi worked perfectly. The location is absolutely amazing! Everything is walkable and there are tons of great cafes and restaurants right in the neighborhood. The building felt very secure, as did the parking. Sid was a fantastic host - very accommodating and helpful, even when we asked to check in a bit early :) Would highly recommend! "
1472532,39434878,2015-07-23,30156803,Olivia,Adorable apartment with an amazing rooftop. I wish I got to spend more time there as it was in a wonderful location with a fitness center. Wish there was more parking options but I was late to reply to the parking request so I guess thats my fault!
1472532,39730688,2015-07-26,28372787,Tim,"Sid was a wonderful host.  He was extremely helpful with everything we needed for our trip.  He was easy to communicate with and took the stress out of our travel.  We loved the apartment and Belltown area.  Staying here really gave us more of a feel like we were at home.  Location, location, location!  It is close to everything that we wanted to see and we saw everything that you would want to see in a short 4 day trip.  I would recommend Sid's place to anyone looking for a great apartment in a great area.  Thank you for making this a pleasurable experience!"
1472532,39903172,2015-07-27,27651424,Robyn,Sid was very accosating with us needing to check in early. Great bed!
1472532,40705762,2015-08-02,25901899,Dan,"Sid's apartment worked out great for our stay in Seattle.  We didn't rent a car while in town, so the location was very convenient as we walked everywhere from Lake Union on down to Safeco Field - along with all of the amazing restaurants, bars and shopping within very close proximity.  The apartment was very clean and has all of the creature comfort amenities ranging from a kitchen to washer and dryer - making it feel much more homey than typical hotel options.  Sid was also very responsive and able to assist with all of our questions.  We will definitely reach out to him again next time we're up this way!"
1472532,42274149,2015-08-12,35815614,Melissa,"Sid was great and super responsive when we had a question about the parking. We had no problems getting in and felt super secure inside. The location was perfect; so close to any and everything you would want to do in downtown Seattle. The apartment was exactly as described, well furnished, very nice kitchen, large bathroom, nice sitting space in living room. We truly enjoyed ourselves and hope to stay here again the next time we visit. I highly recommend Sid and his wonderful home. Thanks so much for sharing it with us!"

1472532,44277058,2015-08-25,28680270,Richard,Our stay was excellent.  The check-in and check-out was easy and the place was exactly as described and pictured.  The location is great.  It is near lots of trendy restaurants and a short walk from downtown Seattle.  Sid is very responsive and accommodating.
1472532,44750340,2015-08-29,26969781,Heidi,Great location and accomodation. The rooftop fire pit and views were amazing! Loved everything about it. Thanks Sid!

1472532,46354913,2015-09-09,42273550,Kyle,"Sid is a great host. The apt was beautiful and modern, located within walking distance of most everything, we had a great experience."
1472532,46464980,2015-09-11,23596579,Tara,"Wonderful time spent in Gene's apartment! Great location, apartment has everything you need and is very clean. Gene was a great host, very responsive and helped me out with some extra requests! If you are looking for a great apartment and host, don't look any further! "
1472532,46590880,2015-09-12,31595361,Stephanie,We had a great stay at Sid's apartment! He was super accommodating regarding early luggage drop off and late check out. The bed and pillows were so comfortable and the kitchen was stocked with everything we needed. Loved that there were lots of extra pillows. The roof top deck was fabulous. We ate dinner and watched the sunset and also had early morning coffee up there listening to the seagulls. Perfection. 
1472532,47240746,2015-09-17,29536070,Amanda,"Location was great, very central. Easy access to transportation as well. The place itself was clean and resembled the pictures. Definitely a small space. I would call it more of a studio than a 1 bedroom. The bathroom was huge which was nice. Honestly the size wasn't an issue because you spend so much time out exploring the city. One of the best features was the roof top deck. Great views and very relaxing after a long day of walking. I'd stay here again. Thanks Sid!"
1472532,48058201,2015-09-23,25393970,Anne,This apartment was fantastic! We loved the location. There is a grocery store right next door which was perfect. We didn't have car so this apartment was great because we could walk everywhere. The apartment was nice and clean. The roof top deck was great to go up and see the city. Would recommend this to anyone visiting Seattle. 
1472532,48676124,2015-09-28,25071396,Katie,"Had a wonderful time at Sid's place. Great location, close to everything. Condo had everything we needed, the perfect base for our adventures. Sid was very helpful and we would definitely stay again."
1472532,48984554,2015-09-30,15549306,Weiji,"The place is very clean. It has a well-equipped kitchen. And we could use the washer, which is great. One minor problem: as we are leaving the city in the evening, we have nowhere to store the luggage ( Sid said he could let us drop our stuff till 2pm). So if you leave late in the day, you might want to talk to the host before you make the booking. But overall, we enjoyed our stay. Sid was very responsive and helpful."
1472532,49759631,2015-10-06,28888101,Neil,"What an incredible experience my wife and I had staying at Sids wonderful condo on the corner of 2nd and Bell. The home is modest and modern and has all the comforts and convenience you would expect from any hotel except Sids place is right in the middle of Belltown and provides the comfort of home as you experience Seattle as a local might.  
The rooftop patio is as the photos appear and if you happen to have a car, then there is a convenient underground parking garage available to you (for a nominal fee that is)  
Belltown -  honestly if you can't find a place to eat, drink or hangout that meets your fancy within 2 blocks of the front door then I would say you might not like stuff because this area is bustling with world cuisine and whatever entertainment your hearts desire. . 
So anyway with all that being said our experience was amazing and I wouldn't even consider staying anywhere else while in Seattle."
1472532,50453951,2015-10-12,18096380,Julie,"Great apartment! Clean, cozy, as described. Convenient to everything. Little dicey outside the building at night but otherwise great spot. "
1472532,50757672,2015-10-14,42067880,Fred,"We never met Sid but talked with and corresponded several times. He was pleasant and his instructions were clear. The apartment was clean and well located. Pikes Market was a short walk away, the Amtrak station was just over a mile away, and there were a number of interesting watering holes in the neighborhood."
1472532,52842590,2015-11-02,42197756,Alastair,"The flat is a lovely space, a good size for single traveller or couple. The coffee in the flat was lovely, perfect for a morning brew, and the coffee machine provided was the perfect place to make it! The Macrina Bakery just a block away made a wonderful weekend brunch, but I'd suggest finding somewhere else for weekday breakfasts. The Belltown Pub has good beer and I recommend the Belltown Burger! The apartment is well situated for the Seattle Centre (10-15 mins' walk) and Pike Place market (5-10 mins' walk). "
1472532,53173950,2015-11-06,16109002,Molly B.,"Sid proved to be a great host. He left me very clear directions and instructions, both before I got there and after I was inside the little condo in the heart of Seattle's downtown restaurant district. 
The bed was delightfully comfortable! The kitchen was more than adequate but all I did was make tea because there were too many restaurants to try - all around me! "
1472532,54000742,2015-11-15,29071773,Tracey,Sids place was great. It was a central location that made it easy to get anywhere in the city. The space was comfortable and homey.

Sara and her daughter, Amy, were the perfect hosts.  Checked in with me to make sure all was ok, then let me enjoy my stay.  I cannot recommend their place enough and am so thankful they were willing to share it with me.  I will be back and plan on staying with them each time."
5403847,36217844,2015-06-26,7020089,Ines & Heiko,"Sara and her family were just so lovely and gave me a very warm welcome. The room was very nice, the neighborhood was very silent and with the bus you can easily go downtown. The bus station is just 5mins away. Smoking on the balcony is allowed, this is great!
We had good conversations and Sara is really a nice host which i can highly recommend! !! If i am going back, iam defenitely gonna stay with Sara again."
5403847,36583799,2015-06-29,25034090,Vija,"Sara was perfect in answering my questions before I got there and a welcoming host on my arrival. Just as description says, this place is comfortably Modern, it has Asian feel to it throughout and it is as Peaceful as any ZEN retreat gets. I loved this place and every small detail about this precious gem - you can feel it's imbued with love and care. An outdoor deck and an excellent book collection were extra bonuses! "
5403847,37358319,2015-07-06,35446983,Liz,"This was my first time using airbnb and it was a great experience. The house was beautiful and very comfortable to be in. Sara and her daughter were so friendly and accommodating. Since my boyfriend and I were visiting Seattle for only a short time, we spent most of our time exploring the area. We were able to talk briefly and get to know each other and I'm so glad that we had a chance to meet such a wonderful family, Sara gave us  a key so that we could come and go as we pleased and it was very convenient. Thank you for making our trip incredible! "
5403847,38141510,2015-07-13,24950835,Patricia,"Sara was especially available to answer any questions that came up before my arrival.  I felt completely welcomed by Sara and her family.  The setting, both inside and outside, is just lovely and tended with great care, generosity and kindness.  The description of ""modern asian peace retreat"" is in complete alignment with my experience of this awesome home.  I enjoyed conversations about good and healthy food and aspects of alternative medicine.  All topics of great interest to me."
5403847,39039217,2015-07-20,5913110,Marcelo,The neighbourhood is nice and calm. The room is big enough and well kept. Sara gave me some nice tips about Seattle and the surroundings. It would be nice to have a fan for the hottest summer days.
5403847,39429589,2015-07-23,35272097,Bert,"Perfect room, bed, house & host. Everything was very clean. Big shower! We liked the vibe in Sara's house. It was peacefull and quiet. Unfortunately we only saw Sara briefly as she was going on a retreat. Great place to stay! "
5403847,40238442,2015-07-29,3981871,Ashkan,Emmy is a wonderful host. She made sure everything that we needed we had. She made our stay comfortable in Seattle. She gave us a ride to train station which was very kind of her.The place was clean and cozy. It was very relaxing and nice and white neighborhood. Short walk to bus stops. I definitely recommend this place.
5403847,41083038,2015-08-04,29637241,Steve,"Sara's house on a quiet, tree shaded street is very welcoming and peaceful.  Sara treats you like part of the family and really tried to make sure I had everything I needed.  The room was clean and tidy."
5403847,41410026,2015-08-07,9515903,Magdalena,"We enjoyed our stay a lot. It was easy to find and good location ( a little bit outside but nice and quiet). When we arrived Sara left a little not for us in case we did not meet on the arrival. However she was there and made us feel very welcome. The home was clean, warm ind just what we were looking for. Thank you Sara!"
5403847,42142691,2015-08-11,35400285,Jewls,"The room was really lovely, with natural greenery seen through the French glass doors. It was a treat to have tea and coffee available in the kitchen. And Sara was a wonderful host."
5403847,42716226,2015-08-15,37479975,Anastacia,Sara and everyone were so welcoming and made me feel right at home. I couldn't have asked for a better first AirBnB experience. This will definitely be my first choice to stay at when I visit Seattle again.
5403847,43327395,2015-08-18,21754525,Maggie,"Great value! Cozy, clean and quiet. I believe this room the underestimated. Recommended! Thanks the friendly host Sara and Amy. "
5403847,43714054,2015-08-21,40327037,Dj,"Great place to stay!   Very comfortable, big room-nice Asian feel with bamboo right outside the bedroom window.    Sara was fun to hang out with and a great host.  Enjoy the serenity."
5403847,44316465,2015-08-25,32501593,Richard,"Sara made an effort to accommodate our travel itinerary to the very best of her ability. I always felt ""connected"" to her and it was comforting to know what to expect upon arrival. 

She allowed us to use her fridge, her dishes, and we were provided with everything that we needed for our brief stay. 

We had some specific requests regrading types of restaurants that we wanted to try out, leisure activities, and shops. Sara was very accommodating and obviously knew the neighbourhood. 

The lock box that was provided was a great ideas as we could easily come and go at our leisure. "
5403847,44963257,2015-08-30,38952201,John,Sara has very welcoming vibe about her. she made herself available to me when I needed her & also gave me my personal space. her home is beautiful as well as the surrounding area. the bedroom in which I stayed was very calm & relaxing making it very easy for me to get great nights of sleep. I appreciated that fact that I was able to get to & from downtown Seattle on the public transit. I would definitely suggest anyone to pay a visit to Sara & her home if you are ever in the Seattle area. 
5403847,46217589,2015-09-08,42789773,Kyle,"This was my first AirBnB experience and I was amazed with the host, location, and had a great time touring Seattle. Sara was a great host  answering questions about getting around Seattle, best places to eat, and makes a mean macchiato. The room was furnished very well. Given the amenities this places is well worth the price. The last night she threw a get together and had a band play and we got to meet other folks from around the area."
5403847,47064274,2015-09-15,24294673,Tresjere,"Sara was a great host. I wasn't in very much considering I was out exploring, but when Sara and I did cross paths she was very warm and welcoming. I enjoyed my stay at her place (which was lovely) and I wouldn't hesitate straying with her again when I return. "
5403847,48351447,2015-09-25,44657440,Daniel,Sara welcomed us when we got there and was very nice and friendly. We loved the house and room we stayed in. Public Transportation is right around the corner no need for a car. I would recommend it to anybody who likes to stay in Seattle and likes a nice and quiet neighborhood.
5403847,49001505,2015-09-30,3525676,Izabela,"When I saw Sara's listing, I booked the room without hesitation and, without hesitation, I recommend it to you. Sara and Amy are gracious hosts - I felt welcome, at ease and comfortable. The room is spacious, with a great bed, a desk, a large closet, and the area as well as the home environment are very peaceful. I had great conversations with Sara and my stay was as much a treat as it was a retreat! "
5403847,49780015,2015-10-06,6601377,Robert,"This was a wonderful place to stay !!!  Beautifully decorated, more than ample size and well furnished room, excellent WiFi, wonderful shower, and very easy access.   Even better, it was very close to family and excellent coffee place.   We will definitely try to stay here next Seattle visit.  We had hoped to get to know Sara but spent almost all our available time with family."
5403847,50326591,2015-10-11,33899761,Priya,"Sara is a wonderful hostess.  As I entered the home, she offered me tea and many suggestions of things to do in Seattle.

5403847,52622728,2015-10-31,15090237,Weining,"Sara was gracious and accommodating of my life-style. She is a great conversationalist, I had tremendous fun in talking to her, and to Sondra (and Amy) too, they are well versed in travel all over the world and in how to live well in doing so. The stay was so much fun. The bedroom was clean and peaceful, and I enjoyed morning coffee in the cheerful kitchen/dining area—I was out most of the day, though, and into the evening.  Close to everything—the U District, freeway to downtown and high tech area around Lake Union, the Eastside. Peaceful garden and quiet neighborhood.  "
5403847,55249914,2015-11-29,48349620,Deann,"My husband and I had the most wonderful stay at Sarah's. We will most definitely stay again in the future. The bed was very comfortable and the house so cozy. It was the first time I have ever slept easily in another bed other than my own. Location was fantastic! So many delicious restaurants around! We did. We never got to meet Sarah, she was away for the weekend but her emails and texts were so kind. 
Thank you! "
5403847,56071846,2015-12-08,1611642,Allen,"Sarah was not around when we first arrived but she had emailed us to tell us how to get into the house.  She was very welcoming and warm when we did meet her a few hours later.  We hit it off easily, and her BnB space was very welcoming and warm.  Our two days there were very relaxing and trouble-free and we enjoyed visiting with our host."
6022715,36402313,2015-06-28,779648,Maria + Erik,"I travelled with my husband and our 1 year old son and this was our first airbnd visiting experience, and it couldn't have been better! 

Andrew and Danielle was very cmmunitative and gave us a detailed information about practical things so we never had to be worried about anything regarding their house, they quickly respond to any of our questions.  

When we arrived they had a made a little welcome package with a magazine of what to do and where t go while in Seattle and other exhibits brochyrs, toothbrush and popcorn :)

The house was fantastic, with a sunny backyard that you can relax in. The apartment was very clean, spacious and the bed was super comfortable and you got all ameneties such as dishwasher, laundry and a nice bathtub! 
 
Also, its located in great neighborhood with cafes and walkble distance to downtown and Capitol hills restaurants, pubs and cafes. Major buslines going about anywhere is just around the corner.
We would recommend this apartment to anyone and it suited us prefect to stay there with our son. Also parking was not a problem. 

We loved the unique and artistic touch of the house, it was very inspiring and such a great and comfortable house to stay in. Danielle and Andrew made us feel very at home being very generous with things that we could borrow such as picknick equipment and they had a lot of fresh fruit, juice and other great food left for us! We loved staying at their house and we would definitely stay here again when visiting Seattle!! This is truly a pearl!

8016646,46643762,2015-09-12,42851656,Mirsad,"Nicolas was great host. We truly felt like at home. His apartment has very convenient position, being close to all attractions, notably Pike street market, Space needle and Columbia center tower.View from his apartment 15th floor is stunning. Subway University station is only a block away. Subway from this station will take you in 45 minutes directly to airport Sea TAc International airport. Port and fresh sea food restaurants are right next to apartment. Since we were on 15th floor despite being in very busy district, apartment was very quiet. In other word had everything you need for amazing experience. So five stars for Nicolas and his place."
8016646,48797726,2015-09-28,44299923,Shari,Great place! In the middle of everything. Clean. Great shower. Comfy bed. Awesome views and nick was a super host willing to help and suggest where ever he could. Parking is a little confusing/expensive but no worse than any other big city. Would def use this listing again.
338091,1140397,2012-04-16,980468,Michael,"What a lovely place. Judy was really nice and accommodating. The apartment was beautiful, spacious, and comfortable. The location was right on too. We were minutes from some awesome bars and restaurants. All in all we had a great stay and I would highly recommend this spot."
338091,1171894,2012-04-23,247147,Zoe,Great location! The apartment has a lot of charm.
338091,1205512,2012-04-30,2198418,Marcial,"Judy was a great host for me and my group. The apartment is lovely and it was really clean. She was really accommodating to my group, and she was always helpful.  We enjoyed our time in the apartment very much, and we'd love to stay in her unit again. I really recommend staying here, you will not regret it!"
338091,1250482,2012-05-08,2226955,Ross,"The place was really comfortable and in a great location, Judy was very helpful even when we booked at the very last minute and we weren't familiar with the airbnb system. She met us to pass on the key and then we just left it there when we moved on. Absolutely no complaints whatsoever and much cheaper than a hotel in the same area, great spot!"
338091,1272377,2012-05-13,257181,Alana,Judy was very reliable and flexible--her apartment is comfortable and centrally located. We enjoyed our stay!
338091,1322567,2012-05-21,978117,Scott,"Judy's place was beautiful and in a great location.  We communicated over text and she was very responsive and helpful.  Parking in the area can be a little tight, but that's probably because there are a lot of popular spots close by!  Would definitely stay there again."
338091,1374075,2012-05-29,1523350,Jason,"Fun space and perfect location. Whether you choose to stay in Capitol Hill or venture out into other parts of the city, Judy's apartment is a great home base.
"
338091,1401771,2012-06-02,2040286,Sarah,This apartment was fine. Great neighbourhood. Judy was easy to communicate with. We enjoyed our stay in Seattle.

338091,1554982,2012-06-25,831851,Russell,"Like other reviewers have noted, the apartment is in an excellent location.  You can easily walk to some wonderful restaurants, bars, music venues and everything else in the Capitol Hill neighborhood.  Public transportation was very accessible to get downtown, too. Cha Cha Lounge, La Bete, and Unicorn Bar are just a few of the great places you can walk to with minimal effort from her place.  I would definitely stay there again.  "
338091,1652450,2012-07-07,2781104,Lauren,"Fantastic location! I was there during the 4th & it's only a few blocks from an amazing spot to watch fireworks. There's tons of bars & restaurants plus a couple parks. Parking was challenging. We parked several blocks away & didn't drive the rest of the trip, which was fine since there's so much w/in walking distance. The apt was clean and exactly as represented in the photos.   "
338091,1745613,2012-07-19,2353461,Molly,"Tons of great light and tons of space, in the heart of Capitol Hill. It's a super-fast walk to amazing bars and restaurants, and only a 30/40 minute walk to downtown Seattle (Pike Place Market, etc.), but the bus stop is around the corner, if you need it. The apartment was stocked with everything, and Judy even put chocolates on our pillows. The bed was super comfortable! It's a hip area, so there was some street/neighbor noise at night, but with a pair of earplugs, you should be fine. Judy was very helpful during the process. We'd definitely stay again."
338091,1899515,2012-08-06,2441468,Andres,"The apartment is located in the best part of seattle and its big and cool. However our experience here was not that good. The apartment wasn´s clean when we arrived, it was full of the owner stuff, there was no room on the closet or the fridge, the trash cans where full of garbage and the internet connection didn't work. Judy didnt came for the checkin or the checkout, she just left the keys under a bench and we needed to figure out how everything work. The apartment is cool but it was too dirty and crowded of the owner stuff for us, we wouldn't stay again there. "
338091,1968853,2012-08-13,1999371,Jim,"Judy's apartment is exactly as described and shown--lots of light, plenty of room, and enough exterior trees and plantings to feel comfortable leaving the blinds open. Easy access to public transit, a bus stop about a block away with no hill to climb to get there. She also gave us great recommendations to local restaurants and hangouts. Judy was not personally available when we arrived, but made certain that both checking in and out were easy and hassle-free.

Those looking for a sterile, corporate apartment will not find it here. Full of plants, books, and lived-in clutter. Kitchen is small but very workable, with an extensive spice collection. Groceries--from urban mini-mart to full-blown supermarket--are within easy walking distance.

Our stay included some hot days, but the cross-ventilation allowed us to stay comfortable. Washer and dryer use easy and quick. WIFI worked very well.

There was a bit of normal urban street and neighbor noise occasionally, but closed windows took care of that.

All in all,  we found it a comfortable base for exploring Seattle. "
338091,2141088,2012-08-30,1397427,Richard,"I had a great stay at Judy's wonderful apartment in one of Seattle's best neighborhood. 

Judy's apartment is well equipped and comfortable with lots of natural light and many plants.  The apartment is in a great location with easy access to downtown and also the highway for getting in and out of town. I used a bicycle to get around and was in heaven.  :) "
338091,2402750,2012-09-24,1501951,Niall,Great apartment! Would highly recommend!
338091,2425476,2012-09-26,2331662,Tony,"Great apt in great location!!  Also, try Analog Coffee around the corner (235 Summit)."
338091,2550285,2012-10-08,3622638,Brenda,"Judy is a great host!  I loved her place, and she was also very responsive and easy to communicate with.  Her place is located a couple of blocks away from Broadway, which is great if you love walking - which I did most of my stay.  "
338091,2722877,2012-10-26,3155470,Rebecca,"Apartment is in a good location, with a number of shops and restaurants in the area, and it's a downhill stroll into the CBD or short bus ride (the public transport is very good) There is no TV, dishwasher or microwave, and while this was not a problem for us, it's worth keeping in mind if you are planning to eat in. Judy was very responsive by email and text.

Seattle is a great city with lots to do and see. The Pike Place market is absolutely worth a visit - especially the fishmongers - but some guidebooks told us that it opened early in the morning and we got a bit caught out when we turned up around 7.30/8am (a few cafes across the road were open then though)"
338091,2868916,2012-11-12,3928745,Jose,"This was my family's first airbnb experience, and it could not have been better.  Judy's place is exactly as advertised -- a comfortable, spacious apartment in a great part of town.  Who knows why we spent so long staying at hotels. "
338091,3069188,2012-12-11,4272161,Callie,"Great experience!  Great space, good location.  Could not rate it more highly!"
338091,3106299,2012-12-17,4285248,Melissa,"Judy's apartment was nice and in great location! Everything was exactly how Judy had described. Only thing to keep in mind, is parking is very difficult in this area.  We spent over an hour trying to find parking the first night we were there. Overall a great experience."
338091,3179232,2012-12-29,1819314,Jody,Great location--so convenient to downtown and all of Capitol Hill. Everything we needed! Thanks.
338091,3193010,2012-12-30,145038,Heidi,"Judy's place is a little gem, just 5-6 blocks off of Broadway on Capitol Hill. Judy was out of town, but made it easy for us to get the keys and check in. Her boyfriend even made sure there were extra towels and sheets waiting for us, on very short notice. The apartment is spotless, with a good layout. It worked well for 3 or us - 1 on the (surprisingly comfortable) couch, 1 on the air bed, and 1 on the full size bed in the bedroom. The only real downside that we experienced was the street parking situation, but you wouldn't have the same trouble if you parked for the day and walked up (up up up) the hill instead of trying to drive/park wherever you went. We only stayed the night, but folks who stay longer may want to note that we didn't see a television. As for us, it wasn't missed. Highly recommended!"
338091,3236433,2013-01-02,2304128,Serena,We had a last minute reservation and Judy was very easy to correspond with even though she was out of town. We had a lovely stay. The apartment is in a perfect location and for New Years in Seattle we had a perfect view of the fireword from the Space Needle right out the living room window. The bed was comfy and the place was very clean. I would recommend this location to anyone else without hesitation.
338091,3313804,2013-01-08,197496,Christopher,"Judy has a wonderful apartment; well located, spacious, and clean. Unfortunately, I was only in Seattle one evening, but even so - my stay was made very easy w/ clear communication from Judy throughout. I would highly recommend to anyone visiting the lovely city!"
338091,3329915,2013-01-11,3463515,Roman,"The apartment was bright, clean and spacious. Very comfy little bed. The temp outside was about 35deg and a small heater was not enough. We ended up moving to a different place for the second night of our stay. Judy was very accommodating and allowed us to change our reservation without any grief. "
338091,3521200,2013-02-11,4661118,Lauren,"Judy's place is cute and in a great location. As other reviews have noted, parking is challenging, but we did eventually find something.  Walking distance to lots of restaurants and (in maybe 20ish minutes) Pike Place Market.   "
338091,3535749,2013-02-13,1676399,Moira,Judy's space was large and inviting - exactly what she advertised!
338091,3695044,2013-03-04,5260338,Jorge,Judy's place is in a fantastic location and is very inviting. A total of three of us stayed there with no problem. Having to find a hotel and parking would have been a pain but this location really made it easy for us to explore Seattle without having to drive much. Judy is a great host and was very quick at responding to my messages and calls. Definitely recommend this place!
338091,3857656,2013-03-21,3731041,Jake,"Great spot, easy to find and Judy was a wonderful host."
338091,3902227,2013-03-25,1881541,Sara,We had a great time at Judy's place. It was exactly what she advertised in the description and pictures. Her place was in a great (email hidden)t too far from Downtown but still away from the hustle and bustle of the whole city. I recommend staying here if you have 3+ people because there is plenty of space and feels very comfy! Thanks Judy!
338091,3989011,2013-04-01,829596,Carlos,"Best place in the best neighborhood. I stayed with my friend and Judy let us borrow an air mattress. I enjoyed walking to the Top Pot donuts 2 blocks away and 2 Analog coffee which is right around the corner.

Good kitchen, very well lit living room and comfy bed and blankets. We planned to work from the coffee shops but ended up working in the living room instead."
338091,4456875,2013-05-06,354338,Carolyn,Great location. Judy's place was awesome. I stayed at her place with three others. She provided an air mattress and the couch was very comfortable. She was very easygoing throughout the whole process.
338091,4524152,2013-05-10,1994525,Lisa,"Great location -- really enjoyed being able to jog to Volunteer Park and then access everything I needed to do Downtown for work. Apartment was comfortable and made me feel like I was living in Seattle for the week. Judy was really responsive and had no issue with me checking-in a few hours before I had anticipated I would be there.

Only thing to note, the apartment overlooks a courtyard area and with nice weather the cigarette fumes from smokers wafted into the apartment (when the windows are open). Probably not an issue for the majority of the year when it's too rainy for people to hang out down there. :P"
338091,4697230,2013-05-20,6429369,Alex,Great spot! Very easy hand off! Judy was super nice.
338091,5087357,2013-06-11,6376465,Kelsey,"Judy is so helpful and nice, very easy to get in touch with, and her apartment is amazing. You can walk to Pike Place, hike downhill to the water and go kayaking, or walk a couple blocks and go to an amazing coffee place or donut place. Besides being in a fabulous location, the apartment is airy, spacious, clean, and really comfortable. My boyfriend and I had an amazing time here!"
338091,5122336,2013-06-13,6764176,Jessie,"Judy was very helpful and quick responding to any questions we had. Definitely fantastic location and great space with lots of light and very comfortable. Will recommend to anyone! 
Thanks again Judy! "
338091,5191548,2013-06-17,2798287,Alexander,"Staying here was great! We never saw Judy but she was so helpful and responsive over messaging. She got the key to us easily, and the place was beautiful (and obviously in a fantastic location). Plenty of bedding and room, convenience, a good deal, a safe location - what more could you ask for?"
338091,5735015,2013-07-14,3524018,Patrick,"Clean, well situated, good sized, quiet apartment, with a considerate host (who left us coffee and tips!). A real home away from home!"
338091,5925777,2013-07-22,6826741,Liz,"suuuch a great place. judy was super responsive and helpful, couldn't have asked for a better stay! very quiet and clean. amazing location, i'd never stay anywhere else in seattle. :)"
338091,6026961,2013-07-27,345458,Wey,"It was a pleasure to have Judy host my party of 4. She was very responsive to my enquiries and requests. The apt was a good size for us, and there were fresh linens and some toiletries for our use. Getting to downtown was easy by bus, but we have been using Uber to get us to Pike Place and surroundings. The apt's location in Capitol Hill is great, as it is only a short walk to Broadway. A note to those with a car, parking is not easy, but with some patience and luck, you will be able to find a spot within a couple blocks. 
"
338091,6101286,2013-07-30,5355845,Larry,Judy was very hospitable and made sure we had everything we needed. She has a beautifully decorated home with lots of space and natural light. She also lives in my favorite neighborhood of Seattle!
338091,6145117,2013-08-01,1420716,Jeffrey,"Convenient location, comfortable bed, beautiful apartment and easy check-in/check-out process - everything I got from Judy. Highly recommend staying at her place."
338091,6460526,2013-08-13,7020613,Sergio,"Had to go to Seattle to shoot an event for 6 days with 2 other friends and Judy was an amazing host. Very friendly and over-the-top helpful with everything :D 
The place is great and roomy and the location is simply amazing. Great spots all around and at walking distance! 
Had no problems whatsoever during the whole trip and this easily trumps a hotel.

People like Judy really do make airbnb worth trying out.
I will, with 100% confidence, book this spot again when I head back :]"
338091,6843345,2013-08-27,5967747,Malin,Spacious apartment in great location (exactly as described) and Judy checked in with us during our stay to make sure everything was OK. Definitely recommend this spot!
338091,6968631,2013-09-01,6444205,Tony,The apartment is spacious and well located with plenty of windows and thus great ventilation and light. Parking is on street and can be a challenge to find - I ended up using a pay lot four blocks away as I was nervous parking the Camaro convertible I had from my rental agency. 
338091,7382694,2013-09-17,1776169,Emmanuel,"judy was incredibly helpful in escorting me through any&every question that arose w/ my first airbnb experience—very responsive via text. checking in&out was a breeze. her place was within a 15-20'ish minute walk or 5-10 minute drive to pretty much every where i decided to trek to, so that was incredibly convenient. the apartment itself was very tidy which made for an awesome temporary home-away-from-home. i personally enjoyed judy's collection of books, original art pieces&plants. judy's bed was crazy comfy, too! tons of natural light pouring in through the windows was also very pleasant. i am already planning my return!"
338091,7894890,2013-10-07,9012735,Abby,"Judy's place was great, clean and very conveniently located. She was extremely helpful and quickly answered our on-the-fly questions about the neighborhood, and even had a really helpful list of nearby coffee shops, restaurants and bars ready and waiting for us. Parking is tough in Capitol Hill, so even though we had a rental car, we decided to forgo driving most places and per Judy's advice, we ended up taking Lyft cars quite a bit, and we also took advantage of the great bars within walking distance of her apartment. We would definitely stay at Judy's again, and thank her for an incredibly comfortable stay in Seattle :)"
338091,8096996,2013-10-15,9130899,Ilya,"Judy was a great host.
The apartment was clean, cozy, and very (website hidden) was walking distance from everything interesting in Seattle, from tourist attractions to hipster dive bars and great local food secrets. I highly recommend this place to anyone coming to Seattle!"
338091,8661409,2013-11-11,5458576,Patrick,"Judy's place is warm, inviting and perfect for a weekend getaway! "
338091,8824084,2013-11-19,9833274,Sarah,"Three friends and myself fit very comfortably in Judy's apartment. It was in the prime location; endless bars, restaurants and coffee shops in the area. Judy was very quick to respond to any sort of question or concern I had. Though I never did meet her in person, she made sure that we had air mattresses, fresh towels and even an economical ride to and from the airport. The apartment was very hip and very comfortable. I would recommend Judy's place to anyone visiting Seattle."
338091,8952756,2013-11-27,8528183,Norman,"This place was one the best AirBnB places I've been to. Also, Judy was very responsive. Highly recommended."
338091,9680661,2014-01-05,2031984,Toni,"We stayed 5 weeks in Judy's apartment with my wife and our 4½-year-old son. I will be very open about both pros and cons of the place - you can't know many of these beforehand. 

PROS (1) The location is great, safe and within walking distance from downtown and some great cafes. (2) No wall-to-wall carpeting. (3) Quite roomy for a studio. 

CONS (1) The apartment wasn't very clean when we arrived, many surfaces were dusty, the bath tub had all kinds of hair and dust in it, parts of the kitchen were just filthy, so while I was working my wife had to clean up a lot before we could settle - not cool straight after two long flights. (2) The apartment was cold, 80% of time it was impossible sit on the sofa wearing just a T-shirt. We ended up covering the bedroom window with plastic, but even that didn't help much. And this was despite the manager 'fixing' the central heating twice. Judy had a small portable heater, which made our stay tolerable, but not comfortable. [we know two couples living on the same street, both had warm and comfy apartments while Judy's was freezing] (3) The kitchen was very rudimentary (no coffee cups or pots [below 4 gallons] etc), so cooking was a pain and we ended up buying a water boiler and a new frying pan just to get by. Judy, however, was reasonable and compensated the price back to us. (4) A couple of times the neighbors were playing loud music late in the evening and were very rowdy, so at times falling asleep was a challenge even with earplugs. (5) The squeaking floorboards first seemed kind of cute, but it was a bit irritating not being able to walk to the bathroom without waking up the whole family, they squeak that loud.

Judy usually was quite quick to respond to our messages and she ordered a set of thermal curtains and curtain rods to the living room but then on the other hand didn't have anyone install them.

All in all, I have to say the apartment is not equipped with many necessities and not fit for a stay longer than perhaps a couple of days when the weather is above 50-60 F. It was not worth the price we paid, unfortunately."
338091,10171534,2014-02-03,9775892,Brendon,Great location and Judy was very accomodating. The apartment was well kept and it was nice to have a parking spot to use!!
338091,10250110,2014-02-09,11400472,Maya,"Judy's place was a delight to stay at. My friends and I enjoyed the spacious living room and had a wonderful time together over dinner and drinks. The location is convenient with the Thomas st. market close by. It was snowing when I stayed and we didn't have trouble with the heat. Judy was attentive and made every effort to be accommodating. 

"
338091,10683991,2014-03-03,6724823,Ryan,"Judy's apartment was the perfect home base for our weekend in Seattle. We came for a conference and the walk to downtown took less than 15 minutes. In the evenings we were happy to explore the immediate neighborhood and were surprised with the numerous delicious restaurants and bars. Also there's a great coffee shop just around the corner (we went every morning). The apartment itself was cozy with great natural light, although we spent most of our time out and about. Great apartment, perfect location!"
338091,11100795,2014-03-20,732418,Aymar Jean,"Great apartment with beautiful light and decor. Very close to Capitol Hill shopping, cafes and nightlife. The street is quiet. Judy was very responsive, flexible and helpful. Definitely recommend. "
338091,11371175,2014-03-31,13167432,Laura,"Judy was very flexible and welcoming as a host. We never met up, but coordinating the space and the parking space went smoothly and she responded quickly to my questions. The neighborhood was perfect to wander around Capitol Hill and the downtown area. It was a great and easy getaway!"
338091,11545089,2014-04-07,5754648,Ashley,Great communication with Judy. Suite was super easy to find and really clean upon our arrival. Highly recommend.
338091,11784800,2014-04-14,14134759,Ali,"Judy was quick to reply and with all other correspondence. She is conscientious of her neighbors. The apt was fine for one night maybe two. I couldn't actually find the parking spot but since we were only going to be there one night I just parked on the street and that was fine. Neighborhood is busy and there is a lot to do even into the wee hours of the night and within walking distance of the apt. 

When the profile stated sleeps 4 I had expected a sofa bed or futon type couch in addition to the bed in the bedroom, but what she had was air mattresses.  I am not sure if that was in the listing and I just missed it.  Also, I didn't ask.  The air mattress situation is why I stated that for the 4 of us one to two nights would be all we could do.

I was satisfied overall.  "
338091,12165892,2014-04-24,2695525,Avni,"Great location and Judy is really fast at responding. Bring your own amenities. The parking is at a different location than the apt, one block up. No heating in the apt, but there is a small space heater available in the bedroom. The bed is comfy and good 1 person. Best point about this place is the host is very quick to respond and accommodating."
338091,12447010,2014-05-02,14861348,Jay,"Judy's place was perfect. The spot was in a perfect location for Seattle, right in the middle of Capitol Hill. Only spent a day or so in the apartment, but the place was really cozy. I got better sleep at Judy's place than I have in awhile. I liked all of the windows in the apartment, as it really lit up the place. I highly recommend her apartment."
338091,12596309,2014-05-05,14697595,Miguel,The apartment was amazing; much larger in person. I can understand if someone stay for a long time how the wood floor creaking would drive you nuts but its no big deal for a night.
338091,12757019,2014-05-10,4210078,John,Judy's place was large for a 1 bedroom apt and in a great location! Getting into and leaving the apartment was super easy and allowed me to do so on my own schedule. No reason not to stay there again. 
338091,12807461,2014-05-11,15285698,Zack,"Judy was professional and responded quickly, letting us book on short notice.  The space was clean, nicely decorated (the plants were a great touch,) and well appointed (clean towels and bedding, WiFi, an air mattress, and extra goodies like coffee.)  I love the neighborhood, too—I used to live a block away, though, so I might have a bit of a bias.  She also offered parking, which was a big plus since street-parking in that neighborhood is a nightmare.  All-in-all, great experience."
338091,13831159,2014-06-05,13611156,Matthew,"This was a superb spot in the best neighbourhood in Seattle - great bars and amazing food very easily walkable.
Highly recommended."
338091,14123376,2014-06-12,11609655,Ashlee,"We had a pleasant stay at Judy's. The apartment is spacious and tidy. It was within walking distance to downtown and there are a lot of restaurants, bars, coffee shops, etc. within a few minutes walk of her place.

Parking was a little tough due to the time we came in (Sunday evening) and this being a popular neighborhood, but it worked out. Just know that you might be parking a few blocks away if you are traveling by car. 

Overall, we had a good time and would stay here again."
338091,14348293,2014-06-17,14018567,Alvin,It was at an awesome location. Very convienent.  
338091,14753597,2014-06-25,10573741,Melissa,"Judy was easy to reach and it was no problem getting in the apartment when we arrived.  Very flexible about check in/check out times.  The apartment for the most part is as advertised, big one bedroom right between downtown and capital hill.  It was quiet and felt secure and my 14 yr. old who is 5'8"" slept fine on the couch so we didn't need to pull out the air mattress.  It was not as clean as I would have liked and I wound up cleaning the bathroom our first night there.  Looks like the corners and behind and under things have never been cleaned.  Also note: parking is an extra cost and the washer & dryer in the basement are an extra cost as well.  There is no microwave, dishwasher, or toaster which wasn't a big deal to me but might be for others.  There were also no smoke detectors that I could see in the apt.  "
338091,14890435,2014-06-28,14990090,Paula,"My stay in  Judy's apartment was fine, the apartment is very spacious and bright. Very safe neighborhood, close to many cafes and restaurants near to capitol hill. cleaning generally lacking, especially in the kitchen and his room, very dirty under the bed. Parking is not include , have to pay."
338091,15049721,2014-07-01,15823873,Roland,"Judy was very accommodating and her place is great.  The location cant be beat and she even had air mattresses, so everyone was comfortable.  She also responded quickly to any questions during the stay!"
338091,15488147,2014-07-10,11331351,Ryan,"Judy is a fantastic hostess with an amazing location in Seattle. We had such as great time exploring Capitol Hill and were able to get to any part of the city because of the central location. Unlike other reviewers, we found Judy's place to be spotless and perfectly cleaned. Judy was quick and very kind in all her communications. If you decide to stay with Judy, make sure you check out Analog Coffee and Crumble & Flake Patisserie just around the corner - trust me you will not be disappointed.  "
338091,15688093,2014-07-14,12921549,Dan,"We had a great stay, thanks!"
338091,16239457,2014-07-23,2386002,Denise,The reservation was canceled the day before arrival. This is an automated posting.
338091,16257688,2014-07-24,6355959,Sam,"We didn't meet Judy, however, we didn't need to as we found the keys relatively easily just a block away from the apartment - which was very convenient seeing as we were arriving late at night. Our trip from the train station was quick and easy via taxi, too!

The apartment itself is in a great location, located close to town. The neighbourhood is fantastic, offering some lovely local bakeries and restaurants that we frequented during our stay. We also recommend the local barber - really great service!

The apartment looks exactly like the image, and accommodated us well - although there was a strange odour throughout the apartment. The unit felt slightly unclean too, and we were a little disheartened to find the MP3 player and heater either broken or missing.

For the price we paid, however, we still had a great stay - we used the high-speed internet a lot, and also frequented the Netflix account on the television, too. It was affordable for Seattle as a location!"
338091,18850412,2014-09-01,20445962,Dave,"The description of the unit was accurate and the neighborhood was great.  It was a little noisy on the weekend when the bars let out, but not too bad.  Picking up the key in the lock box was easy.  "
338091,20697195,2014-10-04,20342927,Raya,"I stayed in Seattle for 4 weeks, so I was looking for a comfortable place, which I could feel most at home at. Unfortunately, there were a few major things that made the stay unpleasant and generally made me avoid spending time in the apartment. In more details:
Pros: The apartment was in a good location, from which you can easily access restaurants, nightlife spots, shopping areas, transportation and really all the essentials. Judy was quick to respond to all my messages, so communication was very easy.
Cons: The worst thing for me was that the place was very unclean. The insides of the kitchen counters were covered with some thick black sticky dirt, which despite my best effort I was not able to clean and I gave up on using the utilities altogether.  The bed sheets and towels had not been changed since the last visitor, which is completely unacceptable for me. And on top of everything else, on my last day I found a pair of dirty socks in one vase...
Another drawback was the building itself - it was quite old, so the floors were squeaking very loudly. The isolation was not good, so it was cold inside and you could hear everything that was going on in the neighbors. I was waking up with the people in the apartment above, whose alarm clock I could hear at 6 am.
Lastly, the furniture in the apartment was old, so a lot of things kept shaking when you touch them (e.g. wardrobe, iron board, etc.), which made me feel a bit dizzy."
338091,41791344,2015-08-09,37196293,Warren,"Judy was a great host. She always responded in a timely manner when we asked about the place. Checking in and checking out was very simple with the provided instructions. 

The place itself was great. It was very clean and comfortable. It was very spacious and there was more than enough room for everyone. There was plenty of great restaurants within walking distance. 

We all had a great time here."
338091,43862417,2015-08-22,10602548,Keith,"Judy's apartment far exceeded our expectations. Her apartment was stylish, roomy, and very clean. My favorite part of our stay was the roof top garden and lounge area. Absolutely incredible views of Rainier and the skyline from up there. It was the prefect place to hang out and have a few drinks before going downtown.

I will definitely be staying here again next time I visit Seattle.

Thanks Judy!"
338091,48830748,2015-09-28,31360005,Tony,Really nice!
338091,50157473,2015-10-10,38881680,Abby,The host canceled this reservation the day before arrival. This is an automated posting.
338091,52943805,2015-11-02,46591500,Chris,The space was (email hidden)ean and very similar to the pictures. It's location was close to everything we were wanting to do.  Judy was quick to respond to all of our questions and made getting into the space fast and simple.
338091,54940152,2015-11-25,8670577,Katrina,Judy is great. Easy to work with and left a helpful list of instructions to navigate around Seattle with.
4238106,46093775,2015-09-07,12862623,Madison,Grace and Jared were great! Their place is in a convenient location and and they are very nice people. I would stay here again if I'm ever in Seattle. 
4238106,47112533,2015-09-15,40000830,Mikko,"Our stay with Grace was super good. She's nice and friendly, Jared was away during our trip. Grace went out of her way to give us peace and privacy but also interacted with us. We went out for breakfast together. Her tips on the area and the restaurants were really good. 

Apartment is very clean and beautiful. No worries there. Bed fits two easily even if they are friens sharing a bed like we were. 

Located walking distance to down town and the waterfront. Next to the trendy Capitoll Hill bars and restaurants area. 

I will stay again if I go to Seattle. Perfect first airbnb experience. Thank you Grace! Hope to see you in Finland some day.."
4238106,48212647,2015-09-24,15960656,Lyly,"Grace's Air BnB was perfect for a more local feel of Seattle! The neighborhood was great and we were never worried about our car. The apartment itself was beautifully decorated and very homey, and our room was small, but no complaints since we got a king sized bed and were only there to sleep. We didn't meet Jared but Grace was an amazing host! Despite her busy schedule and not being able to see her much, she regularly checked in on my boyfriend and I -- that's more than I could have asked for. I would definitely recommend Grace and Jared's home for anyone who wants a very local experience -- we were less than 15 minutes away from all of Seattle's amazing sites, food, parks, etc. "
4238106,49151906,2015-10-01,42904649,Allison,"Grace and Jared had to go out of town last minute and weren't going to be home when we arrived. Instead of canceling on us, they provided easy instructions on how we could get into the apartment for our first night. Once back in town, we were met happily by both Grace and Jared. Both provided helpful advice on our plans while visiting. Jared had to go out of town again the following day and Grace was working nights, so we had a lot of privacy while staying at their apartment.
Grace and Jared's apartment was super cozy and welcoming. It was a wonderful room with a large, comfy king sized bed. We also had access to the kitchen and living room, both of which were very comfortable. The kitchen was well stocked and easy to use. The location was super convenient to downtown, the Seattle center and Lake Union. We biked everywhere quite easily- once we got used to the hills. 
My first airbnb experience with Grace and Jared was wonderful. I thoroughly enjoyed our stay. I would suggest their place to anyone interested in staying in Seattle!!"
4238106,49692743,2015-10-05,622206,Allen,"I absolutely loved staying over at Grace's place. It's so close to downtown Seattle and the room is really nice and cozy. Not only did I love the location of the place, but the host Grace was really kind and accommodating to our needs. She had a very well thought out travel recommendation printed out for us as well. 
All in all, I highly recommend anyone planning to stay in Seattle to check out Grace's place. You will not be disappointed!"
4238106,51562994,2015-10-21,2552909,Gabby,"Communication with Grace and Jared was easy, quick and thoughtful (they checked to make sure I got into their place okay as they were out of town on the first few days I was there and to see if I needed anything). I only had the pleasure of meeting Grace, she was very warm and welcoming! I barely heard a peep from them or neighbours considering it's an old building. They had a beautiful home, with everything you could need for a visit to Seattle including a welcome package of recommendations! The house is a thoughtfully put together home with beautifully personal touches which was comforting to me as I was a little homesick being so far from home. Felt more like visiting a friends place! Perfect location to walk, ride or bus to downtown, Capitol Hill or CenturyLink (where I spent most of my time during my visit). Everything was clean and dust free. The bed was huge and super comfortable and the shower was great (things I usually miss about being at home, but not at Grace and Jareds)!"
7618526,43997809,2015-08-23,29838930,Seungwon,"Didn't get to meet him when i checked in but he stayed in touch to make sure i get in without any trouble.  Clean place, in the heart of Capital hill, 15 mins walk to Seattle downtown.  Easy public transportation.  "
7618526,45140442,2015-08-31,22585604,Jacob,"Jeffrey met us later in the evening on the first day to give a quick tour (he met us later in the evening based on our flight times). A friend and I were in town for the PAX convention and we only saw Jeffrey twice during the whole four day period - very easy to get along with. Space is super walkable to public transportation and also close to the convention centre (it's near the community college, so there was good restaurants around as well). Great for a couple or a single if you don't mind the sound of turtles swimming around a tank. :)"
6249164,34481419,2015-06-08,33466839,Cristine,This was a really great experience! Great conversations and company. I would definitely recommend this bnb for anyone looking for pleasant people with unique interests.
6249164,34994652,2015-06-14,33787565,Alexis,"This was my first Airbnb stay, and it was absolutely wonderful. Judith was so welcoming and really just made me feel like one of the family. If you are new to Seattle, she will give you tons of suggestions for things to do, places to go, and how to get there. The room was exactly as described and pictured; the house is very colorful and full of art, literature, and light. Their dog, Mocha, is very sweet and easy to make friends with. I highly recommend this host!"
6249164,36224041,2015-06-26,7485789,Julian,"I really enjoyed my stay here. The hosts are both very kind and likeable people, the room feels very secluded and quiet, especially when you are the only guest, which was most of my stay, and everything was really clean. I can't emphasize enough what nice, interesting people the hosts are."
6249164,36986147,2015-07-03,12701046,Gina,"I have absolutely loved staying with Judith and Gary this week! I am in the middle of a two week class in Seattle, and since I live about 100 miles away, I was looking for a quiet, cozy place to spend my nights  during the week. My first week was absolutely perfect, and I found the room to be just as described and pictured. The neighborhood is quiet and friendly, and I looked forward to reading and having a cup of tea in the yard every evening. Judith and Gary are hospitable and friendly, and my morning cup of coffee with Judith and sweet pup Mocha were filled with stimulating conversation and friendly exchanges. I really feel as though I've been staying with old friends! I have one week of school left and am looking forward to 4 more nights staying with these lovely people. "
6249164,37771435,2015-07-10,12701046,Gina,"After my second week of staying with Judith and Gary, I stand by what I said in my earlier review. They are kind-hearted, welcoming, and friendly. I felt as though I could have my privacy after a long day of class, but also that they were there to have pleasant conversation with in the evenings and mornings. I would definitely stay here again, anytime. Comfortable bed, nice neighborhood, and great vibe. Hope to see you all again soon! "
6249164,38212756,2015-07-13,37046795,Bryan,"My first Airbnb experience was great, thanks to Judy and her husband. Their room had all that I needed. In addition, I was provided with plenty of guides/magazines for my stay in Seattle. It was also nice to have Judy give me tips to commuting to downtown. "
6249164,39164448,2015-07-21,32040129,Kate,"I had a fantastic time staying with Judith and Gary. They made me feel very welcome in their lovely home and I thoroughly enjoyed my time with them. My room was very comfortable with the bathroom right next door. 

Judith was very kind and picked me and my big bag up from the tram stop on a hot day. She gave me lots of suggestions for sightseeing  - it was nice to chat to her over the tasty breads and jams she set out in the morning.  

After a busy day downtown it was nice to share my experiences before chilling out in my room. I paticularly enjoyed watching a bit of tv with both of them one evening. 

Special mention to Mocha the dog - the supervisor of the house!
"
6249164,41242226,2015-08-05,11401050,Cathy,"This was a lovely stay.  The room is just as pictured with personal, homey touches, lots of local travel info and a great welcome binder.  Judith was a most welcoming, kind and caring host!  She stayed up late for my arrival and set up the coffeemaker (with a handy travel cup) so I could brew & take a along coffee when she heard I'd be leaving very early one morning.  Thank you Judith!"
6249164,41809741,2015-08-09,37845129,Deeya,Judith was very accommodating & sweet. Beautiful & comfortable home for a great price. Thank you!
6249164,42332224,2015-08-12,24202762,Diana,"Very friendly and helpful hostess.  Described the area very well, places to visit and to eat.  Comfortable room.  Good bathroom.  Easy to access the house.  Coffee or tea available in the morning."
6249164,43289158,2015-08-18,10427447,Ken,"Staying here was the one of the best choice I made in this trip. Judith and Gary have a sweet and beautiful place in a quiet neighborhood. Home feeling comfortable bedding and bathroom's shiny. There was a closet space for me to hang my clothes. They know the city so well and they were giving so much useful advises. You'll have all the maps and and information like attraction guides in your room as well as the living room. 

I had perfect coffee every morning in their kitchen with a nice view. The house's filled with art pieces and great books, lights set with great atmosphere (of course). I felt more than welcomed with all the chatting we had and assistance they gave me during the stay, also the interactions with Mocha (the smart dog with a lovely character).

The location is good, I've tried buses to downtown and transportation with lightrail, both reliable. Uber pick up will be around 3~7mins. There are local restaurants and cafes on the way down to community center, recommend ""Jude's Old Town"" and ""Nate's Wings and Waffles"". It's a pity I never get the chance to try ""Red Wing Cafe"". The Kubota Garden nearby is a refreshing place to take a walk.

Thank you Judith and Gary (and Mocha) for treated me so well and sharing all the stuff with me, it was really nice and I appreciate it. Hope I can visit you again soon."
6249164,43829843,2015-08-22,2574018,Kelly,Judith was an amazing host and I felt so welcomed in her home. She provided great tips that saved me from being late to a wedding. I wish I could have stayed there longer and I will definitely stay there again if I am in Seattle. 
6249164,45383573,2015-09-02,2400554,Nick,"My hosts Judith & Gary were welcoming and kind, relaxed and authentic, generous and thoughtful. Got along pretty well with Mocha too! I loved staying in their cozy, comfortable home and enjoyed my time there, with the lake just minutes away. The neighborhood is up and coming, but feels pretty safe. With bus routes nearby, you can easily get to the city in well under an hour."
6249164,46081115,2015-09-07,43134929,Stefan,"Vielen Dank für meine erste tolle Erfahrung mit airbnb. Ich wurde herzlich aufgenohmen. Das Zimmer und das Bad war sauber und angenehm. Ich konnte nach langer Zeit wieder einmal Deutsch sprechen und Judith hat mir sehr geholfen meine Tagestrips zu planen. Sie weiss viel über Seattle und hat auch Karten und Prospekte bereit. Leider hatte ich nur zwei Nächte in Seattle verbracht, ich kann es aber jedem weiterempfehlen. Wir hatten spannende Diskussionen. 
Vielen Dank nocheinmal Gary und Judith"
6249164,47430125,2015-09-18,20428536,Yutian,"Judith and her husband were wonderful host , it's so warm and comfortable to be there of their lovely home. They shared the house with welcome smile and many kind of details to treated me like a old friend, the delicious dinner the sweet cakes the wonderful communications, all of that made me feel that I had a great time to stay with them , it's a really nice place to stay when you are looking for a place in Seattle ."
6249164,48032763,2015-09-22,5492546,Jeanne,"The room was just what I expected. The bathroom was convenient and I was the only person using it, since their other room wasn't rented.  
The hosts sleep on the lower level, so it felt very private. 
The house was clean and homey. Very creatively decorated with a lot of Judith's artwork.
The neighborhood was quiet and fairly safe."
6249164,49148290,2015-10-01,32419224,Loren,"Judith and Gary were very warm and welcoming both before and upon my arrival. As I had been up since 3am, I immediately went to bed and did not really get a change to converse with them until two days later, and they were both delightful people. As I travel to the Seattle area often, I hope to stay with them again soon."
6249164,53162904,2015-11-05,12701046,Gina,"This was my third time staying with Judith, Gary, and Mocha and of course they were as hospitable as ever. I felt very welcome and enjoyed the dynamic conversation and candlelight. The room is cozy and the bed comfortable. I will stay here again if I have the opportunity. Thank you! Can't wait to see you again soon :) "
5992032,31813670,2015-05-10,31045438,Avalon,Host was great. Everything was clearly labeled and the apartment was very clean and comfortable! Very close to everything you'd want to explore in Seattle and the parking at the complex was definitely a plus! Would highly recommend and would happily book again!
5992032,32417203,2015-05-17,32769160,Leah,"Fantastic locations for a weekend Seattle trip! The apartment was clean, tidy and had all the essentials we needed for our two nights stay (parking spot included)! The neighborhood also has a lot to offer. Great restaurants, cafes and bars within walking distance. Shiva is an awesome host. He's always quick to respond to any questions we had about the apartment or area. We love the little labels all around the apartment, his taste in decor, and the beautiful flowers on the dining table. Would book again. "
5992032,33137897,2015-05-25,29270530,Danica,"This was a great apartment in the Fremont Neighboorhood. There was a lot of places to explore just a few minutes walk from the apartment. We went on a weekend and got to visit the Fremont Market, definitely a must see if you are there on a Sunday. It is also 15-20min drive to most of the main attractions Seattle has to offer. 

The apartment was clean and spacious. It slept the 5 of us very comfortably. Shiva provided pictures of where the apartment was located and where the private parking space was making it easy to find. This was very helpful since we arrived after it was dark. 

Shiva was quick to respond to any questions.   "
5992032,35670259,2015-06-21,32791665,Lisa,"This place was great! The host was very nice and accommodating. The pictures are accurate to the actual space. It was clean, spacious, close to lots of food/shops and down the street from the solstice festival! "

I went for a morning run over the Aurora bridge and took some nice pictures from there. Also got to see the Fremont troll!  We had a car, so the parking spot was definitely a plus.  On our second day we walked to the Woodland Park Zoo (23 minute walk!) and grabbed breakfast on the way.  Shiva is a very helpful host and offered lots of tips and suggestions. My teenagers had a very comfortable stay and loved Shiva's apartment. They said he was a ""very cool guy""! I think they are quite correct.  :)"
5992032,45212477,2015-08-31,34614135,Jason,"Great place and location. Everything went super smooth getting there and getting set up. Off-street parking was a huge bonus, and was easy to figure out. Thanks!!"
5992032,46211339,2015-09-08,42622530,Samantha,"Shiva was a wonderful host from the beginning.  My friends and I went to Seattle for a weekend retreat and loved exploring the area. Shiva's home is very cozy and we felt at home as soon as we walked in the door. There is a very cute front patio that is secluded from the street. It was a wonderful place to relax and drink coffee in the morning. He provided everything we could have needed, and even though he was out of service during our stay we always had someone available to answer our questions. His apartment is in a wonderful location and was only a short bus ride from downtown. We loved our time in Seattle and I would definitely stay there again. "

3528627,15735172,2014-07-14,17889445,Amy,Lyn was a great hostess!  Very kind and not too into our business.  The room is very close to Discovery Park where we spent a 1/2 day exploring.  We could also get into downtown or Ballard very quickly and easily from this location.
3528627,16578887,2014-07-29,3132439,Li-Ou,"Great, quiet neighbourhood. Lyn did everything to make me comfortable, and Charlie her golden retriever was a sweetheart.
I had a very peaceful stay - which was all I needed."
3528627,18546517,2014-08-28,10936501,Arno,"Lyn Coffin has been much more than a marvelous host -- she has become a friend!  She not only made me feel at home, but welcomed my family and puppy to stay at her home as well.  She let me use her car while she was away, and even drove us to places we needed to be on a couple of occasions.  I couldn't recommend her place more highly.

The apartment was very comfortable, overlooked the Kiwanis Ravine, and was only a block away from Discovery Park!  The neighborhood is a pleasure to walk around in and the Magnolia farmer's market on Saturdays had great food and organic produce.  The Metropolitan Market on 34th has everything we needed for food; otherwise we'd take a (car or long walking) trip down to McGraw to eat at Nikos Gyros or some of the other restaurants in that area."
3528627,18776449,2014-08-31,20529056,Jenna,"Lyn and her adorable dog Charlie were wonderful hosts and made us feel right at home! Lovely neighborhood and beautiful park just a block away. Overall, great experience."
3528627,18866189,2014-09-01,9743225,Ken,One night stay. Lyn was friendly and respectful.  Room was clean and walking distance to a busline.  She has a dog named Charlie who was also nice and well behaved. Quiet safe neighborhood with easy parking. 20-30 min bus ride to downtown Seattle.  Would recommend to friends/stay here again. Thanks Lyn!
3528627,23353495,2014-11-29,20698532,Cornelia,"This is my second stay at Lyn's place. I have spent over a month at her place when moving to Seattle. Lynn was very welcoming and uncomplicated and made my stay very comforting. Lyn is a Poet, which makes conversation even more interesting. The room is neat, it has of course bed, but also a closet, bedside table, bookshelf, reading chair and a desk. When it was still warm the balcony was a great plus. Its beautiful especially when it's raining, you can hear the rain on the leaves;-). Wonderful was also the location close by the discovery park, certainly a place to check out.
There was always street parking close by and there are two buses that go to downtown directly. Well all in all I had a great time and would like to thank Lyn agin for having me!"
3528627,35373295,2015-06-18,29877821,Jun-Yan,"If you want to get disturbed everyday, have no privacy, get insulted and bothered even after moving out. BOOK this room!

Here is our story.
My girlfriend and I stayed in Lyn’s place for a month. We had a terrible experience as she kept insulting us from the beginning to the end. I have never wrote a single review to any website, and I also understand the review philosophy here is ""If you don’t have anything nice to say, don’t say anything at all.”  But I have to write this one thanks to the enough disrespect we received during our stay.
 
1. **No** lock on our room and Lyn **entered** our room without permission for more than once by taking the excuse of checking out our cat.
 
2.  Lyn **yelled** and **heavily knocked** on the bathroom door while my girlfriend was taking her shower just because she didn't come out of the bathroom immediately while there were soap all over her, and that was not more than 5 minutes.
 
3. Poor Wifi: Even with the new router, signal was still too weak so that we had to use our phones’ cellular data for Skype meeting.
 
If what is stated above made us angry, what happened after we moved out was totally disgusting. Lyn accused us of “stealing” her door key, and router. Later she realized we had **nothing** to do with these stuff, and apologized. Still, we are thinking about taking legal action to defend.
 
Door Key-- Lyn gave us only one key to the door at the first day and it’s a copy. But one day after we left, she said she gave us the original key and we gave her back a copy. We had never made a copy and it was she that gave us the copy. Nevertheless, we took no fight back but just a simple clarification message because my grandma, the same age as she, is also forgetful.

Router--Three days later, Lyn requested us $90 through airbnb because she “discovered that the new router had been removed, and the old one reinstalled” and she thought we did that and took the new router with us. This is basically an **accusation of theft** because no one can “accidentally” remove/reinstall the routers. We were still using the new router during our last minute's stay. How come she found out the new router had been removed and the old one had been reinstalled *several days* after we left?  Later she cancelled the request, and apologized to us “I now know what happened to the router and it was nothing to do with you or her.”

Her dog was nice though.
 
Just think about it!"
3528627,35528874,2015-06-19,35933571,Jase,"Lyn is a very nice, welcoming, and helpful woman, and her room is great. The balcony in the room offers a beautiful view, and the room itself is very tidy and comfortable. She has many books about the city and recommended some places for me to visit. Overall a very positive experience!"
3528627,35740181,2015-06-21,29733199,Keeley,Lyn made us feel very comfortable and welcome in her home. The space was just what we needed as a base camp for exploring Seattle! 
3528627,35991582,2015-06-23,36310721,Marina,"My overall experience is not really good.
Pros:
-Good location, close to the bus stop
-Lyn was nice and her dog is nice too
Cons:
-The bathroom was nasty. I stay a lot at the campsites and I've never seen such a dirty bathroom even there
-The flat wasn't very clean too
-No wifi"
3528627,36230746,2015-06-26,7106413,Ronald,"Lyn was nice and helpful with information for the Magnolia and downtown area. Her place is in a quiet neighborhood with reasonable access/parking. We didn't get much time to visit but in those moments, we found that she is very nice and is easy to share conversation with. Thanks for hosting us Lyn."
3528627,36460832,2015-06-28,36146641,Valentina,"The host was very nice and give us advices about things to see in town, that otherwise are not well known. 
We feel like home in her house, also her dog was very friendly.
Magnolia is a quite quiet neighborhood , not too far from downtown , downtown it's also easy to reach by bus , there is a bus stop near the apartment. "
3528627,36992622,2015-07-03,9740042,Morgan,"Lyn was a great hostess and very knowledgable about Seattle and surrounding sites to see. She is kind and accommodating, we had a lovely week staying with her while searching for permanent housing.

Also, her golden retriever Charlie is the cutest!!"
3528627,37090864,2015-07-04,17719219,Mike,"Lyn was very nice, welcoming, and flexible about check-in. The apartment was in a walkable area to most points of interest in Seattle for us. The bathroom was not the cleanest - not dirty at all but there is a big (sweet) dog who seems to have pretty full reign of the apartment. He sleeps in the bathroom so it smells a bit of wet dog in there, but otherwise the place was fine. The balcony is beautiful, great light especially in the morning. While the room is private, Lyn sleeps in the living room and the apartment is quite small so it doesn't feel super private. Overall, I think for the location and price, it's a nice place to stay."
3528627,37519567,2015-07-07,25394994,Tiago,"Lyn was a nice and welcoming host. She also gave some good recommendations. The room was good and had a balcony with an awesome view. The apartment was quiet and cozy
My cons are that the apartment could be cleaner and the mattress for the futon is not comfortable. There are a couple of buses that go downtown but to go other places, a car/uber is recommended "
3528627,38606434,2015-07-17,33752337,Xavier," I can't say enough good things about our stay with Lyn. This listing is a total win. The visit was fantastic. Lyn made us feel at home with a clean , comfortable room, and privacy. She was even kind enough to let us bring our toddler, which isn't as common on Airbnb as I would have hoped. She welcomed us to the kitchen area and the main balcony area. Our room had a balcony with a really cool view of greenery. We really enjoyed ending our evenings at Lyns. From the cleanliness of the bathroom, you wouldn't be able to tell another person was there. The ad was accurate to the T. Being in the Magnolia Area, one block from discovery park, I really don't think you could get a better deal than this listing. The value was tremendous. Lyn gave us plenty of space with just enough interaction to give us tips on the city and gift us treats to snack on. The apartment is cozy and on a dead end which is really nice. It was  quiet and felt very safe."
3528627,39303166,2015-07-22,626760,Daniel,"Lynn is very friendly and interesting with a super-cute 11 year old dog that brought me his favorite rabbit! The room is basic, simple, but adequate with an awesome deck overlooking an overgrown ravine - excellent for the soul. Even better, it's right next to Discovery Park, the best/biggest in central Seattle. There's a 2.5 mile jogging loop and some of the best views of the Sound."
3528627,39927490,2015-07-27,17566264,Peter,"Lyn was the perfect host. Engaging when I wanted intelligent conversation and almost invisible the rest of the time.  It was as if I had the entire place to myself. 
My room turned out to be perfect with a balcony that put me into the tree tops, filtered light gave it a quiet peaceful feeling.   It was like living in a tree house.  It was very comfortable and  felt at home immediately. Best BnB I've been to."
3528627,48163382,2015-09-24,2939655,Matt,"Lyn exceeded every standard of an Airbnb host. My girlfriend and I planned on staying in Seattle for a month, but unfortunately a last-minute injury derailed our plans. Lyn was exceptionally gracious and accommodating, and I'm glad I got to spend at least a few days at her cozy home. The room, balcony, and location were all fantastic. I loved taking the bus downtown and walking to the Ballard locks.

Lyn, thank you for your overwhelming kindness and warm welcome to Seattle!"
3528627,52570048,2015-10-31,35228867,Benjamin,"Lyn is a wonderful and caring host. I immediately felt welcome. The room is very neatly decorated - you actually do feel like in a tree house. With discovery park being just five minutes away, this is a perfect location for people who enjoy nature.

I am incredibly thankful, that Lyn (and her dog Charlie) made my first few weeks in Seattle very special."
6794702,47407165,2015-09-18,699829,Sylvia,"Nick was new to hosting, he was attentive and appreciated our feedback, a lot of which he immediately implemented. Nice space which felt a bit like a cabin. Though it is located on a main street, it is facing the back wirh a garden abd oark behind it and is quiet. Short walk to RapidRide bus stop (C line), stores and the Junction with plenty of great stores, restaurants and coffee shops. "
6794702,48035394,2015-09-22,40730424,Danielle,Our stay here was great! The pictures don't do the home justice. It is actually very spacious and decorated lovely. It is also located very close to the downtown area of West Seattle so it was perfect when we wanted to grab some food or go to a bar. 
6794702,52846301,2015-11-02,44336165,Grace,"We stayed here for about a month as we moved from out of state and were transitioning. Nick was a great host and the house was comfortable and had all of the comforts of home. It really was like a little cabin with the wooded setting. While it is located on a heavily traveled street having the entrance in the back made it feel more private and secluded. It is walkable to a Trader Joe's, the Rapid C Line as well as Walgreens, and beautiful trails. I would recommend staying here! Additionally it as great views of the city just down the street! "
6794702,56742587,2015-12-17,9680014,Taylor,"Clean, Comfortable, and in a great location. Outside was great, I watched the sunrise from the backyard, there's a nice view and a nice relaxing place to sit and with a fish pond. "
6626493,36827326,2015-07-01,36388287,Jonathan,"I can only hope all future airbnb experiences equal this one. Edward made us feel welcome into his home, but gave us all the privacy and independence we sought. Even though the airline bumped us to a very late arrival, Edward stayed up and made sure we arrived safely. I would  not hesitate to recommend him as a guest or host.

The location itself was quite nice for my girlfriend and I to enjoy Seattle as it was a short drive to downtown (without traffic) and very easy to get back to at night after a days' worth of exploring.

The room met all of our requirements and some that we didn't expect. He's equipped the place with a kitchenette that is perfect if you prefer to eat breakfast in before starting your day. There is a separate access to the backyard seen in the picture which we used to enjoy a nice beer at the end of the day. The decorations were sparse, but we liked that since it meant we didn't have to worry about accidentally knocking over/breaking someone else's souvenirs.

Stay here and enjoy Seattle. I do not think you will be disappointed with your choice. My only hesitation in leaving this review is that I am worried I won't be able to stay there in the future due to it being perpetually full, and deservedly so. "
6626493,38325394,2015-07-14,37078061,Mary,"My boyfriend and I stayed at this wonderful studio. Edward made us feel welcomed. This place was accurately described. Modern, clean, and nice decor. Even though he lived on top of the studio, the small noises didnt bother us at all! My boyfriend's family lives in Seattle and hotel prices can be expensive. We felt this place was like a 4 star hotel  without the price. It was our first time using this website and we are happy to say we will definitely choose this studio again. "
6626493,39411773,2015-07-23,24560508,Nicholas,"My experience staying at Edward's was fantastic!  His place was exactly as described, and was the perfect private studio for myself while I stayed in Seattle for eight days.  Upon arrival, Edward greeted me and showed me around.  He even provided some tea and coffee that I made every morning with breakfast.  Edward was a really nice host, and would check in every once in a while to make sure that I had everything I needed and felt right at home.  I am planning to move to Seattle soon and would definitely stay another week at Edward's while I look for an apartment of my own."
6626493,39963092,2015-07-27,17428424,Robb,Let us know that he is around if I we needed anything. Let us park our car inside his garage. Kept us feeling like we are a priority for our stay.
6626493,41626822,2015-08-08,36898688,Andrew,"Edward was fantastic and helpful and the place we rented was absolutely amazing. It was clean, well-stocked, and it felt like we were living at a resort during the duration of our stay."
6626493,43075320,2015-08-17,37459974,Natalie,"Edward made us feel very welcome. This studio was quiet, and plenty close enough to Seattle to get any sightseeing done easily. We loved staying here, we only wish we had more time!"
6626493,43690917,2015-08-21,22179838,Davinci,"Edward was a super nice host! Possibly the best Airbnb experience I have had so far. 

His place was very modern, clean, and well-maintained. I think Edward's thought of everything in terms of amenities -- there's a few snacks, ramen, and waters, as well as a Keurig. It's a little kitchenette, but if I think you're traveling or out most of the time it's enough.

Edward himself is as accommodating a host as they come. You don't even need a key technically, as there's a code and he's available as much as you need him to be. He was super nice to check in on us every so often! Even for small noises (when he was up watching tv), he was very considerate in checking if it was too much noise!

This place is such a great value and I would recommend anyone to stay here if they're visiting short-term or long term. It feels like an entire home, but in the form of a studio. "
6626493,44147926,2015-08-24,29603317,Edwin,Edward was very welcoming and the whole place was super clean. The house was not facing the street so it's a little more difficult to find but it wasn't a big deal. All amenities looked brand new and the room was very comfortable. Standout feature was Edward's towels... They were crazy soft. 
6626493,47990359,2015-09-22,41182887,Robert,"Excellent overall experience in a quiet neighborhood. Edward was very accommodating.

"
6626493,49543735,2015-10-04,24424380,Jungho,The place was truly charming and cozy. Room was very spacious and the bed was comfortable. Ed was one of the best hosts that I've ever seen. He was very thoughtful and generous  to his guests. I highly recommend this place!
6626493,51618596,2015-10-22,42345860,Makoto,"Very clean and comfortable room.
Accommodations were well maintained and Mr. Ed always cared about me, very good host.

There aren't supermarket or grocery store near there. So if you don't have a car, it may be a little inconvenient for long stay there.

However, it's pretty sure that this room was great!"
6626493,52287371,2015-10-27,29686623,Vida,"If you don't like a place that is: very clean, comfortable, secure, great location, great hospitality, with super convenient access to the city, then this place is not for you. The garage parking, keyless entry, beautiful decor and inviting patio sealed the deal. Ed was a great host and although he is new to the area, he did the research and provided information on how to get around and points of interest. His house information folder answered all our questions. The ""how's it going text messages"" were a nice touch. My guy is totally enamored with Ed and the offer of beer didn’t hurt. We will be using his place in the future if he welcomes us again. Cheers, Vida & Stan."
6626493,54453280,2015-11-20,44076194,Roman,"Edward's accommodation is cool, clean, suitable for one or two people, has everything you need to stay.  The house is new, has a new modern facility, wifi, terrace, garage, which you can use. Access to downtown is easy and fast, you must to have a rental car. In my view, while the best accommodation within Airbnb in Seattle."
6626493,54899998,2015-11-25,45902930,Roberto,"Ed was a great host, with amazing communication since the beginning. His studio was very clean and organize on a quiet neighborhood with great location close to seattle/downtown. He explain us how to access the studio and helped us find the apartment as well. Great experience, and will recommend to anyone. "
6626493,57037407,2015-12-21,40395997,Thomas,"The place was great--just as described. Cute, spacious, and private. Ed was also a great host-- he had stocked the fridge with some snacks, which was really nice, and provided a great little guide to local stores and such. He was really welcoming and checked in with is via text every other day or so to make sure all was going well. He also advised us to rent a car, which was really useful advice and made getting around town much easier!"
7574864,55351652,2015-12-01,8924549,Maureen,"Greenlake Getaway is a beautifully decorated, comfortable, spotless modern home in a great neighborhood.  The home has a very warm,  comfortable feel with a spacious, modern kitchen great for cooking.  Due to the weather we did not use the outdoor space, but this is a very nice space. Josh and Joanne were very accommodating in allowing us to check in early.  There are a couple of things that should be addressed for future guests.  One is the AV system. The AV system is not at all user friendly, the WIFI did not work well and we had a difficult time throughout our stay getting TV stations.  The listing says 4 bedrooms / accommodates 8.  There are 4 bedrooms but one is set up as an office without a bed.  "
1204142,4930975,2013-06-02,165485,Tirza,Terrific apartment in a great location.  Our stay was easy and delightful.  Thank you so much!
1204142,4958245,2013-06-03,6660800,Brendan,"This spot was absolutely fantastic.  The pictures don't even do it justice, it is basically a dream apartment.  I felt as though I was at home the whole time, especially with the cute little kitty.  The bathroom and shower were great as well.  I would definitely recommend staying here and hopefully will again really soon!"
1204142,6186236,2013-08-02,2772528,Tamara,"Our stay was perfect. Perfect location, perfect local espresso bar, perfect reception and perfect cozy and inviting domicile after a long day of travel.  Thanks to you both for making our short time in Seattle memorable"
1204142,6200615,2013-08-03,7418136,Chad,We were returning from the San Juan Islands and wanted to stay on Capitol Hill for our final night in Seattle. Susanna was courteous and responsive making check-in/out easy. We had also been away from our pets for over a week and getting our feline fix was greatly appreciated as well (Nappers is a cool little guy).
1204142,6225833,2013-08-04,3891734,Marie,"We really enjoyed staying at Susanna and Ricki's apartment! It is a true gem, filled with character. The old building is beautiful and the location couldn't have been better. Nappers is an incredible cat - so affectionate and sweet. Great place if you are in Seattle and want to explore the neighborhood. "
1204142,7042519,2013-09-04,4587762,Mikey,"Beautiful old apartment in fantastic CapHill. Clean, quite, easy arrival and great food nearby! Definitely staying here next time we're up."
1204142,7371803,2013-09-17,8261424,Jodi,We had such a great time in this beautiful apartment! This location is perfect and kitty nappers is so sweet! I would stay here again in a heart beat. 3
1204142,7537911,2013-09-23,1339123,Sarah,"Lovely Space, amazing location.  We had a great time!  I highly recommend staying here. I just wish my schedule would have allowed more time to explore the neighborhood."
1204142,7669582,2013-09-29,2230493,Andrew,Awesome stay!  The apartment was in the center of it all in Capitol Hill and I would highly recommend anyone stay there.  Super clean.  
1204142,7702900,2013-09-30,1148270,John,"We loved our stay here - we got to Susanna and Ricki's apartment on a gray and rainy afternoon and spent a good part of it laying on the bed with Nappers and listening to jazz records.  Just perfect..

We didn't use the kitchen while we were there but the bed was comfy and the claw foot bathtub was divine.  Nappers is an unbelievably sweet and friendly cat - we briefly considered putting him into our luggage and taking him home but that would have caused many problems..  Thanks for making our weekend away ever so much more homey and perfect!"
1204142,8115658,2013-10-16,2832148,Greg,"we actually never got to meet s & r in person as they were out of town, but their friend, elby, met us at our arrival & was available to us whenever we had questions.  the building was pretty, apt was  described as charming, which it was.  a lovely part about air bnb is getting a sense of who you're renting from.   nappers, their cat, was a little snuggler and watching him slip out his window was a hoot. the location was great, steps from bus line, several shops, pubs, restaurants.  our hosts had continental breakfast stuff available coffee, teas, cereal, half n half,  the only drawback was the apt. was kind of chilly--we're floridians & sandra weighs about 97 pounds, so she had to stay bundled up whenever we were inside."
1204142,8329745,2013-10-26,5535084,Anna,Had a lovely stay in Capitol Hill with great company from Nappers! Charming building and loved walking around the neighborhood. It was super easy to pick up the keys from Elby and loved just being able to text once we were close 
1204142,8379332,2013-10-28,156103,Alan,"Had a brief stay here but it was great! The hosts were away so we had the place to ourselves (after picking up keys from Elby), well not exactly, the exceedingly sweet Nappers the Cat was there as well and helped keep things cozy. Rad decor and perfectly situated in cap hill, would come back in a heartbeat."
1204142,8495232,2013-11-02,3872760,Tony,I did not stay here
1204142,8976333,2013-11-29,9777080,Sara,"Wow, what an amazing place! The location was great. The apartment had tons of character, was clean and warm on a cold night. The cat was so sweet. Communication was easy even though we booked close to the last minute and were arriving during a holiday week. We had a terrific stay - wish we could have stayed longer and will definitely stay here again when we come through town."
1204142,9431494,2013-12-28,10535884,Kelvi,The apartment was awesome! Thank you so much for sharing it.  A great place in a beautiful building in a great location; I'll definitely be back. I love your style. We made good use of the record player and Nappers was a lovely addition.
1204142,9449779,2013-12-29,5705165,Pam,Great location. We were able to walk downtown. Clean and comfortable. Quiet neighborhood. Nappers was a great host!
1204142,9508477,2013-12-31,10723605,Christina,"Susanna and Ricki's place is unbelievably charming and comfortable! With its chic, vintage decor, it looks like an apartment that would be featured in a magazine. Full of filtered light, it's very cozy and has a fantastic location in the heart of Capitol Hill. We walked everywhere and never had to take a cab. My husband and I especially loved cuddling with Nappers, friendly kitty extraordinaire (hubs: ""why can't your cats be cool like this?""). We can't wait to come back to Seattle again next year and stay here! "
1204142,9610404,2014-01-03,10476524,Andrew,"Our stay was wonderful! Location was great, Nappers the cat was very friendly, and the apartment cute and cozy. We would definitely stay there again."
1204142,9715975,2014-01-06,8597299,Iris,Great funky Seattle pad in a perfect location. We had a blast and Nappers is very nice.
1204142,9889373,2014-01-17,10783185,Robert,"Great stay!!
The place was spotless. Everything was as advertised.
Nappers was a great addition. Slept in the bed and always welcomed me when I came in.I felt guilty leaving him!
Fun neighborhood with cafes and eats, all in walking distance. 
Elby was (email hidden) plane was delayed 2 hours but was there with the keys.
The apt. was a bit chilly at times as the heat is controlled by the building. As I was visiting Phoenix and Seattle was a last minute detour, I only had T-shirts :)
The apartment had oodles of charm and was soooo quiet!
And that bed! Wow...so comfortable.
I cant wait to visit Seattle (website hidden) me an excuse to stay in the apt. again and get my ""Nappers fix""."
1204142,9919630,2014-01-19,12713,Rovaira,Beautiful place!  Wonderfully cozy and gets nice and toasty when the heater comes on (automatically set by the building).  The location is absolutely perfect.  I still miss the resident kitty.
1204142,10020085,2014-01-26,997691,Debra,Great location!  Easy walk to restaurants and groceries.  We enjoy walking so we didn't need a car to go any where in the city.  Check in with Elby was very easy and Nappers was a very friendly host.  We would stay here again.
1204142,10080496,2014-01-29,10962608,Molly,"Huge, neat and clean space with fabulous decor and an incredibly cuddly cat. Climb into bed (or even just sit down), and Nappers is there and ready to snuggle. Great dining and drinking just steps away. Convenient access to bus lines and an easy walk downtown."
1204142,10663344,2014-03-02,7598384,Elizabeth,"This adorable apartment was such a pleasure to stay in and the location was perfect.  There was nothing better than coming back from a long day of sightseeing to take a relaxing bath in the tub.  Nappers is a friendly, cuddly host and my boyfriend and I could not have enjoyed staying there anymore.  Thanks Susanna and Ricki!"
1204142,10801937,2014-03-08,416657,Jimmy,"This place is fantastic! It's super cozy, well-appointed, extrememly convenient to both grocery shopping AND cocktails AND Vivace coffee's espresso stand. The building is really warm and inviting. The apartment is really spacious. Parking is a little difficult (but was never impossible in our 4 days there). You don't really need a car if you're staying here; it's in the center of Capitol Hill. The key exchange was seamless and our host was rock-solid responsive and caring. Really great place!"
1204142,11060587,2014-03-18,11054513,Susan,"Our stay at Suzanne/Ricki was great! I have to say bed is uber comfortable! Overall inside us cozy and the cat (Napper) is adorable :) Their place is right in Cap Hill...close to many restaurants and  shopping. If you have a car, parking can be a challenge but not difficult. Would def stay here again. Thanks!"
1204142,11213225,2014-03-25,2017335,Katariina,"I stayed in Susanna and Ricki's lovely apartment for a week while attending a conference in Seattle. It was absolutely perfect and really beautiful, lots of light, spacious, spotlessly clean, and filled with fun details. I arrived very jetlagged and was so grateful to find some food and coffee available for guests, not having to head out right away. The kitchen had everything one would desire for cooking and fixing breakfast. They say that the bed is unbelievably comfortable and it's SO TRUE, I never slept better, it forms after your body! Nappers might have had something to do with it too, cuddling up right away whenever I went to bed. There's no limit to how long this incredibly cuddly kitty can just sit in your lap and purr away! No television, but who needs it when there are lovely old records to listen to, great WiFi and their guidebook for restaurants, shopping and bars was spot on for me. You might wanna take some warms clothes with if you come during the colder months, it was a bit chilly inside at times, but I didn't mind. I loved walking around the neighborhood and Broadway, it's lively and felt safe. My conference was downtown at the Sheraton and it was an easy 20 minute walk or 10 minutes by bus, which was convenient too. If (and hopefully when) I come back to Seattle I'd stay in this place again in a heartbeat! "
1204142,11450391,2014-04-03,6915012,Rosana,"Great location - with lots of close options for restaurants, shopping, public transportation. The building is beautiful, and the apartment itself was large and charming with cool vintage decor. The bed was comfortable and cozy - helping me to gets lots of needed rest. Thanks again to Susanna, Ricki, Jody and of course the handsome Nappers!"
1204142,12062988,2014-04-22,4600044,Karlie,"Great location in a gorgeous building in Capitol Hill just off Broadway! Tons of restaurants, stores, coffee shops and everything else you could need steps away. There is a full grocery store a couple of blocks away which is a huge bonus. There is also a bus stop very close by.

The apartment has tons of character and is decorated in flawless vintage style. It reminds me of my grandmother's house in a good way. Every detail is just so. Beautiful furniture. No TV, no microwave, no phone. Love the record player. The claw foot bathtub is awesome. Nappers the cat is a real cutie, too. He will come right up to you and snuggle on your lap. 

The bed is AMAZINGLY COMFORTABLE. I thought my bed at home was as soft as a cloud, but this bed is luxurious. 

The apartment was rather on the chilly side as the heating cannot be controlled in the unit, so be prepared and bring PJ pants and a hoodie for lounging around. Perhaps a couple of little space heaters would warm things up. 

They were easy to communicate with before our stay, and Jody was very nice when we checked in with her. Would stay again!"
1204142,12476348,2014-05-03,235863,Jordan,"As all the other reviews will tell you, Susanna and Ricki's place is in the perfect location on the hill and they are excellent hosts. Super easy to communicate with and everything went very smoothly for my 2 night stay. I'm going to miss hanging out with Nappers the cat! Would definitely stay here again."
1204142,12612139,2014-05-06,4138045,Becca,"Perfect Airbnb! Clean, comfortable, and close to everything. Nappers is the icing on the cake - what an amazing feeling to come home to all that affection! Can't imagine staying anywhere else on future trips."
1204142,12822905,2014-05-12,13123087,Erin,"We traveled to Seattle to get married as there is still a constitutional banned here in TN.The planning was fairly last minute, so we were lucky to find this perfect apartment, in the perfect neighborhood.

Firstly Jody was awesome!!! She accommodated our super late arrival and was very easy to communicate with. 

Susanna and Ricki's apartment has all the comforts of home, but is a true experience with its vintage charm. When you walk up the steps of the building in you feel like you've stepped back in time. The size and amenities were perfect for our week long stay. The bed was incredible luxurious and the linens provided matched it's lush feel. The Dressing Table was a treat while getting ready everyday and the giant tub was just beautiful. The kitchen was well equipped with everything you could need.

Nappers is a doll baby! He is the most loving kitty we have ever encountered! He snuggled right in with us and made us feel right at home with him. We'll sure miss the little guy. 

The apartment is literally a block down from everything you need- shopping, dining, coffee, and a huge grocery store. 

Parking- Ugh Seattle parking!!! Totally not anything to do with this great property, but it is sticky (not impossible but sticky). We rented a car because we were married in Ballard. If you intend to just stay in the city we recommend relying on the car share services to see any sights or navigating the public transit. 

Thank you for the amazing stay!!! We would stay again in a heart beat. "
1204142,12964805,2014-05-15,15195134,Elena,"Talk about the fabulous life of Susanna and Ricki!  The fiber glass lamps, velvet couch, the spanish oil painting, the record collection, the giant art deco vanity with the best make-up lighting etc….. We were in vintage mid century modern heaven. Besides all of the kitschy awesomeness, the neighborhood was great-breakfast at Lost Lake diner, late night drinks at bleu bistro, lunch at the Odd Fellow's Cafe (the kale salad is amazing!) All within short walking distance. My favorite part? Snuggling up on the couch with Nappers listening to vince Guaraldi. I miss my dogs like crazy when I am away so Napper's was the perfect little kitty man to make me feel better. We loved everything about Susanna and Ricki's place, it was perfect for us,  we highly recommend it!"
1204142,13066738,2014-05-19,1157828,Sarah,"My wife and I had a wonderful stay with Nappers as our charming host. The apartment is beautifully decorated and very comfortable, and having a cuddly cat is a great added bonus. We also really enjoyed being able to easily walk to all areas of interest downtown, and having the Broadway East neighborhood steps away for morning coffee and dinner after a long day. We would definitely stay again."
1204142,13221417,2014-05-22,1482399,Anton,"We never got to meet these fabulous ladies but by the looks of their wigs and costumes, they are fabulous. The apartment is charming and there is no end to its fascinating decorations. Nappers the cat is very friendly and mostly stays out of your business. He likes to be pet, but still has his claws so beware of quick movements and don't rub his belly.

The apartment is in a cool old building with old school push-button light switches and lots of greenery around. The neighborhood is fun with plenty of eateries, bars, and entertainment."
1204142,13341609,2014-05-26,7406162,Garrett,"We had a lovely time staying at Susanna and Ricki's home. The location was exactly what we were looking for -- right in the heart of what seemed to be the coolest neighborhood in Seattle, easy access to public transit and a quick walk to pretty much everything we could ask for. The building is beautiful and well kept, while the apartment itself is full of tons of vintage charm, comfortable furniture and closets full of burlesque clothing and props! Communication with our contact Judy was never a problem. Nappers the cat was a lovable little guy -- if anything, a little too lovable at times, as we had to kick him out of the bedroom because he purred on our heads while we tried to fall asleep. He also did get a bit scratchy a few times, but I think he was just in need of a good nail trimming. Our only other minor complaints are that we would have liked to have access to a linen closet with a few extra towels. Also, we thought the wood floors could have used a good scrubbing -- it was generally clean overall but seemed like it was time for a bit deeper cleanse. All in all, we would highly recommend the place!"
1204142,13555658,2014-05-30,1549454,Chris,"Place was awesome! Would certainly recommended it, especially to cat lovers! "
1204142,14045351,2014-06-10,15323089,Madeleine,"The location was great- less than a 2 minute walk to shops and restaurants and a reasonable length walk to the downtown area as well. We only stayed 2 nights and did not meet the hosts except for the little cat who slept on the bed the whole time. The apartment was clean, big and pretty comfortable. The only thing we found difficult was the lack of parking in the area. "
1204142,15010390,2014-06-30,254342,Brian,"OMG we had a wonderful time staying in Capital Hill area, but what made it special was staying at Kitten and Lou's place especially when their picture was on all front cover of Seattle magazine when we walking around enjoying the sights. This is a delightful, early 20th century apartment with decor to match. The bed was soft and cozy for two, the bathroom's clawed tub brought back the past, and the living room LP player created the necessary background music for one to get lost in the elaborate time travel to the past. We loved playing ABBA and enjoying a glass of wine at the end of day. I feel honoured you let us stay in your placing enjoy your unique taste of life.  Oh and your local contact was very good at ensuring we found the place and that we got settled in ok. BTW Nappers the Cat is a delight but your right - don't touch is belly. "
1204142,15456189,2014-07-09,2640182,Kendal,"Susanna and Ricki's place was perfect for our stay in Seattle. My boyfriend and I loved it. The location is amazing as there is lots going on in Capitol Hill, lots to see and do and anything you need is close by. It's also very easy to get around anywhere else you may want to go. The street the apartment is on is beautiful and quiet. The apartment building itself is an amazing old brick building with vines growing all over it and is very beautiful and well maintained. The apartment is so cute and uniquely decorated, you sort of feel like your going back in time in a good way. It was clean and had everything we needed and the bed is unreal comfortable :). I can't forget to mention the kitty, Nappers. We fell in love with him and it was so nice to come home from seeing the sights in Seattle and getting to hang out with that cuddly guy. He will definitely be missed. I highly recommend Susanna and Ricki's apartment in Capitol Hill. We had such a great time in Seattle and are definitely looking forward to returning one day :) "
1204142,16287899,2014-07-25,12301505,Dominic,"Honestly, I don't think we could have had better lodging for the wedding. It was quiet, homey, and had everything we needed. And we absolutely count Nappers as an amenity. Such a friendly cat! loves sitting right up in your face, all the time."
1204142,16455991,2014-07-28,4013939,Holly,"Susanna and Ricki's place was absolutely perfect. The apartment was clean and cozy, very comfortable bed, and Nappers the cat was super affectionate.  
My girlfriend and I were in town for a wedding and wanted a few extra days to explore, so we loved that we could walk anywhere in Capitol Hill from their apartment. And, their guidebook was full of awesome recommendations. Very fast and cheap ($5-6) drive to downtown - we used Uber and were really pleased with it. We had no problems at all, and are already talking about how we can come back next summer! Would definitely stay here again."
1204142,16673698,2014-07-31,17531416,Eugenio & Cynthia,"My wife and I truly enjoyed our stay at Susanna and Ricki's place! The location was great, the apartment had everything we needed, it was truly a pleasure. The feel and vibe of the apartment as well as the neighborhood would make any Seattle tourist green with envy at not having experienced the true Seattle. We would definitely stay here again."
1204142,16822425,2014-08-03,13194548,James,"If you want an authentic Seattle experience, this is the place to stay.  What a beautiful, off-kilter apartment in the heart of Capitol Hill.  The place is way cooler than the photos can relate.  The only downside is the parking.  If you have a rental, it must be moved every 2 hours in the neighborhood between 7am-6pm.  There is a parking lot just 3 blocks away that costs ~$28/day (not bad for Seattle).  Given there is no AC in most homes in Seattle, the windows are open during the summer which can lead to some outside noises interfering with sleep.  The first night we had crows screaming, the 2nd a crazy person screaming for a couple of hours--but ultimately, it was a very minor issue.  That's part of the joy in this neighborhood--you just don't know what to expect.  We will definitely stay here again in the future if our travel plans take us to Seattle.  I wish I could give Kitten and Lou a huge hug--I love you without ever having met you!"
1204142,17046191,2014-08-06,580374,Alyssa,"What a great stay! We did not get to meet Susanna and Ricki, but Jody was super sweet and easy to communicate with about our arrival and departure times. Their place has a lot of charm and is IDEALLY located. All the bus lines that run through the neighborhood made it super easy for us to get around all of Seattle. We found the guidebook super helpful (definitely go to the Wandering Goose for breakfast). And of course our feline host, Nappers, welcomed us with open paws. I think it took about 5 minutes for him to come sit on my lap. He definitely has a preferred side of the bed and has no qualms about getting up close and personal. You will get a good night's rest in their bed. The only thing that might keep you awake is Nappers trying to sleep on your chest ;) I'd highly recommend staying here if you want a quiet but still lively neighborhood that is convenient to many bus lines that can whisk you away to all the different neighborhoods. Thanks again!! "
1204142,17502931,2014-08-13,13747383,Robin,"A very charming  and romantic place; excellent bed, big bathtub. Witty decor and elegant black cat. Well equipped kitchen. Perfect location. 
Apartment is in an impressive old well maintained building. The key hand off to us was well arranged and friendly.
"
1204142,17831501,2014-08-18,8527524,Hannah,"The Apartment was easy to get to from the centre of Seattle. If we didn't have heavy bags we would have walked but instead we got $9 cab there. We were met by Jody who was very friendly and recommended a couple of Vegetarian restaurants for us. We tried both and they were amazing. My favourite was Cafe Flora.

The apartment itself is gorgeous and really cool. It was our first Air BnB experience and the two since then have been a disappointment because the standard was set so high by this place. The only thing that was difficult was getting used to Nappers, the cat, coming up on to the pillow while we slept and the occasional swipe of a claw if he didn't like how we were patting him.
 In terms of keeping the cat fed and watered that was very easy and although we were out for the entire day when we came back at night there was plenty left for him to eat and drink, so nothing to worry about there. There are laundry facilities in the building which is amazing and it was very sweet of the hosts to leave a tube of quarters for us if we needed to use it.

The area is amazing and from what we saw in Seattle I would say its the best area to stay in. There are amazing arcade bars, pool and bowling rooms, book shops, record shops and about 1000 coffee shops all very close.

I can't really see how Air BnB can get better than this."
1204142,18067129,2014-08-21,1486096,Jessica,"Location was great! A block from a main road full of restaurants and a bus line that takes you straight into town (bus tickets $2.50).
Apartment was good and was what we needed. We enjoyed Nappers the cat and his company. Check in check out was easy. Communication with Jody was great. 
Parking was a bit of a hassle. Parking is 2 hours only between 7am - 6pm. There is however paid parking one block down from the apartment for you future comers. 
"
1204142,18320884,2014-08-25,12077107,Mary Kate,"The apartment is wonderful, clean, spacious, and well-equipped. It is located on a quiet street a block away from a fantastic commercial area, and manageable walking distance from downtown. We absolutely loved the place, as well as the adorable cat. Our one complaint is that the person who manages the apartment was very slow to respond to emails and phone calls both before we arrived and while we were staying. This made logistics a little more challenging, but would not deter us from wanting to stay again!"
1204142,18786655,2014-09-01,4002406,Hans,"Susanna's and Ricki's apt is a nice place in a great neighborhood in Seattle. An excellent apt to hang out in although you'll have to take good-old Nappers (the cat) into account. Although very independent, he needs some attention and can be a bit unpredictable."
1204142,18948111,2014-09-03,5191661,Chris,"We had a great stay at Susanna and Ricki’s place. The apartment was clean and cozy, and the bed was very comfortable. I appreciated the beautiful vine covered exterior and the funky décor of the interior. The location was perfect and in walking distance to many coffee shops, restaurants, and bars. Also Nappers the cat was friendly and fun to cuddle with. I would definitely recommend this Airbnb and stay here again!"
1204142,19039541,2014-09-05,4540321,Dave,"My stay couldn't have been more perfect, I felt like I got the quintessential Seattle experience.  The apartment is located in a quiet tree-lined nook just steps from Broadway with all its shops and restaurants, yet close enough to Downtown to be walking distance away. A beautiful vintage interior with coffered ceilings and built-in cabinetry.  The claw-foot tub was a super bonus, and the friendly resident kitty cat makes you feel you welcome and at home!"
1204142,19415054,2014-09-12,4475370,Jonas,"Very cute apartment, as described in listing. Excellent location. Overall very easy experience, good value."

1204142,20486903,2014-09-30,12772498,John,"The apartment was exactly as photographed and described. Neighborhood was great. Jody (standing in for Ricki and Susanna) met up with us and gave us the key with no troubles. 

Our stay was mostly excellent and I would recommend staying here. A couple of things worth mentioning though: 

Parking in the neighborhood can be tricky, but we made it work. Many of the zones around the (email hidden) zones. I'm not sure how strictly these are enforced... 

The hot water in the building was inconsistent. We only had two properly hot showers in the four days we were there. Not sure why it was sometimes just warm instead of hot. 

Lastly, we stayed in late September and the weather was turning cold. The apartment doesn't get much sun. The building's heat doesn't turn on until Oct 1st. So we were quite cold in the apartment. Jody was standing in for Ricki and Susanna, so there was a delay in getting a solution for us. We eventually bought a space heater and Ricki reimbursed us for it. We were satisfied with the solution.  "
1204142,20838112,2014-10-06,20911221,Autumn,"The location was ideal and the apartment itself was beautiful!  We had a great time playing with the cat, but found it a bit difficult because he didn't like being moved, which created a problem at bedtime.  Other than that, it was a really great experience!"
1204142,21002360,2014-10-09,4645644,Jon,"The listing was accurate. The host was very accommodating to my schedule, and was right on time to let me in. The place was clean and set up for a nice stay.

The neighborhood (Capitol Hill) is my favorite part of Seattle.

The apartment is awesome! I love the decorations, the building is beautiful, and the house cat is the best cat ever."

1204142,21277187,2014-10-14,4144714,Yoko,"We had a lovely time staying here. The building has all of the awesome charm of a vintage mansion and is wonderfully maintained as advertised. The apartment is classic and classy, like a multi-room boudoir with plenty of natural light. The neighborhood is also great: to the west is a small strip of Main Street-esque restaurants and stores; to the east and north there are a ton of cute restaurants and bars. Kim, our listing liaison, was lovely and accommodating even when we were running a bit late getting in. Plus, of course, there is the cat. Nappers is so loving—be ready for him to sit on your belly any chance he gets!—but he is very low-maintenance. The place itself is already great enough to warrant another stay, but I would return just for Nappers. Thanks for having us!"
1204142,22585656,2014-11-10,414775,Amanda,"Charming space in an unbeatable location but the highlight was Nappers. He's got so much personality (purrsonality?) and is a great host. My mornings would involve waking up in that comfortable bed, opening the curtains of a few of the many windows, taking a tiny walk over to the Vivace coffee stand around the corner to get an earl grey latte, and then hanging out with Nappers reading the news. The building itself is really lovely and the neighborhood was surprisingly quiet considering how close it is to so many restaurants, cafes, etc. It also felt very safe. Checking in was a simple process and there were clear instructions available re: wifi, radiator heat, and whatever else you might wonder about. Overall, a very positive experience. Thank you for sharing your beautiful home and sweet cat!"
1204142,24979503,2015-01-04,9088622,Bianca,"Susanna and Ricki's home was everything we expected and more. The apt. was super charming, and we definitely grew attached to Nappers the cat. He is a sweet little cat and it was sad to say goodbye to him! Micah, who managed the apt. while Susanna/Ricki were gone was very accommodating and made the key transaction easy. He was also quick to reply via text if we had any random questions about the (website hidden): location, it was very convenient, which made it easy to walk to downtown and close to a lot of nightlife/great restaurants. I will say parking is a bit of a challenge. For those that are driving, definitely keep in mind it's usually 2 hour parking Mon - Friday in the area during biz hours and can be tricky to find a spot. I believe there is paid parking nearby, but not positive where.

As Susanna and Ricki noted in their description, it is a quaint but old building. We live in an old building too, so we're used to the quirks an old building has. FYI, the water does get hot, but just be super patient with it since they are old pipes :)

All in all, it was a really great experience and we would definitely stay here again."
1204142,26776796,2015-02-19,6999814,Curtis,The neighborhood was awesome and Nappers was the perfect cuddle buddy for our stay in Seattle. There wasn't much need to drive or get a cab because we could walk to all the tastiest spots! Would definitely stay again. 
1204142,27066641,2015-02-24,27296046,Alexis,"Micah was our contact and was not only friendly, but made our check-in easy and efficient.

The location is fantastic: walking proximity to lots of great places to eat (8 oz Burger, Old School Frozen Custard, etc.), and a few minutes from a 24-hour, well-stocked grocery store.   The neighbourhood felt very safe, and my partner and I had no concerns whilst we walked the streets and explored the area - even at night!

If you enjoy walking, downtown Seattle (Pike Place Market) was a mere 20-25 minute walk, which allowed us to appreciate Seattle, and helped to exercise off all the delicious and amazing food we ate.

Nappers was very affectionate, and low-maintenance.

Thank-you Susanna and Ricki for sharing your home with us!  It was a treat to come back to a 'home away from home' after a day of walking, eating, and exploring!"
1204142,27398911,2015-03-03,11950614,Hubert,"Susanna and Ricki were very thorough with their guidance and apartment usage instructions. It helped that they had their friend and neighbor, Micah, greet me upon my arrival. Add on the cuddliest cat I've met in some time and you've got a happy traveler!

Capitol Hill is pretty nice. Everything needed to sustain is within walking distance. The restaurant and shopping options were impressive. As someone who is considering a move, the area definitely did a good job of selling itself to me."
1204142,28089993,2015-03-17,13824966,Hannah,Perfect apartment in the perfect location! Everything was as listed and Micah was a pleasure to work with. Nappers was the delight of the whole stay and the neighborhood was beautiful. Would definitely recommend (:

"
1204142,29545760,2015-04-09,26316534,Richard & Lynn,"Caretaker met us at the door with keys & showed us what we needed to know. As our hosts advised it would be, the apt. was a little on the cool side (1st week of April).
Plenty of breakfast items in kitchen: yogurt, eggs, whole-grain bread, butter, jam, etc. Not equipped for much cooking.
Funky charm consistent with the neighborhood. Nice block on quiet, shady street 2 blocks from shopping, cafés, restaurants & several bus lines minutes from downtown.
Nappers the cat craves contact. He will jump on your lap & join you in bed if you let him, which we did."
1204142,29826189,2015-04-13,1592335,Anthony,"Staying with Susanna and Ricki was awesome!  They (and Micah) were super responsive and accommodating the entire trip and we really couldn't have asked for better hosts.  Check-in was a breeze and their apartment was amazing.  It was in a great, quiet neighborhood but was still only a block away from Broadway and in the heart of Capitol Hill.   We really loved everything about the apartment and it was so nice to have a place to relax after wandering the city.  And most importantly of all... NAPPERS!  Greatest. Cat. Ever.  Just don't sit or lay down or you won't be going anywhere for a while -- do not underestimate this cat's love of cuddling.  If you ever get a chance to stay with Susanna and Ricki don't hesitate, you won't regret it."
1204142,29989684,2015-04-15,7859528,Amelia,"This place is great! Beautiful vintage building in a great neighborhood. Super central but also has plenty of street parking. Micah, the contact person is super friendly as well. And,  oh yeah, the cat is fantastic."
1204142,30383218,2015-04-21,2393061,Teresa,Susanna and Ricki have a beautiful home with tons of charm and a super sweet cat. It's a 20 minute walk to the downtown core and the Capitol Hill area is awesome.
1204142,30998504,2015-04-30,206203,Amanda,Susanna and Ricki's place is very centrally located with easy access to Capital Hill and Downtown. You won't need a car and in fact it is best not to have one as parking is a challenge. The place is cozy and the cat chummy. It can get chilly but overall it was a comfortable stay. 
1204142,31746413,2015-05-09,60279,Deborah,"Of all the great things about the apartment, Nappers (the cat) was our favorite! One of the nicest places we've ever stayed. "
1204142,31907606,2015-05-11,855527,Mike,"Lovely apartment in a fantastic location. We had a blast staying here. Also, the cat is *extremely* friendly, so be ready for him to cuddle up with you as you're lounging around the apartment."
1204142,32116659,2015-05-14,5451579,Yuko,"Susanna and Ricki's place was absolutely fantastic.  Decor was eclectic but very homely, and Nappers the cat warmed up to us immediately and was an excellent companion during our stay.  
Being a block away from Broadway, everything (grocery store, gym, restaurants and bars, banks..) was very accessible.
We had a very comfortable stay here."

Great apartment, just as advertised, comfortable, spotless, cozy, and in a simply perfect location in Capitol Hill. Can't wait to stay there again!"
1204142,33236184,2015-05-26,7693200,Diane,Very spacious and comfortable. We had a great time.
1204142,34094310,2015-06-04,34266244,Jonathan,"I had a great time staying here. The neighborhood was great; it was quiet and there was a great coffee/breakfast spot on the corner of the block. The apartment was very comfortable and accurately described. Nappers the cat was my constant companion while I was there, he was very friendly and affectionate. "
1204142,34316358,2015-06-07,32619581,Kelly,"This was my first time using airbnb and it was absolutely perfect.  From the arrival to our departure, everything at Susanna and Ricki's spot was ideal. 

The space is gorgeous, is incredibly comfortable, and has everything you could need.  

My boyfriend and I both had to work two of the days we were there, and the apartment couldn't have suited us better.  The internet was fast and the tea pot and available tea came in handy.

Additionally, the location is seriously incredible. You're about 50 steps from Vivace (fantastic coffee spot on the sidewalk), along with the rest of what Capitol Hill has to offer. You're about a 15-minute walk from bars/food in the Pike/Pine area, and about a 15-minute walk from Volunteer Park. For never having visited Seattle before, we were beyond pleased with the location.

Finally, Nappers the cat, what a phenomenal addition. We have many memories from him (and scratches, as he does scratch if he feels the need to, which seemed to be mostly if he was on you and you wanted him off of you). He is SUCH a character and made us laugh endlessly. Miss you already, pal.

100% recommend to anyone looking for a trip to Seattle."
1204142,34637453,2015-06-10,13027982,Kay,"The apartment stay was very pleasant.  The apartment was clean and comfortable.    The best part is the great location - close to so many amenities and an interesting/fun neighborhood .  Communication ahead of time was very prompt, and the key pickup was also timely.  This apartment is definitely recommended.   The cat is  very friendly and easy to take care of.       The only caveat for this apartment is that parking is very challenging in this area.  If you aren't using a car, no problem, as it's close to   public transportation  and close to amenities.  If you have a car, however, you will need to  plan for extra time as nearby parking is predominantly restricted parking.  Thanks for the stay!   The review is based on my husband's feedback, as I wasn't able to join him at the last minute due to out of town guests arriving.

The apartment was exactly as advertised - very homey, clean and well equipped, with the exception of no TV, which was fine with us.  We appreciated the breakfast treats and French press coffee. Nappers is quite a friendly cat and was fun to come home to. Checking in and out was a breeze. As for the neighborhood, it is conveniently located and felt safe but is a touch on the noisy side - you can hear people and traffic moving around outside and the planes taking off from SeaTac. This is to be expected in a more urban neighborhood but might be an issue if you are used to sleeping in a noise free zone.  "
1204142,38702866,2015-07-18,7555051,Jessi,"AWESOME LOCATION! The neighborhood is quiet, safe, and within walking distance of some of the best restaurants, bars, Pike Place, shops, etc. We didn't have a car and it wasn't a problem at all. The building itself is very old, but obviously well cared for. So while you can definitely hear the occasional creak of floorboards upstairs, it's a beautiful place with lots of charm and character. (And I'm a sucker for old architecture, so I thought it was great.) Micah was very helpful and we had no issues during our stay.

Susanna and Ricki's place is so much fun. They have some fantastic art and a very interesting book collection. Everything was clean, the bed was comfy, and the kitchen stocked with fresh fruit, eggs, and almond milk was a really nice bonus. There is no AC, but there is a fan in the bedroom window which kept it perfectly cool at night even in mid July. 

NAPPERS THE CAT: 
Oh, Nappers... When other reviews say he is very friendly they mean he wants to be next to you ALL THE TIME. I've never seen a cat take so quickly to total strangers and it was adorable. But on the first night we made the mistake of letting him cuddle with us in bed, and when we were ready to call it a night he was NOT going to be removed (and I got a good scratch for trying). We ended up letting him stay but didn't get much sleep with little kitty facetoface with us all night purring like a maniac. The rest of our stay we just made sure to close the bedroom door well before bedtime, and other than a few bouts of loud meowing he was fine. 

Also make sure to keep an eye on your food around him. He gets in and out of the apartment through the window above the kitchen counter, and one night when I was cooking I turned around to find him licking away at a fresh prawn I had on the cutting board. My bad, but be prepared for that. He's really very sweet though and it was nice to have a cuddle buddy when I was missing my own kitties at home. 

All in all, awesome place! Really feels like the ""heart of Seattle"". We fell in love with the city and can't wait to come back!"
1204142,39031547,2015-07-20,9830394,Vanessa,"This apartment was in a great location to both local Capital Hill spots and the more touristy sections are about 30 min by walk.  The apartment is beautiful, so much character and well maintained.  Definitely recommend."
1204142,39901424,2015-07-27,26780202,Tom,"The apartment really made us feel like we were living in Seattle.  The location was excellent.   Just close enough to downtown to walk, but part of a great neighbourhood.  Breakfast at nearby Glo's was excellent, and the grocery store just steps away had everything we needed.

The space was very roomy, and the decor was quirky but very tasteful.  We'd love to return."
1204142,40539818,2015-07-31,25201135,Karl,"Great location to lots of restaurants and bars on the hill.  Loved the architecture, made us feel like we stepped back in time!  "
1204142,41061834,2015-08-04,29505816,Alexa,We enjoyed our time at this apartment. It's in a great neighborhood which makes walking to different areas of town easy. It's got fun and vintage decor and is spacious. It was unseasonably warm in Seattle at the moment which made the old apartment building a bit hot. There are plenty of windows to let in fresh air though. Nappers made our trip interesting. He's a character and loved to cuddle. 
1204142,41392784,2015-08-07,28739203,Sally,"Fantastic apartment - well located and equipped with everything you could want. Levi was very helpful and we really appreciated him letting us in late at night and helping carry our bags! Nappers was a brilliant companion for our stay, he is amazingly friendly and doesn't ever want you to stop making a fuss of him."
1204142,42821869,2015-08-16,29962524,Matthew,"Checking in was easy, and Levi was flexible with the check-in time.  The apartment has a very cool vibe, and I enjoyed my stay there a lot.  Nappers is incredibly friendly and will absolutely cuddle with you if given half the chance."
1204142,43903631,2015-08-23,3940398,Erin,"Wonderful old building!  The apartment itself is spacious and charming.  It's got a vintage, kitschy feel that clearly reflects the hosts.  The location is fantastic, in a vibrant neighborhood full of shops and restaurants, and within an easy drive of most anything you want to do in Seattle.  We would absolutely stay here again.

"
1204142,44642382,2015-08-28,35213781,Gregory,We had a fantastic time. The apartment is quirky and in great location . It was the perfect place to just chill out after long days of tourist stuff and Nappers was a great companion.
1204142,46261200,2015-09-09,2626233,Jen,"We just loved staying at Susanna and Ricki's home! Levi was very prompt and attentive, even though we checked in late at night. The home itself is funky and cool but still very comfortable and clean. Also, the bed is suuuuuuper comfortable, so good luck trying to wake up. 
The building is a great historic one that comes with all the creaks and groans of a cool historic grand dame. 
The neighborhood is fun- lots of great restaurants and bars and a quick 20 minute walk to downtown Seattle.
We would absolutely recommend staying here and would most definitely book again!"
1204142,48542185,2015-09-27,30596566,Ashlee,"Our stay here was wonderful! The neighborhood was lovely, the apartment was exactly as described, and it was the perfect way to finish up our trip to Seattle. "
1204142,49130458,2015-10-01,42216022,Laura,"Really fun place, and fantastic location for getting around Seattle, both for touring and for work. Had some work up in the U District, and getting to/from there was very easy, and the proximity to buses was great.

Check-in/out process was super easy and we felt right at home once we got in!

The cat was not feeling well during our stay, so we didn't see him, but we hear he is awesome.
"
1204142,50229763,2015-10-10,18063103,Jason,Wonderful house! Great location in middle of everything! Only down side is no designated parking if you're driving or have a car. Street parking is easy enough to find just have to worry about 2 hour time limits. 
1204142,51250741,2015-10-18,33272,William,"Accurate listing, great location central to lots of bars and restaurants, supermarket, etc. Very comfortable bed. So much better than staying in a hotel. Very easy check in/out. 
Didn't meet you ladies, but thanks for the hospitality. "
1204142,52364561,2015-10-28,4905127,Toetsie,"Oh the charm the charm the CHARM of this great place! I loved it, I totally recharged my battery in this older house with such great style furnished and equipped.. Thanks for sharing dear couple!

I liked to stay here because i wanted to attend a show at Neumos, and thats walking distance.. all worked out perfect..!"
7806698,50871514,2015-10-15,37432647,Ignacio,The check in was seamless and we enjoyed thoroughly our stay at the apartment. We were a party of five with plenty of space for each. Also we used the washer and dryer to get some clothes clean for the test of the trip. 
7806698,52283971,2015-10-27,23459528,Edgar,"Overall pretty accurate description of the property.  Walked everywhere easily; few minutes to Pike Place Market!  The property was clean and very nice.  There was a nice little welcome package waiting for us when we arrived with popcorn, snacks and coffee.  The street towards the water is fairly busy and you can hear the traffic starting early in the morning.

For some reason the check-in instructions were not emailed to me at time of booking but was quickly remedied with a quick phone call.  The instructions were slightly difficult to follow for obtaining the keys but once the proper areas were found everything was good.

A 3rd party manages this property and I was called at one point during the trip saying I didn't pay; they quickly looked up Airbnb and realized it was their mistake.  They also called me a 2nd time saying I parked in the wrong spot.  When I cut my dinner short to verify parking, it was in the appropriate spot and they apologized without a good explanation.  This was slightly bothersome but my trip and stay was still satisfactory."
7806698,54435775,2015-11-20,19344239,Mike,"I highly recommend this place! Stay Alfred is well organized and made for a great trip. The location is terrific! Close to Pike Place, minutes from the Space Needle, and within walking distance to some great restaurants. The amenities in the place are well thought out and welcoming. The decor is fresh and new. The view is spectacular! I would definitely stay here again."
7805491,42496264,2015-08-13,16100076,Sierra,"Easy place to crash if you're exploring a new city. Felicity was friendly and knowledgable about local nightlife. The pullout was setup already when we got there which made us feel right at home. Very clean place with a sweet cat and great balcony, and the key system made it easy to come and go without bothering our host. Overall highly recommended! "
7805491,43877906,2015-08-22,38604376,Suzu,"We stayed here for one night; it was relaxing and quiet. Even though we slept in the living room, it felt more private than that, because the only other person in the house is Felicity, who was mostly in her own room. She was comfortable to speak with, and made herself available for any help. Thank you for a good experience!"
7805491,44741005,2015-08-28,5361543,Kim,"Felicity made us feel very welcome, pull out couch was comfortable. It was easy to get in and out of the apartment and a short walk to many bars and restaurants :) Balcony patio was a nice place to sit and chill. We booked this stay last minute and it ended up working out great! "
7805491,45154738,2015-08-31,3553389,Justin,"We only stayed for one night and did not see Felicity, but the process of getting in and out was no problem.  The space was nice and clean and within easy walking distance of good restaurants in Fremont.  Happy to stay."
7805491,46305301,2015-09-09,36887873,Tayler,Super cute place! Right next to a ton of fun shops and cafes. Felicity was very helpful with directions and suggestions on places to go. 
7805491,46989229,2015-09-14,26638161,Lindsey,Felicity's apartment worked perfectly for our short 1-night stay: great location with easy check-in and access to apartment.
7805491,48806207,2015-09-28,21427968,Matthew,"She had great suggestions for places to visit. The Fremont neighborhood was just what we were looking for outside the inner city but was close enough to hit all the places we wanted to visit downtown. Nice decoration, cozy, and clean. We would recommend staying with Felicity. "
4526737,33692023,2015-05-31,31948021,Nykia,"I stayed at Joe and Theresa’s place for a month and it was wonderful. This was my first time using Airbnb, so I was a little nervous at first, but the place is even more beautiful than it appears in the photos. 

Joe and Theresa are both very kind and friendly. Joe welcomed me at the door, and gave me a tour of the property and the apartment. They had everything ready when I arrived (including a fruit, cheese and wine). They gave great recommendations about places to dine, sightsee, and hike, and there is a trail leading to a park right behind the property, which makes it feel like you are in the country, even though you’re right in the city. 

The apartment is fully furnished, with every amenity available (laundry, cable, internet, dishes, pots/pans, etc.), and it has one of the most comfortable beds that I have slept on in a long time. They were very respectful of privacy, and yet readily available to answer any questions (Joe can give directions to just about anyplace in Washington). Overall, I couldn’t have wished for a better experience, and I would definitely recommend their place to fellow travelers. Thank you Joe and Theresa for such a great time!"
4526737,34792653,2015-06-12,33210583,Nihar,Joe and Theresa are very warm and helpful hosts.  It was really a very homely experience.  It was like a home away from home.  Joe is extremely helpful and friendly.  Great experience
4526737,35222258,2015-06-16,2243362,Deepak,The host couple were waiting for us and were extremely helpful in making us comfortably settled. Joe kept asking if he could do anything else to help out. This newly furnished apt was like a an art gallery with all the wall space filled with paintings. The neighborhood was very quiet. There was no access to lake.
4526737,35406661,2015-06-18,34551291,Michael,"This is a great place to stay !! We were welcomed by our host ( Joe) who went out of his way to make sure we were comfortable. The place was better than described and with more amenities. The scenery, nearby park was fantastic. "
4526737,36391316,2015-06-28,32297538,Valerie,"We were in Seattle, a place we visit often, for a family wedding, and the the hotels we usually stay in were very expensive due to a PGA tour in the area.  This was the first time we used Airbnb so we were a little nervous, but it was all for nought.  The apt was truly as advertised and the photos were spot-on; however, it was so much more than the description or the photos.  It really had everything and the most amazing thing was, if something was missing, Joe went out and bought it!  The funniest thing we saw was when we got ""home"" one day, there was a potato peeler on the patio table.  Someone before us was looking for one, so Joe went out and got it!  One thing not mentioned much in the description is the patio area.  It was truly wonderful!  Joe does an amazing job landscaping and the property was gorgeous.  I always had my morning coffee on the patio and it was great!  
As for the hosts, Joe & Theresa were great!  They were there to welcome us with wine and beer.  Joe showed us around the apt.  They were very friendly and went out of their way to provide anything we needed from places to visit, restaurants, directions and general area information.  We're always interested in the day-to-day lives of the locals and Joe was a great source of information and never seemed bothered by all the questions.  In fact, I probably talked his ears off while he was busy working around the yard, yet he always took the time to explain.  
There was a heat wave while we were there and Joe was very concerned we would be too warm.  He brought in fans to make us more comfortable.  In fact, the whole time we were there, he was always asking if we needed anything.
My husband says it best:  it was perfect!"
4526737,37054693,2015-07-04,16537965,Mimi,"We loved staying with Theresa and Joe in Seattle! The apartment is immaculate, very well-appointed, in a lovely neighborhood -- everything we were looking for. Both hosts are very friendly and knowledgeable about the area, having grown up in Seattle. We had great conversations and they were very attentive to our needs, while also being respectful of our privacy. The kitchen was perfect for making meals, which saved a lot of money. The nearby PCC coop has great fresh produce and everything we needed. We would return to Theresa and Joe's place in a heartbeat!"
4526737,45923386,2015-09-07,1101821,Jana,"Joe & Theresa are the absolutely BEST hosts on Airbnb!! Couldn't do any more to make me feel welcome, almost family! Always smiling Joe is there to do anything for you! 
I'd pick this place to stay anytime I'm in Seattle! But I bought a small condo and now get to come visit as a friend. 
Beautiful furnishings, everything you could need for a short or long term stay like mine. Really nice to have a washer & dryer and now (thanks Joe) a full length mirror. Lovely private patio, art on walls and gorgeous oriental rugs, makes you just stay home! 
I'm sure you'll find Joe & Theresa sharing a glass of wine or homemade latte and helping you navigate wherever your travels take you! Super place, super people, now my friends!
Hugs, Jana"
4526737,46450526,2015-09-10,42864124,Ben,Joe and Theresa were so nice. The location was wonderful and the Airbnb was one of the best I have ever used. Highly recomended
4526737,48278912,2015-09-25,38866215,Kamille,"We couldn't have asked for better hosts. From the moment we got there, Theresa and Joe were very welcoming and informative on where everything was. Joe had awesome recommendations for restaurants, places to visit/sight see, and provided an excellent home for us for the week that included pretty much anything we needed. They made our first time in Seattle a memorable one. When my boyfriend and I come back to visit Washington, we'll be sure to stay with Theresa and Joe again! :)"
4526737,48760955,2015-09-28,3728258,Jessica,"Our experience at Joe and Theresa's house was beyond expectation! The space was absolutely beautiful and fully stocked with everything we could ever need or want. The garden was stellar, the path to Pritchard Beach was great to walk in the morning, and the location was perfect. I would definitely stay with Theresa and Joe again. They were magnificent hosts!"
4526737,50360619,2015-10-11,44593676,Justin,It was great. Joe and Theresa were very helpful with getting to know the area. I was up there for a job interview and it couldn't have been a better experience. 
4526737,51360243,2015-10-19,39913079,Wayne,"Joe was very nice and accomidating. The space was imaculate and had everything you might possibly want for a nice quiet weekend. The apartment and the yard were filled with art and beauty and everything just makes you want to sit down and enjoy a cup of coffee and read a book. Joe supplied whole coffee beans/grinder/coffee pot and they served up fantaitic coffee each morning. Thanks Joe!!

I would recommend this location to anyone that has a car and does not mind driving. This location is back behind neighborhoods tucked away on a quiet street, therefore there are not really any businesses within walking distance. If you have transportation, this is a wonderful place to stay."
4526737,52926417,2015-11-02,11018932,Stephen & Sara,"We had a great stay at Joe and Theresa's. Its just as described: quiet, peaceful and extremely comfortable. Check in & out was super easy.. Joe was very kind in showing us around and making sure we had everything we needed. We had our car so getting around was easy, but the light rail isn't that far away if you happen to be visiting without a car. All in all we had a fantastic stay and would highly recommend!"
4526737,54630450,2015-11-22,30941201,Kristoffer,"Upon arrival, Joe already chilled beer and a bottle of wine in the fridge waiting for us! He was very welcoming and made himself available if we needed anything at all. The apartment is beautifully decorated with various art pieces and an acute attention to detail. Unfortunately, we didn't have a chance to enjoy the outdoor patio area due to the weather however it would be an ideal way to enjoy breakfast in the morning. The apartment is also conveniently located near parks and grocery stores. I would high recommend staying here if you are looking for a nice quiet retreat in the southend of Seattle!"
4526737,55929814,2015-12-07,44858878,Jonathan C.,"This is a great place to stay at! Was able to meet Joe and Theresa first thing upon my arrival. Joe gave me a quick tour of the place and they provided 2 Bottles of wine along with some beers in the fridge. Made the transition from moving from one coast to the other coast pretty easy.  The neighborhood is nice, quiet and safe. Restaurants and grocery stores are 5-8 minutes away (by car).  This location is right outside the city of Seattle so you will need to drive but not that far.  There are malls and additional restaurants 15 minutes south of this place.  SEATAC airport is 15-20 minutes away (depending on traffic, could take longer).  "
320704,895054,2012-01-31,607714,Natnaal,"I must say, my best Airbnb stay thus far. Jessie's place was very nice and it was just recently remodeled, so there is  new everything! Jessie did a great job designing the place and has a very artsy feel. There is a full kitchen, utensils, an office area, a bedroom, bathroom. She has a TV with hulu and Netflix, so you don't eve need cable (I hooked up my laptop to it using an HDMI cord). Jessie also left tea, beverages and everything else I needed during my stay. If you ever need them they are right upstairs or woking in their photography studio next door. The location is great, lot's of restaurants, coffee shops and nightlife nearby. Downtown Ballard, Fremont & the University District are nearby so you have a lot to do. Also the bed is very comfy!! The pictures are nice but this place has way more to offer than the pictures show, I guarantee you will enjoy it here. "
320704,934768,2012-02-20,1722642,Mystie,"Jessie's place was awesome! Easy to find, private and very clean. Perfect for a weekend get away. There were lots of stores and restaurants near by. We will definitely keep her place at the top for our next visit. "
320704,960294,2012-02-29,1775595,Teresita,"Jessie at the Redstone abode is a great communicator and all-around nice lady. She was quick to respond to all my emails and questions and when I had concerns she was very helpful.

The apartment is gorgeous, very clean, chic furnishings and nice little extras to let you know she appreciates your business. It is a basement apartment but the stairs to the basement are wide and there is a firm railing. It is well lit and you enter through a lovely courtyard (if you're lucky you might meet a very sweet pup!). The neighborhood is classic Seattle, close to cool neighborhood restaurants and bars, groceries and anything you might need.

I would definitely stay here again and suggest this place for all visiting friends and relatives."
320704,969941,2012-03-04,101612,Elise,Both Jessie and this place are great. Jessie was really helpful in locating good places to drink coffee and eat good food. The place is perfect--clean and well designed. Getting downtown from Phiney was easier than I thought--just 15 min on one bus. I would definitely stay here again when in Seattle and recommend others do the same.
320704,997561,2012-03-13,789443,Monika,"The apartment was great!  The location was perfect; close to restaurants, shops, good coffee and bars.  On-street parking was ample.  The little amenities (toiletries, Brita water filter, and towels/linens) were much appreciated!  I didn't use the TV while I was there, but the wifi was speedy and convenient.  Cell phone service was spotty when having conversations, but it was fine for texting.  The apartment is well-maintained and nicely designed.  I hope to be back the next time I am in Seattle."
320704,1023536,2012-03-20,154204,Debbie,"We loved the Redstone apartment.  It was tidy and quiet and had everything we needed for our stay.  The location was excellent for our Ballard adventures, and Jessie is an attentive hostess."
320704,1037358,2012-03-24,1841613,Bethy,"My boyfriend and I stayed here for 4 days and we didn't want to leave. We loved the location, Phinney Ridge is a beautiful neighborhood close to everything. We walked to 4 cafe's, 1 grocery store, 2 breakfast places, 1 pizza place, 2 cool bars. There is a ton more restaurants we didn't have the time to go to. The apt was clean, smelled great, fully furnished with everything we needed. It was such a dream vacation! We both felt lucky to have found Jessie's place and will for sure always book it for our future Seattle stays. Ten million star rating!"
320704,1077853,2012-04-03,1747031,Ashley,"This is a great apartment in fun hip neighborhood. Jesse has described her apartment just right. It is spacious, has all the amenities. It is within walking distance to Phinney Ridge which is a great area. Also, there was always parking right out front. I loved my stay at this apartment. "
320704,1090434,2012-04-06,1964729,Joanna,"Can't beat the location of this fantastic apartment. Everything you need is included - separate entrance, wifi, kitchen, tv (with Netflix), shower, and a comfy bed. Thank you for letting me stay in your lovely apartment Jessie! "
320704,1103004,2012-04-09,1552666,Cass,"The apartment is lovely.  It's very spacious and has a full kitchen.  I took away one ""star"" because I couldn't get cell phone reception, but that's no fault of the host.  Even with that limitation, I'd stay there again!"
320704,1128980,2012-04-14,2007989,Tony,"Our stay at Jessie's was more than we expected, so private, so close to public transport, supermarket, cafes, bars and retaurants.  Although we were out most days and only briefly had time with Jessie we found her to be very helpful and accommodating and happy to recommend places to go, things to do.  Jessie's description of the apartment was 'spot on'.  It was clean, comfortable and we enjoyed everything about it. Would highly recommend to anyone visiting Seattle - this is the place to stay.

"
320704,1143610,2012-04-17,675625,René,"Jess and Cass were incredibly gracious hosts even despite our locking ourselves out while they were out of town! Ugh! The Airbnber's nightmare! 

The apartment is pretty bright given that it's under ground and it's well thought out decor gives it an airy feel. They had wonderful amenities with the extra added touches to set them apart - like glasses in the freezer for a frosty beer and a nice log waiting to be burned in the fireplace. Very thoughtful!

Phinney Ridge is a delightful, funky little town with lots of cool restaurants within walking distance. I was surprised at how easy it was to find parking right near the house - bonus! 

I would highly recommend staying withi Jess and Cass if you get the chance. Very cool people indeed!"
320704,1164276,2012-04-22,2058494,Larry,"great apartment in a fantastic location, and Jessie is a very thoughtful and accommodating host.  Highly recommended!"
320704,1229938,2012-05-05,373340,Casey,"The Redstone digs are not to be missed.  I was in Seattle for work and stayed here for a week, and I would not have changed a thing.  The apartment is fantastically appointed and a great stay for anyone wanting to soak up the cool, funky Seattle neighborhoods.  The bed is incredibly comfortable, the area is fantastic, and the logistics couldn't have been easier.  Two enthusiastic thumbs up!"
320704,1399022,2012-06-02,2050386,Kim,"Had a great time staying at Jessie's place. It was clean and comfortable, and in a great location. Easy access to Greenlake and highway 99 for a straight shot downtown.  "
320704,1418721,2012-06-05,607714,Natnaal,I had a wonderful stay again at Jessie's place. Everything was great and enjoyed the Ballard area. I would definitely recommend it to anyone visiting Seattle. 
320704,1447787,2012-06-10,242203,Greg,"The apartment is super clean, tidy, stylish and spacious and its located in a nice neighbourhood uptown. There's lots of great restaurants (Gainsbourg was our fave), good coffee bars and a decent supermarket close by. We enjoyed our stay here as our base to explore Seattle. "
320704,1498309,2012-06-17,1315892,Timothy,"Jessie's place was amazing. Perfect location for my girlfriend and I to relax after exploring Seattle all day. The place is pristine and has an awesome vibe to it.  The neighborhood is nice and quaint with some fantastic little restaurants and coffee shops a short walk from the apartment. It was nice to have access to netflix and wifi on nights we wanted to stay in and re-energize for the next day.  If you are driving, the highways are close enough to make the journey downtown and elsewhere a piece of cake.  There is also plenty of space available on the street to park your vehicle. I would definitely recommend the apartment and I would totally stay there again on another visit to the city. Don't hesitate to book this place, it's worth it."
320704,1650369,2012-07-07,2622127,Melissa,Jessie and the place were great--very responsive and downright kind to me and my guest who stayed there.  What a great location and neighborhood and a wonderful apartment.
320704,1717065,2012-07-16,2104853,Mary,"Pictures did not do the apartment justice.  Though my first time in the city/state, I would have gladly spent more time at the house, curled up on the couch.  The bed was so soft, and the shower so hot, that I had trouble getting out of either.  Jessie was an amazing hostess, I could not have wished for better.  Aside from the amazing decor/cleanliness, the location was perfect for a quick (email hidden), a hot cup of coffee, or a yummy dinner, all just a few steps away.  I would recommend Jessie's house to anyone, and if I happen to venture back to Seattle area, I would love for her to have me again.  Thanks for everything!!!!!!"
320704,1774951,2012-07-23,413222,Sara & Rocky,"This place is super rad!! Great layout, lots of space, and Jessie was awesome.  We will DEFINITELY stay here again when we come back!!"
320704,1803529,2012-07-26,2350867,Bronwen,"Wow, this place was amazing! I could have moved in here...Jessie was a great host and I could not have asked for anything more staying here. Next time I'm in Seattle I will definitely try to stay here again. As another reviewer said, this place is so great you have to  make the effort to leave and see the sights!!"
320704,1834436,2012-07-30,1977686,Theresa,"A fantastic appt in a lovely neighborhood.  Jessie was a great host who showed us round the appt, gave us advice about where to get the bus, local shops and cafes etc.  the wi-fi was great especially as we had not long finished camping.  Would highly recommend."
320704,1999399,2012-08-16,287404,Bryant & Margaret,"We had a great stay at Jessie and Cassie's place.  It's an ideal location and within walking distance to shops, restaurants, and a market.  Easy access to downtown, Greenlake, and more.  The place is designed like a cool hotel and at a much better deal.   Highly recommended."
320704,2097562,2012-08-26,2327233,Malcolm,"We had a fantastic time staying with Jessie and Cassie! The apartment is exactly what the photos show. Neat, clean, and easy to get to. Downtown is a quick hop and the neighborhood was cool. The coffee shop down on the corner, Herkimer is the best. We will look forward to using Redstone Apt again!"
320704,2141052,2012-08-30,2488797,Kristin,"My husband and I stayed here on a visit to Seattle in late August and we really could not have had a better time.  Jessie has hosting down to an art.  She provided all the information we need to get to her place along with helpful tips about where to eat and how to get around.  The apartment was even better than pictured...very clean and very comfortable!  Phinney Ridge is a charming neighborhood with a nice market and lots of good restaurants, coffee shops, and bars.  We didn't rent a car and found it easy enough to get everywhere we wanted to go by bus or walking.  I would highly recommend a stay here if you are visiting Seattle!"
320704,2176395,2012-09-03,400363,Susan,"Clean, updated, comfortable, and stylish basement apartment in a great neighborhood location, very close to shops, gallerys and cafes. Plenty of on street parking. Great value!"
320704,2221717,2012-09-07,2953444,Adrienne,Jessie's place was absolutely perfect.  The neighborhood is great and close to downtown with a bus route at the end of the street that goes right into downtown.  I'll definitely want to stay here next time I visit Seattle.  I've already recommended their place to a few friends.  
320704,2248831,2012-09-10,3115227,Ethan,Fantastic place to stay.  Great neighborhood.  There are plenty of places to walk and getting around Seattle is very easy.  I highly recommend Jessie's apartment.  I hope to stay there again in the future.
320704,2358908,2012-09-21,332541,SuePy,"I had a lovely stay , and I , as well hope next Spring and Fall when I return I can find her apt,. available. I love the closeness to the busline , the market is great as is the coffee shop , ice cream parlor, and the pizzeria that is just up one block. i am a bit handicap after a broken ankle and I found her home blessed with good footing, sturdy railings and comforting out side lights. I had to give jessie a less star only because the phone connections were so spotty,and there were times i needed to get in touch w/ family. It is not her fault, but it did cause stress.
the place was lovely and i even had a fun experience baking cookies in her oven to give to my boyfriend .  "
320704,2481101,2012-10-02,2523621,Brian,"A beautiful apartment in an awesome neighbourhood.
As many have stated before the apartment has everything you could need to feel at home away from home.
Parking right outside the door and only a 15 minute drive from downtown Seattle.
Public transport on the doorstep and a large number of eateries and bars too.
As regular visitors to Seattle we will be back."
320704,2553347,2012-10-08,2587693,Geoff,I contacted Jessie at short notice and got a prompt reply. Although the place is a bit away from downtown there is a very good strip of bars and restaurants only a few minutes walk away. I went there a couple of nights and met some great locals. The apartment is absolutely gorgeous. Very spacious with everything you need. 
320704,2610494,2012-10-15,2147880,Amanda,"We stayed at Jessie's the 2nd week of October and it was perfect! Found the location to be ideal as we needed to be in all parts of Seattle on various days. Clean, safe and the neighborhood is awesome. Highly recommend it!"
320704,2674253,2012-10-21,3178456,Steven,"Jessie has a great little place for one or a close two people. Easy communications with Jessie and she has a comprehensive set of notes or house rules and offers useful suggestions for nearby coffee shops, restaurants, etc. Easy address to locate and arrangements for checking in and out were clear and accurate. Worth another visit for sure. "
320704,2862477,2012-11-12,1410371,Rob & Lauren,Jessie is a great host and the Apt is even better than advertised. it was really a great place to unwind during a very busy week. 
320704,3191191,2012-12-30,1634639,Stuart,"the place is very cute, well located and nicely decorated.  However, there were some serious shortcomings.  First, there was only one roll of toilet paper, no paper towels, no dish sponge and very little shampoo.  Since we were staying for a week we had to purchase these items ourselves.  Second, the fireplace did not work and made the apartment stink of smoke.  When we pointed this out to the landlord her response was that the prior occupants had no problem with the fireplace, implying we were at fault.  We had to buy candles to mask the smell.  Third, despite being told that Verizon users had good service in the apartment we could never make our phones work and had to stand outside in the wet and cold to make phone calls.  Fourth, we were told that she had a netflix and hulu accounts but every time we tried to use them we were asked for a password and of course we were not provided a password.  Finally, the kitchen was lacking basic goods such as salt and pepper.  Overall, we were very disappointed with our stay."
320704,3326821,2013-01-11,4299089,Kristina,"Great place, great host! Highly  recommended. "
320704,3403214,2013-01-23,3070188,Mark,"Awesome basement unit with daylight windows. Very well decorated, and finished. Great location with very easy access to downtown and all major parts of Seattle. Laundry machines available. Lots of cafes, grocery stores, and bars a block away. The only thing I can complain about was that the wifi was pretty slow. If you stay here and rely on internet to get any work done, walk down the street to Herkimer coffee. Thanks for the awesome stay, Jessie! We found a place during our stay and are now moving to Seattle. :)"
320704,3782146,2013-03-14,154442,Jed,"A great apartment in a fun location. Jessie was very communicative and the space was just as advertised. We had a great time and would recommend it to others. As mentioned by other guests, the cell reception isn't great, but that's a small issue. Overall, a really nice play to stay in Seattle."
320704,3985892,2013-04-01,5487989,Matt,"A clean & spacious 1-bedroom apt in a great neighborhood!  It's a basement apt but very well-lit and colorful and has small upper windows for air.  Comfy bed, kitchen area with everything.  I was on a writer's retreat so my favorite part was the handsome office with desk against the decorative barn wall.  A short walk to gorgeous Phinney Ridge where there's a slew of fun restaurants and coffee houses.  "
320704,4077820,2013-04-08,4118533,Kevin,"Jessie's place is super clean, well kept and tastefully furnished. It's also good on more particular things like nice soap, a place to hang your clothes and good heat & water pressure. I was impressed when I arrived to be within a few blocks of a street or two of local cafes, coffee houses & pubs. Made outgoing calls easily online in spite of the reception issues. Getting downtown by bus was easy. If you are there to explore the city but like being a part of the neighborhood, I'd recommend this place. Seattle has a bunch of adorable houses and Jessie's is one of them.   
"
320704,4494660,2013-05-08,3883828,Hugo,"How Seattle has changed! In So many wonderful ways. To start, Jessie's neighborhood is perfect. North Greenwood has so many nice restaurants and a two of the best coffee shops in all of Seattle(Herkimer being my favourite) You're a short bus ride from Downtown and a pleasant walk downhill to Fremont and Ballard which are so so nice. Jessie obviously has a lot of aesthetic taste as the place is so nice the pictures don't even do it justice. The bed is comfy, the couch cozy, and you have more space than you ever need at such an affordable price. We didn't use the full-kitchen but would have if we had been more disciplined about our money! Thanks so much! "
320704,4555373,2013-05-12,1181923,J & J,"Great location to many fun neighborhoods in SEA - easy street parking and access to public transport.  Comfy bed, good water pressure.  If you have AT&T you will not get coverage while in the unit (basement) so keep that in mind if you intend to work during your stay. "
320704,5101597,2013-06-12,6202865,Nick,"Jessie was wonderful. Adorable place, easy access to downtown an great food."
320704,5163766,2013-06-16,6357177,Portia,"The Redstone apartment was great - clean and spacious. Really awesome location if you are interested in checking our Seattle's real neighborhoods. Phinney Ridge is really cool and has awesome views on a clear day. Parking was super easy. The only downside was the spotty wi-fi and cell reception so this would not be an ideal place if you are trying to do some work, but otherwise a fantastic place and quite a deal."
320704,5248022,2013-06-20,6624543,Angie,"This was a wonderful place to stay! Couldn't have asked for a better accommodation during my time in Seattle. The pictures Jessie posts about her place don't even do it justice: so cozy, cute, clean, feels like home, and in a great area. Highly recommend!"
320704,5319169,2013-06-24,3302015,Paola,"Jessie's place has been my BEST experience with AirBnB!

We were in Seattle for 5 days and loved staying at her apartment. While it's not walking distance to downtown, it is only a bus-stop away and the route is lovely. 
The place is walking distance from great restaurants, coffee shops, super market & a lovely park where you can go walking/running. The street looks like out of a fairy tale: wonderfull front lawns, lovely colors, full of flowers... 

Before you arrive, Jessie shares a PDF document that has the full details of the house and restaurant recommendations. This was super helpful for us. 

It's located on a basement so it gets a bit cold (especially for us coming from the tropics!) but it gets heated instantly and is super comfortable. Everything is brand new, wonderful shower pressure, very equiped kitchen to cook whatever you want and a perfectly working wifi. 

If you are traveling to Seattle and want to live the full experience, this is definitely your best option. 

 "
320704,6147388,2013-08-01,5358984,Jesús,"Really good time in Jessie's house. The apartment was exactly as the pictures shows and she was a very nice host!  The neighborhood was amazing, the people was so nice and there is a big market 3 blocks from the house where you can find everything you need. There were very good bus connections to downtown and u-district as well.  My personal recommendations: don't miss to try Red Mill Burger, go to Greelake and if you like wine try Conde Valdemar (Spanish wine, you can buy it in the market near the house - Ken's Market)."
320704,6273978,2013-08-06,2560993,Catherine,"Jessie's apartment is aesthetically pleasing, very clean and very close to all of the lively amenities of Ballard and Phinney Ridge. I would be happy to stay here agin in the future."
320704,6486960,2013-08-14,892996,Nasreen,"Jessie's place was so wonderful; I fell in love with the area. And, Jessie was so easy to contact and pleasant. Her place was the first airbnb experience I had and I'm glad it was! Thanks, Jessie."
320704,6957238,2013-09-01,6385113,Sofi,"This is a great apartment! Super clean, super comfortable. 
There are a lot of really good restaurants and bars near by... Red Mill burgers are great! And there´s a farmers market that is open on the weekends just a couple of minutes away.
Jessie is really nice and helpful. 
I would totally recommend this apartment. "
320704,7068671,2013-09-05,5310679,Ku-Yi,We really like Jessie' apt. It's really cozy and the neighbors are friendly. The location is good. We really felt relaxed in this apt. We come back again when we traveling in Seattle.
320704,7555957,2013-09-24,8243327,Jeffrey,"Jessie's place is the cutest little BNB ever!  Although we were only there to sleep mostly, it was clean and very cozy.  The place was GREAT!  Thanks Jessie.  We will be back.  :)"
320704,7743368,2013-10-01,5757674,Dee,"My first time to Seattle, and first time using AirBNB and I was completely blown away with this apartment. It is exactly what the photos offer, and more! The place is comfortable, relaxing, clean, and splendidly fitted with funky decor art and features that make you feel right at home. The bed was to die for! So comfortable! The lounge area and kitchen had everything I needed for my stay and I appreciated having the study space, although I did most of my work lounging on the couch. The bar is a nice touch to the house, and although I did not partake in the beverages, it was nice to have the option to have a drink if I needed it. The location is excellent, with a few minutes up the road you arrive to an amazing organic market where I managed to pick up dinner several nights for under $10. I loved my stay at Jessies place and will recommend it to all of my NZ friends visiting here in future. Thank you so much for having me, Jessie"
320704,8133447,2013-10-17,3988916,James,"Great spot with all mod cons near to local bars, restaurants and coffee shops of Phinney. Jessie has put a lot of thought into the place making it a very comfortable spot to stay."
320704,8750300,2013-11-16,1619148,Deane,"My wife and I stayed in Jessie's apartment for a month during the fall and had a great time.  Other reviews have noted it is cozy, and it certainly is--but that doesn't mean it's small!  It is organized as a studio with the bedroom separated by a sliding partition, but that's probably to comply with the fire code, because the open floor plan is at least as big as a good-sized 1 bedroom apartment.  It is probably 700-800 sqft, and has plenty of storage space throughout the kitchen, bath, bedroom and other areas for whatever you might be carrying.  As stated, we were there for 1 month, but could have stayed indefinitely!

Other nice features which aren't obvious until you get there include an extra-wide range/oven (36"" instead of the typical 30""), plentiful on-street parking, a very soft and comfortable bed, lots of bright lighting options, fast & effective heaters, and a double-basin kitchen sink with a waste disposer.  There is excellent sound isolation between the apartment and the house above it.  PCC, the best organic grocery in Seattle is within walking distance (about 1km). The apartment was also very clean, and very recently remodeled, with many well-chosen, high-quality materials.  It is delightfully obvious that the designer had a great sense of both style and practicality.

We entertained many pairs of local friends at the apartment during our stay.  All commented favorably, and at least half also asked us to email them the AirBNB link.  So don't hesitate--if this apartment is available, jump on it!"
320704,11400049,2014-04-01,2862447,Youn,"If you're thinking from the pictures that this place is too good to be true, you'll be happy to hear that what you see is really what you get.  My husband and I stayed with Jessie for a month while looking for our own place to move into in Seattle.  Not only was it great to have a ""home base"" ready for us as soon as we arrived in town, but we found the apt to be beautiful, clean, and spacious.  Having access to Netflix was also a bonus that we thoroughly enjoyed ;)  The apt is also in a great location... walking distance to lots of cute stores, cafes, restaurants, bars, and buses going downtown... it didn't take long for us to fall in love with the neighborhood.  Our only discomfort came from having next to no cell phone reception in the apt.  But Jessie was pretty upfront about that and we found her to be responsive about anything else we may have needed during our stay.  We would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a place to stay while in Seattle. "
320704,13008851,2014-05-17,14367929,Markus,Had a great time at Jessie's place! Everything worked out well and the neighbourhood was great for our trip. Everything you might need really is within a very short walk.
320704,13570866,2014-05-31,13855942,Keith,"Everything one needs is within a brief walk: coffee, grub, groceries, and a major bus line. Yet this space is serene, quiet. Very private feeling; instantly felt like home. Fully stocked kitchen, soft bed, ample space. Well appointed and graciously provided.

Very rewarding maiden voyage into AirBNB land!"
320704,14277451,2014-06-16,4501913,Holly,"We had a great two week stay in Seattle and absolutely LOVED the neighbourhood. Greenwood has everything you need a few minutes away - grocery stores, bars and plenty of restaurants. 

Pros
- Fantastic neighbourhood
- Plenty of on-street parking
- Large oven and fridge/freezer
- Stylish furniture
- Great office space
- Great host communications

Cons
- Patchy wifi with no in-apartment router to reset when needed
- No cleaning supplies provided so it was tricky to keep the place clean for longer stays. The crumbs encouraged bugs.
- Lacking in general supplies: toilet roll, washing up liquid, oven tray, smoke detector

All in all - it's in a great location at a great price. Jessie was really accommodating when we asked to extend out stay before arrival. If you're looking for a great value apartment to use as a base for exploring Seattle this would be perfect. If you're looking to make somewhere a home whilst you visit for few weeks then perhaps not so much. 

Value and location was great, but some of the details did impact our stay in comparison to other Airbnb experiences. "
320704,15112765,2014-07-02,16502746,Jim,"The listing was accurate.  This is a great place to make a home base in Seattle.  Great neighborhood, close to where I used to live.  Jessie's place is awesome, private, cool and convenient.  We will stay there again when we visit the Emerald City."
320704,15377001,2014-07-07,6607317,Sylvia,"Fantastic place.  Roomy, modern and clean.  Nicely done. 

Ladies, bathroom lacks a plug to do your hair and there's no other mirror in the place.  Internet is dicey as mentioned.  My husbands Verizon Galaxy and laptop worked fine but my T-Mobile Ipad and  would not connect to the internet.    If you're high maintenance this may not be the place for you."
320704,15651071,2014-07-13,10285563,Christian,The pictures don't lie. The place is big and very well done. Coordinating everything was/is easy. Very professional. Great location. Tremendous value. 
320704,17155798,2014-08-08,12561,Diane,Great neighborhood and close to our son!  It was spacious and had all we need!
320704,17512409,2014-08-13,785806,Abbie,"This apartment was comfortable and for the price, it served us well while we visited Seattle! I do wish that it had some more natural light (it is actually in a basement so it is dark and has a few spiders) and that it was a bit closer to the popular parts of Ballard. We had trouble communicating with Jessie before our trip, and she actually avoided ever talking to us in person despite being home while we were there. In the past, I have had the most wonderfully welcoming and hospitable AirBnB hosts all around the world so the bar has been set quite high, and unfortunately, I can't say the same about this host. In the end, the apartment had what we needed, and it was much nicer than the other options that were available to us."
320704,18320916,2014-08-25,16432731,Kurt,Beautiful apartment with great style. The neighborhood was lovely and we had a wonderful time exploring. I know it sounds cliche but we felt right at home. Nothing bad to say. Highly recommended!
320704,18719884,2014-08-31,17454434,Bryan,"The apartment was very nice.  It was clean and spacious.  The bed was comfy. Jessie has this place looking very nice. 
The only issue we had was that the wi-fi signal was weak. This especially was an issue when trying to use the streaming apps on the tv.  Signal kept dropping and the video would stop. 
The neighborhood was very quiet and the bus stop was close by.  "
320704,20546514,2014-10-01,1680044,Nathaniel,Lovely place with an awesome style. Totally fell in love with the neighborhood too. 
320704,22358953,2014-11-04,15550972,Atsuko,"とても広く、快適なアパートメントでした。
ホストのキャスと直接会うことはありませんでしたが、メールで問い合わせるとすぐに対応してくれるので安心でした。とても気に入りました。"
320704,23014535,2014-11-20,22626931,Jennifer,"The basement apartment is beautiful and very spacious, although there is A lot of sound transfer from upstairs to the basement. The neighborhood is quiet and lovely. Easy bus trip to downtown. However there are no cleaning supplies(even dish soap or a broom) so for a longer stay this can be difficult. Wifi is weak and no cell service in apartment. "
320704,23606477,2014-12-06,6621873,Sławek,Neighborhood was nice and quite. Walking distance to everything and I mean everything. If you want to go downtown bus stop was a around the corner too. Cass was nice and very easy going. Her instructions were simple and to the point.
320704,26926792,2015-02-22,18097323,Stephanie,"The listing description was accurate; everything was as expected! The room is spacious and private. It's in the heart of Phinney Ridge and just a block and a half away from some great bars, restaurants and stores. Was able to meet Cass and she was super friendly and accomodating. Highly recommended. Only minor complaint is that I'm a fairly sensitive sleeper and woke up a couple times due to noises upstairs, but Netflix kept me company when it needed to. Speaking of connection to the outside world, I have AT&T and had no reception. Verizon seemed to work. Overall, clean, comfy and cozy!"
320704,33023061,2015-05-24,33039834,Beau,Cass was great.  The apartment looked exactly like it did online.  The location is perfect if you're looking for a quiet place to stay while visiting the city.  It's only a short Uber ride away from Downtown Seattle and the shops of Old Ballard.  Cass provided a great outline of places to visit and things to do that were near the apartment.  
320704,33512166,2015-05-29,24878177,Vannessa,"We had an awesome time in Seattle at Cass's place!! It was everything that was described in the posting and more. The neighborhood is just perfect for what we were looking for, so close to so many great places to eat and super close to downtown. Cass was very clear on her expectations and house rules which makes it easy to be a good guest! We had the pleasure of meeting her and her roommate and they were both very nice, vibrant people with lots of suggestions for us. Definitely check this place out if you're in Seattle, it felt like a home away from home to us. Thank you Cass, so much! "
320704,33956057,2015-06-02,2056422,Jessie And Barrett,"Beautiful home in a cool neighborhood. Like others have mentioned there is no cell reception in the place because it is underground so you'll have to rely on the Internet, which was unfortunately a bit spotty when we stayed there. Case was very responsive though so that was great. "
320704,36873189,2015-07-02,33158668,Andrew,"Great place, great location, Cass was very responsive to messages. Place was great clean and as advertised. The phone service was spotty (which was advertised) but there is Wifi."
320704,38221611,2015-07-13,34369620,Andrew,"This was a great little apartment! We stayed July 8th - July 12th. The apartment itself is beautiful just enough room for 2 people! There was also access to a computer which was really nice! We never met Cass but she was very responsive to any needs we had via messaging! 

Phinney Ridge is a quaint little neighborhood! It was great having a full kitchen and being able to cook breakfast (Ken's Market is also right up the street for groceries/supplies). I will say if you are looking for some night life though this is definitely not the area to stay. 

A cab ride from the airport (granted we did land around 1:00 AM) did cost almost $77, so if possible I would recommend Uber (that was only $35)

Overall we had a great time and will be looking forward to our next Seattle visit! "
320704,41194484,2015-08-05,29618394,Jane,"We loved staying at Redstone! Cass was friendly and helpful... We had a couple of little dramas during our stay, but nothing was a problem to fix at all. The apartment was awesome and had everything we needed. Phinney Ridge is a charming town...everyone was incredibly friendly, and everything we needed was within walking distance, bus stop to town was close too which was great. All in all it was brilliant! Thanks Cass!! "
320704,45373903,2015-09-02,33594374,Tom,Basically as described. Would be good for a very short stay I expect. Very nice neighbourhood.
320704,46161541,2015-09-08,957052,Alecia,"We were impressed the minute we walked into the apartment (and even before when we drove up to Cass's place).  It's exactly as described.  We wanted a place in walking distance of cafe's, bars, etc. and the apartment was only a few minutes away.  Having a private entrance was great in that we felt we could come and go without disturbing the tenants.  Parking was easy and there were always a few spots right out front and if you know Seattle, this is quite a plus.  Where we stayed definitely enhanced our already amazing trip to Seattle.  Thank you!"
320704,49150007,2015-10-01,8593673,Elise,"Everything about this place is fantastic! The location is great, just a (very) short walk to bars, restaurants, and an amazing market. The neighborhood is nice and quiet, it was truly a joy to stay here for 2+ weeks! Cass was extremely welcoming and helpful, if I wasn't moving here I would stay here again and again!"
6240501,31755194,2015-05-09,3842010,Erin,"From request and confirmation to arrival and stay, our brief time meeting Travis and overnight accommodations exceeded expectations. I simply wanted a bedroom and bathroom access for one brief overnight trip. Most of our time was spent at Seattle Center and Waterfront. We walked, rode the Monorail, walked, took a bicycle can, rode on the ferry and walked some more--exactly what I was hoping for. I love Travis' safe and fun neighborhood and enjoyed the easy walk to Seattle Center. There are plenty of convenience stores, grocery stores, awesome restaurants like Laredos (excellent cantina, food is delish--3 blocks from apartment). We are so grateful for this affordable and comfortable (bed and shower were way better than home, spa-rific) opportunity to visit our favorite Seattle destinations. The place was very clean, we had everything we needed and more, my son named and wanted to adopt the cats...everything about this stay was perfect. We'll definitely request another booking in the near future! :)"
6240501,32010219,2015-05-12,8896002,Jenny,"My boyfriend and I stayed at Travis' place during a visit to Seattle at the beginning of May. He was a very flexible host and accommodated our late arrival and late departure & the whole experience was very hassle-free and easy. It seemed that we mostly had the place to ourselves, but Travis was always accessible & promptly responded to texts. The apartment was neat and clean and a good jumping-off point for our daily activities. 

The neighborhood was in a good location; the walk to the Space Needle and the Monorail was under 10 minutes and there is plenty to see on the way. There is a grocery store within 5 minutes as well as nice restaurants. We appreciated Travis' recommendations on where to eat, we weren't disappointed!"
6240501,32289078,2015-05-16,32932742,Yuyu,"I like the house. It is new. It takes about 15 minutes to walk Space Needle and Kerry Park The roads in Seattle are ups and downs. Make sure to wear a comfortable shoes. Travis has two cute cats. Megan invited me and my friend to go to the bar together. We had a great night, which makes us feel good because of getting involved with the local people."
6240501,32419075,2015-05-17,2314697,Enid,"Travis and his girlfriend are one of the most amazing hosts I have met in my Airbnb experience. They were very attentive about our stay and gave us very clear and detailed instruction. We had no trouble finding their apartment, and it was just walking distance to Space needle. 
As convenient as it seems, however the neighborhood is very quiet and peaceful.
The room was clean, comfy and pretty, as well as the rest of the apartment. The travel guides and pamphlets were very handy, and they provided shampoos and new towels which was very considerate. Not to mention the two very adorable kitties that Travis and his girlfriend have, that we spent a very good amount of time to play with them, - they were as lovely as their hosts! :)
Unfortunately our schedule conflicted that we weren't able to meet them in person. Yet there was no problem in communication at all. 

I would definitely recommend to stay with Travis to the next guest!
"
6240501,33463365,2015-05-28,18408058,Lester,"Travis' home is a well kept, clean and comfortable place. The room was perfect. The logistics to access apartment while they were out worked perfectly.  Lovely to be welcomed by two adorable cats. "
6240501,34326635,2015-06-07,14403689,Kana,"Absolutely perfect location in Queen Anne. Wish we lived there! The apartment is very cute and cozy. I was never able to meet Travis in person but he was very good about keeping me informed about any details of the stay.  Megan was very helpful, kind and welcoming.  The two cats are adorable and a nice bonus for us animal lovers.  The apartment is walking/running distance from the waterfront to get a beautiful and scenic workout in. We were able to easily walk to some amazing restaurants at night. Completely safe neighborhood.  Would definitely stay here again!! "
6240501,34490331,2015-06-08,34061334,Jeremy,"Travis's place was great! Super clean with all the amenities we could have needed, and his cats are real cute."
6240501,34899343,2015-06-13,2779882,Marcus,"This was a great location for me near the Seattle Center.  Travis and Megan were very welcoming and flexible with my schedule, which was a huge help to me.  "
6240501,35134364,2015-06-15,34331244,Cindy,The host is very responsive and responsible. He accomodates for your reasonable requests. The apartment is well kept. I had positive experience. You should try!
6240501,35409816,2015-06-18,34766742,Janette,It was my first Airbnb experience and it was amazing!  Hosts were full of hospitality.  They accommodated our checkin/checkout times.  The bedroom was comfortable and the place was in close proximity of everything we wanted to visit/see. 
6240501,35978380,2015-06-23,20499361,Phillip,"Room description was accurate. Great location, didn't meet Travis since he was working at the time but his girlfriend let us in. He also let us keep our bags at his place and pick them up later since we had a later flight. Great communication, thanks for the stay!"
6240501,36161875,2015-06-25,36624887,Patrick,"Exactly what we were looking for! Just a clean, quiet room to stay in with a nice welcome letter and clear instructions. The mini in-room fan/air filter helped with the heat wave. The two cats are surprisingly friendly, too.

P.S. free street parking!"
6240501,36284535,2015-06-27,29912409,Mark,Comfortable stay not too far from the centre of town. Travis communicated well and didn't mind my late arrival. The apartment was basic but pleasant. No problems.
6240501,36809591,2015-07-01,27359278,Tom,"the room stays a very good location,very clean,comfortable,lovely.
Travis is a very good man,he makes me feel very relax....
anyway,this room is very worthy to stay."
6240501,37367968,2015-07-06,2370177,Julian & Myriam,"Travis's apartment fitted our requirements well. It is a simple place, with a well appointed kitchen, good wifi and a good location with decent transport access (bus line 3 and 4 a few minutes walk away) which will take you directly downtown. There is also a big, well stocked QFC 10 minutes walk away in addition to a number of bars and restaurants.

We stayed during a heat wave in Seattle, unfortunately due to that the apartment was very warm. There is a small fan in the bedroom, and even with that on full blast and the windows open, the room becomes extremely warm. Not Travis's fault but still worth noting.

We would also echo the previous comment regarding the kitty litter in the flat, as Travis stated, probably due to the heat but still worth considering. The cats are however, cute, curious and extremely friendly."
6240501,37868248,2015-07-11,34756212,Randy,Great host. Was able to accommodate our early flight schedule. Great location! Just a few blocks away from Space Needle and easy access to rest of the city from there. Highly recommended.
6240501,38178103,2015-07-13,30462536,Rebecca,"Travis' home is simple and accommodating. They weren't home during our stay but communication was easy so we were able to check in and out on our own without hassle. Everything we needed was in the private room, including a comfortable bed, a nice desk, fresh air and towels. And wifi was included too. The location of the unit is next to a busy thoroughfare so we had to close the windows when we slept because the building is on a hill and the noise of the loud traffic was carried upwards. Also note, the smell of kitty litter was strong enough that we could smell it down the hallway as we came and left the unit, but once we were in our room and the door was shut it wasn't an issue. This smell may only have been exaggerated because of the hot weather, I'm not sure. But this was just a minor issue however, and other than that, everything we needed was provided and it was cozy as advertised."
6240501,39046908,2015-07-20,32871156,Anna,Travis and his gf were very nice and accommodating even when we got in very late and had to leave our bags until the evening of our departure day. The neighborhood was in a great location and close to the Seattle Center. 
6240501,39296328,2015-07-22,4955794,Dana,It was wonderful! Perfect place to have a home base! Close to everything you want to see! All within walking distance!
6240501,39768585,2015-07-26,5789383,Jay,"My partner and I had a very comfortable stay with Travis. We were in Seattle for a quick overnight between arriving late on the Amtrak and departing early on the Clipper (ferry) so we were looking for a location that was relatively close to both or accessible by transit, affordable, and with good reviews. Travis' apartment did not disappoint. Although we did not meet Travis in person because of the short time we were at his apartment we were very impressed with his timely, friendly and helpful communication. Although we had a few challenges with texting (an issue we similarly encountered with a different airbnb host in Seattle - it may have been a Canadian network problem) he made sure we had all the information we needed. 

The room and apartment were clean and cosy and we enjoyed being greeted by his two small cats. 

Although we picked this location for its ease of access from both the Amtrak station and Clipper dock we did, unfortunately, have some trouble getting there which was likely a consequence of following Google Maps unquestioningly. If you are busing, route 16 will drop you close by at Aurora and Prospect but this is a divided highway so it is not possible to cross at this stop. That said there are other bus routes to get you to Travis' location and it is a relatively short cab ride. We walked to the Clipper dock the next morning (all down hill!)."
6240501,40759793,2015-08-02,36007431,Alyssa,We had a great stay here!
6240501,41613710,2015-08-08,35538329,용선,"저녁 9시의 늦은 체크인에도 반갑게 맞아줘서 너무 감사했고, 깔끔하고 예픈 방도 너무 좋았습니다.  주방도 거실도 자유롭게 사용할수 있어서 더욱 좋았습니다. 물론 가장 좋은 점은 스페이스 니들까지 도보로10분 정도밖에 걸리지 않는다는 점이었어요."
6240501,41779940,2015-08-09,36571284,Jackie,Great location! Clean and comfortable place with very accommodating and friendly hosts!
6240501,42180579,2015-08-11,38042278,Joachim,"Really nice place and host. Perfect location (just a few minutes away from the space needle by foot, etc). Funny cats!"
6240501,42867919,2015-08-16,11493317,Eugene,"Travis' apartment was cosy and clean! There were quite a few buses that go to downtown Seattle from the bus stop nearby. We really enjoyed our stay, and thought the bed was really comfortable too.

There were 2 cats in the apartment and they took some getting used to. They were really friendly though, and liked our attention. Thanks Travis for a great stay!"
6240501,43379775,2015-08-19,18853616,Elizabeth,Travis 和 Megan 是非常nice的主人。他們的房子離西雅圖市中心區很近，走路5-10分鐘就到了。附近還有一個24小時的超市QFC，讓我們可以很方便買到食物。
6240501,43794515,2015-08-22,17683421,David,"Accurate description and pictures of the room which made for a nice and comfortable stay! Nice apartment in a great location to walk to everything in the entire city. Though we didn't interact much with Travis during our short stay, he was genuine and welcoming. As long as you don't mind his 2 friendly and playful cats it is a great place to stay while in Seattle. "
6240501,44587932,2015-08-27,32703986,Daniel,"Great location, the place was just like the picture, very clean and cozy. Travis made sure I had everything that I needed available and everything went very smoothly."
6240501,44925969,2015-08-30,12247592,Erin,"The apartment was clean and tidy. Great location, close to buses that go direct to downtown, the space needle and the monorail stop. The area is residential mostly so not a lot to explore directly in the neighborhood, though a great cafe that the hosts recommended to me 'Citizen' is very close. 
Travis and his girlfriend were friendly and helpful, though kept to themselves and we did not see much of each other.
The cats are lovely! "
6240501,45472747,2015-09-03,3137758,Kelly,"We stayed 3 nights with Travis and his girlfriend, although we didn't really talk to them until we were checking out.  The room was exactly as described and there were clearly marked instructions in the room when we arrived.  Parking can be a little tricky but we managed to park fairly close to the apartment.  They do have 2 cats, one of which is very inquisitive and has a playful personality!  "
6240501,45640867,2015-09-04,41503159,Gibran,"Travis was very helpful and friendly, he took the time to explain the Seattle public transportation and places to visit while in Seattle. Our room was clean and quiet. They have a cat that awaits for you to wake up so you can pet him. "
6240501,46118795,2015-09-08,17825826,Malcolm,"Travis was great, hardly saw him as I was out and about, but he was welcoming, kind, and friendly! The room was as described, and quiet and very central to everything in Seattle, and being a former resident, that was important for walking to the various neighborhoods I needed to go to! I would highly recommend Travis's space for your stay, and will inquire the next time I need to rest my head somewhere in Seattle! Oh, and the cats were great and super friendly as well!

Malcolm from Minneapolis."
6240501,46760895,2015-09-13,41573850,Kira,"Der Aufenthalt in Travis Apartment war sehr angenehm. Alles war so wie beschrieben bzw. abgebildet. Wir haben Travis und seine Freundin nicht sehr oft gesehen, da sie viel unterwegs waren (und wir auch). Aber wenn wir sie gesehen haben, waren sie total nett und entspannt. Wir durften alles benutzen und wurden eingeladen, uns wie zuhause zu fühlen. 
Die Lage der Wohnung ist super, wir sind überall hin zu Fuß gegangen. "
6240501,47709402,2015-09-21,40987684,John,Travis and Meghan were wonderful. I enjoyed staying with them. The room is as described. They have brochures out in the room to help enhance your experience visiting Seattle. They provide bath wash and shampoo which was a really nice touch. The place is clean and comfortable. 
6240501,48308031,2015-09-25,42455871,Sheila,"Travis' place is a close walk to th space needle and a block from the bus station so it was really convenient for us since we didnt have a car. In the mornings we pretty much walked all the way to downtown which wasnt bad because there were lots of things to see on the way(seattle center, melinda and bill gates foundation, cafes and restaurants). The nearby coffee cafe, Citizen, served good coffee and food so we were energized every morning. Self check in and out were pretty easy given Travis' instructions and he was helpful when we asked about commuting to his place since we thought the cab ride from the airport to queen anne is expensive. All in all we had a good time and will definitely recommend for those visiting seattle"
6240501,48714395,2015-09-28,26816895,Eveleen,Travis was an excellent host. We really enjoyed our stay and felt very comfortable in the room. We stayed for two nights and travis was kind enough to let us leave our suitcases at his place for the day on checkout as it was our anniversary and our flight wasn't until later so we were able to explore the city some more. The cats were really cute and friendly too and hardly shed which I've never seen (my cat sheds terribly) location was great! Room was clean and comfy. Great experience all up! 
6240501,50185888,2015-10-10,42896651,Maria,"If you really like cats and don't mind having around you all the time, this place is a great spot to stay while exploring Seattle. "
6240501,51660836,2015-10-22,46045049,Torey,"Travis and Meghan were amazing. I would recommend anyone staying with them. The apt was clean and in close proximity to the attractions I wanted to visit. They were very friendly and helpful. I was able to do self check-in, which allowed me to arrive whenever I wanted. Close to bus lines and other transportation options."
6240501,54746225,2015-11-23,22466205,Christina,Great communication! Allowed for easy access late at night-very grateful for that! Cute cats! The common areas have a cat scent but not the guest room. The room can get very toasty so recommend leaving the dial at the temperature it's already at!
6240501,57430910,2015-12-26,30375149,Alexandra,"My husband and I spent three nights in Travis' apartment and we had a lovely stay. The location is great and close to downtown, very easy to walk to main attractions. The apartment was very clean and cosy, we really appreciated the Christmas decorations, it made us feel like home! The two cats are really funny and nice.
We would highly recommend Travis' place for a long weekend trip to Seattle!
We did not have the chance to meet Travis but he was very responsive and available for any questions that we had. We really had a great time! Thank you, A & V"
488268,1359451,2012-05-27,2407753,AnnaLisa,"Ellen came and checked on us the first couple of nights to make sure we had everything we needed. When we couldn't get the TV to work she offered to let us use her DVD player and movies if we wanted. The space is a good size room, a private bathroom and a kitchen/walkthrough area. We had broken our french press recently and Ellen let us use one while we were there. The space has a refrigerator, a microwave, hot water pot and an Elite electric cookpot. I was able to use the cookpot to make soup one night and steam my manapua another night. Ellen also gave us use of the back porch and saved me once by feeding my husband when I thought I would get home in enough time to make him something to eat before he needed to go to an appointment. He was still talking about the salad she made two days later. Ellen was a great host and the space was just what we wanted. We would stay there again, definitely recommended."
488268,1468775,2012-06-12,580560,Rebecca & Dustin,"My wife and I stayed at Ellen's place while we were house-hunting prior to relocating to Seattle. She helped us figure out public transportation to and from the airport.  Her place is only five minutes to an express bus which connects to the train downtown. (about an hour and a half to the airport from Ballard)

Ellen is a great host, very warm and easy-going. She even baked us tasty muffins and cookies, in addition to having a great kitchenette set-up for morning coffee. (complete with condiments, tasty chocolates, oatmeal, french press and plenty of dishes)

Thanks Ellen!"
488268,1488061,2012-06-15,204871,Greg,Our stay in Seattle was greatly enhanced by the hospitality offered by Ellen.  She is a gracious host who is both helpful and accommodating.  The room was clean and the bed was comfortable.  The private entrance allowed us to come and go as we pleased.  Ellen even shared some of her baked goodies with us.  We will miss Ellen's easy-going manner that made us feel right at home.  Ballard is an interesting neighborhood with some good restaurants and shops.  Worth a visit for sure.
488268,1517706,2012-06-19,2487915,Bela,"It was nice to stay at the Ballard room hosted by Ellen.
I found there more than really what I was needed for during my staying.
Coffee in the morning, refrigerator et.
There was also a TV in the room with games, but never had the time to turn it on.
The sweetest thing was she offered and dropped me off both days to my Feng Shui lecture, so I'm really appropritiated for that."
488268,1563539,2012-06-25,233626,Jade,"Ellen was a lovely host and her place had everything we needed. We didn't spend much time at her home during the day, but we did have comfortable sleeps on the futon. The laundry was a bonus as well as Ellen's friendly dog Jasper and curious cat, Alfie.  "
488268,1585125,2012-06-28,2742368,Fawaz,"Ellen was a wonderful host. The room has a lot of space. I found it peaceful and quiet which helped me get some rest and work done. The desk was a plus. She checked on me during my stay to make sure I was comfortable and was always a delight to talk to. Before I left in the morning, she came down and gave me some delicious cookies that went perfectly with my coffee on my way to school. Nice calm and cozy neighborhood with everything nearby within walking distance too."
488268,1740157,2012-07-18,2393918,Marvin,"Ellen was a great host. She checked on me few times and even invited me to have dinner with her family and friends upstairs. The room was excellent. I was out most of the time, but when I got back to the house I found myself very relaxed due to the fact that it's quite and peaceful being in there. 5 stars! "
488268,1750572,2012-07-19,2926241,Pat,"Ellen was very accommodating in arranging a time for me to get a key to the house.  The rooms were as described - clean, airy, convenient and private.  I also enjoyed the opportunity I had to talk with Ellen briefly.  She was relaxed, comfortable and interesting - all traits I value!"
488268,1860108,2012-08-01,2092325,Bea,"Ellen's space is large but a bit dark. It served my purpose, though, and I enjoyed the cat's and dog's company at times. Ellen was a great host and I would stay there again. The neighborhood is great, close to bus lines into town and within walking distance (15-20 min) to the many restaurants in Ballard."
488268,1877670,2012-08-03,2913925,Lauren,"(I tried to give this five stars, but the web site seems to be having problems.) Ellen's basement apartment was spacious and comfortable. Ellen was also very accomodating when our flight was severely delayed, which caused us to arrive late at night. "
488268,1913747,2012-08-07,2676468,Ethan,"My girlfriend and I stayed with Ellen for five days and had a fantastic time in Seattle.  Ellen was kind, helpful and accommodating whenever we needed help.  She is a sincerely gracious host and we would recommend this home to anyone."
488268,1942668,2012-08-10,3018735,Aaron,"Ellen was a wonderful host and the room was great with enough privacy to feel like we were in our own hotel suite! Ellen is very gracious and accommodating and even made us cookies :).  I'd recommend Ellen's place to anyone, and if I ever make it back to Seattle, I will be sure to give Ellen a call!"
488268,2001697,2012-08-16,2750867,Emily,Ellen was a wonderful host! My sister and I stayed with her while we were in town and loved having the room as a home base. Ellen was very accommodating of our (increasingly complicated) travel schedule on the way in and made us some delicious treats in the mornings.   
488268,2215995,2012-09-06,3181033,Bailey,"My wife and I had a great time staying with Ellen for a week. She was very accommodating and even made us some cookies and a cake. The room was very spacious and affordable. It was very clean and had everything we needed for our stay. I did find an unexpected guest sleeping in my bed since I forgot to close the door to the bedroom, but he is nice dog and it wasn't a big deal. Thanks again for everything."
488268,2261236,2012-09-11,2930302,Laura,"I booked this room for my mother who was visiting from Arkansas. The space was very clean and exactly as advertised. My mom kept commenting to me that, ""Ellen thought of everything!"" 

She was very pleased with the accommodations to say the least. It was very quiet and things like a fridge, tea kettle, and use of the washer and dryer were features that made this much nicer than staying at a hotel. Plus the back deck is perfect for relaxing outside. I'll be recommending this place to all of our out-of-town visitors. "
488268,2345129,2012-09-19,3213552,David,"Overall a great experience and a great value for the price. Ellen was very nice - she even gave me some homemade cookies!  The room was clean and comfortable.  I'm a big guy so I found the shower head a little low for me and the stall a little narrow.  A hand-held shower head would be a welcome addition.   

The bed is a futon with a foam topper.  I found it very comfortable, but it is firm like any futon.

The location was perfect for me as I was visiting a relative in Ballard.  Parking on the street was easy to find within a door or two of the house.  

I would definitely stay here again the next time I visit Seattle."
488268,2462817,2012-10-01,2522853,Allison,"Ellen is a kind, generous, and thoughtful host. As someone who just moved to town, I appreciated her friendliness and helpful suggestions. Her home is in a very pleasant neighborhood and I thoroughly enjoyed my stay. The space is clean and cozy – I happily thought of it as ""home"" while I checked out housing around the city. Her pets Alfie and Jasper are gentle and sure to make you smile. Thanks for great stay, Ellen!"
488268,2999759,2012-12-01,2582096,Patricia,"You will enjoy staying at Ellen's as she is considerate, helpful, and calm.  Ellen's home is conveniently located in a great neighborhood.  I walked all over and also used the Rapid D line for easy bus access to Ballard and downtown.  There is easy street parking, too.  The two room basement  area is welcoming and nicely arranged, it suited the work I wanted to do when I was home..  I especially appreciated my own entrance and bathroom, ensuring privacy.  I also enjoyed sharing with Ellen and the tasty,  healthy treats she prepared."
488268,3997148,2013-04-02,4745917,Lauren,Ellen was a great host and the space was good match for what I needed in terms of being new to town and needing time to find an apartment. Ellen was accommodating and generous! She even shared various homemade snacks with me! I'd say this is a good place to stay if you're in need of a a bit more space and need access to a kitchen. 
488268,4375394,2013-05-01,177359,Collin,"I spent a month at Ellen's place, and I couldn't have been happier. It's a very clean, simple, and private suite in a great area, close to a number of beautiful parks as well as the center of Ballard. And with an easy 30 minute commute downtown with the new RapidRide bus line a couple blocks away, it's very accessible to the rest of the city. The back entrance makes it easy to come and go without disturbing, but Ellen was always fun to chat with when we crossed paths, and had a lot of tips about the area. Also, having a washer/dryer so readily available in the space was super nice!"
488268,4491094,2013-05-08,4213561,Carol,I very much enjoyed my stay with Ellen.  She makes every effort to ensure comfort; the neighborhood is quiet.  The space was just what I needed for my 5 day stay.  I plan to return soon.
488268,4830248,2013-05-28,4213561,Carol,The downstairs mini-apartment has served my needs on both visits and Ellen has been a very accommodating hostess.  This residential area is quiet and with easy access to bus routes or to drive downtown or over to the water.  I would definitely return!
488268,5175167,2013-06-17,5146657,Emily,"Ellen's space was the perfect getaway for our weekend stay in Seattle! The amenities were exactly as listed, Ellen was great to communicate about arrangements for getting into the space and everything was clean and tidy! Thanks Ellen- we'll definitely be contacting you the next time we visit Seattle!"
488268,6863600,2013-08-27,8347857,Edward,"This was a very nice first experience with Airbnb. Ellen's place was just as advertised, and though our schedules did not match and we did not meet, she was good at communicating by text and all went smoothly. The place was clean and peaceful and the mattress was comfortable. Only a little confusion because I arrived int he evening and couldn't see or find the house number. I deduced it from the neighboring numbers. "
488268,6937284,2013-08-31,7489685,Michal,Ellen made us fill right at home. Her place is beautiful. private and clean. Her back yard is quite and a wonderful relaxing point. We strongly recommend staying at her lovely home. 
488268,6989334,2013-09-02,7675094,Susanna,"Ellen's location in NW Ballard is a great spot! Easy accessibility to downtown Seattle and a great neighbourhood to be in. I really appreciated the fact that we had our own private space. When we arrived, we were greeted with a welcome note from Ellen, telling us of the great hot spots for food. Thai, Vietnamese, Mexican and Western cuisine; I'm sure there were more on that list, but I can't quite remember them all. She knew of all the great little boutiques around town and was kind enough to give us directions should we need it. Her place was clean and comfortable, especially for a Queen size futon bed. This was so much better than a hotel stay, as we had our own full kitchen, bathroom and private bedroom. We were able to meet Ellen and on our last day in Seattle and she offered us to come up to her home and surprised us with delicious homemade muffins. I would definitely recommend staying with Ellen. I'm sure we will be back for another visit! "
488268,7077418,2013-09-05,8167343,Amanda,"Great first experience with Airbnb! Ellen was very nice and easy to check in with via email. She wasn't going to be home when we arrived but she made it easy for us to get the key and let ourselves in. The direct entrance to the apartment was perfect for coming & going and not feeling like we were bothering anyone. Overall the space is calm, and although in a basement, it felt bright. The neighborhood is nice for taking a walk, with restaurants, parks, & transit all nearby. 

One thing that wasn't a problem for us, but may bother light sleepers, is that you can hear footsteps from the room above. Anyone who is used to living in a bottom floor apartment won't have a problem.  "
488268,7222097,2013-09-11,7828414,Alyssa,"We had a wonderful time in Seattle and one of the best things about it was staying with Ellen. The little downstairs suite was just as advertised, clean and cozy. The mini-fridge, microwave and toaster oven in the kitchen space was all we needed for meals and holding leftovers (so many delicious restaurants in Seattle!). The house was fairly quiet and nicely relaxing for the times we just felt like sleeping in. The separate entrance was a big perk, as we didn't feel intrusive in coming and going as we pleased. Ellen was a welcoming host, giving us a little primer on the area before leaving us to our own devices. She was always open to answering questions and suggesting specific places and was very communicative. We enjoyed the Ballard area quite a bit. The neighborhood is two blocks away from the D Line, which was a very convenient way to get downtown and to the other main transit lines. Ballard was nice to walk around in too; walking 15 minutes south from the house will take you to the busy district of Ballard, with shops, restaurants, coffeehouses and a record shop. We would absolutely stay here again the next time we visit Seattle. Thanks, Ellen!"
488268,7625284,2013-09-27,3587323,Patty,"Ellen is the epitome of a gracious, kind, calm, sweet, and thoughtful host.  I had a wonderful and hassle-free two-week stay at her home in Ballard.  She went out of her way to make my stay as comfortable as possible, providing delicious healthy snacks (homemade blueberry muffins made with agave and chocolate chip cookies).  I also really enjoyed the conversations that I had with her and her family.  This being my first visit to Seattle, Ellen answered all my questions about the city, and even connected me to her previous tenants who knew of possible openings for additional short-term housing, as I was considering a potential cross-country move.  Being foodies, she and her family also recommended more than 30+ restaurants (many of them vegetarian) and coffeehouses to try, which I really, really appreciated.  :)

The house itself is conveniently located to public transportation (the Rapid-D line bus was able to take me downtown fairly quickly), and is a short stroll away from Ballard's delights.  I enjoyed walking in the neighborhood, which includes a Sunday Farmer's Market, and Market Street, which has a lot of great eateries.  Sometimes I would even pop into the Ballard library for free-wifi, although the house is also equipped with free-wifi.  I also liked the capacious space a lot; it was really convenient to have a nice, private room with a separate bathroom and a small kitchen to use, as well as a separate entrance.  

I loved my stay, and Ellen's warm hospitality.  Thank you so much!"
488268,7747070,2013-10-01,5074648,Cheryl  (And Ron),"Ellen provides a nice ""home-away-from-home"" to those visiting Seattle, and in particular, the Ballard neighborhood.  Everything I needed was thoughtfully provided.  The futon bed was comfortable and the mini-kitchenette met my needs.  I'm familiar with the neighborhood and didn't need any help with what to do or how to get around but I'm sure Ellen is happy to provide assistance to those that need information.  "
488268,10918041,2014-03-13,10474335,Pierre,"joli petit appartement, simple mais fonctionnel . Ideal comme pieds à terre pour 2 personnes pour visiter Seattle. L'hôtesse est accueillante et attentionnée.
Si l'occasion se présente, nous reviendrons avec plaisir."
488268,11017844,2014-03-17,12457196,Takiko,"Staying at Ellen's was perfect for us. It was very clean and the space was comfortable and more than ample for 2. The neighborhood is quiet and the parking was very easy. We enjoyed the privacy of having our own access to the flat and appreciated the little touches...like fresh ground coffee in the refrigerator.
It really felt like a lot of consideration was given to what would make a comfortable stay for guests. Luggage could be stowed at waist level behind lovely curtains. The bed was comfortable and the shower was hot with good pressure.

The backyard was inviting though the weather was not conducive this trip."
488268,11104339,2014-03-20,13081282,Paul,"Ellen's place is in a very pretty part of Seattle, and the house itself is really nice. We were comfortable during our entire trip. Definitely stay here if you're coming to Seattle!"
488268,11305987,2014-03-29,10534523,Bernadette,"Ellen wasn't around for our stay, but her daughter, Tara, was there. She was very accommodating by allowing us to check-in very late due to flight times. The room was just as advertised and very cosy. It is a home away from home. The pets are sweet and friendly, and will visit with you if you want. The neighborhood is absolutely convenient, with nearby groceries, sundries, shops, and sites. I would definitely stay here upon my return to Seattle."
488268,11620610,2014-04-09,1769123,Hamad,"Ellen was extremely mindful of giving her guests their space and privacy. She has a very calm presence and is always thinking of new places for her guests to go out and see. I was always comfortable asking her questions or sending her a text when she wasn't around in-person. And the rest of the reviews are true when they say she can whip up some delicious treats - I had some great crepes with almond butter and bananas with her on my first and last mornings in Seattle(along with some good conversations). A great way to begin and end the trip! 

The space itself is spacious, and with a private sink, bathroom, microwave, toaster, and coffee maker. It really feels like your own little apartment. I loved the surrounding area - quiet, near some beautiful parks and near some stunning views of the olympic mountains. The place removed from the bustle of the city, but well-connected to buses that take you directly to downtown. If you don't venture out, then Ballard itself is an adorable neighborhood complete with everything you'd need. "

488268,13070942,2014-05-19,2084798,Theresa,Perfect stay!    We loved it and would definitely stay here again.   Loved that it had a separate entrance so we could come and go without disturbing Ellen.  Thanks again Ellen!  
488268,13671666,2014-06-02,14325713,Valerie,Ellen's guest space is simple but clean and provided a good home base while we were out looking for apartments. She was very sweet to let our dog out into the backyard and spend time upstairs when we were gone for longer days. We enjoyed getting to know the surrounding area--many great restaurants nearby and pleasant residential streets for taking a stroll.
488268,15028973,2014-07-01,11245325,Rebecca,"This is the second time I have stayed with Ellen.  She is a wonderful host with a clean, comfy and perfectly located rental.  Ellen is very kind and always went out of her way to make me feel welcomed.  Whenever I told her of my plans to explore Seattle she always had a mountain of advise on how to go about doing it the most fun, inexpensive and easy way.  The rental itself is great!  Extremely clean and quiet.  The backyard is also great to enjoy the nice evenings in Seattle.  I highly recommend this rental to anyone!"
488268,15446531,2014-07-09,13993927,Shih-Ching,"Thanks Ellen provided the comfortable place for our staying. Room guide really helps us for dinner (website hidden). Rainier is very very beautiful. Next time, hope we can hike in the mountain together. Thank you~"
488268,15673902,2014-07-14,7644885,Joanna & Dirk,"Ellen’s place was a great spot for my trip to Seattle. It was easy to find and orient myself to the space, excellent location and very close to a favorite restaurant of mine, Cafe Munir. Ellen’s warm and laid back atmosphere that she created was very much appreciated! "
488268,16199699,2014-07-23,10765984,Jen,"Nice and quiet stay, neighborhood makes it easy to get to downtown Seattle & surrounding areas. Loved the ""private"" entrance."
488268,16777338,2014-08-02,7448809,Kirk,"I enjoyed my stay at Ellen's house. She was a great host. There was plenty of space to spread out and feel comfortable. The neighborhood is nice and I enjoyed both walking down to Ballard and the option of catching a bus to downtown Seattle just a few blocks away. I slept well all week long.
"
488268,16993080,2014-08-05,9215263,Sabrina,"Ellen's place fit our needs well. Ellen is a thoughtful hostess and true animal lover. Her place was clean, the bed was comfortable, and location was close to some great shops and resturants. Finding a comfortable and affordable place to stay with a pet is not always easy. Ellen's place worked out well. We appreciate her hospitality :)"
488268,19456780,2014-09-13,15667512,Cindy,"Ellen's place was wonderful for my extended stay in Seattle.  The cozy, clean and comfortable room was more than enough for one person and I really liked the kitchenette and private bath and private entrance.  The neighborhood was quiet and great for walking.

It was a great combination of privacy and sociability, Ellen made me feel at home and shared conversations and delicious homemade treats that were much appreciated.

My stay was a wonderful experience!
"
488268,19846380,2014-09-19,20640343,Natalie,"Ellen is a wonderful host. She gave me clear and complete directions about the house. Written directions and hints were actually placed around the house as well which was smart and helpful to me.
Everything was just as described, clean/renovated and lovely. Internet with good bandwidth and stability. Dishes, excellent washer/drier, appliances were available. 
The room is in the basement, fully isolated.  The laundry is shared, but Ellen didn't want to use it even when I told her its completely OK, since I sleep like a rock :)
Quite, almost serene neighborhood. I rested so well.. and it was something about the air: my allergies disappeared during this stay.. Will definitely stay there again."
488268,20094078,2014-09-23,19660621,Terri,"This was my first AirBnB experience. Ellen greeted me when I got there. She showed me my room, the amenities and maps. She had coffee, tea and fruit for my use, as well as odds and end things in the fridge. It felt very welcoming. The space was perfect for my dogs and I. I loved the deck in the backyard.  Ellen is a wonderful hostess."
488268,20371148,2014-09-28,19642055,Keisha,"Ellen was a wonderful host. She was very helpful as a guide in telling about specific areas of Seattle. While I only stayed for a short time, she made me feel welcome in her home and her city. "
488268,21874264,2014-10-26,19140301,Shannon,I stayed with Ellen for a month while I was working in Seattle and I had a great experience. The room was exactly as advertised - clean and very convenient. Ellen was great with my dog and often took him out while I was at work. Her and her daughter were quiet and easy to live with. The area was convenient and safe. I would highly recommend staying with Ellen for a short or long-term stay in Seattle!
488268,22255518,2014-11-02,8639630,Travis,"I'm happy to report that my first experience renting just a room (as opposed to a whole unit) was a great success! First, Ellen started the trip off on a positive note by accommodating my late check-in. The space was very neat & tidy and although I was traveling alone, it could easily be used by a couple. While I had minimal face-to-face interaction with Ellen and did not have any need to contact her while I was there, I felt that she was just an easy call or text away any time I may have needed something. Also, the location is excellent. Ample parking, an easy drive to downtown (even during rush hour), walking distance to some cool bars/restaurants, and I also made use of the nearby bus lines."
488268,22872109,2014-11-16,8657276,Gian,"I had a wonderful stay at Ellen's home. It was very peaceful, quiet, and private. I enjoyed our conversations and the hospitality. I was very happy to stay in Ballard with Ellen. Thanks!"
488268,23045596,2014-11-21,8953194,Arthur N.,"Ellen was a very kind host to us and our dog. The space is a very comfortable private floor of their house, with a bedroom and separate kitchen, as well as a private bath. The memory foam mattress is also very comfortable. Parking is also ample on the street.

The location is excellent, and very convenient to Ballard/Freemont/Green Lake/U-District. We really enjoyed our stay, and definitely recommend this place. "
488268,23294367,2014-11-28,20124588,Joel,"Best Seattle stay I have had. Great location. North on 15th Ave takes right to Northgate Mall. South on 15th Ave goes to Elliott then left on to Denny and South Lake Union or into downtown. Go straight into Western and you can get to the stadiums.
I liked the privacy and loved having the laundry. Relaxing location to enjoy Seattle."
488268,23493416,2014-12-02,16114573,Summer,We had a great time during our stay in Ballard at Ellen's house. Ellen made the whole process incredibly easy. The neighborhood was great and close to all of the restaurants and bars in Ballard. Ellen was very nice and even shared some of her Thanksgiving treats with us!
488268,23951116,2014-12-15,19131414,Christine,"The space looked exactly the photos. Very clean and no carpet which is always appreciated. Our hostess was friendly and welcoming. The kitchenette was also much appreciated! It should be noted that footsteps upstairs are quite noisy downstairs (in the rented space) and a person with cat allergies can have some issue. The major deal breaker for us however was the bed. I like firm beds, but this was too much - we ended up getting a hotel for the last night. Overall the space is friendly, safe and clean, so if you have a dog I'm sure it is one of your better options!"
488268,24723678,2015-01-02,3591946,Jamey,"Ellen was communicative and helpful before my visit about how to get around and was available on my arrival. (a good thing as I had no idea where I was going!). The  apartment was exactly as described and perfect for me. I was looking for privacy, quiet, clean & price. The private bathroom is small but works perfectly. The place is simply furnished and very clean. The firm, memory foam mattress was a draw for me and it did not disappoint. There's a big TV but I never turned it on. I rely on wifi and the network was fast and reliable. The weather was cold during my stay - upper 20's lower 30's at night. Though the apartment was warm enough, there was a space heater in case. I was very comfortable and happy with the place for a week long stay.

The neighborhood is quiet, not a lot going on. It is about a 20 minute walk to Ballard and all the restaurants & shops which is a great thing to do. You do have to take a bus to downtown (about 30 minutes) for the touristy stuff which is fine for me; I tend to head out in the morning and not return until my day is done. There's a 24hour Safeway and a Walgreens about 5 or 10 minute walk away, at a major intersection of buses.

I didn't rent a car, although I'd initially hoped to drive out to the mountains, so I can't comment on parking. But the bus system is amazing. There are many great places within walking distance like Green Lake, Woodland Park and Golden Gardens, not to mention Ballard. The views are spectacular!

I had a great time visiting Seattle and this house provided a perfect home base. Ellen was friendly and considerate and the house was exactly what I was looking for."
488268,25280110,2015-01-11,19933856,Richard,"Ellen was a great host and was easily accessible by texting and phone.  She was flexible with arrival and departure times.  The space was exactly as pictured.  Simple,  but spacious and nice and clean.  Having a large, new washer and dryer was especially helpful for a stay of a week+.  The location was perfect for me, and a great value for the price.  I had a rental car and could always find a parking place on the street right in front of the house."
488268,25476128,2015-01-17,25509369,Zachary,"Very great neighborhood to park a car. Cute house.  We really enjoyed our stay with Ellen. Very gracious host. Our schedules kept us very busy so we didn't see her a lot,but she was happy to talk when we were available but also happy to leave us be when we were busy.  The room looks just like the picture.  She bakes great cookies!"
488268,27684442,2015-03-09,9310420,Laura,"Ellen is a gracious host. She was available for information about the area, and made breakfast on my first morning there. The apartment is private and quiet. Kitchen was well equiped. It had everything I needed. The bed is very comfortable, so I slept well, and It was quiet at night. The neighborhood is good, close to restaurants and shops, and there was always parking out front. I would stay here again, and would recommend it if you are looking for a place to stay in Ballard. "
488268,27965573,2015-03-15,28249196,Colette,"This was our first experience with Airbnb and I have to say it was a great one. The room was exactly as pictured. The room was simple but clean and comfortable.  I don't mind simple, I mind functionality. The kitchenette was my favorite. The room has a great little toaster that made eating grocery food easier. The bed was firm, but comfortable. Ellen recommended a great place for breakfast upon our arrival and it was delicious. I was happy to get my tourist experience during the day and come back to what felt like home.  The neighborhood is just adorable. I really enjoyed seeing everyone's front yards! "
488268,28466855,2015-03-24,6430425,Bekah,"Ellen was very accommodating and always made sure we had everything we needed. The space was the perfect size for us and the fact that there was a dog door and I could have my dog with me was great! Location was awesome as well, parking always available. "
488268,30379436,2015-04-21,6165720,Meg,"Private, spacious suite. We chose this one because of the location, dog-friendliness, and garden/patio access and it met expectations. Quiet neighborhood but easy access to Ballard and Phinney Ridge. Plenty of street parking. Also nice to be able to do laundry during an extended stay. All around another good Airbnb experience! "
488268,30820187,2015-04-27,26875127,Kristene,"This space is wonderful - A nice, private getaway in a beautiful neighborhood in Ballard. Ellen was a gracious host and welcomed us, showed us the room and its little quirks, and offered tips on vegetarian dining near the neighborhood - a big plus for me. The room has a private entrance in Ellen's backyard, with a lit pathway around the side of her home. My boyfriend and I were free to come and go as we pleased without disturbing anyone. The bedroom portion of the room is separated from the kitchenette and bathroom areas, which I enjoyed. The bed is firm but comfortable, and the blankets that were supplied kept me nice and warm. The kitchenette portion was so nice to be able to use, and I enjoyed the little snacks and beverages Ellen supplied. The shower in the bathroom is small, but it was great to have our own private bathroom to freshen up in. This space was exactly what my boyfriend and I needed as a 'home base' to explore the city and job hunt!"
488268,31133130,2015-05-02,31429077,Rachel,"Ellen is a very friendly and communicative host. She addressed whatever problems I had (I had a small one) as soon as she could and even offered/gave me a ride to my next destination. The ginger cookies were a nice bonus, too."
488268,32466500,2015-05-18,28314022,Jessica,"The host is wonderful, Ellen was very considerate and she even surprised me by offering me a meal (spring roll and Thai green curry) which I really appreciated. I stayed at her place for 15 days and the room is comfortable for long term stay. I had a lot of privacy which is important for me and I had everything I needed. I feel really safe staying at her place. Ballard is a beautiful neighborhood and the public transportation from Ellen's place is amazing. There are buses close to her house that can take me to Greenlake, Downtown, U-District, Golden Garden Park and Northgate mall very easily. I have to say that Ballard is becoming one of my favorite places in Seattle, there are so many cute local shops and restaurants. I really recommend people new to Seattle to stay in Ballard. "
488268,33127870,2015-05-25,947801,Sheila,"We really enjoyed staying at Ellen's place. She was very accommodating even though we arrived quite late at night, and she even offered to make us something to eat from her own kitchen.

The room itself was perfect. Even though the bed is technically a futon, we had completely forgotten this because it was so comfortable. There was a washing machine and tumble dryer in the room which was a great bonus. The coffee and tea provided made for a great start to the day. 

We hired a car for one day and there was no problem with on-street parking right outside the house. 

5 minutes walk from the house was the bus stop for the rapid ride which connects you downtown in about 20 minutes.

Overall, we couldn't have been happier staying in Ellen's accommodation."
488268,33476525,2015-05-28,33921208,Jonathan,"Lovely, quiet place. It was very comfortable and everything we needed. The accommodations were great, and the efficient use of space allowed us to spread out and get comfortable. Ellen was very easy to talk to and helpful, and some of her suggestions on places to see in Seattle ended up being the highlights of our vacation. "
488268,35068765,2015-06-15,5401518,Diane,"Ellen is an excellent host, welcoming and helpful in providing information. The space is just as advertised (actually, a bit larger than I expected, which is not usually the case) and very well-appointed to meet the traveler's needs. There's also a lovely patio and yard out back.
Ellen's space is located in a sweet Ballard neighborhood. I'm looking forward to staying here again when I return to Seattle."
488268,35499374,2015-06-19,21198519,Amy,"Ellen's place is perfect as a temporary housing. It has everything you need to stay, and I enjoyed the privacy of having the whole basement and private bath and kitchenette. The location is great, too. "
488268,36105400,2015-06-25,4323037,Ryan,"Ellen was a very gracious host who provided everything we needed for a 5-day visit in Seattle. The location is great – a short drive or bus ride to downtown Seattle, but in a very quiet residential neighborhood with plenty of good food and other things to do nearby. The space is comfortable and it's a great price for the location. We very much enjoyed having morning coffee on the back patio to start each day.

The washer & dryer were also very convenient, especially considering that we stayed for more than just a couple days and were pretty active in the warm Seattle sun (not sarcasm, it was actually warm & sunny the whole time).

The private space is a technically a basement and you can hear Ellen doing her normal living stuff upstairs. This is not a big deal if you wake up early, but you may want to ask her about her schedule if you're a light sleeper and hoping to sleep in. She was very responsive to all my messages before and during our visit.

If you're looking for an affordable place to stay near the heart of Seattle with a gracious host, you can't go wrong here."
488268,36782747,2015-07-01,33121269,Diana,"Ellen made sure I was taken care of when I had to get to places, but she was respectful of my space as well. The description of the place was completely accurate. The neighborhood offers a lot of nice options, both window shopping and eating alone or with friends. It's close to nature at discovery park and the Ballard locks and has the farmers market on Sundays. "
488268,37488699,2015-07-07,19225203,Moriah,"-Location is about a 15 min drive to the city. Super close. Also close to a variety of good eateries.
-Easy accessible private entry way for her guests. 
-The space Ellen provided my boyfriend & I was a nicely renovated basement ( a lot bigger space than I imagined it would be) which included a washer/ dryer, our own little kitchen which included a sink, (dishes, cups & utensils which were actually really useful)& a  microwave/ toaster (perfect for leftovers that we had & we never had to bother her). + a private bathroom with a shower. Basically all the necessities we needed to accommodate our stay.
- The room was just as pictured,& as other reviews had said the bed was really big/ cozy (especially since I have a futon myself & I think her bed was even more comfortable than mine)
-We stayed for about 4 nights & I'd have to say that our stay was really comfortable, as if we were right at home. 
-Ellen was sweet enough to bake us a pastry before we left! (Thanks again btw!!) She also was easy to communicate with & was helpful by all the recommendations she gave us. 
-I would definitely stay here again if I'm every in Seattle or recommend this space to a friend!"
488268,37998868,2015-07-12,5607668,Amanda,Ellen is a great host. She welcomed us with healthy drinks and snacks and provided a customized list of restaurant and park/hiking recommendations. The house is adorable and the space downstairs is well-maintained and had everything we needed for our 3-day stay. We loved the Ballard neighborhood and would definitely stay here again!
488268,38736989,2015-07-18,35832385,Indigo,"Ellen was very welcoming and even gave my mom and I some delicious zucchini muffins upon arrival. The room is a sweet deal, you get a private bathroom, mini fridge, washer and dryer, TV with Roku, and a private entrance. 
The house is beautiful! But the yard could use some love.
The room is below the main house, so make sure you're okay with noise during the day, because Ellen likes to host her private bowling and tap dancing lessons. She really knows how to knock down all of the pins over and over again. I would've partaken, but I didn't realize wearing combat boots were a requirement.
She also owns a really cute cat. Unfortunately I'm allergic, so it wasn't a problem until I woke up to a cat walking on my face one morning. 
But overall, my mom and I really enjoyed staying at her house. It was a great price for what we got, and in a really great neighborhood. You can walk a couple blocks to get to 15th to access busses/grocery stores/etc.
Highly recommended! "
488268,39182667,2015-07-21,1373643,Raquel,"Ellen's place is nice and relaxing and very comfortable. Easy access with a separate entrance and nice backyard.  The location is just north of Ballard and close to the sound. Cute and quaint neighborhood. Ellen is nice, easy going, and helpful. I'd recommend this place to anyone looking to stay in the Seattle area."
488268,40107245,2015-07-28,14090141,Beth,"This was a wonderful space in a terrific, centrally located (but peaceful and quiet) neighborhood -- Ballard.  Ellen's basement en suite was clean and it had everything I required for my 5-day trip, including access to a washer and dryer, if needed.

I was able to provide my own groceries for the small meals I was providing for myself and the kitchenette was amply stocked.  She also offered up use of her full kitchen, if needed.  (Vegetarian cooking preferred, as noted in her guest manual.)

Ellen was accessible when needed and was kind and hospitable -- sharing breakfast with me one morning and providing delicious scones on another.  She is great!  I would stay here again in a heartbeat and would definitely recommend it to other travelers."
488268,41371350,2015-08-07,35855380,Oguz,"Great location, close to everything if you have a car. No traffic problems on the way to/from the house. The house is beautiful. Make sure you spend some time in the backyard."
488268,42125286,2015-08-11,20687895,Mikio,"Yes, the description was accurate of the bedroom. In addition, this is a roomy private suite with shower, washer, dryer and private entry in a quiet neighborhood yet close to great restaurants and Chittendon Locks.

She provided us great suggestions for where to go and what to do, including great local breweries and dog park/beach. Ellen was really friendly while still giving us our space. The place was just as described with easy access and parking. I would recommend this place to anyone looking for a great stay in the Ballard district."
488268,45276383,2015-09-01,26900259,Brad,"Ellen was a great host! she introduced herself on the day we checked in and was helpful in telling us a bit about the Ballard area. we were out and about a majority of the time, but Ellen's place was awesome to come back to at the end of our days. definitely recommend staying here as its just a short drive to downtown Seattle, the beach, the waterfront, the snoqualmie area, and if you're up for it like we were Mt. Rainer national park! Would definitely stay again!"

Ellen was also very generous with sharing her baked goods. The location is perfect. It is within walking distance of shops, parks and the bus line for downtown is just around the corner. The space was great, a large bedroom with your own bathroom and kitchenette. The washer and dryer was conveniently located just outside the bedroom which was very helpful and the space had its own entrance. Ballard is a amazing neighborhood with unique shops, tasty food and plenty of parking. "

We were warmly greeted, guided gently and the Home within a Home was truly easy and comfortable.  The home is located just north of downtown (10mins away)and is easy to find. Parking is also easy and free!   We had everything we needed, including privacy as we were traveling with our teenage son.  The space is generous and has a completely separate bedroom that can also easily accommodate another inflatable bed if you need it.  We will return soon! 
You couldn't ask for a better host. Pamela is thoughtful, smart and very attentive!  This stay was Seattle's Best! "

I also easily did the short walk to South Lake Union, where you have Amazon headquarters, Whole Foods, Lake Union Park and MOHAI, more restaurants, and so on. One note, the unit does have a balcony, but not a view. The view pictures are from the building's roof deck."
4082986,19579099,2014-09-14,1451468,Jay,"Hadar was timely,  and direct. I was able to book immediately and check in as soon as I got there. His wife met meabs gaveme the keyIt's a very new apartment complex and a small studio type room.  there IS however sliding walls that seperate bed from room.  It was clean and comfortable and easy to find. The balcony is shared with 2 other homes but we didn't go out there for more than looking around. Shower was hot,  fridge was cold,  thermostat works,  and lighting was perfect for us.  I will stay here again if I'm in need of an affordable get away to seattle."

4082986,20373323,2014-09-28,4591951,Eric,"Great communication everything was going great when he said that the management required background and credit checks.  Luckily these were not required and was able to enjoy my trip.  After that was cleared up this place has a great location being close to link rail and genereally just close enough that you could walk most places.
The place itself was kinda small but was just as described.  There is a nice balacany with a view of the space needle."

The apartment was overall very good.  Centrally located.  Hadar has an extra mattress which made sleeping there a lot easier.  

The lights in the apartment did not always work.  Not sure if it was the bulbs or the actual electricity.  But multiple lights would not always turn on.

Overall it was a good stay despite the lights."

Very cozy and located in a nice area that was within walking distance to the space needle, EMP museum, science museum, pikes public market, and shopping areas. Bagels, a couple of water bottles, and coffee were also very nice. Thanks Hadar!"

The flat was clean and the fridge contained Bagels, Butter, Jam and Water for our first breakfast. That was very attentive. Additionally, Hadar war very flexible so that we could check-in 3 hours earlier and had more time for sight seeing. That made our day! "
4082986,23152379,2014-11-24,109520,Howard,"Hadar was very accommodating.  He arranged to meet us to let us in and asked that we called 10 minutes before we arrived.  We came by public transportation from the airport and were not sure which bus we could take from the light rail stop when we were quite near.  He came and picked us up.  The studio was everything he described it as.  It was in a great neighborhood for us--walking distance to the conference Howard attended, the Seattle center with the EMT museum, Chihuly museum, space needle, restaurants, grocery stores, and transportation. "
4082986,23299871,2014-11-28,14660731,Andree,"Hadar was very accomodating and replies to emails and questions timely. His place is really clean, tidy and spacious enough for a group of 3.

The space was cozy with basic amenities. Hadar was very accommodating and flexible."
4082986,23552279,2014-12-04,2693807,Emerald,"We needed a clean, comfortable, conveniently located place to rest for a quick overnight trip down to Seattle. After reading all the great reviews, Hadar's lovely & cozy studio was just as expected! As was Hadar, though we didn't get to meet in person, he was prompt & concise with communications and had added thoughtful touches to the space such as extra blankets, a computer, and coffee, bagels & yogurt in the fridge! Thanks again for accomodating! "
4082986,25270186,2015-01-11,23945395,Curstin,"We loved this apartment for our trip. Extremely central. We walked everywhere! 10min to Whole Foods, 15min to Pikes Market, 20-30min to the lake or to Capitol Hill. We loved walking everywhere. Even when we went up to Ballard it was a short 15min bus ride. The apartment was also perfect for two people and came with the basics. We would definitely stay again. "
4082986,25369492,2015-01-13,21688950,Harriette,Perfect location! Within walking distance of everything we did. Loved the rooftop which had a beautiful view of the space needle. If I'm ever back in Seattle this is where I want to stay!

 The building is access controlled and the view from the roof deck is post card perfect

4082986,25742274,2015-01-25,21808406,Kevin,"Excellent first-time Airbnb experience!  Hadar was very accommodating to our late night check-in and even allowed for us to stay past our check-out time.

The studio well stocked with everything we really needed, TV, wifi, guest laptop, clean bedding/towels, shampoo, large refrigerator,  

The location allows for short walks to all the places we wanted to go, and most of our Uber rides were under the minimum charge of $4.00.

The building has a nice lobby and hallways that feels almost like a that of a hotel, the roof is easily accessible through the elevator and has a great view of the Space Needle.

Overall, great experience!  "
4082986,26045022,2015-02-02,23865029,David,"I have to say that my experience at Hadar's condo was more than expected.  Hadar was a pleasure to deal with being very responsive to any questions I had before arriving and kept me right when I was there. 

He met me personally to leave the key and gave a quick tour of the property.  Bagels, bottled water and beers in the fridge were very welcomed after a long haul flight.  

Extra touches like having spare umbrellas, free fast wifi and a backpack shows the thought he puts into it for his guests.

The condo is perfectly located for most major attractions in the city and his prices are very resonable.  

Views from the roof top terrace of the space needle were superb!

Next time I'm in Seattle I'll be contacting Hadar again for sure."
4082986,26189603,2015-02-06,26485746,Angela,Perfect location to enjoy downtown Seattle!  We walked to Pike Place and the ferry among other restaurants/bars.  Clean & cozy space.  Will definitely be back and I highly recommend staying here during your Seattle travels!
4082986,26214291,2015-02-07,25722197,Marta,"Hadar and his wife were so accommodating!  The communication was 5 stars!  We got stuck in traffic and arrived a half hour later than expected, and his wife was patiently waiting and was very gracious! She showed us how to access everything, had maps and city brochures, water and bagels in the fridge and even pens and pads if we needed them!  
The apartment was very clean and comfortable.  The bed was perfectly soft and had a nice comforter on it.  
The rooftop view is priceless!!  You have a 360 view of the city and there are chairs and tables to sit at while you take it all in.
You can't beat the location either!  We were able to walk to the Seattle Center, Westlake Mall and Pike Place!  Bus routes are close, UBER pick ups were easily accessible and the walk was easy!  
We will for sure be booking this space again!  Hadar and his wife do everything they can to help your stay be pleasant...the view and location are amazing...and the accommodations are great!
Thank you for an amazing stay!"

The location is perfect...only a 15min walk from pikes and 10min walk from the SEATTLE center.  The neighborhood is safe.  We walked back to the apartment late at night and never felt unsafe.

Excellent wireless service.

The lobby is secure and opens from outside with an electronic key fob.  The entry is just shy of 5th Avenue, cafes and a small grocery are close.  Bus lines on Denny and on 3rd are close by.  I come to Seattle for ballet at Seattle Center, easy access on UBER or public transportation.  On UBER, be sure to pin the SEATTLE location of this street number on Vine; there are others in US and UBER makes this mistake often."

The location is spectacular, and the rooftop view is great. The view from the apartment is pretty basic, but there is so much to see and do in this neighborhood which is in a great location that I didn't really care about the apt-view. If you're bringing a car there's no parking spot and I found it was expensive and challenging to deal with the Seattle downtown parking, but once I got that sorted out, I had a good trip and would stay here again. Thanks Hadar!."

4082986,33647746,2015-05-31,26523067,Alex,Experience in Seattle was great. Hadar was a fantastic host. I had helpful answers for all our questions. Made our first trip to Seattle extremely easy. Location of the place was perfect for everywhere we wanted to go. 
4082986,35057322,2015-06-15,1458876,Michael,"Communication excellent. Host helped me transport luggage from an airport hotel into town, a huge help which made a round trip by car unnecessary.  The unit is always clean as a whistle, compact but comfortable.  Milk, bagels and butter are available in the refrigerator.  WIFI of high quality, many coffee shops and small eateries and a drugstore within a block or two, Seattle Center walkable, downtown and Pike Market walkable."
4082986,35299394,2015-06-17,28276067,Matt,"Overall we had a great time in Seattle, and Hadar's apartment was warm and accommodating. Great location in the city, and the rooftop view was great! Hadar is a very nice man and I recommend this place!"
4082986,35455415,2015-06-19,30028439,Adeline,"Host Hadar was accomodating and waiting for us at the corner of street as per instruction given to us, as our coach arrival was delayed by more than 1 hr due to traffic jam along the way.

Cozy n nice little apartment, clean and quiet - good for 2 pax. Conveniently located to downtown Seattle e.g. Pike Place, Aquarium - all about 15-20mins walk (but me & friend felt abit far esp after whole day of walking in downtown).  Got a nice view of the Space Needle from the rooftop.

Only downside for us is wrong timing as there's construction going on during our stay. Apartment only has one door i.e. the balcony door to get fresh air into the apartment. Due to construction, we cant open it. In addition, when we came back in the evening, whole place was very dusty and we have to actually clean up the place as we both felt itchy and too dusty to be able to sleep for the night.

Overall, still a good stay in Seattle downtown."
4082986,35938079,2015-06-23,8604999,Kate,"WONDERFULLY host and location is stellar, especially for value. My husband and I just needed a place to crash in the city so we were able to walk to Capital Hill to our friends bike shop and get quality coffee and food. There were workers on the balcony but we didn't stay long and they were done by 3:30 so it wasn't a problem to me. Hadar was fantastic
And quick with communication and he even helped us with carrying out bag up the stairs to show us the property. Thanks so much-def a place to recommend! "
4082986,36154339,2015-06-25,36387545,Gillian,Hadar was very fast to respond to my message and questions about parking. We met his wife for the key exchange and she was super lovely and told us of some yummy restaurants in the area. The apartment was true to pictures and description and super super clean. Great location and overall an amazing stay. Thank you so much!
4082986,36540856,2015-06-29,32272335,Marc,Hadar was a great host.  Hadar was willing to help and be available as much as we requested.   Hadar's place is very close to all that Seattle has to offer!  Beautiful roof top patio with views in every direction...I spent a good amount of time up there!  The apartment itself was small but exactly what I needed for my trip.  It is well furnished and very comfy.   I would highly recommend Hadar to my friends and family.   Hadar went out of his way to provide a very comfortable second option for additional sleeping accommodations.  Very grateful!
4082986,36797459,2015-07-01,29901151,Anderson,"This apartment is as described and overall a great choice for a place to stay in Seattle for 1 or 2 people. Our host Hadar was also very responsive to our requests and was able to accomodate an early check-in. When he was not able to meet us himself to check us in, his wife met us instead and made us feel welcome. The neighborhood is really nice; it's a short distance to some wonderful restaurants, the Space Needle, and there's even a great little cafe for breakfast in the same building, right on the corner.

As of the time of our stay (early July 2015), it is worth noting that there was some construction happening on the facade of the building. This meant there were construction materials stored on the balcony and according to what we were told, the possibility of construction workers coming in and out of the apartment during the day (although they were apparently supposed to inform Hadar if they would do this, and he would inform us-- but this also never happened). What this did mean was loud noise outside the apartment fairly early (7am onward) and that we could not reasonably keep the balcony door open for ventilation once construction started, and with no A.C. this was somewhat uncomfortable.

This I think is all out of Hadar's control and I think a temporary situation that will be resolved in a couple months. However if you are considering staying here in the very near future I would be sure to inquire about it."
4082986,37444244,2015-07-07,27069860,Emmylou,It was very centrally located and it was described accurately in the listing. 
4082986,37671337,2015-07-09,35206000,Blake,"Great location, very close to space needle and other attractions, short walk to pike market and great bars and restaurants. Apartment was clean and well kept, had a full kitchen and lots of extra towels. I was very unhappy that I wasn't told about the construction, the entire outside was under construction, which left the sliding door and deck completely unusable. The noise from drilling, sawing, and workers climbing ladders to the back deck was horrible. The unit did not have air conditioning and the only fresh air came from the deck, the smell of dust and paint was nauseating. My girlfriend and I had little privacy worth the workers on the deck and had to keep the shades drawn all hours. I was never warned about the construction and would have never booked the unit. Hadar also asked us to come in the side staircase and not use the front door because his building isn't so kosher with air bnb. It was not the ideal circumstance for a romantic birthday weekend in Seattle."
4082986,38249115,2015-07-14,17697825,Roland,"Hadar met us at the apartment, explained everything. The location of the appartment is perfect. Nice and safe neighbourhood, in walking distance to the Seattle Center (5-8 minutes). 20 minute walk to Pike Place Market. The appartment had everything wie needed. We felt at home. You have access to the roof of the building with a view of the skyline on one side and the Space Needle on the other. 
Hadar is the perfect host. He even helped us with the return of our rental car in the Seattle downtown branch instead of the airport. He guided me to the rental company office and took me back to the appartment. That saved us a lot of time. Thanks, Hadar! 
I would definitely book Hadar's place again.
Hannah and Roland from Germany"
4082986,38694791,2015-07-18,4776287,Robin,"My husband and I were recently staying in Seattle, and Hadar graciously agreed to allow us to check in early and despite our train being late, was flexible with our check in process. The apt was centrally located in Belltown, close enough to walk to any attractions you may want to visit. There are 2 great restaurants within 2 blocks- Golden Singha (Thai) and Petra Mediterranean Bistro. Our host left many helpful maps/brochures which made it very easy to plan our adventures. Thanks very much for allowing us the use of your apt! "
4082986,39142402,2015-07-21,17572978,Barbara,Hadar's hospitality encompassed with professionalism is a credit to whst airbnb are all about
4082986,39336729,2015-07-22,697471,Maggie,"Hadar was great.  Stayed in good contact, check in and check out was a breeze.  The location and apt was just as described and very clean. There was some coffee which was great for the morning."
4082986,39474287,2015-07-24,21363734,Heidi,"Great location, close to Seatttle center (go see EMP!) and downtown. Lovely neighbourhood - we love Belltown! Apartment good value."
4082986,39903693,2015-07-27,27865831,Tyler,Had a great stay in Seattle at this apartment.  Hadar was excellent with communication and everything went according to plan.  Hadar was very accommodating with our schedule.  This was my first Airbnb experience and it was a great one.  
4082986,40151485,2015-07-28,38461152,Omar,"We had been in Poulsbo for most of our visit, but we stayed in the Seattle on our final day. The location of Hader's home was perfect and the rooftop deck was a plus for pictures( the space needle is in reach). The space is small, comfy and clean, (we we were there to explore the city, not to be indoors all day) perfect for our needs. Washer and dryer came in handy so we didnt have to go home with dirty clothes. Hader and his wife were very hospitable and fast to respond to any text or email. He allowed us to drop off our bags since we arrived early, while his wife cleaned and preped for our stay. Overall it was only one night, but it was just what we needed and more. My only wish is that we could've stayed longer. Great home, location, and service. We will return."
4082986,40305199,2015-07-30,23191190,Ricky,"The studio was really nice, in very prime location. Walking distance to the space needle and EMP Museum, not too far from Pike Place and the waterfront. Hadar was incredibly helpful with everything and even helped direct me from the airport to the apartment. Very clean studio."
4082986,40491624,2015-07-31,19996113,Pete,We met hadar a block away from the place and walked over with him when we arrived. He showed us the building and all of the amenities in the studio. He was helpful and advised us of the roof hours. Everything was clean and we had access to more blankets if needed. The entire studio was as described besides there being a little construction on the entire building but luckily we didn't notice any of it with noise or people. You have to do a little work to get a/c but everything worked fine. Thanks hadar. 
4082986,40712412,2015-08-02,25351925,Araceli,Really nice place. Walking distance  to all the main attractions. I rented a car for the day and was able to find parking very easy. Hadar and his wife were super friendly. Would use this place again.  
4082986,41718409,2015-08-09,16441478,David,"Hadar greeted us and made us feel welcome.  He explained everything that needed explaining and showed us where everything was.  There was no shortage of towels, blankets, and kitchen supplies, and the room even came with bagels and some beverages in the fridge.  The location was perfect for our needs and the price was very reasonable.  Also, he let us checkout late, because our flight was at 8:00 PM.  I'm sure this is subject to availability though."
4082986,43018183,2015-08-17,27444418,Stephenie,"Hadar was so friendly when he met us. His place was exactly as the pictures showed, very clean and welcoming. The neighborhood was perfect for us, as the first time in Seattle we were in the center of all the attractions! Hadar was flexible with his time for meeting; I would highly recommend staying!"
4082986,43347734,2015-08-19,3821388,Catherine,"Hadar made us feel welcome as he showed us around the studio flat. There was even milk,yogurt and bagels in the fridge for us! The flat is right in the heart of seattle and made it easy for us to walk to all the main tourist attractions. Thanks for a great city stay!"
4082986,44275604,2015-08-25,27236214,Brooke,We LOVED the location of the apartment. Space needle was super close Pike was about a 15 minute walk but the area is great so it didn't bother us. Hadar was super accommodating. We got in later than we thought and he had no problem meeting us a short block from the place. He even came and emptied the water from the air conditioner. The apartment is really clean and so cute. I would defiantly recommend this place to anyone! 
4082986,44542521,2015-08-27,36289603,Drew,Hadar's apartment was very clean and very close to everything we wanted to see in Seattle. Hadar was accommodating and had everything we needed to make our stay enjoyable. Thank you!
4082986,44880882,2015-08-30,2295081,Arianna,"Hadar communicated well about our meeting time, and he was right on time. He was friendly and showed me everything I needed to know about the apartment (the air conditioner/fan, food and coffee, etc.). My stay was comfortable and I felt safe. Hadar also helped me figure out the wifi when the user name and password weren't working. I really appreciate how he made himself available."
4082986,45144411,2015-08-31,36980632,Corbin,The place was fantastic! Great location and exactly as advertised. Very clean and well laid out apartment. The roof deck is absolutely stunning! One of the best possible views of the Space Needle. Would definitely recommend! 
4082986,45366221,2015-09-02,31648907,Johan-Petter,Hadar has a nice place in a great location. Hadars wife met up and showed us the apartment. Highly recommend this place to others!
4082986,45762631,2015-09-06,1533643,Stan,"This listing is good value. Hadar is a reliable host. He graciously accommodated both our early arrival and our unforeseen, late departure. The condo apartment was clean and functional. It presented as described, with one exception. The view in the photo is from the building's rooftop, which, to its credit, has Muskoka chairs and a barbeque for use of the residents. Great place to relax. The apartment's balcony and only window faces a narrow corridor between two parts of the building. Hence, no real view but on the upside, it is quiet because it doesn't overlook the street. Currently, the exterior of the building and the balconies are undergoing noisy renovation, so sleeping in late or hanging around during the day - won't be a viable option for a while. However, once you're out and about, the location is great. The Space Needle complex is around the corner. Whole Foods, a number of restaurants, coffee shops, a superb Parisian bakery and a bus/trolley hub station are no more than 10-15 minutes away by foot.  We'd definitely book this unit again."
4082986,46367965,2015-09-10,26699374,Tara,"Hadar was very friendly, helpful, and responsive. The apartment was very clean & stocked with the bare minimums. The coffee he provided was great to have every morning & delicious. Although it was a small place, my friends and I (3 of us) did not feel we were hindered in anyway. The best part about staying here was the view from the top deck which overlooked downtown Seattle and had a great view of the Space Needle. It was centrally located and within walking distance to almost everything. Loved how safe and secure we felt staying there. Thanks again Hadar!"
4082986,46493774,2015-09-11,26556873,Megan,"Hadar and his wife, Anita, were very easy to communicate with. Anita was flexible when we arrived later than expected due to traffic and when we needed to leave earlier. The studio was just as listed, very clean and well stocked. Unfortunately they were performing routine construction to the exterior of the building and we were not able to use the balcony. But the rooftop deck was available and provided beautiful views of the city. The studio was centrally located and convenient to all the attractions you would want to see. Our only wish is that we could have stayed longer! "
4082986,46695468,2015-09-13,27018051,Robert,"Location, location, location.  This is right in between the Space Needle and Pikes Market.  It was exactly as pictured.  The place was extremely clean comfortable.  There was a coffee shop about ten feet from the street exit door that made the start of each day.  We would stay here again."
4082986,47609437,2015-09-21,20463587,Sarah,We had a wonderful stay at Hadar and Hanita's place! Hanita met us once we arrived to provide the keys an showed us around the apartment. Fantastic location and perfect for what we needed! 
4082986,48002932,2015-09-22,12794950,Shannon,Hadar kept in constant communication with me and met me to hand over the key.  He gave a quick tour and went on his way.
4082986,48982786,2015-09-30,31345125,Joshua,"Hadar made his place very welcoming and pleasant to stay at. There were no issues and the location is perfect. Hadar checked in with me during the stay and was responsive to any questions I had. Overall, a great Airbnb experience."
4082986,49762133,2015-10-06,33198991,Henrik,Hadar is a great and kind host and paid a lot of attention to us during our stay. He was fast with answers to our questions and his place had the PERFECT location. We walked everywhere and anywhere
4082986,50618831,2015-10-13,36755707,Amy,"Awesome location, apartment, and host. Great experience all around. Would definitely recommend this apt to anyone!  "
4082986,50932561,2015-10-16,27276118,Samantha,You cannot beat the location of this place! We enjoyed the city - we walked everywhere! We had great weather and spent some time enjoying the sights on the roof top. If we are ever back in Seattle we will definitely stay here again.
4082986,51265734,2015-10-19,30290098,Cynthia,"Very accommodating to our need to leave our luggage there outside check in/out times.  Very clean and cozy place.  Excellent location, made exploring the city a breeze!"
4082986,51634517,2015-10-22,8155737,Michael,"Lovely apartment in a perfect location just minutes by foot to the Space Needle and some of the best restaurants, bars, and cafes in Belltown. Hanita and Hadar were extremely friendly and easy to reach via text message if I needed anything. I only regret I didn't have more time in their lovely studio!"
4082986,51786671,2015-10-24,24197304,Stephen,"Hadar was great! He was flexible with check in and out times, his place is convenient and cozy. We would stay here again! "
4082986,52628131,2015-10-31,46667599,Richard,"This Apartment is located in an amazing neighborhood walking distance from almost anything you can think of. Clean, Well kept, very homey feel although it may be a small apartment but great for any need. "
4082986,52831824,2015-11-02,31589127,Kristen,"Hadar is a great host. He went out of his way to help us, to make sure we had a good stay in his apartment and in Seattle overall. It started off with him showing us around his apartment, showing us whats there. There were plenty of amenities such as toiletries, towels, dishes, a couple water bottles, and little food items if we needed them. The room was great, perfect for 2 people, but also has stuff to accommodate an extra person if needed so. The rooftop has a great view of the Space Needle, and you can spot the apartment from the top of the Space Needle.  Also he was very helpful with helping us play tourist. He helped with our bags, and even offered to drive us to the downtown area since he was heading that direction. Stand up guy, honest, pleasant to work with, and very helpful. If I was in the area again, I would definitely rent from him. Thanks for everything Hadar."
4082986,53057317,2015-11-04,45111784,Karolina,"Perfect location, close to downtown.
Hadar was very easy to deal with, and only a phone call away"
4082986,53327629,2015-11-08,29379861,Ben,"Fantastic location, and nice little unit. Hadar was very accommodating to our schedule and was fantastic to work with.
The unit itself is walking distance from Seattle Centre, a nearby collection of pubs and restaurants and just a few minutes from a trendy section of even more restaurants. Its extremely accessible, and getting to downtown is very easy. I highly recommend this unit to everyone!"
4082986,54380813,2015-11-19,37460331,Mark,Hadar and Hanita were very welcoming hosts and I found them very easy to deal with. Hanita arranged to meet us with the key and braved some bad Seattle weather to meet us outside the place! The space is small but comfortable in a great location near the space needle and a 20 min walk to pike place markets. Overall the rooms were clean and what we were looking for in both location and space.
4082986,54579721,2015-11-22,16871995,Katherine,"Great location! Easy walk to Space Needle, Pike Place Market, great restaurants and bars.
It was easy to connect with Hadar and Hanita to access the apartment. The apartment itself is small, but clean and well-maintained. Very comfortable for two of us!"
4082986,55190600,2015-11-29,15179589,Javier,"We had a very pleasant stay in Hadar's studio. The neighborhood is very central, with a small grocery store nearby and within walking distance of the space needle. We came to run the Seattle marathon, and it was great being so close to the start and finish!"
4082986,55674447,2015-12-04,10982144,Sadie,"Overall, we had a great stay. Hadar wasn't able to meet us when we arrived, but he provided very clear instructions for locating the key and getting into the building. He was great with communication in general. The studio was nice, and very clean. The location as perfect for us since it was walking distance from the space needle and Pike's market. I was concerned about parking after reading other reviews, but we didn't have any trouble finding street parking near the studio, and the nearby lot with early bird rates was easy to use. As an added bonus, there's a great little french cafe right across the street! 

It's important to note that Hadar is extremely concerned about noise complaints from the neighbors, and the walls on this place are pretty thin. I would not recommend this space for groups, families with small children, or even people who might be stumbling home late after a few drinks. It worked out fine for us since we weren't coming and going late at night, and we were basically only using the space to sleep. 

Like I said, we really had a great stay, and I would definitely consider staying here again if we came back to Seattle. "
4082986,55787621,2015-12-06,20940040,Amber,Our stay at Hadar's apartment was lovely. The space was nice and in a great location with everything we would need. Hadar was easy to communicate with and flexible. We would stay again when in Seattle.
4082986,56183731,2015-12-10,45084914,Rita,"We were not able to enjoy the view shown in the picture because it rained the whole time we stayed.  The studio is small and modest, but nevertheless nice.  The building is secure and clean, so that is a real plus. We went to bed early, and are not noisy people, but there were strict rules about not being noisy.  The host/hostess were prompt about meeting us earlier than normal, which we appreciated. "
4082986,56370515,2015-12-13,45327089,Hailee,"This was my first Airbnb experience and Hadar made it perfect! Highly recommend him and his place. Amazing location, and it was extremely clean, and Hadar made it effortless. So grateful for the opportunity. "
4082986,56677592,2015-12-16,49389615,Stephanie,"We had a great time in Seattle. The studio was small but it was enough space for two people. Our flight arrived in the morning and Hadar was nice enough to let us check in a bit early to drop off our luggage before exploring the city. The Internet was not working the first day but Hadar fixed it by the next morning. Also, he was nice enough to help carry our luggage downstairs when the elevators were undergoing maintenance."
4082986,57014535,2015-12-21,29069908,Jeff,Hadar and his wife were very nice and the studio was perfect. Great location and very comfortable. This was our first trip to Seattle and it was perfect for us two. Definitely recommend if you want to be right in the middle of everything. 
7750477,57438430,2015-12-26,32372812,Lily,"We absolutely adored the place! It was extremely well furnished with everything we needed. Darrin gave us a call/text upon arrival and on the day of departure to ensure everything was sorted out properly. We had an issue starting the heater (even with instructions provided), however, we were able to figure it out. Thank you for your hospitality! "
7939058,43889838,2015-08-22,10079944,Bob,Nicholas was a great and responsive host. He has a very clean and modern unit with a great deck and master bath.  
7939058,45761237,2015-09-05,43220027,Abhishek,"Nicholas was a wonderful host! He responded promptly to my inquiries. The apartment is clean, minimalistic, and tastefully decorated (the picture is accurate). The bedroom is up two flights of stairs from ground floor and has a clean private bathroom with a comfortable bed. We needed an iron last-minute and Nicholas was quick to respond and let us use his! Parking is easy, right in front of the apartment on the street. He provided my wife and I with excellent breakfast recommendations. We noticed his interesting book collection on the way out, but because we arrived very late and woke up after he went to work, unfortunately didn't get a chance to chat with him more. Overall a great experience, would highly recommend the place."
7939058,46100475,2015-09-07,3263821,Gabriella,"Upon arriving at the location it seemed to be a little far away from anything and not within walking distance of any cafes or busy streets—but don't let that throw you. The area is very residential and Nicholas' place is set in a three story townhouse that's very new and modern on top of the hill. And after a quick look at Google maps you'll realize there is a great bus line just a five minute walk away and that if you're willing to walk uphill for 10 -12 minutes you'll hit North Queen Ann road that has tons of great breakfast spots, cafes, bookstores, and lots of places to wander in and out of. Overall his townhouse was clean and slightly minimalist, and as a host he is very gracious and willing to share the common areas with his guest.s"
7939058,46461473,2015-09-10,43507387,Charles,"Nick was a great host. My girlfriend and I were greeted with freshly washed towels and spotless apartment. Throughout the stay, Nick went out of his way to make us feel comfortable as we transitioned into Seattle. The place itself is beautiful, with a great bathroom and stunning rooftop deck. I would definitely stay here again if I could!"
7939058,46819571,2015-09-13,26230954,Evelin,This was my first time in Seattle and Nicholas was the perfect host. His place was just as described and it was very nicely kept. He was great at giving recommendations and just a great person to chat with. I would recommend his place. It is nicely located in Queen Anne and has a gorgeous view. Nicholas was great at responding to my inquiries immediately and was awesome at communicating anything a long the way. Overall great experience.
7939058,48793339,2015-09-28,3803550,Carissa,"We absolutely loved our time here. The apartment itself is brand new, super clean and in a great neighborhood. Nick was such a great host and gave us pointers on what to see/do while in Seattle. I would definitely stay here next time I came to Seattle."

Modern townhouse in an adorably quaint part of Seattle, tons of natural light and various options for outdoor relaxing in a balcony and huge rooftop deck (with wicked views). Nicholas himself was exceedingly charming and accommodating, making sure we had easy access to the house, all of the amenities we might need, and was never short of recommendations for waterside walks and the best restaurants. The flow of communication between guests and host was quick and clear. We've no issue recommending this place to anyone and everyone and hope to make it back one day ourselves!"
3791920,18501268,2014-08-27,10573354,Asheya,"The place was as described and pictured: a beautifully renovated 1 bedroom suite. The kitchen/dining/living area was larger than I expected, and I only wish we had enough time to use the projection TV! The bed was very comfortable, and there were enough blanket options that we weren't too warm or too cold. The kitchen does not have a stove, but it does come equipped with a a griddle, which was useful for frying an egg in the morning. Access to the suite was easy with the access code, and we really enjoyed this oasis in the midst of our busy lives. "
3791920,18908896,2014-09-02,20128172,Ryan,"We feel very welcomed. Jen and Dave are friendly and responsive. The description is accurate. Location is so perfect for first comers like me: close to U of W and downtown. To me, this can beat any hotel room."
3791920,19340944,2014-09-10,14779011,Nicholas,The place was amazing. Even better than the pictures show it. My only regret was that I couldn't stay longer. Close to the university and easy to get in to downtown. It made my work trip very easy. Thanks 
3791920,19426553,2014-09-12,20332989,David,"This space was exactly as pictured, and quite delightful for the price. Looked brand new and very clean. My partner and I felt welcome, safe, and had plenty of privacy (never even had to meet Jen and Dave personally). It's in a quiet and cute neighborhood in Seattle and easily accessible from the highway. "
3791920,19617866,2014-09-15,3562372,Matt+Renee,"We absolutely LOVED staying here! Walking distance to coffee & restaurants, and really well located for anything you want to do in Seattle. Parking was a breeze. The apartment was SO lovely! Even more gorgeous than the photos! Jen's instructions were so easy to follow. Plus, their high-tech tv system looked quite intimidating -- BUT they had a folder with step by step instructions (with photos!)on how to get hulu/netflix, watch dvd's, or even plug in your laptop! This is our 3rd air bnb rental in Seattle, and I think we will be back to see Jen again :) unfortunately, I was in a wedding so the weekend was hectic - we weren't able to meet in person but I hope to remedy that next time! "
3791920,19702263,2014-09-16,7251578,Josh,"I had a very positive experience at Jen's apartment. Communication was prompt, the apartment was clean and comfortable, and street parking was readily available. The small touches like the kegerator and an extremely comfortable bed made a big difference. I really enjoyed the automated code door, as I was in town for a short period of time with a lot of scheduled work events. This allowed me access to the apartment without interrupting my hosts due to my time constraints. Overall, I will look to stay here again when I'm in Seattle again. "
3791920,19885655,2014-09-20,4589554,Peter,"Of all the places I have been to using Airbnb in the United States, this was probably the most quaint and well kept of the homes. You live underneath Jen and Dave but never hear a thing. I did get a chance to meet Dave, and he was a fantastic host with plenty of suggestions of things to do in Seattle. Their location is perfect, and their home is very elegant. If I have the privilege to visit Seattle again I would surely hit them up to see what their availability is."
3791920,19945787,2014-09-21,20137228,Marc,It was the perfect place to stay for the night. We enjoyed the surround sound while watching tv on the projector.  Nicely decorated and spacious enough for 4. Thanks again!  
3791920,20512810,2014-09-30,535803,Jonathan,"Jen's basement apartment was fantastic.  Jen was their to welcome us and let us know not to be shy if we had any questions.  

Upon entering, the first thing you notice is how new and modern everything is.  Loved the furnishings and artwork.  Absolutely loved the kegerator and projection tv, with every gaming system imaginable.  

We only stayed one night, but would have loved to stay longer.

Thank again, Jen!"
3791920,20780061,2014-10-05,21576074,Marcy,Clean and big.  Great location.  Wonderful first airbnb.  Would stay again when in area.  Thanks
3791920,20959794,2014-10-08,16897596,Travis,"Our hosts, made my first Airbnb experience something that other stays will have to live up to. The basement suite is absolutely amazing. It looked as if no one has ever stayed there before us! I stayed with my girlfriend, and we aren't the most outgoing and appreciated not having to spend our short stay meeting and greeting our host. It made it feel that much more like we were staying at an expensive hotel!

 Though, from the great selection of books, DVDs games, and the like, I could tell they are some very cool people who are probably a lot like we are anyway! 

Jen, checked in part way through our stay to see if we needed anything, talk about top notch concierge service!"
3791920,21137539,2014-10-12,20828460,Melody,"The apartment was even more lovely in person, and the personalized recommendations included in the house guide were wonderful.  Although we didn't get to spend as much time in the rental as planned, it was definitely a very comfortable place to land at the end of a busy day.  Spacious, modern, home away from home.  Wish we could've stayed longer! Great first airbnb experience, thanks to Jen & Dave.   "
3791920,21514395,2014-10-19,4114056,Tori,"Jen & Dave were such amazing and accommodating hosts! We had a really great stay. The space was cleaner and more modern than the pictures show them to be. The electronics were fun and easy to use and Dave was so kind to have come down to save us with a little troubleshooting when the projector wasn't working. Jen was always extremely responsive to all of our requests. There were so many amenities in the place that really made us feel like we were right at home. It was quiet and just overall, a really lovely stay. The location was amazing, as well, as it was just a short drive to many of the places that we were visiting in Seattle. I'd definitely recommend checking this place out!"
3791920,22067713,2014-10-29,5125068,Scott,The apartment was just as it was described and pictured. We did not meet Jen but she responded very promptly to questions by e-mail. Location was great. Less than a mile from US5 and just a few miles from the University of Washington.  A nice selection of restaurants were nearby.
