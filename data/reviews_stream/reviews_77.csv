2472850,45994061,2015-09-07,39649836,Ken,"Teagen was very welcoming.  Although we never encountered each other in person, she communicated very well with directions. The location was approximately 10 minutes walking distance from the Seattle Space Needle so it was perfect for us.  The room was spacious for four people. The location could be a bit tricky to find but you just have to pay close attention to details.   "
8939306,51599947,2015-10-21,34209174,Amanda,"This is a great location- very close to the university! I wanted a place that would allow me to park the car at night and walk to restaurants and bars (which made this location ideal). I loved staying here because they provided a stocked breakfast kitchen. I could make myself eggs, yogurt with fruit (rasberries and blackberries), or eggs. Thank you so much for being kind hosts that were laid back."
8939306,51675726,2015-10-22,9112110,Hope,"The listing was brand-new and had only been up on Airbnb for two days. There were a few kinks that the hosts were working out -- getting wifi hooked up and putting a lock on the bathroom door -- that weren't completed when I stayed, but I have no doubt they have since been resolved. Ethan was the host and was attentive and considerate. There was breakfast food, coffee, and tea available in the shared kitchen for free, which was a nice touch. The neighborhood has many restaurants and coffee shops within walking distance.

The place is basically a boarding house for Airbnb guests, which gave it a youth-hostel vibe. I didn't mind at all, and liked the interaction with other guests. 

Free parking on-site is a big plus."
8939306,51871691,2015-10-24,47126119,Barnaby,Booked for a friend. Said it was a pleasant stay and had no complaints. Thanks Dario!
8939306,52370335,2015-10-28,21685527,Olga,"Our staying was great. University district is close to downtown, public transportation works perfect, so its easy to get to the downtown. The room was clean, clean towels and everything needed are provided.
The house is authentically Seattle house :)
Breakfast was perfect: tasty coffee, granola, cheese, fresh fruits were always in the kitchen."
8939306,52921833,2015-11-02,47265460,Cristopher,The area and school  was very nice.  The house looked very nice  as qell. The bathroom  was clean and kitchen had coffee. Great stay!
8939306,53231963,2015-11-06,17453944,Aviyah,"Ethan and Dario were cool as a polar bears toenails. Seattle was electric and the flowers were gorgeously decorated. The location was sweet, the security was on point and by the time you get there I'm pretty sure they would've upgraded even more."
8939306,53407956,2015-11-08,3363783,Anette,The room was really nice and the house was clean and nicely furnished. Location was perfect for my purposes. Communication with Dario and his host Ethan was easy and pleasant. 
8939306,53564921,2015-11-09,48085848,Peter,The room was clean and comfortable. Nice and quiet. I look forward to staying at Dario's in the future.
8939306,53637817,2015-11-10,41659757,Theresa,"The house is nestled in the middle of a residential neighborhood mostly populated by college students. As a result, you might overhear students talking loudly outside, or in the house next door late at night. This didn't bother me much as I had earplugs. The house appears a bit aged and scuffed, but the rooms were clean and tidy. Ethan was helpful in getting me settled into my room. There's bananas, apples, tea, coffee, and cereals provided in the kitchen. Overall, it was great value for the price."
8939306,54285267,2015-11-17,42645006,Bowei,"A really nice stay! The room was exactly as the graph shown and the bed was more comfortable than I assumed. There were lots of choice for breakfast in the house and they were awesome. The house is quite near from the University of Washington and I really enjoyed restaurants, public transportation, and post office in the neighborhood. The only thing I think it could be better is the temperature inside, which was a little bit cold for me."
8939306,54454863,2015-11-20,20475769,Kelly & Colton,"Dario owns multiple properties and I have had the pleasure of staying in two of them this past year.  Both of my visits were hosted by Ethan who is absolutely fantastic.  The Greek Island Room is located in the heart of the University District in a beautiful home with lots of character.  Ethan works very hard to maintain a clean, welcoming environment and it shows.  
"
8939306,55431075,2015-12-01,37857132,Jessie,Nice and clean in general. Ethan was very friendly and nice. Only problem was no lock in my bedroom (another guest actually came into my room by accident in the morning while I was in bed). Also occasionally heard some loud frat music late at night. There's also an odd odor in the house that made me personally uncomfortable with initially.
8939306,56126436,2015-12-09,7746050,Paula,Great price in a great location! Stayed for 2 nights. Appreciated the parking in the back and proximity to great food a few blocks away. Enjoyed the breakfast selection. When I had a concern it was quickly resolved. Highly recommend 
8939306,56351407,2015-12-12,43129803,Todd,"Great place, quiet, clean, very impressed"
2692126,17264785,2014-08-10,13933599,Cheryl,"I have loved living here. Kelly is really friendly and helpful. When I first arrived, she was welcoming and explained where everything was and gave me all the details about the house. She is easily accessible through text and responds quickly. She's also very respectful and gives me my privacy.

The house is older, but recently renovated and all of the furnishings are nice. Basically anything that you need is already here. There's laundry in the house, which is convenient. The house is pretty quiet in general. There's a separate entrance to the garden unit, so I feel like I have my own space, but it's nice to have other people in the house as well.

I really like the location. The neighborhood feels safe - I have no problems walking around by myself at night. It's also easy to get downtown and to other neighborhoods, like Fremont, which is where I work. It's fairly quiet here. It's nice to be in a convenient location, but not to feel like I'm living in the middle of the busy city. There's a grocery store about half a mile away and just beyond that is the Space Needle. Lake Union is just a short walk away as well."
2692126,17837316,2014-08-18,12476947,Abby,"It's going to be hard to describe how amazing our Airbnb experience with Kelly was, but, I will do my best. My husband and I were staying in Seattle for 8 nights, so we wanted an upscale accommodation without the expense and hassle (read: parking fees and children running through hallways) of staying at a hotel. Man, did we nail it when we chose to stay with Kelly. To begin, the pictures are exactly accurate. What you see is what you're getting. Kelly has created a little private, urban oasis in Lower Queen Anne, just outside of the City Center (space needle, emp, chihuly, etc). The apartment is equipped with a full kitchen with everything you could possibly need (except a muffin tin, but you can borrow hers), a table and 4 chairs for dining/we converted it into a great work space, a large bathroom with a luxurious shower (the pressure is unreal), a small living area with an Amazon fire tv, and a cozy bedroom with plenty of closet space and drawers. The bed is snuggly and the apartment gets good and dark for excellent sleep, not to mention it's amazingly quiet and peaceful amidst this bustling city. For us, the location couldn't have been any better. Queen Anne is so central and the vibe was clean and safe. We found that everything we wanted to do was a quick walk (coffee, restaurants and awesome supermarkets are 5-10 minutes away by foot), a short car trip or a cheap uber ride away. Kelly was an excellent host, extremely easy to communicate with via text, email or phone call and was able to answer all of our questions and give us local suggestions for restaurants and things to do. We felt like we were staying with a friend, but better, because though she was always around when we needed, she left us alone to enjoy our vacation as a couple. A sincere thank you to Kelly for a most enjoyable Seattle experience!"
2692126,18032661,2014-08-20,13360740,Katie,"Kelly was a great host and this is a clean, well-equipped, private apt near downtown. "
2692126,18316586,2014-08-25,1250819,Rebecca,"We had a great stay with Kelly! Her place was immaculately clean, wifi was good, shower was fantastic, and the bed was comfy. I appreciated the little touches Kelly added to make our stay extra nice. Access to her laundry room was a plus, too. The neighborhood is charming and well located for exploring Queen Anne, Belltown, and downtown on foot. Would stay here again!"
2692126,18581805,2014-08-28,6694906,Michael,Kelly has a perfect downstairs apartment in the popular Queen Anne neighborhood. It it very nicely appointed and she was extremely accommodating for all requests large and small. I would highly recommend the listing and can't wait to get back to Seattle! Thank you Kelly!
2692126,18881483,2014-09-02,17453566,Christine,I stayed here for a week and the location of the apartment is very convenient. There are bus stops five minutes away to downtown Seattle and the space needle area. Yet the  bedroom is very quiet and the location of the home is relatively removed from the hustle and bustle of Seattle. Plus if you like nature paths the apartment is ideal towards that as well as being near Seattle center. Thanks Kelly for letting me stay in your beautiful apartment!
2692126,19326551,2014-09-10,11089472,Joyce,Our trip to Seattle was wonderful and Kelly's apartment was everything you could ask for to make your stay comfortable. We loved Seattle and staying at Kelly's is the perfect area for exploring. We have stayed at several Airbnb apartments and this one tops all. Kelly was quick to respond to any questions we had about the area and offered some great tips for eating and transportation. The apartment was exactly as described with all of the extras you will need for your stay. The bed was extremely comfortable and we felt welcomed from the start. I highly recommend staying at this apartment on your visit to Seattle.
2692126,19437890,2014-09-12,8655686,Eric,"Good location - not far from City Center. Walking distance, about 7 minutes, to a wide selection of dining experiences and a super- market. Also, apartment is in a really nice residential section with peaceful and interesting places to explore.

Kelly made our first trip to Seattle hassle free. She acted as tour guide, with great recommendations for all places of dining and points of interest. Her patience and sweet nature shine through - she is especially accommodating ( she worked around our arrival schedule and left work early and got us settled).

Her apartment is immaculate and extremely clean. It feels cozy and quite inviting. Bed is comfortable and  new, bed sheets are rich and of a higher quality - great sleeping experience. Full kitchen with all the touches of home.

I gladly recommend this wonderful apartment to the airbnb world."
2692126,19541020,2014-09-14,6106060,Heather,"Perfect AirBnB experience! Kelly is very responsive and her house is just beautiful--great neighborhood with close proximity to downtown Seattle. Very clean and comfortable, the coffee, bear and chocolate were a treat too, thank you! Even better than advertised!"
2692126,19835861,2014-09-19,5096521,Serena You,"Kelly's place is very nice and clean and it look exactly like the pictures. Although I didn't get to meet her in person, she keep contact with me about everything and did some follow-up asking if I need anything. The bed is very comfortable and my dad also felt comfortable sleeping on the air mattress. "
2692126,20419146,2014-09-29,15237425,Sarah-Ann,Kelly was really friendly and helpful :) The Queen Anne neighbourhood is very lovely with nice cafes to check out. The house is clean and simple - we had all we need during our stay there :)
2692126,22064903,2014-10-29,2145033,Dennis,"Kelly is the nicest and sweetest host! She was helpful and easy to reach whenever we had a question. Thanks Kelly!

Her home is lovely, warming, very clean and equipped with everything a great home needs. You will have everything from towels to cooking utensils. Kelly's attention to detail is great. There's also a TV with an Amazon Fire TV for you to enjoy all your Amazon Prime music, tv shows, and movies. 

The location is ideal for anyone visiting Seattle. It's 10 minutes to everything. Coffee shops, grocery stores, food and transportation are all within a walkable distance. (I highly recommend getting an ORCA card if you're staying for a long period.)

Thank you Kelly for a great stay, a wonderful home and for making our experience in Seattle even that more special. You. Are. Awesome :) "
2692126,22765437,2014-11-14,22347070,Susan,"We have been spoiled by our first airbnb experience.
Kelly is a wonderful host. Her advice was useful and spot on.
The apartment was very comfortable, well appointed and had everything one would want including a washer and dryer. Kelly left fresh coffee beans from Cafe Vita that definitely helped start the day.
While the Queen Anne neighborhood is hilly, it is very convenient. It is walking distance to the Space Needle and a little further to downtown and Pikes Market. The bus is also nearby and fairly frequent.
Highly recommended!"
2692126,22966479,2014-11-18,9881980,Steve,"Kelly is an awesome host.  The place is flawless!  I would definitely stay here again (assuming it isn't already booked!).  Kelly was very accommodating with our check-in/out times.  Everything was smooth from start to end.  There's a reason why the reviews and ratings for Kelly and her apartment are so great.  Kelly does a superb job making you feel welcome and her place has everything you could need.  The photos pretty accurately depict the apartment.  It's super clean.  It is more than adequate for two people and I would say it could comfortably accommodate 4.  My wife and I have used airbnb a number of times and I have to say that our stay at Kelly's place has been one of the best experiences we've had. 

Thanks for everything, Kelly!"
2692126,23383009,2014-11-30,165390,Seth,"Absolutely loved staying here.  The tidiest airbnb I've ever stayed in.  Fully equipped, everything sparkly and new.  Handwritten note and a delicious chocolate bar from the local chocolate factory.  Oh, and the location is a few short blocks from everything you would need. "
2692126,25738176,2015-01-25,19285098,Aubrey,"Kelly was an amazing first airbnb experience.  Photos are accurate, she is so welcoming and gives you your space, yet always available if you should need anything.  Thank you Kelly for a wonderful place to stay.  I will look you up when I come back next year!  All the best to you!"
2692126,27869133,2015-03-14,15063961,Wil And Abby,"We absolutely loved staying at Kelly's!  She is super kind, helpful, and very, very accommodating. The apartment is just as it's pictured - warm, cozy and inviting.  It is also VERY clean, which we appreciated. The location is minutes away from coffee shops, grocery stores, restaurants and downtown Seattle. If you're not used to the area, the small streets and hills can take some adjusting to, but we were able to find parking nearby and drive wherever we needed to go pretty easily. In terms of the apartment itself, it is a great spot for a couple to stay. Do keep in mind that it is a renovated basement, so you can hear people outside and above pretty easily.  It didn't bother us too much but it is helpful to know if you are desiring a more quiet location. We had everything we needed from clean towels to a nice bottle of wine in the fridge! Kelly was just a text away if we needed recommendations for great restaurants or more paper towels :) My only negative feedback is that we didn't get a chance to meet her! "
2692126,28177960,2015-03-19,28316771,Xi,"I love the experience living in Kelly's. Her house is nice and neat. We rent a car when we were in Seattle and we could get space needle, kerry park and the coast very quick from Kelly's house. We were pretty satisfied by the location of the house. Besides, Kelly is really sweet and considerable. She even prepared travel books, cards and snacks for us.  I would recommend this house to you."
2692126,28643513,2015-03-28,1596046,Nancy,"Kelly gets a five star rating from us!  The garden level apt was just as described and pictured (if not better!).  Great kitchen, with some sweet perks from Kelly, and very very comfortable bed!  Lots of storage for our clothes, and even a washer/dryer that we were able to easily use.  We felt entirely at home!  Lovely neighborhood, walking distance to city center and public transportation.  When we return to Seattle, we will definitely stay here again!"
2692126,28794162,2015-03-30,27442725,Grace,The listing was very accurate and very true to the photos. Felt very welcomed and absolutely had all our needs met!
2692126,29130859,2015-04-04,24298653,Reid,"This apartment has great! Very neat, newly remodeled, had everything we needed. Kelly was inviting and attentive. I would definitely return!"
2692126,29754457,2015-04-12,7653975,Linda,Beautiful apartment. Close to everything. 
2692126,30443582,2015-04-22,13064957,Brittany,"Kelly is a fantastic host! She greeted us upon arrival, and so patiently waited while we navigated traffic with a lot of construction. Kelly has a wealth of resources for great restaurants and things to see in the area. The apartment was exactly as described and oh-so cozy. I really liked the individual room climate controls. The apartment is in the basement level, but the slope of the hill provides plenty of windows for light so it does not feel like a basement. The apartment is incredibly convenient to QFC, Trader Joe's and shops on Queen Anne Ave, as well as the Space Needle.
Kelly provides even more creature comforts than expected: coffee, nice smelling bath products, spices and herbs, and plush towels."
2692126,31235089,2015-05-03,15793999,Lorryn,"Kelly was a great hostess, the place was clean and the bed was comfy. She checked on me to make sure I had all I needed, which was appreciated. It was a very smooth check in and stay and I would not hesitate to stay there again."
2692126,31591527,2015-05-07,1105093,Lyset,My mom stayed here while visiting and absolutely loved the apartment. The apartment is fantastic and in a great location. Easy walking distance to the Seattle Center and restaurants. Kelly is also an amazing host. She checked-in on my mom to make sure she had everything. Definitely going to advise future visitors to stay here.
2692126,31775050,2015-05-10,19309309,Debra,"This is an amazing gem of an apartment with a wonderful host. I was visiting my daughter in Seattle for Mother's Day weekend and unfortunately she's moving to Chicago because I'd love to stay here again and again. The apartment is fantastic, newly furnished, thoughtful touches everywhere and tastefully decorated. In a wonderful Queen Anne location where we walked to Caffe Vita and Crow restaurant.  The best of all was Kelly- she is warm, smart and communicative.  I felt I was staying at a friend's place.  Fantastic!"
2692126,32239129,2015-05-16,5356023,Marion,Kelly was an amazing host. She's so nice And helpful. Her place is really comfy And beautifuly decorated. I would highly recommend it to anyone!  My parents loved staying there And they can't wait to be back!!
2692126,32596207,2015-05-19,32539237,Michael,"Wow! The accommodations exceeded our expectations and were even better then described on the site!! The location was great and nestled us right into the area with lots of options for food and site seeing. The owner, Kelly, was extremely courteous, helpful and nice and had everything we needed and more to cook and clean if necessary.  The bed was super comfortable and the apartment felt very spacious! We felt very safe in the neighborhood and loved coming back after a long day of sightseeing to this beautiful place!"
2692126,32858420,2015-05-22,2572824,Chiao-Wen,Kelly's place is wonderful. It is very clean and exactly as pictures showed on her listing. It has everything you need to a stay in Seattle. I got to meet with her and she is so nice!! I will definitely stay again next time I go to Seattle!
2692126,32968126,2015-05-24,15272521,Jennifer,"Kelly's apartment was immaculate and only about twenty minute walk downhill for a couple of avid walkers. My parents who are not as mobile appreciated the free, albeit first-come-first-serve parking. Kelly was always there with help and advice about the apartment and the city. The space was even enough for two couples with the double high air bed setup in the main living area. A+ airbnb. Slick check in and out. Highly highly highly reccommend "
2692126,33781730,2015-06-01,5901351,Jane,"My friend and I had a great time in Seattle! And the apartment was in the perfect location! The apartment was clean and cozy but had everything we needed. The bed was super comfortable. Street parking was a tad difficult to find on nights when we returned a bit late, but I think that's expected of nearly anywhere in the Queen Anne area, and we eventually found a spot within a couple of blocks. Although we didn't get to meet Kelly, she was always very easy to reach via phone/text and quick to respond, making sure we had everything we needed. Also super appreciated the complimentary dark chocolate bar! Thank you so much, Kelly!"
2692126,34307934,2015-06-07,22525803,Anna,"We had a great time at Kelly's place. The reviews were right on and the apartment was just as pictured. Kelly is kind and easy to deal with. Quick to respond and eager to help. The apartment was great. The bed was very comfortable, everything was clean and there was every thing you can possibly need on hand. I found the rate to be significantly cheaper than a 3 star downtown hotel and feel that this place and location was better. 

I'd stay again for sure. "
2692126,34643164,2015-06-10,13443412,Le,"Kelly was a great host. She made the apartment very clean, cozy and home-like. I was also welcomed by a sweet treat in the fridge and lots of great recommendations about local restaurants.

The online descriptions are accurate. All rooms are modern and simplistically stylish. All facilities are easy to use.

I also like the Queen Anne neighborhood. It is safe, quiet and in walking distance to Space Needle, Amazon and downtown. "
2692126,34930729,2015-06-14,23792629,Chelsea,"This was my first Airbnb experience, and it was absolutely fabulous! Kelly was very accommodating from the start, allowing us to check in much earlier (and on short notice!) so we could avoid lugging our bags around. She left a guide book (and chocolate, mm!), offered to provide any recommendations, and checked in to make sure we were satisfied.

The place itself was lovely, too. Adorable, quiet neighborhood, with Seattle Center just a short walk downhill (I was in town for the Rock 'n' Roll marathon, so this was especially pleasing to me). There are cute restaurants and a fabulous coffee shop very close by as well. The apartment was perfectly clean with nice furnishings and a kitchen fully-stocked with supplies!

I would highly recommend Kelly and her wonderful apartment to anyone!"
2692126,35535580,2015-06-20,25028528,Laura,"My husband and I recently stayed at Kelly's apartment during our anniversary trip to Seattle.  Kelly was an excellent host! She made us feel at home in her Queen Anne apartment.  The apartment looked exactly like the pictures and felt very cozy.  It was furnished well and had everything that we needed for our stay.  We also loved the neighborhood!  It was quiet, but not too far of a walk to great restaurants as well as the Seattle Center.  We tried several restaurants within walking distance of the apartment and loved them.  Crow and 5 Spot were two of our favorites!  We would definitely recommend staying at Kelly's place if you are visiting Seattle!"
2692126,35869254,2015-06-22,35717568,Brady,"This was our first AirBnB experience. The location was excellent, and Kelly was a wonderful host, even suggesting some really good local restaurants! The whole apartment was clean and very modern. The local is easily within walking distance of the Space Needle!"
2692126,35997740,2015-06-24,8818057,Jennifer,"Kelly's home is welcoming and exactly as pictured--so clean and well kept, I am a stickler for cleanliness and this place fit the bill! Kelly was very accommodating and let us check in earlier than we were scheduled, she left everything we needed including an air mattress. We really appreciated the washer/dryer which was SO convenient! The neighborhood was lovely and the grocery store was just a few blocks away.
I'd absolutely stay here again, my kids and I had a great time exploring the local parks and playgrounds, definitely a family friendly area. The Seattle Center is about a 20min walk away."
2692126,38099155,2015-07-13,28187310,Denny,"This was our first experience with Air BnB.  Kelly’s place was centrally located, clean and had all the amenities that one could possibly think of using.  Our room was really comfortable and we felt like we were at home.  The pictures on the web looked just like her place with plenty of space.  She was easy to work with and went above and beyond to please.  One a scale with one to ten with 10 being the best we would rate Kelly’s place a ten.  "
2692126,38733173,2015-07-18,6332538,Angela,"We absolutely enjoyed staying at Kelly's appartment. Everything as pictured and very clean. We loved the neighborhood and the recommended restaurants within walking distance. The appartment is perfectly located to explore Seattle! Situated in a lovely and quite neighbourhood, but at the same time just a 15min walk to Space needle, EMP museum and Monorail. We definitely recommend Kelly's appartment to enjoy Seattle!"
2692126,39546891,2015-07-24,37142527,Posi,"Kelly was so helpful with information about things to do and places to eat in and around Seattle. She didn't mind us arriving late in the night as we were coming in from Vancouver. The apartment is very beautiful, very nice floors and a super comfortable bed. She also had all the essentials setup in the kitchen and bathroom, which made our life so easy. It really felt like we were part of the city being so close to everything. I would highly recommend staying at Kelly's amazing space for any amount of time."
2692126,39902181,2015-07-27,27172360,Monit,"A fabulous experience in Seattle! The amazingly clean apartment had everything we needed for a supremely comfortable stay for three nights.  A really comfy bed, quiet and convenient neighborhood, and a kitchen with all the essentials made for a perfect home away from home. There is lots of room to spread out and the dresser was a personal favorite to reorganize my packing before heading to the Olympic Pennisula to hike.
Every connection with Kelly was friendly, professional, and timely from booking to checkout. This would be my choice anytime I visit the area again. No reason to hesitate. Book it!"
2692126,40307098,2015-07-30,6775232,Rasmus,Apartment was very clean at arrival. The neighbourhood was central and suited our needs very well. The kitchen was remarkably nice - everything new and good quality. Good relation between quality and price. Sometimes some foot step noise from the above apartment. 
2692126,40712334,2015-08-02,3988978,Nina,"Lovely, spacious downstairs apartment!!!  All recently remodeled with great taste.  Location was central for exploring Seattle, and we had no trouble finding street parking right nearby.  Kelly was very helpful and communicative throughout our whole visit.  Definitely would book here again."
2692126,41341309,2015-08-07,6762508,Nathaniel,"Kelly was a very welcoming and well organized hostess, and her place is super comfortable. Everything is clean, new, tasteful and beautifully maintained. The whole experience was very easy and seamless - she even had a bottle of wine set out for us when we arrived! Throughout our stay, she was very helpful and communicative. We would be happy to stay here again next time we're in Seattle. Thank you, Kelly!"
2692126,43260655,2015-08-18,3519154,Vincent,"We had a great time in Kelly's apartment. Check in and out was very easy and Kelly was flexible on the hours. The place was super clean, and had all the necessary kitchen appliance, linen, towels, soap... There is Fire TV, working Wifi and Netflix available. The place is in lower Queen Ann which was perfect for me since I was visiting friends in the area, easy to walk to the Space Needle and downtown. I would definitely recommend the place."
2692126,43667733,2015-08-21,39765971,Cindy,"The host made me feel extremely welcome.  It was as described and more.  Extremely clean, spacious, lots of closet space, TV with FireTV,
comfortable bed, at a reasonable price.  Great location, walking distance to downtown Seattle.  I would definitely return."
2692126,44309835,2015-08-25,12414663,Janet,"Immaculate, bright apartment in a great location. The whole experience from booking to departure was flawless. Would book again without hesitation. "
2692126,44783320,2015-08-29,20579210,Gigi,"Kelly was an amazing host. We had everything we needed for our week in Seattle and she was always available to answer questions via text. The location is conveniently located to downtown. There is a grocery store, cafe, and bar all within walking distance. "
2692126,45670390,2015-09-05,37445751,Dieu,Kelly made us feel extremely welcome.  Her place was nicely decorated and extra clean with all of the essential amenities (and more). She even let us check-in early and the lockbox was super convenient.
2692126,46794974,2015-09-13,3018757,Christine,"What a wonderful host! Kelly provided a very comfortable and clean apartment for my boyfriend and I during our weekend stay for the Seattle Cider Summit. The house is tucked into a corner of the block, in a quiet, Victorian neighborhood, with easy access to the highway, two blocks away. It was an optimal location for walking downtown, to the lake and to a moderate selection of neighborhood eateries. The night we arrived, we had a bit of difficulty finding street parking and Kelly was very polite in giving us a parking spot directly behind her car in the driveway so that we could relax and not have to walk several blocks with baggage after a long day working at the Cider Summit. We really appreciated the kind gesture."
2692126,47392886,2015-09-18,26479326,Claire,Beautiful home!  Had all the necessary amenities and Kelly was very nice :)  It's also in a great location!
2692126,47724709,2015-09-21,5326222,Joy,"Kelly's apartment was just as expected. A very nice space, nicely furnished and immaculately clean. Kelly was very welcoming to us and available if we needed anything. Even though she lives upstairs, we rarely heard anything - perhaps because we were noisy ourselves. 

Ordinarily with so many restaurants to choose from, we wouldn't have needed to do much cooking; however, with recent dietary restrictions we did end up cooking a few meals and the kitchen was well stocked with everything we needed, including olive oil, spices, etc. We had Saturday night dinner at The Crow (I love that restaurant) which was a pleasant walk from the apartment. 

Parking is difficult unless you get lucky but we always found a space, even if a couple of blocks away. A great alternative is Uber - reasonably priced and super efficient.

Kelly has a great place and she is a very gracious host. I recommend her apartment!"
2692126,53301886,2015-11-07,21472053,Eric,"Kelly's place was simply perfect. This was my first time as a guest through Airbnb and I can say that she has set the bar high for all other hosts. This is coming from another Airbnb host. In fact, I'm a Superhost, so I know what it takes to earn the coveted designation and the excellence that is required to maintain it. Kelly was there to meet me when I arrived in the evening. As I was reaching for the doorbell, I could still see her through the glass on the door making sure everything was perfect and set up just right. It was a rather cold  evening in Seattle so after walking from the train stop in downtown, I was freezing. Her place was warm and toasty and in the perfect welcoming condition for someone who was freezing with numb hands. Her place was as immaculately tidy as can be and utterly spotless. It was comfortable and super quaint and spacious too. The décor made it feel like home. The shower was hot and the bed was as comfy as my own bed, if not more! I didn't use the kitchen at all, but I saw that it was well equipped with everything you would need if you did any cooking. Kelly's place was in a quiet neighborhood. Before I booked, I thought I wanted to be more in a bustling area, but after staying in Kelly's place, I realized it was in the most ideal location. The noise level was immediately appreciated as there was none of it, so I slept like a baby. Quiet in the beautiful neighborhood of Queen Anne with its unique architecture and craftsman style homes, it was exactly how Kelly described it to be - only a short walk to the Space Needle and Chihuly museum and about a 20 minute walk to downtown. Once you're downtown, then pretty much everything else in Seattle is right around it. Kelly took her time explaining everything to me about her home and what to see and do in Seattle and how to get around. I was flabbergasted at how keen Kelly was to every detail. Kelly even managed to squeeze in a little time to play tour guide with me, but don't expect that all the time as she's such a busy bee! Kelly is the essence of all things a wonderful host is. She certainty sets the bar very high and I thank her very much. I can't recommend any more to stay at her place while in Seattle, it's the perfect place, and you'll have no regrets. "
2692126,53897782,2015-11-14,46719399,Huong,"This was a 1st AirBNB experience for my boyfriend and I. Kelly (and the place) blew away any apprehensions.  Prior to the trip, Kelly was quick to answer minor questions regarding availability of amenities and checked in with us during our stay, which was very kind. We stayed a full week and despite the chilly rainy November weather, did a lot of Seattle tourism. This apt in Queen Anne was ideally located for us to walk to/from downtown -- occasionally taking the bus when it poured.  Each night, we loved being able to come back to Kelly's place to relax. The neighborhood was very peaceful and safe.  Bed was  comfortable. Entire apt is tidy, modern, and spacious enough for us both. It was really nice to have separate kitchen / living room area and bedroom instead of a smaller cramped hotel room which would've cost more! We really appreciated the extra space.  Access to Laundry room was superb. Allowed us to do a load mid week which saved on packing extra clothes.  We would highly recommend this listing to anyone visiting Seattle!"
2692126,54281290,2015-11-17,11797710,Luanne,"Kelly and her cute and tidy apartment exceeded expectations!  It was perfect!  Great location, immaculate, charming, private - everything we needed for a perfect weekend in Seattle.  Kelly was there to meet us when we arrived and greeted us like old friends.  She supplied us with restaurant recommendations that helped us navigate all the Seattle choices.  
The apartment was tastefully appointed and equipped with everything needed to function in a full kitchen, should you decide not to take advantage of all the amazing food in Seattle.  We felt pampered as if we were staying in a four-star hotel with all the little extras that Kelly provided.
We would stay here in a heartbeat the next time we are in Seattle, as long as this sweet place is not booked!"
2692126,54616763,2015-11-22,31304199,Peter,"Kelly was so helpful and always available for recommendations. The house was perfect for my girlfriend and I, I couldn't have asked for anything better. Perfect location and set up, I highly recommend Kelly and her home. "
2692126,55198185,2015-11-29,21505036,Fran,We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Kelly's garden apartment.  The pictures she posted of the apartment were a true representation of this lovely space.  Kelly met us when we arrived and gave us a tour of the space making us feel totally at home.  The location was was perfect for assessability to Queen Ann shopping and restaurant area as well as downtown Seattle.  We would definitely ask to rent again.
2692126,55701174,2015-12-04,3532616,Samidha,"I enjoyed my stay at Kelly's apartment.  It's more like a 1 bedroom suite at a hotel versus a room since it has a kitchen, living room, and a separate bedroom.  The place is incredibly clean and has all the right extras (bathroom amenities, kitchen supplies, coffee etc.)  I also used the laundry which was very helpful when traveling and while I didn't cook, if you wanted to, the place was fully outfitted with tools and basic ingredients.  I stayed on business and it was very conveniently located but it would be equally convenient if you were visiting Seattle on vacation.  Highly recommended!"
2692126,56413024,2015-12-13,9488754,Michael,"Couldn't have been better.  Rooms well proportioned, kitchen and living room great.  Parking not as much a problem as anticipated, just have to look and walk a little sometimes.  Best part was how clean the home was.  Instructions on how to use TV would have been nice, although we didn't really need it, but for more music if those channels available.  Thanks, md"
7502246,40841994,2015-08-02,2059474,Jordan,"This cottage is cozy and adorable, and is perfectly located! It's a 5-10 minute walk to the main drag of Alki Beach, which is gorgeous and lively. Shauna provided some excellent nearby restaurant recommendations, like Duke's Chowder House. We also discovered a great vegan place, Chaco Canyon, a short 10 minute drive away. Downtown Seattle is a short hop by water taxi, and about 20-30 minutes by Uber/Lyft.

The place itself seems newly redone, and has plenty of space and privacy. We were very comfortable here!"
7502246,41280252,2015-08-05,2653504,Adam,"Shauna was extremely helpful in making the place available, as well as responding IMMEDIATELY to any messages through airbnb.  The place was a welcome change from a hotel, and although the inside of the cottage wasn't anything fancy (very basic really), it was nice to have a kitchen, laundry, fridge, spare room, etc.  Very clean place.  

Some improvements could easily be made (TV was on the floor and didn't work, there wasn't much as far as furnishings, no nightstands, no bulbs in front lamp), although I think the host happened to have been able to open the place up to us last minute, seeing as there were no previous reviews of the place.  I'm okay with it!  It was fun to explore West Seattle, and Shauna was very helpful.

Convenient West Seattle location, close to Alki beach, very safe neighborhood.  The hosts left us a City Pass booklet thingy of free Seattle tourist attractions, which was really nice of them to do! 

"
7502246,41504002,2015-08-07,11421972,Gary,"we had a great stay at he alki beach cottage, in one of seattle best neighborhoods just two blocks from the fun and lively waterfront area of alki beach. our hosts were helpful and very responsive to our concerns and needs.  for example, internet stopped working and they immediately set to work to get it restored within the hour.  the unit was very clean, simply furnished and well equipped for our stay.  a great place to stay.  "
7502246,41838482,2015-08-09,13571470,Rick,"This was not a welcoming airbnb. When we arrived there was a television (not hooked up) sitting on the floor, there was nothing on any of the walls and one room was entirely empty except for a futon frame laying in the middle of the room. To boot no light bulbs in the bedroom lamps. The place felt cold and bleak. Also this is ground unit. The listing said ""Entire House."" Expect to hear the owners and their dogs walking around upstairs. When the owners leave, the dogs DO NOT stop barking. 

The bed is like sleeping on a cot at summer camp. When I got in and rolled into my partner I just about peed my pants with laughter. At this point we just had to grin and bear it.

We spent half of our time trying to make it right and negotiating with Shauna and Ben, who were very pleasant face to face and who offered us a free nights stay.

We have never gotten our money back for the night free they offered and they won't text us back. Very uncool.

If Taylor Swift hadn't been in town we would have jumped ship and gotten a hotel but there were literally no rooms available!

Very much like a hostel. Not great for romance, chilling or relaxing.

Be weary traveler."
7502246,42331945,2015-08-12,10079051,Jodi,"This is a sweet little apartment in a great spot. It's just two blocks from the restaurants of Alki Beach but quiet and private. Shauna and Ben were great hosts: they provided a clean, comfortable space with many of the amenities. Though they live right upstairs they were very respectful of our space and were quick to respond when we needed help. I would definitely recommend staying here!"
7502246,42750390,2015-08-15,32724364,Caroline,"Fantastic stay at the Alki cottage. Great location, very clean, and wonderful hosts. We loved being able to bike to the ferry to easily get to downtown Seattle. Walked to restaurants, beach, etc. perfect!"
7502246,45020555,2015-08-30,42076266,Ashley,"Our stay was fantastic! Such a charming and comfortable apartment. Even nicer than the pictures! A couple of blocks away from Alki Beach, this home is easily accessible. It was immaculate and they even had guest Netflix! The dryer came in handy when we got caught in a downpour and needed to dry our clothes before we checked out. We definitely want to stay here again! It was nice having full privacy, but also nice to know that if something went wrong they were close by. Two thumbs way up!"
7502246,46803245,2015-09-13,35646779,Juliana,"This apartment was absolutely lovely: clean, bright, and quite comfortable. Many thoughtful touches made us feel right at home (such as the outside steps illuminated at night). Alki Beach neighborhood was a lot of fun and I would certainly stay here again. "
7502246,47190521,2015-09-16,10201408,Christina,We ended our tour of the NW coast here. This home was one of the nicest airbnb homes we have ever stayed in. It was beautifully clean and a short walk to the beach and right next to a nature trail. We loved Alki Beach the views of Seattle are spectacular and they had fire pits on the beach and we had a fire and berry pie on the ocean doesn't get much better than this! The water taxi was $5 each way and took less than 10 mins to get to pioneer square in Seattle.
7502246,47573841,2015-09-20,10131827,Michelle,"The Alki beach cottage was super clean and comfy. My 2 dogs thoroughly enjoyed the trails and parks nearby. It was a short and easy walk to Alki beach and the restaurants, too and the neighborhood was really nice. The bed was a little creaky but all in all our stay was fantastic. The Netflix access was definitely a plus as well! "
7502246,48714008,2015-09-28,40343105,Chad,"Our stay was very comfortable and cozy here, tucked back in a quiet neighborhood.  We were able to rest and relax.  It was a very easy walk to Alki beach where we were able to dine at several places, get drinks, and see some awesome views of the Seattle Skyline, mountains, and Elliot Bay!  Will definately stay here for our next visits to Seattle!"
7502246,50115495,2015-10-09,45022886,Ian,"The cottage was absolutely the perfect ""home-base"" for trekking around the city. Very close to the water cab to get downtown, walking distance from awesome restaurants, the beach and coffee shops. It was in a great neighborhood.

 The cottage itself might have actually been more space than the two of us really needed! Would absolutely stay again and totally suggest the space to any out of towners looking for a quiet place to lay their heads at the end of the day only a little ways away from the city."
7502246,50541202,2015-10-12,44919481,Stacy,We arrived to a spotless cottage that was not only adorable but even better.  The hosts had put in a second bed in the guest room so that my son wouldn't have to sleep on a futon.  The home is tucked away next to a great park and a community center.  It is completely private though...but less than a five minute walk to terrific restaurants and the beach!  We will come back every time we are in (email hidden) definitely exceeded our expectations
7502246,52146483,2015-10-26,34785088,Jennifer,"Absolutely a wonderful place to stay! Plenty of room for three adults and a lazy basset hound. Beautiful trail next door. This house is perfect if wanting to hang out along the coastline as it is just a few blocks away. We ate at Cactus, Pegasus, and Duke's all within walking distance. Recommend the water taxi when going to Pike's Market which is a short drive down the street. It only costs $5 per person and is very easy to navigate. Hosts were lovely and a pleasure to work with. Thank you for a wonderful experience! Would recommend highly!"
7502246,54018715,2015-11-15,10196458,Emily,"This basement apartment is generous in size and perfectly located near Alki Beach next to a great little park with trails and lots of restaurants, coffee shops, and bars just a few blocks away. It is confusing to find in the dark and there was some misunderstanding about my arrival date but the hosts were quick to get things in order and followed up with some extra cleaning the next day to make me comfortable. A repairman needed to visit while I was there and the hosts were great about communicating with me and even left a nice thank you note and gift card for the inconvenience. My only concern was noise from upstairs, which is understandable, but seemed to be late at night and I just hadn't read through all the reviews before booking to make note of that issue."
7502246,54544220,2015-11-21,4447834,Carrie,"We had a wonderful stay at the Alki Beach Cottage. My business partner and I needed to get outside the mess of the city for a few days to think through some challenges. I brought my pup, and he loved it too. :) We were greeted with a bottle of wine and a nice note from Shauna and Ben, which was a great touch. The location is about 3 blocks from the ocean and next to a beautiful hiking trail. The beds were so comfortable I slept in each day too. I would definitely stay here again. It's the perfect lightweight getaway from the city!"
7502246,54822393,2015-11-23,46816372,Joshua,"Shauna and ben were great hosts! Our group had a last minute cancelation and shauna and ben were able to accomadate us on very short notice.   the location was perfect, only a short walk to beautiful alki beach. Plus there were numerous coffee shops and places to eat right around the corner. If your looking  for a break from the big city and just want to relax, this place is just what the doctor ordered. Will definately be staying here again when we come back and visit"
7502246,55084057,2015-11-27,45860873,Heidi,"The beach cottage was awesome very cozy and comfortable. It's within walking distance to beach - ran along Alki great views in every direction. Very close to Starbucks (a must for me) and numerous great restaurants.
Will definitely stay in this gem again!"
7502246,55301957,2015-11-29,45860873,Heidi,This was our first experience using Airbnb so we weren't really sure what to expect. Our hosts were awesome they provided a welcome sheet with instructions and directions. The accommodations were amazing -the posted pictures did not do the cozy cottage justice. Our only regret is that we couldn't stay longer. When we plan our next trip to Seattle it will definitely include a stay here again.
7502246,57174397,2015-12-22,12502626,Dana,"We had a great time at Shauna and Ben's place for a one-night, in-city, girls' getaway. The place was less cozy than in the photos (on a gray day it was cold and the bare walls made it a bit sterile; we didn't realize we were renting a downstairs apartment). Nonetheless, we enjoyed cooking a full meal in the well-stocked kitchen and chatted the night away in the living room. We didn't hear a peep from upstairs; check-in and out was a breeze, and we felt welcomed by a sweet note and a bottle of wine."
7502246,57532332,2015-12-27,30320721,Chris,Great place: well maintained and clean. Would stay again. 
7547611,42626503,2015-08-14,3402929,Ilya,"The house is great: rooms are clean and furnished with taste. Helpful stickers (like wifi-access info) all over the place were very nice. Also it's very quiet in the house. Neighbourhood is nice and quiet, and in the same time there is a great bar next door :)"
7547611,44239251,2015-08-24,22058173,Renee,"Beautiful townhouse!  Kate was very welcoming and helpful.  I was visiting with my mother, daughter and granddaughter.  There was plenty of room for all of us.  The location in West Seattle was great - just 10-15 from the airport and downtown, a short ferry ride to see my son near Gig Harbor and many quaint restaurants and coffee shops close by.  "
7547611,45140380,2015-08-31,21954596,Peter,Easy check in. Nice and clean. 7/10.
7763613,45868398,2015-09-06,1768465,Ruel,"Angela was great! She met us to check us into the apartment and make sure we had everything we need. The location is prime, and walking distance to Pike Place and Capitol Hill (about 10m each way). The addition of a parking spot was a huge plus as we drove up from Portland. I would highly recommend anyone thinking of visiting Seattle to stay at Angela's place. I certainly will on my next visit!"
7763613,46216772,2015-09-08,40710980,Vinod,"We were in Seattle for just a day, so we really didn't want to spend time driving around and searching for parking. This apartment was a perfect fit for our needs as it is in a prime location: walking distance from Pike place market and a short 5 minute drive from the space needle.
Angela greeted us at the apartment entrance and showed us our parking spot in the garage. She then gave us a walk through of the apartment. Honestly, we didn't really use much of the amenities but everything looks as advertised.  Angela made us feel very comfortable and welcome.
If I were to visit Seattle again I would not hesitate to stay here once more."
7763613,47513784,2015-09-19,42642025,Sonia,"Angela was an excellent host--prompt correspondence, flexible, timely and very friendly. She gave us some info about the area and offered to answer ?s during our stay if we needed.

the location is excellent. little loud from the traffic--but what do you expect for being in the city!!  it was fine!  

the condo was clean, comfortable and exactly what we needed. 

I would gladly stay there again and/or recommend it to friends. "
7763613,48560903,2015-09-27,42600284,Wendy,"Angela was waiting for us when we arrived.  She showed us around the condo and also gave us tips on restaurants and fun things to do in Seattle.

The apartment was lovely and had everything we needed. there is a small store nearby which was handy for supplies."
7763613,51511982,2015-10-20,16378569,Paul,"A great Seattle apartment. Convenient location and much larger and roomier than the photos suggested (easily accommodated 2 couples). Steps away from great coffee, cider and beer - what more could you need! The rooftop patio was an amazing bonus - perfect for wine at night and coffee in the morning. Thanks Angela!"

There was a minor hiccup when we arrived-- we couldn't get in touch with Angela to access the building which was a stressful way to start our trip, but otherwise had a good stay."

7763613,55954475,2015-12-07,9536008,Katie,"Angela was an awesome host! We had a girls weekend to go wedding dress shopping and the condo was everything we needed. The place was very clean and tidy. It was a perfect location to walk downtown and close to many good restaurants, bars, cafes, etc. Angela was very accommodating with some special needs with my group and always responded promptly. Thanks for a great stay!"
7763613,56394259,2015-12-13,2069044,Tracy,"As our first time visiting Seattle, Angela's place made the perfect location for us to see and do all the touristy things around the city. Everything we could ask for was in a 15-30min walk. We tried to walk as much as we could if it wasn't raining - typical Seattle experience!

Her home was stocked with everything you could need. I even forgot my shampoo, but of course, she had that covered as well! I also loved visiting during the holiday season since she also had the place decorated - complete with a Christmas tree! Felt very homey."

The only thing is that we were woke up by some loud noise from the heater every night. The house is clean as a whole except some few dusts on the sheets."
7763613,57726806,2015-12-28,22631197,Jack,Angela was great! And her place was unbelievably convenient. Definitely a perfect place for central city living with the comfort of home.

7362757,40185705,2015-07-28,38393551,Carmina,Elena was an amazing host. The place was exactly as listed and she even included toiletries which was an added bonus since I had forgotten to bring my own shampoo and conditioner. She lives upstairs so that was nice too because I was able to meet her when we came and checked in. I would definitely come and stay again! 
7362757,40287887,2015-07-29,13454104,Dave,"Elena  has a very nice apartment. She met us upon arrival, and we did not spend much time in the apartment,but had all the comforts of home, with flat screen TV, strong wifi, coffee maker with a large selection of teas, chocolate, coffee, bathroom amenities,nice comfortable bed. The futon couch/beds were perfect if you have children and/or  extra guest. Highly recommend for the price so close to the high lodging expense of Seattle!!"
7362757,41149912,2015-08-04,9251681,Keith,"This is a lovely space in a vibrant, diverse neighborhood. It's close to major transit options, a wide variety of multi ethnic shops and restaurants. Elena is warm and welcoming and is easy to communicate with."
7362757,41475281,2015-08-07,18334204,Christopher,"Quaint, quiet spot.  Location convenient to some amenities.  A walk up the hill and a look over the lake is nice.  Elena was easy and pleasant.  Great communication before and after to make sure everything was good."
7362757,41846832,2015-08-09,39616322,Cindy,"Hello Everyone,

This was my first time using Airbnb. Staying at Elena's place was a wonderful experience and she was a great host. Elena's apartment is very clean and it was nice to stay in the remodeled unit.  My trip to Seattle was so much more enjoyable knowing that you will have a nice comfortable place to sleep, cook, and relax.  I highly recommend Elenda's place.   

Cindy :)"
7362757,42029199,2015-08-10,38182698,Sean,It was a wonderful quaint place that was in a very quiet neighborhood! Really fast uber rides to downtown and back! Everything was so clean and Elena was so nice and helpful? wish we could've met but we had different schedules! Can not wait to return to Elenas! 
7362757,42188912,2015-08-11,31188235,Joanne,"The place was exactly as described.  Very clean and quite comfortable.  Elena was friendly, easy to deal with and helpful with directions.  The neighbourhood was not quite what we were expecting but it was quiet and easy to get around.  We enjoyed our stay.
"
7362757,42321450,2015-08-12,3691508,Bryn,"We are a family of four, two of who are small children and found Elena's space perfect for a quick stay the night before an early flight out of Seattle. The apartment is less than twenty minutes from the airport and was easy to get to from downtown and Lake Washington by car.

Elena's space is new, comfortable and as clean and modern as it is depicted in the photos. The space is uncluttered by knick knacks and very peaceful. That said, Elena has outfitted the space with all the necessaries to make her guest's stay easy and pleasant. 

We were only there briefly and Elena's communication was quick and unobtrusive. We also appreciated her checking in with us personally which she took the time to do. We would certainly stay there on future trips to Seattle."
7362757,43530338,2015-08-20,39475349,Lara,Wonderful experience. Elena greeted us upon arrival and was incredibly welcoming. The suite was perfect for our needs. Fresh towels and more water was provided half way through our stay. Easy access to the interstate. Would definitely stay here again
7362757,43690483,2015-08-21,24970843,Ira,"The host was very responsive to my emails and texts. Was willing to work around my arrival time. Place was very clean and roomy. Bottles of cold water in the fridge was a nice bonus.Well equipped bath room.
Two fans were available and windows opened for a nice cross wind.
The area is all private homes, so no stores or restaurants in walking distance, but they do supply a full kitchen and Kuerig coffee maker. "
7362757,44328135,2015-08-25,39471733,Edward,"the apt is very nice and clean! full kitchen is very useful!! brand new furnitures, wow!! short drive to the Washington lake, there's a very nice park for evening walk. 4 of us had a great time staying there. Elena is very nice to work with and prompt in reply too!"
7362757,44451443,2015-08-26,421130,Dana,"Elena was great, a wonderful communicator who provided everything we needed in a clean, cute apartment. The place was very conveniently located about half way between downtown Seattle and the Airport, making it perfect for our last night visiting Seattle. We loved the Netflix access on the t.v. and the futons were perfect for my two (grown) kids and the queen bed perfect for me. By the way, those blankets were the softest EVER!  Great experience for us all."
7362757,44945026,2015-08-30,39635273,Rachel,Elena's place was very clean and modern.  Great place to stay.  Easy commute to downtown.  We were greeted upon arrival and made to feel welcome.  Would stay here again!
7362757,45204311,2015-08-31,36144674,Elizabeth,"Elena was a fantastic host! We were visiting from Vancouver Canada.
The place was absolutely fantastic. Super clean and everything looked brand new.  I would definitely recommend this place and I will stay here again.
The layout, design of the apartment was great!
Thank you Elena for hosting us.

7362757,45691632,2015-09-05,40554039,Kathy,"I really enjoyed my stay and Elena was great. The apartment was exactly as pictured and very nice. The sheets and blankets were very soft. We appreciated the water in the fridge and the coffee. The location was good - close to a major highway that went to the airport, downtown Seattle, and Vancouver."
7362757,46151242,2015-09-08,7156691,Eleni,"We had a great stay at this place, it was very comfortable and homey. The unit looks brand new and was extremely clean, and the water bottles in the fridge and Keurig coffee were nice touches. Elena was prompt and helpful in our communication. They keypad entry was a convenient feature, as it allowed us to arrive late and leave early in the morning without having to physically exchange keys. I would stay here again."
7362757,46293566,2015-09-09,21867039,Caitlin,"Elena was responsive and very accommodating during our stay, even when we arrived 2 hours early.  The space was beautiful and clean - nicer than a hotel!  Would highly recommend for anyone looking to visit Seattle."
7362757,46494165,2015-09-11,4090183,Georgina,"The flat is modern, clean and well appointed. The host, Elena, is lovely and made us feel very welcome. "
7362757,46899242,2015-09-14,39832087,Navjot,"Elena was such a nice host. This was truly the best first airbn experience anyone could have. The apt was just as it was described, and Elena did everything she could to make our stay the best. I will defentiely be coming back to this place the next time I travel Seattle. "
7362757,47265901,2015-09-17,31247166,Mary,"I agree with previous reviewers that the apartment is utterly clean and fresh feeling. Elena graciously greeted us, gave us some restaurant tips that were right on, invited us to ask if we needed anything, and then gave us our privacy. The neighborhood is surprisingly quiet, given its metropolitan setting. It's also easy to get to, with arterials nearby and a straight shot from the freeway. Easy parking. Public transportation is handy, too. I hope to stay here again. "
7362757,47377606,2015-09-18,15696518,Alex,"We had a great stay in Elena's apartment. My fiancée and I stayed with my sister and her boyfriend for a night.  It was the perfect space for the four of us, as well as a great location!  My fiancée and I took the bedroom and my sister and her boyfriend were more than content with the two comfy foldout sofas. We could jet into downtown Seattle in one direction, or take a beautiful, lakeside drive over the hill in the other direction.  There was plenty of off street parking for both our rental cars, a carport even, and easy passcode access to the apartment door. Elena was quick to reply and very accommodating. Definitely a peaceful, easy place to stay for a couple days in Seattle! "
7362757,48528440,2015-09-27,40214994,Daniel,We had a great time at Elena's! It was the perfect location from us only 20 minutes bus ride from downtown Seattle and a 5 minutes walk from the park and the lake. Elena was a great host we had a longer than average stay for an Airbnb(9days) which she made a point to bring extra waters and make sure we had supplies for the keurig she has in the apartment. 
7362757,48758347,2015-09-28,19759466,Frank,Great place! Would stay again.
7362757,49011060,2015-09-30,41320236,William,"An absolutely amazing place to stay! Stayed the weekend for the Seahawks and Mariners game. $5 Uber trip or 20 minute walk to the Othello Light Rail station made it super easy to travel to and from Seattle. The food in Columbia City, about a 15 minute walk north, is unbelievable!! Enough about the location though, the suite was great! Super clean, very cozy, and the fold down couches are really comfy as well. I'll definitely be staying here again, if not for the access to Seattle, then definitely for the food right there close by."
7362757,49327539,2015-10-03,37723137,Steven,"We found this suite to be perfect for our stay. It was clean, new, and comfortable. We met Elena she was very pleasant and she wanted to be sure everything was good for us. No worries Elena! 
"
7362757,49609122,2015-10-05,23339088,Cassondra,"My first airbnb ever and loved it!! Would definitely stay here again.
The place looks just like the photos and smelled good and was sparkly clean and felt homey. Extra blankets and pillows helped with the seattle chillyness. The Kerig and water bottles were such a nice touch that were a great surprise. There is a blow dryer too! I liked the keypad instead of having a key to keep track of. 
This location was close to downtown about 20 min lyft rides.
Thank you Elena for being a great host!"
7362757,49893356,2015-10-07,35738819,Justin,Really nice little place. Host had plenty of towels and even some toiletries which came in handy. Most important to me is that it was super clean.
7362757,50020763,2015-10-08,21025914,Cindy,"Elena was very timely with her communication and response! Upon arrival, I contacted her about our trip back from Victoria Island and the delay from getting across the border. She was nice enough to give us the passcode when arrived later in the evening without having to be there at a set-time. There was a carport space available for us to park off-street. The area is closely secured so we felt safe with our belongings there. When we entered the apartment, it was pretty spacious and newly remodeled exactly how it was described in the listing. Elena was very nice to leave out new toiletries (even though we brought our own)! There were plentiful of clean towels, bottled waters in the fridge, coffee and a Kerig. There was Wi-Fi, flat t.v, two futons, the room was also very nice and accommodating. The décor was modern, neat, clean, and most of all, heating was available since it was freezing in the morning. She even offered us to stay a bit later past check-out since she did not have another guest for the day (but we had a busy travel schedule so we couldn't stay longer). This was probably our best AirBnb experience so far. I will look up Elena's place again in the near future when I am in the area. Thank you, Elena! "
7362757,50628244,2015-10-13,32936187,Sesta,We are very pleased with Elena and the apartment! It was comfortable and super clean. There are many nice touches including a Keurig. Elena always responded promptly. The neighborhood is quiet and safe. Seward Park is close by and a wonderful area to walk and play. We travel to Seattle to visit family regularly and hope to be able to stay here each time. 
7362757,50814133,2015-10-14,29855626,Jon,"Our stay at Elena's MIL Apartment was great! We flew into Seattle to explore and made our way to her place that evening without difficulty via a rental car.  Traffic was manageable and it seemed to be a 10-15 minute drive from downtown Seattle. Elena was quick to respond to questions and to provide feedback as requested. Her place was so clean, bright, and welcoming! We really enjoyed having the comforts of home that the MIL Apartment provides! "
7362757,50858423,2015-10-15,27736890,Naomi,Elena was quick to respond and it was easy to book with her.  The apartment was very clean.  We were in town for a music show in Columbia City.  The house was about a mile from the location and on a steep hill.  The neighborhood was ok.  The apartment was quiet and overall we were very happy with it.  
7362757,51056054,2015-10-17,44923141,Elena,"The host Elena was great, very helpful. The neighborhood was quiet & central. Perfect location."
7362757,51906501,2015-10-25,36919957,Lily,"Elena was a great host. The area is minutes from great restaurants and shops in Columbia city.  The space was clean and well-prepared for up to 4 guests, probably more. Elena was very communicative prior to our arrival, which was reassuring. Overall, this is a fantastic option for anyone looking to stay in south Seattle! "
7362757,52186585,2015-10-26,26392683,Freddie,The apartment was as described! Really beautiful and comfy. Elena was great and super helpful and attentive with us. 
7362757,52330102,2015-10-28,8724555,Jena,Elena was a very communicative and considerate host! Her place is very tidy and welcoming. She had coffee and water available for us. The bed and towels and blankets were very comfy and the location was very cool! Lots of international stores and coffee shops. It was directly off a main road and very easy to access the rest of the city from. Thanks for having us!
7362757,52715300,2015-11-01,45123538,Mila,Elena has made us feel welcome. We had nost of what we need when we got in the apartment..Her place looks chic..Beds are comfortable. Place is clean.. i felt comfortable.....
7362757,52893814,2015-11-02,37729695,John,"Had a great stay!  Not sure how it was possible, but the space is even more cool (cooler?) in person.  Everything was very smooth from start to finish.  Elena printed out a list of local restaurants etc, which we definitely used.  Always on the lookout for good breakfast spots and the recommended restaurant in Columbia City was awesome.  Just a great place to stay!"
7362757,53201423,2015-11-06,44704403,Ellen,"Great location, clean and comfortable, a home away from home. We would not hesitate book this apt again.  Easy access to the many neighborhoods in Seattle."
7362757,53585718,2015-11-09,26527831,Angela,Elana'a apartment was just what we needed.. and fast! She responded very quickly to a impromptu trip to Seattle. The apartment is very clean and modern and is as pictured. Great water pressure in the shower as well! Very close to downtown seattle about 15 min drive it was a great stay!
7362757,53765662,2015-11-12,18843175,Jacqueline,"My two friends and I were looking for a two day shopping trip in Seattle. With three of us us it was going to be very expensive to stay in a hotel.  Elena's place was perfect for us, With three seperate beds ( 2 are fold out) and a nice large bathroom and a kitchen area for our 'snacks '. The unit is exactly as described clean and inviting.  It was very nice to find coffee pods and bottled water in the fridge when we arrived after our long drive.  The drive into Seattle was pretty quick too.   We didn't look around the neighbourhood but the place was very easy to find and so nice to park right in the driveway.  "
7362757,54846496,2015-11-25,27798276,Fabio,"Very nice apartment. Elena was very kind and helpful. She came to see if everything was ok when we arrived. Apartment clean and well equipped. I recommend. Certainly, I intend staying again this apartment in the future. "

The full kitchen and lounge area are great features and we made use of both. Location is very convenient, everything around Seattle is about 15 minutes away. Would definitely stay again when in Seattle!"
7362757,56458765,2015-12-13,42519548,Meg,The home was beautiful and in a great location!  We will definitely stay again! Thank you so much!
7362757,56506445,2015-12-14,37729695,John,2nd time we have stayed there.  Is better in person.  Great place!

7362757,56691866,2015-12-16,18902176,Brendan,"Where do I start? Well, everything that you see in the photos is even better in person! Also, Elena's communication was very professional and informative. When we arrived Elena came to meet us, asked if we had any questions, and gave us some suggestions for where to eat in town. It's only about a 15 minute drive to the heart of Seattle (there is also a bus stop 2 blocks down the street) where you can find some outstanding food! Elena is a registered nurse and it shows, the apartment was absolutely spotless! We had a lovely stay and were both bummed that it was only for one night. We will definitely be back and recommend that you stay here as well! Thank you Elena!"
7362757,56724880,2015-12-17,7716133,Ray,Somehow our travel plans got delayed and we didn't get to Elena's place until five in the morning and since we were leaving the same day in the afternoon it was really special to get to a place that was warm and inviting.  Elena's was just that.  It is decorated very well and just felt simple and like home.  Unlike some basement apartments we have stayed in Elena's has it's own heat system and is well insulated for sound.  You would have no idea there were people living above you.  The apartment was also well stocked with amenities so though our stay was pretty short we were able to come in make ourselves at home and enjoy the few hours we had in Seattle.  
7362757,57396077,2015-12-25,35745634,Yuli,Elena's place was very comfortable! We arrived pretty late (past midnight) but the key less entry was convenient. The apartment was very spacious and it had everything we needed! I loved using the Keurig machine and Elena even provided creamer and water in the fridge. 
7362757,57886909,2015-12-30,45634780,藤本,"We enjoyed staying in Elena's clean and comfortable apartment at 28 Dec 2015.we(3 guys) slept night very well because there were 1betroom and 2 extra sofa beds. Elena was so kind she offered us using extra blankets.Thank you very much Elena.
Location was also very good.The neighborhood was quiet residence area and there was a convinient store near the apartment."
2556794,25386146,2015-01-14,24672470,Dennis,"A warm private suite that has all the essentials and convenient to airport and downtown.  Mike and Mike are like friends now after getting to know them.  You will find this to be a perfect getaway or even for a few transitional months,

Thanks for the great hospitality and friendship.  Keno and I left are keeping great memories here. "
2556794,27952116,2015-03-15,4151782,Tim,"Wonderful guest house, had everything we could need, very private. Didn't interact with the hosts too much while staying here but when I did they were both very pleasant. Would definitely recommend"
2556794,28629151,2015-03-27,29632819,Nike,"Wow! After a decade of staying at the same nice hotel this was paradise comparatively. My hosts were absolutely delightful, generous, warm, kind.  The guest house was an absolute delight. It was everything it claimed to be in the listing and more. Every thing was easy.  My hosts made it easy. I had a hectic work schedule and coming 'home' was a joy.  It is a quiet home in serene surroundings. The garden/yard backed onto a what looked and felt like a forest.  At night the scented bushes absolutely filled the air with their glorious aroma. I actually wondered if down-sizing and moving in on a 12 month lease would be a viable option! Thank you."
2556794,31036604,2015-05-01,27871041,Harold,"Mike & Mike were very pleasant to deal with and very accommodating. 

The apartment was as described, very clean, an well appointed. 

The location is quiet with a nice outside deck. It is close to downtown and freeway access is convenient. 

Overall, it is a great place to stay "
9820818,56981662,2015-12-20,9994696,Margaret,"This place is great and perfect for what we needed. Melissa emailed to see if there was anything she could do to make our stay more comfortable. The house is immaculately clean. Linens and pillows were high quality and very comfortable. Melissa is very well organized and provides all necessary information about the house and its amenities as well as extra information about local eateries and such. Although we didn't get a chance to take advantage of this, the provided bikes/helmets and trail that runs right by the house is a huge bonus. The neighborhood seemed pretty quiet which is nice. We would love to stay here again."

Gracias!!"
6401209,41943148,2015-08-10,25077865,金,"Great 10 nights in Plum House! Nice house design with luxury and comfortable facilities made us totally relaxed and can help loving this fantastic home! The hot tub on the roof is the best way to spend the whole afternoon! The only one thing that I feel regret is that we didn't have chance to cook in the house because of our itinerary, the open kitchen is amazing!"
6401209,42842004,2015-08-16,33838902,Tricia,"We had a wonderful stay at the Plum House.  My husband, 12 year old daughter and I joined my 70+ year old parents, brother and sister-in-law and their 3.5 year old son for a relaxing time in Ballard.  The home is beautiful, spacious, very comfortable and its location is convenient.  There is a grocery store and park within walking distance and the home is equipped with everything we needed for our 4 day stay.  We took in Seattle Reign and Seahawks games and enjoyed the Woodland Park Zoo (less than 10 minutes away), Pikes Place Market and the Museum of Flight.  ""Downtown"" Ballard is within walking distance of the home for fun shopping, great food and entertainment. 

Thank you Mercy for a wonderful stay.  "
6401209,43373112,2015-08-19,35911752,Tom,"When we first signed up to stay at Plum House we were a little afraid that the listing might not be as good as advertised. But when we got there, my wife and sons could not have been more pleased or excited about the accommodations. The house is spotless and full of modern character. There is a lovely rooftop deck where you can enjoy a dip in the hot tub or stargaze at night.  We loved picking vegetables from the garden in the back yard. And the Ballard neighborhood has lots of good restaurants and fun nightlife within walking distance. "
6401209,45083863,2015-08-31,36265283,John,Mercy sent us a welcome email with some detailed info about the house and the area.  The house is on a quiet block but only a short walk to everything.  There is a supermarket two blocks away and pubs and restaurants are only three blocks.  The house is lovely.  We felt very comfortable.  Plenty of room (there were 7 adults).  House was very clean and beautifully maintained.
6401209,46123910,2015-09-08,27324994,Bill,The Plum house was great. Very well organized and convenient to all of the interesting things in Ballard.  The house is beautiful.
6401209,47674025,2015-09-21,39242678,Ryan,"Our group of 7 guys stayed 3 nights at Plum House, and could not have been more satisfied!  Mercy was very easy to communicate with pre-trip, and also while we were there. 

The house was in great condition and clean, had a nice contemporary feel, and some really cool green concepts.  There is a perfect mix of common space and private bedrooms.  The kitchen is glorious to cook in and socialize at the same time.  The roof top deck is a great touch for a relaxing view.

The house was ready with everything we needed, from food and cooking supplies to bedding to cold beer to produce in the garden.  The reference book was carefully prepared and we used it several times. The neighborhood is very quiet, no issues with traffic noise. Groceries, restaurants, breweries, bus line, and car rental are all in walking distance.

Several times our group commented on how the house was way better than the hotel option, and also how Plum House was more than expected from the airbnb listing.   

This was my first time using airbnb, and I hope every time going forward is this easy and rewarding!  Thank you for opening your home to us!
"
6401209,50093206,2015-10-09,32883221,Axelle,"The neighbourhood where the house is located serves perfectly to get to know Seattle and its surroundings without the noisyness and busyness of Seattle. The area is perfect for breakfast and has grocery, bakery and bars all in walking distance. The house was lovely and spacious for a family of 7 accomodating all needs. And to add some loveliness to it, there was a nice garden in the backyard."
6401209,51153261,2015-10-18,1801113,Isaac,"The home itself is open and inviting, and it was kind of amazing to be in the middle of Ballard for the weekend. A lovely loaf of bread and jam awaited us in the kitchen, which kicked things off nicely. The guest binder was very organized and included far more information than I expected, too. Easy connection to the audio receiver to play music via Bluetooth, ample guest linens, and more. Our group loved staying at the house during our conference and I look forward to staying there again if the opportunity presents itself. Thanks, Mercy!"
6401209,53664229,2015-11-10,43375275,Monica,"The house was great! We lived the location, it felt like home. This was our first Airbnb experience and we will definitely do it again. Thanks!"
6401209,54515423,2015-11-21,8021,Becky,"We decided to rent Plumb house for a designers work offsite... we were looking for a local space that would be condusive to brainstorming/sketching/talking and bonding with our team.  One of our teamates flew in from Lyon,France and two other team members choose to stay on site throughout the week instead of driving back and forth from their homes.  The rest of us lived within short walks and mainly stayed onsite just during the days/evenings.  The house was absolutely perfect!  we were able to do slideshows of our photo research and watch vidoes from the TV in the den.  We spread out across the sofas with all our samples and created elaborate sticky note assemblages on the sliding glass doors!  At the beginning of our stay the host sent someone to check in and fix the levels of the hot tub for us! very nice and we made use of it to unwind after the long days.  This really was a perfect space for our needs and we especially appreciated being such a short walk to cafe Besalu for espresso 'pick me ups' and old ballard for our evening meals.  The space was clean.  incredibly well organized. Very comfortable and nicely designed/laid out.  The kitchen was especially lovely... and definitely inspired words of envy from more than one of our team.  We appreciated having access to such a perfect space and would recommend it highly to any group looking for a place to land in the area.  The only drawback is the high cleaning fee ... makes it worthwhile only if you stay for a longer time frame like we did."
6401209,55276880,2015-11-29,23326251,Lipeipei,"Mercy is very nice and supper quick in responding. The house is beautiful with warm wood heated floors. Ballard is one of the best neighborhoods in Seattle with many popular restaurants and shops. I liked the apartment and the location a lot. 
However, we did have some problems during our stay. When we arrived first at night, the entry door key code was wrong so we had to wait for Mercy to respond, when she is in a different time zone. (She told us that her housekeeper forgot the change the code.) Somehow the doors to the terrace cannot be locked and we were not able to access the rooftop deck due to the broken door lock during our stay. Mercy was very nice and apologize to all these but with all the accidents, our stay was not the best or not very pleasant. Also, I was expecting four bedrooms with four beds, but it turns out that I have to switch one of the sofa to bed. It is the first time that I was asked to do a load of laundry (towers or sheets) before I leave when I got charged for $200 cleaning fees. I guess for use, the overall experience is not worth what we paid for. 
So if you are looking for a beautiful house and nice area, this is definitely a good choice but just make sure to check if everything is working."
6401209,57626334,2015-12-28,25770572,Ellyn,"The Plum House is a wonderful place to stay. Although there were only six of us, we often entertained twelve extended family members for dinners. The open design with the kitchen, living room and dinning room, create an easy place to host nearby relatives. There are 3 bedrooms and 2 full baths upstairs and a TV room that converts into a 4th bedroom on the main floor with a half-bath. The hot tub on the roof was a welcome addition. There is a deck off the main floor and a nice sitting area on the roof. It would be a great place to stay in the summer, where one could take full advantage of the deck and roof. In summary, this is a great place to stay in Seattle, and wonderful for large gatherings. Only caveat, we did wake up every weekday morning at 7am to construction noise across the street. This also created congestion for street parking. I suspect this will be done by spring."
2350464,10886174,2014-03-11,12339089,Neal,"Great home, great neighborhood.  Really felt like we were locals in the community for a few days.  "
2350464,11054310,2014-03-18,12322034,Alison,The house was amazing & made our weekend that much more enjoyable. Bojana was very quick to reply to all our questions & was very helpful. She has a really lovely home. 
2350464,11151787,2014-03-23,11369493,Laura,"What a fabulous home and location! Not to mention our host: Bojana was kind, timely and thorough with her responses to my questions and the instructions for the home were clear but succinct.  We LOVED cooking in the beautiful kitchen and even hosted a small dinner party with ease and comfort.  Views from the master suite were unbelievable and the fire place so elegant! Within minutes driving we could be in city center, or along a strip of local boutique shops and delicious restaus.  Definitely a prime location for our family's needs, including a short walk to Volunteer Park which overlooks Seattle!  We would definitely recommend this home and host, and hope to visit again in the future.  Bojana and family, thanks for making our trip to Seattle so comfortable (not to mention a success- I got major family points for reserving your home!)   :)"
2350464,11993998,2014-04-21,5913398,Tanja,What a pleasure it was to stay in Bojana's home!  The space is beautiful and decorated very well.  The kitchen is fit for a chef and stocked with all of the best gadgets.  The beds were comfortable and linens beautiful.  The neighborhood is perfect for strolling or heading out on the town.  Bojana was extremely prompt in her response time and had everything ready when we arrived.   Would definitely recommend this listing to everyone!
2350464,12807857,2014-05-12,2497889,Irving,The reservation was canceled 95 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
2350464,14270682,2014-06-16,6028716,Juliana,"Bojana opened up her home to our large group of bachelorettes and it made the weekend wonderful. The house is beautiful, end of story. It is clear that much love has gone into this home and we felt like a big family sitting around the livingroom fireplace. Bojana was clear with instructions and easy to get a hold of. Many thanks, we would stay here again and again. "
2350464,14603883,2014-06-23,455696,Chelsey,"It was a pleasure to stay in Bojana's home. The house was in a quiet family friendly neighborhood that ensured a sense of security in our group of six ladies. We were able to take long walks in the evening and enjoy all the amazing architecture the community had to offer. It was close to transportation and had easy access to the downtown area of Seattle. The house itself was beautiful, with a dream kitchen and welcoming common areas. There was an abundance of space for all six of us, and our most loved space was the front porch where we sat each evening to enjoy a drink after a long day of exploring the city. I highly recommend this property if you are wanting to visit Seattle."
2350464,16468609,2014-07-28,6386865,Sharon,"After a long roadtrip in a minivan, Seattle was our last stop of the trip. I couldn't imagine a better place to stay. This house is absolutely beautiful, and in a cute little area walking distance to the bustling Capitol Hill neighborhood.

The place was super clean and decorated gorgeously. Very impressive. We had 5 adults and the house had room to spare! Great location for morning runs in Volunteer Park, and only a 10 min cab drive to downtown (if that).

I just wish there was cable in the downstairs living room area. Other than that, this was perfect!

Easy check in and check out, Bojana is very helpful and responsive. Truly made our trip to Seattle very special."
2350464,17341761,2014-08-11,10354458,Amy,Beautiful house.  Bojana was very helpful.  Highly recommended.
2350464,18939040,2014-09-03,16192821,John,"Our experience exceeded our expectations!  We all had a fantastic time since the house was huge, had great proximity to Volunteer park and the bus lines downtown, and overall was the perfect place for me and my family to spend Labor Day weekend.  By the end of the trip no one wanted to leave.  Highlights include the amazing view from the master bedroom, the efficient kitchen/dining-room layout, the media room in the basement, and very clear communication with Bojana on arranging check-in/out and answering all of our many questions.

Highly recommended!"
2350464,20417257,2014-09-29,7990338,Andrew,The house was perfect for our large group.  Central location made for easy access to restaurants and bars.  We made use of the kitchen and grill for several meals.....oh how I miss this kitchen.
2350464,20894940,2014-10-07,8858681,Kaulen,Bojana's home was absolutely lovely and just as described and pictured. We felt very at home and comfortable during our stay. The neighborhood is beautiful and convenient to downtown. My husband and I enjoyed our morning walks to Volunteer Park Cafe and strolling through Volunteer Park. We all loved the amazing views from the master suite and the space to spread out and relax as a family. We already miss being there and would love to stay again the next time we're in Seattle!
2350464,33862278,2015-06-01,10011545,Joy,This house is gorgeous! Bojana made us very welcome - she was extremely responsive and helpful when I had questions. The neighborhood is very charming - and the views from the master suite are truly amazing. We enjoyed our weekend in Bojana's home - thank you! 
2350464,45064181,2015-08-31,32369428,Meredith,"This home was AMAZING and beautiful. Great kitchen (email hidden), with a nice BBQ and outside space. The hosts were very accommodating with check in and check out times. The neighborhood and location was great, with quick and easy access to downtown Seattle, U-district, The lake, etc. "
2350464,45792929,2015-09-06,10411284,Benson,The best house our group has ever stayed in! Very warm and cozy. We feel lucky to have been able to stay in Bojana's home. Wish we could have had stayed longer!
2350464,46858311,2015-09-14,10722343,Heather,"We had a great time at Bojana's house. It's beautiful, in a great location and our hostess left everything we needed and more. It was kid friendly and a nice oasis in the city. "
2350464,47983318,2015-09-22,7098903,Kristen,The house was perfect and in an amazing neighborhood. It made our trip!
1427103,7040358,2013-09-04,6150109,Corrie,"our stay was perfect  for our weekend In Seattle.  it was located right in the middle of every thing and close to downtown where all the action is- but in a quiet neighborhood where we felt safe and parking was free and easy. 
 Marne- and family-  were so kind, accommodating and welcoming.  the place is small but it functions very well.  Very clean,  soft sheets, decent bed, and room on the floor for our little guy to sleep. 
 would totally recommend this place to stay!  Marne  was wonderful!  she even found us at the  coffee shop just down the block to bring us the items we left behind. "
1427103,12309400,2014-04-28,12160220,Jeanette,"I stumbled across this little diamond by accident. I originally had plans to stay at another local property, however that did not work out and was referred to Marne. What a blessing! Marne was able to accommodate my stay.  Checking to make sure I had everything I could possibly need during my stay.  The property was very clean, easy to locate and in a great neighborhood.  They had just purchased a new standard sized bed, it slept like a dream, however it was  just me, will be a cozy sleep for two! There is no TV, which was fine for me, but others may think it is a must.  I will for sure stay again! "
1427103,13797325,2014-06-04,233999,Erin,"we three (me, hubby and cubby) came to Seattle for a wedding, graduation andddd our first anniversary all packed in a two-week adventure. needless to say, staying at marne's precious space was precisely the kickoff we were looking for. to our surprise, we were treated to champagne for our anniversary along with other treats. 
cozy and just right would be how we'd describe the place. meeting the family is a must. btw, absolutely love the heated tile floors."
1427103,14124652,2014-06-12,2544982,Kelley,The place was great.  It was centrally located in a very nice neighborhood with easy access to restaurants and shops.  It was very clean and  comfortable.  Marne was very attentive and welcoming. She went out of her way to help me familiarize myself with the area.  I would absolutely stay there again. Highly recommended/
1427103,14176612,2014-06-13,16525073,Sarah,"This is a great place to stay - Marne was a wonderful host and the place was super cute and immaculate.  The neighborhood is great for visitors without a car as most things are walkable, including the farmers market and art walk and the bus stop is right across the street.  What a great find!  Thank you Marne!  We really enjoyed our stay!"
1427103,14275877,2014-06-16,13931700,Qiaoqiao,"I stayed for three nights with my parents. Marne was so sweet, she drew a lovely pic with Chinese word ""welcome"" and ""congratulations"" on the door, which moved my parents a lot. The room was very clean. As a half-local Seattle resident, I highly recommend travel around the neighborhood. Wallingford is an amazing place with a lot of tasty Italian & Japanese restaurants :)"
1427103,14415026,2014-06-18,11877663,Mary,"Great place to stay, convenient location, friendly and helpful host.  Excellent airbnb experience"
1427103,14683850,2014-06-24,12111753,Andrew,Marne was immensely co-operative and helpful.
1427103,15052634,2014-07-01,12131579,Clark,"Marne provided us with a lovely place to stay for a weekend wedding we attended.  The apartment is plenty spacious for two people, and all of the amenities went well beyond our needs. 

The neighborhood is beautiful, and in close proximity to walking destinations.  It is also situated perfectly for a short drive to nearly anywhere in the city.  

It was great to be able to stay in a comfortable place for a few days while we were traveling. 

10/10 would stay again!"
1427103,15177996,2014-07-04,15392166,Bonnie,"This is a beautiful, clean and tidy little apartment space, located in a gorgeous Seattle neighborhood!  Marne and her family are friendly and thoughtful hosts.  The Wallingford area is a cozy residential neighborhood with nice, locally-owned shops and restaurants and an easy commute to Seattle's downtown, parks, and other attractions.  A perfect space for anyone visiting!  You'll love your stay here. "
1427103,15489723,2014-07-10,15105334,Cindy,"My husband, son, and I moved to Seattle from Florida and stayed at Marne's until we found a place to live.  Marne and her family were gracious and accommodating hosts!  We were promptly greeted and immediately felt welcomed. Marne went above and beyond by giving us suggestions of where to look for a place to live, included us in her Fourth of July festivities, and checked on us periodically to see if we had any questions or concerns.   
The space was clean and comfortable.  The photos online were exactly what we saw when we showed up.  This was our first time using airbnb and we were somewhat skeptical but pleasantly surprised and happy with our stay.  We highly recommend Marne's place!"
1427103,15564549,2014-07-11,4568578,Jasmine,"Marne was such a great host — incredibly hospitable, welcoming and accommodating. We stayed with her after deciding on a last minute trip from Portland to Seattle. Not only did Marne give us a comfortable and spacious place to stay, but she gave us a lot of great tips on neighborhoods to check out as well as advice on things to do/see. As a newbie to Airbnb, Marne made me feel really comfortable and at ease.

We found Wallingford to be a great neighborhood as it had amazing views of the city and was centrally located to the areas in Seattle we wanted to visit (Ballard and Fremont). 

We look forward to coming back and staying with her again!




"
1427103,15756763,2014-07-15,14415161,Denise,"Marne and her family were absolutely lovely - they really made our visit feel special. The house couldn't be any closer to bus lines, local parks, local restaurants, and retail, so there's no need for a vehicle, but the space itself is cozy and feels like you're a million miles from the hustle and bustle of the city. Next time we're in Seattle, if it's not already booked, we'll be staying with Marne again!"
1427103,16402132,2014-07-27,15486954,Chloe,Marne was a great host and the apartment was in a perfect location.
1427103,16559691,2014-07-29,1740299,Curtis,"Marne was a wonderful host!  We had a great time in their apartment.  The place was super clean, there were snacks when we arrived, and Marne was extremely helpful and kind.  The location is great - walking distance to the shops and restaurants in Wallingford and also down to Gas Works park on Lake Union.  A great place to get a feel for living in one of Seattle's northern neighborhoods.  Thanks Marne!"
1427103,16617008,2014-07-30,8259077,Christian,Marne and her family were excellent hosts. Their place was clean and conveniently located. I highly recommend. 
1427103,16773411,2014-08-02,15913042,Heidi,"Marne is the most gracious, welcoming host! The location in Wallingford is perfection. Cafés, shops, and happy people are in abundant supply. 

We are ready to return as soon as we can. Seattle is amazing, and Marne is a delight. We wholeheartedly recommend staying at the Wallingford apartment.

Best wishes and joyful thoughts,
Heidi and Jeff"
1427103,16885817,2014-08-04,13874900,Jaclyn,"Marne was very welcoming, and even though they were out of town and couldn't meet us she checked in with me everyday to make sure things were going well. The apartment was cozy and comfortable. "
1427103,17099396,2014-08-07,4740658,Dana,"Great find! The apartment is spotless, roomy, and very comfortable! Thanks for a great stay!"
1427103,17359277,2014-08-11,4440689,Matthew,"Loved the apartment - it had all the necessities, the bed was comfy, and Marne even left us a little chalkboard note on the door for our arrival. Had a great time in Seattle! "
1427103,17564923,2014-08-14,17100702,Cassiday,"First impression was amazing, as our host offered to pick us up from the light rail and drive us to the house. Great neighborhood, loved the quiet, peaceful feeling. The apartment had everything we needed, and even had snacks and water waiting for us. We appreciated the sweet customized message on the door for our honeymoon. Would stay here again. "
1427103,18476152,2014-08-27,17254595,Kassie,Marne was a welcoming hostess. The apartment was in great condition and spotless. Snacks and water were provided on our arrival. She was responsive and helpful before and during the stay. It was the perfect place to stay for us with our little baby because it was family friendly and we didn't have to worry too much about disturbing everyone in the rest of the house!
1427103,18653384,2014-08-30,16785300,Niki,"Marne is a lovely host, welcoming, friendly and thoughtful. I'd highly recommend staying here and in Wallingford. It's easy to access by public transport, car, bike, or foot. Another perk is that Wallingford is full of cafes, shops, restaurants, and bars. Marne has two sweet children that can be noisy, especially early in the day. This is a forewarning to night owls and people who aren't familiar/comfortable with the noises of kids. I really enjoyed my stay and appreciate Marne's familiarity and kindness. The basement dwelling of Marne's home is definitely a good value! "
1427103,20184184,2014-09-25,16015892,Anjo,Staying with Marne and her family was a great joy. We lived in their very nice apartment for 3 weeks and never missed anything. Our kids played around the house. It was a wonderful stay and would definitely do it again. The neighborhood is great and has many great places to go out in walking distance!
1427103,20303772,2014-09-27,19390339,Viktoria,"The listing is accurate and the apartment was absolutely perfect for our stay! It has a nice layout and the location is great for walking to the many cafes and grocery store on 45th as well as the public transportation available all around.  The apartment is also super clean and the neighborhood is quiet and safe for walking around at night.

Above and beyond the great space was Marne's and her family's warm welcome and supreme hospitality.  They shared invaluable information about the area and Seattle in general.  

Marne even took a morning away from her family to show us around several neighborhoods and schools as we are considering relocating to the area.  Marne is an incredible person with a genuine heart.  We expected to have a nice stay but didn't expect to make a real friend.  Thanks Marne!"
1427103,20522812,2014-09-30,13260735,Christa,"The place was perfect. Quaint and comfortable, just want i needed for a couple nights.  It was walking distance to a great coffee shop and some restaurants. Also, the bus stop was directly out front which was helpful. "
1427103,20856802,2014-10-06,16549654,Lucy,"Marne and family were extremely welcoming and attentive.  She ensured that we had everything we needed and encouraged us to not be shy about asking (however not needed as the apartment had everything needed!).  The apartment is very clean, comfortable, and in a great location!  I will definitely stay again - next time I am in Seattle."
1427103,20982963,2014-10-08,11074995,Kristin,"Marne's apartment in Seattle is exactly as described. Clean, comfortable, and accommodating. She made us feel very welcome, and there were snacks and drinks for us when we arrived. Her home is close to the Fremont neighborhood and just a quick drive to Ballard. Both neighborhoods offer tons of shops, restaurants, bars, and things to do. Overall, we had a great stay, slept well, and left feeling refreshed. We would stay here again! 

"
1427103,21151480,2014-10-12,552692,BethAnne,Marne and Drew made us feel at home. The house is a nice part of Seattle with lots of great restaurants and shops a few blocks away. It was great for our little stop over before we left Seattle. The 26 bus comes by right in front of the house which is convenient for trips into downtown. 
1427103,21482074,2014-10-18,22026009,Allison,Marne's accommodations were just as she described - the apartment was clean and comfortable. She has an adorable family and was extremely kind throughout the whole process. I would caution that she does have two small children who could be out and about quite early and the accommodations are right below in the basement of their home.
1427103,22044694,2014-10-28,8338782,Sejla,"My husband and I spent 6 days with Marne and Drew. Apartment is very cute, clean and has everything you need for a comfortable stay. Marne and Drew are lovely people and they made sure we had every piece of information we needed. They even gave us a ride at the end of our stay. Thank you for sharing your home with us "
1427103,22559569,2014-11-09,17411821,Neal,"Such a great experience. Marne and her family are wonderful, the place was exactly what we needed for the night, and the neighborhood was easy to navigate and park. Marne gave us a great recommendation for where to eat in Fremont (Revel), and there really wasn't any aspect of our experience that was less than outstanding. The snacks from Trader Joe's were also much appreciated. You won't go wrong staying here. "
1427103,22882851,2014-11-17,12111753,Andrew,"As usual, staying with Marne was great. If anyone is coming to Seattle and wants to stay in beautiful Wallingford, please contact Marne"
1427103,23108540,2014-11-23,22921431,John,Great trip! Very happy with the accommodations!
1427103,23723229,2014-12-08,24267807,Samantha,My experience was great in Wallingford ! Such a cute place in a fantastic location. The trip was so very perfect and Marne and her family were lovely . This was my first time with air b nb and I am loving it! 
1427103,23987067,2014-12-15,9454942,Nicole,"My boyfriend and I had a wonderful stay at Marne's! The place was super quaint, clean, and affordable. It was perfect for what we needed. Marne was very friendly and accommodating. She has great recommendations on where to eat and what to do in Seattle. We would definitely stay with Marne again. "
1427103,25243172,2015-01-10,5658985,Michael,Marne was great and communicated well at checkin. The listing exceeded expectations and parking was available within a block. There is a great breakfast spot within two blocks.
1427103,25543699,2015-01-19,332816,Jennifer,"My partner and I stayed with Marne for 4 nights, she was a great host!  Very responsive and willing to answer my long list of questions.  The place was super clean and just as described and pictured.  I was away during the days but my partner was there working, as mentioned in the description, Marne has 2 kids and thus there were lots of little kids sounds!  Great location and delicious snacks left by Marne!"
1427103,26218911,2015-02-07,8974776,Erica,"We had a fun visit to Seattle, and this apartment was a great home base. We didn't bother renting a car, which was no problem. Everything we needed was in walking distance or accessible with near-by bus service (that ran frequently enough we didn't bother checking schedules). The apartment was clean and cozy, and Marne checked in periodically to make sure everything was going well. There are a handful of moderately steep steps, so I wouldn't recommend the apartment if you have mobility issues (but they are completely benign otherwise). Sound does travel between the apartment and the house, but a bit of common courtesy seems to be sufficient to making that work."
1427103,26714275,2015-02-17,487475,Theresa,"Marne is a friendly host and very accessible to guests. The apartment is beautiful, clean, and well-furnished. The location of Wallingford is good with cool local restaurants and shops and is also a close drive to downtown, pike place, the needle, lake union, and Fremont. For those with cars, there was ample street parking. This is a private apartment, but as in the description, it is a basement apartment, and voices and footsteps can be heard above during daytime hours. However, Marne provides earplugs for those who may need them. The snacks and drinks were a nice and appreciated touch. We would definitely stay here again, especially for the price!"
1427103,27367375,2015-03-02,197496,Christopher,"Marne and her family were amazing hosts. From a friendly greeting at the door, one of the best neighborhoods in Seattle, to the additional consideration they gave me for my children - their home was absolutely ideal for our stay. I would highly recommend to anyone passing through this wonderful city, and look forward to visiting them again soon :)"
1427103,27524367,2015-03-06,23376196,Adrienne,"Accommodations were exactly as described. On top of that, Marne put in extra effort to make me feel welcome, like stocking the kitchen with snacks and having a vase with fresh daffodils for my arrival. A very pleasant experience in a charming neighborhood. As a basement unit, some sounds from above, but only during the day and what I consider a non-issue. Also, Marne provided ear plugs, helpful if you're hyper-sensitive to noise (I did not need them). I recommend! "
1427103,28404396,2015-03-23,725082,Roy,Marne is an exceptionally nice and thoughtful host. The listing was just as described and more than met our expectations. Thanks again!
1427103,28819623,2015-03-30,1500964,Simon,"My parents stayed at Marne's while visiting my girlfriend and me and had a great experience. Marne responded to our request immediately, called my dad directly to walk him through check-in/check-out, etc., and then texted throughout the weekend to make sure everything was going well. The apartment itself is spacious and comfortable (my parents reported good nights of sleep in the queen bed), and there's a nice outdoor space for reading/relaxing in the sun. We loved having coffee and breakfast at Irwin's, a short walk away, and my mom enjoyed perusing the selection and chatting with the owner of the Durn Good Grocery. Would stay again!"
1427103,31182751,2015-05-03,12827461,Petra,"We had an exceptional fantastic stay at Marnes house and would have loved to stay longer if time would have allowed. The appartment is exactly as described, centrally located in a lovely neighbourhood with easy access to Wallingford, Fremont and via bus stop almost in front of the house also to Seattle center, downtown and university district. 
Marne always responded quickly and organised everything perfectly from arrival to stay to departure. Upon arrival, flowers, snacks and Seattle booklets welcomed us. 
Me and my small daughter stayed for almost five weeks and - above all other perfect features - Marnes place is an exceptional place for staying with kids, too. 
No doubt: we would immediately try to stay again with Marne and her lovely family any time we make it back to Seattle."
1427103,31838091,2015-05-10,2935758,Alexandria,"We had a great stay in Marne's home. We felt very welcome there - the snacks and fresh flowers are a lovely touch. It's very clean, nicely furnished and just as pictured. We are planning to move to Seattle, and Marne was more than willing to give advice and recommendations for the area. You can definitely hear her energetic kiddos upstairs, but they provided us with earplugs that worked like a charm! The location was great and made exploring Fremont, Gas Works Park, Lake Union, etc. very walkable. We'd happily recommend her home to others."
1427103,32224326,2015-05-15,8259874,Kirsty,"Another great airbnb experience.
Pros: Marne was a great host and was extremely helpful and kind. The apartment easily accommodated myself, my husband, our toddler and baby. Convenient location - we caught the bus downtown, the bus stop is very close to the apartment. Free parking. Comfortable bed.
Cons: there is no door between the bedroom and kitchen, not so great when you have kids sleeping. As mentioned in the description of the apartment you do hear noise and foot steps from upstairs. 
Overall I would recommend this apartment for your next visit to Seattle!"
1427103,32680790,2015-05-20,9445651,Sarah,I booked this for my Mom to stay close by in the neighborhood while visiting. It was perfect! Very clean and well appointed. Marne was also quick and wonderful to communicate with. I would definitely recommend this spot for others looking to stay close to Fremont and Wallingford. 
1427103,32809576,2015-05-22,3924822,Roger,Marne's is a very quiet suite on a busy street.  The host(ess) was very warm and welcoming.  This Air BnB experience exceeded our expectations
1427103,32918743,2015-05-23,4624467,Lisa,"Great experience. Wonderful place to stay with my husband and 1 year old. Marne and Drew were both extremely helpful and accommodating. Yes you can hear the footsteps above but this want an issue at night just during the day. Great place to stay if you want to walk to the park, dinner, coffee, etc. close to everything. "
1427103,33109990,2015-05-25,6745771,Boaz,"Forget the Space Needle - welcoming people like Marne are the highlight of Seattle!

The apartment was a clean, comfortable, and convenient place to stay."
1427103,33427939,2015-05-28,3924822,Roger,Very welcoming host and lovely location.  We will put this location on our A-list!
1427103,33685075,2015-05-31,22596321,Hong,"It's a wonderful experience in (email hidden)ean room,nice family!We arrived at Marne 's home very late in the night, and Marne was still waiting for us.Thank you Marne!Hope to see you again!"
1427103,34022245,2015-06-03,26491673,Maria,"Marne made me feel like family!  As a matter of fact, we hung out together for a while the night before I left.  If that isn't hospitality, nothing is!  The description of the place was spot on and it was clean and cozy.  They take pride in their little apartment and it shows.  I couldn't be more satisfied.  This is a amazing value!"
1427103,34360779,2015-06-07,1781638,Justine,"From only  a few quick chats I could tell that Marne and Drew are good people with good intentions and they are very welcoming, warm,  and accommodating (not to mention their kids, Willlow/Buddy, are such cuties too!) We were welcomed with a 'Happy Birthday' sign (for me) written in chalk on the door--that's how thoughtful they are. They were both very responsive via email/txt and more than willing to offer suggestions on where to visit and mention their favorite spots as well. 

The pictures are very accurate and the place was fresh and spotless with a homey feel. The price per night was well worth it!! We had everything we needed including iron/ironing board, dirty laundry basket, hangers...they pretty much stock you with everything you could need on a vacation and we stayed 4 nights. I really appreciated the toiletries in the shower because I completely forgot mine. And OMG the bed is comfy even for my 6'1 finace :)

Check in/out was seamless. We were allowed to drop off our bags earlier than check-in time (3pm) which helped us out not having to drag our bags around the city. Definitely in a safe and quiet neighborhood (so lovely!) walkable to 45th, a convenience store, and coffee shop. On our walks we couldn't get over how beautiful all the homes are. Uber rides from their house are easy for drivers to locate and only ranged from $7-15, depending on where you go of course (University of WA, Downtown, Ballard, Capitol Hill). Note: The weather this time of year was perfect 70-80s with blue skies!!

I would love to give 5 stars, really I would, but the only thing that was mentioned in their description that was a bit unbearable (for a vacation) was the noise from upstairs-YES, remember you are in a basement. Please note: They do have young kids who run, stomp, yell or 'happy scream', play with toys, cry, and wake up EARLY- and you can hear everything. Keep in mind, this may or may not effect your stay as they mature and grow, but we thought of Buddy as our charming alarm clock. Let me also be honest and add that I'm not a morning person, but I'd like to think that I'm a very heavy sleeper, not very sensitive to sound, and it was hard to sleep in and/or take naps in the early/late afternoon-- ear plugs don't cancel out the vibrations in the basement.

OTHER than our issue above, this place is really AWESOME and very centrally located to everything you'd want to do in Seattle.

Thank you so much for having us we really did enjoy your place!"
1427103,34817705,2015-06-12,15121499,Kathryn,"Marne is a wonderful host and her home made for the perfect place to stay for a few days. The space is roomy, light and super comfortable and the location can't be beat with parks, restaurants, groceries, coffee shops and bars in walking distance. I would highly recommend and happily stay here again!"
1427103,34956632,2015-06-14,15025582,Becky,"Marne and her family were wonderful hosts. Their house is in a very convenient location, only 5 blocks from the shops and restaurants on 45th and very close to downtown Fremont. Marne was very responsive to any questions and gave us a warm welcome. The apartment is cozy with all the amenities, including snacks! You do hear people walking around above you pretty clearly, which could make jetlag induced afternoon naps challenging. But that is only an issue if you are trying to sleep at odd hours; at night the apartment is quiet, private, and very comfortable! We would highly recommend their home!!"
1427103,35261362,2015-06-16,286151,Daniel,"This was an excellent place. It had everything we needed, we loved the neighbourhood and the hosts were spectacular. 
Marne really is a superhost. "
1427103,36120488,2015-06-25,2274803,Aditya,"Great location, very cozy apartment. Marne, Drew and the kids were very warm hosts, easy to get in touch with and always willing to help. "
1427103,36532085,2015-06-29,165155,Brian,"Marne was very responsive after accepting our reservation.  Getting into the apartment was easy and we were able to check-in whenever we arrived.  We never actually met Marne during our stay but ran into her husband, Drew, during our first day.  He was very welcoming and friendly and told us about a few spots to check out around the neighborhood.....the neighborhood is walkable with a more commerical street of shops, restaurants, coffee shops, ice cream, etc. about (5) blocks away.  Gasworks Park is also not too far away.

There was quite a bit of noise from upstairs, especially in the mornings when the kids are up and running around.  We generally did not hear much at nighttime, however. 

"
1427103,36815335,2015-07-01,11276645,Joy,"What a delightful stay. Marne is responsive and helpful, and her family is equally welcoming. Our child especially enjoyed the camaraderie of the other children in the house. The place was clean, the bed was comfortable, and the location was primo. We loved the happy vibe upstairs and recommend this place to anyone who values eco-friendly, family-friendly hospitality. They have it in spades. "
1427103,37878201,2015-07-11,13390980,Katie,"The place was very clean and exactly as described. Marne was very attentive. The place is in a wonderful location, right near Lake Union. It was absolutely beautiful and a wonderful stay!"
1427103,39521463,2015-07-24,25319631,Sophie,"This place was great, very clean and conveniently located for those who like a stay in a peaceful neighborhood of Seattle (i.e Wallingford). It is about 25 min walk from UW South campus or 10 min bus ride. Marne is very responsive with emails if you need any advice before and during your stay. I only briefly met her the day of my arrival and she is very friendly and attentive to her guests. Treats and drinks were available in the kitchen upon my arrival!"
1427103,40106965,2015-07-28,34873615,Steven,"Our experience was good. Marne was a great host who was willing to meet any need we had. Her space is nice and provided what we were wanting. She helped make our trip great. 
The spot was within walking distance from restaurants and a store. There is even a great park down the main cross street about 5 or 6 blocks south. Marne provided a bus schedule which was really nice. You could use public transportation or drive a car into the city. The neighborhood is great if you want to experience Seattle without being in the middle of the city. We also loved Fremont and Ballard areas. Both are pretty close to her house.
Just a few notes to keep in mind if you desire to stay here:
1. If you have more than two people, the space might be a little small. Only a bed for two.
2. She has two kids that are both a joy. In the morning you do hear them running around upstairs. She provided earplugs for us, which can help when sleeping. Other than that, the space was quiet."
1427103,40472299,2015-07-31,1493367,Ashley,This apartment was wonderful for our family and in a fabulous and very kid-friendly neighborhood. Would definitely recommend. 
1427103,42544385,2015-08-14,36795304,Meghan,"I loved staying in Wallingford in the basement apartment of Marne's home. She and her husband were kind and welcoming. The place is clean, comfortable, and has all basic necessities. I wanted for nothing and would recommend this place to travelers. "
1427103,42874502,2015-08-16,756280,Ben,"Marne did a great job communicating with us about our trip, and making sure that we had everything we needed. Her place was just what we needed for a quick trip to Seattle. It's small, but perfect for two people (or two people and a baby as we had). We enjoyed walking around the neighborhood and visiting the coffee shop down the street."
1427103,44655063,2015-08-28,37706053,Mark,"We had a wonderful stay in this cozy, clean apartment. It had everything we needed.  We loved walking in the neighborhood and getting to know our host family.  This is a very central location with access to the city and many other local places of interest. I would definitely stay again. "
1427103,45133136,2015-08-31,40337024,Judith,"Marne made us feel so welcome! She greeted us even though we arrived pretty late. The bedroom was super comfortable and my tall, teenage son loved the giant blow up mattress (note that their very cute and active 2 year old starts running after 7am so be aware if you like to sleep later than that). The kitchen was great and Marne left us tea and some munchies. The neighborhood is awesome. The house is near a cafe and there are lots of restaurants nearby. It is also a great launching point for college visits. If my son goes to school there we will be back for sure. Marne was a great host. It was our first airbnb experience and it was awesome. "
1427103,45639993,2015-09-04,42062786,Kelli,"The family was very welcoming and nice. The listing is accurate and the space was clean. I would recommend to a friend. :) I literally only slept and showered there, but it was set up in a way that I would have enjoyed if I had more time."
1427103,46510383,2015-09-11,25096058,Carolyn,Marne and Drew's space is everything that I love about Seattle.  Finding the house was easy and Marne and her children gave me a warm welcome upon arrival (after letting me settle in).   The space was impeccably clean and exactly as pictured.  The bed was super comfy and great linens. The location simply can't be beat if you want a true Seattle experience.  Marne even went the extra mile when I asked it were possible to check in early (the day before I was set to arrive on a holiday weekend!). She let me know the moment the apartment was ready.  I would absolutely stay here again and recommend it to anyone.  
1427103,46651371,2015-09-12,2326233,Aubre,"Marne was very helpful and sent me texts with all the information I needed and made sure to check in with me via text! The apartment was very clean and comfortable. The mini-kitchen was perfect. It's easy to walk up to 45th street to a few shops and restaurants, and there's also a coffee shop right down the street. "
1427103,47809705,2015-09-21,1828717,Dilip,"Very cute place, was perfect for our celebration in Seattle. The apartment was nicely decorated, had everything we could think of (loved the snacks and tea) and the proximity to the city and parking was just what we needed.

Marne was very flexible and welcoming to us! She gave us so many cool ideas for the weekend...

Bring swimmers earplugs, so you don't hear the kids - they are very cute but early risers."
1427103,49082115,2015-09-30,4990165,Daniel,"Marne was very quick to respond to my request for accommodations which was sent with fairly short notice. The home was spacious and had all the basics you would need. Unfortunately my stay was short and very busy, so I was not able to meet Marne. Maybe next time. Thanks for hosting."
1427103,49192975,2015-10-01,28096221,Dave,"Great cozy and private place. Perfect location in a nice neighborhood. Marne and Drew were very welcoming, and their kids are very cute. The only complaint is that the stated cost is deceiving because the cleaning fee was very expensive, almost the same cost as the room itself."
1427103,50332711,2015-10-11,130970,Carolyn,"Marne gave us a warm welcome and we enjoyed and impromptu play date with our toddlers. The apartment was clean, comfortable and cozy, and the snacks were a lifesaver. Marne had great suggestions for things to do in the neighborhood. We highly recommend staying here, especially if you have a small child."
1427103,51364612,2015-10-19,36176259,Tamara,"Marne and her family were welcoming, sweet, and availed themselves to us. The room, kitchen and bath were clean and simple. What more do you need? "
1427103,53755255,2015-11-12,3924822,Roger,"This listing is exactly as described,  tastefully finished and just right for a couple to lodge for a few days. The location is in just the right place to drive to restaurants, attractions, UW and Gasworks park.  Marne is an extraordinary host always being sure that guests are cared for."
1427103,55820575,2015-12-06,5352330,Meagan,"My stay at Marne's apartment was great! Marne and her family made me feel extremely welcome. Marne was very accommodating and quick be helpful with anything I needed. I very much appreciated her quick responses -- especially with a last minute request as I was on my way out of town! The apartment itself was really cute. While there is no real living area to hang out, I didn't really need it. This may be an issue if you're planning to spend a lot of time in the apartment but I didn't mind it at all. Everything was extremely clean and well kept. As Marne mentions, she does have young kids and you will hear them in the morning but I didn't find it to be an issue at all -- in fact, I quite enjoyed hearing a little bit of piano on one of the mornings! My only suggestion would be to bring layers to sleep in if the heat is going to be on as there is no way to adjust how hot the bedroom gets, and the heat does come on full force. But Marne gave me a heads up so it wasn't an issue. I would definitely stay at her place again! "
7387294,41656184,2015-08-08,38675654,Angel,"I had a great time at Julie's place. It Was very comfortable, silent and clean. Very recomendable experience. I hope to return soon if I have the oportunity of being in Seattle again. Thanks a lot! "
7387294,41824781,2015-08-09,36013604,Tammy,"Julie was awesome! The home was quaint and charming and very comfortable. Neighborhood was busy and parking was a challenge but nothing took away from the pleasantness of our stay. It probably was an oversight on my part but bathroom was shared; which surprised me but again, it was fine and it didn't take away the experience. This was my first airbnb experience and it was great! Thank you, Julie!!!"
7387294,42039059,2015-08-10,36690261,Jenny,"Julie seems like a nice lady and the house and room were clean and comfortable with useful info on good restaurants etc. She did make me feel welcome and let me check in a bit early, which was nice. However, she was hard to contact in person for those odd little things I wanted to ask such as the fact that the internet password was wrong. This was a hassle, as was her attitude to leaving bags after check out. I did leave my suitcase but she was clearly unhappy about this. As no stations or other places have luggage lockers these days for security reasons, the ability to leave luggage was really essential since I wasn't leaving Seattle till late afternoon. I think Julie is pretty new to being an AirBnB host and hopefully she will gradually become more comfortable displaying the flexibility she claims to appreciate herself. If you have straightforward needs, I would certainly recommend Julie's house as a comfortable stay in a vibrant location."
7387294,42311737,2015-08-12,37727151,William,"Just in Seattle for a night before attending a seminar at UW. Julie was super helpful and friendly. The room was clean, comfortable, and close to campus. Plenty of space, good wifi, and clean bathroom. Definitely would stay here again!"
7387294,42478416,2015-08-13,11741508,Kathryn,"Julie was very helpful in accommodating my travelling needs. Great location to access the University district and it,s diverse food stops.
A short walk to the buses and a 20 minute ride to downtown was also very convenient."
7387294,44167566,2015-08-24,39476697,Josh,Julie was very welcoming and her place was great; very clean and in an convent location! Awesome bathroom with a really nice shower. Would definitely recommend. 
7387294,44692653,2015-08-28,34553730,Kaishu,"Good location and service, kinda old facilities but comfortable. "
7387294,45961334,2015-09-07,13854198,Sam,"This is a great location- close to bus lines, a few blocks from UW's campus, and pretty central to most neighborhoods.

The stay felt a bit awkward as the entire downstairs of the house is closed off to guests. The only rooms we had access to were our bedroom and the shared bathroom (shared between three guest rooms, so timing can be tricky, and towels smelled so terribly I couldn't use them). It felt odd to not even be able to go in the kitchen for water! The host did provide drinking glasses in the bathroom, but it was strange to have to hydrate in a public restroom.

After Julie checked us in, we didn't see anyone who lives in the house for our entire three day stay. The house is older and the floors creak loudly (woke me up frequently), but if all you need is a bed, toilet, and shower, it's a great spot to be in!

"
7387294,46958360,2015-09-14,18214888,Anneke,"We very much felt at home at Julie and Narayan's, and enjoyed the art and the books around us. A wonderful and quiet atmosphere and situated really well for the things we wanted to do. Defenitely recommended!"
7387294,49121879,2015-10-01,40194795,Kaiyu,"My parents lived there and I only took them to the place. But Julie did a nice job guiding us around the room. The room is clean and pretty. The nice thing is that Julie just lives inside the same house so assistance should be easy to ask for. I didn't hear much complain from my parents, so I guess it is good!"
7387294,51364604,2015-10-19,22376968,Frank,Julie is great on handling keys. After that she respect independence and privacy very much. The room is clean and comfortable. The location is like 20min away from downtown by bus. I spend a lovely weekend here!
7387294,54743619,2015-11-23,37727151,William,Another great stay in the U-district. Julie was friendly and welcoming. The bedroom and bathroom were clean and more than adequate. 
4941356,25120701,2015-01-06,25558086,Solomon,"Liping was a great host. I was made to feel comfortable and right at home as soon as I arrived. She was very kind and also respectful of any need for privacy. She was very mindful of letting me know to ask her if I had any questions or needed anything. Encouraged me to use any space in the apartment, and anything I needed in the kitchen. She even offered to pick me up if I got lost on my way to the apartment!

The space was VERY neat and tidy. The bed was so comfortable. The shower worked great, with lots of water pressure. 

It is just about a 20 minute bus ride from downtown, which I loved. Its nice to have access to the busy parts of town but have a quiet place to retreat to afterwards. And only a short walk to the mall and grocery, liquor, drugstores, etc.

All in all, this was a steal. Ibwould definitely recommend this space, and would love to come back on my later Seattle adventures!! Thanks Liping!!"
4941356,25158984,2015-01-07,2079495,Elizabeth,Liping was easy to contact and her place was in clean and nice condition. Would recommend for someone seeking an economical place to stay in North Seattle.
4941356,25483670,2015-01-17,24197342,Kevin,"Liping was by far the best host I have experienced as a AIRBNB user.  She was generous to a fault, accommodating and pleasant at all times.  She cooked me a homemade Chinese dinner on two occasions, and even packaged up leftovers to take with me as a lunch one day.  The apartment is spotless, and just about 2 blocks from the Northgate Mall, a library,  transit center and other shopping.  You will greatly enjoy your stay with Liping."
4941356,28560047,2015-03-26,23118961,Angelika,Liping really made me feel at home at her place. She is a really nice and fun host. The first day she took me to a very good Chinese restaurant and one evening she cooked for us Chinese food at home. She provided me lots of information about the city and how to get around by bus. The sofa/futon was very comfortable to sleep.
4941356,30061934,2015-04-17,27336066,은비,The reservation was canceled 7 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.

4941356,32868756,2015-05-22,29964912,Maggie,"I enjoyed the staying in Liping's apartment even it's shared space. Liping's is very nice girl. She introduced some helpful tips for Seattle to me, appreciated!"
4941356,34028826,2015-06-03,34018805,Xuanyu,Good. Felt at home. 
4941356,34222163,2015-06-06,2913696,Jay,"Location: Clean apartment with safe neighborhood. 
Liping prepared well for me to stay one night. Very comfortable with pleasant atmosphere.
Will like to return her place when I return to Seattle area."
4941356,34746097,2015-06-11,35025840,Manuel,"Yiping is a really nice and friendly person.
It was a pleasure to sray in her appartment."
4941356,34985637,2015-06-14,33621713,Ling,it's ok. liping is considerate. 
4941356,42780135,2015-08-15,40831985,Liliya,Liping was nice location of place is great close to the mall 
4941356,43733605,2015-08-21,36555558,Xutao,The neighborhood is quiet and beautiful. The house is clean and roomy and the bed is comfortable. Liping is a easygoing and considerate girl. This is a wonderful experience. I suggest you to live in her house.
4941356,44484335,2015-08-26,41757671,Johnny,"Liping was super nice and always responsive in communication. We both had different schedules so we barely saw each other but the one time we did, we had a nice conversation. Wonderful place to stay!"
4941356,49754362,2015-10-05,8880606,H.B.,"We did not overlap that much, but Liping met me outside, offered me water on arrival, and gave me her private room instead of the common area as she had friends visiting that evening.  It was clean and comfortable with plenty of parking."
4941356,56691058,2015-12-16,48532308,Hunter,I loved staying at Liping's she was an increasingly gracious host and a wonderful conversationalist! Place was in an excellent location for my purposes with an unbeatable price! 
6779893,38551051,2015-07-16,37830660,Simon,"Immaculate, spacious apartment in the funky capital hill district with its cool coffee shops and bars.  Matthew the host had great communication and timekeeping, and was very accommodating. All in all, a very positive experience and I wouldn't hesitate in recommending this space, or host, again."
6779893,44570455,2015-08-27,22458501,Adrian,"I've really enjoyed Matthew's condo. The condo is really clean and the layout is perfect. Matthew was always there to help me or answer any question I may have. He even went away and lent me an iron and got me a cutting board to use in the kitchen. Also, Matt told me about the city bikes you can rent and let me know about a bike station close by (just 3 blocks away) The view from the bedroom is magnificent! Will definitely recommend the condo to of my friends."
6779893,45022904,2015-08-30,321448,Ross,"Matt kept in touch with us leading up to our arrival and made sure we were comfortable when we arrived. The location is a nice hopping point for Capitol Hill, although be prepared to hike up the hill if you want to get to most of the food and drinks. If that's no problem, much of the Hill is within walking distance. The bed is comfy, and the condo is lovely."
6779893,46938191,2015-09-14,2632403,Philip,"This was my first time using Air BNB and I was very happy with the place and with the ease with which I was able to communicate with Matthew. I'll definitely be staying here again. (I go to Seattle regularly from Olympia and often prefer to stay overnight rather than round-trip it in a day). Although I didn't need to contact him, Matthew's offer to text him if I need anything at any time was much appreciated. Very nice place in which I felt very comfortable. Great location in Capital Hill and close to downtown."
6779893,48624416,2015-09-27,7381945,Wayne,"Matt was a great host. Very friendly and easy going. The unit was perfect for my stay. Clean modern and comfortable. The condo is centrally located and convenient to downtown plus you can walk to a ton of restaurants, grocery, gym and nightlife. I highly recommend this place to anyone traveling to Seattle. Thanks again Matt for a great experience."
6779893,49269971,2015-10-02,30593291,Jason,This was a beautiful and well-appointed apartment in cap hill overlooking Lake Union. Could not have been more comfortable. Thanks to Matthew for easy communications and being at the ready with anything I might need - even laundry detergent!  I'd gladly stay again. 
6779893,57139007,2015-12-22,2632403,Philip,Stayed at Matthew's condo on a regular basis between Sept-Dec. (I live in Olympia but was singing the holiday concerts with Seattle Mens Chorus so needed a place to stay overnight for rehearsals and performances.) It's a great place. Great location. Very walkable to Capital Hill or downtown. Indoor parking. Gas fireplace. Kitchen with enough dishes and supplies to last about a week before you'd have to run the dishwasher. Spotlessly clean. Matthew was always very friendly and accommodating and easy to coordinate with. I haven't stayed at many Air BNB place (yet); Matthew's place has set a high bar.
5537446,28766321,2015-03-29,30018518,Tammy,"We had an excellent time here! The condo is exactly as described in the listing and was very well prepared for our arrival; the exterior of the building was under construction during the time we stayed, but it was no trouble over the weekend. We picked up keys from a nearby cafe with no difficulty, and Sarah gave us recommendations for places to eat in the neighborhood. She was incredibly responsive, getting back to us almost instantaneously when we had questions. We were able to walk almost everywhere we wanted to go in Seattle (including Pioneer Park, Pike Place Market, the Space Needle, the convention center, and downtown bars). We would stay again and have already recommended it to friends!"
5537446,31364714,2015-05-04,30278689,Clinton,Sarah was a great host and her condo was very nice and was in a great location! She gave us great recommendations for places to eat/drink. Sarah quickly responded for questions we had and overall was a great experience.
5537446,31804139,2015-05-10,2991962,Kanika,"This apartment is in a great location, very close to lots of restaurants and popular Seattle spots. Unfortunately, we had several issues with the apartment. When we arrived, the apartment was not very clean. My husband and I cleaned the floor and vacuumed because there were fibers (like fur) from the rug all over. We contacted Sarah who offered to bring in house cleaners, and we agreed, however, the house cleaners never came. Later, Sarah told us she was unable to line up the house cleaners. In addition to the cleanliness, we also had trouble with the wifi and TV. We tried to troubleshoot with Sarah over Airbnb messaging but nothing she suggested worked. The TV never worked (controlled via Xbox controller which had dead batteries in it), and the wifi was spotty, at best. Finally, the apartment building, had some construction issues. In particular, the elevator being out of service for part of our stay was very inconvenient, particularly when we had to carry our baby and stroller down three flights of stairs. In addition, before our stay started, Sarah provided directions on how to get into the parking garage (this is not provided on her airbnb page). Without a gate controller, each time we needed to park, one of us had to get out of the car, unlock the side door, come inside the garage and manually press a button to open the garage door. The first time we did this, the building manager saw us and questioned us about what we were doing. 

Overall, this apartment is in a good location. We were dissatisfied with our stay in Sarah's apartment due to the cleanliness of the apartment, wifi and TV problems, and building issues. Sarah was receptive to our feedback and refunded us one night's stay. 
"
5537446,32280778,2015-05-16,8097561,Adrian,"Sarah's place was as nice and well-appointed as the photos suggest. Fantastic value and a great location in Seattle, walking distance from some fantastic restaurants, shops, cafes, etc. Check-in and check-out was easy. Her building is currently being renovated, but construction noise was minimal, thankfully. A very nice stay!"
5537446,32366275,2015-05-17,19127904,Ryan,The pictures of the apartment were very accurate. 
5537446,33160936,2015-05-25,31887697,Hannah,"Sarahs condo was absolutely amazing!! She left it extremely homey for us, and was extremely accommodating with our check in and check out times. The neighborhood was friendly and felt safe. I would highly recommend sarahs condo to anyone traveling. The roof top deck was unfortunately closed during our stay, which was a bit of a disappointment, but the remodel on the building will make it that much more beautiful!"
5537446,34938702,2015-06-14,9471197,Christina,"Sarah was a great host. She was very responsive and gave loads of recommendations for us in the neighborhood. This neighborhood was the perfect spot for us. Lots of cute shops and restaurants during the day and a great bar and nightlife scene for the night. The apartment building itself was a little rundown, but inside the condo it is very nice and well kept. The big disappointment we had was that the rooftop deck was closed. If we had known this while booking or prior to the stay we may have searched around a little more. We told Sarah on the phone we were going to check it out and sent a follow up text asking if there was a way to get on to it, but she never informed us or replied that it was actually closed. "
5537446,36495180,2015-06-28,27628321,Matt,Great location but the street noise kept us awake till 2am. The place to pick the keys up was not open as it should have been so we ended up waiting an hour to get the key. Host said that hadn't happened before so hopefully it was an isolated incident. 
5537446,45035031,2015-08-30,20781403,Robert,"This was an incredible experience, and a complete steal for the cost of the stay. Parking was a little difficult to manage but at completely no fault to Sarah (it was in the middle of a rainstorm) 11/10 would recommend and would go to again myself!"
5537446,45932349,2015-09-07,22336007,Luis,"The apartment was wonderful! The description was very accurate, Sarah made sure to get in contact with me and inform me about the structural changes and the scaffolding that was taking place. This didn't affect us one bit. The location was wonderful! Center to food, coffee, bars and a short 15 minute walk to Pikes and about 25 minute walk to the Space needle. No car needed great location! Highly recommend staying with Sarah! "
5537446,46577425,2015-09-12,9837143,Michael,We had a great experience. The apartment was clean and comfortable. Sarah was very helpful. The apartment is located near restaurants and a short 1 mile walk to Pikes Place.
5537446,46784461,2015-09-13,23857542,Katie,"Sarah's place was awesome! Perfect location and cute condo. Parking was a little tricky and the building was in the middle of some pretty big construction, but Sarah was very upfront with all of the details. She was also very responsive when I had questions before/during my stay. Would stay here again next time I visit Seattle!"
5537446,49429974,2015-10-04,37137813,Mike,"This was my first time using Airbnb and Sarah was very accommodating to my many questions about using the service. Even before I finished checking in, she was available and helpful to me. The unit was very nice, and the pictures on Airbnb are representative of what the unit actually looks like - pictures can always be deceiving until you see the real thing!

Capital Hill is an awesome area, and we very much enjoyed walking around, taking in some good food (breakfasts especially) in the immediate vicinity of the unit.

I think the one thing that I was disappointed in, was the state of the inside of the rental complex - on some floors parts of the walls were missing/under construction, and there was black tarp on all of the floors covering the carpet. I totally understand renovations are a necessary thing, however, I was a bit surprised to see just how heavily under construction the building actually was. The elevator was also out of order.

THAT SAID, the construction is only cosmetic and did not detract from Sarah being a wonderful host, and the unit accommodating our needs perfectly!

One thing for Airbnb, rather than Sarah, is make the ""Unit Manual"" a more prominent part of the experience once you check in. In the app, it's buried under several gestures, and on desktop it's not very logical to get to. Important info like, how to park, wifi password, etc. are contained there. Perhaps this is because it's my first time using Airbnb, but even still, first time users should be essentially handheld during their entire first experience. It's just good UX."
5537446,51751069,2015-10-24,44744643,Heather,"Sarah's place was neat and well-appointed. It's in a great location for getting to Capital Hill restaurants and bars and is only a quick 20 minute walk to downtown. Key pick up was a breeze and Sarah was very flexible about our drop-off (we had an early flight out of town). 

There is quite a bit of construction going on in the building. I'm sure this is changing on a regular basis, but I would recommend future guests check beforehand about the best way to enter the condo."
973859,5250538,2013-06-20,2552172,Esteban,"Greg and his partner have transformed the lower part of their home into a separate new modern fully equipped house where 2 work mates and myself have comfortably spent 4 wonderful days.
The house is located at a walking distance from Downtown Seattle and has everything you need to feel like your very own place, such as: Internet connection, flat screen TV (Netflix & Pandora), washing and drying machine, etc, etc... Moreover Greg is a very just and helpful host as he pointed us to the right places to go to in town, public transports, etc.
I highly recommend this place to all travelers and I wont hesitate go there myself if I get the chance to go back to Seattle! =)
"
973859,5352190,2013-06-25,6820346,Geoff,"Greg is friendly and helpful.  The apartment has a combo lock so there are no hassles about connecting with him to get a key.  There  is plenty of on-street parking, and it's a 10-minute drive to downtown (wharf, aquarium, stadiums) and only 15 to UW.  We found it comfortable and convenient, and would definitely stay with Greg again!"
973859,5405088,2013-06-28,5055803,Nathan,"I stayed with 3 others at Greg's basement apartment for 2 nights. The door has a keypad and we were provided with the code before arrival which was great as we didn't have to organize a specific time to pick up a key. We did meet Greg upon arrival though and he was friendly and helpful. We had nothing go wrong so we didn't actually see him again during our stay. The apartment was exactly as advertised. It was clean, comfortable, close to downtown and had everything you would need for a short or long stay. I thought it was great there was Netflix set up on the TV. On-street parking was never a problem. I would stay again next time I am in Seattle."
973859,6151834,2013-08-01,6563213,Abbey,My husband and I had a wonderful stay at Greg's place for just over a month. Greg was very accommodating and helpful with all our arrival/departure plans. The location is awesome! Walking distance to all the fun things in capitol hill but enough of a neighborhood to be quite and always have an available parking spot on the street. The apartment was comfortable and had all the amenities to make our stay perfect. It truly felt like home to us by the end. The next time we are in Seattle it will be the first place we look up.  
973859,6276505,2013-08-06,6853891,Katherine,"Greg's place was so great! Absolutely incredible location-- we walked everywhere! Really clean, really friendly, really private."
973859,6347741,2013-08-09,3502042,Raymond,We enjoyed staying at Greg's cozy home.  It had plenty of room and probably one of the best showers I have ever used (no kidding).  Greg was a really good host and was accessible for any questions or needs.  The house is located in a part of Seattle that is central to wherever you want to go yet in a residential area.  Parking is also really easy.  We highly recommend this location.
973859,6421980,2013-08-12,6789027,Michelle,"Greg's Place was great, it was close to a bus stop which provided reliable and frequent transportation to all of our destinations. We took a cab in a few cases because we were traveling in a small group and it was always less than or around $10 to downtown areas. We had 3 couples stay at his place and it was comfortable for all. The door had a keypad instead of keys so it was very easy for each couple to come and go as they pleased. Everything was clean, and accessible. Greg was very easy to get in touch with prior to our visit and even during the weekend we were there via email. He left recommendations and contact info for cabs which was really helpful and we would have loved to use the outdoor space but ran out of time, it looked beautiful. Great host, Great place! "
973859,6616454,2013-08-19,6949805,Fred,Great Place on a pretty block.. very comfy and clean with great amenities like washer dryer. Really smooth dealing with Greg would stay again
973859,6811660,2013-08-26,7264180,Corinne,"Greg is an experienced Air BnB host who provided all the necessary information in wonderful detail, had towels/linens/soap/etc on hand, and has a great place that has everything you need. It's in a cute neighborhood, walking distance from a grocery store and right by a bus stop. The kitchen was stocked enough that we managed to make brunch for guests. The place is roomy, clean, and relaxing. I really recommend it for a stay in Seattle!"
973859,7066674,2013-09-05,6885527,Tiffany,"Myself and four others rented Greg's place for a week long stay.  The apartment was perfect for us!  Everything was clean and looked like new, we loved having a kitchen to store leftovers or even make a meal  like we were home, and we all had plenty of room.  The apartment is so quaint and very quiet we had a great night sleep every night!  

Due to our groups busy schedule we never had the chance to meet Greg, but he took steps to ensure that we had everything we needed and so we were not reliant on making our schedules match up.  He made sure to give us all his contact info in case we needed anything or had questions, along with a great breakdown of where everything was in the place.  He went so far as to leave town maps, food suggestions, info on which buses to take to downtown (which took maybe 10 minutes to get to), a helpful app that made using the transit a breeze, even access to his Netflix account via the Roku!

Essentially I'm saying that if you need a place to stay in Seattle, Greg's place should be at the top of your list.  Each person in the party I was with said that they would stay there again no questions asked!  We all look forward to having another chance to visit Seattle and stay with Greg!
"
973859,7788297,2013-10-03,6672221,Marco Túlio,"Greg was an excellent host. His house was very clean, well organized and well equipped. When we told Greg we were missing a baking sheet, he quickly bought us one. Greg was constantly making sure everything was ok, and whenever we had any problems, he solved them promptly. He was also super nice."
973859,7924704,2013-10-08,8770775,Jason,This was our first stop on a 10 day adventure to the northwest and Greg's home set a high bar for all other places. Greg was a great host and checked on us daily to make sure we were taken care of. The home accommodated our group of 6 very comfortably. We would love to come back very soon!! 
973859,8149685,2013-10-18,2402572,Kyle,I had a great time staying here.  I stayed with a few work friends while we were in town for a work conference.  The house was comfortable and well equipped.  Our favorite aspect was the front deck with a grill and a fire pit.  We grilled out twice during our stay and made a fire one night.   Greg was extraordinarily accommodating and even made a trip to buy more firewood so we wouldn't have to carry firewood back by foot from the store.  I highly recommend staying here.  
973859,8354304,2013-10-27,9248778,Charis,"Even though my colleague and I weren't at Greg's airbnb for very much time during our stay, we really enjoyed the space and proximity to the Seattle University. I could tell that Greg has made a big effort to provide a comfortable, clean and pleasant space for guests. His photography on the walls was a bonus too! Thanks."
973859,8812943,2013-11-19,4996185,Kristal,My boyfriend and I spent two nights at Greg's place. He was very accomidating and nice.  We had everything we needed.  Greg also invited us to roast marshmallows and enjoy time with him and his friends.  Overall this was a perfect experience.  
973859,8977746,2013-11-30,6847129,Miles,"A wonderfully-decorated, tidy basement apartment that comfortably housed us! Would come back again for sure."
973859,9035993,2013-12-02,9731807,Etan,Greg's place is lovely and cozy. Parking was easy and it was very quite.
973859,9236426,2013-12-16,7118048,Julian,"My cousin and I stayed in Greg's space for an entire month while searching for a permanent residence. The apartment was beautiful with all the amenities of a fully functioning home. It's located on a quiet street, so we were able to sleep without any disturbances from outside. It was a short walk to downtown where there was a lot to see and do. Greg was very friendly and prompt to answer any questions we had over the duration of our stay. Overall our experience was very pleasant. I would defiantly recommend this apartment to a friend. "
973859,10785247,2014-03-07,12460470,Hao,"Greg's place is really nice and cozy, we can tell he put a lot of thoughts and ideas to make the place a awesome one. 5 of us had a really great time there. House is nice, clean and ready for us when we get there. The location is great, you can get to most places easily with bus. Highly recommended!"
973859,11078608,2014-03-19,11016487,Ricky,"This is a separated, fully decorated basement. It has kitchen, washing machine, TV... Basically everything you would expected in your home. The house is stylish, carefully taken care of. Me and my friends totally 5 people stayed there for 4 nights and it was perfect. 
One thing happened to us was that we parked our car in front of a white prayer house on a conor of one street nearby one night, and during the night, our car was hit by another very old Cadillac which we found the evidence on it. So we called 911, but the owner who showed up when we talked to the police said he didn't do it. According to the police, we can't do anything if there was no witness. But it was obvious that it was the one. We saw many prayers including the owner went out of the house after the police left.  It's too bad that people go to church and do crappy things. Anyway be careful when parking in this area."
973859,11494970,2014-04-05,13246674,Vanessa,"We truly felt ""home"" when we stayed there. So glad we decided to instead of a hotel. Everything was close by, close to downtown.   Greg was a great host! We will be back and stay there again!:-) "
973859,12337496,2014-04-29,4635446,Aaron,"Greg's apartment was very nice.  Totally as described.  Quiet, lovely neighborhood.  Enough room for the four people in our group and room to spare.  Greg was even kind enough to let us use his parking space all week.  We'd definitely stay here again."
973859,12391966,2014-05-01,11262079,Rachel,Greg was a gracious host and my friends and I felt safe and comfortable in his basement apartment. It's a wonderful spot for 2 to 3 people and very close to downtown. I would recommend it!
973859,13150119,2014-05-20,51214,David,We had a wonderful time in Seattle.  Greg was always very prompt and clear in his correspondence.  The basement flat is in an awesome neighborhood near Seattle University.  It was functionally furnished with very nice personal touches.  The handwritten tips on good coffee and eats were much appreciated.  Would definitely stay here again on any return trips to Seattle.
973859,13292852,2014-05-24,6707756,Marcio,Greg was a great host.... very friendly and helped us when needed. Unfortunately there was a construction site next door which we weren't aware of. His basement is very spacious and clean as described.
973859,13792995,2014-06-04,14018304,Julie,"Greg was a very gracious and accommodating host. The apartment was very clean and well organized - everything we needed was extremely easy to find. The neighborhood was awesome, and it was close to downtown. Only took us about 40 minutes to walk to Pike Place Market. There is construction right now so the mornings get a bit noisy, but it really did not bother us. All in all great experience. "
973859,14074973,2014-06-11,6079118,Katie And Christian,"My parents, brother, and sister-in-law stayed in Greg's 1st-floor apartment (on the lower-level of his house) for the weekend. They absolutely loved the space -- the brightness of the walls, the open layout, the room for the four of them to sprawl out. The beds were comfy (though they noted the sofa bed isn't great, the day bed is wonderful). Even though there's a lot of construction in the area, including on either side of the house,  you couldn't hear it once you were inside; my brother was able to sleep in just fine. :) Greg is communicative and kind, and he's available if you need something. Thanks, again, for hosting my folks, and we'll gladly recommend your place to our out-of-town guests again."
973859,14340356,2014-06-17,13110668,Meg,"Greg was very easy to deal with.  The neighborhood was perfect for us because we were in town for our older daughter's graduation (Seattle University) and she lives two houses away!  The apartment was very cute and clean, but small for the four of us (my husband, me, our younger daughter and my father).  Also, the sofa bed in the living room is very, very soft if you put the provided extra foam on it and very full of pokey wires if you don't.  I would recommend it only for children.  Currently there is a construction project going on next door.  The work didn't start until 8 am and Greg had kindly provided some additional insulation for the windows that are on that side, but even so if you intend to sleep in past 8 am over the next few months this is not the place for you.  We never needed to sleep in past that so it didn't bother us.  The provided sheets and towels were very nice, and there were plenty of pillows and blankets.  We didn't cook but having a fridge so we could do simple breakfasts was convenient.  There were enough dishes/glasses  etc. for the four of us."
973859,14735563,2014-06-25,13273185,Trevor,"Exactly as described! Perfect little place for our marathon crew. Great access to downtown and most attractions, and a quick walk to a bus stop for transportation. We had a car for part of the trip, and had zero trouble finding parking along the street. Greg was great to work with, and accommodated our needs."
973859,15036275,2014-07-01,5077988,Jamie,Myself and four other people stayed in Greg's lovely home. It was the perfect location in a quiet neighborhood. His home was very clean and had everything we needed for a comfortable stay. Greg was very accommodating and a pleasure to communicate with. Wouldn't hesitate to stay here again! 
973859,15670685,2014-07-14,533492,Chrys,"My girlfriend's family lives about an hour away from Seattle and they've never been able to go. This year, for her birthday, we all drove up to Seattle and spent a wonderful three days there! A huge part of our experience was the wonderful accommodations that Greg provided. The apt is exactly true to its listing, and despite some of the other reviews saying that it's too small for 6 people, we all agreed that it was perfectly spacious! Greg has his photography on the walls and it gives it a wonderfully comfortable, warm and inviting feel. He's also incredibly adept at anticipating needs and forewarned us of some possible noise next door due to some construction and provided ear plugs, just in case. He also came by with an additional fan in case it got too warm. We could not have asked for better!!"
973859,16073223,2014-07-22,10440847,Tristan,"Checkin was easy and smooth. Place was neat and simple. Greg was great about answering all inquiries before the trip and have thorough instructions for all house related needs. 
Place is definitely more suited for a family of five or less. We had five adults and felt cramped. Even four adults might be a bit crowded. 
Good location- not far from downtown or neighborhood bars/restaurants. "
973859,16401606,2014-07-27,15308559,Andrew,"You know that feeling you get when the thing you have your eye on meets your expectations? Well not only did it meet my expectations it exceeded them. 

The house is perfect proximity to everything a person would want to do in Seattle and is close to the interstate entrance and exits.

The apartment was immaculate, clean, and every well taken care of. I know a few three diamond hotels that could learn a thing or two from the experience we had at Greg's.

We will stay again."
973859,16824210,2014-08-03,13867550,Andrew,"Our family of three enjoyed our stay. The place is close to things yet not super hectic and is a nice, clean apartment that made our stay all the more enjoyable. The beds were comfortable and the parking was always pretty easy. 

Thanks for a great stay!"
973859,16984059,2014-08-05,15563496,Sophie,"Greg was incredibly communicative and very quick to reply to every question. It was very simple to gain access and the apartment was extremely well equipped, clean and quiet (there is construction work next door though at the moment but it didn't bother us as we are early risers). The neighbourhood seems to be very peaceful with a supermarket within an easily walkable distance. It is quite a long way to the centre of the city & the tourist attractions but we caught a bus very close by and taxis are relatively cheap. "
973859,17500687,2014-08-13,371717,Christopher,"Greg's place was great, it had everything my friends and I needed. The location is pretty good for getting downtown or to capital hill. "
973859,18307126,2014-08-25,16256829,Emma Kate,"Such a great experience! The place is very clean and nicely decorated. We felt right at home. The keycode lock is very convenient. I arrived late at night and didn't need to disturb anyone, and we didn't have to worry about a key while coming and going. Beautiful neighborhood. At night it is quiet and dark so I slept well. Beds were comfy too. Private little patio area was nice. Bus to downtown stops right at the end of the block. It is a basement, so there are no windows in the living area, but light comes in through the other room when you open the barn door. Also the second bed (grey couch) is not very big, so I'm glad I didn't have to share!"
973859,18786198,2014-09-01,14970547,Alyssa,"This is a great little apartment! We had no trouble finding it and the accommodations were on point. We had 4 people stay comfortably, and probably could have had another 2 without being too crowded.
 Generally the neighborhood is pretty quiet, the only time there was a lot of noise was on the weekend. Fortunately Greg provides earplugs, so we were able to sleep through the celebrations. 
The apartment is well taken care of and has lovely artwork hanging all around. Will definitely consider staying here again next time I'm in Seattle. 
Thanks again Greg!"
973859,19376808,2014-09-11,19733695,Christophe,"Greg's place was perfect for our stay : beautiful, good location. If back one day in Seattle, sure we'll stay at Greg's"
973859,19823651,2014-09-19,11483183,Veranika,"We were in Seattle for a conference on 5th ave. The house is walkable to downtown area so we were able to walk every day. Eventhough it was the basement of the host's house, it was 100% independent. Greg has also been very helpful and responsive."
973859,19932169,2014-09-21,18431375,Patricia,The house was easy to find and easy to get into the house.  The house was very clean and everything we needed was there.  We loved that it was easy to get to the bus stop to downtown.  That was very helpful.  We loved every minute we stayed in that house. The house was nice.
973859,21036096,2014-10-10,20004927,Jens,Had a great stay at Greg´s house. Very clean and comfortable and close to everything. About 10 minutes by car to downtown with great shopping opportunities. Got good directions to the attractions of Seattle by Greg and would definitely stay here again.
973859,21977675,2014-10-27,22302411,真理子,"We could have great time in this house.
Location is good, there is bus stop to downtown nearby the house. In the house, there was so clean and comfortable beds and anything. I hope I can stay here again."
973859,22310471,2014-11-03,17057653,Ashley,"The mother-in-law apartment of this cozy home on the outskirts of Cap Hill was a great location in reference to the wonderful restaurants, bars, and vibrant scene that the neighborhood has to offer. The home is located in a residential area that is quiet and provides some sanctuary from the bustle of city life. The unit was clean and organized and Greg left a very comprehensive list of things to do and see around Seattle. I would definitely come back! "
973859,22555740,2014-11-09,23131734,Laurie,"The place was perfect!  Clean, inviting and in a quiet neighborhood.  The plus was being only 10 blocks from the medical center.  Would stay again and recommend to others.  Thanks Greg!"
973859,23801854,2014-12-10,14652203,Michael,Description was accurate; we liked the place a lot. Very functional and practical for our needs. Good location -- close proximity to all points in the city.
973859,24221400,2014-12-23,18173883,Michele,"Greg provided a very detailed information on how to get into the apartment, what's available for our use, reminders, transport information, neighbourhood, recommendations on restaurants, bars, etc, days before our arrival.  The info sheet was a little too long but every information was very useful.

The apartment smelled really good and was very clean.  I have a very sensitive sense of smell and can't stand the faintest foul smell.  Plus I have allergies so I would know if a place is not dusted well.  I was very impressed with Greg's place.

Towels were freshly washed and even looked new.

I was afraid the place will be somehow dark owing to the fact that it's in the basement.  Greg had the proper lighting, maintaining a good balance between full bright/white light and yellow/dimmed lights.

I also like the fact that the place is fully carpeted and that the carpet does not stink.  There are some carpet stains here and there but it did not feel dirty or yucky at all.

Greg left us with enough privacy yet made sure we knew he is just there when we need anything.

I definitely recommend this place."
973859,24399970,2014-12-28,14068015,Ashton,"We had a great time in Greg's house. The list of information about things to do in the area, bars, parks, places to eat, where to catch the bus from etc was extremely comprehensive and a great help!
We really enjoyed our time there and would highly recommend to everyone!
Thanks so much!"
973859,24831545,2015-01-03,22861660,Sarah,"Greg was an excellent host!
We really felt like we had our own space while visiting, and it was so cute and cozy. He was very proactive in keeping us informed about our upcoming trip, and even provided us with a list of places to visit in the city. Whenever we wanted somewhere to eat, shop, tour, dance, etc. all we had to do was consult his thorough and helpful list of suggestions.
The apartment was clean and stocked with essential cooking supplies as well as extra towels and blankets. He was very thorough in his preparations and it made my group's stay in Seattle very memorable.
Thanks for your attention to detail, Greg!"
973859,25465384,2015-01-17,2734499,Jason,Great space. It was clean and well equipped with everything I needed. Perfect for an extended stay. Good location. Easy to find street parking. I would stay again and recommend this space. 
973859,31047589,2015-05-01,15063439,Jake,"What a pleasant experience. I thoroughly enjoyed my stay at this apartment, and would definitely stay here again. Greg was a great host and was there if we needed anything. "
973859,31807422,2015-05-10,31085848,Topi,Everything was perfect! The apartment was located in a nice and peaceful neighborhood and it was relatively close to the downtown. Enjoyed our stay!
973859,32066535,2015-05-13,17029253,Kristen,"This flat was absolutely perfect for us - two comfortable bedrooms plus a spacious walk-in wardrobe for my toddler's travel crib, a neat little kitchen with washer/drier, and a chill out room with Netflix provided. It was nicely decorated but child-friendly. The bus stop was only a minute up the road and the trip downtown was easy. There are at least three great playgrounds in easy walking distance, with grocery stores and restaurants only a short drive away."
973859,32233765,2015-05-16,27537625,Amber,"The place was exactly as shown, in a great quiet and safe neighborhood.  It was perfect for the three of us because we all had our own spaces.  It was clean and had everything we needed to have a great trip to Seattle.  Greg is friendly and very responsive, and gave us all the information about the apartment and surrounding area that was helpful.  I highly recommend staying here, especially if you are staying for an extended period of time.  This was our first Airbnb experience and it has encouraged us to do it again after such a wonderful vacation. "
973859,32712378,2015-05-20,24913458,Yang,"We stayed there for 5 nights, very convenient location, room is very good, easy to find parking spot.
Greg is very friendly and provides us with many useful tourism information."
973859,33097356,2015-05-25,24973009,Shayla,"Staying at Greg's was so great! Super close to downtown, Chinatown, Pike's, and everywhere else touristy. I really enjoyed my stay and felt right at home as soon as I got in. Greg was great, he was easy to contact and texted back at a reasonable amount of time. I cannot wait for my next trip to Seattle, I already know where I'll be staying! "
973859,33689549,2015-05-31,1263023,Jennifer,"We had a great stay at Greg's place. It had everything we needed and the giant closet came in handy for keeping things out of each others' way. Greg was a friendly but unobtrusive host. We didn't get a chance to use the Cascades-style fire pit, but it looked great! We would definitely stay there again if our path takes us to Seattle in the future."
973859,34124911,2015-06-05,30019026,Tom,"Greg's place was better than what my friends and I expected, mostly because it was the first time we used this website.  The place was clean, modern, the kitchen was stocked with cooking-ware, and it was spacious.  After driving from Wisconsin and sleeping in a mini-van for two nights and a tent for two more nights, this place really started off our visit to Seattle very well.  

We never actually met Greg face-to-face but we did communicate through email which was fine.  He provided a booklet right next to the sofa that tells you everything you need to know about your stay.

Walking to downtown isn't terrible but you probably should consider driving or taking a cab if you plan on going there more than once.  Also, we never had problem parking on the street.  

I would definitely choose to stay here again if I were visiting."
973859,35288911,2015-06-17,23989,Kelly,"What a fantastic, cute, accommodating space for my family to stay at during graduation weekend. Location was perfectly close to Seattle University by car. Accommodated 3-4 people well as there were 3 beds/couches. 
Greg's instructions were very clear. He was also very responsive during our stay, even when the internet went out. "
973859,35580744,2015-06-20,15349103,Andrew,"The apartment was excellent, Greg was always very quick to respond, and his recommendations for places to go were not only just what we are looking for, but very thorough. Definitely recommend."
973859,35772148,2015-06-22,11704688,Pat,"Greg was very helpful and responded to my questions via email without delay. The house is in a quiet neighborhood and it was found just as advertised. It is close to die
Wnt own, only a 20 minute bus ride and was easy to use public transportation to get around. "
973859,36991119,2015-07-03,33001109,Lei,房子地理位置非常好，虽然是半地下但卫生状况极好，好停车
973859,37313970,2015-07-06,10704568,Alex,"Our stay was lovely! Very close to bus stops, Greg was such an accommodating host - allowed us to leave our luggage after check out so we could explore the city a little more before flying out. He also provided a great detailed list of things to do and see around Seattle which was great as well. All around great find for an AirBnB!"
973859,37763797,2015-07-10,9738481,Ana,"Greg is an excellent host, he provide a list of activities and places to visit during our stay in Seattle.
The apartment was clean and comfortable."
973859,39004143,2015-07-20,16681558,Leslie,"The host is very welcoming and communications are easy.  Half my party moved on and was replaced by another family during our stay, and the host was helpful in providing ample clean linens ect. for the transition. The listing page is for a unit with 3 sleeping spaces.  One is a proper bedroom, the other has a sofa/trundle bed that is large enough for 2.  Firm alone and wonderful with the pad.  The living room area has a pull out sofa bed.  This mattress is very thin, the pad actually has to go here if anyone is using this bed.  I had thought it had four sleeping spaces from the pictures, but there are actually 2 pictures of the same room with different futons.  The bus to downtown is very convenient, and it is easy to take bus and light rail to and from SEA TAC.  It was unusually hot when we visited and the convenience of a bus line a block away was very helpful.  I did not rent a car, and didn't miss it.  I'd say this home is on the outer edge of a great neighborhood.  It borders on a less desirable area.  Parking can be difficult.  The Unit itself was the nicest of the 4 air b and b's we'd collectively stayed in.  It is sparkling clean and everything works.  WIFI is spotty.  There were 6 of us, and we were comfortable and had plenty of room.  Note; the firepit and yard space is in the front yard of the upstairs unit.  This is a basement unit.  Unlike other's we stayed in, It has no basement smell and several windows, and is quite pleasant. "
973859,39725320,2015-07-26,24876700,Danny,"This place was exactly as advertised.  We were all very happy with the accommodations.  Greg was friendly and helpful. 

Thanks!"
973859,40727094,2015-08-02,1892377,Francois,"Confortable up to 6 persons. Convenient self-check-in. Well furnished and clean appartement. 

Calm neighbourhood just outside downtown and easily accessible by transport. Plan for your meals are there is no grocery store at walking distance. Cool experience at a Ethiopian restaurant nearby. "
973859,41581278,2015-08-08,6416330,Janet,"Greg was very generous with me, because of a family health issue ( my father in Hospice) , we were very disorganized to say the least.  I had many changes to our original reservation and was very scattered in my communication, Greg remained supportive throughout out.  His offering was  well represented and accurate, he sent a very detailed email, run down of everything about the house, area and just about anything anyone could ask for to support a great visit.  Greg has great generosity of spirit and I would recommend this property for anyone visiting the downtown area of Seattle.....LOVELY city!
"
973859,42262356,2015-08-12,29130739,Yize,A great place. The host is awesome.
973859,42666232,2015-08-15,32137458,Alexandra,"Hi, Greg
Your flat was a really great experience. Thank you for all
We will recommand it to our friends
"
973859,43502809,2015-08-20,10980234,Marion,All instructions were clear and accurate. Greg stayed in touch as soon as we made the booking and again a couple of weeks before our arrival and again the day before arrival. The location was ideal and very easy to get around to see the sites. We would recommend this location. All we needed.
973859,45784742,2015-09-06,849739,Efrain,"Greg was great with all the information and details about the place.
The apartment was clean and as pictured. The nieghborhood is quiet and central to a lot of cool shops. 

My mates and I were very satisfied. Thanks a lot Greg for hosting!!"
973859,46298973,2015-09-09,21675619,Jamie,This apartment was perfect for our trip to Seattle. It was well presented and in a great location being only 20 mins to downtown and 15 mins walk to capitol hill. There was also ample parking available on the street at any time of day.
973859,46594461,2015-09-12,21416714,Jacqueline,"Greg's home looked exactly as it did in all of his uploaded photos. I was so happy to find such a great place and even more so once I arrived. There was a total of 5 of us staying here. We arrived late and had absolutely no trouble finding the place and getting inside. All 5 of us were happy with our bed arrangements. 1 bedroom, 2 separate ""living"" rooms with couches. Both of which turn into beds. All 3 beds are queen sized and very comfortable. We couldn't believe that this was a basement! It is so clean and bright. It could not have been any more perfect. Not to mention, Greg has an amazing list of things to do in Seattle. This place is super close to some great nightlife in Capitol Hill as well."
973859,47110810,2015-09-15,43206764,Yao,"We have spent 3 days staying at Greg's apartment and felt at home. It was a good experience. The house was very clean and tidy. And we got whatever we wanted for staying like clean towels, sheets, pillows, etc. The location was pretty good too. It was a quiet and safe community. We were very pleased to find this place!"
973859,47668428,2015-09-21,38977161,April,Greg was very easy to work with. He was easy to contact and the keypad was most convenient. Location was perfect for a business trip and the buses were relatively quick. I would recommend Greg's place to a friend.
973859,48726267,2015-09-28,37439314,Jonathan,"Greg and his spot are awesome. While we only communicated remotely, Greg was responsive and very helpful with all of his communication. Just before I arrived, he sent me an incredibly helpful message that contained any information I'd need to know during my trip. This included extensive information about the spot and the surrounding area. Greg went above and beyond to make sure our stay was comfortable.

The spot itself is great. There were 5 people in total occupying the space and it was more than accommodating. It has everything you'd need for an extended stay, including a full kitchen and washer / dryer. Everything is very well stocked, too. This ranges from cooking equipment, to a fully stocked bathroom, to extra chairs / pads to sleep on, to entertainment items (a Roku box, cable, DVDs, all kinds of good stuff). The area is a quiet neighborhood setting, but only minutes of a drive away from downtown. We were in Seattle for a music festival that took place all over the city, so we had to take Ubers everywhere, but they're plentiful. The longest we had to wait was only a few minutes.  There's also a Trader Joe's and plenty of places to eat within a short drive.

Overall, it was a fantastic experience and I would highly recommend Greg and his space."
973859,50455770,2015-10-12,24843181,Katie,"The place was exactly as it appeared in the photos. It was very clean as well. The location is great, a quick uber/bus downtown and some good coffee shops and restaurants within walking distance (10 minutes). We came back one day to a couple umbrellas sitting outside our door as it was supposed to rain, very thoughtful.  We didn't actually meet Greg but the accommodations were perfect!"
973859,51035403,2015-10-17,7535847,Nicole,"The space was great, well maintained and quiet. We were close to downtown and several parks and coffee shops. It worked perfectly for my family, and the kids were happy to watch TV after a big day of adventuring in Seattle."
973859,52833477,2015-11-02,43036216,Jared,"This place was great!  Very comfortable and accommodating.  Nice location, lots to do nearby.  Greg provides an extensive list of places to go and things to do while you're visiting Seattle which I found very helpful.  He also has some great photography (his own work) framed around the house, a handful of which can be controlled by a dimmer switch.  It's pretty cool!  I hope to visit Seattle again next year, and I'll definitely be considering Greg's place as an option if it's available."
973859,57589301,2015-12-27,20521300,Nancy,We had a great time! Very nice facility and we appreciated that it is a functional kitchen supplied for a cook.
708774,3082551,2012-12-13,2846307,Richard,"As advertised, a clean very central apartment with all the amenities provided.  A bargain at the price.  Quiet, comfortable with good and easy parking.  All instructions were clear and the building was everything advertised and more.  I would stay here again without hesitation."
708774,3186563,2012-12-30,1486821,Dolly,"Apartment was very clean - exactly as pictured.  Great location!  Easy parking, walking distance to convenience store, coffee shops and restaurants.  Short drive to nearly all areas of interest. If looking at the map and nervous about being so close to the highway, don't be!  During our 8 day stay, we never heard the highway (or any noise from the neighbors)."
708774,4010334,2013-04-02,5478592,Nancy,"Apartment was just as advertised and worked well for our family of four. Location is only a few blocks from the east side of Lake Union- a great neighborhood for walks and runs. We never met our host, but William was quick to respond to any questions we had and went out of his way to return some items we'd accidentally left behind."
708774,4885950,2013-05-31,5200030,Julianna & Bob,"We had an excellent stay on William's property.  The home is in incredible condition, and it looks EXACTLY the way it does in the photos, which we really appreciated.  William was very responsive and easy to communicate with.  All instructions regarding our stay (regarding parking, internet use, location of keys, etc.) were extremely clear and accurate.  
All of the appliances / amenities are brand new/great condition, and the home has everything one might need.  It was very easy to feel right at home here during our stay.  
Also, location of the apartment within Seattle is fantastic for those who are trying to experience a fun, convenient authentic Seattle neighborhood."
708774,6430083,2013-08-12,7186917,Cindy,"Very well appointed and in a great location for exploring the Capital Hill area. Although close to the freeway, you can't hear car traffic unless the windows are open. Easy on and off I-5. Clean and cozy with everything you need for a long weekend!"
708774,7185983,2013-09-09,8635901,Borja,The apartment is great. Perfectly clean and lovely style. We did not meet William but he has a very simple method to let you in and fulls the house with small details to make your stay great!
708774,7895803,2013-10-07,9013954,Victoria,"My friends and I stayed for a long weekend for a wedding and we could not have been more comfortable! Very clean, private, and well appointed with amenities without being too cluttered with stuff. Conveniently located near stores, restaurants, and public transit. There was also plenty of off-street parking though we didn't have a car. William was very helpful and professional. I preferred staying here immensely over getting a tiny hotel room and would definitely stay again upon my next trip to Seattle. "
708774,9185827,2013-12-11,10358238,Aimee,"My mom and I stayed here for a week while we were in town apartment-hunting for my relocation to the area. This apartment was everything that the posting and the reviews indicated and was the perfect spot for us to stay. Arrival information was great, and it was easy to get access to the apartment. It is incredibly clean and nicely decorated. It is a garden-level apartment, but we heard almost no noise from outside. It was super-convenient to get around town, and had easy access to I-5.  We had my car, and there was always a place to park onsite, so we never had to search for parking.  We did not take the bus while we were there, but it is only two blocks away.  It had all of the necessary components to make us feel at home for the week, and we were sorry to have to leave. Thanks for letting us stay!"
708774,9293145,2013-12-19,1308083,Milner,"The apartment looked EXACTLY the way it is shown in the pictures.  It was very clean and nice and my mother, who is the harshest critic of cleanliness, was perfectly content. .  And even though it is very close to I-5, you cannot hear the traffic.  The only issue we had was the upstairs neighbors who played loud music until 12:30 AM on Friday and Saturday night-- that being said, it was the weekend. During the week, there was not a noise issue.  Overall, I would definitely stay here again. "
708774,10654250,2014-03-02,305879,Evelyn,"I stayed at this garden level apartment for 1 month while I looked for a permanent home in Seattle (just moved to the city).  It was a perfect location, super clean and looked EXACTLY like the pictures.  William responded to any questions within minutes and was very helpful.  Parking was easy and walking to public transit took less than 5mins.  Would definitely recommend this place!"
708774,10746024,2014-03-05,2200769,Ashley,"We had a great stay in this cool and comfy apartment. The apartment felt very clean, the bed was comfortable, and the location was ideal for getting around the city.  Parking was fairly convenient when a spot was open on the property. The only drawback we found was the loud music that the upstairs neighbor played late into the night on the weekends. That, and the smell of smoke upon entering the apartment building. Luckily, the apartment itself always smelled fresh and clean, and for that we were thankful! We would definitely recommend staying here if you are looking for an affordable and clean place to rest your head while in Seattle! "
708774,11246253,2014-03-26,5603975,Corri,"Phenominal stay!   A++++ accommodations.  William is the perfect host by providing lots of information before, during, and after the stay. The apartment is FULLY equiped (kitchen and bathroom too!), and I was not lacking any creature comforts.  The apartment was also pristine and incredibly clean.   The pictures are spot on and no exaggeration.  It was extremely quiet at all hours of the day and night, and the neighbors were friendly (if I saw anyone at all).  Since there are only 4 apartments, it is extremely private.

The location is perfect as it is walking distance to the water, great restaurants for any meal, and a market.  It is located just over a bridge to UW and Seattle is a 10 minute ride by car or public transportation. Off street parking was available at all times, but William generously even provided a parking pass for on street parking if needed.

I cannot thank William enough for making my trip to Seattle memorable!!  :-)"
708774,11709701,2014-04-13,7688443,Alisoune,"We had a great stay, great ovation in Seattle."
708774,13061392,2014-05-19,5488118,Amy,"The apartment was exactly as described, very clean, well furnished and a great place. William left lots of information about the neighborhood/city if you're not familiar with the area. We lived just a stones throw from this apartment for 6 years and it was great to be back in the 'hood. As one other reviewer said, on the weekend you could here neighbors play music which wasn't a big deal for us at all; wassn't that loud. We were also impressed that there was no noise from the 5 freeway which is what we would have expected. We had a terrific stay and look forward to staying here again in the future! 

Amy and Daniel"
708774,13508875,2014-05-29,5447844,Sam,"This lake union apartment was amazing. It's in a great location, close walk to a mini park on the water, amazing cafés, a mountain bike park under i5, close to Capitol Hill and more. The apartment was clean and cute and exactly as advertised. I would rent this apartment again in a heart beat. The Murano glass Italian light fixture was beautiful!"
708774,14530978,2014-06-21,13273683,Allison,"Cool and comfy is right! The apartment was private, clean, well stocked and easily accessible. It's a great place to use as a home base while in Seattle for pleasure or business. William was prompt with all his communications and provided detailed and efficient information on everything the area had to offer and any questions that may arise. "
708774,14842940,2014-06-27,9287951,Erika,"Easy to check in and in a great location.  The place was clean, comfortable and as described in the overview.  Internet worked great and I had no problem logging in.  The only drawback is it's location on the basement level makes it a little loud in the morning while upstairs tenants are leaving."
708774,16452826,2014-07-28,956382,Andrea,"Coordinating the reservation of this great apartment was seamless and easy. William provided great details to me, making check-in breeze. I didn't need anything throughout my stay, but if I had, I'm confident the host would've been of great assistance. The location of the apartment was wonderful. Close to great restaurants, safe neighborhood, some convenient stores close by, and close to a bus stop. And when I mean close, I mean within a 5-10 minute walk! The apartment itself was clean, comfortable and welcoming. Another plus for us was having a washer and dryer, since we were traveling with a baby. I highly recommend this place if you're looking for a great place to stay in Seattle!"
708774,18875193,2014-09-02,15793999,Lorryn,"I loved this place! Extremely clean and well maintained. Property looks just like the photos. I received an email with all the information I needed and no issues accessing the property. It's very close to I5, which is convenient, but it made no noise issues either. I will definitely stay here again. "
708774,19201020,2014-09-08,776392,Noni,"William made us feel welcome on our trip and gave a lot of good information about local attractions, restaurantes, cafes and bars. The listing was accurate and the place was just as pictured. It was indeed cool and comfy and a great location close to a lot of different things to do in Seattle. 

The neighborhood was close enough to the downtown area to take a longer walk or short bus ride. The apartment was in a very nice quiet neighborhood close to lake union. A great place to walk around and explore or take a short bus, uber, lyft, car2go ride to surrounding neigborhoods like Fremont, Capitol Hill and the University area. "
708774,22228447,2014-11-02,5778790,Erin,"I stayed here for a month and was completely happy with my decision! Everything worked perfectly, the apartment was quiet and peaceful, and I enjoyed using the kitchen, which was well stocked with utensils, pots/pans, etc. There's lots of storage in the bedroom, which is really helpful for longer stays. When a maintenance issue arose, William was on it and it was fixed in a matter of hours. I enjoyed the neighborhood and the easy commute to work in the SLU neighborhood. Totally satisfied and would definitely return. I also appreciated the detailed instructions received well in advance about all the aspects of the apartment, how to get in, and parking. A+"

The location was perfect for us as it was less than 10 minutes from the places we needed to be. The neighborhood was perfect, quiet, great food and drinks. Everything about the apartment was as listed on the website, very comfortable , clean and parking was never an issue(huge plus). We will stay here again anytime we are in Seattle."
708774,23428192,2014-12-01,1680280,Sarah,"This is a great apartment in a lovely, quiet neighborhood. Close to downtown and easy to get around via public transit. Voxx Coffee down the street is great. "

He helped us and even allowed us to stay a tad longer so we didn't have to wait in a coffee shop a whole afternoon for our flight!!! I had the chance to meet him when we were about to leave and William was very very nice! We really enjoyed the apartment and you can't beat the location! We took the bus every day to go downtown but we also walked there it was fabulous! Highly recommend it
708774,25551835,2015-01-19,19651628,Garen,"William's apartment was fantastic! Everything was how he had described it in the listing. The bed was comfortable, the kitchen was fully equipped, the TV/entertainment system was brand new. The apartment is conveniently located between 2 major bus stops, providing access to over 7 bus lines. Everything was clean and in order when we arrived. 

An overall perfect experience! "

It was a great place for me to stay on a business trip, but would have been large enough for a couple, too. William provided all of the information I needed, and it was easy to check in and out on my own. The building was quiet.

Eastlake is a great neighborhood with plenty of food options within walking distance. Make sure to take a walk along the lake!"

He was extremely diligent, organized, and responsive with all our communication, plus shared some great recommendations that helped make our first visit to Seattle really memorable. The place was exactly as advertised - really clean, comfortable, cozy, and cutely decorated. Very true to the pictures. The location was also great. Eastlake neighborhood is cute with a couple of great spots for coffee and brunch, and a very short drive to all the fun stuff in Capitol Hill and downtown. Would definitely consider staying there again and would highly recommend to others. "

Would always want  stay here when visit Seattle. 
Thank you for having us "
708774,45271009,2015-09-01,37363773,Aileen,"William's place was just as described: clean and comfortable, not to mention thoughtfully laid out and conveniently located. The place itself was immaculate and tastefully furnished. William thought to provide all the little things including toiletries, condiments, coffee, tea and even Tupperware! This was my first airbnb experience and staying here left a great first impression. William was very responsive and provided all the information we needed for our stay. All in all a perfect stay in Seattle."
708774,46139140,2015-09-08,17733614,Jayme,Beautiful apartment. Very clean. The instructions William provided were great. We really appreciated the list of restaurants that were in walking distance. We found the bed a little uncomfortable for our taste- a bit squeaky- but everything else was great! The location was quiet and safe and close to everything we wanted to see. Kitchen was fully stocked which came in handy when we heated up some leftovers! 
708774,48931552,2015-09-29,19602163,Jessica,"Fantastic  !!! Immaculate apartment , lovely neighborhood . I enjoyed this more than a hotel stay . My only other experience with air bnb was a terrible one , so I was wary of trying again. All of the hotels in the area were booked , so I had no choice but to try (website hidden) thankful I did ! The place was clean , new , and centrally located . It was even better than pictured. Extremely comfortable bed , roomy living room and kitchen , all complete with necessary amenities. William was the perfect host - quick to respond and extremely helpful before our stay , and left us alone to enjoy our time while we were there . Would stay here again in a heartbeat , and am now looking forward to other air bnb experiences . "
708774,49322704,2015-10-03,28252455,Elizabeth,"I could not recommend this place enough! Bill was great to work with and the place was fantastic. We could tell that there had been a lot of care and thoughtfulness put into the amenities, instructions, communication, and design- it was really perfect for guests.  We did not have any issues with noise or the upstairs neighbors as other reviewers had mentioned.

Our favorite part was the location! After spending each day in the city and/or high traffic tourist spots, it was so refreshing to escape to a slightly quieter and less congested feeling location. We loved that we could still walk to coffee, dinner, drinks, etc where we were staying- the neighborhood was great! And, while we enjoyed being away from the busier areas, we loved the close proximity to everything we wanted to do. We were easily able to walk to get to downtown each day.

Highly recommend!"
708774,50188229,2015-10-10,42612388,Michael,"The listing was just as described. The instructions for finding the unit were perfect. The location was great for short Uber rides to downtown or any other district in the Seattle area. I loved the layout, cleanliness, and attention to detail of the apartment and would love to stay there again. The kitchen was amazing and great for buying groceries to prepare meals to save a couple bucks during your stay. William even provided a parking pass which was perfect for my sister to come visit. On top of that William went to the trouble of providing a great list of local (walking distance) eatery's and a great ""to see"" guide.  Thank you so much William!!"

3155785,42231253,2015-08-11,40706723,Stephanie,"Kim was great and responsive to meeting up to handoff the key, provide the address, etc.  This was my first Airbnb experience and I was a single female traveling alone and felt very safe at Kim and her roommate's place."
3155785,42629386,2015-08-14,40820299,Robert,I loved staying with Kim.  She was a great host and the retro vintage house is exactly as advertised.  My room had a private bathroom which made the stay even better.  Highly recommended!
3155785,43310332,2015-08-18,40860651,Thomas,"Kim was warm, friendly, and real. Thanks, Kim! The room I rented was big and clean. It had its own bathroom with shower! I liked the diverse pictures and sculptures through the place.  And I guess I like short sentences. "
3155785,46005974,2015-09-07,5053560,Kevin,I did not meet Kim during my visit. I stayed in her room while she was out of town. The room is nice and the bathroom and shower were fine. I only briefly met the other roommates. 
3258213,15775255,2014-07-15,11965444,Julia,"Donna was kind and considerate. Our long vacation got to be too much and we just wanted to move in a day early. She was quick to accommodate. Thank you! 

About the house... The photos are a great representation of the home. It was warm and inviting. It was also very clean. The beds were comfortable and Donna left us plenty of information to enjoy the kayaks at the very close lake! Also, there are a lot of great places to eat nearby with full kitchen facilities.

The washer and dryer were a great addition to our vacation. We did bring quite a bit of clothes and other things with us, but it was great to have the w/d close to leave with all of our clothes clean.

I highly recommend this home if you are looking for a centrally located place to call home for a little while. We stayed here for 15 days and we were very sad to leave.

Parking was never a problem. There was plenty just read the signs because there is a school bus area with earlier hours.

We just can't thank Donna enough for making us feel welcome during our first days of living in Seattle!"
3258213,16140438,2014-07-22,8891006,Jean Paul,"We spent a marvelous 3 days in Donna's house in Seattle.
The location is perfect for ""the museum of flight"" or an incredible helicopter tour with Pacific Northwest Helicopter or for kayaking on the lake.
Access to downtown Seattle is easy with the I-5.

The house is nestled on top of a hill with a nice garden in the back (we saw hummingbirds and a Jeller's jay).
We specially enjoyed the wide terrace in the back in the house.
The rooms are big and welcoming.

Of course the kayaks are a major bonus, we went on the nearby lake and had a wonderful time (the waters are very quiet).

Donna went out of her way to make our stay memorable (kudos for the fresh raspberries from the garden when we arrived).

We will definitely try to stay there next time we are in the area and recommend the house to our friends ."
3258213,17973051,2014-08-19,19130387,Josey,"Donna is such an awesome lady who made our 5 days trip in Seattle. Donna's house is just like a house in fairytales, which is so adorable and so nice. You don'y need to worry about the transportation even if you don'd drive. Because it's so convenient to take bus number 7 to go out. You just need to walk 5 mins to go to the bus station from her house. Nothing is better than have such a great staying experience with this reasonable price. What is more important is you will get to know this awesome lady---Donna!!!
By the way, Cassie is totally recovered now. Thank you again for your care and help, and don't need to worry about her. We miss you so much!!!! We love you! Hope your life will treat you well just like how well you treat it. Have great days. "
3258213,18495145,2014-08-27,19709651,Angel,"Donna, our host was excellent. From my very first interactions with her, she was more then willing to share information and helpful tips with me about the area of Seattle in relation to her home. She picked us up from the airport and even let us stop on the way to her home, at the grocery. All this was a tremendous help to us and made our travel  much easier. She gave us helpful directions to different places we wanted to go and informed us on bus routes, areas to visit and good restaurants. "
3258213,18746937,2014-08-31,4853210,Julia,Staying with Donna was great! She was welcoming and helpful from the moment that we booked with her. She also had great recommendations to help us make the most of our vacation! The room was very comfortable and Donna made sure we felt at home.

We especially appreciated to spent some time with her, talking about travelling, cultures and so many different subjects.
Her house is peaceful, you can enjoy the sun on her deck. We could easily have stayed there forever."

3258213,19641522,2014-09-15,8145055,Stephanie,"Staying at Donna's place is AWESOME!  She accommodated us last minute and was extremely helpful.  She also extended the bed so that my very tall husband was able to sleep comfortably.  We were not able to use the Kayaks this time, but will definitely do so when we stay with her the next time.  I recommend staying with Donna as this was a positive experience using airbnb.  Thanks again Donna for all your helpful tips and if I am in the Seattle area I will send you a message."
3258213,20104256,2014-09-23,13938647,Sunny,"Donna is not only a host, but also a care giver and a wonderful friend. My mom and I were in a speedy vocation and Donna went out of her way to make sure our stay was comfortable. She have great recommendations for places to visit and eat, but the kayaks at Lake Washington was definitely a highlight of our trip. I have had some bad experiences with my airbnb host previous to this trip and I was honestly expecting the worst. But Donna made our visit in Seattle so wonderful I fell in love with the city as soon as I met her at the airport. I would give Donna a six star out of five, stay with her! You won't regret it!"
3258213,21088945,2014-10-11,21268540,Suvil,"I had a great time while my stay at Donna's place. I loved the peaceful atmosphere, the most beautiful patio and the backyard. Donna is truly a great human being, she is kind, generous and very helpful. I felt absolutely at home. Donna's place would me my first choice to stay next time I visit seattle. Also do go kayaking if u are staying here the kayaks are the icing on the cake. "
3258213,21243677,2014-10-13,21824651,Lyn,"Donna was lovely!  She totally made me feel at home.  I had the best time sitting over tea and chatting about our families, life, travels.  She was ready to help me navigate the streets of Seattle, so I could find what I was looking for!  The room is bigger than the pictures and I melted at the view and how comfortable the bed is.  Thank you for a wonderful, quiet time."
3258213,21561799,2014-10-19,22502657,Tom,"Staying with Donna is like staying with a good friend. We had a great stay at her lovely house in a quiet and safe neighbourhood of Seattle. The room was above and beyond our expectations, with everything we could possibly need, and an incredibly comfortable bed. We didn't see much of Donna but when we did she was very hospitable, helpful and kind. She went out of her way twice to drop us off at the station. And her knowledge and suggestions of things to do in the area were very much appreciated. I thoroughly recommend staying with Donna!"
3258213,21985575,2014-10-27,15936304,Anne,"Donna was a wonderful host.  She made us feel so at home.  We did not see much of her (her busy schedule) or her of us (our busy schedule).  We had a key and came and went as needed.  
Her home is very comfortable and clean.  Could not have asked for more.  
Thanks for everything.  We will be back!"

3258213,33391940,2015-05-27,1524361,Samantha,"Donna was an amazing hostess! Our only regret is that we couldn't spend more time with her. She and her home are incredibly warm and inviting and we couldn't be happier with our stay. The space is very comfortable, private and has everything you might need. Donna has great recommendations for what to do and how to get around the city like a local and great places off the beaten path. The neighborhood is awesome, diverse and filled with beautiful gardens, cool little houses and great coffee shops and restaurants nearby. It was also a great location for us since it's close to the highway and allows easy access to hiking outside the city and to gorgeous parks nearby. We didn't have time for the kayaks but we are making it a priority for our next visit! Thank you so much, Donna, for opening your home to us and the opportunity to share stories. Hope to see you again soon!"
3258213,33630971,2015-05-30,18801852,Claudia,"Donna is such a great host, warm and very attentive to our confort. The house is so cosy, clean, with a beautiful terrace (perfect for taking your breakfast). We had a big light room with a private bathroom and breakfast. Easy access to public transportation and free parking in the street. We didn't have time for kayaking but it is a good thing to do. Thank you Donna."

The place itself is way better than the photos & description; the room is very spacious, comfy and cozy! Great location & awesome experience! Thank you!"
3258213,35810379,2015-06-22,32857323,Ashley,"Donna was the perfect host. She left the keys easy to find and the room ready to be used. She lives about 10-15 mins from Downtown, depending on traffic. She was really nice in recommending places to go around Seattle. We even met her sister who is as fun as her.  The room is big and comfortable, it was clean and with lost of homey feeling.  Donna found out it was my birthday and help my sister have a mini celebration. My sister and I felt at home and would recommend Donna any time. I would definitely go to Donna's again if I visit Seattle in the near future. "
3258213,36133794,2015-06-25,35608853,Anh,"Just like Iwona (a couple reviews back) said: ""Do not think twice, book it right away if it is available!"". And I'm glad I did. The room was perfectly sized, with 2 tables (one on each side of the room), and accompany chairs for you to do some work. Everything is clean and set aside for you. Donna even had bath towels, hand towels, and bathrobes with slippers for me to use. Donna even allowed us to check into the house earlier than usual (9 am) to make sure we won't have to wait around after landing in Seattle. 

In short, staying with Donna was the best decision we made on this trip. She was sweet, kind, wonderful, and a thoughtful host. She made sure we were able to get to our Zipcar by taking us there and stayed up past her bedtime to offer to drive us back home from that location. 

Like many things in life, it's the little things that matters and Donna got it covered. I won't be staying with anyone else when I'm in Seattle. Thank you Donna!"
3258213,37002299,2015-07-03,22017482,Ashley,I had an incredibly enjoyable stay with Donna. I found that the room and space exceeded my expectations. She even has AC! She is lovely to chat with in addition to being very welcoming and friendly. I would love to stay here again and I am sure I will!

We would definitely recommend on staying at Donna's. "
3258213,37811521,2015-07-10,11969579,Maria,"Whenever I'll be able hosting myself Donna would be my ideal example. Not only that she offers a big room and a comfortable huge bed in a wonderful house close to Lake Washington and a bus which takes you downtown day and night,  but also she's a warm and helpful person who is just delightful to have around and talk to. She gave us a lot of good advices how to make the best out of our short stay in Seattle. We're very very thankful for her great hospitality and hope to manage coming back one day, also to try the kajaks after all. :) 
All the best to you, Donna!

Every morning, we had fresh fruit, cereal and yogurt before beginning our day. Although we were very busy, we finally did get some time to sit and enjoy talking with Donna. She had many good suggestions on what to do in Seattle. The neighborhood was convenient, with a bus stop just down the hill that took us downtown quickly. I would stay here again when in Seattle."
3258213,38629902,2015-07-17,17408790,Ruth,Donna is the nicest and friendliest host we ever had. Our journey through the country started at her home and it was the best decision we made. She gave us so many useful advices for our trip and borrowed us camping staff we forgot to bring with us. Her house is easy to find with car and the bedroom is quiet huge for two persons. Everything was clean and she also had breakfast for us. All in all we enjoyed our stay very much and were so thankful for her hospitality. 
3258213,40125530,2015-07-28,36945551,Donna,"Donna was a dream host! Her home is comfortable and clean, exactly as represented in the photos with gorgeous porch and gardens off the kitchen. From the moment that she greeted me on the porch, Donna made me feel at home. She continued to make my visit fabulous by providing everything that I could need - tea on the porch after a long flight, robe & slippers, lots of information on places to see and suggestions of restaurants to enjoy. Donna was kind and went out of her way to ensure that I was able to get everywhere I wanted to go. The neighbourhood is not in the centre of Seattle but it is close to a nice big park which was great for getting to see the lake and going for walks.  It didn't take long to go downtown when I wanted to explore, and the evenings were nice and quiet when I returned. I highly recommend Donna and her lovely room. I couldn't have wished for a better first Airbnb experience!"
3258213,40733214,2015-08-02,33165456,Jessica,"My boyfriend and I had the most amazing time staying at Donna's.  She is friendly, generous, and gave us amazing restaurant recommendations.  She let us borrow her kayaks, along with her van!  My favorite part of the vacation was kayaking on Lake Washington.  She also instructed us to feel free to anything in her cabinets/fridge.  This was very generous and convenient for us in the mornings.  
    Donna has a gorgeous house surrounded by large trees.  We loved sitting on the large balcony and having coffee/breakfast while bird watching.  The house is near several convenient bus lines and a 20 min walk to the light rail station. If public transit isn't your thing, you can get downtown with an Uber for under $15.
   This was our first airbnb experience but, after staying with Donna, not our last. As gracious as a host as we could have hoped for!"
3258213,41221980,2015-08-05,10200446,Cordelia,Donna was a fantastic host! Her home was cozy and adorable and she was very accommodating and friendly.  She left us plenty of snacks and provided us with plenty of information.  I would definitely stay with her again!

She was always caring me.

3258213,42275998,2015-08-12,35261431,Victoria,"Excellent host and accommodation:)
I don't think you will find many hosts more kind and accommodating than Donna.  The pictures were accurate; the room delightful and the street tree lined.  It felt like a home away from home.  She also has interesting art throughout her lovely home.
She was quite willing to give accurate advice on museums, transportation and secrets of Seattle.
Hope she has room in the future.  Finding her airbnb ad was lucky!  Thanks, Donna for everything!
Victoria"
3258213,43229149,2015-08-18,34277178,Alisa,My fiancé and I thoroughly enjoyed our stay with Donna! She made us feel right at home and was very accommodating. She gave us great food and activity recommendations. The room was clean with a very peaceful view. We were very comfortable staying at Donna's and we would love to stay again if/when we come back to Seattle!
3258213,44115599,2015-08-24,1152862,Deirdre,"We had a very comfortable and relaxing stay at Donna's.  She was away when we arrived, but left us a handwritten note that made us feel welcome.  The room is pleasant and the bed comfortable.  The house is in a quiet residential area just a few blocks from the light rail stop, providing easy access to downtown and the airport.  "
3258213,44973479,2015-08-30,31254247,Tommy,We had a wonderful experience at Donna's place! She lent us her Kayaks and even drove us down to the lake. Highly recommend!
3258213,45397088,2015-09-02,39983028,John,Donna's place was the first time we've tried AirBnB and we enjoyed staying in her peaceful home. The room is pleasant & light & comfortable with everything we needed. We'd definitely recommend this for anyone who likes a homey atmosphere. She exceeded our expectations!
3258213,45855661,2015-09-06,4980617,Claudia,"Donna made us feel very welcome from day one. The room and the neighborhood was exactly as described on the listing. We had nice conversations in the mornings during breakfast, fresh fruits, cereal and coffee :) Donna is a very caring and welcoming person and if we had any questions she would reply very promptly. There is also a nice patio/deck with a nice view. This would be a place I would definitely recommend my friends to stay in the future. Thanks Donna for everything. Hugs :)"
3258213,46229020,2015-09-08,15813575,Manuel,"The place and the host are perfect.

Privacy, freedom, good breakfast, warm welcome, help at any moment needed... I can't say any bad thing about the place or Donna. I'm very grateful for staying at this place. It makes my long weekend trip to Seatlle much more enjoyable.

A big advantage about this place, kayaks, was exactly as Donna explain. We took the van, we did kayaking for a few hours and come back. Being so close to the lake and having a great Van makes everything a great experience. I won't forget.

Thanks Donna."
3258213,46707542,2015-09-13,35637558,Gina,"My boyfriend and I had an absolutely wonderful experience staying at this home. Our host, Donna, made us feel so welcome even though she had to be away for the duration of our stay. From the moment I requested to reserve a date, the communication with Donna had been warm and welcoming. She was so helpful with the planning of our trip! In her messages she also included detailed advice on how to get around by public transit and restaurant recommendations. We also appreciated that she would occasionally check in on us to see how we were doing since she was not there.
When we got there, we pretty much had the whole first floor to ourselves (minus the study). She has family renting out the basement but we never had an encounter with them and they were mostly quiet. The decor was lovely! It felt like home away from home. Donna left us fresh picked plums, which were delicious, and an assortment of goodies laid out in our bedrooms. Maps of Seattle, things to do, and periodicals are provided to aide your trip. She also has a washer and dryer, slippers and bathrobe, Netflix and basic cable, and a backyard patio you could eat your breakfast on. 
The entire home was clean, the bed was comfortable, the neighborhood was quiet, and our overall experience was excellent. Thank you so much for hosting us, Donna! We'll be back :)"
3258213,47254903,2015-09-17,5053141,Ellis,"Once again, we had a great stay for a couple of days.  Besides the 
room (very clean and spacious), the view (windows overlook a
pleasant backyard area), and the comfortable bed, Donna responded
quickly to our e-mail and made us feel welcome when we arrived.
We would definitely stay here again!"
3258213,48276847,2015-09-25,5053141,Ellis,"Once again, we had a great stay.  Donna continues to make

I had a great chat with Donna, shared our thoughts between two different cultures. Donna treat us really well, and even drove us to Boeing Factory when the traffic was bad. "
3258213,49104681,2015-10-01,5053141,Ellis,"Once again, we had a great stay.  Donna continues to make

9494946,56628976,2015-12-15,4766924,Angela,"Really great experience and I would stay again.  I stayed here for one week.  It is a small apartment with a kitchenette and bathroom.  The building is new and very modern, everything felt high quality and it was very clean.  There is a coin operated wash/dryer on each floor with a fully equiped kitchen/lounge w TV/cable.  I think this was the best part because I got to meet other residence/guests - all of whom were absolutely faboulous.  It is located in Capital Hill which is the trendiest part of Seattle.  The apartment is located a few blocks from the nightlife/restaurants/coffee shops.  About a 10-15 minute drive to U of Washington.  There is free wifi - it worked great in the lounge but the signal was weak in the room.  There is street parking.  Also, there is just a curtain that separates the room from the bath area - so if there are two people in the room they should be very friendly.  All in all, great experience and I would stay here again. "
9494946,58033517,2015-12-31,13872005,Andrea,"Checking in was super easy, which was great, but I was surprised at how small the space was, and especially how close the toilet was to the bed.  I read in another review that there was only a curtain separating the bathroom from the bed, which made me a little nervous, but I didn't think it would be right next to the bed.  For my fiancee and I, staying here was too close for comfort - this would probably be okay for someone staying here by themselves.

The space was clean, but I didn't feel like the photos adequately represented the exact dimensions of the room.  The curtains in our room (there weren't any blinds) were sheer, and didn't cover the entire windows, which looked out onto the street.  The bed was comfortable and spacious, but was steps from the toilet, which was separated only by a curtain.  In addition, we were unable to get the wifi working, despite trying two different networks on three different devices.

In summary, this is probably an inappropriate space for a couple due to the lack of personal space between the bed and toilet.  We booked this room because it was inexpensive and we needed a place to stay for only one night, but we stayed at a different location for $85 a night (this space was $70) with a separate bathroom that felt like we were staying in a hotel, in a similar part of town.  "
6796336,44774924,2015-08-29,1262670,Kenrick,It gets the job done at a great price. Roommates are very friendly as well

3038772,14173376,2014-06-13,3192103,Nik,Lisa was a great host.  She was very communicative and her place is as described (cozy and private).   Thank you!
3038772,14308930,2014-06-16,16249387,Karen Faw,"My weekend stay in this Ballard location for my granddaughter's birthday celebration at Webster Park was just what I needed.  The location was very close to dowtown Ballard and the Chittenden Locks. Restaurants, coffee shops, and QFC are all close by.  The neighborhood was relatively quiet. On street parking (close by) was the only
draw back.  My host indicated that she could make an arrangement for parking.
"
3038772,14985340,2014-06-30,16435633,Za,Lisa was a very kind and accommodating host. Her place is very neat and cozy! Your stay will be very comfortable and Lisa will be there to help make your stay an exceptional one! 
3038772,15457780,2014-07-09,9008960,Kara,"Excellent place to stay. Cannot recommend it enough. Cozy, private, accessible, attentive host. She thinks of everything you'd need to know. A very organized, caring person.

The location is excellent. Even though I had to rent a car, I was able to walk everywhere that I wanted to go. All the great things are within walking distance.
She is a really positive person and her dogs are very sweet. The neighborhood as a whole is a very lovely place to be."
3038772,15705722,2014-07-14,17111281,Samantha,I had an amazing stay with Lisa! The room was perfect and very comfortable. There was lots to do just walking distance from the house. I definitely recommend staying with Lisa! 
3038772,15937475,2014-07-18,1312047,Tim,"I thoroughly enjoyed my stay at Lisa's. She was quick to respond, helped me out, and checking in/getting set up was simple and easy. Lisa was working most of the time I was there, but I got to talk with her a couple of times, and she's a lot of fun. If you're looking for a relaxing and quality place to stay in Ballard with easy access to all the great things Ballard has, and without breaking the bank, stay here.

The room is just as pictured and described. It's a small cozy room that's got just about everything you need. It is a smaller room with a small bed (and very comfortable); so, if you're a couple that expects to spend a lot of time in the room, it'd be tight. I found the room (and bed) very comfortable and appreciated the fridge, Keurig coffee machine, and other little things like that. The well-done bathroom is right outside the bedroom door, and there's closet space to keep your suitcases/stuff if you want. It all works well, and Lisa keeps it clean, which is always appreciated. Some hosts don't really clean much or seemingly at all, which is always odd, and a turn off. You can tell Lisa enjoys this and takes pride in doing it well.

Even if when you're at the house/room, you can open the sliding glass door right onto a little covered patio in the fenced-in garden area. It's great to just sit out there and have a coffee, read, etc. Very private, and then you can walk right out and be in the heart of Ballard in a couple of minutes with shops, restaurants, bars/breweries or walk 5+ minutes down to the Chittenden locks. I'd never been--great place to check out, and the salmon ladder may not sound that cool, but it is. And if you want to get in the car, there are a ton of things close by.

I would absolutely come back.

"
3038772,16318554,2014-07-25,11581476,Pamela,"Lisa was a great host. She has thought of everything. There was a coffee maker, plates, cups microwave, refrigerator, comfy bed and lots of pillows. She is in a great location with plenty of shops and restaurants in walking distance. The space was very private on it's own floor. I would definitely recommend her place."
3038772,16491690,2014-07-28,17601499,Jung-Chih,"My son and I enjoyed those 4 days stay with Lisa, this is our first visit to Seattle and those information Lisa provided to us are really helpful during our stay. Very close to Ray's Boat house and Heram Locks which we plan to visit before we left for Seattle! This is a surprise to us within few minutes walk from Lisa's House. Thanks for the kindly hosting! We have a very good summer vacation in Seattle! (By the way, during our visit to Safeco Field, my son got autograph of his favorite Pitcher in the Baltimore Orioles, Chen, who came from Taiwan !)"
3038772,16627204,2014-07-30,17829593,Lou,"This is a great spot to discover the neighborhood of Ballard. Just a few min walk to restaurants, bars and night life. 

Lisa was very kind and willing to give information or answer any questions we had. The space is very small so I would recommend the spot for one, or a couple who doesn't mind being on top of each other. 

The outdoor space is very nice though and provides a good place to relax and enjoy the quietness in the shade.

All around a nice spot.

"
3038772,17163905,2014-08-08,3562714,G. Sanford,Lisa was great and the room was described perfectly. It would be cozy for 2 but was perfect for me. The location is awesome and the parking is ok but can be a bit tight at times. She does offer a designated spot for a bit extra but I was ok on the street. Seattle was great thanks in part to this wonderful little room. Thanks!
3038772,17303149,2014-08-10,7183714,Kevin,"Lisa was a great host and the area around her home is amazing. Tons of shops/bars/coffee within a 1/2 mile. The small, peaceful courtyard is a great place to enjoy a morning cup of the coffee that Lisa provides for the room. Definitely recommend."
3038772,17450703,2014-08-12,17610454,Ruth,"Lisa was a wonderful hostess, providing helpful tips about the neighborhood but also offering great privacy. The room was as described and beautifully done. While small, it is amazing that she could fit in a coffee maker, small fridge and other amenities to make it more convenient without making it crowded. The door to the small backyard is in the bedroom but offers no access to the street. The Ballard neighborhood is a fun place and the room is extremely convenient to restaurants and other activities. We spent a lovely Sunday morning at the Ballard farmer's market, about which Lisa luckily had sent me a text. I would definitely stay here again if I was in Seattle by myself."
3038772,17703810,2014-08-16,2567659,Clayton,"Lisa's place is a cozy little oasis in Seattle. The room has a single bed, a nice chair and table, a coffee pot with tea and coffee, a small fridge and hallway bath room next door. Everything is clean and tastefully decorated best of all is it has a sliding glass door that opens to a quaint flower garden just outside. So pleasant to sit there with my coffee and enjoy the flowers. It is also only a few blocks walk to some pubs, shops, and restaurants. Lisa is happy to show you the way. "
3038772,17947084,2014-08-19,17725077,Christine,Very nice first experience with airb&b. Lisa was an attentive host. Very convenient location in the charming Seattle neighborhood of Ballard. A bit cramped for 2 adults (nice single bed  plus camp cot) but having outdoor access to a little private garden was a treat.
3038772,18133032,2014-08-22,19147902,旻虹,"Lisa is the best  hostess in Seattle! Because of my poor English, I couldn't express what I thought smoothly. Thank you for everything! I hope to see you again someday!"
3038772,18331301,2014-08-25,18342258,Roger,"The room is great and Lisa was very accommodating. She has the room stocked with everything you would need- refrigerator, microwave, coffee maker with coffee pods, bottled water. The outdoor patio is a perfect place to chill out. The location is very conveniently located to shops, restaurants and pubs in Ballard and bus routes to downtown Seattle. Thanks Lisa."
3038772,18567290,2014-08-28,2266051,Karen,"Lisa met me when I arrived to her home and oriented me to the room.  The room was cozy and comfortable.  The room is in a great location in Ballard making it a nice ""base camp"" for excursions to the Locks and the marina.  I enjoyed my time in Ballard and look forward to returning.  Thanks for everything, Lisa."
3038772,18799994,2014-09-01,17775951,Hannah,"Lisa was very welcoming. Her place was private, clean and quiet. I was really impressed with her hospitality. The room had all the amenities I needed to be comfortable for the week."
3038772,19360591,2014-09-11,7839903,Penny,"Thank you, Lisa for a wonderful stay! The room was as described, small but beautifully adequate. The bed was comfortable with nice linens and pillows. I appreciated the private bathroom, mini fridge, and cabinet of basic kitchen items (for snacks, not meal prep) and little garden space outside. I loved the area! Lisa was also kind enough to drive me to my meeting place the morning of my departure so that I didn't need to walk there with my luggage - she also picked up a colleague near by to help her out. Her two little dogs once they spent a few moments with me had only small greetings and farewells from her upstairs space upon my coming and going. Will surely stay there again when back in town. Thanks, Lisa!"
3038772,19488995,2014-09-13,5204020,Anna,"Lisa was out of town when I stayed at her place, but she still managed to be an absolutely amazing host from afar. Before I came, she emailed with me to explain how the public transport system worked, how best to come from the airport and answered any other questions I had. The place was perfect -- pretty much exactly as the listing explained. You can tell she has thought of every little detail, it has just what you need (little fan for at night, dishes if you want to eat food, a nice fridge, comfy pillow!). I fell in love with the neighborhood Ballard, such a cute little enclave of Seattle that is about a 25 minute bus ride from downtown (which is super easy to take!). It is an easy 5 minute walk from her place to the main Ballard drag (Market Street and Ballard) and the same distance from a beautiful park (the Locks). So it's a great location. She does have dogs that bark when you first enter the apartment (they stay upstairs the whole time), but they quiet down soon after you arrive so it's not a problem at all. It's a very quiet place to sleep as well. "
3038772,19795760,2014-09-18,7849816,Joan,"Neighbourhood was great, a lot of places to eat out and a bus stop 2 min away that can get you to downtown in about 25min. The room was small but had everything you would need, coffee maker, fridge, bags...The little patio in the garden is perfect for relaxing after a long day. It was a great experience and peaceful stay at Lisa's house, if I ever come back to Seattle, surely will repeat there!"
3038772,20100099,2014-09-23,4937373,Angela,"This was the perfect Air BnB experience: you feel like you have the entire place to yourself while super friendly and fun Lisa is right upstairs living her fabulous life w her two well-behaved and frisky chihuahuas. I think this home is exactly what Air BnB had in mind when they created this business model. I felt catered to like I was in a 'real' BnB but independent enough like I was in a hotel yet cozy enough that I felt I was staying in a friend's really cushy guest quarters... Lisa's home is also, to boot, in the perfect quiet location right off the main streets of Historic Ballard. What a perfect neighborhood to stay in to get how well people can live in Seattle..."
3038772,20540598,2014-09-30,13008308,Travis,This place was great! Such easy access to the Ballard Locks and just a very quick walk to great bars and restaurants. The set up of the house was great as I could come and go without disturbing Lisa. The fridge and coffee maker were a nice addition for anyone staying longer. 
3038772,20900072,2014-10-07,19196372,Brian,"I had a great time. The room had everything I needed while being away from home. Lisa is a great host, through and through. The location is unbelievably close to best parts of Ballard."
3038772,21305820,2014-10-14,21732310,Beth,"Lisa was the perfect combination: helpful without being intrusive.  I felt very well taken care of, and I highly recommend her as a host. 

The room was small but the space was used very efficiently and was stocked with almost everything a guest might need. And it was wonderful having access to a private bathroom.  The private garden is the perfect place to have your morning coffee. And part of the space is covered, so you can use it even in the rain. "
3038772,21763699,2014-10-23,22342706,Caesar,"Miss understanding where to smoke. Call me after 10:00pm and complaint about my son smoking. Threaten to have my son leave the premises, and would not refund the money. "
3038772,21946518,2014-10-27,10061930,Ancia,"I really enjoyed my stay at Lisa's Cozy Room and Bath. Lisa was a gracious hostess and quick to reply to my emails and questions about the room and neighborhood. Her directions to get into the house were timely and clear. 

The location was great. It was an easy walk to coffee shops and a grocery store with nice deli. The neighborhood felt safe day and night. Parking on the street was tight. It helps to know how to parallel park. But the street itself was quiet, especially at night.

The room and bath were super clean and neat. The big window and sliding glass door brought in light and fresh air. Plus, they both looked out into the enclosed patio so it felt very private. There was a microwave and small fridge, and Lisa provided tea and coffee for the Keurig as well as paper plates and utensils. I found the bed very comfortable. 

Lisa's BnB exceeded my expectations. I'd be happy to stay here again and would recommend this location to anyone looking for a cozy place to stay in Seattle."
3038772,22604013,2014-11-10,1814118,Amy,"Lisa is welcoming and her listing is accurate.  The room is cozy, comfortably decorated, and well supplied with a coffee/tea maker, refrigerator, and microwave. The neighborhood is safe, close to two amazing breakfast spots, a grocery store and fun shops."
3038772,22961283,2014-11-18,23230735,Nick,"First time using airbnb, perfect experience. 

Honestly couldn't have asked for a better time. The place was quiet, clean, safe and comfortable. You'll need to take a bus to get downtown but there is a nice neighborhood just a few blocks away for shops and restaurants. 




"
3038772,23173422,2014-11-24,22824918,Kerry,"Lisa's guestroom was perfect for what I needed for my brief stay. She was gone for the weekend, but everything was set up before I arrived. The room is as pictured; small but perfect for one person and supplied with thoughtful amenities including a small fridge and microwave.

What I liked most about the guestroom was the privacy on the first floor entrance which allowed me to come and go without disturbing Lisa's friend who was watching her dogs. The bed was very comfortable and the private bathroom was a must have for me. 

The parking space was too small and the access too tight for my Audi Allroad and is best suited for a compact car. However, parking on the adjacent street worked well and her location is in easy walking distance to a QFC 24/7 market and a great mix of restaurants.  The small covered patio looked like a nice place to relax and enjoy the fresh air when the weather is warm and sunny. 

Overall, Lisa's guest room  is small but very comfortable and clean, great amenities and fast Wi-Fi, thoughtfully decorated with an artistic flair, very convenient with it's privacy and wonderful, easy walking distance to central Ballard. And it is a great value too!"
3038772,23975125,2014-12-15,23637821,Brian,Lisa made us feel welcome. The check in was easy. The room was comfortable and warm. It is a great area of Ballard to walk around and explore. She is a great host. 
3038772,24093666,2014-12-19,24670097,Charles,"This was my first airbnb experience and it was fantastic. Lisa was super nice, communicative, and accommodating. The room itself was cozy and clean and very comfortable. There were some goodies in there like a keurig coffee maker and some tasty snacks which was a nice surprise. The backyard was a charming and cool place to hang out and accessible from the room via sliding door. The neighborhood was nice and quiet. It was only a short walk to the Ballard locks and an assortment of shops and restaurants and breweries. Overall I felt very welcome here and would definitely recommend it to anyone looking to stay in Ballard."
3038772,24362474,2014-12-27,287926,David,"This location is as close to central Ballard as you could want, with a great supermarket only 2 blocks away. The room is cozy as Lisa advertised; a small space filled with light and greatly enhanced by the covered patio right out the glass sliding door. I rented in the heart of winter-- cold and rainy being Seattle, but I know the patio would become a fantastic ""other room"" in most months.  Lisa was a welcome and gracious host, and was able to quickly reply to any question I had, even when she was at work. Lisa provided everything you needed for the room, making you feel very welcome in her home. Bathroom right next door, with something I appreciate-- a great shower!"
3038772,24550815,2014-12-30,24530127,Kevin,"Lisa was a great host and made our first Airbnb experience a great one. She gave us a lot of privacy when needed and provided anything we needed right away (new dishes, filtered water). The room was very cozy and clean. It was nice to have a private bathroom and have the whole floor to ourselves. The room was too nice we felt like we could live there. The neighbourhood was walkable and had a lot of nice little stores, restaurants and cafes. We would stay here again if we visited Seattle again."
3038772,25332701,2015-01-12,25472711,George,"Lisa was an amazing host, and really made me feel comfortable in her home.  She is also super helpful about any questions regarding the area!  Some of my favorite things about staying with Lisa were the location, fresh fruit and comfortable room."
3038772,26309108,2015-02-09,3298681,Claire,"Lisa is very warm and welcoming. The room is just as pictured, perfect for one, with lots of amenities. The bathroom is lovely, and everything worked great.  Well I didn't use the tv, coffee maker, or microwave. It is just 2 blocks from good food, groceries, the water.  Great Location. The bed was very comfortable, room heater was great. "
3038772,26663999,2015-02-16,27314117,Mollie,"Super comfy bed! I liked that I could keep my room cool by turning down the heat. Lisa was very accommodating and communicative. 
This is a perfect set up for a single person and Lisa has really set things up to make you comfortable. "
3038772,27446031,2015-03-04,27425827,Matt,"Lisa was a fantastic host, even if I didn't get to meet her! Her place is as advertised and provided plenty of privacy and a great location. I would definitely stay here again!"
3038772,27803520,2015-03-12,27744226,Marianne,"
Lisa's room with a garden view was just perfect. The decor was charming.  She provided every possible amenity and total privacy. The location was so convenient to all the restaurants and quirky shops of Ballard."
3038772,28521511,2015-03-25,11429036,Brooke,"Lisa was very friendly and accommodating. The room is small but very comfortable--great bed--and the bathroom is really nice. The best part is the little patio you have all to yourself. You're in a very walkable location--to the Locks, restaurants, the farmer's market, etc. Street parking is a little difficult at night as it is a popular area."
3038772,28683437,2015-03-28,24677628,Marta,"Lisa's communication was great from start to finish. Everything felt clean and fresh - fruit, coffee provided which was a sweet touch. The room is very private which was perfect for me - on it's own floor with private bathroom and patio.  The room itself is pretty small, but totally comfortable for one, especially with the other amenities. I loved sitting out on the patio in the mornings. The Ballard neighborhood is super great! Easy walking to lots of cool restaurants and shops - feels safe. I would stay again! thanks, Lisa."
3038772,28837548,2015-03-30,3608716,Martha,"This place is cozy but perfect for one.  The neighborhood is great, the home is safe and welcoming.  I stayed two very comfortable nights and would be happy to stay here again."
3038772,28986885,2015-04-02,7694017,Kerstin,This was my second stay at Lisa's house! Again: everything's fine... as I already mentioned in my first rating: I highly recommend staying here. Lisa's a great host!
3038772,29548210,2015-04-09,7694017,Kerstin,"I spent a great time in Lisa's cosy room! Everything was perfect... I arrived very late and found the room and bath so very well prepared for me: fresh water, fruits, coffee, milk... Lisa made me feel at home and comfortable! Lisa's house is located close to Ballard (walking distance) and there's a great coffee shop just around the corner. I highly recommend Lisa as a host and will surely come back! "
3038772,30412249,2015-04-21,30075650,Kari,"Lisa was a kind and welcoming host. The room/bathroom was clean and as described with great location just a skip away to the Locks and Ballard Way. I appreciated the refrigerator, apples, steel cut oats, filtered water and coffee in the room."
3038772,30912016,2015-04-28,17720579,Trevor,"Our stay at Lisa's place was great! It's a small room, but it's set up well with all the amenities we needed. The location is not right in downtown, but it is really close to the shops and restaurants in Ballard (which were really cool). Absolutely would recommend :)"
3038772,31453796,2015-05-05,19359866,Keith,"I couldn't have asked for a better host! This was my first time using Airbnb, and Lisa made the whole experience a piece of cake from beginning to end. I was in town for a week of exams and needed a quiet and comfortable place to settle in - cozy it was! Modern renovations, funky/eclectic decor with a charming back porch and garden area. Down to every last detail, my entire experience was A++. Lisa provided the perfect mix of hospitality and privacy. I was pleasantly surprised by her inclusion of organic fruits, oatmeal, and selection of coffee & teas. Perfect for a quick breakfast before running out the door! The room was also equipped with a mini-fridge, coffee maker, microwave, hot pot, filtered water, plates and utensils. Ballard itself is a delightful location, and her proximity couldn't be beat. Right next to everything. Grocery store, bars, restaurants, cafes. Even the main bus line into the city was only a couple blocks away. The next time I make it back to Seattle, this is the place! Thanks for everything Lisa!!!!!!!! =]"
3038772,32009213,2015-05-12,4678869,Errin,Lisa is a very caring and generous host.  She gladly opened her home to my friend who needed a comfortable & quiet place for a week.  Thanks for your hospitality!  :)
3038772,32592520,2015-05-19,32276045,Phillip,"Everything that was written on the listing was accurate.  Lisa made me feel very welcome.  From the fruits that were waiting for me to the shampoos to the private garden.  It was a wonderful stay.  I would definitely recommend staying here.
The neighborhood seemed nice.  I didn't spend to much time walking around but restaurants and coffee shops were only a 5 min walk away."
3038772,33148774,2015-05-25,32618226,Nora,"The room is cozy, perfect for one. It is  whimsically and thoughtfully furnished, from the extra blankets and pillows to the coffeemaker,  and the mini-frig, and the welcome bowl of fruit.

The neighborhood is safe. The location is a few minutes walk from bakeries, restaurants and shops on Ballard's main street. 

Lisa has a folder with instructions for the appliances, and guides to the area. She covers all bases by providing oatmeal for breakfast, filtered water, fresh milk in the mini frig, and even plates and silverware. "
3038772,33477731,2015-05-28,25106357,Damien,"Arrangements for arrival and access were perfect, I just let my self in and made myself at home. Met the host Lisa a little later who talked me through everything, coffee, the fruit she had left for me, access to the garden (which was lovely), the bathroom, where to go. She made me feel super welcome, but then pretty much left me to enjoy my stay and come and go as i pleased - perfect. Great room, great host, great neighbourhood, if you are going to Seattle, stay here!"
3038772,34222609,2015-06-06,7448809,Kirk,"Lisa was very helpful and thought of everything. The room was comfortable and opened up to a beautiful garden. The location was great, just a couple minutes from everything in Ballard. I'll definitely look to stay here again on future trips to Seattle."
3038772,34663063,2015-06-10,3783564,Adrienne,"Amazing place! Amazing value! Very beautiful room surrounded by greenery. When I came I was greeted by blueberries, apples, and a wonderful coffee maker with coffee, cream, and sugar. She is a very kind and thoughtful host, who has carefully attended to every detail."
3038772,34883064,2015-06-13,33693341,Kyle,"Lisa was a generous host.  She provided us with cold water and fresh fruit upon our arrival.  Our room was quiet, clean and had direct access a patio/garden area.  Ballard is a great neighborhood with many excellent places to eat/drink only a few minutes away when walking."
3038772,36882427,2015-07-02,3802668,Mark,"Lisa's home was just as advertised. Nice comfy bed, room with TV etc. the fruit and coffee/oatmeal was a nice touch."
3038772,37190285,2015-07-05,1215856,Felix,"The room is perfect for anyone wanting a low-key, convenient, well-located place to say, especially if you're traveling alone.  Lisa does a great job making you feel welcome!  Overall a great value!"
3038772,38383798,2015-07-15,21572366,Linda,"Lisa has created a special, wonderfully warm, comfortable space. The room, the patio, the garden, the private bathroom will make any guest comfortable. I stayed for 10 days and each day was a vacation. She has thought of everything. I will definitely stay again on my next Seattle trip. Thank you Lisa"
3038772,39195056,2015-07-21,36471679,Will,"Lisa was an excellent host, her location and accommodations we perfect. Next time in Seattle this will be the first place I hope to stay."
3038772,40682901,2015-08-01,13281839,Jeffery,Lisa place was amazing. It felt very private. Basically the whole downstairs is yours plus the garden is unoccupied. We stayed 2 people and did not feel cramped. I live in Seattle and I will make this gem a personal getaway in the future. Highly recommend. Thanks Lisa! 
3038772,41388697,2015-08-07,7448809,Kirk,This is the second time I've stayed at Lisa's place. I really like Lisa's attention to detail. Everything I could possibly need is there. It is nice being just a few minutes from Ballard so I can catch buses or grab dinner.
3038772,41992247,2015-08-10,19527457,Kyle,"This was the ideal room for me. It had everything I needed to jump start my Seattle vacation, and everything was waiting when I arrived. The house is situated in a very walkable neighborhood and it was very easy to get around the area. Thanks Lisa!"
3038772,42726521,2015-08-15,20213101,Andrew,"Lisa was just as hospitable, welcoming, and accommodating as all her reviews describe her. Her home is close enough to everything Ballard has to offer without being so close you encounter the crowd (or hear them). "
3038772,43617157,2015-08-21,3608716,Martha,This is a small but cozy and lovely place to stay.  We have booked this property more than once and are very happy with it. The location in Ballard is excellent.  Lisa is a great host with great communication. 
3038772,44336213,2015-08-25,8617527,Chris,"Lisa's place was great and exactly as described. The absolute best part about her place is the location. The Neighborhood of Ballard is an exceptional place to be. Cafe's, restaurants, and a place to grab a drink are all a short walk away (there's even some live music venues).I would recommend Lisa's place to anyone visiting Seattle! "
3038772,44714083,2015-08-28,41877139,Lou,"Lisa's place was perfect for my stay in Ballard. It's in a great, convenient location and very comfortable. Lisa takes good care of you, and I would definitely stay there again."
3038772,44962073,2015-08-30,3406728,Brian,"Lisa's place was clean, comfortable, quiet, and in a perfect location! Lisa made us feel VERY welcome and we loved all the extra amenities that came with the place (coffee, oatmeal, orange juice, etc). We plan on staying here again!"
3038772,45295834,2015-09-01,20671007,Sara,"Everything about Lisa's place was perfect. It was extremely clean, exactly like the listing, she left fruit for me and had water and coffee, plenty of extra blankets, a great bathroom and a keypad to enter the room so I could come and go as I pleased - whenever. She was also lovely in person and so accommodating and quick and clear in communication. I felt comfortable and slept like I was at home. Ballard is the best neighborhood in Seattle (I am from NYC!) and this place is literally steps from so many awesome places. It was just me staying there, and I could not have asked for a better situation. I will stay here whenever in Seattle! "
3038772,45715236,2015-09-05,6628468,David,"I had a very comfortable stay at Lisa's apartment.  Communication was excellent and her place was easy to find.  Well located in Ballard close some outstanding restaurants.  The apartment is not large but had everything I needed.  
Thank you Lisa!"
3038772,46182219,2015-09-08,40512854,Martha,Lisa was a fine host. I had a very rocky start coming in late; I was unable to find her location.  Parking in Ballard is VERY challenging; kindly she offered me a space behind her place which made coming and going much easier. The suite of rooms was small but well appointed.  Lisa was helpful and friendly. 
3038772,46954913,2015-09-14,710320,Samantha,"My friend & I stayed here for a long weekend to celebrate a wedding in Seattle. Lisa was very easy to communicate with before check in & checked on us the day we arrived. In the room she provided fruit, cold water, & teas- nice touch :-) The room was clean & had a small fridge. It was a little on the small side for 2 people (even a couple because the bed only fits one). Lisa did bring a cot in that we used at night & folded up during the day.
If you are a light sleeper I recommend bringing ear plugs as the host gets up early for work & the pups do occasionally bark.
Overall we had a very pleasant stay & walked or took bus/Uber everywhere. Nice neighborhood.
"
3038772,47771662,2015-09-21,19908894,Jonathan,Unfortunately we didn't get to meet Lisa but Dyana was very helpful. The room was great. The mini fridge was ideal for the short stay. Central Ballard location. Overall a great experience. I would stay here again in a minute!
3038772,48748617,2015-09-28,21146282,Robert,"Lisa's place is an absolutely perfect place to stay! You can walk to coffee shops, breakfast, and the very beautiful Ballard Locks! Her nice room is set up so well and the outside garden space is so wonderful to sit in. I can't recommend this high enough."
3038772,49494150,2015-10-04,39046730,Kathleen,"Lisa was accommodating as I spent time decompressing from my daughter's difficult child birth. Privacy' quiet and comfort were what I needed and I also enjoyed the patio garden. One of the perks was being a block off Market for coffee and sandwich runs, close to QFC for groceries for the new family and the Aveda store for a few impromptu gifts. I enjoyed my stay and recommend Lisa's retreat, especially for single travelers. 
"
3038772,51902493,2015-10-25,2566755,Jp,"Lisa was a wonderful host.  She was very accommodating to our family and our needs as my mom visited her granddaughter.
The room had everything you need for a cozy stay."
3038772,52593684,2015-10-31,7448809,Kirk,This is the 3rd or 4th time staying at Lisa's place. I always enjoy my stay.
3038772,53289609,2015-11-07,8358397,Jasper,"Staying at Lisa's place was great! She's super accommodating, nice, and was fun to talk with. The location was great too- fresh fruit, mini fridge, filtered water, OJ, and keurig machine! Thanks Lisa!"
3038772,53755930,2015-11-12,2609001,Mary,"I rented this room for my sister while she was visiting from out of town. I just saw it briefly, but it looked very clean and comfortable, with many nice touches and amenities. My sister said she had a great stay and really appreciated the fresh fruit and orange juice that Lisa provided. I will definitely recommend this location to friends and family in the future!"
3038772,54198212,2015-11-16,48484200,Jack,"Fantastic location, and a lovely spot.  Lisa was a gracious host and truly cared about my stay.  I would not hesitate to stay there again and I am sure that you'll enjoy your stay.
"
3038772,54319736,2015-11-18,14063039,Kristin,"Lisa was very welcoming.  She provided a coffee pot, microwave and fridge even.  Orange juice, fresh fruit, coffee, instant oatmeal, dishes etc.  All was included.  I got in late and left early both mornings I was there, so appreciated breakfast in the room.  
The room in small as she states, but if the weather was nice, one could open the sliding glass door to a nice covered patio seating area.
Lisa printed out directions for me to take the bus and light rail to the airport for an early departure.
One could walk to the Fish Locks and downtown Ballard from here."
3038772,54549668,2015-11-21,10457156,Todd,Cozy room in an excellent location. Lisa exceeded expectations and went out of her way to accommodate us.
3038772,54822549,2015-11-23,10457156,Todd,"Lisa was an excellent host, and went out of her way to accomodate us. The room was separated from the rest of the house so you could come and go without trodding through the rest of her living area. 
There was an issue with the toilet when we were there, which she promptly fixed and even gave us a partial refund which was not necessary. When we were there she also had some light breakfast items on the desk and drinks in the mini fridge. Would definitely stay with her again, highly recommended. "
3038772,55236211,2015-11-29,11931867,(email hidden),"Even though Lisa was out of town, everything about my arrival was well taken care of....and it was Thanksgiving! The location is great, although parking can be a bit of a challenge.
Lisa has created a lovely, whimsical space for guests. It is very clean and well thought out. Snacks, fruit, coffee, orange juice in the fridge....and cute little chalkboard notes around to help you find anything you need!
We had an issue with the heat, and Lisa went well above what would be expected to make things right."
3038772,55719368,2015-12-05,7448809,Kirk,I always love staying at Lisa's place. It is super comfortable and close to Ballard and Lisa always thinks of everything and is a very generous host.
3038772,56501065,2015-12-14,31161654,Tova,"Lisa's place was very comfortable, and she's thought of all the amenities that you might want!  The location was perfect for exploring the Ballard area, easy walking to the locks, to the Nordic Heritage Museum, and to all cafes and restaurants.  The patio would be great in better weather (i.e. Not December)."
3038772,58207396,2016-01-01,14638343,Linda,"Lisa was an absolute sweetheart, checking in with me regularly to make sure I had everything I needed. 

Her place is cozy and bright. Everything was clean and well thought out. Lisa has clear instructions and notes everywhere to really make you feel at home. Little touches like a pitcher of filtered water in the fridge and extra blankets in a basket near the bed really made it a nice experience. 

The house is centrally located, and I was able to walk to tons of great restaurants, coffee shops, and shopping on Ballard Ave. 

I would highly recommend this spot for a visit to the lovely city of Seattle. "
7247518,38785054,2015-07-18,7902103,Michael,"Angie was an absolute dream. A wonderful host and a warm, welcoming person all around. Her home was just that, it felt like home. Very cute. Nicely decorated, and clean, it made us feel like we actually lived there for the time we stayed. It was easy to Uber in and out of downtown from the place and was in a super nice, safe, quite neighborhood. I would certainly recommend this place to anyone who is looking for an affordable and spacious place to stay during a trip to Seattle. It was a big part of me falling in love with the city! I'll be back soon! 
Thanks Angie "
7247518,40513721,2015-07-31,39085491,Christopher,Great place and very comfy. A little further than I initially wanted to be from downtown but it was perfect.
7247518,42164527,2015-08-11,27025422,Lloyd,"Angie's place was beautiful, spacious and very homey. Had to go to Seattle for an interview and really enjoyed staying here. Close to the city and a very quite and friendly neighborhood. I will definitely be back again :)"
7247518,46420463,2015-09-10,4363221,Gary,"The house was excellent.  Exactly as described.  The livingroom and bedroom were large and very comfortable.  The house is in a nice neighborhood and a quick drive to downtown (on the weekend.  I did not try during a workday.)  Few minor inconveniences for me: noisy refrigerator, shower head is for small people.  Overall, excellent.  I would stay here again."
8645226,49952834,2015-10-07,39804945,Anna,"Ronda is a wonderful and heartly host. She replied within minutes to our request when we were desperately looking for a place to stay. We felt very comfortable and enjoyed our stay very much, and recommend Ronda's place to everyone looking for a clean and quiet and safe location with easy accesse to public transport to downtown Seattle. We would definitly stay there again."
8645226,50255260,2015-10-10,45169353,Jeffery,I recommend Ronda. Her place is great. Nice location and nice host.
8645226,50715177,2015-10-13,21457215,HanMee,I had a wonderful stay with Ronda. She is such a warm and welcoming hostess and made sure that I had everything I needed. It was a plus to get to spend some time with her beautiful family and pets!
8645226,51643649,2015-10-22,30237596,DeRay,"    Ronda was waiting for me though I had to check in quite late. She introduced me to her dog and cat and gave me hints on how things worked in the house, bedroom and bathroom. The bedroom is smallish yet the accommodation quality and location was great for me, especially given the attractive rental rate and flexible cancellation policy. And, she invited me to freely utilize the living room. Though Ronda is quite new as an Airbnb host, she is getting the hang of it rapidly and made herself always available in person or via text and cell phone.
    Neighborhood is sweet and a short walking distance to stores, restaurants and bus stops. I twice in the morning walked to an excellent bakery/coffeeshop then on to a bus stop to hook up with my family on Alki Ave.
    "
8645226,52434594,2015-10-29,20728859,Beth,"Rhonda is a friendly, accommodating hostess eager to ensure I had a great visit. The property was described accurately, comfortable, and located just off the main street where several great local restaurants could easily be found.  It was also just across the bridge from downtown Seattle-making it easy to get in and out of the city."
8645226,52862219,2015-11-02,10781861,Jon,Staying in West Seattle with Rhonda was such a great experience.  She made our stay warm and welcoming (as her description states) and I would love to go back to stay another time.  
8645226,53231498,2015-11-06,42385080,Keith,Great stay and amazing hospitality. Perfect location with many options for food. 
8645226,53430815,2015-11-08,10338504,Julie,I really enjoyed meeting Ronda! She was very accommodating and her place is nice. The bed is super comfy!! 
8645226,53586573,2015-11-09,48408713,Roddey,"AWESOME host. I was only there one night, but Ronda helped me feel at home. Great accomodations and a great neighborhood to be in. I hadn't explored West Seattle, but there were plenty of restaurants and bars within walking distance. HIGHLY recommend this place. Thanks again, Ronda!!!"
8645226,53730982,2015-11-11,7756430,Alexander,"Ronda was an amazing hostess. She was kind, caring, accommodating and compassionate.  I had the misfortune of fracturing my tibia while in Seattle and she went above and beyond to take care of me when I got out of the hospital.  Although her sole responsibility was to host me, Ronda proved to be a godsend in a time of need.  I recommend her to anybody!!!"
8645226,54762806,2015-11-23,44787057,Wenbo,"Ronda is very welcoming and  enthusiastic, and the room is so nice and comfortable.
So I recommend Ronda highly."
7768727,44373889,2015-08-25,41734182,Jose,"I really enjoyed my stay with Brant. Brant gave me plenty of privacy and was very accommodating. I had to share a bathroom with another tenant, but this was not an issue at all. 

The location was better than I expected, it's a quick walk from plenty of local bars and restaurants and only a $5 Uber ride to major tourist attractions. 

The room itself was very nice and comfortable with plenty of privacy. I'd definitely stay with Brant again if I visited Seattle in the future."
7768727,46013930,2015-09-07,29415232,Jian,"Brant was such a hospitable host. He went above and beyond to provide all the information we need to tour the city. The room was very clean and well decorated. There is a roof top balcony in his house, which is really cool. Also, the house locates at the heart of Downtown Seattle. It's really convenient and safe to walk everywhere. I would definitely recommend his place to anyone. It was a really great experience staying at his place. Can't wait to visit Seattle again. "
7768727,47855446,2015-09-21,4260768,Dave,"Brant's location is just perfect! It's even better than advertised. IT's located in Capitol Hill. It's by far the coolest place in Seattle filled with pubs, restaurants, coffee shops and art galleries. It's truly a gem of listing. Brant was very welcoming and gave us great recommendations in the area. I know that he will be a super host very soon. The room is spacious and the bed is perfect. It has DirecTV with many premium channels if that's your thing. The bathroom is new. Eventhough you have to share with another Airbnb room, it's not a problem at all. I highly recommend this place. It's truly a 5 stars listing."
7768727,48362523,2015-09-25,13742321,Charlotte,"We had a very nice stay. The room was lovely and the bed really comfortable.

"
7768727,48613119,2015-09-27,6458406,Miranda,"Great stay! My first Airbnb experience, and now I'm hooked. Brant responded immediately to my questions. Check in and out was easy. The room was very clean and comfy, and it was great to have a private entrance. The neighborhood is wonderful with plenty of places to eat and get coffee within two or 3 blocks. I would stay again for sure!"
7768727,49547457,2015-10-04,1591360,Katharina,"Me and my friend stayed two nights at Brant's place and the ""Perfect Escape in Heart of Seattle"" was my best airbnb-experience so far! 
We really loved the house....it is comfortable, modern, and beautifully decorated. The location is great to explore the city - and close to his place is a highly recommended ""skillet diner"" where we enjoyed our breakfast. 
Brant couldn't be more welcoming!! He was very helpful and very flexible with our check-out time. 
If we visit Seattle again, his place would definitely be our first choice! Thanks again, Brant!"
7768727,50036183,2015-10-08,26931950,Kimi,This location is perfect for anyone who wants to be in the heart of Capitol Hill but stay on a quiet street. The accommodations were even better than advertised. Brant was a perfect host. I hope to stay here every time i'm in the area.
7768727,51230137,2015-10-18,40670678,Angelika,Brant ist ein angenehmer Gastgeber. Die Unterkunft bei Brant war sehr nett. Sie ist im Untergeschoß und damit ist es etwas finster aber das hat mich nicht gestört. Die Schlüsselübergabe war total unproblematisch und ich konnte sofort ins Zimmer. Das Bad wird mit einem anderen Airbnb Gast geteilt. Alles sauber. 
7768727,52158072,2015-10-26,46734972,Chelsea,"Brant's home was modern,clean and quiet. The neighborhood is in the perfect location to find great food, bars and other fun Seattle activities. Proximity to the different bus stops was also a great benefit! The listing is also very private, with a separate outdoor entrance into the unit. Brant was welcoming, helpful and very informative about what to do in Seattle. We would definitely recommend he and his listing to other people! Thank you!"
7768727,53124047,2015-11-05,45869567,Ryan,"The listing description was very accurate. The room was very well cared for when I arrived. Brant was great at helping me with any questions I had.

7768727,53414110,2015-11-08,10296320,Manuel,Awesome host!! Great place with a great location near many attractions. He even let us keep our bags in the room after check out! Highly recommend!
7768727,54274539,2015-11-17,35497234,Adrian,"Brant was a fantastic host and this Airbnb was exactly what we needed. Located only minutes away from nightlife and restaurants, walking to get around was never out of the question. The place itself was very comfy and cozy and the private entrance was nice. Brant was very helpful with tips in regards to places to go out in Seattle. I would definitely recommend staying here and if ever I'm back in Seattle, this Airbnb would be my first choice.  "
7768727,54619675,2015-11-22,47725130,Lorenzo,"I had an absolutely amazing time here, it's a really nice building that's right by everything in Seattle and brant helped me with everything from check in to check out! Would stay here again in a heartbeat. "
7768727,55246483,2015-11-29,24947470,Pranab,"Good place, good location, good host!"
7768727,57048840,2015-12-21,49588131,Sohee,"This place is the best to stay in Seattle. Very quite and good location to walk for main attractions! Also, Brant was very nice host. He helped me and my friends check-in and gave us a big welcome!! Room is very cozy, convenient, quiet. I strongly recommend this place. "
7768727,57615822,2015-12-27,27457295,Björn,I can highly recommend to stay with Brant. His room is very new and clean. You have your own entrance. The bed is so comfortable and WiFi works perfect! It's located very well to go out in Capitol hill. Thanks again Brant!
7434103,39864276,2015-07-26,32019829,Whitney,"This was a charming home, and Heather was an easy host. Her description is spot on. It is truly a mid-twentieth-century home, as represented, fixtures dated, but overall immaculate. It is even more charming than the pictures, serene, with many personal touches. I walked in the neighborhood, very pleasant, with a long stairway down to the trail that borders Lake Washington. Bed was very comfortable. The room is around the corner of the house from her sleeping quarters, so while you are sharing a home, it is pretty private. 

Heather left a lovely breakfast of homemade yogurt and granola and coffee/tea/fruit and other choices. Nice departure from the sterility of a hotel. Thank you, Heather!"
7434103,41844940,2015-08-09,6548990,Jesse,"Heather's place is great! Lots of space, nicely decorated, and above all, quiet. There is a good bed, a desk, and a big private bathroom. Best of all are the little touches, like a bottle of water waiting for me, which really helped me feel at home.

I only got to speak to Heather for a little bit, but it was enjoyable and she's good company. For the most part I was out and about during my stay, so I can't say too much about her. But I would definitely stay here again!

Outside the house there is plenty of free parking. The house is on a side-street, so there's almost no traffic or noise. "
7434103,42102363,2015-08-10,39732996,Naomi,Heather was very quick at responding and tremendously welcoming! Her house was clean and decorated so cutely. She welcomed us sweetly as it was our honeymoon and the room was perfect for us. The description and neighborhood were great! She's a fun host with a very sweet personality! 
7434103,42955743,2015-08-16,18198148,Sharlene,Our stay at Heather's house was lovely.  The room was wonderful with a very comfortable bed and adjoining bath.  It worked out perfect for our three day stay in Seattle.  The accommodations were clean and nicely decorated.  I would definitely stay there again!
7434103,44039968,2015-08-23,5283732,Thor,"The hostess was really nice and went out her way to make things comfortable for us.  The neighborhood is fine.  On the whole, it was clean and comfortable and easy to get around."
5126077,50053385,2015-10-08,4876590,Jiyoun,Brittain is very nice and kind. The place is very good to go to downtown. Also it was very cozy and neat.
9364220,56729378,2015-12-17,9541167,Lauren,Great stay! Conveniently close to transportation hub. Host was very accommodating and flexible. 
7021544,40050692,2015-07-27,515673,Salvador And Marguerite,"We had a very nice two night stay in Christine's apartment. The bed was very comfortable and the shower was great! It was obvious that care went into making sure the apartment was clean, nicely furnished, and stocked with everything needed for our stay there.  We would definitely stay again!"
7021544,40394164,2015-07-30,24112146,Patrick,Good location-- easy access to different Seattle spots.  Apartment was clean and nicely furnished.  Host provided easy to follow instructions.  Comfortable bed
7021544,41506340,2015-08-07,4184889,Joseph,Nice apartment in a convenient location. Slight smoky smell.
7021544,41671363,2015-08-08,39393027,Elyse,"Christine was very nice, well-prepared and always responded messages instantly,  sending us information regarding our stay long before we arrive. The apartment deco was just adorable! We enjoyed staying there."
7021544,42187186,2015-08-11,28833027,Mengyao,"We didn't get to meet Christine, but she was very welcoming and helpful in providing check-in information and neighborhood recommendations. It's not a central location but easy to get around. It would be great if there was AC since it gets hot in summer nights. "
7021544,42464283,2015-08-13,38305973,Matt,Our experience staying at Christine's place was great! My wife and I stayed here on a two day trip to Seattle for the first time. Her apartment is centrally located in one of the best neighborhoods in town. The week we were there it was unusually hot for Seattle and with no A/c the place got a little stuffy. Other than that no complaints. Highly recommend 
7021544,43216972,2015-08-18,26030561,Cecilia,The host canceled this reservation the day before arrival. This is an automated posting.
7021544,43983045,2015-08-23,39554387,Hu,The room is very comfortable when I waked up for an instance I thought I was home. I will live here next time definitely.
7021544,44693265,2015-08-28,40426471,Neil,"Apartment is just as described, good location close to Queen Anne. Fun décor with lots of eastern-bloc tchotchkes. Super easy communication and check in/checkout. Bedroom is quiet despite being on a busy street."
7021544,45741988,2015-09-05,33646857,Brian,"The apartment worked out perfectly for my girlfriend and myself. The bed was super-comfortable, the two flat screen TVs provided plenty of entertainment and I could use my Netflix or Amazon account for movies in addition to regular programming. The kitchen was very well equipped and A hair dryer was even provided in the bathroom. It was a lot of fun to be able to walk down the street behind the building, then down a flight of stairs directly to Lake Union where there are lots of activities including boat rentals, a floatplane base and a major museum. The bus stop right on Dexter Avenue provides transportation directly into the heart of the city, which is only a few miles away. The dedicated parking spot was very convenient but street parking is not too difficult, and there are no meters, as there is in much of Seattle!"
7021544,46176855,2015-09-08,18936867,Orion,Apartment was comfortable and cozy. It was well represented in the description and photographs. Well located. Would stay again.
7021544,46632776,2015-09-12,3212505,Cindy,"The Hosts: Christine and Steve were excellent hosts! They were quick to respond to messages and did everything they could to ensure we were satisfied with our experience. 

The Apartment: So cute! The decor made the place feel cozy and special. It was also very clean. It was a very comfortable size for the two of us. The water pressure in the shower was amazing!

The Neighborhood: We couldn't have picked a better neighborhood! We were in walking distance of Fremont (home of fun stuff like the Theo Chocolate factory and the Fremont Troll) and fun shops and restaurants in Queen Anne. We loved being able to pop on the bus (stop right across the street) and be downtown in 5 minutes. 

Overall, we had a great experience and would definitely stay here again!

7021544,48730335,2015-09-28,40123017,Michelle,"Christine and her husband are great hosts. They were extremely friendly and communicative. There was an issue with the apartment a few weeks before our arrival, and they were in touch with us then to let us know what was going on, what our options were, and what they were doing to resolve the issue, which was taken care of before our arrival. They are great hosts! The apartment is very cute inside and the bed is quite comfortable. There is a mild musty odor, as if a previous occupant was a smoker, but it wasn't strong. So unless you're very sensitive to scents, it shouldn't be a problem.  All in all, Christine was a great host and this is a fantastic deal for the area!"
7021544,50712918,2015-10-13,26123227,Kevin,"Steve and Christine were extremely responsive, and made the booking process extremely easy. Ran into Steve on one of the days and he was able to give our group some awesome food recs. 

The apartment was clean and the futon and bed were both comfy. Short walk to Fremont and a quick uber to pretty much anything else. The location and hosts made our trip a success!"
7021544,51240501,2015-10-18,19759053,Scott,"The apartment was exactly as the pictures described. Aside from a slight cigarette smell, the apartment was clean and organized. The location is very well located and the neighborhood is safe. Christine was very up front with some temporary issues with the apartment which was much appreciated. "
7021544,52418471,2015-10-29,12487086,Francis,"Christine was an amazing host and made our first trip to Seattle extremely comfortable and welcoming. Being new to the city from Australia, we had several questions about getting around and how to get the most from our stay, and Christine always replied promptly with helpful suggestions. We had a lovely stay, it was perfect for us, and we would recommend this place to anyone looking for somewhere convenient with easy access to the city and other beautiful surrounding suburbs. Thank you, Christine!"
7021544,55029159,2015-11-27,9936818,Sushant,"Before we arrived, we were constantly in touch with Steve, Christine's husband, who is very helpful and even picked us up from the airport. The house was very clean and well set-up when we arrived. Everything was available. We have faced no problem, during our stay here. This is our first trip to US and Steve has been very helpful to point out the right places to visit and many a times has even taken us with him.

About the house, one thing I really liked is that it is decorated with artifacts belonging to the Soviet era. The house is spacious and has enough room for 4 people. 

Our initial plan was to stay here for 2 weeks and then move to another place, but we like it so much, that we are now staying here for the whole trip. "
6759038,35041579,2015-06-14,8489487,Harrie,"James, my Airbnb host, was very courteous and friendly. He was generous in providing privacy, respect and friendliness while I stayed with him. The room and bathroom were very clean, private and comfortable.  The bed was very comfortable and restful.  The neighborhood felt safe, relaxed, and  walking distance to Ballard amenities of eating and drinking.  I would return to James room and recommend it to anyone interested. 
  "
6759038,35530131,2015-06-19,454469,Emily,"James is very friendly and accommodating. The room was cozy but with plenty of space. It's close to the train which seemed to stop between midnight and 7am or 8am. Location is fantastic! Ballard central neighborhood is lively, but he lives down a quiet street. I'd definitely recommend James, and stay there again."
6759038,35601395,2015-06-20,35433373,Bob,"We felt vary welcome, and found James to be a great host"
6759038,35746471,2015-06-21,1319017,Pj,Great little room and wonderful host. No complaints and very easy process!
6759038,36645642,2015-06-29,11188510,John,Fantastic home in great location.  James is a superb host.  We wish we had more time to hang out there. Enjoyed our conversations.  Very comfortable and would love to stay again.  Five Stars.
6759038,39983884,2015-07-27,6310825,Richard,"Like staying with a friend of a friend. James made us feel very welcome, gave us lots of useful tips on what to do, and is fascinating to talk with. The room is clean and comfortable, and Ballard is an interesting and convenient neighborhood. Highly recommended!"
6759038,40507896,2015-07-31,14487738,Jane,"I had a great week! James was wonderful to talk with, very welcoming, and shared lots of local knowledge about good restaurants and history of the neighborhood. There are dozens of amazing places to eat and shop in Ballard, you will never be bored or hungry, including lots of awesome happy hours. I walked everywhere during my stay and had no trouble taking public transportation to and from the airport. Proximity to locks was a big highlight for me.

The room was clean and comfortable. I especially liked the soft sheets, big fluffy towels, and strong morning coffee. Thank you James for sharing your home. :)"
6759038,41154856,2015-08-04,38946421,Artur,My first airbnb experience and it couldn't have been better. James is a great host and has a great little place in a fantastic neighborhood (15 min by car/25min by bus from downtown Seattle). Very convenient.
6759038,41792625,2015-08-09,37189733,Cristina,"James was a great host. We felt extremely comfortable and safe not only in Ballard but also in his home. We came and went as we pleased and James was always available if we had questions, needed suggestions, or just wanted to chat. The location is just west of all the shops, restaurants, and bars in Ballard and everything was within walking distance for us. If you don't need all the amenities that hotels offer and you want to explore a quieter but hip neighborhood then this is a great place. I will definitely be reaching out to James next time I travel to Seattle. "
6759038,42471449,2015-08-13,35820120,Miles,"James was a gracious host. He was very prompt to respond to any messages. Additionally, he was flexible regarding a late check in, early check out, and even a change of guest. The place itself was as described. Since I needed a place in Ballard on short notice, this was a great find to suit my needs. There was no availability at the nearby hotels and this booking prevented me from needing to rent a car during my trip to Seattle. Location is very walkable with Hiram Chittenden Locks, shops, and restaurants all nearby. I would recommend this place and would stay there again."
6759038,42752243,2015-08-15,18886471,Kevin,"James was very communicative, flexible, and considerate. He did a great job of making me feel welcome, plus his dog is adorable. The place is in a great location, just a short walk to a number of cute Ballard bars and shops."
6759038,43010729,2015-08-16,6205328,Eric,"James was easy going and made us feel right at home. Place was clean, almost like a hotel room in the room. Great walking access to Ballard nightlife and the locks."

6759038,45590530,2015-09-04,22592856,Pamela,"James was super prompt responding to my request.  His location is the Ballard neighborhood of Seattle is really great, walking distance to the Locks, Golden Gardens and the shopping area.  James' home is a charming duplex.  Unfortunately, this is a smoking household.  My husband has asthma and it was a problem for us.  "
6759038,45916290,2015-09-06,5115005,Maaike,"We stayed one night at James place. He made us feel very welcome, even invited us for a wine and gave us a tour around the amazing house he is building. James is a great guy and the room is at a perfect spot!"
6759038,46853677,2015-09-13,291524,Diana,"James made us feel at home immediately! I cannot recommend his place enough. Whether hanging out at the locks, sampling the nearby cuisine or traveling into the city center, James house is perfectly positioned for all types of fun. James local knowledge was indeed a welcome fringe benefit. We only wish we could have stayed at his place for longer than we were able."
6759038,48646857,2015-09-27,38565332,Janet,"Well, I have to agree with all the other positive posts about James' place - cute house, perfect location in Ballard, and courteous host. The room was just what I needed, and the bed divine. As one other reviewer said, it was like staying with the friend of a friend. Comfortable and casual. Quiet neighborhood within blocks of many great restaurants and little shops. Looking forward to booking again."
6759038,49282936,2015-10-02,35348210,Allie,We stayed in Ballard for one night and really enjoyed our experience. James was a fabulous host and made us feel at home. The house is in a perfect location - walking distance to everything we wanted to see. We would definitely recommend this listing to anyone visiting the area. 
1538865,7725625,2013-09-30,3317689,Ini,"A comfortable, reasonable priced place in a nice neighbourhood close to Alki beach. On our walk down to the beach we even passed through a forest that seemed almost like a wilderness in the heart of the city...:) Because Christine was out of town we received the keys from her sister, who was very easy to get in touch with and helpful. The house itself was very cosy and perfect for a long weekend."
1538865,8997985,2013-12-01,7434255,Jan,"The house was very comfortable and in a good location.  It's convenient when visiting stores, restuarants,the beach, and downtown Seattle.  Christine was helpful and an easy person to communicate with when working out any details.  "
1538865,9449849,2013-12-29,9454061,Stuart,"This was my first time using an airbnb and I can only hope the next time is anywhere near this good. We never met, but Christine gave me and my brother a generous welcome and all the information we needed to make sure we could take good care of her inviting home. The house itself was cozy, neat and full of interesting art; all we could want in the way of comfort - beds, towels, etc. very nicely provided. Mittens the cat is - paws down! - the lovingest cat I've ever met. The house is nicely situated for ease of access to the rest of West Seattle and from there the whole region. And all this for an incredibly generous fee. I have three hundred and seventy words left, but will only use one more: wonderful. 
 "
1538865,10485057,2014-02-21,597345,Kristina,"Fantastic neighborhood with a lot to do.  Downtown Seattle is a 10-15 minute drive or you can take the buses a few blocks away.  The walk to the beach through the forest was fun for all.
Christine was a great host who communicated regularly.  The house was comfortable with all amenities needed.  We loved the fenced in backyard for our kids.  If you have a baby bring a pack and play and be ready to baby proof (put nice things away) upon arrival.  Our 16 month old made us nervous with Christine's valuable art pieces etc. from around the world.  Overall a fantastic experience and we would definitely revisit.  "
1538865,13104128,2014-05-19,832143,Ken,This is a comfortable 2/1 in West Seattle in walking distance of California and Admiral.  It suited my needs perfectly.   Christine was quick and efficient with communication.  The cat was totally chill and social.
1538865,13428002,2014-05-27,11524874,Marilyn,The house was comfortable and welcoming -- perfect for two friends visiting Seattle for a holiday weekend.  We felt right at home.  The house was close to several great grocery stores and  Bakery Nouveau.  Alki Beach is just a short drive away.  Christine is a great host and provided wonderful house instructions.  Would definitely stay here again.
1538865,15482210,2014-07-10,10607635,Mike,"Christine was a great host. She greeted us, gave us an invaluable rundown of the local neighborhood and then left us to our own devices. The house was everything we needed, with the bonus of a very friendly and inquisitive cat! Thanks again."
1538865,16336971,2014-07-26,12910668,John,"Chris was a great host. She was quick to answer any questions we had, no matter how small. She also was gracious enough to leave information about the Seattle area for us to use. Her house was pretty easy to find and in a pretty nice area of West Seattle. Only a few blocks from the main street that is loaded with shops and resturants. Plus, just a few minutes drive to a local park that gives you a great view of downtown Seattle. Also very close is the passenger only ferry terminal that takes you right downtown, or if you prefer to drive, its a very easy trip, from her place,to the major highways.
  The house is very comfortable and has tons of very cool items decorating her walls. Nice back yard to relax in after a busy day of site seeing or shopping. As close is the house is the major area on the west side it was very quiet. If you are looking for a nice place not far from downtown I would highly recomend here. 
 "
1538865,16834207,2014-08-03,16101387,Carissa,"My boyfriend and I had a wonderful stay at Christine's home.  It was very easy to find and in a great location in West Seattle.  We had a car so we didn't get to experience the foot ferry to Seattle, but the docks for it were very close.  It was an easy drive to Seattle as well.  Her home was very comfortable and had all the amenities we needed for our stay.  She left us some very helpful brochures and tips about the area, as well as some yummy homemade muffins for us.  It was a great find and we would stay here again!"
1538865,17977790,2014-08-19,18398532,Diethard,"Wir hatten eine richtig gute Zeit in Christines kleinem Haus in West Seattle.
Die Viertel ist angenehm ruhig und bietet trotzdem viele Einkaufsmöglichkeiten, Restaurants etc.. Alki Beach ist in der Nähe und Downtown Seattle mit dem Auto oder Wassertaxi schnell zu erreichen. 
Christines Kommunikation war vorbildlich und wir wurden bestens informiert. 
Das Haus ist einfach, aber gut ausgestattet und der Garten bietet
Kindern viel Platz für Bewegung. (Unser Sohn hat das große Trampolin sehr genossen...) 
Wir freuen uns auf ein nächstes Mal."
1538865,21079023,2014-10-11,19597383,Maggie,The house was very lovely. The house cat mittens was a great companion. Christine was very helpful and left a lot of information about the area. The area had lots of great food options and we where able to get to downtown Seattle using a water ferry. Great place to stay in the Seattle area. 
1538865,23387879,2014-11-30,23395527,Carrey,"Christine e-mailed me several times about the house before our stay.  She let me know where things were and made me feel welcome in her home.  She left a thorough list about her house, wi fi password, where all the stores were, and even left brochures about things to do and see in the neighborhood and city.  I thought her house was darling.  The neighborhood is very nice and quiet, and the neighbor I saw was friendly.  Her cat, Mittens, was gorgeous and very affectionate.  We even briefly visited with the hamster who was pretty cute, too.  It was a good place to stay and I felt quite at home.  "
1538865,36796426,2015-07-01,34541629,Adam,My host made me feel at home by including information about fun activities in the area. The listing was accurate and the house was overall very nice and by the end I didn't want to leave.
1538865,39021648,2015-07-20,10321287,Elly,"Christine was a great host - very easy to contact and communicate with. She gave us simple instructions which made our stay very relaxing. The house is very cosy and has a wonderful ""homey"" feeling to it. We truly felt like we weren't too far from our actual home. West Seattle is a great neighbourhood and has a great vibe. A 20 min walk to the water taxi will allow you to get to downtown in no time - making things like the space needle and pikes place super easy to get to. Very close to the highways allowing easy access to the city and surrounds. I would recommend Christine's place to anyone wanting to visit Seattle! Thank you for having us! "
1538865,40330880,2015-07-30,34785450,Katie,A great place to stay in a nice neighbourhood.  Christine's house had everything we needed.  It was easy to get downtown and nice to have a private retreat away from downtown.  Walking through Schmidt park and down to Alki beach highly recommended.  Christine was great at keeping in touch and helping us prepare for our trip and left lots of info on things to do in the area.
1538865,46151684,2015-09-08,3373251,Brittany,"The host was very kind and welcomed us to her home with a complimentary bottle of wine. The description was accurate and the home was pleasant. The location was in west Seattle, which is a fun part of the city as well. Just a short drive of about 15 min. into the downtown. "
7087957,38966368,2015-07-19,1713611,Mark,"Fantastic location in the heart of Capitol Hill. The floorplan is like that of a hotel with a nice kitchen nook and an authentic, Seattle vibe. Craig greeted us when we arrived and gave clear instructions that made our stay even more pleasant. I'd stay here again when I find myself in Seattle next."
7087957,39689127,2015-07-25,8852688,Mai,"I didn't get a chance to meet my host but I was absolutely okay with it, because I was only in town for a conference and wanted privacy. The apartment was spot clean and in a great neighborhood. All the essentials were as described on airbnb website. I had a pleasant stay. This place is perfect/ideal for someone who's looking for an alternative to a hotel and values efficiency, convenience, and privacy. "
7087957,40021224,2015-07-27,98330,Chris,"Convenient neighborhood and a great studio for 1-2 people to use as a base to explore the city.  It's updated and modern, while retaining charm. Small kitchenette is suitable for cooking a very small meal, or preparing leftovers from one of the great local restaurants.  (Hey, it's vacation... eat out!)

Good bed, nice TV and free wi-fi make your time in the studio quite nice.

The $50 gift card to the restaurant/cocktail bar below was a nice plus!"
7087957,40271956,2015-07-29,38971264,Jeremy,"A lovely little apartment in the best area of cap hill.   Really enjoyed my first air B&B 

Thanks Craig for your charming space.  "
7087957,40983699,2015-08-03,38597764,Lora,"The Capitol Hill studio is centrally located for getting around Seattle. Lots of great restaurant options within walking distance. Most visitors will not need a car. Onsite assistance is superb. Very accommodating. Concerns are addressed immediately. It was unusually hot when I was there and they provided me with an extra fan. I had a late flight, but was also able to store luggage after check-out. They are also sending me something in the mail that I left behind in the apartment. As the listing states, it is across from a fire station so bring earplugs if you are a light sleeper. Cute apartment; great service. "
7087957,41440273,2015-08-07,37189109,Jorge,"We stayed from Aug. 3rd- 6th and absolutely loved it. It's about 15 mins walking distance to Pike Place Market but feels like a lot less as you're distracted with so many things to see along the way. The apartment feels like small hotel suite: clean, spacious, sitting area and small kitchen. Great host, nice apartment - we highly recommend this place!"
7087957,42172063,2015-08-11,38617008,Daniel,This place was great. Right in the middle of a vibrant neighborhood. The room is perfect for a couple. Very clean - felt like a hotel. The neighborhood has a lot to offer anyone. I would recommend staying here.
7087957,43103023,2015-08-17,37604112,Lisa,I highly recommend this host! I had an amazing and relaxing trip. The studio was nothing but charming!! Thanks again!
7087957,44337260,2015-08-25,36898820,Suzy,Jessica provided easy access to the unit on the day of our arrival. She shared some wonderful ideas for meals in the neighborhood.  The unit was clean and simple.  Great location with easy access to bus routes and/or walking destinations throughout Seattle.  
7087957,45390443,2015-09-02,25970701,Alex,"I absolutely loved my stay in this beautiful studio! AMAZING location, impeccably clean, well-appointed and comfortable.

I plan on staying here as often as I can when visiting Seattle and I highly suggest checking it out. You will absolutely not be disappointed!"
7087957,46486722,2015-09-11,17617692,Theresa,"This Capital Hill studio apartment is beautiful, charming, and very clean. Location is perfect! We had a car, yet didn't really need one. We walked everywhere. The bedding was amazing and I plan on purchasing the same down pillows first chance I get. The building is old and charming and the apartment is totally updated and comfortable. Jessica, the host, was very gracious and welcoming. Can't wait to return!! "
7087957,46812495,2015-09-13,1402496,Amelia,So great! Beautiful space. Tons of bars around but not noisy in the apartment. Would definitely come again!
7087957,47371351,2015-09-18,40505484,Virginia,"This is my first Airbnb experience and Jessica is incredible. She added some very nice personal touches that made my stay comfortable and the condo welcoming when I arrived. There was a hand written thank you note, fresh home baked cookies, and a gift card to the restaurant downstairs waiting for me when I checked in. There was a hair dryer, fresh towels, and travel sized shampoo, conditioner, soap and lotion for me to use. She was also kind enough to deliver some Kuerig coffee cups to my door when I mentioned that there weren't any left in the kitchen. The neighborhood is wonderful. It's walking distance to some great restaurants, including my new favorite breakfast spot for acai bowls called Healeo's. I will definitely be staying here again and recommending this location to fellow colleagues and friends traveling to Seattle. "
7087957,47695124,2015-09-21,40427602,Patricia,"Jessica was a perfect  host, making sure I had everything I needed to have a great experience.  She was available for any questions and checked in with me to make sure all was well."
7087957,48142171,2015-09-23,989774,Lori,"The easiest and most enjoyable experience by far. Excellent host, quick to respond and very helpful. Free coffee!  The apt is cute and has all you need. Great location too. "
7087957,48257741,2015-09-24,989774,Lori,"I booked an additional day, so I already wrote a review.  This place is great, perfect for one or two folks who want to explore Capitol Hill.  I used to live in the neighborhood and came for work reasons."
7087957,48774510,2015-09-28,38476519,Vanessa,"The apartment is very nice - feels like a modern hotel room. Super clean. The location is great, close to some very good restaurants and cafes (including the Italian restaurant located at the corner of the building to which we received a $50 gift card from Jessica - much appreciated!). There is some noise from the street below (may not be ideal location for light sleepers). Communication with Jessica was very easy. We enjoyed our stay at this location."
7087957,49049758,2015-09-30,43914432,Romney,"Very sweet, and quaint as described, and right in the heart of it all. Appreciate how clean it was and Jessica's many efforts to make sure we knew where it was and that we got in okay. A perfect landing especially for a few nights in town."
7087957,49395630,2015-10-03,45214071,Suzanne,Clean and comfortable! Great location! 
7087957,49924158,2015-10-07,5288856,Alison,"This apartment was a great spot for our first trip to Seattle. The location on Capitol Hill was excellent - so many great restaurants and interesting shops just around the corner and very convenient to downtown. The apartment itself is charming, clean, well-decorated and has an efficiency kitchen for simple cooking - but I recommend going out to eat as much as possible to get the most out of the neighborhood! We enjoyed some great pasta at Spinasse downstairs and Jessica dropped off some awesome chocolate chip cookies as a farewell gift. Totally recommend this place! "
7087957,50530282,2015-10-12,10972097,Jessica,"Absolutely one of the best Airbnb experiences! The apartment is perfect for a couple and the location could not get any better in the Capitol Hill area. Jessica was a great host who made sure we got in safely and had everything we needed. She also welcomed us with a nice card and gift card to the restaurant below the apartment. I would highly recommend this place to any other couple wishing to explore Seattle. Thank you, Jessica! "
7087957,50890567,2015-10-15,45950995,Trevor,"Terrific place, wonderful location, very responsive. Highly recommend - very choice."
7087957,53003558,2015-11-03,3272978,Jacqueline,"This was one of my favorite Airbnb stays EVER. Awesome neighborhood, easy check-in and out, and a very beautiful apartment. A few nice touches from Jessica: blow dryer in apartment (yay!), thoughtful card left for me, and one of the best beds ever. I will definitely stay here again next time I'm in Seattle. I highly recommend checking out this apartment! "
7087957,53380109,2015-11-08,46978010,Hannah,"My fiancé and I visited Seattle for the first time and we had a wonderful time thanks to Jessica! The place was perfect for what we came to do - explore Seattle. While we weren't in the room very often, it was nice to come back to a small, quaint, cozy and very charming studio to sleep or rest and watch TV. The location was great too. There is a TON to do in the Capitol Hill area where it is located and downtown is about a 25-30 minute walk which is great if you're a first-timer and wanting to explore Seattle by foot. We used the bus/trolley and also Lyft as ways to get around as well. No problems at all. Jessica is super responsive if you ever need anything. Would stay again! "
7087957,53856704,2015-11-13,9189583,Alexei,"probably the best airbnb stay i've had so far. Jessica was very cordial and accommodating.  the space itself is like a hotel room, but the experience is better because it's in a classic Seattle apartment building.

• the unit is spectacular
• the amenities provided are spectacular
• the location is spectacular

this review might read better if i tapped into a more diverse collection of adjectives, but it's hard to do so because ""spectacular"" really is how i felt staying here.

i would, hands down, recommend this unit as a location and Jessica as a host to any of my friends.  moreover, i'd recommend this unit to the high-maintenance parents that some of my friends have too. and that's saying a lot if you kno how snobby those elders can be.

5 stars."
7087957,54836114,2015-11-23,23595713,Phil,The host canceled this reservation 35 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
7087957,55267243,2015-11-29,14780052,Veronica,"Jessica was prompt in communication, enthusiastic in spirit and provided a lovely welcome for our Thanksgiving stay in Seattle. The studio was crisp, ready and well-appointed. We walked everywhere and didn't have too much trouble finding parking at all. This was one of the best air bnb experiences we've had and I would highly recommend this host and studio."
7087957,55746450,2015-12-05,19661560,Mechelle,"This has been my best Airbnb experience to date! The apartment felt like a cozy hotel- great design/color palette for relaxing. It's located in a quieter part of Cap Hill, with plenty to do in walking distance. There is also nearby parking in case you have a car. I was greeted with fresh baked cookies. Great host! Great apartment! Great location! Great experience! I'd stay here again in a heartbeat :)"
7087957,56684249,2015-12-16,50085003,John,"Very clean, cozy apartment. Bed has a great memory foam mattress. Appreciated nice shampoo and body lotion also."
271509,2189981,2012-09-04,582752,Roman,"This is a nice location with easy access to pikes market and the space needle.  The unit does face a bar so you'll hear loud music until about 2am on Friday and Saturday nights.  It isn't so bad with the windows closed but if you are a light sleeper you may want to look elsewhere.  

"
271509,2914944,2012-11-19,1840126,Shaun,The location and furnishings were fantastic. The apartment slept six comfortably. Darik made checking in really easy. I would definitely come again.
271509,3378943,2013-01-20,956582,Melissa,"This apartment was a perfect place for our trip. I love its location. Your in an authentic area in Seattle - not the in the retail buzz area of downtown and not in the tourist-heavy areas of the Space Needle or the Market. Even better, you are a 10 minute walk from all of these places without being in a touristy area. The place itself was amazing. The beds were great. And I want those pillows! The place is nicely decorated in a modern style. You have a great corner view. Definitely perfect for 3 girls."
271509,3776238,2013-03-13,656321,Stephanie,"Darik's flat was wonderfully located and highly recommended all around. The rental easily held 4 people and we all slept very well on the comfortable beds. The furniture was quality and we loved the fully stocked kitchen and amenities such as pool, hot tub, and laundry. The location was very central and a short walk to Pike's Market, a ton of restaurants, stores, etc. Thanks Darik for a wonderful stay!"
271509,4329002,2013-04-28,5943721,Elizabeth,"Exactly as described and even better upon arrival. Excellent communication with Hosts. Wish our stay could've been longer, we felt very at home and at peace while in the condo. All around great experience. "
271509,5307756,2013-06-24,5249698,Jennifer,"Absolutely fantastic stay. So many great restaurants and sites to see in Belltown. We stayed here for the Rock & Roll Half Marathon and it was perfectly within walking distance of everything we needed. We didn't even need to walk because we had a car, but it was just easier to walk than drive. It was like an upscale hotel crossed with a family apartment. Perfect for our needs. "
271509,9126843,2013-12-09,2559074,Reinaldo,"Superb experience! I knew how the apartment would look like, but my friends were amazed when we arrived. There was a person waiting for us to do the check in, show us the unit and all the procedures related to the building. We could talk to the staff during the weekend when we needed, and even when I had already checked out and had my flight cancelled on a sunday morning I could call Darik for help. In a short period of time he arranged my return to the same unit I was. What can I say? Thank you Darik, Alan and Sarah and congratulations for the job!
Only one con during the stay: the internet speed in the unit was too slow and unstable. The other unit I rented didn't have the same problem. Well, it wasn't perfect, but got very very close. Oh, and the towels are so good! :-)
I don't consider staying in another place when visiting Seattle again."
271509,22965633,2014-11-18,7034085,Sarah,"This AirBnB experience was extremely satisfactory for me and my colleague during our 2-night business trip! I chose this property for the following aspects, and it delivered on all accounts.
* Floor plan (2 bedroom); 
* Price (cheaper than individual rooms in nearby hotels); 
* Location (Belltown; 5 minute walk to Pike's Place Market; 2 minute drive to highway since we took meetings everywhere from Bothell to Tacoma); 
* Garage parking (since we had a rental car); and
* Wi-fi connection (since we had to do work in the evenings).

Some notables:
(+) The Macrina Bakery downstairs and around the corner is healthy, delicious, super cute, caters to European tastebuds, and is open early. It was perfect for us for breakfast.

(+) Location is primo! Immediate access to nice shops, restaurants, bars, and the infamous Pike's Place Market.

(+) This is a great property for business travelers. There is a large table at which to do work with great overhead lighting, and of course the wi-fi is a necessity. And for unrelated colleagues, it is a nice apartment because the bedrooms are on opposite sides of the space.

(+/-) The second bedroom is tiny, as in, the bed fills the entire room and there is no room to put even a carry-on suitcase. So, my luggage stayed out in the living room the entire time, which was no bother for us because we did not actually use the living room space. But for someone who would do so, you should expect to do a Suitcase Shuffle each day."
271509,24466121,2014-12-29,21942555,Bod,"Excellent experience. The booking process was easy, a wealth of information was provided and all the relevant documents were easy to sign and easy to access when needed. The place itself was great, very accurately portrayed on the listing, I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again next time we visit Seattle! Thank you!"
271509,28241526,2015-03-20,29091268,Michael,"Absolutely pleasant experience with the host.  Well organized and professionally operated.  Host accommodated us extra air-bed for us.  Great location in the city, and clean / modern facility.  I would definitely come back when visiting Seattle."
271509,28502850,2015-03-24,12639624,Judith,"Darik, Sally, and Sara gave us ample information so getting there was a  true welcome! We arrived early and even with their busy schedule, allowed us to pick up our keys and parked at an earlier time. The unit we stayed at was exactly what was described and more (positive note). The welcome tray was a BIG hit! The place was clean, tidy, orderly, and fully equipped especially with towels. The towels, pillows, linens, and robes smelled invitingly fresh."
271509,28667228,2015-03-28,8595729,Alan,I had a great time here. The location was fantastic and so were the amenities. Darik had everything set up for us and I couldn't imagine a better time.
4082250,20459925,2014-09-29,14817330,Cori,"In capitol hill, it can be hard to find a quiet place to rest after a day of work or play, but this place managed to be incredibly walkable, yet still peaceful.  Thank you for a relaxing long weekend! Lovely!"
4082250,38454157,2015-07-15,37850561,Jenny,Good location - Capital Hill is a great area.  Apartment was not as clean as we are comfortable with - we appreciate that the host split the cost with us to get the place cleaned while we were there.
4082250,39209838,2015-07-21,1495137,Lahn,Wesley's place is in a great location on the hill and close to downtown. Communication was easy and he arranged to have his friend meet me at the apartment and let me in. I feel like the towels and bed linen quality could be improved but overall I had a great stay. 
1549973,7026986,2013-09-03,8262375,Mahyar,"The apartment was clean, basic and sufficient.  Furniture is definitely cheap ikea stuff, except possibly the couch.  The queen bed seemed small for a queen bed, I think it was actually a double sized bed, since it was easy to make my feet go over the edge.  Pillows were similarly small and the sheets & blankets were similarly cheap. "
1549973,15920668,2014-07-18,16998734,Harry,"A very helpful and nice host. The listing was everything it said it would be, and very close to the UW campus. Overall would recommend to anyone as a cheap alternative to a hotel."
1549973,17891106,2014-08-18,19574279,Melissa,"I live in Seattle, and rented this unit when I had friends in town. I'm familiar with the neighborhood so new what to expect. Everything was great and was exactly what we needed, mostly just a place to sleep, and spent our days enjoying the city.  The place was comfortable and clean, and there is a small selection of dishes, thought we ate out mostly. If you're planning on spending a lot of time cooking, I recommend bringing some cooking supplies, (and bottle opener/wine opener). Though everything served our purposes just fine. Melissa was very nice and I certainly have no complaints!"
1549973,18278830,2014-08-24,3842353,Scott,"We had no problems with our stay, check in was easy and smooth.  The apartment is very modest with limited amenities, but worked for us."
1549973,18549317,2014-08-28,11604344,Kao-Yu,"Upsides:
(i) great location (2 or 3 blocks away from UW. Approximately 5-min walk to University Way and 8-min walk to UW campus)
(ii) spacious (this is a big one-bed room with an over-sized living room)
(iii) blazing fast internet (I used it for a video-conference on WebEx and watching on-line streaming videos all the time) 
Downsides:
(i) loud noise (this is not a quiet building as advertised. Instead, the living room faces a main street where heavy traffic coming in from high way all day. Even worse, this unit is located less than 10 feet from the back of a hotel and the bedroom faces the laundry room and trash dumpsters of the hotel. As a result, the laundry machines send loud noise to the bedroom throughout day and night, and the garbage truck comes in around 7am every other day)  
(ii) parking fees (the host charges $8 for parking)
(iii) old complex (the wall is paper thin so you can hear someone talking or watching tv upstairs and next door)
The host seems to control many apartments in that neighborhood so you have many options. Avoid this property unless you can fall asleep no matter what.    
"
1549973,18823835,2014-09-01,3226466,Miles,"The good: Melissa is a wonderful person and was incredibly kind to us. We foolishly locked ourselves out the first day and Melissa was kind enough to let us back in without taking a ton of time. Also she brought us extra towels and made sure the place was set up for us. Really, I can't praise Melissa enough for being so nice.

Also the apartment was exceptionally clean, like just had cleaners do a deep clean type clean.

Also it's relatively inexpensive, close to bus lines into downtown and near some decent college restaurants. 

The less good: The pictures are not representative of this space. It really is a bare-bones College style apartment. Old building. Dingy common space. The bedroom was also really noisy from the nearby laundry room and back alley used by trucks. This was all fine with us because we were just sleeping there and the price is/was right."
1549973,22559257,2014-11-09,22279114,Will,"I arrived early and was able to leave my luggage in a different room, which I appreciated. Somewhat less nice was the difference between the space I ended up getting and the original I had rented. Ms Yao had unfortunately scheduled some renovations for the day of my arrival and I ended up with a different apartment which was less well furnished than the one advertised. However she was very accommodating and I was perfectly content with the apartment I ended up getting."
8463726,49579729,2015-10-04,19175808,Riadh,"Jennifer was a lovely host. She had recently just moved to the area so was still familiarizing herself, however she did take us up to the rooftop patio at night and it was stunning! We stayed up late in the night talking and visiting like we were old friends. We were made to feel very much at home! "
8463726,50414886,2015-10-11,23685145,Alex,"This Airbnb is in a brand new apartment building that is very stylish and modern looking with lots of interesting artwork on the hallway walls. Jennifer was a wonderful host and very thorough in showing where everything was and where to go in the building.  She even showed me the rooftop lounge and firepit that was really great to hang out there in the evening time.  The private room had minimal things in it,  but the bed was comfortable and I could get good rest. There is a small desk in the living room area that was nice when doing any computer work.  The kitchen was new and very clean with most everything you need.  Overall,  a very nice experience and I would stay there again. "
8463726,51409594,2015-10-19,21642529,Carlos,"Jennifer's place is well located and the building is brand-new.
The room is a bit small but for one person it's ok.

"
8463726,52450310,2015-10-29,5438975,Michael,"Jenny's  place is a brand-new complex right in the middle of the Wallingford area of Seattle. Plenty of restaurants, live music, pubs, and bars within a short walk. The rooftop hangout area is excellent! 
A very quiet apartment, and Jenny is quite busy, so easy to rest. 
It's a rather small place, but the room is fine. Seattle can get cold, so the room has it's own built-in heat and thermostat. 
This is a great place for a busy work traveler, or someone who is looking to be out and about most of the time."
8463726,56266439,2015-12-11,15816919,David,"Jennifer was great; super friendly.  I had everything I needed in the apartment.  The apartment was clean, conveniently located, quiet.  No problems at all.  I'd definitely consider returning here next time I'm in Seattle.

5873892,34080189,2015-06-04,16975625,Tofunmi,"Clean, quiet and close to many downtown areas by car ( I didn't really use public transportation). I stayed here while going on job interviews and it was everything I expected. I thought a personal key for the room was a nice touch of both privacy and security. I'd recommend it again."
5873892,34576037,2015-06-09,34460809,Nathan,"Simon and Jennifer were great hosts and made our experience in Seattle unforgettable. They were very welcoming and provided all necessities (such as an electric fan, towels, shampoo, etc) to make our stay very comfortable. Their house is spacious and clean, and the room provided is exactly as it looks: bright, comfortable, clean, and with fast wifi. Parking was always available no matter what time we were at home. They respected our privacy and were never intrusive. We plan to keep in touch and will definitely come back to stay when we visit Seattle again."
5873892,35672123,2015-06-21,33007098,Candice,Very lovely and clean bedroom. House is close to downtown Seattle and the airport. Kitchen are clean and available to use. Provides parking space and Wifi. Recommend to every traveler !!!

Jennifer was a really nice host. There is s big Kitchen with all you need.
I really recomend this rooms and would come back again."
5873892,36304796,2015-06-27,33949862,Lilly,"Great location just approximately 15 minutes from downtown. The room is clean, bright and airy with parking accommodations. "
5873892,36979850,2015-07-03,34744278,Julia,"The room was very clean and had all the basic essentials we needed for our two-night stay in Seattle. Just a note, we didn't know we would be sharing a bathroom with two other airbnbers, which threw our mornings off a bit regarding timing. Otherwise, we were content with our stay! "
5873892,37254243,2015-07-05,28842833,Sophia,"The room and also the bathroom are very clean. It's easy to feel comfortable.
The house is located in a calm neighborhood and very close to the busstop which takes you directly downtown. Unfortunately we didnt meet the Family besides the brother who was nice."
5873892,37702002,2015-07-09,6485259,George,"Great place to stay!  The house was very clean and tidy.  The host greeted us once we arrived, but didn't make any further contact after that.  In the room, a list of a few house rules was posted which included the host's phone number, wi-fi information, and local eateries.  Just outside downtown Seattle by about 10-15 minutes' drive.  Parking is available out on the street.  It is close to an airport, which causes some noise through the day or night, but we did not find this distracting or off-putting.  There was a fan in the room which was great to have during the heat wave while we were there.  The bathroom is shared with other guests on the second floor of the house.  Would recommend to anyone visiting Seattle!"
5873892,40933826,2015-08-03,36206189,Jt,"The location was great, close proximity to downtown Seattle. Parking was also not an issue. The room was big, bathroom was clean and spacious as well. Unfortunately, it was unusually hot in Seattle that week, and there was no a/c, which made the room very hot and uncomfortable. Other that that, the stay was great. Thanks! "
5873892,42312766,2015-08-12,39197598,Esther,"Didn't get to actually meet the host, but we were greeted by a cute little girl who welcomed us to our room. The room was clean. There were a few spiders, but not a big deal. The neighborhood was alright, but if you are taking public transportation, it can feel a little sketchy at night. Overall the room was good and we would stay here again. "
5873892,42539023,2015-08-14,35878643,Annuka,We stayed at Jennifer's house for 2 days. The room we had was big enough for us and the bed was very nice to sleep in. The house is really big. Our room was upstairs. We shared the bathroom with other airbnb guest which was fine with us. We could use the kitchen and everything in it. The house is near an airport so you could hear the airplanes. If you have no problem with that it's perfect. We used the car so I don't know about public transportation. For us it was the right place to stay and we would come back when we visit Seattle again :) 
5873892,43052615,2015-08-17,34321045,Donna,"Lovely, clean and easy to get around Seattle from this location without a car.  As someone who had never visited Seattle downtown and its sights were only a short 20-25 minute bus ride.  
The room, bathroom were clean along with instructions for travel and wifi clearly visible. I ate out for the majority of my stay but had full access to the kitchen any time.  I'm glad I choose this location for my first Seattle visit. "
5873892,43443929,2015-08-19,10485035,Kevin,"Staying at Jen's was great! Checking in and out was very easy and the room was tidy. Hotel-like experience all in all, would recommend! "
5873892,44848794,2015-08-29,24121006,Gerardo,"The place was really clean. I didn't mind sharing a bathroom with three other airbnbers because it was maintained clean at all times. Check in was really easy. Jennifer's husband was able to welcome us a few hours past check in time, which was great.

The location is not so bad, about a 10-15 minute drive into town. 20 minutes bus ride to international district. The neighborhood might look a bit sketchy but it's safe and quiet, apart from the planes you hear around 5am because King County international airport is nearby. 
I would definitely be staying here next time I'm back."
5873892,45670190,2015-09-05,37397178,Helene&Jelle,Best veel lawaai van vliegtuigen en snelweg maar daar wenden we heel snel aan. Directe bus naar downtown Seattle was erg fijn. Zeker aan te raden.
5873892,46547186,2015-09-11,43389143,Xuefu,"之前总会担心住private room会有些不方便，但住的这几天感觉很好，房间很舒适也很干净。房主一家人都很好很热情，(website hidden) was a good experience for us,thank you! :)"
5873892,47041552,2015-09-15,36987382,Rose,"The host made us feel welcomed even though we did not meet her. The room was as described on the site. The bus stop into the city center was 3 blocks away. She was very generous in providing bottled water, tea, cereal, snacks, cup of noodles. "
5873892,47490949,2015-09-19,40724323,雁婷,Very nice hostel and friendly landlord..near bus stop and convenient.I like this place.If I will go to again.I msut stay here again!!
5873892,47682919,2015-09-21,34113441,Verena,"We stayed for two nights in Jennifer's comfy guestroom and would definitely return if we should stay in Seattle again. The room itself is flawlessly clean, bright and comfy and the bathroom which we shared with some other airb'n'b guests is as well. Check-In was very easy, although we arrived a good deal later than expected because of a lockbox where we could find our keys. We didn't meet Jennifer in person until our very last day but were introduced by her nice family who showed us everything when we arrived. Besides, Jennifer was very fast to reply through airb'n'b message system when we needed to ask something.
We were supplied with water and towels and were allowed to use the kitchen downstairs. When we had any questions we were kindly helped by her family and felt at home the whole time of our stay.
On our last day we were even allowed to leave our suitcases at the house so that we could explore Seattle one more day without having to worry about our luggage.
The area of Jennifer's house is kind of a Seattle suburb that is well connected to downtown by bus, on our first evening we had still our rental car which we could park on the property. 
Thank you very much, we really enjoyed our stay."
5873892,48166640,2015-09-24,33572866,Ann,"The room was very clean and we had lots of privacy. All of our questions were answered in a timely manner. Overall, a pleasant experience and we would definitely stay here again. "
5873892,48898043,2015-09-29,20571088,Eric,"Chambre propre, à l'étage, où se trouvent 4 chambres ""airbnb"" et la salle de bain commune. Cette dernière est propre également.
Possibilité d'utiliser la cuisine et le frigo.
Échanges limités avec la famille d'origine chinoise, notamment du fait de la barrière de la langue. Pas d'accueil réel, je ne sais toujours pas qui est Jennifer."
5873892,49171966,2015-10-01,28258634,Chrissy,"Very clean home. I didn't meet any of the family but I didn't mind. My room was very clean and comfortable. The towels left in my room to use were some of the fluffiest towels I've ever used. The only complaint I kind of had (and this is not the hosts fault) is that other air bnb folks staying were really loud and slammed doors and took forever in the bathrooms in the morning. Overall, I'd stay here again!"
5873892,49711456,2015-10-05,8554626,Terry Logan,I really enjoyed staying at Jennifer's house. It was easy to find and to check in. Parking was easy. The room and bathroom were very neat and clean. She had fluffy towels an bottled water in the the room. I will definitely stay here again!
5873892,49986099,2015-10-08,16789652,Jamie,"She was very nice and greeted us when we arrive. We had parking in the driveway & the house/room/bathroo
m was clean. We were happy with our stay. Thank you!"
5873892,51144422,2015-10-18,43395241,Ka Yi,"Jennifer is very responsive in messages, her place is very clean as well! Driving to downtown is quick, we enjoyed staying at her place!"
5873892,51898992,2015-10-25,2686268,Thai,"My family and I stayed in Jennifer's home for 5 days.  The room was great and clean.  We had nice clean towels, water bottles, and house slippers ready waiting for us.  My daughter loved the little girl living there too."
5873892,52582245,2015-10-31,8769561,Robert And Holly,"This is a super clean, well located and safe place that we recommend to other travelers!"
5873892,53982001,2015-11-15,3793174,Ma. Lourdes,"Location was very convenient as the bus to downtown stopped right in front. There's a 25 min. walk to a light rail stop, which is also right next to a fantastic Vietnamese restaurant ( Rainier BBQ). Jennifer was kind and responsive enough to let us check in early and drop off our luggage. Since this is an airbnb, one should prepare to live as the host does. So to have the amenities we were used to, we bought hand soap since there was only hand sanitizer in the bathroom, and a wash cloth since only a body towel was made available to us. We didn't get to use the kitchen much, except for getting water from the tap for drinking, and it tasted great. Another thing to prepare for when staying here is that there's only one bathroom for the three rooms upstairs, so be sure to take your showers during off times (I made the mistake of waiting until night to shower and I had to wait until 11:15PM for it to be available). One more important thing to remember is this is an Asian home so shoes absolutely stay outside. There's a shoe rack on the front steps, and though there's awning, make sure to have a plastic bag to cover your shoes. I made the mistake of believing the awning would protect from the rain, but then stuck my foot in a soaked hiking boot when I got l left in the morning. I may have gotten two insect bites; I don't want to presume since this may have happened elsewhere, but when I woke up in bed, I had two quarter inch sized itches right next to each other. The place seemed very clean and food wasn't allowed in the rooms so this may have just been my bad luck. All in all, I'm grateful to Jennifer for her hospitality."
5873892,54722479,2015-11-23,46019170,Nina,Our host left us bottles of water which was nice. The listing was accurate and our room was comfortable and spacious. 
5873892,55219564,2015-11-29,42237248,Yi,"The room is exactly like the what it looks like in the picture. We didn't get the chance to meet Jennifer, but she's very nice, and is reachable through texting. "
5873892,55549352,2015-12-01,49831337,Umut,"It was my first time using this app and it was quite easy when we arrived at the house the body told me how to get in and get to the room, everything was very clean and very comfortable and private it was a very enjoyable stay. "
5873892,56824392,2015-12-18,32419224,Loren,"Very nice modern home. Room has desk and desk light in it, which was of great use to me. Family is friendly. I hope to return soon!"

9068419,54457571,2015-11-20,1728547,Jennifer,My husband and I loved staying at Hugo's studio!  The space is really well designed and cozy.  Great location too.  
9068419,55429453,2015-12-01,36247151,Melissa,"A great apartment.  Really clean, warm and well equipped in a quiet location close to public transport.  Everything was well detailed in the house manual, and Hugo was very quick to respond to all messages before and during my stay.  I would absolutely stay here again."
9068419,55870166,2015-12-06,10137582,Cailin,"Hugo's studio was a great spot - clean, simple, comfortable - from which to base my travels for a few days in Seattle. I would recommend Hugo as a host, and this garage/studio for anyone looking to stay in this part of Seattle."
9068419,56424915,2015-12-13,2684634,Rebecca,"We Loved staying at Hugo's Workshop Studio. It was a clean, well designed space, with all the necessities.  "

We took for a walk in a park near the studio every day. If I go to the Seattle, I'd like to stay the Hugo's again."
8988178,54923185,2015-11-25,5956272,Iver,"Paige's place was very nice to come to after a long journey, and it immediately felt cozy and nice.  It was very clean and open, and the check in was smooth.  She had left fresh towels and a nice bag of soaps, and we immediately felt at home.  It was super convenient to get to and was very nicely situated in a great neighbourhood with lots of close amenities.  Great coffee shop 2 blocks away, and a nice breakfast joint as well.  There is a Whole Foods just down the hill which we walked to a few times.  

Also i have to say that Paige was nice to converse with and easy to ask questions to and the booking process was very accommodating.  We had a great stay at Paige's and Seattle, and we would definitely stay here again.  We definitely can recommend this place.

Thanks Paige!"
3766055,16879603,2014-08-03,19308605,Crystal,Beautiful home. Gorgeous room. Lovely and kind hostess. Would definitely stay again.
3766055,16967005,2014-08-04,1922748,Lori,"On Friday August 2nd my husband and I spontaneously decided to take a trip to Seattle and we love the AirBnb friends we have met in our adventures. Sure enough we were not disappointed. Claire was a delightful hostess and our private room and bathroom was exceptional.  

We are always looking for like minded homes and found her to have an allergy free philosophy. 

Our stay was her second booking and we will definitely book again with Claire on our next Seattle visit. "
3766055,17132003,2014-08-07,8438744,Haylee,This was the perfect spot for me to have a quiet getaway with close access to UW.  Claire was super welcoming and gave a few recommendations for coffee shop spot and Green Lake!  She was friendly and gave me privacy too.  It was a great stay and I look forward to returning!
3766055,18079284,2014-08-21,15495130,文,"We are an elderly couple from China stayed 14 nights at Clare's home. Claire is a great master! We do not speak English, but we through Google translate, communicate through body language, we communicate very well! Really wonderful life experience! Clean rooms, comfortable beds, beautiful master! Garden-like environment, very convenient transportation from the University of Washington and Seattle are very close to downtown. Claire gives you absolute privacy, everything is so beautiful! Claire was a sportsman, fond of outdoor sports, she is so beautiful! Charismatic! We will return to Claire's house.
"
3766055,18429909,2014-08-26,11270066,Etienne,"L'accueil de Claire à été chaleureux, la chambre était très propre et confortable pour ces cinq jours. La maison de claire est tres proche des arrêt de bus et les commerces, starbucks et restaurants accessible à pied en 10min.
Nous avons aimé partager la maison de notre hôte."
3766055,18606067,2014-08-28,12031029,Sara,"Claire was a wonderful host! We chose her because it seemed we had much in common, being the outdoorsy type, and the choice was right. Claire was very friendly and welcoming, and also had good knowledge of the area that she shared with us. Her home is beautiful and ""homey"", and very clean. It was a shame we could only stay 2 nights, but would definitely look to stay with Claire again if we visited the Seattle area!"
3766055,18818029,2014-09-01,10141891,Ricardo,Natsumi and Motoya let me know how consistently kind Claire was to lend a hand. No problems whatsoever. Thank you!

3766055,26260477,2015-02-08,2391673,New,We had really good communication with Claire. All her descriptions were right on. The location is really convenient. We loved the quiet house and environment. 
3766055,26414965,2015-02-12,19569142,Lesah,Claire was very welcoming and the accommodations were quiet and spotless!  The house is located on a very quiet street within easy walking distance to a lovely commercial area and public transportation.

Claire gave me great advice on my quick adventure to the area and showed great care for me personally. I highly recommend her place and the Ravenna neighborhood is gorgeous!!!"
3766055,27928630,2015-03-15,21040399,Amy,Claire was a wonderful host!  Her place is perfect with your own private bathroom right across the hall from the bedroom.  The bed was comfortable and Claire made me feel at home.  She reached out and communicated to make sure I had everything I needed.  Thanks Claire!
3766055,28732347,2015-03-29,28888649,Xin,"Nice place! Claire is a very kind host. My parents really enjoy their journey at Claire's house. It is really convenient, and the price is reasonable. If possible, next time when my parents come to visit me I will still choose here."
3766055,31775368,2015-05-10,25997282,Xiang,"It is a wonderful experience. I stayed in one month and had a good communication with Claire. Claire is very kind and always tries her best to make you feel at home. The house is located in a safe and clean community with walking distance to supermarket (Safeway), Greenlake (good place for running and playing soccer) and public transportation. The 72 and 73 buslines, which run to UW and downtown, are a block over. The 68 busline, which runs to Northgate mall, is also with walking distance. You can even see the snow mountain through the window of Claire’s house. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone who looks for staying in Seattle!"
3766055,34151621,2015-06-05,25822779,Anshul,"She is very helpful and kind person. 
Her house is very well maintained and clean.
I will definitely recommend her home if you are coming to Seattle."
3766055,36079052,2015-06-25,23092188,Stephen,"I was welcomed warmly by Claire who was a fine hostess.
Everything was exactly as described within the house and within my room.
        Everything was quite comfortable , clean, quiet and well 
prepared"
3766055,36234741,2015-06-26,17580258,Jim,"We enjoyed our short, one night, stay with Claire. She helped us plan our bus adventure into downtown Seattle. The house is clean and comfortable. The bed was great. For being in the city, it was quiet at night. "
3766055,38381596,2015-07-15,14988658,Jan,"Claire is a thoughtful and welcoming host. The room is spacious and pleasant; the house itself is in a charming residential neighborhood close to bus lines. I especially appreciate the hypoallergenic details: fragrance-free soaps and detergents, dust-free hardwood floors...We are looking forward to a return stay and definitely recommend Claire as an exceptional Air BnB host."
3766055,38878788,2015-07-19,6723225,Raf,Thanks Claire!!!

3766055,42830299,2015-08-16,14988658,Jan,"This stay was actually a continuation, of sorts, of our stay earlier in the month, so the same review applies. The room was spacious, the proximity of the bathroom made it very convenient. The bed was very comfortable. Claire was a wonderful host. We'd happily stay there again."
3766055,43862004,2015-08-22,40647913,Stephen,"Claire wasn't home during our  one-night stay but worked it out to accommodate us anyway.  Great location, safe neighborhood, close to downtown, the Woodland Park Zoo, etc.  Clean room and shared living spaces.  Modern, clean bathroom with no problems.  WiFi worked fine.  She let us use her garage to store our bicycles in while we traveled around town."
3766055,45115796,2015-08-31,39367902,Paula,"Clair welcomed me when I got to her house,
even though it was quite late, and showed me around the kitchen and other areas I could use. She was off for a trip the next morning so I didn't see her much while I was there (5 nights). That worked out well for me as I was there to visit my son. She did offer some sightseeing advice too. The house was nice and my room and bathroom were clean and comfortable. I was able to fix food if I needed to. Having use of the kitchen was a plus. It worked out very well for my needs.
"
3766055,46179094,2015-09-08,41216614,Darren,"Claire is a great host. The house is located at a very convenient location, grocery store is within a few minutes on foot, and walking to UW from the house is scenic and enjoyable. Buses going north and south are very close by, too. I highly recommend the place."
3766055,57004731,2015-12-21,35992382,Gaby,Felt like home. Claire is a great host... Highly recommend. 
3766055,57460566,2015-12-26,46727656,Laurie,Claire's house was lovely and she was a nice and gracious host. The bed was super comfortable and the room and bathroom private and very clean. It was Christmas and she gave us some lovely plum fruit rolls and chocolate candy as a surprise. Thank you Claire we had a wonderful time in Seattle and at your home.
6043482,32043778,2015-05-12,17489072,Lyda,The host canceled this reservation 31 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
1251813,8149625,2013-10-18,8120023,Matt,Katy gave great instructions and directions...and she was very responsive when I lost the information she'd already given me.  Our stay was better than we could have asked for!  I have no complaints and would definitely work with her again in the future.  
8939503,51419986,2015-10-19,8880284,Jun,"He texted me prior to my arrival with necessary information, then greeted me upon my arrival. He made sure I was well acquainted with the house.  "
8939503,52447430,2015-10-29,40747205,Somina,"Although my stay was short, I felt at home. The home was older than I expected, but that actually added to the charm. At first I thought sharing a bathroom would be a nightmare, but it really wasn't.  I also enjoyed the interaction with the other guest. 

My favorite thing about staying at Dario's house was the well stocked kitchen. I was able to make myself a huge omelette! I like to cook, so this worked out well for me. 

 Overall, a very pleasant stay."
8939503,53084359,2015-11-04,19349998,Patrick,Ethan was such a great host. All the necessities during my stay was provided. Will definitely stay there again on my next visit.
8939503,53157682,2015-11-05,14205394,Scot,"Great communication, house was easy to find and offered easy parking in an ideal location. Super comfy bed, and everything was provided, (including breakfast!). With this location I hope to visit again."
8939503,53628185,2015-11-10,44617966,Carleigh,"Room and home was just as described.  Older home in a college neighborhood, perfect for getting a feel for the university.  There were house parties down the street, it was a little loud, but by about 10 it was quiet again.  Bed was comfortable and there were plenty of options for breakfast.  The host stopped in daily to check on everyone and communication was friendly and easy through both text and email. "
8939503,53800304,2015-11-12,18279083,Cal,"While I never had a chance to meet either host, it was a very organized and easy experience. I came into town late at night / early in the morning and I was able to communicate and get in easy without waking anyone.

Bedroom was nice, simple, and comfortable. Bathrooms were clean, towels were provided. Parking was a major plus for me. There was ample quality food for breakfast to suit the pickiest taste buds.

I would definitely recommend and likely come back if I ever return to Seattle. A very professional and organized operation."
8939503,54270632,2015-11-17,18675727,Helen,"At this price point, you get exactly what you pay for. This was a basic room in a run-down but clean house in an undergrad neighborhood of UW. There are many good cheap restaurants nearby. It was easy to walk/bike to other neighborhoods or take the bus downtown.  And the well-stocked kitchen was nice. 

Things I wish I'd known:
1) The bedroom door does not have a lock. Ethan assured me that there have been no incidences, but I personally would have liked to have a lock.
2) Sound travels a lot in the house. You will hear the other guests talking or walking around the house. Someone was cleaning the house incredibly early one morning (5-6am?) and it was very hard to sleep."
8939503,54472798,2015-11-20,46492888,Jesse,Overall a good experience. The home is well kept and pretty inexpensive. There is an overwhelming amount of rules posted everywhere. (The one on the fridge dials is funny but a little aggressive). There's a lot of rooms so a lot of people coming in and out. 
8939503,55126859,2015-11-28,45110413,Jian,.
8939503,55547175,2015-12-01,217354,Jennifer,Had a great stay! Hosts were very responsive and helpful in making sure everything went smoothly. It was really cold in Seattle the night I stayed there and they had very thoughtfully warmed up the room with a heater so it was cozy and comfortable when I got there. Thanks!
8939503,55632808,2015-12-03,39429872,Stephanie,Incredibly comfortable bed! Bedroom and bathroom were very clean. Dario's host Ethan was very helpful and clear with communication to help with arrival and other logistics coordinating my stay. Also close to the UW and UW Medical Center campus.
8939503,55832340,2015-12-06,6959152,Francisco,"Dario and Ethan run a house for AirBNB guests. I did not meet either of them, but Ethan was very responsive through messaging. The house is clean and well decorated. The room is spacious and the bed is large and very comfortable. There is a walk-in closet, which was useful for hanging my suits. The house is located near UW, which is crawling with students (the street outside is mostly quiet, except one Thursday evening the occasional loud, drunk student fumbled their way down the street). The location is ideal for those who have business at UW, and is also a close Uber/Lyft ride to hip neighborhoods like Fremont, Ballard, and Capitol Hill (~$10-15 ride). Overall I would stay again next time I'm in Seattle."
8939503,56119871,2015-12-09,27621008,Catherine & Kyle,The host reached out to me to make sure my arrival was seamless. The house and the neughborhood were as described and in excellent condition. 
8939503,56421032,2015-12-13,44920902,Mike,"Great experience- cozy room, everything well thought out, good breakfast options, parking spot available. Felt welcome and had my questions about the neighborhood answered. Would stay here again thanks! "
8524565,50251273,2015-10-10,29268699,Marta,"We had a wonderful stay at Matthew's place. Everything was as described and as shown in the pictures. Also, communication with him was great and he was always willing to make our stay better and more comfortable. Thank you for everything!! We will definitely stay here again if we come back to Portland. "
8524565,50393274,2015-10-11,45672993,Rob,Excellent hosts!  Matt and Jill are very easy going and welcoming.  We really enjoyed our stay!
8524565,50720571,2015-10-13,46020044,Taylor,This place was seriously incredible. I feel like we won the Airbnb lottery. We had plenty of space for three people in our room and we had a bathroom all to ourselves! The hosts were very accommodating and we had a great time hanging out with Jill and the dogs. It was very close to Seattle and in a beautiful neighborhood. Our only regret is that we didn't book it for the rest of our trip!
8524565,53302398,2015-11-07,47994523,Raedene,Great place to stay in Seattle. The room was nice and the location was good. Easy access to transit and in a nice area. 
8524565,53446541,2015-11-08,33693114,Francisca,"We stayed one night with Matt and Jill and had a great experience. They were incredibly friendly and accommodating during our entire (website hidden), Cash, and Diggs are the best pets ever! We were also offered red velvet cake which we quickly devoured :) Next time we are in Seattle we hope to stay with them again! "
8524565,53587915,2015-11-09,48442813,Sarah,This was my first Air B&B experience and I am so happy I chose to stay with Jill and Matt. Their pets welcomed me when I arrived and I felt immediately at home. Matt and Jill have really neat stories about traveling the world and were a joy to chat with. The room was a good size and the attached bathroom made it easy to have privacy and not have to worry about a bathroom schedule. The Wifi was easy to access and the bed was very comfortable. I highly recommend this room!
8524565,56057632,2015-12-08,19928348,Allison,"We stayed with Matt and Jill while we were hunting for an apartment for our upcoming relocation to the area. They are THE perfect hosts. Really friendly, helpful and accommodating. Everything was totally thought of from the shampoo and body wash in the bathroom to the extra blankets. The bed was so comfortable which made it hard for us to get up in the mornings. : ) The pets, Bo, Cash, and Diggs (cat) were all so sweet! Not to mention, great location for accessing UW, North Seattle and easy access to downtown. "
8524565,56335243,2015-12-12,16646930,Jennah,Matthew and Jill are very sweet and fast in response. The room is clean and comfy. The pets are very quiet and friendly. Thanks for receiving us!
8524565,57723882,2015-12-28,19198582,Daniel,Awesome room.  It had everything you need as a traveler. The hosts are really nice. So are the pets. I also get an electric heater to keep warm. Fairly  close to the highways.
8524565,58066851,2015-12-31,35917663,Henry,Very clean private suite. Exceedingly comfortable mattress. The pets bring a unique touch to the experience.
262764,49168782,2015-10-01,23789142,Matthew,The Fremont Farmhouse is in a quiet neighborhood close to local restaurants and bars. If you don't mind cats - it's a lovely house to stay in with all the essential amenities. Rachel is super responsive and ontop of organizing arrivals and departures.
262764,52244581,2015-10-27,11186740,Sarah,"My family and I had a wonderful stay at Rachel's home. My husband and I have a newborn and two year old and the space was perfect for them!  The separate kids room was right across the hall from the master bedroom making nighttime check-ins less scary for my two year old.  There was lots of extra space in the master bedroom for me to set up a bed for my newborn with me.  The kids toys that were in the home were a life saver.  My two year old had an absolute blast!  The in house cats were sweet and an added treat for my family.  Beds were comfortable and bedding was lovely.  The shower was possibly in the process of being refreshed? Induction stove was great to cook with!

The neighborhood was great!  Lots to walk to and several close parks to walk to for kids.  A reminder to out of towners; bars aren't required to serve food therefore a kid friendly bar may just be that.  A good place to grab a tasty beer.  

Rachel and her family were so sweet and made us feel like we were staying in a home away from home.  Thanks again Rachel!"
262764,53014433,2015-11-03,13067438,Peter,I got everything I hope and then more house is very fun an Cozy around walking distance to restaurants bar fun things to do we had a great weekend all happy people
262764,53608087,2015-11-10,22205424,Starrina,"Cozy small home in great location.
Walk to shops, restaurants etc.
Close to Green Lake and easy access to downtown.
Hosts are welcoming and very helpful.
Cats on premises."
262764,57517722,2015-12-27,15336284,Atze,"Contact with Rachel was easy and quick. She shared a lot of information and is very accessible. We liked the house a lot, in particular the indoor cats :-). Fremont is a very nice area and restaurants, bars, sunday market are really close by (3-5 min walk). The house is uphill from Fremont centre in a quiet street and easily reachable from the highways. About 3-5 mins by car there are supermarkets like Safeway and Fred Meyers and gas stations. There is a more expensive high quality food market in the centre of Fremont.
Rachel kindly provided a parking pass for our rental car. The pictures show 2 childrens beds. In reality these are now full size 1 person beds. The house has a lot of facilities, but we missed a dish washer. 
We definitely recommend visiting Theo Chocolate in Fremont!
We also went to the Boeing factory tour and downtown Seattle. And we made a nice 2.5 hr walk in Discovery Park to the lighthouse and back. "
6706377,36313816,2015-06-27,2557714,Izhak,We had a great stay the place. It was clean and tidy and everything was great.The street barking was easy and it's a good place set up for short or long stay.
6706377,36583259,2015-06-29,35043956,Kellie,It was a cute place. At first when I heard we had to enter through the back i thought it would like some sort of basement but I was wrong it a little house at the back that was totally quiet cause the house was on a big street. Overall I will give the place a 9/10. The reason why I minus 1 point is because when we entered it was not 100% clean there were some dust bunnies and hair on the bed/pillows. The other reason are the stairs. They were very steep and all of us tripped on them at least once. So it would be awesome if u add a step in every existing step u have. Other than that we loved the place.
6706377,37080487,2015-07-04,35597559,Theresa,"The hosts were very welcoming and available to answer any questions that we had.
The cottage was exactly as described and pictured. Only thing I'd recommend adding is a small note about the difficulty of getting up/down the ladder to the loft. 
Unfortunately, I chose to come visit the city during a heat wave. There were a few fans, which provided a small reprieve, but no AC.
The neighborhood was very diverse, easily accessible to the busses, and felt safe. It was also not too hilly of an area compared to some other parts of town, so that made it easier to walk/run around, especially in the heat."
6706377,41836852,2015-08-09,866584,Brandon  + Laurel,"Check-in and communication was fantastic, and simple. The space was just as listed and very clean. All around a great experience."
6706377,42370490,2015-08-12,39041724,Lisalinn,The host canceled this reservation 14 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
6706377,44030078,2015-08-23,15123784,Jörg,"The communication was very easy and the Location in the backfront of the street made it very quite. The house was clean and we found everything as described. So finally, just little things can be optimized, as a working describtion for the way from Seatac Airport to the house via public transportation, and it is very easy! Thanks a lot to you! Jörg and Ricarda"
5863558,36675128,2015-06-30,32348224,Laura,"Haotian was very open and welcoming. The first night my dad, Haotian, and I went to a ramen noodle restaurant about a 2 minute walk from the house. This really helped us get a sense of the area. Next to the ramen noodle restaurant is a very nice cafe called the Jewel Box Cafe. There is a mall about a 3 minute walk from the house as well as a grocery store about 3 blocks from the house which was very convenient. 
After eating at the ramen noodle restaurant (which was very good, I recommend you try it out) Haotian walked us over to a bus station where you can get on a bus that goes directly downtown (it literally gets on the freeway and goes straight downtown, no stops). 
The house is so bright and just has a good vibe about it. Skylights galore, updated bathroom and kitchen, the backyard is breathtakingly gorgeous with a water feature and fish. The room itself has a lock on the door so you know your belongings are always secure. The bed is either a king or queen (I'm not good at determining either/or) and you have a huge closet as well as a desk. 
Haotian was so helpful in getting me acquainted to the city. I even met some of his friends and they were all very friendly and welcoming.  "
5863558,42452754,2015-08-13,15938417,Eric,Haitian was an awesome host! Was amazingly accommodating and the location was great. There's a giant mall with tons of shipping and places to eat. You can also take the bus directly to downtown. My girlfriend and I had a great experience staying at his home.
5863558,45284077,2015-09-01,34871635,Leonardo,"Haotian and his rommie Arjun are great guys, its a great place with all the things you need and be as close as your own home.
Arjun knows a lot of Indian food and he could gladly give you recipes, Haotian knows a lot about coffee and don't hesitate to reach him for explanation on all his coffee makers and coffee grains from a lot of countries.
The place is greatly located next to North Gate mall, 41 bus takes you downtown in 20 minutes and they come every 5-10 minutes at the corner of house. "
7235573,40016165,2015-07-27,37413410,Patrick,"Jason was super helpful and detailed about helping us check into his place. He is in hands down the best location in Seattle so we had an amazing time and slept really well. His place was clean, and left detailed instructions about wifi, laundry ect. in case we needed to use any amenities. Will for sure look to stay here next time I am in the area. Thanks Jason! "
7235573,40413509,2015-07-30,18354679,Chris,"Jason was super accommodating for a last minute booking.  Making parking spaces available to me in case needed.  
Since I was there for a whopping 15 hours, he even gave me a break on the normal cleaning fee!"
7235573,41814918,2015-08-09,35735914,Manuel,"Jason made both arriving and departing easy. He also responded promptly to my message asking him a question during our stay. We had no problems during our stay.

This place is in a nice location and has a view of the Space Needle and Downtown! Everything you need is within walking distance and even the walk to Seattle Center is only about 45 minutes.

I would definitely recommend it and would stay there again should I ever return to the area.

Thanks Jason!"
7235573,42343248,2015-08-12,40533750,Ian,"A comfortable apartment and a great location. Jason was very helpful, and answered all of my questions promptly. No complaints, and would definitely consider staying there again. "
7235573,45127127,2015-08-31,17462130,Kirk,"This is a charming apartment in a great location in Seattle.  It is close enough to walk downtown or adjacent to a bus stop to ride downtown.  It is a short walk to Volunteer Park which has jogging trails and a water tower with great views of the city.  It is also a short walk to many restaurants, bars, coffee shops, and a grocery store (the apartment is fully equipped for cooking meals on site).  The sunset view behind the building was amazing.  The apartment had everything we needed and was in a corner location for pleasant evening breeze.  Jason made finding a key and accessing the apartment easy and he was responsive to every email.  We did not meet him in person but he checked in with us to make sure we had everything we needed."
7235573,48479315,2015-09-26,3577928,Samuel,"Jason's apartment was incredibly charming and perfect for our stay. The apartment was in spotless condition and had great amenities for guests, while still keeping his true style. Jason was very communicative leading up to and during the stay.

Fantastic interior, host and location - highly recommended! "
7235573,48850292,2015-09-28,42296531,Zhe,"Jason is a great host and very attentive, also helped he had a local guide to the area on his profile. The property is very comfortable and charming and in a convenient neighbourhood for going downtown. Overall, a great experience. "
7235573,51222163,2015-10-18,6728086,Daniel,"Although I didn't meet Jason, he was very accommodating and quick to respond to any messages. He was also quite gracious when I goofed and ""returned"" the key incorrectly.

The apartment is in an excellent location- just a few blocks from some of the best foods and drinks in Seattle. Despite this proximity, it was surprisingly quiet at night, and Bellevue Ave is overall a sleepy street.

The apartment itself was clean and equipped with snacks, which was much appreciated.

Also, parking spot is included! Parking is incredibly difficult to find in Capitol Hill, so knowing I wouldn't have to circle blocks endlessly searching each evening was a great comfort.

Would definitely stay here again."
7561272,41032813,2015-08-03,20475769,Kelly & Colton,"We had a great stay in Dario's French Country Room.  We arrived late due to our late flight from Texas, but Dario and his roommate were very accommodating and kind.  Dario's home is beautiful, quiet, clean, and very convenient to everything in the University District. "
7561272,41500422,2015-08-07,18969907,Deanna,"The ""French Country Room w/ Breakfast"" was a pleasant place to stay in Seattle. It matches the description of the room and the house. The house was clean and comfortable. It is close to the University, with easy access to restaurants and public transportation. My interactions with other guests were minimal as I was out of the house for work until the late evening. However, people were considerate and respectful. It was a great place to come and go and feel at home."
7561272,41894784,2015-08-09,40540482,Sherryl,We had a great stay in the French Country Room. It's clean and comfy. The common areas are well maintained. Great location in the University District

7561272,46219779,2015-09-08,42851470,Janine,"My traveling partner and I had an overall great experience at Dario's the keypad entry to the house made it very easy to arrive and depart as needed, especially on our first day when we didn't know when we would arrive. The house was very clean and cozy. Everything was well labeled and welcoming. Our second night there were a few loud noises from other guests which was disruptive. No key to the room or option to lock it when we left the house was not very nice. "
7561272,47006882,2015-09-14,28925820,Tanay,I had a great experience. The room was beautiful with all the amenities I needed. Loved it. I never knew my first experience of a Airbnb accomodation would be this great! Thank you Dario!

Although I was grunging to a class every day for a week, I felt well cared for when I got ""home"".  

Thank you!"
7561272,52177117,2015-10-26,46988423,Linda,I came in late and everything was as I had been told in my intinerary. The room was ready and inviting and I had a wonderful stay! There was food aplenty for breakfast in the kitchen and plenty of space to just relax.
7561272,52902877,2015-11-02,13195927,Emily,The room was comfy and the house was in a great spot of town. Easy and convenient way to get to see Seattle :)

There are many restaurants and shops on campus, and it is very convenient to take bus71/72/73 to go to downtown. I strongly recommend Dario' rooms to all the tourists!:)"

Check-in was the easiest out of any place I've been to. The house is in a quiet neighborhood near UW and within walking distance of bus stops and restaurants. Breakfast was included with this stay and there were more options than most of the hotels I've stayed at! A+ all around."
7561272,56056899,2015-12-08,1136742,Teresa,"I didn't meet Dario but I did feel welcome from his rep, Ethan. I loved the room (red is my favorite color). Everything was clean and open. Other guests were quiet. There was plenty of food available to us in the kitchen. The location was EXACTLy what I wanted, near U of Washington and walking distance from a cool park, Ravenna, and good restaurants. Also I called Dario for info about using the computer/printer there, and he was quite willing to help. I thoroughly enjoyed my stay and recommend it especially for anyone interested in exploring the U of W area.
"
7561272,56282624,2015-12-11,23467863,Ben,"The setup was great--key code to get in the house, everything in the kitchen is well-labeled, so I could check myself in and out without any issue.

The room was clean and spacious, a really nice closet to store things as well. Bed was super-comfortable. Wifi was fast! 

And best of all, when I left behind a valued item, I was able to retrieve it with no issues 5 days later. Thanks so much guys!!

There were a few things not mentioned in the description that are worth mentioning, as they may trouble some guests (not me, I slept great!). 

The facilities were a bit messier than I've typically experienced, and may bother some guests (didn't bother me at all!). More than half the kitchen table was filled with towels, the kitchen wasn't the cleanest, and the common rooms weren't as organized or picked up as I've experienced at other places (~7 AirBNB experiences so far!), and remained that way during my stay.

In the room itself, the window above the bed was retracted by a rotating lever that was disconnected; with high winds it was really hard to lock the window closed to stop the clattering. And there were one or two small issues (burn marks?) with the rug that might bother some people. Didn't bother me at all.
"
7561272,56561195,2015-12-14,35468023,Fan,"Excellent location close to numerous restaurants in the University of Washington area(5-15 min walk).  Also close to busses that go downtown(30 min bus ride).  The home itself is an older home in an older neighborhood.  Furnishings were perfectly pleasant.  Various breakfast foods were provided, which was quite nice.  Bread, bagels, cereal, eggs, juice, apples, oranges, etc.  Overall excellent for the price and my purposes!"
7561272,56754127,2015-12-17,47713272,Elizabeth,"Convenient spot, walking distance to cafes, shops, pharmacy, etc. Only stayed for one night but this room was adequate for my needs. Tidy bedroom and bathroom, and Dario was kind enough to provide snacks for breakfast. Room located on second floor in a house with multiple AirBnB rooms sharing the bathroom and other guests coming and going, so that is a consideration for some. I met Dario on my way out, he seemed friendly. "
5041669,27954776,2015-03-15,9402214,Kerry,"Had a constructive stay at this condo in the Maple Leaf neighborhood of Seattle. I flew to Seattle to help friends get their home ready for their 1st baby and this condo was walking distance to their home.

Mercy Gregorio was an exceptional host and made every effort to make my experience a good one. She even left a baby shower to meet with a Comcast tech (on a Saturday) to fix my WiFi...lot of babies being born in Seattle!!!

Anyway, I will be using this condo in September to meet the new baby."
5041669,28792145,2015-03-30,27376609,Nancy,"Mercy made everything easy, the rental was clean and had many conveniences.  Easy drive to downtown Seattle, close walk or drive to restaurants, malls and grocery stores. Thank you!
"
5041669,32605265,2015-05-19,716878,Amber,"I booked this condo for my in-laws visiting Seattle. It is moderately close to everything in town and the parking space was certainly a plus. The condo was very spacious and clean. If there are people living there regularly you cannot tell, which is a very attractive feature because it is more like staying at a hotel than a residence. My in-laws plan to book this listing every time they visit if it is available. Many Thanks Mercy! "
5041669,45256472,2015-09-01,36299245,Amy,"My party for Pax Prime 2015 have a wonderful stay here.  The residence was super clean, well organized, and there were so many extra accommodations provided it felt like I over packed.  This place was seriously a home away from home and I hope that this place becomes a top pick for Air BnB for Seattle.  In addition the place of stay is close to many fine restaurants, shopping areas, and grocery!  Lastly, when local power was cut off during a storm, Mercy called me right away to see if my party and I were safe and okay, and if there was anything important that needed to be attended to since we were out.  Not many people would care that much but Mercy does.  5/5... Better yet 6/5  stars!"
5041669,54401878,2015-11-19,26923849,Jisun,Mercy's condo was very comfortable and clean; felt like home away from home!  She was very helpful and responsive.
8923774,54425918,2015-11-19,14611369,Kristin,"This apartment was perfect for my needs. It is in a sweet neighborhood with great areas to go walking, but also close to the interstate. The house is adorable and the apartment very tastefully decorated and comfortable... like a little retreat! Very quiet and private. Molly is a wonderful host. She was quick to respond to inquiries, responsive to requests, and very friendly. I wanted to steal her dog, Lucy was such a sweetie! I definitely plan on staying here again when I next return to Seattle, you can't get a hotel in this city anywhere close to this quality for this price."
8923774,54676283,2015-11-22,9728260,Nathan,"The biggest impressions of our stay at Molly's can be summed up in two words; perfect and professional. 

It was more cozy to see in person, and had the most well stocked kitchen I've ever come across on AirBnB. 

The suite itself was meticulously taken care of, and very modern. Smart and spacious layout, with plenty of outlets to conveniently charge devices. 

Communication was top notch. Very clear, informative, and above all, welcoming. Checking in and out a breeze. We didn't miss a beat in our busy schedule.

Attention to detail and the effort to ensure our comfort was highlighted with transit passes and a cute bar of ""emergency"" chocolate.

Overall 5/5 stars for a suite that exceeds high end hotel standards."
8923774,55169108,2015-11-28,2648930,Karl,Great place to stay. Lots of amenities. Super location.  Very clean. Kitchen was well equipped.  Molly was very responsive and easy to work with.  Will definitely reserve on our next trip!
8923774,56744147,2015-12-17,12128757,Christopher,"Molly was a fantastic host! She was so accommodating and made our stay a delight. The space was also fantastic. It was clean, spacious and tastefully decorated. The comfortable king bed also made for a most enjoyable stay."
4564730,23232854,2014-11-25,24018179,Loyd,"Amanda was welcoming and very helpful. She met us at the door  and showed us around the apartment. She told us about the area, provided us with a map and a wonderful basket of welcoming goodies. The apartment was quiet, clean and spacious, the bed was comfortable and inviting; it was just what we needed. We had family obligations in the area so the location was especially important."
4564730,23344732,2014-11-29,3977334,Dustin,"Amanda and Rick are great! Friendly, hospitable and quick to respond to any inquiries. This place is a great deal with off street parking and a nice large living space. Although I only spent two nights, there is a full kitchen and wifi, I couldn't be happier with my choice to stay and would recommend it to others. "
4564730,23471399,2014-12-01,12164680,Michael,"What a find!!! If you're in Seattle, you have to stay here.  It's really homely, private and cool.  Amanda is the best!  If you're just looking to relax you've got a warm living room with a Netflix-ed up TV, and if you're looking to head out, it's a 5 min walk to anything.  House was warm, cozy and inviting.  Wish I'd stayed longer!  Don't go to some lousy hotel that costs way more, stay here!  It'll make your trip."
4564730,23541817,2014-12-03,7709010,Leticia,"I booked Amanda's home very last minute it was the best idea ever! Amanda's place is big, clean, and super cozy! She was so sweet  and was very helpful at helping me get settled in, she even gave me the heads up on cool places to go a grab a drink! Her place isn't to far from downtown, it was a 15-20 minute drive for me, I wish I would've stayed longer with Amanda, her place is the perfect place to get a good sleep after a day of expiring beautiful Seattle! I really look forward to staying with her again on my next trip to Seattle"
4564730,23856477,2014-12-12,5101751,Olivia And William,"Amanda was a perfect host- she was even kind enough to send us somethings we forgot via mail... no questions asked.  Place was clean, warm and somewhere we are going to stay again when back in Seattle."
4564730,24304208,2014-12-25,5868938,Cindy,"I so enjoyed my stay here! It was everything I hoped it would be and more. The apartment was large, very comfortable and welcoming. The beds were comfortable and there was more than enough blankets and pillows. The television had a great assortment of options including Netflix, Hulu, Plex and many, many more. The kitchen was stocked with all the pots,pans, dishes, silverware and cooking utensils you need to cook up a nice meal and I was so touched to arrive and find some breakfast essentials like orange juice, English Muffins, butter, tea, coffee and creamer waiting for me. Also, the host was so kind to leave flowers and a basket of assorted goodies to welcome me. I am planning to stay here again when I come to Seattle to visit family. It totally felt like a home away from home!"
4564730,24879516,2015-01-03,23528057,Mingya,"Amanda is a pretty nice person. Her house is warm, clean and cozy. My cousin and I had a really good trip there. And the location of this house made out trip easier. I recommend this house to all of (website hidden): there is a Excellent Thai restaurant near Amanda's house called Buddha Ruksa. "
4564730,25286368,2015-01-11,25328582,Cody,"This was our first Airbnb experience and it was great.  As we arrived, Amanda greeted us at the door to show us around the house.   She was very inviting.  Nice quiet neighborhood and easy to get to.  Amanda had toys and books for our daughters to enjoy and keep them busy.   Thank you Amanda for sharing your home with us, We had a great trip visiting our family in West Seattle.  Jenny and Cody"
4564730,25587917,2015-01-19,21732308,Ben,Had a great time! Super nice little place and it's really close to trader joes and many other shops and places to eat
4564730,27248604,2015-03-01,24594131,David,"We stayed with Amanda the entire month of February. She was easy to communicate with and immediately dealt with the few minor issues which cropped up during such an extended stay. The apartment is warm, clean, comfortable, and much quieter than a hotel. We arrived in the evening so she had left us a starter kit of things for snacks that night and breakfast the next morning. It's a block to Trader Joe's and three blocks to a large QFC supermarket. It's easy walking distance to the many shops, coffee shops, and restaurants along California Avenue. We had a car which we parked in the driveway next to our separate entrance. The apartment is closer to downtown than the map suggests. There are two highways which lead into and through downtown, so almost nothing we wanted to do was more than 15 minutes away. Even at rush-hour it was only a half hour from the University District on the north side of town. A YMCA 2 blocks away allows use of its gym on a daily basis, but I preferred a larger gym 11 minutes south which also allows drop-ins. We streamed video from our Slingbox at home through the Roku 2 to the TV, as well as watching Netflix and Amazon Prime video on Amanda's account. Amanda was warm and pleasant. We plan to stay with her when we are in Seattle again."
4564730,28794439,2015-03-30,27432475,Judy,"The apartment was exactly as described. It was comfortable, quiet, and close to everything! Amanda was a good host - the welcome basket and breakfast items were sweet! The only complaint is that the shower is a little small. Overall a wonderful experience."
4564730,29295383,2015-04-06,28655540,Claudine,"We had a wonderful time staying at Amanda's place.  We felt very welcome, with fresh flowers and snacks when we arrived; the apartment was nice and clean, located in a great neighborhood (Trader Joes a block away, amazing Thai restaurant just down the street, yet very quiet and private); with fast and easy access to downtown Seattle via 99 North.  Much better than a hotel! "
4564730,29927338,2015-04-14,20952241,Marty,"Amanda met us as we drove up to the apartment and recommended a great Thai restaurant for lunch! We were able to park off the road and were 10 minutes away from my son's house. The apartment was clean and quiet and comfortable, and Amanda had even left us a basket of goodies. We had a great stay in West Seattle!
Marty Gephart"
4564730,31206649,2015-05-03,113585,Saro,"This apartment was great.  In a great neighborhood just a few minutes (about 7 minutes without traffic) from downtown and a stone's throw from a lot of great eateries and restaurants.  

Amanda was a great host.  She's very warm and quick to respond and easy to work with.  Will definitely stay here again when i'm back in Seattle."
4564730,32752628,2015-05-21,1420456,Zack,"The charming West Seattle apartment was just that, and Amanda is an excellent host. She was responsive and quick to offer help in just about every way one would expect. 

There was a nice welcoming basket in case too, and that part was unexpected. In case of a particularly difficult bout of travel, not at all rare these days, walking into a spacious well appointed room with a friendly host is just about all one can ask for.

Also, it's very much within walking distance of West Seattle's commercial center. "
4564730,33927585,2015-06-02,7913244,Mario,"If I were to review our experience, a lot of it would rely on Amanda, the hostess we worked with.  We went to Seattle for the birth of a grandson and stayed in this place while we were there.  As soon as we walked in, she was there to welcome us and show us around.   The place was decorated with flowers and there were breakfast foods and condiments in the fridge- very welcoming!!  It was like staying at a friend's place, where we didn't have to go out and buy tea or condiments - they were all right there.  It is a downstairs rental, so you can hear some noise from above, but we knew that going in.  I think the biggest plus was the large living room with the TV that had access to Netflix and Hulu - after a long day we could come home and ""veg"" like we did at home.  We would stay here again- it was a positive experience."
4564730,34540265,2015-06-09,3550356,Jeanette,"The host left us some snacks and breakfast items, plus coffee and
a bottle of wine.  Very nice touch to make us feel welcome.

The apartment was as presented on Airbnb website.  The neighborhood was know to us before so we knew we were staying in a good place.  We would stay here again.   We have been using Airbnb
for about 4 years and have never been disappointed.

Jeanette and Tony chavez"
4564730,35092089,2015-06-15,7125425,Bruce,"We had a perfect vacation in Seattle thanks to the wonderful comfort of Amanda's apartment.  We were greeted at the private driveway by Amanda, who then showed us around and made us feel right at home immediately.  She had a beautiful welcome basket and fresh flowers awaiting.  The apartment was immaculate and included all the needed components for a couple who had traveled far from home to visit Seattle.  We will not hesitate to stay there again, and want to thank Amanda for her hospitality and attention to detail."
4564730,35569234,2015-06-20,4847519,Mandy,I had a great stay! The space is comfy and clean. The location is great for West Seattle and is right off the bridge which was great for commuting. There was a little temperature issue I was having but Amanda and Rick were fast to resolve it! The size of the apartment was bigger than I thought and I felt very safe. 
4564730,36369531,2015-06-28,4026821,Nancy,"Amanda's place is very comfortable, spacious and well located in West Seattle - a perfect base for attending our niece's wedding!  Amanda was very friendly, helpful and we appreciated the nice snacks that she provided."
4564730,36876358,2015-07-02,26390324,Tony,"Host Amanda made us feel very welcome at her place. Her son played with our kids too... a bonus. Amanda went on to provide us with suggestions for our travel including sites to visit, eateries and special local events. Her place is as described; comfortable and quiet. "
4564730,37840081,2015-07-11,4624108,Todd,"We had an absolutely wonderful time staying at Amanda's Apartment while visiting West Seattle. It was the perfect location- within easy walking distance to several restaurants, pubs, grocery stores and parks- and Amanda went out of her way as a host to ensure our comfort. Traveling with our 19 month old daughter, the large back yard and available children's toys were a daily joy for our child, providing additional comforts for her during our visit.  Amanda had also left us a thoughtful welcome basket as well as a few fresh breakfast items with which to begin our holiday. The apartment was spacious, clean and comfortable, and we would absolutely return or recommend the property to friends. A great place for couples traveling with a young child. Thanks Amanda!"
4564730,38498630,2015-07-16,33684359,Danielle,This is a cute little apartment in West Seattle.  The neighborhood is great and has many little shops and restaurants just a short walk away.  Amanda was very nice to us.  She left us a little basket of snacks for our arrival.
4564730,39738623,2015-07-26,14399820,Larry,"Amanda was very nice and even supplied breakfast food, snacks, and a bottle of wine to welcome us.  This was a convenient location for us for our visit with our son and his family, who also live in West Seattle."
4564730,43746998,2015-08-22,2146158,Betsy,"Amanda's place was quiet, safe, comfortable and, by Seattle standards, very roomy.  Amanda was a perfect host: there to welcome us and nearby if we needed her, but otherwise not imposing. She had lots of information about things to do and transit and the apartment is very close to both transit and amenities. We were there for 2 weeks and enjoyed the whole time. We'll look forward to returning."
4564730,46692968,2015-09-13,24594131,David,"We’re repeat visitors.  The location is very convenient to public transportation, and a short walk to West Seattle’s best restaurants.  The apartment is roomy, the kitchen has all the necessary things.  And Amanda is a gracious host."
3293438,14214611,2014-06-14,10594987,Joann,"This place is so perfect. Close in to all Seattle attractions, private upstairs entrance. Great value for the price! The guests are a great blend of accommodating and allowing you privacy. The place itself has every amenity of a four star hotel with more style and homeyness. I never felt more pampered. Great bed, clean without being sterile. 

My first good Airbnb experience since coming back to the States and I am happy to say I am a fan again. Thanks so much Paul and John! I will stay again!"
3293438,14326851,2014-06-16,8775066,Christopher,"Our experience in Paul's 1BR was fantastic. The space offers an abundance of privacy and is obviously well cared for - plenty of space for relaxing after a long day. What really elevated our experience was the amazing hospitality that we received during our stay. Delicious and fresh breakfast and snacks were already stocked in the room and Paul was very accommodating of our schedule and needs. Our biggest regret during our trip to Seattle was that we were so busy we weren't able to enjoy the room more!

The house is centrally located and was an easy 20-30 minute walk to downtown. Bus access was abundant and direct to almost all areas of the city. I would enthusiastically recommend Paul's listing to anyone looking to visit Seattle. "
3293438,14455637,2014-06-19,8641921,Justin,"John and Paul were excellent hosts and I had a wonderful time in their home. The space is very private with a comfortable bed and roomy living area with big couches and breakfast area. Their hospitality was unmatched -- delicious breakfast items were laid out every day, towels changed, tons of information on Seattle both in guidebooks and personal recommendations.

I was able to easily park my car in the street without worrying about time limits or fees, and there are several nearby bus lines to downtown. Although I didn't have time to use it, the hot tub also looked quite nice. I can definitely recommend their place to anyone looking for a great time in Seattle."
3293438,14991063,2014-06-30,16287592,Margarita,"I'm so glad to have found such a cozy apartment. Paul and John are wonderful hosts and were always caring about our needs. This residence has a great location in a quiet neighborhood, nearby the cute Douglas Truth Library. Several bus lines, leading in all directions of Seattle. Espacially the 27 to Downtown takes max 15 minutes to the city center. The rooms are very comfortably furnished, including a full fridge that offers a great breakfast to start the day. I did'nt miss anything during my stay but now I will definitely miss the kindness and hospitality of John and Paul.

A great ""Dankeschön"" from Germany! "
3293438,15158694,2014-07-03,4530669,Reid,"My wife and I stayed in Paul and John's wonderful apartment for two nights. They were great hosts and the private space on the second floor of their home was very comfortable, clean and nicely decorated. The fridge was well stocked with food for breakfast and snacks. It was unusually warm in Seattle during our visit and Paul & John made sure to install an air conditioner before we arrived so that we'd be cool and comfortable. The residential neighborhood was nice & quiet and convenient to all of the Seattle sights. This was our first Airbnb experience and it couldn't have been any better!"
3293438,15231607,2014-07-05,16915112,Suzelle,"John and Paul were wonderful hosts, and their home was lovely. I particularity liked the greenery and hot tub! The neighborhood was also quite nice, and just a few short blocks from the bus stop. The listing more than met our expectations, i.e., John and Paul really went above and beyond to make us feel welcome. "
3293438,15428052,2014-07-08,6670428,James,"This is the third time I have used Airbnb (second in Seattle) and it's going to be very hard to top this past trip. My friend who stayed with me couldn't stop talking about how great this place was. Paul and John were very pleasant to deal before, during, and after my stay. I would definitely book again for how they treated me, alone! The neighborhood is GREAT and very quiet. There was plenty of street parking. Downtown Seattle is a quick drive away. I wish I was able to enjoy the place more because of how charming the place is. I can tell they put in a lot of time into decorating the place and you will definitely (email hidden)d miss it. You are definitely in a private Oasis. Towels (and robes) were provided and replenished, bathroom was stocked with necessities (soaps, shampoo, conditioner), the TV had Netflix, a continental breakfast was provided (better than hotels), a mini fridge, microwave, toaster, two long couches in the living room, an iron and ironing board, AC in the bedroom, and more (I'm rambling now). When I come back to Seattle, they will be the first people I check out. Thanks Paul and John!"
3293438,15505143,2014-07-10,7963006,De-Laine,"Paul's place was perfect!  At the end of a couple weeks of travelling, the apt. was a great place to relax.  John and Paul were extremely friendly hosts, and the assortment of breakfast supplies was quite generous.  With take-out from Central Pizza a couple of blocks away, we couldn't have asked for anything more!  "
3293438,15703290,2014-07-14,1869940,Mike,Very nice place to stay. 2nd floor appartment is nicely furnished and has everything you might need for a pleasant stay including decent supply of food items in the fridge.  Easy access to everything if you have a car.  Paul is the kind of host that provides all you need and never bothers you. I will stay there again given a chance
3293438,15874777,2014-07-17,1370167,Branden,"We had a great experience with Paul and John. As soon as we arrived, they asked where we were going and offered us a lift. They told us all about the neighborhood, as well as themselves. They were friendly, accommodating and welcoming, but also let us do our own thing. On our last day, they even drove us to the train station (even though we'd forgotten to ask ahead of time!). 


The space is really nice, with interesting art and lots of room. There's a mini fridge that they kept stocked with milk, juice, yogurt, fruit, breads and bubbly water. There was also cereal, tea, coffee (along with a coffeepot), a toaster and a microwave. The bedroom and bathroom were perfect for two people. Cozy, but not cramped. It's obvious that they've spent a lot of time making this space comfortable for guests. They also provided an impressive collection of information about Seattle ready, with recommendations on everything from food to sights to see (as well as how to get there!). 


This was everything we'd hoped for and more. We definitely recommend staying with Paul and John. In fact, when we return to Seattle, we hope to stay with them again! "
3293438,15964594,2014-07-19,93428,Maren & Rupert,"Jon and Paul were absolutely wonderful hosts.  Lovely and helpful in every interaction.  Their home is full of color, warmth, and beautiful art.  The apartment was very private, clean, and comfortable.  Breakfasts was fresh, mostly local food.  Very close to down town and easy to travel to and from on public transportation.  
If you stay, highly reccomend walking down the street for AMAZING fried chicken.  "
3293438,16105742,2014-07-22,16023487,John,"The private, upstairs apartment was absolutely wonderful.  It was very comfortable and completely outfitted with every amenity possible.  The refrigerator was filled with milk, juice, yogurt, granola bars, toast, bagels, and the list could go on.  The location was very convenient to downtown via a five minute drive down Yesler or a short bus ride on one of four routes within a block of the house.  John and Paul were extremely friendly and accommodating, picking us up and dropping us off at the train station at the start and end of our stay.  This was truly a great place to stay and  I will definitely try to book here again upon returning to Seattle!"
3293438,16277394,2014-07-24,4514077,Laura,"Lovely apartment, tastefully decorated and impeccable. Our hosts were gracious and helpful will stay again."
3293438,16480840,2014-07-28,6312436,Bruce,"John and Paul made us feel very welcome! We had a very nice time staying in their sweet apartment upstairs. Everything was clean as a whistle! There was a whole breakfast in the fridge! Nice coffee, etc.The neighborhood was quiet and peaceful. We were very happy to be near our son during his time getting married! Took us 15 minutes to get to his home on Bainbridge Island! We would definitely want to stay here again when we visit the Seattle area!"
3293438,16625902,2014-07-30,1663083,Zachary,"We really enjoyed our time at Paul's house. The top floor apartment was even nicer and more spacious than the pictures, and Paul really has gone out of his way to leave a really great assortment of guide books, maps, robes, soaps and delicious foods and snacks in the half size refrigerator/kitchenette. Everything was clean and neat which we appreciated. It really made us feel at home and we really enjoyed our short time here. Paul was out of town the two days that we were in Seattle, but his friend Barry looked after us and it was a great experience! "
3293438,16911568,2014-08-04,1402794,Sabri,"very welcoming , although we did not had Chance to  meet Paul , he had made arrangement  with his his friend to meet us "

3293438,17354964,2014-08-11,9332035,Sandra,"My husband and I had a wonderful stay in Paul McDevitt's home. The private suite, besides being an amazing creatively designed space, came with all of the amenities of comfort and nutrition a human could ask for. I felt so pampered in this home. It was centrally located, easy to find, and parking was never an issue. Our hosts thought of everything including a sweet library of tour books as well as their own binder full of recommended things to see and places to eat nearby. We hope to return soon."
3293438,17684525,2014-08-16,17086247,Maura,"The suite is cozy and very clean. The fridge is well stocked with breakfast items. Paul and John are very hospitable and go out of their way to provide information but they also give you your privacy.
If you are very tall the shower has little headroom but the telephone shower helps. 
Wifi works well. The location is really well connected with buses. 
We were there in a hot spell but there is air conditioning and a ceiling fan. Handy but a little noisy at night. 
Thanks to John and Paul for making our stay comfortable. 
"
3293438,17853579,2014-08-18,17983862,Sheila,"This Apartment was just fantastic!  Would definitely stay here again.
Paul and John were gracious hosts, everything was clean, organized and well appointed.  The décor and food were really nice.  A very pleasant place to stay while in Seattle."
3293438,18563205,2014-08-28,19409765,Anne,"Paul and John were very accommodating hosts who consistently went out of their way to ensure I had a great stay. The apartment is spacious, well-stocked, clean and quiet, and in close proximity to multiple bus routes that get you quickly to downtown, parks, attractions, etc. I was beyond impressed with their commitment to hospitality: I was a most absent-minded guest and over just 36 hours they loaned me an iPad to track down my lost cell phone and also promptly emailed me about a pair of shoes I'd left behind, which they then shipped to my next destination. High marks to these two!"
3293438,18621115,2014-08-29,17200548,Keith,"What a lovely place. My hosts were very welcoming providing just the right amount of privacy and attention. The apartment is very comfortable, plenty of space, and clean as a whistle. Fridge for breakfast is nicely stocked, teas, and coffee. Very close to the international section of town. Very diverse and interesting area. Would return there in a heartbeat. Shower would be a challenge for a tall person."

We appreciated the helpful Seattle recommendations, travel guide books, and the breakfast treats that were left for us. The art in the home is beautiful, as well. The place is very clean/organized, and located fairly close to everything. Thanks for the hospitality, we will keep this place in mind for a future visit! "
3293438,18945440,2014-09-03,16055160,Chris,Paul and John were great hosts. We arrived while they were away but left everything for us and could not have made it feel more like a home. They even let us use their vacuum cleaner when we needed it for our compression bags before our flight. Great hosts and will gladly come back again. 
3293438,19033397,2014-09-05,8168278,Lauren,"We had such a fantastic time at Paul's place. Unfortunately, we did not get to meet him during our stay, but we did get to meet his partner, John, who is such a sweetheart and showed us around. The place is adorable and comfortable, and everything from the great art on the walls to the well-stocked fridge was impeccably done. The location was so convenient to everything we wanted to do. We'll have to stay here again so we can finally meet!"
3293438,19198954,2014-09-08,13189109,Gerald,"Paul is a perfect host and the apartment is cozy, warm and charming.  The home is centrally located and it just takes a few minutes to get to all Seattle has to offer.  The stock of breakfast foods and coffee and tea were excellent.  Great experience.  "
3293438,19409259,2014-09-12,5238022,Peter,"Another GREAT airbnb experience. Our thanks to Paul, who was a terrific host. The apartment, upstairs in their beautiful Victorian house, was perfectly comfortable and just fine for two. In a wonderful little neighborhood, very close (especially by car) to downtown. Paul was very prompt with correspondence and responding to any of our requests. And as others have noted, he stocks the refrigerator for a nice continental breakfast. But has anyone mentioned that he also leaves a supply (now dwindled) of M&Ms? Plain and peanut. Now that's a great host!! Seriously, our stay couldn't have been better. Just a couple of hints for other visitors: we tried one of Paul's restaurant suggestions (Jamburee) and it was fabulous. We'd also suggest Broadcast Coffee nearby (over Starbucks. True!) And if you have a car, don't miss some of the smaller neighborhoods like Fremont, Capital Hill, and Ballard. And the Leschi waterfront nearby. Thanks for helping to make our Seattle visit so enjoyable. Did I mention the M&Ms?"
3293438,19531510,2014-09-14,19559129,Christina,Paul and John were very nice hosts. The apartment was cute and cozy. The snacks and drinks provided were thoughtful and much appreciated! We also  liked that the bus to town was only a shot walk away. We would definitely stay here again! Thanks Paul and John for making our stay in Seattle a good one!
3293438,19683154,2014-09-16,6046146,Kaelyn,Paul and John both were wonderful on our trip! They truly have thought of everything to make a personal feel welcome from the breakfast stocked fridge to the travel books complete with their own recommendations. Their home was so peaceful and in a great spot to travel a lot of the city on bus or even on foot if you're down for the long but nice walk. Would absolutely stay again if we come back to Seattle! 
3293438,20010513,2014-09-22,14608195,James,"The apartment was perfect.  John was a wonderful and thoughtful host (Paul was out of town during our stay).  We stayed in downtown during most of our visit as tourists do but upon return we found that John had replenished the fridge, the M&M's and various other things one would not expect to be treated to.  The neighborhood was quiet and peaceful and with the windows open at night the breeze was perfect even though the high temps had been in the 80's during the day.  Upon our departure, John even drove us to the Link station for our trip to the airport.  We opted to not rent a car and the #27 bus was our ride for 3 days - one block away and a bit over two bucks to ride - you can't beat that.  We hated to depart yesterday and would definitely stay again."
3293438,20232715,2014-09-26,1386709,Tudor,"A lovely, quiet self-contained unit with bath, living room, own kitchenette, well stocked with breakfast bits and coffee machine and all that. Lots of info and brochures/booklets in the unit and a hot tub out back in a nice secluded/covered area. Lovely building. Plenty of bus routes within a block's walk to get around town. Our hosts were very helpful, especially getting around. Plus there was that hot tub! :)

We felt very well looked after, whenever we needed anything, and was a perfect base for our trips and exploring Seattle.

"
3293438,20417558,2014-09-29,13160475,Stacey,The apartment was very cute and tidy. We loved the extra attention to detail throughout the apartment. The continental breakfast was very good and an excellent addition. We would definitely stay again in the future :) 
3293438,20627774,2014-10-02,16174472,Amanda,"John and Paul were first and foremost WONDERFUL hosts! John met us in front of the house while holding a parking spot for us (!!), shook our hands and gave us the grand tour. They went above and beyond since it was our Honeymoon and left a bottle of champagne for us as well. They also kept a stocked fridge and they were very thoughtful about the details. They made us feel welcomed to Seattle.
They were very quick to respond to questions and glad to give advice about the area. The neighborhood was quiet and cozy and felt very private even though it was in central Seattle. The hot tub was a nice bonus too!
We highly recommend their place and will definitely be staying with them again the next time we are in Seattle."
3293438,20722147,2014-10-04,416378,Meredith,"We loved staying with Paul and John! They picked us up from the train station, and they were extremely friendly and hospitable. The house itself is super cute and conveniently located. John and Paul are such thoughtful hosts-- they stocked our fridge with great ""continental breakfast"" type items, and they made the hot tub available (definitely a plus after a long day of sightseeing!) We were on our honeymoon trip, so they even put out a bottle of champagne for us on our arrival. This was absolutely one of the best Airbnb experiences that we've had. Highly recommend!"
3293438,20870605,2014-10-06,21151564,Ashleigh,"This was our first time booking through Airbnb and we could have found a better place. Paul and John have gone over and beyond on making this feel more like a B&B, than just a regular rental. They have fresh berries, milk, coffee, bagels, toast, cream cheese and toast available in the mini fridge - which they re-stock as needed. Oh, and let's not forget the M&M's! In addition, they provide the most comfortable bathrobes for you to lounge around in. At the end of each day - we looked forward to going 'home'. They provide ample amount of guide books to help you decide what to do, and are available to answer any questions you may have. They were very accommodating to our needs for an early check-in and late check-out. The apartment itself is a lovely set-up, perfect for those who want to get a taste of what living in Seattle is like. Would HIGHLY recommend this place!"
3293438,20963429,2014-10-08,552692,BethAnne,"John and Paul exceeded all of our expectations. We've stayed in many different airbnb locations and this one is tops. The location is great - not far from downtown, the university district, or Capitol Hill. They thought of everything. The apartment is wonderfully furnished and met our needs for a few day stay. I have to mention the continental breakfast too: John provided delicious choices. The apartment feels like a real B and B."
3293438,21202517,2014-10-13,19686714,Sarah,"Great hosts (esp for our first Airbnb experience) and the apt is adorable, incredibly well outfitted and very conveniently located. The breakfast was way beyond your regular continental breakfast and the M&M's don't hurt either :) would definitely recommend it and would definitely return! "
3293438,21350348,2014-10-15,12957646,Rita,We loved our experience in Seattle staying at Paul's!  Great location- close to bus that takes you anywhere in the city! The apartment was clean and well stocked and cleaned throughout our stay. Paul even picked us up from the rail station from the airport. Would definitely stay again!
3293438,21484314,2014-10-18,22126884,Ann,Our visit began and ended with our hosts picking us up and dropping us off at the train station. That makes it so much easier to transition to a new city. The rest of our stay was the same. We were provided with plenty of info on the buses which take you right downtown and options for sightseeing. Breakfast was perfect for starting the day. We also enjoyed the eclectic neighborhood in which this apartment is located. The apartment itself is spacious with plenty of room to relax after a long day and beautifully decorated. We would definitely return. 
3293438,21747297,2014-10-23,20938154,Ben,"The apartment is lovely and quiet. The location was perfect for public transport links throughout the city and Paul and John were kind enough to collect and drop us off at the station. They were excellent hosts and had thought of everything, providing plenty of personalised information about the city and how to get around it. We particularly enjoyed the breakfast treats ( replenished daily!) and the hot tub was perfect after a day in Seattle's notorious rain. We had a wonderful time and would certainly recommend."
3293438,22050689,2014-10-28,1605575,Jan,"My husband and I had the pleasure of two nights in this property. This went  above and beyond our usual airbnb experience, in that John, Paul's partner, was happy to pick us up from a light rail station and then drop us off at the Amtrak station when we left. He also did our laundry for us. No kitchen in this apartment, but the breakfast John supplies is very generous - hard boiled eggs, bagels, bread for toast, fresh fruit including strawberries, cereals, yoghurt plus every kind of tea or coffee you could wish for. And of course, there are the M & M's!! The apartment is located in the upstairs area of a charming old house in an area well served by public transport, with the bus ride taking about 25 minutes to downtown Seattle. Although small, the apartment has two long comfy couches for relaxing and all the fittings are top class. We highly recommend this and thanks again John for your hospitality. "
3293438,22242894,2014-11-02,4463533,Natasha,"Our stay at Paul & John's apartment was amazing. They are such welcoming, generous, and considerate hosts -- by far one of the best airbnb experiences we've ever had! John picked us up AND dropped us off at the train station, they provided us with a stocked mini-fridge of bagels, fresh fruit, and juice/milk/coffee and refilled it each day! The apartment is beautifully decorated with comfortable furniture and an extensive collection of original artwork, plus a plethora of guidebooks and a binder full of city information (maps, transit schedules, etc.) put together just for visitors. The neighborhood is quiet and in a great location; bus lines are easy to access, and we were able to walk to the downtown and capitol hill districts no problem. We were too busy exploring to use the hot tub, but I have no doubt it would have been just as great as everything else. Having such a wonderful place to stay made our weekend in Seattle just perfect, and John and Paul's apartment will definitely be our first choice when we visit again!"
3293438,22656859,2014-11-11,5041916,Gwyn & Libby,"We sincerely enjoyed our stay at Paul and John's incredibly nice upstairs apartment! The space was decorated with lots of great art but still felt very comfortable and at-home. All of the little touches were attended to and the food they provided for breakfast was very generous. The apartment was cleaned daily (an AirBnB first for us), was very quiet and we felt very safe and secure.  The hot tub was also very nicely kept and in a quaint, quiet and covered garden pavilion. 

As the ad says, you don't need a car for this location but if you happen to be driving one, parking was plentiful on the street in front of the house. 

We hope to stay here again in the future! "
3293438,23245160,2014-11-26,20233493,Audra,"I can't say enough good things about this place -- it is truly perfect. Paul and John made me feel so welcome and taken care of, offering to pick me up from the light rail station and looking after my needs while I was there. The apartment itself is adorable; a converted attic space that makes incredibly good use of all the available square footage, making it a comfortable, roomy, and convenient place to stay. Breakfast and daily cleaning are provided, which was such a nice treat. The location is just perfect for getting around, as it's close to several major bus lines. There are also markets and restaurants within easy walking distance. Other perks of the apartment include a bus pass, numerous guidebooks and other books about Seattle, and a whole binder full of maps, restaurant recommendations, and other useful information. There's also wifi, cable and Netflix, and all the necessities. They truly thought of everything. "
3293438,23548638,2014-12-04,4514077,Laura,Paul and John are always welcoming and accomodating.
3293438,23665003,2014-12-07,23358832,Shane,"John and Paul were amazing. They picked us up from the light rail station the morning we landed. The house is beautiful. Lots of great snacks. It's a cosy little room. If you're taller than 5'10"" you might have a little trouble with the shower but it's a very small inconvenience and easily outweighed by the great hospitality. "
3293438,23881453,2014-12-13,9687261,Andrew,Awesome location and great hosts. The room has everything you could want! No need to look further.
3293438,24032418,2014-12-17,2059054,Vena,"Paul and John were so welcoming! Great snacks, wonderful set up and a sweet spot."
3293438,25618783,2015-01-20,21986612,Bella,"The apartment is really nice, very quiet and clean. The location is perfect. John and Paul are amazing hosts. They provided us with breakfast stuff and it was really helpful because my boyfriend gets really crazy if he does not have food in the morning. John was VERY kind to giving us a drop off at the truly station. They provide you with plenty of  information about the city and how to get around it. We particularly enjoyed the hot tub it was just PERFECT.  We had a wonderful time and would certainly recommend. Thank you John and Paul! "
3293438,25672433,2015-01-22,26278632,Tea,John & Paul are wonderful hosts. They were more than accommodating and really go the extra mile to make sure you have a great stay. They provide you with information about all Seattle has to offer and stock the mini fridge with fresh juice and berries. When I come back to Seattle I have a feeling this will be the place I stay next time!  
3293438,27284687,2015-03-01,25178205,Eric,"Paul and John were great hosts. Very friendly and very helpful for our entire stay. John even gave us a lift to the airport so that we wouldnt miss our flight because we were running late. The house is in a great area, with plenty of options for transportaion (just a short bus ride to pike place market) I'd recommend them to anyone visiting Seattle!"
3293438,28006506,2015-03-16,27130481,Lily,"Our stay with Paul was great! He picked us up from the light rail when we arrived and was very engaging, telling us about his time in Seattle and answering any questions we had. Breakfast in the morning was substantial and nice to have before heading out each day. From this location we could easily Uber/Lyft to any neighborhood we wanted for under $15 each way (to the waterfront was only about $7, to Discovery Park was $25), but there wasn't much within walking distance. The neighborhood is very nice and quiet, so we were happy to cab into the more trendy areas when we wanted. Paul also dropped us off when we left and he let us keep our bags at their house during our last day (we had a late flight). Overall a great place to stay!"
3293438,28570013,2015-03-26,28531488,Sergey,"You know the saying ""host with the most""? Well that describes John and Paul perfectly. The place was absolutely perfect! It's close to downtown, the bus lines, Capitol Hill, and it sits in a quaint neighborhood. These gentlemen provided outstanding service including cleaning the dishes, towel washing, etc. The fridge was stocked with food, there were towels available, and they even included helpful Orca cards. The piece de resistance was of course the hot tub, very useful and appreciated after long days of walking and exploring the city. All in all, this is an amazing place with great hosts. I would absolutely recommend to anyone."
3293438,28665312,2015-03-28,15686496,Anne,"Super cute place, even more so than the pictures, really close to Downtown. Wish we could have stayed longer. The hosts were more than accommodating when we ran into some personal trouble. Very sweet, would love to stay here again!"
3293438,29869005,2015-04-13,1244345,Liesl,"What a lovely little place. Paul and his partner couldn't have been more gracious and accommodating. It was VERY clean and comfortable. All communication was very clear and Paul went above and beyond with little amenities we didn't even expect (berries in the fridge, with notes about what had been rinsed and what hadn't! So adorable!). Their home is lovely and the place itself was cozy and quiet. The neighborhood is residential but you could still walk to public transit or restaurants, if you wanted to. Just what we needed as home base while we explored Seattle. Highly recommend. "
3293438,30576015,2015-04-24,31027884,Janice,"We found this cozy, secluded, well attended spot on a quiet street. It was immediately recognizable from the picture. John welcomed us and provided a tour of the apartment- that was very comfortable, artfully decorated and included all the comforts that we might need...as well as some we hope to enjoy on a future trip.  John provided an array of tasty foods for us-that he replenished daily. When we accidentally left some items behind, John even offered to bring them to us. John and Paul are attentive and generous hosts."
3293438,30996575,2015-04-30,19047358,Francisco,"John and Paul are great hosts. The apartment is great and they offer all the help possible to make you comfortable while you stay there.
They are really professionals as hosts.
I totally recommend their place.

3293438,31134987,2015-05-02,719449,Kathy,"Really nice space, very accomodating and thoughtful to a travelers needs and beyond. We had a great stay. I am pretty fussy about beds, this one was very comfortable with nice linens. 
The extra amenities were very nice as well and so welcoming.. so quiet."
3293438,31396073,2015-05-04,5845540,Florent,"It was an excellent stay : the house is beautiful,  the room is cosy and confortable.  The service provided is as good as in a great hôtel (breakfast with fresh fruits in the fridge everything day). The neighbourhood is friendly and calm. If I ever come  back to Seattle,  I'll stay there again !"
3293438,32467552,2015-05-18,5546748,Sadie,"Paul was an incredible host and the apartment could not have been more perfect for our stay in Seattle.  Paul picked us up from the link and drove us to the apartment sharing details of the town as well as tips for getting around.  The apartment was extremely clean and comfortable.  They provided snacks and breakfast foods which was a great touch and helped us when we didn't have time to grab food in the morning before our adventures began.  The location was not walking distance to many places that we wanted to explore, but we easily got around town by taking the bus and ubers.  Overall, everything was great and I would recommend this apartment to anyone I know. "
3293438,32866216,2015-05-22,33613043,Stephan,"The apartment is the perfect place when staying in Seattle. The hosts were incredibly nice and did everything to make us feel at home. The place is very clean and well maintained. It is very spacious which makes it great even for a longer stay. We will definitely stay there again, whenever we are visiting Seattle. "
3293438,33318948,2015-05-26,653871,Tatiana,Just the absolute perfect place to stay in Seattle. Only a mile and a half from downtown area or a $7 uber ride away. Lovely little place with a very comfy bed and even breakfast in the morning! John and Paul were the best hosts hands down!
3293438,33512358,2015-05-29,22986828,Genevieve,"I really enjoyed staying at Paul's 1BR appartement. I will always remember the colorfull quality artwork that decorates the entree and appartement. Being in Seattle on a business trip, I appreciated the private entrance, making me feel less disruptive with my late working hours. Paul's place is a short walk from all commidities (ATM, starbucks, drugstore and grocery store) and a 5 min. bus ride (or 35 min. walk) to downtown. It gives you an insight on why Seattle is called the Emerald city, a feeling that belongs only to the surroundings of Seattle. The appartement met all my expectations. I was clean and representative of a victorian house. I greatly appreciated the straberries and lowfat yogurt offered in the kitchenette.  Thanks again Paul and John !"
3293438,34725389,2015-06-11,206203,Amanda,"This is a great place, close to downtown, quiet, impeccably clean, and very welcoming. It is by far one of the nicest places I have stayed in its price range. There is ample parking (important in Seattle), John and David are generous and kind hosts providing a breakfast assortment, fruits of various kinds, and milk and juices. Also got a slice of special banana bread my second night. I hope to stay here again on one of my many trips to Seattle. "
3293438,35816491,2015-06-22,33371045,Alysen,"John and Paul did an excellent job making my Fiance and I feel at home.  This was the first time, we had been to Seattle, John kindly picked and dropped us (email hidden)ker Light Rail and Paul had a guidebook that provided good restaurants, transit information, house rules, etc.  The apartment is extremely clean and very comfy, they restocked water, and food on a daily for us and also reserved time for us to use the hot tub.  
The location is very centrally located, took us about 30 minutes by transit to get anywhere we wanted. Quiet neighborhood.  Would definitely stay here again if we are in the city. "
3293438,36113409,2015-06-25,25779122,Dean,Great stay! Clean and welcoming. Very comfortable. Would highly recommend.
3293438,37066428,2015-07-04,34335278,Andy,"The stay was great! Convenient location and great hosts! Felt very welcomed in this cute apartment. The week we stayed was extremely hot, thank god for the air conditioning in the unit :). Room was cleaned and stocked daily with snacks and drinks, what a deal! I would definitely stay here again whenever I visit seattle."
3293438,41573553,2015-08-08,12188879,Maria,"Paul and John were very friendly and welcoming! The apartment was beautifully decorated, immaculate and well stocked. The bed was very comfortable. The Orca cards, bus maps and city guide were very helpful to us for getting to the Downtown area and there were several bus stops nearby. It was a great place for an extended stay! "
3293438,41942817,2015-08-10,20546768,Laura,"Paul could easily own a professional hotel! The appartment has got everything you could possibly need and more. It felt like home after an hour! The house is beautiful and the appartment is very cosy with art on the walls and tasty furniture. Would absolutely recommend it! The neighbourhood is not the best, but it takes you 10 min to get downtown. Loved it! Did not meet Paul but his friend Barry was the best and kindest host.  "
3293438,42285789,2015-08-12,16659304,Vicki,"We had a great experience. The place was clean and charming. Getting off a long plane ride made the hot tub experience divine. Your assistant, Barry, was very helpful. We enjoyed your breakfast selection."
3293438,43069416,2015-08-17,24829123,Winston,The host canceled this reservation 46 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
3293438,47211030,2015-09-16,2331328,Danielle,"My partner and I stayed at Pauls place for 2 nights. We were greeted by a very kind and helpful John, who showed us the ins and outs of the appartment. John was extremely hospitable and really cared about his guests. The only qualm I had was that the shower is in line with the roof line and therefore my partner who is 6 foot 5 inches had a tough time showering. But he got creative and for two nights it really wasn't a big deal, and this certainly wouldn't deter us from staying there again! If you're looking for a beautiful place to stay that is comfortable and close to downtown Seattle, this is your place!!!"
3293438,47666239,2015-09-21,24012668,Anne,"Paul and John were welcoming hosts.  They were friendly and checked in with us about how things were going for us, not only in the house, but also when we dropped out daughter off for college!  The apartment is very clean and comfortable and has wonderful art spread throughout.  The breakfast that Paul put out for us was ample and varied.  We had a wonderful stay!"
3293438,48996693,2015-09-30,180176,Gary,"My wife and I stayed at this terrific hide-away for 1 week. I had just had eye surgery so John and Paul helped me with our heaviest bags to the room...and stored our bikes safely behind a locked gate! Over the course of the week, John ensured that we had an amazing experience! Recovering from my surgery was a breeze as John daily visited the apartment to re-stock food, share his great humor, place an Amazon delivery in our room and offer us laundry services! 

John and Paul thought of everything to make it a terrific experience for us--the comfort of the bed, the roomy closet (big enough for bags and clothes), the separately controlled thermostat (bedroom and LR), the dishes/fridge/microwave, the nice art work on the walls, the roomy-enough living room ALL within a very short walk of the bus to town (10  minute drive), Walgreens, Starbucks and Red Apple grocery store...all on a quiet residential road! 

Since Pioneer Square was a 'downhill' walk, we took a 30 minute stroll, passing through Little Saigon, The International District and Pioneer Square to the waterfront and returning to our 'home' later on an easy 15 minute bus ride!

We heartily endorse and suggest this place for anyone who wants a city escape that is within a non-city environment---In fact, we've already booked our next visit!!
"
3293438,49246300,2015-10-02,37580116,은호,It was my first trial of Airbnb and pretty awesome with Paul and John :) They've organized everything to stay there comfortable including fantastic food! I am sure to visit again! Thank you so much!! It's been my best place ever :)
3293438,50240611,2015-10-10,45082261,Rosa,"Unfortunately we spend only three nighta at Paul & John's place. And we say unfortunately because we were sad to leave this wonderful place. We were very comfortable here. A cosy cute apartment, well stocked, and just seconds away from the bus that will take us down town in 10 minutes. We walked one day and it was not much more than this, maybe 20 minutes tops. 
But going back to the apartment, and old victorian house, we felt very comfortable in there, the bed was also omfortable, not too hard, not too soft, and to make things better there was a fully stocked fridge and kitchenette that provide a more-than-enough breakfast for my wife and I every morning. That was a super bonus for us. ( egs, coffe, bread, baggels, jam, butter, juice, iogurts, fruits, etc etc) The fridge was re-stocked every day with watever we had consumed last day. 
John also did our laundry upon arrival and it was ready and folded in two hours! He also picked us up from the train station and even gave us a ride the last day. Didn't need to do it, but it was highly appreciated. There was also a TV, nice restroom, plenty of turist information available in the apartment, wi-fi, etc,etc,etc...
I would definetely recomend that place to anyone wisiting Seattle.    "
