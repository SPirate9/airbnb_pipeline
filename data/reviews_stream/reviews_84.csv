And having a fresh bag of coffee waiting in the fridge was very much appreciated. It felt like home-except the bed is much more comfortable than mine! They provided lots of info on the neighborhood and sightseeing so a great place for first time visitors, or someone who wants a place in town. Highly recommended!"
442487,1930430,2012-08-09,2159323,Stephanie,"MArgot and her family are the nicest people we have met during the 6 weeks we passed in USA. They are helpfull and let you some privacy but are always there for you if you need something. The studio was perfect for us, and the chickens behind the kitchen's window was so fun! And so are  their fresh eggs!
If you try airbnb for the first time you will not be disappointed. We wish that we could come back here again in the futur!"
442487,1948621,2012-08-11,2191588,Mary,"Fabulous basement  studio apartment in Capitol Hill area.  Parking was not a problem at all!  Clean, quiet and we loved the chickens outside the kitchen window.  We would definitely stay there again!"
442487,1967921,2012-08-13,2675712,Michelle,"This lovely studio was perfect for my family that includes two young children.  It has the feel of staying with family and being spoiled with our own private space and freedom.  The studio is spacious and bright, completely comfortable and home-clean.  It was awesome having the chickens outside our kitchen window and garden flowers to enjoy!  We had our windows open all night and barely noticed the occasional cluck in the evening as we took in the fresh air.  The space is incredibly quiet considering how close this urban farm is to big city fun.  The neighborhood along the main drag has great eats, a Trader Joe's, Safeway and fun shops.  Margot was so generous with allowing my young daughter to collect the offering of eggs for our breakfast, help out rearranging the chicken coop, inviting us to picnic under the mimosa tree, roam her lovely urban farm freely and even gave us a tomato to complete our home cooked dinner so that we didn't have to go to the store.  This is a basement suite with very friendly and quiet people upstairs.  There is a small park for the kiddos to play on the corner, another park just 3 blocks up the hill that has fountains to splash in, and Madison Park with it's amazing amount of play equipment and the bay is only 1.5'ish miles away.  We even got to swim in the bay!  We couldn't have had a lovlier time.  We were in town for a family wedding that was going to require a hotel bill of $230+ a night.  We are so fortunate to have found Margot and Ivy's spot to save us a load of money AND the experience was priceless!  My kids had a blast and we look forward to another stay next summer :)"
442487,1999879,2012-08-16,881457,Aaron,"Margot and Ivy are wonderful hosts and their studio is a quintessential slice of what is great with Seattle! From their great communication and welcome materials to the urban chickens, from the exceptional walking location to the fresh flowers, their place is warm, fun and welcoming."
442487,2009961,2012-08-17,2727975,Vanessa,"Although our stay at Margot and Ivy's studio apartment was less than 24 hours, it was very memorable! The apartment set up was comfortable and sweet with a urban-farm theme with a small chicken farm out the kitchen window! It was such a gem staying in a hip neighborhood at such an affordable cost! Ivy even wrote out a guide of neighborhood eats. I would definitely recommend and rent again at this lovely studio apartment!"
442487,2020459,2012-08-18,2992228,Wendy,"The modest basement apartment was a good fit for my 8 year old and I for the night.  Margot gave us a great recommendation for dinner in the neighborhood, a delicious french bistro as well as an ice cream shop a little further down the road.  It was very easy to use to the bus to take us to Seattle Center.  Thanks for a great stay.

442487,2027659,2012-08-19,2464107,Craig,"I very much enjoyed meeting Margot, Ivy and  other family members too.  The place was great and very convenient too.  I appreciated the tips that were provided for me.  Thank you Margot and Ivy!"
442487,2053568,2012-08-21,2182595,Corinna,"Although we arrived very late, the little flat was a safe haven after our rather tedious journey from Germany. It's comfy and light, and we all really enjoyed our stay here. The tips on what to do and the restaurant-suggestions were very useful (I, too, would recommend the Thai, we just loved it!) and alltogether, we had a pleasant two-day stay in Seattle. "
442487,2092406,2012-08-25,924105,Benjamin,"1 night stay with a friend. We found the place easily and were happy with our visit. The space is clean and well situated for the price. We walked into downtown and visited local neighborhood-y spots in 20-30 minutes. I would stay here again! No hassle, simple quick meet up with owners to get key. They are living right next door. Especially liked having chickens right out the window (no noise issues at all, just beautiful lively creatures ;-) "
442487,2123512,2012-08-28,1681040,Nicholas,We had a wonderful two day stay at the garden studio.  It was a spacious and clean environment plus convenient (by bus) to down town Seattle.  I would recommend it to anyone wishing to stay in Seattle. 
442487,2227994,2012-09-08,2493775,Elin,"They left us a bowl of fresh eggs, and invited us to nibble from their garden - do I really need to say more?

My husband and I were thrilled with Margot & Ivy's garden-level studio apartment. Very easy to find and access. Clean and tidy, lots of local info on-hand. Great quiet location, proximal to shops, restaurants, and mass transit. On-street parking much, much easier than anticipated. 

We are looking forward to staying here for all of our future Seattle trips.

442487,2242389,2012-09-09,2341877,Sky,"This place is great. It's large, has a very comfy bed, full kitchen, and is in a great neighborhood. Margot and Ivy even left delicious fresh eggs from their chickens for us in the morning."
442487,2287678,2012-09-14,2748541,Tom,"The studio is cozy, well lit and in walking distance from downtown. Everyone in the family was super welcoming and kind - I can fully recommend staying with Margo and Ivy to everyone!"
442487,2331558,2012-09-18,2692073,Jacquie,"A short but wonderful stay with charming hosts.  We were entertained by the antics of the chickens outside the kitchen window every morning and rewarded with 4 fresh eggs for breakfast.  
The studio is within walking distance of some very nice restaurants, bars and coffee shops and is close to bus routes ... so no need to drive anywhere.  We loved Seattle ... especially Pike's Market Place ... but sadly didn't have time to visit the art galleries (closed on Monday) .... something for next time.  The ferry trip to Bainbridge gave us a glimpse of the wonderful coastline and islands around Seattle. 
Would definitely stay here again, thank you Margot and Ivy."
442487,2378896,2012-09-23,2454262,Erin,"While we didn't get to meet Margot or Ivy (we were all super-busy!), my sister and I enjoyed our stay in their Capitol Hill studio apartment.

We arrived on the early side of our expected ETA ... Ivy & Margot had not had a chance to get into the studio between our arrival and their last guests' departure.  A quick phone call, however, put things right. We were able find a super-cute restaurant for a delicious Basque dinner while Ivy took care of business.  In an hour, the apartment was cleaned and ready for us -- plus, they gave us gift cards for free coffees.  Yay!

They live in a great area and provide a folder full of really helpful info about the apartment, public transit and food recommendations.  Added bonus: be prepared to meet their adorable chickens in the side yard (I actually got to feed them by simply opening the kitchen window)!  "
442487,2461961,2012-10-01,2494296,Eric,Everything was as described. Margot and Ivy were very attentive hosts and made sure we had everything we needed. The location is great and much of Seattle is walkable or has easy public transit options. 
442487,2536670,2012-10-08,2447436,Ho-Sheng,"I moved to Seattle and came here with just the things in my car. Margot & Ivy's Garden Studio is located in the neighborhood I had wanted to live in. And sure enough, it was a guest space, located at the basement of a house. Things were clean, and I was left to my devices.

I was able to sign a lease on my apartment ... and then instead of taking advantage of the free parking space at my apartment building, I decided to stay one more night on a ""real bed"".

I woke up the next morning to hop in my car to get some lunch ... and my car was gone. Turns out, it had been stolen, and the possessions I had left in there were gone. Most of my important things were already in the new apartment or still at the guest house. 

I drive an older Honda Accord. On Cap Hill, it is a very popular car for theft and car prowl. (Lesson Learned: if you are driving out here and have an older Honda Accord, make sure you get one of those club security devices and don't leave valuables in the car). Combined with my carelessly left-out GPS and stereo system, it's not surprising  someone broke in.

The reason this is a 5 star review is because of Margot's help afterwards. She didn't have to help me get my apartment setup -- she really didn'tt: blame is to the car thieves, even though the rest of us have to pick up the pieces -- but she help anyways. I never felt that she wanted to help because of AirBnB ratings. Margot and her family are much like a lot of people I've met on the West Coast: people who want to help you because they want to help.

This is the kind of neighbors I like. You should totally stay here when you visit Seattle-- the people are great. Besides, you know you want to say ""hi"" to the chickens."
442487,2639067,2012-10-17,2459042,Lana,"This was my first stay at an Airbnb property and I am definately spoiled by this one!  Margot & Ivy were both extremely friendly and helpful.  The apartment is very cozy and warm.  I felt at home immediately.  The bed is very comfy...maybe too comfy!  And what a great way to start your morning by having chickens outside your kitchen window!  It always brought a smile to my face!  Nice to have herbs and flowers outside your window as well.  The property is very convenient to buses, restaurants and coffee shops (Ladro, a favorite of mine).  Parking was never a problem and the neighborhood felt very safe for a single woman coming home at night.  I would love to stay at this apartment again and would highly recommend it for anyone visiting Seattle.  The only drawback to giving it such a good review...I'm afraid it will now always be busy and I won't be able to get a reservation when I visit again!  Thank you Margot & Ivy for a delightful and comforting space."
442487,3075839,2012-12-11,2602857,Courtney,The reservation was canceled 17 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
442487,5018838,2013-06-08,4284789,Paul,"Super friendly hosts, and were very accomodating to my difficult schedule.  Place was clean, well located and comfortable.  I regret never seeing the chickens, but perhaps next time."
442487,5075900,2013-06-11,4049914,Kim,We really enjoyed our stay. The apartment was comfortable and quiet. It was in a perfect location within walking distance from our favorite Capital Hill destinations but without any of the parking headaches. We would love to stay again!
442487,5375145,2013-06-27,2052272,Mark,"We really had a wonderful stay at Margot and Ivy's place.  The studio is clean and comfortable.  It has all the necessities of home as well as a few neat extras.  Among those are the resident chickens outside the kitchen window.  My son and daughter really enjoyed feeding them our scraps every morning and eating an occasional egg as well.  The place is also situated in the middle of a garden, and Margot was very gracious in letting us pick some raspberries and strawberries each morning for our breakfast.  As far as the location goes, you can't find a much better area in which to stay in my opinion.  The Capitol Hill area is beautiful with many cool cafes right around the corner.  We especially enjoyed some of the nearby restaurants and parks.  Even just strolling around the area was fun as the houses and landscaping are colorful and vibrant.   If you want to be downtown, it is a very pleasant 30 minute walk.  This place was definitely one of the reasons why we enjoyed our trip to Seattle so much."
442487,5445792,2013-07-01,3794721,Amy,"We really enjoyed our stay and found the apartment to be affordable, comfortable, and roomy enough for three people.  We especially appreciated the lovely gardens, the posse of chickens that like to poke their heads in through the kitchen window, and the great neighborhood.  We highly recommend dinner at Cafe Flora just down the hill.  Oh my goodness, so delicious!  But we also really appreciated the ability to cook our own meals in the kitchen, which was well equipped with pots, pans, etc.  Margot and Ivy were very kind and responsive to our needs.  Communication was great! "
442487,5554296,2013-07-06,3599590,Lindsey,"I booked a stay here in this studio for my parents when they visited Seattle from Delaware.  The studio is beautifully kept up, clean and light (impressive for a basement/garden-level studio) and Margot and Ivy were both extremely kind and helpful.  My parents also got seemingly endless entertainment from the chickens visible at the kitchen window.  I can attest that the studio lies in a quiet, yet central/walkable, neighborhood with a lot of character; I live less than 2 blocks away!  Overall, the experience was all that we expected and more.  Thanks!"
442487,5657138,2013-07-10,1112690,Diana,"I had a very comfortable 3-night stay in Margot and Ivy's apartment. Margot and Anthony were very welcoming and helpful as I arrived earlier than the checking-in time. I enjoyed having the chickens outside the kitchen window with the bonus that I had a fresh egg each day of my stay. Margot was even able to provide an egg-cup for me as this appears to be a particular English tradition! The location is ideal with easy access to buses and with stores and coffee shops close by. Margot was attentive to my comfort during my stay, keeping in touch by phone, text and email; I enjoyed being able to chat over some iced tea  would certainly stay here again if I return to Seattle."
442487,5727853,2013-07-14,3079202,Addie,"I had a very nice stay this past weekend. As everyone has mentioned, the chickens outside the window were very entertaining and sweet. Fresh eggs in the AM a bonus. Margot was welcoming and very nice considering I made a mistake with my reservation. 
I was also welcomed by a wonderful blooming garden. On the practical side - there was always street parking available, it's close to good food, convenient for transportation and very quiet."
442487,5881359,2013-07-21,2243648,Harvey,"We had a wonderful stay in the apartment. We did not meet Margot  or Ivy but we spoke on the phone and the logistics went without a hitch. The apartment is very comfortable and clean. It is on a quiet street, surrounded by flowers. The chickens outside the kitchen window at eye level are hypnotizing. Our daughter lives a 15 minute walk away so it was very convenient. The arboretum, Lake Washington, Madison Valley and Capitol Hill are all within walking distances. "
442487,6169990,2013-08-02,5854459,Margaret,"We stayed at the Lovely Garden Studio three times over three weeks.  It was a comfortable, convenient and informal situation that felt like home by the end.  It was a quiet street with easy parking close to what we needed on Capitol Hill.  It couldn't have been a better stay.  One thing though: you must be prepared for a few curious chickens looking in at you at the kitchen window.  We would stay there again in a heartbeat."
442487,6270046,2013-08-06,5555122,Chad,Margot and Ivy's Garden Studio apartment was fantastic. The space was very clean and had a ton of character. We were greeted with a fresh collection of chicken eggs taken from the coop outside the kitchen windows. The apartment was easily accessible and street parking was plentiful at all hours. Margot is very responsive in all communication. We hope to make it to Seattle again soon and will cross our fingers that this apartment is available.
442487,6341705,2013-08-09,6386575,Wim,A great stay at Seattle. A very cosy and clean apartment.The bathroom could be refurbished. We loved the hens and the hens loved our cornflakes. Quiet neigbourhood. We recommend this place to everyone.
442487,6455556,2013-08-13,6179597,Megan,"We enjoyed staying in this studio apartment, it was close to everything we wanted to see and we never had problems navigating our way to or from the neighborhood.  The apartment was clean and comfortable, much larger than a hotel and had more of a homely feel.  I would definitely stay here again."
442487,6504902,2013-08-15,4847124,Amy,"Lovely space!  Great area not too far from downtown.  It was away from the hustle and bustle of the city and we thought it was so charming!  Kitchen, bathroom, bed, and little dining area.  We didn't spend too much time in Seattle, so we only had two nights with Margot & Ivy but this space was perfect!  :)"
442487,6589858,2013-08-18,7301949,Janette,"As first time Airbnb users, my boyfriend & I loved this experience! Great location that was a short drive to all the Seattle sights. Enjoyed the charm of the homegrown fruits & veggies surrounding the home and the chickens outside. Plenty of street parking for our rental. Communication with Margot & Ivy was great and they were quick to solve a tiny issue we had with ants (some found their way inside because the warm weather). The studio was neat, clean, and had all that we needed. We would definitely recommend this studio or any place that Margot & Ivy might list!"
442487,6755457,2013-08-24,2687961,Candace,Margot was a great host! Even provided bike helmets to us because we forgot ours. :) We had a beautiful time in Seattle.
442487,6841613,2013-08-26,7324758,Lily,The reservation was canceled 38 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
442487,6854117,2013-08-27,7351131,Sam,"Margot & Ivy had a great place for us to stay, we never ran into them, but the place was great. The chickens were fun to feed. The location was close to downtown and we were able to drive back and forth through out the day to relax in the room."
442487,6958278,2013-09-01,2636668,Michael,"We had an absolutely lovely stay at Margot and Ivy's studio apartment. Leading up to our arrival, Margot was helpful and quick to respond to emails and texts. We arrived to beautiful fresh cut flowers from the garden, eggs from the hens, and a delicious bowl of trail mix. The location was perfect for walking to Cap Hill and provided easy access by car or public transportation to other nearby neighborhoods. "
442487,7196978,2013-09-10,7749551,Stephen,"The apartment was clean, the bed comfy, and everything worked. It's also in a great location: a nice quiet neighborhood, yet close to everything we wanted to see. Loved the chickens. Margot and Ivy also gave us very detailed directions and information, and responded immediately when I had a question. Great experience!
"
442487,7256497,2013-09-13,145959,Lindsay,"After you stay in a number of airbnb homes, you realize that some people do it for the money, and others do it because they have the resources to rent out their space and they want others to experience the home that they love. Margot and Ivy's studio is made for visitors, and you can tell they really love to share their home with guests. They leave recommendations and maps, and you can really tell they love where they live. Margot went out of her way to show my husband and me around, but allowed us to keep to ourselves and explore Seattle on our own. Quiet location (with the occasional exception of the chickens) and conveniently located."
442487,7733748,2013-10-01,6039794,Lorenda,"If you love home away from home you will appreciate this quiet garden level studio apartment nestled in one of Seattle's beautiful neighborhoods. Just a few blocks from parks, grocery stores and hip places to eat and shop at. The host was warm, helpful and the accommodations clean and cheerful. We hope to stay their again in the future."
442487,13546590,2014-05-30,603020,Jennifer," I didn't get the chance to meet Margot & Anthony during my stay, but communication before, during, and as we were checking out was quick and easy. They were very responsive to any questions we had. Their location is perfect: they are in a quiet neighborhood, but are within walking distance to a number of different neighborhoods with great restaurants, cafes and bars. I highly recommend Margot & Anthony's space. "
442487,14508286,2014-06-21,13976006,Beth,The apartment and the neighborhood were as promised.  I would recommend the apartment to anyone wishing to stay in Seattle.  The price was very reasonable and the kitchen helped to keep our expenses down.
442487,14734136,2014-06-25,12542736,Kelly,"Nice stay! Great neighbourhood. Enough space  in the  studio. We took the bus to the center, it was easy to travel . Margot makes you feel at home."
442487,15135401,2014-07-03,14511401,Jim,A very convenient location for all our activities while in Seattle. A quiet side street with very nice accommodations. We have no complaints and enjoyed meeting our hosts. We would rate this as a top spot to stay during future visits to Seattle.
442487,15389228,2014-07-08,5790686,Lisa,"I had a great time staying in Margot and Anthony's studio. The studio is in the renovated basement of the house next door to where they live, in a lovely quiet neighbourhood. Getting to and from downtown and the airport by public transit was very easy. There is a large Safeway close by, and the studio has a decent sized kitchen which makes cooking easy. Margot is a very friendly host, and the chickens were friendly too."
442487,15816772,2014-07-16,3791687,Lauren,"Margot is a lovely host. She cares very much about the comfort of her guests and will accommodate your needs as best she can. The unit is just as it is pictured. The location off of E Madison was very convenient as a central point between downtown and Madison Park. Seattle was experiencing record heat, so the basement apartment was a blessing. "
442487,16059525,2014-07-21,14063212,Dan,"Margot and Anthony were great! They had a lovely studio. Upon entering, there was a beautiful vase full of freshly picked flowers from the garden. The neighborhood was cute and quiet, perfect for strolling around. The chickens in the backyard were great and very friendly! Thanks again!"
442487,18464329,2014-08-27,116844,Val,The accommodations were great and one of the best parts was meeting and talking w Margo.
442487,19021878,2014-09-05,4600061,Kevin,"The neighborhood was delightfully accessible by foot (our preferred method of travel), conveniently close to everything we wanted to do and a pleasant neighborhood that was well lived in. Our Hosts offered us FRESH chicken eggs, were available for our needs but didn't dote on us, and everything was delivered as advertised."
442487,19410376,2014-09-12,12390535,Julie,"My boyfriend and I stayed here for a week, and it was the perfect spot for us. The neighborhood is beautiful and the apartment was clean and cute. We really appreciated the welcome packet that was provided to give information on the apartment and surrounding area. We're pretty private people and really appreciated that they were so helpful without being at all intrusive.

If you are coming from out of town and are planning on doing a lot of exploring around the city, we highly recommend pre-ordering an ORCA card and putting some money on it so you can easily get around (and it made it really easy to get from the airport to Margot & Anthony's). There are busses nearby that can take you pretty much anywhere you'd like to go.

If you're trying to stay in Seattle on a budget, this is definitely the place for you. We could not have asked for a nicer stay!"
442487,19612643,2014-09-15,13418407,Chris,"The studio was really really nice. A really quiet nice road with a 'suburbia' feel but still very close to central Seattle. There are some major bus routes close by but as the weather was so good we just walked. 

Studio is a great size and the bed was very comfortable. All the amenities we needed were included. We didn't get to meet Margot but Anthony was very helpful, helping us with and early check-in and an early morning taxi when we left. Would certainly stay again, highly recommended."
442487,19938815,2014-09-21,177845,Matthew,"We had a great stay at Margo & Anthony's place. Pretty much anywhere we wanted to go was within five miles. There was plenty of street parking for our rental car. The place was nice and comfortable and private. It was fun to feed the chickens outside of the window. I never got to meet Margot face to face, but we talked on the phone and she was very nice and made sure we had a great stay. Thank you!"
442487,20249180,2014-09-26,10499629,Guillermo & Nic,"Our stay was very comfortable. The apartment was fully equipped and the fresh cut-flowers on arrival were a nice touch.

We loved the neighbourhood; and the location is convenient for both the attractions in Downtown and those around the Space Needle, as long as you're comfortable availing yourselves of the many and frequent buses close by (journey times less than 25 mins).

Margot was very helpful with a swift response to any communications.

We were grateful for flexibility on the check out time.

We will certainly consider staying at Margot and Anthony's flat the next time we visit Seattle.

- I loved the chickens outside of the kitchen window!

 "
442487,20817120,2014-10-06,8112528,Ilona,"My parents really enjoyed their stay. Quiet location, close to downtown Seattle and other neighborhoods and lovely chickens!"
442487,21051558,2014-10-10,7833788,Kamrin,"We loved staying at this cute little apartment. It had kitchen and laundry supplies included, which was very convenient. It's located in a very walk-able part of Seattle, near a lot of great restaurants and bars. Highly recommended! "
442487,21209836,2014-10-13,6166906,Nicolette,"Lovely quiet little street.  The location was ideal, walkable to everything in Capitol Hill and surrounding areas. Thank you Margot & Anthony."
442487,21511474,2014-10-19,18747875,Veronica,"Margot was very very helpful. The Place is exactly how they described it. Is very specious. The bed is super comfortable. We loved the chickens they are the most friendly ones i have ever seen. They are super cute. The neighborhood was conveniently located super close to downtown, we used uber and the fare was no more than 8 dolllars to downtown so pretty convenient. Also is walking distance from a lot of coffee shops and bars. If you want to get a taste of Seattle. Stay with Margot. We had good communication she responded very fast, we are very pleased with our experience!  "
442487,22022021,2014-10-28,21102825,Gail,"There were so many little ways Margot and Anthony welcomed me to Seattle. It began with a lovely email message of confirmation of my reservation, followed by a personal greeting upon arrival, fresh flowers & eggs and a fabulous list of resources for my visit. The apartment was as pictured. It is very light, airy and comfortable for one or two persons. 
The local area is an eclectic array of homes with a lovely variety of landscaping, mature trees and abundant color. It was easy walking distance to where I was visiting with many local bus routes nearby. "
442487,22307462,2014-11-03,21341814,Carly,"Margot was helpful in accommodating our late check in and unusual check out times. The space matches the pictures and the kitchen is fully stocked with pots, pans, and other cooking needs. We enjoyed the neighborhood and were able to explore much of Seattle on foot from the property.  The apartment is easily accessed using public transport from the airport. I would highly recommend the space for those looking for a quiet urban retreat! "
442487,22477763,2014-11-07,22771430,Elizabeth,The space is just as photographed but there are several minor maintenance issues that need to be addressed and it feels a bit like they are more concerned with filling the bed every night than looking after this property.
442487,22589938,2014-11-10,1745230,Leila,"It was a lovely stay, comfortable and well appointed apartment in a fun neighborhood. We enjoyed walking to Luc for desert, and it was easy to get downtown and to the University District. We had everything we needed to be quite comfortable. Thank you!"
442487,23045516,2014-11-21,22611979,Chris,This was a great and quiet place to stay. Really enjoyed my time here and will try to stay againin thre future. Thanks for making me feel so welcome!
442487,23728430,2014-12-08,6917723,Holly,"I rented this space for my folks when they came to visit and it was perfect. Margot was incredibly welcoming, helpful and available to answer questions. My folks got around easily, both on foot and taking the bus. The place is clean, cute and comfortable."
442487,23968947,2014-12-15,9076904,New,Margot & Anthony were wonderful hosts.  Communication back and forth was easy and speedy.  They made sure we understood everything we needed to know about the studio and were very clear and thorough.  Plenty of parking is available and the heater kept us nice and warm at night. Location was in a nice quiet neighborhood.  We would stay here again and recommend to friends.
442487,24343787,2014-12-26,24331977,Harry,The place is clear and welcoming. Very interesting nice hosts. Highly recommend. 
442487,24554763,2014-12-30,24465870,Brooke,"A relaxing, nice place. Accurate description. Beautiful neighborhood. "
442487,35803064,2015-06-22,260934,Johanna,"the place was spotless, bright and comfortable. there were fresh eggs from our neighbors the chickens and granola bars to snack on. the towels were plush, and the bathroom clean. check in was flexible and the hosts extremely accommodating. 
the location is quiet and a bit away from the noise of the city, and a relaxing atmosphere. "
442487,36276536,2015-06-27,6742625,Jennifer,"Margot & Anthony are both incredibly welcoming and lovely hosts. We didn't get a chance to meet them in person, but communication with them was a breeze. The eggs they left for us were a delight, and the chickens were adorable. Even though it was really hot out for the few days that we were there, the studio remained at a very comfortable steady temperature all day and night. I would recommend anyone visiting Seattle to stay at their garden studio."
442487,36659975,2015-06-30,3146676,Ulrike,"Although I have not met Margot or Anthony in person I felt they were really nice people the way email communication went. I arrived on an overnight flight so early in the morning and Margot made it easy for me to find the keys.
Me and my boyfriend felt very welcome as the studio is just so nice and cozy and clean.
The neighborhood is amazing. Lush green very quiet street and you can still walk downtown in half an hour or take one of the many frequent buses.
I would never want to stay downtown with this alternative. It was actually nice to come ""come"" to this quiet area after a full day downtown. 
Thank you!"
442487,37557391,2015-07-08,11313239,David,"The host met us upon our arrival and was friendly. The location was very good and the parking out front was great. The place had everything you needed to do your own cooking and make your stay comfortable. The place was clean and organized. 
You had to pay particular attention to keeping the kitchen counter tops exceptionally clean to avoid the visit from the local ant colony. This may have been a result of the exceptionally dry summer Seattle has experienced.
I am not sure why it was termed lovely ""garden"" studio as there wasn't really any garden. Again maybe a result of the dry summer.
When you are leaving make sure you sweep the floor, take out the garbage to the designated place and start a load of wash for the towels and bed sheets or the host will charge you an additional $30US.
Overall it was a convenient place to stay in central Seattle.

"
442487,38692507,2015-07-18,28347118,Francesco,"Margot è sempre stata gentile e disponibile. La casa è confortevole, ampia, silenziosa, in un quartiere molto gradevole ben servito dai mezzi pubblici"
442487,39372977,2015-07-23,29163941,Chris,"Great communication with the host, though we never actually met up due to us being so busy and their conflicting schedules. Margot made sure we had everything we needed, and was able to get an iron and ironing board upon our request. We met one of the residents who lived in the house, and he gave us some great advice on things to do. The best suggestion was Chuck's hop shop, a great place for beer lovers, and probably only a mile away. One thing that we were surprised about (in a good way) was our access to a washer and dryer. I might have missed it in the original description of the place, but it was nice to have so we could go on to Portland with clean clothes. It was pretty warm a couple days for our stay, but even in the lower nineties during the day, it got cool enough in the evening that with an open window and the thoughtful fan Margot left for us, we were comfortable at night. The place was clean when we arrived, though the sheets had an odor to them like they may have been left in the washer too long after a cycle. Not a big deal to wash them ourselves with the aforementioned washer and dryer. We would definitely stay here again. Thanks Margot!"
442487,39906660,2015-07-27,7408613,Jill,"This location was close to a large Safeway store and bus routes to different parts of Seattle. We used the light rail and bus from the airport following Margot's accurate instructions. We bought an Orca card at the Safeway and used the buses to get to the University area, downtown, Fremont and the Seattle center. It would be helpful to have the app for the buses on a phone as they don't follow the posted timetable and once we waited 40 minutes (a Sunday).
We loved the chickens and enjoyed the eggs Margot left us. Also the flowers."
442487,40563444,2015-08-01,13139531,Amy,"We really enjoyed our stay at Margot and Anthony's apartment.  We had no problems accessing the key and when we arrived there were fresh flowers, some granola bars, and a fresh egg from the chickens out back.  We had everything we needed including kitchen utensils, toiletries and a hair dryer.  The location is in a quiet residential area, but it was easy to access everywhere we wanted to go via the buses and even walking.  We would definitely recommend Margot and Anthony's place!"
442487,41581399,2015-08-08,30106945,Dom,Awesome place in a great part of town. Getting to and from Downtown was really easy and the convenient location is near a lot of great restaurants and grocery stores. The chickens were pretty entertaining as well. The space was very clean and cozy and I will definitely consider staying again!
442487,42113083,2015-08-11,5120619,Shawn,"Margot and Anthony's studio was absolutely perfect for our stay.  We immediately felt at home.  The neighborhood was great.  It made us feel like locals.  It was very easy to get to, and it was convenient to travel to all of the local attractions.  We had everything and more that we needed for our stay (absolutely loved the coffee).  We really enjoyed the visits from the chickens every morning!  They were great about contacting us with updates about our stay."
442487,43473712,2015-08-20,27206817,Millary,"This airbnb was perfect for our needs; in a nice, quiet neighborhood.  The location couldn't have been better.  Though we didn't need to use public transportation, it was very convenient.  Margot was very accommodating and though our schedules didn't enable us to meet, she was accessible and helpful.  There is a full kitchen with all necessary accoutrements for those wanting to take advantage of this.  The walk-in shower was great as were the shower accessories.  The fan was a welcome addition on the warm nights.  The fresh eggs, laid by their chickens, were a nice touch."
442487,43963060,2015-08-23,5850792,Alayne,"The studio was cozy, clean, and conveniently located near bars, cafes, markets, as well as public transportation. Margot and Anthony were great hosts, who were very accommodating and available for communication. There are chickens in the backyard and they even gave us some of their fresh eggs! We had an overall great stay and would definitely come back."
442487,45054070,2015-08-31,979150,John,The Lovely Studio is Lovely!  We really enjoyed our stay here so much. Check-in and check-out were super easy and the place is quiet and clean. Good access to everything you need. Highly recommended.
442487,45459519,2015-09-03,25522875,Kathryn,"The Lovely Studio was indeed lovely. Nicely furnished and a functional space. Great location and easy to access downtown. The welcome pack was particularly helpful to get out bearings and to find local attractions.
I would recommend the studio to anyone staying in Seattle.
Due to conflicting timings we did not meet our host, however all interactions were timely and very helpful. "
442487,46616467,2015-09-12,41217930,Eileen,"The studio was great--clean, comfortable and had all the essentials, and was in a lovely neighborhood with a short walk to fun, eclectic Capitol Hill. The hosts checked in on us via texts a couple times and were always willing to provide anything we needed, yet were unobtrusive so we really had the place to ourselves.  "
442487,47035776,2015-09-15,35178340,Adam,"Margot was extremely nice and helpful and able to quickly resolve any issue at all. 
Great quiet neighborhood & close by to all sorts of shopping and food needs. 
A very nice stay. "
442487,47459875,2015-09-19,26256667,Kate,"The listing was exactly as listed. We had minimal contact with the hosts, which was fine for us. She did send a message to check in the second day to make sure everything was ok, which I appreciated it. Everything was clean and comfortable. The neighborhood was very pretty but very residential, not necessarily a lot of super close, walkable businesses nearby. We were charmed by the chickens. 

My only complaint- not a lot of privacy. Many of the windows did not have window treatments at all, so not only did the sun come in, but you could see directly in to the main space, including the bed area. It's a garden level apartment so anyone walking by at ground level can look right in. The only way to have total privacy is to go in to the bathroom and shut the door. The bed was completely visible by multiple windows. We also got a parking ticket on the street for parking within 10 feet of a driveway, which we had no way of knowing was a law. Kind of a bummer."
442487,48380127,2015-09-26,28698292,Dean And Angie,"We had a phenomenal stay in Seattle. The apartment was clean and cozy and all the necessities were provided. Upon arriving, we were greeted with a hand written note from Margot and fresh eggs from their chickens. The location was perfect; in a quite neighborhood only steps from local eateries and buses that could whisk us off to every corner of the city. Margot was a great host, making sure we had everything we needed and providing lots of suggestions for quirky and unique Seattle sites. They love their city and it is infectious. This is a perfect choice if you want to take time to enjoy the wide variety of experiences Seattle offers."
442487,48901406,2015-09-29,18336242,Daniel,Margot and Anthony made us feel welcome.  They even have a charming and useful basket of goodies in case you misplaced a toothbrush - quite a nice touch.  The studio is walking distance from tasty eateries and the shopping venues. We found the place to be clean and spacious and the WiFi works well.  
442487,50084847,2015-10-09,3463865,Carmen & Kyle,"Super clean, comfortable, cute and relatively economical. Both Margot and Anthony were very nice and made themselves available if we needed anything. We loved having a full kitchen with ample dishes and cookware, and it was wonderful to be in a place that welcomed our little pup. The neighborhood is quiet, residential and very pretty, though it is about a 20- to 25-minute hike to the Pike/Pine center of Capitol Hill. Overall a great experience."
442487,51260853,2015-10-19,28283151,Megan,"We had a great time staying in Margot and Anthony's studio. The location was great for touring the city and it was the perfect size for my me, my husband and our three year old daughter. Very comfy and we'll equipped:) We especially enjoyed the chickens;) Highly recommended!!!"
442487,51906537,2015-10-25,20987690,Christian,"What a fantastic experience we had in Seattle. Location of this Studio was top notch. Many Shops and restaurants just up a few blocks. Many restaurants and even a nice pub just one block away. The place is cozy and has everything you may need on your stay. Great access to public transit, although the Seattle transit system could be better. Ended up taking lyft and uber everywhere. They were able to pick us up within 3-4 minutes every time as this is a very central location to everything. If you clean up after yourself you can save yourself a cleaning fee which is fantastic. We had all appliances available to us, although we did not use any as we visited Seattle to try out their great food and coffee! Overall I cannot recommend this place enough."
4832481,30902922,2015-04-28,31377168,Susann,"Judith, Gary and Mocha made us feel welcome from the moment we arrived. Our room was very cozy and the breakfast was good, too. Especially Judith's self-made gem was a highlight every morning. :)

The neighborhood is very beautiful, quiet and peaceful. The only thing we heard from time to time were school kids playing outside.

So thank you for everything and maybe we'll meet again! :)"
4832481,33384001,2015-05-27,31971170,Maki,"Judith and Gary are really wonderful hosts! From the moment I walked into their house, their shining smile and a cup of hot organic coffee already made me feel at home!! The room was clean and cozy, so was the shower room, with organic shampoo, conditioner and soap. I felt really relaxed and healed by their friendliness and warmness.
As a traveler, I was helped by the information they supplied about the city and was able to enjoy my time in Seattle. There are three things really worth pointing out:
1.    The #7 bus stop is really only 3 minutes from their house. I just bought an ORCA card and made use of public transportation for most of my travel in Seattle, including the ferry ride to Bainbridge Island!
2.    Judith is not only a writer but also architectural tour guide of the Seattle Central Public Library, and a certified UBER driver. She knows the city very well; this means I could have her very reasonable paid-service to drive me to specific places that I wanted to visit! Helpful and useful for travelers who want to use their time more efficiently in an enjoyable, and safe way.
3. On occasion they offer ""table d'hôte"" where guests join the hosts for dinner for a fee. Typically a Mediterranean style menu with (in summer grilled) meat, fowl or fish, and vegetables. I enjoyed Judith's seasonal salmon and a bottle of wine I bought in Pike Market with them one evening.  Another day I got a taste of Judith's pumpkin muffins with my coffee. These are really wonderful memory of my time stay in their home.
 
I feel very happy that I made the right decision connecting with this friendly and interesting couple. If I say that because of them, I trust Airbnb more than before, you will understand how wonderful they are.
"
4832481,33716010,2015-05-31,33318857,Mary,"Judith and Gary are outstanding hosts! Their home is very warm and inviting. The bed was quite comfortable. Everything was very clean. Special touches included : a Godiva chocolate at the bedside, and delicious bread and homemade jams for breakfast, and interesting books to read. Judith gave excellent suggestions for restaurants and sightseeing locations. And Mocha was a friendly dog! We highly recommend their home if you are in the Seattle area. "
4832481,34318048,2015-06-07,32774746,Karen,"Judith made us feel so welcome!!  We had chocolates by the bed, yummy breads with her delicious preserves for breakfast, and a cheerful greeting each morning.  Thank you so much for providing us with a comfortable stay very close to our family in Seattle. :-)
Hope to see you again!!
Karen and Doug"
4832481,35581518,2015-06-20,33301364,Galina,"Judith and Gary are wonderful hosts. Everything that was described in the ad is accurate. They welcomed us like we're their friends and that warmth you can't buy. In 8 days of our stay, coffee ans artisan bread was always ready for us in the morning. We spent some time in good conversations and peaceful walks in neghorhood with their and our  dogs -Mocka and Bruno.
One thing I want to let everyone know that their house in not prepared for people with limited mobility. 
It was definately worth of price. Thanks again so much. Bruce and Galina "
4832481,36453610,2015-06-28,35921261,Alyssa,Judith made us feel very welcome in her home. She provided us with many helpful suggestions for places to eat and check out during our time in Seattle. We enjoyed our stay very much and would not hesitate to return here for a return journey!
4832481,38052603,2015-07-12,5520570,Tony,"Judith was a great host who offered information about the city and places to visit. The room was very comfortable and clean with views of trees which made it feel more pleasant. The proximity to downtown and the aiport was another comfort factor. Judith's  personal art work was another fascinating sight in the room, let alone her kindness to offer warm tea on the first night. I would stay again if given another opportunity. "
4832481,39182759,2015-07-21,35521294,Emerald,We had a comfortable stay with Judith and her family. The room is exactly as describe: view of pine tree and comfy bed. Her dog Mocha is friendly. She offered us figs from her trees in the morning!! Thank you for a wonderful stay!
4832481,39805312,2015-07-26,20931358,Katie,"Great stay with Judith (and Mocha!) We were in town for the Blue Jays vs Mariners weekend and couldn't have asked for better arrangements.  The place was very reasonably priced (our whole stay was less than one night's hotel fees), easy to get to, in a quiet neighbourhood, and about a 20 minute drive to downtown Seattle (avoided the I-5 and took a back way - highly recommend when the I-5 is backed up). 
We had coffee, tea, water, bread and jams available for us both mornings. The house was very clean. The bed was very comfortable. Judith was more than accommodating and very sweet.  
We were very happy to be your first Canadian guests! :)"
4832481,41988996,2015-08-10,34021962,Jacquelyn,"This was my first AirBnB experience and it was better than I could ever hope for.  My daughter and I stayed Judith and Gary and felt so welcome.  The room was cozy and the bed was very comfortable.  I enjoyed looking at the art that's displayed throughout the home (and talking about it too). 
Judith gave excellent suggestions for restaurants, and things to do and see (even tailoring some to suit my 12 year old). 
Every morning there was an assortment of coffee, tea, bread, and jams.  
We felt so taken care of during our stay with Judith and Gary and if given the opportunity, we would love to stay again."
4832481,43151572,2015-08-17,39547374,Natalie L.,"Judith was a very warm and attentive host for us. She was very helpful with our luggage situation. Her home was very colorful, comfortable, clean, charming, and peaceful. We especially loved sitting by the dining room window, looking down into her beautiful yard. We had a fun Sunday morning chat, getting to know each other and lots of interesting stories to share!

Coming into Seattle, we did have one bus transit miscommunication in finding our way from the instructions, which Judith was very attentive to correcting and working through with us. 

We really enjoyed the character of her neighborhood and the short walk to Kubota Gardens on the way to the bus stop a couple blocks from her house. We have fond memories of our Seattle adventure and staying with Judith and happily stay with her, Gary, and Mocha again!
"
4832481,45705551,2015-09-05,12813027,Brigitte,"Judith and Gary made us feel very welcome and like part of the family.  She went way above and beyond an awesome host!! She was very knowledgeable about Seattle and helped us find our way around the area many times and told of great places to eat and visit while here. 
Judith & Gary provided an awesome continental breakfast with homemade jam and bread and delicious coffee!! The neighborhood was very quiet. We would definitely stay again if in the area. We were visiting our son who is in the military.  Thank you Judith & Gary! We had a great time staying at your place! And we loved Mocha! :) "

You can be downtown in 20 minutes and the bus is right outside the house. Joel and Sarah are really welcoming, with beers in the fridge and ready to help if needed! I would definitely recommend staying at their place."

They were lovely hosts, and even sent a nice Christmas note and some flowers to welcome our out-of-town guests during the holidays.  We would definitely stay here again. "

I definitely recommend to stay here☺️"
6079131,31667574,2015-05-08,29125824,Janna,Victoria and Josh are great! The place is  clean and comfortable and across the road from an awesome park. Neighborhood is great!

It was so much more personal than a hotel. Thanks for the chocolate and sparkling water, too!! I can't wait to come back to Seattle again and would definitely stay here again!!! Victoria was also accommodating to our crazy schedule -- THANKS !!!"
6079131,33457745,2015-05-28,7883993,Tammy,"Very convenient location in West Seattle. This place was super cute, clean, safe, and quiet. "

6079131,35304665,2015-06-17,14755087,Phuong,"The Two Towers Guesthouse is a comfortable space with very cute decor, exactly as pictured in the photos. We loved the natural lighting and the surrounding neighborhood was quiet and peaceful. The location of the place was very convenient - short drive to downtown, with restaurants, cafes, and convenient stores nearby. No issues with parking. 

Victoria was a great host and very responsive. We had lots of privacy, but Victoria was available if we needed anything.  "
6079131,35572418,2015-06-20,10827848,Meghan,"The Guesthouse was great! It was easy to find, very clean and inviting. I was a bit wary about the bed, but it was actually very comfortable and plenty big enough for my mom and myself. I was also a bit worried we would have trouble finding parking, but again, it was no trouble. There were several spots right in front of the Guesthouse. "
6079131,35797805,2015-06-22,28288947,Ed,"As described. Clean, neat and very adequate for our one night stay.  No negatives.  No problems."
6079131,36675445,2015-06-30,32530094,Michael,"This is a beautiful little studio; lots of natural light, and pleasantly decorated. It has a very nice little kitchen, with all the necessary cooking utensils. The only time I needed something during the week I was there, Victoria responded quickly.

The location is ideal. West Seattle is one of Seattle's quieter neighborhoods. There is a bus stop out front with a line that travels the length of West Seattle and through SODO and Downtown. The Rapid Ride C line is also a short walk down the hill for quick access to downtown. Just across the street is camp long; with some of the nicest walking trails in the city. And there are several grocery stores withing walking distance for those of us who prefer not to eat out.

I will definitely recommend The Two Towers Guesthouse to anyone visiting Seattle."

6079131,37659132,2015-07-09,18289950,Steve,"Victoria's place was perfect.  We had a late arrival, and getting into the place was easy - plenty of on street parking right in front of the house.  The bed was amazingly comfortable and all ready for us.  She had a great selection of teas and coffee, and the space was very well done.  The neighborhood was great as well - staying here allowed us to get a good feeling for the area and find a place to stay permanently.  There were Seattle guidebooks, water in the fridge, and everything else you might need.  We didn't get to meet Victoria, but we were happy with our stay."
6079131,38004330,2015-07-12,15276215,Stephanie,"This clean, modern studio was perfect for our time in Seattle! The neighborhood is adorable and is situated about 10-15 outside of the city which was perfect for us. We loved having access to a kitchen sink and a French press - we've been on a road trip for the last week and those home touches were a perk! Finding the place was easy and Victoria was great! Hidden gem, seriously! "
6079131,38269622,2015-07-14,31186084,Grafton,The location is wonderful and the proximity to the bus made getting around Seattle very easy. We greatly enjoyed our stay here and we were very comfortable in the studio. Would definitely go back again!
6079131,38761737,2015-07-18,37336305,은선,숙소가 깔끔하고 아늑했다. 주변이 조용해 휴식을 취하기에 가장 적절한 장소였다. 집 앞에 버스 정류장이 바로 있어서 교통에도 불편함이 없었다. 또 오고싶은 그런 숙소다.
6079131,40345744,2015-07-30,36627056,Christy,"My husband and I stayed in the Two Towers Guesthouse on the first leg of our Northwest honeymoon. The studio was adorable and very comfortable! We especially appreciated being able to check-in early. Our flight from Newark landed at 10am PST, so we were exhausted and glad to be able to rest and freshen up before heading out to explore the city. The Two Towers' listing is very accurate. Conveniently located in West Seattle, we enjoyed grabbing sandwiches and milkshakes at Husky Deli on California for lunch and then heading over to Trader Joe's to pick up some snacks for our trip. And then we went to Alki beach to walk around and relax; so great to have a little beach not even 10 minutes from the studio! On our second day we went downtown. Getting into downtown/central Seattle to visit Pike Place, the aquarium, Space Needle, etc was very easy. We drove in during morning rush hour and it still only took us about 20-25 minutes at the height of commuting time. Not bad at all! Victoria & Josh were very helpful in offering us suggestions for how to get around town. Driving around the neighborhood is very simple, but there's also a bus line that stops right outside the house. And we loved all the little touches in the studio--shampoo and conditioner in the shower, as well as q-tips and tissue available. And coffee and tea. We had everything we needed! The Two Towers was much more comfortable and a much better value than staying in a downtown hotel. We'd definitely recommend staying with Victoria & Josh. It was a perfect start to our honeymoon!"
6079131,40919526,2015-08-03,254076,Carlynn,The space is perfect and quite. Amazing use of the guesthouse with kitchen and perfect bathroom. Victoria was easy to get a hold of and flexible. 
6079131,41332894,2015-08-07,14315837,Blair,"My husband and I really enjoyed this comfy, clean and modern guest house.  No complaints - Victoria was very flexible with my check in/out times and replied quickly.  Within walking distance to Junction - lots of good restaurants/shops near Alaska/California.  Great neighborhood that's not too far from downtown.  The great outdoor space and french press were great bonuses!"
6079131,46598039,2015-09-12,28649034,Martha Eugenia,"Fue agradable, los anfitriones preparan tu estancia con detalles para el propósito de tu viaje. Tenian guias de la ciudad, lo esencial en la cocina que no venden en pequeñas cantidades: aceite, sal, jabones, cafe.... En fin están pendientes de sus huéspedes pero son muy discretos ."
6079131,47972970,2015-09-22,38901831,Anita L,"This sweet little studio was exactly as billed. It has a clean, modern, uncluttered design with plenty of closet space perfect for someone like me who was staying in Seattle an entire week. The bedding was nice and warm and the bed itself quite comfortable. The studio had everything I needed to enjoy my week long stay from an electric kettle for use with the provided tea, coffee and french press to all the utensils needed to enjoy a home cooked meal to help offsite all the restaurant dining. Speaking of which, I contacted Victoria early on in the process for recommendations for places to eat and she promptly responded with several options in the West Seattle area as well as further afoot. 

After using the shower the second day there, I discovered an issue with a slow drain. The next afternoon, I sent Victoria an email just letting her know and it was resolved while I was away at dinner later that afternoon. Upon my return that evening, I found a lovely bottle of wine awaiting me and a note apologizing for the inconvenience. A very nice and unexpected touch!

Fair warning though, if you, like me, need to watch a little TV to wind down before bed, there is no television in the unit. However, there is WIFI so you can easily stream something on a laptop or mobile device. 

As of the location, it only took me 10 minutes by rental car to get from the studio to downtown Seattle where my conference was. Trader Joe's, Safeway, RiteAid are all just minutes away. So are plenty of great bakeries and eateries.

I would stay here again without hesitation and will recommend it to anyone I know traveling to Seattle. "
6079131,48472276,2015-09-26,28302210,Julie,My stay at Victoria's was great! The place was clean and comfortable. The location was perfect as well. We weren't too far from Downtown Seattle but we were far enough away from the busy traffic as well. It was perfect! I would recommend this place to my friends for sure! 
6079131,49317971,2015-10-03,38108793,Jeff,"Victoria's guest house was perfect for our week long trip to Seattle. The place was clean and well-kept. Although we never met Victoria, she provided us thorough directions to get in a few days before our trip. West Seattle itself was great as well. It was only a 10-15 minute drive to downtown, but we found that there was also quite a bit to explore around Victoria's. I highly recommend staying here, and I would definitely stay here next time I plan a trip to Seattle."
6079131,50010939,2015-10-08,44277532,David,"Thank you for allowing me to stay in your lovely apartment in West Seattle. I had a very nice stay. Your place is clean, comfortable and organized. You are conveniently located by everything one could hope for while traveling in your teriffic city. Blessings to you and your's and I hope to come back soon. 

The only negative of my trip was not in your control, and that was that the bridges into east Seattle really confuse the GPS apps on my phone.

Dave Mount"
6079131,50496314,2015-10-12,44049986,Jessica,"Amazing hosts, beautiful space, and one fantastic trip!  A big thank you to Victoria and Josh for their hospitality and for creating a great place for visitors to Seattle.  We got in pretty late on our first night, and it was such a welcome surprise to find our bed ready and waiting for us.  In addition, Victoria & Josh remembered that we were celebrating my son's birthday that weekend and left him a chocolate bar present.  Made his day!  Thank you for sharing your space with us."
6079131,50986592,2015-10-16,46245685,Greg,"Listing description was as described and the neighborhood felt safe. 
The host responded quickly with all the information I needed for my stay."
6079131,51472174,2015-10-20,44943782,Ally,"We loved The Two Towers Guesthouse!! We had such a great experience here and would 100% stay here again next time we come to Seattle. It is a bit aways from downtown which is where we spent the most of our time, but we used Uber and Car2Go to travel the 15 minutes in downtown then would walk around from there. The guesthouse is a beautiful and quiet area and it was a perfect size for us! Very clean and modern! Thanks again for Joshua and Victoria :)"
6079131,52107795,2015-10-26,45330485,Vincent,"Josh and Victoria are excellent hosts! My girlfriend and I visited Seattle for the first time and they gave us many recommendations for activities and food places, which was welcome and helpful. The guesthouse was spotless and has all the amenities that we needed and more. Their quick responses, accommodation, and quality of their guest house were more than we could ask for; we would highly recommend them to anyone who is visiting Seattle. "
6079131,52617620,2015-10-31,2521861,Lauren,Victoria made the whole process a piece of cake! We loved the area and were able to easily walk to the Junction for loads of good food. The guesthouse was clean and we were introduced to the awesome stairway walks of Seattle through one of the guidebooks available in the apartment!
6079131,55401326,2015-12-01,42612631,Ellen,We had a fantastic time in Victoria's upstairs apartment! We were just moving to Seattle and needed a place for the entire month and this apartment was perfect for that. We had great access to bars and restaurants while still being on a quiet block. 
6079131,56265737,2015-12-11,45151093,Gaurav,"We had a great time at Victoria's place. She made us feel at home. Bed was very comfortable. Even the washer and dryer were not listed in the amenities, she allowed us to use it. Their was only 1 flaw, internet speed was not that good at times. In totality, it was awesome place and we would like to visit again."
6079131,56531511,2015-12-14,49866106,Kymberli,It was a great space. ❤❤❤ how it is decorated. The space does a good job of capturing the spirit of W.Seattle!  I adore the bathroom and kitchen. Victoria and her husband are sweet as pumpkin pie and very flexible (which is helpful for unorganized folks like myself). Thanks for everything!
6079131,58033703,2015-12-31,49377302,Doug,"A very nice private studio apartment with all the amenities you'd need for an extended stay.  West Seattle is a great neighborhood, walking distance to lots of restaurants.  The futon is on the floor which is tough for those of us with grey hair to get in & out of bed, but otherwise a good choice."
7678814,45136874,2015-08-31,7284694,Chandana,"Alex's place was exactly as advertised.  Clean, comfortable, and close to the Convention Center.  I had a great stay and would recommend the place to anyone else."

7685745,47007892,2015-09-14,17899051,Ben,Sarah was a great host! Very flexible and great at communicating. The house was peaceful and in a good location. The room is private enough and there was a variety of food/coffee/tea for breakfast as well. Overall a nice experience.
7685745,47839847,2015-09-21,15466027,Thomas,"Staying at Sarah's was a wonderful experience.  You can tell that she takes this very serious, and has thought through the Airbnb experience, making certain that every detail is covered.  I hope to spray there again in the future, and will recommend it to anyone I know traveling to Seattle. "
7685745,48227863,2015-09-24,21252101,Jackie,"Sarah was incredibly helpful, providing us with recommendations, transit tips, and even some personalized maps to help us get around. Her space is beautiful, clean, comfortable, and very very close to a bus stop. The neighborhood is residential with lots of interesting/beautiful houses, and you can walk over to the shops/restaurants in Capitol Hill in 20 minutes or so. We couldn't have asked for a better stay or a more friendly host. Thanks again!"
7685745,48450397,2015-09-26,5423608,Mike,"We enjoyed everything about this stay. Sarah provided breakfast food an coffee, which was a great addition. The house is located near downtown in a nice neighborhood. The check-in process was smooth. "

7685745,49664003,2015-10-05,43870324,Kirsten,"Sarah was very helpful, offering my boyfriend and I insightful tips and tricks for the area, including a cute and personalized map with nearby restaurants. Her space is airy, clean and comfortable. The room provided was spacious enough for the two of us, and was well suited even for a longer stay such as ours. The house is in a nice location, with on-street parking a huge plus as we came in from a little out of Seattle but wanted to have a car to get around. Sarah was always respectful of our comfort and space, and was friendly and engaging whenever around. "
3968416,18770366,2014-08-31,13591038,Anna Lisa,"Martin & Carolyn's house is a lovely place. I stayed there with two friends for three days and we had a full apartment which was awesome. It was clean, cosy and comfortable. The whole place was just unbelievable und we felt like home. Carolyn and her family are very friendly, openminded and kindhearted people, they told us a lot of places to go, they gave us drives to the bus station and picked us up.

Planning to return to Seattle soon so will be back!  "

They are the best hosts you can ever imagine to have: helpful, very nice, great to talk to and always worried that everything is just perfect arranged while you are staying. The apartment is awesome. You will have a spacious and very clean bedroom, a nice kitchen and living room all for yourself and a beautiful shared bathroom. Everything is nicely decorated and you also will have a gorgeous view over Puget Sound. There is a bus stop just 5 minutes away which takes you Downtown in about 20 minutes. Lincoln Park, which is a must see, is reached also in just about a 5 minute walking distance. To sum up: I was so overwhelmed from this place and the people that I just booked it again!!! Very, very recommendable! "

3968416,21430877,2014-10-17,21623828,Cheryl,"I have nothing but wonderful things to say about staying with Martin & Carolyn. They were very accommodating and sweet, and went out of their way to help us find some of the best places to visit in town. This was my first time using Airbnb so I wasn't sure what to expect. Staying in someone else's house made me feel anxious, but after settling in and meeting these awesome people, it felt like home.

 I gotta say their house is a downright dream, tucked away from the hustle and bustle of the city without it being too far if you're feeling adventurous. But if not, hey, just relax at home, read a book, play some games, watch movies, etc. I actually found it hard to leave their house on time to go out because I just loved how cozy it felt staying there, haha. 

Highly, highly recommended. Would definitely stay there again! :)"
3968416,21606184,2014-10-20,21710956,Brian,"Amazing place, gracious hosts. I definitely recommend them and will consider staying there again next time I'm in the Seattle area!"

3968416,41989801,2015-08-10,16976571,Aleia,Carolyn and Martin were lovely and incredible hosts. They had 5 star accommodations with a homey feel. I was in town for a concert at Century Link and they helped me find the best way downtown and even had a recommendation for dinner! I would greatly recommend staying here if you're ever in the Seattle Area. You will not be disappointed and I would say it's exponentially better than staying at somewhere like the Four Seasons :)
3968416,42130062,2015-08-11,30127147,Andrew,Martin and Carolyn's home was as beautiful as advertised. They were both very accommodating and made my stay feel very welcomed.

3968416,42900501,2015-08-16,25666796,Lionel,"Carolyn and Martin were very welcoming. They were flexible about our arrival time (we were driving and arrived about an hour later than we expected). They gave us a tour of the space downstairs, which included the bedroom, a kitchen, a large bathroom, and a living room, all for our use. They had organic coffee and cream for us to use in the morning. The space was very tidy, beautifully decorated, and there was a lovely view of Puget Sound from the kitchen and living room downstairs. This was probably the best airbnb experience I have ever had so far. The house was beautiful, and the neighborhood was calm and only a bus ride away from the city. Carolyn drove us to the bus stop the first day and Martin drove us to the airport on the last day. Both Carolyn and Martin were friendly, open, and very easy to talk to.  "

264829,779355,2011-12-12,607714,Natnaal,"Keith's place was great. He was very responsive and only one phone call or text away if I needed anything. The place is really close to downtown and in a very central location. There is a parking spot right in front of the location and if you take public transit the bus and light rail stations are close. Keith also operates car & shuttle services so he can pick you up and drop you off at the airport and many other locations. The listing is exactly as it looks like in the photos and def could fit 5 + people comfortably. You can even save money by cooking at home and utilizing the many utensils that Keith provides. I definitely recommend this place. 
"
264829,799030,2011-12-21,1433427,Keli,Keith was a gracious host who left me to my privacy after showing me around and passing off the keys. This is a nice private apartment on the downstairs level of his house with it's own private access. The living room is cozy with a comfortable couch and chair. I got great sleep on the full bed and waking up to a kitchen to make breakfast was really great. Nice neighborhood to walk my dog around and it's close to any amenity you may need. I would stay at Keith's place again and recommend it to a friend. 
264829,813336,2011-12-29,155336,Chris,This was a nice place quiet and Keith was very friendly and helpful lots of room off street parking and great pressure in the shower. Thank you Keith.

264829,853544,2012-01-09,1563797,Gee Jin,"The place is really nice, loved the place.
I went there for weekend travel for my friends birthday party.
Since i had separate access, I didn't have to bother Keith at all when i came back at 2 in the morning.
His place is little off from the downtown, where touring area is, but it cost me only $15 including the tip for the drivier to get to the downtown where SAM is.:)"

264829,933169,2012-02-20,1632058,Kristina Kay,"Keith is a great host!  He is always available by phone whenever you need him.  His place is not far from downtown and pretty easy access to I-5 and 90.  My husband and I stayed there 3 nights with my parents and 2 babies.  For the cost and awesome service from Keith (who also has a transportation company that you can also use, btw...my parents LOVED!), it's a good deal and place!  I would definitely use again when needing more space while in Seattle!"
264829,975705,2012-03-06,1678211,Bill,"The apartment was nice and very roomy with 2 bedrooms, a full kitched, a full bath and even a washer/dryer.  The cable TV was extensive and there was a strong wifi signal.  It also had a great location,  It was easy to get to downtown, capital hill,,the U district and to the eastside,  yet it was in a nice, quiet and safe neighborhood.  Keith and Cherie were great to deal with and responsive to our request.  
"
264829,994590,2012-03-13,1682241,Zach,"The location was great and I hope to stay again. Keith was so friendly and we hope to take the bus tour with his party bus company next time, although we got a feel for it when he showed us around the inside :) They even supply a mini bar of sorts and toiletries to use. My girlfriend had a great time with the face masks and girlie stuff, thanks so much"
264829,1044792,2012-03-26,1850209,Mo,"Went here for the weekend and took some of our friends with us as well.  Keith was such a great host.  Communication was awesome, you can text the guy anything and he will respond quickly.  Need more paper towels or TP?  Just shoot a text while your out and about and when you come back, everything is restocked!  He even had many suggestions on places to go and seemed to be tied in with many Seattle businesses that that know him and his party bus company.  While we were there we also took advantage of the party bus service.  It was awesome to cruise around Seattle DT in a decked out shuttle bus, the driver was totally a cool guy; even took us to 7-11 for a ""refill.""  We told Keith what nightclub we wanted to go to and he arranged EVERYTHING.  Pick up/drop off time/spot, getting us on the list at the club, etc.  Fully TURNKEY service.  Will def. use the party bus again if we are ever in Seattle, not to mention a return stay in the suite.  All of my friends had a blast, thanks so much Keith"
264829,1346182,2012-05-25,2207843,Rohaj,Great place to stay...Keith is really cool.  Very close to downtown.
264829,1364270,2012-05-28,2216860,Helga,"My friends and I went to Seattle to watch the Mariner's Game and found this place. The place was nice and cozy.  Also, the neighborhood was quiet. Driving to downtown was not far at all. Keith & Cherie also offered us rides to downtown and to the mariner's game as well. Overall, great place to stay and wonderful hosts. I will definitely stay here again if its available next time we're in Seattle. "
264829,1453933,2012-06-11,1803693,Torrey,"The hosts were nice and the place was clean. The noise in the night from upstairs, particularly in the master bedroom, was horrendous. If you plan to be up for most of the night or if you are a heavy sleeper it would be fine. The kitchen was not well outfitted  so if you plan to cook anything you will need to ask ahead for specific equipment or make do with what is there. "
264829,1720984,2012-07-16,2645591,Art,Keith and Cherie are great!  They were both so friendly and accomodating.  Keith kept checking up on us to make sure we had everything we needed and that we were having a good time.   Keith and Cherie's place is in a very convenient location too since it is only a short drive away from downtown.  The Mount Baker Link rail station was only a 8 minute walk away  which is nice for when we didn't have a car.  I would definitely recommend staying with Keith and Cherie if you're going to visit Seattle.  The place is very cozy and has everything you would need to feel at home during your visit.
264829,1739492,2012-07-18,1343856,Omri,"The apartment was basic and nice, and enough for all our needs (family with 4 kids).
Keith and Cherie were lovely - they picked us up from the airport, and helped us get to the city center.
The only point to keep in mind is that it is far from the center - about half an hour each way.
Thank you for a lovely Seattle experience!"
264829,1778198,2012-07-23,2073371,Christina,"We stayed in Keith and Cherie basement suite for 4 days and 3 nights and had a wonderful time! We fit seven people comfortably and were easily accommodated for any amenities that were not first available in the space. I would definitely recommend staying here! Also, it is quite close to the downtown core and is a really nice area of Seattle to stay (website hidden). They have scrabble. Who doesn't love scrabble?"
264829,1836037,2012-07-30,46384,Lindsy,"I hosted a bachelorette party for 6 ladies and Keith and Cherie's basement suite was well euipped for our large group!  I loved that they had a sound system, computer, games and books!  It was really great to have a kitchen with knives/cups/all-the-things-we-didnt-think-about-bringing.  Keith kept in great contact with me and I got to meet he and Cherie.  They were so nice.  We also took advantage of their party bus which was SO FUN!  If you ever need a place or a party bus in Seattle, this is the place to stay!"
264829,1916619,2012-08-07,2952951,Jennifer,"Needs a very good cleaning and an upgrade to the falling apart furniture. The dresser in the master bedroom was falling to the side, the bunk bed in the 2nd bedroom swayed in the breeze, the shower curtain was full of mold, the kitchen and entire place needs an extensive scrubbing. It looks like someone lives there when its not being rented due to the amount of personal hygene items in the bathroom. The cleaning lady was there the day we checked in and if it was me she would be fired on the spot....what a horrible clean. We also had no cable which would have been nice to watch after long days with our kids taking in the sites and sounds of Seattle. After making a complaint Keith came down and tried to reset the cable box and then left saying he would come back down in a little bit to check, to which he did not. I sent a text the following morning after we had left stating it was disappointing. To his credit he did phone the cable company who was unable to fix the issue so he set up his computer and we were able to watch netflix when we came back that night. He also came down with a card and some cheesecake to appologize.  Now if that was the only issue with the place I could have accepted it, however it was just the icing on the cake. He asked if there was anything he could do and I said that I'd like to know what happens on Big brother that night, he said sure no problem. Needless to say I didnt hear anything from him. The pictures on the site need to be updated as the place looks different then the pictures on this site. There is no entertainment unit, there is no chair at what would appear to be a table. The yard was also littered in garbage and junk. We never did meet Cherie.  Keith was a very nice guy though and very personable. "
264829,1968699,2012-08-13,832736,Jess And Jonathan,"Keith & Cherie were very kind hosts - provided extra pillows when we requested them, arranged travel service for a night out and were very courteous of our privacy. The apartment itself was not quite the fully private experience I imagined - you definitely are living below a household and can hear it and the pictures are a bit deceiving as to the apartment's size & quality of furnishing - but it was a great value and in a convenient location for getting downtown. "
264829,2190345,2012-09-04,2283990,Andrew,"Great location (close to light rail), quiet neighborhood."
264829,2639763,2012-10-17,3067676,Tilly,"Convenient location, nice quiet neighborhood. My first stay at an AirBnB so I wasn't sure what to expect. Not the 'Hotel experience"" if that's what you are looking for. The place is sort of a basement apartment, it's nice enough but still needs a little bit of work to be called a Suite. Great if you're going out on the town with a few friends but wasn't perfect for my six day stay with family. Would've liked the porch cleared of stored clutter so we could've possibly had a backyard BBQ. Just my personal preference I guess. Overall the hosts were accommodating and friendly."
264829,2694777,2012-10-23,2978470,Simone,The So Journ Sistas enjoyed our stay at the Asphy Inner City Suite.  The location is perfect it allowed us to drive wherever we desired easily.  The  host were very kind and helped us navigate Seattle.  The accomodations were clean and well stocked.  We recommend the Inner City Suite highly!!
264829,2882205,2012-11-13,4085538,Nathalie,"We had an excellent time staying at the Private Inner City Suite. The space was clean and quiet. Keith and Cherie were very helpful, always ready with a recommendation of a place to eat and things to do while we were in town. It was about a 10 minute drive to downtown Seattle and Capitol Hill from the suite. We would definitely stay here again!"
264829,2917293,2012-11-19,3958124,Mimi,"I and several friends stayed for the weekend. A great place to stay, quiet and clean, close to where we needed or wanted to be, kind and informative hosts. "
264829,3162794,2012-12-27,3998381,Lyle,"Spent a week with the family in December - 2 parents, 2 adult children. Apartment was serviceable, and hosts were very friendly and accommodating. The only thing preventing a more favorable rating is the unit itself. 

The unit is the remodeled basement of a small house. The walls and ceilings are thin and poorly insulated, so privacy is an issue. The beds (especially the upper bunk bed) are uncomfortable. The thermostat is controlled by the upstairs unit, so any adjustments require a call to the hosts.

The unit is located in the Beacon Hill area, which is south of the city center. The nearest light rail station is a pretty good hike away, so plan on renting a car (and paying the outrageous Seattle parking rates).

With cable, wireless internet, plenty of hot water, a full kitchen, and separate bedrooms, this unit is a lot better than camping, but it's not the Ritz either."
264829,3523537,2013-02-11,3334339,Anastasia,"Really cool couple, great place super close to the heart of Seattle and a good time! you feel private in your own space and if you need anything its just a text away. They are nice and welcoming, and very considerate and communicative. Thanks for all that! "
264829,5105412,2013-06-12,6440051,Sean,Prez and Cherie were great hosts and easily reachable. They even gave us a few beers on the house. The apartment is clean and comfortable and an easy drive into downtown Seattle.
264829,5630548,2013-07-08,3355873,Shay And J,"Prez & Cherie were very accommodating on such short notice.  Prez got back to me the same day and communicated with us throughout our stay. He even gave us some helpful tips to help us get around Seattle.  The place was spacious and clean with lots of great natural light! We'll def contact them when we visit Seattle again and hope they come stay at our place!
"
264829,5806327,2013-07-17,6177847,Dana,Prez was extremely accommodating and helpful.  He kept in touch with us throughout our visit.  The condo worked perfectly for our family of 5.  We enjoyed the walk through Beacon Hill to the light rail station.  Our favorite morning stop was the Station coffee shop.  Wish we could have stayed longer!
264829,5873346,2013-07-20,6362393,Cult,"Great hosts, a perfect stay."
264829,6141187,2013-07-31,5356125,Daniel,"Cherie was a great host, very very helpful and prompt. Even helped us to arrange for transportation the next day as we needed to get somewhere. The apartment was good for a night's stay, clean and probably what you need for a comfortable sleep. Could use with an bigger fan though as it was an abnormally hotter summer than usual in Seattle (well, at least that was what i was told) Its about a 10 minute walk to the nearby train to town. That was a plus. Its a pretty quiet neighborhood and the paths aren't really well done, so its not somewhere to take walks and etc. But besides that, it was a good stay. "
264829,6165176,2013-08-01,4534529,Sara,"Great place!  Pretty basic, but clean and comfortable, which is exactly what we were looking for.  Thanks so much"
264829,6926043,2013-08-30,3616541,Kat & Tonye,Prez and Cherie were awesome host! They definitely inspired us to step up our Airbnb hosting. Their place was comfortable and exactly what we expected. They were very responsive. We can tell they take great pride in their space. 
264829,8177875,2013-10-19,9075834,Eugene,"Prez and Cherie were very gracious and friendly. The place is really nice and a short walk to the lite rail and convenient to buses. Prez is very generous in the apartment with accouterments. The drive into town isn't bad either. When we were in a pinch on having to wait six hours between his check out time and the check in time of our next location, he graciously gave us more time.
Our snafu was that we contracted for a different unit (3000 23rd)  for nine days through Airbnb, and Prez said that he had to put us in a different place on Stevens and that the unit was already rented for the weekend in the midst of our stay. He put us up in a motel (and a substandard one at that) for the weekend. My wife is receiving chemo, is blind and diabetic, and we came from out of town with our car loaded for a three-month stay. It was very hard on us to move so many times when we contracted one place for the duration of nine days. Prez was remorseful and refunded $100 dollars, helped us move in the second time, but it didn't seem to be worth the inconvenience. I don't understand how airbnb and the housing owner could not be on the same page. It was all last minute for us, so we felt we had no recourse but to go along with it."
264829,14841811,2014-06-27,15877834,Ryan,Good location since it is close to the train. Everything was as expected.
264829,15995325,2014-07-19,8505385,Zachary,Prez is a great host. The place was comfortable.
264829,16276164,2014-07-24,2086374,Monte,"Properties were as described. Prez had very clear communication and very thorough ""getting to know you"" process including filling out a guest registration for each guest. Very smart as an owner/manager but an extra step in the reservation process. Prez was timely, accommodating and completely professional. The lower level unit really can hear any tenants in the floors above (this is disclosed by Prez prior to rental). Did not bother me as I can sleep through anything but one of our guests had issue with being woken up. Prez, thank you for your hospitality."
264829,19653777,2014-09-15,19702266,Chiho,The house was ready when arrived. The host was flexible with our arrival time and one we arrived there the check-in process was easy and straight forward. The neighborhood was convenient and comfortable for my family to stay in. The house was accurately described in the pictures available online.
264829,19863316,2014-09-19,17975813,Geoff,"Great host. This was a last minute trip, and they let me in very fast and were very accommodating. I would recommend."
264829,28179087,2015-03-19,28485297,Gele,nice place it stadies like home
315120,1067553,2012-04-01,484753,Allyssa,"My husband and I stayed at this lovely garden treasure while our house was being remodeled. Our hosts were flexible with our schedule (read: contractors and electricians have a pliable relationship with time/deadlines), which was a wonderful. The space is actually attached to their home, but it is very quiet and private. The space *feels* like someone with taste agonized over every detail, and I think that was probably the case during the remodel. The location is convenient, the bed is comfortable, there is tons of hot water and the washer and dryer are pristine. The hosts are great, the space is great, you will undoubtedly be very happy staying here."
315120,1322575,2012-05-21,1551206,Mike,"The lovely gardens are blooming at Rick's private cottage studio. Looks like they will remain gorgeous all season long. While it is a studio, the space is generous and the bath very spacious. Hosts are friendly, flexible and accommodating. The short garden path to the private front door is enchanting. The cottage is beautifully appointed with antiques, but has been updated from these pictures. There is now a nice large flat screen tv with cable, as well. Very clean, lovely, and well stocked to meet your needs. Would definitely enjoy another stay here on a return trip to Seattle."
315120,1423157,2012-06-05,2334154,Mychelle,"I very much enjoyed staying in Rick's studio that was very private and had views of gardens on both the front and back side. It is complete with everything you would need to have a fine time. The skylights add natural light which was very nice. It is quiet and the bed was very comfy. I would stay here again.
Mychelle"
315120,1472601,2012-06-13,1977115,David & Mary,"My wife and I thoroughly  enjoyed our stay at Rick's apartment in Seattle.  It is beautifully decorated, extremely comfortable and is located in a beautiful garden setting.  The furnishings and decorations appear to be antiques and there is always something new to discover.  Best of all, it is within a few blocks of our son's home.

Our hosts were gracious, and caring and made sure we had everything we needed.  We hope we will be able to stay with Rick during our next visit to Seattle."
315120,2071655,2012-08-23,1833841,Keith,"I stayed at Ricks wonderful garden studio for two months this summer while I was looking for a more permanent place to live after relocating to the Seattle area.  The place had a great location with super easy access to I-5 N & S bound.

Ricks home and gardens around the studio are an amazing sight - beautiful flowers and plants everywhere, patios, koi pond, berries!  I couldnt have asked for a better landscape and its very obvious Rick works very hard to keep it that way.

Inside the studio is extremely well taken care of and you can tell right away that there is great pride in the place.  Everything is just right, well thought out, and perfectly decorated.  The studio is attached to their home but always felt very private and was super quiet!

I would definitely stay here again and will recommend to anyone coming to the area.  They are super friendly and keep the place pristine.  Thank you guys again so much for having me!!
"
315120,2131403,2012-08-28,3322278,Nicole,"WOW! What a great experience we had staying at Rick's place. Rick was a gracious host with a beautiful home. The location of his home was great. His place had easy access to Hwy 99 (which is less traffic and easier to get to downtown than Hwy 5). His home was very cozy and beautifully decorated. He had all the amenities you could ever need in a charming place. The size was perfect and his yard was gorgeous and relaxing. As a host, he was nice to welcome us with a bottle of wine, fruit,  juice and a smile. We would definitely recommend Rick's place. The location, host and home are all 2 thumbs up. Thank you Rick for a pleasant experience. We will be back. . "
315120,2890954,2012-11-15,4052698,Rebecca,"From before we arrived, with Rick's thoughtful and helpful emails, to the night we got in, very late, and Jeff was there to let us in and show us around, to all the beautiful, comfortable, detailed aspects of their studio - we had a wonderful stay!  Not only was the space warm, clean, and tastefully decorated, but it also immediately felt like home.  While Rick and Jeff were very accommodating to our needs, they were also extremely respectful, unobtrusive hosts.  We felt we could easily rest from our travels, as well as use their space as an easy jumping off point to all that we wanted to explore in Seattle.  I would absolutely recommend their space to anyone looking for ease, beauty, and comfort in North Seattle."
315120,4466537,2013-05-06,6172441,Becca,"It was wonderful to stay with Rick and Jeff, their house is beautiful and we had no problems getting to downtown quickly.  "
315120,4885860,2013-05-31,1977115,David & Mary,"We stayed in Rick Wilson's beautiful b&b last week, and had a great experience.  It is large, spick & span clean, and every possible amenity is provided.  We loved the gardens & koi pond, as did our grand-daughter who visited us there.  It was our second time to stay there and we would go again any time."
315120,5233046,2013-06-19,91381,Antje,"Rick and Jeff are amazing hosts, very warm and welcoming. The apartment is absolutely lovely. It has everything one needs for a comfortable stay plus a bottle of wine and a small fruit basket when arriving.  :)  It is a great peaceful location with a wonderful little front porch to just sit, relax and enjoy peace and quiet while listening to mother nature. Downtown is just a short drive or bus ride away. And everything from grocery store to restaurant and coffee shop is close by. I highly recommend this apartment and will stay there again when back in Seattle. "
315120,5582698,2013-07-07,357859,Michael,"We had a fabulous experience staying with Rick. We found him to be a most congenial host and his studio was clean, well apportioned, and had everything as promised and more. Our stay at Rick's was the last stop on a two week vacation and of all of the places we stayed through airbnb, his was the best, hands-down. "
315120,5764157,2013-07-15,7121439,Maria,My boyfriend and I decided to check out Airbnb for the first time and it was a great experience. Rick and Jeff are great hosts and the place is beautiful. We fell in love with their garden and enjoyed sitting out in the patio daily as it was so relaxing to be there! Public transportation was great and easy to manage. 
315120,6033765,2013-07-27,5519425,Hoang,"This was an awesome find, so much that I almost want to keep it to myself. One could tell the care that Rick and Jeff put into this place. It was a pleasure to stay there. The garden setting, the front and back area are splendid. Depending on the time of the year, you can wake up every morning to fresh strawberries & raspberries in the front and side garden. Just be careful of spiders, though. They love the garden, too."
315120,6091929,2013-07-29,6922074,Nanna,"We only stayed here for two nights, but the place was nice and clean, and we enjoyed our stay here. The apartment has a kitchen, which we didn't use, but it looked as if there was everything you might need, even a dishwasher.
The garden is well-kept and very cute and we tasted the raspberries and plums, like Rick invited us to do. 
The apartment is located in a quiet and very safe residential area. We didn't spend much time exploring the area, but it seemed a bit sleepy. However, access to downtown Seattle is very easy by bus, and the apartment is a good base for exploring Seattle. Rick was very welcoming and offered tips on the area. "
315120,7023845,2013-09-03,8068785,Sejal,"Rick was a wonderful host--very accommodating, friendly and responsive. The studio is exactly as pictured (bigger than we thought!) and very comfortable. I'd definitely recommend staying here. "
315120,7121496,2013-09-07,6352336,Dina,"Rick and Jeff went out of their way to make this an amazing stay in Seattle. First the accommodations were amazing. Very comfortable and cozy. It was very welcoming and relaxing after a long day of site seeing.  They gave us great tips on things to do, helped us coordinate travel, and made us feel at home. I would definitely stay there again. Such a gorgeous garden area as well. "
315120,7920598,2013-10-08,3072757,Ciaran,Had a great stay. Rick and Jeff were great hosts and everything was exactly as advertised. Great little place (with beautiful garden and outdoor patio) to stay North of Seattle. Highly recommend.
315120,9506757,2013-12-31,2535084,Kevin,"We had a wonderful stay at Rick and Jeff's beautiful studio. The apartment is large and very comfortable. The location is great, very convenient to downtown, but outside of the hustle and bustle. The hosts are very friendly and accommodating. We hope to return in the summer and see their beautiful garden in full bloom."
315120,10708852,2014-03-03,12518145,Heather,"Let me start by saying that this cottage exceeded our expectations! It was just perfect for us, and the location was central to everything. Jeff & Rick were wonderful hosts and kept in great communication with me. If I could rent this place by the month I would! You could tell the loRick & Jeff  put into this place. We are excited to visit when the gardens are in bloom. Just beautiful! "
315120,11097691,2014-03-20,12706371,Darrell,"Ricks spacious studio was an ideal place for Steven, my colleague from Pennsylvania, while we were working together for eleven days. It is exactly as advertised:  private, quiet, immaculate, amazing décor, great natural light, and you couldn’t ask for a better host."
315120,12871250,2014-05-12,6825361,Cynthia,"Rick and Jeff are fantastic hosts - Incredibly nice and extremely helpful. The apartment is perfect - seriously, I wanted to take up squatters' rights ;)  The entire space is so well laid out and comfortable and beautiful (once I got past the animal skins - hahaha).  It is very quiet and (email hidden)d you must go through the french doors to gaze at the koi pond.  Easy to get to as well.  I shall return."
315120,14055352,2014-06-10,10681676,Lauren,"Rick and Jeff are great. With the little interaction we had with them, they proved to be gracious and welcoming hosts. The studio is attached to the main house but is separated in such a way that it feels private, complete with a short trail through the side garden to a its own entrance. French doors open up to a shared patio + garden. They're in a central location but far enough from downtown Seattle to be out of the city proper -- just what we wanted. Very clean, handsomely decorated, and great hosts. Thank you!"
315120,14311686,2014-06-16,6549784,Andrea,"Rick was an excellent host. He planned to meet us before we arrived. He made his home, feel like our own. The studio apartment really was a pleasant hidden gem nestled in his backyard. A great retreat! We hope to return when we are back in Seattle."
315120,15815686,2014-07-16,13524350,Barbara,We hated to leave this beautiful home.  It was everything Rick said it would be and more.  He greeted us with a much welcomed bottle of wine and a tour of our very private apartment.  The décor is absolutely lovely with plenty of space.  Our hosts displayed great care in developing such a delightful ambiance.  There was something beautiful everywhere we looked.  We comfortably cooked many meals in the kitchen area and also used their very accessible barbecue often.  The bathroom was very spacious.  We really wanted to take the beautiful blue sink home with us!  This home is well insulated and we couldn't hear any noise at night.  It is a very quiet residential area with great freeway access.  We were on a 30 day Seattle vacation and went in every direction so this location was perfect for us.  Rick and Jeff were very considerate hosts.  We had all the privacy we wanted but we really enjoyed having a glass or two of wine and good conversations on the deck overlooking the koi pond.  We will be back late this year or next summer and look forward to staying here again.  
315120,16027385,2014-07-20,10088283,Luc,"Rick is a great host with excellent communication skill. He gave us a lot of useful information. His apartment is just what the photo shows. The room is full of animal art. The location is in a very quiet and safe community. It is 
convenient for self driving and just a bit walk to take a public transportation. Let me very surprised that is this apartment is just in the front of the Lakeside school that Bill Gates graduated from it. To sums up, it is a fantastic experience. Thx Rick again."
315120,16295286,2014-07-25,15440840,Kristen,"I highly recommend this garden studio.  Rick and Jeff are great hosts. Rick was extremely helpful and even made us chocolate chip cookies for us one rainy afternoon.  The accommodations are top notch. Everything is clean, well maintained,  and very comfortable. The location was convenient for numerous reasons. Its right next to I-5 and Rt 99. You can either drive or take the rapid ride into the city. Theres a park down the street and a great brewery nearby as well. We will definitely be calling Rick and Jeff the next time we plan a trip to Seattle."
315120,16549931,2014-07-29,15571574,Jill,"As you can see, Rick has received superlative reviews to date.  We would add our superlatives to that growing list. The garden studio is incredibly tastefully appointed. Walking down the beautiful garden path to the door begins your experience. Upon entering the studio, you are met with painstakingly gathered furnishings that give the feeling of an upscale hotel, yet are immediately welcoming. The bed was very, very comfortable. The full kitchen is well stocked with everything you would need to eat in, or serve as your breakfast/nosh center during your Seattle explorations. The large bathroom is completely, comfortably usable with a great shower. The access to the back patio/koi pond is right out the patio doors, and we loved the relaxing sounds of water and birds in addition to bringing fresh Seattle air to our breakfast table. Adding fresh blueberries, raspberries or strawberries in season to your granola is but a few steps away. If you are traveling by car, parking in this neighborhood is a breeze as compared to what you will find in many Seattle neighborhoods. If you are using public transportation, the studio is located close to bus lines that will take you in many directions in the Seattle area. The studio is located in a great neighborhood more conducive to relaxation than you would find in a more downtown spot, yet within easy distance of many Seattle highlights. Rick is a caring yet unobtrusive host, and if you were to think of anything you needed that he hasn't already thought of (unlikely), I'm sure he would be at your service. Our thanks go to our hosts for a lovely visit, and we look forward to telling friends and family about the garden studio."
315120,17055173,2014-08-06,16945188,Melanie,"Rick was there to great us when we arrived and show us around.  There was coffee, creamer and fresh fruits for our first morning and a great bottle of wine for the evening.  The studio is even better than the pictures, it is a beautiful place. Thank you for making our stay in Seattle that much better."
315120,17312896,2014-08-10,2780252,Sophia,We had a wonderful stay. The apartment was clean and comfortable and the hosts were exceptional. I particularly appreciated the personal tour of the garden from Rick.
315120,17667337,2014-08-15,7773757,Pippa,The reservation was canceled 4 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
315120,17722408,2014-08-16,6511226,Diane,Everything was exactly as noted by Rick. It was delightful location and a great space. Very Responsive and goes extra mile to make your stay memorable!!Highly recommend!!! 
315120,17967598,2014-08-19,19403022,Michaela,"We stayed for 3 days and were very happy!  The apartment looks just like the pictures, and it was perfect for me and my daughter.   The location was great with easy access to the highways, and we hopped in our rental car each day and went off to explore beautiful Seattle.  Ballard is a short drive for lots of restaurants, and the sunset at Carkeek Park nearby (Rick's suggestion) was gorgeous!  Rick and Jeff couldn't have been nicer, and we are so glad we found this little gem!"
315120,18328157,2014-08-25,264551,Isis,We had an absolutely delicious stay here. In fact two hours into being at this yummy studio we were already trying to figure out when we could come back and stay again. 
315120,18667715,2014-08-30,4161253,Jennifer,I absolutely loved staying at Rick's. The space is really beautiful and very comfortable and quiet. It felt just like home. The gardens around the front and back porch are breathtaking! Parking is right out front. Rick was also very helpful at suggesting places to go in the area. Carkeek Park and Ballard are not too far away and are definitely worth checking out! My dinner at The Walrus and the Carpenter in Ballard was one of the best I've had. I was spending most of my time in Woodinville so wanted something conveniently located and not too far from the city. This was perfect. I will definitely stay here again if I'm back in the area. 
315120,18897610,2014-09-02,17608321,Beatriz,"Rick's place was very nice, exactly what is depicted in the pictures. Spacious and comfortable, with beautiful leather furniture, ample kitchen and great bathroom facilities. Since our stay was short, we did not use the washer and drier but they are definitely a plus for our type of travel (hiking in the National Parks). The room was apart from the main house which was nice as it gave us privacy. The gardens and back yard deck were lovely. Rick was also a great host and was quite welcoming. We had a car which made it easy for us to head in and out of downtown Seattle, however commute time to downtown by car is rough in rush hour. We did not use public transit. "
315120,19627424,2014-09-15,20447961,Denise,"my husband and I came to Seattle to visit our daughter who is there doing a 6 month internship. We were welcomed by Rick, he is very prompt with response! He greeted us with a big sincere smile. We loved the place! Very comfortable and very clean! We grilled on the ""garden patio"". It is very private and peaceful. We also enjoyed a cup of coffee with Rick on our last morning! Hope he didn't mind us joining him out on the sunny patio! he was also most helpful with our questions of things to do. I would certainly stay here again! Just wonderful experience! "
315120,20098414,2014-09-23,6660762,Elizabeth,"I spent a lovely week in this apartment unit.  Although attached to the main house, it is accessed by a separate entrance off the driveway.  It is spacious, clean and comfortable, as is the lovely garden and patio just outside the patio door.  The unit came with coffee, juice, fruit, and a variety of items in the cupboards that made cooking here a breeze.  I would definitely stay here again on a return trip to Seattle."
315120,20394035,2014-09-28,6511226,Diane,"Another great experience! ! So appreciated the restaurant recommendations.  Ricks place is perfect place to have privacy, lots of room abs ready access to freeways etc."
315120,20541786,2014-09-30,17691416,Sarah,"This is such a lovely oasis. Safe, quiet, private, a beautiful garden to look at through the French doors, a wonderful kitchenette with everything you could possibly need. Be warned: you will never want to get out of this bed, it is so cozy. Rick was hands-on and very accommodating, even leaving a bottle of wine, fruit and orange juice. I had to leave early because my allergies were acting up, but wish I could have stayed all month."
315120,21187133,2014-10-12,14303879,William,"Rick's place was absolutely amazing. He and Jeff are wonderful hosts. From the walkway in, you feel like you're in a home of your own. The studio is tastefully decorated and the bed + sheets are super comfy. Rick even provided fresh fruit and wine for my stay! The studio comes with a stove and refrigerator and a washer/dryer. I didn't spend much time out in back, but there is a beautiful koi pond and chairs to do work/relax out there as well.This place is perfect for a home away from home and I wouldn't hestitate at all to stay here again. "
315120,21966679,2014-10-27,20447961,Denise,We were excited to come back to our second home! It was immaculate as last stay! Rick is very welcoming host! Our daughter will be done her internship in seattle in two months but if we ever come back a third time to the area ; would stay at this wonderful and homey place!!
315120,24799328,2015-01-02,19932361,Arthur,A wonderful host and fabulous space! I will be back. I appreciated all the extras. Thank you!
315120,27890414,2015-03-14,28291706,Barbara,A FABULOUS place to stay with perfect hosts. This has worked perfectly for me while I am remodeling my house. All the furnishings are top quality and so tasteful. My friends LOVE the place also. I would stay here again in a heartbeat...but I don't want to remodel again!!! Convenient to everything.
315120,32610257,2015-05-19,10576610,Marjorie,"This large, comfy, light garden studio is a perfect place for one or two people. The listing is completely accurate and the accommodation is excellent in every way -- it's roomy, very nicely set-up, immaculately clean, and equipped with everything you might want to have a very comfortable stay. The studio is attached to the owners' residence, but the windows look out on garden areas, and it feels totally private. The location is great for northern Seattle or Shoreline. Rick met me when I arrived and was most friendly and helpful. I would highly recommend."
315120,33182736,2015-05-25,33476757,Carolyn,Rick met us as soon as we pulled in to their house.  The apartment was just as described...and just what we wanted.  Rick has thought of everything to stock this special get-away with-fresh cream for coffee in the morning?!  Wine and other little goodies too : )
315120,33859061,2015-06-01,21764091,Carly,"this was the loveliest experience.  rick met me as soon as I arrived and was so helpful and welcoming.  this space is incredible, you really need to experience it yourself.  it's beautifully decorated and very relaxing... there's a magical garden path, stars through the skylights and the sound of a waterfall in the koi pond.  I also had the pleasure of having coffee with rick and jeff one morning on the deck.  I hope to visit again soon."
315120,34101047,2015-06-04,6511226,Diane,"As usual- Rick was wonderful-- everything was ready - just perfect. 
He always has the place perfect. "
315120,34544748,2015-06-09,2948136,Lori Jo,"I highly recommend Rick's very comfy garden studio.  It was a wonderfully warm and welcoming place to stay.  Rick is a kind, genuine and caring host and he has a green thumb.  We enjoyed the gardens very much.  We were there in May with warm weather and the place was cool with a nice breeze through the space."
315120,34832738,2015-06-12,35304274,Cassandra,"My husband and I stayed at Rick's this past week and couldn't of had a better experience. There was someone checking out the day we were checking in but Rick allowed us to come early to pick up the key and drop off our bags so we didn't have to worry about keeping them in our car while out touring Seattle. When we returned we received the grand tour and were gifted a delicious bottle of wine, which was a great way to end the day. The studio is very well decorated the warm colors and quality furniture really made it easy for us to relax and enjoy the space. He really has thought of everything one would need or want during their stay, some of the niceties included an assortment of candies on the dining table to fresh cream and oj. We loved to open up the windows and french doors in the morning drinking our coffee and listening to the tranquil sounds of the birds and their gorgeous pond. Rick was very assertive during our stay but not intrusive. He even provided a recommendation of a really tasty Indian restaurant, Saffron. We really liked the location too, nearby there was a mall, restaurants, grocery stores and a short drive from downtown Seattle. This was our first AirBnB experience and are almost afraid he set the bar too high. We would definitely stay at Rick's again and would not hesitate to recommend his rental."
315120,35305243,2015-06-17,7316518,Natalie,"My husband and I spent 4 nights at Rick's cozy backhouse. It was such a great jumping off point for exploring Seattle and it's surrounding beauty. We cooked breakfast every morning and the kitchen had all the right utensils to accommodate that. We loved the comfy bed and slept great every night after long days spent hiking. Rick was super helpful when we asked him for hiking suggestions and activities in the area. We really enjoyed Whidbey Island ( about an hour north), Carkeek park (10 min), and snoqualmie falls (40 min SE). I would definitely say that you need a rental car to explore this area since it is about a 10 min drive into the downtown area. I would highly recommend Rick's comfy home!"
315120,35578319,2015-06-20,17351260,Jill,"Rick was an excellent host.  He was available by phone, let us check-in earlier than planned, and met us at our car to show us where to park.  The studio is just as pictured.  Beautifully appointed with elegant furniture and fixtures.  The bed was the most comfortable one we've stayed in and the bedding was very warm and cozy.  Rick spent a few minutes showing us how everything worked in the studio.  He also took time to ask us what we had planned and if we needed any suggestions about where to go.  We did and so he had maps and showed us the best places and made great suggestions.  There were a lot of amenities, nice washer/dryer complete with detergent, cream for coffee, orange juice and a bottle of wine just for us.  Lots of really nice touches like this.  The only negative that I can think of is there is some road noise, but it quiets down at night and didn't disrupt our sleep at all.  We would definitely stay here again and hope we do."
315120,35834223,2015-06-22,19873926,Undraa,"We enjoyed our stay at Rick's place, very cozy clean space. Great location. Definitely will return!  "
315120,36815068,2015-07-01,133663,Henry,It was a wonderful experience living at Rick's place. So quite and very peaceful.
315120,37192674,2015-07-05,7822628,Dustin,"We had a great stay at Rick's place. Loved the place! The apartment was super clean, quiet and very comfortable. Plenty of free parking right out front and the neighborhood was nice and quiet. Rick was very friendly and helpful and provided us with recommendations for things to do/see. The location was perfect for us since we had a car and did a lot of driving around to the different neighborhoods, but if you're looking to be in the heart of the action, you would have to drive or take the bus. Would definitely stay at Rick's place again. "
315120,38511709,2015-07-16,34862429,Samuel,"Rick was amazing. He was always very present and willing to help with anything we were curious about. He even fixed the bed the same day when we broke it (we were jumping on it or something). Ten out of ten, highly recommend."
315120,38879397,2015-07-19,36160813,Gregory,Rick was very welcoming.  This is beautiful place to stay – it had everything we could ask for.  We regret that we didn’t have more time to spend with Rick and Jeff.  We were blown away.  Another review expressed concern about road-noise:  We didn’t notice road noise.  We plan to return and recommend it to others.
315120,39349823,2015-07-22,29892360,Yihao,"We enjoy our two day brief stay at Rick's house! It's tide, clean, and located in a nice neighborhood. Rick is very friendly and helpful, he gave us a ""tour"" before we moved in. The decorations in the room are also very charming, and we love Rick's wildlife photo album!   "
315120,40206674,2015-07-29,27107238,Andrea,"I booked Rick's house for family who was visiting and it was perfect! Rick made sure the kitchen was stocked with soda, wine, fruit, snacks etc. which was so thoughtful and he met my family and helped get them settled upon arrival. He was fantastic responding to my requests and his place was so comfortable I think my family wanted to move in. It was the perfect place to book and it far exceeded my expections. Thank you so much Rick!"
315120,40545229,2015-07-31,11709610,Geoffrey,"Nice guy, great room. The landscaping is phenomenal."
315120,40834919,2015-08-02,9862425,Deanna,"We had a great stay at Rick's place. It was everything we needed and was very comfortable. Rick was very helpful, friendly and easy to work with. I appreciated that he let us check in a few hours early and he gave us recommendations on things to do around Seattle. Would definitely recommend!"
315120,41795465,2015-08-09,7937146,(email hidden),"The large comfy, light, garden setting apt. is the perfect name. Rick was an exceptional host. We were in the Seattle area for a weekend seminar and the apt. was perfect for our needs. It is a little farther out of the downtown Seattle area but it was well worth it. We love suburbs anyway. I felt very safe and it was quiet. I commented to my husband that we were at another conference that was held at a JW Marriott resort. This place was much nicer than our room at the resort. "
315120,43475972,2015-08-20,13524350,Barbara,"This was our second stay at Rick and Jeff's.  They are great hosts and made us feel very welcome.   Their very private home is filled with many beautiful paintings and art work.   This was a perfect location to visit any of Seattle's many attractions.  We enjoyed walking the area at the end of each day.  We had our own entrance with a small deck amidst lots of well kept greenery.  Plus a second shared entrance with a large deck, barbecue, lots of seating and a very peaceful koi pond.   Their landscaping is amazing.  We will be back next year for sure.  "
315120,45125565,2015-08-31,11370520,Nadia,"The garden studio is such a perfect little nest, it couldn't have been better. It is so well stocked with kitchen equipment, everything you need. The bed is so comfortable and I felt really at home. The location is great, very east to get around.
Rick is the perfect host, always there if I needed anything but very unobtrusive. I'm looking forward to coming back in December."
315120,47542257,2015-09-20,42824024,Abdullah,"we stayed couple of days in Rick's place. it was a wonderful experience. he was very nice host, he cooperate and response to us very quickly even when ha had a family emergency. also, the back yard was so beautiful."
315120,48813890,2015-09-28,25658678,Brenda,"Rick, Thank you for sharing your lovely studio as a b&b.  We really enjoyed our stay.  We loved the decor, quiet neighborhood, all the amenities, you were most accommodating during our stay.  Thank you!  And we hope to come down and stay again in the future."
315120,51573321,2015-10-21,43970693,Christina,"This was our first experience with AirBNB, and it was extremely positive. Rick's studio was charmingly well-appointed, very clean, and well insulated. The bed was super comfortable. The gardens and koi pond were beautiful. Everything looked just like the photos. Also the location in a quiet neighborhood was perfect. 
Rick was a fantastic host. The check in and check out went very smooth and Rick was always available by phone to answer questions.

Everything was perfect and we would definitely stay again should the opportunity arise."
315120,53087324,2015-11-04,45999090,Rex,"excellent, clean, up to date place in very nice neighborhood; close to everything in northern Seattle. full amenities and appears as new. host is very helpful and informative. highly recommend!"
315120,53398755,2015-11-08,47593697,Sue,Thank you so much for taking such wonderful care of our friends while they were in town - they LOVED your place and would come back in a heartbeat!
315120,54636643,2015-11-22,7920241,Mary,"I felt so at home in Rick's cozy, ""out of Africa"" studio. It was a chilly weekend outside, but settling in here at night, it was luxuriously warm and quiet. Every amenity has been considered, with great attention to detail.  I appreciated the fresh fruit, electric blanket, great lighting, 
the invitation to share the deck and view the koi in the outdoor pond. 
Rick is a welcoming host and genuinely good person.  Highly recommend staying here vs. central Seattle!  
"
315120,55045081,2015-11-27,48633530,Charity,"A true delight! My parents stayed here and said ""Send all of your your of town guests here. Seriously!"" Rick was helpful, kind, engaging and welcoming. The location is easy to access and the apartment is fun and private. Definitely will be booking there again! "
315120,57875562,2015-12-30,14413245,Patricia,"Rick was very accomadating and friendly on our arrival.  He was responsive to our few questions.  He had wine and treats for our stay along with juice for our first morning. 
The room was much more spacious than the pictures showed and we were very comfortable.  The location was ideal to getting around the city with our rental car.  The parking was easy and always available which was a plus.  We loved the privacy of the unit and the spaciousness!"
1984962,12343534,2014-04-29,4792762,Natalie,"We had a terrific stay-- literally, could not dream of a better lodging situation for a big group. Such a convenient location, excellent parking. The house had super plush luxurious beds and towels. Highly communicative, Mary even accommodated our request for a 7th guest and even the air bed they brought in for him was first rate (with a headboard!). Thank you for such a seamless, excellent stay."
1984962,13405739,2014-05-27,12428287,Owen,"Great modern house in a good location. The host was helpful, friendly, and dealt with with my questions quickly. Would stay here again."
1984962,14049367,2014-06-10,12699349,Amanda,"Great stay! The house had plenty of light and space and was very functional. Comfortable bed with nice sheets (felt like a hotel rather than sleeping in a random person's bed...). Plenty of clean towels, closets with hangers to hang up your clothes. Good location, very close to Capitol Hill. Note that there is no air conditioning, so sleeping on the stop floor (of 3 floors) got a little hot a night. Would stay here again!"
1984962,16606646,2014-07-30,14802962,Drew,"William was responsive and made the entire process very easy.  The property was clean, in good order, as represented, and perfect for my family members who stayed there.  I would rent from William again."
1984962,16856170,2014-08-03,18109567,Shashi,"Impeccable place. Better than what is shown in the pics. Clean bathrooms, clean and soft beds and a great kitchen. "
1984962,19478228,2014-09-13,8771129,Alex,Wonderful place to stay. Easy in and out. Thanks William for providing a great experience!
1984962,20097793,2014-09-23,19262113,Jenney,"My family and I had a wonderful time at this house. It was the perfect combination of home and the perfect get-a-way. It had everything we needed. Would loved to have had an ironing board and hair dryer, but was able to manger just fine without. I recommend this home to anyone looking to have easy access to downtown and the freeway. 
We have already decided we will request to rent this place again if we plan another trip to Seattle."
1984962,21879991,2014-10-26,193349,Sylvain,"We stayed in this house for two weeks during our house remodel. The proximity was, for us, ideal; but the location is quite practical as it lies right next to a bus stop and a few minutes on foot from Madrona's restaurants.

The house is spacious and has excellent amenities overall: each bedroom has its own bathroom. It is well appointed - including Bose speakers and excellent wifi speed - and very well maintained. It even has lovely Cascade views from one of the top-floor bedrooms.

Though it sits on a busy avenue at rush hour, the place was very quiet throughout our stay.

Most of all, the host was extremely responsive throughout. We would certainly do this again."
1984962,22633906,2014-11-10,23315386,Nate,"The house is really nice and as described. It is clean, spacious, and nicely updated. We wanted to stay in capitol hill but we were within a short uber distance to most destinations. I really liked the fact they had Bose systems all over for our music playing pleasures. I would definitely stay here again and would recommend this destination. Thanks! "
1984962,23528034,2014-12-03,10237220,Benjamin,"The house is beautiful, with modern finishes, excellent bedding, HD TVs, and great views of the Cascades from the 2nd floor.  The whole-house radiant in-floor heat is a plus, and the kitchen is great."
1984962,27508573,2015-03-06,7496011,Nathalie,"A beautiful home which made our holiday simply perfect.
The location was ideal 10 mins away from downtown. I will definitely come again."
1984962,29561889,2015-04-09,24671449,Deb,"This house was wonderful for our stay in Seattle. It is very clean and spacious, with modern finishes. Each room has a nice large and comfortable bed and its own bathroom, which made it perfect for our group of 4 people. It would accommodate more people very comfortably, I would think. The neighborhood is great for walking and excellent coffee is one block away! The parking garage is a tight fit, and we weren't able to squeeze the SUV we rented into it, but there was plenty of street parking, so it was no problem for us. We would definitely stay here again."
1984962,29916508,2015-04-14,27919917,Caroline,"Accurate listing for this clean and spacious house. Great location close to transport (2 bus). Perfect for business travelers as rooms all have private en suite bathrooms. Kitchen well-equipped for those looking to cook at ""home."""
1984962,31962384,2015-05-12,20665373,Christopher,"Excellent stay at this modern home.

Great neighborhood (Capitol Hill) has everything (coffee, grocery store, and shopping) within walking distance. 
So many great restaurants and shops in the neighborhood, and minutes drive to downtown. 
We even walked to Pikes Market one day (2.5 mile walk each way). 

William's home was immaculately clean and ready for our arrival for our extended weekend.
Excellent communication, William was immediately available by phone.
The only thing I would suggest for the place would be screens on the windows so they can be left open during the night (no A/C) 
We did have a consistent string of what was described to us as uncommonly warm & sunny weather.

Wouldn't have to think twice about staying here again when in town!"
1984962,33246577,2015-05-26,505890,Cade,"Nice, very modern place.  In a good location that was easily accessible to downtown.  Beds and linens were very soft. Clean and ready to go when we got there."
1984962,34820405,2015-06-12,1385499,Becka,"This house would be ideal for 2-3 couples. For my trip, it was just my boyfriend and I, and there's not a designated master bedroom, so we chose the only bedroom that didn't have windows out to the main street. It was a bit uncomfortably warm during the week, so we would have loved some fans (it's Seattle, so A/C units are non-existent). There was a minor leaking issue in one of the bathrooms, so our host showed up one evening to turn off the water of the sink, but it didn't really affect our stay because there were plenty of bathrooms. The internet didn't work which was a bummer, so if you absolutely need internet I'd suggest bringing a MIFI or clearing this issue up with the host in advance to see if he got it fixed.

The neighborhood was pretty nice - 2 cafes within a short walk and a bus stop just half a block away takes you directly into downtown. The neighbors are friendly, and there are some cute hidden neighborhoods within walking distance nearby. It was nice to see outside of Cap Hill proper for once and experience Seattle a bit more like a local. Communication with the homeowner's assistant over messages was very easy. The house is designed in a cute, clean style."
1984962,37498017,2015-07-07,3443364,Roman,"We had a fantastic time at William's place - it was new, beautiful, luxurious, quiet, and impeccably clean. Bed linens and towels were plush and luxurious, and the instructions thorough and helpful. And the fresh roses and Seattle guide were the icing on the cake.

The location was great - not in the midst of the hustle and bustle of Capitol Hill, but just down the hill a few blocks down where it was quiet and relaxing. A perfect way to relax after a day full of activities."
1984962,38000686,2015-07-12,35407674,Jessica,We had a great time in this home. It was a fun modern space with more than enough room for 6 and in perfect distance to Pikes Place and so many restaurants. The host was great to work with and very friendly. We had a great trip!
1984962,39224229,2015-07-21,23661364,Juan Sebastián,"The House is great! Very clean, modern and all rooms have bathrooms which is a big plus! 

The neighbourhood is great and would definately stay there again. 

"
1984962,42381051,2015-08-13,27646982,Connor,"William was extremely communicative during the booking process, and his colleague Mary was very helpful when I messed up the booking request initially. They gave me all the necessary information for the house and we were able to check-in and check-out without requiring any in-person assistance. 

They were also able to accommodate a pack-n-play, high chair, and baby gate for my niece to make the house more baby friendly.

The property itself is very centrally located in Seattle. It is extremely easy to get downtown in less than 15 minutes, or to a nice park in about 5 minutes. We were also able to easily drive out to Alki beach without getting on highway 5, and out to Olympic National Park area in about an hour.

There is also a small Cafe a two-minute walk from the house which we frequented most days, and a nice intersection just up the hill with some interesting local businesses.

The house is beautiful, modern construction with a nice floorplan for families. We had a lot of fun hanging out in the house every day, and due to my niece we cooked almost every meal. The house facilitated this well.

Only cons were the driveway being too small to accommodate our large rental car (that we needed to carry 5 adults and a toddler so that was our choice), a sink that was non-operational in the first floor bathroom but was going to be fixed, and the upstairs bedroom door being non-working. I wasn't informed of these issues before checking in, but William was quick to answer my phone call and answer my questions. He then went on to say I could text him anytime for suggestions on things to do. I didn't end up needing advice because of how much time the toddler took up, but it was good to know we had a local source for information.

Overall, I would stay at this property again if we took another big family trip to Seattle. It was well located in a quiet neighborhood."
1984962,47964564,2015-09-22,31071329,Nancy,Great location for exploring Seattle. Very clean and comfortable house. With 3 1/2 baths. Transitional neighborhood yet very safe. You should know there is a certain amount of traffic noise in case you are a late sleeper. 
1984962,49385531,2015-10-03,20649395,Ellie,"The house is very modern and stylish. It has everything we need: kitchen supplies, dishes and clean towels. The location of this house is very convenient: 10 min to DT Seattle, 5 min to the lake. The house manager is very thoughtful as well, offered us early checkin and late checkout. I would recommend this place to future visitors. "
7350992,39126623,2015-07-20,23970984,Caroline,"Erin and Tolis were wonderful hosts, they were quick to respond and made sure to greet me when I arrived after an 8 hour drive. The little backyard oasis is more than what's pictured, it was spacious, nicely decorated with warm colors, and supplied with luxury towels and bed linens and spotlessly clean. The brand new memory foam was sooo nice, we had the best sleep! The bathroom was spacious with an extra large shower, great pressure, adjustable spray settings on 2 separate shower heads. The galley kitchen was fully supplied with everything we would've needed if we planned to eat in. (Ballard has too many great pubs and eateries for us to eat at) We will look to stay at Erin's again. 5 star experience, highly recommend."
7350992,39691821,2015-07-25,3655983,Alissa,"We stayed at Erin's place for 4 nights and we thoroughly enjoyed our stay. The whole family was very friendly and accommodating, and the place is just as described. The guest house was extremely clean and it felt very private. It was nice having a kitchen available though we didn't use it much, there are a lots of good restaurants nearby. We had a car and there was always parking available. The neighborhood is also great and it was easy to walk to places and/or take the bus when we opted to do so. All in all it was a very positive experience!"
7350992,40375086,2015-07-30,34614299,Sheila,"The Dimopolous family has put so much attention  in creating their guesthouse retreat and it really shows. The house is easily accessed by a gate to their backyard. Surrounded by trees on one side, it stays shaded from the neighbors but also lets in plenty of natural light. It may look small in pictures, but it's actually quite roomy on the inside with plenty of storage and hooks for stashing luggage and shopping bags, and even a small closet for hanging clothes. The kitchen was well stocked but we never tested anything because the restaurants are so great! Be sure to get breakfast at Vios (especially the French toast)! We went twice in our short stay. The family left a charming gift basket of organic snacks, sweets, fresh fruit, scones and drinks. Theres also sulfate-free shampoo/conditioner and lotion in the bathroom for use. The shower has AMAZING water pressure, I want to take it home with us. The linens were soft and clean, in fact, the whole place is spotless! The beds are comfortable and the trundle sets up in seconds. We got to meet the family once and they're all so sweet. The children are darling and very polite and our hosts were very open with helpful suggestions and great at replying to emails quickly. If you're looking for a clean, quiet place that's still conveniently located near the busier parts of the city, this is it! "
7350992,40834491,2015-08-02,11525487,Jeannette,"Erin greeted us warmly and showed us around, giving us the necessary information about parking, keys, etc. She was flexible about our arrival time, which took the worry out of driving through Seattle traffic."
7350992,41015421,2015-08-03,26506027,Craig,"Erin & Tolis were wonderful hosts! They were very welcoming, were in touch with us right away, made sure we were comfortable finding their place, settling in, available to answer any questions we might have and were very accommodating.  The unit is super cute, comfortable, clean, and private. Ravenna is a nice neighborhood & was conveniently located for getting where we needed to go. We would love to stay there again and we highly recommend their rental.

7350992,41135479,2015-08-04,15192306,Rhonda,Lovely guest cottage. Erin was very generous to give me a ride from the airport! The privacy of the cottage was nice.  
7350992,44677326,2015-08-28,38356357,Virginia,The guest cottage was darling and we were very happy there for six nights.  We enjoyed our coffee in the morning and thought that Erin and Tolis provided everything we needed to be comfortable and welcome.  We look forward to coming again.
7350992,45740113,2015-09-05,19012502,Kristin,"My husband had a great time at the guesthouse. It had everything we needed, located in a great neighborhood, and the hosts were friendly and lovely. Highly recommend."
7350992,46311718,2015-09-09,6513729,Jerry,"Erin and her family were so nice.  She rushed home to greet us when we arrived earlier than expected.  Her guesthouse was wonderful for our short stay.  It is strategically located just off the 5 freeway, and parking was easy on her street.  She left tasty snacks for us, and was very accommodating to everything we needed.  Erin also gave us many recommendations for fun things to do in Seattle.  I would highly recommend staying with Erin!"
7350992,46614991,2015-09-12,36821273,Graydon,"I am still a newbie to AirBnB but I gotta say Erin is the most hospitable host I have stayed with so far. She made me feel at home and the cottage is like a bed and breakfast even if I found my own. The place is very cozy and the neighborhood breaks the scales on charm and walkablity to food and other stuff. No clubs or party spots. A place with families and people that get up for work in the morning. So, if you want nightlife not the spot but if you want a good night's sleep and a killer breakfast spot close by stay here. My only regret is not being able to stay longer and chat with Erin some more. I hope to return and stay here again soon."
7350992,47071384,2015-09-15,34045628,Diane,My host and her family made me feel very welcome.
7350992,48002818,2015-09-22,35390903,Amanda,"Erin was a great host - warm, attentive, and helpful. We needed to get to the pier to catch the ferry to Victoria, and she helped us decide between Uber and taxi (taxi). Her local recommendations were spot-on.  We didn't see her and her family much, but when we did, they were very friendly. We hope to stay there again!"
7350992,48770439,2015-09-28,15087923,Nonie,Erin's place was perfect! Very clean and full of amenities! The beds were amazing and comfortable with highest quality bedding! Erin was also very helpful with directions and she has a real knowledge of the city. Everything at the guest house was perfect!
7350992,52271910,2015-10-27,46566637,Tina,"I highly recommend this place! Erin was a great host. She explained everything and was available for any questions. She also provided a welcome letter with useful information. The place was gorgeous, clean, and exactly as pictured. There was also everything you could possibly need, from extra blankets, towels, pillows to kitchen appliances, cable, internet, magazines, books, bath products and yummy snacks. The neighborhood is easy to get around and there are plenty of places within walking distance. I'll definitely be back."
7350992,52501134,2015-10-30,31556672,Aj,I had a wonderful stay from start to finish! Erin was super nice and a great host.
7350992,53835825,2015-11-13,47579596,Amy,"I highly recommend staying with Erin and Tolis! As someone moving to a new city knowing no one they were the best help, and I felt completely safe in their guesthouse and neighborhood. From recommending places to eat, things to see and potential neighborhoods to live in, they gave nothing short of great and helpful advice."
7350992,54472278,2015-11-20,47579596,Amy,"I felt right at home in this lovely guesthouse! The bed was very comfortable, everything was nice and clean, and the kitchen was great for preparing a light breakfast or snack. Erin and her family were very nice and super helpful with suggestions of where to go etc. I had a very pleasant stay and highly recommend this property!"
7350992,57102944,2015-12-21,39383637,William,"Wonderful little guest house in a great walkable neighborhood. Erin really has thought of everything here, there were more amenities and comforts than you would find in most hotels. Really a fantastic stay and I would love to stay again."
7619060,43996123,2015-08-23,35803439,Wanvisa,"My friend and I had a great time staying at this place. Kazami and his wife are fantastic host, very accommodating. The room is nice, clean and the bed is comfortable. Kazami offered to drop my friend off at the pier for the cruise and drop me off at the light rail to the airport. We will definitely recommend this place. "
7619060,48884003,2015-09-29,39999180,Shashank,Kazami and Mitsuko were wonderful hosts and I enjoyed my stay with them very much. They were very accommodating and went out of their way to help me find my way around the city. The room is very nice and cozy with very nice amenities and is exactly as described. I recommend them very highly to anyone.
7619060,49371837,2015-10-03,5370800,Natalie,"Big, spacious room near downtown! Very welcoming and involved hosts."
7619060,49686435,2015-10-05,19382134,Erika Kathleen,"Kazami and his wife Mitsuko were so friendly and accommodating. Whenever I was at their house, they would really make me feel so comfortable despite having a long and tiring day. They were really understanding as I've been going home late at around 7/8PM and they have been fine with it. Their house is beautiful and amazing - modern and sleek plus at a convenient area where you just take a bus around a 2 minute walk to downtown. Kazami even oriented me about Seattle. Overall - an amazing experience that I would recommend to anyone staying in Seattle."
7619060,50104050,2015-10-09,44383009,Devin,"My experience could not have been better!  Kazami is a fantastic host!  He gave me a lot of info about the city before I arrived, including straight-forward instructions on how to get to his place.  He even picked me up at the Light Rail station!  Once we arrived, he had a tray with tea leaves, coffee grounds, a French press and cups waiting.  The house is beautiful and the room is exactly as pictured.  The bed is firm and everything is clean.   The private bathroom is a big plus.  The location of the house is awesome.  I walked to a lot of things and an Uber downtown cost ~$6.  Super easy.  There is a bus station nearby, but I didn't use it.  

All in all, if you're coming to Seattle, you'll not find a better deal than this.  Stay here."
7619060,50354959,2015-10-11,2314697,Enid,"We had a wonderful experience staying with Kazami and his wife. They are very nice hosts that they even drove us to and from the station. The room is super clean and spacious, in a beautiful townhouse, with everything needed include shampoos and fresh towel.
Even though the place is not in downtown, but the bus is just a few blocks away and takes you right to the center. 
I would definitely recommend anyone stay with Kazami.
"
7619060,50962008,2015-10-16,45463971,Katie,"We had a great time staying at Kazami's home - it's very modern, clean, and comfortable, and has easy access to downtown and many I great areas of the city (about a 40 minute walk to Pike Place). Kazami and his wife were very friendly and provided a lot of local magazines and maps and told us about many of their favourite spots before we arrived, which really helped with planning! "
7619060,51330742,2015-10-19,42053624,Elizabeth,"Kazami and his wife were very welcoming. The pictures and descriptions of this place are accurate. Room and bathroom were clean and spacious, comfy bed, desk to do work, great WiFi connection, and quiet. Large common area/kitchen space on the main floor. Neighbourhood was easy to access and was close to the downtown shopping areas — just a quick 10 min Uber ride. Street parking was safe. Overall, this place made our stay in Seattle very comfortable, with no complaints!"
7619060,52111256,2015-10-26,8262687,Jessica,"Our stay at Kazami's was really enjoyable! They have a beautiful house with modern decor and the room was a good size with a comfortable bed and big bathroom. Their house is very close to downtown. Kazami and his wife are very friendly, welcoming people and we enjoyed getting to know them! They gave us great tips on places to eat and sights to see. Would definitely recommend staying here!"
7619060,52305251,2015-10-27,20806545,Kevin,"非常舒适安静的房子，床边有窗户，晚上睡觉可以看见星星月亮，房东非常热情，退房的时候我去机场，他送了我，以后去波士顿，还会住在这里。给大家极力推荐！Very Nice!

"
7619060,52893888,2015-11-02,46722764,Vicky,"Kazami was very welcoming and accommodating! Very sweet. The house is a beautiful, minimalist, immaculate, 3 story house and it was a very comfortable and hassle-free stay. He leaves the light on for you, even when you're home late. There are q-tips in a little bag (among other nice things) in the bathroom. You can control the temperature in your room. Little things like that really make this experience stand out for me. He also really knows his towels so those are of course superb :)"
7619060,53400955,2015-11-08,47646446,Sarah,"Kazami was a great host, very informative of transportation and parking in seattle.  We rented a car and was able to find street parking right in front of the building.  The place is in a great location right by the freeway.  Kazami showed us nearby cafe called the weekend cafe that was really good and only a block away.  Overall this place was great to stay at and I would definitely stay here again."
7619060,54263643,2015-11-17,35791064,Alorah,"Kazami and his wife were both very helpful and accommodating for my stay in Seattle. The House is located on a hill overlooking a quiet street below and a giant art deco style hospital above that lights up at night. 
It's a short walk to a few different bus stops located around the area, but I never had any trouble navigating into town, on a nice day it's easy enough just to walk it. Kazami was kind enough to pick me up at the lightrail station, and was always checking to make sure everything was comfortable and in order. Very convenient and professional environment in a very quiet part of town, (just what I needed) would recommend. "
7619060,54669135,2015-11-22,43233992,Meiying,"It was clean and cozy. Kazami and his family were so friendly and nice. We had private bathroom and shared the living room area, they also prepared a whole set of bath towels for us to use. It was a quiet place to stay, we really enjoyed it. "
7619060,55265051,2015-11-29,3181243,Samantha,"My boyfriend and I came to Seattle and Kazami's place was a very comfortable place to stay. From picking us up at the boltbus stop, to giving us recommendations, Kazami and his wife were excellent hosts who went above and beyond my expectations. The bedroom itself was very comfortable, firm bed and very soft towels. Though it is up a steep hill, it is extremely accessible by public transit and uber and also walking distance from the Int'l District! When I return to Seattle, I will definitely check to see if Kazami's listing is available. "
7619060,55724304,2015-12-05,26276739,Rachel,"Kazami was welcoming to us during our 1-night stay. The space was clean, modern and had many convenient amenities. 

Kazami recommended many wonderful places to visit and eat on our last day in Seattle. It was a clean and comfortable space to stay in.  It's in a convenient location and is just a short drive to many Seattle attractions. 

Plenty of street parking in a nice quiet neighborhood. 

Thank you for having us in your home. We hope to come back to Seattle soon! "
7619060,55811090,2015-12-06,31089356,Sarah,"Our host was organized, efficient, and straightforward. We chose the room because of the neighborhood and liked that we had a private bathroom. We didn't have a chance to connect with Kazami much other than a check in and check out procedure, but we slept well and appreciated the hot shower. "
7619060,56681463,2015-12-16,49837679,Shucheng,"Following the last review, however, there are things that I would give people a heads-up about:
Check-in is NOT flexible and we weren't able to check in until after 7 pm at a rainy night, although there is still controversy over who is to blame for messages not getting through;
The house is NOT soundproof at all and people from lower floor could hear those from upper floor do everything, so if you at least want to talk even at a low voice, it would be rendered impossible because it would disturb others;
Ask the host about facilities and house rules (like keeping voice low at what time period or what service is covered and what instructions are to be followed) upon arrival, because we weren't shown rooms other than bedrooms until the day of departure, including laundry room and yoga room (never shown).
So even if Kazami is highly recommended as person, you should think twice about taking him as host."
7619060,57050054,2015-12-21,25014691,Cecilia,"I really can't think of anything that would have improved my stay.  Kazami and his wife were welcoming and gracious, the room and bath were immaculate and comfortable.  It was only a block and a half from the family members I was visiting.  The neighborhood feels safe and is convenient to public transportation.  Kazami adjusted his schedule to meet my needs checking in and out, and even helped me take my suitcase up to my daughter's house. "
3209964,46323934,2015-09-09,19933856,Richard,"Dana was flexible, available, relaxed and friendly.  The place was clean and the bedroom was spacious and up-to-date.  Having a private bathroom to myself was great.  The condo is in a quiet,very nice upscale complex and Dana had arranged parking for me-a nice touch.  The location is close to stores and I-5 is conveniently close. (But over the hill so you can't hear it!)"
7698916,41565190,2015-08-07,40612146,Scott,Excellent experience. Nathan greeted me at the door. Very nice place and great location. Capitol Hill is a great neighborhood and very close to all major Seattle locations. The room and apartment were very clean and tidy. Nathan was able to offer a lot of helpful advice about the area. I would definitely stay here again if I returned to Seattle. 
7698916,41894903,2015-08-09,16111498,Sandi,"The place was clean, quiet, and spacious. But the best part about it was the neighborhood. 

Nate was a great host. He went out of his way to leave hospitality goodies and gave us a great list of close, recommended spots.

I would not hesitate to stay here again. Really, it was a great AirBnB experience."

7698916,42346468,2015-08-12,5851353,Myrtille,We had a good stay at Nate's. We didn't see him a lot but he welcomed us with a lot of recommendations and tips to enjoy the neighborhood. The check in and check out were easy to organize. It's a good and not expensive option for a base to explore Capitol Hill.
7698916,42626742,2015-08-14,3252038,Miriam,"Nathan was an awesome host! We didn't really get a chance to meet in person due to timing, but he was still very helpful and checked in with me via text message which was very thoughtful. He answered all of my questions and had great suggestions. His apartment was very nice, very clean, and in a great location for exploring Seattle. "
7698916,43147269,2015-08-17,3324165,Se-Yeon,"I love this place. Close to downtown, and quiet. And cheaper than other places around here in airbnb!
It was great place someone traveling in Seattle like me."
7698916,43684624,2015-08-21,9446045,Sam,"Nathan was a fantastic host. There seemed to be no end to his generosity. During our stay he did everything within his means to make us feel at home, and he continued to provide support when our train out of town was cancelled at the last minute. The flat itself is located in a prime part of town, a ten minute walk away from the restaurants, cafés and parks of Capitol Hill. Equally, getting downtown is no problem, with the number 2 bus running from his doorstep.

Thank you, Nathan. In three years using Airbnb, you were the best host I've met. "
7698916,44225856,2015-08-24,9310433,Nate,"This was a fantastic AirBnB experience; Nathan met me at the door and showed me around the apartment. It's simple and nice -- exactly as it looks in the photos. 

The bed was comfortable, the couch in the room was a nice touch, and the location was quiet at night. (I stayed on a Saturday night.) 

Very easy to get around to coffee shops, restaurants, and bars, too. 

Thanks to Nathan for a fantastic stay; I'd definitely come back if I'm ever in Seattle again. "
7698916,44726142,2015-08-28,42240225,Anne,"Nate was a great host who definitely takes pride in keeping up his apartment. The neighborhood is centrally located and there is quite a lot of nightlife nearby, for which Nate gave us lots of recommendations. There was a nicely decorated bookshelf in the guest room with what he described as the greatest collection of books, which you'll just have to see for yourself. We both forgot to bring toothbrushes but thank goodness he had travel kits right in the room."
7698916,45294609,2015-09-01,38507,Marilyn,"This was a great place to stay and a friendly, helpful host.  Nathan had a mini guide to places of interest in the neighborhood.  He checked with me to see if I needed anything.  Nice neighborhood.  Convenient to downtown.  Thanks Nathan"
7698916,45608095,2015-09-04,42040707,Mark,"I had a great stay with Nate, and the apartment was immaculate - quiet, clean, comfortable, and an excellent neighborhood! Nate was a terrific host, provided information about the surrounding areas and recommended several dining and night life options - and there was fresh coffee brewing every morning before I went to work- top notch stuff. I definitely encourage anyone staying in the Seattle area to give Nates place a try. 5 stars!"
7698916,45751514,2015-09-05,20845454,Vanessa,"Staying at Nathan's in Seattle was great! His apartment is very clean and Nathan is very welcoming. Our plane got delayed for a couple of hours and Nathan was flexible with our arrival time and arranged everything for a smooth stay. He had towels and toiletteries ready for us and he even provided us with a recommendation list of what to do and where to eat within the area which was super helpful!
Overall I can only highly recommend staying at Nathan's! "
7698916,46214488,2015-09-08,25249243,Alessandro,"Very nice and clean place!
Nathan is an easy going guy, reachable all day and always available to help. He is also very helpful in suggesting typical places in the Seattle area.
Great experience!
Highly recommended"
7698916,46344322,2015-09-09,43273704,Jarrad,Nathan was an awesome host and made my first airbnb experience great! He left out toiletries and greeted me even though I arrived late in the evening.  We spoke for a while and he even showed me around to a few spots in Seattle despite it being so late. I would definitely recommend Nathan for your Seattle trip and would stay there again on another trip.
4577542,25373842,2015-01-13,25815500,Pema,"I thought this was a great deal for what you get at this place!  a whole private apartment to myself with a full kitchen and VERY comfortable & large bed.  It was somehow quiet and cozy-feeling even though we were smack-dab in the middle of Capitol Hill, went to a couple great restaurants and bars within less than 3 blocks from our door.  And we really appreciated that it comes with a parking spot right next to the gate, made it easy to load heavy bags in and out!  The place was modern and clean but also really comfortable and accessible with lots of places to put away our stuff and also plenty of room to sit and hang out.  This was only a quick visit but I'll definitely book here again for my longer stays in Seattle when I need a home base with laundry & everything we need to bring home & prepare groceries, and close to bus lines & stores.  Thank you very much for such an easy and comfortable stay in Capitol Hill!"
4577542,25525813,2015-01-18,8805050,Hailey,Great location! Great house! Great hosts! Had a wonderful experience and will definitely book again for a fun weekend in the city.

I would be happy to stay here again on future trips to Seattle."
4577542,26792149,2015-02-19,23667838,Gary,Place was clean and comfortable.  It was spacious and quiet. I was staying for business travel and local provided great access to restaurants and night life options.  Would definitely consider staying there again
4577542,27169205,2015-02-27,23114591,Carrie,"I cannot say enough positive things about Jessica and her amazing flat! Her place is somehow even cuter and cozier than it appears in the pictures. I felt so comfortable the whole time. Everything is so well laid out and is stocked with everything you'd need. It's in a fabulous area of town that's walkable to multiple grocery stores, bus lines, and approximately a jillion restaurants and bars. It was really easy for me to just walk to the grocery store to get what i needed for the next day or 2 and restock as needed. Despite this close proximity to everything, the place was super quiet and peaceful-- no loud neighbors or late-night bar crawlers. Also Jessica was super responsive and got back to me right away about any questions I had.  I definitely recommend staying here if you get the chance."
4577542,27514977,2015-03-06,2446574,Sonia,"Great place in an awesome location. The space is well decorated, welcoming, clean and comfortable. It was centrally located and walking distance to many great eateries. I would love to stay here again. "
4577542,27809370,2015-03-12,24308164,Crosby,"There are no words to describe how amazing and perfectly located this place.  I can't wait to come back to Seattle, I will not stay at any other place whenever I go to seattle.  Thank you jessica for providing all the info for restaurants,bars, and grocery stores.  Also thank for allowing to stay in this amazing place.
"
4577542,30130067,2015-04-18,2840401,Julie,we felt welcome. the listing was exactly like the photos.
4577542,30380306,2015-04-21,9851032,Rebecca,This was a beautiful home in a great location.  Everything about the communication was easy and the instructions and guides to Seattle were detailed.  I visited several of the neighborhood recommendations and was pleased with all of the recommendations!  It was easy to get around by foot and bus.   
4577542,30614297,2015-04-25,2553722,Phoebe,"This place was great! I would definitely stay here again. It's super quiet and peaceful, but close to a lot of fun things in a great neighborhood. The place was very clean and comfortable. One of the best Airbnb experiences I have had. 
"
4577542,31926024,2015-05-11,19717579,Rashea,"Very adorable home.  It seemed as though a lot of love and thought was put into every aspect of it. The listing and the neighborhood were as described.  There were a lot of restaurants and bars in walking distance.  Everything was clean and Heather (Jessica's management person) was very responsive when we reached out to her.  The person who was listed in the book (Kathy) was not as helpful so I would just keep all communications with Jessica or Heather if you need someone.

Just a couple of minor issues during our stay.  The toilet seems prone stopping (as noted in the house rules book) so you should expect to do some toilet plunging during your stay (not the best way to spend a vacation).  There was a disassembled fan that seemed available for us but it was missing a piece. The TVs gave us problems throughout our stay too.  All very minor.  I would recommend this place nonetheless.  Maybe just plan to potty elsewhere :)."
4577542,32509333,2015-05-19,29538289,Ana,The place is really nice; very cozy and modern. The bed is huge and the kitchen has all the important tools. Very close and easy to get downtown. We arrived earlier and it was possible to put the luggage inside before check in time. Heather was really nice and available for questions and help; definitely recommend and hope to come back :) 
4577542,33767955,2015-06-01,26656205,Christine,"I enjoyed my stay at Jessica's place during our trip. Her home is exactly as described and pictured. Everything is accessible at this location, which makes it really convenient and there are excellent recommendations provided as well. 

The only issue I came across was similar mentioned by previous guests as well. We had some difficulties with the toilet during our stay. Aside from that everything else was great."
4577542,34824075,2015-06-12,35075582,Catherine,"The apartment was just as described/pictured and was clean and comfortable. The decor is tasteful, with lovely local books, votive holders, and pictures. The location is perfect, close to many restaurants, cafés, and parks. The kitchen has everything one would need to make a delicious meal from one of the neighborhood grocers or farmers markets. The patio/garden was a peaceful and private oasis in a busy area. We were visiting our daughter at a university a few blocks away, and appreciated the alley parking spot. It is in a vibrant neighborhood, so be warned that it is noisy at night.  There are also stairs both to access the apartment and inside, so might not be best for someone with mobility issues.  Heather, who manages the apartment, was helpful and responsive as we planned our visit. The price is comparable to the nearby hotel we usually stay at, but we were much more comfortable and relaxed at Jessica's apartment."
4577542,37284616,2015-07-06,27502693,Danielle,The apt was great. We would highly recommend and would stay there again when we're back in the Seattle area. Very prompt responses to our questions prior to our stay. The apt was very clean and looked just like the pictures. It was also hugely helpful to have a parking spot in that neighborhood.
4577542,44747593,2015-08-29,25805389,Sebastian,"Die Unterkunft war sehr schön und genau so, wie auf den Fotos und wie beschrieben. Die Wohnung war geschmackvoll und eingerichtet und es war alles vorhanden, was für einen schönen Aufentahlt nötig ist. Sie lag ruhig im hinteren Bereich des Hauses und der private Garten war wie eine Oase in der Großstadt.
Die zentrale Lage war sehr gut und man war schnell zu Fuß bei vielen schönen Restaurants und Shops. Capitol Hill ist ein wirklich toller Stadtteil um Seattle und seine Bewohner zu erleben und um seinen Aufenthalt zu geniesen. Die Erreichbarkeit mit dem Auto war auch ohne Probleme und sehr schnell möglich. DownTown war auch schnell und einfach zu erreichen.
Während unserem Aufenthalt war Jessica sehr bemüht. Nachdem die Wettervorhersage ""heiße Tage"" mitteilte lies Jessica uns sogar eine Klimaanlage bringen. 
Wir würden diese Unterkunft jederzeit unseren Freunden und Bekannten empfehlen und sofort wieder buchen.
Ein Großen Dank an Jessica "
4577542,45068502,2015-08-31,22397484,Jenni,"I cannot say enough how much we loved this place! The pictures were exactly what we had in mind, the kitchen and living area are very warm and inviting. We found ourselves coming back to the neighborhood for meals and walking around, it was in a great location. 

The host left a book of information for us, plus small touches throughout that really made our stay welcome. Check in was smooth, although we had a late flight out and there wasn't any flexibility for a late check out. We parked on the premises and it was easy in and out. We already talked about booking the place again next time we're in Seattle!"
4577542,46263948,2015-09-09,31047963,Jackie,"My boyfriend and I stayed at Jessica's for 5 days, and her house is amazing. Great location and very quiet. The pictures are 100% accurate. It was so nice to come home after a busy day and relax and kickback on the comfy couch, or sit and look at the garden. It was so nice to walk a few blocks to Trader Joe's and the co op to buy food and cook in the amazing kitchen. There is a awesome Bluetooth speaker that has really good sound. Nice to be able to listen to some tunes while chilling out. Our stay was great, and I would recommend to stay here!
There were a few issues, the smoke detector was beeping because the battery was low. We contacted Pillow and they had someone over and replace it in a few hours. This is no fault of the property, I wanted to mention it because Pillow did such a good job of responding and fixing the issue. The internet was a little wonky, but we eventually got it to work on our own, just reset the router and pressed a button on the front. The binder with restaurants and suggestions for places to go was helpful, we made it to a lot of them. Def go to skillet! Hope to stay again at Jessica's when we come back to visit."
4577542,46693768,2015-09-13,30022120,Tessie,"The place looks just like the photos but you can't see the great high ceilings or feel the character. Good location. We used Ub@r for transportation mostly but there are a few buses right outside the door or you can walk. We had a problem when we first arrived, sent a message and it was taken care of before I arrived back from my mani-pedi with a hot stone massage a few blocks over. 
We would stay here again in the future"
4577542,47192489,2015-09-16,14056226,Joseph,"The place was exactly as described, in an ideal location and the parking was such a nice bonus.  My fiancé and myself were there for her birthday weekend (she used to live in Seattle) and this was the PERFECT place to stay.  Everything was fantastic, I would absolutely recommend this place, and will be looking to book it again the next time I travel to Seattle.  Checking in was seamless, there was a great guide book of how everything worked (in the house) and recommendations of places to go - which we didn't need as my fiancé was a local for years, but if you are visiting from out of town I would see it as a huge perk.  The house was clean, neat, and more than enough space for the two of us.  "
4577542,48318070,2015-09-25,831325,James,The listing was clean and comfortable and super well located for a lot of great bars restaurants and other fun!
4577542,48942625,2015-09-29,43912267,Chloe Jisun,"I've had a wonderful stay at Jessica's place in Seattle. I went on a long trip to several parts in America and in Canada. However, Jessica's place was the first one I went on that trip and the best among all in various ways. At Jessica's I had the most amazing time with my boyfriend. It was just so fit for two of us and we talked about how we would want a house like that someday.  The agency had everything perfectly prepared for us and I LOVED how clean the place was and how it had everything I needed to cook him nice dinner(much more than I had imagined actually. with all kinds of seasoning and herb). It felt as if we were in a very fancy hotel because they had a little packet of shampoo set on the bed with neatly arranged towels. 

Seriously, it was so much more than what I had expected from airbnb. I definitely want to stay at Jessica's again in the future. It was just that good. "
4577542,49232556,2015-10-02,42345956,Peng,"This cozy house made my stay in Seattle a very pleasant and rememberable experience! The location is very convenient and at the same time away from noise, the host is always trying to help more.
Appreciate and highly recommend!"
4577542,51028498,2015-10-17,43035830,Mary,The property description was accurate. Nice neighborhood.
4577542,51621068,2015-10-22,43419662,Evan,Jessica's home was wonderful. The lay out was great and I really enjoyed staying within walking distance of the Capital Hill area.  I would recommend it to anyone. 
4577542,52726792,2015-11-01,41930186,Denise,The apartment was welcoming and cozy. The kitchen had everything we needed and although we didn't stay too long to cook in the kitchen we would have loved to! The living room was comfortable and the bedroom was everything we needed. There was a cute balcony where you can see the rain fall and feel the breeze.  The bed was very comfortable as well and so spacious! You won't be disappointed when you arrive.  I loved that they had a dryer and washer available. The bathroom was fully stocked as well with shampoo and conditioner just in case you forgot your own. It was a nice touch.  I would love to stay here again when I return to beautiful Seattle. Not only was the apartment great but it was in the perfect location! We walked everywhere. 
4577542,53342906,2015-11-08,44803181,Shane,"Jessica's place was great! It was clean, comfortable, and in a great part of town. The back yard was especially nice and cozy. Perfect for sitting and enjoying the morning. I would definitely stay here again."
4577542,53983727,2015-11-15,43005105,Jane,"We loved your place, the area, and the convenience to walkable restaurants. Your house is beautifully maintained, cozy, and private ... It really exceeded our expectations. 

My husband was not on board with the whole Airbnb idea so it took some coaxing. This was the perfect place for our first Airbnb experience.

Thanks you!"
4577542,54594742,2015-11-22,7963991,Christina,"This home was nothing but adorable, welcoming, clean and it was just simply perfection. The location is perfect for seeing all of what Capitol Hill and the rest of Seattle has to offer. It was close to many great spots for dining, bar hopping, shopping and an additional for a nice stroll to a park or to see the city. I love this home and would recommend it to anyone who is interested! It is 100% and I had a great stay. "
4577542,55809652,2015-12-06,3532096,Joyce,Easy check in (you're given the code two days prior) and the apartment was exact as described. Great location and walking distance to many restaurants and bars. Would stay here again!
6613192,44475657,2015-08-26,27923865,Xiaoxuan,"Tiffany was great about making sure we had the info to get to the apartment and gain access. She left great instructions about getting there to the airport, getting around and the neighborhood! Many thanks for making us feel comfortable and welcome on our Seattle trip.

The apartment itself was great--a little small for 4 people, but we definitely managed to make it work. Place was small but cozy, kept very clean. Big windows were a great bonus--the lighting in the room was great! The location was simultaneously the biggest pro and con of the place. Being in the heart of downtown, it was extremely easy to get to from the airport and to other places (literally right across the street from the light rail/bus station). Lots of shopping/eating right outside the door, with easy access to Pike Place Market, Space Needle, and other popular stops. However, the place could get pretty noisy at night, with garbage trucks and street cleaning passing by very early in the morning. Downtown also gets a lot of traffic, so expect higher than average noise levels (will disrupt light sleepers). Otherwise, the apartment was perfect!"
6613192,45156201,2015-08-31,3522039,Allie,"Tiffany's place is perfect for anyone wanting to see Seattle. It's right in the heart of downtown and super convenient to get anywhere. Mere blocks from Pike Place, first Starbucks etc. The apartment is warm and welcoming and great size for a single person or couple. Tiffany made picking up keys easy and gave me all the information I could need."
6613192,46006875,2015-09-07,41055473,Kevin,My stay Tiffany's apartment was great. She provided great customer service by replying back to all my questions promptly. The location was amazing. Only few blocks walk to pike place market. Walk out and there is plenty of shopping in the area. The apartment was clean and had everything we needed.
6613192,51161760,2015-10-18,41213552,Dai,"The location is really good. We had a great fun in downtown Seattle. The apartment is cozy and clean. Thank you, Tiffany."
6613192,53380841,2015-11-08,47077238,Austin,"Great stay! The apartment was very well kept; true to the pictures. Everything functions properly (lights, electronics, plumbing, heat, all the essentials). Tiffany made getting the keys and obtaining access to the apartment pleasant and seamless with personal instructions (via airbnb messenger and a word document). As advertised, the location is PRIME: Pike St. Market is a five minute walk, Light Rail is literally across the street, good shopping/food surrounding you from all directions, etc.

A very pleasant stay in a great city. Highly recommend to anyone looking for an inexpensive, practical jumping off point into the heart of Seattle.  "
8372562,58131030,2016-01-01,35055441,Jeannie,"We had an amazing time staying at Jon's home, the house is very spacious and in a great location with views that I wish I woke up to everyday Stunning!
Jon was quick to respond to all my questions and very accommodating with my request re check in time.
Everything in the house was as described and great hot tub with a view of Mount Rainier by day and a beautiful view of Bellevue skyline by night.
All in all we had a fab Christmas in Seattle. X "
8195348,46978753,2015-09-14,43346108,Rachel,"Pamela was wonderful, and the space was perfect. Very private, cuddly kitties, and pears fresh from her yard!  My friend and I loved it. Also, the bed was incredibly comfy. "
8195348,48581575,2015-09-27,40261141,Anna,"Pamela is very flexable and carIng host. The ""room"" was more of a whole apartment.  What a wonderfully bright,clean,comfortable,relaxing,quiet,and restful environment. 
The bed was very comfortable, pillows were goose down filled and wonderful linens!!  
The back yard made me feel like i was back at home. I loved the cats, chickens and rabbits.
The bathroom was spacious and had plenty of towels andwas once again very clean. 
It was very nice to know when i planned this trip that i could wash and dry my cloths- therefore not having to take as many with me on my trip. 
The most important thing -as a single woman traveling alone- was that i always felt safe. "
8195348,55325739,2015-11-29,38791728,Alan,"Pamela kept well contact with me during my arrival. She gave me clear instruction so that I could get in the home and use all the facilities by myself when she was not at home without difficulties. She and her husband were so nice and easygoing,  we had a wonderful breakfast together. We enjoyed our stay. In additional, the  house is only 15mins to Setac Airport. Very convenient."
5499882,28684059,2015-03-28,29823552,Ben,"As first-time airbnb users, we had a wonderful time at Katrina's place. The location was exactly what we wanted: close to the U District and downtown Seattle for a reasonable price. It was not just as described online, but better. The pictures didn't do justice to the spacious living area, full kitchen and large bathroom. Each bedroom was cozy, warm and quiet.  It was a real cool feeling to be so close to the city, but have a country farm like experience with their four chickens. They never made a sound and our kids loved seeing them each morning. (The fresh eggs were also a bonus!)  Katrina was also so helpful in getting us oriented with bus schedules and stop locations near her place. She was also very personable. We enjoyed our brief visit with her as we got acquainted with the place. She also responded quickly to our texted questions during our stay. We can't believe we got all this for only $100 a night! Thank you so much Katrina."
5499882,28762206,2015-03-29,22379528,Deni,"Katrina & her husband were fantastic hosts! She was always quick to respond to questions, and was very flexible and accommodating of our odd schedule. The apartment was clean and comfortable and cozy! We only stayed one night, but I wish we could have stayed a bit longer. I loved the apartment & the neighborhood, and I would definitely stay there again if I get the chance! "
5499882,28839285,2015-03-30,3176509,Lisa,"Very nice place, great hosts. Katrina and her husband were delightful to chat with. Large rooms, very clean. Would easily fit 4 people for weekend. Full kitchen available to cook meals if needed.  Highly recommend for a place to stay. Convenient to Magnuson Park and not too far from University area. "
5499882,29782563,2015-04-12,30388085,Casey,Was definitely great 
5499882,30330273,2015-04-20,30356832,Diane,We very much enjoyed our 4 nite stay. Katrina and John are a delightful young couple ... who go out of their way to make things comfortable and accommodate requests.
5499882,30805434,2015-04-27,30617983,Betsy,"Great experience! The hosts were responsive and made us feel very welcome. The place was as described: cute, comfortable and nicely appointed. We were left a dozen fresh eggs that we enjoyed for breakfast the morning after our arrival. The neighborhood is great-quiet and convenient to downtown Seattle. Definitely a place we will book again the next time we make a trip up there. "
5499882,31468461,2015-05-05,8237259,Marie,"We had a wonderful time staying at the Hideaway. Katrina was incredibly accommodating before, during, and after our stay. She quickly answered questions leading up to our visit, allowed me to reserve close to the arrival date, brought out blankets and airbeds, left a key for our late night arrival, and had some fresh eggs for us to enjoy. It felt like staying in a home and all of us enjoy staying there. I had even lost my work badge- which they found and offered to send it back to me!"
5499882,32123821,2015-05-14,13037790,Edmund,"Katrina & John are excellent hosts and very responsive. They made sure our stay was comfortable. Definitely thoughtful & delightful couple! E.g. 1) they bought a brand new pack-n-play so that my 3-month-old infant could have her own comfortable bed. 2) Little things like Kleenex, umbrellas, hairdryer, a dozen of fresh eggs from their own hens, milk, oatmeal & cream...

The place is conveniently close to U-district and Green Lake. The house is clean & spacious. We will definitely recommend this place and would love to stay there again. "
5499882,32539824,2015-05-19,28253095,Taylor,"Katrina was awesome.  We were greeted with cold beer, and eggs in the fridge from the chickens she raises there.  Everything was clean and well-kept.  What more could you ask for?"
5499882,32563885,2015-05-19,9931102,Layli,"Apartment was great!! Bed was extremely comfortable, and loved the chickens!  A great place to stay while in Seattle, good location and near several fun neighborhoods.  Highly recommend "
5499882,32870448,2015-05-22,33697804,Amy,"This was the perfect last minute place to stay!  We are Seattle locals and needed a place to stay for a few nights while our own home was worked on.  Katrina was super accommodating - easy to communicate with, responsive, and generally able to make the whole thing happen in less than 6 hours!  The house itself is a cute garden apartment with two ample bedrooms - you access via a cute yard (with chickens that my kids loved!).  The kitchen was practical with a fridge, toaster over, and stove; the bathroom was nice (full size bath tub); and the bedrooms comfy.  Thanks so much Katrina for being an amazing host..."
5499882,33252913,2015-05-26,24114031,Rob,"Katrina's Hideaway was a great little spot to stay in after a day exploring the city. We have family living in the area and needed a few extra bedrooms and this place worked out great for us! It may be a bit of a trek from downtown, but the Hideaway was very convenient for some of the more fun Northern neighborhoods (Ballard, Fremont, U District, etc). Anyone visiting Seattle should check all these places out. Thanks Katrina!"
5499882,34067695,2015-06-04,30874622,Karen,"The description of this property was accurate but I was still surprised at how roomy it was. Katrina and John were wonderful. Very friendly and helpful.  Loved the fresh eggs and cream.  The information card inside the unit was helpful  for getting to know the closest eateries. Beds were comfy. Plenty of blankets and pillows.  Loved the neighborhood. Only 6 miles from downtown. Easy access to the freeway. Yet the area was very quiet. Felt like the suburbs.   I would recommend the ""Hideaway"" to anyone visiting Seattle."
5499882,34155879,2015-06-05,21453111,Jennifer,"Katrina met us at the gate which was great because we arrived when it was dark.  She led us to the studio and we were pleased that the description online was exactly the way that it looked in person.  

Very comfortable place and quiet.  Conveniently located in a neighborhood with some eating options and close to a Safeway.
The eggs from the chickens in the yard were much appreciated the next morning as well!"
5499882,34729371,2015-06-11,33127411,Jacob,Both Katrina and her husband were kind and helpful.  Location was very pleasant.  Just a very short drive to downtown area!  Would stay here again.
5499882,35076319,2015-06-15,8038979,Linda,"Katrina is a very good communicator ~ She made us feel welcome well in advance of our arrival. She was flexible with our arrival time which made it easier to plan our activities.

The basement apartment is a wonderful place to stay. It's very spacious, has a great kitchen, large bathroom with lots of surface area to store toiletries. Everything was clean, tidy, and comfortable."
5499882,35300120,2015-06-17,31313827,Emily,The unit is lovely and was perfect for our small family.  Katrina went the extra mile to borrow pack and plays for our toddler twins and even had them set up for us in advance of our arrival.  My kids loved petting the chickens!
5499882,35553021,2015-06-20,13503947,Grace,"Perfect perfect perfect! Our family had a wonderful stay at Katrina's Hideaway. The space itself was so roomy, comfortably furnished and most important, spotless! We were able to relax after our long days in the city, and really enjoyed visiting some of the recommended neighborhood spots. Cloud City Coffee is now a favorite of ours too! Thanks so much for the care and special touches you put into hosting. We hope to stay with you guys the next time we are in town! "
5499882,36665132,2015-06-30,14339194,Sara,"The Hideaway is a little gem!!!  It is centrally located, comfortable and spacious enough for a family of 5.  The highlight at the Hideaway is the 4 chickens and their freshly laid eggs!  My 8 year old niece was instantly enamored with the clucking beauties!  The hosts are friendly and accommodating.  Parking is really not a problem at all as the hosts saved part of their driveway for our car.  There was only one night in which we had to park on the street.  This location is not overly noisy so all of us were able to get a good night's sleep.  I found everything to be clean and adequately stocked for my family's use.  As the Hideaway is a basement location, it is rather dim but all the lighting provided brightened up the interior space.  My family and I stayed at the Hideaway for 6 nights and were not disappointed once.  From this location, my family and I were able to drive to many Seattle sights.  The Hideaway made our Seattle stay more relaxed and comfortable.  That's important to us!"
5499882,36961932,2015-07-03,32548644,Mark,"It was a perfect stay.   The place was clean, spacious and nicely appointed.   They have a very handy guide to the neighborhood and we took advantage of walking to a local bar which was very friendly with good food (Maple Leaf Bar)  It's clear that Katrina really put thought into the place and takes pride in keeping it up.   We only stayed a night so didn't take advantage of the kitchen or washer and dryer and it would have been fun to explore the neighborhood more but we would definitely return.   Or host, Katrina was very responsive when we left messages, going so far to call a local restaurant to help us find a place to watch the Women's World Cup game.     "
5499882,38025137,2015-07-12,36568965,Sarah,The Hideaway was the perfect place for our family of four to stay.  The outdoor property is beautifully maintained and the apartment was roomy and clean.  Katrina was pleasant and easy to communicate with.  The fresh flowers placed around the apartment was a nice touch.  One of our favorite things was visiting with the adorable chickens.  The fresh eggs in the fridge were also a treat!  We would definitely stay there again if we return to the area.  
5499882,38486428,2015-07-16,30866052,Kristin,"The Hideaway was very much that you felt like you were in your own private home.  Very clean and comfortable. Neighborhood was very quiet.  
The fresh eggs were fantastic and the chickens were so fun to talk to. 
The hosts were very accommodating and wonderful people to talk with.
I would definitely recommend the Hideaway if you want a quiet place to stay after a long day roaming Seattle."
5499882,38702017,2015-07-18,5361765,Bonnie,"My daughter, her two young children, and I enjoyed our lovely night at the Hideaway. It is just a few short minutes north of the University District and was plenty of space for the four of us. How nice to have two bedrooms instead of sharing one hotel room. The many extras, including a good supply of games, and a dose of Emergen-C that my daughter needed, were appreciated. Thanks, Katrina!"
5499882,38993837,2015-07-20,16214283,Danielle,The Hideaway was very cozy and comfortable! Katrina was very easy to communicate with and made our stay great.  
5499882,39389965,2015-07-23,26456466,Xian,Katrina is very helpful. She provides fresh eggs and milk upon our arrival. The bed are very comfortable and cozy. There are enough amount of cookwares to use. 
5499882,39540739,2015-07-24,32526734,Donna,"We just needed beds to sleep in for the night on a road trip and Katrina fit us in to their busy schedule which I really (email hidden)e space was roomy and clean, just as the pictures show. She left a key for us bc our plans where up in the air as to when we'd arrive and we left early the next morning so we never actually met. My only grumble was the TV noise upstairs. I don't know if this was a typical night, but it was loud until 10pm...not a big deal, but thought I should note it. "
5499882,40318630,2015-07-30,31683221,Theresa,We had a great time staying here.  It was a great first experience with Air BnB.  I would definitely recommend The Hideaway to friends and family.  Katrina and her husband are very friendly and extremely accommodating.
5499882,41371015,2015-08-07,34151711,Douglas,"very happy with Katrina's place. Lots of nice extra touches. As she states a little removed from downtown Seattle, but very easy to travel back and forth. Our kids really enjoyed their time there."
5499882,41554474,2015-08-07,32768828,Svetlana,"Katrina was very responsive - she provided great instructions on how to get to her house from the airport, and stayed on top of our arrival times. The house is located in a very charming neighborhood with a bohemian, wholesome feel to it. Getting there with public transportation was a breathe, and we also explored the area on foot heading out to eat. Beautiful! 
The Hideaway was in top shape - very clean, with fully stocked kitchen and tons of goodies, including fresh eggs from the 4 friendly hens who live right in the garden. My kids spent a good couple of hours socializing with them. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay - the tasteful decor, the quiet surroundings, everything was great! Great selection of videos, too! I would stay here again. Thanks so much, Katrina! "
5499882,41934012,2015-08-10,20135478,Tabitha,Katrina has thought of everything in her cute hideaway. It was perfectly spacious and an awesome getaway for my friends and I. She made a list of areas around her place and we actually took most of them! Thank you Katrina!
5499882,42233885,2015-08-11,32875266,Siyu,really nice house and clean ！ quiet！ it is very comfortable. the entire area is like a small eco system！ so nice.
5499882,42674028,2015-08-15,31111330,Luke,"Katrina was a pleasure to do business with. Our stay was more than we imagined! The ""Hideaway"" is located in a perfect spot north of Seattle. The bus ride downtown took us 15 minutes, and was only two blocks away. Everything we needed was there...including fresh eggs, cream, and even some cold beer! Thank you for providing an amazing experience through AirBnB. We will definitely use your services again if we visit Seattle. 
-The Swearingen's"
5499882,43621036,2015-08-21,31945927,Sunny,"Katrina and John have done an excellent job of making The Hideaway a welcome little corner. We had to check in super late, and to make it worse our flight was delayed and we got there at 4 am, but thankfully Katrina's directions helped us get in easily and get a few great hours of sleep before we had to start our day. Fresh eggs and cream was ready for us in the fridge, and we were able to find everything we needed. We even needed an iron and iron board and Katrina was super helpful in providing them for us. All in all, best decision we made, and I'm happy I was able to have such great and easy experience! "
5499882,44190840,2015-08-24,40514337,April,We felt so at home and welcome. This was a cozy house and they made sure we had everything we could possibly need. (They even gave us some fresh ground coffee!) let us have s couple ripe tomatoes from their garden and they were super nice. We had a great stay!
5499882,44641639,2015-08-28,33276273,Cedric,"Katrina was a great host, that was very responsive and made our stay as comfortable as possible.  ""The Hideaway"" is in a great location.  We were provided ""free range"" (lol) hen eggs upon request and access to the use of a full kitchen and washer/dryer which was extremely useful traveling as a family of four.  The space was exactly as it is represented in the pictures and was more than adequate for our family.  We would definitely stay here again"
5499882,45241961,2015-09-01,28252989,Lisa,They made us feel right at home.  Loved the chickens!!!! I truly can't say enough about this place! It was perfect for us.
5499882,46118752,2015-09-08,1011435,Rhianna,"Our hosts were incredibly accommodating!  We arrived on Saturday to go to Bumbershoot and they arranged for us to drop our stuff off early so we could head to the festival.  But as is the case when travelling with kids we had a sick boy and needed the place earlier than we thought and they were amazing and just welcomed us in.  The next morning everyone felt better and we were off to Bumbershoot but not after playing with the chickens and hanging out in the beautiful yard!  The fresh eggs were delicious, my kids loved the colours:). I couldn't say nicer things about our hosts."
6781308,35045952,2015-06-14,35436099,Gain,Here is so fetch!!awesome. i really recommend here Timothy's house. she is really cool and she rock. i really thanks for her help. thank u :)
6781308,35191638,2015-06-15,5179333,Erika,"Overall very clean, comfortable bed, but definitely for the budget-minded only. 

We take ""kid-free"" weekend trips to Seattle and look for places that we like to hang out in, not just a place to sleep. The owners were great, it's located a short drive to downtown, Greenlake, Queen Anne, but we spent as little time as possible in the unit itself. Everything in the apartment is new, but it feels sterile and Ikea-like, couch is stiff. So not really lounge-friendly - it smells very strongly of a mixture of mustiness/dog plus air freshener (unfortunately parking lot and street noise are very loud if you open the window) the building, elevator feel pretty run down and you're literally on Highway 99 so neighborhood appeal is not there. 

If you stay here, you have access to an amazing community rooftop area that's awesome (tough to find but worth it) with killer views. Hosts are very friendly, respond super quick, really easy to work with. They're great. 

If you want a place to host friends that need parking, this is probably not the place for you.  "
6781308,35519030,2015-06-19,35743020,Pamela,"Timothy and Brittney were great! 
My boyfriend and I had been on a cross-country road trip (from NY to CA) and Seattle was one of our last stops. We got to Seattle in the late evening and weren't able to check in until late that night (around 10/11pm). Timothy was really understanding and provided explicit instructions for parking and checking in. 
Their apartment is wonderful -- clean, quaint, comfortable. There was even a guest book for us to sign! I wish we had been able to stay in Seattle longer to enjoy their apartment and recommendations even more."
6781308,36898406,2015-07-02,18699070,Kailan,"We stayed here for 8 nights (my husband and 2 kids) during our first visit to a Seattle. It was a perfect home base for us. Before we had arrived I thought that things were much farther apart, but I was surprised to see how close we were to everything! We had rented a car so it was a very easy trip to get to downtown, the zoo, the locks, and other restaurants in different neighborhoods. The parking spot is a little tricky with a pole and 2 cars that never seemed to be gone, but thankfully they put some padding around the pole that protected our car! We had a Ford Edge and I wouldn't recommend bringing anything much bigger here. 
Since this is right off Aurora/99 and almost to the Fremont Bridge, there isn't much to walk to around the neighborhood (with kids anyway), but that didn't bother us. 
Timothy and Brittney were great hosts!! They answered questions promptly and were very helpful. They provided us with a pack n play, high chair, and baby bath so we didn't have to rent them and my kids were so excited to see coloring books, sticker books, and bubbles!! Very thoughtful. They also put up a light blocking curtain over the patio door when they knew the blinds wouldn't be installed in time. 
The apartment itself was very clean and both beds were comfortable. It was very nice to be able to do laundry mid trip with kids and be able to cook breakfast every morning.  
We had a great trip, and I would recommend staying here!
"
6781308,37230603,2015-07-05,36578261,Dana,Such great access to everything!  Great communication!  Enjoyed our stay - and the fireworks from the balcony were great!
6781308,38873259,2015-07-19,9529037,Bryan,"Timothy was very helpful through messages. Although I never met him, he gave detailed instructions on how to get in and we had no problems. We had an infant, so it was great to be able to use the pack-n-play and high chair. The apartment is in kind of an awkward place to find if you don't know the area, but the view was nice. The parking space is somewhat hard to get in to, so I would be wary if you have a longer car or truck as you might have to park on the street a ways away. The apartment was nice and tidy, if rather Ikea-y. Plenty of clean dishes and towels, which was nice. No complaints overall."
6781308,39794022,2015-07-26,30363524,Roger,Great host! Had an awesome first experience with airbnb
6781308,40486227,2015-07-31,10872754,Kelley,"Best place to stay in Seattle! Timothy and Brittany have created a warm and comfortable, all-equipped, mod apartment that quickly became our home-base. We loved their home, and we loved the location in Queen Anne, close to downtown Seattle and near quirky Fremont. We frequented the local taverns, walked down to the lake, and felt right at home in there pad. 
Timothy and Brittany were at-the-ready to help with any needs, questions, concerns....communication, both written and verbal, was great!
I would highly recommend staying here--I'm glad we did!"
6781308,40764413,2015-08-02,1761596,Jessica,"The listing description and pictures are exactly like the actual unit. It's not terribly spacious for 4 people, but a great place to stay as a couple or with a small child since they have several baby items you can borrow. The location is off a major road, but it's easier to access around the back in a cul-de-sac. The building is recently remodeled as is the apartment and VERY clean. Plus Queen Anne and Fremont neighborhoods are so fun to walk around and less than 1.5 miles away."
6781308,41766647,2015-08-09,35501785,Kolby,"Two friends and I went to Seattle for a gaming convention and had an awesome time! Timothy was very accommodating, although I never met him in person he was very quick with responses via text or AirBnB message.  Great first experience with AirBnB!"
6781308,42342596,2015-08-12,6915679,Lindsay,"Fantastic apartment, clean, new, comfortable, lots of light and that roof deck!!! Great views of Gasworks Park and Lake Union from the private balcony and all the amenities you'd expect to find in your own home. Bed is super comfortable and Tim was a thoughtful and accessible host. Just hope it's available next time I'm up in Seattle!!"
6781308,43055731,2015-08-17,6356196,Heather,"Timothy and Brittany have a great apartment that really is minutes to downtown Seattle.  We did not have a car during our visit but had no problem catching the ""E"" express bus a few blocks away, or walking downtown in about 30 minutes (all downhill - important in Seattle :-) ). The building is located on a very busy thoroughfare, but the apartment faces the back and noise was not an issue.  The building's terrace at the back is a great spot to relax and barbecue, overlooking Lake Union.  Only minor disappointment is that there is nothing that you can walk to within a few blocks, but you can reach restaurants in Fremont or South Lake Union in about a 15 minute walk.  Furnishings are nice, bed is comfortable, kitchen has all the amenities you would need and then some.  Our two teenagers slept comfortably on the pullout in the living room.  Brittany went the extra mile and stocked the fridge with some breakfast foods as we were arriving late. Much appreciated.  A good base for exploring Seattle."
6781308,45214094,2015-08-31,42639266,Denice,"What can be said about Timothy and Brittney?  They're amazing!  We both got into Seattle quite earlier than anticipated, so I called T&B and asked them for an early check-in.  Because the previous renter had a late check-out, we were forced to wait until the 3pm check-in time.  That's when Brittney sprung into action and told me she would make every effort in getting the place ready in time to have us in earlier, and she'd give us a call.  Which she did.

She gave us a call at 2pm and let us know the place was ready.  We had went off sightseeing expecting a 3pm check-in, but we were VERY appreciative in her attempts at getting us in early.  Thinking we just wanted to drop off our bags, she offered to take in our bags early, but we honestly just wanted to get in there to take a nap, since we landed at 8am and hadn't slept all night.  She tried her best, and we are thankful for that!

The place was exactly as described, and the home was honestly cleaner than we expected.  Given we've never used Airbnb before, we expected the worst, and we arrived to a house that was so clean, you could eat off the floors, a bed so comfy, and ""homey"" that I felt like I was at home, in my own bed.  The shower has Shampoo/Conditioner/Soap provided, the only cosmetic thing I'd say needed help was a broken towel rack next to it, but that's not enough to drop it down a star.  The whole place looked like a model home, never touched by a human hand, and 409'd to the max.  This would be a germaphobe's dream apartment.

Lastly, she had danishes and Madeline's for the taking, which was a very nice touch.  We definitely took them on the way out, because we were starving."
6781308,48290356,2015-09-25,41055335,Hongyao,Everything is good and nice and clean. Timothy provided everything they could. Some of them are even beyond my expectations! Very nice place to stay!!! :)
6781308,48577631,2015-09-27,43302863,Stephanie,"We thoroughly enjoyed renting your condo in beautiful Seattle! Great location, clean quaint condo with nice amenities."
6781308,48952116,2015-09-29,31618392,Marisusan,"Timothy's place was (email hidden)ean, quiet, great access to Seattle's main attractions....very comfortable.  I appreciated access to the gym and the sky deck has amazing views.  Better than most AirBNB's that I have seen!!! Would love to come back."
6781308,49415789,2015-10-04,18024699,Mika,The host canceled this reservation 4 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
6781308,49492231,2015-10-04,42125003,John,"We couldn't have been more pleased with the apartment of the experience renting the apartment from Timothy and his wife.  The apartment was exactly as described and had a wonderful view of Lake  Union.  This was the perfect location for us to explore all that Seattle has to offer as it was central to everything.  It took us no more than 15 minutes to get anywhere in the city.  Check in and out was painless, and the entire process was extremely smooth.  This was very important being our first time on Airbnb.  The hosts were great and checked in regularly to see if we needed anything.  I would stay here again if we return to the Seattle area. Thanks Timothy. "
6781308,49828832,2015-10-06,44331277,Olivia,"Great little apartment. It felt spacious and it was well furnished with a flash TV, kitchen appliances etc... We got the bus into the centre of town which was very easy. We very much enjoyed our stay. "
6781308,52303317,2015-10-27,5350462,Randy,"The apartment was great, hard all the amenities you would need, and available on same-day notice! We enjoyed our stay."
6781308,52469347,2015-10-29,1131979,Leanne,"Probably one of the nicest spaces we have stayed in through Airbnb.  The location was perfect for us since the restaurants we wanted to go to were all a short drive away.  Soooo happy we didn't stay downtown.  Everything went smoothly; checking in, parking.  Great instructions.  Would highly recommend and would certainly stay again."
6781308,52922853,2015-11-02,47384144,Lyn,"Timothy and Britney were wonderful hosts. As a first time AirB&B Timothy helped me through the sign-up and reservation process. They contacted us via email the evening of check in to make sure everything was satisfactory. The condo was just as it was described and was excellent. It was particularly handy to have an assigned parking space. Of special note, I was traveling with someone whose mobility required a walker. The wood flooring was great for the walker and the shower seat was great for balance and stability. I look forward to staying there again."
6781308,53290954,2015-11-07,2940258,Alan,"Tim was a great host, easy to communicate with and the apartment was well prepared and spotlessly clean. Great location.
All-in-all a great experience. Thanks Tim!"
6781308,54522512,2015-11-21,3490931,Neil,"Tim's apartment was really great. The check-in was easy, and the apartment was clean,  with all the amenities we needed. I'd happily stay again."
6781308,54662651,2015-11-22,7530121,Aika,"The apartment was perfect and we loved the guest book and helpful tips in binder. Location was a bit tricky due to one way streets and narrow roads but once we found it, it was perfect! "
6781308,54904351,2015-11-25,18432287,Sunit,"Very neat and clean, extremely well thought through place in an excellent location. Everything that I needed for my stay was available at the house. Tim himself emailed me all the required details needed to get there. Highly recommended."
6781308,55431864,2015-12-01,713559,Jerrett,"Check in/out was very easy. The price was just right, and the location is amazing. Tim checked in on us a couple of times, but mostly it was a painless easy place to stay. The apartment is lovely, clean, has a nice view of the sunset, and the bed is one of the most comfortable I've ever slept in. And most of all, you get a parking space which is a rarity in Seattle!"
6781308,55842255,2015-12-06,8221677,Victoria,"The apartment was lovely and clean. The view from the Balcony was lovely we could see fantastic view of the water and city. Apartment was close to the city and having parking space was very helpful. The welcome manual was awesome, gave us some good ideas. Definitely a home away from home."
6781308,56138532,2015-12-09,49174194,Grant,"The flat was excellent, clean and well kitted out.

The house manual with directions, and instructions on how to get the keys and get into the flat was clear and concise.

We took the flat so we would have some space to invite some friends from Seattle over while we were in town. as it turns out we ended up going out both nights.

The building also has a reasonable gym which kept my wife happy
  "
6781308,56292272,2015-12-11,50908649,Ian,"I loved it. It had everything a hotel room had and more. 

Has all the little things you don't get with a hotel. You can open the windows up. There's a balcony. There's a full kitchen with a blender and dish washer. There is a high efficiency washer and dryer in the apartment complete with laundry detergent and dryer sheets.

You can sit out on the balcony and have a great view of the city and the water.

Even though the bedroom is completely inside the building there is a window that gets light, presumably, from the roof which is excellently reflected into the room by white walls. Thus, the entire apartment gets sunlight, which is extremely important to me after living in Phoenix for five years. 

I don't watch TV, so I didn't even think to turn either of the two TVs on, but I did use the internet which has great download speed and pretty good upload speed as well. 

There plenty of nice towels, great soap, shampoo (didn't use, don't have hair), a blow dryer (same), and even a vacuum cleaner. 

Picking up and dropping off the keys was extremely easy. You'll have no problems there. 

There is a designated parking spot, which worked out perfectly. It's a bit of tight squeeze and I had to back my car into it - which is what I always do anyway. Parking for my visitor (around 8:00 pm Thursday) was hard to find. I wound up letting her park in the designated spot and I parked about .5 - .75 miles away. To me, that's not a problem, but still something to be aware of if you plan to have guests over and you also have a car. 

There is a small convenience store within walking distance. They do add $0.25 to any credit/debit transaction, but it's better than getting in the car and driving to QFC or Safeway."
6781308,56513469,2015-12-14,39312228,Bruno,"From start to finish Tim was always there whenever we needed any questions answered. First time and stay in Seattle, I would say, was a total success! Thank you for making my girlfriend and I feel like family and at home. I will defiantly recommend this place to anyone looking for an intimate place to cook, kick back, and relax. Literally minuets from everywhere!

Thank you Tim!
 From Tori and Bruno"
6781308,56817099,2015-12-18,50993517,Heather,Timothy checked to make sure we got to the apartment okay.  That was very nice.  Busy traffic area but most of Seattle is.  Great views.
3157738,14001249,2014-06-09,11209241,Dan,Great house and wonderful hospitality! The Ballard neighborhood also lives up to its billing. I would definitely stay here again.
3157738,17442698,2014-08-12,2268301,Jane,"We loved our stay in this wonderful Ballard home.  The furnishings and decor were charming and the quiet back patio was lovely. Erin left great instructions and suggestions for enjoying the neighborhood - (don't miss Sunset Park! ) and got back to us right away when we had a question.  The location is within walking distance of central Ballard and we were happy to park the car and enjoy walking out to dinner, etc.  We would love to return here on our next visit to Seattle. Oh, and the blue hydrangea was stunning!"
3157738,18856904,2014-09-01,395470,Sophia,"Erin was a perfect hostess! Very comfortable and clean, easy to find, and speedy communication. She left recommendations for food, clear instructions about the house, and some great Seattle welcome gear. Pinch the cat is around the house and likes to share the bed, but is a sweet and funny host and is not in the way. I would definitely return to Erins house!"
3157738,21625718,2014-10-20,22284166,Michelle,"An adorable Ballard home in a fantastic neighborhood!  My friends and I had all previously lived in Seattle so we really just needed a home base, and this house was perfect.  The location offers close proximity to a bus line that goes to downtown, there's ample on-street parking, and there are many restaurants and bars within walking distance.
The decor is not only lovely, but comfortable.  The home cozy and enjoyable."
3157738,28342965,2015-03-22,11657317,Keri,"We loved this little house! It is a nicely updated 1920's home with a lovely period feel. The kitchen is a dream to work in due it's layout and all the appliances and utensils you need. Everything is so bright and homey. We stayed with our two teenage daughters and there was plenty of space. It is close to the funky shopping areas and good restaurants. We have stayed in downtown Seattle but much preferred the neighbourhood feel of Ballard. And sweet cat, Pinch, was a pleasure to have around. We want to come back again. "
3157738,38885763,2015-07-19,17198447,Teresa,"The Charming Craftsman Ballard was exactly (email hidden)arming!  The neighborhood was perfect for a first Seattle experience.  We loved the quaint kitchen and being able to barbeque and dining al fresco.  Erin's instructions were thorough and she was very responsive to any requests for information.  There was definite attention to detail in making guests comfortable with wonderful art on the wall, excellent book collection and welcoming flowers.  Pinch was a pleasure to share the house with.  A lovely experience."
3157738,40554328,2015-08-01,4071464,Lorie,"Erin's listing was just as described. Her charming home was lit and welcoming to our small wedding party. The wider street before the home accommodated our parking needs. Every bed was comfortable, the kitchen is well-stocked, and house and yard are decorated with loving detail. Eco-conscious, with a loving cat weaving in and out of the home, we left with sweet memories. This house is a treasure in Ballard, centrally located for exploring...or attending your daughter's wedding. "
3157738,42938178,2015-08-16,5958278,Whitney,"Erin was very quick to respond and was a great host! The house was in a perfect location and was absolutely perfect for what we needed. The bathroom lacked shelf/counter space, which wasn't a huge deal for us because we are used to small bathrooms. We would definitely recommend this house for a great weekend in Ballard!"
3157738,44963845,2015-08-30,40622033,Joileah,"The house was cute and clean! Erin was very accommodating with negotiating the check out time since check in is somewhat later at 6pm. The only problem was that Erin didn't mention that the house behind is under construction, and we woke up at 7:30am with hammering and staple guns right outside of the master bedroom window. The construction is also not shown in the posted pictures. Not a very relaxing getaway."
3157738,46019928,2015-09-07,40808287,Keith,We enjoyed our stay in Charming Craftsman in Ballard. The house was clean and as advertised with three good sized bedrooms. Erin left us with a bottle of wine which was a very nice gesture. Would recommend to anyone looking to stay in the seattle area.
8673979,49964632,2015-10-07,5971496,Lyra,"Lee's place is very small but nice. It's in a perfect location to explore Capitol Hill, the bed is comfortable, and she provides toiletries and snacks. Lee was very accommodating and communicative, which we appreciated. There's no kitchen, and no space to hang out, but there are plenty of restaurants, coffee, and bars within walking distance in the area."
8673979,50569574,2015-10-12,45774725,Scott,"The space was a little cozy, but we couldn't have asked for a better host!  Lee was extremely accommodating, and she went out of her way to make us feel comfortable."
8673979,51363043,2015-10-19,11919744,Andrew,"I highly recommend this space! Lee's place was incredible! It was just as advertised--clean, nicely decorated, chalked full of musical amenities, great roof access with views, and in a premium location with access to the amazing nightlife of Capitol Hill. Lee was extremely accommodating, and explained every detail of the space to us upon arrival. She even left us with some tasty snacks and wine, as well as a basket of toiletries and other travel needs.  You're literally steps away from the Broadway strip of Capitol Hill nightlife, and a short from downtown and the water. I come up from Portland fairly frequently, and Lee's studio will be my go to space to stay from now on! "
8673979,51516786,2015-10-20,13532031,Nicole,"Check in was fast and easy. Lee gave us a full tour of the property in capitol hill. It was a small space but perfect for what we needed. There are so many cool places to walk to around capitol
Hill, we did not spend much time in the room. Enjoyed the record player very much! "
8616606,50717290,2015-10-13,14860609,Kristy,"I had a wonderful stay at Kerry's place! The house was spacious and clean and I encountered no troubles.

8616606,51863639,2015-10-24,47012390,Fu Shen,"The house was clean, comfortable and well appointed. I really like the open design on the main floor where all the amenities are within comfortable reach. Having 2 master bedrooms with their own bathrooms is really a plus when staying with another friend or family member. I also took a walk to the park nearby and felt relaxed by the vast green space around me. Highly recommended when visiting Seattle.     "
8616606,52369041,2015-10-28,37798878,Paul,"Kerry was very prompt and extremely professional.  I didn't meet her in person, but she gave clear directions on how to access her place.  The neighborhood was great, with access to easy parking right out front.

This place is a gem.  It was very spacious, comfortable and probably the cleanest place I have ever stayed in. "
8616606,52894075,2015-11-02,41369490,Jason,Kerry's place was very clean and looks exactly like it does in the pictures she provided. The beds were very comfortable and I would definitely recommend staying here if you would like to visit Seattle.

The neighborhood is very safe and it is located very conveniently in Seattle close to Groceries and others. 
Seattle will always be one of our favorite places, however now we also found our go to rental! Will definately stay here again! 

Livia "
8616606,54132671,2015-11-16,28520038,Barbe,"Kerry was very responsive to questions about the rental and area.  On arrival the place was exactly as pictures show: clean, well appointed, great amenities, and very spacious.  The location was perfect for short commute into Seattle.  This was our best experience with Airbnb by far.  Exceeded expectations and reasonably priced."
8616606,54386403,2015-11-19,47181805,Wenyi,"We love our stay in Kerry's house so much. The house is well-maintained, clean, delicate, and has everything you need during the stay.  It is even better than the description. It has two suites upstairs and is ideal for two couples traveling together. The beds are comfortable. All other things are working well including the kitchen as we cooked one dinner during our stay. Kerry is very nice to offer help, give advice for out trip and timely responsive. We will recommend this place and definitely stay here again next time we come to Seattle."
8616606,55125757,2015-11-28,35179459,Saquib,"Great stay, just loved the house. Enjoyed every bit of stay the house was very nice, very modern and cozy with 2.5 bathroom. Kerry was very nice, responsive and very approachable. 
My kids loved staying at home and enjoyed the free Netflix. 
The house was 10 mins away from downtown Seattle and is within 5 mins of driving distance to shops (QFC)."
8616606,55450575,2015-12-01,9624025,Amy,"Kerry's place is fantastic. Very clean, modern and updated. We felt comfortable, and that it was an easy uber/taxi to all the places we wanted to go. 

Definitely recommend. 
"
8616606,58057304,2015-12-31,20780376,William,"This place is awesome, large space, clean bed linen and great location. This is our first time using AirBNB and this place fulfilled all needs we have. Would definitely recommended this place in Seattle "
8174943,46084147,2015-09-07,55570,LeiLa,"AMAZING STAY! Lawrence was super welcoming and friendly. The space was fantastic! We had an entire private floor with bedroom and bathroom, with our own outdoor patio. And the Netflix and computer hook-up was completely perfect! The location was also perfect. Super close to a bus that went right downtown (and ran late so we could get back no problem), and barely a 15 minute drive to the Space Needle if we wanted to drive ourselves. Will DEFINITELY be back!"
8174943,46361450,2015-09-09,11479422,Ryan,Lawrence was a great welcome to the city giving us great advice on local eateries and things to see in the city
8174943,48157558,2015-09-23,824483,Jon,"Great space in great Neighborhood, enjoyed our time here."
8174943,48442535,2015-09-26,43735686,Leona,"My boyfriend and I had the most enjoyable stay! Here's the scoop about what you will expect:  key code for entry, quite and safe neighbourhood, comfortable room, private washroom, and available computer/TV in the room with accessible USB ports on the desk for your  charging needs.  Also, he reserved space in the fridge for us and it was very convenient to prepare food.  The icing on the cake, however, is the warmth and depth to this Man. What a knowledgeable person! If you need pointers about and around  the city, he is helpful. Another key point for planning needs, he is very responsive to messages."
6811792,43551879,2015-08-20,20237009,Krissy,"This was my first airbnb experience, and what a great one!  Everything was exactly as described and pictured in the listing.  My husband and parents and I felt clean, comfortable, and safe in Mercy's home.  Thanks for having us!"
6811792,48273622,2015-09-25,12952679,Paul,The listing was accurate and Mercy stopped by to drop off additional towels.  The apartment was furnished as advertised and everything was neat and clean.

6811792,50519360,2015-10-12,44225044,Abdul,Everything was clean and prepped for our arrival. The house was vacuumed. Mercy included any information we needed in the email and the instructions were easy to follow. The neighborhood was great. Only a 15 minute drive to downtown Seattle. Would definitely recommend.
119103,315136,2011-06-14,371623,Caroline,"We had a great stay in the guesthouse. Slept very well on the Murphy bed and awoke to the sounds of chirping birds! What a treat to the ears when in the city. We enjoyed sitting up on the roof, a great view and really eclectic and creative structure. I would definitely stay again."
119103,356685,2011-07-06,661255,Laurence,"My boyfriend and I both agree about this little gem of a place: it exceeded all of our expectations! Sure, it's a small space...but it's incredible how it includes everything you'll need! Hal is a wonderful, thoughtful host. He offered us lots of insights on the hotspots to visit in the neighborhood as well as in downtown Seattle. 

If you're looking for a comfortable and affordable place to stay in Seattle, this is it!"
119103,404625,2011-07-29,326167,Amelia,"If you want an authentic Freemont experience this is the place to stay! Hal's creation is amazing and the view from the ""porch"" couldn't be better. I highly recommend! "
119103,418453,2011-08-03,864701,Ken,"This was the perfect abode for rendezvousing with our 16 year year old returning from his Alaska experience.     This small apartment borrows from Eastern ingenuity out there on the Pacific Rim.    The Fremont neighborhood is ideal for absorbing the multicultural eclectic Seattle experience.   Nearby transit, restaurant and cultural amenities along with Hal's good nature and friendliness make this a great place to stay!"
119103,463092,2011-08-21,68287,Thomas,"Hal's Guestyhouse is the perfect little Seattle getaway in the middle of the wonderful neighborhood of Fremont. It was easy to get there from the airport––take the Light Link to downtown Seattle, where we could catch the (phone number hidden), or a couple other buses that went to Fremont. We often used the One Bus Away app that Hal recommended to find out which bus to hop on and where. 

When we first arrived Hal had prepared the space very nicely, including some healthy snacks which were nice to have after a long flight. He also gave us a quick walking tour and pointed us in the direction of restaurants, bars, and coffee shops around us. The food and coffee options in Fremont were so good that we were not left wanting. 

The Guestyhouse provided us with the perfect home base while in Seattle; we had lovely conversations with Hal whenever our paths crossed, and the space was comfortable and homey. Hal's design and construction talents are Seattle sights in and of themselves!

The Guestyhouse is a perfect location for travelers who would like to explore local neighborhoods and want easy access to downtown for the typical tourist stuff, while also experiencing highly unique accommodations. Next time we come to Seattle we'll definitely look here first for availability."
119103,493827,2011-09-01,986498,Frank,"I felt at home, but the place is tiny so it might not be for everyone. I wish Hal was my neighbor and it was the best possible location in Fremont as far as I'm concerned."
119103,500775,2011-09-04,627196,Christopher,"Hal has definitely the most interesting and unique place you can stay at in Seattle and is very welcoming to boot.  One caveat: parking is difficult in the area, so this place is best for those who want to leave their car parked during the stay and walk, bike, and take transit around Seattle.  Transit options are great with direct routes to the Space Needle, downtown Seattle, the University of Washington, and Safeco Field/Century Link field (where the Mariners and Seahawks play)."
119103,520639,2011-09-11,922081,Olga,"My parents stayed for four nights at Hal's amazing Teeny Tiny Guesthouse, and they really enjoyed it. They were out a lot, and didn't see Hal much, but when they saw him he was very friendly and gave good insight information about the neighborhood. He also provided them with some fruit and snacks for the first day(s), a really nice touch! I didn't sleep here myself, but I know my parents were very satisfied with the place, and liked the experience of staying at a local's place and getting to know the neighborhood a little bit."
119103,532521,2011-09-14,575868,Michael,"Hal's a great guy and a great host. Guesthouse was tiny, but amazingly efficient and comfortable. Great neighborhood.
"
119103,567182,2011-09-25,1183851,Joseph,"It was fantastic. I loved the area. Parking sucked but it was also Oktoberfest. So down side was that, but overall it was 5stars. Very cool. "
119103,620337,2011-10-11,1209010,Charles,"I had a fantastic time in Seattle staying at the Tiny Guesthouse!  I went there for a 3 day weekend with a buddy of mine and we really enjoyed staying there.  I was drawn to the place because I'm interested in compact living, and I was really impressed.  Despite being small it has all the comforts of home, including comfy beds (both the garage door murphy bed and the loft beds were really nice) and very functional plumbing!  It's nice that the bed converts into a chair so we could watch some movies using the fast wifi.  Hal is a really nice guy, showed us around Fremont a bit and had some good recommendations for things we should do in Seattle.  He also had all the beddings ready to go, plus some yogurt/fruit/muffins - sweet!  And you really can't beat the location - Fremont is a cool neighborhood and it's ridiculously easy to hop on a bus to anywhere else in the city.  Overall, highly recommended!"
119103,665299,2011-10-25,1323127,Carrie,The Tiny Guesthouse was perfect. I had a lovely time there; slept very well up in the loft. I took public transit around so didn't have to cope with parking. I think the Guesthouse is BRILLIANT and I feel lucky to have found it on airbnb. Hal is a great host and I felt very comfortable. Thank you for a wonderful stay!
119103,800106,2011-12-22,1454720,Erik,I was there taking the landmark forum and the tiny house was a perfect location without any trouble getting around the neighborhood. Make sure you watch the video b4 booking. It's not for everyone. 
119103,827574,2012-01-02,981455,Kim,Hal was a gracious and helpful host. He enthusiastically greeted us upon arrival. Showed us how to best use the space and enjoy it. He shared his favorite local hot spot ideas with us and even bought us tasty snacks for our stay. Three of us stayed in this tiny wee wonder for a night and were both pleased with the functionality of the space and felt like we had plenty of space to co-exist. I would stay there again in a heartbeat. The beds were comfortable and we gleaned several design ideas for our own tiny houses. Thanks Hal!
119103,955225,2012-02-27,1761368,Lisa,"I would definitely stay in Hal's guestyhouse again!  It is an inspiring example of what can be done with a small space, a creative mind, and able hands.  Although we didn't get to meet Hal due to a family emergency, we had several phone exchanges and he made us feel completely welcome.  The whole experience was just right.  Lisa G"
119103,993956,2012-03-13,1615621,Ventsi,"The Tiny house was great. I had my expectation set right after watching the video intro and the house was exactly as I imagined. Staying there felt like an adventure. The place was warm and the shower worked great. Hal, had left delicious pastry and fruits in the house for me that made the stay even nicer."
119103,1035512,2012-03-23,1927465,Jeremy,"Hal is a genuine crafty craftsman through and through.   The Teeny Tiny Guesthouse is great for two people who work well together and can play the dance of tight spaces.  Teeny Tiny is simple, effective, and the most creative use of 68 sq ft that I've ever seen.   The neighborhood is amazing and the variety of buses will get you anywhere you need to go in 20 minutes.   In this place, Seattle will surely be an adventure."
119103,1107368,2012-04-10,545121,Ryan,"What an amazing teeny tiny place. It is a creative space that is well thought out . Breakfast on the rooftop lawn was a hilight. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and would consider staying again next time we are in the area.

Hal was great host. We communicated via txt and met him in person. He was very helpful with driving directions, operating instructions, and advice on what to do and where to go in the area. 
-Thank You! "
119103,1125563,2012-04-13,196889,Cat,"Hal was a fantastic, friendly host. Great communication. Left goodies in the room. Told me about the neighborhood and the house. 

The tiny guest house was amazing. I absolutely loved it and I hope to stay here every single time I visit Seattle. It has so much character & soul unlike dreary hotel rooms. Thanks Hal for a great stay! Perfect house, perfect location."
119103,1249714,2012-05-08,542287,Erin,"The TTGH is quite possibly one of the coolest and cleverest spaces I've ever been in.  It was an oasis in the city and served as the perfect home-away-from home for me during my very busy stay in Seattle. It was just me, so I slept in the loft bed and enjoyed the view of the terrace and the light that comes in to the top bunk, and it was plenty of space for me as a single person.  I did invite a couple of friends over to see the place I thought was so genius, and they agreed with me on the coolness as well as comfort factors.  Hal's a great host and even left me a surprise treat of fresh fruit, yogurt, and yummy pastries from PCC, not to mention a well stocked tea selection which, as a tea drinker, I made much use of. I'd happily stay here again and again. "
119103,1296533,2012-05-17,2307387,Jennifer,"The Teeny Tiny Guestyhouse is a fantastic place to stay!  It is a brilliant use of space (especially if you are interested in light footprint living), a great location and Hal is a fantastic host!  I immediately felt at home.  There are many bonuses to staying here also:  goodies for eating, a bicycle to go exploring, friendly neighbors and Hal is great!  I cannot recommend this place enough.  If I ever go back to Seattle, I would check to see if I could stay here first!"
119103,1435507,2012-06-07,782506,Trisha,"The tiny house was perfect for my needs.  Hal was accessible, but didn't hover. The setting is delightful; in kooky cool Fremont.  Hal had left me some fruit and snacks.  After my long drive, it was so nice to collapse and munch. If you are ok with small spaces, this is a treat.."
119103,1465768,2012-06-12,2146621,William,"My wife and I had a great time. Hal's Tiny Guest House a was terrific place to stay, small but very comfortable. Awesome location, you can walk to any of Fremont's spotlights and easily catch buses to anywhere in Seattle. A tip for fliers, you can reserve a shuttle for $30-50, tell them the address is 640 N 38th and they will drop you at Hal's back door. Already planning to go back."
119103,1551302,2012-06-24,2623109,Anna,"The tiny guest house was great!  We traveled there on our honeymoon a couple of weeks ago.  The location is perfect, right in the middle of Fremont.  Hal was a wonderful host; he is a really fun, creative guy to meet and gave us valuable advice about the area and other fun spots in the northwest.  We had the chance to meet him when we first arrived, he took the time to show us the neighborhood and we grabbed a bite to eat.  He also left us great snacks/fruit/breakfasty food in the tiny house and flowers, very thoughtful.  We went to the following thanks to his advice:  Fremont Coffee, a great live music show, jai thai, Theo's Chocolate Factory (the tours are fun, and chocolate is delicious!!), and Lake Crescent Lodge in Olympic National Park (breathtaking... we were on a road trip and really appreciated this recommendation).  

The house itself is creative and just plain awesome.  We joked that we could live in a place that size, if only we were true minimalists and owned almost nothing.  It has a high ceiling and plenty of sleeping space, and the water pressure in the shower is great.

"
119103,1576041,2012-06-27,694408,Daryl,"The Teeny Tiny Guesthouse is the best place you can stay when in Seattle. Hal's place is located in Fremont, also known as the center of the universe and Hal has created a 68 sq ft house thats super comfortable and very functional. I felt like I was camping and would stay there again whenever I come back to Seattle. There are great restaurants and stores close by as well as easy access to downtown Seattle by public transit."
119103,1668518,2012-07-09,2716325,Robert,"Loved Hal's Teeny Tiny Guesthouse.
Everything was just as advertised and more.
It's a small space, but makes up for it in character, and charm.
Great neighborhood (my favorite in Seattle) close to good food, drink and entertainment. Would highly recommend it for anyone looking for a nice relaxing stay. "
119103,1775758,2012-07-23,2353461,Molly,"This teeny, tiny awesome place is in a fantastic location (the heart of Fremont) and feels like staying in an enchanted treehouse. Hal left us all sorts of delicious treats, and the house was spic-and-span. Can't recommend it enough, and we can't wait to go back for another visit. Do not hesitate to book this spot! Magical."
119103,1806699,2012-07-26,2813906,Kyle,"What an amazing host and place to stay! Hal was very friendly and a perfect source for fun local things to do in his area of Seattle. We had a spectacular trip and staying at the TTGH was definitely the highlight.

Highly recommended! "
119103,1822993,2012-07-28,821424,Jacqueline,"Hal was a fantastic host and the teeny tiny guesthouse was great. I was only there for two nights and wish I could have stayed longer just to enjoy the neighborhood and guesthouse.

The place was clean and although yes, tiny, everything was easy and actually fun to use. Hal had pastries and fruit waiting for me upon my arrival, was very easy to communicate with, and flexible with my checkin time.

Would definitely recommend staying with Hal!"
119103,1871502,2012-08-02,2985584,Steve,The Tiny House would be quite fun to stay in if it were anywhere really! I enjoyed establishing a routine to move/prepare things in order to function. I wish I had the view from the sleeping loft from my bed at home! The place is close to restaurants and bars and the bikes are good for visiting Gasworks park. 
119103,1901592,2012-08-06,356281,Sarah,"I loved my stay a the Teeny Tiny Guesthouse! The place itself is amazing, full of light and, though teeny, not claustrophobic at all. Hal was a great host, greeting me when I arrived, available for questions, and stocked the place with tasty treats. The neighborhood is great, and walkable to restaurants, shops, bars, a Sunday market, etc. I'll definitely come back next time I'm in Seattle!"
119103,1948269,2012-08-11,111054,Sylla,"Great stay at the TTGH! Way better than a hotel. I was in Seattle on business and stayed at Hal's place as an alternative. The location was great - in the lively Fremont area - and walkable to just about everything you might need. Hal left some fruit, tea and scones which was a nice way to start each morning. I loved how creative Hal has been in building the TTGH - small, but it has everything you need! Thanks for a great stay!

Thanks again, we hope to be back! – Matt and Jenna
"
119103,2110222,2012-08-27,207469,Caitlin,"My boyfriend and I had such a great time staying at Hal's Teeny Tiny Guesthouse. It truly is tiny but the thoughtfulness in design made it very easy to live in. Hal was also a fantastic host. He was there when we needed him but never hovered. I would highly recommend staying here, especially if you want to explore the Fremont area! 

Thanks for sharing your home with us Hal! "
119103,2143197,2012-08-30,2416357,Sarah,"This little guesthouse could not have been more perfect.  My hubby and I originally assumed we'd be out and about so much (considering the amazing location) that simply sleeping in an itty bitty space would be no problem, but then we just wanted to hang out there!  The lofted bed is a perfect reading nook with the open windows and the bathroom is surprisingly functional (with amazing water pressure!). Coffee on the lawn overlooking Seattle was the perfect way to start the day.  

Hal, the host is full of fantastic recommendations and even left some local goodies for us when we arrived!  Lots of sheets and blankets and pillows and everything else to make guests comfy.  5 stars from us!  We'll definitely be back!"
119103,2163037,2012-09-01,3212465,Jim,"Very functional, well-designed place to stay.  Great location, Hal is a great reference for sightseeing and getting around Seattle.  Would highly recommend to anyone..."
119103,2207966,2012-09-05,3186002,Crawford,"My girlfriend and I had the best time at the Teeny Tiny Cabin!  Hal was super helpful not only because of his excellent hospitality skills, but  also because he was chock full of info and (website hidden) about seattle's sites and scenes (no alliteration intended).  The cabin is really very cozy and private, and fulfilled our every need.  I very highly suggest you stay here!"
119103,2268063,2012-09-11,3453780,Michelle,"Super cute and cozy little guesthouse. The location is perfect, it's quiet and fully-equipped with everything you'll need. And Hal is great. It was lovely - I recommend it and hope to stay there again."
119103,2291529,2012-09-14,1501102,Ann,"Hal's Teeny Tiny Guesthouse was even better than I had expected. The space is 100% functional, no square foot wasted.

119103,2360022,2012-09-21,210400,Marcus,So many positive reviews already that I feel like I don't have too much to add. Hal is avery friendly and approachable host. The neighborhood is very pleasant and relatively close to downtown Seattle. The guesthouse itself is fun and very cleverly constructed. And when the weather nice (as it was during my stay) you get the actual feeling of being on a vacation somewhere far south of the Pacific northwest.
119103,2379358,2012-09-23,2863041,Ron And Jan,"It was a real kick staying in Hal's Teeny Tiny Guesthouse.  So clever.  The sleeping accommodations were surprisingly comfortable and it was amazingly quite, being only a block from where the Fremont action is.

Hal is a great host and fun to talk to.  He gave us some great suggestions for restaurants etc.  When we got into the teeny space we found a nice basket of fresh organic fruit, chips and croissants to munch on."
119103,2411977,2012-09-25,3441724,Jaclyn,"Bigger than we expected! We had a great time in the Teeny Tiny Guestyhouse. Hal was an excellent host and the accommodations were fantastic. My friend and I fit comfortably with room for luggage. The location is amazing--close to bars, restaurants, and the Sunday Market. The only downside--location! It got a little noisy Saturday night but it was also Oktoberfest so Fremont was busier than normal. This guesthouse is so unique and full of clever and ingenious little touches. And the pastries Hal left were a nice surprise and incredibly tasty. I would recommend this to anyone! "
119103,2747304,2012-10-29,3646329,Katie,Hal was a great host!  He left a sweet selection of snacks in the guest house and he seemed to have thought of everything.  He even left an umbrella in the guesty house which came in very handy for me.  The Teeny Tiny Guesty House was perfect for me.  I would definitely stay there again if I have the chance.  I also wanted to mention that I rented a car for this trip and I got very lucky and got a space very close to the Guesty House.  I fearfully gave up my space on Saturday afternoon to drive to Alki but when I got back I found another open spot on the same very close block.
119103,2865793,2012-11-12,3905535,Ben,"Hal was a great host. He had some fruit, croissants, and yogurt for us, and even gave us some cider. Unfortunately, we never got around to having any of it, but the thought was very much appreciated! He gave us some great recommendations about the Fremont area and beyond.

The guesthouse was great! I slept in the loft and was surprised how comfortable it was. My friend assured me that the garage door murphy bed was also comfortable. Another surprise was the great water pressure in the shower. It also stayed nice and warm in there, which was good, since we visited in November.

The neighborhood had some great restaurants, bars, and shops, and Hal did a great job of telling us which to visit and which to avoid. He also recommended visiting the Fremont Sunday Market, which you should do, too!

Thanks, Hal!"
119103,2887729,2012-11-15,3894856,Shaunie,"What an absolutely PERFECT little house. No detail was missed! We (3) were very comfortable and had everything we needed. Upon arrival Hal was waiving in the street to help us locate him, although easy to find, I get turned around alot! Goodies awaited us in case we were hungry from the local market. And I must mention the water... pressure... is...phenomenal! We were able to visit every area we wanted to by simply hopping on a bus. Pike Street Market, The pier, Shopping, Dining, The Zoo, Capitol Hill, The University of Washington, etc. Having never been to Seattle, those are the places I had mapped out to go, however once I arrived, I didn't want to leave the neighborhood of Fremont, where the Guestyhouse is located. Very very friendly, trendy, organic markets, bars, salons, art, amazing food, and so much more! I will for sure be back to stay with Hal! Thank you!!!"
119103,2949453,2012-11-24,3273603,Donna,"Teeny Tiny Guesthouse is ingenious in it's use of space.  The longer you stay that more you can appreciate that every nook and cranny has been used to the utmost.  My host went out of his way to make me feel comfortable with delicious treats waiting for my future breakfasts and a tour of the amenities of my tiny guest house.  Amazing to believe how much can fit in such a tiny house.  Ultimately however, I felt a tad uncomfortable because I am an architect and as the cottage is homemade, it felt just a tiny bit unsafe.  There was a metal part to the hydraulic lift that was left protruding into my bed area.  I put a pillow over it and never did bump my head.  The tea kettle is the kind that does not forgive if you don't turn it off.  On the plus side, the location is perfect.  I discovered the Burke Gilman trail which is beautiful for a runner, and my sister lives close enough to walk.  But somehow for 80 dollars, it seemed too much for what it was, a glamorous tool shed in a not so glamorous back yard.  "
119103,3203748,2012-12-31,4489076,Paul,"Before moving to Vancouver Island, I lived in the Fremont neighborhood for 8 years.  Hal's place embodies the personality of the neighborhood; you can't go wrong using it as a launch-pad for exploration of the area.  

If you can, take the time to get to know Hal.  He's a great host and fun to talk to about anything and everything.   And, while I didn't take advantage of it, I'm sure Hal could steer you in the right direction if you want some tips on what to do locally.
"
119103,3229594,2013-01-02,4404709,Andrew,"The 'Teeny Tiny Guest House' was great fun.
We stayed in it for two nights with our five year old and she didn't want to leave. If you have small children they will love it. How often do they get to take a bath in the living room and sleep in a loft bed that looks out at ground level? 

Everything works and advertised and there is now a stereo with a line in for your ipod. Nice touch.  

Great location and Hal is a super friendly host.  

"
119103,3332811,2013-01-12,4440996,Jim,"Hal was warm and welcoming. Had the heat on for us on a cold day. Nice fruit basket, coffee and tea. This place is not luxurious but very cozy. Great location in  walking distance of everything. Very clean!"
119103,3425406,2013-01-28,4196363,Tris & Taia,"We loved our stay at the Clubhouse. It is in the best part of Fremont, and Hal's recommendations were spot on (Roxie's, Revel, Theo, etc). There were lots of homely touches that made the place cosy and welcoming. We just wish we were there for some sunshine to utilise the adorable outdoor spaces. Thanks Hal. "
119103,3454559,2013-02-01,4723500,Sean,"You're on airbnb right now, and that means you're probably in the market for an experience: a chance to see new things, meet cool people, and create some memories you'll always look back on (or at least be able to turn into a great/hilarious story) while still enjoying yourself in the moment. That's exactly what you're going to get at the Teeny Tiny Guestyhouse.

And let's be clear: it is Teeny Tiny. However, I am 6'4"" and I did not bump my head nor stub my toe even once. The house is incredibly clever without being fussy. It's charming and practical from top to bottom. It's also private, quiet, and safe, but within easy walking distance of some great restaurants, shops, and bars, and several buses to the whole rest of the city.

Hal is a great guy and his directions were top notch. I'd never been to Seattle before but his directions took me straight to his door on the first shot. He met me, gave me a quick orientation, and then gave me all the space I needed.

I'm not used to having the place I toss my bag and sleep be one of the highlights of a trip, but it was. Thanks Hal!"
119103,3473496,2013-02-04,1800880,Bay,"Hal and the Teeny Tiny Guesthouse is AMAZING! 

What a great way to enjoy one of Seattle's best neighborhoods, Fremont.

I will absolutely be reserving Hal's Teeny Tiny Guestyhouse again.

Thanks Hal!"
119103,3650617,2013-02-27,5108864,Brian,"Once you view the video you're sold or you're not! I was completely drawn in by the nature of the Teeny Guestroom. Also in the 6'4"" + range, felt very comfortable. Fremont is a great neighborhood as well, but as soon as I settled in, it was great to have this small personal space, well off the street and in a quiet neighborhood. Good for writing with Ipod music in the background. Some fresh fruit, pastries and a few items in the fridge were a pleasant surprise too. Looking forward to returning another time in the future, and will recommend to any friends who need ideas for visitors to try it out as well. "
119103,3799155,2013-03-16,5008344,Ben,"The guesthouse was lovely and clean when I arrived, with some surprise refreshments from the natural market down the hill.  The beds were surprisingly comfortable and the water pressure in the shower was amazing.  The little heater took about 5 minutes to warm up the whole house as I unpacked, and there was a clock radio with a connection for my portable media device.  I stayed for a week and had an easy commute to UW along the Burke-Gilman trail, about 20 minutes from door to door via loaner bike.  Internet worked fine.  Hal checked in (from New Zealand) and made sure everything was OK, and Colin, to whom he had delegated guest care, was responsive when I texted him about my arrival and departure logistics.

The guesthouse was really cool; as an engineer I really appreciated all the thinking that Hal put into it.  You can really feel like a natural part of this well-planned environment as you climb around and use the furniture.  ""Usable"" is the key word -- I didn't find myself lacking any material comfort during my stay (except a wrench for the bikes' seat height and a squeegee, both of which Hal said he would rectify ASAP)."
119103,3914331,2013-03-26,107310,Chip,"I am tempted to leave a bad review because if i tell everyone how great the visit was, it will never be free when I visit Seattle in the future. The truth is that it was bomb-diddly. From the location to the little touches it was the icing on a great visit with my daughters in Seattle."
119103,4153821,2013-04-14,5814967,Julia,"Staying in Hal's little Guesthouse was more than we could wish for. The pictures and videos actually left us expecting it to be even smaller, but we were surprised how comfortable and savvy the entire place was. The welcome (although unfortunately without Hal himself!) was really great after a long trip and both Mark and I can't wait to get back to Seattle!"
119103,4368514,2013-04-30,5944215,Stefan,"Hal is an absolutely lovely guy, with a fantastic space which I would recommend to anyone after a comfortable and interesting stay in Seattle!

My girlfriend and I stayed at Hal's guest house for four nights and five days. It was a really great experience. We arrived and saw that a gift basket had been laid out for us with fruits and yogurts, which was a lovely surprise after a long trip down from Vancouver! The guest house was bigger than it looked in the video and never failed to amaze us with it's ingenuity and use of space. We were comfortable and felt at home immediately, the room is very private for those who desire it. Fremont is a really nice suburb, with plenty to see, while still being a short bus ride from downtown. I only met Hal on the day before I left, but he was a genuinely friendly and interesting guy, with a wealth of knowledge on the area and is up for a chat! Just can't recommend highly enough!"
119103,4653683,2013-05-18,6259172,Andrew,"Hal is an amazing man, he made our stay more than good. It was great"

119103,4891567,2013-05-31,6200641,Ryan,"loved the tiny guesthouse. it had everything you would need and was very well thought-out for the space. not sure but we may have been the largest group to stay here. Four of us although one was an 8 month old baby so that makes it workable. our 8 YEAR old absolutely loved it. she had the perfect little loft area which she had to climb a couple ladders to get to and then to top it off she got to climb out the window to stand on a grassy rooftop (with an amazing view btw). my wife and i enjoyed it too. private, warm, safe and in a phenomenal neighborhood. go to the pie place down the street!!! and the market (like a whole foods) is near for all the things you forgot or ran out of or just for some snacks. oh and i cant forget the blankets and sheets, my wife loved them and she is very picky on that kind of thing, confortable, clean and funky. the place is just too cute ok. id go back for sure. Also Hal is one nice dude. very helpful and just a guy after our own hearts. book it now! its all about fun experiences right?!"
119103,4997733,2013-06-06,96040,Katherine,"Well for starters this is a SUPER cool place to stay.  Great neighbouhood, easy access to downtown not to mention the area has great places to eat!!! 

Hal was equally super and we were blown away at his hospitality.  There was fruit, baked goods, tea and milk waiting for us which came in handy during our short stay.  

This was a great space for my boyfriend and I to spend time together and we felt right at home right away.  We really can't wait to come back!!!   

This is a must see and stay kind of place! "
119103,5101567,2013-06-12,5860495,Magnus,"We had a great time in the tiny guesthouse. Hal is the perfect host and amazingly
hospitable. The guesthouse is as tiny as described, but even more comfortable than we
thought when booking. Sitting on the rooftop, watching over the neighborhood was amazing.
All in all, a great place to stay with a lovely neighborhood and a very short distance
downtown with public transportation. BTW, don't let anybody tell you that you must have a
car in Seattle. It's a lie. Bus, walk, cycle.
"
119103,5131618,2013-06-14,70529,Rachel,"Hal was a great host - friendly, full of good suggestions, and easy to communicate with. The guest house is totally unique. It manages to feel way more spacious than it is, and was a very comfortable place for the two of us. Te neighborhood is awesome - lots of independent shops, restaurants, and coffee shops to choose from. I'd definitely stay here again!"
119103,5230766,2013-06-19,2721068,Penny,"I wanted to see what it would be like to live in a tiny house.  This was a fun one!  Hal has done a great job in making a very small space cozy and comfortable.  He was kind enough to leave food for breakfast, took time to tell me about things in the area, and was very kind about a glitch in my schedule.  I really appreciated his helpfulness.  One thing about this tiny house is that the shower was anything but tiny!  It was awesome!  I was not expecting it to work so well.  This seems like a strange thing to comment on but it was really appreciated after a sticky day.  Thanks Hal!  Penny "
119103,5261819,2013-06-21,4901638,Shelly,"When I saw this video I added staying here to my bucket list. This was a really fun place to stay. Everything is so functional but still pleasant to look at and live in. The bathroom seems much bigger than in the video. My friend and I stayed here and there was plenty of room for both of us. Hal is really interesting to talk with and is so genuine and friendly. He also left us a basket of fruit, some pastries, and milk and yogurt in the fridge. I definitely recommend this place and would love to stay here again."
119103,5316910,2013-06-24,6421834,Rachael,"The Teeny Tiny Guesthouse is a feat of engineering genius, Hal was an excellent host and the location is fantastically situated in Seattle's Fremont neighborhood. I would definitely stay here again!"

Every detail has been thought out to make it very comfortable.  It is walking distance to a fun part of Seattle.  There are plenty of great places to eat and drink just around the corner.  Hal is a magnificent host with local knowledge that he's willing to share!!"
119103,5525316,2013-07-04,6197677,Rachel,"I had a great experience in Seattle, in large part due to the wonderful, treehouse-like guesthouse, and Hal's generosity as a host. If you're planning a trip, I highly recommend Hal's place - great neighborhood, space, and host.

119103,5579908,2013-07-07,370937,Katie,Loved loved loved this Teeny Tiny place and Hal was the perfect host. The fridge was even stocked with fresh milk and yoghurt and pastries and fruit. Wonderful. 
119103,5751834,2013-07-15,6281985,Sarah,"Super sweet!  Perfect for us on our getaway from parenting.  The quirky and inventive details are right up our alley.  A true creative Fremont experience. Loved the green roof, the garage door murphy bed, the carefully curated objects. Nice touch with the breakfast goodies.  Hal was friendly and communicative.  We'd definitely come back and recommend it to others (already have).
"
119103,5827596,2013-07-18,235420,Rosa,"Hal was very responsive and helpful from the moment I sent my initial e-mail requesting to reserve the guesthouse for three nights. His directions were detailed and he was there to greet us when we arrived. We enjoyed hearing his recommendations of where to eat in the neighborhood, and followed his advice to visit the Sunday crafts market in Fremont. My 11-year-old son immediately fell in love with the tiny guesthouse. He climbed the ladder and soon was up on the roof terrace waving at us. His dream is now to buy the guesthouse from Hal, but I don't think he intends to sell it! He has been telling people about the great view from the terrace and how much he enjoyed watching the sun set. The guesthouse is not spacious (it's not called Teeny Tiny for nothing), but it has everything you need and the shower is surprisingly pleasant. We both slept perfectly comfortably. Definitely a unique experience in a great neighborhood. "
119103,5883335,2013-07-21,6120884,Laura,Stunning location. Inspiring accommodation. Hal's creativity and enthusiasm come through in a wonderful experience for his guests. This little gem is quiet and comfy. We'll be back!
119103,5942953,2013-07-23,808158,Cordula,"The teeny tiny guesthouse=amazing!! 
When I arrived at the TTGH, Hal was there to greet me and give me a tour of the GH, as well as restaurant recommendations, and other things to see and do in the neighborhood. 
The guesthouse looks exactly like on the video, and the garage door murphy bed, even though it doesn't look very comfi, is actually very comfortable. I had the best sleep in a long time in this cozy place.
The TTGH is also located in a great spot; just a couple of blocks from stores, restaurants, the ship canal and the Burke Gilman trail, which I chose to explore every day with the black loaner bike (it rides really well). I loved the guesthouse and the neighborhood so much that I found it very hard to leave.
Overall, I would recommend this place to anyone visiting the Seattle area-->awesome host, great place and excellent neighborhood!"
119103,6046523,2013-07-28,3505014,Marley,"It really is a teeny tiny guesthouse! Especially for the three of us, so three is a good number for this quaint little luxurious house. Hal was a great host, he met us when we got there and told us of all the great places to go to. It was in a great location and we had a lot of fun here. Thank you Hal! "

The shower was incredible, do try if you ever stay there. Also, if you are a vinyl collector..stop by Jive Time records, you wont be let down. We hope to return again soon!"

The Guest house is close to everything and has easy access to the bus system.   I enjoyed the sleeping loft which has a great view.   The bike which I used everyday was a huge bonus.

When my travels take me back to Seattle I will be sure to stay at the Teeny Tiny Guesthouse

119103,6487180,2013-08-14,605799,Melissa,"We had the best time with Hal at the Tiny Guest House, he is super cool, knows a ton about the area and has great suggestions. The house is adorable and eclectic and the view from the ""lawn"" on the green roof is superb. Go up there for a nightcap and take in the lights of Seattle. Hal was very generous and invited us to his place for a jam session since we are all musicians. So much fun! I strongly encourage you to take the bikes out for a spin, we took them all the way down to the ferry and to Bainbridge Island and it was one of the best days of the trip. Also the shower is surprisingly luxurious, don't let the logistics scare you off.

119103,6534625,2013-08-16,7188898,Susan,"It is very tiny, but also remarkably functional and fun.  Two adults and a nine year-old managed just fine.  Fremont is a great neighborhood and Hal was a kind host.  Pack lightly, set conventions aside, and enjoy!"

119103,6762316,2013-08-24,379985,Kimberly,"Hal was a gracious and informative host.  One of our favorite parts of staying in the teeny tiny guestyhouse was being in the Fremont neighborhood, and Hal gave us lots of fabulous suggestions about where to go.  The guestyhouse is (as advertised!) teeny tiny, so be aware if you're taller than average.  Thanks Hal for being so helpful and kind!"
119103,6813811,2013-08-26,7441939,Susan,"The Teeny Tiny Guesthouse is a great place to land. It is creative, clean, and well appointed for, well, a teeny tiny place. The garage door bed is most amazing and the location is great for quick access to the Fremont neighborhood of Seattle. We will certainly stop by again the next time we visit the Emerald City. Hal is  a great host."
119103,6893938,2013-08-29,7410674,Jess And Josh,"We had a great though brief stay at Hal's TTG! it is an ingenious space in a great part of Seattle. Felt quite private and complete, and Hal was flexible enough to accommodate our early arrival and had left pastries, fruit, yogurt and milk for us, which was very kind. The only slight criticism I would have, and I hesitate to mention it except if older or extremely sensitive travelers wish to use the space, is that the awesome garage door bed is not super cushy, so if you have back problems, you may wish to choose the single lofted bed upstairs. You could prob also layer the copious blankets that are provided if you aren't wiped out by the end of the day. But we passed out just fine and were refreshed in the am :)

Fremont is an excellent home base for a laid back trip to Seattle, you need to bus or bike to get to downtown, but it's not complicated and there is plenty to see in the immediate area! recommended are sandwiches at Homegrown and small plates at The Whale Wins. We will definitely try the TTG again when we are back in town."
119103,6939548,2013-08-31,836321,Anne Marie,"The Teeny Tiny Guesthouse was our home for two days while visiting Seattle. It far exceeded all expectations - though it was actually even smaller than I envisioned! The smallness is what's so neat about it, and at the end of two days, I began wondering why we all require so much space in our everyday lives. Hal has thought of every detail and was kind enough to leave us some pastries for our first morning. The location of the guesthouse is unbeatable. I highly recommend this spot for a bit of adventure, an affordable place to stay, and a chance to ""live small."" Thanks Hal - we'll see you next time."
119103,7108522,2013-09-06,4418610,Kevin,Really cool little guest house in the heart of Fremont. I would recommend if you're looking for something different and like efficient use of space.  Hal was a great host and the shower was awesome.

He made our seattle stay so much more than I could of imagined. The tiny guest house is very small and was a bit Ike ""glamping"" but it has every  thing you need combined with all the great details Hal throws in, fresh fruit, pastries,milk,yourgrt,etc its not the Marriott, but you get a very cool experience that one could never get at the Marriott "
119103,7556947,2013-09-24,7556472,Evan,"What a fantastic, creative spot.

We arrived for a couple of nights over the weekend and had a blast. Hal has created quite a spot -- a unique, cozy and comfortable little place that offers everything for the adventurous traveler. The views of Queen Anne Hill and surrounding Fremont are in and of themselves worth the price of admission.

The TTGH comes just as advertised in the video, but Hal has also gone out of his way to create a comfortable spot, including leaving breakfast food, stocking the bathroom with accouterments, ensuring plenty of clean linens, etc. There's even a little typewriter where guests can leave travelogues, notes and more. It's a fantastic resource.

Hal was very communicative in the lead-up to the stay, coordinating plenty of details on how to find the house and making arrangements for the check in. (Check out is a simple process, too.)

I'd stay again in a heartbeat. Thanks, Hal!"
119103,7840368,2013-10-05,458751,Annie,"We were sold once we watched the video, but seeing the place in person was even more awesome then I imagined. It's a quick walk into town which had relaxed bars and coffee shops. We enjoyed our stay, and Hal was a very nice host. "
119103,7872161,2013-10-07,1488233,Dina,Hal was a fabulous host. Really went out of his way to make sure we were comfortable and had some great recommendations. The guest house is creatively designed/constructed and had everything we needed for a weekend stay. My 8 yr. old son loved it! Thanks Hal.
119103,7994847,2013-10-11,1006888,Gia,"The tiny guesthouse is hands down my favorite place I've ever stayed.  We're from the Seattle area and just needed a couple of nights for practical reasons while house-hunting, but ended up having a full-on mini-vacation.  Fremont is fun, especially when you're staying within a block or two of everything, and the bathtub-in-living room has made all other living rooms feel lacking.  The greenroof is amazing, the murphy and loft beds are both extremely comfortable, the internet is fast and trouble-free, and Hal is an extremely nice and accommodating host.  I plan on staying a couple of nights every now and then just for fun, and my long-running interest in building my own micro house some day is even stronger.  An amazingly cool place.  If it could be teleported, I'd stay in the tiny guesthouse wherever I traveled.  "
119103,8082556,2013-10-15,8263016,Shannon,"Hal has the coolest little teeny place to stay in.  I felt very comfortable in his guesthouse, and it was very private.  Hal was a wonderful host who even chose to help me find a parking spot for my car.  And he waited patiently while I attempted to parallel park in that spot.  Very patiently.  Otherwise, the guesthouse has a nice (traditional) stereo, well pressured shower, is quite warm  (and quickly warms); it also has a little microwave and fridge.  I had a friend join me one night and she crashed below and I got to sleep in the bunk above.  The experience of the guesthouse was unique and cool.  Also, the location rocks since it is so close to so many neat Seattle places.  And, just down the street you can catch the 3 major bus routes.  My only real suggestion when staying there is to carry a little flashlight if it's dark because the steps to his place might be slightly difficult to navigate in the dark.  That said, I'll suggest to Hal to get a few solar lights that can be ""implanted""/spiked in dirt, by the stairs.  I found Hal to be a wonderful host, someone whom I'd love to enjoy a cup of coffee with someday.       "
119103,8166992,2013-10-19,7107853,Danielle Norita,We had a wonderful stay at the teeny tiny guestyhouse. The guesthouse was cosy and the location was perfect. Having the bikes to use was also an added bonus and a lovely way to see the Fremont area. Hal was more than welcoming and made us feel comfortable to ask for help if needed. 
119103,8245685,2013-10-21,8762773,Elizabeth,"Hal was a *fantastic* host, and his little loft that he has built is the most charming, whimsical, and inspiring places I have EVER stayed. I loved every detail of it. It was both quaint and exciting - kind of like camping but also like living in a treehouse. I was delighted to discover our shared love of Tiki and Mid-Century style and decor, and Hal was kind enough to show me all the ways he put thought into his property. He also gave me ideas of places to visit while I was in town. I loved every minute of staying in his space, and will definitely be back one day to stay there again. Thank you, Hal!!!"
119103,8329382,2013-10-26,7075001,Eric,"A fantastic spot and I totally enjoyed my stay. Hal is a great host who is very knowledgable about the neighborhood and Seattle in general. The TTG has character, charm and was built with love. Plus he has bikes that can be borrowed! "
119103,8377790,2013-10-28,9131618,Alyshia,"We had an excellent experience staying in Hal's unique space. We were amazed at just how functional such a small living space can be. Hal thought of every last detail to make this guest house a treat to stay in, from spare toiletries to leaving a basket of local breakfast goodies.

The Fremont area had a lot to offer as well! Hal had great recommendations for local places to dine, enjoy live music and explore. If you're keen to cycle, there is a lovely bike path along the canal leading to a sandy beach. Having 2 bikes for use was a great bonus. Although they weren't fancy, they did the trick for riding locally.

Thanks for your hospitality and we hope to visit again soon!"
119103,8667316,2013-11-11,176424,Georgia,"We had such a wonderful stay with Hal. The TTGH is a child's dream and our eight year old son could have moved in without hesitation. Hal is gracious and accommodating; morning fruit, baked goodies and an assortment of yogurt, fruit and tea for our first morning. The shower is perhaps in my top ten showers ever!! Hal hasa new memory foam mattress topper for the garage door bed making it super cozy and comfortable. If your lucky you might witness Hal playing guitar and singing and it's beautiful, melodic and inspired music . Yay teeny tiny. A great weekend clubhouse!! And Fremont  is our favourite place ever- Sunday street market is a must! "
119103,8841550,2013-11-20,3840347,Amber,"A truly unique space!  Hal was an excellent host and made sure that all of our needs were met.  Location was convenient to all of the great spots in Fremont, and easy to get between neighborhoods by grabbing the bus.  Would definitely recommend staying here!"
119103,8995729,2013-12-01,9155340,Debora,"The Itty Bitty Guesty House was as much a part of our Seattle experience as Pike's Place, the Needle and the Troll under the Bridge!!!  Hal was an incredible host and the location was a lovely walkable distance from the adorable Fremont center.  Will definitely plan on staying on our next trip to Seattle but will plan a longer stay at the IBGH.  

For adults: it is worth staying not only for location and Hal's graciousness, but for the inspiring use of 64 sq feet of efficient simplistic architecture.  Truly inspiring. 

For kids: Just plain fun!  Have them watch the video.  My kids thought they were meeting a star when they met Hal! They loved the garage door bed, the typewriter, and even though they were exhausted, HAD TO take a bath in the floor tub.  

The IBGH is adorable, sweet, comfortable and, yes, tiny.  Not for claustaphobes. Perfect for a single, couple, couple with one child, single with 2 kids, or 3 adults.  "
119103,9259428,2013-12-16,10529477,Tighe,"Hal is a good host. He stayed up late on Friday to welcome me in, and gave us a quick tour and let us get settled. The location is great - right in a cool neighborhood with bars and restaurants, etc. Inside the house we comfortably slept three men. The place is indeed small but gets the job done. And what a cool idea and vision that Hal had when he built it! The pulldown bed and top bunk are really cool...and there are some nice hang out places both inside and outside. I'd definitely stay there again, and would recommend anybody who is there on a budget. Cheers Hal! "
119103,9425989,2013-12-28,1886606,Carolina,"Although teeny-tiny, Hal's guesthouse was a fantastic place to stay in Seattle. The location is great and the house is a lot of fun. Hal was a gracious host, and despite of the fact that we did not get a chance to meet in person (unfortunately), communicating with him was very easy, and getting in and out was a breeze. He even left us delicious pain au chocolat and clementines for breakfast! The guesthouse is completely independent from the main house, which is great for guests looking for privacy. The heat, wifi and hot water worked perfectly, and the house was loaded with towels, blankets and all-things travelers might need (and often forget). I strongly recommend it and will most certainly reach out next time I'm in Seattle. "
119103,9579432,2014-01-02,10920782,Shawn,"We absolutely loved Hal's tiny space and found it had everything we needed. It is cozy and comfortable. Most of all it is a creative and interesting space to experience.  

Hal was a great host and knows Seattle very well and is nice to visit with.  If you haven't been to Seattle before you will find that Fremont is an excellent neighborhood to call home base, and Hal is a helpful/friendly resource to make your stay the best it can be.

We hope to return again soon!"
119103,9706658,2014-01-06,728111,Kerstin,"What a fantastic experience staying in the Teeny Tiny Guesthouse! Hal is brilliant in his design of such an efficient tiny living space. Really, it is perfect! You do have everything you need. As well, the location could not be better - tucked quietly away - yet super easy access to explore Fremont and the surrounding city of Seattle.
Staying at Hal's is like staying with a good friend you have not seen in a long time. Hal is a gracious, hospitable, insightful & hilarious host! A pleasure for certain. "
119103,9936897,2014-01-20,1753277,Rian,"Loved the place, the host, the bikes, the city, and the location. Don't hesitate. Book this amazingly cozy place."
119103,10082947,2014-01-29,11281497,Jeni,"Hals driving directions were right on, and easy to understand, he took the time to help us find parking too. The tiny guesthouse is so well designed and the welcome basket was a sweet touch. We were glad to sit on the sunny rooftop to enjoy a wifi break and the view after our Sunday market wanders. What an awesome neighbourhood! We may have ate at Silence Heart Nest two days in a row.. The housemade chai and veggie omelettes were that good. Definitely suggest exploring Seattle from Hals place. "
119103,10423509,2014-02-18,11180795,Robert,"The Teeny Tiny Guesthouse is a wonderfully situated and, as the name clearly states, very small space.  The owner Hal has created a very pleasant quiet corner a few blocks from the heart of Fremont that is surprisingly well equipped.  It works very well for one Peron but two can fit nicely, provided they are comfortable with being very close.  I would happily go back to the guesthouse.   "
119103,10600484,2014-02-27,3394047,Sophie,"The TTG is just as adorable in real life as it is in the photo. Hal really thought of everything. Every time I found another genius part of the TTG I got even more excited. The space is small, but well thought out and cozy. I loved the location, Fremont was an awesome neighborhood I probably would not have discovered. I'd recommend this place and this host to anyone traveling to Seattle. Can't wait to come back!"
119103,10683875,2014-03-03,11587808,Megan,"Staying in this tiny house was a perfect introduction to Seattle. Located in a lovely neighborhood, the place is close to all kinds of great food and activities, and it's easy to get downtown via bus. And Hal is such a good guy! Informative and friendly, he'll make you feel welcome instantly. "
119103,10912456,2014-03-12,2879336,Mimi,"The Teeny Tiny Guesthouse was a perfect home-base for a few days in Seattle.  All the comforts of home (shower with awesome water pressure, memory foam mattress topper, beer left for you in the fridge) just smaller and more creative! To top it all off its an amazing neighborhood within walking distance to all the bars and restaurants of Fremont. "
119103,11176485,2014-03-24,11665231,Laura,"Myself and two of my close friends really enjoyed staying in Hal's teeny house! It is definitely accurate to say it is tiny but it is also has all of the basic amenities that you need while traveling. We also loved the location: on a little hill in the Fremont neighborhood, with plenty of trees and roses in bloom (and we got to see some beautiful hummingbirds one evening, from the green roof/patio). Fremont itself has many good restaurants, bike paths, a food co-op, chocolate factory, etc. 
Hal was very friendly and gave us lots of tips of where to eat and what to do in the neighborhood. He was easy to get in touch with when we were checking in and he thoughtfully had left us some snacks in the guesthouse for us to have when we arrived (which we much appreciated after our travels!). Would definitely recommend it to others who are willing to try out a small/unique travel experience!"
119103,11271176,2014-03-27,9965211,Neilson,This place has tons of character and was the perfect spot to spend a rainy Spring weekend. The location is perfect and the space is very cozy. Hal's super friendly and left tons of very clear instructions on how to access the space and use all of its space saving design features. I loved staying here.
119103,11359968,2014-03-31,12656332,Kari,"Hal was very nice. He gave us a quick tour when we arrived and showed us around. Also, gave us some suggestions for places around Fremont to check out. If you are looking for a small, cozy place to crash, this is the perfect place, I would recommend it to anyone. "
119103,11554082,2014-04-07,13246371,Christopher,"I was worried that it might be too small, but the place totally works! It's not a hotel room and it's not supposed to be. It's the best little Seattle base camp you could ask for!  Hal made sure we could find our way around and made the weekend that much easier. Altogether everything exceeded my expectations."
119103,11757328,2014-04-14,13206557,Lil,"This was a great experience and would stay at Hal's again in a minute. He is flexible and accomodating. The teeny tiny Guesthouse is unique and a testament to Hal's creativity and energy. The location was great, an interesting neighborhood with many things to do within walking distance, and 10 minute drive into the city ""proper"". Hal is a veritable font of information about local places and events."
119103,12033964,2014-04-21,14290440,Miriam,"We had a lovely stay! The ""guestyhouse"" was exactly as you see in the pictures- quaint and perfectly sized for the three of us to sleep comfortably. Hal was extremely accommodating and gave us points of interest for the area and made sure we had everything we could possibly need. The location was great for walking around the Fremont area and was close to public transportation, which fit our Seattle getaway schedule nicely. I definitely recommend staying here- we chose this over other options and are glad we did!"
119103,12220470,2014-04-26,1417593,Jeremy,"Hal is awesome - his place is awesome - you will surely enjoy staying in the tiny guesthouse. The location is great, as well - you can easily get to a number of Seattle neighborhoods & attractions from Fremont. Highly recommended."
119103,12318284,2014-04-28,2577660,Eric,"Hal was an awesome host, friendly and helpful. The place was ideal, and the location was great. Would definitely stay here again."
119103,12515782,2014-05-04,14763116,Mary Jo,"My daughter and I had a fabulous stay at the Teeny Tiny Guestyhouse.
It was intriguing and a welcome change from a B&B or hotel. It met our needs perfectly.
A word of caution is that the parking is tricky. Even though we spent considerable time looking at the many no parking signs, we still got a ticket. The No parking 
2 am- 5am were not adequately displayed near other signs that seemed to give us the ok to park. If you are bussing it would be no problem.
Other than that we couldn't have asked for a more delightful stay.
MJ & JM"
119103,12938330,2014-05-14,5295085,Willie,The Teeny Tiny Guesthouse was great for 3 people. We enjoyed sitting on the rooftop yard in the morning with a cup of tea watching the seaplanes take off. Hal gave us great recommendations of places to eat in Fremont. I will definately be staying at Hal's next time I'm in Seattle.
119103,13093158,2014-05-19,2163180,Matt,"Both the place and Hal were great. He took the time to come and chat with me for awhile - and he was a great to talk to. He also made sure I had everything I needed (including a bike to get around the area on).

And the place itself is one of the most unique AirBnB spaces I've ever been in. And I don't mean ""unique"" like a real estate agent trying to sell a broken down house but unique as in different and cool.

It is definitely tiny but comfortable, lots of fresh air when the windows are open, a great spot to sit outside and work (the wifi easily reaches the lawn chairs), and nice and quiet at night. Lastly, it's only about a 3 minute walk to the heart of Fremont which is a great neighborhood.

Will definitely be trying to stay here again the next time I'm in Chicago."
119103,13209160,2014-05-22,9838310,Stephen,"We had a really great time in Seattle thanks to Hal's tiny house! It is a feat of diy engineering and design and sits in the heart of an exciting neighborhood. A few nights in the tiny house was perfect for two people, but make sure to stay organized. It can get messy and hectic real fast in there. Plenty of great spots for all occasions nearby, making it tempting to not ever leave Fremont! I would stay with Hal again in either listing."
119103,13327920,2014-05-25,858301,Virginia,"The Teeny Tiny Guesthouse was a great place to settle for a fe days in beautiful Seattle. The neighborhood is lively, fun and packed with places to eat and things to do. Close to public transportation and easy to get to tourist stuff without being stuck in a touristy neighborhood. Hal is a ideal host -- willing to give suggestions and advice, but hands off when you want solo time. The guesthouse itself is amazing: everything you need and nothing you don't. Terrific host, location and  price = my go-to place in Seattle."
119103,13471285,2014-05-28,107310,Chip,"My visit with Hal and the tiny cottage was great. I stayed there before and I really enjoy the clever and efficient use of space. I also love being in Fremont. Hal was great to chat with(last visit he was out of town), and I can't wait to come back."
119103,13579746,2014-05-31,2772019,Matt,"Hal is a personable, interesting, and welcoming host – and the Teeny Tiny Guestyhouse is awesome. Quiet and relaxing, with a nice tiny yard, but very close to restaurants, coffeeshops, a fantastic grocery store, and public transportation, etc. etc. in the surrounding Fremont neighborhood. Excellent - thank you Hal!"
119103,13909036,2014-06-08,1391044,Frances,"Staying in Hal's guesthouse was the perfect first tiny house experience. The house is tucked away and you gotta be good at reading instructions to find it. (This was fun for me because it was more of an adventure!) The house is beautifully constructed, cozy, whimsical, and full of thoughtful essentials. There are 2 options for where to sleep - I would recommend the loft bed, so you can climb out to the roof when the sun goes down. The bathroom and shower combo is small, but extremely clean, efficient and easy to use. This tiny house was like a writer's retreat to me, because of the solitude (even with surrounding guests) and the working typewriter. 

Hal was a super friendly host and provided me with a full rundown of the many activities and eats in the neighborhood. This property is 1 minute away from the main happening street in Fremont, and the Fremont bridge, so the location was top notch. Can't wait to come back to Seattle to stay here."
119103,14518567,2014-06-21,7492824,Marie-Luise,"We had a wonderful time in the Teeny Tiny Guestyhouse, my Spice-needle :-). Hal is a great architect. He build a perfect and lovely house. Everything you need is there and on the right place, super.
And Hal is a grandiose Host. Even when he was occupied in a private sad situation he gave us lot of attention, explained technical details around the house and the bikes, offered us all the lovely places in Fermond.
Thank you very much


Hi Hal, we thank you for a wonderful time in your ttgh and for your hospitality. We will come back, when we are in town.
Best regards
Ise, Georg and Marius

119103,14676014,2014-06-24,2879471,Jennifer,"Location Location Location. So close to Freemont but private and cozy. 

This Teeny Tiny even had head room in the shower for my 6'6"" husband. "
119103,14778549,2014-06-26,14052976,Rachel,"Hal was a great host, interesting, friendly and helpful. The beautiful Guestyhouse is perfectly situated in Fremont, (just a minute or two's walk to the middle of town/the centre of the universe! ) yet quiet at night and private during the day. Seattle is just a short bus ride away and easily accessed from Fremont. The Guestyhouse is a work of genius and fits together perfectly. "
119103,15035550,2014-07-01,12403692,Robert,The tiny guesthouse is a feat of engineering genius. I really enjoyed my time there and Hal is a great and knowledgeable host. Would definitely recommend.
119103,15395136,2014-07-08,14374018,Roxanne,"Hal took great care to make sure our stay was comfortable, from having a couple healthy snacks ready for us in the room to answering any questions we had about places to see, restaurants to eat at. The accommodations were as described, quirky cool and ingenious design. You can tell much care was put into every detail. The directions were straight forward and easy to follow. Communication was great. Neighborhood was awesome, food and entertainment all within easy walking distance. We would definitely have Hal host us again, can't recommend him highly enough. "
119103,15583488,2014-07-12,16287560,Jay,"My experience here was great.  Hal was a great host, and the place was very nice and comfortable.  I will stay here again for sure."
119103,15682090,2014-07-14,6281985,Sarah,"Friendly and gracious, Hal had us feeling welcome right away.  We even got a lovely, breezy open air guitar serenade.  We love being steps away from everything in the heart of Fremont.  Charming as the last time we stayed here, we hope to come again.  The mattress topper was a definite improvement!"
119103,15961918,2014-07-19,16380367,Stephen,"The Teeny Tiny Guesthouse is a must for visiting Seattle. I stayed there with my wife and 6 year old daughter and we had a great time. The space is amazingly efficient, close to everything in Fremont, and a ton of fun. The space was just right for the three of us.

And the shower is amazing. Perfect water pressure.

If you can get there without a car...it will be even better. Parking in Fremont is pretty tight. "
119103,16548910,2014-07-29,15354713,Emily,"Hal was awesome. His guesthouse is tiny and lovely and so much more comfortable than you might imagine it could ever be. 

Hal hooked us up with the best parking space possible, was there to greet us and tell us about the neighborhood, and even left a little snack of fruit and pastries and milk. The place is small (of course), but the bed doesn't feel a bit like a garage door and the shower has excellent water pressure. The location was excellent, lots of shops and restaurants around, and convenient to a short bus ride downtown. 

I would definitely recommend Hal's place as a wonderful place to stay in Seattle! I'd give him 6 out of 5 stars, if possible."
119103,16720599,2014-08-01,12333947,Duarte,"Hal's Teeny Tiny house was an awesome experience!
Super comfortable, has everything you need, located in a calm and quite area and close to cool&hip neighborhood.
And just a little bike ride downtown!
Hal was super friendly and a great host.
Highly recommend!!"
119103,17097690,2014-08-07,1035428,Lacey,"The only bad thing I can say about Hal and his Teeny Tiny Guesthouse is that they may have set the bar too high for other AirBNBers. The house is such a fun and charming little space, with everything you need for a pleasant stay somehow squeezed in there. The loft bed is super comfy, and I loved having the view right there as soon as I woke up. Oh, and the snacks and (organic!) fruit were much appreciated. The location is great - just down the block from tons of fantastic beer and food, and close to buses that go straight into Ballard (for more beer and food :) or into downtown. Hal himself was a fantastic host, genuinely friendly and full of suggestions and advice on the area."
119103,17341851,2014-08-11,8652148,Russell,"Hal was a gracious and friendly host. He was easy to communicate with and even helped us find parking as we were arriving late in the evening. The space is as advertised, and functions perfectly as a stash house for your belongings and a place to get ready to explore the city. We could not have asked for a more perfect experience and we will definitely be back when we travel through Seattle again.

Thanks"
119103,17510237,2014-08-13,16829192,Daniel,"Hal's tiny guesthouse is incredible. We felt like we had more space than expected! The location is perfect for touring Fremont and it's easy to catch a bus to downtown as well. Hal's recommendations for restaurants, coffee shops, and activities were spot on. I only wish we could have stayed longer."
119103,17650701,2014-08-15,7921551,Lyne,"Hal greeted us upon arrival with all the information we needed to make our stay in the neighborhood a great one. The accommodations were awesome and clean, a basket of fruit and baked goodies awaited us for our breakfast.
He was helpful in orienting us to Seattle. I would book Hal's sweet spot again were I ever in Seattle. "
119103,17827286,2014-08-18,7224068,Rebecca,My husband and I really fell in love with Fremont on this trip and Hal's place was in an amazing location to everything. His teeny tiny guest house was fun and perfect for what we needed. Definitely put the extra foam pads on the bed as this makes it much more comfortable. Hal was also really friendly and welcoming. He greeted us once we arrived and let us know where things were in town and gave us a tour around the property/ guest house :)
119103,18013875,2014-08-20,18167511,Lei,"Hal was very welcoming and met us as soon as we arrived, gave us the tour and everything looked just like the video!"
119103,18108078,2014-08-22,14879228,Joyce,"Hal was very welcoming and helpful with giving an overview of the area and recommendations.  He was friendly and available while respecting our space and privacy.  The neighborhood had great access to the bike trail (thanks to Hal we had bikes to ride), good food and coffee and public transit to wherever else we wanted to go.  "
119103,18416942,2014-08-26,279001,Megan,"We are on tour of 7 cities to launch a bike tourism startup and Hal's tiny house was, by far, the most memorable making Seattle that much more amazing to visit.

We loved the attention to detail in terms of functional and aesthetic design.  Our daughter enjoyed sleeping in the loft and taking a bath in the trapdoor bathtub and we have never experienced a nicer shower, so much that I felt guilty for wasting water with the amazing pressure.

Fremont is the perfect hood for families to stay in - great accessibility to the Burke Gilman trail and for biking for transportation, in general.

To top it off, my husband and I would close out every night on the roof deck and taking in the view.

Highly recommend the whole experience!"
119103,18549393,2014-08-28,6793423,Cara,"Hal was great.  Helpful in reviewing the features of the house and has great ideas for places to eat in the area.  He was flexible in my moving target of arrival time.  Its obvious that he has put thought and work into making the space enjoyable and functional.  Its a nice space, Fremont is a fun area, and convenient to downtown, UW, Wallingford, Ballard, Pike Place, etc.  "
119103,19022064,2014-09-05,14701375,Sun Young,"I stayed at Hal's place for a week and it was the best choice that I've ever made during traveling Seattle! Cozy house, wonderful neighborhood, and very kind host are what you can experience while you stay. Me and my friends had a great time at teeny tiny guesty house. Thanks, Hal! "
119103,19222824,2014-09-08,20242574,Amanda,We had a wonderful stay and the guest house was really neat! Hal was a great host and let us know where all the good places to go were. It is in a really interesting neighbourhood and it was easy to explore the area on foot. 
119103,19361979,2014-09-11,17494210,Adrienne,"We had high expectations based on all the reviews we'd read, and were not disappointed at all! Hal is an amazing, talented, genuinely nice guy, and staying on his property made us feel like we were one of the cool kids. For a first trip to Fremont (""the center of the universe""), the Teeny Tiny Guestyhouse was a perfect extention of ingenius craftsmanship as well as the best launching point to be downtown in a flash. My husband and I stayed four nights and can't wait to go back!"
119103,19872437,2014-09-20,438209,Crystal,Hal made sure to be available when we got in for a tour of the guesthouse and a run-down on the neighborhood hot spots. We loved the coffee shop he recommended and we loved the fresh fruit and pastries he left us for snacks. 
119103,20091859,2014-09-23,7833126,Lynne,"Hal met me and welcomed me to the Teeny Tiny Guestyhouse and Fremont.  He took a minute, literally, and explained how everything worked and answered my questions.  Everything was clean and bright with fruit, pastries, toiletries and little specialties provided. The room is compact and charming.  I really enjoyed my stay.  It is very close to my relative's house so I plan to return often.  It was extremely easy to work with Hal.  When my husband joins me I plan to stay at another property Hal has which is close by and has more space.  He's the perfect host! "
119103,20916297,2014-10-07,21232365,Eric,Hal greeted me warmly when I arrived and showed me around the space. He was very accommodating and provided a fruit basket that was absolutely delightful. The guest house is an inspiring design fro anyone interested in tiny living or making cool things themselves (like garage door beds!)

The Teeny Tiny Guesthouse had everything we needed and is a great use of a small space. I really appreciated the very warm shower with great water pressure. It is also in a great location in Fremont -- we had no problem catching the bus downtown from there, walking around Fremont, or walking over to Wallingford. "
119103,22120908,2014-10-30,4296727,Danielle,"Located in the wonderful Fremont neighborhood, the Teeny Tiny Guesthouse is one of our favorite destinations. We have stayed there twice now, and have loved each experience. Hal is a wonderful and gracious host who really breaks out the hospitality, making our stay very comfortable. Thanks again for a wonderful trip to the PNW!"
119103,22347257,2014-11-03,165390,Seth,"This was a great place to stay.  So cozy, and very well-thought out.  Every detail was tended to in such clever ways.  It's what I'd imagine traveling on a boat might be like, no wasted space, but cozy and comfortable.  

Even though there are detailed directions, it will be easier to find if you meet Hal and he shows you to the door."
119103,24055924,2014-12-18,23870730,Wei,Hal is very open-minded and welcome his guests very much! He provided much useful information to us. Tiny house is a little tiny for 3 people but it's fully equipped and cool!
119103,24216688,2014-12-22,1599037,Charles,"Hal is such an amazing host; and his Tiny House is a wonder to experience! It is, in my opinion, a perfect meld of vintage ambience and intuitive function. 

Everything you need within any living space is available and within a couple arm lengths; or requires a step or two access...the convertible, garage door type bed is so dope!!

He promptly greeted me after a last minute booking; gave me a tour of the place then took me up to his balcony (in his adjacent but completely separate house) and gave me a great overview of Fremont (food, bars, fun stuff, etc.). Being new to Seattle, I thought that was very kind of him! He even apologized for not having snacks available (because I booked rather late in the day) for me when I arrived. Then offered me alternatives (e.g. milk for coffee) from his own fridge!

Oh yeah, there is a bathtub in the living room!  And it is so fun and easy to use it!"
119103,24996587,2015-01-04,9670034,Jonathan,"Hal's Teeny Tiny Guesthouse is worth it just to see a fantastic example of small living done right. During my stay I was continually fascinated with really just how efficiently every square foot was utilized (and not just the floor either!). Up, down, sideways everything fit and was operable. Lots of small places you end up having to move something out of the way to use something. For example - only being able to use the microwave once you closed a cabinet, etc.

Besides, Hal is a local and gave me some great pointers to some cool places in Fremont.

Stay here, you won't regret it."
119103,25564280,2015-01-19,25658948,Alicia,"This teeny space is how it looks online and was perfect for my stay in Freemont. Hal did a fantastic job making this little place feel cozy & efficient. Having snacks and tea was an unexpected delight. Though we did not have the opportunity to meet in person, Hal's communication was caring & efficient. I greatly appreciate his hospitality. I'm only sorry my time didn't allow for use of the floor-tub, next time! I will be sharing and recommending this Teeny Tiny Guesthouse to friends! "
119103,26025920,2015-02-01,20870405,Naomi,"My husband and I both really enjoyed staying in the tiny house! Hal was warm and welcoming host, we can't wait to stay again!"
119103,26311539,2015-02-09,13456754,Zuzana & Nikki,"Fantastic experience in a lovely, piece of art guesthouse. Unusual and beautiful, with very kind hosts Hal. The position is great for the city, but in a lovely, authentic area where you feel part of the community. 
Hope to come back this summer. Thank you Hal ;) "
119103,27772296,2015-03-11,446881,Rebecca And Phil,"What a great little spot in one of Seattles funnest neighbourhoods. Close to transit, shops and cafes. Easy to get downtown. The tiny cabin was a perfect cozy spot to come back to after a day of exploring. My son loved the bathtub in the floor and the loft. Hal was quick and easy to correspond with. I would highly recommend a visit!"
119103,28137359,2015-03-18,11272364,Sunday,"Hal's place was in a great location. It's quite small and a bit hard to find-- but definitely a fun ""cabin"" type experience in the middle of Seattle. "
119103,29358521,2015-04-06,30311152,Radu,"Great little place, Hal was very nice and the place is exactly as described - tiny, quaint, and very unique!  Extremely functional and well done in teeny tiny footprint!

Having a bike was fantastic, neigborhood is great, and make sure to budget some time to hang out on the grass rooftop patio!

Highly recommended if you're looking for a different experience! "
119103,29681219,2015-04-11,6807355,Jessica,"Staying in Hal's tiny house was the best decision we made on our trip. The rooftop lawn was perfect for enjoying the spring days (+ a great view!) and the small space is used so well. 

On top of that, as everyone has already said, Hal was a great host (now friend) who took us to his yoga class and gave detailed info about the must-try spots in Fremont. The Tiny Guest House is within walking distance to tons of eateries, vintage shops, bars; we even walked downtown one day along Lake Union (about 5 miles or so). Thanks, Hal, for a wonderful stay and we can't wait to come back! "
119103,30796250,2015-04-27,5041995,Ashlee,"This was the most fun little creative space we have ever seen! Every little part is thoughtful, vintage and just plain fun. We stayed (two good friends) and both agreed that this is a perfect little alternative spot for two people (who don't share a bed!). Blocks from attractions, ultra cool neighborhood. Wish we could have stayed longer!!"
119103,31031975,2015-05-01,7955261,Nicola,"Very welcome, great detail lovely place. even got some breakfast pastries on arrival and Hal called us a taxi on our departure. Will be staying here next time."
119103,31488628,2015-05-05,14661522,Dayna,"This was the absolute perfect little spot for my husband and me to stay while we were in Seattle. Not only is the location perfect, but the ambiance of the teeny space is very homey and welcoming. It was a BEAUTIFUL weekend and even though we were going more than coming, Hal was a joy to work with and very accommodating to our hectic schedule. Highly recommend and look forward to returning! "
119103,31944028,2015-05-12,29196225,Owen P.,"Hal was the ideal host! 

His description of the place was spot on and exactly what we were looking for, while having a better than anticipated experience.
We really enjoyed the care basket of local goodies, featuring locally made chocolates, organic fruits, and baked goods. I'm talking Really Good stuff!

Based on Hal's video, introduction, and house rules we knew that we would enjoy our visit. Which we were correct.

His directions were perfect. We actually used public transportation for the entire 4 night stay and feel that we saved a pile of money (didn't pay for fuel, parking, or fines) and got to really experience this clean and friendly city.

His neighborhood of Fremont has enough activity to occupy oneself for an entire week. Everything is within walking distance.

This space sleeps 3, and I would advocate trying it, if you really get along with your travel buddies. My wife and I did really well within this 68 sqft space, especially considering that we probably didn't utilize the space as best as we could. You'd be amazed at how well this space works.

Cannot emphasize enough that we had a great experience. Hal gets top marks for his teeny tiny guest house."
119103,32253549,2015-05-16,15290355,Maud,Hal was very nice. He gave us good tips and really wants people to have a good time in his Guesthouse. The place is fun. Very tight but interesting experience ! And everything works well. Cold weater is not the best for that kind of stay. 
119103,32525146,2015-05-19,30735001,Jessica,"Hal was a great host - there when we needed things, but not overbearing. The tiny house was a great experience as well. Great location, and really fun place to stay. Hal was very knowledgable about the area and very helpful in general. The grassy roof deck was the best part!"
119103,32758511,2015-05-21,28895424,Katie,"We had an amazing time here! Don't be fooled by the ""tiny"" label- this house has plenty of room, and it fit 3 of us quite comfortably. The water pressure in the shower was also great. Hal was also really helpful and informative, giving us great recommendations for places to go in Fremont, and detailed biking instructions. Truly a unique experience that I'm not sure could be replicated anywhere else! "
119103,33304906,2015-05-26,33144940,Katherine,Hal greeted us at the house and gave us a really great overview of the neighborhood spots. The tiny guestyhouse is exactly as advertised and completely adorable! The maps and loner bikes were really helpful. Fremont is a fantastic neighborhood. Easy walk or bike to lots of restaurants and shops and just a few blocks from the bus to get downtown.
119103,33610171,2015-05-30,21745250,Matt,"Hal's the greatest host in the history of Airbnb, making me feel welcome, meeting me at 10:30 PM to find the place in the dark, giving me great local info, providing organic fruits and more.  The Teeny Tiny Guesthouse is by far the most unique place I've ever stayed, so full of artistry and intention.  

This was my first time staying in Fremont and found it super convenient to get to/from both downtown and Ballard for work meetings, while giving me a fun part of town as a home base.

I'll be sure to stay again the next time I'm in Seattle and recommend that you do, too."
119103,33915940,2015-06-02,31113293,Tim,"The Teeny Tiny Guestyhouse was a piece of engineering artwork for making the most of a small space, including the bed on a ""garage door"" motorized track. The loft was fun, too. Hal was a great host and did his best to make us welcome. He came highly recommended and didn't disappoint! We had a fun time."
119103,34189665,2015-06-06,23348090,Angie,"Hal was a perfect host, who even bought us breakfast and fruits, and we really enjoyed staying with him. The teeny tiny guesthouse IS pretty tiny but still big enough for three adults. :-) It's very close to good restaurants and the bus stop. 
Thank you so much for having us Hal!"
119103,34646960,2015-06-10,32309850,Cyndi & Reed,Hal made us feel very welcome! His use of space was very creative & he's got a great sense of vintage style. Hal left a basket of snacks that was full of fresh baked goods and fruit. It was really appreciated! Hal is friendly and seemed really happy to share info re the area and help us w/ anything we needed.
119103,34889760,2015-06-13,12339745,Shervin,"We had a great stay at the Tiny Guesthouse. It's a real nice spot,  right in the heart of Fremont. The cabin is pretty spacious,  at least for a couple used to sharing quarters. Great shower and nice lil radio for your morning NPR. Hal surprised us with some pastries and Theo's chocolate, which was very cool of him. I recommend grabbing your morning coffees at Fremont Coffee Roasters on 36th. Thanks for the stay!"
119103,35480416,2015-06-19,33731907,Carolyne,"I just recently stayed at the Teeny Tiny Guesthouse and enjoyed it thoroughly.  The way Hal put it together is ingenious to say the very least.  He met me when I arrived and gave me the lowdown on the guest house and the surrounding area.  He is very friendly, upbeat and welcoming.  Plus he lives on the property so if you need anything he's available.  The neighborhood is cool with lots of shops and restaurants and there are 3 bus lines within a few block walk making it incredibly convenient to downtown Seattle.

I highly recommend the this little place.  It will be worth your while (and your pocketbook) for sure!!"
119103,35790255,2015-06-22,30945080,Sarah,"Hal is a perfect host.  He makes you feel like you are part of the neighborhood and that you have always known him.  Warm, gracious, and funny.  He is a great communicator and pretty relaxed.  He oriented us to the neighborhood well, with highlights to a variety of great places from a vintage arcade to great coffee.  His Teeny, Tiny Guesthouse is just that- teeny and tiny, but brilliantly engineered to make the most of the space with a cool roll up garage door bed and stow-away table.  The shower is great- hot and with wonderful water pressure!  The surprise pastries and fruit were a welcome treat and useful as a midnight snack.    He has some loaner bikes that help you get around.  The location is excellent.  You are literally a block from downtown Freemont, yet you feel very safe tucked into the neighborhood.  If you are expecting 500 count sheets, a feather mattress pad, and matching turkish white towels this might not be your place.  However, if you want to marvel at one man's ingenuity and feel the true vibe of funky Freemont, this is your spot.  Hal is the kind of host that would make anyone and everyone feel welcome.  Clean, quiet, well-located and well-priced, we now have a new place to stay when we come to Seattle."
119103,36418383,2015-06-28,370202,Maia,"This place great! It's cool funky in a great neighborhood and Hal is as good a host as anyone could hope for. Will definitely be returning again. For folks interested in tiny house living, this is a must see."
119103,36886888,2015-07-02,34781867,Trevor,I had a great time at the guestyhouse. Hal is friendly and full of tips for exploring Seattle. The guestyhouse is tucked away so you really do feel removed from the hustle and bustle of the neighborhood. Recommended!
119103,37461623,2015-07-07,5956012,Nikki,"Hal was an amazing host from start to finish! His tiny guesthouse is the perfect starting point to explore Seattle and the fun Fremont district. The guesthouse has everything that a couple would need in order to have a ""home away from home"" atmosphere while on vacation. Hal included many thoughtful touches, such as complimentary chocolates from the chocolate factory down the street, and fresh fruit and croissants for the morning. His knowledge of the city (and especially the Fremont neighborhood) is astounding, and he was quick to provide  fun ideas for us on our vacation -- He even helped us find the perfect spot to view July 4th fireworks, away from the crowds! Having a secluded guesthouse with its own yard, plus a friendly & thoughtful host, made this trip even more memorable than we could've imagined. We can't wait to visit again. Thanks, Hal! :)"
119103,37840706,2015-07-11,30045568,Stephanie,"Hal made my fiance and I feel right at home from the beginning.  He was very friendly, fun and showed us around town!  He is an excellent host and I would recommend anyone to stay here.  Staying at the Guesthouse was a very unique experience and is exactly what the listing says.  It's a great time to try the ""mini house"" living.  The neighborhood is great!  The Guesthouse is in walking distance to many different restaurants, pubs, and breweries!  
Thank you Hal!  "
119103,38500684,2015-07-16,20172851,Ben,"Absolutely fantastic stay in the teeny tiny guesthouse.  Such a unique and brilliant little place. Hal was super nice too, offering us great tips on places to go and eat and see in Fremont.  Highly recommended!"
119103,39231607,2015-07-21,21026700,Asha,"Hal was a fantastic host! I was welcomed upon arrival and felt right at home in the tiny, cleverly designed clubhouse. It was a great place to stay for a weekend and a wonderful neighborhood to explore and adventure from. I look forward to my next stay at this sweet little oasis. "
119103,39617701,2015-07-25,7485374,Zoie,Hal could not have been more hospitable. He was friendly and accommodating even when we broke the rules. His place was the coolest thing I've ever seen- everything worked awesome and the shower had the best water pressure ive ever seen. Would def recommend staying with him. Thanks Hal!
119103,40093678,2015-07-28,10535152,Megan,"My sister and I LOVED our stay at the teeny tiny guesthouse. Hal is very welcoming and knowledgeable about the area- he had a lot of great suggestions for things to do. The guesthouse is great! For a weekend with 2 people the space worked perfectly fine. One of the best features is the shower. I had low expectations just due to the nature of the home, but this shower is amazing. The water pressure is amazing, it gets really hot- I've been traveling for 4 weeks and this was the best shower. I would definitely stay here again!"
119103,40613882,2015-08-01,36576425,Tara,"Hal is an amazing host and his tiny house of awesome fun was better than any hotel stay. Can remember.  He was there to greet us, introduce us to all the great things to do in the neighborhood and he was super-fast answering all our questions.  I only wish we had such a great neighbor and such a cool little house!  Thanks so much for the lovely stay!"
119103,41086058,2015-08-04,35087894,Judith,"The Teeny Guesthouse is BIG on comfort and amenities! Hal is super thorough and available for questions, suggestions and great tips on the area. He even stocks some treats and fruit. Having bikes to ride is a wonderful bonus and there is a beautiful bike trail along the water. And a block away is really cool Fremont and multiple buses to downtown Seattle. This was my first Airbnb experience and I really hope to return."
119103,42695086,2015-08-15,36578292,Michael,Had an amazing time in Seattle and staying with Hal! He was a great host and helped us every way he could to make sure we knew where to go and what to see. He was super nice and the tiny house was really fun to stay in. I would love to stay with him again next time I am in Seattle! :)
119103,43776926,2015-08-22,32605127,Lori,"Hal greeted us at the corner and escorted us to the Guesthouse. This was very helpful and courteous. He gave us a tour and offered suggestions for dining and sightseeing. I was pleasantly surprised to find Fremont to be so interesting. We had planned on spending most of our time in Seattle and did not anticipate needing extra time to see all of Fremont and the surrounding neighborhoods. We will have to plan another trip to experience all the cool stuff to do near the Guesthouse. 

The Teeny Tiny Guesthouse is tiny! I was not prepared for how small  it is. At first I was worried that it was too small, but as we spent more time there it started to feel like home. We love all the little amenities! It is the perfect getaway and only a short bus ride to the city. 

Hal was a wonderful host. He provided information and directions and made us feel welcome. He helped make our family vacation enjoyable and affordable. I would recommend staying at Hal's lodgings to anyone. "
119103,44528605,2015-08-27,29752156,Constance,"The Guestyhouse was great! Very cozy - and definitely small - hideaway off the streets, tucked in a little cluster of funky buildings. My stay was fun - a fantastic antidote to a boring hotel or a relative's guest room LOL.  Hal thought of everything and made me feel so welcome with his big smile. But I had lots of privacy, too. A big thumbs-up!"
119103,44918664,2015-08-30,37283535,Laura,"Hal was a wonderful host! He was always available yet gave you plenty of privacy. His knowledge and key sites to hit while visiting Seattle were spot on. We thoroughly enjoyed our trip, the tiny house, his loaner bikes, the fresh fruit and pastries awaiting our arrival and his hospitality! "
119103,45391208,2015-09-02,39247588,Kris,"Great location in the center... of the Center of the Universe. Walking distance to everything in the neighborhood including breweries, restaurants, coffee, water, parks, etc. 

Hal was very helpful, friendly and had lots of great suggestions. 

Staying in the Clubhouse is like spending the night in a fort you wish you had as a kid. Great views from the roof/deck too. Good amount of room with the bed up. Just make sure if you're staying with something you are comfortable with them, since it's definitely cozy. "
119103,45749674,2015-09-05,20332653,Danny,The tiny house was awesome. Great place to stay and unwind. Hal was very nice and helpful. Would definitely stay again.
119103,46591098,2015-09-12,17424973,Dan,"I had such a wonderful experience with Hal at his Tiny Guesthouse! It was small but more than plenty of room and plenty of function! Everything you would need, right in the center of the universe, Fremont! 2 blocks from the center of the neighborhood and ND so much to do. Hal had everything ready for us when we got there. I cannot recommend this enough, will stay again if I'm in town!"
119103,47046538,2015-09-15,38293957,Jason,"My wife and I had a great experience in the Teeny Tiny Guesthouse. We were sold on the novelty of a tiny house, and although it was, indeed, tiny, Hal had shown thought in every detail of the place, maximizing almost every square inch of space. He was very amenable to our morning arrival time and gave us a thorough rundown of the tiny house and the neighborhood, including suggested bike tours (with bikes available to use). There was also a welcome basket of delicious fruit and scones from the nearby market. The tiny house is in the heart of an awesome, walkable neighborhood with convenient transit to downtown and within walking distance to many nearby restaurants, including the deservedly famous Paseo Carribean sandwich shop. We would definitely stay there again, if Hal would have us!"
119103,47392972,2015-09-18,1526430,Chris,"Hal was great.  Met me late at night, gave me great rundown of neighborhood, which is awesome.  Very friendly and accommodating.  Left me all kinds of food treats."
119103,47895453,2015-09-21,22064945,Erin,"Hal met up with us at check-in, he was very nice and told us some good places to check out. There was a basket of fruits and snacks waiting for us. The tiny house was tiny and cozy. The neighborhood was my favorite part. We were walking distance to good food, bars, landmarks and a running/bike path. This was my first trip to the Seattle area and I had a great time. Thanks Hal for being a great host! "
119103,48425530,2015-09-26,42623234,Kayla,"Our stay in Hal's Tiny Guesthouse was above and beyond anything we expected. Not only did we get a lovely place to stay, we got a very helpful and informative host. We felt like our time in Seattle was overall better. He informed us on things that we didn't know existed, he helped us make the most out of our week. Hal was also very helpful with little things like directions, best routes, current events, fixing our souvenir, and finding our lost items. We are so glad we chose Hal's tiny guesthouse and would recommend it 100 times over. "
119103,49430666,2015-10-04,7902657,Sophie,The tiny house was amazing and Hal was the perfect host! I was meet on arrival by Hal who gave me the full tour and left me a basket full of fresh fruit and pastries as a welcome gift. Everything I could possibly have needed was in the house and it was a short walk to the shops and cafes of Fremont out bus trip downtown. For me the house was also a perfect opportunity to get a feel for living in a tiny space and gave me some really great ideas for my own thing home!
119103,51579865,2015-10-21,46402293,Teri,"Hal was very friendly and was willing to meet us at 9 p.m. to give us the tour and tips for getting around town. I felt very safe in the area we were in. He was generous in leaving us a gift basket with fruit, chocolate and yummy baked goods! The place is indeed tiny but we were looking to experience a ""tiny"" home. I was impressed with how well it was built. The shower is amazing with a strong flow and ample hot water. We were thrilled with the little typewriter that was sitting on the tiny desk and we had fun using it. The beds were comfortable and we didn't even have to turn on the heat. All in all, we were happy that we chose this over the Hotel Hotel Hostel down the street (the hostel was a little more expensive and, besides, we had more privacy here.) We would definitely stay here again!"
119103,52719134,2015-11-01,38915351,Cornelia,"Hal is a wonderful host!  He left us fruit and chocolate, even something for breakfast for the first morning.  He really enjoys having people around.  The Tiny House was an experience not to be missed!  We loved every minute."
119103,53507408,2015-11-09,46563054,Matthew,"Wow! Where to start? The Teeny Tiny Guestyhouse is such a unique and amazing space! We could not have enjoyed our time there any more. Hal was the most spectacular host, making us feel completely at home. He gave us some great advise from places to eat and hangout to the best way to get around town.  We felt really at ease knowing we could get in touch with him whenever we needed.  Definitely looking forward to staying here again! "
119103,54293477,2015-11-17,15911891,Michael,"Hal is an amazing host. He was extremely accommodating to our late check in time, meeting us in person to give us a quick run through of the Tiny House and Fremont neighborhood. My girlfriend and I had an perfect vacation in Seattle. This place is in a great central location; walking distance to many amenities and a short cab ($9-12) to every neighborhood (downtown, ballard, and capitol hill). It is definitely a Tiny House, watch his informative video and prepare yourself for a memorable experience. I would recommend this place to any couple especially those who love camping and adventure. Hal has a plethora of bikes to borrow to help with your exploration. He also stocked the mini kitchen with many delicious local snacks. We loved our trip, We loved the tiny house,  and we love Seattle. Thank you Hal!"
119103,55373444,2015-12-01,44964863,Perry,"Hal was a wonderful host and took time to tell us all about the charming neighborhood! The listing information was accurate and we thoroughly enjoyed our stay there.  Hal even had bikes ready for us to ride.  There is much to see walking and biking in the immediate area and we loved the excellently appointed accommodations.  It was a pleasure to experience Hal's ingeniously designed structure and would love to stay there again on our next visit to Seattle.

Perry and Lisa"
119103,57012872,2015-12-21,2500820,Stacey,"Hal's tiny home was AWESOME. Clearly, this is an airbnb rental for a niche audience, but if you are looking to stay in Seattle in a really unique setting, I highly recommend staying in this house! Hal was out of town while we were there, but his house sitter (Sunny) was super responsive. I'd definitely recommend watching the video to see all of the ins and outs of the house beforehand / when you arrive. This was perfect for what we were looking for - a weekend in a tiny home :)"
9137899,54332386,2015-11-18,47508552,Gilbert,The killer view of downtown and the Space Needle is what sold me to Will's place. You can feel the pulse of the city. The apt was in convenient location to most Seattle hot spots. I walked 90% of the time I was there. It so happen to reveled & party with the Seahawks fans at a local sports bar the weekend I was there. I spent most of my time out and Will's place was nice place to chill and recharge.
9137899,55446841,2015-12-01,12084409,Dominique,Will's place is awesome! Its cozy with a great view and in the perfect location. About 10-15 minutes walking distance from downtown and right next to Capitol Hill. Great night life and food around the corner as well. Will was really nice and always got back to me promptly! Overall great place to stay and I would definitely stay here again!

6971260,38039254,2015-07-12,7120881,India,"Cassie was a great host, and the apartment was perfect for my quick trip! The apartment was very nice and tidy and had an incredible view of the city. Her sweet house cat was the best, so lovable and cuddly. Nothing but good things to write about my stay!"
6971260,38548892,2015-07-16,20828104,Lynn,"Cass's apartment is in an excellent location, about 2 blocks from the heart of Lower Queen Anne, so we were easy walking distance to lots of great restaurants, coffee shops, grocery stores, ect., yet on a street that felt quiet and residential.  The apartment was basic, clean, tidy and cute and has a terrific view of the Puget Sound.  Class left a clear note with instructions regarding wifi, TV, etc.

This is Cass's primary residence and it is her cat's only residence.  So Cass left during our stay, but her cat stayed.  The cat is very sweet but I am not used to living with cats so some of the cat behaviors were a surprise to me. 

It is a terrific spot and the photos don't do it justice."
6971260,38642246,2015-07-17,37254309,Michelle,"Cass was a great host. Quick to respond to any messages. Cute studio apartment in a great location, walking distance to plenty of restaurants and grocery store. House cat is friendly and loves attention. The only down side, at the time I stayed at the apt, the key was not located on property and was bit of a walk, so I ended up taking Uber since I had luggage with me. Otherwise, a great place to stay:-)"
6971260,39071110,2015-07-20,8314212,Colin,The studio apt was as listed .Very quaint and comfortable in an awesome district of downtown (website hidden) easy walk to the Key arena with lots of pubs and great eating spots within walking distance .Cass was very helpfull and quick to respond with help when i got lost :)  Overall i enjoyed my visit ...Colin
6971260,39547032,2015-07-24,4266210,David,"Cass was great. Very responsive. Listing was as described. Neighborhood wasn't particularly happening but safe and clean. Safeway nearby for groceries and bars, restaurants, nearby. Apartment itself was clean, comfortable, and had an unexpectedly nice view. All the amenities I needed. Her cat is adorable and very affectionate. Actually kind of a dog-like. My favorite kind of cat but if you don't like animals or cats in particular, look out. In whole, definitely would stay here again if I visited the Queen Anne neighborhood again."
6971260,39806983,2015-07-26,29522029,Teresa,"Loved my stay. The place was clean, spacious, and with a great view of the water. Her directions for navigating the building were very helpful, and she was super accommodating. Plus, her kitty is the sweetest! Best snuggler ever. Would definitely stay here again. Thanks!"
6971260,40829264,2015-08-02,1726754,Anthony,I really enjoyed staying here.  The studio was very charming and was all that I needed since I knew I'd be mostly out and about in the area.  Cass was very kind and checked in on my frequently to make sure that things were going well.  
6971260,42160684,2015-08-11,6735237,Sherry,Cass's place was a perfect pit stop for the rest of my stay.  Chester the cat is awesome (if you happen to be a cat person like me).  Cass is easy to work with & is very accommodating.
6971260,43709987,2015-08-21,24207759,Mehdi,Cass was very nice and communicative. She was a great host and accommodating for my late check-in. Her studio is very clean and in a great location in Seattle.
6971260,44809711,2015-08-29,1782821,Kris,"Cass met us at the agreed time and was very responsive via the site's messaging app. We didn't have any issues. The neighborhood was exactly what we were looking for (walking distance to Pike Place Market, Space Needle, EMP, etc) and had several great options for dinner and coffee. We were able to spend our entire stay without driving our car. Thanks for a fun weekend Cass!"
6971260,45099483,2015-08-31,38147267,Adam,"Cass was great. Had everything well put together. The apartment was clean and very comfortable. She made me feel very welcome. If you need good conversation, Chesti the cat will provide (he was also pretty playful with me... apparently thought my foot was some kind of monster). And the view is pretty good.  Also, the neighborhood's great (just a few blocks from Seattle Center)."
6971260,48929659,2015-09-29,43873320,Vanessa,"Cass was awesome ! The apartment was walking distance from all the great tourist attractions. There are plenty of food and bar options in the area too which was a plus. The apartment was clean and had everything we needed for our stay, not to mention a great view. Her cat Chesti is adorable and loves to cuddle. Be prepared for him to cuddle with you at night. We would definitely stay here again if we came back to Queen Anne ! "
3258386,14715127,2014-06-24,16740337,Lisa,"David was a great host! He made sure that we were well-informed about his home and prepared it nicely for our arrival. If you are looking for a place to stay in Seattle and enjoy local color, Fremont is a great place to be!"
3258386,16136507,2014-07-22,15604615,Ben,"David's place was very clean and comfortable and he is a very welcoming host. The neighborhood felt very safe, and it was only a 2-3 minute walk to the restaurants and bars, and a bit further to the main Fremont area."
3258386,16582925,2014-07-29,6977262,Adam,"David has a small and spare but family friendly apartment, the cost was a bit higher than we'd have liked given the lack of furnishings but we understand Seattle is pretty high demand, especially for people with kids coming on a weekend. The location was very central, a huge plus, and David was consistently responsive to any questions or concerns we had throughout or stay. Thank you David for opening your doors to our little girls!"
3258386,17663392,2014-08-15,17133614,Christy,"David made us feel at home- the place was clean and had a few knick knacks out, but there was plenty of space for our belongings. Freemont is so much nicer than I'd realized- just enough to do without there being too much hustle."
3258386,17888564,2014-08-18,19509089,Sara,"My boyfriend and I had an fantastic time staying in David's home.  The space is simple and efficient... and definitely a peaceful environment.  This was my first visit to Seattle and I found the Fremont area super fun, and still, I enjoyed being up the road a ways from all the night time commotion.  It was also great to have little treats available to us at the house, such as coconut oil and tea as well as some fresh pluots... not to mention the huge blackberry bush in the back yard!  Awesome!!  

A great stay and I'd recommend the experience!    "
3258386,18818059,2014-09-01,19042830,Eryne,"David made us feel welcome with fresh towels folded on the bed, and an offering to use the produce in his refrigerator, tea, granola and some cooking supplies. The listing was accurate: his place was simple and relaxed, with cushions around the coffee table, no real clutter, and everything we needed for our home base during the Bumbershoot weekend. The location was very close to Fremont shops: some nice cafes, and a fun Sunday market.
Thank you, David."
3258386,19166784,2014-09-07,20656642,John,"Excellent price, clean place to stay!"
3258386,20211482,2014-09-25,341006,Annaleah,"We really enjoyed our stay at David's place! David was very communicative and the listing was very accurate. The place is minimal and comfortable and we had everything we needed during our stay. We appreciated the nicely folded towels, clean bathroom and water filter! The location is also fantastic. I would definitely recommend this place for those looking for a simple, affordable and comfortable stay in Seattle. "

3258386,28766533,2015-03-29,7831835,Chaz,"Very clean and comfortable space. Very flexible and easy check in/out.  Fun neighborhood with lots of cool things to check out and not far from downtown Seattle, Ballard, U-District or anywhere else you'd want to go. Would recommend!"
3258386,34362423,2015-06-07,8975174,David,We had a great time staying at David's house.  Access was easy and the location was excellent just down the street from the Sunday market and area bars and restaurants.   Pretty neighborhood.  The house was great and David provided us with new experiences with organic and natural soaps and shampoos for showering! 
3258386,35702265,2015-06-21,9869043,Macarena,"My husband and I stayed at David's house for almost a week and had a very peaceful and comfortable stay. The location was great to get to know Fremont, bars and restaurants around the area, visit Gas Works Park and move around the city. Quiet neighborhood but great access to move around. Easy check in, David answered quickly to our messages and made sure to help us with any questions."
3258386,37228308,2015-07-05,24021844,Darcy,"We had a very comfortable and peaceful stay at David's place. Fremont is a trendy, leafy suburb, and it is easy to get Downtown on the bus. The place was as described, with no problems at all. David was helpful and kind. Highly recommended for a more relaxed and authentic Seattle experience!"
3258386,41814312,2015-08-09,4452678,Jonathan,"David's place was great. It's in an awesome location with easy access to lots of great stuff. The bed is super comfortable and the neighborhood is really quiet, so we got better sleep than we'd had in months! David himself was great, and even allowed us a late check out to accommodate our later flight. Great experience all around. "
3258386,45339236,2015-09-01,42216278,Tristan,We had a great time visiting Seattle and really enjoyed staying at David's place in the Fremont area! Very easy to get around the city and within walking distance from downtown Fremont. We would definitely recommend David's place to anyone visiting the area! He was very detailed and kept us well informed. 
9352778,56963604,2015-12-20,37820914,Shanna,"We had a lovely stay at Val's house. The townhome is beautiful, incredibly clean, and even has workout equipment, which was awesome to have. The kitchen is fully stocked so we were able to cook a full dinner easily. Beds are super comfy, too. Everything looked new and we felt right at home. The Pillow team was also great, the interaction with them and Val was very friendly and warm. We will stay here again for sure when in Seattle. Thank you very much for the hospitality, definitely a terrific Airbnb experience! "
9352778,57323837,2015-12-24,4132992,Armando,I thoroughly enjoyed staying here. The townhouse is beautiful and well equipped for a getaway. It is a wonderful space that is completely furnished with a well equipped kitchen. I loved the convenience of being able to jump to downtown or over to Ballard from this location. Val and the Pillow team were friendly and quick to respond. The entire visit from pre check-in to following up at the end was great. Should I find myself needing a quiet space for a getaway retreat to Seattle I will absolutely stay here again.
830948,4665466,2013-05-19,6079208,Lara,"I traveled cross-country from Florida to Seattle to begin my first two weeks working in-house at a job I had just started and was super nervous.  Not only have I never traveled such a far distance by myself, I had also never used Airbnb and was a little unsettled by the idea of staying in a stranger's home.  I was happily surprised to find out that Pam is a very generous host offering comfortable and clean accommodations.  Her condo has beautiful views (check out the rooftop!), a HUGE deck that overlooked Lake Union & downtown Seattle, and is conveniently located by quite a few bus stops. During my stay, Pam graciously invited me to join her at the grocery store & also took me sightseeing to check out a few of Seattle's must-see landmarks.   She also took me on my first hiking experience, that was definitely one of the highlights from my entire trip.  Oh, and I MUST mention how amazing a cook Pam is.  She offered me a sampling of a few meals she whipped up multiple times throughout my stay and even prepared me a delicious chicken salad wrap for lunch one day.  Needless to say, Pam made my visit to Seattle a wonderful experience, never felt more welcomed.  "
830948,20420393,2014-09-29,19157125,Dan,"Pam was a kind, welcoming host. She offered to pick me up from the light rail station when I arrived, saving me a cab ride, and she helped me out with a ride to Trader Joe's more than a few times.

The place itself is great. It has lovely views of downtown and Lake Union, and I found the area to be quiet. I stayed here while relocating to Seattle and searching for an apartment, and I had no trouble getting to any of the spots I was looking at. The E-line rapid ride is a minute away, and Downtown, South Lake Union, and Queen Anne are all walking distance. This is a perfect location for travelling around and getting to know Seattle."
830948,47078443,2015-09-15,41852334,Wanchen,It was a lovely stay into Pam's sweet apartment. We didn't get a lot of talks since I only stayed for a weekend and I was barely home. Pam was a sweet host and she introduced me the kitchen so I can help myself if she's not around. The room itself is small but with a large closet. You can definitely see the lake from your window. The only imperfect thing might be the whistle from the port in the morning if you are sensitive to the noise. It didn't bother me anyway.
4555997,28729250,2015-03-29,3679511,Mike,Great host and great place! Flexible host and really great communicator. The place is close to everything you need!
4555997,30510503,2015-04-23,1391175,Tracy,"We stayed here for three weeks and loved staying in this space! It was super clean, with great light and it had everything we needed. It also has a washer & dryer and a full kitchen. 

We had a free parking spot for our car.  Which came in handy for us to get around town easily. But if you don't have a car, you are within a 10-15 minute walk to the bus to go downtown or to Ballard. It is also walking distance to pizza, Red-Mill burgers, and a big grocery store. 

Becky was always helpful and easy to get in touch with, she even left had a welcome/information sheet with some wine and flowers! 

Thank you for everything, we really didn't want to leave.

4555997,31735439,2015-05-09,6709326,Emma,"This studio was perfect in so many ways! It's bright, spacious and in a gorgeous neighborhood. Becky was super sweet, offered suggestions, was flexible about arrival time and had things well prepared for my arrival. I stayed here for 9 nights and wish it could've been longer. Its super centrally located with quick access to pretty much everything in Seattle. I'm definitely planning on staying here when I'm in Seattle again!!  "
4555997,32252658,2015-05-16,30690609,Emily,Becky is a great host! She let us borrow a pack n play and toys for our one year old and gave us great recommendations for places to eat and things to do around the city. The apartment is very clean and in a great location close to everything. 
4555997,32789864,2015-05-21,33369934,Gabriel,"We had a great time in Becky's place. Everything about the space was great. She was always reaching out to us to ask if we needed anything or give us suggestions of places to go visit. The location was great. If I ever visit Seattle again I would definitely consider staying there again.
The place also has its own separate entrance on the back which makes it more private.  "
4555997,33258123,2015-05-26,30816960,Deb,"We stayed for 4 nights in this studio. It was amazing, just as on the pictures! Very comfortable and cozy! Becky was great! Even though we got to see her only once, she kept in touch if we needed something. We will be back! :)"
4555997,34121982,2015-06-05,26263944,Dianne,"We loved this place!!  Upon entering, we were greeted with a snack, bottle of wine, and fresh flowers.  We knew we had arrived at our vacation ""home.""  After a long flight, it was a perfect way to begin our stay!  The apartment is new, fresh, and bright.  We loved the private entrance as we didn't feel like we were bothering anyone as we came and went.  Coming from car-dependent Florida, we didn't know how valuable a private parking space is in Seattle until after we arrived and saw ""the lay of the land.""  Having a private parking space to park our rental car was an added bonus!  This apartment has everything you need to make your stay comfortable.  You won't go wrong renting this space!"
4555997,34723918,2015-06-11,32830355,Diahn,"Becky was very responsive from the beginning.  The place was perfect, shiny new, very clean, and stocked with everything we needed.  The neighborhood was quiet and convenient to the places we wanted to visit."
4555997,35580692,2015-06-20,14486883,Michele,"This is a beautiful, new, and clean studio.  It's located in the safe, quiet, and historic Queen Anne Hill neighborhood.  It is close to anything you want to see in Seattle.  The houses in this area are just beautiful - some are old Craftsman style and others are newer.  The main house was newer and just beautiful.  This studio is above the homeowner's garage and has a completely separate entry which makes it very private.  I love AirBnB because of properties like this one."
4555997,36087856,2015-06-25,26684315,Daniel,"The place was amazing, it had an amazing view the location was great too definitely made my trip to Seattle fun and easier. Would recommend to anyone "
4555997,36861928,2015-07-02,27614755,Joelle,"Fabulous place to stay! Place looked exactly the same as the pictures. Super clean and nice and private. The location was great, a quick drive to downtown and many restaurants quite close. It was really nice to have a parking spot as there seems to be very limited amounts available. Becky was very accommodating, we had some technical difficulties which made us late for check in. She left us to do our own thing, but was extremely nice and checked in via airb&b texts a few times to make sure we had everything we needed. She also had some great suggestions on where to eat (through the airb&b app). I would recommend this to anyone looking to visit Seattle. And for the price, it really can't be beat!! Thanks Becky for a great stay!!!"
4555997,38828501,2015-07-19,31242527,Allyson,"The place was beautiful and in a very nice neighborhood. We couldn't have asked for a better place to stay at during our trip. Becky was always very fast to respond to any messages before and during our stay. She even left a bottle of wine for us on the counter once we got there. The place had everything that we could need including a washer/dryer which was very nice. The closet divides the living room from the bedroom making it feel more roomy and gives a little privacy. Overall, the experience was great."
4555997,41924234,2015-08-10,9560528,Ian,"What a fantastic time we had here. A friend and I were looking for a place to stay in Seattle, and little ""home base"" where we could strike out from. Becky's wonderful little apartment was just what we needed. Quiet, safe neighborhood, comfortable furnishings, and all the amenities you could ask for.

If/when we decide to come back to Seattle, We're definitely going to check if Becky's lovely apartment is available."
4555997,45460232,2015-09-03,23717157,Sara,"Becky made us feel so welcomed to Seattle! She made sure we had everything we needed and was always easy to reach and communicate with.  The apartment was perfect for us, we stayed for a little over 3 weeks and had everything we needed - including fresh cooking herbs potted outside our door! :)   It has so much natural light and is so well decorated, not to mention there are awesome views! The location was in such a quaint quiet neighborhood and easy to get to downtown via car or bike or into the Ballard / Fremont area.  We had a parking spot for our car and a safe covered area for our bikes.  We can't wait to go back!

4555997,46733478,2015-09-13,17383307,Adam,"Our stay in Seattle was awesome and Becky's place was perfect!

Comfortable, clean, new and really well thought out, as well as in a really convenient location to a number of great places in Seattle :)

Becky was also a really great host, providing lots of information and support and making us feel welcome!"
4555997,47654153,2015-09-21,12370036,Amy,"While we did not get a chance to meet Becky in person, she was great at communicating via email during our visit to make sure we had everything we needed.  The apartment was clean (and bright!) just as described.  I would definitely consider staying here again on a future trip to Seattle.

Queen Anne is a lovely neighborhood located just close enough to the city center that it's not really a problem getting there by Uber/Lyft.  It's also within tolerable walking distance of the super cool Ballard area, which we visited several times."
4555997,48507451,2015-09-27,36475698,Tanya,"Becky and Mike are just great!  They were available by phone and in person during our stay.  The place is even better in person than in the photos: neat, clean, and perfectly suited our family of 3.  "
4555997,49981517,2015-10-08,418689,Debra,"The apartment is cosy, clean, comfortable and quiet. Becky was a pleasure to deal with and very welcoming. Many activities only a short journey away. Would highly recommend this rental."

It's a great location in Queen Anne. Grocery store right down the street and very convenient to downtown Seattle. Becky was very welcoming and helpful. I would stay here again in a heart beat. 
4555997,55115391,2015-11-28,13122605,Michael,"Becky and Mike have a wonderful apartment above their new detached garage.  They were very gracious hosts, and the apartment is well appointed, modern, and very clean.  The views are spectacular, especially at night.  A huge benefit is the alley parking space directly in front of the stairway to the apartment.     "
4555997,57299248,2015-12-24,14341757,Jeanne,We loved our stay in the little Queen Anne cottage. It was so comfy and decorated just adorably.  It was also very clean. The separate entrance and parking space really made it convenient. We didn't drive much as it was a short walk down the hill to the D Line which takes you right downtown.  Having a kitchen was an extra bonus. The kitchen had everything we needed. We cooked two meals a day and went out for one - which saved us lots of money. We would definitely stay there again. Thank you Becky!

3424991,15841466,2014-07-16,12656400,Emma,"Everyone in the house was very welcoming. The house was clean and comfortable. There was coffee and iced tea. Leah gave us a fan, which made the record heat much more comfortable, and Michael helped us find parking (there isn't much parking in the neighborhood)."
3424991,16309480,2014-07-25,16167506,Patricia,The neighborhood was a very cute area. It was a easy bus ride to downtown Seattle. Micheal was welling to work with me on my arrival time.  I did not have a chance to meet Micheal but it was  great place to stay   
3424991,16417228,2014-07-27,16773673,Caitlin,"Feedback for seattle

The house location is good if you want to hang out in funky Capitol Hill. Buses run to the area fairly frequently.  The room is basic but all you need sleep. There a double bed, desk, chair and wardrobe space. The wifi is strong and fast. There's two flights of stairs though so keep that keep that in mind if you have lots of bags. I had an early flight out so I packed early and left my largest suitcase down stairs the night before so I didn't wake anyone by dragging it downstairs at 5 am. The area's not noisy so you'll sleep well. Although the shower pressure is the only thing I'd warn you about. It's like a mist which is unfortunately not great for washing your hair. But Leah and Michael are friendly and very welcoming. Leah was proactive with communication,  confirm the reservation and letting me know about an event happening in the area. She also accommodated my changed check in time."
3424991,16577029,2014-07-29,5872638,Juventino,Michael's place was a great starting and end point to each day while visiting the neighborhood of Capitol Hill. Location is right off of Broadway in the heart of it all. Very accommodating with our questions leading up to check in and met us shortly upon arrival. 
3424991,16684497,2014-07-31,17588342,Evan,"Staying at 419 is the bees knees! Everyone that lives there is incredibly nice and welcoming, and I felt at home the entire time staying there. Their friendliness, helpfulness, and flexibility made my move to Seattle so much easier than I thought it would be. My stay here also made me really appreciate the neighborhood, which partly led to my getting an apartment just down the road. 10/10, would recommend."
3424991,16853917,2014-08-03,13013806,Sylvain,"The house is located in a really cool aera, near from everything by walk or by bus. Michael and all his roomates were very helpful and give us a lot of advises. The room was ok. It´s a good place to stay."
3424991,17002108,2014-08-05,17939170,Cale,"As promised, a clean and quiet bedroom in Capitol Hill. Great location - was about five blocks walk from basically anywhere I went all weekend. "
3424991,17227719,2014-08-09,18295746,Suzie,Really nice guy who made our stay for comfortable. He left a key in the mailbox so we were able to check in as soon as we got there whether someone was home or not and let us keep our luggage at his place late on the evening we checked out. Great first airbnb experience and would definitely stay with Michael and in this awesome neighborhood again! 
3424991,17377734,2014-08-11,17323452,Daniel,"This was our very first airbnb stay, so it was a new experience for us. Michael was a great host. We got in kind of late, so we didn’t end up talking that much, but he was very conversational and friendly. I got the feeling he would talk as long as we wanted to talk, but he was super gracious when we said we couldn’t stay up long.

The room was just as pictured. The bed was comfortable. The kitchen was nice. 

Our only complaint was the bathroom. It wasn’t that the bathroom was dirty, per se, but it felt very lived in, and maybe that is really normal for an airbnb but it was slightly discomforting to us in the bathroom. The airbnb description does note that the house is “lived-in”, and that was fine everywhere (charming really) except the bathroom. That may just be our own personal hang-up though. Again, it wasn’t that the bathroom was notably dirty- it just felt like we were using someone else’s used bathroom. 

Aside from that one personal issue with the bathroom, we enjoyed the stay. The location is great. A couple bus routes stop close by, so there is easy transit access. The price was good. Michael was enjoyable."
3424991,17784449,2014-08-17,9622374,Jennifer,"Michael is a terrific host. My situation was a little different in that I wasn't visiting  Seattle for tourism, but rather moving here from across the country for work and needed a flexible option that allowed me to move into my new digs whenever I found them. Michael was that flexible, on both ends of my stay. Key exchange was easy. Room and house were as described. Great conversations, too. The house is in a fantastic part of town, two blocks west of Broadway. I would recommend to anyone wanting to stay in the heart of the best neighborhood in Seattle. "
3424991,17921173,2014-08-18,11841468,Thomas,"Groovy roommates, nice neighborhood, and the room is exactly what it looks like in the pictures.  "
3424991,18210491,2014-08-23,4193611,Andrew,"Good location in a great neighborhood. Roommates were helpful, room was comfy and quiet. Recommended!"
3424991,18435505,2014-08-26,19603187,Danny,"The room is exactly as shown in the pictures and also exactly what I was looking for. It's a little bare but I don't what else you'd want in it. The roommates provide some Seattle sightseeing suggestion material in the room, also great suggestions for local spots. The area was pretty great, extremely easy to walk downtown. Also plenty of shops, restaurants and night life just blocks from the apartment. Didn't see much of the hosts but was out and about most of the time. They were extremely quick on their responses to any texts though. Overall had a great trip, would definitely stay again."
3424991,18738954,2014-08-31,19074484,Megan,"I communicated with Leah and she was very responsive throughout our stay. I felt I could text her with any questions/concerns. 
The room is very simple if you need a room in a good location to explore Seattle. Capitol Hill is a great neighborhood. 
There were maps and recommendations in the room to help us explore the neighborhood.
My only negatives for this stay were the shower with very low water pressure and the fact that the smoke alarms had been disabled. Perhaps there is a good reason for this, but it seemed unsafe. 

Otherwise the house was quiet and the roommates were respectful. 

Thanks Leah and Michael."
3424991,18890769,2014-09-02,2287375,Curtis,"The room was set up for us when we got there with a nice welcome letter and information sheets. It was super easy to get to and from downtown, and while we didn't see the hosts very much, they didn't mind that we were back late and out early."
3424991,19306290,2014-09-09,3240883,Wolf,"The host was very quick to respond and was super accommodating. The room was exactly what I needed. Nothing fancy, but it's a really great location. Tons of cool bars and restaurants in walking distance.  I only met two of the roommates when I first checked in and they seemed like nice people. 
The host acknowledged some of the negative aspects highlighted in the previous reviews. Mainly the bathroom cleanliness and shower water pressure. The bathroom was clean. I could tell they recently replaced the shower head to try to fix the pressure issue, but the pressure was still humorously low."
3424991,19353004,2014-09-10,8013961,Chris,The house is in a great location and the roomates were super nice and very easy to work with.  The house had a great community feel and I would definitely stay here again. 
3424991,19447326,2014-09-12,21087512,Nino,"I communicated with Leah regarding the details and the booking. She was very good and very responsive, although we never met in person. I did meet Michael, Nick and Austin, i believe, and they were solid guys and cool. 

If you are young, single and looking to experience Seattle, then this is a great crash pad. Very close to bars and restaurants and a quick, cheap cab ride to Pike's and downtown. 

The comments from the other reviewers about the shower are fair and accurate. Another key point - there's zero parking so if you have a rental car or something, it's a big problem. "
3424991,24132505,2014-12-21,19934854,Kevin,"The location is great, expect to be in walking distance of most things within the city. Leah and Michael take requests very well, and work to accommodate as best they can. The house can get really loud when people are leaving and entering, and sound bleeds through many of the walls here. The shower pressure here can definitely throw people off, so be prepared! This room would be your perfect stop in  Capitol Hill for a short stay while you are out exploring Seattle. "
3424991,24311434,2014-12-25,11282131,Hiroki,"Leah was responsive when we were communicating before the stay.  During my stay, I met Austin and Leah.  They are both friendly, welcoming, and caring.  Capitol Hill apparently is a great location to travell around Seattle, with quite a few pubs, cafes, restaurants, etc, and I enjoyed the convenience and the quiet environment around the house.  The house feels lived-in, and well maintained and clean.

Shower water pressure was very low, but it's got good hot water so that wasn't a big problem for me.  I would imagine it would be even less so in summer time."
3424991,25115298,2015-01-06,25349546,Josha,"Leah and the team at the ""Capitol Hill Excursion"" did a great job! Cosy place, a great location close to all of the fun spots on the hill, and easy access to downtown. "
3424991,25336218,2015-01-12,24908933,Stephanie,Everything was perfect. It was a great stay and we lived the space. Check in and check out was easy and everything was comfortable. I would stay again! 
3424991,25376721,2015-01-13,25892167,Dennis,"unfortunately we did not meet in person, but the flat was neat and clean, and the neighbourhood (capitol hill) is cool too."
3424991,25880377,2015-01-28,17601819,Drew,"The hospitality and environment were fantastic! Had a great time, definite recommend. "
3424991,26056610,2015-02-02,12852756,Jennifer,"Leah was attentive to our needs and was able to accommodate my early arrival easily. She's helpful if you need recommendations around the city and great if you need some pointers around the city. Everything is as described. I had no problems with the water pressure for the shower but the toilet took some time getting used to as it won't flush until you wait awhile longer but that wasn't a big concern for us. I'm glad that there was a heater in the room because it can get real cold during the winter for someone who lives in socal weather. Overall, it was a great stay for this price!"
3424991,27320036,2015-03-02,657741,Mihai,Spent a month here during my recent work trip to Seattle. Leah was very responsive and helpful during my stay. I was on a weird schedule so I didn't interact with many people but everyone I met was very nice. I appreciated being able to come in and out at all hours of the night and can't beat the location. Bathroom was clean and always available when I needed it and shower pressure issue seems to have been resolved.
3424991,27686511,2015-03-09,13046897,Tara,Their place was very welcoming and walking distance to everything! We had a great time visiting Seattle!
3424991,28138745,2015-03-18,28323638,Pat,Very comfortable spot in a great location! Would definitely recommend it to anyone looking to stay in capitol hill. 
3424991,29271251,2015-04-06,25372364,Meagan,"Michael, Leah and their roommate were very informative and welcoming. The room is as described and is in a nice are in town. They were responsive and easy to communicate. Everything was clean and neat."
3424991,30410784,2015-04-21,27535752,Arne,Everything as described. Great location for exploring the city and the neighborhood. Communication was excellent. I would definitely stay here again.
3424991,30654284,2015-04-25,27475009,Max,Perfect for what I was looking for. Great location and the house has all the basics covered. 
3424991,31831454,2015-05-10,8015319,Mia,I had a wonderful experience here! The room was exactly what we needed and the location was very convenient. The hosts were very informative and friendly while also giving us privacy. They went above and beyond making sure that guests were comfortable and satisfied! Parking was a little difficult but not impossible. I would absolutely stay here again next time I visit the city.
3424991,32009845,2015-05-12,14292284,Pj,"Michael and Leah were quick to respond to any questions I had. They provided very thorough travel instructions and welcoming emails that I felt as though there wouldn't be any problems (and there weren't!) arriving rather late after a long train ride. And they even had house food available, in the fridge and countertop, which was awesome because I was starving when I got in. 

The house was in a safe (from what I could tell) neighbourhood and was quite easy to find. Bars, coffee shops and a grocery/pharmacy store are minutes away. As they say in their description, it's not a new house, but it had a warm and cozy feel. The kitchen and living room were open for use. The room itself was clean, large enough for 1-2 people with a bed (with warm blankets) and desk. There was even a personal electric kettle in the room.

My stay was very brief, but I would definitely recommend!"
3424991,32619831,2015-05-19,32942136,Max,"Hosts were great. Super friendly, great place. Fun neighborhood. Would totally stay again."
3424991,33921458,2015-06-02,18985157,Suzanne,"Very comfortable clean room with coffee and nice assortment of teas. Shared items available in kitchen. Wifi naturally.
Immediate response from host for my questions.
Quiet residential neighborhood but just a couple blocks from commercial activity. Major food supermarket, restaurants and of course, a Starbucks were a few minutes walk away. A perfect location.
"
3424991,35702697,2015-06-21,5881686,Basil,Great host.  I had a fine experience. They were very attentive to my needs and very welcoming.
3424991,36680639,2015-06-30,32798649,Amy,"I'm so happy my friend Veronica and I were able to stay here at 419! Though Michael wasn't home, Leah was super welcoming and made sure all of my questions were answered. Communication was excellent and I knew all that was required of me as well as was given suggestions of where to go. Leah brought us guests doughnuts one day which was really sweet 3 Austin was also very nice! The neighborhood was amazing and very close to lots of shops :) Thanks to 419 household it was a very enjoyable stay, I would definitely stay here again. Thank you thank you!"
3424991,37078324,2015-07-04,12654181,Karen,"I always love staying at Michael and Leah's home. The neighborhood is beautiful and the house is located within a very quick walk to grocery stores, restaurants and coffee, as well as the bus to take you downtown. 
I will always stay here when I visit Seattle. I stayed here last March and it had only gotten better!"
3424991,37379747,2015-07-06,5280526,Rieke,It was fun to stay at Michael's house. I did not meet Michael in person but everything was well organized and Leah communicated excellent. I met nice people and spent the 4th of July at beach party organized by the house which was a great welcome.  
3424991,38518343,2015-07-16,35878895,Rachel,"This was an excellent stay! I never had much issue getting into the (one) bathroom when needed, the location is close to bus lines to make it easy to get around the city, and the neighborhood has a great vibe. 

Hosts were very accommodating and we were able to leave our bags before/after checkout for a little extra time as we walked around the city. "
3424991,38744517,2015-07-18,31940173,Ashleigh,"Leah and Austin were great hosts (Michael was out of town). I needed a place to sleep and shower while I was in town apartment hunting and interviewing, and their place suited my needs just fine! I was able to check in way earlier than what was planned, which was wonderful, and they were flexible with my check out time too. Great location, super close to Broadway, lots to walk to, and Leah offered helpful suggestions, was nice to talk to and easy to get in touch with via text. I wasn't around often and was up super early, so I never had a problem getting into the bathroom or kitchen. Would stay here again for a short trip (but I won't need to since I'm moving to Seattle now)!"
3424991,41458077,2015-08-07,19804402,Dmitriy,"Great neighborhood with fast access to highways, center of Seattle, and good restaurants within walking distance.  Great checkin and checkout instructions for the house and good communication throughout stay there."
3424991,42392677,2015-08-13,31991777,Seth,Great location and good price.  I never met Michael or Leah but everything was in order and I never had any problems.  Would stay there again.
3424991,43102121,2015-08-17,17039149,Johanna,"Michael and Leah were great hosts! Leah was the primary contact during our stay because Michael was out of town, but she was super accommodating and was quick to respond with texts. Their location was close to all the bus lines so we were traveling around town like locals. The binder provided in the room had directions were written out clearly so we didn't have any trouble navigating ourselves around the house from the get go. Will definitely be looking forward to stay with them again the next time I'm in town! "
3424991,44496259,2015-08-26,42076842,Xu,I had a good experience staying with Michael and Leah. The place is close downtown and convenient with buses. They make everything pretty clear and easy. 
3424991,46558529,2015-09-11,1339330,Timothy,"This was a great place to stay.  First off it is well located walking distance from downtown, and in a neighborhood with lots of great bars and restaurants.  The room was clean and had everything needed. Overall it was a great place to stay.  "
3424991,47823159,2015-09-21,7583246,Jonah,"Awesome location and price. The apartment was as described in the listing. It's by no means new or pristine, but works well if location is more important to you than luxury. The hosts were helpful and provided us with some nice amenities like a coffee maker, hair dryer/straightener, irons, city maps, etc.
"
3424991,48593190,2015-09-27,30353275,Emiliano,Nice neighbourhood and warm welcome.
3424991,49062311,2015-09-30,26501715,Bronwyn,Great location. I was a little scared to enter as none of the entryway lights were turning on. But after I got upstairs I realized I in fact was in the right place! The visitors manual was very useful and helpful. 
3424991,52847610,2015-11-02,40018387,Jameson & Michelle,"My boyfriend and I had a great experience staying at Leah's. The room was furnished with a lot of goodies (french press to make coffee, a list of places to check out) and the bathroom even contained necessities that guests may need to use. Needless to say, we were immediately able to make ourselves at home. The location is stellar, as it is conveniently located on Capitol Hill - bars, cafés, and little shops aplenty. Not only that, a QFC grocer is only a few steps away. Amazing! I would definitely recommend this place to anybody. Thank you, Leah!"
3424991,54116274,2015-11-16,21979218,Liam,"Had a great stay. Michael and Leah  made it really easy to check in and out and had everything labelled very well for the guests. As well as an extremely thorough visitor's guide which was very helpful. Outstanding location, we were able to walk, or take a quick bus, to all the places we wanted to go. Excited to come back!"
3424991,54757263,2015-11-23,30703249,Julia,"We had a good stay at Michael. He and Leah provided plenty of information upfront. We had close contact to them though we never met each other. Bars and restaurants are close by, it's a great neighbourhood."
3424991,55074633,2015-11-27,26327758,Tangwei,"In big city, it is very hard to find a clean room at this price. The room make me feel like a better hostel.  We have our independent room. The host  is busy doing her own thing, coz thanksgiving. Everything is on the handbook, you just need to follow instruction. Still a good place to stay."
1179538,54492069,2015-11-20,49301240,Francesca,"I was searching for a place last minute for my three piece band and I after our sleeping arrangements fell through. Varun was more than willing to host us on such short notice, Incredibly kind and easy going. Very clean home ! Overall excellent experience"
1179538,55507128,2015-12-01,49230937,Natalie,"Very nice apartment, clean and quite."
3624990,20029700,2014-09-22,6074769,Christie,"The location is super convenient to the state convention center, and an easy walk to all the downtown shopping, restaurants, and exploring at Pike Place Market. The condo is clean and comfortable, and Doug gave a helpful introduction to the local resources along with his tour of the condo's amenities."
3624990,23031040,2014-11-21,19473144,Megan,"This apartment is in a great location - easy walk down to central downtown area, and also short walk up the hill to trendy Capitol Hill area which is great to explore. We were made to feel very welcome with the host easy to contact and would drop by if required. The place itself was exactly like photos. Great space and very clean with nice atmosphere. Is was like a lovely private sanctuary in the middle of the busy area. Peaceful, warm, cosy and a really nice place to stay. Easy access to grocery store and short walk to big department stores, waterfront, monorail to attractions and also lots of parks and restaurants."
3624990,27384730,2015-03-03,23852813,Justine,"Absolutely perfect stay! Doug & Rebecca were so accommodating and friendly, I definitely recommend their condo to future Seattle guests!"

3624990,29827002,2015-04-13,5703826,Janice,"Great, clean place in a perfect location for anything at the convention center! The landlord was very accessible and flexible. Everything Downtown, First Hill and Capitol Hill area are within walking distance and it is right down the road from Victrola Coffee Roasters!"
3624990,31793991,2015-05-10,13052628,Jordan,"What an amazing place to stay in Seattle! A few of my girlfriends stayed at Rebecca's for a little college reunion/girls weekend and we had a fantastic time!  The apartment is nice and spacious, enough for 6 girls to feel comfortable and not on top of each other.  All of the beds are very comfortable and the building is really nice.  The location is great. 10 minute walk to Pikes Market and everything else downtown. I would absolutely stay here again! "
3624990,32446221,2015-05-18,24660858,Colleen,"We had an excellent stay at Seattle Suites! The apartment was exactly as advertised - clean, comfortable, close to the downtown sights, and with many amenities. Rebecca and Doug were also easy to reach and very helpful. I would recommend this listing to anyone wanting to visit Seattle."
3624990,32954604,2015-05-24,22378313,Ryan,"The apartment was clean and accurate to the description. Location was very convenient for our group, who were spending time at the convention center.  The building and area felt safe.  I would say the only downside is the uncomfortable pull out couch for guests #5 and 6.  Overall, our group would recommend this apartment to others."
3624990,35297846,2015-06-17,2457555,Sharon,"We were warmly greeted by Doug at the time agreed.  The apartment was just wonderful!  It was perfect for my husband, myself and our two teen girls.  The apartment is located at the edge of the conference center and a straight walk down to Pike Place Market.  We were close to Capital Hill, First Hill, and Downtown.  It was perfect!  Nice and quiet location so close to everything Downtown Seattle has to offer."
3624990,36782055,2015-07-01,33029028,Simon,"The apartment was clean, tidy and as described. Doug was really friendly and helpful, and flexible when we were delayed. The apartment is in an excellent location, a 10 min walk to the downtown area. Would definitely recommend."
3624990,42509459,2015-08-14,1329969,Joke,"We were with 7 people in rebecca's two 2-bed appartments for a conference in the convention Center. It was perfect, the apartments were clean, big, comfortable and the location for us was perfect! By day we could hop in and out of the apartment during conference breaks, and in the night we were so close to Capitol Hill, where there are numerous great restaurants and bars. Would definitely recommend!"
3624990,46118182,2015-09-08,2005229,Brandon,Great place in the middle of the city. Easy to get around from here. Clean place and had everything we needed. Working with Becki was easy and had no problems working around some crazy scheduling. Thanks!
3624990,49000780,2015-09-30,21815461,Kellye,"We loved how close it was to the Convention Center and it was very convenient for the two of us attending our conference right next door.  Doug was great and accommodating, being flexible with me on our arrival and departure times. He even helped me with my luggage from the parking garage. We had everything we needed and loved hanging out on the rooftop deck to watch the solar eclipse.  If there is any room for improvement, I would recommend outlining the arrival procedure a little better upfront, especially regarding getting to the parking space, to prevent any confusion. Also, some updates to the bathroom would be very nice since it is on the smaller side. Overall, we were pleased with our stay and had a great experience."
3624990,49768901,2015-10-06,37578535,Michael,"Comfortability upon arrival and everything within a walking distance! The three of us settled in quickly and had plenty of options of where to sleep. All of the furniture was more than comfortable and it all seemed quite clean. No complaints on our end, we truly were spoiled here. We even got to see the nice veiw from the roof! All in all a great trip of seeing Seattle, we would definitely book a trip again!"
3624990,50436321,2015-10-12,37419458,Ryan,"The description and pictures of the apartment were exactly what we received. Moreover, the place was very nice and we really enjoyed our stay! The location was perfect for being near to the conference center. In addition, we stayed during a weird stretch of weather (sometimes hot, sometimes cold), and they were very accommodating by providing both extra heating and cooling units. Check-in was smooth and thorough. We appreciated receiving 6 sets of keys, since we had 4 adults staying in the same place. Also, we forgot to return one of the parking fobs when we checked out, and they let us return it late without an issue. All together, a very enjoyable experience and we would stay here again!"
3624990,51024875,2015-10-17,6933252,Linda,"We had an excellent stay. It was clean and comfortable, and very convenient to the convention center and downtown. The beds were comfy, the apartment was quiet, I would stay there again any time. "

3624990,52814482,2015-11-02,24445024,Jørgen,"Very good apartement, clean and well sized. Situated next to the convension center, take the back entrance and you will be there in no time. In walking distance to most everything downtown, and close to good places like the six arms just 100yrds up the street. on the negative side can two of the rooms be some what noisy due laundry in the building."
9727246,56429621,2015-12-13,30860360,Stephanie,"Breanne was a great host. Check in was easy, she let me in right on schedule and her place was very comfortable and clean, just as described.  She even left out some postcards and toiletries-which were very much appreciated. I loved that there was a Trader Joe's across the street. I would definitely stay here again. Cheers!"
