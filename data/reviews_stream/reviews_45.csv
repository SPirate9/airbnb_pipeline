5372156,40452214,2015-07-31,12085080,Evi,"The apartment was really lovely. It was clean, simple and sunny. It was fully equiped, it had even a washing machine and a dryer - and my favorite: a TV with NetFlix! We felt really comfortable and pampered at this place. Another one asset we found was a small cafe on the same building where we could grab a cup of coffee and a snack when we were to hasty or lazy to make owr own! The location is great, one can reach Seattle downtown or Capitol hill in a few minutes walk (althouth sometimes the walk can be uphill :) ). Eve was a great host and very flexible with our check - in and check-out times. Thanks for everything :)"
5372156,45065420,2015-08-31,32861127,Kevin,"My wife and I were visiting the city for a convention so we were looking for a location that was within walking distance to the center but also avoided the usual crowds. We honestly didn't think it would be possible but this location definitely fit our needs. 

Everything about this place and experience were perfect. The apartment was clean and the amenities were great. Our host Morgan was also extremely attentive and dropped off a small gift to welcome us. The building was quiet and the view from the roof deck was amazing. The next time we visit Seattle, we'll be sure to book this location again."
5372156,46065974,2015-09-07,10797464,Olivier,"The good: place is gorgeous and very clean, and conveniently lovated right next to downtown. Place is also very quiet. The building is as good as the appartment.

The bad: the place is advertised for 3, but there's only one bed et the couch doesn't fold out. Michael has dealt with it in a professional way, so i'm still overall pretty happy with our stay, but it's worth noting.

Bottom line: for 2 or less, it's a great place. If you don't mind sleeping on a leather couch with no bedding, the place is also great."
5372156,46608558,2015-09-12,28499874,Mai-King,"Beautiful apartment set up, very welcoming and modern.  Easy to get to in the heart of Seattle.  Very responsive in terms of instructions and answering questions."
5372156,47515183,2015-09-19,12639004,Jonathan,"The apartment was great, exactly as advertised. My stay was very easy and relaxing. Would recommend to anyone visiting seattle.  "
5372156,48589437,2015-09-27,42595863,Samantha,Daniela was extremely accomodating and friendly!  She made this trip a breeze.  I highly recommend!
5372156,49169646,2015-10-01,22458501,Adrian,"Michael and Daniela are both excellent people. I had the chance to meet Michael when there was no light in the apartment. He came by and solve the issue right away. Daniela was very helpful too. She reached out to me on the phone and made sure that my problem was solved, and most importantly, that I was comfortable and happy. I would recommend both, Michael and Daniela, without any hesitation."
5372156,51419318,2015-10-19,30550392,Kelly,Everything was great! We needed extra towels which they brought right over along with a bottle of wine. Thanks again
5372156,55329297,2015-11-29,49978870,Cecilia,"Everything went smoothly,  was just as described, and a bottle of wine was left on the bed! Great location. Quick help when needed. I left a drawer full of valuables, and they're currently in the process of helping me get them back!! I'll definitely stay again when in Seattle.  "
5372156,56690784,2015-12-16,7835274,Bonnie,Self check in was fine. We utilized the adjacent parking lot. Smart TV worked flawlessly. Good WiFi. Unfortunately there is only a sofa and a desk chair for seating. A comfortable lounge chair would be a great addition. 
3768626,17317062,2014-08-10,2479220,Kevin,"My experience at the Clean and Simple Green Lake Studio was great.  The location worked out well for my needs, and the restaurant options nearby were very good.   Crystal and Jamie were very welcoming and eager to do anything to make my stay pleasant.  "
3768626,17423948,2014-08-11,1276850,Sarah,"Crystal was great getting back to me. She made it easy to check in and arrive late, which we ended up having to do...

Very large room, easy drive to downtown but not very close, so quiet. Neighborhood is extremely pleasant with large yards loaded with roses and beautiful bungalows with families playing outdoors and walking in the street. good value!


I have hosted a lot but never been a guest before- it was nice. Crystal is new at hosting- I see a great future for her! "
3768626,17650683,2014-08-15,15571363,Adriana,"Crystal's house definitely made my mom and I want to move to Seattle one day! The house is located in a beautiful neighborhood surrounded by many more trees and plants than I've ever seen. The neighborhood also has the smallest streets I've ever seen so I would warn anyone renting a car not from the area to be careful driving around.

Crystal was very prompt with sending over instructions how to get to her house. It made travelling a bit less hectic knowing where we were going. Once we got there, Crystal greeted us and showed us around what I would call a loft style apartment. As the picture shows it's just one large room with a little kitchen with a sink and toaster oven and a connected bathroom with tub! The room came with helpful instructions as well as Crystal's information just in case anything is needed. (We forgot toothpaste which she was able to supply.) We mostly just used the room for sleeping and using our tablets since there is no TV but wireless! 

Parking was very easy for us throughout the whole time we stayed. Crystal and her family were also great about giving us some privacy. We really didn't see them at all throughout the time we stayed at their place. What I thought was most nifty about the place is that it's keyless. It was very easy to get in and out everyday!

Again my mother and I rented a car so I cannot attest to the public transportation system. The drive into the city and Vancouver was very easy as they are not too far from rt 5 which brings you everywhere. 

This is the perfect place for a couple or a mother daughter duo that doesn't mind invading their own personal space."
3768626,17898538,2014-08-18,19801347,Kelly,"We had a fantastic time at this studio.  The room was very clean and new and the bed was incredibly comfortable.  Crystal had a nice topper on the mattress that made it super soft.  I had one of the best sleeps I've had in a while.  When we came in (pretty late since we had a late flight in), she had left a light on for us and a fan had already cooled the room down.  It was also obvious that she had recently vacuumed the carpets for our arrival.  It was very easy to come and go as we had our own separate entrance & key code for the door.  The neighborhood is very nice & pretty close to the university.  We felt safe walking around at night and during the day.  It was also very easy to take the bus downtown from there.  All in all, we were very happy with our stay.  Thanks, Crystal!"
3768626,18818579,2014-09-01,7825558,Nikhil,"Crystal's studio was the perfect homebase for my wife and I to explore Seattle. It was private, clean, quiet, and located in a beautiful neighborhood (Green Lake) that my wife now wants to move to. We didn't get to meet Crystal, but she was very communicative and very accommodating.

On top of all that Crystal left us a $10 gift card to her favorite nearby coffee shop. And we absolutely understand why she loves it. We would definitely stay here again!"
3768626,19225345,2014-09-08,20333556,Laura,"This was a nice, comfortable place with a good location near many places we wanted to explore on our vacation. Crystal was a good host as well. I would recommend staying here."
3768626,19345615,2014-09-10,16534173,Seth,very nice couple. studio was imaculate. great location very peaceful
3768626,19635973,2014-09-15,20815191,Jay,"After a long morning of travel, we arrived in a very cute and quaint family neighborhood.  It's a very clean and well maintained neighborhood with plenty of street parking.  The location is not far from the freeway, so getting here was very easy.

The place itself is exactly what it looks like in the photos.  It's comfortable, clean, well taken care of.  Crystal was very accommodating and made sure we were ""in the know"" before we arrived, and left us a nice welcome packet with information about the local area, listings of places within walking distance, and touristy things to do while visiting Seattle.  The experience was very pleasant and we can't wait to return to Seattle, and hopefully stay here again. :)"
3768626,20052386,2014-09-22,21102051,Charles,"Really cute studio, very clean, nicely furnished. Ample parking outside. Had a great experience staying here!"
3768626,20442941,2014-09-29,20913503,Brenda,"Crystal and her family made me feel very welcome.  The room and the area were exactly as described.  Quite and within walking distance to restaurants and Greenlake.  It was clean and had everything I needed.  No TV, but I don't watch TV.  There is free Wi-Fi which was stable and reliable.  She provided information about which restaurants were in walking distance and which were worth a drive.  Easy parking (a premium in Seattle).  Crystal was also very quick to respond to my questions.  I would definitely stay there again."
3768626,21007226,2014-10-09,8630240,Carolyn,"Crystal was prompt and courteous all through the prebooking and rental process.  Once at her studio apartment, we found information about the area and she promptly answered our text questions.  Space more than adequate, clean, comfortable and with coffee, creamer, tea and bottled water and all the amenities needed for Bathroom and Kitchen.  Central to our needs in a beautiful neighborhood within walking distance of Green Lake, Tangletown and great restaurants.  Very private, quiet and secure. Great internet service also."
3768626,23883466,2014-12-13,7774074,Kim,"Really enjoyed staying at the studio at the end of my very long days. Bed is a tempurpedic so it was very comfortable. Apt is very quiet and I rarely heard noise from rest of house. Kitchenette was well appointed with small fridge, sink, toaster oven, coffee maker, and electric kettle.  Bottled water and tea as well! 
Studio is located in a great neighborhood with easy access to main streets and bus routes. 
Exactly what I needed for my stay in Seattle. 
"
3768626,24666933,2015-01-01,6047714,Paul,"Fantastic stay, great location, very comfortable.  Highly recommend!"
3768626,27224583,2015-02-28,27748348,Karen,"Listing was just as portrayed.  Very helpful information was left by the host about nearby restaurants, places to see, etc.  Quiet neighborhood, easy to negotiate. Would stay here again & recommend it highly."
3768626,32931974,2015-05-23,33318784,Theresa,"Great studio! Very comfortable, well-lit, and well-stocked with essentials. The neighborhood is quiet and safe, and it's easy enough to walk/bike/bus to anywhere else, with restaurants, coffee shops, and Green Lake Park well within walking distance. Overall I had a wonderful experience here, and would definitely recommend it!"
3768626,33320757,2015-05-26,28785568,Derek,Crystal and Jamie were great hosts. Their restaurant guides were excellent and they provided everything we needed in the room. We loved that they gave us a gift card for a donut place around the corner. We also had a chance to grab a coffee with them on our last day and had a great time sharing Seattle stories.
3768626,34470163,2015-06-08,10459887,Jill,"Charming neighborhood with lots of trees, flowers, pets and children. Quiet street yet excellent location, close to the Interstate, and walking distance to Grren Ake, which we walked twice. 
The hostess had left us a gift card to the local donut shop which we appreciated as the donuts there are special. There was also coffee and bottled water. 
The studio consists of one large room, a kitchen nook with a coffee maker, sink and fridge. Very basic, as is the bathroom, but it had everything we needed. No TV, but we didn't need one."
3768626,34827737,2015-06-12,6491517,Erika,"I had a great experience staying at Crystal's beautiful Studio. There was parking on the street in front of the house every day. The area is very residential, quiet, and family-oriented. There were a lot of kids playing outside in the late afternoons and families taking walks. It was also a close drive to get to restaurants, cafes, and whole foods was about a 7 minute drive away. Green Lake is also close by and a perfect place to go for a morning run. 

Check-in and check-out was seamless and easy since it required no key exchanging. Crystal left me a note on the dresser with a gift card to a local doughnut shop which was a very welcoming touch. All of the essentials were available in the apartment and the studio was very clean. The internet was fast and I had no problems doing video conferences from my laptop. Would definitely recommend staying here! "
3768626,35914124,2015-06-23,21824003,S,"The studio is nice. Very clean, large and comfortable. There was a problem with the keyless entry--but Crystal solved the problem quickly. She made us feel welcome with a handwritten note and information about the neighborhood.

The bed has a memory foam top. My dad didn't like that. But I am sure others do. "
3768626,36231021,2015-06-26,25302567,Rachel,"The description is completely accurate. We had a hand written card with a Mighty-O's treat waiting for us when we arrived. The studio apartment was clean, comfortable, and convenient to many things (including the Woodland Park Zoo, South Green Lake restaurants, and  a grocery store in Wallingford). The neighborhood is quiet, safe, and very cute!"
3768626,36478121,2015-06-28,36270322,Katie,Nice comfortable space in a great Seattle neighborhood! Crystal was very responsive and helpful. I would definitely recommend!
3768626,36584306,2015-06-29,8796651,Julie,"Crystal's sweet studio was perfect for our needs and was very inviting and comfortable.  We stayed there for one night after our wedding and our host left a very thoughtful note with some wonderful snacks in case we had not eaten enough at our reception.  

Highly recommended in a fantastic location and beautiful Seattle neighborhood."
3768626,37702440,2015-07-09,2693988,Michelle,"It is a very comfortable, spacious clean bright studio. It was nice and quiet. As well as private."
3768626,38166498,2015-07-13,35789274,Juan,"Thank you for lending us your space Crystal; we had a great time. The room was exceptionally clean and the small kitchenette was plenty for our needs. It being privately accessible and well located in Wallingford was a total plus. Thank you for the info and recommendations in your welcome packet, the donuts at Mighty O's were good.  "
3768626,38566362,2015-07-16,10799079,Jovan,"Crystal's place was comfortable from the moment I walked in. In addition to looking just like the pictures, it was super clean! There were a handful of nice touches that went above and beyond that I really appreciated. This was my first airbnb experience and it was a great one."
3768626,39197382,2015-07-21,38354595,Veronica,The host canceled this reservation 4 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
3768626,39840331,2015-07-26,38399323,Brianna,"We had a wonderful time in Seattle. The loft was lovely,clean and convenient. Thank you so much for making our trip so memorable. "
3768626,40694208,2015-08-01,2808044,Ann,"Crystal's place was exactly as described.  It was very clean and quiet, which was just what we needed!  The neighborhood was great, and was convenient to downtown Seattle."
3768626,41787223,2015-08-09,21291647,Vanessa,"I couldn't ask for a better host.  The location was perfect for catching the bus, walking to Greenlake, and Tangletown.  Crystal was very helpful and provided local information.  Our stay felt like a home away from.  Thank you Crystal for sharing your unit with us.  "
3768626,42166224,2015-08-11,14215166,Carly,Crystal's place was beautiful and spacious. She went above and beyond hosting expectations!
3768626,42480094,2015-08-13,579582,Scott,"Very nice apartment in a fun, residential neighborhood. The apartment is just like it's described and pictured. There are a bunch of restaurants, coffee shops, etc. that are less than a 10 minute walk. Street parking is very easy - always a spot right in front. Crystal was a super responsive and helpful host. A nice touch was the gift card for the delicious Mighty-O Donuts down the street (thank you!!). I would stay here again for sure."
3768626,42603798,2015-08-14,9534111,Haley,This studio felt clean and refreshing. It was well equipped and Crystal even treated us to a few donuts from their favorite neighborhood spot. 
3768626,44163869,2015-08-24,3063753,Ying,"Crystal’s studio is clean & quiet — just as described — with a lot of space, comfy bed, and convenient kitchen amenities (fridge + sink).

Communication was easy: found the place without issue and enjoyed plentiful parking on the street. Would definitely book the same place again.

Thank you!"
3768626,44950897,2015-08-30,14295640,Janet,"The loft was just as listed.  It was extremely clean and perfect for the couple of nights that we spent there.  
Crystal was an amazing host, leaving a welcome packet outlining everything within walking distance and giving suggestions on some of the best places to try.  She even greeted us with a gift card to a local doughnut shop, that turned out to be amazing.
Checking in was a breeze, and as mentioned in the posting, there was available street parking.
"
3768626,45230004,2015-08-31,23177776,Joshua,"The apartment was very clean with all amenities provided,  and Crystal was very accommodating- she replied to my inquiry immediately and was able to get the place set up on really short notice (ie just about an hour).  She also provided a fantastic guide to near-by eateries, and judging by the few I had already visited they were excellent recommendations .  The place is a few blocks from the bus stop I used, but it was beautiful weather and I didn't mind the walk (and I think there may be closer bus stops-  I just defer all navigation to whatever my Map app tells me).  And there's a great donuts place near-by. Many thanks for providing a comfortable stay on short notice"
3768626,46298436,2015-09-09,40714734,Vicki,"As soon as we arrived at Crystal's studio, we felt welcome and at home.  The studio was cozy, charming, and comfortable.  The neighborhood was quiet and lovely with tree lined streets, lake views, and lots of amenities within walking distance. . . as well as a bus nearby that took us right to the heart of Seattle.  We had a wonderful visit and in large part that was due to our accommodating hosts who provided a folder with excellent tips and even a gift card to one of their favorite spots.  They were exceptional hosts and it was a real joy to be able to stay there."
3768626,47089045,2015-09-15,18838646,Anne,"Staying at The  Clean and Simple Green was very convenient and close to our  daughter .The  studio was very simple  but clean as described.
Crystal was available if I had any questions . The GreenLake  location is great for all out door activities.
I would recommend additional bedside lighting as there was only one  nightstand and lamp.Also it would have been very pleasant if the out door  space was set-up and  cleaned for our use . There was  no TV, radio or clock.... something to think about for the  future.
Thanks  for hosting us ."
3768626,48621716,2015-09-27,44473401,Dennis,"Listing was accurate. Neighborhood quiet, safe, good vibe.
Crystal was discreet . Even though we never met, directions for everything were clear and helpful, and she was always responsive to my requests.
My car was broken into in the UW district and my suitcase was stolen .
Crystal was helpful in providing basic necessities ."
3768626,48818084,2015-09-28,44699166,Cherida,"We had a very good stay in Crystal's studio apartment.  She gave very helpful instructions about how to get in, the apartment was clean and comfortable, spacious, quiet and peaceful.  The photos were very representative of what we found, and the apartment served our needs very well.  The neighborhood was welcoming and peaceful, and lovely for walks.  Crystal left a gift card for donuts nearby, and we really enjoyed this special treat the next morning!  We would be very happy to stay there again!"
3768626,49750187,2015-10-05,39878622,Denise,Crystal was a great host...she communicated well with check in and check out instructions and left a contact number if we needed anything.  The place was clean and very comfortable. There were plenty of towels  and everything we needed was there.  I loved the gift card to her favorite doughnut shop....they are vegan donuts and so yummy! Great neighborhood!
3768626,50570326,2015-10-12,6951289,Patrick,"I highly recommend Crystal’s studio if you’re looking for a place to stay in the Wallingford/Green Lake area. It’s clean, cozy, private, and very spacious, and the location is great: it’s on a lovely residential street with plenty of parking, and there’s a lot of stuff within walking distance. Crystal left us a detailed welcome packet along with a gift card to nearby Mighty-O Donuts, which was a very nice touch!"
3768626,51253039,2015-10-18,46323378,Dale,"Very nice studio with kitchenette built into an older home in the Green Lake area. Walking distance to pubs, restaurants and Green Lake. Clean and comfortable. We'd stay there again for sure. "
3768626,51415872,2015-10-19,45405107,Karen,"Clean, private, great neighborhood!"
3768626,55307072,2015-11-29,45318909,Brent,"The place was great and exactly as described. Crystal was great to work with, I highly recommend this place"
2112625,9870769,2014-01-15,6122597,Aaron,"I can not imagine better hosts than Abe, Leah and Job. The room is comfortable offering the perfect balance between privacy and interaction with the hosts, the bathroom is impeccably clean and the hosts are extremely friendly and accommodating. This was the perfect place to stay for a couple days after moving to Seattle and looking for an apartment. "
2112625,10010950,2014-01-25,9376688,Dee,"Thoughtful and friendly hosts.  Good location, close to public transit and downtown Seattle.  The accommodation is clean, comfortable and nicely appointed.  Arriving to find snacks set out for me, felt like I was being welcomed to a lovely resort.  Small refrigerator in room was an added convenience.  Overall, a very good experience.  Would stay again.  Abe, thanks again for making me feel so welcome!"
2112625,10692450,2014-03-03,11979183,Clay,"For the record- I really only slept there. I was at a five day convention from early morning til well into every night, at which point I came home only to sleep. That being said, this home is run by some very nice people. The bedroom was on the bottom floor of a townhouse, so my comings and goings were a bother to no one. I also had my own bathroom. There was a towel and a mini-fridge of water bottles in my room when I got there. Every time I went to the upstairs common area, I found someone studying. The house is quiet and relaxed and I was even welcomed to the beer in the fridge. If you're looking for something inexpensive and chill, this is the place. "
2112625,11100863,2014-03-20,13001267,Anthony,"Very clean house in a central location.  The hosts are very friendly and informative.  They can tell you all of the tourist places to go as well as the little, cool spots you might like.  You have a huge bathroom all to yourself.  The wifi is super fast.  It was a great experience!  When I come back to Seattle, I will definitely be staying here again."
2112625,11443339,2014-04-02,13642831,Michael,"We stayed at Townhouse for three nights, a perfect townhouse indeed! The room was very comfortable, we had our own bathroom and access to the lovely open plan kitchen and living room. Abe, Leah and Job were all very welcoming and friendly, with good tips on restaurants and events around town. They even cooked an amazing dinner for us on our last evening there! We would highly recommend staying at this wonderful Townhouse if you're ever in Seattle and you want a relaxed atmosphere and friendly hosts. "
2112625,11594548,2014-04-08,13137452,Marilyn,"Abe, Leah And Job were very nice, polite and helpful hosts. The accommodations were cozy and very private. I appreciated that Abe sensed my apprehensiveness and called to check on me while I was there. He wasn't a bother, just concerned. He did all he could to be certain all my needs were met and my questions were answered. Thanks! It was a pleasurable experience."
2112625,12106390,2014-04-22,12303576,Pedro,"So, you know when you stay at a  friend´s house and after the stay you leave a few bucks to help´em out with the expenses ?  Well, this is how you´ll probably feel at Abe & Leah´s house.
A really nice house, definitely well located ( just a little far from the city if you are not driving but sure thing is walkable ) and a great environment. The room ain´t big but since you are  in Seattle with so many things to do, all you´ll need is a comfortable bed by the end of the day, and they provide it fore sure, and also a private bathroom.
 They also provide all the things needed for a breakfast but as in a friend´s house, as I said,you gotta go ahead and fix it yourself. 
 Aside all of it, Leah and Abe were awesome.very supportive and since we have something in common (love for soccer ) we had lots of things to chit chat about...
 Making long story short, I totally recommend Abe´s place and for sure it will be my place on my next trip to Seattle."
2112625,13618234,2014-06-01,14805920,George,"I couldn't recommend staying with Abe any more highly. Along with his housemates and friends he made me feel instantly welcome and made every effort to get me included whenever he could. He made me feel instantly at home in Seattle, a city i have never visited before. The house is exactly as pictured, modern, comfortable and has everything you need. I would love to have stayed there longer. "
2112625,16767590,2014-08-02,14125635,Andee,"My hosts were the best! They were super friendly and made my 10 weeks in Seattle amazing. The place was great. I love that I had my own room and bathroom on my own floor. Leah, Job and Abe always invited me out to events and I got to make lots of new friends. Even if you aren't looking to be social and go out in Seattle, they are great to talk to and hangout/study in the living room with. "
2112625,19642036,2014-09-15,6264114,Jenny,"Nice and clean, love the neighborhood :)"
2112625,20062443,2014-09-22,21009240,Lambert (Bert),The room was as described and Leah was very friendly spending some extra time visiting with me.  I would definitely stay here again when coming to Seattle. 
2112625,21039509,2014-10-10,7980715,Josh,"We had an amazing stay in Seattle! The room was just what we needed! It's clean and comfy and the private bathroom was great. Using the kitchen was a breeze and we felt like we were right at home. Leah gave us lots of great tips on places to see and eat out. This place is perfect if you're renting a car.   Taking the bus is not bad either although they came less frequently than we would hope at various times.

Overall we would definitely recommend staying here if you are planning a trip to the area!!! Pleasant travels to all :)"
2112625,42815443,2015-08-16,21854170,Duncan,"Abe & Co. were exemplary hosts. They made my stay in Seattle fundamentally more enjoyable and meaningful. It wouldn't have been the same without them. 

There were abundant opportunities for good conversation, food, drink, and activities. My room was simple, comfortable, and well appointed. Public transit is close and there are multiple grocery stores within walking distance."
2112625,43423594,2015-08-19,36383060,Jamo,The house is amazing! The area is beautiful and convenient. The room is on the first floor which also has own restroom. It's just like you own an separate apartment. And the living room is upstairs which is also pretty. And the hosts are incredibly amazing. We have already became good friends. They took me to a cool bar and we went to karaoke together. Such a great experience. 
2112625,43823773,2015-08-22,13580540,Alberto,Abe and his two roommates are just great. Very welcoming and always willing to help and give suggestions on what to do in town.
2112625,47624066,2015-09-21,22666534,Kendall,Great place to stay! Abe and his roommates were very accommodating and made me feel very welcome. Abe also has great knowledge of Seattle and was great at recommending things to do in the city. The house is also very conveniently located to a bus the runs right downtown. I had a great time staying with Abe and highly recommend staying with him.
2112625,52077608,2015-10-26,29606200,Evana,"I had the pleasure of staying here for 6 weeks. By far the best airbnb experience I've ever had. Abe, Leah and Amy were super friendly, accommodating, respectful and made me feel at home since day one. I became friends with them and for sure planing to come back next time I'm in Seattle. The one bedroom one bath is clean, spacious and comes with all the amenities needed."
2112625,57012832,2015-12-21,17263921,Joseph,"Abe's townhouse in Leschi has been a fantastic place to call home for the past couple months. Abe and his roommates have been extremely gracious, helpful and fun hosts - offering up plenty of recommendations and also inviting me to join them for house dinners, hangouts, etc. The house itself is comfortable and nicely furnished with many opportunities for interaction with the housemates but also a nice space to call your own during your stay. The location in Leschi was good for my weekday commutes to Bellevue as well as evening/weekend trips around Seattle (many bus lines nearby and parking is a breeze). Highly recommended. Many thanks again Abe!  "
7585688,40414615,2015-07-30,39862923,Eric,"Clean and comfortable, two blocks away from the train, tucked away.  Pretty close to downtown.  Erik is a friendly and hospitable.  Mahalo"
7585688,40869524,2015-08-02,28307792,Katie,"Erik was a great host in a convenient up and coming area of Seattle. He was able to help us out in a bind too. We were able to ride the Link Light Rail easily from downtown. We didn't have a vehicle during our trip, but there many surrounding stores and places to eat recommended by Erik within walking distance. Erik was absolutely wonderful. He gave us as much privacy as we would like, and yet was social and accommodating as well. Not to mention - he is one of the most interesting people that I have ever met. The accommodations are comfortable, and the bathtub was absolutely delightful. Erik's back yard is filled with fruit trees and an herb garden. He lives in a cottage behind the property so he's easy to access if need be. If I come through Seattle again, I absolutely would stay with Erik again. Highly recommended! "
7585688,41853581,2015-08-09,39805537,Fabio,"As a host Erik was great and did everything he could to make me feel comfortable, including opening the door at 2:00am after a delay at the airport and making sure there were always something to eat (even though it wasn't on the agreement). Erik has also lived at many places and speaks a few different languages, which makes him the perfect host to have pleasurable conversations.
The place is indeed peaceful, generally well looked after and very close to the tram station, yet it lacks a few details to make it truly comfortable, which Erik mentioned he will take care of very soon."
7585688,42199702,2015-08-11,39848976,Chris,Erik was waiting on us outside the property when we arrived and made it feel like home right from the get go. The property was very unique and welcoming. The inside was very clean and organized. The neighborhood seemed to be very safe and the metro rail was only a short 5 minute walk away. Will definitely book with Erik next visit to Seattle! 
7585688,42943394,2015-08-16,40221356,Karen,"My husband and I were traveling to Seattle then departing on a cruise and needed something close to Pier 66. This place is about 5 mi from the pier, Pike Place Market, Space Needle, and more. It's walking distance from the Link Light Rail -- very convenient! Erik's place is a multi-unit home with eclectic decor. We stayed downstairs in one of two bedrooms separated by the kitchen and living area. The bathroom is shared by the guests. We walked through the kitchen and living room to get to the bathroom. Erik was very gracious! He offered us the use of his washer and dryer which was very welcome as we had been on the road for a week. It's located in a safe neighborhood and a quiet place to stay. He was very engaging and provided us with good tips and info about the area. We met a nice  couple staying there that evening. "
7585688,44949804,2015-08-30,37998678,Katy,"We had just moved to Seattle and needed a place to stay and Erik was extremely accommodating. His place is so nice and has an excellent kitchen where we cooked many of our meals. All the fresh pears and plums from his fruit trees was a great bonus. He had great coffee and food recommendations and we were able to get to know the area, couldn't have asked for a better air bnb!! Thanks Erik!!"
7585688,45154157,2015-08-31,13684709,Gwen,"Eric hosts a great place to stay in Seattle! We arrived very early and he was so gracious about it, made us comfortable right away. Would definitely stay at Eric's again. Also, very close to the train station so you can get around quick."
7585688,45340476,2015-09-01,42524604,Elizabeth,"I needed a place to spend a quiet night between two long days of driving.  Erik's place was perfect.  I arrived in the late evening, just as Erik was returning from a grocery run.  He greeted me and guided me into my parking spot (there's plenty of parking) -- just what I needed after 14 hours of driving.  The vibe is very homey and communal -- Erik is really a gifted host.  He made sure I was fed and comfortable.  I went right to bed since I needed to get up early  and go -- I slept great, my room was comfortable and everything was nice."
7585688,45894389,2015-09-06,43095659,Dylan,"We were made feel extremely welcome. It was pretty much like staying in a friend's house. Erik gave us a great deal of advice on where to go in Seattle which was great. He even made a great breakfast on our last morning. The neighborhood was great, very close to the city center. The house was great and had a really friendly dog who made the stay even better."
7585688,46413757,2015-09-10,14293426,Polly,Erik's Airbnb was great. Erik was there when we checked in and was very friendly during our entire stay. He was also very gracious and let us use his kitchen. We were exploring Seattle for the first time and it was nice to come back to La Guarida after a day of activities. The neighborhood is extremely safe and peaceful and his place is conveniently located close to the LINK as well as nearby buses. Would definitely book this place next time we're in Seattle! 
7585688,46929365,2015-09-14,39991106,Christopher,The room and layout were exactly as described and Erik was very friendly and patient.
7585688,47579575,2015-09-20,19620261,Lucas,"La Guarida is a great place to stay, very comfortable and easily accesible from all the main areas of Seattle. The train station is literally within 3 minutes from the house. The room is awesome, and Erik is really helpful and informative. He left some maps and tips for places to go around the city and Gustavo (the dog) is lovely. We'd definitely want to come back if we ever return to Seattle."
7585688,48012626,2015-09-22,33662835,Tatiana,"We stayed at Erik´s place for three nights and we had a really great time there. The room was nice and clean. The place itself is very warm and we felt like at home. Erik is very nice and hospitable. He came to pick us up at the railway station in the middle of the night. He gave us some tips where to go, which restaurants to visit etc. The house is 3 mins walking from the light rail station. There is direct connection from Erik´s place to both airport and city center. :)"
7585688,48364183,2015-09-25,1794476,Tristan,An amazing experience and very nice place. Erik was a great host and very hospitable. Would return. 
7585688,48727930,2015-09-28,20001299,James,"Great host, very welcoming, did not see a lot of Erik after my initial check in but found him to be very friendly and helpful"
7585688,48966612,2015-09-29,43174993,Praveen,"Erik is an awesome host. He was waiting to greet us and made us feel home the moment we walked in. He gave us a tour of his beautiful home, offered a beverage and made us very comfortable. The room was very spacious and his kitchen reminds me of a Hibachi. Erik is a great guy to hang out with. He had a few maps, recommendations on a few restaurants, grocery stores around the house which was convenient. He has a wonderful garden and he offered to pick the veggies and herbs for breakfast and my wife made the organic omelette with eggs. He also provided a lot of tips to travel around the city. If I come back to Seattle, I'm staying at Erik's."
7585688,49087533,2015-09-30,45321286,Paul,"Great place to stay, incredible kitchen and deck. Wonderful place with a nice individual touch."
7585688,49674189,2015-10-05,14095277,Michelle,"Erik's space is absolutely gorgeous! We unfortuantely were not able to stay at his space very long, but we had a really nice time while we were there. Erik has some GREAT recommendations of what to check out nearby. The space itself was super clean and welcoming. The bathroom is absolutely gorgeous (don't think I've ever written that on an Air BnB review before! :D ) and everything is just perfect. Be sure to watch the sunrise on the deck if you are East Coasters like us and will be awake in time for it. Overall, an awesome place with great location. Will hopefully be back again!"
7585688,53365819,2015-11-08,46417484,Natalie,Erik is a great host. He let me drop off my luggage hours before the check in time. His house is beautiful and in a great location. The room is perfect. Comfortable bed and spacious closet. The bathroom is very artistically unique and beautiful. For my first time using airbnb I had a good experience.
7585688,54064612,2015-11-15,7998333,Alexis,"This is a very nice and lovely  place to stay, close to downtonw. It was a pleasure to meet and discuss with Éric."
7585688,54183285,2015-11-16,6274818,Kelly,"Great place! Seems remote as tucked away in wooded area but so close to transit and a really homely/natural feel. Off street parking and a friendly pooch Gustavo welcome!
Loved the wood and tile work and bed was the best I've ever slept in! Fresh cozy flannelette sheets and KING size - perfect for recharging!
Erik very friendly and helpful with information. Printed info for local eats and treats and city info tweaked to our likes and intentions. 
Shame we had only one night but the later check out meant a nice relaxing departure.
Thanks Erik!"
7585688,56923252,2015-12-20,35162531,Taylor,"We arrived late and left early, but this was a nice place to crash for the night. The bathroom and shower were really great, especially after a whole day of being on a plane. We never saw Erik or the dog, but we could hear the footsteps when they got home. That was the only downside to our stay. So if you're a lighter sleeper, I might suggest earplugs. Overall, it was a great room. We really liked The Station's coffee too. Thanks for the recommendation, Erik! "
3961077,19179581,2014-09-07,5515208,Mark,Friendly and resourceful host. Lots of intriguing knick-knacks to look at from her many trips. Very pleasant neighbourhood. Recommended!
3961077,19991059,2014-09-21,17487853,Gene,I had a nice time. Deb is welcoming and friendly. There were friendly people having dinner together when I arrived. It was like staying with friends
3961077,20213261,2014-09-25,20089921,Casey,"Deb was a decent host. Our room had everything provided and the use of the kitchen was really helpful. Safe neighborhood and we really enjoyed leaving the windows open at night as we slept, but even with the windows closed you could hear some random instruments/band(?) playing almost every night until 10:30 or so which was quite frustrating. "
3961077,24576684,2014-12-30,24719128,Justin,"Neighborhood was nice, no trouble with parking. Deb was pleasant and the space was nice. 

Bed had a heating pad which was quite nice. Decent shower too. 

Would definitely stay again."
3961077,25778844,2015-01-25,26440181,Tariq,"Deb was very helpful with advice about the area. She was hospitable and the neighborhood was safe. The house and bedroom has lots of character. The bathroom is shared between three people, which was not an issue. I enjoyed my stay and Deb was great. I was initially concerned with the temperature of the room, but the heating pad for the bed eased my worries. I would recommend this location if you need a place to crash for a couple of nights.  "
3961077,29896897,2015-04-13,26491021,Phil,"Great room in a great neighborhood! Deb is a friendly, considerate host and the house is charming, warm and full of art. Highly recommended."
3961077,30266047,2015-04-19,12843911,Katty,"Deb is a super sweet, friendly and accommodating host. I live in U district, but just needed a place to stay for the night because my mom flew in on a Saturday night and my housemates were throwing a party at ours that very same day. Deb had to be elsewhere that weekend, so I picked up the house key from her on Thurs, and she kindly walked me through anything I needed to know about the place - heater, room, bathroom, kitchen, etc. The house is very cozy, and is decorated with a lot of interesting ornaments. Posters on the wall were interesting to look at too! The house gets a lot of sunlight in the morning, and the garden is very neat and cute - definitely makes breakfast more enjoyable. 
The room looks exactly like shown in the picture - p.s the bed is super comfy!!!  Deb also provided towels and extra blankets if you need them. And there is also a heated mattress. I enjoyed my stay a lot and would highly recommend this place to anyone. Deb is also super responsive to her text msgs and emails if you have any queries. It was a pity that my stay was short and didn't get to see her much. But our short exchange was enough to prove her awesome personality. If you are thinking of a short-term stay, I am sure Deb and her place will provide you with the best experience! "
3961077,35532642,2015-06-19,27333496,Rachel,"Deb was very friendly and laid back, and welcomed me into her home! The room was clean and the neighborhood felt safe. I enjoyed my stay."
3961077,36606000,2015-06-29,35970200,Trevor,This is a great room in a nice area and perfect for our weekend stay in Seattle.  Deb is clearly an experienced host and did a great job.
3961077,38797627,2015-07-18,38044589,Sebastian,Very much enjoyed our stay at Deb's place! Deb is quite a professional host and a very warm and welcoming person at the same time. She was very helpful and gave us great tips for our visit to Seattle. The whole house is so charming and has alot of character. The room was also great! Would stay here again any time!
3961077,40416175,2015-07-30,13775192,Samantha,Deb's home was very cozy and conveniently located. Her house has a lot of PNW character. The room was tidy and the neighborhood was lovely.
3961077,41194759,2015-08-05,225830,Lee & Steve,Deb is great!!!!! Our family members enjoyed her house and hospitality.....we recommend her house!!!

3961077,44070219,2015-08-23,9823290,James,"Deb is a very generous host with a fantastic house. Seattle can be kind of tough to navigate for a tourist but Deb's insight really helped. She helped us get Mariners tickets, treated us to cookies(!) and gave us lots of local knowledge. The bed is lovely."
3961077,49574813,2015-10-04,45474977,Rob,"Deb is a great host! The room is very comfortable. The house is very quiet and the neighborhood extremely quiet. Yet there are groceries and coffee within a few blocks by foot. It is easy to get to the U, even Ballard  and neighborhoods South over local routes. Thanks Deb!"
3961077,51246705,2015-10-18,34699619,Ryan,"Deb was an incredible host! Very personable and welcoming when I first arrived. The ambiance of the house reflects her great personality! I like to sleep cold, however, she even had the option of a heated pad on the bed and extra wool blankets for those of you who prefer it a bit warmer. She was very knowledgeable of the surrounding area regarding places to eat and for outdoor recreation. The location and neighborhood was great and walking distance from plenty of areas to dine and explore. I would highly recommend staying with Deb if you are considering visiting the area. I will be sure to pass this spot on to my friends and family! "
3961077,52806080,2015-11-01,44207173,Lauren,"Though I never got to formally meet the host, the house was lovely and she was very accommodating. "
3961077,53237183,2015-11-06,48262698,Kathleen,"Deb was a lovely host -- I felt right at home and very comfortable in the space.  The general feeling was staying at a friend's home, in an older neighborhood.  Perfect for me."
9957555,57093878,2015-12-21,15219821,Allison,"E.J.'s Central Seattle home is a bargain for its quality! We were greeted by a lovely, clean home just as pictured with extra amenities of first aid kits, cleaning material, laundry and wonderful four-ply toliet paper. There was a ton of space for four people and the home would comfortably fit a family of over four people as we felt we had a ton of extra space all weekend. There were a ton of restaurants and bars in the area that we walked to and ordered delivery from. Downtown and Cap Hill were 5-10 minutes away and we took in the location for some great tourism. E.J. was professional and flexible when we got stuck in traffic trying to meet up for the key hand off. I recommend this home highly for it's size, location, and flexible host. And, again. Four. Ply. Toliet. Paper. Recommended!!!



All you really need to know is the home is equipped with super high quality, four-ply toliet paper. That little fact should speak to the quality of the rest of the home. "
9957555,57402989,2015-12-25,11164883,Andrew,"EJ was a great host. Helpful, responsive, and accommodating. The house was cozy and very comfortable. Couldn't have asked for a better experience in a better location. "
8186781,46653793,2015-09-12,42308103,Jza,"We rented this house when my boyfriend'a parents were visiting us.  We were able to make dinner and relax.  The house is really lovely, with front and back yards.  The location is perfect for exploring Capitol Hill.  Wahzma was really nice and quick to respond to my questions.  I would stay-cation here again!"
8186781,46982876,2015-09-14,3382272,Lisa,"The house is a 1904 home with nice light a yard. The parking is in the back and has a gate and parks two car inline.  We came to go to the Huskies game and go down town, so you can't beat the location. It is a busy neighborhood and the are many people out walking and being a little on Friday and Saturday, as our hostess said. Wazhma was very flexible with the arrival and leaving times and wonderful to meet. "
8186781,47543902,2015-09-20,4844273,Seth,This home is darling! Best location possible in Capitol Hill. Most accommodating host literally ever too. Thank you!

If you need a cute place to stay on capital hill this is a great find! "
8186781,49062355,2015-09-30,44742191,Diane,"Wazhma's house was truly charming and she was a wonderful host. The kitchen is modern and clean and contains everything you could need for comfortably dining in. The bathrooms were well stocked with towels and toiletries and the shower was strong and had plenty of hot water. The house has private, gated parking in the back of the house, which is a huge plus as parking in the neighborhood is challenging. And once parked, everything you need is within easy walking distance. We were just 2 blocks from my daughters dorm at Seattle University and we really enjoyed having a house in such close proximity to her. Overall, a wonderful house where I hope I can stay again on our next visit to Seattle. "
8186781,49687426,2015-10-05,15540475,Christie,"Our host Wazhma was great. She met us at the house and made sure we had everything we needed. The house was as described, very conveniently located and plenty spacious for our group of three. "

8186781,52506970,2015-10-30,16209577,Nicolas,"I had a very pleasant stay at Wazhma's place.
The house is perfectly located in Capitol Hill, one of the most trendy and living neighborhood in Seattle.
You immediately feel at home in that house and you appreciate spend some time in the backyard garden (a squirrel was living there).
The house is spacious, cozy and calm, with all equipment needed.
A place I would recommend if you have to visit Seattle.  "
8186781,53528914,2015-11-09,6857642,Julien,Whazma's house was perfect for us. It's very spacious with 2 bedrooms upstairs and a large living area downstairs. Great location in capital hill with lots of good restaurants and bars nearby. Whazima was a great host and gave us several suggestions nearby.  I'd absolutely stay again next time I'm in Seattle.
8186781,53936728,2015-11-14,8820568,Sandra,"The home was comfortable and very will situated for our needs.

We had some issues with my mothers health and Wazhma was very accommodating.    I would stay here again."
8186781,54556779,2015-11-21,12153725,New,"Wazhma wad a great host. She made accommodations for me and my party due to a late arrival.  If I had any questions,  she was readily available to answer them. The home was just a described, very spacious and welcoming!  I would suggest this host and this location any day. The home was close to all major attractions (about a 5 to 10 minute drive to all Seattle has to offer.  If you book with her expect a great stay!!!"
8186781,54914534,2015-11-25,6288029,Justin,House was great and location was perfect. Being a few blocks from Skillet may have been the best.
8186781,57154518,2015-12-22,7723154,Brookes,Very nice home in a great location. We very much enjoyed our stay. 
7544337,42033085,2015-08-10,334780,Stephen,"Pros:
* Location: The apartment is truly in the heart of Belltown, a great and lively neighborhood with lots to do. Also, it's very close to downtown (Pike Place market, etc.).
* Functional: It's a full apartment (kitchen, bath, bedroom, etc.), so you can get all your normal home-stuff done.
* Windows: Belltown, and 4th ave in particular, can be lively / noisy. The windows are super insane noise-shielders. When they're closed, you have no idea there's anyone out there.
* Decor: The apartment has personality!
* Host: Aaron is a greta host. He responds to questions immediately and clearly. He responded to basic service requests (e.g.: ironing board) very quickly. Check-in and check-out were quick and efficient.
* WiFi: Top-notch: Fast and reliable!
* Coffee: The apartment offers excellent coffee & coffee maker. Much appreciated :)

Cons:
* Size: It's a small apartment (studio). Best if you're spending most of your time out in the city.
* Amenities: The apartment lacks AC and TV (if that's your thing)."

I arrived late at night and so was unable to meet him in person, but the check in and check out process went smoothly. The apartment was great for my needs, and he even provided coffee! The location in Belltown was great, I would stay here again. "
7544337,46167052,2015-09-08,875499,Yumi,"It's a cute, artsy place, very feminine. Lots of cat-related things, which are a plus for a cat-lover :-) Delaney left a very nice memo on the coffee table welcoming me to her place, letting me know the wifi code, etc. The room is on the first floor right on the sidewalk so I preferred to have the curtains closed... the room is really nice with the soft light at night but a bit too dark during the daytime, which should be fine if you plan to be out and about anyway during the day. I was a bit worried about the noise from the street, but it actually wasn't a problem at all, as it was pretty quiet in the neighborhood at night. Bed is pretty comfy! The location is pretty convenient, walking distance to just about anything you might need (a small supermarket, cafes and restaurants, downtown, etc). "
7544337,50115228,2015-10-09,6879390,Pere,Nice apartment in a perfect place. Nearly of all. Also a very confortable home. Aaron is very atentive and nice. He took me a phone adapter plug late at night.

8594717,50982640,2015-10-16,38609134,Tannen,"Duncan was a wonderful host! He is super nice, and the apartment was very charming. He also provided a list of great local restaurants and bars which was helpful since this was my first time in Seattle. "

8594717,52170635,2015-10-26,18550347,Steph,"Duncan was very accommodating. He even allowed us to store our luggage after checking out while we explored the city some more before heading to the airport. The place is nice overall and has everything that you could need. Good location too, walking distance to a lot of bars and restaurants. "
8594717,52372451,2015-10-28,31085903,Florian,"Duncan was a great host. He was very communicative and provides us with all information we need. The apartment was spacious and perfectly (email hidden)wntown is in walking distance, but there are also plenty of bars, restaurants etc. in the surrounding area. Great place to stay and to explore Seattle. Highly recommended!"

I would definitely recommend this place to anyone interested in staying somewhere close enough to literally everything! Once again, thanks Duncan I will definitely be staying their again."

8594717,54299595,2015-11-17,20743558,Susie,"This was a fun little area of Seattle. Much to do within walking distance. Directions were clear but parking is first come, first serve street parking. The apartment is small but cute. Not sound-proof or heating, but wasn't a concern for us. This apartment doesn't have a view because it's on the 1st floor. Didn't actually meet Duncan, but he made access in and out vey easy. Would definitely consider staying here again when in Seattle. "
8594717,54660463,2015-11-22,39042996,Angela,"Duncan was amazing and very accommodating! Very flexible with check-in and out times due to changes in our schedule- which we appreciate SO much! Apartment was cozy and in a perfect location- close walking distance to restaurants and bars. Parking was difficult but to be expected in a city on the weekend. Apartment was overall clean, could use a dusting but we were beyond satisfied!"
8594717,54887748,2015-11-25,38805050,Sabina,"This was a lovely place to stay at with my husband and two children. The apartment was in the best location. It seemed to be in a safe neighborhood, it was by a nice park, and was only a couple blocks from Broadway (where all the action was). The apartment was great and Duncan was a very accommodating host! Overall it was a great place and I would definetly recommend it!"
8594717,55145818,2015-11-28,28027937,Jaime,"Great apartment in a fantastic neighborhood. Had a great time, place was very clean and welcoming. "
8594717,55402400,2015-12-01,34361717,Pat N Mary,"This place was great!! Great location, nice neighborhood. Comfortable bed. I tried to book it for our January trip, but it's booked :-(   Duncan was very nice and so easy to work with. The chocolate on the pillow was a nice touch... :-) 
We wouldn't hesitate to stay there again."
8594717,55968436,2015-12-07,45741506,Kristin,"Duncan was a great host. We got in late at night and he was easily able to accommodate us. The apartment was perfect-with the exception of missing a wine bottle opener. Don't worry, we fixed that for those of you who follow! Otherwise we can't say enough good things about our experience with the rental. "
8594717,56276542,2015-12-11,756330,Erin,Duncan was a great host and super flexible with our schedule! Unit was a pictured and described. Great location in the Capitol Hill neighborhood - no need for a car at this location! 
8594717,57211243,2015-12-23,36586925,Michael,"Duncan was a fantastic host. He gave us total privacy, but was never out of reach. He even allowed us a late check out, which gave us a little more freedom to make the most of our last day in Seattle before our evening flights. The apartment was ideal in every way: location, size, amenities, dishes and silverware, heat, and even decor. Everything was in walking distance. My friends and I agree: we would happily stay here for our next visit to Seattle."
5913611,29716747,2015-04-11,7224403,Fiona,"Chris was a wonderful host. The place is incredibly well-located for wandering through Pike's Place Market (and a very short walk from the train station), but is also pleasant to just spend time in -- the view is beautiful. "
5913611,29796639,2015-04-12,7757429,Ben,"Great location, great guy, great stay! Checking in and leaving were both seamless. If you're looking for a beautiful place in downtown Seattle, look no further."

5913611,30729631,2015-04-26,24587781,Mengfei,"Chris was an excellent host! He made the studio very cozy, with little lights on the windows. It was also such a good location, very convenient since it was just a tiny walk to the link station to take to the airport. The check in and check out experience was very easy! "
5913611,31231696,2015-05-03,2659179,Edith,"Well located, really sunny apartment! Chris was really nice with our early check in! "
5913611,31803560,2015-05-10,17649569,Lauren,Unbelievable location! Chris was so awesome and accommodating when our plans changed and we arrived earlier than expected. Perfect place to stay for the baseball game and patio hopping.
5913611,34839799,2015-06-12,1703074,Martin,"Great location in downtown Seattle, 2 blocks from the water and 1 block from the Link Lite rail which will take you most place through out Seattle.  Everything is as described and very clean.  Excellent communication and Chris is very helpfull."
5913611,35721557,2015-06-21,35151553,Becca,"Good location, nice little spot, no complaints!"
5913611,35967394,2015-06-23,4532653,Rebecca,"The apartment was charming, efficiently organized, and centrally located, with a GREAT view. Further, Chris was a delight—communicative, friendly, helpful. An ideal AirBNB experience!"
5913611,36894907,2015-07-02,7206136,Joshua,Chris is a great host and the apartment is very convenient for everything in downtown Seattle. He met us when we arrived (with great advice to take the Light Rail which stops 2 blocks from his apt) and had good recommendations for food in the area. We stayed for one night since we were just on our way to Olympic National Park. The apartment is very spacious. I would definitely recommend this for anyone visiting Seattle. Thanks Chris!
5913611,36992620,2015-07-03,3451517,Joanna,"Chris's place was great - really central, convenient, and cozy, with everything you need for a stay. We had a late flight in from NYC that ended up being delayed even further, and Chris was amazingly accomodating with our middle of the night check-in."
1009838,5202977,2013-06-17,2851019,Ed,Denise provided An exceptional BnB experience. A private bathroom and a private entrance. Comfortable bed in room large enough to provide a comfy sofa as well. To top it off Denise fired up the Hot Tub for me. Great location next to park and Lake Washington. 
1009838,5352945,2013-06-25,2110845,Cathy,"Denise was a lovely host, cheerful and attentive to my needs. The room is delightful and felt like a suite, with a large screen television and a sofa. Overall a very comfortable place to stay and I hope to return."
1009838,5496403,2013-07-02,308046,Keith,"Denise was a cheerful and considerate host. The private room (couch, large television, grooming desk and dresser) and bathroom (shower, sink, toilet, vent) are both connected to Denise's office. They are all on the lower level of a charming bungalow with lots of plants around it. 

You are given a key to enter via her vegetable garden at the back of the house. There's some steps to access the back which require some care to navigate, especially in the dark. I found the bed to be comfortable, but a touch short for my 5'10 frame. Seattle was having a heat wave and it was difficult to sleep until late in the night when things had cooled off outdoors. Denise kept the doors and windows open for air flow. 

She was a good guide for the neighbourhood and very easy to connect with. She was attentive and available the whole weekend that I stayed. She left me some snacks and water and always kept a light on for my after-dark arrivals. I was happy to enjoy fresh raspberries straight off the bush in her garden right after I first arrived. 

My trip down from Vancouver was beset by all sorts of difficulties, but Denise rolled with all the changes like a champ and was immediately responsive to all my communications.
"
1009838,5989252,2013-07-25,7219778,Aaron,"I moved to Seattle for a new job, and the apartment I had lined up to rent wasn't going to be ready for ~3 weeks after I started. So I wound up staying with Denise during that time. 

The room is on the lower level of the house, with access from the backyard. There are some steps to get from the front to the backyard, but they can be a little tricky to negotiate. The room is quite spacious, with a comfortable bed and plenty of space. 

Denise and her son are quite wonderful people, who respected my privacy but were also inviting whenever I had a question about the Seattle, the neighborhood, whatever. 

I would happily recommend Denise. "
1009838,6673279,2013-08-20,8034601,Jian Yang,"I had a very pleasant stay at Denise's place. The room was very big and she was super helpful and accommodating. Her place was also very convenient since it is only a 10 minute walk to the nearby shops. I would highly recommend staying at her place if you are visiting Seattle.
"
1009838,6772746,2013-08-24,7157772,Lauren,"This was our first airbnb experience and, honestly, probably all others will be a bit of a let down after staying at Denise's. The room was extremely spacious and very comfortable. Denise provided us with snacks, shampoo, soap, etc. and even included laundry detergent that we used to wash our clothes with the w&d right by our room- super awesome for ppl who've been on the road awhile. 
As for Denise, we probably had even more fun just hanging out with her than we did exploring Seattle. She was super respectful of privacy, but very friendly and outgoing as well- we ended up going out to eat with her and having coffee in te mornings. 

Seattle is an awesome city, and Denise is an even more awesome host. We can't wait to go back and see our new friend in Seattle! "
1009838,7045494,2013-09-04,7645758,Brian,"Denise and her son were both fantastic hosts, and super pleasant to stay with! They even had fresh coffee available every morning! The room was nice, big, and clean, and the location of the apartment was in a pleasant area with super easy bus access to downtown Seattle. I would definitely stay with them again in Seattle!"
1009838,7210496,2013-09-10,8573795,Rebecca,"My husband and I had a wonderful time staying with Denise. She was friendly, helpful, and very hospitable. We would definitely stay with her again if the need ever arose and would recommend her to others looking for a place to stay. "
1009838,7450554,2013-09-20,8784618,Richard,"Denise provided a comfortable space with all needed amenities and was a wonderful host.  She makes a ""mean"" cup of pressed coffee and has a delightful attitude with good conversation.  The location is very convenient and in a quite neighborhood; your stay with her will be enjoyable!"
1009838,7544528,2013-09-23,8054488,Audrey,"I needed a space as a last minute decision on a busy Saturday night, and ending up here was no mistake.  I was replied to instantly on my request. Denise waited for us to show up,and everything was ready.  The shower is great, and the morning coffee and chat was even better.  I'd be back!"
1009838,7662445,2013-09-28,4586457,Matthias,"Denise was an excellent host. I had to find accommodation for one night on a whim and she responded quickly and was fine with my arrival after midnight. The bedroom and bathroom are spacious and clean. They are located in the basement of the house, however, the bedroom windows open to the backyard (the house sits on a slope). Overall I had a pleasant short stay."
1009838,11193300,2014-03-24,191320,Hadi,I had excellent time at Denise's house. The transportation to downtown was smooth as soon as I learned the train and busses. We also had wonderful conversation about life at Seattle. I definitely suggest this place.
1009838,11420055,2014-04-01,13196444,Kyle,My stay was great. The room was comfortable and the internet fast. It was my first time using the service and it could not have gone better. 
1009838,12317717,2014-04-28,14566212,Alicia,"It was lovely to stay with Denise. She is friendly, respectful of her guests needs, and lives in one of the most beautiful spots in Seattle- runs on lake Washington are spectacular! Thanks Denise!"
1009838,12903335,2014-05-13,2542378,J.R.,"Denise has the most comfortable bed in the world. I didn't want to get up in the morning, except her house is so close to Lake Washington, I knew I would regret not getting up to walk to Seward Park if I stayed in bed. Really great location, right off a Genessee Park and Lake Washington Boulevard, about a 20-minute walk to Flying Squirrel Pizza. Comfortable room with a couch, incredibly easy to reach I-90 and/or I-5 from here. Denise responded quickly to my e-mail query upon arrival. Great stay!"
1009838,13172539,2014-05-20,513673,George,The reservation was canceled the day before arrival. This is an automated posting.
1009838,14353802,2014-06-17,11543744,Markus,"Nice place to be, quiet and close to the lake (perfect for running). Denise was always very helpful too. "
1009838,14581393,2014-06-22,15744270,Xinyang,"Denise's place is really great, with nice neighborhood and comfortable room. She prepares everything to make it feels like home (and it does!).  There's a Safeway 10-min walk away so it's also quite convenient if you are buying food or something. First time using airbnb and I am more than satisfied. Will definitely stay at her place again if coming to Seattle (well actually is coming back in a week : P)"
1009838,14990303,2014-06-30,16634403,Lane,"My son found this Airbnb listing for me. I wanted a room close to his home since there were no hotels close by. The owner, Denise was there to greet me and show me to my room and bathroom. Her home, yard and my room were all beautiful and private. She left maps and reading material for me and was very helpful in telling me how to get places. She made me tea in the morning and we talked a lot throughout the week becoming friends. She was a wonderful hostess."
1009838,15150170,2014-07-03,15744270,Xinyang,"After a week in the east, I returned to Denise's place and still loved it! Definitely want to be here again if I'm visiting the lovely city of Seattle in the future."
1009838,15419183,2014-07-08,2312895,Christine,"Our stay with Denise was very pleasant! She was a very friendly and helpful host; she brought us coffee in the morning and gave us information about the neighborhood and other surrounding areas. The room was clean, comfortable and quiet and her house is located in a very nice part of town. The walk to the bus stop was about 10 min and the bus ride to downtown was about 20 min. "
1009838,15559453,2014-07-11,15550502,Chris,I had a great stay with Denise and her son. She is very welcoming and provides a cozy home environment. I really liked the morning coffee and good chat! Very close to Lake Washington which is great. I am a very satisfied with my stay and recommend it.

Clean bed, clean bathroom, and although not close in to downtown, bus is a ten minute walk away.  "
1009838,17011538,2014-08-05,1969601,Laetitia & Dimitri,"It was even better than expected ! 
Very nice house full of charm in a quiet neighborhood.
Denise was waiting for us until 1:30 am. It was so kind from her. I would have love speaking more with her because she is a very nice and interesting person but we spent the most of our days outside, enjoying this beautiful city !
The room is very well decorated, spacious and super clean. The bathroom is big enough, the shower is great and easy to get warm water in a few seconds, and also, the most important perfectly clean. What is great too is that you are not afraid to bother her too much as she is most of the time living in the floor. You have your own front door entrance. I really appreciated this because you feel more confortable, like in your own little house ;-) Also, there is a beautiful garden and you can sit outside when the weather is nice. If you have a car, this is easy to go everywhere. The house is very good located. So, we had a great stay in Denise's house and we would strongly recommend it to anyone looking for an unforgettable Airbnb experience !"
1009838,17599545,2014-08-14,6641174,Catherine,"Our stay was great! Denise met us at the door to welcome us which was so nice. The room was clean and offered some nice extras such as complimentary waters, apple juice, WiFi etc. It was a perfect location for easy access to downtown. Denise was easy to talk to and very friendly. We had a great stay and would recommend her place to anyone. "
1009838,18539237,2014-08-28,17566264,Peter,"I couldn't have hoped for a more welcoming host, comfortable room, lovely neighborhood or better service.  Denise was delightful, and eager to make my stay perfect.  I'll stay at her B&B whenever I'm in Seattle."
1009838,18685813,2014-08-30,20281943,Krista,"Nice, quiet neighborhood with easy access to public transportation. The room and bathroom were nice and clean and the property itself was lovely. Denise was very friendly and helpful. Would definitely stay there again. Thanks, Denise!"
1009838,18947879,2014-09-03,9952788,Tyler,Denise was a fantastic host. Her home is cozy and nicely located not too far from all of the downtown attractions. I would highly recommend staying with her and taking a walk over to the lake just by her home.
1009838,19299897,2014-09-09,651651,Gary,"Denise's room was cozy and had everything you would need desk, refrigerator, couch, comfty bed. The neighborhood is walkable but hilly.
The bus is not far but Denise took us to PCC Natural next to the bus stop."
1009838,20288185,2014-09-27,19905832,Chris,Accurate description in a nice neighbourhood. Denise was polite and provided all the things I needed for my stay. All of then in the room. Would recommend this place and stay here again
1009838,20718370,2014-10-04,21578005,Graham,Denise was great and the room was nice in a cool part of town.

1009838,26268662,2015-02-08,25555728,Chris,"Denise was a wonderful host. House is pretty clean. Downstairs is clean and out of the way and private. You've even got some essentials when you first arrive. Definitely a good place to stay. 

If you show the cats affection, they will follow you all over. "
1009838,28456691,2015-03-23,1324417,Alana,I had a wonderful stay in Denise's home. She welcomed me and we had a wonderful chat over coffee. The bed was super comfy and the room and bathroom clean and easily accessed day or night. Thank you for a great stay! I would come back!
1009838,29343755,2015-04-06,19905832,Chris,This was my second stay at Denise's place. This time she even accomidated a special request for me. The room is clean and large and Denise was very kind. The place is close to a Safeway and bus stop. Also it is close to lots of other businesses. I would stay here again.
1009838,29536515,2015-04-08,30653262,Niki,"Denise is very sweet and helpful, the room/ bathroom are private and quiet with bonus of small fridge, microwave, and VCR with some old movies. But the listing is misrepresenting : it is a SMOKING home and previous renters have smoked in the bedroom, so everything smells of cigarette smoke. Denise was understanding and very fair in reimbursing me for leaving due to cigarette smoke that permeates this property that was listed as non-smoking. Also, I recommend asking for bedroom key since outside lower level door for renters is not locked and no key was offered. The neighborhood is lovely, quite and safe. It is a perfect rental for a smoker, even if owner prefers that you smoke outside!"
1009838,29960075,2015-04-14,30941668,Mia L,"Our room is nice and quite, with perfect privacy and easy access to the garden. The kitchen and dining space is open and bright with a nice collection of music. Denise is a very warm host, wish we had more time to chat. Parking is easy and lake is within walking distance. "
1009838,30252252,2015-04-19,31001364,Esther,"Denise's welcoming and comfortable hospitality made us feel like we were there visiting a long-time friend. The room we stayed in met all our needs, and had a separate entrance for us to go in and out of the house at any time. The living room space is BEAUTIFUL, and if your up at the right time, you can enjoy it with a cup of Denise's MEAN coffee!  The house is in a safe and quiet neighborhood, with restaurants and markets close by, and downtown only a 15 minute drive away. The lake is a block away, and is great for morning jogs or afternoon picnics. My only regret is not staying longer. Will definitely be back! "
1009838,31276123,2015-05-03,2362562,Rudy,Great room in a great location. Denise was super friendly and professional.
1009838,32858504,2015-05-22,30257136,Jacques,"Denise a produit un accueil chaleureux et elle s'est montré serviable: impression de document, utilisation de ses machines à laver et sécher.
Elle a également fait un effort pour les petits déjeuners, qui n'était  pas demandé.
En revanche la chambre proposée ne correspond pas à la photo, ci-jointe, d'une pièce claire et lumineuse; elle se situait sous celle-ci et était plutôt triste et mal organisée. Coin pour préparer un petit en-cas, manquant de verre, d'assiette, un frigidaire dépourvu de toute étagère à l'intérieur; la salle de bain est très bien. J'avais choisi sur la photo lumineuse, je n'ai pu qu'être désappointé.
La rue est agréable, avec beaucoup d'arbres, un lac tout proche et un parking très facile."
1009838,33141713,2015-05-25,32431720,Ardra,Denise was a very friendly and gracious host. She stayed up late in the night to welcome us as our flight was a little late. She made us breakfast and coffee and made us feel welcome at her place. The location is very close to downtown and was a very quiet neighborhood. The room was kept very clean and we were given full privacy. Both me and my husband really enjoyed our stay at Denise's.
1009838,33733217,2015-05-31,22134786,Adam,"The listing was just as described. Denise is social, friendly and entertaining. Her place is located just outside the downtown area of Seattle and a few blocks away from the lake. Beautiful and quiet neighborhood."
1009838,35120848,2015-06-15,8689560,Noki,"We were first time airbnb renters, and we could not have chosen a better place to stay. Denise is a great host and she is good with kids. My 3-year-old daughter loves her. They enjoyed gardening and dancing together. The lake is close by -- great for morning jogs to Seward Park. And, the hot tub was awesome. Fire up the grill, pour yourself a glass of wine, and relax in the bubble-jet hot tub -- great way to end the day... We had a wonderful time. We will come back. Thank you, Denise!!"
1009838,36893599,2015-07-02,34876609,Colin,"Great place to stay . Great location .  Easy to get around to any part of Seattle , within walking to the lake and park .  Enjoyed my stay .  Denise is very nice and accommodating.  "
1009838,37775347,2015-07-10,34614112,Paul,The place was quite comfortable and relaxed.
1009838,38818651,2015-07-19,10984579,Paul,"Denise was a wonderful host with a beautiful home on the edge of Lake Washington. Our room was spacious, clean and comfortable with all the amenities you could need. We really enjoyed her lovely garden too.  Excellent location for exploring downtown Seattle and getting to/from the airport.  Highly recommend."
1009838,39528252,2015-07-24,37075307,Xiaoyi,"Ms Denise is such a great host! She kindly picked us up from rail station, showed us around the beautiful, quiet neighborhood on the first day. The house is exactly as showed in the pictures, nicely decorated and very cory. She cooked us breakfast every morning and gave us a lot of advices about traveling in Seattle. We felt like a home away from home. Thank you Ms. Denise for all the help and I'll recommend this place to my friends who will go to Seattle! "
1009838,39790562,2015-07-26,5350578,Sean,"Denise was an excellent host. She met us and made us feel at home right away. The room was cozy and clean and the neighbourhood was nice and friendly. The space has all the amenities that you might need. The hot tub was the best! Great place, wonderful host, I would definitely stay with Denise again! Thank you, Denise."
1009838,40739320,2015-08-02,34047624,Annemarie,We had a wonderful stay at Denise's house.  We were attending Seafair and her house is in the perfect location only one street from the fair.  Denise was very attentive to our of our needs and made sure that we were comfortable.  The weekend was very hot and the house doesn't have AC but there were two fans that we used to cool down the room.  We loved the surrounding area and found two very good restaurants and a wonderful park for our son to play in.   
1009838,41743677,2015-08-09,32456364,Daniel,"Denise is a wonderful host, and the space is as listed - a private room in a nice basement with outside access on the same floor.  The site is well suited to using the metro to get around Seattle - about a five minute walk to the bus lines, and a 15 minute walk from the light rail.  Denise was a great host, and made my first Air BNB experience very pleasant."
1009838,43276465,2015-08-18,39345879,Sarah,The location worked well for renting a car and not staying in the center of the city. We walked to breakfast at the delicious Geraldine's Counter several times. Lake Washington Boulevard is very near by and lovely for walking or running. The downstairs where we stayed was comfortable and the bathroom was clean. The room was a good size and it was very nice to have a little fridge in the room and tea in the office. Denise was very nice. 
1009838,45539686,2015-09-03,10930785,Mayra,Everything was good
1009838,45889364,2015-09-06,43019490,Michele,"We had a great experience with our stay. Denise was not there, but  made sure she had someone and she had Detra stay and host us and she was really sweet. The location of our stay was close enough to everything we wanted to do and there was plenty of parking. There are stairs leading down to the area that we stayed in, which we were not aware of and there are cats around the house too. We had a lot of luggage since we were soon traveling out of the country, which made it a little difficult to get settled in and pack our rental car. Overall the amenities and everything we needed were close. The bathroom has a shower and is close proximity to the bedroom.  There was a water pot and microwave very close as well. Denise had some travel sized toiletries for us to use if needed and towels. Thank you for that, it makes our stay that much easier and relaxing. We enjoyed watching Star Wars on VHS as well!!"
1009838,47893247,2015-09-21,33646857,Brian,"Denise was very communicative. I think she is admittedly a bit of a pack rat and has lots of business ""stuff"" in her house but if one uses the lower sliding door from the garden they basically have any area with the bedroom, an open area, and a full bathroom to themselves and can have complete privacy and access to the garden. The neighborhood is nice and plenty of parking. It seems that a car is necessary to get to restaurants etc on Ranier Blvd or to public transit. The bed was a simple foam pad mattress on a slat frame but was surprisingly comfortable!"
7941079,43886401,2015-08-22,24444727,Andrew,Very nice house with accommodating host.  I recommend staying with Alan.
7941079,44073892,2015-08-23,20367688,Scott,"Good location, accommodating host, and comfortable bed and pillows. Highly recommend!"
7941079,44501876,2015-08-26,26492201,Katherine E,"This is an amazing location and wonderful place to stay. The host is super accommodating and the house is very recently renovated. The floors, kitchen, and bathroom are super nice. We would definitely stay here again. 5 stars."
7941079,48548747,2015-09-27,32340996,Ale,"Alan managed everything to make my staying awesome. The place is fantastic. Exactly like in the listing, very comfortable bed, spacious and sunny bedroom, a good kitchen, nice bathroom. Everything very clean and organized. Although groceries stores are located 10-15 min walking distance, it's a great neighborhood and you can easily get around with public transportation."
7941079,51745799,2015-10-24,41832693,Math-You,I had a great experience at Alan's place. He was very friendly and accommodating. His place is pretty close to several bus stops and some good restaurants.
7941079,54513109,2015-11-21,22416564,Meg,Alan's house was lovely and I was so grateful I had such a great home base for my month in Seattle. The whole house is new and well-appointed with everything you could possibly need for your stay. Alan made sure I had everything I needed and made the experience so easy. 
7941079,55192673,2015-11-29,37633055,Jordan,"Alan was great!  He responded to questions very quickly, was super friendly, and had a great house.  In our specific case, our travel plans changed during our trip, and Alan quickly worked to get us a refund to accommodate us.  Overall, Alan was a pleasure to work with."
3977605,19839948,2014-09-19,20811344,Simone,"The host is very kind. The studio is simple, but complete and close to the center of downtown."
3977605,20196586,2014-09-25,14912758,Shelong,"The studio was a great place to stay. The bus lines were only a few blocks away and the 12 bus was actually right out front! The building was clean and quiet. The room itself was even better. We mostly spent time outside of the room but when we retired each night we were welcomed back with peace and quiet, just what we wanted."
3977605,20912430,2014-10-07,21011646,Schirin,"Although I haven't met Kevin and Monica personally, they were great hosts and very kind. They provided me with all the necessary  information and also great tips what to do in Seattle. The studio was really nice and cozy and had absolutely everything you need. It was clean and quiet and I really felt comfortable. It is also the perfect starting point to explore the city! Would definitely come again! "
3977605,21215920,2014-10-13,1432117,Hans,Kevin was very welcoming and the flat was just as described in the ad.
3977605,21391382,2014-10-16,21700800,Shawna,The suite was exactly as they promised it would be. It was clean and ready for our arrival. Kevin and Monika checked in with us and provided directions when we needed it. Bed was cozy. 
3977605,21520652,2014-10-19,20188852,Dan,"The studio was just as described in the posting. Great location (easy walk to Pike Place Market), convenient, and clean. Perfect for what we needed during a quick weekend trip to Seattle. Would definitely stay here again if we came back. Kevin and Monica were also very organized and communicated frequently prior to our trip to make sure it was a smooth arrival.
"
3977605,21888536,2014-10-26,16214322,Shavonne,"Kevin was super responsive whenever I contacted him. The location was great! If you're flying, I strongly suggest taking the light rail from SeaTac to Pioneer Square and it's a short walk. But as the description said, you ARE walking up steep hills. But we made it and no issues for us! The internet was fast, which we needed. However, there was no TV. I can't recall if they had mentioned that in their description, I may have missed it. You don't spend much time in the room anyway, so it's no biggie. Overall, GREAT location, fun city, so much to do and see, lots of walking, people are nice. Would recommend their studio anytime!"
3977605,22106868,2014-10-30,17480042,Jonah,"Great location, right off the highway and next to a hotel, so there are plenty of cabs around.

There's some construction going on right outside the window, so I was woken up early each morning. This is fine since I was in town for business."
3977605,22238927,2014-11-02,4872785,Scott,"Great location, we really enjoyed our stay. We also liked the personal recommendations list waiting in the room for us."
3977605,22488386,2014-11-08,17261057,Emily,"Wonderful experience, good area. Kevin and Monica were extremely helpful with information about the area but kept to themselves. I would certainly stay with them again! "
3977605,22655689,2014-11-11,21149320,Maegan,"The room was exactly what I expected: perfect for one person, in a good central location. I felt safe in the building and in the surrounding neighborhood, which I find important as a solo traveler. Kevin and Monica also left several suggestions for near-by restaurants and nightlife."
3977605,22945599,2014-11-18,21025004,Britni,Kevin and Monica's place was nice and clean and very cute. It had everything we needed and was a great location.  
3977605,23097013,2014-11-23,15583120,Kristen,"I had a great stay at Kevin and Monica's apartment. I was in town for work and travelling alone, and the apartment was very convenient to downtown and felt safe. There was construction during the week but I didnt hear anything over the weekend. Overall fun stay! "
3977605,23345966,2014-11-29,176284,Ping,"The place was small but comfortable, and a short walk to all the great things downtown Seattle has to offer."
3977605,23938301,2014-12-15,20939946,Justin,"Fantastic location, Kevin and Monica were excellent hosts. Apartment is exactly as advertised, cozy and very clean. Bed is very comfortable!!"
3977605,24308813,2014-12-25,24603269,Pamela,"The studio was exactly what I was looking for: clean, centrally located to the downtown area, and plenty of amenities. Kevin and Monica were very responsive and accommodating, great hosts. I did hear some noise from neighboring apartments (talking, kettle whistling), but I would still stay here again the next time I'm in Seattle. "
3977605,24406771,2014-12-28,6654442,Tasmin,"The studio is exactly as shown on the listing. The building is quite old in an area surrounded by fancy hotels and municipal buildings. Within walking distance to Pike Place Market, Chinatown etc. The uphill inclines meant we usually took public transport to get back (I hate hills!).  We were woken in the night by some amourous activities by the neighbours, so lights sleepers beware. For the price and location however, this is a great budget option to be near-ish downtown and have that all important private space - including a clean bathroom. Communication with the hosts was prompt and clear."
3977605,25288792,2015-01-11,1023598,Alyssa,The space was exactly as described in the listing...very clean and the bed was very comfortable. It's a great spot with easy access to downtown and Pike Place Market. Everything I needed for a quick stay in the city! If you're a light sleeper do be aware that you can easily here what your neighbors are up to and there is construction (as mentioned by the hosts). The first night was pretty loud but my second night was really quiet. I would stay here again. 
3977605,25404282,2015-01-15,2758774,Annie,"A lovely spot to stay in the city of Seattle. A cute and well dressed apartment, the space is tiny but perfect for a few days in the city!  The apartment was clean and in a safe building which are both great pluses! Walkable to downtown, Pike Place Market and many of the popular tourist spots. Unfortunately there was a construction work underway outside the window which meant for early mornings but this  was unavoidable. 
Monica and Kevin were lovely hosts and welcomed us warmly to Seattle! "
3977605,25515268,2015-01-18,8614940,Rachael,The space was really cute and accurately described. Super convenient as it is located right downtown. Made it easy for me to get to my day obligations downtown and to explore belltown in the evenings. Would definitely stay again. 
3977605,25592878,2015-01-20,22291149,Edan,"Kevin and Monica were great hosts. They replied on time, were very helpful with everything we needed but kept their distance and respected our privacy. The location of the apartment was absolutely wonderful. It is an easy walk to Pikes Place market, great restaurants, and public transportation to get you wherever else you need to go in the city. 
The instructions were clear and everything was where it was supposed to be. The room was very nice--I doubt you could fit more than two people in their comfortably, but it was perfect for our needs. The only downside was the construction being done next door--they start very early and since the apartment is on the ground level, it can get loud.
Overall Kevin and Monica provided an excellent experience and we would love to come back next time we are in Seattle. 

--Edan and Alina "
3977605,25716407,2015-01-24,25176302,Sarah,"We arrived late Wednesday night, the apartment was in an awesome central location downtown. The room itself was easy to find and clean, with towels and some toiletries provided. Bed was comfortable, temperature control was convenient with the fan. As expected, there was a ton of construction during our stay. Unfortunately for us, it started at 3:30am. Keep in mind: this is all happening 10 ft from the window.

Overall, location and price are well worth the stay if you don't mind the noise. "
3977605,26058159,2015-02-02,22927965,Jean-Pierre,"Delivered on everything promised. Did not expect the practical amenities offered, fridge with freezer, coffee maker, hair dryer, towels for everything etc, etc,etc. The studio apartment is short walking distance to public transportation. Easy to get in contact with Kevin. Only good things to say about the experience ."
3977605,26195676,2015-02-06,26900795,Sophie,"Spotlessly clean, and very well appointed - everything you need for a comfortable night's stay (stove and hob, microwave, coffee maker, fridge and freezer, all towels and flannels, shampoo etc).

Very comfy bed, and, while compact, had ample space for two people to cook, a little table for eating/work, large windows for air, good bathroom and lovely powerful shower.

As Kevin and Monica state it is pretty noisy from construction adjacent to the building - but didn't bother us at night time. The walls to next door are also pretty thin so you can hear everything they're doing too, day and night..."
3977605,26323737,2015-02-09,11670264,Daniela,"My boyfriend and I spent a weekend at Kevin and Monica's studio apartment. Location is perfect, it is near all shopping and tourist attractions in downtown area. The building is old but the apartment is cute and clean!"
3977605,26487495,2015-02-14,25141447,Melanie And Stéphane,"Kevin and Monica made everything really easy. The studio was perfect for two people. The location is great and we walked everywhere. We had all we needed to cook and the bed is very comfy. It is true that it is quite noisy because of the construction, so be prepared to get up early. And you can really hear everything that happens next door. But overall, it was a great first experience for us."
3977605,26615987,2015-02-16,6557879,Katie,"Monica and Kevin's place in the heart of downtown Seattle was perfect for our needs. Central to everything, we were able to walk or catch an uber to all major attractions. That space is small, but has everything you need for a quick trip. Note: there is construction right outside the window that starts early, but only during the week so if you're staying for just a weekend, you'll be fine. We would definitely recommend this vintage studio and would love to stay again!"
3977605,26874201,2015-02-21,26644583,David,"The room was clean, in a good area of the city, and very comfortable. Unfortunately, we did not have a pleasant stay because every morning we were promptly awoken at 7am by the sound of very loud construction work (which occurred about 6 feet from the window).
"
3977605,27037457,2015-02-23,551904,Michael,"A last minute reservation that Kevin quickly prepped in advance of my arrival. Found his studio to be small yet intimate, and user friendly (fridge, microwave, stove, utensils/plates and sink). For the independent traveler looking for an affordable place to stay close to the downtown attractions. Host responded promptly to all questions. "
3977605,27134954,2015-02-26,4769556,Laura,"Kevin was great. Easy to contact and let me drop my backpack off early so I could explore seattle before my check in time! 
The space is just as listed- small, right downtown, and slightly noisy because of construction next door. I was warned by other reviews and the hosts themselves. I didn't have a hard time sleeping because of the noise, but maybe bring ear plugs just in case. I was able to walk almost everywhere from this location. Would definitely stay here again if I visit seattle again. "
3977605,27345011,2015-03-02,27318763,Jun,"Awesome location. I walked around to pike place market, Link station, ferry to Bainbridge island, Columbia center even to Capitol Hill. It's a basement and some construction close during the day but I was tired so still had good rest. For me, it's all about location, location and location. 

I love Kevin and Monica's house manual. Very easy to follow and find the place. I didn't meet them but definitely appreciated their responsive manner for my questions.

Love Seattle and would recommend this basement studio to my friends. "
3977605,27591843,2015-03-08,5580746,Nicki,"We did not actually meet Kevin and Monica during our trip, but everything went according to plan. They were quick to respond to initial emails. My husband and I were able to get into the apartment with no problems when we needed to and found the apartment just as in the pictures, very clean, and ready for us. The space is small (it's a studio) but it's cozy for one person or a couple. The location was excellent and convenient for exploring downtown and Capitol Hill (although be warned it is at the top of a hill). We walked or took transit everywhere and it was easy. The mini kitchen had everything we needed for a short stay. Again, everything was very clean and well maintained. Bed was comfy if a bit too warm. There is construction just outside which began early (7am ish), but we didn't find it too bothersome and were gone most of the day anyway. Internet worked perfectly. Would recommend it for a stay in Seattle!"
3977605,27850326,2015-03-13,5808573,Emily,"The studio apartment is adorable, right in the middle of Seattle, and in a very secure building.  It is extremely easy to get to the airport or anywhere else in the city from there, and Kevin and Monica answered any questions right away.  I recommend!"
3977605,28178811,2015-03-19,24117322,Brittany,"Our whole experience was easy and pleasant!  The building is so close to everything that we were able to walk to most of our destinations. The studio was super clean and just the right size for two people. The construction started early but wasn't bothersome, we slept through it for a few hours and were gone most of the day anyway!  If anything, the noise got us up and exploring the city a little earlier, which was great :). Kevin and Monica responded quickly to any questions we had and were flexible with check in/out times to accommodate our schedule!  I would definitely recommend this spot to friends visiting Seattle for a short time. "
3977605,28387173,2015-03-23,26506458,Mark,Good messages with information about location of place and ease of getting in prior to the trip.  Nice guides to the city left in the room for anyone not knowledgeable about Seattle.
3977605,28567644,2015-03-26,4704137,Jen,Had a great trip in Seattle! This unit is super convenient to get everywhere we needed! The construction in the area was a little obtrusive in the mornings but we knew this going in and just used it as a morning wake up alarm :P everything we needed was in the room and they were great at communicating when we had questions!
3977605,28693651,2015-03-29,18672621,Mike,"Great stay!!! Exactly what I was looking for. Kevin and Monica were out of town, but everything ran smoothly and my stay was great. Anytime I had a question, they were prompt and very helpful (like 6 AM morning helpful when I couldn't figure out how to turn on the shower). Great location. Came to Seattle for the ECCC (comic con) and it was only a 5 to 10 minute walk to the convention center. Right in downtown. "
3977605,28949395,2015-04-01,28779823,Breanne,The apartment was definitely Vintage....Small vintage apartment accurate description.  Location was good pretty easy to walk anywhere in downtown Seattle.  They are doing major construction literally right outside of the windows and I believe its another building going up.  I would image would not be completed for a year.  Very loud and starts about 7am.   A bit expensive for what you get I think a more accurate price would be $85-90 a night not worth the $105 we paid plus the fees.  
3977605,29037301,2015-04-03,25769560,Corey,"Stayed here for two nights on a Seattle trip, and while we didn't meet Kevin and Monica in person, they were responsive to emails beforehand and to texts during our stay. They even let us drop our bags off before the room was ready for check-in, which was super helpful. Convenient location to tourist spots downtown, but bring your walking shoes as it's located near the top of one of Seattle's lovely hills."
3977605,29275701,2015-04-06,4526771,Andreana,"Clean, peaceful and has a very comfortable bed. Kevin and Monica could not have been more accommodating. It was also in a very convenient area. We walked almost everywhere at all hours, all weekend. Thank you!"
3977605,29720997,2015-04-12,12868538,Nick,"Comfortable who needs a place to sleep. Im not gonna lie, the options for having a firm vs soft pillow helped me sleep. Amazing hosts who had everything I needed for the trip. More than happy here and I'll definitely stay again."
3977605,30023207,2015-04-16,27606195,Claudia,"We had a great stay at this studio. Everything was clean and the kitchen was well equiped. The location is great to explore Seattle by foot and there are lots of shops, restaurants and cafes near by. Though we didn't meet Kevin and Monica in person they always replied very promptly to our messages and were incredibly helpful (we could leave our luggage for a couple of hours at the flat after we had checked out). I would stay here again. Thank you!"
3977605,30771904,2015-04-27,27412722,Alexandrea,"First time using Airbnb. We had a great experience. Kevin and Monica provided us with all the information we needed. 
The studio was the perfect location for our stay. Walking distance to Pike's Market, Capitol Hill and Pioneer Square. 
The building is old so you can hear everything going on in adjacent rooms but we spent more time exploring the city and less time in the studio. There is some major construction going on next door but they don't seem to work on the weekend so we weren't bothered by it. 
I would recommend this studio to anyone who would like a great downtown Seattle experience. 
"
3977605,30977090,2015-04-30,26431905,Kristen,"We enjoyed staying in Kevin and Monica's studio. It's a great place! Everything was exactly as expected. Restaurant recommendations and other guides were waiting on us when we arrived. We enjoyed that Kevin and Monaca left us to ourselves, and everything we needed was right in the apartment! 

The location was great- only a 10 minute walk from Pike's Place and right next to a major hotel with cabs always waiting out front. The bed was really comfortable, and made it a bit hard to wake up. 

The construction does start early, but it's really not excruciatingly loud- it can be blocked out with closed windows and a fan on.  "
3977605,31111274,2015-05-02,29690193,David,This was a great choice to stay. A short walk to pikes place and the room was everything we needed. Very private and nice. 
3977605,31316194,2015-05-04,11179992,Kiki,Perfect location. The room is clean and we had everything we needed. Wonderful place. Will likely come again. 
3977605,31693817,2015-05-09,26676737,David,The hosts were welcoming. The space was small and not luxurious. But this was adequately described in the listing. 
3977605,31875395,2015-05-11,15875991,Luca,"My wife and I loved staying at Kevin and Monica's place. 
The location is amazing, the apartment is in great conditions and the hosts are really accommodating and helpful. "
3977605,32080136,2015-05-13,32169246,Jordan,"Great location, we were able to walk everywhere we wanted to go. Well stocked with amenities. Nothing fancy, but a comfortable spot to rest your head. Exactly what I was looking for."
3977605,32314831,2015-05-17,26649131,Jack,"Overall great experience in the downtown district of Seattle. You are close to smith tower, highway 5, and the business district. We walked around the city and got to most places in about 20 minutes. As for the apartment you are staying at, I'd give it a three out of five. All things considered, the overall score is a four out Of five. Because of the price, We really can't complain. Just know that you are staying on the first floor of a busy street so if you are a light sleeper, you may have difficulty here. The place is clean for the most part, just a little outdated. Also it's a small studio, however my wife and I did just fine with the space. Owners leave shampoo, paper towels, silverware, tea kettle, hairdryer, and an iron for you. "
3977605,32718481,2015-05-20,31515808,Francesca,It was a perfect location and very easy to get around to and from within the city. Really clean and comfortable! Perfect for a short stay! 
3977605,33238050,2015-05-26,20448562,Leticia,"We enjoyed our stay while visiting Seattle.  Great location to downtown, easy to walk to destination places.  Seattle is a great walking town. There are also taxis, buses and trains nearby. The place was very comfortable, comfy bed and pillows. The price was reasonable. "
3977605,33652148,2015-05-31,7544038,Jeremy,"The on-line presentation of this apartment is accurate. The hosts communicate well and promptly by email, but I never saw them. I tried to call them once (at midnight, when I was having trouble figuring out the building’s outer door code system) but the call went to an answering service. Eventually I figured the system out (the five-digit code starts with an asterisk!) and got in. 

As explained, the apartment is next to a construction site (Seattle is in the throes of a construction boom!), but the noise should not disturb you unless you are spending long daytime periods in the apartment, or you are unusually sensitive to noise. It didn’t bother me. The linen and towels were clean and the bed was comfortable. 

As noted, it’s a five- to-ten-minute walk to most anywhere downtown and there’s a taxi rank by the door. The hosts had compiled a useful list of recommendations of places to go/shop/etc. I liked the painting on the wall and the internet worked quickly and quite reliably. 

In general the apartment is quite serviceable for a self-sufficient single visitor who is out running around most of the time. 
"
3977605,34051807,2015-06-04,2595791,Manon,Kevin and Monica's studio was cosy and perfect for my stay. Clean and as described. Quiet at night even though it is downtown and next to the highway.
3977605,34287639,2015-06-07,30023802,Kallie,Good location close to downtown and Kevin and Monica where there to help if I needed any assistance.
3977605,34699825,2015-06-11,30132455,Margie,"Timely and informative responses by Kevin & Monica. Advised correctly about the steep hills, parking and construction across the road. Be aware that construction starts @ 5.30am. Had difficulty using provided code to the security access after hours but fortunately others were exiting the building @ the same time. We were provided with a phone number but we didn't have a phone. Place was clean but it is very small and the building is quite old and musty, probably due to age. Very basic cooking facilities if required. Bed was comfortable. Good location"
3977605,35366921,2015-06-18,6001784,Chris,Kevin and Monica were helpful and everything was clean and as expected.  One pleasant surprise they added an air conditioner to the room which I was not expecting.  
3977605,35639164,2015-06-21,25977772,Patrick,Excellent location in downtown Seattle. Kevin and Monica were clear and prompt in communication and their apartment was as described. 
3977605,36014764,2015-06-24,31915311,Giovanni,"Kevin and Monica's home was very clean and convenient. It is in a perfect location downtown that is close to everything, which was great for us because we made many trips to Pike's market and Capitol Hill.  You won't need a car at all! We went everywhere by walking. The studio is very simple and met our every necessity."
3977605,36357258,2015-06-28,24464323,Star,"What a perfect little gem. Excellent location, quiet neighborhood, and walking distance to everywhere we wanted to go.
Thank you, thank you for the AC unit since we were there during unseasonably hot temps.
Look forward to staying here the next time we are in Seattle."
3977605,36686338,2015-06-30,33395233,Michelle,The apartment was in a great location and had everything we needed for our quick stay. We weren't able to meet Kevin and Monica but they prepped us for our stay very well giving us the info we needed to get into the building and also provided some great suggestions for places in the neighborhood. 
3977605,37018328,2015-07-03,36896292,Tomas,Enjoyed staying at Kevin and Monica's studio in downtown Seattle. This studio is on the smaller side but great for two people if you're not spending much time in the apartment anyways. Location was great and within walking distance from all of the attraction downtown has to offer. The AC unit was amazing and really cooled the place down during the hot weather we experienced
3977605,37745651,2015-07-10,11963812,Brice,The room is nice and you have everything you need. The building is old and the main entrance is filthy and stinks. But Kevin and Monica's room is clean. The location is great for tourism
3977605,37953082,2015-07-12,1777041,Gabriel,"Well located, no complications, convenient."
3977605,38270271,2015-07-14,32597066,Brock,Awesome location right downtown.
3977605,38592089,2015-07-17,31663981,Erin,"Kevin and Monica's apartment was perfect for our stay in Seattle! It is located within walking distance of all things touristy, as well as close to many restaurants and shops. Best of all, our hosts anticipated our needs, and even provided a fan and portable air conditioner to keep us comfortable in the heat. Thank you Kevin and Monica, we had an amazing time!"
3977605,39372938,2015-07-23,3072396,Simon,"Kevin and Monica were terrific hosts! They were quick to reply with any questions we had. The place is very tidy, clean and is very well located, central to everything! We greatly enjoyed our stay!"
3977605,40078527,2015-07-28,16191166,Clint,Great place. Perfect locale. It is super convenient for transit and getting to pike place market!  
3977605,40323424,2015-07-30,6914892,Anna,"This apartment was in an ideal location, walking distance to downtown and a few miles from Capitol Hill.  The apartment was clean and cozy. Kevin and Monica were easy to reach and did a good job with communication. There is construction outside the building, but there's construction all over Seattle and I woke up early to start the day anyway, so it didn't bother me. I'd stay there again. "
3977605,40885105,2015-08-03,27895410,Andrew,"Kevin and Monica's apartment in downtown Seattle was perfect for our stay.  It is super close to everything you would want to see and at a fraction of the cost.  The room is in one of the older buildings in Seattle and comes with charm to match.  For a short stay it is plenty big and has a very comfortable bed.  Low cost, comfy and convenient.  As an extra plus the owners were extremely responsive most of the time within the hour of a question.  Highly recommend!"
3977605,41215554,2015-08-05,26162719,Courtney,Great location and accurate description of the place. Thanks for a great stay!
3977605,41726493,2015-08-09,7923921,Jessica,We had a wonderful stay at Kevin and Monica's place. Great downtown location and walking distance to many fun activities. Would definitely recommend this listing and the hosts had excellent communication the whole way through. 
3977605,42251073,2015-08-12,30024029,Aaron,The space is a bit small but it has a fully equipped kitchen and a/c. The location was safe and close to the library and museum.
3977605,43026612,2015-08-17,23700250,David,"Fantastic little unit in a superb location.  I would stay here again in a heartbeat!  Kevin and Monica were very friendly, accommodating, and gave us several great recommendations in the guidebook.  Very comfortable bed too.  The location is hard to beat.  Easy access to I-5 and a countless number of restaurants, bars, & attractions within walking distance.  To avoid walking directly up the steep hill the apartment is situated on when coming from downtown or anywhere near Pike Place Market, we found it was easier to gradually walk up 6th from the West instead of Marion from the South.  We thoroughly enjoyed being able to walk everywhere around this unit, but being Floridians, we were quite sore the next day after climbing all the hills!"
3977605,43490973,2015-08-20,34877754,Shawn,"The studio was just as advertised, clean, comfortable, and a fantastic downtown location. We were only in town for a few days and were able to walk to all the places we wanted to see. 
Pike place market, pioneer square, Seattle Art Museum, and many great pubs, restaurants and cafes.  Even the Space Needle is a reasonable walking distance. 
Kevin and Monica were a pleasure to deal with. Very accommodating (we arrived quite late in the evening), and their ""visitors guide"" to the city was very helpful. Went to some of their recommended restaurants and cafes and were not disappointed. 
On top of that, they contacted us a couple times just to see if we had any questions or concerns and to see how we were enjoying ourselves. 
Totally enjoyed our stay. 
Thanks again Kevin and Monica!"
3977605,43908635,2015-08-23,20476800,Michael,"Incredible communication from Kevin and Monica. They made our trip to Seattle a breeze and a great experience. The apartment is in a solid location and we walked to pretty much anywhere. (Had no idea how hilly Seattle is though) The bed is so comfortable, which is all we needed for our stay. A great home base for us first time visitors. I think I'll be renting again from Kevin and Monica in the future! "
3977605,44321469,2015-08-25,6547838,Heather,"Great place in a convenient location. There was construction happening right next to the place, but I was prepared and brought earplugs, so it didn't bother me. If you are a light sleeper, or want to sleep in, this might be a problem. Short walk to Pike's Place, and there are cabs parked right out front if you get sick of walking and want to go somewhere further (the hills nearby can be a little tough going if you've been walking all day). Had an issue with the buzzer at first, but it worked with the provided code.  Kevin and Monica were helpful and communicative, and provided a nice list of things to see and do. We were able to go right down the street and rent a car for the second leg of our trip, and it was super helpful that they told us to wait till we were leaving Seattle to rent the car. Thanks for providing your place, we had an amazing time and can't wait to come back! "
3977605,44523354,2015-08-27,5899040,Adrianna,"This studio is neat and clean, and we appreciated the detailed instructions from Monica and Kevin!  This studio is an easy walk to the downtown area and Pioneer Square, which we loved.

The studio is in an older building with musty hallways, but the studio itself is bright and airy for a small space.

In late August 2015, major construction was occurring right outside the windows from the early morning through the late evening.  If you are sensitive to noise, you may want to check on the status of construction.  The construction project is for a new building and looked like it had many months to go.  There seemed to be a lot of construction in downtown Seattle, so this may just be par for the course!

This studio is a great option for affordable walkability.  Thank you to Monica and Kevin for being such conscientious and organized hosts."
3977605,44879467,2015-08-30,9523144,Abby,Kevin and Monica were very welcome and accommodating.  They responded quickly to my messages. The apartment is in a very central location that made it easy for me to get to a wedding at the Seattle Aquarium. It is also an easy (if uphill) walk from the airport light rail when you arrive.
3977605,45678656,2015-09-05,23299491,Amanda,This place is exactly what we were looking for. It is a fantastic little space. The room was clean and the bed is comfortable. It is central to just about anything you want to see while in Seattle. Although we didn't meet the hosts in person they stayed in touch with us to make sure our needs were met. I would stay with them again!
3977605,46148481,2015-09-08,3439451,Connor,Best airbnb ever. Would stay again. 
3977605,47264473,2015-09-17,5026335,Liz,"While we never met Kevin and Monica, we had very good communication from them before and throughout our stay. The apartment was as advertised, and perfectly located for us to access everything in downtown Seattle, and to bus very easily to locations further afield. While the building interior was a bit old and musty, the apartment itself was very comfortable, clean, and pleasant. There was construction outside the room, as other reviewers mention, but this didn't bother us despite its starting pretty early each day. We were really pleased to have stayed here...the location was great, and it was a very comfortable place to stay. Very glad that we chose it, and we'd choose it again!"
3977605,48080521,2015-09-23,39179974,Dawn,"You can't ask for a better deal downtown Seattle. The building is a little run down, but the apartment itself is very nice, and stocked with just about anything you'd need to prepare meals. My husband and I had a lot of fun walking to the marketplace every day for groceries and trinkets. 

We didn't interact with Kevin and Monica much during our stay, which was perfectly fine with us. We had a great vacation."
3977605,48704665,2015-09-28,39721528,Robert,"K and M were great! Everything went smoothly during our stay. The studio was as expected, and even though there is limited space, it is in an awesome location walking distance from everything. If you're going with a girl, make sure she understands that space is limited! Air conditioner was money as it got a little warm with all the walking we did. The building/room was relatively old-ish, but if you're only staying for a few days, doesn't really matter. This was my first AirBnB experience and, overall, it went as smoothly as I could have anticipated. Thanks K and M!  "
3977605,49775398,2015-10-06,39070469,Rebecca,"This was our first Airbnb experience-it was great! The apartment was exactly as described by Kevin and Monica. Actually, the bed was cloud-like and the air-conditioning unit was useful for cooling the room and blocking out noise. While it is a bit of a hike up to this building (as they disclose in the post), the hill creates a great view, and the building is centrally located to everything we wanted to do as tourists. We were able to walk most places and easily access the bus/rail from the apartment. The unit was perfect for us first-time visitors.

Kevin and Monica made it convenient for us to enter/exit whenever. We did not need to reach out with any issues during our stay but their responses to our questions were prompt and they also checked in once we arrived. 

We had a great time in Seattle and highly recommend Kevin and Monica's apartment!"
3977605,50007040,2015-10-08,30930545,Jeremiah,Kevin and Monica's place was great. It was close to everything and clean. It was a great place to crash while I was in town for work.
3977605,50445748,2015-10-12,39644910,Eduardo,"Great location. The apartment had everything we needed during our stay, and Kevin and Monica were very responsive."
3977605,51019089,2015-10-17,27841931,Aimee,This listing is in the heart of Downtown Seattle. The apartment was as advertised. Kevin made himself available for questions throughout our stay. 
3977605,51432751,2015-10-20,16014391,Gillian,"Kevin and Monica are really nice hosts, even though we did not really met. All the instructions are quite clear and the location is easy to find. Indeed it is a bit uphill from light rail station, but I also considered that as a good exercise :)
Everything is within walking distance, which is the part I like most. 
Talking about the noise some other people mentioned before, it is completely not affect me at all. During my stay, there seems no construction on going, just one day some construction workers by pass the window around 5AM, but not very loud, so it is kind of OK to me.
In general, it is a small room, but have everything you need. I do really recommend this studio."
3977605,52056841,2015-10-26,25509094,Ashley,Great little space in a great location. Perfect for 2 people looking to explore Seattle. Would stay here again.
3977605,52436762,2015-10-29,15740787,Ravi,"Lovely location and experience! Highly recommend staying here to anyone traveling in a couple and looking for a cheap place next to downtown. Clean, good bathroom and quiet."
3977605,52876804,2015-11-02,20081874,Madison,Great little place close to downtown and Capitol Hill. We were able to walk to most places which was nice. There is still construction going on so it was noisy at times. Other than that we had a wonderful stay!
3977605,53048205,2015-11-04,28122263,Chantal,Everything went well. This unit is very cute and centrally located. Kevin and Monica will make sure you have all you need to be comfortable. 
3977605,53325866,2015-11-08,27613584,Jan,"Kevin and Monica were accommodating and allowed us to drop off bags before check-in but were hands off with the actual welcoming process and although we did not experience any issues, the self-service nature of the stay could be challenging for less experienced air bnb-ers.  The listing was accurate and the location was wonderful and central to life, dining, and shopping in downtown Seattle.  Current construction is ongoing outside the window but merely added to the background noise common in any large and growing city.  The building  is located in the midst of a large and growing city, right off of the Interstate 5, and was easy to walk to with close access to public transportation.  "
3977605,53760157,2015-11-12,14570694,Katie,"Great location, super warm. Cute place."
3977605,54093398,2015-11-16,20428714,Pim,"Although Kevin and Monica were not present, they replied to all messages very quickly so the checking in and out was a breeze. We really just needed a centrally-located home base of operations in the city and their place was perfect in that aspect!

It's in an old building in desperate need of refreshening and repair however. The heater has a dial with no markings, the bathroom does not close, and the windows have large holes that let air in. The hallway smells of BO among other things...I don't really mind too much but my mother was quite disturbed.

All in all a decent experience. You pay for location and convenience more than anything here."
3977605,54696949,2015-11-23,17224658,Avery,"Kevin and Monica's place was great. Located in a easily accessible location from the light rail which is nice if you fly into Seattle. It's a very clean studio in the basement of a super old building that is sort of smelly as you walk down to the apartment, but the room is very clean and nice. Great deal for a couple visiting seattle or if you're going to a Seahawks game like we did. Highly recommended"
3977605,55400055,2015-12-01,2365216,Gary,"Everything was as expected.  Kevin and Monica checked in with me to make sure I got in okay.  I was out early and came back late so I never had to bother them.  This is the perfect location if you are visiting Seattle for a couple of days to tour.  It is within walking distance to everything.  Most people typically Uber everywhere or bus.  I was able to walk everywhere and just bus around to the tourist attractions, i.e. Kerry Park, Space Needle, Olympic Park, Gasworks Park etc.  

"
3977605,56375641,2015-12-13,5898982,Rachel,"This place met my expectations and I appreciate how transparent Kevin and Monica were about everything. The space was perfect for our needs since we were gone most of the day sightseeing. The hosts were very responsive and approachable. There is a lot of development/construction around the area but I'm use to the noise, so it wasn't an issue for me. Also, the building is a bit older but the room was very clean and the heater kept us warm. I'd definitely stay here again!"
3977605,57113816,2015-12-22,21358533,Darian,"We had a great time at this little apartment! Perfect location for exploring the city, easy to walk to restaurants, drug store for snacks and essentials, shopping, the waterfront, etc. It was SO cozy and comfortable, clean, functional and the check in/check out process was super easy. There was some construction but it did not bother us one bit. We had a great time and were happy to come back to this great, warm space every night. So much better than a hotel! "
3977605,57516580,2015-12-27,44493977,Maarten,"My wife and I spend the week of Christmas here and we had a great time. The location is perfect in the center so that you can walk to a lot of Seattle's highlight.

The building is a little older but it definitely had it charms. The studio itself is really cozy, it isn't huge but has all that you need. It has a sufficiently equipped kitchen so you can prepare food, but who really wants to cook in a city with so many great food options. In the studio the hosts had printed a list of their favorite places to eat or grab a drink. You should definitely give those places a try!

It was easy to communicate with Kevin and Monica through the Airbnb app(or site). They were always quick to respond and very helpful. 

I will definitely go back here the next time I am Seattle!

"
3977605,57765535,2015-12-29,42321432,Caitlyn,Kevin and Monica were wonderful hosts! They are available if they are ever needed and the apartment is in a great location for downtown Seattle. 
3890990,18283650,2014-08-24,6982729,Mike,"While we never met Blair face-to-face, he had everything ready for us in this great remodeled house and was very responsive every time we pinged him.  
The house was roomy, comfortable, and a great place to stay while we hit the tourist spots in Seattle.  
The back yard is HUGE and a great place to hang out and enjoy the weather and the gardens.
Ice was in the freezer and brand new ketchup and mustard were waiting for us in the refrigerator.  Also provided were tons of towels, plenty of flatware, and a full set of pots and pans.
Lots of room, comfy beds, lots of light, tastefully decorated, and very comfortable for our family of four.
The location is great for wandering around a very nice neighborhood, driving to downtown and other close-by neighborhoods, or jumping on a bus just a few blocks away to go just about anywhere.
We thoroughly enjoyed the house and had fun playing many games of Clue (one of a few board games waiting for us in the house) when we’d get home in the evening, flying gliders in the backyard, and just having a nice place to come back to after several long days of sightseeing.  We’d definitely stay there again!"
3890990,19330936,2014-09-10,13095042,Frederic,"We had a really nice stay, the rooms were really comfortable, and the house is very nice, the neighborhood is quite and very close to Downtown and UW district. Easy access to public transit and public parks (Green Lake). What a nice spot! I totally recommend staying here. :)"
3890990,20048521,2014-09-22,14689513,Pagaka,Blair's space is located in a quiet neighborhood. The beds were really comfy. My friends and I really enjoyed our stay here. So did our dogs…they really enjoyed running in the spacious backyard. 
3890990,20470196,2014-09-29,21506765,Tom,"
This was our first airbnb experience and it was fantastic! Blair's home and communication provided my girlfriend and I with all the comfort and convenience we hoped for. It is a neatly kept home with cute decor and a giant back yard.  The location is ideal as it is within walking distance of fun bars and restaurants and a short drive to Ballard as well as the Downtown area. It definitely has a strong sense of ""home"" which is nice to come back to after a long day of romping around town. We absolutely fell in love and will keep it in mind as we plan to visit again soon. "
3890990,20957618,2014-10-08,17454991,Pat,"We just enjoyed a week at the Greenwood home while preparing to celebrate my daughter's wedding in Seattle. Blair was a pleasure to work with, informative, very responsive, made the whole rental process a little less scary for a first-timer, and even came to the rescue with a new TV remote after the original accidentally took a trip in the last guest's luggage! (No worries, though, it arrived back at the house via FedEx the next day!) The home was very comfy, including ALL the mattresses, even the pull-out couch, plenty of linens to go around, and located in a nice, quiet neighborhood where trees were dropping yellow leaves. The house itself was surrounded with flowers with a nice backyard for playing with our dog.  One of the things I liked best about the house was the use of wood floors with area rugs. Very clean, no sinus issues going on, beautiful decor, good lighting and plenty of books and games for entertainment. Everyone felt blessed to be in such a nice house where we could cook our meals and enjoy them together and feel relaxed. The kitchen table was large enough to accommodate all of us and our various wedding projects. Great place. good location, and wonderful host.  I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again."
3890990,21251448,2014-10-13,7758368,Jake,"Had a great stay at Blair's house.  Brought my family and dog up - we enjoyed the neighborhood, large and beautiful yard, and everything on the inside was very nice and comfortable.  Blair was very responsive when I had a couple of questions.   Only compliments, no complaints."
3890990,22769691,2014-11-14,11541905,Barbara,"This is a great little house in a perfect location with a big back yard and absolutely everything you will need for your stay in Seattle.  The neighborhood is delightful.  You can walk into Greenwood and Phinney Ridge to eat or shop, and if you have a car, you can park right in front of the property.  The host, Blair, is a great guy and very accommodating.  My plans changed a couple of times, and he was incredibly flexible and understanding.  I would recommend his home to anyone, with or without a family and dogs, who wants to experience what it's like to live in one of the most popular areas in the city."
3890990,23430308,2014-12-01,21606312,Heather,"This was a great place to stay in a nice, quiet neighborhood. We loved the house - it was perfect for us. We had 2 adults and 4 kids (ages ranging from 2 to 12). It got pretty cold on the second night and even snowed the third day we were there. The central heating worked OK, but the back bedroom was a bit chilly. However, I never noticed it until I woke up because the linens and comforter were fantastic! We would definitely book this again!"
3890990,23802358,2014-12-10,5238766,Andrew,We had a great stay here. Very comfortable home and the surrounding area is great. Very happy. 
3890990,24206217,2014-12-22,24767792,Shanina,"Blair's place is fantastic and definitely aligns with expectations based on the photographs. 

While the location is a bit far from downtown Seattle, it's located in a nice, quiet neighborhood and is very easy to find - it doesn't take long to hop on 99 or I-5 to head in either direction. 

Communication leading up to our stay was great and detailed instructions were provided with the reservation. Thanks Blair! 
"
3890990,24289128,2014-12-24,15426512,Hannah,It was such a lovely and comfortable place to stay; we had everything we needed. We had no problem getting in and out as Blair left very thorough instructions for everything. It was a close and quick enough drive to all the attractions we wanted to see and was in a quiet neighborhood.
3890990,24581036,2014-12-31,9691165,Michael,"This charming house was exactly as represented and perfectly met our needs.  There is a spacious yard, and the house is located in a lovely neighborhood - close to a great playground and a Safeway. The check-in was clear and easy. One minor issue is that on very cold days, it was difficult to heat the home evenly."
3890990,24790268,2015-01-02,21711664,Simon,"This was a nice little house in Greenwood. There were six in our party and were very combortable. All very straightforward, we never needed to see Blair. A very minor problem was the lack of linen for the sofa bed. "
3890990,25132369,2015-01-07,23588522,Qian,"Generally, everything is not bad, the only thing is that the rooms is not as big as they are in the pictures."
3890990,25296131,2015-01-11,25663044,Maya,"Everything was clearly described on the listing, we found our way in quite easily without having to schedule picking up the keys. The home was clean and quite charming, good location not far from shops and restaurants, a great place to stay with kids because of the huge yard. "
3890990,25331134,2015-01-12,21460175,Jenny,"The house was clean and well organized. 
"
3890990,25606438,2015-01-20,24271700,Stephanie,The home was in a nice neighborhood with lots to see. The home itself was clean when we arrived and fit our party of six comfortably. It was smaller than we expected but enjoyed our stay regardless. 
3890990,25879149,2015-01-28,10902932,Denise,"   I stayed here with family. We arranged ahead of time to bring our dogs and loved the fenced yard for them.  The pictures are accurate, the house was clean , and the beds were comfy. We prepared our meals there and the kitchen is nicely equipped with supplies.  
   It is in a nice , quiet neighborhood. We loved the Sunday Farmer's market in the nearby Ballard area. Easy access to freeway and a short drive to downtown Seattle. I would stay here again . "
3890990,26059192,2015-02-02,1199614,Chris,"Check in was super easy, place was just as described, cozy and warm when we needed the heat. Place has everything you'd need and in a quiet neighborhood. Kids loved the oversized, fenced in yard. "
3890990,26272776,2015-02-08,8096275,Ernie,"Blair's place is exactly as you see it. It was easy to get in, cook, relax and anything else you'd expect in your own house. The bathroom sink wasn't draining properly and Blair had it fixed within a few hours. We had an awesome stay."
3890990,26338051,2015-02-09,12114712,Julius,"We stayed for one night, place was as described. 
Good location, shops are really close by.
Beds were comfortable and clean.
Thank you!"
3890990,26632151,2015-02-16,24637667,Inès,The house was as described and we had a very nice stay. Everything we needed was in the house and the organization was easy. There is a beautiful garden in a nice and quiet district. The house is close to a bus station. It takes 30 minutes to go to Downtown by bus. Totally recommended!
3890990,26931550,2015-02-22,26769352,Stephanie,"The listing description was completely accurate -- the house was clean, organized, and just what we needed.

We were very comfortable and very happy with our rental!"
3890990,27550530,2015-03-07,6548754,Josh (And Jessica),"Absolute perfect airbnb experience. Home was adorable, in a great part of town, very clean and comfortable. Blair is very sweet and responsive. The place fit all 5 of us very comfortably and we all felt right at home. Highly recommend this home for your stay in Seattle! "

3890990,28090059,2015-03-17,2938505,Kelly,We had a great stay at Blair's house. It was cozy and homey. Love the neighborhood and the house's features. It was also a great value for the price!
3890990,28796756,2015-03-30,1703004,Becky,"The house is great, really cute and has everything you would need for a week long stay. The neighbourhood is also sweet, safe - great running trail near by - and lots of cafes and restaurants within a 6 minute walk. If you are needing to go downtown everyday - e.g. conferences - its a bit far out (35-40 mins on the bus and $20 taxi), but the bus does go through some great neighbourhoods which I really wanted to explore. It was also a wonderful haven to come back to after a crazy day of work/sightseeing."
3890990,30813572,2015-04-27,1204371,Ashok,I did not get to meet Blair but all responses were prompt over airbnb IM.

3890990,36991045,2015-07-03,34269121,Charlotte,"The house was well equipped, as described- super cute. It was very hot when we were in Seattle, but the house stayed cool. It was about 20 mins in a taxi to the downtown area of Seattle.
The local neighbourhood was quiet.  "
3890990,37153970,2015-07-05,11725365,Amy Hoyeon,"Awesome vacation in Seattle.
Thank you Blair rent us a wonderful house.
so convenience to go seattle downtown."
3890990,39157560,2015-07-21,31792022,BettyAnn,"A very positive experience staying at Blair's house in Greenwood. 
Fully furnished home that was conveniently located just minutes from Seattle (without traffic), the University District, Northgate Mall, etc.... It was also easy walking distance to all the bars and restaurants on Greenwood. Loved that there was always parking available for us too, at any hour we returned.
My family of 6 people was very comfortable in the house. Although it was a cozy fit, there was plenty of room with the empty dressers and closets to accommodate our stuff. No one ever ran out of hot water and the air condition unit kept us nice and cool. We totally lucked out with our vacation because the weather was beautiful!
There was Netflix and wifi available, so the kids were happy when there was down time or my husband and I went out for the night.
Blair was great. We were short a blanket and pillow cases and she immediately delivered what we needed on the day that was asked.
I totally recommend this rental and I would also use it again."
3890990,39431420,2015-07-23,8177129,Joni,Lovely little cottage with a big friendly backyard! It had everything we needed. It was within walking distance to some lovely shops and restaurants.
3890990,39659585,2015-07-25,26543157,Alvin,"I think it is sweet house. But it's too small for six people. Five is best. Totally, I really relax in this place."
3890990,39738613,2015-07-26,30421042,Heather,"Blair's home was the absolutely perfect place for a group of friends to gather and slumber before having to part our separate ways. The home was warm, welcoming, comfortable and conveniently located to services, restaurants, grocery and the freeway."
3890990,40889881,2015-08-03,27057834,Bonnie Bingyi,It's a very lovely and clean house. We really enjoy our stay here. I would recommend this place for a group of less than five people.
3890990,41928263,2015-08-10,31050065,Desiree,"Great little home, fit 6 of us very nicely. Very close to shops & the bus to get to downtown. Thanks!"
3890990,42195641,2015-08-11,30478029,Jennifer,We had a short stay at Blair's place as this was a stopover for us before flying back home.  Just right for our needs!   Appreciated Blair's quick and clear communication.   
3890990,43810872,2015-08-22,8146517,Joy,Cute and just as described.  Our family enjoyed their time here.
3890990,43934830,2015-08-23,14759643,Isabelle,"Check in was easy and the decor was nice. Everything was nice and clean except for the bathroom, which was a bit moldy."
3890990,44119426,2015-08-24,35599666,Samantha,This house was perfect for our needs. We loved the large backyard and everything was very comfortable.  I would definitely recommend this rental to another visitor. :)
3890990,45965899,2015-09-07,21420481,Jamie,"The place was great and in a nice, quiet neighborhood. Blair's directions for access were pretty easy and clear. The space was nice and suited our needs for a girl's weekend. "
3890990,46838746,2015-09-13,13523199,Zoey,"This house was great for what I was looking for, which was a comfy, safe place to stay for a short trip with my mother. Blair was accommodating of us and my Shiba Inu and on a short-notice, which is always greatly appreciated.

The house was bright, inviting, and comfortable. I really enjoyed having access to the kitchen and laundry, as they were very useful both nights we stayed. The outside area is spacious and green. Internet access was great. Air conditioning was wonderful as it was rather warm when we stayed. The beds were the best part of the house (IMO). Extremely soft and comfy, which I love!

I am not sure I would say exactly that it is ""walkable"", especially to any of the more classic touristy things in Seattle, but it was a 20ish minute drive to any place that we wanted to go, which wasn't too much of an inconvenience.  I had no issues with on street parking, as there was always a few spaces available in front of the house. 

There were a few things that I felt needed just a little attention. One was that it looked like it hadn't been swept in a couple weeks, as there were dust bunnies and hair on the floor of the entire house (including the bathroom). The paint on the tub floor in the bathroom seemed to be peeling off or something, as it was covered by a plastic bath mat (which doubles for a slip mat too). I didn't look further because it wasn't too big of an issue and didn't impact the usefulness of the shower, just something I noticed. Also, I could not find any extra linens such as extra pillow cases or sheets in the closests, but thankfully I always have some backup in my car. 

Overall the house was great and mostly clean. I would recommend people stay here if they want a comfortable, budget-friendly, home-like atmosphere. "
3890990,47120760,2015-09-15,31502756,Peilun,"It's a nice place in a quite neighborhood, and close to Safeway, coffee and restaurants. We planned most of activities in Seattle downtown, UW and the woodland park zoo this trip. All the drive we had were all within 20mins, this is why we can stay in the city late ob both days. It's so close to everything and convenience. Highly recommend."
3890990,48765381,2015-09-28,5111940,Emily,"The house was clean and cute, just as described! Comfortable bed/linens and great backyard, too. We had a wonderful stay!"
3890990,50559111,2015-10-12,15608910,Jasmine,"This was such a cute house. We had a great time! The house is pretty small but it was just right for us, four adults and an infant. I can't imagine trying to fit more in that house. We loved having a kitchen, and we were pleased to find it stocked with everything we needed for a three day stay. We loved the location."
3890990,52738252,2015-11-01,6815646,Brad,Cute cottage in a great location! Everything that you need was available from the hosts and the yard was just perfect. 
3890990,53401383,2015-11-08,47654492,Kellie,"We had such a great time!  Super clean, everything we needed for a girls' weekend getaway.  Thanks Blair for maintaining such a cute place!  "
3890990,53624760,2015-11-10,43285353,钺,Good
3890990,54054924,2015-11-15,43254391,Jingjing,"This place is just like what it is described, not big but has everything we need. It is located in a very quiet street, close to SEARS. We were well received, the host was nice enough to let us check in early and leave late. "
3890990,54223268,2015-11-16,48967928,Graeme,"Very nice cottage, well setup, convenient location.  Loved Seattle!"
3890990,55762620,2015-12-05,1567332,Hanna,"The house was very clean and cute. It had everything we needed and it was close to downtown. There was 5 of us, one couple and three individuals. The host was very responsive.  It is a great place to stay and for sure we will consider in the future. "
3890990,55974792,2015-12-07,49758206,Miguel,House was perfect for our trip. We had no problems finding anything and host was very nice. 
1187735,5534001,2013-07-04,7108996,Kurtis,"The Happy House was the absolute perfect accommodation for us. Three big and beautiful rooms with nice comfy beds. We had four guests at the house and used the couch in the living room and it was also very comfortable to sleep on. Two bathrooms was a huge plus. House was clean and had lots of character. Cool little artwork all over and lots of color. Smelt nice. Lots of light. Plenty of towels. Nice linens. Great neighbourhood.

The back yard is the bell of the ball in this rental. Large, with patio lights, a fire pit, ping pong table and hot tub! For four friends looking for a nice base to see Seattle from this represented easily the best value for your dollar in the city. We had no issues getting downtown, out to Wild Waves, and easy to find some nice parks and walks close to the property.
 
Melissa nailed it, she was a great hostess. Had some issues with WiFi and Melissa went out of her way to get it back up and running for us. Melissa gave us a list of recommended restaurants with some much appreciate local insights. Communication was fast and clear, heard back from her within hours through e-mail and right away through text.

I could not have been more satisfied and the Happy House certainly lived up to its name. Highly recommended. I hope to be back. "
1187735,5943449,2013-07-23,6685826,Melanie,What a lovely house and garden!  We really enjoyed our stay and would definitely come again.
1187735,6905334,2013-08-29,2798,Ayeh,"The Happy House was the perfect pad from which to explore Seattle and surrounding areas. We loved the front yard, grill, board games and so many other thoughtful details. The house really reflects how much its been cared for and made into a place for relaxed, happy gatherings. Melissa was also a pleasure to interact with and left helpful details to make the house and the surrounding area feel like home. What a delightful stay!"
1187735,6956873,2013-09-01,6262826,Tyler,"""The Happy House"" is a perfect was to describe this place!  My family and I spent 3 wonderful days at Melissa's place and enjoyed every minute of it.  We had all sorts of things planned for our time in Seattle but found that we enjoyed our time hanging out around the house barbecuing and drinking coffee in the beautiful yard better than anything!  We had three adult couples in the house and everyone had PLENTY of room.  The house is very well stocked with kitchen appliances, bathroom amenities, and entertainment.  From a TV room stocked with DVDs to a hot tub to a ping pong table, there is more than enough to keep the whole family busy.  Melissa was great to work with and was very responsive to all of my inquiries.  She checked in to make sure everything was okay at the house but was not at all intrusive on our stay.  I would absolutely recommend The Happy House to anyone looking for a great place to stay in Seattle!  Thanks Melissa!"
1187735,7037178,2013-09-04,7536112,David,"The host was awesome and the house was perfect for our long weekend in the Seattle area.  The location is convenient to The University of Washington (5 minutes), and is a hop-skip-and-a-jump from groceries, parks, Lake Washington, I-5, etc.  

Excellent back yard with gardens; our kids spent a ton of time picking beans and squash.  And the hot tub was a nice touch.  Absolutely no complaints from our stay.

The home and experience exceeded our expectations and we will definitely book the Happy House again.

Thanks!
"
1187735,18791171,2014-09-01,6216011,Diane,"Melissa's home was clean, spacious, and fun! My husband and I stayed at there with 3 of our best couple friends for a wedding. It was wonderful to get to share a home and cook meals together for the weekend. 

The front yard is beautiful and lush, with a nice outdoor dining table under a canopy of leaves that we really enjoyed. The guys enjoyed the game room and TV lounge downstairs. The kitchen was huge and we cooked several meals in it. The bed was one of the comfiest beds I've ever been in. The inside of the house was also very uniquely and warmly decorated. 

We also loved the little details that Melissa left for us: like the Pandora player -- we played 90s hits the whole time we were there (tribute to our ""childhood"" days), and the bottle of wine (which we enjoyed). We didn't even have time to make use of the hot tub and ping pong table in the back! We will save that for the next time we visit :)"
1187735,19106478,2014-09-06,20771914,Tricia,"My only regret is that we didn't have the time to stay longer! What a remarkable, artistic, warm and inviting home. We felt welcome the moment we arrived. Melissa was so gracious in readying the house for us and communicating during our visit. The neighborhood was very convenient for us, and the house just couldn't be lovelier. I enjoyed my quiet time in the evenings out under the garden lights, with a glass of wine. We expect to be in Seattle rather often and will be booking The Happy House again!"
1187735,19319072,2014-09-10,4093926,Stanley,"Awesome house with a ton of character.

Very private lot as it has a fenced in front yard with great lounging places. We only regret not spending more time in Seattle so we could just relax at the house.

When we first arrived, the exterior decorative lights were on, which looked great.  We got the key and went in to be welcomed by a clear instructional binder, bottle of wine, chocolate, and calming music.  Very nice touch!

Everything in the house was in good condition and very well furnished with some great art everywhere.  The hot tub was pretty new and it was great having queen beds in all 4 rooms.

I would definitely stay here again next time I come back to the area."
1187735,19867205,2014-09-20,2253751,Jacob,"We rented Melissa’s happy house for 5 days.  When we arrived Melissa had soft music on; chocolates and a bottle of wine awaited us on the table.  There were clear instructions on how to use everything.  The house is very comfortable: a well-stocked kitchen where we cooked a lot of our meals; three large bedrooms and two other rooms with couches downstairs; a nice living room upstairs.  There is a beautiful yard with flowering plants, lights, and a nice covered area with a table, chairs and grill.  We cooked out and enjoyed our evenings in her beautiful yard.  In the back are a nice hot tub and a ping pong table.   We enjoyed our time at the happy house and would definitely go back again.   I would highly recommend the happy house."
1187735,21033301,2014-10-10,19744132,Sandra,"Het huis was precies zoals in de advertentie beschreven en zoals op de foto's te zien: huiselijk gezellig, en ook netjes en schoon. Het inventaris was compleet. Het enige dat ik niet kon vinden was een Theepot. De tuin was heerlijk, en ook de hottub, waar we helaas maar 1 keer tijd voor gehad hebben. Het was kil in huis toen we aankwamen, maar met de centrale verwarming en de infra rood kachels was het snel behaaglijk.
De tuinverlichting was aan, evenals wat kleine lichten in het huis, en op een whiteboard op de koelkast stond een welkomstboodschap. Op tafel stond een fles wijn en er lag een reep chocola als welkomst geschenk. Erg attent allemaal. 
Van te voren heeft de eigenaar persoonlijk contact opgenomen om te vragen of er nog vragen of wensen waren, en ze heeft haar eigen reglement en routebeschrijving gestuurd. Wel moest ik opnieuw een contract ondertekenen, dat heb ik maar gedaan. Toen we er waren, nam ze ook contact op om te horen of alles naar wens was.
Het huis ligt in een rustige zijstraat van een belangrijke verkeersader, en je bent dan ook zo bij een supermarkt of de highway. Ook het centrum is niet echt ver. In de buurt zijn niet heel veel eetgelegenheden, daarvoor moet je toch meer naar het centrum. Hoewel we bij Elliots Brewery lekker hebben gegeten, die stond ook aangeraden in het huurdersboek: boek met richtlijnen voor het huis en tips voor eten, boodschappen en trips.
Al met al een aanrader als je met meer dan 2 personen bent, en geen zin hebt in een hotel. Goedkoper is het denk ik niet echt. Ons is het heel goed bevallen, en voor herhaling vatbaar.

Sandra Schuncken en familie"
1187735,22013842,2014-10-28,2632169,Alicia,The Happy House was amazing!!  It was everything and more.  Melissa's home is so comfortable and colorfully decorated.  We will definitely be coming back.  Melissa was easy to reach and she has refined the Airbnb experience to perfection.  
1187735,22257392,2014-11-02,1353461,Nick,"Lovely place, great location, beautiful garden, spacious and homely. It was exactly what we wanted. Melissa was lovely in her communication with us."
1187735,22775755,2014-11-14,17298841,Chris,"The house was decorated in a really fun way--lots of color and lights. It felt like we were in an exotic getaway. It was also surprisingly large, which was great for our group of four to each have our own bedroom and two full baths.

My only regret is that we couldn't use the outdoor space because it was too cold. The yard is filled with lights, fountains and little intimate spaces to enjoy.

Side note: my bed downstairs was wicked comfortable--one of the best nights of sleep I've had in a while!"
1187735,24373751,2014-12-27,341501,Connie,"My family of 6 really enjoyed our stay at the happy house. Everything was very clean, the mattresses are very comfortable, and there was a lot of space. Melissa was extremely responsive and attentive to my questions even though we were there over Christmas. I would definitely stay here again!"
1187735,24700554,2015-01-02,15412962,Jo,I can't recommend this beautiful home enough. We were totally blown away by our experience. We arrived late at night to the house and garden adorned with Christmas lights. The house was so warm and clean and the beds so comfortable. We had 2 families each with 2 children and the house is bigger than it looks. Being able to spread out over the 2 levels gave everyone their own space. The location was perfect for us and Melissa was quick to respond whenever we had questions.  You will not regret choosing the Happy House for your Seattle stay! 
1187735,25451415,2015-01-16,25774179,Kristin,"My family of 5 stayed at the Oasis for a few nights last week and were very charmed by the colorful home. Everything we needed was provided for. The hot tub was perfect. Our hostess was a great communicator.

A small warning for tall people (and my family is REALLY tall with 3 over 6'6"") - the ceilings are low in this house. My sons had to duck in the kitchen, hallways and especially the basement to avoid the track lights. This won't be a problem for most people. "
1187735,25857575,2015-01-27,10999530,Nila,"My family thoroughly enjoyed the Happy House.  It truly is an Oasis with so much to offer.  The home was well kept, the kitchen had everything we could possibly need to prepare meals.  We loved the fire place, fire pit, garden, hot tub, and ping pong table.  There was lots of space and amenities to keep our busy family entertained and cozy.  I would definitely stay again!"
1187735,26308690,2015-02-09,5540836,Tamara,"We were in Seattle because our son was having major surgery. Originally we chose the Happy House because of its location and the great reviews but we would choose it again for so many more reasons! It became the gathering place for all our friends and family both before and after our son's successful surgery and it was our home base during a very stressful time. The TV room was filled to the brim on Superbowl Sunday, the spa was relaxing, the kitchen was fully stocked, the beautiful luxurious bathroom and shower downstairs was my personal retreat, the bedrooms were large and the beds were so comfortable, and I loved all the lights around the yard! There are games, movies, a ping pong table, a bar-b-que, and a great yard - she even has beach towels for the spa! From the minute we got there (the wine and chocolate waiting for us were delicious!) to the time we left, our stay was amazing! Melissa is a great host and we highly recommend her and the Happy House!"
1187735,27081733,2015-02-24,14906619,Zac,"wow what a fun place. we travel for work and stay at many places most of the time valuing the beds over everything else but with a ping pong table, a great yard, and a hot tub it was just too tempting not to relax a little more than usual. One of our guys said it was visually fun to walk around and look at all the different pieces of art.  Couldn't ask for much more, she was even nice enough to get everything ready on a very short notice for us. Thanks again we will be back if work bring us near hear again."
1187735,28020859,2015-03-16,25972196,Shumin,Melissa is wonderful host. She make our stay wonderful experience and the house is better than listed. She give all the detail of the house and surroundings. her game room is the best for our boys. Thank you again Mellissa
1187735,29941757,2015-04-14,9575464,Felipe,"I have no words to describe how amazing was our experience at Happy House (the wine and chocolate waiting for us were delicious!). The house is better than listed, the kitchen was fully stocked, we loved the front yard, grill, TV room stocked with DVDs, the beds was one of the comfiest beds I've ever been in, the inside of the house was also very unique and warmly decorated. It was everything and more.

Melissa is a great host and we highly recommend her and the Happy House! I would definitely stay again!"
1187735,30232669,2015-04-19,28282085,Sara Jane,This was a lovely space and truly a retreat with easy access to all the city has to offer.  The attention to detail was fantastic and we truly felt rested and taken care of in this space.  I would highly recommend this house!
1187735,31317449,2015-05-04,22510864,Kaityrose,"This was the perfect vacation rental, period. The pictures looked great, but as soon as we walked through the gate and felt the warmth of the garden space I knew I'd found the right spot for a friends/family gathering. The house opens up nicely from the front entrances and each room has enough space for a couple. I just can't get over it - the decor, the garden, each room and bathroom were beautiful with extra linens, soaps and shampoos; the outdoors were just as enticing. The firewood was stocked and hot tub was ready, and we had fun walking around the yard identifying the vegetation. The location is great, too. We made it to a concert 15 minutes away, the beach, about 20 and hit the Chihuly Garden on the way out of town. You can tell Melissa enjoys setting the tone for an enjoyable space. It was a perfect weekend and I can't wait to go back!"
1187735,32004254,2015-05-12,29296715,Nan,"I can not say enough about how much this home and all the wonderful amenities and atmosphere contributed to a fantastic weekend in Seattle for my daughter's graduation from Cornish.  Wonderful location, easy to get around, a lovely whimsical decor, beautiful outdoor space to enjoy (hard to say which we enjoyed more, the hot tub, ping pong table, or sitting in the flowers listening to the fountain.) Parking was easy, Melissa gave great directions, a bottle of wine and chocolate waiting for us, she had personal follow up with us during our stay if we had any questions, and made us feel welcomed in every way.  The house was spotless, beds oh so comfy, very quiet, peaceful.  I would stay here again in a heartbeat, and feel totally comfortable recommending to family and friends!  Thanks, Melissa!"
1187735,33219761,2015-05-26,3150082,Kathy,"Our family group of 11, five of whom stayed at Melissa's house, were in Seattle for a graduation. The age range was 18 to 77. We wanted a comfortable, relaxing, family-friendly location, away from the city center, to enjoy before and after the graduation ceremony which was held downtown. Melissa's lovely home and spacious yard worked great for us. We really enjoyed having this home for a graduation party and dinner. (Ping Pong table!!! Yay.) We all had a wonderful time. We utilized all four bedrooms. Every bed and bedroom is comfortable, clean and inviting. Having two bathrooms is great and the downstairs bathroom is beautifully tiled and very convenient. Melissa is fantastic to communicate with and had the house in perfect condition when we arrived, including congratulatory notes and wine and chocolate. Thank you, Melissa! Thanks to you, we have wonderful memories of this special time in our family's life."
1187735,49230364,2015-10-02,17269868,Simona,"Melissa's house was a gem! I'm really glad we found this house on Airbnb, it was nice and clean and spacious, we have a group of 6, it works very well, the hot tub was enjoyable, the yard was well maintained! Overall it was so nice of an experience, next time if we go to Seattle we would definitely stay there again! Highly recommended!!!!!"
1187735,49593690,2015-10-05,34368222,Katie,"What a great home. It truly felt like an urban oasis. Melissa was out of town at the time we stayed in her house, but she still made sure to communicate regularly and that we had everything we needed. The house was clean and comfortable. The house fit our large group wonderfully and was a great place for kids as well as adults."
1187735,50453318,2015-10-12,1158879,Rowan,"Melissa's wonderful house was exactly what we needed. We are a group of athletes who competed at a physically demanding event in town and the house allowed us to rest, recover and fuel up, while also providing perfect social space for us after the day's activities. There is way more space than you see in the pictures - the house comes with lots of hidden rooms to relax in, dump the kids in, take a nap in... whatever. The garden and hot tub are exceptional too. All of this and a lovely wine and chocolate welcome. Thanks Melissa!!!!!"
1187735,51438834,2015-10-20,2096880,Faye,"Melissa made us feel so welcome from the local wine and delicious chocolate to the clean, fresh, beautiful accommodations, and nice music that greeted us when we walked in!  We did not meet her but she was great at communicating with us and making sure we had everything we needed.  The neighborhood was really pretty and quiet with easy access to all the places we wanted to go.  Melissa's home is such a neat place with cool art, a gorgeous garden, luxurious hot tub and really nice bathrooms (she even had nice shampoo and conditioner) and bedrooms.  The beds were very comfortable and beautifully made.  We felt very spoiled and well taken care of.  I would absolutely stay here again and would recommend this place to my friends.  (from my husband:  I like the way the house feels very private without making you feel closed off)0 Thanks Melissa!  "
1187735,53464572,2015-11-09,30800355,Kyle,"Melissa's Happy House was amazing. We came as a group of 8, and it was perfect - inviting, cozy, vibrant, and plenty of space. The kitchen had all of the tools to cook a great meal, the beds were super comfy, and the hot tub is a great bonus (goes without saying). We already want to come back for the summer. 

Melissa was incredibly friendly and helpful. Can't recommend Melissa and this place enough!"

7809494,45152992,2015-08-31,5066739,Amy,Steven was a wonderful host. He took time out of his day to show me around Seattle. His apartment is in a prime location walking distance to many site seeing areas. I would definetly recommend anyone staying at his place. 
7809494,46977080,2015-09-14,22826964,Kelsey,"We stayed one night here on our weekend trip to Seattle and Steve made our stay very easy and convenient, even though we never actually crossed paths with him. He left detailed instructions about how to get in, he was easy to contact and responded quickly to text messages and phone calls when trying to arrange arrival and departure details.

7809494,48935160,2015-09-29,43612865,Rose,"Steven is such a great host! He literally SAVED me from the bad luck I was having trying to find a place less than two weeks from my trip. He was so laid-back, friendly, and quick to respond. He also helped me understand how Airbnb works in terms of the whole phone number and email policy. 

I really enjoyed his communication. As long as you let him know what you need, he will take care of it for you. I also appreciated his detailed instructions on how to get into his house. I ran into him while visiting the Fremont Troll and he took some pictures for me and my boyfriend, and asked us if we wanted to join him for some coffee and explore the neighborhood. If we weren't on such a tight schedule, I would've gone!

His apartment was spotless, had clean sheets and towels, partially open closet space, computer hooked up to a giant tv screen, perfect temperature rooms, ironing board, etc. and don't even get me started on the view. He has three HUGE windows going around the perimeter of the common area and it was beautiful. The location was about a mile from Pike Place Market and the rest of downtown. Very easy walk! 

Bonus points: I don't think Steven usually offers his parking spot, but since he was gone that weekend, he told us that we could park our rental there. I also really appreciated the pamphlets that he collected throughout the city including a few free 3-day gym passes to a place down the street. 

If I'm ever in Seattle again, I will definitely hit up Steven. It was such a pleasant experience :)

The apartment is wonderful, and everything that previous guests have mentioned -- attractive, clean and comfortable. We are a family of four and this worked very well for us. There are plenty of restaurants and coffee shops in the neighborhood, a Whole Foods a couple of blocks away, and a great Saturday farmers' market within walking distance. Parking was easy, as was access to the highway, mass transit and bike paths. I highly recommend this listing!"
4820795,38115145,2015-07-13,11947788,Gabe And Joslyn,"This place was AMAZING! Super clean and comfy. We Loved the space, and it is right below their house but we could not hear them at all. Lee was  a awesome host but we did not see them alot since we were busy with a wedding. We even got there earlier than expected and they were ready for us."
4820795,39028930,2015-07-20,35170503,Beth,"Our small family really enjoyed staying here while we attended a friend's wedding and went sight-seeing in Seattle. The location was great--the street itself was quiet yet it was close to everything. There is a fun park down the street, and my husband and I both enjoyed running to and around Green Lake. The lake is less than a mile away, so about 4.5 miles round-trip. Hosts were accommodating and quiet upstairs. The basement apartment was clean, bright, and temperate even though we were there on one unusually hot day. We'd recommend this place!"
4820795,40266318,2015-07-29,11737794,Leah,"Really great, private place. Very nice folks. Very comfortable and clean."
4820795,40919550,2015-08-03,9252337,Aurelia,"We had a wonderful three nights at Lee's basement apartment.  This was a perfect place to land after days exploring Seattle with my two daughters.  The apartment is comfortable, very clean and well organized.  Cozy, comfy bed and nice linens in the bedroom.  We used one of the air mattresses which worked great and was comfortable.  Kitchen has everything you need to put together a basic meal.  Lee was great with communication and gave wonderful restaurant recommendations for the area.  The house is in a sweet neighborhood which felt very safe and easy driving or bus distance to whatever you want to do in Seattle.  The kids loved the nearby park.  I liked being able to walk to groceries, restaurants, coffee, and the park."
4820795,43377954,2015-08-19,438043,Elizabeth,"I booked this suite for 5  nights and my daughter and I used it as a 'base' as she re-settled in Seattle after spending two years out of the country. The location was excellent, with easy access to downtown, a Starbuck's 1/2 block away and Whole Foods around the corner.

The suite itself was perfect for our needs with both a kitchen and laundry facilities (soap provided). On our arrival we were also greeted with a bottle of wine and there was enough coffee to get us through the first couple of days. 

We did not meet our hosts, but certainly could have contacted them if we had needed to. We have stayed in several airbnb's and this was one of the best in terms of price and amenities.
"
4820795,44671117,2015-08-28,39527934,Terrence,"The listing described the room very well. I slept on the ""extra"" air bed, and found it quite comfortable. The neighborhood was very nice. The kitchen utensils and appliances were fine. The host and his wife were friendly and helpful. I would stay there again. This was my first AirBNB experience."
4820795,47188464,2015-09-16,18842938,Holly,"We had a great stay here! The apartment was really nice, we felt welcomed, and the location was perfect for us. The house is on a quiet residential street but it's less than a 5 minute walk to shops, restaurants, a Whole Foods, and an express bus to downtown Seattle. I highly recommend this apartment!"
4820795,49625042,2015-10-05,33906416,Nina,"This is my second stay at this location and I love it! It is so convenient to my son and his family that I can walk to visit them.  After a busy day with the grandchildren I can come back and relax in my own apartment. It is clean, quiet, and comfortable and the host are great. It is also a short walk to Whole Foods, Starbucks and other shops. I plan to stay there again on my next trip to Seattle."
4820795,50963337,2015-10-16,38600126,Joseph,Very nice spot. Rebooked after first day. 
4820795,53262099,2015-11-07,11044853,Ann,"This apartment was perfect for us!  My husband and I were visiting my son, daughter-in-law and grandson, who live one block away.  We know the neighborhood a bit and Lee and Katie's place is a short walk from parks, stores, restaurants and pubic transportation.  We had a car, for which Lee provided a guest parking pass.  There was never a problem finding a spot very close.  

The place itself is spotlessly clean, comfortably furnished, the TV and wifi worked perfectly.  A bottle of wine welcomed us, along with coffee for the coffee maker.  All the tools needed to cook are provided, should you wish to prepare your own meals or just a cup of tea.  The king-size bed is luxuriously comfortable and warm (it was a chilly, rainy stay for us).  

The hosts are very responsive to questions or needs (e.g., more paper towels).  The are delightful and did everything possible to make our stay feel as if we were their honored guests. And they have nice standard poodle, who also welcomed us.

I plan to return and hope to stay in Lee's apartment bnb again."
4820795,56312992,2015-12-12,38876252,Brenda,"They say you can't go home again...What a great place, amazing location, with attentive and friendly hosts. We used to live in the same neighborhood when we lived in Seattle and it really felt like I was home.

The description is accurate.  The accommodations are perfectly appointed, very quiet and comfy.  Never had trouble finding parking right in front of the house and I got to practice my ""big city"" parallel parking! 

Very important to me as I was traveling on business is internet access and the wireless was flawless as well.

I wanted to stay longer!"
6813483,38782498,2015-07-18,5537965,Greg,"I had a wonderful stay at Beverly's place.  It is quaint and charming she is a lovely host.  It was fun to be in the Ballard near the water.  I enjoyed taking in all the fine restaurants available near by.  There a nice neighborhood areas to talk walks in.  

"
6813483,39438621,2015-07-23,3906855,Cheryl,"Earlier this week I had the pleasure of spending a night in this lovely home in the Ballard neighborhood of Seattle. The accommodations were as described, and the photos don't really do justice to the charm of this apartment. The kitchen was well stocked, and I felt really at home here. "
6813483,44485483,2015-08-26,7784584,Daniel,"We had a great time staying in this beautiful Ballard home.  We found it so easy to get around this area- the house is very walkable to Old Ballard, Golden Gardens, and other Seattle neighborhoods.  Bev was extremely attentive and helpful, flexible with the meeting time, and so kind with all the extra amenities (like snacks and staples in the kitchen.)   Plus, the fruits and veggies in her garden are amazing!  We deeply appreciate how she made us feel at home during our stay!"
6813483,45386173,2015-09-02,38454791,Sandra,"It was just as described! We loved the layout and was just the right size, actually bigger than anticipated. Bev was most helpful with her suggestions and her special touches appreciated! good location also - great stay!"
6813483,46064999,2015-09-07,3751912,Chaney,"Loved the plumbs, tomatoes and all the extras you left us. That was perfect and helped make our stay a little easier. Great location and walkable to all the shops and businesses in downtown Ballard. Would definitely come back!"
6813483,46888920,2015-09-14,38787209,John,"Beverly Sanders was or is the perfect hostess. She met me at the lovely Victorian house at the agreed on time of arrival, with a nice welcome and a big smile on her face. showed me around and explained everything that I needed to know for my stay.

The location was perfect since I was visiting friends in the Ballard area. I could walk to wherever I needed to go, except for touring the area in my friends car.
It was a most enjoyable stay and everything was just as nice as advertised on Airbub!!

Beverly is a great host and very responsive should you need anything.  This apartment is located very close to the town of Ballard and that makes it even more special!  Thanks again for a very comfortable stay!"
6813483,51339035,2015-10-19,22823260,Jim And Star,"My experience was fantastic. My host was present, accurate and available. The space was ready, with all one could ask for and more. My host gave me a tour, and I adored this special space from the moment I stepped in the door. Very clean, very comfortable, safe, convenient and full of charm and delight. I especially loved your guidance to the views and the local gems, such as the bakery...all the perfect stroll from the patio. Thank you Beverly for opening your little space in heaven in Seattle-Ballard.
In appreciation and hope to visit again one day, star  "
6813483,51990019,2015-10-25,11218058,Dan,"This place is really nice!  It's spacious, clean, well kept and cozy.  It's even a lot closer to the main drag of Ballard than I initially thought (ten minutes or less walking).  Beverly was a nice host.  We only saw her upon checking in, but she was very responsive to texts and even provided aspirin when my girlfriend had a headache.  We would definitely stay here again!"
6813483,57437822,2015-12-26,3417855,Sarah,"Beverly was attentive, to make sure that we had everything that we needed, but not intrusive. The apartment was spacious, with a wonderful kitchen, which we enjoyed doing a bit of holiday baking in. There were fixings for multiple breakfasts and morning coffee. We enjoyed that a lot."
6716874,35852243,2015-06-22,16273302,Kadie,We had a great stay. Thomas & John were fabulous hosts. The space was beautiful & clean (it's brand new)! And the bed was very comfortable. I am planning on staying with them again the next time I go to Seattle!
6716874,36819660,2015-07-01,36086479,Bobby (Wing),"The host Thomas was wonderful and delightful. The area was lovely with a beautiful side back grade view. The place was clean and neat. Thomas was very helpful with tips about traveling in the city. 
Very Accommodating! They are fast in response if you ever need anything.
I have negative to say about this stay.
They even came to say good bye to me before I left.  "
6716874,38294182,2015-07-14,8658428,Michelle,"Thomas and John left a sweet note on the refrigerator. There is coffee or Tea available in the apartment to get your day started. The bedding is very comfortable. 

We felt more like family visiting then guests renting a space. 

Plus... They have the most amazing pup in the planet! "
6716874,39184063,2015-07-21,35605561,Frauke,Wir hatten eine super schöne Zeit in Seattle! Die beiden Gastgeber sind total gastfreundlich und wir haben uns im Apartment sehr wohl gefühlt. Ein besonderes Highlight ist der Blick auf den See! Wir haben unseren Aufenthalt sehr genossen. 
6716874,39675672,2015-07-25,1499027,James,"aside from this being my favorite neighborhood in all Seattle (Mt. Baker, Lakewood, Columbia City area) Tom's property is fantastic. Just a few blocks from Lake Washington, Seward Park and the commercial area of Columbia City the neighborhood is as amenity rich as anywhere in the region. The unit was nearly brand new and very tastefully done. Would stay here again and recommend to friends/family to do the same. Great hosts, beautiful property, awesome value...need I say more?"
6716874,39948556,2015-07-27,35438742,Jesse,"We had a great time staying at Tom, John, and Buster's newly renovated suite.  These guys are super friendly, and Buster is a big suck (we wanted to take him home with us).  The suite was super clean, quiet, and was only a short walk from great brunch spots and the light rail to downtown.  Would love to stay in the Airstream sometime too!  We look forward to staying with them again, just hope we can get in, as its booking up very quick for the rest of the Summer."
6716874,40338513,2015-07-30,5776327,Jonica,Good experience the host were friendly and the location made it easy to get to downtown Seattle.  
6716874,40943607,2015-08-03,36887432,Peter,"This was the first Airbnb experience for me and I was pleasantly surprised at how easy it was to book a great place to stay. This year I volunteered as patrol skipper for Seafair, which also was a first. Thomas's apartment is literally a 10 minute walk right to the pits at Genessee Park. For those not familiar with Seattle, Seafair is a 10 week festival with races and lots of stuff to do.  It was super hot this year and it was such a pleasure to have the family come home to a clean, wonderfully appointed and air conditioned apartment. The house is newly renovated with a wonderful garden and sits majestically on a hill overlooking Lake Washington. Plenty of parking to my utter amazement as a Seattle resident.  There is easy walking access to swim or boat on the lake or just hang out near the water. Plenty of nice places to walk to right from the house, including Seward Park which still has old growth trees. Tons of restaurants and easy access to downtown Seattle.  This  home will give a very distinctive Northwest experience. "
6716874,42531294,2015-08-14,35259433,Christian,"Very nice basement apartment, perfect for a base to explore Seattle and the surrounding area by. Would definitely stay here again."
6716874,43497266,2015-08-20,21451239,Leslie,"This was a great place to stay. Tom and John were great hosts. They took care of any concern rapidly. The apartment was very neat, clean and well appointed-just perfect. The bathroom was like an upscale hotel. The apartment is close to Washington Lake and good places to eat. Parking was on a hill( not unusual for Seattle) but it was a quiet street and close to the door and always available. This all worked very well and we hope to stay there again. "
6716874,44143215,2015-08-24,37940622,Chelsea,"This was truly our home away from home! Tom and Buster Brown were great hosts. This was our first time using Airbnb and we were truly impressed with the daylight apartment. This is a great neighborhood, close to parks and the lake; we did a lot of walking at night and felt safe. The apartment was clean and had more amenities than the 4-star hotel we stayed in during our last (extended) night in Seattle. We will definitely be returning guests. "
6716874,47517230,2015-09-19,42835381,Lisa,"My first experience as an Airbnb'r and I absolutely loved it!
I am a travel writer and initially, I was in the Seattle area to review 3 separate hotels.  While, my stay at the hotels was great, absolutely nothing beats my stay at Thomas' home.  
The room was modern yet cozy with no detail left undone.  Immaculately clean with the comfort of home.  I promise, it was so hard to come back home (lol).
The neighborhood is charming and easily accessible to everyting Seattle. I especially enjoyed the walk to the park and to the lake. 

Having traveled and stayed in high-end luxury hotels, this experience has been the most memorable thus far.  Thank you for the hospitality! I already miss you guys - and Buster too!
"
6716874,47986108,2015-09-22,5938187,Brad,"Staying with Tom, John and Buster was great! The apartment is very clean and had everything we needed to make our stay very comfortable. It is in a great location and was very easy to get to everything we wanted to see / do while we were in Seattle.

We never actually got to meet Tom, John or Buster because our schedules never really lined up but Tom was very quick to respond to any messages and made sure we had everything we needed. "
6716874,49551138,2015-10-04,40829365,Francisco,"This was our first experience using Airbnb and we definitely loved staying at the Daylight apartment. Tom was very welcoming  and offered to help us as with our moving in to Seattle.
The apartment is great, it is big, modern, really comfortable and clean. 
Tom introduced us to the beautiful neighborhood and invited us for a walk with Buster. It is also very close to the lake and park which is excellent if you get sunny days. 
Totally recommended, Tom, John an Buster are great hosts! 
"
6716874,51040051,2015-10-17,13360740,Katie,"What a lovely space! Walks, view, and everything I needed in the cozy space. "
6716874,52863649,2015-11-02,6903955,Scott,"This was a wonderful experience with the neighborhood, host, and space all being equally great. Tom checked in on us to make sure there was nothing we needed during our visit, and both Tom and John were extremely welcoming. We took some of the recommendations listed in their book for dining, and felt like they included great places which gave us a real sense of  Columbia City. 

The space itself was roomy, comfortable and very clean.  It was perfect for the two of us.  We would love to stay there again and explore a little more of their immediate neighborhood and take advantage of the path that goes around the lake by their home.

They indulged us by answering many ""Airstream questions"" we had about their experiences and knowledge.  We thoroughly enjoyed our time there and found them to be great hosts. "
6716874,53207198,2015-11-06,13360740,Katie,"Wonderful stay, wonderful place. Love the view of the lake! "
6716874,54065391,2015-11-15,3404314,Cindy,"We loved Tom's apartment! and even extended our stay for two extra days. The apartment is designed with love--it is beautiful and comfortable. The Mt Baker neighborhood has lovely Craftsman-style houses and tree-lined streets and its own small downtown (Mioposto Pizzaria is a favorite restaurant), and is within walking distance of downtown Columbia City, full of cute shops and great restaurants. There is easy access to the bus and light rail into Seattle (and to the airport). As happy as we were with the accommodations themselves, the best part of our stay was Tom. He is a lovely person--interesting and helpful, while also respectful of our privacy. While we generally prefer minimal contact with our Airbnb hosts, this was the exception--we always enjoyed running into Tom and Buster as we came and went on our various adventures. We look forward to returning!"
6716874,54467900,2015-11-20,12485935,Phoebe,"Very nice clean daylight basement apartment.  We met Tom who was very nice, friendly, and accommodating. He offered that we contact him if we need anything including for our 3 month old daughter. Great views of Lake Washington and an easy walk. Very nice neighborhood with beautiful homes. Short drive to Columbia City. "
6716874,55104973,2015-11-28,1241431,Erik,Great location and lovely basement studio unit. Walking distance to Lake Washington with transit nearby. Thomas was attentive and welcoming.

We found it very clean and comfortable and felt at home during our stay here.  J.D. was quick to respond and gave clear, simple instructions when necessary.  We would definitely stay here again."
6823597,38300083,2015-07-14,721098,Luke,"J.D.'s place was great. It was close to a ton of amenities, cafes, restaurants, bars, etc, but was never too loud to sleep or anything. We were worried about his place warming up with the muggy weather outside, but because he has so many windows in his place, we were able to keep a nice cross-breeze going and it cool inside. His bed was especially comfortable, making for nice and easy sleeps. His place was very clean and comfortable; he even left out a small stereo adapter for us to hook our phone up to his sound system. Very cool.

J.D. also left us a bottle of Prosecco in the fridge, making us feel extra welcome."

The apartment is within walking distance to a huge number of bars and restaurants. Communication with JD leading up to the stay was great and the check in/check-out process was very smooth and easy. JD was very accommodating and we had a great weekend in Seattle; I'd recommend this listing to anyone. "
6823597,39061032,2015-07-20,3353808,Tara,"J.D.'s apartment is in a great location in Capitol Hill. During our stay, we used Uber to get around, though it seemed like there were several buses nearby. His place is clean and comfortable, and he even left a bottle of Secco in the fridge for us to enjoy. J.D. was quick to communicate, and all of our interactions were pleasant. I'd recommend his place while you're in Seattle!"
6823597,39405706,2015-07-23,19331094,Shaun,"Great place to stay in a really cool area of Seattle. The location of J.D.'s apartment was fantastic, right near the main strip of restaurants, bars, and activity in Capital hill, but still very quiet and peaceful. The apartment is very nice, big and open, with a comfortable bed and very clean and welcoming space. And J.D. was great, super helpful and welcoming. We would highly recommend this airbnb!"

6823597,40338113,2015-07-30,35826198,Jessica,"What a gem of a place, and a perfect launchpad for all that Seattle has to offer.  We stayed for three nights at the end of a camping trip, so the dedicated parking spot was a lifesaver with our car full of stuff. The apartment has tons of character and the furniture was both charming and comfortable. The kitchen is super well-stocked, and there's a huge 24-hr grocery store a block away. Cap Hill has more to offer-- coffee, craft cocktails, nightlife, etc... and J.D. leaves some helpful recommendations. 

We never met J.D. in person, but he responded almost instantly to all of our questions, and getting in and out was a breeze. 

"
6823597,40609296,2015-08-01,36218310,Holly,"We had a wonderful stay at J.D's mid-century modern apartment! J.D. communicated well and answered our text messages promptly and courteously. We had no problems getting in and everything was as we expected (or better) from the online photos and reviews. We loved the apartment as it was large, clean, comfortable and had a complete kitchen. It is located on an oasis of sorts, with large 50-plus-year-old trees all around. (Rather unusual for a city location!) The trees, combined with cross ventilation and fans kept the apartment cool on a few very hot days. We easily found food supplies at the well-stocked QFC, a block away.  Also convenient, was bus transportation to the Space Needle on bus #8, one street over. From the apartment we could enjoy the street life without it being intrusive. Listening to classical music on the phonograph was especially pleasing. Nearby there are all kinds of restaurants and shops! One we enjoyed was Bleu Bistro's Grotto. The bartender was friendly, the food and drink good and it had overall nice atmosphere. Another favorite place, but not to eat, was the Capitol branch of the Seattle Public Library, just a few doors down. We found plenty of maps, transportation guides, newspapers and other things to read. For work purposes, we needed a computer, fax and copier, and found them all there. The A.C. proved to be an unexpected bonus! We later visited the downtown, main library. It is an architectural marvel, don't miss it! Many thanks to J.D. for his hospitality and the nice bottle of wine. We will be back, soon we hope!"
6823597,41771497,2015-08-09,20337730,Callie,"We had a great time at J.D.'s place! J.D. is super nice and very responsive. His place is clean, spacious, and has everything you need. The apartment is located close to tons of bars, restaurants, and coffee shops in Capitol Hill. It's easy to get to other parts of Seattle from his place, too. The busses are close and easy to use or it's a short Uber ride to downtown. I would definitely stay at J.D.'s place again and I recommend it to anyone! "
6823597,42459793,2015-08-13,3751819,Rakhsita,"The apartment is in a great location, walking distance from tons of great bars, restaurants, coffee shops. We got around using the bus and uber. We rented a car for one day to head to Olympic national park so the parking spot was a huge plus. 
The apartment is incredidbly clean and cute. The bed was super comfortable.  We didn't get to meet JD but he was always quick to respond to our texts with any questions we had. "
6823597,42878939,2015-08-16,37184800,Ed,"The location is great and the apartment is very spacious. Everything was clean and as advertised. The neighborhood has so much to offer we found ourselves hanging out there every night. 
It felt very professional and I would recommend the apartment to a friend if they were visiting.

6823597,44126643,2015-08-24,8332989,Robert,"JD was an excellent host and the apartment was beautiful. JD was very responsive and communication was a breeze. The apartment is perfectly located in the middle of Capitol Hill, close to lots of great coffee shops and nightlife. I would highly recommend JD and his place in Capitol Hill to anyone staying in Seattle. "
6823597,45260658,2015-09-01,23085466,Micheal,"Check in and out was painless, though we have preferred it in the past when the host arrives for a guided tour of the house and explanation of where things are stored, and any quirks of the property. 

The apartment is in an excellent location, and we found ourselves able to walk to the Washington State Convention Center. There are a lot of grocery stores and bars/restaurants nearby so we could see someone with more time and money having a great time exploring the local culinary scene.

The apartment is very well decorated, and is in reasonable repair. The building itself seems old though, and there were some issues with the apartment like sticky doors and mould in the bathroom roof that come as par for the course for a building of it's age.

All in all a great location at a great price, it would serve well for anyone looking to go out and explore the sights of Seattle, and suited the two of us while we were attending a convention about half an hours walk away.  "
7922013,58475501,2016-01-02,26276089,Jessica,Had a wonderful stay! Mehrit was a wonderful host. Got us everything we needed and made us feel at home! Thank you! 
3926008,18635624,2014-08-29,12938262,Alan,"Sasha has a well-kept and cozy apartment in an amazing area of Capitol Hill.  Just steps from lots of great restaurants, bars and of course coffee shops.  Also, just around the corner from amazing Volunteer Park.  We very much enjoyed our stay and would certainly take the opportunity to stay again!  Thanks much Sasha."
3926008,18843681,2014-09-01,20352881,Jill,"Sasha was an excellent host. She provided us with a clear and accurate description of the location and how to enter the unit since she wasn't going to be there. Left a very thorough write up regarding things to know about her place as well as sites and attractions to see and do while in town and that was very thoughtful. We didn't see the other tenants of the house once, which she mentioned we may or may not. The neighborhood was a great location, with 10.00 rides downtown and uber drivers readily available.

The chocolates on our clean towels was a charming touch. The breakfast food (while we did not utilize) and the bottle of wine she mentioned we could drink (which we did utilize) were both above and beyond expectations.

Overall, our stay was very pleasant and the house is very charming just as pictured. Thanks Sasha for a great stay!"
3926008,19634413,2014-09-15,3258342,Daniel,"Sasha's home is wonderful! The pictures really don't do it justice. It's a very cute arts & crafts home on a beautiful, quiet, tree lined street. 1 block from shops and restaurants in Capitol Hill, but tucked away. Sitting on the front porch in the morning, it's easy to feel like a Seattle resident on a staycation instead of a tourist. As a host, Sasha was very communicative and reliable. She responded promptly to all our emails and left us english muffins and a bottle of wine in the fridge! Also her cat Zoe, is awesome and incredibly friendly! I would highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a relaxing home away from home in Seattle. "
3926008,19993293,2014-09-21,639390,Ari,"Amazing, wonderful neighborhood, beautiful comfortable home. A dream "
3926008,21935230,2014-10-26,21707506,Kyle,"A friend and I stayed at Sasha's place for a few days a semi spontaneous trip to Seattle. We booked the place with only a few hours notice. But Sasha responded to us immediately and was very accommodating to our late request. 

Her house is very charming and quaint, with a sweet back porch and nice views of the tree lined street. She provided coffee, beer, and wine.  Even better, her driveway provided an otherwise difficult to find parking spot.

There are other residents that live inside the house – some in the basement and something upstairs apartment - that have access to the me. We did meet the upstairs neighbor and found him very friendly and helpful."
3926008,22559715,2014-11-09,23220666,Catherine,"We had a lovely time at Sasha's! Her little kitty made it a home away from home and we were thankful for the great host touches like leaving wine and beer for us! Thanks so much Sasha for making our first airbnb experience so easy and enjoyable! We'll definitely look up your place next time we need to stay in the area =).

Cheers!"
3926008,22634114,2014-11-10,3116489,Jenny,"This is a great rental! Though we didn't meet, Sasha was both responsive and gave us all the info we need to stay at her place hassle-free. It's a great space with plenty of room for two people. It was so nice to spend the rest of our trip in a home, so much more relaxing than a hotel! The Capitol Hill area is fabulous with super cute restaurants and really amazing mixologists. Sasha's place was walking distance to everywhere we wanted to be, but tucked away enough to enjoy the beauty of the Pacific Northwest! Thanks!"
3926008,23141225,2014-11-23,2749778,Georges," The apartment is beautiful and in a great location. The decor is really welcoming and the back deck is great!

Sasha was very responsive and the entire process was very organized. We had no problems or concerns whatsoever.

We would definitely stay here again. Highly recommended."
3926008,26573727,2015-02-15,23354137,Kristopher,"The space was very beautiful and served us very well for our stay. We really appreciate Sasha's flexibility in our check in check out times. 

Great record player, great albums. Great coffee, great snacks."
3926008,28370265,2015-03-22,29542072,Charday,"Sasha's place was definitely a fun environment for a weekend get away. It was nice to be close enough to the city without dealing with being in the heart of it. Zoe the cat is very friendly. I rarely saw the others that lived on the top and bottom floors of the house. They were very friendly the few times I saw them. The roommate downstairs sometimes comes into the kitchen, I thought it'd be awkward at first but he was very nice and only used the kitchen once to quickly grab something. Overall I had a great experience there, I would stay there again. "
3926008,28749088,2015-03-29,1030467,Tu,"Great location and quiet neighborhood, but very close to everything around the capital hill/volunteer park area. Sasha was very communicative prior to and throughout our stay at her space. Unfortunately the bedroom had a lingering cat pee smell that was never resolved. All in all, 3.5 out of 5 for our stay"
3926008,29769790,2015-04-12,25721267,Lianne,This was a great Airbnb experience. The home had a good feel to it with fun books to browse through. It is in a good location with a driveway. Sasha was easy to communicate with and the manual she prepared was of good help. 
3926008,30246805,2015-04-19,9155664,Jacob,"Sasha's house was great. Very peaceful and calming, with a beautiful kitchen and lovely backyard area. It was helpful to have a driveway to use and the breakfast goodies were nice to have as well! "
3926008,32430856,2015-05-17,5089187,Lúcio,"Wonderful Seattle suburb house in the heart of the city, great location and a great company who comes along: Zoe, the lady cat. Sasha let us comfortable at home and made herself available for any needs necessary. I would love to go back to Seattle some other time in and stay at the same place."
3926008,33146415,2015-05-25,26059810,Amber,"First Sasha was a great host, I couldn't have asked for better. The house was amazing, neat, clean and had all the amenities ones could need. It was a really cozy experience, close to many local conveniences and city attractions.  The other tenants above and below were quiet, though it might have been nice to chat them up a bit. :)  I'd definitely come back and stay here again. Thanks so much Sasha!"
3926008,34965355,2015-06-14,2268502,Scott,"Sasha was great. Left some snacks in the kitchen, enough pillows/blankets, etc. "
3926008,35484408,2015-06-19,18946957,Jennifer,"Sasha was quick to respond to all inquiries and gave great instructions for checking in.  The location is in a beautiful quiet area with coffee shops, restaurants and cool shops just a short walk away. Thanks for sharing your cozy space!"
3926008,36016699,2015-06-24,31248065,Kullan,"We stayed at Sasha's place for 5 nights. It could not have been a more perfect place. The kitchen had all necessary amenities. The bathroom was great (especially the towels!) and the location could not have been better.

I would love to stay here again."
3926008,36561264,2015-06-29,34477765,Erin,"Beautiful house, cool neighborhood, sweet cat hostess "
3926008,37325466,2015-07-06,21377779,Katherine,"Great spot! The neighborhood was very walkable with great shops and restaurants. The house is charming and has lots of character. It is very open and has all of the amenities that you could need! Seattle is unusually hot this summer, so it got a little toasty in the house, but that is out of Sasha's control. The only issue regarding this was that we wanted to sleep with the bedroom door open to increase airflow... since the kitchen and main entrance are shared by the upstairs and downstairs tenants this made sleeping with the door open uncomfortable. Other than that, we had a wonderful stay in Seattle and would recommend this place to anyone."
3926008,39023553,2015-07-20,9351382,David,We had a great time in Seattle thanks to Sasha's cozy place. It was very accommodating and all that we thought it would be. The neighborhood was nice and we had and all around great experience.
3926008,39921502,2015-07-27,32275474,Patrick,"Sasha was great and easy to get in touch with.  She was flexible on our check in check out times which was great as we had a late flight out.  The house is incredibly convenient to a full grocery store and multiple bars, restaurants and coffee shops.  Less than 2 blocks.  Kitchen was well appointed and there was cold beer in the fridge when we arrived.  Great experience!"
3926008,42127208,2015-08-11,3061474,Lauren,"Very nice place in a great location--3 blocks to grocery and drug store, restaurants, etc. Sasha was very quick to respond to questions. Zoe (the cat) was super sweet and cuddly and mostly just slept all day. I did see the downstairs tenant once or twice a day, but he was friendly and usually running out the door."
3926008,43418266,2015-08-19,12786440,Renee,"We had a lovely stay. The apartment is nice and comfortable and we felt welcome. We have cat companions and are cat lovers so we were so happy to have the company of the resident cat Zoe. She is very sweet and will cuddle but is not at all in the way or underfoot. The neighborhood of Capitol Hill is lovely and there are plenty of lovely places near by to eat. Yoga studio around the corner, coffee shops around. The nearby restaurant Monsoon is really terrific."
3926008,44153821,2015-08-24,6104816,Marco,"I had to be in Seattle for a conference and Sasha's place provided the peacefulness I needed and I was looking for!
The best part is that the place included an ambassador of love and companionship, her name is Zoey, she's a cat!
I really enjoy the place with all the romantic accents and the details of furniture, ambiance, and way of living.  I slept like a baby and woke up every morning to make me a cup of coffee and then seat in the porch while reading the New York Times...like home!
I didn't had the pleasure to meet anyone in the premises but Sasha's attention to detail and well written instructions and suggestions made everything really simple and easy. 
Lastly, every-time I communicated with Sasha, her response would come back within minutes and it felt very good to know she prioritized details of my stay.  Thank you!
"
3926008,46046733,2015-09-07,30463974,Dima,"Everything was good, Thank you!"
3926008,57819658,2015-12-29,1457778,Kathryn,"This is a great place! Sasha's home was very clean (esp kitchen and bathroom), all instructions were clear, and we had absolute solitude. the bed is very comfy, and we really appreciated the record player. Bedroom and bathroom are in a large separate suite area that can be closed and locked from the rest of the house (since apparently sometimes the downstairs resident uses the kitchen) if that's a concern; we never saw him or anyone else in the house, and felt completely at home. Oh, nice bath products too! Walkable to everything on 15th/Capitol Hill, and Uncle Ike's if that's relevant to you."
2484067,12314274,2014-04-28,14501511,Sarah,"Christina's private entrance, room was perfect for my stay in Seattle. I did not need a large place, just a home base. 
I love the neighborhood. The area is full of beautiful homes,has parks nearby and is only a short 10 minute drive to downtown.
Christina was a great host. She checked in on occasion but gave me the privacy I was looking for. She is also very thoughtful, leaving a plate of sandwiches for me in the fridge.
I would definitely  stay at Christina's again. "
2484067,13141785,2014-05-20,4717551,Kayla,"We had a great time at Christina's. Although she was out of town for most of our stay she was in constant contact and made sure we had everything we needed and were comfortable in the apartment. It was just down the street from fantastic restaurants and a nice walk from the park and lake. The bus line is close to get downtown easily as well. The apartment had everything we needed - comfy beds, fridge, shower, and our dog was welcomed as well! Would stay again."
2484067,13722469,2014-06-02,13006346,Meghan,"Great for a quick trip to Seattle! It was perfect for two close friends - as there were 2 twin beds. The neighbourhood was great because it was smack dab in the middle of two fun neighbourhoods- Madison and Medrona. We didn't spend much time there, but we chatted with the hostess and she was very nice (so was her kitty). "
2484067,14417955,2014-06-18,13681361,Kim,"Christina and her place were great! Even though it is a private room, she gave us complete privacy and was really nice and accommodating. 

The neighborhood is really gorgeous and a delight to walk around in (aside from the hills but we got used to them after a while). It's a short walk to Safeway and really nice restaurants in Madrona. Capitol Hill is about a mile away - a 20 minute walk. "
2484067,14640839,2014-06-23,15220210,怡文,"The room Christina provided for us is very comfortable, with privacy, and very clean. Though it was not a quiet big room, Christina provided us laundry, dryer, and refrige and a well--cleaned bathroom. Besides, she was so considerate for providing us the phone number of the hospital, fire department ...etc, the location of the suggested bar and restaurants around the neighborhood.BTW, She had a very cute and lovely cat called Cocoa that often accompanied with us!"
2484067,18615604,2014-08-29,14046506,Alyssa,"Christina and her home was above and beyond what I could have hoped for. I stayed there for around 3 months and was able to take advantage of the fantastic location, great neighborhood, and comfortable home. I could walk to local restaurants, the lake, and parks within minutes. Downtown and Capitol Hill are within minutes as well. Christina was a wonderful host who made me feel welcome from the start and introduced me to great activities throughout Seattle. I would highly recommend staying here for any length of time.   "
2484067,18697235,2014-08-30,13874664,Heather,"Our stay at Christina's was great. Room was comfortable and clean. Christina was a welcoming host, we would gladly stay there again in the future. "
2484067,19158832,2014-09-07,7513685,Ada,"Christina (and her adorable cat Cocao) was very welcoming; she checked up with me prior to my arrival, made sure I had no issues getting into the place, and checked in with me on occasion to make sure we were having a good time on our trip and to see if we needed anything. Her place is absolutely adorable and in a prime location, just a couple of miles from downtown. We also enjoyed just taking walks around the neighborhood during our down time in between our packed itinerary. Hopefully we return to Seattle soon, and I'd love to stay here again!"
2484067,19571689,2014-09-14,12816690,Andrew,"This is a must stay location. Super private and really quiet neighborhood, I was concerned it was a ways out of where we would be spending most of our day time, but the location is ideal for getting anywhere in the city. 

The room was really clean and neat, no problems at all. To be honest we didn't see Christina, but did communicate via text and call, we were super late to check in but there was a lock box so that was really freaking nice. We had no issues and will be looking to stay again next time we are up. 

Highly recommend this location."
2484067,24070863,2014-12-19,10674079,Melanie,"I stayed with Christina for 3 months after I moved to Seattle from the east coast.  
The residence was exactly as described, clean and tidy.
Christina was very welcoming, accommodating and was well aware of things to do in her community. 
Highly recommended! "
2484067,25246856,2015-01-10,24381083,Erica,"Christina was a wonderful host! Her home is located in a beautiful, safe neighborhood. The room was very nice and clean, and there were maps and tour books available. I would definitely stay again!"
2484067,28112841,2015-03-17,10831663,Stan,"Christina's place was perfect for my girlfriend and I to stay while we searched for apartments in Seattle. It has its own private entrance, bathroom, kitchenette, and access to her W/D. Christina was a gracious host who gave us good advice about living in Seattle. Her place was also a close walk to tons of good stuff in the city. I would recommend it to anyone staying in Seattle."
2484067,28419873,2015-03-23,16197649,Mengyun,"Christina is a really nice host！She offers us extra sheets and an air bed, since we have four people stay at her house.  We appreciated for that and have a nice stay in Seattle! 
"
2484067,28741953,2015-03-29,5256312,Julian,"Christina is a wonderful host with a great space. The location in the Madrona is just gorgeous and offers a nice, quiet environment that lets you enjoy the pace of life in Seattle to the fullest. She is so welcoming and knowledgeable about the area and was super accommodating of three of us staying in the space. I couldn't recommend this place enough. It's nice to have a private entrance and space, but still have a chance to meet Christina and feel the connection to the neighborhood--the best of both worlds."
2484067,30729162,2015-04-26,28101635,Kay,"Christina was so pleasant and accommodating. I had everything I needed, and her place was a perfect location for getting around Seattle. It was so nice to be able to do laundry as I stayed several weeks. Thanks again Christina!"
2484067,33588150,2015-05-30,31369191,Rai,"I stayed with Christina for a month when I first moved to Seattle while looking for an apartment, and I don't know that I could have done it without her. She was absolutely wonderful--so welcoming and friendly. My first day there, when I was feeling homesick, she invited me on a bike ride around the neighborhood which cheered me up so much. The location was perfect, too. Very close to everything, but in a beautiful, safe, residential neighborhood. Now that I'm a local I'll definitely recommend Christina to friends and family when they come to visit."
2484067,33731930,2015-05-31,6642738,Rebekah,"Christina and Cocoa (her kitty) were lovely hosts. From the private entry to a private bath to access to a private fridge and Wifi, I felt right at home. She also has a full length mirror in the bedroom with plenty of electrical outlets. Her day bed was comfortable as well. The memory foam pillow was an added bonus. There is plenty of parking on the street, but she offered to let me share her driveway. I will recommend Christine to my friends and I would stay with her again. Thank you Christine for sharing your comfortable, clean home with me for one evening!"
2484067,43747347,2015-08-22,19523730,Kelsey,"I stayed in Christina's home for nearly 3 months over the summer, and she was an incredible host. The space was very clean and super comfortable. Christina went above and beyond to provide me a wonderful home for the summer, and her cat, Cocoa, is the sweetest cat you'll ever meet. "
2484067,44335512,2015-08-25,17430987,Fern,Christina's accommodations were comfortable and quiet.  Loved her cat!  
2484067,44647909,2015-08-28,11268045,Kp,"My three companions and I stayed at Christina's home for two nights on a pit stop before camping at Olympic national park. Her space was small but contained all the amenities we could need. She was also very communicative and flexible, really a perfect host. Her place is a little far from the tourist attractions, but it doesn't matter thanks to uber. "
2484067,44790829,2015-08-29,34223513,Mike,"Exactly as advertised... quiet, private, and prime location close to everything. Christina was very friendly and great with (email hidden)e helped to get us settled in very quickly. Awesome stay, highly recommended!"
2484067,44963684,2015-08-30,40155309,Nicholas,"Christina was welcoming and helpful from the moment we stepped out of our cab. She was very understanding of our unfortunate delayed check-in. Her communication was great and really quick!
The room was comfy and the kitchen stocked with plenty of gear for anyone who might be staying longer than our one night :)
We would definitely come back to stay! Hopefully we'll have more time on the next trip. Say hit to Coco for us!  Thanks again :D"
2484067,45671391,2015-09-05,12429415,Ian,Christina was a war and gracious host. We came with our two small dogs and had a great experience. She helped us get situated and to learn about the neighborhood.
2484067,46311778,2015-09-09,3890200,Anton,"Thank you Christina for hosting our first Seattle adventure! Our plan was to arrive without much agenda other than walking and biking between Madrona and Downtown Seattle. 

Christina is an awesome host! She was communicative from the very first exchange, identified a long list of nearby sights and destinations, was courteous and available while also giving us a great deal of privacy. The private entrance, room, kitchenette, laundry, and bathroom made it feel as if we had a small, private cottage at our disposal.

The location was perfect, situated within 15 minutes of several different neighborhoods with a variety of excellent food and beverage options. Our daily walk up a trio of steep hills took us into Capitol Hill, then finally into Downtown Seattle. Our calves are barking but we loved every minute! (There are many bus routes very close that lead to Downtown, but we were feeling adventurous.)

I would certainly consider staying here for my next visit to Seattle, and would recommend Christina (and Cocoa) without hesitation. Thanks again!"
2484067,51531197,2015-10-21,18936258,Lisa Helmi,"I had a wonderful stay with Christina in Madrona!  I was there for a longer-term stay (a month and a half) and it was nice to have such a caring host who consistently checked in to make sure that things were going well and that I had everything I needed!  I felt a little guilty at first saying that I wasn't comfortable in the bed, for instance, but she was so happy to make things more comfortable and had a whole memory foam mattress pad at the ready that made all the difference.  Christina is an all around really solid, awesome, smart person who I would say is everything you'd want in a host! :)

I do have to admit that the space was a little bit smaller than I expected from the pictures initially and I also didn't realize how connected to the rest of the house it was going to be.  I was a little bit taken aback at first as I thought that it was going to be completely separate from the rest of the house but thankfully Christina is great so I never felt awkward or uncomfortable.  But just to say so to avoid anyone else being surprised! :)  The neighborhood is really lovely and if you are able to get around easily (whether it be walking, biking, busing, or driving) there's so much great stuff close by!  I commuted into downtown via bike and bus and loved it (although beware the hills!).  My stay in Madrona was so nice and I'm grateful to have had a clean, cozy place to call home. :)

"
2484067,52006176,2015-10-25,40863042,Lucas,"We had a great staying! Christina is a really nice person and made sure we had our privacy and comfort. The place is very nice, it has everything as it was listed and the neighborhood is peaceful and beautiful. I would definitely try to stay there again!"
2484067,53096264,2015-11-04,33745274,Dalmar,"Our stay in Seattle was great and his had a lot to do with Christina. Not only was she welcoming and informative about what sites to check out while we were here, but the comfort of her accommodations, and great location of her home,  meant that we could come and go with ease, cook at home, and sleep a deep and comfortable sleep before hitting the town the next day to soak in more of what Seattle has to offer. I couldn't recommend her more."
2484067,54494708,2015-11-20,48877339,Brandy,Had a wonderful stay! Checked in at a late hour at last minute & was welcomed right in. There was travel books which were perfect for visiting guests looking for something to do. Would stay again & would recommend this stay!
2484067,55235471,2015-11-29,19360083,Eric,My family stayed with Christina during their most recent visit to Seattle and could not have been happier with their room. Christina was a fantastic host and the location of her home is perfect to use as a home base for exploring  everything Seattle has to offer. I would highly recommend staying with her. 
945833,5316822,2013-06-24,6416437,Jay,The location is amazing if you plan on exploring Seattle. Nathan is a great host. The townhouse is well maintained and the amenities are top notch. The neighborhood has a smorgasbord of shops and great restaurants. 
945833,7004723,2013-09-03,5341815,Paul,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Hoover's place. The house was very clean and very comfortable. We felt right at home. The location is great. You are only 2 to 4 blocks away from several restaurants. There is a grocery store only 4 blocks away. It is an easy walk to the Seattle Center and the monorail that takes you downtown.  
Nathan was a great host and made sure that everything was ready for us when we got there. He even messaged me during our stay to make sure that all was going well. Hopefully, we will have the chance to stay at his home again. "
945833,44017302,2015-08-23,40721653,Joyia,"We loved every minute of spending time in Nathan's family home. First and foremost the townhome is literally within walking distance to the Space Needed, EMP Museum, Children's Museum, Chichuly Glass Museum and Duck Tours. The townhome is located in lower Queen Anne which is a great neighborhood so it is close to amenities as well like Trader's Joes, Safeway, coffee shops, boutique stores and other amenities you might want and need. Nathan's place was very spacious so it was perfect for us, our toddler and my sister. It comes with a one space garage so great for parking."

Her artistic style matches the neighborhood perfectly. Fremont is a really cool, beautiful area of Seattle and the apartment's location is perfect for walking to many restaurants, shops, parks, cafes, and in the spring/summer months, festivals and outdoor markets. It's also only a short bus ride to downtown, including the famous Pikes Place Market. Mackenzie was a fantastic, welcoming host, and offered great suggestions. I stayed for two weeks, but could have happily stayed longer!"
6107901,33729362,2015-05-31,28309422,Eric,Mackenzie's is a fabulous host. She thoughtfully left recommendations for her neighborhood and was readily available if I had any questions. The place is quite spacious with a charming decor inside and out. Ultimately the location of her place made the trip perfect being a short walk to a multitude of places that make Fremont the Center of the Universe. Hope to stay here again on my next visit up.
6107901,34354283,2015-06-07,34347634,Patricia,"MacKenzie made it very easy to work with her.  Her place is great, comfortable, roomy & clean.  There is street noise, but it does calm down after 10:00pm.  Would definitely stay there again."
6107901,36184101,2015-06-26,2055889,Sarah,"Mackenzie was an excellent host! She was friendly, easy to contact, and very responsive during the entire duration of my stay, even checking in on me at just the right times.

Her studio is a fantastic space with great energy, lots of light, and super high ceilings. Her descriptions are on point! She also left it feeling cozy & homey and provided plenty of clean towels, hangers and rods, and great snacks and drinks. I especially enjoyed her VitaMix and AllClad ware for whole juicing and cooking. Laundry was easy and a great option!

The experience, from host to space, was exactly how I liked it and couldn't have been better for the two long weeks I stayed there. Such a great Airbnb!"
6107901,39280037,2015-07-22,33360407,Aja,"Great apartment, totally matched the description! Mackenzie was incredibly welcoming. Her place had all of comforts of a home, without feeling overwhelmed with personal objects. Perfect location, too, very accessible to Fremont and quick access to other neighborhoods. "
6107901,41881692,2015-08-09,4946475,Mahela,"Mackenzie's studio is a great place to stay. Located walking-distance from Fremont's bars, cafes, and restaurants, and close to Hwy 99/Aurora, it's easy to get just about anywhere in Seattle quickly. 

The apartment was clean, well-appointed with towels, fresh sheets, filtered water, a fan to keep air circulating, and a welcome bottle of bubbly. We really enjoyed the coffee table art books (especially Stephen Shore). The private patio was great for letting in some fresh air. Overall, great place to call home for a couple nights.

Although it's located on the corner of a busy intersection, we did not find it to be unusually loud, and we did not use the earplugs left for us at night.

As for our host, Mackenzie was 100% attentive and responsive. Clear directions, kindly checking in to ensure we arrived and had what we needed, available if anything came up, and flexible on check in/out times. Awesome host!!

I would recommend and would stay here again."
6107901,42536374,2015-08-14,2730547,Chelsea,"Good location, charming flat and overall pleasant experience. Welcoming, delicious beverages in the fridge upon arrival!"
6107901,43242351,2015-08-18,8779573,Drew,"Mackenzie and her studio apartment in Fremont are great. She was very helpful, stocked the place with needed essentials, and was always available if we needed her. Thanks to Mackenzie for the opportunity to stay with her, and we would definitely stay there again. Highly recommend!"
6107901,43931729,2015-08-23,4436403,Katherine,"Mackenzie was an excellent host.  She was in close contact with us in the days leading up to our trip and provided us with a welcoming environment when we arrived, including snacks and a bottle of champagne!  The apartment was exactly as billed.  Fremont is a quaint, scenic part of Seattle with many nice restaurants and shops just a block or two away.  The apartment itself had a unique feel since it was an old coffee roaster shop, and it was beautifully and tastefully decorated.  Would definitely recommend others to stay here.  "
6107901,44909121,2015-08-30,2602137,Sara,"Mackenzie's place is absolutely wonderful! It was spacious, beautiful, and the perfect place to spend a weekend away. Additionally, it is only a few minutes walk to Fremont, which includes amazing restaurants, bars, cafes, and ample walking routes around the river and lake. "
6107901,45949208,2015-09-07,37430288,Erin,"We stayed here for a long weekend and enjoyed ourselves. We were out and about all day, and the studio provided a comfortable, unique space to come back to in the evenings. Clean, spacious, and well laid out. Comfy bed, kitchen stocked with what we needed, reliable wi-fi, and off-street parking. There are lots of cute places within walking distance (including a fantastic gluten-free and vegan bakery!), and we found it very easy to get around with Fremont as home base.

We never actually got to meet Mackenzie (who was out of town), but she was a wonderful host and made the accommodations part of our visit effortless. She was incredibly responsive both before and during our stay, and she was able to provide some great recommendations for restaurants that could accommodate my wheat and dairy sensitivities. She also made sure there were a few allergy-friendly snacks in the apartment when we arrived, which -- especially with our late-night arrival time -- was super helpful.

As the listing mentions, there's street noise at night as the studio sits on the ground floor right by an intersection. After the first night, we used the earplugs Mackenzie provided and had no trouble sleeping. Hard to know whether it was actually the noise or just the unfamiliar environment that had us up a bit the first night."
6107901,46420902,2015-09-10,20488949,Michael,"I stayed at Mckenzie's studio during a trip to Seattle this week. Mackenzie was an awesome host. Super responsive and available anytime that I needed to message her. Her studio is in a fantastic location, walkable to anywhere in Fremont, and a short Uber ride from anything that you could want to do in the city. The property itself is clean and well decorated. My only regret is that I wasn't in town longer. I'll definitely be staying here on any return trips to the city."
6107901,46703654,2015-09-13,35143194,David,"A wonderful host, great apartment and an excellent first time experience with airbnb. Mackenzie went above and beyond her duties offering constant communication, helpful information, surprise amenities and a willingness to accommodate; whatever it took (and then some!) to ensure that I had the best trip possible. I felt lucky and spoiled by this first rental and am certain that every future airbnb rental will be compared to this one! Highly recommend and thank you Mackenzie!  "
6107901,47257308,2015-09-17,8169925,Laura,"We had the best time in Seattle, Mackenzie's studio is SO cute, it's cozy, clean & in a great location!  My daughter & I came up to Seattle for a little getaway, & we had the best time:)
Mackenzies place is just a 3-5 minute stroll away from the center of Fremont, it's such a fun little downtown, w/cute bakery's, coffee/tea houses & darling little shops, & a great grocery store. 
Getting around pretty much all over Seattle was super easy, we used the bus, Uber & the rail, there's no need for a car @ all, her studio is in an easy location to make it super travel friendly to hit all the major & hidden places in Seattle.
I've read a couple reviews commenting on the ""noise"" but honestly wasn't bad @ all!  You're in a city, & occasionally you can hear people walking & talking & every now & then a loud car driving down the street, but nothing bad @ all, we loved it actually:)

Mackenzie is awesome @ communicating, from the beginning she always got right back to me, which is huge.  She is super nice, & gave us so many great recommendations & tips:)  I just can't say enough good things about her:)

If we head back to Seattle I will for sure be coming back here:)!

laura:)"
6107901,47645183,2015-09-21,36830528,Kristi,"Awesome stay at Mackenzie's studio! Great location..everything was in walking distance. Clean, very cute, had all that we wanted & needed for the stay, plus! Wonderful hospitality & she was available at all times for any questions we had. Street noise wasn't a problem at all, although we did use the earplugs. Would definitely stay again!"
6107901,48105492,2015-09-23,5122085,Matthew,"Mackenzie was an excellent host. She reached out to me immediately during the booking process and made sure that everything went smoothly. The studio was as described, clean, comfortable, and accessible. I would absolutely stay there again and would recommend it as a great place to begin exploring Seattle. The neighborhood was safe, parking was relatively easy, the bus stop is very close, and there were plenty of food options within walking distance. Mackenzie contacted me a few times to make sure things were going well and we had no needs whatsoever. Overall couldn't have been happier!"
6107901,48875691,2015-09-29,24160718,Daniel,Mackenzie was the perfect host! Everything was perfect when my wife and I arrived Mackenzie was there to greet us give us a few pointers and let us be. We really appreciated the bottle of wine that was waiting upon arrival. I would Highly recommend staying here anytime your travels take you to the Seattle/Fremont area the location is perfect. 
6107901,49769732,2015-10-06,9909547,Karie,"Our stay in Seattle at this studio was just wonderful! The place was just like the pictures and description. Absolutely great location and wonderful amenities. Mackenzie was so easy to communicate with and had great suggestions on things to do and places to eat. Fremont was a great place to stay - cute ""small town"" feel but right by the bus line. Great ice cream, restaurants and stores close by. Easy to get downtown or anywhere by bus. Would definitely recommend staying here to any of my family and friends! Thank you for everything!"
6107901,49984928,2015-10-08,27713541,Michelle,"We had a wonderful experience in Mackenzie's studio. The easy check in,  handwritten note, wine, and snacks made us feel welcome immediately. The apartment was spacious and well-appointed - I loved her style! The apartment is located close to bars and restaurants in Freemont - definitely walkable. I know some of then reviews said that the apartment is noisy with street traffic, but we didn't find it to be a bother at all. We found it quieter at night than the day. All in all, we had a great stay thanks to Mackenzie!"
6107901,50275933,2015-10-11,35814632,Matthew,"Mackenzie was so nice and incredibly easy to deal with from start to finish. She even offered to pick us up at the dock where our ferry was arriving, which was so generous since the apartment is a little far from the docks. There was a bottle of champagne waiting on ice when we got to apartment, which was also unbelievably nice. The apartment was in a very good location compared to the popular places to stop in Fremont, right in the middle so you can go up the hill or down the hill to find something to do. "
6107901,50637893,2015-10-13,4085538,Nathalie,"Mackenzie's studio was beautifully decorated and a very cozy spot to spend a couple nights in Fremont. The studio is walking distance to some great restaurants and shops. We really like 9 Million Unmarked Bills for cocktails and Tzar for pelmini (Russian dumplings). The bed is super comfortable and she left earplugs for the street noise, which I didn't find to be that bad at all. She was very considerate and left some nice snacks on the counter and in the fridge for us, including cheese and crackers, my fave! The wifi was fast and allowed us to work a bit each morning before going sightseeing. We would definitely return!"
6107901,50874005,2015-10-15,7682650,Stephen,"Lovely place, great location, fabulous host. Great touch leaving some items to snack on in the space. Highly recommended, and great style place. "
6107901,51285056,2015-10-19,16090532,Patrick,Great studio right in the middle of upper and lower Fremont! Walking distance to both. Superior hospitality from Mackenzie to top it off. Would highly recommend it.
6107901,51615549,2015-10-22,2762776,Jessica,"Mackenzie's apartment was lovely! The apartment had everything I could want for a short stay and Mackenzie was easy to communicate with.  The apartment is very centrally located in Fremont - close to both of the major strips. The street noise is present, as described, but did not bother me as it died down by about 9:30pm or so. A great stay!"
6107901,51905094,2015-10-25,26702627,Brie,"Mackenzie was an absolute delight. Extremely helpful, friendly, and accommodating. My son and I had a wonderful time. Her home was beautiful and in a fantastic location. We were able to find a park, walk to the Zoo and explore Fremont. Mackenzie had some great suggestions as far as places to eat and things to do. She also went out of her way to make sure we had everything we needed. We truly had an amazing time and I can't say enough great things. We will definitely be booking with Mackenzie again!"
6107901,52329103,2015-10-28,12604867,Stephanie,"Mackenzie's place was exactly how described and a great stay. It was easy to find and was close to great shops & restaurants. Mackenzie was an amazing host; checked in to ensure we had everything we needed, left a beautiful bouquet of flowers and wine. What a great welcome! As she notes, the place can be a bit loud, but if you are used to city living you will be fine. We would recommend this place to anyone. "
6107901,52570669,2015-10-31,20022412,Dana,"I loved staying in such a beautiful and unique place! Everything was exactly as described if not better! It felt very welcoming to have flowers, wine, and snacks there when we arrived! That was really above and beyond my expectations. I found the bed to be very comfortable and the outside noise didn't bother me (though I am a heavy sleeper.) 

Mackenzie was so nice to coordinate with! We mentioned that we were on a road trip and were coming from our latest stop in Vancouver and she even recommended a lunch place for us to check out. It was very easy to get into the studio and Mackenzie was available for any questions that I had. 

I would highly recommend staying in Mackenzie's place if you like a unique venue with many stylish touches! "
6107901,53108828,2015-11-05,12334862,Justin,"Mackenzie made the entire experience awesome! I have been thinking about writing this review since probably a day or two before we checked in just because of how great the experience was from the reservation confirmation. She answers messages and texts super fast. She is constantly going out of her way or going the extra mile to make sure your stay is comfortable and perfect. She left us some gorgeous flowers and a nice bottle of wine along with some neat snacks and other items to cook/eat. The studio is somewhat hidden but it is right on the street at a crazy intersection I still haven't figure out (LOL). There is a lot of noise from the street but she provided ear plugs. We actually turned on the fan for some white noise to drown out the street noise and that helped a lot. It's really not that bad. The studio is located in a great area. We walked to some fun places like Brouwer's Cafe, Backdoor at Roxy's and others. I really enjoyed that there was no television in the apartment. That is a hard thing for me to say! It was nice being on vacation and not being sucked into the boob tube. We didn't get to meet Mackenzie but hey, maybe next time we stay here! I highly highly recommend this space. It helped make for one of the best trips I've ever been on."
6107901,53471395,2015-11-09,12707449,Bruce,"We can't thank Mackenzie enough for making our stay enjoyable. Her kindness, generosity, attention to detail and great communication ensured that we wanted for nothing, not to speak of all the little extras she left for our enjoyment.

Mackenzies apartment is walking distance to lots of great bars and restaurants, and is close to the main arteries heading into the city, which makes it an easy place to get to from 'out-of-towners' like us.

Thanks again Mackenzie, highly recommended!"
6107901,53859240,2015-11-13,29890122,Jeff,"Mackenzie was a great host - responsive and hospitable.  The overall space was clean, the bed was very comfortable, had all that I need for my stay and was as described.  Located near a bunch of great restaurants - all within 5 - 10 mins brisk walk, I was spoilt for choice.  Its only about 3 1/2 miles into downtown and is completely walkable - walked it back and forth."
6107901,54841364,2015-11-25,35133240,Marquise,"Mackenzie's place was amazing. I loved the loft feel of it. She left snacks and a bottle of wine in the fridge. She even hooked me up by bringing over some wash cloths. She was very nice and helpful. I'm in love with the studio. It was nicer than I expected, and I am still fantasizing about it, wishing I still had a few nights there to spend. This experience was an A+ for me. Thanks Mackenzie!"
6107901,55189029,2015-11-29,24739402,Kate,"Mackenzie was very helpful and friendly. The apartment is very nice and exactly as described. The neighborhood is great, very accessible to restaurants, bars, etc. and pedestrian friendly. We had a great stay!"
6107901,55680762,2015-12-04,4153917,Katie,"What a delightful place and generous hostess! Pictures are as advertised. What you don't see is the excellently outfitted kitchen area- small and efficient. Mackenzie welcomed me with flowers wine and some light fare which was excellent since I arrived after long day of travel. 

Excellent neighborhood with fabulous restaurants within walking distance and easy access to public transportation.

Mackenzie was helpful and easily available. I would definitely stay again.
"
6107901,56190917,2015-12-10,28129924,Jeanne,"This place was really a great find. Located in a great neighborhood, Fremont. Close to my son who was our ""driver"" around the city. Mackenzie was very accommodating, allowing us to check-in early (even though we didn't) because we did a puzzle room (Locurio) which was really fun. She also made us feel welcome with a hand-written note assuring us we could call on her for anything and allowing us to help ourselves and make ourselves at home. The bed was very comfortable and the stylish decor was akin to Pier 1/World Market/Pottery Barn designs."
6107901,56499026,2015-12-14,23457292,Tricia,"Perfect location, lots of space for 2 people and a thoughtfully decorated home.  Agree with all the positive comments by others.  One add: While there are tons of great restaurants nearby, if you enjoy cooking you should plan on making at least one meal in the studio's well stocked kitchen: high quality cookware, professionally maintained knives (seemed like it anyway), plenty of pantry staples and cute tableware. 
Mackenzie was a wonderful host! We specially appreciated the hand-written note and welcome bottle of wine and flowers. We really got to know the Fremont neighborhood thanks to Mackenzie opening up her home for a few days."
6107901,56924422,2015-12-20,13310484,Kristin,"Wonderful studio equipped with everything you need and walking distance to restaurants, grocery stores, coffee shops, and more. Mackenzie was extremely responsive, organized, and provided the best tips for where to eat and what to see and do in Seattle. "
6107901,58153014,2016-01-01,17879903,Jessica,"The place is exactly as shown, no surprises. Great space. We had no issues with parking. The wine and snacks were a perfect addition to the stay. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a place to stay in the Fremont area. "
7987836,49170214,2015-10-01,20448298,Jeff,"The place is brand new and as advertised. Bed was very comfortable. Red Cow, Vendimia, and St. Clouds are a few steps away if you like superb places to eat. Also, parking was plentiful. Cool place in a cool location. "
7987836,55092280,2015-11-27,9173783,Ryan,Great location with easy parking. Comfortable spot with everything we needed. Thanks! Roberto was accommodating and willing to help out.

5218550,27977690,2015-03-15,11616918,Erik,"I had to fly to seattle last-minute because my mother was in the hospital. Susan was extremely accommodating and sympathetic, and her room and the entire flat are lovely. Great location, very clean and the bed is extremely comfortable. Thank you for helping me through my difficult time, Susan. I highly recommend you!"
5218550,28395338,2015-03-23,26737950,Ashley,"This trip was our first time using Airbnb, not really knowing what to expect we are so thankful and appreciative of  Susan. She was the best host for us, we are so happy with our decision to stay at her lovely flat for 5 days. Her hospitality is so wonderful and she is very thoughtful and detailed with having tea out and giving us snacks in our room as well as bath and body products for us to use. The bed and pillows are comfortable and the room has great natural light and the street is quiet. We enjoyed it more than a hotel because it was so nice having conversations with Susan during our stay. It made our Seattle experience even better. She was laid back and gave us the flexibility to ""check out"" whenever is best for us. The location is amazing, walking distance to anywhere downtown. We would recommend anyone to come and stay with Susan in the heart of Seattle! "
5218550,28698786,2015-03-29,10101182,Nickolette,"Susan was super accommodating, I ended up coming into town a little late and Susan had it worked out so that I could access the apartment even when she wasn't there. 

The building is a fantastic 110 year old property and is in excellent condition! Some of the floors are a little creaky but that gives it more charm. It's centrally located near several major streets and downtown is just a few blocks away, as is the convention center.

The room is very comfortable and welcoming when you walk in and the bathroom is easily accessible right off the hall. The bench at the foot of the bed is great for storage and putting on your shoes before you leave to go out. 

I would definitely stay with Susan again the next time I'm in Seattle. "
5218550,29133193,2015-04-04,29763634,Cheng,"Susan was extremely hospitable and accommodating. We were Canadian travellers visiting Seattle and Susan made us feel right at home. Her apartment is very well kept and located in a quaint area of Seattle. The apartment itself is a Victorian style building with an interesting history of its own. The location is within walking distance to the downtown area and located on some very convenient bus routes. 

She was an excellent hostess and we will most definitely keep her in mind the next time we visit Seattle."
5218550,29467974,2015-04-07,1516153,Jorge,"We had a lovely time at Susan's place. The apartment is gorgeous. Smartly furnished, very clean and orderly, and sun-drenched. Susan was just as lovely! She was smiley and welcoming. We very much enjoyed her conversation, she is very worldly. The room was like a private oasis. The bed was comfy, the chairs next to the wonderfully large windows were so inviting. Susan had little snacks out for us. The bathroom was terrific as well. Susan had a generous spread of toiletries and fresh white towels for us to use. (Obsessed with the sugar scrub and Shea butter lotion!!) Would definitely recommend Susan and her apt! "
5218550,30034202,2015-04-16,9112387,Christina,"Susan is so amazing. Her apartment is very lovely and gorgeous. It is a wonderful experience to stay in her apartment when I was traveling in Seattle. I felt very cozy because Susan prepared everything I need: clean towel, hairdryer, shampoo, electric kettle, heat and warm blanket. I love to talk with her about what I did and where I went every day, and glad to know her daily life too. It made me feel the local style of Seattle, very interesting experience. Susan also gave me many useful advises for exploring Seattle. Thank you so much, Susan. I hope I can be back soon :)"
5218550,30387284,2015-04-21,15489493,Mark,"Susan was such a great host! She is very accommodating and thoughtful. This a quiet retreat from all the noise in downtown, and walking distance to downtown, the convention center and Pike/Pine. There are at least 5 Starbucks within 5 minutes walking, so you'll never be lacking in caffeine. The pictures accurately show the charm of the apartment. I would definitely stay here again. Thank you Susan!"
5218550,30694381,2015-04-26,29877079,Kamen,"Susan was very kind and helped us with everything we asked of her.
Her apartment is in a charming 100 years old building. 
The location is very nice - 5 minutes walk to Pike and Pine streets, near their intersection with Broadway street - lots of restaurants and night clubs in that area. In the same time the apartment itself is on a quiet side street. And it's not far from the city center - 10 minutes of walking downhill and maybe 20 minutes walking back uphill, if you don't take the bus."
5218550,30936337,2015-04-29,15273293,Cristina,Susan was awesome and her apartment was lovely and I'm a great location :) we loved it!! We will absolutely come back :)
5218550,31427483,2015-05-05,26817315,Jennette,Susan was wonderful! Very sweet lady. The room is a good size which we had 3 luggages. The home is old but it is charming. The are a few steps to get to the door but totally manageable. Susan was never in our way &  sharing a bathroom was not an issue. I highly recommend this space because of its location. It's literally walking distance to everything.
5218550,31593957,2015-05-07,4317410,Anuja,Susan has a lovely home and was welcoming and helpful. Her apartment was a perfect location to explore downtown Seattle. We really enjoyed staying with her and would certainly stay there again off available if in Seattle again.

5218550,32095866,2015-05-13,30459760,John,A beautiful home in a wonderful part of the city and an owner with a wonderful heart too !

We even went to a fantastic exhibition together just outside of Seattle.  First Hill is a great neighbourhood too.  I would highly recommend staying here.  "
5218550,32517035,2015-05-19,30437588,Jennifer,"Susan was a great host.  She was helpful and knowledgable as well as very patient with questions and directions.  The area is beautiful and the building is old but full of all the charm that brings.  Bring ear plugs though as there is a bit of road noise and floors and be creaky.   The room and bathroom were very clean and exactly as shown in the pictures.   All in all, Susan's place was great for us and we would stay there again!"
5218550,32838475,2015-05-22,12554468,Eric,Our host was incredibly sweet and hospitable.  The place was clean and comfortable. 5 stars all around!!
5218550,33070431,2015-05-25,14949012,Tiana,"Susan was very welcoming and generous. She worked to coordinate with us on getting into the building and offered to help carry luggage. My boyfriend and I were so busy on our trip that we didn't get to socialize with Susan much, but she was very accommodating and a very open, great person, especially considering she just moved into this particular apartment. The room was quiet and peaceful and the location was perfect. Susan had towels ready for us, bathroom amenities to use, and a nice bed made!"
5218550,33611647,2015-05-30,7684140,Edward,"Susan is an amazing hostess in Seattle, just like the city, sophisticated, warming, friendly and neat. The house is in a great location in downtown Seattle and is a piece of art itself."

The location of her apartment couldn't be more ideal...easy walking to both the Capitol Hill neighborhood and downtown Seattle. The guestroom overlooks the street so bring earplugs if you are a light sleeper. The room is spacious and well appointed as is the rest of the apartment. I would not hesitate to stay here on my next trip to Seattle!
5218550,35773945,2015-06-22,26651005,Hsin I,"Absolutely highly recommend! 
Susan was a fabulous host-- so friendly, thoughtful, and welcoming. We arrived late and found everything prepared for us in such a lovely and cozy apartment: towels, shower essentials, and even snacks and lots of travel information (although we had our plan and didn't use it)!
The bed was very comfortable. Her kitchen was also very well equipped, which benefitted us a lot during our stay. The apartment is located in a lovely and quiet community, where you can easily walk to downtown or bus stops. We really appreciated that there was such a nice ""home"" to return to after a very tiring sightseeing day. :)"
5218550,36720099,2015-06-30,35926375,Miranda,Wonderful home conveniently placed in a lovely area! Easy to get from downtown by foot and fun to explore the neighborhood. Would definitely stay with Susan again!

Susan has a beautiful and tastefully appointed apartment in the heart of the city, well within walking distance of many of the popular attractions. Susan was our first AirBnB experience and she turned out a terrific Ambassador for the concept. Susan was generous with her hospitality and willingness to share her home. She was genuine in her interest to chat about so many topics, ready to give advice and answer our numerous questions. We found this invaluable, far better than staying in an impersonal  hotel where the staff know little of the locality. We would thoroughly recommend a stay with Susan."
5218550,45056718,2015-08-31,29008796,Kim,"Susan was great! The room was just the perfect place to come back after a long day spent at the convention center! She was super helpful in describing the best route back and fourth and giving us food ideas. The room was simple and comfortable and in a great location for our needs. Park in the area is a little tough, but Susan provided a pass for our stay that was not expected! Made our stay even better! Thanks again for a wonderful trip and first Airbnb experience!"

5218550,49971073,2015-10-08,34501512,Donna,"Susan was very friendly and welcoming when we arrived and accommodating our request to drop off our suitcases earlier than check in time.  She was helpful in providing us with information about Seattle and eating options.

Her apartment was within walking distance from downtown Seattle and close to public transport ie bus line.  It was in a leafy area known as First Hill.  Area felt safe and secure.

Susan made us feel at home and allowed us to use her laundry and kitchen facilities."
5218550,50154820,2015-10-09,6697053,Alyssa,"Gorgeous home in a great location! My friend and I enjoyed our stay and Susan was really friendly and knowledgeable about her neighborhood.  If you're visiting Seattle for a short period, this home is located in a safe, secure neighborhood and everything is very walkable.  It's only 4 blocks to the Starbucks Roastery, about 1 mile to Pike Place Market and nearby tons of great restaurants and the nightlife area of Capitol Hill.  "

The place itself was cozy and charming, located in a historic apartment building very close to downtow. The views from our room were gorgeous, got to see the fall leaves on the trees, so pretty. Susan is very sweet person, very hospitable and accommodating. We had everything we needed and she was flexible with our check out time which we appreciated. Since her place is blocks from downtown, we were able to walk everywhere or take a short Uber drive. We really enjoyed our stay with Susan, had everything we needed for our weekend in Seattle."
5218550,52823137,2015-11-02,35308470,Miro,"Susan is an excellent host, very welcoming and hospitable. Her place is lovely and met all our expectations and more. The neighbourhood is perfect - walking distance to many of our favourite spots (Terra Plata, Sitka & Spruce and Elliot Bay Books) and direct bus service to more distant destinations like the opera. We had a lovely stay and highly recommend Susan and her charming home.  "
5218550,53187886,2015-11-06,29160334,Vicki,"Susan is very welcoming and well organized. The room was clean and warm. Although the noise on the street was sometimes disturbing, the neighborhood seemed very nice and safe. It was within short distance to many places which was convenient just to walk everywhere. The apartment was beautiful and stylish. I really enjoyed my stay there."
5218550,53322660,2015-11-08,39972718,John,This is a great place to stay and Susan is a most gracious host.  She went out of her way several times in order to take care of us and make us feel welcome.  She even walked a mile to deliver us umbrellas.  Wow!  We really felt special.  She is a wealth of knowledge about Seattle and the surrounding area.  The apartment is beautiful and it is located in a quiet neighborhood just a couple of blocks from everywhere you want to be.  Great experience.
5218550,54045983,2015-11-15,18879426,Elizabeth C,Susan made my sister and brother in law welcometo her place. She was attentec to their needs even though she was no in the area.
5218550,54502711,2015-11-21,42868638,Tiffany,"Our stay here was lovely.  Susan was very welcoming and friendly.  The room was great, her home was clean and well kept.  The location was great: close to downtown, first hill and capitol hill.  We had a wonderful time and a pleasant stay!"
5218550,54873202,2015-11-25,16064524,Amy,"Susan is so lovely, could not ask for a better Airbnb host. Genuinely interested in her guests and so helpful when it comes to exploring Seattle. The room and apartment are clean and comfortable, only a short walk from Pike Place markets and the monorail to the Sky Needle. Susan provided a city map and umbrella for me as it was a rainy few days in the city. Definitely do not hesitate to stay here, you won't regret it :)"
5218550,54984524,2015-11-27,44889624,Han & Camellia,"Everything is great in Susan's place! The house is lovely and bright, and it is close to everywhere in downtown Seattle. Living in the house with a history of 110 years is also very special and intersting. The room enjoys great street view and we have lots of space for our staff. There is a wardrobe in the room and the bed is also very comfortable. Shared bathroom will not be a problem, and we work well with different timetables. I cannot come up with anything I will need in her house. Susan told me about lots of activities happened during homy stay here, and I really had a nice time!"
5218550,55180783,2015-11-29,5887691,Travis,"My husband and I were in Seattle over the Thanksgiving holiday weekend for a wedding at the art museum, and we thought that staying at Suzan's would be just the thing.  As it turns out, Seattle is worth visiting just to meet Suzan!  She is an extraordinary woman...a story for another time.  What you need to know: her home is warm and inviting and imbued with a beautiful sense of taste and style.  The guest room has a soothing and restful atmosphere, and because of our hectic travel schedule, on Saturday before the evening wedding, my husband and I just sat around and relaxed rather than taking in the city.  This quiet respite was just what we needed.  I enjoyed the tea, the art, and the overall hospitality.  Suzan was even kind enough to take some pictures of us in our finery, the only pics of our vacation that were taken.  We couldn't have asked for a better experience.  I hope you enjoy your visit to Suzan's bnb as much as we did. --Wendy"
5218550,55598899,2015-12-02,36440333,Jill,Seattle is a beautiful city.  I grew up here and can't believe the transformation.  I visit regularly as my children live here but they are both in small apartments.  I love spending the day with them but allowing them their own privacy in the evenings.  Susan's place was just what I needed.  Its within walking distance from everything.  She was very welcoming and kind.  I highly recommend this lovely place.
5218550,55796273,2015-12-06,46673735,Savannah,"We had an amazing time! The location was perfect, right next to down town. Susan was a wonderful host and provided everything we could think of. I would recommend her to friends and family!"

5218550,56757793,2015-12-17,50857490,Ke,Susan is very nice. The room is super clean and cosy. Walking distance to everywhere. My first experience in airbnb is wonderful.
5218550,56902925,2015-12-19,19003403,Namratha,"Susan was an amazing host! We booked this reservation the day of arrival, and she still had everything ready for us! The location is just a short walk or ride away from the heart of Capitol Hill as well as Pike Place Market. The room was cozy and beautiful. The apartment itself was very well kept up. I would recommend it to anyone visiting Seattle!"
5218550,57512009,2015-12-27,35184483,Maggie,"Susan was extremely welcoming and accommodating. The room was cozy and the windows were beautiful. The bathroom was clean and Susan supplied bath towels as well as shampoo, conditioner and body wash. The flat was in a great location, only about a 7 minute walk to downtown! Overall, we had a fantastic stay with Susan. "
5218550,58114278,2016-01-01,33039649,Rachel,"Susan is such a pleasant and upbeat host who will gladly welcome you into her inner-city oasis. Her entire apartment is cozy and has nice views of the surrounding neighborhood. Susan wants to ensure you feel at home by giving you full access to her specialty teas and providing spa-like shampoo, conditioner, etc. Also, I had the best sleep of my life on the room's bed - certainly a restful escape from the busy city. She has lots of tourist resources and brochures to help you decide how to spend your time in Seattle. She will gladly give you recommendations on restaurants, activities, etc, or let you be if you wish for peace and quiet. Her place is a convenient 10-15 min walk to pike's market. 

The surrounding neighborhood is relatively safe. Just be aware and smart when walking home at night from the downtown area.

This was a wonderful place to begin using airbnb and I will certainly return the next time I visit Seattle. I highly recommend for anyone - whether you are a tourist seeing Seattle, on a business trip, or just need a relaxing staycation. "
3679617,16748651,2014-08-01,18279958,Ashley,Melissa was fantastic! We booked this last minute and she was very friendly and accommodating. The place is just like described and in a very safe neighborhood. I will definitely be checking this place out again next time I'm in Seattle!
3679617,16948335,2014-08-04,1831659,Jessica,"I stayed at the Center UW, Comfy, Clean & View studio apartment for 3 nights. It was very clean. Check in was a little confusing- I waited out front and a man let me in, pointed me to the apartment door and then Melissa came 5 minutes later. Melissa was very nice. I rented a spot in back and the car turned out to be ok, but I was nervous as the lot was small, smelly and had some interesting folks walking around at all hours. The other cars parked there looked pretty nice, so I decided to go for it. The street was very noisy. I bought a fan to sleep with the windows shut. If you sleep here in the summer, make sure there is a fan before you check in as it was very warm, even with the windows open. All in all a very basic and clean place to lay your head, but I wouldn't stay again because of the street noise.  Also, the wifi was slow on the weekend. If that doesn't bother you and you want a clean, cheap place to stay near a bus line, go for it. "
3679617,17183359,2014-08-08,19046116,Amanda,"Melissa was great host. The apartment was just as advertised. It was very clean in a quiet building. The neighborhood is a lively college area with great restaurants very close. The weather was unseasonably hot and my host brought a new fan by, which was very helpful. Check-in and out we're also very easy. I would return and recommend her accommodations. "
3679617,17540999,2014-08-13,19007801,Marianne,Melisa was a great host and very accommodating. 
3679617,17795407,2014-08-17,6809575,Russell,"Lovely apartment, very well-situated in the U District, with ample amenities for a 3-night stay. "
3679617,18428374,2014-08-26,4454356,Matthew,"Awesome ""Seattle"" apartment in a great location. If I come back I'll try to stay here again!"
3679617,18673583,2014-08-30,9447481,Brandon,Overall I was quite satisfied with Stay. Room was clean and as described.  Great location if visiting uw. 
3679617,18955263,2014-09-03,1137665,Tate,"Good spot in a decent location, about 20 minutes from downtown.  Appropriately priced and good communication from Melissa made the check in and out seamless."
3679617,21263034,2014-10-13,22257856,Vickie,"Melissa was there and ready to let me in the property.  It was exactly the way she described.  The parking pass was very valuable and having it made my stay much more comfortable.  The apartment was furnished adequately and I had everything a person would need for a short term stay.  The apartment was very clean.  The welcome instructions were very clear and it made it easy to function during my stay and I frequently referred to it.  When one WiFi router failed, she gave me another one and it's password.  I would recommend this apartment and landlord for a stay near the campus.  "
3679617,22799954,2014-11-15,6475297,Kim,"Melissa was very accommodating to my schedule and provided excellent service. The room and building were incredibly quiet and spacious for two (although it was just me)! 

The space/building was old and I didn't find the bed very comfortable. And I didn't feel safe at night walking around but used Uber for transportation instead. Melissa was a great host but I will stay somewhere else while in Seattle next time. We've used a few Seattle airbnb and loved them but this one wasn't for me."
3679617,23999038,2014-12-16,23408899,Elise,"The place is nice for a stay in Seattl. Don't expect anything too fancy, but you get everything that you need from kitchen appliances to towels and tv. wifi is working a little slow, but everything can be done."
3679617,37705985,2015-07-09,4454356,Matthew,This was my second time staying here and it was just as pleasant as the first. It was very hot while I was in Seattle (90+) but the apartment was fine with just the windows open.
3679617,37954209,2015-07-12,1495430,Sophia,"Great location and price for the apartment that it is. And, it was surprisingly quiet in the evenings to get a good restful sleep. The kitchen and bathroom were stocked well."
3679617,40100941,2015-07-28,14117400,Laura,"Apartment is in a good location and was pretty much as described.  Kitchen was fully equipped with cooking items and coffee pot and the sheets and towels were clean.  The couch in the photo on Airbnb was not in the apt - in its place was a futon with a thin foam mattress with a sheet on it but the futon mattress kept falling off the futon.  Bed was comfy though and there was good circulation in the apartment even though it was very hot outside.  There was a large fan that helped keep the apartment cool.  We parked our car in the lot and rented the parking permit from Melissa.  Was $10/day as opposed to the advertised $8/day.  Was difficult to connect with Melissa in the 24 hours before checking in as my texts and phone calls were not returned.  But we got in touch with her one hour before we checked in.  It sounds like there are a lot of properties that Melissa is managing in the area as there were a few other tenants she was meeting around the time we were checking in.       

"
3679617,51897429,2015-10-25,39748934,Chris,"The apartment was definitely as advertised, and the perfect distance from my work at UWMC. I never met Melissa in person, but her staff was very helpful and assisted me in anything I needed. I would definitely consider staying there again if travel brings me back to Seattle."
674113,8201295,2013-10-20,1227553,Sarah,The Ethiopian cottage #2 was pleasant and comfortable.  I really enjoyed staying here and would recommend it. It was peaceful and relaxing.  This is a beautiful home to stay the night in.  
674113,8390363,2013-10-28,6134453,Tony,"Beth was very accommodating to me and my friends! Great house in an awesome location.  Beth was friendly, laid-back, and even gave us a great recommendation for breakfast the following day (Geraldine's-yum)! Would definitely stay again-thanks Beth!"
674113,8557244,2013-11-04,1654316,Misako,The Ethiopian cottage was a perfect haven for my travels.  The room was clean and cozy. I felt right at home and welcomed when I arrived. I was lucky enough to show up when a festive family gathering was happening so I was treated to delicious home cooking ethiopian food. Overall it was a great experience. Thanks Beth!
674113,9102669,2013-12-07,9797963,Ling,"It was a great experience staying in this Ethiopian cottage #2. It is a good size for single traveler. Beth is extremely helpful and friendly. She is a great host!!! I had to catch a early flight in the morning and she offered me a ride to the light rail station even it is wayyy early in the morning! Location is pretty good, just few blocks away from major grocery store and major bus line #7 in Seattle. 

Price of the room is absolutely reasonable, in fact, It is best value and I had a wonderful time spending in this Ethiopian environment ( I even got a chance to have some authentic Ethiopian food! :)

I will definitely recommend to friends and return to the same time if I visit Seattle in the future.

I did not spend much time in my room as I was away most of the time. But I really enjoyed staying there and whenever I will need a place in Seattle, I will definitely stay there again if I get the chance to.

674113,9723464,2014-01-06,10645582,Edison,Beth is so nice a person!
674113,9792652,2014-01-10,2205509,Grace & Jared,"Bethy was a kind and communicative host. The space is simple, affordable, warm and perfect for a single traveler, with easy access to the bus within a 5-10 minute walk and a grocery store less than a 5 minutes walk away. There were many family gatherings during my stay, and Bethy was wonderful and shared her delicious cooking, travel stories and recommendations with me. "
674113,9824028,2014-01-12,11153557,Kate,"Beth is an amazing hostess!! A stay in her home is akin to ""all things global"".  Because she is an accomplished world-traveler, I asked her of her travels and she graciously offered up enthralling (website hidden) of her visits to Asia, Europe and Ethiopia.  Her experiences instantly invite me to purchase to a ticket to literally anywhere. She introduced me to her Ethiopian family who were equally as charming. I just can't say enough good about my stay with Beth and her family.  "
674113,10049514,2014-01-27,1173923,Jess,"I loved staying with Bethy. I was only there for one night, but she made me feel instantly welcome. The room is cute, bright , and comfortable. Bethy is very flexible and happy to allow guests to use her kitchen and to come and go as needed. I'll definitely be staying here again when I return to Seattle. "
674113,10106058,2014-01-31,11394921,Ted,"Bethy is a sweetheart.  We had some good conversations.  She is a citizen of the world, interested in travel and meeting new people.  A true ambassador!"

I enjoyed watching the Seahawks win with her and her family all the insights into Seattle that she shared.  Thank you for your hospitality!"
674113,10267659,2014-02-10,1715155,Shea,Super friendly home! Loved the space and energy! Highly recommend! Thank you Beth for a cozy stay!

674113,10660395,2014-03-02,11610923,Heather,"Beth was a perfect hostess, I am so glad I decided to stay here. The room is just as it appears on the photos - clean and bright and comfortable. Beth and her family were very friendly and kind, and I even got the chance to eat some delicious Ethiopian food. In the morning, Beth left coffee cups, cream, coffee, and cereal bars out on the counter. I was in Seattle for a conference with some very long exhausting days, and this little touch just really made my day! Also, it was so convenient to get downtown on public transit - Beth's house is just a short walk from the bus line, and the light rail station is very close as well. If I am in Seattle again, I would definitely stay here again."
674113,10797806,2014-03-08,11916968,Justine,"I had a lot of fun staying at Beth's. I think her house is a good place to stay if you want to hang out with her family and/or other travelers. It has a great view and is close to a bus stop (just a happy convenience thing that made my trip easier) and she is really generous! For the price you pay, it's worth it."
674113,10983153,2014-03-16,7707787,Sasha,"Beth was a wonderful, welcoming host and provided me with a pleasant experience in Seattle. She was knowledgeable about the area and gave me some tips to make the most out of my stay. I got to meet some of her lovely family and they were equally kind.

The bedroom and bathroom were both clean and comfortable. Beth even provided tea, bottled water, and fruits for her guests.

The location is great, especially if you plan to use Seattle's convenient public transportation. It's a very short bus ride or walk from the Mount Baker light rail station which takes you directly to SeaTac or downtown for about $2.50. 

I definitely recommend Beth's Ethiopian cottage and I'd be happy to stay with her again the next time I'm in Seattle."
674113,11059476,2014-03-18,12682345,Iva,"Beth is very friendly and a great host. She waited for me when I was late. Her place is clean and comfortable, tea and coffee are provided. It was a nice stay in Seattle. "

The neighbourhood is quiet and the house was clean & tidy. Beth was very friendly and left out some tea/coffee and a granola bar in the morning for breakfast - very thoughtful! It was a pleasant stay. "

Bed was super comfy and I woke up refreshed to an amazing cup of coffee and a breakfast bar, and a hot shower. I highly recommend Beth's place! "
674113,11303504,2014-03-29,3529924,Posin,I stayed here for a week and Beth was an amazing host. She really knew a lot about Seattle and had wise words to offer. The Safeway nearby made it easy to nab food when hungry and the house is a short distance walk away from Lake Washington. It was a simple yet fun stay. 
674113,11427167,2014-04-02,11230060,Aletia,"I spent  in Beth's house 4 days and it was great.  She is very helpful , her house is clean, you fill like home out of home. In general I have a good experience. The locations is convenient you have a bus stop near and it will take you to the downtown.  Highly recommend to stay here if you are going to spent some days in Seattle by your self. "
674113,11480085,2014-04-04,373547,Vinay,"I stayed at Beth's Ethiopian cottage during a quick work trip up to Seattle. The accommodations are great- very comfortable room and bed, clean, and plenty of hot water for the shower. The neighborhood is nice, accessible to transit, close to Lake Washington, and not far from downtown. Finally, Beth is an amazing host- I really enjoyed chatting with her and her aunt who was visiting that evening. It felt more like I was visiting a friend- she is well traveled and takes a genuine interest in her guests. The snacks and hot tea were a nice touch also. I highly recommend staying at the Ethiopian cottage."
674113,11576820,2014-04-07,12338220,Kevin,Beth is a real sweet lady and accommodating in everyway 
674113,11608886,2014-04-08,10094818,Janet,Beth was very accommodating for such short notice.  It was truly appreciated that she allowed me to check in at such a late hour.  She was very nice.  Coffee & treat were waiting for me when I got up in the morning.  Thank you.  I look forward to my next visit to Seattle and would considering staying with her again.  
674113,11863158,2014-04-17,12422414,Acki,It was an amaising time staying at your place. Mostly I enjoyed the coffee in the morning and the nice conversations. I felt home on the other side of the world. Thank you Beth.
674113,11894412,2014-04-18,5554747,Jessika,It was a perfect stay at Beth's.  I was able to take a class that night then got to come back and meet some family members--nephew was very cute!  Very comfortable stay.
674113,12082651,2014-04-22,13676340,Devarajan,"Great experience! Beth is an awesome hostess and her entire family is very friendly and goes that extra mile to make you feel right at home. Very cozy room with everything needed for a short stay. They also make sure everything is in order and the place is clean. I thoroughly enjoyed my stay. Parking is on the street but seems like a very calm and peaceful neighborhood and never had any problems. 

Definitely recommend this place. "
674113,12282404,2014-04-28,12999611,TiLissa,Beth was a wonderful host! Sweet and gracious. Her home is clean and comfortable. She provided towels and coffee and tea in the morning. She even offered to pick me up from the bus stop on my way in! Loved my stay and highly recommend Beth's Ethiopian cottage. 
674113,12414275,2014-05-01,14565737,Rene,"Very good place, not too far from downtown Seattle.

Très belle place, pas trop loin du centre-ville de Seattle."
674113,12517051,2014-05-04,8272547,Philip,"Beth is a wonderful host. She immediately offered me an additional night last moment when another arrangement had let me down.  She has a beautiful house that is minutes away from the No. 7 bus downtown (approximately 20 mins).
Very comfortable and clean, and Beth and her family super friendly and helpful. 
Definitely a great value stay and highly recommended."
674113,12626616,2014-05-06,4133715,Ed,"Really enjoyed my time at Beth's.  Her home is very nice and the neighborhood was nice and comfortable.  Excellent food down the street and a major grocery store just a short walk away.  Was able to catch a bus very close by down to Seward Park on Lake Washington.

The room was clean and I was able to sleep very well."
674113,13648302,2014-06-02,3627569,David,"I have stayed with Beth for 7 days in May 2014.

To start with the formalities: Beth's house lies in Mount Baker. It's a nice neighborhood with nice wooden houses and so is Beth's. I always felt safe. It's close to the train station from where you can ride to town in around 10 minutes and the train is coming every 5 minutes or so. Even closer (3minutes) is a bus stop of line 7 which takes you to the city center in about 15minutes. That's very convenient, especially for coming late at night as the bus is still going quite regularly after midnight. The room looked as portraid on the picture. It's bright, not spacious, but defintely large enough if you don't travel with your own piano. I've stayed in the smaller room. I've seen the larger room, and this one is very spacious with a second room as a wardrobe. Everything (room, kitchen, bathroom) were very clean.

Having recounted these benefits, the biggest plus is Beth's own hospitality. She is obviousely not doing it for the rent, but for an lively exchange with people. We had a number of great conversations and ate together from time to time. (Naturally, she also helped with logistical and touristic information.)

So, if you do not want to stay in a hotel, stay with Beth ;). If I should be lucky enough to make it back to Seattle in the future, I will do.

The room was also clean, homely and quiet, and the neighborhood was near to the town center with lots of shops nearby.

I would 100% recommend staying here, and will do it again if ever I pass through Seattle.   "

674113,14495686,2014-06-20,12357310,Lianne,I stayed at Beth's place for one night during a quick business trip to Seattle. Upon arrival I texted Beth who informed me she was out of town but that her aunt was at her place ready to help. I felt a little nervous but it turned out there was nothing to worry about. Beth was very organized and made sure her guests were well taken care of. I met her lovely aunt DeDe who i would like to say is my aunt too now :). Dede was so helpful and she knows everything about the area. She even drove me around to show me some great things in Seattle. Dede went above and beyond to make my stay wonderful. The location is very convenient. Easy to get to from the airport and a short bus ride to downtown Seattle. Also it was a very quiet place to stay. I thank both Beth and Dede for such a great stay! 
674113,14656063,2014-06-23,16771285,Daniel,"If I had a choice between staying here or the Hilton, then I would definitely stay here.  Nice room and neighbourhood but its the host family who make it so wonderful.  They are beautiful people.  Dede is one of the kindest warm hearted people I have ever met.  Thankyou."

I was treated like family and she made me feel right at home and even provided transportation when I felt unsure about taking the bus. What a wonderful fist experience. THANK YOU."

674113,15170063,2014-07-04,13224555,Chi Hung,I didnt meet Beth. Her aunt Dede was the one who hosted me. She is awesome and helpful more than you can imagine. The house is clean. Transportation is convenient. Not to mention Dede's hospitality. I really miss her now. This house was the first reason I fell in love with Seattle.
674113,15448873,2014-07-09,5245339,Eric,"What can I say?   I wasn't able to meet Beth but her aunt DeDe was there to welcome me.   She was the most pleasant person you'll ever meet! 

The room was super clean with everything you would need:  clean towels, water, snacks, wifi, ect

This is a great place to stay when visiting Seattle.   The number 7 bus takes you straight into the city....from there you can explore what the city has to offer

Thank you Beth and DeDe!   "
674113,15857056,2014-07-17,5454586,Christina,"The location of this place was really convenient!  The Safeway is a 2 minute walk away, and the bus stop is right at the light.  The #7 will take you directly from the neighborhood to Pikes!  The place is right next to lake Washington as well, I was able to do early morning runs during sunrise  to the lake during my stay.  The amenities were great, and I felt at home during my time here.  p.s. comfiest bed ever!!"

674113,16077740,2014-07-22,13934036,Margaret,"I chose this listing for its economical price and its proximity to the airport. It is only about a 15-minute drive between the two. Another plus about the location is that it is only a couple of blocks from a large grocery store and from at least two bus lines. There is also a light rail station within a few blocks. My hostess was Beth's aunt because Beth was away. I was treated royally by Beth's aunt! I was welcomed to use the living room and the kitchen, and my hostess even took me on a brief tour of Volunteer Park and an exclusive neighborhood on the water. She also gave me a ride to Seattle Center downtown. I know she (or Beth) won't always have time to do such things, but I really appreciated her kindness and generosity. The home is situated on a hill, giving a good view of the surroundings. In clear weather, one can see Mt. Rainier from there. It is in a safe residential neighborhood. I had everything I needed in the small bedroom and the bathroom right across the hall. There are two other guest rooms, and I shared the bathroom with one other guest but never even saw her because our schedules were different. I had a lock on my bedroom door so had all the privacy I needed. I enjoyed seeing a touch of Ethiopian decor in the living room. I was fortunate to be there at the height of blackberry season. The hostess left freshly picked, washed berries from the yard in the kitchen for the guests in the morning."

Everything was ok. I had a car and so to reach Seattle has been very simple and quick..
the room was perfect, a really good experience"
674113,16367649,2014-07-26,16656373,Brian,"I felt SO at home at the Ethiopian cottage. It features a perfect balance between family style home (with its comforts and amenities, like fully-stocked kitchen with all the wares) and an upscale youth hostel (where you cross paths with other travelers and get a feel for local life as well). The place is immaculately clean, safe and conveniently located as well. As a first-time visitor to Seattle I felt welcome and comfortable beyond expectations. I'll be back and enthusiastically encourage other travelers to stay with Beth in this lovely home. "
674113,16391248,2014-07-27,12441027,Elizabeth,Staying at Beth's place was convenient to the train line and aunt Dede was very friendly and helpful. I had my first Ethiopian dinner at a nearby resturant and enjoyed it. Happy to recommend Beth's place to fellow travellers safe clean and friendly.

674113,17045394,2014-08-06,3391670,Virginia,The neighborhood is residential and the Ethiopian cottage sits on top of a hill .. a real plus in Seattle in the summer.  There is a SAFEWAY supermarket and various other stores just down the hill.

Je ne pouvais pas trouver mieux pour commencer mon séjour à Seattle. Je vous conseille vivement cet endroit. 
674113,18108962,2014-08-22,14046763,Ivan,"I could not emagine a better place to stay in Seattle. Beth is such a nice and warm person. So helpful and sweet. She drove me when I arrived and when I was leaving without asking her. Her house is very clean and quiet. The neighborhood is nice and safe. There is a bus stop nearby and you can easily catch a bus to downtown Seattle or just for a couple of stops to transfer to the link light rail, which will take you directly to the SeaTac airport for about 30 minutes. If you happen to go to Seattle definitely check if there are free rooms at Beth's house, and do that in advance, because the world spreads and it is not that easy. Dear Beth, thank you so much!"
674113,18242622,2014-08-24,1583084,David,"Beth is absolutely wonderful! The place is as described and even better.

The neighborhood is safe, right next to the place there is a Safeway store, SeaTac is 30mins away and downtown is 20mins away by bus. So that's the perfect place for travellers. Thanks for everything Beth, hope I can come back someday. Márton"

I'm an early riser, but found coffee and tea ready along with a light snack when I got out of the shower.  The home was an easy drive from I-5 and the neighborhood has plenty of restaurants and shops with a short walk.  "

674113,19474389,2014-09-13,11456156,Jessica,"We had a wonderful stay in Seattle. Beth was very kind, welcoming and accommodating. She even let us keep our luggage in a closet after checking out. A great place to stay! "
674113,19583599,2014-09-14,18754717,Rob,"I had an amazing experience. Beth's home is beautiful, clean and welcoming. It's location is exceptional with supermarket and transit into town metres away. I hope I can come stay again in the future and get to know you better! "
674113,19933711,2014-09-21,8794284,Beth Ann,"Beth met me at the door, even though my plane was delayed and I arrived in the middle of the night. My room was clean and well set up. There was even a tray I used as a computer desk. She offered plenty of clean towels, extra blankets, snacks and coffee or tea. As I arrived late she even had me some Lasagna made which was lovely! The neighborhood was safe, blocks from public transport and 10 minutes from downtown if driving. The house was beautiful and clean. I would recommend staying at her place if you’re going to Seattle."
674113,20150436,2014-09-24,20427195,Sunwhi,Beth is a wonderful host. She kindly greeted me as I checked in and the room was very clean and cozy. Free towels and free wifi were available and access to public transportation was easy. Had been a great stay.

674113,20518004,2014-09-30,21024032,Frank,"I had a fantastic experience staying with Beth.  Her house is located in a nice neighborhood on a hill and is very convenient to I-5, I-90, and downtown Seattle.  Great anchor point to explore Seattle and the surrounding area, especially if you have a car because parking is always available.  Even without a car, there is a major bus line close by and the light rail is not too far away.  Bathroom was always clean and the bed was very comfortable (especially the pillow - Beth, you've got to tell me where to buy one for myself!)  House was always very quiet.  No complaints at all - would definitely stay with Beth again.  I doubt there is a better value in the area."
674113,20692963,2014-10-04,18608140,Yumeng,"It is my first airbnb experience. I have to say it's a wonderful experience!!Beth is so nice! I have no sense of direction at all when I arrived in Seattle. She was so patient to tell where should I go in the call. She picked me up in the front door of Safeway. Because of my large luggage, she drove her car to get me at her home. The room is so nice and cozy! I have a good time with Beth. She shared her travel experience with me and I've learn a lot from her. She suggested me to try couch surging and told me how to do it. Because of her suggestion, I made many new friends in Seattle. It is not boring to travel by myself at all! On my last day, I wanted to buy a suitcase. She drove me to the secondhand store. I did a lot of shopping there. By the way, transport ion nearby is so convenient! As Beth said, No.7 bus could take you everywhere. Beth's house is a nice choice if you stay in Seattle!"
674113,21013827,2014-10-09,21987389,Laura,I was looking for somewhere to stay as I looked for a permanent place to live in Seattle. Beth's house is convenient and very friendly. There are often various people visiting and it's a very friendly atmosphere.  The room was small but clean and satisfactory. I fix dinner for myself one night another night someone offered me dinner! I hope you visit Beth if you need an inexpensive and friendly place to stay during  your travels in Seattle.
674113,21049697,2014-10-10,20931989,Laura,"Beth is a wonderful host, with the openness and generosity that shows her own experience as a world traveler. 

The room is perfectly clean and serene, and the mattress is incredibly comfortable. I slept so well!  The three guest rooms of the house are located in a cluster, on one end of the house, with a shared bathroom which is just across the hall from each bedroom.

There are porches to sit out and enjoy the fresh air, and in the morning, though I left before sunrise, the dining table was supplied with pastries and accompaniments for coffee and tea, with a pot of fresh coffee sitting on the counter. Great way to start the morning!

I enjoyed the neighborhood, which is truly interesting and diverse.  You have everything from the Tudor mansions of Mount Baker, to a nearby access point to gorgeous and huge Lake Washington, and the eateries of Rainier Ave. S. with many ethnicities represented.  A truly rich experience. Also, very easy bus access to downtown, UW, etc...-- bus stop is about 1 1/2 blocks away and buses run very frequently, connecting to light rail and transit center hubs to transfer if necessary."
674113,21199533,2014-10-13,10505555,Saskia,"Thank you Beth for the nice and convenient stay :)
A bus stop and a grocery store is in front of the housr and you are in downtown Seattle in not more than 20 minutes. Thea area is beautiful eapecially when you get a chance to see Beth's secret spot ;)
I would stay again! I felt very safe and welcome."

674113,21493046,2014-10-18,16067032,Lindsey,"Beth's home is so cute and comfortable! It is also very conveniently located, with easy access to public transportation (buses and light rail), a Safeway, etc... 

Although I didn't have a chance to interact with Beth very much, I really enjoyed the brief conversation I had with her. She is sweet, interesting, and fun to talk to, especially about traveling. She can also help you figure out how to get around the Seattle area, which I greatly appreciated! 

I highly recommend staying with Beth when you come to Seattle. Thanks for everything, Beth!"
674113,21763311,2014-10-23,22486109,Zenia,Beth was extremely welcoming. I was running late and she took care to ensure there would be someone to receive me. She was responsive to any requests I had. The room is clean and simple with all the amenities that I need as well as voluminous amounts of guidebooks that really came in handy. She's a great host! 
674113,21812873,2014-10-24,1017018,Roger,"Bethy's place was great. Very clean, neat, and close to the Rail System. Bethy was friendly and had breads and bagels waiting for me in the morning."
674113,21920662,2014-10-26,22684841,Teresa,"Beth was so sweet and a very welcoming host. It was reassuring to stay in such a comfortable home. I loved how convenient it was to park in her neighborhood and ride the bus in to downtown. One day, I parked near the bus stop in the shopping parking lot - very convenient. Just a heads up,  as a single lady, I didn't feel very comfortable riding the bus and walking to her home in the dark, so I changed my plans for where to stay that night. Some of the people around the area seemed kinda sketch. In the future, I would definitely stay at her home again, just not be out past dark and have to take the bus... =)"
674113,22054472,2014-10-28,22938169,Tony,Very pleasant and easy experience. Thank you.
674113,22119308,2014-10-30,22651261,Terrence,Beth's directions to the house were easy to understand and saved me money from renting a car for the whole trip or taking cabs. Room was clean and wifi was working so I was very happy. This my first Airbnb experience and she really made me feel comfortable. I'd definitely book here again if ever in Seattle and recommend for everyone else to use if visiting as well. 
674113,22176419,2014-10-31,2079495,Elizabeth,"Very clean and easy to get to. The room was nice and economical, Beth is a great host and very friendly. Recommended."

Everything was very clean and organized, including the bathroom and living spaces. The keypad entry on the front door was very convenient as I was out late both nights I stayed. It's a bit far from downtown, although there is a nearby bus stop. Overall I enjoyed my stay and would definitely recommend Beth to other Seattle travelers. "

674113,23053724,2014-11-21,22285021,Andrew,"Beth is a friendly host and the room is very comfortable. Seattle has been getting pretty cold lately, but Beth provided me with extra blankets and the room's heater keeps everything toasty. The room is extremely clean, as is the bathroom/shower which has excellent water pressure. Beth sets up a breakfast bar every morning, which includes coffee and fruit among other things. The house itself is in a quiet neighborhood with tons of street parking. It's a street over from a Safeway and Rainier Ave. If you're from out of town, this location gives you easy access to main arterial roads and I-5.  I would highly recommend this room to anyone who wants a cheap stay, great host, a truly bnb feel, and exposure to a less touristy part of Seattle. "
674113,23326304,2014-11-29,21857448,Keehyun,"Beth was so kind. The room was amazingly cozy. Thanks to her kindness, our trip to Seattle was a huge fun"

I wanted to visit Pikes Market and the aquarium but found the traffic to be a challenge and the parking expensive.  Beth told me which bus to catch to see the sights without the hassle.   I would recommend a stay with Beth if you are in Seattle.

Beth was incredibly thoughtful to her guests and provided an array of complimentary items, including delicious coffee and teas, and a variety of resources to help explore Seattle and surrounding areas.  The house was also located in a fantastic neighborhood that was perfectly situated for public transit and walking.  I will be recommending this room to anyone visiting Seattle, and would definitely stay there again!"
674113,27083826,2015-02-24,17988453,Inge,The location is sooo good. It takes you 3minutes to get to the supermarket and the bus station to downtown. And Beth is wonderful and kind.

674113,27757554,2015-03-11,21872910,Ariana,Beth and her family were excellent hosts:) was easy to get around seattle because transit ran close to her house. She was warm and welcome and I'd strongly recommend staying with her :)

Reaching the apartment from the airport using public transportation was very easy, the neighborhood is nice and peaceful and very close to the house there's a bus stop for the bus going downtown. The apartment was super clean, so was the room, which also had plenty of space for storage.  In the room you'll find a lot of maps and flyers to visit the city, and Beth will also give you very useful advices. You'll also find clean towels, bottles of water, coffe, tea and fruit for you brakfast. Beth and DD, her aunt, are very nice, they'll make you feel at home!

674113,29327053,2015-04-06,28787897,Tait,"When I first arrived, Beth's aunt, Didi was there to greet me at the door. She made me some tea and we talked for an hour or so with another guest.  It was a very welcoming environment. Beth herself was incredibly accommodating to my needs.  She left me her pass-code and I was able to come and go at a late hour (necessary due to my conference in Seattle).  She left breakfast on the table for me every morning. In terms of connectivity, the house is a 5 minute walk from the #7 bus which gets you anywhere downtown, and 20 minutes from the nearest LINK station - very good! "

674113,34369687,2015-06-07,14634467,Ron,"My stay at Beth's home was excellent. Communication was great (via AirBnb messaging, or calling=). I had to make a small change on my check-in time (my fault, as I kind of lost track of time in meeting up with friends beforehand and having so much fun with their whirlwind plans to see and view Seattle!), but Beth was very accommodating as I quickly called her and made the arrangements. If you like using SoundTransit's LINK light rail and have light luggage, get off at Mt. Baker station and wait at the southbound bus stop just as you walk out of the station (so convenient!) and wait for the number 7 southbound bus (towards rainier beach I believe), and get off at Letitia ave. south. Then, a nice short stroll to the home. Getting here by car is pretty good too. Check-in was very seamless, and the room was just what I wanted - efficient, cozy, lay my head down, have a towel/shower, and wifi. Beth's place met all my expectations. My assigned room (number 2), and the living room, and the deck outside all were very warm and cozy. Neighborhood was nice and quiet. I felt safe at all times. There's also a Safeway you could walk to, and some other walkable places (Ross, RadioShack, Little Caesar's, Taco Bell, Emerald City Fish & Chips, Magic Dragon chinese restaurant). I will definitely book here again in the future, and so should you!"
674113,34556330,2015-06-09,5391752,Luke,"I was in for a one night stay and spent little time actually at the house, but it was comfortable while I was there.  I also was grateful for the coffee Beth made available. The house was a bit hot on the day/evening I stay, but I was able to cool off on the back patio. Beth made it easy for me to stop in early in the day before my stay to drop some things off, which I really appreciated. I would stay again! "
674113,34687338,2015-06-10,34061832,Maarten,"Very convenient location. Beth was very helpfull and everything was done to make the stay as comfortable as possible. Beth knows what guests need. When travelling to Seattle, this is the place to stay!"

674113,35217830,2015-06-16,25565315,Divora,"Beth arranged for the house to be open as I had last minute changes. Her home is clean, quiet and comfortable & she supplies all coffee, fruit and snacks. Excellent hostess, world traveler, wonderful personality, and green recycler, Beth is an exceptional person to meet.  She has a very private and quiet backyard, to meditate in. Her sense of hospitality probably outweighs most others. The neighborhood is a mixed, with some houses a few blocks away, that are dilapidated. However her close in area is very safe, my rental car was brand new needing offgassing, and I had no worries leaving all four windows down an inch. A female, walking at night, alone  on public transportation would be fine, as well as the public transportation options. Due to all her recycling, there were a couple of ants in the clean and comfortable house, no big deal, just life."
674113,35464272,2015-06-19,31096914,Kaoru,"Beth and her aunt DD were wonderful!
The house was beutiful and clean too.  They try to help me as much and I really enjoyed talking with them.  If I decide to revisit Seattle again, I will definitely contact with them!"

674113,37657797,2015-07-09,33297198,Regula,"Beth was a great host, I was sick and she was very helpful and did really take care of me. She even took me for short rides around Seattle. The bed was very comfortable. It took 30 minutes to down town with the bus and 20 minutes by food to lake Washington. I would stay with Beth again – Thank you for everything.

Beth's home was very quiet and inviting, just what I needed to recharge after my flight, drop off my bags and head out to explore Seattle. 

Beth has a wonderfully warm personality and it was nice to chat with her for a bit over coffee she provided in the morning. I chose this home before I met the rest of my party for the weekend since I was I traveling alone the first night. I felt completely safe traveling there and would absolutely stay there again the next time I find myself back in Seattle. "
674113,37969799,2015-07-12,11842806,Norm,DD checked me into the home and gave me the grand tour.  She was very welcoming.  I met Beth later on the 2nd day.  I really enjoyed the home set up.

The house is well located in a safe and peaceful neighborhood. Ms. Beth takes awesome care for a relaxing stay, and I think someone else say that they had the best sleep on that bed :). It's very comfy. 

Thank you Ms. Beth for hosting me! Will surely be back."
674113,40756319,2015-08-02,35712385,Claudia,"I really enjoyed my staying at Ethiopian cottage, the area is beautiful, the room is lovely and clean and the host friendly and sweet.
Thanks a lot Beth for your hospitality"

674113,41207888,2015-08-05,14115664,Josie,"Beth's house was welcoming and relaxed. I felt able to get over my jet lag and prepare for a conference. Comfortable room, with privacy and easy breakfast arrangements. I would recommend Beth to my friends."

674113,42117560,2015-08-11,31975176,Liu,"Ms.Beth is very friendly and willing to give help. Her house is easy to access  I-5, I-90. Also I saw a bus number 7 heading for downtown which is also close to her house . There are many on street parking spaces around the house. There are a lot of Asian restaurants around her house which are mostly operated by Chinese and Vietnamese.  Also her house has a good mountain view at dinning room which was deep impressed me espeially one day when I get up  on cloudy day. "
674113,42495924,2015-08-13,25355736,Amber,"Beth is so nice! I arrived 4 hours late and she waited up for me until Midnight. The room is very clean, fresh everything. Including water, towels, mints and blankets. She also provides coffee, tea and snacks for breakfast. It's a beautiful location. About a 15 minute drive from Downtown (Pikes Market). Quiet with a comfy bed. My stay was perfect. Thanks Beth! "
674113,42868236,2015-08-16,3138895,Andrejs,"I can definitely recommend staying here. Beth was very friendly and welcoming, and I felt she's the kind of person that you can have a friendly conversation with on almost any topic. The room was nice, clean and had plenty of amenities. It's possible to park right next to the house, and central Seattle is just a 10 minute drive away."
674113,43373023,2015-08-19,1925693,Madeline,"Beth was kind, warm and easy to work with . Her smile lit up the room. She made the stay as comfortable as home. The room and description were accurate. 
The location easy to use bus and light rail. Ill be back! "

674113,43816000,2015-08-22,21366795,Rebecca,"The listing was extremely accurate and location convenient to the link. Beth was awesome. She had a series of teas, bread, and other food available for use. Towels and shampoo ready to be used were also available which was awesome for someone travelling from very far away. I would definitely recommend Beth, she was a very welcoming host! "
674113,43975136,2015-08-23,3309941,Cheryl,"Bethy was very open and friendly, explaining where to find the amenities and how to use the security door. There was plenty of room to enjoy the sunshine on the front and back decks and a full service grocery store just down the hill. I enjoyed visiting with her while watching a program and had a very comfortable bed for a much needed rest. The Rainier area had many dining options about 11 blocks to the SE."
674113,44901238,2015-08-30,32890549,Franziska,"I stayed two nights at Beth's home and felt very welcomed. The room is just as described and clean. Transportation to Downtown is easy as well and there is a Safeway, Starbucks, Taco Bell, etc just around the corner. I would definitely stay again!"
674113,45391820,2015-09-02,8210061,Stefan,"Der Aufenthalt bei Beth war toll. Das Zimmer war genau wie beschrieben  und das Badezimmer ist vielleicht 2m direkt gegenüber auf der anderen Seite des Flurs. Morgens gab es sogar Frühstück. Bei Beth und ihre Familie wird man einfach sofort freundlich aufgenommen.Perfekt eine der besten Gastgeber nur zu empfehlen.
Vielen Dank nochmal Beth !!!"

674113,46083736,2015-09-07,19471800,Matt,"I only was at Beth's place for the night, and because I showed up so late, didn't get to meet her. The room and house were very clean and quiet. The place is perfect for one person."
674113,46280492,2015-09-09,14115596,Patrick,"Although I did not get to interact with Beth after our initial meeting, I very much enjoyed my short stay. The place was generally quiet and clean. There was tea/coffee and some food on the dining room table; however, I did not get any. I did appreciate the two bottles of water and peppermints that were waiting for me in my room. The wifi worked great since I had to do some schoolwork during my stay. The neighborhood seemed safe. I walked around in the evening to get dinner only a few minutes from the house. If taking the public transportation, it's only a short walk away. I definitely recommend Beth as a host and her house as a place to stay during your visit to Seattle."
674113,46782316,2015-09-13,42530487,Nick,"Loved staying here. Super warm and kind people that caring for the house, and very great location. Used the bus system a lot. Will try to book again if I stay in the area again."

The neighbourhood is quiet and I felt safe all the time. Beth and her aunt are the perfect hosts, I was even given a tour around the neighbourhood by Beth's aunt! Thank you! And there is always fresh coffee in the morning and stuff for breakfast. "
674113,48254409,2015-09-24,31279165,Will,"This was the second time I stayed at Beth's. As before, everything was as advertised and Beth was as welcoming and accommodating as before."
674113,48328415,2015-09-25,9199796,Joy,"This was very nice place to stay.  It was enjoyable chatting with Beth.  She is very generous and helpful.  Very convenient location- easy walk to Columbia City and public transportation. 
 "
674113,48964530,2015-09-29,44585290,Aaron,"Beth was an incredibly warm host. She makes you feel like an honored guest! House is an easy walk to Light rail and quiet at the same time. The fresh roasted coffee was amazing, thanks so much!"
674113,49059295,2015-09-30,14656222,Holly,"Although I did not get to spend much time talking with Beth, she was very accommodating and welcoming.  She made sure I had everything that I needed and offered hot tea when she found out I lost my voice.  It is exactly as described; the room was a perfect space to rest and refresh while in Seattle!"
674113,49173902,2015-10-01,44878358,Masataka,Bethさんの対応は大変優しく心暖まるものでした。初めてのアメリカ旅行で初めてのairbnbでしたが、全く違和感なく、寧ろ、ゆっくり寛ぐことができました。次回は、家族で伺いたいと思います。ありがとうございました。
674113,49387115,2015-10-03,8801358,Satish,I really liked staying at Beth's place due to the neighborhood's atmosphere and its proximity to Seattle's downtown and museums. The room was clean and comfortable and it was very possible to have a quiet night's sleep. Beth was also very accessible through messaging and gave me good advice about driving in the city. I would definitely stay here again.
674113,49635196,2015-10-05,42622796,Chelsea,"Clean and comfy stay, very welcoming! Nice quiet home in a convenient location. Morning coffee was the best, thank you!"

Great place"
674113,50155756,2015-10-09,3074964,Jiří,I stayed at Beths only one night but she was very helpful and we talked for a little bit when I arrived. The house was really nice and clean and room looked great. Thnaks for staying. I would really recommend this place to everyone! Quite good location as the light rail is quite close (10mins walking)
674113,50346346,2015-10-11,44838611,Lauren,"Staying with Beth was amazing! She was very welcoming, her house was beautiful and clean! This was my first experience and I was pleasantly pleased. If I come back to Seattle, I will stay here again!"
674113,50851998,2015-10-15,3562983,Mark,Beth was a lovely host. The room was as pictured and described. I would stay here again. 
674113,51532978,2015-10-21,10263752,John,Super friendly host. Location was ideal and not too far from the stadiums.
674113,51647433,2015-10-22,45911513,Nina,"Beth and DeDe were great hostesses! I was welcomed right away and they were open to conversations and hugs. They were very easy going and made me feel right at home. If I ever came back to that area, I would definitely stay at this house. Thank you so much for everything you did, I look forward to when we can meet up again and talk for longer. I learned a lot from you both, keep up what you are doing. 3 "
674113,51967153,2015-10-25,5220674,Lora,"I loved the neighbourhood the AirBnB was in, it was super easy to catch transit, walk to the grocery store and wander around looking at the cute houses. 

The room was cute and was as shown in the images. Beth had tea and coffee out for her guests.

Thanks Beth!"
674113,52059360,2015-10-26,12265275,Carol,Beth is a gracious host and very friendly. The room was clean and comfortable.  I really appreciated the alternate directions to her home if you have heavy luggage.
674113,52251296,2015-10-27,12224254,Anni,"I really enjoyed my stay with Bethy! I only stayed for one night, but Beth and her aunt made me feel warm and welcomed. The room and the whole house were thoughtfully prepared. There were poundcake on table when I arrived and coffee made when I woke up in the morning. Absolutely and great stay."
674113,52754741,2015-11-01,6097333,Karen,Beth was wonderful friendly warm and makes you feel right at home
674113,53133267,2015-11-05,43157781,Jayden,Location was pretty comfy and room was just same as photos. Beth and Didi are very sweet. I was only able to stay for 2 nights and I feel safe in the house. And Beth and Didi gave me a lot of advises for a tour and safety. Thank you Beth and Didi.
674113,55510032,2015-12-01,48296210,Justin,"Beth and her aunt were incredible hosts! I highly recommend this cottage to all. Upon arrival her aunt was incredibly welcoming and had me sit down so we could get to know each other. She even offered to drive me to my destination, but unfortunately she had a flat tire! 

Beth, her aunt and her entire family are incredibly hospitable. Everytime I saw them they took interest in me and even had me hang out with their extended family who was visiting. Very sweet, genuine people!!! 

The home is well-kept and clean.
The kitchen is communal and available to you.
Bedroom #2 shares a bathroom with only one other individual; no conflicts arose there.

The rooms are close together, so it is ideal to be mindful of noise.

The location is VERY close to a bus stop, which was super convenient to help me get downtown several times!

Loved my first experience with Air BNB - thank you for motivating me to continue using this service and showing me what is possible!"
6328923,33487514,2015-05-28,34299834,Clint,"Great host, home and location! Their system of the double lockout and a place for me to park was perfect for my business trip to Seattle! 
"
6328923,33625482,2015-05-30,25519670,Megan,"No warmer welcome exists than the one that you'll be met with at the Cozy Oasis! Joe and Ronnimae have designed a space with everything you'll need to be comfortable and feel at home, including a basket of goodies for guests and an air-pop popcorn maker with popcorn! Their clean and well-organized space is decorated with darling furniture and Seattle-themed art as well as up-to-date city guides, event listings and weekly papers to show you all Seattle has to offer. Their love for the Capitol Hill area shines through in this comfy and fun space.

Because you enter the location and your room through a second entrance with a keycode rather than through the house, if you are looking for a more private experience then the Cozy Oasis is perfect. However, Joe and Ronnimae are so friendly, fun to talk to and excited to suggest what Capitol Hill has to offer that if you prefer to get to know your hosts a little bit, this place is also perfect!"
6328923,33976124,2015-06-02,34777133,Bette,The host canceled this reservation 105 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
6328923,35119241,2015-06-15,24600999,Nick,I would highly recommend people who travel to Seattle to stay here. Joe got everything ready for you and all you have to do is pack your bag and buy the flight ticket. The place is absolutely quiet and peaceful. The location of the house is perfect. The bus station is 5 mins walk and you can even walk to downtown Seattle if you really wanted to. Description they provide on the website is pretty accurate so you will get what you expect or even more in my opinion. 
6328923,36297759,2015-06-27,34004606,Kinsey,Joe was very welcoming and flexible.  Gave us a lot of information regarding the neighborhood and sights to see.  The place is in a great walking neighborhood.  It was very easy to leave our car and sightsee on foot.  The place was immaculate and organized.  Thanks!
6328923,37761078,2015-07-10,27220852,Brian,"Joe contacted us the day of our check-in to see when we'd be arriving. We ended up checking in a few hours early, and Joe was very friendly, showing us all of the amenities they have for guests: coffee, fresh water in a thermos, bottled water, and skittles. He also gave us advice on how to get around on public transit. The house is very conveniently located near 2 bus routes, so we never had an issue getting around.

I would definitely recommend this to a friend."
6328923,38133408,2015-07-13,34123905,Liz,"Great location nestled in the heart of Capitol Hill! Easy access to downtown Seattle as well. We felt secure with the key pad on the outer door as well as the bedroom door. They thought through all the accommodations needed - including bathroom supplies, coffee and snacks, tourist brochures, etc. The room was small but it fit our needs and we felt comfortable. 

"
6328923,39233613,2015-07-21,17941151,Eric,"We spent one day and night here on our way back to the Bay Area from Whidbey Island.  It was cozy and comfy indeed - right near the hip Pike/Pine neighborhood, where we discovered the charming ""Tavern Law"" bar/restaurant and its genuine speakeasy.

Joe was our contact, and he couldn't have been warmer or more accommodating, with a snappy East Coast sense of humor that has withstood his 29 years in Seattle.

Would gladly return to the cozy oasis.
"
6328923,42320839,2015-08-12,5886223,Henryk  Ingrid,"We had a very very good stay, the house is located perfectly in a pretty neighborhood with good restaurants. This family has organized everything very well! Everything you need is available and marked with signs. This is very convenient. They gave us many ideas for our own B&b. Super super hosts, compliments!"
6328923,42434803,2015-08-13,37894732,Robin,"My teenage daughter and I were in Seattle for one night during a tour of colleges in the Pacific Northwest, and we chose ""The Oasis"" because of its proximity to Seattle University. I was initially nervous about sharing the common space and bathroom with strangers since I was traveling with my daughter, but I emailed Joe, who was quick to answer my questions and easily quelled my misgivings. I'm glad he did, because our stay was pleasant, the room was comfortable, and our hosts provided us with all sorts of useful and fun amenities (my daughter was delighted with the popcorn and Skittles) that made our stay enjoyable. The neighborhood is fantastic--great for walking and exploring, and SU is walking distance. We came in a little earlier than planned, and Joe's son greeted us when we arrived. We rented a parking space as did the couple staying in the other of Joe's rentals. We got the smaller of the two spaces, and I was nervous about parking our rental car in such a tight space (I'm not the best of drivers...). Joe's son didn't hesitate to find two alternatives, and our car spent the night in the next door neighbor's more spacious driveway. All in all, a great experience with attentive and laid back hosts. We would definitely stay here again."
6328923,44435592,2015-08-26,33965589,Coral,"We didn't get to meet Joe and Ronniemae but we did have an awesome time in their lovely space! It is extremely central and a fantastic place to stay as it's very close to food, drinks and just being in Capital Hill. They are very thoughtful to the needs of a weary traveler and provided things like hot chocolate and a popcorn and candy :) We loved the privacy of a separate entrance and your own living space to chill out and play boardgames which were there too! Big shout out also to Dan who helped us get settled in and Mitchell who helped us with easing out of this wonderful place!"
6328923,45569998,2015-09-04,3432470,Nicholas,Joe and Ronimae's place was fantastic. Their house is beautiful and covered in plants and the room and living space is well equipped and very private. It seems that they have thought of every last detail. We didn't have much interaction with them during our stay but they are incredibly nice and helpful!
6328923,45685911,2015-09-05,16686303,Mercedes,We had a great experience staying with Joe and Ronnimae. Their house is ideally located in Cap Hill with lots of awesome restaurants within walking distance. Everything was super clean and it's clear that a lot of thought goes into providing a positive airbnb experience for their guests. We'd definitely stay here again! 
6328923,46148206,2015-09-08,205858,David,"Great location in Capitol Hill.  Very clean, cozy and comfortable.  Shared living space and bathroom with private, secure bedrooms.  Joe met me as I arrived and made me very welcome.  I will definitely stay here again if I am in the Seattle area. "
6328923,46611805,2015-09-12,2945887,Ijun,"Joe was amazing! My friend got in first and checked in with Joe, yet Joe still texted me later in the evening to make sure that I arrived in Seattle alright! He also texted us local events to attend in case we were in search of things to do. We also really enjoyed meeting the people who were staying in the other room! I was originally quite apprehensive staying in a place with other strangers but it was actually quite lovely and we got to share tips about different restaurants to try/things to see! The location is amazing in terms of a plethora of delicious restaurants to check out. "
6328923,48451399,2015-09-26,2835509,Diane,We had a lovely stay at Joe and Ronnimae's place.  Everything was as advertised. The location was fantastic. Capitol Hill is a great neighborhood and a fairly easy walk to downtown. Joe made us feel very welcome. We especially enjoyed his text messages letting us know about interesting happenings in the neighborhood. We would definitely stay there again.
6328923,50246019,2015-10-10,1338248,Rachna,Everything was perfectly comfortable and easy! The locations is great as it is walking distance to all things fun in the area.
6328923,50768354,2015-10-14,35242591,Chris,"Joe was a very laid back guy and a great host. The room is very small and a little bit dark, but had everything we needed and is fine if you're just using it as a base to stay. The location is perfect for bars and restaurants in Capitol Hill. Good place in a great area. Thanks!"
6328923,51638103,2015-10-22,24500053,Maria,"My sister and I stayed here for a little less than a week and had a great experience! The location is amazing. We mostly walked the whole time and used Uber a few times. To get there from the airport we took the light rail all the war to the end then Ubered (only like $7-$8). Downtown is a very pleasant 30 minute or so walk from there and there are tons of great spots to eat/drink nearby which we discovered on our first night there thanks to Joe's recommendations. This place has everything you need to be comfortable. The bed was great (even though it did seem a little short, but I guess my sister and I are kind of tall!) Throughout our visit, Joe was always keeping in touch and making good recommendations, many of which we ended up doing. I like that there is a fridge for leftovers and a microwave. Capitol Hill is an awesome neighborhood and I would definitely stay here again. "
2386589,10694341,2014-03-03,12212892,Kit,Kabir and his house are amazing as everyone else here says. The apartment is in a great location close to everything and quiet. There is also a great view of the space needle from the living room. I woudl highly recommend this house and its host to anyone that is wanting to check out Seattle. 
2386589,10867349,2014-03-10,9605047,Lucas,"Had a great time staying at Kabir's place in Capital Hill. The apartment is very clean and comfortable, and he was very easy to work with on checking in late in the day. Capital Hill can be a very busy, party going place from what we saw on other streets on friday and saturday nights, but Kabir's place was exceptionally quiet! There are plenty of great restaurants, bars and coffee shops within a short walk. I would suggest to anybody."
2386589,10990473,2014-03-16,2632817,Brett,"We absolutely loved our stay at Kabir's place!  We loved the location as it was so close to many nearby restaurants and bars.  Also, it is only 1.6 miles from the space needle and about a mile from downtown/the market.  We literally walked everywhere our whole trip.  Kabir's place was also very clean and well kept.  He has travel magazines and breakfast for the morning!  Overall, a great space!  We would definitely stay there again in the future.  Thanks so much Kabir!"
2386589,12314962,2014-04-28,5066459,Dave,"Kabir's apartment was terrific!  Great spot to hang my hat for a quick trip into Seattle.  Great location and comfortable.

Easy to communicate with and very accommodating. "
2386589,12443446,2014-05-02,1544213,Michael,"The place is neat and cozy, near bars coffee shops and restaurants and a close walk to downtown. Kabir is very logistically competent, and every little detail is taken care of before you step foot inside. Stay here!"
2386589,12629888,2014-05-06,9831268,Mandy,"Kabir's place was great, really close to a lot of bars, shops. and a great breakfast spot!! It's about a 1-1 1/2 miles to pike's place, 1 mile to space needle, and 2-3 miles from kerry park, so that was nice! The place was overall pretty clean and similar to the pics which was nice to see. I would recommend staying at Kabir's if you're visiting seattle for a couple of days and need a place to stay!"
2386589,13426630,2014-05-27,1788344,Anna,"Kabir's apartment was awesome. Functional, near everything, close to a cool neighbourhood. It was a good sized apartment. And fit 3 people comfortably. I didn't get to meet Kabir but he seemed like a good guy. I would definitely stay here again. Thanks Kabir!"
2386589,14982204,2014-06-30,6212727,Charlie And Lindy,"I've found that there are two main types of airbnb's: those that feel like impeccably curated spaces that rival the nicest hotel suites, and those that feel like you're crashing with a friend for the weekend who just stepped out. Kabir's space is the latter type. There's nothing wrong with that- the location is great and it was easy to contact Kabir to get the keys and find our way around. The park is a block away and all of Capitol Hill's bars and restaurants are a short walk."
2386589,15335452,2014-07-07,16377252,Michelle,"Kabir's place was in a fantastic location! We could walk to countless restaurants and shops! The space needle and waterfront was a tad of a longer walk but totally do-able. Kabir was a gracious host and very responsive in all his communication regarding our stay and logistics for getting the keys etc. I would definitely recommend Kabir's place to anyone visiting Seattle and wanting to be in a hip and trendy neighborhood. The only drawback is he parking in the neighborhood is pretty tough, but if you don't have a car it's perfect! (There is a public lot nearby to park but it has weird hours so we needed to move our car a few times). "
2386589,16096479,2014-07-22,15913202,Janell,"Kabir was a great host. He wanted to get to know us a little and even met us to give us his keys. His tv remote had broken a few days before  and he had ordered a new one. He checked in with us to make sure that it was working properly. We stayed in 3 different airbnb places during our trip, but we felt most at home at Kabir's! He even left us some chips, salsa, and beer! The neighborhood was really cool. Analog coffee and Annapurna (Nepalese food) were so close. There are also some great bars within walking distance. "
2386589,16312297,2014-07-25,17421334,Harvey,"Kabir was a very welcoming host.  He even left a bowl of assorted beverages as well as local maps and magazines to help us orient ourselves in Seattle. 

The description and pictures were 100% accurate. 

Kabir was an excellent communicator before, during and after our stay.

2386589,16729506,2014-08-01,652957,Hannah,"Kabir was a great host, very communicative. He provided an extra air mattress and sheets and had a stack of things to do around Capitol Hill, Seattle, etc. I will stay here again. "
2386589,16920758,2014-08-04,17837169,Graeme,"Great place, great location, and a great host!"
2386589,18907043,2014-09-02,14020694,Gretchen,"Kabir is a terrific host.  Extremely accessible and communicative before and during our trip.  And there were snacks waiting for us upon arrival.

The apartment is exactly as shown and had everything we needed.  A pleasant surprise was the awesome view of the Space Needle!

We attended PAX Prime at the Convention Center and the walk was easy both ways.  I was worried about walking back up the hill, but it was a breeze.

Overall, Great Experience!"
2386589,21627049,2014-10-20,9041076,Lynn,"Kabir's apartment is perfectly situated for a visit to Seattle. We walked everywhere we needed to go in the Capitol Hill area and Downtown. 

Although we didn't meet Kabir, as he was out of town, his directions for picking up keys and finding the apartment was easy to follow. It was well appointed and had everything we needed. A car isn't really needed if you stay at Kabir's, at least not for us. Thank you and we hope to visit Seattle again soon!"
2386589,24004796,2014-12-16,3100658,Caroll,"Such a great location!!! Kabir was very organized and helpful in making my first Airbnb experience a great one. The apartment was very charming (I loved the brick walls!). Although most of my visit in Seattle was spent out and about, I greatly appreciated how amazingly quiet the apartment was. Wonderful experience overall! Merci Kabir  =)"
2386589,24092915,2014-12-19,524198,Dan,Excellent location and comfy apartment with all the amenities. Loved the used bookstore right next door. 
2386589,24379388,2014-12-27,17849640,Nao,Capitol Hillニとても近く、Downtownへのアクセスもバスで15分程度と、便利な立地でした。室内は靴を脱いでいるようにしているせいか、部屋も十分清潔で、キッチン周りもひと通り揃っているのでほとんど不自由はありません。すこしベッドの部屋が12月ということもあり少し寒かったですが、掛け布団が薄いながら十分保温力があり、寝る際にはほぼ気にはなりませんでした。シャワーのお湯の調整は難しかったです。急に熱くなったり冷たくなったり…。こればかりは仕方ないのかもしれませんが。とはいえ、ホテルに住むよりも圧倒的に安い料金で快適に過ごすことができたのでよかったです。家主さんとはメールでのやりとりが素早く行えたので安心でした。
2386589,24480517,2014-12-29,22862816,Vivo,"The place was very cozy in an amazing location! It was very easy to go to the Capitol Hill bars from this address, and there is plenty of food nearby too. The apartment itself is clean and friendly, we had a great stay."
2386589,25331022,2015-01-12,25401505,Missy,"My friends and I planned a short girls trip to Seattle and was very lucky to have come across this place! Kabir was extremely helpful and worked with me on times which made things a lot easier for us getting in and out of the place. His place was exactly like it was described and we would love to visit again. This place was at a fabulous location. Very close to great food places, coffee places, and bars. In addition, it was a hot spot for Uber!! We came at a pretty cold time of year, and the place was pretty cold, however, Kabir did provide lots of blankets and we got over it! We are from Texas... so 40 degrees was not ideal for us =p Overall, we had a great experience and would definitely come back again! Thank you Kabir for the great advice and providing such a great home for us. It was great meeting you and if you ever need a place in LA, Austin, Houston, or Corpus Christi please let us know :-)"
2386589,25819186,2015-01-26,25515380,Rochelle,"Kabir was a great host! I didn't get to meet him because he was out of town, but he was great with communication and very accommodating with getting us the key and checking in and checking out. Along with some brochures for the city, he even left us a cute welcome basket telling us to enjoy our stay! His apartment was in a great location too! A close enough walk to some pretty great bars and restaurants but on a pretty quiet street. Overall, my friends and I loved his place!! I would definitely recommend staying here! "
2386589,26091375,2015-02-02,3872026,Andrew,Our stay at Kabir's place couldn't have gone more smoothly. He was very helpful and readily available via email to answer any questions. Great location and a very cozy apartment!
2386589,27109782,2015-02-25,14611857,Kari,"Kabir's place was lovely. The location was great, very close to shops and restaurants we could walk to. The bedroom is on an inner wall so it was nice and quiet in comparison. He left us with a nice welcome bottle of wine and maps and guidebooks for our first trip to Seattle. Check-in was a breeze and communication was prompt via e-mail and text."
2386589,27353467,2015-03-02,11094525,Maddie,"Kabir was very attentive and communicative from the start. He got in touch right away to coordinate logistics and answer any questions, and stayed available throughout our stay. The apartment itself was in a prime location, with lots of light and an impressive view of Seattle and the space needle. We had room to spread out and relax. The building was quiet and removed, so it was easy to sleep there. The kitchen was pretty well stocked, except no kettle and no way to make coffee. Overall, we had a great stay and would stay at Kabir's again in the future. "
2386589,27483896,2015-03-05,2578676,Lauren,"Kabir's apartment is located in the heart of Capitol Hill, convenient to great restaurants and bars. It was a perfect match for us (rural Alaskans on a short vacation in the city). The place itself is warm and functional, with a surprisingly large living space. We enjoyed soaking up the afternoon sun and listening to music on the couch. The bedroom's got exposed brick and a cozy bed, but we were missing a top sheet and overheated a little. Worth bringing your own. The towels and other linens that Kabir provided were excellent. We never saw him during our stay, but his instructions on accessing the apartment - and little signs posted throughout the place - were perfectly clear. Kabir was easy to reach on messenger and overall, a fantastic host. "
2386589,27664924,2015-03-09,16213689,Hollyanne,"Kabir's apartment was perfect! Great location and he was incredibly helpful during the whole process. I highly recommend a stay here. Thanks, Kabir! "

2386589,28669765,2015-03-28,29075011,Sandra,"Kabir was an excellent host! It was easy to communicate with him during our stay. He left us snacks and drinks which was appreciated after a long road trip. His apartment is walking distance from coffee shops, restaurants, and bars. Overall, my friends and I enjoyed the stay. Highly recommend his apartment!  "
2386589,29053645,2015-04-03,27754818,Zoe,"Kabir was a wonderful host! He left us a nice note with snacks and wine upon our arrival, and everything about this stay was perfect. Kabir's place was within walking distance to everything, checking in/out was a breeze, and he was so quick to communicate and share any info that we needed. Looking forward to renting with him again for future Seattle visits!"
2386589,29342558,2015-04-06,5223448,Reed,"Kabir was a great host! Great communication and detailed instructions. The place was neat and tidy, in a great location. "
2386589,29925503,2015-04-14,13831790,Jennifer,Kabir made us feel very welcome and checked in with us to make sure that we had everything we needed. The apartment was comfortable and clean and the location was right in the middle of where we wanted to be.
2386589,33375816,2015-05-27,12314731,Meghan,"We had a great stay in Kabir's apartment! It was perfectly located in a fun neighborhood with a quick and easy walk to downtown. He was incredibly accommodating and welcoming, and if I ever go back to Seattle I would love to stay here again. Thanks Kabir! "
2386589,33825326,2015-06-01,11542484,Michael,"Kabir was a great host. Upon reservation, his response was very timely and friendly. He did not make me second guess my decision at all. Kabir left great checking in/out instructions and spot on about his complex/neighborhood. I flew into Seattle about 11pm and arrived at his home near midnight and he was out of town so we were unable to meet. Despite this, he provided me instructions that were very thorough. His home was a great place to stay and was in the heart of Capitol Hill - only walking distances from every major tourist hot spot. I highly recommend doing business with Kabir as he has done a great job being a host."
2386589,34499175,2015-06-08,33893798,Craig,"Kabir was very hospitable and friendly.  He responded very quickly to any questions that we had, and made us feel very welcome.  It was a very good first impression of Airbnb."
2386589,35295043,2015-06-17,10703252,Nicholas,"Great, cozy apartment. Perfect for a shot or long stay in Seattle. Amazing walkability in the neighborhood, especially for first timers to the city. Would gladly stay again next time I am in Seattle. Kabir was super flexible to our arrival time and accessibility to him and to the apartment was easy. And just as a general rule or principle, any apartment adjoining a used bookstore is worth a visit."
2386589,35660613,2015-06-21,31434182,Lauren,A great apartment in a great location. We were able to walk to everything and have a comfortable space to return to after a long day. Kabir was extremely helpful and accommodating. 
2386589,35819242,2015-06-22,26182833,Jenn,"Kabir's place was great! As described, in a solid location in easy walking distance to everything you need, and comfortable. The bed was comfy and the shower had good water pressure (I like these things!). Kabir couldn't have been more welcoming or responsive to messages. He was out of town so we didn't get to meet him, but his instructions were clear and getting in and out was a piece of cake. Would definitely recommend renting from him!"
2386589,37357846,2015-07-06,3851078,Amanda,"My boyfriend and I greatly enjoyed our stay at Kabir's for the 4th. The apartment was in a great neighborhood & in reasonable walking distance from all the main sights in Seattle.  Key pick-up and communication was a breeze, and the apartment has a charming character."
2386589,39979955,2015-07-27,17741518,Nicole,Great place!! Walking distance to pike place and to a lot of great restaurants and bars. Kabir also communicated well and made sure everything was good with us! If I'm back in Seattle I will definitely try to airbnb here again!
2386589,45952298,2015-09-07,10382903,Lawrence,"Kabir's place was great for me and my girlfriend for a long weekend in Seattle. Neighborhood was great and a nice walk into downtown. Kabir's apartment is nice, clean, and had everything we needed for a great trip. We would definitely consider staying here again! "
2386589,50481649,2015-10-12,2262944,Kevin,Really nice flat in an awesome location.  Kabir is an excellent host - great communicator and extremely accommodating.  I'd definitely stay here again - highly recommended!  
2386589,54898467,2015-11-25,20145408,Peter,Great apartment in a great location. View of the space needle from the window. Quick replies and no issues whatsoever. Highly recommended.
2386589,55215941,2015-11-29,13993988,Diane,"Kabir's apartment is very comfortable. It was a great place to kick back  between our visits to family and friends, and it is in a good location for exploring Capital Hill."
2386589,56005907,2015-12-07,40695014,Ava,Kabir's place was perfect. It was clean and very comfortable. Great neighbourhood!!! Would definitely stay here again. Thanks for the hospitality Kabir! 
2386589,57810426,2015-12-29,1010299,Samantha,"Kabir's place was warm, welcoming, and everything we could need for the three of us. The location can't be beat - near all of the bars, groceries, and restaurants. And there's even a view of the Space Needle! Worked perfectly for us. Bonus: parking is free on Sundays on the street. "
5946151,30369437,2015-04-20,2475660,Caitlin,Perfect location in a great neighbourhood. Will's place was exactly what we needed for our short stay in Seattle. The rooftop was beautiful and Will was a great host. Would definitely stay here again ! :)
5946151,31026016,2015-04-30,20027363,Cora,The reservation was canceled 20 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
5946151,31084573,2015-05-01,32079875,Matthew,"Will was a great host! Not only is his place comfy, it is centrally located to all that is Seattle and he had great insight into places to go, eat, etc. I def will call him again next time I'm going to Seattle.. "
5946151,31847720,2015-05-10,8801974,Sean,"Great little studio, perfectly located in the heart of capital hill; with world famous Vivace coffee at your doorstep. What more could you ask for? Will was very easy to work with and beyond flexible ... Overall my visit was a great experience and I would most definitely refer this host to anyone wanting to experience that true Cap hill flavor."
5946151,33727757,2015-05-31,2457606,Andreina,"We stayed over the weekend at Will's place. It is a cozy and nice studio, very nice located in Capitol Hill. Close to downtown and easy access to public transportation, bikes. The area has nice restaurants and lounges. 
Will was great as a host. Very thoughtful and gave us good recommendations of the surroundings. I would definitively stay there again "
5946151,34601386,2015-06-09,18099255,Candice,"Will's place is in a perfect location for exploring Seattle! The rooftop deck gives an awesome view of downtown. The studio itself is just big enough for a solo traveller or couple that doesn't plan to spend much time indoors! Will was flexible for dropping off and returning keys, and gave some great suggestions."
5946151,35304061,2015-06-17,24867648,Meghan,"Will was overall a great host.  The location is excellent, and the views from the rooftop definitely need to be checked out!  

Our one minor issue was that the only wi-fi available was some ""free wi-fi"" network, which never worked for us.  We happened to need wi-fi a lot that week, so it was a bit of a pain.  

Otherwise, recommend this listing!  "
5946151,36404014,2015-06-28,33600702,Caitlin,"Will was a very accommodating host.  He was very flexible with his schedule to give us the keys, working around our late arrival to Seattle on a week night.  He also offered to let us leave our bags in his apartment while we explored the city on our last day.  Will also gave great recommendations for things to do, places to eat and bars with a great local vibe.  His apartment is in a great location in Capitol Hill, being located right on Broadway East.  Many of the ""touristy"" sights are within walking distance or a short drive away."
5946151,37266323,2015-07-05,37283497,Eric,"No better way to explore Seattle than from this historic ground floor studio.  Will was accommodating and made us feel welcome, the room was very clean, and the location is perfect.  We easily walked the neighborhood and downtown, and it is literally steps from public transit.  Free street parking was easy to find a few blocks away.  24hr grocery one block away.  Rooftop deck has amazing views."
5946151,38006755,2015-07-12,15533161,Emma,"Will's place doesn't offer a lot of frills, but it is in the perfect location for anyone wanting to conveniently experience the vibrancy of Seattle. Will was very accommodating and provided fantastic suggestions for great things to see and places to eat. "
5946151,38267742,2015-07-14,32172059,Johnny,"Great spot, amazing time! Cheers for the digs Will!"
5946151,38941554,2015-07-19,13977381,Sarah,Will was a wonderful host. He gave us recommendations for activities and places to eat. The location of his apartment could not be better. It is one block from parking garages and a grocery store. It also only took about 15 minutes to get downtown on the bus. We very much enjoyed the beautiful roof deck. We watched an amazing sunset and had breakfast there. I would definitely stay here again and recommend it to anyone coming to see the city!
5946151,39618705,2015-07-25,6029920,Katie,"Will's place was absolutely perfect for our one-night stay in Seattle. The location is ideal -- close to lots of bars and restaurants -- and he's got a really amazing roof deck with incredible views of the space needle, etc. Communication with Will was easy and he was quick to respond. Will ended up being out of town during our stay, but he arranged for us to pick up the keys from a KeyCafe at a (really great) beer bar nearby his apartment. If we ever make it back to Seattle, we'd love to stay there again!"
5946151,44035424,2015-08-23,2326126,Sheena,"Will did a good job of communicating with us to ensure we were able to get the key prior to our stay, as he was leaving town.

The neighborhood was very young - lots of bars and fun stuff happening in the immediate vicinity.

The room was quite small and not as clean as I expect for an AirBnB rental.  I picked up a cup in the kitchen to use for water, but there was something crusted in it.  The bed was uncomfortable and sagged in the middle, which made for a challenge with two people sleeping in it.

The shower did not drain and the toilet clogged.  The plumbing in that building is clearly in need of serious repair."
5946151,44686175,2015-08-28,40312700,Katie,"Will's place in capitol hill was the perfect location for our two night stay in Seattle. It was close to many bars, restaurants, and shops. The view from his rooftop couldn't be beat. We didn't spend much time in his apartment so it was fine it didn't have any thrills; it was clean and that's all we really needed. As far as hosts go Will was the best. He was easy to get a hold of and very flexible about getting/dropping off the keys. He also took time to tell us about the city and what spots we needed to check out. He answered any questions we had. All in all a good location and host!"
1355094,6142635,2013-07-31,7635094,Robert,"Michael was incredibly friendly and accommodating, but even though I was essentially living in someone else's home, at no point did I feel unwelcome or uncomfortable. He even invited me out to a party which allowed me to socialise within minutes of arriving in the city.

I didn't actually get to meet everyone in the apartment as they are all busy people and I found myself busy too, but it was a nice clean space in a pretty hip and fun area. The room was comfortable with a desk and closet space and some handy guidebook which I probably should have used. I had my privacy, but was also able to ask Michael for info and he always was happy to oblige. 

Overall, a genuinely good experience. I happily recommend."
1355094,6332132,2013-08-08,7614407,Phil,"This apartment is in a great location, easily walkable to downtown while also being close to to cool bars and restaurants.  "
1355094,6357481,2013-08-09,1500517,Walter,"Staying at Mikes place in Seattle was probably the thing that could have happend. He is a very laid back guy, very uncomplicated, which made my stay very easy and fun. Hanging out with him is like being at a friends place. We went out for a couple of drinks and shared some interesting thoughts. 
I'm glad that I stayed at his place and would recommend it to everybody who enjoys learning something about the city you visit, instead of just seeing all the tourist attractions."
1355094,6599204,2013-08-18,2656118,Jean,"We took in all the best of Seattle in our three day stay there, thanks to Michael. His comfy, casual, conveniently located home made the perfect launchpad for all of our adventures as he knew all the dining spots and shortcuts to get everywhere. Our room was cozy, clean and private. We had access to the entire home and enjoyed chilling on the spacious sofa. Michael was warm and inviting and fun; his roommates and international visitors were charming as well. His refreshingly upbeat perspective and abundant smarts made for rich conversation over wine and microbrews. We could not have asked for a better intro to such a great city."
1355094,6641643,2013-08-19,1658761,Sam,"Michael was warm, welcoming and helpful. Other folks in the apartment were also friendly. We had a busy day and spent just a brief time at the room but that time was relaxing and comfortable."
1355094,7048598,2013-09-04,8253036,Jessica,My friend and I had a great time staying in Seattle at Michael's house. He and his roommates were all very welcoming and accomodating. Definitely a fun place to stay if you're young and into meeting new people. He even drove us to the bus station at the end of our trip!
