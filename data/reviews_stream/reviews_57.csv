He was super communicative which was really helpful!  Good location, Cafe Flora around the corner was a delicious spot for breakfast!  Really nice!"
794633,49274895,2015-10-02,43980234,Jack,We had a great experience at the guest house!  Although we never got the privilege of meeting J face to face he was very helpful via messaging.  He even told us to beware of the buckeye nuts (which came from a beautiful tree right outside the back window) falling on the roof!  The place in clean and comfortable just as the pictures show and J is just as helpful as all the reviews say he is.  Very great first night in Seattle!
794633,49843002,2015-10-06,38400224,Tonya,J. communicated often and clearly.  The property was lovely and the photos accurately portrayed the property.  It was super nice and decorated nicely and we felt comfortable and safe staying there.

794633,50696063,2015-10-13,45475108,Jack,Very clean and simple.  Fit our needs perfectly.  Much better than a hotel room and in a cool neighborhood to boot!
794633,50809127,2015-10-14,13495934,Thomas,Great find for a one night stay (or more) in Seattle. Easy to find and a quick drive from just about anything in the city. J was very hospitable and let me know that the guest house was ready for check-in a little early (per my last minute request). Will definitely look this listing up next time I'm in the area.
794633,50878919,2015-10-15,15600689,Lauren,"The guest house is AWESOME - neighborhood is great, we were able to walk easily to grab meals and the arboretum is right down the street. The house itself is updated and modern, we loved the large, comfy king bed and although we weren't there long enough to take advantage, the kitchen and dining table are nice for longer stays. Julius was quick to respond and made great recommendations for places to eat in the area - we were only there for a night but will definitely be back on our next visit! "
794633,50913603,2015-10-16,30620692,Zhiqian,整洁干净，入住顺利，街区安全、安静！

It was very clean, the bed was comfortable and it feels like your own place as it's private and tucked in the back corner of their lot.  Also enjoyed how close it is for walking to some great little restaurants including Cafe Flora.  "
794633,51264334,2015-10-19,18536975,Cristine,"I've stayed in this space several times now for regular travel to Seattle. The host never fails to have it just perfect when I arrive--clean, porch light on, and never a hitch. I hope to make this a regular stay spot for my future travel!"
794633,51817479,2015-10-24,2408881,Dana,"J was the perfect host...thoughtful, attentive, quick to respond to all communication in the days leading up to our stay along with the duration of our time in his lovely cottage. We had everything we needed (and some excellent reading:) Can't recommend this place enough, we'll be back!"
794633,51965074,2015-10-25,33410522,Christy,The guest house is tucked behind j's house and it was very to find. And my golly! The room was extremely beautiful and kept very very clean. Walking distance to many restaurants and bars. We only stayed for 2 nights and 3 days but wanted to stay more! Will definitely come back!  
794633,52307308,2015-10-28,30723106,Hannah,"Fantastic place, great location on a short distance by car into the city. Lots of great restaurants in the local area. Julius was a great host and very quick go reply to emails. Would defiantly visit again."
794633,52431925,2015-10-29,9306947,Meg,"We really enjoyed staying in J's guest house. He made the stay extremely easy (quick access without interaction, quickly responded to questions via text / AirBNB).  The home was beautiful, clean, and exactly what we needed for our trip.  Close to many shops / restaurants and a few minute drive to downtown.  Coming from a person who is marginally germaphobic and has OCD - the home surpassed our standards! :) "
794633,52557357,2015-10-30,8343153,Jen & Bob,Just wonderful. Tucked away in a peaceful haven of comfort while still convenient to everything. Walking the Arb and walking to breakfast at Belle Ep made it even better. 
794633,52643056,2015-10-31,31241431,Robert,It was very welcoming and the process was super simple. A great little house in a good neighborhood;

The guest house was clean and filled with all the amenities needed for my stay. The location was easy to find , and the neighborhood was quiet. Communication was speedy and concise. I will stay here again and recommend to everyone visiting the area."

Lots of reading material (would be great for a longer stay) and other amenities (table, dishes, coffee maker etc.). The coded entry was very convenient and made check in hassle-free. There are a variety of restaurants in walking distance, as recommended on the listing we tried the Voila! Bistrot which was lovely. Would definitely stay here again!"
794633,53855354,2015-11-13,3159797,Erika,"What a gem this place is! J has done a wonderful job creating a comfortable and private space in a cute and conveniently located neighborhood.  It was also immaculately clean, and communication with J was a breeze.  We really couldn't have asked for anything more...except to meet the creator of these stellar digs!  Already looking forward to our return.  Thanks, J!"
794633,53897060,2015-11-14,46327561,Greg,"J's space was great! We celebrated our anniversary in Madison Park and the space was nice and warm, waiting for us, after our night out. It was quite cozy."
794633,54356225,2015-11-18,28543925,Melanie,"We really enjoyed the stay and J's Guest house. It was a sweet little room with everything you need. Really clean and comfortable. J was a great host, replied quickly on messages and was very flexible with our extra wishes :) the neighborhood was pretty nice with good opportunities for breakfast and dinner. The bus station is also near where the busses drive to downtown directly to pike place. Totally recommend it."
794633,54404643,2015-11-19,6846423,Dorothy,"J's guest house is lovely! Its private, cozy, and easy to access. The bed was incredibly comfortable and it was a perfect place for my quick business trip to Seattle."

794633,54694288,2015-11-23,18536975,Cristine,"I made the right decision when I decided to book J's space for my regular travel to Seattle for work. It became my little, private, home away from home where I could arrive any time and always feel welcome and comfortable. J was always quick to communicate, follow-up, and make sure every need was met. Highly reccomended!"
794633,54908995,2015-11-25,48299797,Kevin,"Great place, comfortable, clean, quiet, safe. Everything u need in a short stay, thx J!!  J is also great at communicating through the process."
794633,55088722,2015-11-27,9429487,Harry,Awesome experience all the way around.  The place was exactly as described and pictured and our host Julius was as cool as could be. We arrived a bit late in the evening to check in and it wasn't an issue at all.  Made us feel super welcomed. Definitely will be staying there again.
794633,55115287,2015-11-28,43325287,Jonathan,"Excellent place to stay, looks just like the pictures and was very cozy. Check in and out was very easy and the place had everything we needed for 2 nights. There are even lots of books to read! Would definitely stay here again. "
794633,55735324,2015-12-05,3271702,James,"J is a great host! The place is so wonderful and private and clean. It is in an ideal location, right around the corner (a block and a half) from one of our favorite restaurants, Cafe Flora. The bed is quite comfy, and the internet was fast and worked perfectly. We would stay with J again for sure. Cheers and happy travels! --James and Ralph"
794633,55961735,2015-12-07,10992568,Mario,Fantastic visit!  Great location and space.  No complaints and hope to be back soon.
794633,56261682,2015-12-11,20419662,Michael,"J's home was perfect in terms of the location and the description matched the actual residence. The neighborhood was quiet and peaceful. It was easy walking distance to a coffee shop, bakery as well as restaurants and fashionable boutiques (if you go for that sort of thing, which I do not) The great thing about residence was that it was completely private. One would have to be very loud or just plain rude in order to be a disturbance!. Again it was the perfect place for my 4-day visit to the Emerald City!  "
794633,56324476,2015-12-12,49757725,Yaojie,"It was an absolutely amazing stay at J's guesthouse. It was wonderful to have such a warm and homey place to rest in after a long train ride. The location is right off of Madison and a super straightforward ride to downtown. 
J is a great host and always replies to questions within minutes. We felt lucky we found J's place. 
Thanks J!"
794633,57047462,2015-12-21,49127226,Connor,"J did a wonderful job explaining things to us before our arrival and ensuring a smooth transition. The space was clean, comfortable, quiet, and tastefully decorated. Great location to stay while exploring Seattle! Thanks!"
5241773,27525736,2015-03-06,15945059,Alice,"This was a wonderful AirBnB experience for me - a last minute plan that worked, and was much improved, by staying with Louis. I had some logistics to accommodate which he took in stride. The communication ahead of time made the arrangements clear, the room was great, the location was what initially attracted me to the listing and proved to be ideal, and what started as a place to stay turned into a lovely experience that started my day in Seattle just right - with sunshine (unusual, I know, and probably not always part of staying there) and fantastic suggestions about where to explore. Louis made me feel very welcome - and helped me avoid my introverted tendencies by making it clear I wasn't imposing. I certainly plan to stay here again next time I am in Seattle."
5241773,27744497,2015-03-10,21563204,Amanda,Louis and Kevin were very welcoming and contacted us in advance to make sure they were home when we arrived. They gave us plenty of pointers as to the sights of Seattle and took the time to explain where everything was downtown and answer any questions we had. We had a great time in Seattle and will definitely be staying with Louis if we ever find ourselves in Town again!
5241773,27970724,2015-03-15,21769316,Deborah,I am glad having had my first AirBnB experience at Louis' place. Louis is very welcoming and makes you feel at home. He shared great tips about spots to visit at Seattle. The room is very comfortable and the house is well located. The right host at the right place to be at Seattle !
5241773,28020709,2015-03-16,2796877,Sarah,"Louis and Kevin welcomed us warmly and introduced us to their two lovely cats. They also set us up with an air mattress and blankets just in case the double bed didn't suit our needs. The house, our room and bathroom were excellently clean with fresh towels. Fantastic neighbourhood, close to restaurants and shops. We really enjoyed our stay in Seattle. Thanks again!!  "
5241773,28155905,2015-03-18,10857115,James,Excellent host. Extremely comfortable and clean room. Allowed me to book at the last minute due to a cancellation.
5241773,28187213,2015-03-19,23317998,Uno,"Louis and Kevin were some of the nicest, sweetest people I have ever met. the cats were adorable, rooms are very nicely decorated, and the whole house had a cosy and antique vibe."
5241773,28493990,2015-03-24,4158314,Gloria,"I had a very pleasant stay with Louis and Kevin. They were super welcoming and made check in and check out a breeze. Their house is awesome, has a lot of character and very clean, it was so enjoyable to stay there! Very comfy bed too. The particular street they are on is safe and quiet but is a two minute walk away from plenty of shops, restaurants, etc. Great time!"
5241773,28619325,2015-03-27,2630567,Mihael,"Staying with Louis and Kevin was a fantastic experience. The charming and comfortable house is in a quiet oasis minutes away from cafes and restaurants. It's a short and interesting walk to the Pike Place Market area. The lodging was spotlessly clean and very comfortable. Louis and Kevin gave me a very warm welcome, even inviting me to their dinner. They are interesting conversationalists, knowledgeable about Seattle. Don't miss out on the opportunity to learn about Seattle from them! Can't recommend highly enough staying with them!"
5241773,28744673,2015-03-29,29449614,Christopher,"Kevin & Louis are great host, and I think their place defiantly the great place to stay in Seattle. 20 mins walk away from downtown, makes it very easy to go around. The house is so cool, well organize, and very cozy. BTW, the two cats in the house are both very friendly, but a little be shy thought. I also enjoy talking with them after a day tour in the city, they give great advises about the city. 
 "
5241773,28802115,2015-03-30,28189363,Christina,Louis and Kevin were great! They provided helpful tips and recommendations for the area. Their place is located in a great area of town with plenty of bars and restaurants within walking distance. The house is super cute and clean. The bed was comfortable with a shared bathroom. It was a great first Airbnb experience and a pleasure to meet the hosts.
5241773,29060307,2015-04-03,5863231,Jorge,"My overall experience was outstanding. Louis and Kevin were very friendly, accommodating and helpful. I had never been in Seattle and I traveled alone. They took the time to sit with me and highlighted major spots to visit in a map which they provided to me. The room in which I stayed was very clean and was just right. The bed was comfortable. The bathroom was very clean. I arrived late on my first day due to a late flight but they were very accommodating in welcoming me late at night. I would definitely stay here again and would highly recommend it. "
5241773,29146786,2015-04-04,15940022,Weiqi,The place is very close to the downtown Seattle. Louis and Kevin are very nice people to chat with. They helped us to find many places of interest.
5241773,29301901,2015-04-06,5461545,Natalie,"Kevin and Louis were very charming and we felt very comfortable and welcome in their beautiful home.  The home was close to transit, Pronto (bike share scheme) and in a delightful, walk-able neighborhood.  "
5241773,29531501,2015-04-08,25084775,Athena,"Louis and Kevin were perfect hosts for my short term stay in Seattle to view apartments. I loved the room and the design of the house, very homey and clean. They have two cats, one who fetches which i adored! I was able to meet Louis late the night i arrived and he helped me find a place to eat since i was starving, then Kevin the next day was able to tell me about the details when renting in Seattle. I would definitely recommend this place to my friends and family when they visit Seattle!
hope to keep in contact with them! "
5241773,29688664,2015-04-11,22261755,Sue,"Louis and Kevin were great hosts - welcoming and informative.  I was at a downtown conference and enjoyed the walk down and back up Pike St (perfect if you LIKE to walk up and down hills, but drive or public transport if you like it flat).

The home is lovely - still a few spots where you can see their ongoing renovation, but it is all tidy and has that cozy ambiance, everything very clean, bed is comfy.  Lovely garden was a site for my sore - wintry Vermont eyes."
5241773,29977051,2015-04-15,5749365,Paul,"Great hosts, lovely house, excellent location, two friendly cats. Everything you could hope from an airbnb.

Kevin and Louis are long term Seattle residents and can help with any questions you may have about the city.

Also a little tip to any visitors, we ate at two restaurants from the below list (il corvo and kedai mekan) and they were both very good.

Louis and  Kevin were very friendly.  There are two cats in the house so if you are sensitive to cat odor it's not the place for you.
I'd definitely stay there again."
5241773,30502237,2015-04-23,28870898,Johanna,"Louis and Kevin were great hosts - they were very friendly, yet unobtrusive. Everything was clean and their yard is beautiful! I spent several days there for a conference, and it was a great 'home away from home!' The neighborhood had lots of places to eat/hang out, and they're a short walk from downtown. Highly recommend!"
5241773,30884246,2015-04-28,13170146,Sandra,"Louis & Kevin made our in experience in Seattle wonderful. They were very friendly and made sure we felt at home during our stay. Their home is very cute and clean, love everything about it. As for location it doesn't get better! They are located just a few blocks away from everything you could possibly want. Also very easy to access public transportation. Oh how could I forget they have the cutest cats Sam & little girl, always ready to snuggle. "

They really did a great job with helping us feel at home and giving us the inside scoop of seattle. The location was perfect and the house/room we're just as good. Kevin and Louis really went out of there way to help us figure places to go and gave great advice on the city. The neighborhood they live in is great and lots to do around the house.

5241773,32863182,2015-05-22,5708746,Colin,"We were quickly in and out but Louis and Kevin made sure to give us everything we needed in their cozy home.

Transportation to downtown Seattle was also convenient near major bus routes as well. I was greeted by Kevin when I first arrived and he made me very welcomed by showing me around the place and provided me with all necessary info for places to see/eat and transportation. The room and house is described exactly what was written in the posting and is well kept and clean! I stayed one night in town before going off to a tour and came back for another night a week later after the tour and before my flight leaves the next morning. Kevin/Louis were really responsive in communications and were also really accommodating in terms when I can arrive and leave! Great hosts!"
5241773,35274997,2015-06-16,1203092,Martha,"Louis and Kevin are the real Airb&B experience. First, of course, they welcome you into this homey space, make you feel at home, give advice, information and more. The place is so cool. I also meet other guests who had also traveled to Oaxaca. I introduced them to my kin who live in Seattle. I feel as if we know each other. "

This was our first Airbnb experience and we have a feeling it is going to be a hard one to beat! Kevin and Lois made us feel extremely welcomed the entire time and gave us excellent recommendations on things to do/where to eat. Downtown Seattle is an easy walk (10-15 min). Capitol Hill is an excellent neighborhood with plenty of places to explore. I would recommend this place to anyone and hope to stay there again when I come back to Seattle!"
5241773,37070199,2015-07-04,34846856,Rebecca,"This was our first Airbnb experience, and Kevin & Louis set the bar extremely high for our next stay! They are some of the most genuinely kind and generous people we have ever met, and the highlight of our stay in Seattle was spending an evening getting to know them on their back porch over a bottle of wine. Their home is in a fun and exciting part of Seattle in Capitol Hill, and we were only a 30 minute walk from Pike Place. Their home is cozy and they have 2 adorable cats, especially Sam, who will hop on the bed and say hello if you welcome him. They made sure we felt at ease and comfortable in their home; it was very clean and felt like a bonafide bed and breakfast. The next time we're in Seattle we absolutely hope to stay with Kevin and Louis again. We had such a lovely experience!"
5241773,37643792,2015-07-09,4660810,Ashley,"Kevin and Louis have created a very comfortable and physically beautiful environment in which to have people stay.  Kevin greeted me when I arrived mid-day from Toronto.  The house and backyard are relaxing places to unwind after a busy day exploring the city.  These guys are so nice and easy to talk to.  Kevin gave me some great suggestions for eating in the neighbourhood, especially for breakfast.  The location is absolutely the best.  You're within walking distance to plenty of good restaurants and bars, eclectic Cal Andersen Park as well as my favourite homemade ice cream place, Molly Moon's.  While close to plenty of action, the home is located on a beautifully quiet street (which I tend to prefer).  In terms of bus routes, it's a snap - a 2-min walk to the bus stop and then you zoom downtown!  However, walking down Pike Street is a great bohemian experience!  Thanks so much guys for a great stay in one of my favourite cities!"
5241773,37875110,2015-07-11,35335365,Brandon,"What a great place to stay.  Louis and Kevin have a nice private room on the main level of their house, and had coffee available in the mornings.  When we got back from a long day visiting local breweries, we got to kick back with them and enjoy a glass of wine in their gorgeous back deck garden.  "
5241773,38393117,2015-07-15,25563980,Michelle,We had a wonderful stay with Louis and Kevin. Louis and Kevin were very kind and flexible with letting us check in early and hold our things on the day that we were leaving. Their location was quite convenient as we did not have a car and did not mind the walk to and from the city. Their two cats were also very cute!
5241773,38502136,2015-07-16,5058805,Joslyn,"Louis & Kevin were fantastic hosts! We got in early in the morning and they met us at the curb, helped carry our bags up to the house, and got us some much needed tea and coffee. We loved chatting with them about what to do in Seattle - and they gave just the right amount of input and guidance while still letting us figure things out and explore independently. They were kind enough to let us store things there before our room was ready, and when we got back after exploring, the room was clean, ready, and they had moved our bags in as well. 

Although we only stayed for 1 night with Louis & Kevin, we would definitely recommend them. The house and room are great, comfortable, homey, and in a great location. My friend (a Seattle-native) was very jealous of our location on Capitol Hill and said we really found a great place. Plus, the welcoming, friendly atmosphere was wonderful - and getting to pet their cats and see their gorgeous gardens were added bonuses. "
5241773,38997419,2015-07-20,26128580,Samantha,"When we arrived Louis was at home waiting for us, he helped us with our luggage and showed us around the house. He also showed us places to go to on a map and we had a chat for a while, this made us feel very comfortable in their home and welcome. The listing was exactly as described and the home is very beautiful. The neighbourhood is also very safe and in a perfect location within walking distance to downtown. We very much enjoyed our stay and had a great time meeting Louis and Kevin and chatting with them, they were perfect hosts. "
5241773,39383392,2015-07-23,2477391,Kim,"I had a very pleasant and restful stay at Louis & Kevin's home in Capitol Hill.  I was attending a conference at Seattle University, and their home is perfectly located between that and the Pike-Pine Corridor.  Restaurants, bars, and shopping all within short walking distance.  Kevin & Louis were both very sweet, as are the cats.  I hope to be back again soon!"
5241773,39532194,2015-07-24,34347445,Christine(Xiaoyan),"This is a pretty clean, cozy house, traditional American style. I slept like a baby, amazing I could be so relaxed. Perfect location in cap hill, just Walking distance to downtown and Seattle university. Louis and Kevin are friendly, would like to stay again next trip for more days."
5241773,39635354,2015-07-25,35316565,Jacquie,"Our stay with Louis and Kevin was fantastic! As hosts, they were both warm and welcoming, taking care to chat with us and give us great pointers on where to go in the city. Their home was beautiful with lots of character and the added bonus of two adorable cats.

We were only here for one night and we were definitely sad to leave.  This is the perfect spot to stay on a visit to Seattle!"
5241773,39916770,2015-07-27,13495776,Hanna,"Staying with Louis and Kevin was the quintessential Airbnb experience; what it should be, why everyone loves staying in them. They were absolutely exceptional hosts with on point neighborhood advice (everyone should try Plum Bistro, as recommended to us by them!) Their home was wonderful, we slept well and the room was quite comfortable, and we enjoyed the amazing space that they have curated. I always felt welcome to join in meals and conversations, which was the highlight of the trip. I wish I could have spent more time with them, however just the weekend was enough to reinforce and remind me how wonderful people can truly be. "
5241773,40127117,2015-07-28,11346406,Greg,"Extremely kind, respectful, and accommodating.  I needed a room for one night at the tail end of a wedding trip and Louis and Kevin were happy to have me in their home. The house is well decorated and the bed I slept in was extremely comfortable. They have an amazing coffee selection and their home is in one of Seattle's hottest neighborhoods. I was out with friends the afternoon of my arrival and Louis and Kevin were very flexible and made sure someone would be available to get me checked in. I would definitely stay here again. "
5241773,40428982,2015-07-31,6149089,Matthew,"Louis and Kevin were awesome hosts, very welcoming, relaxed and happy to share all kind of information about Seattle. They were also great to chat to each day and Louis even very kindly offered to drive us down to the metro on our departure. The house is very comfortable and spacious and it is possible to walk to many of the main tourist sites. The only public transport we used was the monorail to the Seattle Centre. Coffee, tea and water are provided and it was great to enjoy a coffee on the sunny back deck in the morning. Overall, highly recommended choice of accommodation for Seattle!"
5241773,40864160,2015-08-02,39949308,Mauricio,"Prime location (3 min walk from bus stop). Our friendly hosts welcomed us into their house and had set up a comfortable bedroom where we slept soundly; noise was minimum to none. While it was clear that conversation was welcome, it was by no means forced (for those who are introverts). Clean bathroom and provisions were made for those who like a cup of coffee or tea in the morning. Fridge, kitchen, and patio were also made accessible to guests. Unfortunately, we happened to be locked out on accident as we returned home one evening around 1am. I like to think it was an honest mistake and reparations were made. The cats were nice also."
5241773,41049079,2015-08-03,40163416,David,"Amazing house, great guys, wonderful location. Would go back in a heartbeat."
5241773,42720466,2015-08-15,38508187,Matt,"We loved staying at the house on Capitol Hill!! We didn't get a chance to meet Kevin but Louis was so kind and helpful! We sat down with him when we got there and he helped us make plans for our two days in Seattle. His advice was excellent. 

They live in such a neat house with so much character. It's a very comforting and very homey house! We became quick friend with their cats Uno and Dos. They were even great! 

We highly recommend staying here if you are looking to Stay in Seattle! It's close enough to down town by bus, train or even walking. But there is a lot to do around Capitol Hill as well!"
5241773,43043983,2015-08-17,34532288,Marty,"Clean and comfortable, the room was small but sufficient with convenient access to a shared bathroom. The hosts were friendly but not intrusive and provided everything I could need in a place to stay for a weekend in Seattle. I can't imagine a more convenient location if Capitol Hill is your desired destination.   "
5241773,43251719,2015-08-18,8937899,Allen,"We loved this place in the city! Great hosts (printed out maps, told us places to go, allowed us to drop off our bags) and a great neighborhood (close to shops, restaurants, 15 min walk to Pike). Fun to talk to, too - we shared a bottle of wine and they've lived on the street for over 20 years! Would absolutely recommend this place and we'll definitely be staying there again when we come back."
5241773,43404688,2015-08-19,39185378,Mike,"Kevin and Louis were both very good hosts. We had great communication, exchanging several messages before arriving and on the day of arrival and they were more than willing to help us navigate the area. Their helpful suggestions came in handy when my wife and I stayed in their home for one evening. The room itself is quite simple and the linens aren't the same ones used at the Ritz but we found our stay comfortable. There is another room right across the hall and we shared the bathroom with the guests staying there which was never a problem. In all, a great location and very welcoming hosts in modest accommodations. "
5241773,43833343,2015-08-22,9814671,Michael,"Louis & Kevin were great. They managed to accommodate us even though our flight to Seattle delayed us and they gave us great tips for sightseeing. They live walking distance to several breweries for those interested in beer & near the Starbucks Roastery. Downtown is only around a 25 minute walk. The walk is great for seeing Seattle too. There was coffee, tea, a clean room & nice bathroom. All in all, a great experience. Thanks guys!"
5241773,43955268,2015-08-23,37830118,Tori,everything was amazing! Thanks so much Louis and Kevin.  The home was warm and welcoming and our private room was perfect.

5241773,44433761,2015-08-26,16679108,Blake,What an awesome stay. My girlfriend and I were primarily in Seattle for the hiking so this room served us perfectly. The location is great as there are so many places to eat and drink afterwards. Would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a simple room to crash in. Kevin and Lou were excellent hosts. 
5241773,44619074,2015-08-27,37617150,Alex,"Kevin was very pleasant, helpful & recommended the Starbucks Reserve roaster/tasting room while I was in town. Good conversation. Thank you. "

5241773,45479038,2015-09-03,10698153,Giovanni,Louis and Kevin were wonderful hosts. We had great conversations with them on several occasions. They also proved to be a wealth of knowledge about the city (especially when on the hunt for great food). The location was great and we had a very pleasant stay.
5241773,45628743,2015-09-04,42861527,Jennifer,"We had a really great stay.  Louis and Kevin were great hosts and offered a lot of great information about the city.  The neighborhood felt safe and is central to everything you want to do.  The place was clean and had everything we needed for our stay.  

We wish we had more time to stay so if there is chance we can stay here for our next Seattle visit, this would be the place we book!

Thank you Louis and Kevin."
5241773,46373777,2015-09-10,3332633,Jake,"Louis and Kevin's house was a welcoming, simple and stress-free place to stay in a fantastic neighborhood.  They are very hospitable as hosts, very courteous, and were willing to go above-and-beyond such as drawing maps to the best brunch spots, and letting me use their printer and ironing board.  If you enjoy a very pleasant, diverse, chic and walkable neighborhood, this is it."
5241773,46692081,2015-09-13,26486398,Vanessa,"We had a warm welcome at Louis & Kevin's place. Louis was happily providing us with some good tips for our short stay in Seattle and helped us out with any questions we had. We really enjoyed our  two days there and had a great time! 

We definitely highly recommend staying with Louis & Kevin! Thanks for making the beginning of our trip that nice! 

Tamas & Vanessa"
5241773,46956781,2015-09-14,13410119,Josephine,"Louis and Kevin were perfect hosts - it was a lovely and welcoming first stop after doing a long haul flight.

The area was good for us - lots of nice coffee places and restaurants and a 25min walk to the market/observatory tower.

The room and house were really well maintained with a nice character, the cats were cute too! 

Would definitely recommend."
5241773,47352134,2015-09-18,7286198,Phil,"There was a great level of communication with Louis and Kevin as soon as the booking was accepted and it just got better from there. We were able to schedule a time for me to come by and check in and the atmosphere was super inviting and warm. We had a really great conversation about things that have changed in the neighborhood since I used to live near the city and I was given some places to look into that I had forgotten about in the past.

The location of their house was really great too as I didn't need to use the bus at all and just walked around to every where I wanted to go. It was also a really quiet neighborhood and the other guests that were staying in an adjacent room were really fun to talk to as well. Overall I had a very awesome experience here and would stay a second time if I'm in the area again."
5241773,47533070,2015-09-20,42953700,Kim,"A great location, a clean room with towels for the bathroom, and two kindly and gracious hosts.  Kevin greeted my husband and I warmly, then helped us figure out some museums and restaurants we might be interested in visiting.  He was also able to show us to some off-street parking, which was a huge benefit.  I greatly enjoyed visiting with the two cats, but if you are not a cat person, it is easy enough to avoid them by simply closing the bedroom door.  The living area included a wide variety of local magazines to help you plan your visit.  Many thanks to this lovely couple for a welcoming stay!"
5241773,47622857,2015-09-21,28506494,Pamela,"Our hosts. Kevin and Louis were gracious and made us feel right at home. The house is in a lovely residential setting and the room was tidy and neat. It was obvious we had access to common areas as well. Our hosts provided a map with suggestions of things to see. The walk from the house to downtown was all downhill and took us 30 MINUTES, sightseeing all the way. I bet ride back to the house was inexpensive. Our host were descrite, but available when we needed them. All in all, everything meet our expectations."
5241773,48015638,2015-09-22,43042006,Eric,They are wonderful and friendly hosts. Their hospitality is amazing as well as the room they provided. Would definitely stay here again

The home is quaint and in a nice neighborhood with lots of places to eat and things to do. The bed was comfortable and the hosts supplied us with coffee in the morning. I would definitely stay in Louis and Kevin's home in the future.
5241773,48223017,2015-09-24,43904650,Jennifer,"I had a wonderful experience staying with Louis and Kevin in their beautiful home. They were very welcoming and provided places to eat at and visit.

5241773,48496206,2015-09-27,30690507,Jurjen & Nienke,"Our stay with Kevin and Louis was everything we hoped for! As our first time AirBnb stay ever, we where amazed by the warm welcome of Kevin. He told us about Seattle and all the sights we could see. Drinking a beer with Kevin and Louis near the fireplace, although it was warm outside, is a real testament to the warm people that they are. They also gave us a lot of tips on our yet to be started road trip down south. We really recommend staying at Kevin and Louis!"
5241773,49974778,2015-10-08,9437908,Janice,I loved my week with Kevin and Louis!  Their lovely home is in a quiet street but close to the bus and cafes etc.  They made me welcome and answered my questions regarding sightseeing.  They made my stay in seattle even more enjoyable.  Thanks guys.

5241773,51426046,2015-10-20,28835145,Jill,"It was a little bit like coming home, or visiting (new) old friends. These guys are terrific hosts, the house is impeccably clean and the bed is the most comfortable I've ever enjoyed away from home. 

Already looking for my next excuse to go back to Seattle!"
5241773,52269857,2015-10-27,13192995,Ken,"Very warm and welcoming home, with the friendliest kitties in town. Kevin was very clear and concise about the room, the keys, and the amenities. He recommended neighborhood eateries (I enjoyed Cafe Presse and Manmoosh) and had a very handy map I used to navigate my various meetings."
5241773,52609506,2015-10-31,42145692,Jamie,"These guys make traveling to check out a new city easy! I arrived around midnight and they had an easy plan for me to get in with their instructions sent prior. When I talked to them in the morning, they even provided me with their suggestions on nearby restaurant's and places to check out. Great location to check out capital hill and was easy to walk everywhere. I appreciate them allowing me to stay at their house!"
5241773,53072841,2015-11-04,13492190,Alexander,"Louis and Kevin were gracious hosts and their house is really comfortable and quaint. I appreciate the time they took to make sure everything was comfortable and how they gave me a lay of the land when I first arrived. 

My visit was pretty brief so I didn't speak with Louis and Kevin too much, but they were very pleasant and their cats are adorable. I would recommend staying with them for anyone visiting the area.

Great location, very comfortable, and rather laid back. Thanks gentlemen! "
5241773,53225454,2015-11-06,287015,Margriet,"Great people, great location, great times! Louis and Kevin are very welcoming, everything is in walking distance and they have great tips. Recommended!"
5241773,54247933,2015-11-17,37509049,Adam,"I cannot say enough about Kevin and Louis. They were extremely helpful when I arrived and gave me a full breakdown of the neighborhood and city after learning I was looking to move to Seattle. Kevin and Louis make you feel as if they've known you for years. From offering a glass of wine by the fire or just chatting with their friends, you will not find more hospitable and kind hosts. On top of that, the house was cleaned everyday. They also have two of the most friendly cats you'll ever meet. (Give the gray one, Sam, a little attention and he's your best friend until you leave.) I could not ask for better hosts, and would try to stay with Kevin and Louis every time I visit Seattle."
5241773,54350427,2015-11-18,22175725,Ulla,"This has been my very first Airbnb stay and Louis and Kevin have set the bar extremely high because they have been such wonderful hosts. They could not have been more helpful and kind.  I was in town to look for more permanent housing and their advice was invaluable. Also, I had been out in the cold rain all day and thus it felt so good to sit down in their comfy sofa by the fire place with a glass of wine, chatting with them about our lives. The house is lovely - full of old world charm. My room and bath room were very clean, and the coffee in the morning was freshly brewed and perfect. When I left, I was ready to face the rain again with a much better plan for the rest of my day, and in a way better mood. Thanks again!"
5241773,54863370,2015-11-25,26332490,Zaid,"Louis and Kevin are such wonderful hosts, they opened their home to us with absolutely amazing warmth and welcoming.

They always found time to say hi and sit down and chat by the fireplace, and show us around their lovely garden. They were always helpful and open to give suggestions about places to see in Seattle.

The room is warm, comfortable and clean. Although the bedroom doesnt have a private bathroom, that wasn't an issue as the bathroom was always kept well equipped and clean. The house is perfectly located, everything is a walking distance away, with access to public transportation.

As we were ready to depart and leave on our way, Louis and Kevin gave us such warm goodbye, it truely felt as we were leaving two friends behind. Anytime I am in Seattle in the future, I plan to see the opportunity to stay at their place."

they live in a beautiful house with a spacious clean room and toilet. the area was just magnificent in downtown Seattle.

5241773,55907442,2015-12-07,46025290,Molly,"Louis and Kevin were so welcoming. They made some great suggestions for things to do in Seattle, including bars, restaurants, and must-see museums, buildings, and places (one local pro tip: do the Sky View Observatory instead of the Space Needle). The neighborhood was fantastic -- our first night, we bopped around from bar to bar, all in walking distance, and had a lot of fun. Their house is beautiful and charming, and the bathroom and our bedroom were comfy and clean (we also thoroughly enjoyed the company of their two friendly cats, who are willing to snuggle with strangers). It was lovely to sit by the fire and have a glass of wine with Louis, and I really enjoyed chatting and getting to know the hosts. I would absolutely stay with them again and recommend them highly!"
5241773,56325952,2015-12-12,49746036,Lucas,Louis and Kevin were very kind and took time out of their day to make a map for us to go out. They had a fire going at all times in the living room and made sure we were comfortable at all times. They even set out an impressive coffee station where even my best friend that doesn't like coffee had the option to get hot chocolate. 
5241773,56842701,2015-12-19,44954441,Hailey,"Kevin and Louis are awesome! They were very gracious welcoming us into their house, and made us feel right at home. They have everything you could possibly need under their sink for toiletries which was nice, especially if you forgot anything! They kept the house at a comfortable temperature. It's nice that the front door locks on the way out and that we had the option to lock the door to our room as well. Their house is in a PRIME LOCATION if you don't want to be right by downtown. They have tons of shops and food places around them. There were also tons of bars around if you want to grab a nightcap! Getting anywhere from there house was easy because we could just walk to pine and catch a bus. Only $2.50 for a fare that transfers for up to two hours!! And if public transportation isn't the most fun for you, downtown, pioneer square, and the needle are all 100% in walking distance, and the walk is nice, with lots of cool stores and things to look at along the way. Also getting to their house from the airport is a breeze if you take the light rail. Also their cats are adorable. Our stay with them as first time airbnb users has been amazing! They really set the bar high for our future trips."
5241773,57038086,2015-12-21,39218163,Sanne,"We loved staying with Louis and Kevin. The room was nice and clean, the house was cozy, and their cats are so cute :) They gave us advice about where to go for dinner, sightseeing etc. Would love to go back :)"

The location is very good, with a lot of cool places nearby as well as good restaurants in the quiet neighborhood. It's also very close to most of the major attractions, we walked to most places without taking the bus, but if you want to, the bus station is also near. We enjoyed our time with Kevin and Louis who are very accommodating, gentle and helpful. They gave us good advice about where to visit and eat and we really enjoyed the short conversations with them everyday. The two cats are super cute and friendly, playing with them is a great fun. I would definitely recommend this place."
5241773,58475679,2016-01-02,52812740,Arin,"I couldn't have asked for a better first experience with airbnb. 

Kevin and Louis are easy going, down to earth people who have their system so simplified it goes beyond refined. 

The house itself is cozy with everything you need: comfy bed, clean sheets, bathroom dedicated to guests, coffee outside our door. The cats are a bonus, and bonus bonus, they love attention. 

The location can't be beat; everything you can ask for is just blocks away. 

Our last minute request was responded to very quickly and communication was a snap. 

These guys are pros!! Thanks! "

The bus line 7 stops only a few meters next to the house and brings you straight to downtown. 
Amanda gave us a lot of tips for Seattle. 
Thanks for the beer... ;) "

7902068,46078505,2015-09-07,2058335,Praveena,My room was beautiful and comfortable. Amanda was a great host and made me feel very welcome.  Being able to interact with host and guests made my stay better than any hotel could.  Would recommend this!
7902068,46839924,2015-09-13,42911171,Helen,Very nice place. I will return next time. 
7902068,47865207,2015-09-21,43010721,Pramod,Good stay here. Recommended.
7902068,47945112,2015-09-21,14589649,Ties,"I had a fantastic time!! Thank you so much!! I felt very welcome!! Amanda was very helpful!! What a sweetheart!! This place was exactly what i needed to end my long travels!! It was very relaxed, breakfast was great and atmosphere was fantastic!! I would love to come back some day!!"
7902068,48975008,2015-09-29,23382460,Koji,Very comfortable and safe stay.
7902068,49745732,2015-10-05,19370200,Luke,"Amanda, who works in the house was very helpful and welcoming. She made sure we had everything we needed during our stay and myself and a mate spent with the evening with her having a fire outside which was cool! The room was nice, the bed was great and it's so useful having a kitchen to cook, which was also stocked with breakfast items which was a great help!"
7902068,50042958,2015-10-08,18491374,Thomas,"Clean place, decent location, comfortable bed and good kitchen."
7902068,50715998,2015-10-13,30116739,Marc,"Dario's roommate, Amanda, was very friendly and helpful! The house has many rooms and guests, but everyone did their part to keep the common areas clean. I enjoyed my time there so much that I extended my stay twice.  "
7902068,50898311,2015-10-15,46225705,Lisa,"Amanda was a helpful host. The room was cosy and clean, and the bed was really comfy. This home is in a quiet neighbourhood about a 20 minute drive from downtown. Note there are 4 rooms available for rent, and only one bathroom, but it all worked out fine, even when it was a full house. I would stay here again. Note address: it's a bit hard to read the last digit as a 7, looks more like a 1."
7902068,51491799,2015-10-20,44534669,Crystal,"The house is good and the location is good too, however we never get a chance to meet Dario which is quite a pity because we were both very busy."
7902068,52186742,2015-10-26,21503962,John,The listing was accurate. My host was great and the neighborhood was great.
3031415,14197656,2014-06-14,10174319,Lawrence,"Blair was very easy to communicate with and checked in a few times leading up to the stay and during. The house is in a great location just 10-15 minutes drive from downtown without traffic. Downtown Ballard and Fremont are very close. We had a rental car and everything was convenient. Parking was very simple

The house looked like it had just been renovated and everything was pristine and clean. There were a few things that would have really helped to have such as cooking oil, a wine bottle opener (to open the bottle of seattle wine from the host!), and some cooking spices to complement the great new kitchen. Towels, linens, and toiletries were supplied and very nice. 

Slate coffee house was just down the road 2 blocks and easy to walk to. We did some morning runs to Green Lake park, rigorous hills but very convenient. All in all our group of 6 very much enjoyed the stay and would definitely recommend the place!"
3031415,15824084,2014-07-16,16067794,Stephanie,"Communication between Blair and us was prompt and friendly. This helps ease tensions when traveling to an unknown land filled with strangers and unfamiliar traffic patterns. We’re from the country, so streets jam-packed with automobiles can be tricky to maneuver for us. 

The spacious home is nestled in a quiet neighborhood with ample parking. We enjoyed sitting under the crabapple tree in the evenings on the back porch, listening to the rustling leaves and the occasional jogger huffing by (usually with dog in tow). Our two youngest children enjoyed quietly looking for bugs underneath rocks and plants located behind the house.

A big bonus for us – this house was outfitted with a lot of pillow choices for each bed. Some rentals skimp when it comes to comfy; were relieved to see this one didn't cut any corners when it came to cozy bedding.

We would recommend this tidy and spacious place to anyone traveling to Seattle. 
"
3031415,15971075,2014-07-19,2373805,Mark,"This house is in a nice safe neighborhood that is close to Ballard, Fremont, and Phinney Ridge. 

Check in was very quick and easy. 

The house is nicely finished and had all the little things you need to make a nice stay. 

The beds were very comfortable and we all slept well.

Nice washer/dryer."
3031415,16203735,2014-07-23,14374891,William,"Neighborhood was quiet and pleasant, the house more than met all our expectations and accommodated comfortably. Blair was very helpful and prompt to reply to our questions, would definitely stay here again."
3031415,16345905,2014-07-26,15271387,Wenny,"8 of us were visiting Seattle as a reunion trip and Blair's house in Ballard was just perfect for us! It was clean, comfy, and really adorably finished.
The location of the house is also just so convenient. Thank you for a wonderful stay in Seattle!"
3031415,16772681,2014-08-02,5237762,Emily,"We had a great stay at Blair's home. We had 7 in our group, and we all slept comfortably. The house was very close to our office in Fremont so we could all walk back and forth."
3031415,16978515,2014-08-05,9581668,Kirk,The house was great overall. However when we arrived there was stale coffee in the coffee maker that the cleaner had neglected which smelled bad and we had to clean. Since the check-in is so late - 3pm - I was surprised at such an obvious oversight. Aside from this one blip the place was great. We were there during the hottest days of summer so having more fans in the house - at least one for each bedroom is a must - Blair was very responsive in getting us a second fan when we requested one
3031415,17206560,2014-08-09,5003162,Chuck,"Blair's 3-bedroom place in Seattle worked very, very well for our family.  Everything was clean and set-up when we arrived and the accommodations were excellent.  The bed that my wife slept on was very comfortable.  We were hosting other out-of-town friends and family for a memorial program and the living room space was our home away from home.  

Blair provided us with instructions and directions (although we know Seattle very well in any event) and he was prompt and engaging when responding to questions. 

Brimmer & Heeltaps, just a couple of blocks down the street, was ideal for dinner once we finished driving and checked in one late, hot afternoon.  

The unit (part of a side by side duplex) is not the prettiest little home you will see in Seattle from the outside, but it is new, handsome and well appointed inside.  

Because we were gathered for a memorial, and had lots and lots of visiting to do, we had to be a little careful to remind ourselves of the ""quiet curfew"" outdoors.  Seattle is a densely packed residential city and the neighbors are never far away.  

If we needed a larger space in Seattle again, we would not hesitate to come back to this spot. "
3031415,17502210,2014-08-13,8615825,Jeremy,"The house was in great condition, all was as expected. We were really happy with the location as well, near Fremont and Ballard with great eating options really close by!"
3031415,17603527,2014-08-14,3086286,Ross,I booked Blair's place for my family who visited Seattle. My family said his place was clean and spacious. They enjoyed their stay a lot. Blair was very prompt and is a good host. 
3031415,17681282,2014-08-16,5659687,Jay,"A great, clean home right in the area we wanted to be in.  Easy access to downtown and even easier access to some really cool and interesting restaurants and bars in the Ballard neighborhood.  Our host provided everything we needed to make our stay great!"
3031415,18400007,2014-08-26,15445027,Sibylle & Trevor,"We had a wonderful time in Seattle. The house was spacious enough for 6 of us and everything was nicely updated. Blair was super friendly and prompt with all emails and requests. We had trouble with the coffee maker and when we called he immediately delivered a new one. The kitchen was well stocked and plenty of linens and towels where available. We appreciated being able to wash our clothes after our long hikes and sleeping in the comfortable beds. The only thing that didn't work well was the downstairs TV. It wasn't hooked up to any cable or dish but there were enough DVDs to keep us occupied. (Remotes didn't work either)   Overall I loved the neighborhood and the house and would love to come back to stay again. Thank you Blair for answering all my questions and being so accommodating. Sibylle & Trevor, Austin Tx"
3031415,18659664,2014-08-30,17891333,Brittany,"This place was absolutely perfect for our needs. We stayed here comfortably and we loved it. The place is beautiful, new, clean and convenient to everything. Communication with Blair was easy. Booking was easy. "
3031415,18875335,2014-09-02,16051143,Paula,"Amazing home! This will now be our ""go-to"" place in Seattle. Host was amazing, house was perfect! "
3031415,19387719,2014-09-11,20783522,Eddy,"Great place and quiet location. Loved the bed, very comfy, Blair uses high quality cotton sheets, made for a great nights sleep. Only a 10 to 15 minute walk to local restaurants, shops, etc. I would definitely stay there again. "
3031415,19592183,2014-09-15,16492946,Erica,This was my first experience with airbnb and it will not be my last.  We were in Seattle for our nephews wedding and we decided to make a long weekend of it.  The house was perfect!  I wouldn't have changed a thing.  Everything was so clean and the host had thought of everything.  The pillows and beds were comfy and warm.  We will be heading back to Seattle to spend a week in the future and this home will be our first pick!  For this family Hotels are a thing of the past.  We're sold on airbnb!!!
3031415,19717230,2014-09-16,10645423,HaiThu,Beautiful home!!! Everything is so clean and neat. Blair is so quick and efficient in responding to us. Thank u again!!!
3031415,19886130,2014-09-20,20323476,Anne,The house was great. We were all pleasantly surprised at how nice the house was for such a reasonable price. I would recommend this home to anyone. The host made us welcome and even accommodated our early arrival when we were in a huge time crunch. 
3031415,20004460,2014-09-22,8905742,Cindy,"The house is very comfortable for a family. It was clean and Blair is a very helpful host who responded to me immediately. The kitchen was well supplied and easy to work in. We also appreciated that the location was so close to all the sites within Seattle. Also, easy street parking is  a real plus in established Seattle neighborhoods. "
3031415,20197456,2014-09-25,20274464,Brenda,"The place was really nice, updated kitchen and baths. Very comfortable beds and linens. Perfect location for our visit.  Allowed us to have more space and was much better than staying in a hotel.  Easy to locate.  We were given complete, detailed instructions.  Very accommodating.
"
3031415,20950149,2014-10-08,1898879,Beth,"This home was just what we needed as family came from out of town for my daughter's wedding in Ballard.  It was close to ""the action""  and very comfortable.  It provided the opportunity to sit down together over home cooked spagetti.  Very nice."
3031415,21276853,2014-10-14,16308889,Helen,"Perfect!! The location was great, the place was amazing- spacious and clean. Would definitely recommend to everyone and would stay again. So homey and comfortable. "
3031415,21352507,2014-10-15,9081208,Malcom,Wonderful and spacious home in a very convenient location in the Ballard area. Blair was very accommodating to our needs and helped us out when we needed it. 
3031415,21443997,2014-10-17,10590558,Gina,"I visited Seattle for work with a few colleagues and our stay at Blair's house was nothing less than awesome. The house is extremely clean, warm and welcoming. Sitting around the fireplace after a long day of work was exactly what we needed and the beds were hands down the best part of the house. SO comfortable! Seattle coffee in the fridge for our early mornings was also a huge plus. I would definitely recommend staying at Blair's place - I know we'll be back soon!"
3031415,21578019,2014-10-20,18028321,Deanna,"This Seattle home, which is actually half of a duplex, is in a great location of Seattle. It was especially convenient for our quick, multi-generational family gathering for my sisters wedding downtown.the photos show the house accurately and there was plenty of off street parking. Blair was responsive and helpful. Only negative was the extremely loud party of guests on the other side of the duplex, who started partying after midnight, and kept it up till I called the police at 2:30. Don't know why guests on airbnb could ignore the stated house rules and just basic courtesy, but it ruined our last night there."
3031415,22289794,2014-11-03,5086394,Ivy,Blair was very helpful from the get go. His place is in a quiet neighborhood with plenty of street parking. Location is amazing with only 15min to DT Seattle and Trader Joes is only a 5min drive. The place is homey with comfortable beds for all 8 of us! Wish there were lids to pots and more kitchen utensils but overall a great weekend stay for a big group :)
3031415,22650631,2014-11-11,9008994,Neil,This home was perfect for us. We had 4 adults and 2 toddlers. The neighborhood is quiet. It's easy to get to Ballard and anywhere else in the city. There is a nice coffee shop within walking distance.
3031415,22828572,2014-11-16,20991059,Carol,This house was perfect for our needs.  Very comfortable in quiet safe neighborhood.  We would definitely stay here again.
3031415,23424047,2014-12-01,19531934,Dolly,Good. Courteous and hospitable host. Always available to answer questions.
3031415,23678372,2014-12-08,2514609,Chad,"This is a beautiful home with all the amenities and a great location on a quiet street. You know how you see pictures of a place and wonder if it will be as nice as it appears? Blair's home lives up to the promise.  There are two private bedrooms upstairs and downstairs makes a great family suite, if you have kids, with a double bed and comfy futon. Highly recommended."
3031415,24225818,2014-12-23,22773350,Curtis,"We enjoyed Blair's house very much. My wife, 3 year old and myself shared the house with both our parents, and the setup was good. The finished basement with a futon was perfect for a toddler, as was the lack of breakable items. Everything worked perfectly, and the house, which is part of a duplex in a nice, walkable neighborhood, was ideally located, near grocery stores, and a short jaunt (via the 15th street bridge) to the Seattle Center. We cooked most of our meals at home, and we would have preferred that the kitchen had been a bit better equipped (There were not potholders, for example and only one spatula, and some of the knives were broken),  but generally we had a very nice time.   "
3031415,25280539,2015-01-11,7599924,Kristen,"This is a beautiful home with lots of nice touches. I wish we could have stayed longer so I could try out that beautiful kitchen. Tons of room, super comfy beds, cozy living room with fireplace, nice views, and safe storage for our equipment. We loved it and would definitely stay again!"
3031415,25705981,2015-01-24,3958171,Sue,"We would return to this home in a heartbeat.   The location is so close to the fun of the Ballard area and easy to access other city locations, but on a very quiet street with easy parking.   The caretaker got back to us immediately with a question we had.  Thanks for a great stay. "
3031415,26492559,2015-02-14,10321809,Jiawei,I like your house so much. Thank you. It is a good place to live in. We also like environment around your home. Thank you again.  
3031415,26689432,2015-02-17,26173986,Janet,"This house was clean, stylish and fun for our Seattle getaway! 7 of us slept quite comfortably with room to spare. Blair was helpful in answering any questions leading up to the event."
3031415,26761540,2015-02-18,21533663,Xiaodong,It was a pleasant stay at Blair's property.
3031415,26884226,2015-02-21,22027485,Henry,Blair was really nice and patient. He helped me find the door key and his house was really good and clean.   highly recommended

3031415,27353481,2015-03-02,26674322,Christopher,Great place in a quiet neighborhood with all Ballard sites within walking distance. Host made getting in and out easy.
3031415,27436270,2015-03-04,4768248,Jill,"We came out to Seattle for a friend's wedding and stayed at Blair's after to explore the city more.  Blair's house was great!  It had everything we needed and enough space for all of us.  The house was at a great location.  There are grocery stores and restaurants within walking distance.  It's a bit farther away from downtown but we saw plenty of buses that could get you there.  We used Uber to get around so the split fares between us all were pretty good.  

Blair was really great about responding and very accommodating.  We had a rental car we needed to return and Blair let us stop by to drop off luggage before our official check in time.  

I would definitely recommend staying here!"
3031415,27644402,2015-03-09,20178364,Ty,"The house was very nice and matched the description of the listing well. The kitchen was sleek and modern, we liked that there were plenty of cooking pans, plates, and silverware since our group made meals at home multiple times. The bathrooms were very clean and even had toiletries like shampoo in case you forgot some of your own. There's free wifi and the living room even had a Chromecast set-up on the TV so you can stream netflix or hulu from your mobile devices. 

There is a Safeway, Whole Foods, and several other grocery stores within a 5 minute drive. Also many restaurants and coffee shops. 

Everyone said the beds were extremely comfortable, better than even what we have to sleep on at home. 

It seemed like a very quiet neighborhood, plenty of parking on the street. Overall very pleased with our stay!"
3031415,27778823,2015-03-11,27484147,Liu,"Blair's house is exactly as described, clean and comfortable in great location. There are three bedrooms. Two bedrooms share one bathroom on the 2nd floor and a big one with bathroom at downstair. They provide BBQ place and tools too, although we didn't use I can tell that you and your friends would enjoy your time."
3031415,27852245,2015-03-13,28534271,Jason,"Blair was a wonderful host!  We had great communication before we arrived. The apartment was clean and looked just like the  photos had indicated.  The location was perfect for my needs for the week!  I bussed and walked all over the city, as this place is so convenient. I definitely recommend staying here!"
3031415,27879577,2015-03-14,27172377,Kerry,The house was clean and very nice on the inside. The description was accurate. My friend who lives in the area was jealous she didn't live here!
3031415,28072274,2015-03-17,1930757,Shannon,Blair was fantastic. She was very accommodating with our schedule for checking in (as we were there for a wedding and had conflicting schedules with the check in time). The house was exactly as pictured and more than enough room for 6 people.  The neighborhood was adorable And quiet. We had an awesome time in Seattle and would definitely return back to Blaire's house!
3031415,28302815,2015-03-22,14137894,Lilly,"We had a lovely stay at Blair's place.  The beds were super-comfortable, and the sheets were very soft.  The neighborhood was great, with a great brewery down the road, and a park at the end of the street for the kids.  The area was also very quiet, and was located at the perfect distance from the crazy Seattle traffic.  Some minor hiccups with the amount of soap/laundry detergent/toilet paper left for 6 people, but Blair took care of it once it was brought to his attention.  Everything was exactly as described in the write-up, and we would definitely stay here again."
3031415,28518160,2015-03-25,1268013,Corey,"Blair's house was fantastic! There's plenty of room for an entire family and lots of beds and room for people to hang out in. The kitchen and appliances are also fantastic if you're in to that sort of thing. Great location, as well – halfway between Fremont and Ballard (Freelard), walking distance to Hale's Brewery (try the Cream Ale – amazing), and a quick cab or drive to either downtown Fremont or Ballard.

Would absolutely stay again."
3031415,28929229,2015-04-01,11192813,Do Yeon,"안녕하세요. 저는 한국에서 이 숙소에 8일간 머물렀던 (website hidden) 분들께도 도움되시라고 한글로 남겨요. 이 집은 주방, 욕실, 세탁실, 침구 모든 것이 정말 완벽하리만큼 좋은 곳이에요. 위치 또한 조용하고 유덥이나 다운타운과 모두 가깝답니다. 또한 침대가 너무 편안해서 여행 내내 잠을 정말 잘 (website hidden) 분들 머물 일 있다면 저는 강추에요~^^"
3031415,29721089,2015-04-12,8713088,Nate,Blair was attentive through the booking process and helpful answering questions leading up to the rental date.  
3031415,30129898,2015-04-18,27666700,Julie,"We had an excellent stay at this house!!! All appliances were updated and beautiful!  Neighborhood was great and had a playground near that we took our toddler to!

House was super clean and the beds were sooo comfortable!!!

Blair was very fast with replies!"

3031415,30601904,2015-04-25,6350250,Hamish,"We had an excellent experience with all of our expectations met.  Blair has paid attention to all the details so we had no trouble getting the key and found the house was clean and bedding, towels, dishes, cutlery etc were all in order.   We liked the neighborhood and on street parking was no problem.  We would definitely stay here again."
3031415,31009512,2015-04-30,26024751,Katie,Blair's place is clean and organized just almost like the photo that she shows. The neighborhood is quiet as well. 
3031415,31738246,2015-05-09,4912211,Alex,"Very clean, and in a nice part of town. I would definitely stay there again!"
3031415,31875108,2015-05-11,1829277,Joanna,Check-in and out was super easy with the lockbox system. Place was clean and spacious enough for us (group of 8). Would definitely stay here again!
3031415,32258092,2015-05-16,13389228,Jeremy,"Absolutely perfect. I stayed here with a couple colleagues while on a work trip in Ballard. The house is large, well stocked, and clean. One of the hesitations with scheduling an AirBnb for work trips is that it can really feel odd to stay on someone's house. Sleeping in someone's paisley sheets, pictures of their kids on the wall, personal affects everywhere, etc. While I don't mind it, I know it can bother other people. I was SO glad to find this listing because it is definitely a full-time rental. The beds are super comfy with simple white sheets and towels. The upstairs bathroom is very large. The kitchen is clean and the styling is spacious and elegant. Getting access to the home and hopping on the wifi was straightforward. Blair communicated well and responded fast to the initial booking. Thanks for the great stay!"
3031415,32462878,2015-05-18,3360919,Lisa,"Blair made us feel welcome and provided great, detailed instructions for us to follow. The house was a perfect set up for us, rooms well appointed, very comfortable, and location of the house was close in proximity to meet all our needs. The house was not ready by check-in time, but I contacted Blair and he made sure this was addressed as soon as possible. As a result, we ended up meeting ""D"", his cleaning person, who was very apologetic, personable, and did a great job of getting the place ready for us. We will definitely keep this house information handy for our next trip!  "
3031415,33221078,2015-05-26,12540238,Colby,"Blair's home was clean, spacious and in a great location. We (5 adults) all slept comfortably and would definitely reserve the home again. The best part is the location! The neighborhood is charming and it doesn't hurt to be able to walk to 10 different microbreweries!"
3031415,33773514,2015-06-01,27701318,Kathy,"Blair touched base with us before we checked in, which we appreciated. The description on the site was accurate, and the house was clean. It was perfect for our group--spacious and walking distance to many local attractions. "
3031415,34093749,2015-06-04,34159837,Gwen,"It was really clean, new and absolutely comfy staying in Blair's place. It took us 10 to 15 minutes to Seattle downtown and the neighborhood was quiet and beautiful. The Safeway Market was just few blocks away, super convenient! The description on web was accurate. Blair's place was my first airbnb, and it was perfectly match my expatiation. Highly recommend Blair's place!"

3031415,34423562,2015-06-08,3811127,Amy,House was very spacious and clean.   Little patio area outside was awesome.   Neighborhood quiet but still very close to Ballard attractions.   Check in and out a breeze.   Blair was great.   
3031415,34775553,2015-06-12,27920512,Shannon,"This was my first experience of staying exclusively at an Airbnb in a new city, and I'm glad we did! Blair's Ballard house was incredible! So centrally located, clean and modern, with lots of amenities, great soft beds, huge kitchen, and lovely back yard to chill in. We loved the whole experience!"
3031415,35486428,2015-06-19,18359642,Brooke,Very nice house in quiet neighborhood. Perfect for college visits. They were very helpful.

3031415,37852417,2015-07-11,20046985,Mark,"This house was the perfect one-night stop for us in Ballard. It's nicely tucked away in a quiet neighborhood, yet just minutes from Ballard's town center. The condo is a bit nondescript on the outside, but modern, clean and very comfortable on the inside. Blair is an excellent host, communicative and helpful. Highly recommended. "
3031415,38113492,2015-07-13,31237189,Karin,"What a great space for a large group! We felt at home, but still had privacy. "
3031415,38600884,2015-07-17,33074303,Leslie,"The pictures depict the listing exactly!  It was perfect for the 5 of us - and having access to a washing machine was a godsend (my 3 year old tends to have wardrobe malfunctions several times a day).  The neighborhood is very quiet. It's fairly close to simple amenities (grocery, eateries) - and driving in the area was easy.  On street parking wasn't a hassle - there was plenty!"
3031415,38977722,2015-07-20,26307702,Laura,"Blair was courteous, helpful and quick to respond to questions.  The home was beautifully clean and well stocked.  My entire family enjoyed our stay."

3031415,39898212,2015-07-27,21804024,Abby,"My group and myself had a wonderful stay at this AirBnB rental. The posting was accurate, the home was very clean, comfortable beds, and quiet/friendly neighborhood. 
The owner was prompt with communication and once we booked the property all the details were messaged over. It was so seamless and convenient. They even left a book of how to prep the place before departure, things to do in Seattle, which felt very organized and welcoming.  I would absolutely recommend this rental to people visiting Seattle. Thanks for a great trip!"
3031415,41189812,2015-08-05,28383337,Joanna,A beautiful apartment which was really well appointed and comfortably housed 6 adults. Sadly we were only there for one night so didn't get to enjoy much time in the accommodation. I would certainly go back there. Location was easily walkable to Fremont and it was only a short (approx 10 USD) cab to get to locations such as the Space Needle. Thanks very much to our host!!
3031415,41462894,2015-08-07,20240745,Pete,The host did a great job of communicating with us and has done an awesome job of remodeling this home. The amenities were top notch. Short drive or medium walk to LOTS of great food places in Ballard. REALLY enjoyed our stay here. Would do it again in the future.
3031415,42319236,2015-08-12,26923819,Michelle,This place was exactly like the pictures. My family and I had a great time here. Very close to the woodland park and zoo. The apple tree in the back yard smelled great :) Everything was very clean and the kitchen is very spacious. We will definitely recommend this place for families.
3031415,42544531,2015-08-14,10374318,Ashley,"This place was perfect for our group in Seattle! We had three couples, and everyone had plenty of space and privacy. It was a very comfortable spot to come ""home"" to at the end of that day's exploration of Seattle. The beds were comfortable, the showers were hot, the place was super clean, and Blair was kind and responsive. I would definitely recommend this spot to other travelers!"
3031415,43425036,2015-08-19,40418048,Samantha,Great location and price for our visit to Seattle. It was easy to access and all we needed for our stay. Blair was quick to respond to my questions before our stay. Plenty of room for our party of 6   
3031415,44558541,2015-08-27,5282805,Nikki,"This listing description is very accurate!  Blair made this a totally effortless and comfy place for us to stay.   We just showed up got the key out of the lockbox and made ourselves at home.  Everything was laid out and self explanatory.  It was nice to have privacy too.  The neighborhood was quiet and seemed safe, lots of parking on the street.  I really enjoyed the back patio, it was a great place to sit in the fading summer sun.  The beds were like clouds, they were so comfortable, and the gas fireplace was really luxurious."
3031415,45288097,2015-09-01,5941880,Mason,"Blair's place is beautiful, immaculately clean, and in a fun neighborhood. Perfect place for our visit.

For food, I recommend checking out the Walrus and the Carpenter, which was only about a 20 minute walk. 

Thanks Blair!"
3031415,45417881,2015-09-02,35745517,Jamie,"Very quiet neighbourhood. very spacious units, good from family"
3031415,45595424,2015-09-04,9621523,Joey,Flawless AirBNB experience in a nice neighborhood.   The place was clean and the beds were very comfy.  Blair was always quick to respond to any questions and getting the keys was so easy with the lockbox.  Highly recommend!
3031415,46294353,2015-09-09,40300306,Fifi,It's super awesome!!!! My friends and I really really love the house!!!!!!
3031415,47610820,2015-09-21,6032475,Ariel,The house was very clean and spacious. Absolutely perfect for what I needed! Blair was courteous and accommodating. 
3031415,47980490,2015-09-22,29571120,Julie,"Well . . . I know Blair has lots of wonderful reviews. I Wish that we felt the same way as others, but that was not our experience. The neighborhood was ok; close to downtown Fremont area and plenty of street parking. There where three piled high trash cans right in front of front porch steps (so first thing you see and pass to get in to house). Second thing, was lots of weeds in the very small front yard area with empty flower pots. Has potential to be cute . . . but was not. 
Overall, the place was fine; ""spacious"" kind of but not really (upper bedrooms are on the small side and only 4 can sit at the informal dinning table), clean . . . not really. There were several hairs in the upper bathroom and the rug on the floor was disgusting. We actually washed it ourselves as it was incredibly dirty as were the throw rugs in the upstairs bedrooms. The stairway going down to the family room/bedroom downstairs also looked as though it had not been vacuumed for awhile. 
Worst of all, there was less than a quarter roll of toilet paper in one bathroom and ZERO in the other bathroom! Needless to say, our first stop was the local grocery store to buy our own TP while the rugs were in the washer (that didn't work properly).

Luckily our Japanese guests that we were planning to entertain here came a day later than our own arrival  . . . so we were not embarrassed by the event of no TP and dirty rugs & hairs all around.
Finally, settling in, we thought we'd watch some college football . . . only to get TERRIBLE reception. Satellite rabbit ears is what you get. 

When I texted Blair about both issues, he apologized and said he'd have TP delivered (the next day) and re: the reception . . . ""The tv is connected to the antenna. You can move it to get better reception."" My D1 ex-football player son tried for more than 30 minutes to ""get better reception"" so he could watch his friends . . . then gave up in frustration.  Our family has no desire to go back to this property.
ON a positive note; the beds were very comfortable and the bedding was high quality. Self entry was very easy. Kitchen was ""basically"" stocks. No extras."
3031415,48399125,2015-09-26,40538758,James,We found the property to be as advertised:  very nice and comfortable.  We recommend it to others.  However the basement suite was a bit musty.
3031415,48680696,2015-09-28,26387395,Betty,"The location couldn't have been more perfect!  We attended a wedding at The Ballard Hotel and were within walking distance.  The home was clean, comfortable and well appointed for our party of 8."
3031415,49100734,2015-10-01,23778444,Philllipa,"
A comfortable, well-equipped home in a nice, quiet residential neighborhood. "
3031415,49239464,2015-10-02,43025976,Thomas,"The place was perfect - extremely welcoming, clean, spacious, just absolutely perfect for what we needed. The beds were super comfortable, there was a washer + dryer for laundry, the basement was a great escape and the location was just a short walk from all of the bars & restaurants that Ballard has to offer. There was literally zero downside to this spot - it was perfect! Thank you so much Blair."
3031415,49757937,2015-10-06,27808162,Meredith,"A great, private duplex with all the amenities as described. The neighborhood is quiet and well kept--and close to downtown Ballard with cute stores and fabulous restaurants. Beds are very plush, basement was perfect for sleeping babies, parking right out front, and several grocery stores nearby. We'd absolutely stay here the next time we are in Seattle."
3031415,49930005,2015-10-07,10538596,Eric,"This place is amazing, even better than expected. Blair was easy to work with and very responsive. "
3031415,50612088,2015-10-13,30228873,Julia,Perfect rental for our week in Seattle for my sister's wedding. Our family felt right at home and everything about the house was as advertised. Great experience overall!
3031415,51423125,2015-10-20,12744237,Bruce,"Everything was wonderful.  Blair did an excellent job of keeping us informed and answering any questions we had.  The home was ultra-clean.  We all enjoyed the place immensely--three generations of us.  Easy access to downtown, yet the neighborhood is also close to Green Lake and there are a lot of  good restaurants and coffee shops nearby."
3031415,51922270,2015-10-25,35692401,Jen,"Very nice semi-detached house. The location is very good, just  10 mins to the Pike place market by car. We spent 3 nights there. Comfortable and convenient."
3031415,52309829,2015-10-28,11096175,Gabrielle,"The duplex was in a good neighborhood, close to my sister and her husband. My family and I had a comfortable time, although we did wish it was cleaner  (did not seem like the place is thoroughly vacuumed), had additional towels (there were only two towels upstairs and three downstairs which was the bare minimum for the 5 people we were), and that it had cable or better reception.  All in all, it was perfectly located for us, and the pictures reflected the space well."
3031415,52680678,2015-11-01,32495643,Ann,"Blair was a very helpful and responsive host.  The home is very inviting and cozy.  Bedding is amazing.  The location is perfect, a quite residential area.  Five stars for sure."
3031415,53111002,2015-11-05,6676752,Alythea,"The house was absolutely perfect! Very spacious, extremely comfortable beds, a cozy fireplace, plenty of street parking, close to everything - Green Lake, downtown, Ballard, the Zoo, restaurants, etc., and there is a lovely little coffee shop just 2 blocks down from the house - just perfect! I would definitely stay here again and would certainly recommend it to anyone traveling to Seattle! "
3031415,53954319,2015-11-15,134815,Tina,"Blair's place was perfect for us.  It was spacious and comfortable. We were able to make ourselves at home, cook meals, and work together well. It was stocked with all the basics we needed.  Getting around town to various restaurants worked well too. "
3031415,54321042,2015-11-18,34702404,Katie,"The host left very easy instructions about the details for the stay in the itinerary, so that was very helpful.  The place actually seemed a bit bigger than in the pictures.  Everything was clean and worked well.  It was a very convenient location since we were flying out of Sea Tac in the morning and went to dinner in the downtown area of Ballard which was only a mile away. "
3031415,54557847,2015-11-21,49039951,Stacey,My experience in dealing with Blair was very positive. He is easy to communicate with and responds promptly. His place was exactly as described and clean and very well maintained. I would definitely recommend dealing with him. 
3031415,54611109,2015-11-22,1834117,Stephen,"Great space and location. Easy walk to heart of Ballard. Perfect for the six of us, wish we could've stayed a while. "
3031415,54971558,2015-11-27,16852031,Matthew,"It was great for our needs as we had a party of 8 people. My family of four could stay downstairs which had ample space and my sister and her husband could stay in one upstairs bedroom with our parents in another. Place was clean overall but the sofa in the living room was showing some age. Good kitchen full of all cooking utensils. We did some cooking and also visited a number of nearby restaurants, bars and coffee houses. Ballard is great neighborhood, residential with cool local joints. Recommend brimmer & healtap for higher end dining, veraci for casual pizza, slate for coffee, and Reuben's and Stoup for craft beer. The Sunday farmers market is great as well. All in all very good place and excellent value for our group!"
3031415,55354711,2015-12-01,18881921,Stefanie,"We had the best time at Blairs place ! My family of 7 had ample space & felt very comfortable and safe in the neighborhood. It's conveniently located and 10 minutes from downtown & the stadium. We'd stay with Blair again for sure, hoping to make it an annual trip ! Aloha ! "
3031415,56470395,2015-12-14,36338881,Abby,"Blair was an amazing host for one of the best family trips I've ever had. The space was exactly as advertised. We all fit comfortably and it was so nice to come home at the end of a busy day sight seeing to home away from home. Blair was wonderful to communicate with and I would recommend this property to anyone traveling to Seattle. It is extremely close to downtown, Freemont and has great access to the major highways. "
3031415,57197111,2015-12-23,5580771,Alison (& Shawn),"We had a great experience at this property! The home was clean, well equipped, and exactly matched the description/photos provided.

I would highly recommend staying here!"
3031415,57379687,2015-12-25,21416789,Ana,"We have some trouble over the checkin and opening the door, but that's totally our issue. Blair is helpful all the way and the house is great if you are travelling with your family. "
3031415,57495908,2015-12-26,47946685,Lindsey,Blair was incredibly accommodating.  My family was stranded in Seattle due to weather and he responded within 15 minutes of my initial request and was able to coordinate with a housecleaner within 30.  The accommodations were exactly as described in the description and there was ample street parking available.  I would definitely recommend this listing to someone coming to town in the future.
8583457,50232449,2015-10-10,32631462,Johanna,"We had a lovely stay at this beautiful house. The back yard and deck are enormous, and the house actually had peek-a-boo sound views. We enjoyed some beautiful sunsets. Candace was great and very accommodating. We checked in and found fresh fruit and a nice bottle of wine, as well as coffee and tea. And when we had trouble figuring out the heater, she and her husband came right over to help. We would definitely recommend this location. "

8583457,55123179,2015-11-28,38400432,Susan,"This was an absolutely wonderful place to stay in West Seattle, while visiting family over the Thanksgiving holiday.  This home is right on Beach Drive, a great location for beachfront walks.  Very safe-feeling residential location. I stayed here with my college-age daughter, and we felt immediately at home as we walked in the door.  Le Petite Retreat is cozy, inviting, and spotless.   It has a lot of character, especially the way the Candace has maintained its architectural history while updating with a more modern design touch, especially in the living room and bedrooms.  My master bedroom was luxurious and spacious - Ioved the linens and duvet.  The second bedroom was also good-sized and very cozy for another guest, as two walls were nearly covered with built-in shelves containing books and board games.  The bath had one of the smallest showers I've been in but super cute, fun and well-supplied with amenities if you need them. My daughter loved it.  Really, this is a nice retreat home.  

The kitchen was extensively equipped with dishware and pans - we even cooked Thanksgiving dinner here for four.  Next time, actually, I hope to take more advantage of the multiple restaurants within walking distance.   Candace is very kind.  She left all kinds of wonderful treats for our arrival (which my two daughters practically devoured); the lights and heat were on when we arrived well after dinnertime.  She provided detailed and very clear  instructions and suggestions that we made good use of, and she was close and readily available for  assistance.   I will definitely try come back here anytime I come back to Seattle for future visits.  "
8583457,57046729,2015-12-21,49628239,Sandra,"Our stay was wonderful!  We felt so comfortable!! Definitely a home away from home!  Very close to so many interesting places!

8583457,58444974,2016-01-02,8762299,Mahadi,"Candace house's so so beautiful. The location was perfect, close to Alki Beach and was 15 minutes away to downtown Seattle.  Candace was so nice and always going an extra mile to accomodate our stay. 

I strongly recommend her house for those who want to enjoy staying in Seattle.  I will definitely stay at Candace wonderful house next time i go down to Seattle with my family."

This is a bottom story suite - private bedroom, bathroom, and walk-in closet, separate from the rest of the house. The neighborhood is quiet and residential, about 15 minutes from the airport and 10 minutes from downtown Seattle. Jana was friendly and willing to help with restaurant tips, directions, etc. 

Definitely recommended!"

They really got into details to make the room perfect, extremely clean, and it's nice to have a private bathroom, we were very autonomous. The neighborhood is very calm and pretty, and the location of their place is very convenient : thanks to the Lightrail train, you can get to downtown Seattle or to Seatac airport in 15-20 min. Jana and Nick are very nice hosts, they gave us a list of things to do in Beacon Hill (good advice for breakfast!). A great place to stay!"

Jana even let us borrow her iron and send us a great place to rent a bike.  We would highly recommend Jana's home to anyone who wants to stay in the Seattle area -- from the Beacon Hill light rail station, it's extremely easy to get to from the airport and to downtown (it's about 4 blocks from the station or a 5 minute walk).  Thanks Jana - we hope to visit again sometime!"

143580,435465,2011-08-10,906911,Christy,"Amazing room, very clean and comfortable. Great accommodations and very nice host. I would love to come back and stay here and recommend it to anyone. "
143580,441299,2011-08-13,817537,Nicole,"My boyfriend and I enjoyed our stay very much. It was super private and we loved having our own bathroom. Our host was also very friendly.  Their house was also really close to the new light rail system, which was really nice to ride."
143580,449567,2011-08-16,161691,Adam & Sherri,AWESOME! We stayed at their place for 3 days and we could not have loved it more! Great location and great room. The room was very private and comfortable and we will certainly try and stay with them again on our next trip to Seattle! Thanks for such a great stay!
143580,458464,2011-08-19,929171,Rich,"This room left me wanting for nothing. It was immaculate, well laid out and extremely comfortable. I never heard any excessive noise from other parts of the house. The information provided prior to, and during, my stay was very useful. 

The location was perfect.. I really enjoyed running through the neighborhood and surrounding areas, and the easy access to the Beacon Hill light rail station (~10 minute walk) was a huge bonus. 

Thank you for the privacy, comfort, and enjoyable stay. "
143580,469142,2011-08-23,794323,Nola,"awesome room,super private and close to bus service,"
143580,487098,2011-08-30,781089,Ray,"Great room in a great location. About four blocks or so from the light rail station. Less than 30 minutes to downtown and the pier area and a straight shot of about 30 minutes to and from the airport. In a wonderful neighborhood with great food and coffee. 

The room itself is clean and self contained. It has a nice walk in closet and everything you need. This is a great deal if you are going to be downtown for business or a conference. Highly recommended. "
143580,492473,2011-09-01,803384,Jennifer,Awesome place! Very clean and convenient to downtown. Suggestions left by Jana of what to do around town were great.  Would love to stay there again.
143580,505701,2011-09-06,809912,Huseyin,Jana and Nick were great hosts to me and my fiance. The room had full privacy with a private bathroom and no single noise from outside or the rest of the house. They were also quite fast in replying our questions via email or texts before and during our stay. The other great thing is the bus stop in a one block distance. You can easily go to downtown or Chinatown this way. 
143580,514551,2011-09-08,1099367,Robin,It was great. Jana had anticipated everything in advance and we were very satisfied with this experience!
143580,557755,2011-09-22,1141850,Ya-Wen,"This is a wonderful place to stay. The room was neat and cozy. Nice hosts. They provided thoughtful information of interesting places to go. As I had requests, their response was warm and quick. It took less than 15 minutes to downtown and many places. Next time when I come back to Seattle, I will stay at this place again. Highly recommended!"
143580,578685,2011-09-28,562823,Altay,"An excellent room, very comfortable and private. There was no noise coming form the other part of the house. The hosts were very friendly willing to help you with anything you need. Stayed there for 5 nights and don't regret it!"
143580,597984,2011-10-04,999879,Patricia,"Nice, cozy room with lovely ensuite bathroom and walk-in closet.  The host, Jana, is very nice and helpful.  It's easy to go back and forth to downtown as Beacon Hill has frequent bus service.  You can even walk to it in about 35 minutes!  We really enjoyed our stay in Seattle!"
143580,608386,2011-10-08,676727,Lucy,"Room was not what we expected.  Downstairs.  No view.  Carpet was not clean.  Trash can in bathroom was full/needed emptying.  Was heated well.  Outside light shined in window all night long,,,hard to sleep."
143580,624467,2011-10-12,699617,Brian,Very nice room! Very private like a hotel room. Clean. Nice location.Just perfect Thanks!
143580,628578,2011-10-14,336288,Marissa,"Jana was extremely prompt in answering any questions via text and email beforehand. My boyfriend and I stayed here and enjoyed lots of privacy--great room, private bathroom, and close to my work. Unfortunately, we didn't get a chance to meet Jana and her husband, but really enjoyed our stay anyhow. The only small downfall is lack of kitchen access, but Jana clarified this beforehand and was very willing to issue a refund (in advance) for the changed number of days. "
143580,634778,2011-10-16,1277989,Brandi,"Easy to find and close to the train to get wherever you want to go without driving.

 Jana arrived home at the same time as we did so she let us in and showed us the ropes.  The suite was super nice, clean and the ensuite bathroom was handy.  Although we didn't spend a lot of time there, it was always nice and quiet when we were there.  

Jana always made herself available through text/email so we were never left without help!

And I can't forget the chocolate on the pillows! :)

Overall, highly recommended!"
143580,660599,2011-10-24,371690,Beth,"I was traveling to Seattle on business and figured I'd take a few days to get out of hotels and into an actual Seattle neighborhood. As a city resident myself, I know how much the good neighborhoods show off the best of a city. Beacon Hill is much more residential than I probably would have chosen if I'd known the neighborhoods, but it is *gorgeous* and you can't beat the views - especially if you're a runner. $10 cab from downtown, $2 bus to downtown from a block away. 

The spot: Jana & Nick are thoughtful & clean hosts, the bed is SUPER comfy, and you have a private bathroom. Not a private entrance, though (although I barely saw Jana or Nick) and you may feel odd about coming in at all hours when the door ""dings"" each time it's opened and closed. Just an FYI. 
"
143580,668319,2011-10-27,1150097,Tony,"Room was just a described!  Very clean, nice, and private.  Jana was very prompt in responding to messages, and was very helpful.  The location was great for sightseeing, and only about 10 minutes from downtown (by car).  

To clarify, you do share the entrance to their townhouse, it is not a separate outside entrance, but it might as well be, you never really know there is anyone else in the house.  

If I am ever back in Seattle, I have a place to stay now! Thanks!"
143580,689794,2011-11-03,1286391,Allison,"Wonderful, wonderful place!  Nick and Jana were so nice and beyond helpful.  My boyfriend and I stayed here for our first week living in Seattle while looking for an apartment to rent, and it was everything we needed.  It was quiet, very private, easy to come and go whenever, and there are some great little local places to eat or hang out in the area.  Also, getting into the city and to all major freeways is a breeze - great location.  The bathroom is especially nice for a basement bathroom (kind of hotel-like), and there is a good amount of storage.  The internet worked well, and overall it was just perfect for us!  Highly recommended!  Thank you, Nick and Jana, for a great experience :)"
143580,716266,2011-11-14,283053,Jasmin,"We spent a great time in Seattle. It is an amazing and very interesting city.
Our stay at Jana and Nick's house was very comfortable and clean. We felt like being in a hotel room :) We enjoyed to be there. It also was very convenient to go Downtown.
Thank you so much!"
143580,755569,2011-11-30,1276258,Samuel,Really easy check in. Great location. Tons of privacy. Good communication. Highly recommend.
143580,760719,2011-12-03,1386709,Tudor,"A great room with its own en suite bathroom, separate from the rest of the house, so nice and quiet.
I had a fun-filled few days down in Seattle, so I only saw Jana very briefly, when she kindly let me store my extra luggage for a few hours, but they were very helpful and answered my newbie questions graciously.
Beacon Hill is a clean, quiet area, within a brisk walk into downtown for those of us who like to walk and don't mind hills! :p
I could have easily used the bus route which links downtown at International District, but I never bothered.
A great jumping off point and good value for the seasoned traveller - certainly more fun than a motel.
I heartily recommend Jana's place as well as airbnb in general.
"
143580,768504,2011-12-06,1226026,Amy,Very convenient and cozy room.  The room was small but had all the amenities and was very private.  Slept well and enjoyed the stay.  Thank you for a comfy and convenient weekend!
143580,851079,2012-01-09,614171,Carmen,"Had a lovely stay. The room is very clean and I found there everything I could ever need, even an iron and a hair dryer. It is very private and cozy. The connection to the city is pretty reliable too. I would come back here anytime I'm in Seattle."
143580,860742,2012-01-13,1587621,Galo,"I HIGHLY recommend this stay with Jana & Nick.  The place was great and location was awesome.  It was a business trip for me, but they made my stay just seamless.  From answering my texts and calls, they did a great job on the accommodation.  

Neighborhood was great!

Galo "
143580,869151,2012-01-17,760546,Maret,"We loved it here. It was quieter than most hotel rooms and very private. Small--but we basically just slept here.  I wanted to take the bed home with me. Next time we're in town, we'll stay here."
143580,891320,2012-01-30,780472,Steve,"I was very happy to stay at Nick & Janna`s house, everything was great, I would stay there again. Janna`s is very quick to responed to all questions.
great hosts"
143580,908018,2012-02-07,571102,Charlotte & Ben,"We had a lovely stay with Jana and Nick. The location and room were perfect for our short stay in Seattle. The location is excellent, just a 5 minute or so walk to the train that takes you to all the areas of the city  and the airport, the room was clean and the bed very comfy. After arriving late afternoon we went out to the theatre and after returning back to the neighbourhood to find all the restaurants closed Nick ever so kindly brought us down a plate of delicious food. A very kind gesture that was greatly appreciated. Excellent hosts, we would stay again when visiting Seattle."
143580,938745,2012-02-21,1691821,Paul,Nice place. Very private. Had a blast. Thanks guys.
143580,954033,2012-02-27,697485,Renée,"Jana was very kind indeed and gave me some Tylenol when I arrived on her doorstep early with a mega-headache. She let me leave my suitcase at her house and use the bathroom. I liked being able to get my bearings in the daytime as I came back much later in the night after my workshop finished. The room was everything they said it would be, comfortable, private and clean. They left a printout of  good recommendations for places to local eateries and things to do nearby. Plus a Hershey bar on the pillow! ;-)  I felt safe and welcome and found parking on the street easily. I commuted to Bellevue for my workshop and that was quick and easy. The price of this room can't be beat! "
143580,972157,2012-03-05,391508,Jian,everything was just so great.
143580,995782,2012-03-13,1681718,Dave,"This was my first trip using airbnb, and I'm happy to say it was exactly what I'd hoped. I had no trouble at all getting in even though we came late in the evening, and everything was neat and tidy when we arrived. The house is literally just around the corner from a bus stop to downtown, and just a few blocks from the light rail, which are more than adequate to get to most places in the city quickly. Overall, a very pleasant stay."
143580,1064761,2012-03-31,158838,Katie,My boyfriend and I loved staying here! The room is indeed *super private* since it is on a different level from the rest of the house. Everything was clean and comfortable. The hosts were easy to communicate with and very accomodating.
143580,1072346,2012-04-02,806683,Michelle,Such a great little place and perfect for what we needed for the weekend. We actually never had a chance to meet our hosts! We left early each morning and returned pretty late. But the room was perfect. Close to train station and in a great neighborhood.
143580,1126377,2012-04-13,824960,Melissa,I had a great two night stay here! Room was very private and extremely quiet. It had everything I needed for my stay.I would stay here again. Area is nice and has some cool restaurants as well. Not a far drive from down town!
143580,1161413,2012-04-21,1785305,Till,The room was very nice and clean with a nice little bathroom. The location is also very good. Not far from downtown and with space to park the car. We hardly saw one of our hosts so the whole stay was quite anonymous. It almost felt like being in a hotel. We however felt very comfortable during our stay and would not hesitate to stay there again.
143580,1214493,2012-05-02,1573611,Natalie,This was our first experience with airbnb and we are beyond happy with choosing Nick and Jana's place. We stayed for a week.   The room was extremely clean and comfortable.  Communication was easy.  Very short commute to downtown with lots to do and see nearby and parking near their house was never an issue as there was always space available. We loved our stay and will choose Nick and Jana's again when we travel to Seattle :) 
143580,1226272,2012-05-04,1979145,Sharon,"Great place in a very convenient location to the light rail and downtown. Jana was very nice and let us do our own thing. The room had everything we needed, including chocolate! Definitely recommend the place."
143580,1317583,2012-05-21,2177112,Stefano,Hosts did not bother us at all and were very helpful when we needed it. Flexible access to room (anytime of day or night) with given key. Would stay with them again!
143580,1341737,2012-05-24,109253,Daniel,"The room is indeed very private and very nice.  I only had occasion to interact with Jana once, but she was helpful and nice.  Everything was exactly as advertised.  Would happily stay here again.  "
143580,1395924,2012-06-01,1809614,Peter,"Best place to stay!!! First of all, that was the most comfortable bed! I didn't want to get out of bed. But because I was there to see Seattle, I eventually did, and because the location was so conveniently located next to public transit, I could go anywhere. The place offered total privacy and was as good as any 5 star hotel. Communication was super easy with Jana also which made the stay extra pleasant. Thank you so much!"
143580,1413202,2012-06-04,2344718,Marlyce,"Very clean and pretty room!  It was the only room on the lower level, so it was incredibly private and secluded.  We especially loved how close to the light rail it was.  It was fun to hop on that and go all over town, without having to worry about downtown parking."
143580,1438898,2012-06-08,2424017,Mark,"This is a lovely space. I needed a small suite for my elderly parents to use for a short visit last week. Jana was helpful, communicated everything in easy-to-use detail, and the room was great. I couldn't be happier with this experience,"
143580,1473867,2012-06-13,163372,Jindra,"It was perfect, everything was professionally organized, prepared. I stayed with my mother, we had privacy, room was nice and clean. I met Jana's husband when I was was checking in but since then we didn't have a chance to meet, which is absolutely ok. We enjoyed staying at Jana's place. Close to everything, nice neighborhood. Totally recommended ! "
143580,1532999,2012-06-21,2633386,Erik,"This is a beautiful little room in the Beacon Hill neighborhood, which is close to Seattle downtown, and fun neighborhoods such as Capitol Hill. The room was beautifully made up, and the bed quite cozy, I got some great rest here, and what a great launch pad for exploring Seattle."
143580,1558625,2012-06-25,2148345,Natalia,"The room was so perfect, and very private. It was very close to Downtown (around $7 by taxi). And near to the house there is a bus stop. So it is a perfect place to stay! Jana and  Nick helped us with some questions, they are really open to communicate. Thanks a lot for your hospitality"
143580,1586959,2012-06-29,1591442,Ann,"Nice room with your own bathroom. Jana is a fantastic host and although i did not get a chance to meet her. But she is very reliable and well communicated. I arrive with clear instruction to get into the flat and everything was perfect and organised. Location is easy to get around, a short walk to the station or 20mins bus ride to Pike street. One good tips is if you are coming back from town by bus around 6-7pm you get a free bus ride in seattle."
143580,1604749,2012-07-01,2630088,Fridrik,"This room is excellent, I recommend it to anyone planning to staying in the city. 

The room itself is very nice, with a great bathroom and very private. Top notch all around.

The area is very close to the downtown area, and we checked out the Baja Bistro on recommendation from the hosts, definitely worth it for a solid breakfast.

If you are coming to Seattle, stay here.

"
143580,1627279,2012-07-04,1880468,Lori,"What a great first experience using Airbnb! Jana sent us clear instructions on how to get to their place, dining options and suggested attractions.  We couldn't have felt more comfortable.  The bathroom was clean, and even had a hair dryer (I had forgotten mine, and was glad I didn't have to go buy one just for our trip).  We would definitely stay here again :)"
143580,1651336,2012-07-07,2654189,Nanette,"We had a great stay at Jana's place. Townhouse lower level is private, contemporary, and clean. Bed is super comfortable. Met Jana's husband who was friendly and helpful. Parking was easily available. List of recommended restaurants and places to visit were all great. Not far from light rail for easy access to the airport, stadiums, or downtown. Little touches like playing cards, ironing board, guidebook, etc. make Jana's place really stand out. "
143580,1658602,2012-07-08,2696140,Joe,Jana & Nick were very welcoming and friendly hosts and the room was even nicer than the profile described.  We got a restful night sleep and were able to try a couple of their suggestions at great nearby restaurants.  There place is very convenient to get to downtown in 10 minutes to explore.  I would definitely recommend as a great value and will definitely be returning on my next trip to Seattle.  Cheers!
143580,1699390,2012-07-13,869744,JoAnne & John,"Jana was a great host. She provided helpful instructions for our stay and responded to any requests/questions we had promptly. Our accommodations were wonderful! The room and attached private bathroom were clean and well kept. It was a quite, relaxing home base while we explored the beautiful city of Seattle. Public transit is within walking distance and easy to navigate. I would definitely recommend this room!"
143580,1787688,2012-07-24,1685608,Brent,"What a great place to stay! Quiet, clean, friendly, and accommodating. Easy access to the airport and downtown Seattle.  Make sure to take advantage of the suggestions for local eateries (Baja Bistro had a great breakfast). I would not hesitate to stay here again on my next visit to Seattle. "
143580,1813916,2012-07-27,2148614,Heather,"Great experience, nice clean room and bathroom with privacy, even though in a shared home."
143580,1882405,2012-08-04,2497336,Taliesin,"I had a great time staying at Jana and Nick's place. The room was very comfortable, clean, and private. They were quick to help me when I needed it. My stay was quiet and relaxing. I would definitely stay here again in the future!"
143580,1913181,2012-08-07,2623316,Lisa,My stay was easy and enjoyable. Jana was very accomodating in adjusting to my needs with regards to check in. I would recommend them as a very private place to stay. The way there home is set-up you are able to go about your business without creating any interruption for them. 
143580,1957866,2012-08-12,887015,Jason,"An excellent place to unload and prepare for the upcoming day! The queen sized bed was very comfy and the room felt very private despite being in a shared townhouse. Jana sent us clear instructions on how to get to their place, where to eat, and what to see."
143580,1980635,2012-08-14,2380871,Cesare,"The room is very private: the entrance door is shared with the rest of the house, but other than that you do not have to share any space with the owners. Both the bedroom and bathroom are very clean and with equipped with modern furniture including a flat screen TV. The overall ""look and feel"" is grat.
Check in and check out are made very easy and can be done anytime making the whole process very convenient. "
143580,2001422,2012-08-16,2798393,Len,"Good experience overall.  Room comfortable.  Met Nick who was welcoming and helpful, i.e letting us know about the light rail day pass and restaurant recommendations.  Enjoyed dinner at the Baja Bistro within walking distance.  Close proximity to the light rail made it easy to park the car and explore downtown Seattle. "
143580,2064477,2012-08-22,2873579,Sarah,"Awesome find. Clean, comfortable, and private. Really enjoyed my stay with him. "
143580,2448214,2012-09-29,1643343,Katya,Amazing spot for a couple. We had everything we needed and really enjoyed our stay. Make sure to check out the Station coffee shop nearby for amazing coffee and delicious spinach scones.
143580,2483973,2012-10-02,3294002,Suzanne,Jana was awesome! The room was perfect! She answered all my questions (silly and otherwise!) provided a comfortable and lovely room with everything you could need. My only wish is that I got to spend more time there! 
143580,2517690,2012-10-05,3726127,Megan And Martin,"Jana and Nick were an absolute joy to stay with. They were super organized, from the quick response time to the email with directions and recommendations.

The room was indeed very private, extremely clean and there were even chocolates on the pillow. :) I was a little worried because I am allergic to cats and they have one, but the room was SO clean you would never know there was cat hair within miles, and their beautiful red tabby kept a polite distance for my sinuses' sake. :)

Their recommendations for restaurants were great - make sure to try the Italian place near their house. The location was also convenient to downtown. They live 10 minutes from the light rail station, but we walked downtown and were at the Pike Place Market in 45 minutes. "
143580,2588111,2012-10-12,3287623,Maria,"Spent a week at Jana & Nick's and it was PERFECT. Best location you can think of - nice neighborhood and easy access to everything (I used bus #36, light rail, and walked places as well). The room is indeed super private, super clean and has a very very comfortable bed. Jana and Nick were very helpful upon my arrival, but other than that I didn't see or hear much of them. Their recommendations on what to do/see around Beacon Hill were very helpful too (loved pizza and cocktails at Bar del Corso!) Highly recommended."
143580,2607438,2012-10-14,2167376,Sophie,"We had a very good time staying at Jana's and Nick's! 
The private room is definitely private. You do not hear or see a word of them. The bed- and bathroom is as pictured as on the photos- very nice and clean with enough space!
The house is located very close to public transportation and close to the city centre!
We are happy we found the three of them!"
143580,2663397,2012-10-20,2242026,Paolo,"Staying at Jana and Nick's place has been simply perfect. It was priceless to come home in the evening, and enter such a  cute and good smelling room. If i'll ever be in seattle again, this is the place i will check first for my stay! Thank you so much!"
143580,2695456,2012-10-23,2102383,Raymond,"We just came back from our two weeks vacation - one part of the trip was the stay with Jana in Seattle.  The location is great, very close to downtown Seattle (by car) and Northgate mall.  

Jana was quick with responses and we did not have any issues with finding the keys and getting comfortable when we got there.  Do heed the warning about Bobo (the cat)... I should have read Jana's warning beforehand.... that kitty can be grouchy and I got a scratch as a souvenir.  :p  

The room is exactly as described and it's nice to have the privacy of the basement and our own shower.  It was very quiet and we felt very much at home.  It was unfortunate that our stay was a short two days and didn't not meet Jana or Nick, but will definately stay with them in the future. :)"
143580,2750020,2012-10-29,989306,Joe N Anna," This place was outstanding. Very clean, quiet, and overall a perfect room for a couple. Jana greeted me when I arrived and was so kind to let me leave my belongings there even though my check in time was not until later that evening. The room has everything that’s needed. Clean sheets, towels, and shampoo were provided as well as an iron and board. This was my first time renting a room and my stay was nothing short of wonderful. I will stay here again when I visit Seattle."
143580,2799367,2012-11-04,1012239,Sonia,"This room was great. It was super private, being the only room on the lower level. It was clean and comfy; a little small for 2 big pieces of luggage, but the walk-in closet helped with that. It's definitely a great deal at this price. I did not get to meet Jana, but she laid everything out ahead of time so clearly that it was easy to get settled in right away."
143580,2832579,2012-11-07,1154803,Kelly,"Just as stated.  A room in the downstairs area with a bathroom inside.  Perfect for someone just wanting a warm, cozy place to sleep.  "
143580,2932335,2012-11-20,2832454,Iben,"Very nice private room. We enjoyed our stay here. It was very private, we didn't even meet Jana, but her directions on how to get the key, internet and so on was so easy that everything went smooth without her help. The room is clean, the bed is nice and the bathroom is perfect. All in all a good experience and I can only recommend to others."
143580,3075314,2012-12-11,2773399,Jay,I didn't have the chance to meet this two in person but their cat always greeted me at the door with a smile. Clean and fresh place. I would definitely recommend staying here.
143580,3108781,2012-12-17,185039,Emily,"Great room, as described. Very private. We were able to walk downtown from the house and it is very convenient to the bus. "
143580,3122884,2012-12-20,3368132,Kerry,Jana and Nick are very sweet and very hospitable. The room is indeed very private and the house is well-located a short walk from the light rail and well-connected by bus to downtown and capitol hill. I'd definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a cozy place to stay near downtown. Because of the light rail it's also very airport accessible!  
143580,3205781,2013-01-01,1372405,Samantha,"We had a great time! The rom is very clean, quiet and private. The bed is comfy and there is plenty of room to store your luggage in the walk in closet. There is a bus stop just around the corner, the link light rail is a short walk away and walking into town takes about 40-50 minutes."
143580,3298558,2013-01-07,923766,Joseph,"This place was awesome. The locations is great especially if you want to take the bus back and forth from downtown. The room is very clean and private, you almost forget other people are in the house. I got to meet Jana while i was there she seemed very sweet and welcoming. "
143580,3392185,2013-01-22,46194,Lily,"The location is great for public transport.  It's in a quiet part of town which is being gentrified... so don't expect cafes and fancy dinners.  It's close to Vietnam town so there's great food not far away.  The place is not big and a the bathroom was chilly.  It's is also not spotless. You have go down stairs to your room so not suitable if you can't do stairs. Parking is on the street.  We didn't meet the hosts as they were out of town, but we did get in early and got a chance to crash even before the cleaners came as I was sick. Overall OK, not the best AirBnb place I have stayed at. Oh the bed is fine, but a little lumpy."
143580,3458669,2013-02-02,4531190,Derek,"PERFECT! Jana and Nick were amazing hosts. The room was cozy and warm, located at the bottom of the house, perfectly secluded. While staying I had my own bathroom and closet as well as TV and Internet. The best part was the heater next to the bed! Perfect for those cold nights. I came all the way from Florida to move out here and this was the perfect transition home! The house was also conveniently located on the 36 bus stop which takes 10 to 15 mins. EASY. PERFECT!!!!"
143580,3539639,2013-02-14,4310376,Morgan,Jana's place is centrally located near downtown Seattle and SeaTac airport. The room met all of our requirements for a short stay in Seattle.
143580,3682787,2013-03-04,806683,Michelle,"Our stay was perfect, as it was last year! The room is very nice and close to the train. Hoping to meet the hosts next time!"
143580,3730979,2013-03-09,5155873,Christian,"This was my first time using Airbnb and I could not ask for a more convenient location, stay and amazing hosts, Thank you Jana and Nick. As a first time visitor to Seattle, staying in N. Beacon Hill was a very convenient way to get around town, the neighborhood is super safe and quiet, even at night. Just a few minutes away from some great local restaurants. 15-20 mins away from downtown; two ways to get into downtown either bus (the 36 I believe), which is just outside of their home, or the light rail which is five mins away. As for the room, supppper nice and cozy, one comfortable queen bed to sleep in, a closet, one bathroom with shower/tub and TV, Wifi. I met Jana and Nick and were super nice, helpful, open to let you know of what you should check out in the city, just an amazing couple. Overall, I would recommend this room, a nice to place to stay or vacation to. I know I'll be staying here once I come back to visit Seattle again. Do it!      "
143580,3783054,2013-03-14,5102885,Guilherme,"If you wanna a really good place to stay in Seattle, you should choose Jana and Nick's place. The room is fantastically clean and private, so you don't need bother anyone in the house with any concern. The house is well located, with a bus stop just up the hill and a train station 5 blocks away. I highly recommend Jana's house and I'll be there again, if I return to Seattle."
143580,3819646,2013-03-18,5061758,Kelly,"My boyfriend and I absolutely loved our stay here! The room really was ""super private"". We did not get a chance to meet them, and I would have loved to say hi. But, my boyfriend, being kind of shy, was happy with this arrangement. Jana was so kind, always replied quickly by text when I had a question, and she even sent me my phone charger that I left there within a week of me leaving! The home is in a beautiful, quiet, and safe neighborhood on a steep hill just a couple of blocks away from the bus to downtown! And, they even left a couple of chocolates and a note on the bed as a welcome. It was perfect. I highly recommend this to anyone visiting Seattle! :) "
143580,3932324,2013-03-28,3230871,Jacob,Had an awesome stay!
143580,4004658,2013-04-02,4729761,Jen & Ryan,"The ideal setup for airbnb travelers! The room is completely private, clean and quiet. We felt very comfortable, and Jana and Nick were very welcoming. Their list of recommendations in the area was just what we needed! A delicious pizza spot, viewpoints of the city, a beach to explore - we took advantage of almost everything on their list, and loved each spot. Beacon Hill is a great neighborhood, with easy access to anywhere in the city. Highly recommended! "
143580,4198352,2013-04-17,5405081,Denisa,"Jana's house is wonderful! The room is super truper private with its own bathroom. I felt like staying in hotel! Everything is super clean and new! Location is also great! 15-20 min bus ride will take you right to downtown! The bus stop is less then 1 min walk from the house!
Jana and her husband made my first air bnb experience the best!
Will be back, for sure!!!
Thank you Jana!
"
143580,4257744,2013-04-22,475122,Calvin,"A comfort hotel, without the high price.  Jana was a great host.  For a first-time AirBnb user, I was pleasantly surprised and delighted by the entire experience. "
143580,4377143,2013-05-01,2415970,Sarah,"Jana's place in Beacon Hill was awesome!  The neighborhood was really safe and a close walk from the nearest light rail station (which I highly recommend using if you can because parking in downtown Seattle is pricey).  Also there was plenty of free parking outside Jana's house.  The room itself was perfect, very clean and the most private I have ever seen on Airbnb. It was like staying in our own little apartment!  Jana was so accommodating in getting us the key, it couldn't have been easier.  I would highly recommend this place for anyone nervous about using Airbnb, the experience we had was perfect!  Skip the hotel and stay here!  Thanks for a great stay Jana!"
143580,4425026,2013-05-04,6050220,Anna,"Jana offers a nice private room. You even have your own bathroom. Everything is clean and cozy.
Since the room is located in their basement we only met Jana once on our arrival. She is a really kind person though.
They really thought of everything - beginning from the save with the keys up to the public transportation guides, the map and all the booklets about the city they left in the room."
143580,4474264,2013-05-07,3486265,Johanna,"This was exactly what I needed to conclude the week out - a nice, private room with its own bathroom and a perfect location to access the public transportation into the city. Nick and Jana included a very helpful list of local places and ideas as well as a guidebook for Seattle itself which was helpful to peruse. Thanks guys!"
143580,4596633,2013-05-14,5641218,Bo,The room is clean and comfortable. Thanks very much for letting us enjoy our vacation. 
143580,4664762,2013-05-19,5914648,Manuel,"We really liked our stay with Jana and Nick! Communication before and during the visit was perfect and very nice. Well organised with the WiFi password ready on arrival and also recommendations for places to eat and to visit! Definitely go to Jose Rizal Park (10 minute walk) , great view of the city. The room was fresh and clean, quiet and private. The adjenct bath is a definite plus! Location is good for downtown access (light rail: 8 minute walk to station plus 10 Minute ride. Bus 36 leaves almost immediately in front of the house and takes 15 minutes). Really good supermarket (Red Apple Market) at the light rail station. So all in all an awesome stay in a great room with nice hosts. "
143580,4708449,2013-05-21,2937501,Ilse,"great place to stay, nice and very clean. It is easy to get to downtown by bus or lightrail. 
We did not meet Jana as the stay is very private. We arrived very late at night, but this was no problem as we could get the key and let ourselves in.
Would definitely reccommend this stay to anyone."
143580,4751078,2013-05-23,4080399,Katheryn,"We loved our stay here. It was a great neighborhood to stay in because you get a flavor of the local neighborhoods, close to great restaurants and public transportation. 

Our hosts were friendly and gracious. The room was very private and nice. Very clean and comfortable! I would recommend this room to anyone who wants to stay in Seattle for vacation or business. "
143580,4832710,2013-05-28,1516667,Stephen,"We had a good experience, room was as advertised, clean and well maintained.  Easy check in/out, no problem with parking.  "
143580,4942740,2013-06-03,6156538,Tony,"The space was clean and cozy, it is not a large room or bath, but adequate for what we were doing. Provided was satellite TV for chill time and some nice amenities (shampoo, conditioner, etc). Getting around from this location was really great, the bus service can get you anywhere from this unit (stop is 1/2 block away). Also the light rail to the airport was really convenient and about an 8-10min walk. I like the Mexican Cantina down the street, awesome lattes and breakfast. Also china town is about a 15-20min downhill walk.

The mattress is not great quality and took a few nights to get used to. A better quality mattress would have made the stay perfect. Jana was very pleasant (we saw her once), and was attentive to anything we needed via phone or text, thanks! "
143580,5002332,2013-06-06,2192373,Hiram,Perfect place for my trip. Jana was very prompt and thorough with all communications/info I needed. The place is private because it is downstairs. I never got to meet Jana but would definitely stay there again. They were out of town on my check in day but check in was still a breeze. Thanks again! 
143580,5275113,2013-06-22,6122547,Joe,Awesome place to stay! A short walk from the light rail station which can take you straight to the airport and literally right across the street from the 36 line (bus) which takes you straight into downtown. Super clean and private room. Great host!  Never got to meet them but they were nice enough to make a list of local spots to check out and left Hersheys chocolates to Welcome me! Would definitely recommend staying here.
143580,5563279,2013-07-06,4177989,Emmanuelle,"Great, clean room, with easy access to downtown and very welcoming host!"
143580,5615432,2013-07-08,6303465,Kevin,The room was very private and exactly as described.  We did not get a chance to meet Jana but she was very responsive to phone and e-mail and available to answer any questions we had.  
143580,5689528,2013-07-12,3932371,Mindy,"This was a great place to stay! It was exactly what we needed—a comfy bed and a bathroom with a good, hot shower that accommodated tall people. The room is in the basement and nicely separated from the rest of their house, which meant we didn't have to feel guilty for coming in late at night. Everything was very clean.

Nick gave us great advice on transportation (the light rail is perfect and so easy, ignore the metro transit trip planner that suggests taking a bus) and places to visit. We would love to return."
143580,5765602,2013-07-15,622546,Faryn,"I was in Seattle for the weekend for a hectic art fest... This cozy little room was a nice and peaceful place to come back to in the evenings.  Very private with a comfy bed, super clean, and close to downtown. I didn't meet Jana and Nick, but they were always quick to reply to my texts!"
143580,5913433,2013-07-22,6903930,Joan,"I'm glad I chose Jana's place in Beacon Hill.  It was exactly as pictured & truly private.  Getting there from I-5 was easy Jana emailed directions) & the neighborhood has the advantage of free parking on the street.  It was great to get downtown in 20 minutes or less on the #36 bus only a block away.
I'd definitely stay again on my next trip to Seattle."
143580,6018391,2013-07-27,6146472,Paul,The reservation was canceled 61 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
143580,6097543,2013-07-29,462590,Paul,"This is a wonderful house! The room is on the ground floor and I could barely tell that anyone else was there the entire time.Jana is a great hostess - lots of information, easy to communicate with and very respectful of privacy. I highly recommend this property."
143580,6162741,2013-08-01,7599671,Danyul,"Room was very clean and well styled. Bathroom has everything in case you forget something! Very private, could barely hear the owners upstairs! Would stay again."
143580,6196581,2013-08-03,6235098,Rabun,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay! The location is fantastic--it's easy to get around to other neighborhoods. Parking was easy. The room was great, with a private bathroom and a SUPER comfy bed! Thanks y'all!"
143580,6280675,2013-08-06,7273007,James,"This is a really great place to stay! Very close to downtown Seattle, and just a mere minutes away from the international district. Comfortable bed, own shower, and the wireless works very well -- we had an Ipad, two smartphones connected with no problems! 

Cooking is not allowed for obvious reasons, but with a few snacks you will satisfy those night and morning cravings. A small electrical kettle for tea or instant noodles would have been great, but i'm not sure how the hosts would feel about that. :p

I never got to meet Jana, but she was a great host when supplying useful information and making the place seem like your own!

It was a very positive experience, and I would not hesitate to stay here again."
143580,6330271,2013-08-08,1859615,Tyler,"The room was clean comfortable and private.  Easy to access from 2 highways and no problems getting in late, just let yourself in! thanks for the great stay :)

Tyler & Kaylan"
143580,6604598,2013-08-18,5343112,Neil & Emily,"Staying at Jana and Nick's place was great. 
We arrived earlier than expected but we were warmly greatest and welcomed in. The room was below Jana's apartment, and so completely private, with ensuite bath/shower room and complimentary toiletries. 

Jana had left information regarding local eateries and activities which we gradually ticked off. The sheets were clean and comfortable and the windows had fly screens (which was a god send as we picked the hottest part of the year to travel) 

The apartment was only a short bus ride into town and we even walked back one evening which took 20-30 mins. We would have loved to have met BoBo but he must have been shy. 

We would highly recommend making The Morelli house part of your journey if you plan on staying in Seattle.
"
143580,6728713,2013-08-23,6298630,Sean,"We really enjoyed our stay at Jana's place.  It was exactly what we wanted.  It was nicely priced, clean, very private, had an ensuite bathroom, great storage, and was within walking distance of the light rail.  It totally fit the bill!  On top of that, Jana was a great host.  She was a lifesaver when I realized I forgot my wine bottle opener and let us borrow hers.  The checkin process was so convenient and being able to drop our luggage off before checkin was also a greatly appreciated convenience.  And for those that care about water pressure (like my fiancee), the shower and tub faucet water flow and temparature were excellent.  Overall, we highly recommend Jana`s.  We`d book it again."
143580,6914725,2013-08-30,3201296,Kt,"Jana and Nick were great! This air b&b experience provided the perfect cozy and private get away we needed! The bed is amazingly comfy, just what a weary traveler needs! Jana is very organized, every detail needed was given to us. Highly recommend! 
"
143580,6994757,2013-09-02,8003304,Gregory,This spot was perfect for our stay in Seattle. The hosts were easy to work with and really let us come and go as we pleased. The room was clean and we had a private bathroom connected to the room. It was the ideal place for our stay! Highly recommended!
143580,7113338,2013-09-07,4129440,Joshua,"My husband and I stayed at Jana and Nick's place for 6 nights of our honeymoon. We wanted to enjoy Seattle without the high price of a downtown hotel. This place was just right! The room looks just like the picture, although it is probably slightly smaller than it appears. The room was comfortable and clean. Jana was delightful and accommodating. Several times she spoke with us to advise us on places to go or best ways to get places. The rooms is extremely private. It is right off the front door, straight down the stairs. It did not feel like staying in someone's home. It was much more private than that. The location is ideal if you are interested in touring the city. It was less that 10 minutes to downtown Seattle by car. It is only several blocks from a lightrail station--an easy walk. The townhouse is on a HILL! Not an incline....a HILL! So be aware of that. Overall, Jana and Nick's home was inviting, clean and well-located. We highly recommend it."
143580,7198382,2013-09-10,5405081,Denisa,"This was my second time staying with Jana and I will definitely be back! The room is super private with your own bathroom, which is big plus! Jana also provides towels, which I remembered from last time, so I didn't have to carry my own! Everything is clean and ready for you on time! Jana is very lovely and flexible! I had a great time staying here! 
The neighbourhood is also very nice and convenient, bus stop just 2 min walk from the house, with a bus which will take you right to downtown in less than 20 min! 
I couldn't ask for more! 
Thank you Jana for your hospitality! "
143580,7273375,2013-09-14,7084952,Amanda,"We had a wonderful time, the place was easy to find and everything went smooth, great room, clean, and private we would stay again and again.  Thank you"
143580,7509527,2013-09-23,7592620,Lauren,"Thank you Jana and Nick!
 
We had a great time staying here, felt like home and I recommend it to everyone!
My husband and I arrived a little bit early, and Jana and Nick let us drop off our luggage in the room, which wasn't ready yet as we were informed. We came back home that night after exploring Downtown all day to a clean and fresh room with some chocolates on our pillows. We saw Nick that first night and he gave us some advice, then we saw Jana on our way out one day, other than that, we had a very private room and got to watch TV and relax. It is very quiet and peaceful. They have shampoo, conditioner, blow dryer and anything extra that you forgot like a toothbrush or toothpaste, it was better than a hotel!
A short 10 minute walk to the train was no problem, there's an Apple Supermarket next to the train if you need anything, and the train ride was only about 20 minutes or so downtown. 
 I recommend this for couples or single travelers. Jana and Nick were warm and welcoming and it was an easy stay! I recommend renting a car as well- we got to explore so much more of Washington than we ever thought we would get to see and it was so cheap, only about $30 a day! 
 Thanks again, we would definitely come back to stay here!"
143580,7627761,2013-09-27,345358,Sharon & Micah,"Jana and Nick's room was perfect for our stay in Seattle. Beacon Hill was extremely convenient with frequent buses directly to downtown and Capitol Hill. The room was small, but comfortable, with a large bathroom and closet. While we only saw Nick briefly the night we arrived (as the front door key was a bit finicky before he showed us the trick), he seemed cordial. The check-in and out process was easy. We had an early-morning departure, so it was great to just return our key to the lockbox as we left."
143580,7739490,2013-10-01,7364622,Jen,This worked great for our visit to Seattle to visit our son and daughter in law.  We used it only for sleeping.  Room was small but had a nice walk in closet and full bathroom.  Cozy and comfy bed.  The wall space heater worked well.  Very quiet.  Private hallway was adjacent to outside entrance.  
143580,7836340,2013-10-05,5155106,Casey,Very cute cozy little bedroom. Location was excellent for the public transit and the neighborhood felt safe to walk around in at night. Perfect for our needs! 
143580,7950168,2013-10-09,8848459,Anch,"Jana was an incredibly gracious host and the arrangements were absolutely perfect.  The room was clean, comfortable, and the perfect home-base while visiting Seattle.  If you rent a car, the location is very easily accessible to the SeaTac Airport as well as downtown Seattle.  Everything is within 15 mins and convenient.  The setup was perfect for coming and going as one pleases with good safety and privacy.  Jana also provides a very welcoming set of instructions prior to arrival which were very helpful and also left a number of Seattle-centric books/pamphlets to complement your stay.  A very positive experience and highly recommended!"
143580,8117733,2013-10-16,8866575,James,"My partner and I had a great time staying here. The room was very nice, had everything we needed and was exceptionally clean. The en-suite bathroom was really handy and the bed was super comfortable. We arrived a few hours early, and had no trouble dropping our bags off while we explored Seattle until check-in at 6pm. The house is very conveniently located about 10 minutes walk from the light rail station and multiple bus stops, it's really quick to get to downtown. The taco van next to the train station is amazing. I would live in that van just to eat tacos for the rest of my life. Thanks Jana and Nick!"
143580,8373099,2013-10-28,2045231,Kathy,"We had a great stay at Jana's house. It was quiet and private. Although I did not get to meet Jana in person, she was courteous and respectful to keep the house quiet. The heater is inside the room right next to the bed and can be uncomfortably hot when it's blowing towards your face. The front door lock can be tricky to use. Overall it was a great experience and I would recommend Jana's house for your stay in Seattle.  "
143580,8565063,2013-11-05,8516252,Frederieke,We had a very short but sweet stay with Jana. We didn't actually get to meet as we arrived very late. But late check in is very easy and Jana is very easy to contact and helpful. Would stay again and would recommend
143580,8804054,2013-11-18,8204814,Desislava,My stay with Jana and Nick was great! Their house is located very close to downtown and it is very convenient for going around Seattle. The room was quiet and homey.
143580,9062043,2013-12-03,441009,Heather,We had a nice stay at Jana and Nick's place and they provided a lot of helpful info for getting around enjoying the neighborhood.
143580,9292421,2013-12-19,8334234,Deborah,"A lovely, welcoming room with a clean, updated bathroom… perfect for our needs as we were visiting our daughter. The room is spacious and comfortable in a quiet neighborhood. This is very well located near buses, walking distance to good places on upper Beacon Hill and super easy access to downtown and Capitol Hill. Easy check-in and check-out using the lockbox, and Jana and Nick were always accessible via phone, email or chalkboard if we needed anything.  A stay here is recommended. I will definitely stay here again. "
143580,9795479,2014-01-10,8541504,Megan,Exactly as described and just what I was looking for; quite private bed and bath with easy access to downtown.  
143580,9843812,2014-01-13,11101935,Rachel,I stayed here with a friend from France for two nights and it was lovely!  Jana managed our check in and check out very well.  The room looks exactly like the photo and is spotless.  The bed is comfortable too.  It was convenient getting around town because a major bus line runs right by the house.  I would definitely stay here again.  Jana even left some chocolate on the pillows!
143580,9939295,2014-01-20,7302505,Emre,"It was my first time using airbnb and I was little bit skeptical at first. But, thanks to Jana and Nick, my first time experience was fantastic! They are both kind, friendly and provide everything you need to make sure that you are comfortable during your stay. 
The room is private, clean and has everything you need. I definitely recommend it and I'm already looking forward to my next stays."
143580,10072120,2014-01-28,10978130,Mark,We appreciated having a quiet room with private bathroom.  Our hosts were quiet and considerate of our needs.  Having a TV in our bedroom was a great perk.
143580,10141623,2014-02-02,9837378,Benjamin,"Nice, spacious, clean room with a private bathroom. Downtown was easily accessible via lightrail. "
143580,10349393,2014-02-15,5405081,Denisa,This was my third time staying at Jana's place and again it was very good experience! Very private room with your own bathroom is always very clean and quiet! Bus stop located 2min from the house is also very convenient! I will be back!!! 
143580,10430015,2014-02-18,6278747,Jenny,"I actually didn't meet Jana while I was staying there over the weekend, but the room was exactly how it was pictured on AirBnB with private bath. The bed was so comfy, I almost forgot I wasn't at home. Parking was easily found across the townhouse. This is my first AirBnB stay and I think I'll be back soon."
143580,10654520,2014-03-02,5811445,Aurélia,"La chambre est propre et offre une totale intimité. Tout est bien organisé par Jana pour que ce soit pratique et confortable. 
Nous regrettons juste de ne pas l'avoir rencontré! "
143580,11331749,2014-03-30,5471216,Waqas,"Jana's home was very close to a bus-stop that took us straight to Downtown. Didn't get to meet her but she was great in communication, and helpful with everything. The room itself is very private and comfy. Would definitely want to come again if I visit Seattle!"
143580,11462024,2014-04-03,1767589,Grant,"What a wonderful room! Everything was super clean and quiet and is very close to the Beacon Hill light rail stop (only about 7-10 min walk). The shower's water pressure was great and the bed very comfortable. Jana was a great host and although my wife and I never got to meet her, she always responded very quickly to any of our messages. We highly recommend the room and would definitely stay here again when visiting Seattle next. "
143580,11521373,2014-04-06,8614940,Rachael,"The space was comfortable, clean and exactly what I needed! Definitely recommend as a spot to stay close-in to downtown Seattle!"
143580,11803200,2014-04-15,1925907,JoAnne,"Perfect accommodation for our needs. We were visiting family in the same neighborhood and needed a comfortable place to sleep and shower.  Jana's room and ensuite bath were fresh, clean, and neat. The bed was comfy and the room was quiet for sleeping. We would highly recommend this room (and have already done so!)"
143580,11939859,2014-04-19,12393648,Brian,"I had a great time staying with Jana and Nick. They are both really cool people and the space they're renting was exactly what I was looking for: quiet, private, and comfortable. It was really easy to get downtown via bus or light rail and there are some really cool restaurants and bars within walking distance. "
143580,12293420,2014-04-28,12111885,Amy,I had a great stay! It was exactly as described - a cozy 1 room with private bath. Perfect set up and super comfy bed and pillows! So easy to get to and from anywhere in Seattle - close to both bus and Link stops.  I never saw Jana but she was very easy to talk to via email and text while I was there. 
143580,13024505,2014-05-17,11658134,Tracy,"Had a great stay!  Great room on lower level of home.  Super private, clean and quiet.  Plus a private bath and television.  Wouldn't hesitate to stay again!"
143580,13105217,2014-05-19,10719290,Susan,The room was exactly as described. We went to two of the restaurant recommendations - The Tamarind Tree (dinner) and Baja Bistro (breakfast) - both very nice. 
143580,13318121,2014-05-25,14821286,Lee,"Great room, very private. Excellent location. I tried the Bar del Corso restaurant recomendation  and was extremely pleased.  Thank you Jana!"
143580,13537416,2014-05-30,14018803,Tom,The room was quiet and as advertised. We got an up close encounter with Bobo the cat who is not friendly to guests. The light rail is more like a fifteen minute walk so if you don't rent a car and you're over 40 you might stay elsewhere. 
143580,13688631,2014-06-02,3711361,Andrea,"Jana's place was exactly as described! Nice, clean and private room (you basically get the little basement all to yourself), very easy to get to and get around, especially with the Light Rail station close by. "
143580,13798403,2014-06-04,15356222,Sandra,Jana was very helpful when we had questions about Seattle.  And the room was perfect!  
143580,13925779,2014-06-08,15622434,Boram,Great private room! Very clean!  Excellent location! I would recommend this room!!
143580,14189964,2014-06-14,304663,Ryan,"Had a great stay at this room. Had the pleasure of meeting both Nick and Jana briefly, but otherwise the room is quiet, private and clean. The bathroom had run out of toilet paper, and Jana went out of her way to come home early to restock it. Their diligence as hosts extend to their communications as well - they are fast to reply to e-mails / text messages.

There's nothing that hasn't really been said about the location. The neighbourhood is quiet and feels safe at night. The light rail station is a bit of a walk (~10 minutes) if you have luggage, but isn't particularly hilly or difficult. The bus works much better for accessing downtown - the bus stop is about a minute's walk, and reaches downtown much faster than you would expect. I almost missed my stop on the way back, not expecting it to be so quick.

This was my first time using airbnb, and Jana and Nick really made it an excellent experience for me overall. It feels pretty much like staying with a good friend."
143580,14335115,2014-06-17,11006967,Mogens,"The room was very nice and clean in quiet neighborhood,and close to the bus downtown. The only thing that we could  have wanted was an oppertunity to make a cup of coffee."
143580,14437911,2014-06-19,15573019,Edward,"The room was very pleasant. The privacy was very enjoyable as a private staircase leads down to the room away from the main house. Entry into the room was very convenient. There was no worries of coming in and out and waking up anyone. The room was fully stocked with shampoo, conditioner and blow dryer. There is a walk in closet which is really nice. The shower is really strong and very modern. I highly recommend this room."
143580,14623101,2014-06-23,7014571,Dmytro,"The room is exactly as described, very private. Very comfortable bed.
Place is 10 mins walk from lightrail and handy to get to the airport. There is a bus stop less then a minute walk and takes you directly to city centre.

Nick is a super friendly guy!
"
143580,15412535,2014-07-08,1442669,Olga,"We didn't have a chance to meet Jana in person, but she was very helpful and nice. We had a very early flight and she let us check in early. The room is not very big but cozy and feels very private. The place is a short walk from light rail station, so it's easy to get to both downtown and airport. Overall great place to stay!"
143580,15543292,2014-07-11,16766457,R A Chel,Jana's place has a really good location. The room  is downstairs and the bathroom is just in the bedroom so we get a lot of privacy there. I recommend this room for the travelers who cares personal space and neighborhood convenience. 
143580,15918477,2014-07-18,15089405,Thalia,"It was a very pleasant experience, although I did not have the chance to meet my hosts. It is indeed a super private room and the location is very convenient, especially when you've got a car (as in my case). I would recommend this listing and definitely stay again if I'm in Seattle."
143580,16026326,2014-07-20,232040,Jackie,"Staying at Jana's was fantastic. It was a private suite that was perfect to rest after a packed day in Seattle. Jana provided clear instructions about how to get to the house, a few restaurants around the area, and a viewpoint. It was the perfect location to get downtown easily and quickly, with connection happening near downtown to visit Fremont and Queen Anne. Unfortunately, we didn't get to meet our hosts, but the overall experience was lovely (and I'm sure they are, too!)"
143580,16461923,2014-07-28,10857590,Meena,"Privacy, bathroom - excellent
convenience to public transit- excellent
no microwave oven or mini fridge for guests who have come to tour Seattle for 4 days - we could not make a cup of coffee, or even heat or store restaurant bought food- very inconvenient and a big handicap, even motels provide this !!!!"
143580,16718751,2014-08-01,1665832,Leslie,We had a great stay at jana's appartememt. She gives us all information about the area which was very helpful. The house is close from the train station and the center of the city. Plus the room is very cosy. I recommand that place
143580,16988812,2014-08-05,9520237,Lizzie,"The room was just as advertised. Jana was very considerate in letting us in early. The bed was very comfortable and the shower had great water pressure! They also provided towels, soaps, and a hair dryer, which definitely helped us cut back on packing. "
143580,17217862,2014-08-09,17561763,Leslie,"The room was very private and hosts were friendly. The neighbourhood shows signs of upgrading, like this condo, but overall there are no amenities in the area except for a Mexican cafe. Cleanliness of the unit was an issue.  There were stains on the carpet, cobwebs and spiders, the bathroom vent was plugged with lint resulting in poor ventilation and mould growth on the walls. This took away from a very pleasant stay in Seattle."
143580,17336399,2014-08-11,9645734,Leenke,"We had a great stay at Nick & Jana's place. Perfect place to relax after our long trip, very private and quiet. The view from the Jose Rizal Park was amazing and having breakfast at Baja bistro was a good choice! Thanks for those recommendations!"
143580,18207182,2014-08-23,19922059,Katie,"Jana's place was great! Very private and had a comfortable bed and nice bathroom. The unit was as advertised and was a great place to stay, especially for the price.  We basically just slept there (we were out and about site seeing all day long) and found the train line to be very convenient for commuting to all the major sites, while leaving our car parked on her street for free.  Would definitely stay here again if I were to visit Seattle."
143580,18312774,2014-08-25,17073670,Carolyn,"We enjoyed our stay on N. Beacon Hill. The room was exactly as described and very comfortable. It was easy to get around due to the excellent tips from the hosts. We took the bus everyday and the price was great and we didn't have to move our car once in 2 days. Also, we enjoyed some of the hosts' favorite restaurants and places to visit in the area. This was our first experience with Airbnb and it worked out great for us."
143580,18503623,2014-08-27,9509333,Ashleigh,"Great place! We were only there for a short time but it worked well, no problems or complaints at all! Was clean and all set up when we arrived. "
143580,18605638,2014-08-28,11658134,Tracy,One of my favorite rooms to stay in when I'm in Seattle.  Super private and quiet with private bathroom.  Always clean and super comfy bed.  
143580,18715129,2014-08-31,16789212,David,here are the positives. It is within walking distance of the light rail and the neighborhood restaurant Baja Cafe is excellent. Now the negatives. The room is very small.  The bed takes up the majority of the space and the carpet could use cleaning. There was no hand soap at the bathroom sink and no cup for a drink of water. There appears to be black mold in the bathroom. This was reported by a previous guest but it was still there.   
143580,18900728,2014-09-02,8314872,Rachel,Jana's place worked out perfectly for our short trip to Seattle. We were out all day and only in the suite for a few hours sleep and a shower in the morning. We really appreciated the quick response time on email; ease of accessing the suite (keyless entry); and that our request to drop off luggage early was accommodated. We enjoyed breakfast at the Baja Bistro (the enchiladas de huevos was delicious!) and the convenience of the light rail to downtown. 
143580,19028906,2014-09-05,17761285,Anna Lena,"This was our first time to travel/sleep via airbnb and it was such a positive experience to us, that we just booked our next stay at another host in another city. 

The accommodation was just as described and shown in the pictures. Very cozy and comfortable room and easy communication with Jana and Nick. 
Beacon Hill is a good place to stay, because it is perfectly situated between SeaTac and Seattle downtown. So we just got into the Link at SeaTac and brought our luggage here and went then with the metrobus to the city center. 

We highly recommend Janas and Nicks place! :-)"
143580,19271782,2014-09-09,18248006,José Luis,Hola..  Estancia perfecta en su hogar..  Ningún problema..  Habitación como en las fotos..  Anfitriones perfectos..  Ubicación cercana a transporte público..  
143580,19516731,2014-09-14,15238064,Anjuli,"Jana was an incredible host to my friend and I in Seattle! She was attentive and available for questions during our stay. The room was clean, cozy and quiet and the bed was incredibly comfortable! The location is fantastic and a very short walk from the train station which takes you all over Seattle, including the airport. I would definitely stay here again! "
143580,20278963,2014-09-27,10027583,Louisa And Martina (Und Familie :-)),"Wir haben uns in Janas Zimmer sehr wohlgefühlt! Der Raum hat eine sehr tolle Lage in Beacon Hill und eine gute Verbindung zu den öffentlichen Verkehrsmitteln, die einen in ca. 30 Minuten in die Innenstadt bringen. Das Bett war sehr bequem und vor allem ausreichend groß für zwei Personen. Toll waren auch Shampoo, Spühlung und Duschgel im Badezimmer. Das Zimmer sieht auf den Fotos um einiges größer aus als es ist. Die Sauberkeit ist eindeutig noch zu verbessern, recht staubig, Haare im Badezimmer und wir sind uns auch nicht sicher, ob der Boden gesaugt wurde. Trotzdem haben wir uns wohlgefühlt und einen tollen Aufenthalt gehabt."
143580,20452812,2014-09-29,21225656,Avin,The house is very beautiful ，I like it.Jana and nick are very helpful and friendly persons.And it is very convenient for you to go outside .We have a good time here.If I come to seattle again.I will comeback haha～
143580,20670928,2014-10-03,20133853,Steve,Cool little space.  very private and the bed is super comfortable!  Would stay again!
143580,20999459,2014-10-09,1815347,Ann,This room was perfect for our stay.  It was easy to get to from the Light Rail Station and suited our needs well.  We were able to easily go downtown and also to West Seattle by using the Light Rail to connect to the water taxi down at the pier.  The bed is super comfy and we passed out each night after our day's adventures.  We did not have time to explore the Beacon Hill area but were comfortable walking to and from the Light Rail at all times of the day.  We also appreciated the suggestions printed out by our friendly hosts.
143580,21279919,2014-10-14,2792093,Chris,"Jana and Nick have a wonderful place here!

The comfort and privacy were exactly what we needed--we know where we will stay the next time we come to visit.

Everything was extremely easy, exactly as described, and very self-service for us (which we love!).  Jana was also very responsive to the couple of questions that came up during our stay, including letting us borrow a pair of scissors right away!

Each morning, we walked to a nearby coffee shop and then took the light rail to downtown--it was the perfect arrangement."
143580,21484422,2014-10-18,20891358,Joe,"Me and my girlfriend had a brilliant time staying here,very easy getting in and out of downtown with the bus.The stop is only 2 mins away.Plenty of privacy as well and the hosts are great just like to thank Jana and nick for a brilliant time and would definitely stay here again"
143580,21777724,2014-10-24,16465661,Yibai,"Jana and Nick's home is quiet, clean and near to Beacon Hill Station. It's our first try through AirBnb, love it."
143580,22228337,2014-11-02,19056631,Katrina,"The room was great, just like it was pictured and Jana and Nick were very friendly and welcoming. We ran into Nick our first night and Jana helped us super quickly the second night when we needed some amenities. They had a nice shower with good water pressure, the closet was big and the heater only took a couple minutes to really heat up the room. We had a lovely stay especially for our first time using airbnb. Thank you Nick and Jana."
143580,22651093,2014-11-11,21454018,Morgane,"What a lovely room ! We really enjoyed our stay at Jana & Nick' home. The room and its private bathroom are very comfortable and clean, the house is located next to Beacon Hill Station (it only takes you a couple of minutes to go downtown). I highly recommend it ! :)"
143580,23469409,2014-12-01,23936031,Huang,"The place is just like Nick and Jana described. It's a clean, bright and comfortable private room. I really enjoyed to stay here. Location to public transportation is convenience. I met Nick in the first day. He's really nice and replied text soon. If I have chance to visit Seattle, will stay here for sure !!"
143580,24160641,2014-12-21,23008539,心悦,"We spent 5 nights in Jana's house and it was great. The room is clean and the bed is very cozy. It's near to the bus stop and train stop, very convenient. We really had great time in Seattle."
143580,24411762,2014-12-28,21415226,Yohei,"It was a really good stay and the host was nice !
The location was really good and the bathroom was so clean!"
143580,25288461,2015-01-11,25335516,Philip,An absolutely fantastic experience. I couldn't have been made to feel more welcome and everything was very comfortable. I would certainly recommend this house to anyone! 
143580,26713738,2015-02-17,27388706,Ting,nice room. super private and quite. comfort bed. and friendly NICK. definetly recommended.
143580,27272398,2015-03-01,16565614,Teo,The bedroom was fantastic with it's own private bathroom. The location was convenient as well. The host was very friendly and offered advice as well on the things to do. The guide they wrote was great.. tried out the pizza place and the pizza was awesome. The bedroom is very private so you will not disturb the host when you enter or leave the house.
143580,27608950,2015-03-08,26381137,Ruoyun,"Jana and Nick are wonderful hosts. The room is quiet and clean, and I really had a great time there:)"
143580,27850394,2015-03-13,10777016,Steve,"Jana was very responsive to questions I had before my arrival and Nick greeted me warmly when I arrived. I thought the room and bathroom were neat, clean and comfortable  and the heater worked very well on two chilly evenings. 
I missed a mini-refrigerator and a small microwave and a desk to write on.
The walk to the Light rail was 6 blocks and no more than ten minutes walk and felt quite safe. It was an easy 15 minute ride to downtown. Buses were noted very frequently running the route from the Light rail to Nick and Jana's, the same ones that could take you to downtown. 
There was only one relatively large grocery store across from the light rail but I found the selection of restaurants wanting, especially for breakfast."
143580,28190236,2015-03-19,24260970,Vicky,"The room was incredibly comfortable, exactly as described! We didn't get a chance to meet our hosts (except for a very pretty cat), but getting in and out was no problem. The room was very clean, and felt very private. Close enough to everything we wanted to do (we had a car though)."
143580,28387849,2015-03-23,18756589,Xiao,"This is really a cozy private room. Location is nice and near to all the downtown places we hope to reach. And neighborhood is very safe, we walked to the townhouse after parking in the downside street. 

The room is as posted pictures in the downstairs,  and not interacted to other living area for the host. Clean, quiet. Shower is nice as well as the bed. 

We enjoyed staying here for two nights. Since it's our first airbnb try, I feel almost satisfied with it. 

One thing need to improve for saying is the sound of heater when it re-heat the room. It did awake us several times on the first night, then kind of get use to it. "
143580,28718187,2015-03-29,28076894,Ping,Jana and Nick were great hosts!
143580,29056741,2015-04-03,4143841,Matthew,"Jana and Nick were excellent hosts. Before we even arrived Jana emailed me specifics about the room and things to do in Beacon Hill. We were greeted warmly by Nick upon arrival and then were left to enjoy ourselves the rest of the trip. Really easy to get in and out of the room, and very private, as advertised. I would definitely recommend this spot to anyone visiting the beautiful city of Seattle!"
143580,29475795,2015-04-07,30055875,Daniel,"Wonderful experience. I had a last minute cancelation for a different host and was left to find another place to stay last minute. Janna and Nick replied promptly. When I arrived Nick greeted me. He was very friendly, showed me to my room, and upon my arrival invited me to join them for a drink with their company upstairs. After an exhausting week of business and travel I decided not to, but it was a kind gesture and made it feel like I was welcome in their home. The space was exactly as described. It was very private, on the lower level by itself with a private bathroom. This allowed me to come and go without fearing that I'd be bothering anyone. The room was cozy and the bed comfortable. The neighborhood itself is fairly quiet but it is a one minute walk to the bus station to get to downtown, Capital Hill, and other areas. The light rail is a bit of a walk, but not unreasonably far away. I would stay here again and would recommend the same for anyone looking for a place in Seattle!"
143580,30041832,2015-04-16,20130791,Jennie,"Jana was a wonderful host. Before we even arrived, she emailed us everything we needed to know about the house and our stay, as well as several recommended locations to visit around the area. The room was very nice and clean. The bed is very comfortable and the heater warmed us up right away. Good location and plenty of street parking. Unfortunately, we did not get to meet our hosts in person but Jana was very quick to reply and answer any questions we had over messaging. The house is located on a steep hill so parking can be a little scary if you are not use to it. Other than that, we enjoyed our stay and would highly recommend staying at this location for anyone visiting Seattle. "
143580,30686761,2015-04-26,6607,Peter,"We were greeted when we arrived and the next morning, but otherwise we were out all day/night and did not see the hosts.  The entry leads to a downstairs bedroom and bathroom.  It was quiet and private.  The location is a few blocks to light rail, a market, restaurants and coffee shops.  Overall, a good place to stay when you will be out all day, need a good night's sleep and get ready for the next day."
143580,31341804,2015-05-04,30597043,Qi,"This is a wonderful room for me to stay in Seattle. It's nice, clean and quiet. Every morning I wake up with some birds singing.  The transportation is quite convenient as I can take bus line 36 nearby. The room is also nearby to China town which makes me feel very good. Jana is very nice who make the small room very sweet and let us put our luggage in the room after the check out time. It's absolutely a great place to leave when you stay in Seattle."
143580,31987952,2015-05-12,31103131,菜未,Location was great! cheaper than hotel but sooo counfortable room. amazing!! I really like this room. Host was welcoming us and giving a lot of information about seattle. thanks very much!
143580,32125608,2015-05-14,28986572,Thomas,"We had a perfect couple of days in Seattle, at Beacon Hill. The room was very nice and indeed in a part of the house with a lot of privacy. We could come and go when we wanted.The bus stop is just around the corner, so in 15 minutes you're downtown. Thanks Jana and Nick!"
143580,32285795,2015-05-16,15636028,Tracy,I had a great time staying with Jana.  Most comfortable bed I've ever slept in.  Very convenient to downtown and great neighborhood.  I highly recommend staying here to save some money over a hotel. 
143580,32535228,2015-05-19,31049412,Yuyi,The room was good and the bed was very comfortable! Quiet neighborhood. 
143580,32823182,2015-05-22,22289931,Joe,The room was clean. Big bathroom. Awesome neighborhood. Hosts were very nice
143580,33128375,2015-05-25,31887156,Quang,"Enjoyed my stay at Jana's place. Very private room, the bed was clean and comfy. Quiet neighborhood, close to all tourist attractions in Seattle."
143580,33572344,2015-05-30,28069366,Jessica,"I have only good things to say about this spot. Nick was there when I got in, and showed me to the room - which was pleasant and clean. It was exactly as described in the posting. The room is really private, and it's quite quiet. (They seem really concerned about the pipes not being insulated, but the noise from that is not that bad at all).  They have a list of things to do around the neighborhood in the room, which I really appreciated (and I wound up following most of their recommendations, all of which were great). 

The neighborhood is great. I was in Seattle for a conference downtown, but it was so much nicer to stay in this place and get away from the conference/downtown scene a bit. Being so close to the light rail made it really easy to get both downtown and to/from the airport, and Beacon Hill seems to have quite a bit to offer. Baja Bistro was great, as was the Tippe and Drague Alehouse - just a 20 minute walk from their place. "
143580,33949541,2015-06-02,28579963,Xiangyu,"I had a really lovely stay at Jana and Nick's place in Seattle. 
The place is cozy, in a quiet neighborhood, and not far away from downtown as well. Nick was always trying to help me in all the possible ways and gave me a lot of valuable advice to travel in Seattle.
This is a place I would definitely recommend for anyone who would love to have a stay in Seattle."
143580,34086162,2015-06-04,2344260,Joe,"The listing description was basically accurate.  The room is part of a building with what appeared to be condominiums.  The room was quite private.   We got inside through a push-button system and only saw our hosts once.  
The neighborhood was near the international district and was a mixed neighborhood of Asian, Latin, African-American and white folks.  It was a working-class setting and pleasant.
It would have helped to know ahead of time about mass transit options.  I was without a car during some of the time and did not realize that walking to the site from downtown was like climbing a mountain."
143580,34867354,2015-06-13,30920974,Christiana,"Yes, our host made us feel very welcome! He was there to meet us when we arrived and was always quick to respond via text if I had any questions! The room and area was 100% accurate in its description and we loved it. It was a great value, very cozy, very private, and just what we needed on our road-trip!"
143580,35197731,2015-06-16,25449758,Lars Und Tina,The room was great and exactly as described. It looked a little bigger on the photos but we there was still plenty of room for the two of us. We felt safe around the house and the neighborbood. Public transportation to downtown is just two minutes away. We only met Nick but he was very nice and welcoming. We would definately stay here again. 
143580,35583892,2015-06-20,33989636,Tavia,"We would absolutely stay here again in the future! Jana and Nick were extremely helpful and welcoming from the very beginning. My boyfriend and I were visiting Seattle for the first time, and staying at Jana and Nick's was the best decision we could have ever made. Nick greeted us when we arrived earlier than expected, and he made sure the room was spotless when we returned from dinner. Such a cozy room, felt just like home! Thank you both for the pleasant stay!"
143580,36199120,2015-06-26,27190915,Nancy,"It was our first time to Seattle, and it was easily to get to Jana's house, street parking is available all the time. We met Nick in person, and he is very nice and welcoming with recommendation on where to walk around and have something for dinner. The room is good enough for two of us, very quiet and perfect if you want to explore the city in the day and get a good sleep at night. thank you for Jana and Nick! We will definitely be back if we visit Seattle again!"
143580,36550704,2015-06-29,33848471,Kaitlin,Loved this place!! Short walk to the light rail which made it convenient to explore downtown Seattle. Room was clean and perfect for our stay and the bathroom is vary spacious. I really appreciated recommendations also. The Baja bistro had amazing breakfast. We would definitely stay again and will be recommending it to friends. 
143580,36815179,2015-07-01,28201791,Chris,"This is a clean and efficient small room. We had a pleasant stay. It's very conveniently located in a quiet and nice neighborhood, five minutes' walk to to the light rail. "
143580,37877490,2015-07-11,17201322,Sarah,We loved our stay with Nick and Jana! We were able to come and go without feeling like we were in the way! The space was perfect for two people! They were also very quick to reply to messages. We would definitely stay with them again! 
143580,38522637,2015-07-16,26961485,Cori,It was great! I loved how private the room was and the bed was comfy and attached bathroom. We really appreciated how the towels and bedding was white so we knew it was clean. We were lost finding it at first when checking in but he immediately responded and met us outside. And WAY close to the light rail which was so great for the airport and going into the city which we did. 
143580,39899830,2015-07-27,25623334,Eva,"J'ai été très bien accueillie, Nick m'a expliqué ce que je pouvais trouver dans le quartier etc.
La chambre est cosy et le lit un vrai nuage! Tout est très propre. 
C'était un plaisir de rester dans leur maison même si je ne les ai pas beaucoup croisé."
143580,40211814,2015-07-29,33369449,Louise,"Easy access to the airport and downtown with the Link light rail. 
Residential neighbourhood - don't expect many restaurants. 
The room was fine. Easy and flexible access with plenty of privacy. "
143580,40775074,2015-08-02,37072655,Thomas,Nick was warm and cordial. Made us feel welcome. Your neighborhood is conveniently located for the light rail and bus. We did not use our car while staying in Seattle.
143580,41342931,2015-08-07,33526695,Craig,It was a great location! It was a very private room in a nice neighborhood! We felt spoiled by that convenience. Just remember that the room is small but the bathroom is a decent size. 
143580,41930502,2015-08-10,31346140,Bernie,"The host greeted us warmly on arrival and indicated that minimal interactions between the host and us should be expected.  We appreciated the privacy and found the location to be convenient, as it was close to public transport and amenities.  Unfortunately, although advised by the host that they did not have a chance to fully clean the room prior to our arrival and the previous guests departure, it was apparent that room had not been thoroughly cleaned for a period of time.  As such it did not meet our standards of cleanliness and detracted from our experience."
143580,42377089,2015-08-13,13146765,Elina,"We sadly didn't meet Jana and Nick because we came late and left early and spent the whole day running around. The room was just as described and it had everything we needed! It was really handy that the stairs to our room downstairs left staight from the front door since we arrived late because of our flight. The location was just great, we loved the peacefull neighbourhood  andit was a short walk to light rail and it was super easy and fast to get to downtown. If and when we come back to Seattle we would be more than happy to stay in here!"
143580,43679447,2015-08-21,40436364,Caitlin,"My partner and I went to Seattle for a couple days to check out the city since he's considering transferring his job there. Jana and Nick's place was perfect for our stay-- very private, easy to access, clean, and walking distance to the light rail (a HUGE convenience)! We had an opportunity to chat with Nick who was very warm and welcoming and provided us great insight into what it's like to transition from living in the south to Seattle. 
The room is quite small but has a large closet so your stuff doesn't have to limit your space. It was a great size for two people, particularly since we spent most of our days out and about. Jana and Nick were very prompt in responding to any questions we had via text. This was our first experience with airbnb and it was quite positive. 
Highly recommend! "
143580,44459656,2015-08-26,37244496,Amy,"We had a great stay! It was all we needed, clean, quiet, close to the light rail. I'd definitely stay there again. "
143580,44760629,2015-08-29,33509481,Erik,"The host welcomed me (and even loaned me a bottle opener!). There's on street parking that isn't metered; however, it's a 5-10 minute walk to the light rail station connecting to downtown and the airport. The neighborhood is a mixed income area and doesn't have the uniform gentrification present in destination Seattle areas. "
143580,45108868,2015-08-31,25043650,Seth,"We enjoyed our time at Jana's in Seattle.  We loved how close Beacon Hill was to the downtown area, and we felt secluded from the business of downtown at night.  We did have to take a zytec allergy med because of our cat allergy, but we knew they had a cat coming into the experience so we were prepared.  We had a great time and recommend this private room for a place to get good, comfortable rest.  Thank you Jana!"
143580,46535005,2015-09-11,13851727,Steve,Seattle is an amazing city! This airbnb was perfect (I can't say that enough)!  Everything was as it looked and I was given a sheet with awesome places and rules. I 100% recommend this place
143580,47411260,2015-09-18,30704436,Erin,"After long days of sightseeing, coming back to this private, cozy room was such a comfort. The bathroom was stocked with plenty of soft, white towels, and the shower had everything from shampoo to face wash. The room was also furnished with Direct TV which made my football-crazy husband very happy. As Jana mentions, they are super close to the rail station, and that came in handy more than once. We also rented a car, and there was ample parking on her street.  

Jana was a great communicator and made everything simple. It was a huge perk being able to drop off our luggage early since we arrived a few hours before check-in. We can't wait to come back to Seattle, and we'd definitely stay here again. "
143580,47665854,2015-09-21,37355427,Danielle,"We weren't able to meet Jana, although we did meet her husband, but we very much appreciated the privacy that we were granted. It was great having a room and bathroom completely separate from the main floor. Instructions were all clear and communication was quick! We had a great time in Seattle, and much of that was due to having a wonderful place to stay. Thank you!"
143580,48293890,2015-09-25,33420652,Amber,The room was perfect! It was cozy and clean. Just what you see on the pictures. It is close to the train that takes you downtown. Jana respond very quick to my email and questions. It was also very easy to get in with a code. So you don't need a key. I'd definitely book this again when I come to Seattle. Jana thanks! 
143580,48694995,2015-09-28,14018730,Lucy,"It was a great location and super private- we didn't even interact with our hosts once! However, they were very quick to respond to questions via text/Air BnB messaging. The location was also very convenient- close to bus stop and lightrail, which we utilized frequently. Bed was extremely comfortable and good size for 2 people. Only drawback was that it wasn't super clean as we did find a couple of dead spiders upon our arrival. "
143580,49336117,2015-10-03,41406290,John,Fist AirBnB and it couldn't be better.  Nick and Jana have a super nice and comfortable place.  It was a $6-8 uber ride to downtown Seattle.  Nick was a  wonderful wonderful host.  Thank you Nick.  Thank you Jana.  Hope to see you again one day.  
143580,49581444,2015-10-05,33503675,Lea,The host canceled this reservation 4 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
143580,49800244,2015-10-06,42865591,Omar,"Listing was very accurate and it was a nice, quite neighborhood.  Plenty of parking on the street.  I didn't get a chance to meet Jana or Nick, but everything was as advertised.  I would stay there again. "
8847979,51093199,2015-10-17,40640632,Megan,Awesome stay! Peter was kind enough to accommodate different check-in & check-out times and his apartment was very cleanly. He even left me an ice cream greeting in the freezer! You can tell right off that he's an incredibly thoughtful guy.
8847979,51405393,2015-10-19,21410597,Joe,"Peter was an excellent host and his place suited my needs perfectly; quaint, cozy and in a great area of the city. When I met him he gave me a tour of his apartment and recommended some great places to visit in the area. I had an early flight on Sunday and he was willing to get up early and come pick up the key at 5am, while also making sure I had a way to the airport. He was everything I needed in a host, accommodating yet not intrusive. I highly recommend booking with him"
8847979,51989013,2015-10-25,35577593,Tim,Laura's place is great and near my daughter's house in beautiful Queen Anne section of Seattle 
8847979,52905265,2015-11-02,12613318,Danielle,The location and the space are even better in person. It was a private clean studio with everything you need from a kitchen to a washer and dryer. Peter was very reliable and helpful. I walked almost everywhere. Great location! Great host! I want to go back already:)
8847979,53036595,2015-11-03,1347414,Sebastian,"I asked for a room and nearly one hour later I got it - great! The room itself was pretty clean, well kind of sterile like a hospital (I prefer to live with locals and share their rooms or houses), but I slept well and needed to be central, so it seemed to be perfect anyway."
8847979,53629743,2015-11-10,4266894,Annatova,Great space in a perfect location to walk all over Seattle. Peter is super nice and helpful! Responsive and flexible about extending my stay. 
8847979,53936530,2015-11-14,9644093,Jac,Peter was very accommodating. The place was super clean and in an awesome location. He even left me a Starbucks gift card! 
8847979,54160192,2015-11-16,47634397,Audrey,"What a great trip! Peter was very accomidating and willing to work with our check in/check out times. The location was within walking distance of all the tourist sights we wanted to see as well. The studio itself was clean and modern, and furnished with everything we needed.

I would definitely stay with Peter again next time in Seattle- highly reocmended! "
8847979,54547940,2015-11-21,40706878,Tiffany,"Peter's place was perfect for our trip! It was very clean and he left us a little gift in the freezer upon our arrival. Peter and his girlfriend Emily were more than accommodating to our needs as we traveled from the east coast and arrived very late. Peter was super responsive via airbnb and text. The area where his place is located allows you to walk anywhere, we loved it and felt safe.  "
8847979,55255764,2015-11-29,13391174,Pedro,"I stayed with my girlfriend at Peter's studio for Thanksgiving. Peter made sure we could access his place quickly. It is nicely located, about three blocks from the City Center complex (i.e. Space Needle, Chihuly, EMP and Key Arena) and a 5 minute ride to Pikes Place. His studio was clean and warm, and Peter was quick to respond to my inquiries. I would definitely stay at Peter's place again when I return to Seattle"
8847979,56310803,2015-12-12,48182302,Bryan,"The apartment was clean, tidy, and exactly as described. The neighborhood was great and within walking distance of many attractions and restaurants. Peter was very friendly and helpful and we had no issues with him or the apartment. Would stay again!"
8847979,56874026,2015-12-19,8785118,Sherie,"What a great flat for my short stay in Seattle.  Will recommend for my friend and family to stay!  Short walk to great restaurants, the theater and down to Pikes Market, where I then hopped on the ferry.  Perfect location!  

 Peter was there when I arrived, showed me his flat and then we chatted about travel for quite some time.  A great host and his home was perfect.  Clean, comfortable....just what he had shared in his description posting.  Thank you, Peter, for the great nights sleep!  "
8847979,57219074,2015-12-23,2386589,Tiffany,"New apartment conveniently located for grocery shopping, quick jog along Elliott Bay, restaurants and bus rides. 
Small but got most of the stuff you need. Fresh towels and new bottles of handwash, shampoo + conditioners and body wash. Comfy beds and linen. 
"
8847979,57949734,2015-12-30,15427084,Julie,This room was as described; it was very clean and quiet. It was a perfect location. Peter was a great host. I would definitely stay again. 
9367465,55521232,2015-12-01,49579198,Tara,"You will love staying here! Crow's Nest Cottage is full of light (high ceiling, lots of great windows) yet very private. It's tucked in the back yard of a private home, but none of the windows face any other buildings. It delivers on all three: lots of light, close access to bus line, restaurants, and shopping, and yet total privacy. It is a sturdy, beautifully designed building (I'd describe as rustic modern) with thick walls that contain sound well: blast music or shout out your creed and not be heard by neighbors. Top of the line appliances, kitchen, and bath fixtures. Lots of natural wood (butcher block kitchen counters and thick, exposed wood for loft floor which is also the kitchen ceiling). Giant ceiling fan, tank-less-on-demand-hot-water heater, skylight with a remote shade for sleeping in, and excellent light fixtures throughout. My father is an architect and I can't wait to put him up here. This place delivers a lot of simple luxuries for a very good price. The hosts, Amy and Matt have the right demeanor for Airbnb: they have a kind and easy going nature, are clear communicators, responsive to emails, calls, and texts, and are thoughtful about the details (nice towels, cutlery, kitchen ware, etc.). With kindness and good humor they set me up with everything I needed, left me alone, but were readily available when I wanted or needed to engage. You can walk down 6th Ave to Veraci Pizza or Slate Coffee shop. Walk, ride, or drive for 4 minutes over to Ballard Market to stock up the cool LG bottom-freezer fridge. I wish I could live there permanently. I will definitely be back.     "
9533648,55517271,2015-12-01,48659743,Kyle,"Andrew was very flexible with meeting up with us once we got to the city, and welcomed us with a bottle of wine and an offer to reach out to him for recommendations during our stay. The location is outstanding; we were able to walk to most of the places that we wanted to see."
9533648,55701300,2015-12-04,48814047,Elena,The apartment was great. Very clean and well kept and an amazing deal for the price. Andrew was more than helpful and very friendly and easy to talk to. He was available the whole stay to answer any questions and responded to texts quickly! It's in a good location for the most part and is technically walkable to downtown and to Pikes Place market however if you are from out of town like us and don't know the area just be warned the walk downtown is literally straight downhill and then straight back uphill the whole way. So although walkable it's not quick or easy. We found it easier to just catch an uber which is a really quick 5 minute ride to anywhere downtown! Also parking was a nightmare for us because all the streets for several blocks are all either permit parking or 2 hour parking that have very strict parking patrol and we ended up with a ticket because you have to remember to feed the meter literally every 2 hours all day long.  Overall though we enjoyed our stay and would stay here again in the future but probably not with a car
9533648,56154870,2015-12-09,50149161,Evan,"Andrew was a fabulous host! I was traveling through doing job interviews and needed a home base, and the place worked out perfectly. Conveniently located within walking distance of lots of cute bars and shops. A bit removed from the downtown area but accessible enough to be very convenient (I was able to walk downtown). The apartment was stocked with an iron and an umbrella which both came in very handy. Nice and cozy space, lots of room for my luggage etc. I has a scheduling mixup and wound up needing to alter the dates of my reservation a bit and he was super prompt and accommodating. "
9533648,56220408,2015-12-10,10088797,Jeff,Clean and comfortable basic apartment.  The hosts were very attentive to my needs and very accomodating of my schedule.
9533648,56871328,2015-12-19,50258374,Agnes,"Andrew was a great host- he was really flexible about the check in and out time, and left a bottle of wine and a six pack of a local IPA in the fridge for me. The location was great- 20/25 minute walk to downtown seattle and close to a supermarket, cafes and restaurants. The room was cozy and had the necessities for the week I was there. Only drawback is that the room is underground and the windows get very little sunlight, even during the daytime. I wasn't there during the day so it really wasn't a problem, but it made it hard to wake up with almost no natural lighting. "
9533648,57233997,2015-12-23,3090962,Zixian,The studio is cozy and nice with everything we need. Host is pretty helpful and responsive. The neighborhood is nice and has many good restaurants and bars. I had a good time here. 
9533648,58351811,2016-01-02,46676845,Kristy,"Me and my boyfriend stayed at Andrew's apartment for 10 nights and it was extremely cozy. It was in a very prime location for good restaurants and bars of capital hill. He had everything ready for us and whenever we had any questions his response was very quick. I would definitely recommend this Airbnb apartment to anyone looking to stay in Seattle. Extremely convenient, comfortable and the communication was very strong. "
1494828,6901543,2013-08-29,7594187,Christine,"We absolutely LOVED our stay!  The accommodations were NEW and very fresh and inviting.  This was WAY better than staying in a hotel.  We entertained twice for dinner and everyone just loved the condo.  It is very well equipped for kitchen and bath purposes and we had plenty of seating for our dinner guests.  The pictures do not do the condo justice. The location was most convenient for our travels between downtown and the Lynnwood area.  Very easy to walk to places to eat and or pick up items needed down the hill near Lake Union.

This was our first experience with Airbnb and we will definitely book again, we may even try to reserve this Cool and Convenient Eastlake condo next time to Seattle.  William was very easy in our correspondence and very timely in his reply's.  Our key was mailed to our home before our departure.  It was all very smooth and uncomplicated. "
1494828,7042541,2013-09-04,1873662,Jeni,"We loved our stay at William's apartment in Eastlake.  His apartment is spotless with really nice appliances and amenities.  There is a lot of fresh air and natural light coming into the place making it so relaxing.  Shelves, dressers and closets are empty making it easy to feel at home.  For those that enjoy starting the day with a run, the water can be reached in a matter of minutes. William himself was a great host and responded to our inquiries right away.  Eastlake is north of the northern part of Capital Hill, off the 5 freeway.  We enjoyed the easy access to the 5 fwy and our views of the water and Space Needle.  It's nice knowing that we always have a place to come back to in Seattle."
1494828,7173474,2013-09-09,8284104,Jill,"First of all, William was very easy to communicate with and always responded very quickly.  The unit was clean, comfortable and looked exactly as pictured.  Everything that we needed for our stay (toilletries, dishes etc) was already there.  Excellent location and the great views were an extra bonus! Would definitely stay again!"
1494828,7373873,2013-09-17,3955029,Stephanie + Christian,"It was a pleasure to stay at Williams apartment! We totally can recommend it. Everything was spotless clean and me and my family felt very comfortable throughout the whole time. Everything we needed was there: from the salt and oil for cooking, coffee for breakfast, soap and shampoo, washing machine and iron... you name it! Communication was easy, the instructions given were easy to understand. Public transport and supermarkets are just around the corner. We would come back again."
1494828,7467802,2013-09-21,4298025,Brian,Great place. Comfortable and elegant. Ideal location to walk to restaurants and south lake union. Host is very gracious. Nothing but positive things to say. 
1494828,7714804,2013-09-30,7351448,Johanna,"Great apartment! Very clean, well appointed, there was everything one could need and more, convenient loccation (only a couple of minutes to the express bus downtown) with nice coffe shops, bakery and wine store near by. All in all a great place!"
1494828,8178793,2013-10-19,1691432,Daniel,"We had a great stay at William's apartment. The apartment itself is located within a small (but plenty large) apartment building on the corner. The location's access to I-5 was great although sometime traffic built up along the road of the apartment making backing out of the driveway a bit of a challenge at time. All in all, not a huge deal though. The quick access to I-5 which we used frequently was convenient.

The apartment unit itself it large with an open kitchen overlooking the living room. We had access to a balcony as well which made it nice to step out for some fresh air etc. The two bedrooms were plenty large enough for our group as well.

The only one situation we had was with some work that was scheduled during our stay. The carpeting int he hallway was being replaced when we were there and it made for quite a loud late morning. They were never there early enough to wake us up but as we were getting ready for the day it did become quite loud with the banging. The workers were parked in the limited driveway as well and the rugs were cut up and throw about. To be fair this isn't likely to be a recurring situation and for anyone staying at this spot in the future, new carpet in the hallway is a plus!!

All together a great experience. We didn't hang out in the immediate area but everything is just a couple-minute drive and cabs are inexpensive. I would certainly recommend this place to anyone looking to stay in/around the Capitol Hill area with easy access to all other neighborhoods in Seattle."
1494828,8298433,2013-10-24,3475663,Colton,Our stay in Seattle was fantastic. William and his family were very great to coordinate their beautiful apartment with us. We had a bit of a mishap with the internet (Comcast was to blame for that) all in all a great stay. Would do it again in a heartbeat!
1494828,8673347,2013-11-11,9744312,David,"We absolutely loved our stay in Seattle. William is an excellent host and the apartment was spotless when we arrived. The apartment is newly renovated with a brand new kitchen, dishwasher, washer/dryer and fully loaded with appliances. Living room overlooks part of lake and downtown. Very nice TV well equipped with DVR recording! Bedrooms are quaint and comfortable. Very easy to travel from this spot to downtown, medical center or university via car or public transit. William gives great recommendations and easy instructions. Would recommend to an friend or family. If back in Seattle will definitely use again!   "
1494828,8875968,2013-11-23,9679146,Anastasiya,"The apartment is very clean and comfortable.
William is an excellent host!
"
1494828,9185883,2013-12-11,10374941,Martin,"William was quick to respond and easy to communicate with.  The apartment was clean, easy to find, and the surrounding area had plenty of food and coffee shops to keep us happy.  I would certainly stay there again and recommend it to our friends. "
1494828,9286428,2013-12-18,2595470,Blair,"Pretty much a perfect stay from the time we checked in to leaving.  The house was extremely clean (and I am am SUPER anal about cleanliness), they have everything you would need for light cooking (even stocked with coffee, olive oil, vinegar, sugar for coffee, etc), shampoo and conditioner, hair dryer, seriously everything.  Totally beats a hotel!  William was extremely easy to contact if needed.  Location is absolutely perfect.  Hop on I5 in less than a minute and downtown in 5. Bus runs just a few blocks away.  Really enjoyed our stay at William's!  Thanks! "
1494828,9370455,2013-12-24,6291238,Forrest,"This space actually looks better than the pictures (Which is hard to believe!). Very convenient location (10ish minutes to downtown, Ballard, the University, etc), great apartment AND there was fresh coffee to grind for the mornings! 

I can say without a doubt that if/when I return to Seattle, I will come back to this apartment. "
1494828,9876939,2014-01-16,10621630,Garrett,"Everything about our stay in William's apartment was perfect. The place looks exactly like the pictures, which was a huge relief since this was our first Airbnb booking. The modern decor, the fully-featured kitchen... the washer/dryer was a lifesaver since we were traveling with our 1 year-old. The location is excellent—being in Eastlake puts you about 5 minutes from downtown, Queen Anne, University District. Just about everywhere is 5 minutes away.

If you're worried about being close to I-5 noise-wise, don't be—the two bedrooms are on the I-5 side but both have double storm windows so you can't hear any road noise. And the other side of the apartment faces out to the lake and has a very lovely view, especially from the balcony.

The whole apartment was comfortable and so relaxing to hang out in. Our kiddo loved the open layout of the living room / kitchen and I loved having fast WiFi and a nice big flatscreen so I could stream Netflix in the evenings.

William was on top of everything and the place was a complete and total winner. Terrific first experience with Airbnb, and we'll definitely stay again the next time we're in Seattle. Couldn't recommend it higher."
1494828,9928055,2014-01-20,8384576,Joan,"Spacious, beautifully appointed apartment. Location is excellent. Access to I-5 was almost instant and so we got around Seattle with ease. William's hosting is very professional. His tips on restaurants and things to do was so helpful. We visited the Dale Chihuly Glass Garden and Museum. It was the highlight of our stay and we wouldn't have know about it without William's info sheet. Loved the coffee grinder and beans left for us. Overall, enjoyed the whole experience. When we had trouble with the lockbox, William's daughter came down from upstairs and helped us.  That was a nice touch. To get the front of the lockbox back in place (after removing the key), you have to key in the combination FIRST and then place the box front in the slots to lock it in place."
1494828,10133759,2014-02-02,2830624,Bill,This apartment is exactly as advertised.  Awesome!  The location is great with several very good restaurants within a couple of blocks.  Parking was available and convenient  The apartment had everything we needed and it was super clean.  William was a terrific host and very helpful to us during our stay.  Can't wait to come back for another visit.  Bill K
1494828,10560447,2014-02-24,12401118,Nicole,"William was so nice and very responsive!  The place looks exactly like the pictures.  It is clean like a hotel, but comfortable like a home. You can walk to restaurants, coffee shops or down to Lake Union.  A wonderful experience all around!"
1494828,10608686,2014-02-27,1602024,Oliver,The apartment was great. I was surprised how nice the view of downtown and the Space Needle was. Very nice!! Super easy access off/on the freeway. Apartment was spotless and clean cut. Incredible TV/Stereo system. We had a great time. Thanks so much--Oliver
1494828,10674771,2014-03-03,10106702,Heidi,"William was very easy to communicate with and his apartment was beautiful, pristine and well-located!  We will definitely stay there again when we visit Seattle next time. "
1494828,10786872,2014-03-07,12600858,Lars,"We really liked this apartment. It was clean quiet and has a nice neighborhood.
William and his daughter were perfect hosts.
We’d love to stay there again. 
"
1494828,11017138,2014-03-17,10832464,Leeanna,"This apt was by far the cleanest apt I've ever stayed in. Even cleaner than all the hotels I've stayed at. It is exactly how it looks in the photos. Huge space. Great view of the space needle. It's by the highway but you can't hear it. It's actually nice to be so close to the highway since it only takes 5 mins to get downtown or Capital hill. It may smell like smoke upon entering the building but the apt itself does not. Wifi was flawless. As was getting the keys. William was also an amazing host, he even responded back to me in the wee hours on a weekend. We didn't have a car but it was good to know parking was included. Would gladly stay here again. "
1494828,11247843,2014-03-26,12234840,Chris,"real awesome place, great location, very professional host, I can say more great things about it but then it will be fully booked out months in advance the next time I need a place to stay in Seattle, a great place to stay"
1494828,11426876,2014-04-02,407163,Carroll,Fabulous apartment in a wonderful location.  All round an A++.  
1494828,12328545,2014-04-29,3277083,Joseph,"We very much enjoyed our stay! The apartment is beautiful, clean, well-equipped, and centrally located. William was a pleasure to work with. The instructions were thorough for all aspects of our stay. When back in Seattle, we will certainly stay here again. "
1494828,12767397,2014-05-10,9148447,Jeff,"A truly terrific experience.  The space was immaculately clean, comfortable, great location near some terrific restaurants like Blind Pig Bistro and Serafina and there was even parking (in a neighborhood not known for this.)  This is somewhere we'd definitely stay again."
1494828,13081941,2014-05-19,5607059,Patrick,"The location was ideal with an amazing view of the Space Needle.  The apartment was terrific, with great appliances, a comfortable couch, and large closets.  This apartment has pretty much everything you could want in terms of location, space, amenities and comfort.  Plus, it's just a block away from some nice bars and shops, and a few minutes by cab to downtown.  I would highly recommend staying here!"
1494828,14261315,2014-06-16,11399508,Jennifer,"This rental was exactly as described on previous reviews. It's very clean and greatly furnished. Bathroom was clean with several towels to use. Kitchen was stocked with nice appliances, dishware and cookware. Bedrooms are smaller than expected but cozy and perfect for 4 people. While it is close to the highway, the windows are double paned and the rooms are very quiet. The television set and cable are very nice and full of great channels. Lastly the view from the terrace is great. Parking on the property was not an issue and a permit for off property parking were also provided. "
1494828,14728678,2014-06-25,2923049,Johanna,"William was really helpful and nice host! The apartment was super clean and nicely furnished. Me, my husband and my friends enjoyed our stay and slept well. Would definitely stay here again!"
1494828,15142974,2014-07-03,13169078,Kerry,"In dealing with William prior to our trip, I was confident that I we would be staying in a well managed, well presented place.  This apartment is ideal for travellers - there is room to spread out (sure beats hotel rooms!) and the location is excellent - easy to walk locally and to parks and great access to public transport.  Seattle is a gorgeous city - relaxed and the people and friendly - far less frantic than the big cities. Highly recommend a visit and, when you do, stay here in Eastlake!
"
1494828,15446713,2014-07-09,14420028,Jordan,"William's apartment was amazing. Very comfortable, super clean, and well located in Seattle. We were very comfortable there and would rent from him again.  Highly recommend staying here. "
1494828,15996455,2014-07-20,10922083,Raunak,Stay was awesome!! William is a great host - he was accomodating to our request for an early check-in. The apartment (East Lynn St) is beautiful and very  well-maintained and the location is ideal. Would definitely recommend it without any reservations!
1494828,16708412,2014-08-01,1822055,Nancy,"William's apartment was perfect! Just fantastic! It was a beautiful, spotless, fully furnished and everything my sister and I could have hoped for and more. It's located right off the 5 freeway, so getting down to Pike's Place Market, to downtown, to Safeco Stadium was a breeze. The neighborhood is quiet and safe. Check-in and Checkout were easy, and William e-mailed me thorough instructions for both. The parking onsite is limited to first come first serve, and street parking can be tight if you arrive late at night. No elevator in the building, and it's a short walk upstairs to the second floor. There is air-conditioning in the unit, and a balcony. Beds are comfortable, empty closets have plenty of space and wooden hangers, towels were fluffy and soft, fridge had filtered water and ice-maker. I would definitely stay here again and highly recommend it to anyone visiting Seattle."
1494828,16882051,2014-08-04,625595,Emily,This place was amazing! It was a surprisingly warm weekend in Seattle and the A/C was a lifesaver. A perfect spot close to everywhere we wanted to go! Very clean and comfortable. Slept like a baby in the memory foam bed. Great find!
1494828,17261572,2014-08-10,12903866,Frances,"The apartment is lovely and very modern. It included all the amenities we needed for a stay in Seattle. It is very close to transportation and downtown so getting around was easy for us. Unfortunately, my family and I were scheduled to stay from the 5th thru the 9th of August but were only able to enjoy the apartment for two nights due to William mistakenly double booking. It was a huge inconvenience finding out two days prior to checking in. William was very apologetic and made several attempts to book us in another location for our trip, but was unable due to the lack of availability. We ultimately stayed those two nights in his daughter's top floor apartment, which was not as nice, temperately cool, or had the amenities as the promised apartment. William did go out of his way to make it as smooth a transition as possible by moving our luggage from one apartment to the other so we would not have to change our plans. Aside from this, William ensured we were well accommodated in both apartments, offered his assistance in anything we may need, even went as far as printing out some tickets we needed since we had no availability to a printer and dropped it off to us. He ultimately discounted us those two nights for our inconvenience. Would it had not been for this issue, I'm sure this stay would have been our most pleasant. Thank you William for helping us out in everything possible!"
1494828,17673976,2014-08-16,14907410,Thomas,The apartment was clean and spacious and the appliances were modern.  The location was convenient and quiet and parking was available on the property despite the fact that we didn't use our car much.  Our host also provided us with useful information about the neighborhood and the city.  I would recommend this apartment to other Seattle visitors!
1494828,18161919,2014-08-23,91423,Janet,"This is the best airbnb property we have ever stayed in! The apartment is beautiful, spacious and immaculate. The beds are very comfortable and the apartment has everything you need. It has the added benefit of not being anyone's home, so you don't feel like you're living in someone else's space. It's also easy to get to Seattle's attractions from William's place. Communication with William was easy and immediate; he was an excellent host! He left us a lot of information about things to do in Seattle and in the immediate neighborhood. We tried some of his suggestions--Serafina, Blind Pig Bistro, 14 Carrots Cafe and Vox Coffee--and found them all to be really excellent. We really loved our stay and can recommend this listing without reservation! Thanks, William!"
1494828,18528531,2014-08-28,15741346,Scott,"We loved staying in William's apartment during our vacation to Seattle. It is comfortable and conveniently located, with lake and Space Needle views from the balcony. The apartment was tastefully decorated, and equipped with everything we needed and then some. William was gracious and responsive, and provided clear and simple check-in, check-out, and parking info, along with some helpful orientation to the neighborhood and the city. We would definitely stay here again!"
1494828,19263087,2014-09-09,5603975,Corri,"This is the second time staying in a ""William""  accomodation.  I won't stay anywhere else when in Seattle.  I found my home away from home.  The accomodations are second to none and his hospitality surpasses everyone's expectations.  My son is now a part of Seattle because of his years at UW....andI now travel from the East and know I am home too especially staying at such a special apartment.

The apartment and location are phenominal.  Eastlake is the place to be adjacent to the UDistrict and to the City.  We have made it a tradition already to eat at 14 Carrot and Louisa's for breakfast and have dinner on the Lake at EastLake Grill.  We have made friends while walking along the water seeing the houseboats and bumping into neighbors with dogs and/or gardens.  

Whether staying in the 1 bedroom downstairs or this 2 bedroom the decor and amenities abound.  The apartments lack of nothing from shampoo to pot holders to 3d TV!  From the apartment everything is central yet not overwhelming like the UDistrict.  1.5 miles seems like a world away.

We ate out alot but were able to make a full 4 course meal with what William provides in the kitchen.  We also rented a movie and were completely comfortable snuggling up in the LR.  As a testiment to our happiness, my mom (70 years old) felt so at home she took a bubble bath every night in the tub, learned to love the innovation of the washer/dryer-in-one technology, and embraced what IKEA has to offer.  She didn't believe that William would supply the basics so she doubled up on toiletries and brought her hair dryer.  She even doubted the number of hangers in the closet as she always needed more before and he couldn't have a respectable iron for her pants.  Again she was wrong.....I loved saying ""I told you so"" because the closets had lots of hangers and a proper iron.  She is a William and Airbnb convert! 

I hesitate to share my secret hideaway and my home away from home as it has become but have to always rave about William's apartments and his personal touch.  I am so lucky to have made Seattle my second home because of my son but really its my second home because of William.

1494828,19483642,2014-09-13,20397384,Alicia,This place was fantastic.  It was a convenient location for me as I was moving my daughter back to school.  Everything was perfect!  Having the full kitchen was a huge plus.  I will definitely be back!
1494828,19676375,2014-09-16,16018031,Heather,"William Graf’s two-bedroom condo in Eastlake is extremely comfortable and clean. The space worked well for the three of us adults who stayed there. Despite being close the highway, the unit is very quiet. It’s close to the bus, near the water and in a walkable neighborhood with good coffee. The beds are firm and comfortable. The unit is freshly renovated and nicely done. Another guest said that this may be the best airbnb she has stayed in—and I can see why! It’s a great find. "
1494828,20644089,2014-10-03,14863044,Pierre,"Really love our experience at William's appartement. We found the  place exactly has seen and felt like being home. The location is great, about 10 min from downtown and the neighborhood is quiet and secure. We were a group of 4 and we were very comfortable, with everything we needs to accomodate us. 
I would recommand William place to anyone who would like to spend some time in Seattle. 
Best regards
Pierre"
1494828,20999183,2014-10-09,9043383,Jiana,"Very nice apartment, looks quite new furnished. You can find what you want there. Would like to choose this via next visit."
1494828,22584055,2014-11-10,568376,Nicholas,Lovely large apartment exactly as described. The door entry system made it easy to let ourselves in and accommodated our midnight arrival. The apartment was very clean and felt like it has been recently renovated. There is even a view of the Space Needle from the balcony! 
1494828,23903995,2014-12-14,5849593,Frankie,"Excellent location with neighborhood cafes and restaurants. Near downtown, Capitol Hill, and bus stops. Easy access to freeways. Easy parking.

Apartment looks exactly like images. Modern decor, clean, quiet and convenient. Host was attentitive and welcoming. Highest remmendation for this place."
1494828,24354797,2014-12-27,7606508,Tim,"Somehow my first review disappeared into the ether, it seems. It was a good one, though, so here it is again. This is a great condo within two blocks of several good restaurants and coffee shops, and less than five minutes from downtown (or 35 minutes on foot). The unit is super clean, very nice, and communication with William was effortless. From the living room window you have a great view of the Space Needle, Queen Anne Hill, and planes landing in Lake Union. Great rental!"
1494828,24551543,2014-12-30,24529861,Lisa,"William's Seattle apartment was my first Airbnb experience and I must say it was more than I expected! The space had everything my 3 friends and I needed, yet still had a minimalist touch. I'm a bit of a clean freak, and his apartment was very CLEAN! Our email exchange was clear and thorough, everything was amazing. The neighborhood was super cute too. Needless to say, we didn't want to leave! :)"
1494828,24927226,2015-01-04,6031356,Sue,William is a very gracious and responsive host.  He responded to my emails quickly and was most accommodating when I requested an early check in.  The apartment is lovely and well-stocked.  Everything we needed or wanted was there. The view of downtown and the space needle is beautiful - we loved being able to watch the New Year's Eve fireworks at the space needle from the warmth of the apartment.  The apartment is very convenient for walking to restaurants and activities and has easy access to the highway for further away access.  It is very quiet even though it is so close to the highway.  This will definitely be our go-to place whenever we come to Seattle to visit our daughter and son-in-law.
1494828,25591961,2015-01-20,363945,Sarah,"Staying at William's East Lake apartment was amazing! The apartment was very clean and had everything I could need- dishwasher and washer/dryer with detergent, all the kitchen utensils, etc. I stayed for a week so it was really nice to have those things. East Lake is a GREAT neighborhood in Seattle, and a wonderful place to come home to after exploring all the great city has to offer. The balcony with view of Lake Union and the space needle was also a plus! Although I never met William, his instructions for getting into the apartment were clear, and I had no problems with anything. I would highly recommend this apartment, I hope to be back soon!"
1494828,26048007,2015-02-02,3899557,Marte,"Nice and quiet area. The appartment was super clean and exactely as beautiful as in the pictures. Spacious for the 4 of us staying. William had sent us information about places to eat and things to do in the area, wich was very nice. We absolutely loved the place and would recomende it to other people. Could not have been any better!"
1494828,26792135,2015-02-19,12843862,Jillian,"William's location was exactly how it was described, it was clean, welcoming and beautifully decorated. It was the perfect place to stay for a few days in Seattle and we'd highly recommend his location for your stay in Seattle. "
1494828,26935989,2015-02-22,381107,Meredith,"Great location, easy to get to many parts of town quickly, made for an excellent home base for our girls' weekend! Good coffee shop and sushi restaurant within walking distance. Super clean and comfortable. Extremely quiet even though it is very close to the highway."
1494828,27325967,2015-03-02,25969077,Alex,Wonderful! Peaceful and refreshing. The apartment was exactly what I wanted.
1494828,27880101,2015-03-14,26446765,Marissa,This apartment was EXACTLY what we needed for our trip. My husband and I traveled with two friends to Seattle and this was perfect. The apartment is located pretty centrally to everything with nothing being a far walk (I walk everywhere though) or when using Lyft. The neighborhood is beautiful and quiet. William was helpful from the get go and accessible when we had questions. Highly recommend staying here. I would again.
1494828,28163723,2015-03-19,12540432,Chris,"The apartment is exactly as described.  Its clean, quite and makes for a very enjoyable stay."
1494828,28560382,2015-03-26,12683352,Shutian,"Thanks William! This apartment is wonderful and is more than what we expected for. All things are prepared well for us; he sent me an email to tell us things around this apartment and things in Seattle before we arrived. His apartment is really clean and refreshing, and its location is also good for us. I'd highly recommend it."
1494828,29047297,2015-04-03,1478370,Walter,"Beautiful, spacious, well-appointed apartment close to everything one needs to survive in a foreign city. Coffee, restaurants, public transit, and the VIEW!! William was super forthright and communicative from the get go, and was delightfully helpful when I had to leave Seattle earlier than my original checkout date. 

Bottom line, I hope this place is available next time I go to Seattle. It is perfect. "
1494828,29500568,2015-04-08,342794,Harriet,"I stayed here April - 2 moms & 2 teenagers visiting Seattle colleges. I've only stayed in downtown before and I have to say I LOVED this neighborhood. I was a little wary when we arrived because the building is literally next to the freeway. That said we had absolutely no issues with noise. The unit is beautiful, with a view of the lake. It is so well designed, I kept wanting to take photos of decorative details. I felt like I was given the keys to a very cool graphic designer's home. It was EXTREMELY clean. We didn't use the kitchen, but it is very well appointed. I could have made a feast here!!! And there's room for 6 at the dining table. As far as the neighborhood, it's a short walk to great restaurants & coffee and there is an enclave of the most charming house boats, ""floating houses,"" close by. We had a car, but often chose to use public transept which was a breeze from this location. This was a fantastic place to stay. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!"
1494828,31056659,2015-05-01,30109414,Greg,"The apartment is beautiful, with a modern, almost European feel to it.  All around nice new appliances and fixtures.   Everything was superb except for the washer/dryer which takes forever and didn't really dry.  The beds are comfortable with down blankets.    Location is convenient and close to a bus stop and a couple good places to eat (Pazzos and 14 Carrot Cafe).  Coded entry and key keepers make it convenient to arrive and depart.

William the host was available and helpful.  At one point I had an issue with the wifi but William was immediately available and helped resolve the problem quickly.   

All in all a great experience.  I'd highly recommend staying here.  
"
1494828,32586480,2015-05-19,10720548,Ryan,"Thanks, William!  Fantastic apartment that served as a great home base as we explored around Seattle.  Easy access in and out, parking worked out great.  Having a full functioning apartment for the stay made the trip a breeze.  Despite being right next to the freeway, it was an incredibly quiet and peaceful stay.  Starbucks and other food stops 2 blocks away within walking distance.

Highly recommended and look forward to having the chance to stay here again!"
1494828,35082872,2015-06-15,1150464,New,"We stayed in this absolutely beautiful, super clean and perfectly located apartment in Eastlake on our recent trip to Seattle for our daughter's college graduation. The apartment is exactly as shown and described on the site.  The beds are very comfortable to sleep in and the bathroom and kitchen impeccably clean!!  William (the host) was very organized and provided us with all the instructions and information we needed to know during our stay. He was prompt to respond any questions we had before and during our travel making us feel very at ease. Without hesitation, I highly recommend this property and this great host!!"
1494828,35764052,2015-06-22,1706310,Oliver,"I visited Seattle with my dad as we had tickets for the US Open Golf at Chambers Bay. 

It was a real pleasure staying in Williams place, it was perfect for so many reasons. The neighbourhood is lovely, a selection of restaurants, cafe's, coffee houses and a few local bars were within a few hundred yards - all very local and quiet.

Downtown is a couple of miles away, we walked to and from downtown on a daily basis - there was a bus that went from the end of the street but the weather was perfect and we were happy to exercise.

William was great, from the moment I booked the communication was spot on. We were provided with a list of local favourites, all of which were lovely (Louisa's for breakfast, Bling Pig & Serafina for evening meals) as well as easy instructions for arrival and departure. The apartment was exactly what we needed, comfy, bright and exactly as per the description and photo's.

If you're going to Seattle don't look any further, Great host, great apartment, great location - if we return I will certainly be contacting William."
1494828,36209198,2015-06-26,34931389,Sandra,William's home was beautiful. It is perfectly pictured in the photos provided. The apartment was clean and well equipped with absolutely everything one needs (AND MORE!) for a vacation. Apartment is close to popular attractions approximately 10 minutes away from Pike Place. I will be staying here every time I come back to Seattle if possible! 
1494828,36509178,2015-06-29,28784942,Jenni,"Loved the apartment, very cozy and perfect size. William was very accommodating and answered any questions or concerns I had. One of my friends had a very early flight in and was able to drop his bags off a bit earlier, that was very much appreciated. I had no problems getting in or out of the apartment. The neighbourhood was nice, I spent more time downtown and around the market so I didn't get a chance to really check it out. Had a bit of trouble keeping the apartment cool even with the air conditioning, but Seattle was going through a pretty heavy heat wave at the time. It was a close drive to the market, maybe 10 min, which was awesome as well. All in all I had a great stay and would definitely reccomend this place to anyone travelling to Seattle! "
1494828,38094356,2015-07-13,4585316,Michael,"We were in Seattle for the first time and found Williams apartment a very convenient and good choice. The neighborhood is nice, distances to city centre and other attractive areas of Seattle are short, Union lake just a few blocks away, you even see the Space Needle from the balcony (o.k. we were first timers and very receptive to tourist attraction:-). It was a very enjoyable stay. Everything was found as described, we were enthusiastic about the condition, equipment (fantastic, you find everything you need, very convenient), layout of the condo. Communication with William was pleasantly easy. We definitely can recommend a stay in Williams apartment to other travelers. "
1494828,38512662,2015-07-16,10719412,Nathan,The apartment was everything as advertised and more.  This was one of the cleanest air bnb's I've ever stayed at.  Would recommend to anyone.   Thanks for the hospitality William. 
1494828,38986380,2015-07-20,7905061,Jake,"William's place was modern and well-furnished. The beds were very comfortable. There's also a nice deck you can relax on. You can see the lake and Space Needle in the distance.

The location was very convenient and literally one exit away from Pike Place. There was also a convenient store down the street, within walking distance.

I would definitely stay here again."

1494828,40324772,2015-07-30,33989155,Audrey,"This was our first Airbnb stay and I hope our future locations are as good. The apartment is clean, airy and air-conditioned. The beds are very comfortable and the kitchen has everything you need. The location allowed us to get around Seattle by bus and bike very easily, and we are within walking distance to several great breakfast and dinner restaurants on Eastlake Ave. We would definitely stay here again."

The apartment was clean and located close to stadiums and tourist attractions.(under 5 miles) There were local restaurants and a coffee shop within walking distance. Parking for 1 vehicle was on site and not a problem during our stay. The beds were super comfy. We had a great time! 
1494828,43030347,2015-08-17,19870245,Jenny,"The apartment was excellent. Light, good size and the kitchen was really well set up with everything needed to cook meals."
1494828,44407266,2015-08-26,5581384,Kristin,What a wonderful place!!!! Location is perfect and we even got a view of the space needle from the balcony. 
1494828,45562082,2015-09-04,16794568,Sanby,"Loved my stay here! The apartment was spotlessly clean and nicely decorated, looks exactly like in the pictures. The beds are VERY comfortable. The neighborhood is quiet and in a good location. William also sent very detailed instructions on how to get in and out, which was appreciated. Would definitely recommend!"
1494828,46724743,2015-09-13,7922406,Sarah,The listing was accurate and the place was easy to find. I loved the red door.
1494828,48705979,2015-09-28,20674847,Meagan,"We loved this place! It was just like it was described. The location is ideal- near the 5, close to downtown, and the view on the balcony of Lake Union and the Space Needle was something I could get used to. The beds were comfortable and the decor is beautiful. I would definitely stay here again! Everything was easy, accessible, and clean!"
1494828,49465148,2015-10-04,37051887,Amal,"William was a great host, very welcoming and helpful. His home was beautiful, very clean and tidy and the perfect base to explore Seattle from. Would highly recommend it. "
1494828,50627282,2015-10-13,23317980,Paul,We had a great stay in this condo. The condo is just as pictured and better. Beds are comfortable and bedrooms are quiet. The balcony offers great views of the Eastlake neighborhood -- we also enjoyed the views of the space needle and Lake Union. There are lots of windows that let in the light. The unit is equipped with everything one needs to have a relaxing and comfortable stay. This was one of the best AirBnB experiences so far. 
1494828,51818799,2015-10-24,42522500,Qiao,William's place is definitely a treat to our Seattle trip. He apartment could only be better than the what the pictures show. It's very clean and very convenient to places.  
1494828,52553006,2015-10-30,8918682,George,Our stay in Eastlake was great.  The condo had everything that you would need for a longer visit. William was easy to communicate with and quickly replied to any requests.  
1494828,55363468,2015-12-01,3261907,Wilson,"Clean, comfortable, and in within casual walking distance (2 blocks) of a convenience store, great coffee shop, playground, and awesome brunch spot! This was the perfect amount of space for our family (parents + a toddler) for a week's visit to Seattle. The apartment looks exactly like the photos in the listing - just a super cool modern space. We are already planning to stay here again!"
1494828,55894026,2015-12-07,18665305,Anngelica,"This was the best airbnb experiences I have ever had, yet the first one I have booked personally myself.  William was extremely prompt with his response and provided a long list of recommendations. The apartment is exactly as it looks like in the pictures, spacious and modern and it also has a great view on the patio. I will definitely be coming back to Seattle! Thank you William  "
6852288,38033340,2015-07-12,10981218,Rachel,"Helena has a lovely space, with a beautiful view of Seattle from her living room. We had most of the basics available, although we didn't get much information from our host about amenities we could access. It was a little strange that we never got to meet Helena during our three days there, but that's the nature of how Airbnb can work."
6852288,38524054,2015-07-16,32114995,Elisabeth,"The apartment's Capitol Hill location and view of downtown Seattle cannot be beat. The bedroom was a good size and the bed comfortable, though the bathroom was just a little dingy (the hazard of an older building, I think). Helena was super responsive prior to our arrival and was friendly when we met her briefly the first night. Unfortunately, we kept different hours and were awoken a few of the nights by people coming into the apartment. That said, if you are planning on being out and about during much of the day (and later into the night than we were) it's a fine spot for the price. "
6852288,39104066,2015-07-20,32080149,Nikki,"The location — right in the Capitol Hill neighborhood across from delicious Top Pot donuts, two great bars and bike share station— was perfect. Epic view of the Space Needle and dramatic sunsets. Very comfortable bed. While Seattle can be pretty hot in the summer (and the apartment does not have AC) the room has a window that adds a nice breeze and keeps the room cool. We did not get to meet Helena; however, she was very responsive to our messages and we had no problem accessing the apartment. "
6852288,39569596,2015-07-24,4526506,Dave,"Helena was a perfect hostess. She made sure I had a desk to work at. Everything was provided. Even in the middle of a heat wave, her place was comfortable. Thanks so much!"
6852288,40123997,2015-07-28,15608667,Dana,"My friend and I stayed at Helena's apartment while we were in town for a music festival. Helena was not actually there, but her friend was staying at the apartment during our stay. The area was super convenient to everything we needed (there's a couple of bars, a restaurant, and a Top Pot donut across the street. Using public transportation was also very easy. The apartment is charming and the bed is extremely comfortable after spending a day exploring by foot. Helena gave great instructions before I arrived and was very helpful!"
6852288,41150267,2015-08-04,1571627,Warwick,"Helenas place was in a brilliant location in quiet spot, but close to all the action in Capitol Hill. The check in was smooth and the place was clean. Thanks! "
6852288,41966774,2015-08-10,15389103,Thomas,Great place!  Clean and comfortable and Helena was welcoming and friendly.
6852288,46129741,2015-09-08,19500006,Andrew,Helena was a great host. Very attentive and communicative! I'd definitely stay with her again. The location was great for me; an easy walk downtown and plenty of access to public transit and nightlife. 
6852288,46964473,2015-09-14,26438904,Esther,"For the location, the price simply can't be beat.  An easy walk to downtown Seattle, or a cheap Uber/Lyft/cab ride, Capital Hill is a great place to be, for both tourism and nightlife.  The host didn't  hover over us, was very flexible with our arrival and departure times, and allowed us privacy.  The room itself is small but clean, with room in the closet for storage.  The shared bathroom could use a scrubbing, but at this price point and location, its hard to complain."
6852288,48763270,2015-09-28,8194600,Dan,"Helena's place is super well located, I was able to walk to literally everything I wanted to get to in Seattle. Check in and check out was flexible and convenient. The building is very very quiet, comfortable and clean."
6852288,49189612,2015-10-01,14127150,Caspian,"Good communication. Nice place with an amazing view. Great location with neighborhood market, bar, coffee shop all a few steps away. Great neighborhood to capture the character of Seattle. Also there's a bike share pod on the street, which is a great option for cruising around the city. The price reflects the quality of the place. I would stay here again. Only thing that was inconvenient was that my flight left in the evening and I could not leave my bags there on the day of check out. I guess it's ok because this is not a hotel, but it's definitely something to be aware of. "
6852288,50704551,2015-10-13,40748109,Katie-Ann,"
Helena was very helpful on my stay in Seattle. Her apartment is very comfortable, with a great view of the city. Location is fantastic, so easy to get anywhere in the city, and a great place to stay locally. "
6852288,51368072,2015-10-19,31372953,Deb,Helena had everything arranged to make my check in easy.  She kept in contact to make sure everything went as planned
6852288,55600988,2015-12-02,3932769,Kimberly,The host canceled this reservation 22 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
7513198,42738684,2015-08-15,12560705,Daniel,"Ryan’s place is amazing. The view of Lake Union and Downtown really is spectacular ~ honestly the photos don't do it justice. 

The condo is spacious, stylish, immaculately clean, and very comfortable. 

The location was very special.. just a quick walk down to the Lake, or over to upper Queen Anne where theres a lots of great restaurants, bars and cafes to explore. Its a really interesting vantage to explore Seattle, very convenient to get around with a quick Uber ride.

Ryan is a great host ~ responsive, thoughtful, and super cool guy. He was very accommodating around check-in, and made all the details effortless. 

I would definitely stay again, and highly recommend!

It  is the perfect place to stay, when visiting Seattle!
The view is stunning by day and night! 
The house is very welcoming, comfortable and well equipped.
Internet is fast and the TV great.
Booking and handling was smooth and easy, and Daniel is very caring.
We really enjoyed our stay ,and  can highly recommend it.
Thank you Daniel, all the best!

426089,1466064,2012-06-12,2180462,Marcia,"What can I say!  We really enjoyed our stay in West Seattle and the view is incredible.  At nightime the view is even more stunning!  We saw a bald eagle fly within 20 feet of the windows.  The house was clean,  comfortable for relaxing in, and it's a quick walk to the trail around Alki,  and an easy drive into Seattle.

Daniel was a great host!  The house is well supplied.  We had a small luncheon to celebrate my daughter's graduation, and the kitchen was well stocked with bowls, pots and pans.

Consider staying here on your next trip to Seattle.  We will!"
426089,1504643,2012-06-18,1774802,Laurel,Daniel is a great host.  We loved the view and the location.  We enjoyed Alki Beach and West Seattle immensely.  The ferry ride to Seattle was convenient and the piers along the shore were worth checking out.  I would recommend this property to anyone.  We would stay there again.
426089,1767944,2012-07-22,2382422,Daniel,"Beautiful house with a spectacular view!  There was plenty of room for our family, and we wished we could stay longer."
426089,1818019,2012-07-28,2190911,Aenoi,"Wow, what a view from the house. Our family of seven had a grate time. Will book this place again next time we are in Seattle."
426089,1889895,2012-08-05,2232548,Cat,"Pros: Fabulous view! Day & night!
 Two great spacious master  bedrooms! Comfortable queen size beds with sink (only) vanity in the two master bedrooms. Both masters have the same incredible view as the living room.  The 3rd room has only a slightly less perfectly oriented view, and no vanity, but nice nonetheless. The small room with the pair of bunk beds accommodated our two adult women/ children (150 lbs each).
Location: walking distance to waterfront, (approx. 15 min downhill walk with steep uphill return); Salty's restaurant, public transportation, water taxi to Seattle; bicycle & kayak rentals. Great setting for those members of your party who can't  or don't want to leave the house for exploring Seattle. (They can watch the view or the 70 inch TV screen!)

Cons: View might  be absent if Seattle weather rainy  or coudy as it is 10 out of 12 months. Half the view is the beautiful skyline of Seattle/ the other half is the industrial ship yard where cargo is loaded & unloaded.
The two master bedrooms are open to the living room below which might disturb those going to bed early or sleeping late if the rest of the group isnt in sync with them; or if you require  privacy  ;). Also, it could be dangerous if you have a toddler.
A long term renter lives below the main house, but we never saw nor heard him during our week-long stay.
Parking is a little tight getting in & out of the driveway, but will accommodate 4 cars total, including the long-term renters.
We did not meet host Daniel due to his family emergency, but he was very quick to communicate and to meet our needs (we had none.)
Room tax is added on after you make the arrangements to rent the place (surprise) so factor that into your costs.

Must do: Rent bicycles on Alki Beach ($10/hr or $20 for half day) and ride the entire length of the waterfront on the seperate bicycle path, for the most incredible and ever-changing views of Seattle city-scape, water, & island views over the Sound. It is unforgettable and completely flat with these very comfortable & stable beach cruiser bicycles!

426089,1954482,2012-08-12,2249831,Karin,"Daniel is just a great uncomplicated host. The apartment is very spacious and comfortable, the view is breathtaking (real even better than in the photo) and the surrounding area offers everything you could wish for. My sports-minded family has particularly appreciated the proximity to the water, kayaking and stand up paddeling and the Beach."
426089,2051832,2012-08-21,1791622,Vannithamby,"We were late to arrive at the house as planned, but Daniel waited for us patiently  with a big smile.He showed the beautiful house around and utilities. Also allowed us to use the food until we get settled.
On the whole he was  very friendly and helpful.
We felt very homely. All the guests enjoyed the stay.
Thank you Daniel."
426089,2388883,2012-09-24,1334003,Kate,Daniel's house was perfect for our stay in Seattle. It is so convenient to walk down the hill to take the water taxi over to downtown and avoid parking fees and traffic.The house was clean and lovely and very welcoming for our party of eight. We look forward to staying again in the future.  
426089,2915988,2012-11-19,3889311,Christina,It was a wonderful stay and the view was so amazing! We'll never forget our weekend there! :)
426089,2985615,2012-11-28,2841618,Stephen,Great place.  Lots of room.  Comfy beds.  Amazing view of Seattle.  Well equipped kitchen.  All amenities needed for a comfortable stay for families of all ages.  Daniel was flexible for our arrival/departure time and took the time to check-in with us.
426089,3168801,2012-12-28,677243,Arthur,"My family and I stayed at Daniel's place for Christmas week. The house is very spacious, we even had a little gathering with some friends for Christmas Eve, and it didn't fell crowded.

Upon arrival, Daniel was there to greet me and give me the tour of the house, as well as explain the house rules. He was very nice and welcoming. And if you follow the house rules, you won't have issues with check out.

The house is very comfortable and the view is really breathtaking! Whenever my family comes to visit again, we'd probably go for Daniel's place, again!"
426089,3246273,2013-01-03,4169834,James,"Our stay at Daniel's home was nothing short of amazing!  Me and my party of six enjoyed everything about this house from the moment we entered until the time we grudgingly departed!  Daniel was super responsive to all of my inquiries and extremely accommodating.  One other reviewer was dead on when they stated the view was much better in person than in the pictures (the pictures were pretty darn good).  The location was excellent with us being only 10 minutes max to downtown and so close to an amazing safeway, drug store, market, and several restaurants (literally right up the street).  It was a very short stroll down Ferry Street to get to Alki Beach where Salty's Restaurant, water taxi and a recreational rental business was located.  The icing on the cake for us was being able to see and hear so much of the local wildlife, like sea lions, bald eagles, and a number of birds I have never seen anywhere else before.  The place was very well furnished and all three couples were able to enjoy comfy nighttime slumber every single night.  The 70 inch tv made watching football over the weekend spectacular!!!  Daniel, we cant thank you enough.  We will definitely be back to Seattle again and will look to rent your place again for sure.  Absolutely recommend staying here to anyone in the market to rent an awesome home!"
426089,3890998,2013-03-25,5167622,George,"Beautiful view and very convenient location with quick access to downtown, regional highways, and local grocery stores and shopping. Comfortable space for up to two couples and three-four small kids. "
426089,4247758,2013-04-22,792778,Harvi,"Loved the space! It was very spacious and Dan was very understanding when we had an emergency on the day of our departure. The view from the patio is spectacular! A beautiful place and highly recommended staying here if possible, you will love it!  "
426089,5267040,2013-06-21,6852654,Amy,"Daniel's place was amazing!!  I had waited until the last minute to book a place for our trip and this was my first experience with airbnb.  Daniel was responsive and very friendly when we met up at his space.  The house is in a beautiful area of West Seattle with the amazing views that you can see in the pictures here.  New wood flooring throughout.  Open and bright with lots of big windows looking out onto the bay and downtown.  Extremely convenient location for exploring Alki beach and very easy access to downtown by car or water taxi.  We traveled with a family of 6 and all slept very comfortably.  The house was also great for entertaining with ample tables and chairs and a big kitchen.  The deck has a BBQ and what a view!!  My one and only caution is for people with very young children.  The two master bedrooms are open at one end, dropping off to the downstairs with railings that could be dangerous for very young children.  It would be easy to keep them out by simply keeping the doors to these rooms closed, but it was something I worried about with my rambunctious 4 year old.  Other than that I couldn't have been happier.  I would have loved to have stayed a week instead of only 2 days.  The front loading washer and dryer and 2 large bathrooms would have made it an easy week-long stay.  Daniel is sweet and helpful and accommodating.  Can't go wrong with this if you want a quiet home to stay in with a wonderful view in a convenient location, and particularly if you have a larger group.  Thank you, Daniel!
"
426089,5505319,2013-07-03,5199050,Deanna,"Daniel was a great host. He responded to my texts promptly, and he dropped off an extra fan because there was warm weather. (It was unusually warm and there's no AC.) The view was even better than the pictures showed. We had a great visit! The location was great, and the water taxi is very close to get to downtown Seattle."
426089,5746841,2013-07-15,4970483,Ketti,"The location is excellent with a beautiful view.
The house itself is fine and worked well for our needs. It has a very noticeable slant to it and is rather open, leaving very little audio privacy. 2 of the rooms open to  the living room below so you can hear people talking all throughout the house. The railings are also questionable as to their safety. It's not a house I would have felt comfortable in with my small children, but I stayed with a group of adults and it was fine."
426089,7501676,2013-09-23,2673577,Sylvia,Daniel's house is West Seattle has absolutely beautiful views! We really enjoyed the deck and the big windows looking out on the sound.  The house was clean and comfortable for our party of 7.  Daniel was accommodating and quick to respond when we had a question.  We would definitely stay at his house again. 
426089,7694200,2013-09-30,392983,Jason,"Daniel was easy to communicate with, and he was very accommodating.  The place had an amazing view and was extremely comfortable.  "
426089,11088240,2014-03-20,515181,Azhari,"Daniel was quick in responding to our queries, and that was the clincher to the deal!... Although we didn't get to meet, Daniel had always answered the phone quick.

The place itself was great!... It has everything that you need, and all in good working order. 

Oh! and you cant argue with the awesome view!

Would definitely consider coming back to this property the next time we're in town."
426089,21288980,2014-10-14,3319299,Rodolfo,We will definitely be trying to stay here again. The house made us feel at home. Gorgeous view. All appliances were available for us to use. 
426089,22227248,2014-11-02,18328265,Justin,"This is the second time I've been back to this lovely home. I love it. The host Daniel has kept this home in amazing condition and it really shows he cares about the whole experience. The experience is comfortable, a-home-away-from-home, and accommodating."
426089,22825508,2014-11-16,16682257,Mira,"Daniel was very welcoming.  Since our flight was arriving in the morning and check-in was at 4pm, I asked if it was possible to leave our bags there.  Would have understood completely if he said no. But he was cool with it. It really helped us to explore Seattle without lugging our stuff around with us.  I know it would have been very inconvenient for the host because I asked last minute.  If you know you're flight is going to arrive early, please let your hosts know in advance. I just wasn't thinking. And I appreciate Daniel's graciousness all the more.   We loved the place.  Quiet, friendly neighborhood, amazing view, crisp air...exactly what we needed. 
There were 11 total in our group BUT only 7 people stayed in the house.  The two couples stayed in the city but were quite jealous when they came to visit.
- The Water Taxi at Seacrest Park is a quick 5-8 min walk from the house - not available on the weekends during the winter BTW.  We learned that the hard way. Safeway (grocery) close by on California Ave SW. And downtown Seattle is either 8 mins away by Water Taxi OR 20 mins by cab since the Water Taxi stops service at 7pm. Be sure to check the schedules.
I loved my stay there.  Thank you Daniel for being so gracious despite my check-out time error."
426089,24365200,2014-12-27,2214222,Nathan,"Daniel was a very good host. Really responsive and willing to work with me. The house hosted my visiting family over Christmas and it was the perfect size for everyone. The view is truly amazing, even better than what you see in the listing photos. Comfortable house, lots of space and amenities. Cost of an Uber to downtown was about $18-25 over the Holiday period. It was nice to leave downtown behind and enjoy the peace and quiet of the West Seattle location."
426089,26613200,2015-02-16,25900721,Ron,"Daniel was very communicative and responded quickly to all our questions. The place was exactly what we expected. The view is outrageous! and the place was quiet and restful, the neighborhood was nice and private. Everything was practically perfect."

426089,54969102,2015-11-27,7593096,Karen,"The most amazing view and a fantastic location from which to see and experience the city.  House itself was super weird.  50 degrees in the house upon arrival.  Front entrance and back deck unkempt and cluttered. Two toilets - both dodgy.  We had one clogged toilet which resulted in a yucky flood and neither flushed easily or well - ever.  2 of the bedrooms only have 3 walls meaning no privacy at all. This was awful - no one could sleep after the first person was up and no one could turn in early, including kids.  Where the 4th wall should be, there is a railing made of aluminum and plastic, on the other side of which is a 10' drop to the first floow.  The rails are at least 12"" apart (code violation where I live) and so rickety that falling through them to the floor below was a constant concern, especially with rowdy children.  No televisions in the bedrooms - only one TV in the main living area so no chance of entertaining the kids elsewhere while the adults use the living (website hidden) gear mostly old and rusty.  Kettle works but doesn't boil water - hottish but not boiling. Had rain and high wind one day - the house leaked terribly leaving water inside to clean up.  Generally not very clean and not well constructed or maintained.   No paper towels.  Linens were clean but stiff.  Beds all Ikea mattresses sitting on a wood frame w/ no box springs - not awful but not luxurious.  Plastic tables in the bedrooms w/ lamps - no decor.  No rugs, no decorations, no warmth.  Heater in the room with the bunk beds doesn't work.  
Dreadful neighbors - had one guest in 9 days and the nasty woman from across the street knocked on the door and told us to move ""our car"" from in front of her house.  It didn't belong to our guest, but she insisted it was ours and called the police.  The police came despite the silly claim so we wasted time and energy and then worried every day she would vandalize our vehicle parked in the driveway.  The house has a small driveway and the street is a public street - no reason for this drama but be aware of the nuts in the area.  The street is a very narrow dead end and parking is dear so the residents there are very attached to whatever street parking they rely on.  Ate at Husky's Deli - awesome. Safeway market is about 1 mile. West Seattle was amazing - try Duke's on Alki for the best chowder on either coast.
Bottom line - if the view and the location are the only important elements you're in luck.  The house itself was the strangest family rental ever.  "
426089,56996706,2015-12-20,19406236,Avrohom,"Daniel was very helpful in the checking and out process. The views were spectacular and the family had a great time. Two of the bedrooms are open to the space below, which is the dining room and not very private. The corner of the home is a little bit on a slant which is noticeable. Bearing these in mind I would highly recommend this home."
2494157,13483192,2014-05-28,4909685,Bob,"Outstanding property, spotless and perfect.  Great location - walk to restaurants and grocery store.  Very thought appointments and easy parking."
2494157,21202594,2014-10-13,19702875,Su,"We had a wonderful time in Seattle and the townhome in Fremont was perfect! It was spacious but comfortable and beautifully maintained. Thank you Michelle for the hospitality, we really enjoyed our stay!"
2494157,21526726,2014-10-19,58524,Chris And Carolina,"This is a beautiful home on a quiet street.  We slept six very comfortably here.   The house had everything we needed.  The digital combination lock was really nice so that we didn't need to keep track of a key.  The beds all slept very well.  The neighborhood is clean and safe, and close to pretty much everything.  We would stay here again."
2494157,21755166,2014-10-23,19730924,Marcus,"Awesome place! immaculately clean and tidy. We got everything we need, from towels to sanitaries, kitchen cooking wares to laundry facilities. Not to mention 3 umbrellas as it was raining the last few days. Very comfortable and warm.

Best part is that we are just walking distance to all the good food. Nonna and Uneeda Burger place is just phenomenal! 

Will most definitely stay here again when we visit Seattle. Will recommend anyone without a doubt!

Thanks again!

The only criticism was road noise but that settled quite early and is of course offset by the wonderful access to Aurora Ave which takes you straight into town.
There is also a small issue with the HVAC being noisy at times but I figure this is because we didn't really know how to use it.
The location is walking distance to shops, has a dedicated carpark and with a keypad front door lock completely removes the need to remember the keys.
We were assisted by two lovely locals who helped us retrieve my phone that I left in the cab.
We did not meet Michelle but she was very professional in all ways though I think that her understanding of AirBNB and mine are a little different when it comes to the ""agreement/contract"" as she wanted us to sign a further document that I was unsure was how it is supposed to work.  This is probably my ignorance."
2494157,33103605,2015-05-25,126089,Elliot,"Fantastic location, easy to park. House was spotless, walking distance to restaurants and coffee. It was wonderful to grill outside with the family. I would definitely stay here again."
2494157,45933134,2015-09-07,34040901,Thanh-Giang,"This home was perfect for our group's needs. Stylish, cozy, and near attractions (Paseo around the corner!), Jet City Townhome was a winner. Of note, the bedroom with the daybed is on the smaller side if the bed is fully expanded. The dishwasher was whisper-quiet, and the bedding comfortable. Although just a turn off Aurora, the location on a side street made it a serene place to stay."
2494157,48682331,2015-09-28,1755632,Ellis,"We had a terrific time at the Fremont townhouse. The management company was very responsive and accommodated our early arrival. The condo was spotless and perfectly laid out for our family of four. It had everything we needed, a designated parking spot (very important!) and was in easy walking distance of many fantastic shops and restaurants. Best of all, when my daughter forgot her well loved blanket and bear the cleaning staff found it for us, washed it, and sent it fed-ex. This experience was really above and beyond."
6127974,31083383,2015-05-01,32050345,Joseph,"Michael was a great host. He responded quickly and made sure that I had everything that I needed and more. The apartment was in a perfect location and was beautiful. The bed was so comfortable, I didn't want to get up. It was way more than I expected and would gladly stay there again next time I am in town. A great first Airbnb experience."
6127974,31153900,2015-05-02,12463163,Cathy & Ken,"Michael was a great host.  He confirmed within an hour of my request and sent me the entry code.  He also called shortly before my scheduled arrival to make sure I got the information and answer any questions.  The studio was recently renovated and immaculately clean.  All the photos are completely accurate. He has good info on his listing and also in the room for parking, etc.  The bed is Sterns Foster (fantastic quality), large, super comfortable and the sheets very nice. I know Seattle and this is definitely a nice neighborhood.  Micheal is dedicated to making his place nice for his guests and for their stay to go smoothly--well that is they way I felt. When I left we spoke and he told me about the improvements that his making even before I could suggest them.  I don't have any complaints. This will be one of my top choices when I visit my family in Seattle."
6127974,31677000,2015-05-08,155626,Nancy,"The greenlake studio was very clean and well put together. The fixtures, floors, and feel are very contemporary and comfortable."
6127974,31742084,2015-05-09,6462155,Michelle,A neat and meticulously clean studio in a great location.
6127974,32196873,2015-05-15,8959214,Katrina And Josh,"This is an awesome studio-- it was perfect for me and my husband. Michael was so easy to communicate with and even had wine and snacks for us on the dresser! The heater was a lifesaver for us since, as Phoenicians, were freezing in the May Seattle weather. Also, we loved the comfortable bed, especially the pillows! 

The neighborhood is wonderful: market, restaurants, retail and coffee shops were literally a short walk up/down the street. We would definitely stay here again. Thank you again, Michael!
"
6127974,32845208,2015-05-22,13239468,Leili,"I loved  the studio!It had everything you could need: complimentary bottle of wine and snacks were so thoughtful, too. Close to everything;  yoga studios, across from Ken's market. Walk to Greenlake. "
6127974,33300782,2015-05-26,4837653,Daniel,"My wife and I stayed at Michael's place with our toddler son for one night. It served us well, and it worked fine to use a pack-and-play crib for our son in the corner. It was very clean and tidy. 

A few minor cons: the bed did have a fairly pronounced low spot in the middle that my wife and I found ourselves rolling into during the night. Also the bathroom is very narrow; my knees were pressed tight against the wall when using the toilet. Taller or larger folks might have a bit more trouble.

Overall it worked very well for us. The location was just what we were looking for and the price was great. Also we loved being just 2 blocks from a tasty ice cream parlor (Bluebird Ice Creamery, two blocks north) that was open late!"
6127974,33705476,2015-05-31,32842398,Rich,Very nice and convenient studio in Phinney Ridge.  I would stay there again.
6127974,34014233,2015-06-03,9360302,Siddartha,We had a nice and pleasant stay. Bed was super comfortable. Michael was also very accommodative as far as our check-in time was concerned. Overall we will highly recommend this place if you are looking for a nice and cozy getaway in a great neighborhood.
6127974,34550330,2015-06-09,32871156,Anna,"Michael's place was perfect. Simple, private, and cozy, with everything we needed. The bed was really comfy and we enjoyed sitting outside on the steps in the morning while drinking coffee. Will definitely stay there again. "
6127974,34898752,2015-06-13,34696287,Kamau,"The neighborhood was exceptional as well as the property. The bathroom was a snug fit but I'm 6'2 and all legs, regardless we made it work. This spacious homey location reminded me of a studio hotel room only a lot more private which I enjoyed. Mike was there when we needed him, which we didn't really need because he set the place up just right. The guidelines were very helpful and to the point. The neighborhood is a great place to walk around and exceedingly quiet and quaint. All and all a great stay and would return any time we are in town."
6127974,35146580,2015-06-15,1021226,Diane,"The studio was exactly as pictured. No surprises. Great location. Extremely clean, compact, modern. Very safe with it's own individual lockbox. Highly recommend."

6127974,35925916,2015-06-23,32006948,Ame,"Fantastic space!  It was convenient and in a great neighborhood for walking to get a latte in the morning, or driving downtown for the day. The bed is large and comfy; a great bed to fall into after a full day out and about in gorgeous Emerald City!  "
6127974,36320106,2015-06-27,35589925,Annitra,"I loved the location, so many restaurants and bars close by and a great grocery store across the street. Phinney Ridge is super cute, quiet and close to Green Lake and Woodland Parks. "
6127974,36694502,2015-06-30,22593246,Trevecca,"Michael was available and responded immediately to email or call. Great locations! We loved Phinney Ridge neighborhood. Plus quick drive into the heart of Seattle. Bed and pillows very comfortable. Small but very nice. We enjoyed our visit! if you think you will need an iron, bring your own. That's the only thing missing."
6127974,39174788,2015-07-21,26771686,Tim & Penny,We were made to feel very welcome and we were kept well informed. It was as expected and very comfortable.  Ken's supermarket across the road is open until 11pm and very good.  We had a lovely meal at the Stumbling Goat Bistro. Thanks again for hosting us Michael. 
6127974,39632167,2015-07-25,34015111,Chris,The studio apartment in Phinney Ridge was exactly what we were looking for during our short stay in Seattle.  The room was quite spacious and the bed was comfortable.  The arrival time was pretty flexible once the room was cleaned from the previous guests.  The location of the apartment made it easy to access all parts of the city.  the community has a lot of restaurants and a great coffee house a block away (Herkimer Coffee).  Would definitely stay here again!
6127974,40409020,2015-07-30,39719642,Caleb,"Great location, quiet and comfortable!"

6127974,42452505,2015-08-13,3620570,Mark,"Michael was an excellent and attentive host. The studio was clean and nice to stay in. The proximity to coffee houses, grocery and Phinney live was excellent."
6127974,43546629,2015-08-20,3502607,Kyle,"Studio was exactly as expected, photos and description accurate. Door with electronic lock is a good idea, no fumbling around with a key exchange. Thanks!"
6127974,43858969,2015-08-22,3683158,Hannah,"Great location, clean apartment, and easy check-in process! Out-of-town family stayed in the apartment while visiting me in Seattle. It was great to have them so close by in the neighborhood. They said the bed was very comfortable and it was quiet and peaceful at night. Great space. "
6127974,44335725,2015-08-25,4732021,Wendy,Enjoyed the spacious studio in a fun location. 
6127974,44722968,2015-08-28,36051352,Sean,Inexpensive and clean studio rental in a fantastic neighborhood.  Very easy and would highly recommend.
6127974,45403658,2015-09-02,4153264,Jeff,"The process was easy and seamless, the room was comfortable, and the neighborhood is great! Lots of restaurants and shops, and easy transportation to downtown. A great place to stay for a weekend, or a month. One minor thing, the bathroom layout is a little awkward (particularly toilet placement). But I would stay here again, and recommend to friends."
6127974,46388516,2015-09-10,39174296,Mark,"We really enjoyed our stay. Being in the heart of a neighborhood is much more enjoyable than a hotel. Easy walking distance to great hole in the wall restaurants, a grocery store, and was very convenient to other Seattle neighborhoods. The studio had everything we needed. Great shower!"
6127974,47090905,2015-09-15,27917010,Jules,"The location was in a cute and cozy neighborhood with some amazing views just a few blocks down. Their were tons of restaurants, bars and coffee shops in walking distance, which was very convenient . The home was also attached to a record and vintage clothing shop. Simply wonderful and just as described in the listing! "
6127974,47799597,2015-09-21,31314584,Nick,"Place was great!  Exactly as described in listing.  Right off the main street for the neighborhood with grocery store, bars and restaurants all right within walking distance.

Host had all prepared upon arrival and good instruction in the place.  Will stay here again upon return to Seattle!"
6127974,48339146,2015-09-25,18674250,Peter,Nice and private studio in a great neighborhood. Mike's instructions made it very easy to access the studio despite my late arrival.
6127974,48768260,2015-09-28,43092925,Monique,"Although my boyfriend and I didn't have the chance to meet Michael in person, he welcomed us to the studio via e-mail beforehand, was available to be reached via e-mail and phone throughout our stay, left information and instructions in the studio, and responded to my messages quickly. The studio was exactly as it appears in photos- beautiful and clean, with a great kitchen setup that had everything we needed. We loved the convenient location- right on the bus line to downtown, across the street from the grocery store, and within walking distance of places to eat, drink, and shop in Phinney Ridge, plus Green Lake to go for a run. We really enjoyed staying at Michael's studio for our first visit to Seattle and would recommend it to anyone! "
6127974,49694971,2015-10-05,35639304,Amy,"We had a great stay! The apartment was really nice and in a cute neighborhood. Tons of coffee shops, cafes and bars just a short walk away. The market across the street was really convenient. Would definitely stay there again.  "
6127974,50950746,2015-10-16,44770501,Kameron,"My girlfriend and I had a blast at Michael's Studio
This place had the Best Bed, I felt like i hadn't slept right in years haha.
The studio pretty much had everything we needed except for maybe a cutting board haha but other than that, We felt in love with the awesome neighborhood."
6127974,51372541,2015-10-19,46025857,Jorge,"This place has one of the most comfortable beds I've ever stayed at! Place is super clean, plus it has a mini kitchen and fridge. It's close to supermarket, bars, restaurants, book store, coffee shop. About 15 min from downtown Seattle. Only weird thing is the bathroom space but not a big deal. "
6127974,52921268,2015-11-02,47396733,Clayton,"They apartment was absolutely wonderful and you couldn't ask for a better location; from the market across the street, to all the little bars and shops that are all within walking distance. My wife and I had an absolute blast and can't wait to return! "
6127974,55411844,2015-12-01,891213,Sarah,"We booked this place for my in-laws to stay in while visiting us over Thanksgiving. They loved it! The bed was huge and comfortable (a real bonus in this day and age) and the really liked having the ability to make coffee and breakfast in the mornings. The location is great as it is a very short walk to 2 great Seattle coffee shops and having Ken's Market across the street was highly convenient for them. They said it was quiet and they slept well every night. The instructions given by Michael were concise and prompt and we had no problems getting into the unit. The host also left detailed instructions in the unit about anything we might have had questions about. Our in-laws will definitely stay there again, and we will recommend this place to our own family and friends when they come to town. "
446276,1466394,2012-06-12,2240122,Lois,"A lovely, clean, quiet condo for our stay this past weekend.  The pictures were spot on (well, except that Tim just installed a beautiful new rug in the living room) - this place is very comfortable and tastefully decorated.  It was just the right size for the three of us and with a cute little kitchen so we could make breakfast in the morning.  We enjoyed our stay here very much and Tim was a great host - in contact with us several times to answer questions, get me on the internet and make sure we were okay.  Having a garage for our rental car was wonderful, as street parking in the area is a challenge.  
The location was perfect for us - just 4 blocks up to the QFC grocery store and local restaurants and a short drive to our son's place and the festivities of graduation weekend.  
I'd definitely recommend this location and Tim as a host!"
446276,1881981,2012-08-04,997141,Andrew,"My family had a fantastic stay at Tim's place.  He has a lovely home and it was really central to everything we did in Seattle.  He had a very detailed binder of what is in the area, and we mostly stayed in the neighborhood all week."

446276,2702192,2012-10-24,2368437,Rebekah,"Tim was an incredibly thoughtful and gracious host.  He responded to all communication right away and made the whole process so easy.  His house is beautiful and has everything you might need to make your stay more comfortable.  His exhaustive list of nearby eats and attractions also came in very handy.

I would absolutely stay here again!

446276,2880991,2012-11-13,405062,Brent,"Had a great stay at Tim's place. The location is fantastic, one block from an awesome little coffee shop, and walking distance from everything you could need in Seattle.  It's a very pleasant place that makes a perfect base for a trip to Seattle. The parking is a nice bonus too. Would definitely stay here again."

He was an incredibly communicative and thoughtful host, and it was an excellent aibnb experience. "
446276,4535766,2013-05-11,2695546,Tawna,"First things first, Tim was the best host you could ask for.  He left us a list of restaurants, a gift basket and fresh flowers.  It was great.  He was also incredibly helpful throughout the week for any questions we had.  The location was perfect.  We were in town for a conference at the Convention Center and could not have stayed at a better place.  We could easily walk to the CC daily (0.8 miles) but still felt like we were in a neighborhood as opposed to downtown commercial city.  I will definitely stay there again!"
446276,5361947,2013-06-26,1384420,Kim,"I booked Tim's beautiful apartment in Capitol Hill for my elderly parents and my sister, while they were here in Seattle for my wedding.  The location was perfect and the apartment was immaculate!  My parents and sister loved staying here and felt very comfortable and since it was their first time in the Northwest, this place made the stay extra special.  My Dad even mentioned that he wished they had the apartment!  Time was very communicative whenever I needed to ask questions and was very flexible.  It was a plus that he had a small garage that would fit a small economy rental car because Capitol Hill is a busy area for any street parking.  I highly recommend this apartment and we will definitely use it again when we have family in town.  Thanks Tim!"
446276,5966945,2013-07-24,6471053,Shelley,"Tim is a great host!  He left a welcome basket for us, information about Seattle, and accommodated our flight times.  The condo is clean and comfortable and in a great location.  I have recommended it to friends and family."
446276,7011724,2013-09-03,7385951,Logan,"nice, spacious apartment.  very clean and timothy was an awesome host.  there was an entire book on the coffee table with local (great) recommendations that was very helpful.  timothy was very conscientious, leaving milk and cold, filtered water in the fridge and checking in by email periodically to make sure we were doing okay.  the location is PERFECT, right in the heart of everything.  great restaurants and coffee shops within walking distance, and being in the center of the city made it easy to visit every neighborhood in seattle.  would definitely recommend this apartment!  "
446276,7252832,2013-09-13,7546907,Julie,"Thanks to Timothy for sharing his lovely Capitol Hill apartment with us! The thoughtful touches on arrival made our trip from the east coast much easier. Wine and chocolate! The location was perfect and we were able to walk to dinner. The beds were very comfy. It was so convenient to have the use of the garage. Sadly, Tim wasn't there to meet us but I hope to have that pleasure on my next trip to Seattle."
446276,7914056,2013-10-08,6737719,Anna,"My family had an amazing time staying at Timothy's property for a long weekend in Seattle. He was very prompt responding to my questions and welcomed us with delicious gifts from local producers which was a great way to start learning about the city.  We were charmed by and extremely comfortable in his well-appointed property. We had everything we needed. Also, the location in Capitol Hill meant we could walk almost everywhere we needed to! Next time we are in Seattle, we'll definitely try to stay at Timothy's!"
446276,8778875,2013-11-18,1092234,Melissa,"We had a wonderful stay at Timothy's apartment! I would highly recommend if you are going to Seattle! Timothy was very responsive and helpful. The place was very clean and comfortable.
When I visit Seattle again I would def like to stay at Timothy's again!"
446276,9001687,2013-12-01,1515251,Colleen,"Staying at Timothy's beautiful home in the Capitol Hill neighborhood was one of my best Airbnb experiences.  Although we didn't get a chance to meet because he went out of town for the Thanksgiving holiday, he made sure that everything we needed was there, and was accessible by phone.  I was traveling with my daughter and her husband and my 2 yr old grand-daughter, and it couldn't have been more perfect.  The home is charming in every detail, and Timothy provided us with a beautiful welcome basket and an excellent guidebook for the city.   We felt like we were in a 4 star hotel with the wonderful beds, the beautiful artwork in the apt., and all of the top notch kitchen furnishings.  I also appreciated having access to the garage as finding street parking in Seattle can be difficult.  I'd love to come again as we all felt so at home.  Many thanks Timothy for making our holiday so memorable."
446276,9465162,2013-12-30,9771266,Eileen,"Timothy's apartment worked out perfectly for our family.
We came to Seattle to spend time over the Holidays with our sons.
Timothy greeted us at the apartment, gave us a quick tour and directions for appliances and then left us on our own.  He was accessible if we needed him, but we had the place to ourselves.  It was a perfect location at the bottom of Capitol Hill.  It was an easy walk up to Volunteer Park or a nice walk down to Sculpture Park or Pike's Market.  The apartment was clean and the bed was comfortable.  We did some cooking and the appliances all worked.  There were many restaurants nearby to enjoy all types of food.
We definitely recommend this apartment!

446276,10674874,2014-03-03,1343241,Robin,"A friend and I were in Seattle for a conference and stayed at Tim's sweet duplex.  Tim left the place well-stocked with treats and linens, etc.  It couldn't have been cleaner or cuter!  Great art, too.  I would definitely recommend."
446276,13737060,2014-06-03,13158066,Kathy,Tim was great.  The home was lovely.  Very comfortable. We felt very lucky to have ended  up here.  Capital Hill fantastic.  Best donuts 2 blocks away.  And a garage to make life easy!   Tim has set the set pretty high!  It was perfect. Kathy and Molly 6/4/2014
446276,15305373,2014-07-07,13103088,Wayne,"Tim provided a great first Airbnb experience! The house was very clean, well prepped, and very comfortable. Tim was super friendly and made sure I knew my way around the house and also Seattle itself. I highly recommend Tim!"
446276,17947683,2014-08-19,4758908,Lucinda,"Tim ensured that our stay was absolutely perfect.  He was very responsive and hospitable in the weeks leading up to our visit: always answered questions promptly and had a great memory for our particular needs and preferences as tourists.  Upon arrival, there was a gift basket full of delicious goodies waiting for us, as well as Tim's great insider's guide to neighborhood eateries & other attractions.  We loved Tim's place -- it was very roomy and comfortable for three people -- and the neighborhood can't be beat.  We hope to be back soon!!"
446276,18794266,2014-09-01,17007279,Kristen,"My family stayed here on their recent visit to Seattle, since my apartment is just down the street. Our host made all of us feel extremely welcome, leaving all of the relevant information available and a nice welcome basket with local treats to enjoy. The space was beautiful and inviting, and very accurate to the listing. My brother appreciated having the privacy of a second bedroom, which is rare in the neighborhood. 

We won't hesitate to have our guests stay here again! The neighborhood is walking-friendly, and my parents enjoyed being within 5 minutes of great coffee shops, grocery stores, and restaurants. Seattle's best doughnut shop Top Pot is right down the street, tucked in next to a very cool speakeasy-style cocktail bar called Sun Liquor. My family took advantage of the stay at this location  and beautiful apartment, and really felt like locals in the Capitol Hill neighborhood. "
446276,28620144,2015-03-27,378447,Michael,"Tim and his apartment were fantastic! The apartment is very cozy with beautiful views when the sun is shining. It is in a quiet neighborhood that is close to great restaurants and coffee shops. We walked nearly everywhere including to Pikes Place Market and all over downtown Seattle. Tim was a very helpful and gracious host. Some things that made Tim stand apart from your average Airbnb host: 1) easy information on getting into the place before we arrived; 2) very helpful and informative book in the apartment with Tim's recommendations and tips for making the most of our stay in Seattle; 3) treats! yes, there were treats when we arrived. Tim really cared that we had a great stay."
446276,29772405,2015-04-12,29920888,Andrew,Fantastic setup all around. Great accommodations and very accessible to everything that we needed to do
446276,33672227,2015-05-31,5644636,David,"Tim went out of his way to make me and my friend feel welcome, giving me information about hiring bikes, restaurants and the many wonderful coffee shops nearby. It was a very enjoyable experience.  The house is spacious, ideal either as a base to wander or just to sit and read.  It is just a short walk either to town or to the nightlife of Capitol Hill.  "
446276,35068456,2015-06-15,28811175,Alycia,"This was my first Airbnb experience and I am very happy we stayed at Tim’s property. The accommodations were great - comfortable and plenty of room for 3 people. We loved the view from the comfy window seat – the weather was gorgeous when we were in town so we took advantage of sitting in the window seat and soaking up the afternoon sun! The location was exactly what we wanted – a nice, quiet neighborhood but still close to restaurants and shops. Capitol Hill is a great neighborhood but it can get loud at night on the main streets. Tim’s place is a few blocks off Broadway so it’s an easy walk to restaurants/shops while still being located in the quieter part of Cap Hill. Seattle is such a walkable city – we love the downtown and Pike Market areas and they are completely walkable from Tim’s place (or a short uber ride away). There are bus stops close to Tim’s place as well. 
What truly stood out about our stay in Tim’s place was that Tim made us feel very welcome into his home.  When we arrived, there was a welcome basket filled with lots of goodies and a handwritten card from Tim, welcoming us to Seattle. Tim also put together a thorough information book with public transportation info, suggestions on places to eat, things to do, etc. He was very helpful and responsive and made himself available throughout our entire stay in Seattle if we had any questions. He genuinely wanted us to enjoy our time in Seattle – a truly wonderful host! Overall, a great Airbnb experience! 
"
446276,39191568,2015-07-21,36084546,Diana,"Timothy was a most hospitable host and a lovely welcome basket was awaiting our arrival. His home was comfortable, with charming decor.  A well organized notebook containing local recommendations and maps was quite helpful. We were able to walk to many locations, including downtown and nearby restaurants. We would definitely stay here again if the opportunity arose to return to Seattle."
446276,45271863,2015-09-01,11629528,Richard,"Timothy was extremely hospitable and made us feel very welcome and taken care of.  He even left us a little care package which I wasn't expecting at all, and made an effort to meet us and make sure we had what we needed.  Was in an interesting area of Seattle within walking distance to some tasty restaurants.  Easy uber or taxi ride to downtown.  Thanks!"
446276,51123004,2015-10-18,37935756,Simon,"We had a fantastic time staying at Timothy's apartment; it was spacious, clean and well-appointed. It feels like Timothy has thought of everything; the countless little touches were the best part, and he certainly wins the award for the most detailed and personalized guide to the neighborhood--what a great resource! The location couldn't be beat either--the apartment was a great base from which to explore Capitol Hill on foot, and the rest of the city was easy to get to as well."
446276,55217488,2015-11-29,1515251,Colleen,"This was my 2nd stay at Timothy's lovely home in the Capitol Hill neighborhood.  Everything is just about perfect in his home.  Timothy was there to greet me and give me the keys and relevant information, and was available if needed during our stay.  We left the car in his garage during our 3 days and walked to restaurants and shopping and parks nearby.  The view of the Olympic Mountains is really spectacular from his living room window.  Thank you Timothy and I hope we'll be able to come back again on our next Seattle visit."
5160893,26119042,2015-02-03,20046088,Jessie,"Elisa's room was cute and cozy, the bed was really comfortable and the location was ideal. Elisa was a great host and even took us over to a friends place to watch the Super Bowl! We would definitely recommend staying here :-) "
5160893,26547422,2015-02-15,26621798,Lia,"Elisa's place was just amazing! Elisa was very welcoming, and made me feel like an old friend. Her room was really lovely, in the perfect part of Seattle. This home was in walking distance from bars, coffee shops and buses. The bed was very comfortable, the room had great light, and gave me the perfect Seattle experience!"
5160893,27178607,2015-02-27,8362547,Mona,"I thank Elisa for her quick responses all times. She prepared me her nice room lovely and clean. Her bed is big and romantic as I wish to have one in my home.
What I have missed was the welcome of a person and some introduciton in the flat. Of course Elisa prepared me towels but I must say the bathroom had seen better times. Elisa shares her place with two others. Its what we call a living share. 
I would recommend Elisa's place for travelers without any hight expectations. Uncomplicated and easy going. Tolerant and independent. "
5160893,27673366,2015-03-09,27958932,Amy,"Elisa was wonderful - very hospitable and quick to respond to any requests. She lives in a cool neighborhood, walking distance from restaurants and nightlife. Her room was spacious, clean and private. We enjoyed the stay very much, thank you!"
5160893,28207261,2015-03-20,4876876,Sofia,"Quartier très sympa...Elisa est adorable. Nous sommes allées prendre un café ensemble et nous avons bien discuté, c'était très sympa. La chambre est grande et le lit très agréable. La cuisine de la colocation est plutot en bazar mais dispo si besoin. La salle de bain est partagée mais pas super propre. Mais la chambre est calme et très bien situé."
5160893,28529873,2015-03-25,2216194,Marina,"We had a wonderful time staying with Elisa. Perfect, central location around many restaurants, bars and shops. The room was very comfortable and Elisa was accommodating and a helpful host. "
5160893,28756882,2015-03-29,9022866,Anna,Gorgeous room exactly as described on the post. Elisa has an artistically styled place in one of the hype areas in Seattle. She was very responsive to all my questions and her communication style was just great. Totally recommend it if you are visiting Seattle!
5160893,29170538,2015-04-05,25372364,Meagan,"Elisa was really welcoming and very easy to get in touch with. The apartment itself was nice, as described, in a very cute area of town. I would definitely stay here again."
5160893,29864785,2015-04-13,30003006,Stephanie,"Staying with Elisa was a wonderful choice. She was kind, welcoming, and a wealth of knowledge willing to provide recommendations throughout my stay. Her place was really cute-quirky and artsy with a lot of character. The place is in a great spot, really accessible to other areas within a short period of time, but with a lot of neat spots even within walking distance. She was a wonderful host, even inviting me to come hang out with her and her neighbors for a movie night as i was staying by myself, while also giving me the space to do things on my own. Elisa was professional, easy to get a hold of, and a wonderful communicator. I would definitely recommend staying here if you are looking for an inside view of local life.  It really felt like i was staying with friends. Thank so much for taking part in making my first trip to Seattle such a success!"
5160893,29929578,2015-04-14,29293631,Katherine,Elisa was great! She was very communicative leading up to our stay and sent a picture of the front of the house so we knew what to look for. We arrived really early the day of our stay and she let us drop our bags so we could go explore. We felt very welcomed and the bed was amazing - hard to get out of! The apartment is walking distance to good restaurants and shopping.  Coastal Kitchen brunch is a must! A bit of a jaunt if walking to downtown but we had no problem with it. Elisa went out of her way to accommodate us and had great suggestions for activities that may be off the beaten path. We very much felt like we were staying with a friend and were very appreciative of her suggestions and help. We would definitely stay with her again.
5160893,30171778,2015-04-18,5984291,Rowan,"Staying with Elisa was great! She was very communicative, and gave me all the information I needed to check in at my convenience. The apartment was beautiful, quiet, and comfortable. Parking in the area is difficult, but the apartment is within walking distance from lots of stores and restaurants. I would definitely stay here again!"
5160893,30224687,2015-04-19,20564827,Darcey,Location of the apartment was perfect! Tons of restaurants in walkable distance. In the middle of everything fun and the neighborhood is really green/beautiful. The room is bright and spacious. The bed is extremely comfortable. Elisa was very easy to get a hold of and she gave us great sight seeing recommendations!
5160893,30367718,2015-04-20,31375000,Christine,"The room is large, bright, clean and private. It is nicely furnished, with a very comfortable bed, a love seat, large mirror, and lovely art decorating the walls.  The apartment house is older and a bit drafty, but a space heater was provided and the bed had lots of blankets so it was really comfortable. Elisa was a great host, she was friendly and easy going, invited us out for coffee, provided shampoo, conditioner and soap, set out towels and chocolates for us--we felt very welcomed there. The apartment house is in a great location, just two blocks from Broadway, so it's a quick, easy walk to lots of restaurants and shops. The neighborhood is bustling; we enjoyed sitting on the front steps in the evening, drinking wine and chatting with neighbors and passers by. We felt completely safe. Street parking is free on the block, so understandably it can be hard to locate a spot. We got lucky and found parking fairly close to the place, and just walked and took public transport during our stay.  This was our first Airbnb experience, and it was so great, we'll definitely be staying there again!"
5160893,30477696,2015-04-22,680336,Kim,Elisa was very responsive and accommodating. Great location with privacy. Easy access to the house.
5160893,30893945,2015-04-28,30568254,Evgenia,"That was my first airbnb experience and I'm very happy with it! Elisa is a wonderful person, very friendly, helpful, and ready to spend some time with you or leave you alone if that is what you need. The apartment and her room are very cozy. I came to Seattle for an audition so I really needed to stay focused, have a good sleep at night and be able to practice during the day. I couldn't have found a better place for all of it because it just so happened that Elisa's roommates were out of town at the moment so I was alone in the entire apartment for the whole stay. I could use the kitchen to make myself hot tea or cook some food from Trader Joe's which is not that far away from apartment. 
The only one minor problem in this apartment is that it can be pretty cold during cold months as Elisa mentioned in the description. Elisa's room has a wonderful heater though plus many blankets so it is never cold in the room, but bathroom and kitchen area were pretty cold.
I absolutely loved the neighborhood, it has those pretty houses with small gardens, very clean and beautiful, filled with flowers and bushes. I loved to walk around! Plus it is very close to downtown, 10 minutes by taxi ($9-10 with tips) or 15 min by bus which goes every 15 min. I even walked once down and it was probably around 30 minutes. This neighborhood has a lot of restaurants, very good bakery (the one Elisa is recommended), some shops. 
I had really a wonderful time in Seattle thanks to Elisa, I'm sure staying in her apartment created a right mood that helped me perform very well at my audition. I definitely would stay there more my next time in Seattle!"
5160893,31311719,2015-05-04,15512737,Caitlin,"We had a wonderful experience at Elisa's apartment! The room was comfortable with plenty of room for a couple, and we walked into downtown everyday. Pikes place was about a 20 minute walk. We had a fantastic time, and would recommend this place to anyone looking for an airbnb in Seattle. "
5160893,31987748,2015-05-12,1889890,Becca,"Super cute bedroom, much bigger than it looks in her pictures. Love her decorating style, mix of semi-rustic and modern eclectic. She left fresh towels and an info sheet and chocolate on the bed for me. She wasn't kidding when she says walking distance from everything. And so much green!!! I love plants, it was nice to be somewhere alive."
5160893,32070748,2015-05-13,3260167,Lily,"Elisa's place has by far been my best Airbnb experience to date! She's incredibly welcoming, friendly, and a GREAT hostess. She made sure I had all the info I needed, and made me feel like a part of the house. As a solo traveler, that was truly awesome. The room itself is gorgeously decorated, and even bigger than the photos make it seem. The neighborhood is a perfect location, easy to get everywhere, with lots of great bars and restaurants nearby. I had a fantastic time here and will definitely try to stay here again next time I'm in Seattle. Thanks Elisa!!! "
5160893,32327159,2015-05-17,13321689,Jennifer,Elisa was a great host! Her place is in a great location with lots to do nearby.  Easy walk to downtown. She is very responsive.

The neighborhood is awesome and walking distance to tons of restaurants, coffee shops, bars, shops, etc. Her room is as pictured. Really cute, clean and the bed is extremely comfortable. Overall, the house has a great creative energy with tons of artwork all over the house. It also has a great backyard patio."
5160893,33039589,2015-05-24,156959,Ekaterina,"Great location, cute and comfortable bedroom. Elisa was great at communication and was very patient while I figured out some issues with my Airbnb account in order to make the booking. Thanks for the lovely stay! "

Location was super awesome and quite walk-able! The space was clean and just perfect for my short visit to Seattle! Definitely plan on staying again next time I'm in the Emerald City! "
5160893,34020636,2015-06-03,30005735,Aj,Elisa was lovely to communicate with and provided the exact accommodations that were described. I was traveling through town briefly and this was the perfect landing spot. 
5160893,34111051,2015-06-04,34750654,Tim,What an amazing room! My girlfriend and I fell in love with the place instantly. Great location and a couple steps to a ton of bars and restaurants. Will stay here again next time we visit for (website hidden) The bed is ridiculously comfortable.
5160893,34277180,2015-06-07,27868674,Kristin,"Elisa's place was exactly as described: charming, sunny, and near everything! I had a rental car but never had to use it because I could walk everywhere. Her place is clean and adorable and I pretty much had the place to myself the whole time. I would stay here again next time I come to seattle."

5160893,34947800,2015-06-14,29481158,Angela,"Elisa was casual and completely laid back. The room was clean with a wonderful bed, eclectic artwork and open enough for two people. The house is about 2 blocks to the main street with public transportation to the touristy spots. We didn't rent a car and could have easily stayed longer without staying in further to the downtown area."
5160893,35124780,2015-06-15,32159196,Allison,"Excellent location, clean room, friendly host. Overall, a great experience!"

5160893,35598545,2015-06-20,953951,Cebele,"Elisa's place was exactly as pictured! We stayed there for one night before our cruise started, and the neighborhood was absolutely perfect. It was super close to downtown and lots of restaurants and bars. The room was clean and we basically had the place to ourselves as her roommates weren't around much."
5160893,35636641,2015-06-21,11047565,Courtney,"We can't recommend Elisa's place strongly enough! We were really happy with our stay there. Elisa was very organized in getting us the key and making sure we had everything we needed. The bed is very comfortable and the room, being located at the front of the house, is quiet.

Our favourite part of the house was how gorgeous all of her artwork is. It's an inspiring place to stay.

We also enjoyed going around the corner to Witness on Broadway to have cocktails and chicken & waffles-- highly recommended!"
5160893,35943311,2015-06-23,29887659,Julia,"I was in town for a weekend wedding, and Elisa's place was perfect. It was near the wedding venue, as well as close to all of the touristy stuff. Elisa even gave me a ride to Gas Works Park so that I wouldn't have to take the bus. The room was clean and check-in and check-out were easy. The neighborhood was charming and I felt very safe. It was a great first airbnb experience."
5160893,36205593,2015-06-26,7262094,Lyndsey,"Elisa was an excellent host. She met us upon arrival and was extremely warm and made us feel at home. She gave us tips on where to go and must-see things, and she was available by text throughout my stay. The room is actually larger than it appears in the photos, so there was plenty of room to make myself comfortable and hang out. It was a little noisy in the mornings, as it is a first floor apartment, so you do get some road noise. I was a little hesitant to leave the windows open at night/when I wasn't home, but the neighborhood did appear safe. It's very conveniently located and there are a TON of restaurants, coffee shops, bars, parks nearby. I would definitely stay there again!"
5160893,36559400,2015-06-29,34380324,Jessica,"Great location and fantastic hostess!!  This was my first time using Air BnB and I've already recommended it to a handful of people all thanks to Elisa and the wonderful experience she provided.  The room was beautiful and cozy just a couple of blocks off the main road in Capital Hill.  We didn't need to use our car at all for the entire weekend, walking distance to all the highlights of Seattle.  Elisa was great!  Friendly and eager to offer assistance or anything we needed.  We will very likely stay with Elisa again in the future!"
5160893,36746861,2015-06-30,535408,Suzy And Jeannette,"I had a last minute overnight in Seattle and needed a place to crash for the night. Elisa's place was perfect. Clean, cute, comfortable, and in a great, walk-able neighborhood. We communicated only by text. She was super fast in her replies and all went smoothly. I'd definitely stay here again!"
5160893,36959309,2015-07-03,13716419,Kara,I enjoyed my experience at Elisa's house.  Elisa was very accommodating and welcoming. The room is very spacious and the house was fantastically decorated.

5160893,37570867,2015-07-08,956427,Oliver,"Elisa's room was perfect.. Good bed, nice furniture, very silent. WiFi worked good.
Organisation and contact with Elisa were very easy although she wasn't there during my stay.
The neighbourhood is great too.. Direct bus services to downtown, restaurants and a big grocery.
I felt very well"
5160893,38282144,2015-07-14,33233836,Trevor,"The location of Elisa's place was super convenient and safe. Bars, restaurants, gas, and groceries are all very close. 

Elisa was very helpful and communicated throughout my stay despite being on her own vacation. 

Her room is big and clean. Bathroom was kind of musty, but honestly, who spends a lot of time in the bathroom?"
5160893,38725189,2015-07-18,34544418,Hanna,"I had a wonderful time staying at Elisa’s! Her room is adorable- artfully decorated, very comfortable, spacious, private, quiet. The location is great, close to restaurants, bars, grocery store, and several bus lines that can take you all over the city. Elisa was extremely helpful and welcoming. I came in late after a long flight and felt instantly relaxed. It was perfect for me- a single traveling alone for a few days.  Elisa helped make my trip a wonderful experience!"
5160893,38850735,2015-07-19,34203371,Reagan,"A very comfortable, quiet and relaxing place to spend our night! Elisa did a great job of laying out directions and providing great amenities, as well as giving us wonderful recommendations to help us enjoy our day in Portland."

5160893,39295524,2015-07-22,6862643,Chandler,"Elisa's place is just as adorable (if not more so) than her pictures let on. Great location in CapHill with walking distance to lots of shops. Her bed is incredibly soft and comfortable. She's right about a lot of light coming in, but it definitely helps you wake up naturally in the morning. 10/10 would stay again. "
5160893,39385101,2015-07-23,11920612,Carole,"We stayed at Elisas house for only one night, but we felt very welcome from the first minute! Friendly people, beautiful and clean room and just a few steps from downtown. Really enjoyed staying there! :)"
5160893,39778496,2015-07-26,19455803,Sarah,"The room was peaceful, clean and very stylish. It was in a great neighborhood, just one block from Cal Anderson Park and awesome restaurants & shops. I would highly recommend this room. However, I didn't use much of the kitchen so I can't comment on how user friendly this is. Overall great spot for a great price!"
5160893,39927932,2015-07-27,10022313,Emily,"Best decorated Airbnb I've ever stayed in! Girls were lovely, apartment was lovely. Great location. Could walk to the Space Needle, Pike Place Market, etc. Capitol Hill that it's in has plenty to do/eat as well. Great stay. Definitely recommended. "

I only saw her for a few moments but she gave me an awesome Sushi recommendation. Her place was close to a ton of great shopping, eats and drink.  Great experience, if I ever come back to Seattle I would definitely stay here again!! Thank you Elisa!"
5160893,40769590,2015-08-02,36558872,Richard,"Elisa's apartment in Seattle was in a lovely neighborhood near many restaurants and bars, yet within walking distance of downtown. Her room was clean and tastefully furnished, and she was very accommodating and quick to reply to messages. I hope that my future experiences with Airbnb can be as pleasant as this trip was!"
5160893,41373777,2015-08-07,32085796,Bianca,First Airbnb experience and I really love it!
5160893,41460982,2015-08-07,37268972,Barbara,"We loved our time at Elisa's. We arrived late and she was flexible and helpful. Her ideas about walking, eating, where to get the best coffee  etc were excellent, and she seems like a genuinely lovely person. The room and space was as advertised, and bed was very comfortable. "
5160893,41720306,2015-08-09,6909422,Océane,"Logement très bien situé dans Seattle et chambre confortable et joliement décorée. Aucun souci pour communiquer avec Elisa sur les modalités du séjour ! La chambre est propre, les espaces communs un peu moins mais tout est à disposition pour passer un bon séjour dans cet espace cosy !"
5160893,42062116,2015-08-10,40302276,Karisa,Elisa was wonderful made sure we were comfortable and had everything we needed! She was very easy to communicate with! The parking was fine very safe feeling neighborhood! The room was comfortable and clean! Very happy we chose to try this out! 
5160893,42400407,2015-08-13,12812778,Sara,"Elisa was not home when we arrived, but the key was easy to find and there were some directions printed out on the bed. The bedroom itself was beautiful, but the rest of the house was a little messy. Wasn't any room in the fridge or pantry for food and the bathroom was very dirty."
5160893,42853306,2015-08-16,35339029,Bryan,The room was just as described with towels there as well.  Elisa texted us to make sure we were settled in and if we had any questions.  Great neighborhood with plenty of good restaurants and close to bus stops to take you around Seattle.  Thanks!
5160893,43048186,2015-08-17,20380699,Laura,"I chose to stay here as it was listed as a home of females, and I felt it would be safe as a young, solo female traveller. The window would not fully shut (and leads on to the street on the ground floor), there is no lock on the bedroom or bathroom, and most importantly there was a wooden sliding screen between the host's bedroom and another bedroom that means I could see into someone else's room and they could see into mine. I felt extremely unsafe and uncomfortable here, especially after the person in the room next door came home. It felt like they (a man and woman) were in the same room and they had loud sex, which made me also uncomfortable. The room itself was clean, but the bathroom was really dirty and out of toilet paper. I ended up feeling so unsafe that I left around midnight and had to find a hotel last minute. I also could not reach Air Bnb's phone line and have emailed and not heard back."
5160893,44134284,2015-08-24,2312609,Katrina,"Elisa has a lovely home located one block from Broadway in Capitol Hill, a great location for restaurants and shopping. The room is a good size and was nice and clean, with a comfortable bed. I didn't get a chance to meet Elisa but she kept in contact and passed on all the relevant info needed about the house and seems very friendly. 
Overall a pleasant experience! "
5160893,44429096,2015-08-26,11020372,Katherine,"Elisa was very gracious with our arrival and the room was just what we needed after a couple days backpacking. We had all the amenities we could want and the room served a great base for our short stay in Seattle. Elisa clearly puts a lot of intention into making her space welcoming for guests. Also, I must say the bed is one of the most comfortable I've slept on! Overall great short stay."
5160893,44673645,2015-08-28,39748748,Elizabeth,"I had a terrific first Airbnb experience at Elisa's place. The location - a stone's throw from Broadway, one of Capitol Hill's main commercial streets - was ideal for eating and shopping, and it's also a walkable distance from Pike Place Market and everything else most people will want to see downtown. Elisa's room was nicely decorated, clean and larger than the photo shows, with a very comfy bed. She provided helpful directions and recommendations (Oddfellows Cafe and its next-door neighbor Elliott Bay Books are fantastic!). But perhaps most importantly, Elisa and her crew are really nice people, and it was a pleasure to hang out with them. I highly recommend staying with her and hope to do so again myself. Thanks for everything, Elisa!"
5160893,45252732,2015-09-01,35569268,Emily,"Elisa's private room was just as described and more! It was exactly what my husband and I wanted for our trip to Seattle. The room was clean, fantastically decorated, and we even had towel and a welcome letter. She also provided a guest parking pass for the area, however we didn't need it as we could walk to everything we needed. Thank you Elisa!! "
5160893,45799553,2015-09-06,1142514,Logan,"Elisa gave us lots of information, was there to make sure we got in okay, and was such a great host. This room is even more beautiful in person, as is the entire house. She and her roommates made us feel very welcome and made sure we could get around well."
5160893,45930311,2015-09-07,33294832,Sandra,"Elisa's room was beautiful and tidy. The house was located in an awesome neighborhood with shops, cafes and bars super close by. Thanks for the great stay!"
5160893,46534416,2015-09-11,40518840,Timothy,"We had a great stay in this fun and unique space. Elisa and her roommate were very welcoming and helpful. Loved the soft, comfortable bed!"
5160893,47063341,2015-09-15,36861534,Caroline,Elisa's place was great! My sister and I had a great visit and it was super easy to check in and check out with Elisa. The place is in an awesome area and it's really easy to get around the city from there - we could even walk to all the tourist areas downtown like Pikes place. There are great restaurants and everything you need right around the apartment. Elisa was always easy to reach and super easy going. Also the bed is super comfortable! We had a great visit all in all and very happy with our accommodations.
5160893,47542770,2015-09-20,14310906,Marie,"T he rooms were exactly like described;
Elisa was the perfekt host and made me honestly feel welcome.
She helped me with any question I had about public transportation,
what was where and even drove me around town to places that were almost not possible for me to visit without a car of my own.
The place is very centrally located in the heart of Capitol Hills, an area I might call downtown Seattle, even though it is not really downtown.
There are lots of international places to eat, have coffee or a drink, grocerie store, book store, a library etc... all in walking distance.
The house of Elisa is one block away from the busy mile and quiet even in the daytime."
5160893,47791987,2015-09-21,323834,Shaun,"We had a great time at Elisa and Erin's place. The apartment was beautifully decorated and clean, and the hosts were lots of fun. I will definitely book on future trips to Seattle."
5160893,48043244,2015-09-22,44024541,Meghan,"Really cute room with great windows right in the heart of Capital Hill. As it is in the city, you can hear city noises, as Elisa mentions ... but we slept with the windows open and it was pleasant and not too loud (I am a city dweller, so not an overly light sleeper). The apartment was laid back and quiet, with great artwork by the ladies of the house. We were welcomed with a hand-written note and some organic honeycrisp apples, along with bath towels and an airbnb info sheet. Had a nice conversation with Erin in passing, who is personable, interesting, and friendly. We definitely enjoyed our stay, though it was brief. "
5160893,48918759,2015-09-29,41482654,Annelise,"What a lovely stay! This listing was just as described. Elisa and Erin's home is very conveniently located. The room was clean and very comfortable. Erin made us feel very welcome. All in all, an excellent stay and a great landing spot from which to explore the city. "
5160893,49183964,2015-10-01,15435546,Cara,"A great place to stay in a fantastic neighbourhood. Easy access to all Capitol Hill has to offer, and a short half hour walk to the city centre. 
Erin was a super-host. 

Stay here if you're visiting Seattle!"
5160893,50136260,2015-10-09,3504422,Heather,"Erin was terrific and helpful, very friendly, fun to talk to, and everything was easy with the room, check in/out. 
"
5160893,50502935,2015-10-12,43697461,Stefanie,"Check-in and out was very easy- the host was accommodating to my schedule and welcomed me with a delicious and fresh apple from her family's orchard.

They had shampoo/conditioner to use and the location is convenient (for city-types who like to walk) to downtown Seattle. "
5160893,50902407,2015-10-15,45655,Katie And Willsy,"Erin was super welcoming and really lovely. We loved the room and the whole place was full of Erin's awesome artwork and other cool things. Capitol Hill is an awesome area to be in, super easy to get to the touristy things by transport but walking distance to some great bars and shops."
5160893,50989468,2015-10-16,31392167,Jeremiah,Elisa (and her roommate Erin) were so welcoming and kind. They left me a nice note and didn't mind that I got held up in traffic and had to check in after my event instead of before as I had hoped. I can honestly say the room was as good or better then described and it was well set up and simple. 
5160893,51102558,2015-10-17,15537189,Kevin,I had a very good stay in this room. Elisa was super nice. Room was clean and cozy. It was my first night in Seattle and it was great spending it in this room. Elisa shared an Honey crisp apple which was amazing! All I can say is Five STAR stay.
5160893,51300217,2015-10-19,43279490,Jennifer,My hosts were very welcoming and kept in touch to ensure I safely made it to the listing and answered any questions I had. The listing was great and everything that I anticipated. They were very helpful with the area and gave me recommendations to the local areas on Capitol Hill. Very friendly and inviting. 
5160893,51767982,2015-10-24,45388105,Justin,"Elisa was out of town during my two night stay but Erin was a great hostess. Along with getting basically a free gallery show (the house is full of her awesome art) she gave me tons of great info on the city and recommendations. The house is literally around the corner from tons of bars, eateries, coffee shops, and a grocery store. Highly recommended this place for anyone visiting Seattle."
5160893,52734483,2015-11-01,5466387,Dominique,"The flat is located in a great neighborhood - quiet but just around the corner from many bars, restaurants and bus stops to downtown Seattle (~10-15min bus ride). Getting into the appartment went pretty smoothly and communication (via airbnb) has been excellent and prompt. The bed is very comfortable."
5160893,52996609,2015-11-03,46247541,Quinn,I loved staying here! It's a nice place to relax after adventuring all day. Elisa and Erin are both so nice and welcoming. The house is also super close to a bunch of bus stops and around a lot of cool food and coffee spots. 
5160893,53209077,2015-11-06,45929158,Emily,Elisa and her roommate Erin were wonderful hosts! This was my first experience with Airbnb and it was great. The space is beautifully decorated and both Elisa and Erin seem like really cool people. Highly recommend. 
5160893,53341415,2015-11-08,13709085,(email hidden),Cool room in nice location near Capitol hill. restaurants and bars near bye. Elisa was very friendly and was always easy to reach.

5160893,53993013,2015-11-15,43830934,Annalise,"Elisa's place is lovely, it's in a great location in Seattle's capital hill area, close to about a million places to eat and drink as well as some cool consignment stores. 
The house itself is clean and cosy, with a really comfy bed. 
"
5160893,54140992,2015-11-16,4358237,Joanna,"Lovely, clean space; easy bus access; beautiful art in home; very gracious host, even ended the stay by sharing wine and stories. Recommended. "
5160893,54282567,2015-11-17,7121219,Adrienne,"Very cool neighborhood and the host was very nice.  I would recommend staying here if you are more into local culture as opposed to touristy attractions, although those are just a short lyft or uber ride away.  We didn't stay terribly long, came in the evening, left very early for our flight, but it would have been great to stay longer."
5160893,54319182,2015-11-18,25973504,Kaytee,"My husband and I had so much fun visiting with Elisa! We only stayed for one night but she was so sweet and fun to talk to. She had homemade cookies that were delicious, and made us feel cozy and at home. An incredibly wonderful room with a comfy bed and amazing host. Her roommate was a sweetheart too! Lovely stay. "
5160893,54539363,2015-11-21,19190266,Lindsay,I had about a two minute introduction to the home and then was on my own.  The bed was super comfy and the room was spacious and decorated beautifully.  The art is AMAZING throughout the house!  Elisa had printed out a guest guide and was very helpful in checking in via text to make sure I was taken care of.
5160893,54714571,2015-11-23,45296266,Gabriella,"This apartment is absolutely adorable, and in an incredible location. Close to shopping, a wide selection of restaurants, and nightlife. Elisa and Erin made us feel right at home and check in/check out was extremely flexible. The halls are also all decorated with Erin's amazing artwork. I would absolutely stay again."
5160893,55027089,2015-11-27,48444212,Jenna,The room was exactly as described. The house has old charm with an artistic flare! Elisa was a great host!
5160893,55128291,2015-11-28,43975515,Karen,"Elisa is a great and responsible host. She responds to texts and emails very quickly and is passionate about answering our questions. The house is antique but nice. It is in a great neighborhood where there are markets, restaurants and bars. "
5160893,55463530,2015-12-01,19207239,Amruta,"The apartment is cozy and the art is beautiful and thought-provoking. All instructions were clearly laid out and when I had questions, Elisa answered them. Neighborhood seemed quiet, parking arrangement was sufficient for our needs and even though Erin was home at times, we were not disturbed at all. Space heater was sufficient to keep us warm and bed was comfortable. The room itself wasn't too clean though and the trash can in the bathroom was completely full. "
5160893,55682818,2015-12-04,39932687,Ashley,"I stayed at Elisa's place for one night. She and her roommate has a lovely apartment. They made everything super easy and are pet friendly. The place is in Capital Hill, very close to everywhere. I recommend this place very much. "
5160893,55747079,2015-12-05,27483614,Emily,"Super comfy bed in a charming home! Also super close to coffee shops, thrift stores, and restaurants. Not at all far from downtown Seattle.  "

5160893,56138746,2015-12-09,49221897,Kyle,"Was such an awesome place to stay. I'll admit as it was my first time doing Airbnb I didn't know the whole process, but Elisa made it easy to know what to do and answered all my questions. Would certainly go back there if I visit Seattle again! 

The place itself is really close to a bunch of shops and such in walking distance, and then only a block away from a Main Street where you can catch a bus! I highly recommend it :)"
5160893,56256717,2015-12-11,243529,Bill,"Elisa's place was fun. Cool, artsy roommate, we hung for a bit.. Nice neighborhood. Good bed, nice room."
5160893,57773503,2015-12-29,234121,Adam,Elisa invited us to stay in her shared apartment for 3 nights. The apartment is in a typical fourplex apartment in Seattle. The location can't be beat with great transportation and food / night options close by. It was a great opportunity to get an insight into how young professionals live in a very cool city in Seattle. 
3251069,14672387,2014-06-23,16102476,Cayce,"Kevin's basement apartment is beautiful. Easy parking and walking in the neighborhood. Kevin was easy to talk to, had great tips, but we also felt like we had our own space. "

3251069,37386037,2015-07-06,2020280,Mimi,"Kevin was an awesome host - he exceeded expectations for any Airbnb experience I've had. He picked us up to save us a long and expensive haul, and was friendly and helpful right from the get-go. Kevin's place is beautifully decorated and has a really authentically artistic feel to it. Our accommodations were perfect and the apartment was in the perfect location; Madrona is close to Lake Washington, a short walk from the coffee shops + restaurants of Capitol Hill, and a nice walk to Pike Place Market and Downtown. Kevin, himself, was really helpful in giving us suggestions on what to do based on what we wanted out of our stay in Seattle. He's a really cool guy with a ton of great interests, and he's totally ok with engaging or giving you more space, depending on what you prefer. Would 100% recommend staying with Kevin - we had an amazing time. Thank you!"
3251069,44164538,2015-08-24,5386725,Emily,"Kevin was a great host and incredibly flexible when our flight was delayed. The house is located near some of my favorite spots in Seattle, is both comfortable and beautiful, and (most importantly "

1599856,8031084,2013-10-13,9210576,Diane,"We rented this apartment because the price was right and it was close to Columbia City Theater, but we didn't realize just how close it was! It's literally steps from the main street. It's also a short drive (like 10-15 min.) to downtown Seattle. 

Joseph was a great host. He made recommendations for restaurants, made sure we were comfortable, and was available by text/phone if we needed anything. He even had a sign when we came in that said ""Welcome Home."" The apartment itself was perfect for me and my 3 friends. The kitchen came with pretty much every kitchen appliance, the apt was really clean, and we loved the fact that it had Wi-Fi and 2 separate bedrooms as well as a bathroom and living room. This place is great, whether you're a bunch of college students/friends (like us) or a family. We would stay here again in a heartbeat. I have nothing bad to say, and I can't recommend this place enough."
1599856,8246925,2013-10-21,1806034,Michael And Elisa,"Nice space, friendly host, fun and convenient neighborhood.  An altogether pleasant trip….I would certainly stay again…."
1599856,8390225,2013-10-28,4462117,Theodore,We had a very nice stay at 2.5 Blocks from Anywhere and it truly is the most centrally located for Columbia City that we've ever stayed at.  The apartment had everything we needed and our host's mom Dana came right away and let us in and was very welcoming.  We were very comfortable.
1599856,8680190,2013-11-11,9852947,Kristen,"Had a wonderful stay here! Loved the location, beautiful home, would recommend to anyone considering to stay! :)  "
1599856,8894497,2013-11-24,10181865,Mike,"We had a great stay! The apartment had more than enough room to accommodate the 4 of us and was in walking distance to the light rail to get downtown Seattle for our event. The host gave us detailed directions, provided us with information about the neighbourhood and made sure we had a comfortable stay."
1599856,8908461,2013-11-25,9793199,Nancy,"The location truly us 2.5 miles from anywhere. the condo unit is on a quiet street with 1 parking space. there was adequate street parking for vehicle #2.
the unit is tidy, cozy and welcoming. the beds were comfortable. the kitchen had everything we needed and more. we didn't cook, but we could have put together a nice meal given the cooking utensils provided. 
One comment to keep in mind: the privacy curtains are not black-out curtains, so if you are a light sleeper, you may chose to pack some eyeshades. 
back to location - this is a block from Rainier with many great restaurants and cafes to chose from so cooking not essential.
Its a lovely space, I didn't want to leave, I will stay here again. "
1599856,9012210,2013-12-01,791443,Long,"It was a great stay. Even though my group of 4 only stayed in Seattle for 1 day, the apartment was nice and cozy with everything we needed. The location was near plenty of shops if someone wanted to walk around the neighborhood passing traffic was minimal and quiet. We didn't get around to using the washer and dryer either, but the 2 beds and futon were great! This was also my first time booking through AirBnB, and I'm very happy with how everything went. Joseph and this location is definitely on my list if I'm ever in Seattle without a place to stay. Thank you very much for everything Joseph!

The apartment is clean and comfortable, equipped with linens, toiletries, kitchen supplies, and treats (coffee and chocolate!). We only stayed one night, but would happily plan a longer stay in the future."

The location was perfect for where we needed to be. The only problem was that there was a quite a bit of noise from the upstairs neighbors however it was new year's eve so perhaps that is unusual. 
We felt it was a great value for a 2 bedroom in Seattle."
1599856,9663238,2014-01-04,10759422,Myles,"Lovely flat which was very well stocked with all we needed including an excellent espresso machine and an interesting selection of books.  Would definitely recommend and would use again if I am in Seattle again.

Thanks Joseph!"
1599856,9693882,2014-01-05,7789689,Alan,"Joe was very responsive to my texts and was willing to work with me to arrange the keys. His place was very clean and cozy, accomdating 5 ppl easily. The location was great. I would definitely be wiling to stay here again if I return to Seattle"
1599856,9762499,2014-01-08,3056424,Brenna,"Joseph and the total experience of booking, finding, and lodging at 2.5 Blocks from Anywhere was fabulous! Really good communication at all points and the place was exactly as I expected. And the neighborhood of Columbia City is amazing! ;) "
1599856,9824108,2014-01-12,3097100,Devin & Michelle,The apartment was very nice. Very close to light rail and the CC Main Street. Big ups for the coffee and real cream. Would certainly stay there again. 
1599856,9971697,2014-01-22,2554443,Alice,"We had a great stay at Joseph's place; he and his mom were so helpful and responsive.  the place is perfectly located, you can walk to any one of Columbia City's restaurants and its great little movie theater, plus you can walk to the train.  The apartment itself is clean, cozy, warm; we were able to do a laundry when we needed to, no fuss about linens and plenty of towels.  The Huffords made everything easy.

Highly recommend!"
1599856,10041591,2014-01-27,4539642,Taylor,"2.5 Blocks from Anywhere was a great place to stay while on a short trip to Seattle. I stayed here with my fiance and two other couples over a weekend in late January.

The apartment was very comfortable and well appointed. They even had some great coffee there for us waiting in the freezer!

The location is perfect for taking in sights as it's out of the hussle and bustle of downtown, but close enough that you can get there in about 20 mins on public transit. There are tons of shops, bars, and other great spots just half a block away on Rainier street as well, so it's a win win. They even have a shelf of books you can read from and even take with you when you leave!

The only issue we had was with the heat which seemed to only come out of the vents in the living room, so if the bedroom doors were closed, it could get a bit chilly at night. 

All in all an awesome home base for a trip to Seattle. I'd definitely recommend it to friends."
1599856,10244792,2014-02-09,10730782,Carmiel,"I had a great stay here for a whole week with my coworker. The hosts were very quick to respond to any questions. The place was great and comfortable and close to everything Columbia City has to offer. The upstairs neighbors are a bit loud and affect the water pressure, but the hosts are in communication with them and looking into it. Loved staying here! Thanks!"
1599856,10587413,2014-02-26,2371955,Amr,"The place has a genius location in Seattle, a real house very close to a lot of restaurants and also to the train station, all are walkable conveniently. Joseph was busy at that time, but he delegated some other person who was very helpful and generous in cooperation. Our stay was too much pleasant and convenient. The neighbourhood was very calm and nothing had disturbed our sleep. The neighbors in the upper floor were hardly heard, and they were very calm and polit. The overall experience is perfectly great, I think I was too much accurate and lucky to have such a place and people, I definitely recommend it for whom seeking calm stay and tourist and also for business in the downtown. Thank you."
1599856,10679831,2014-03-03,8161035,Reagan,"Joseph (& his helpful mother, Dana) could not have provided a better experience! They were prompt and careful in replying to all questions, the apartment itself is adorable and completely stocked with anything you could need.  The neighborhood is great, the train truly is 2.5 blocks away and gives easy access to Seattle proper. I would definitely return! 
"
1599856,10844067,2014-03-10,6775804,Scott,"Top marks to this clean, comfortable, reasonably priced rental with easy airport access.  Columbia City is charming, a neighborhood I otherwise probably wouldn't have discovered, and bus and light rail to downtown, Capitol Hill and other central areas of Seattle are convenient.   If you intend to spend a lot of time in further north neighborhoods like Ballard and Fremont, though, the transit can be on the lengthy side, especially in off-peak hours.  We didn't do much more than sleep at the apartment but felt that the hosts were easily accessible if we had needed anything.  Highly recommended!"
1599856,11011138,2014-03-17,5256180,Destiny,"Cannot get a better location!

It was a quiet neighborhood and all the residents were cheerful and polite. We spent an equal amount of time between this home and venturing out to explore the city. It was a lovely reprise from some of the busy days we had. It is just as nice to stay in, make a french press (they have a couple of them), and read a book, as it was to go out and explore. 

Downtown Columbia City was a treat in itself. Go into town to have a coffee and excellent breakfast goodies at Columbia City Bakery. A rugged in town drinking well called the Hummingbird Saloon makes stiff drinks. Walgreens is down the main road for any items needed at the home front, plus Lottie's had a great brunch!

Beds and bedding were comfy with the apartment able to heat up and cool down very quickly. The kitchen was stocked with everything necessary for a meal and the coffee they left us was a nice touch. Neighbors upstairs were very easy going and down to earth. Washer & dryer beat out all the tough stains. There were tons of extra blankets, down comforters, towels, and linens for your hearts desire. 

Bring an extra book! There is a communal bookcase where you can leave behind a book and take another one with you. I ended up with a great read I had wanted to get my hands on for a while now! 

There is no need to rent a car here. The easiest public transportation I've ever used. $4.50 for an all day pass and it brings you right into the heart of Seattle. If you want, pay another $4.50 for a round trip pass on the monorail that takes you to Queen Anne were the EMP Museum and Space Needle are to name a couple of places!

The communication was quick and thorough. We were given a list of recommended places to go to right from the start, and any questions we had while staying at the property were answered quickly. Prompt, helpful assistance from everyone who helped us with the apartment. 

The price of this place is very reasonable for what you are getting (I personally think a steal), and it makes it that much better with the assistance we got, and the terrific town we were in. Will definitely stay here again when we come back!"
1599856,11274148,2014-03-27,11410669,Shannon,"Joseph's place was a cool little bottom floor apartment that accommodated the 4 of us well for our 3 nights. The heating worked well and the beds were comfy. 
The full feature laundry and kitchen are great if you need them and there was plenty of little extras for your use such as toiletries and condiments. There is however no TV so if thats what your into beware of that.
The highlight of the place is the location, 2minute walk to the main drag in Columbia City which has a plethora of drinking and dining options from literally every cuisine imaginable, its also  an easy 8 minute walk to the light rail to take you into the city or airport.
Joseph also is very knowledgeable about the district and provides plenty of literature on good places to go whilst on your stay.
Would definitely recommend
 "
1599856,11331307,2014-03-30,5114607,Ayush,"Cute place in a great neighborhood. Dana called to take care of us and make sure everything was all right--very sincere and helpful. Had a few road bumps with some ants and a broken dishwasher, but Dana was very attentive. Would recommend"
1599856,11666235,2014-04-11,3016630,Antoinette,"Had a great stay right in the heart of Columbia City! It's a vibrant town and Joseph's place is literally two blocks from anything you might need/want! The two bedrooms actually have more light than it might seem in the pictures and everything was exactly what I needed for my stay (also didn't need a car at all!). So grateful to Dana and Joseph for being such great, caring (but not overbearing!) hosts. "
1599856,11800968,2014-04-15,11560012,Sarah,This is a great spot close to lots of great restaurants. Great communication with hosts. House was clean and very true to pictures. We enjoyed our stay and would return if in the Seattle area again. Thank you Joseph and Dana!
1599856,11878818,2014-04-17,14022601,Eric,"Joeseph has a nice place.  Clean, well appointed,  diverse library and awesome location.  He was great about communicating with me and flexible with meeting plans.  Overall an easy and enjoyable experience!"
1599856,12243604,2014-04-27,10416310,Timothy,"Wonderful hosts. Easy, clean, comfy, crows (you'll understand later). Would  recommend and stay again."
1599856,12268998,2014-04-28,4405521,Lorraine & Ray,"Great location!  I think it was more like 1.5 blocks (vs 2.5 blocks) from the train station and the little downtown area with lots of nice restaurants and shops.

The apartment was very well equipped, though we didn't really need to use much of it as we only stayed for 1 night.  Four of us fit very comfortably; cozy, which was really nice, yet the 2 bedrooms allowed for privacy.

I'd highly recommend this place if you want to stay in Seattle but want to avoid the exorbitant hotel rates downtown.  

 "
1599856,12890559,2014-05-13,1143365,Karla,"LOCATION LOCATION LOCATION

Like all other reviews stated before me, this was a great place to stay at. It was a great location, easily accessible from the airport & downtown Seattle, and most important check in/out flexibility. The apartment was nice, cozy, and clean. Joseph's mother, Dana, stayed in contact with my mother in law and was very quick to respond. Even though we didn't walk around late at night, the location was safe and quiet. Overall, we had a great experience staying at Joseph's place. When you have a good location, very good price, great reviews, and a home away from home, you can't beat that! "
1599856,12993780,2014-05-16,6416312,Oriana,"Prefect place for our stay! Joseph accommodated us at such short notice and late night arrival, the keys in the lockbox was convenient. Upon entering the sheets from one of the bedrooms and the futon were pulled as if they were going to be replaced/cleaned. The apartment was not ready for our arrival, but luckily there were clean sheets and blankets in the closets. We weren't too put off by it. I'll chalk it up to miscommunication as they mentioned they did not expect our arrival until the next day. The rest of the place was nicely kept. We did not make use of public transit near by but everywhere we needed to go was within a 15min drive. 4 of us stayed more than comfortably for 2 nights, definitely will return when in Seattle again. Thank you Joseph!"
1599856,13418679,2014-05-27,12732119,Leslie,host met us at the house.  Although it was 2.5 blocks from anywhere you need to take public transportation 15 minute to downtown to be anywhere.
1599856,13613977,2014-06-01,14241355,Helen,"Joseph was able to accommodate our request for an earlier check-in, which we were grateful for.  The place was spacious for the three of us, and it really felt like a home away from home.  Without a car, we were able to easily access the light rail from the place, and we were only a block away from the lovely restaurants and coffee shops of Columbia City.  I recommend this place for any looking to enjoy a respite in Seattle. "
1599856,13883181,2014-06-07,14950343,Betty,"My family of four had an awesome stay at Joseph's place. It had all the ammenities needed for a weeks stay, full kitchen, comfortable beds and lots of reading materials, games and puzzles. The location is fantastic, so close to the light rail system and easily accessible by car from main highways. They graciously accommodated our early check, Joseph's mom Dana came, showed us the property and answered questions.  After that we had 5 nights and 6 days of fun, fun, fun.  We love Seattle and Joseph's place.  Also, the neighborhood restaurants are a short walk away, plenty of variety, and the ones we went to were great. This was truly a great way to celebrate my 50th birthday."
1599856,14003782,2014-06-09,16398348,Moritz,"Joseph's apartment is really nice, clean and silent. 
We were 5 people and could easily fit in this place. The neighborhood is also great. The public transportation is nearby and the parking is free. 
It's the perfect spot to stay if you want to explore Seattle!"
1599856,14085972,2014-06-11,86226,Emily,"While we didn't get to meet Joseph, he was very clear in communicating and let us pick up the keys in a lock box when we were delayed getting to our meeting time.  The apartment was clean and quiet but we hardly got to use it because there were many cute restaurants and bars on the main strip of Columbia City we wanted to try.  Getting to/from downtown or the airport was very convenient via the light rail so it is a great place to stay if you want to get away from the more touristy side of Seattle."
1599856,14344888,2014-06-17,13166372,Stephanie,"Perfect for our girls weekend getaway! Both Joseph and his mother were great hosts! We arrived in the evening and were greeted at the apartment by Joseph's mother, Dana! The Columbia City neighborhood was very quaint and friendly. Dana had lots of great recommendations for restaurants in the area and provided great info for the rail hours. The place was very clean and welcoming and just as it appeared in the pictures. We didn't nearly have enough time to do the things we wanted to do in Seattle and would come back and stay here again, in a heartbeat!! Great place!"
1599856,14568021,2014-06-22,15876315,Jordan,"This place was great! Had everything we needed and lots of space. Kitchen had tons of dishes and appliances. Joseph was easy to get in touch with and very helpful about exploring the area. Everywhere we ate was within walking distance and tasty! When we come back, we will definitely stay here again!"
1599856,14736696,2014-06-25,14229888,Brenda,"Great place to stay. Joseph and Dana were very helpful with lots of information about the area, and they made us feel very welcome. The location is great, only a few minutes walk to the light rail transit system which goes into downtown Seattle. Half a block to many great restaurants and pubs. We parked our vehicle in the driveway when we arrived and then were able to use public transport to get around the city, very easy and convenient. Will definitely stay again if we are back in Seattle."
1599856,15026495,2014-07-01,4928304,Rhea,"We had a great 6 day stay at Joseph's place with our two little kids! It was truly perfectly positioned, a short walk from the light rail and from the adorable downtown area of Columbia City. The place itself was nice and clean, with two full beds and space in the living room for us to set up the portable crib we brought with us. We weren't able to meet Joseph, but his mom Dana stopped by to make sure we had everything we needed. This was one of if not the best airbnb experiences we've had and we hope to stay again if we find ourselves in Seattle. Also, this is a great place to stay with kids as there is a playground across the street as well as around the corner, and beautiful Seward Park is just a short drive away."
1599856,15528389,2014-07-11,14339584,Jenny,"We had a great time staying at this apartment. Very comfortable and user friendly, equipped with all the necessary supplies for a home-like experience. Joseph's mother, Dana, came over the first day to give us some basic info, and one night we even came home to find some children's books waiting for us! It was a very comfortable size for me, my husband, and our 3-year-old, who enjoyed having his own bedroom. The kitchen is easy to cook in. It is on a cute little residential street that's truly convenient to a lot of things. In one direction you get the cool businesses on Rainier Ave., where we had breakfast at the Columbia City Bakery (fantastic croissants!) more than half the days we were there, and pizza at Tutta Bella on our first night in town. The house is also right across the street from a playground. In the other direction there's the light rail stop, which was a really easy way to get downtown, and to Seattle Center (via the monorail), with a little kid. We were in town for a wedding weekend where many of the festivities took place in South Seattle, and those locations took less than 10 minutes to drive to. The master bedroom gets a lot of sunlight in the morning. Some nighttime noise from the upstairs neighbors walking around, but you get used to it. The only improvements I'd suggest would be a more conveniently located bathroom light switch (it's on the hinge side of the door, outside the bathroom, so you can't reach it from inside the door), and more shelves or drawers to put your clothes. Overall a very nice place to stay, and friendly hosts!"
1599856,15748536,2014-07-15,501716,Glenn,"We (family of 4) stayed at Joseph's place for 3 nights, and we can report that all was as advertised--especially charming was the multicultural and just plain cool neighborhood.  

We were even allowed to check in early (back from a cruise early in the morn) and check out late (late flight).  Also, the hosts left a full bag of coffee beans to grind.  Nice touch. 

All  in all, to be recommended."
1599856,16016717,2014-07-20,16407083,Nick,Apartment was really spacious and location was excellent - easy tram to both downtown and airport.  The neighbourhood was great - lots of bars / restaurants within easy walking distance.  Joseph is a great host - made me feel really welcome after a long flight.  I recommend staying here!

1599856,16345239,2014-07-26,15669124,Angie,"Just great! Very responsive and helpful hosts, excellent apartment that suited our family of four (two adults, a teen and a tween) just right. We have deep roots in Columbia City and loved being in the middle of our old stompin' grounds! Also the beds were super-comfy. Will be back for sure. "
1599856,16477449,2014-07-28,2547986,Chaz,This listing was an awesome place. So close to everything and very clean. We hope to visit again in the future. 
1599856,16993018,2014-08-05,17167565,Dana,"Joseph was a great host and easy to get ahold of.  The apartment was just as described and close to the subway line into downtown.  There were a lot of pamphlets and maps about Seattle so those were a great reference.  The neighborhood was nice too.  There were quite a few bars, restaurants, and shops within a very short walk.  "
1599856,17147095,2014-08-08,1277900,Laurianne,"Logement très propre et très bien aménagé, parfait pour notre groupe de 6. Bien situé par rapport au centre ville de Seattle, dans un quartier calme. Joseph et Dana se sont montrés très accessibles et chaleureux. Je recommande :)"
1599856,17428468,2014-08-12,632262,Jordan,"Great place, great neighborhood.  Plenty of space, just as described.  Hosts are available for any questions or recommendations.  I would definitely stay again!"
1599856,17552669,2014-08-14,4028896,Barry,"Communication with Joseph was fast, friendly, and very helpful. The place was just as advertised - clean and comfortable, with lots of reading material (both Seattle-specific and wide-ranging fiction and non-fiction). The maps of local establishments were particularly appreciated. The heart of Columbia City is a block away, with endless culinary possibilities. We also took the Light Rail to downtown Seattle to a Mariners game, again very convenient and quick. Lake Washington and Mercer Island are also a short bike ride away, and there is a bike shop just down the street. Next time I plan a trip to Seattle, the first place I'm going to check is Joseph's, and hope he isn't completely booked."
1599856,17687465,2014-08-16,17311455,John,"In a word, great. Joseph was helpful and flexible. Thanks for a great stay!"
1599856,18169967,2014-08-23,12815069,Reuben,"We had a very enjoyable experience staying here.  The place was as described, in fact even better.  Good internet connection and an ample kitchen.  Joe and his mother were gracious hosts, with quick response times, and willing to go above and beyond to help us out.  The location was as described, near the light rail and walking distance from some nice areas and restaurants.   Overall, our small group was very pleased and would definitely stay here again."
1599856,19279030,2014-09-09,19750748,Joy,"Great location and the apartment was charming.  Beds slept comfortably.  Kitchen well stocked with everything needed to cook.  Lots of restaurants very close by.  Light rail 2 blocks away and a great way to travel.  So glad we cancelled our downtown hotel and stayed here.  Did not get to meet Joseph, but did meet his mother, Dana.  She was very helpful I getting us settled.  "
1599856,19392581,2014-09-11,19245658,Michael,"What a nice place to stay!!!
Joseph did everything to feel comfortable at his home and welcomed us very warmly by providing some maps of the surroundings, which helped us to find a restaurant in the close area. We arrived very late, but that was no problem. The flat is very clean, looking exactly like the pictures promised and is perfect for 4 to 6 persons, additionally there is a washing tube and a dryer. We haven't met Joseph during our stay for 2 nights, but he gave me very helpful informations by phone. His mother wanted to welcome us, but unfortunately we haven't been there, when she planned to see us. Probably we will meet the next time, because it is a wonderful place to stay in Seattle with lots of different italian, american, indian, chinese, greek restaurants nearby and a famous bakery to get a delicious breakfast there. Additionally a public transport stop is very close to get to downtown. (lasts about 25 minutes)
We definitely recommend it to further guests."
1599856,19729154,2014-09-17,18644475,Spencer,"The location in Columbia City is outstanding with easy access to light rail and bus service. There are excellent restaurants, coffee shops and a bakery close by. While there is a Walgreen's pharmacy within a 15 minute walk, there is no supermarket located conveniently nearby. This was a negative. The duplex was well equipped with working wifi, but there was no tv. It would have been nice to have one to watch the news. The hosts responded promptly to our questions. I would recommend this location to Seattle visitors."
1599856,19841329,2014-09-19,20873542,Ryan,"This apartment was a great place to stay for our trip to Seattle! We felt very welcome the entire time we were there, and the place was very close to downtown. Joseph was helpful and quick to respond to questions, and his mom Dana stopped by to make sure everything was going good. We were also very close to a street with a ton of restaurants, and a nice farmer's market was just a street over. I would definitely stay here again if I go back to Seattle, thanks Joseph and Dana for the hospitality! "
1599856,20091773,2014-09-23,12219829,Jessica,The house was perfect! Joseph and Dana were so helpful and responded very quickly to any questions we had. The house was very clean and walking distance to very good restaurants.  We will absolutely be staying here the next time we come to Seattle. Thank you Joseph and Dana!
1599856,20188825,2014-09-25,5714166,Jill,"One of the things I love about Air BnB is that you get to stay in places with personality, and this place had a lovely personality.  Really felt like a home, with a great personal welcome from Joseph and a wide variety of coffee making methods and ingredients provided.  Columbia City is a lovely area and extremely well served by restaurants so I didn't even bother looking for a grocery store.  Geraldine's for breakfast is recommended. There's also a farmers market Wednesdays from 3pm.  The place is a bit out of the centre, but close to the light rail and you're anywhere in town in around 15 minutes.  A perfect choice if you're coming in and out of the airport.  Highly recommended and I'm sorry my stay wasn't longer."
1599856,20491452,2014-09-30,16905466,Leigh,"Joseph and his mother were great to work with. They tried to stop by to meet us a couple of times, but we were out every time. We didn't spend a lot of time at the house because it was our first time in Seattle and we had lots of exploring to do. We were also in town for a wedding so we were pretty busy. 
The photos of the house are accurate and the space was nice. We had plenty of blankets, towels, etc. We didn't need anything, but Joseph and his mom offered to help if we did need anything. 
As other people mentioned, we could hear the renter above us, but it didn't bother us. We felt guilty for talking too loud or making noise when she/he was sleeping, but we couldn't figure out their schedule.
We really liked the location. It was really close to the light rail and you could see the little main street from the house. We ate at Geraldine's twice and liked Empire coffee and sandwiches! We thought the street that the house was on was precious. The little houses were cute and it felt safe. We had a couple of Seattle locals (who live in other neighborhoods) tell us that Columbia City was dangerous or sketchy, but we never got that vibe. Overall we liked the house and loved the price! "
1599856,20611588,2014-10-02,16225985,Hyungseok,"The best thing of this place is that it is easy to get to the downtown in Seattle. And his mother, Dana, is so considerate and helpful. And the house is cozy and quiet.
I also like his quick response."
1599856,20903420,2014-10-07,20236400,Connie,The house was nice. But I had a hard time reaching the host. Not easy to communicate with. 
1599856,21057093,2014-10-10,6228567,Louise,"Joe and Dana were great hosts and communication was quick and helpful. The house is in a great location, close to shops and light rail which is the easiest way to downtown. Also, Lake Washington Boulevard is a lovely walk to see the water. I would highly recommend staying at Joe and Dana's. "
1599856,21285041,2014-10-14,5121143,Kelly,First time airbnb user and our stay was fantastic. We spent most of our time traveling around Washington & Canada that when we really appreciated coming back to a spot that was so cozy and home like. 
1599856,21582490,2014-10-20,19861638,Toni,"There was a nice welcome on the board, pretty flowers on the table,  and a personal and timely meeting with Dana for other information.   The house was as advertised, very clean and comfortable.  We are familiar with Columbia City and the location is great for walking access to restaurants and other businesses in Columbia City.    

Thank you.  "

1599856,21959453,2014-10-27,1605575,Jan,"Loved it, loved it!  Our family of three adults stayed two nights. We would have stayed longer but the apartment was fully booked,  which we understand having had the pleasure of staying there. Absolutely everything for a comfortable stay has been thoughtfully provided. Everything is of a high quality standard, Including organic bsthroom products. Was wonderful having access to a washing machine and dryer. Joseph's mother met us at the apartment and talked us through the neighborhood. Columbia city business district with it's great restaurants just a few steps away snd light rail into the city at the end of the street. Particularly recommend Watercress  for Vietnamese food. Would love to stay again. T V addicts should note, there is none, but we're readers so of no consequence to us."
1599856,22115105,2014-10-30,16525459,Garry,The apartment is well maintained with one off street parking.  Nice neighborhood with restaurants/sports bar within 3 blocks. The only negative I experienced is that the beds are at floor level.  The mattress within the Ikea bed frame is not raised off the floor.
1599856,22300053,2014-11-03,17522610,Jerry,"The host was very welcoming, and the neighborhood was safe! We did not get a rental car, and it was not a far walk at all to the nearest light rail station. There is one full size bed, one queen, and one futon in the living room. The space is fairly small, a bit crammed for 4 people. Shower water pressure was low. We needed a home base to go back to sleep mostly so it worked out for us, this is not a place you would throw parties. Be prepared in Washington because it rains a lot! Don't forget warm clothes and an umbrella."
1599856,22459794,2014-11-07,1784778,Chris,"We LOVED our stay in Seattle, and this apartment was perfect base from which we could go exploring. Columbia City has a really fun vibe and is only a few tram stops from both downtown Seattle and the airport. Clean, tidy, welcoming, spacious, everything we could have hope for. And although we didn't meet Joseph, he was super helpful via email too. Would definitely recommend!!"
1599856,22577751,2014-11-10,2109905,Catherine,"Joseph's AirBnB was the perfect place for my group of five to spend a long weekend while attending an old friend's wedding. Although we were initially drawn to the listing because of its proximity to the wedding venue, it turned out to be super convenient for getting to and from the airport and also heading downtown to take in some sights. It really is 2.5 blocks from anywhere because of the train, which is super cheap and fast and runs regularly, and the apartment was totally set up with everything we could have needed. Didn't get a chance to do much cooking in the well set-up kitchen or use the laundry facilities but over a longer stay, those would have been great amenities. I also loved being around the corner from the main strip in historic Colombia City which was a new area in Seattle for me and I was happy to find some great eateries. 

Joseph was readily available via email/cell to answer any questions and I liked the helpful maps and books that were left for guests in the apartment.

As this is a downstairs apartment, you got a little residual noise from the upstairs residents walking around late at night, so maybe bring earplugs. Wasn't a dealbreaker."
1599856,22850828,2014-11-16,3066031,Ammon,"This place was great and located right next to a small downtown. Joseph had a list of places to visit with great local food. 

Beds were comfortable. The place is not a great a place to hang out for the day because of the size, but is a great place to crash and located to close to everything. "
1599856,23204633,2014-11-25,20991452,Sean,"Myself and 3 family members loved this place.  It was a great place to use as a base; clean, comfortable and warm.  Excellent location in part of Seattle that I had never been and I really liked.  Proximity to the light rail was the reason I picked this place and it was exactly as advertised, and made our multiple ventures out very easy.  I would definitely recommend this place.  "
1599856,23424850,2014-12-01,6932933,Harry,"Very streamlined process. We arrived quite late, and they way joe set it up it was easy to get settled. Well stocked kitchen with equipment, pots and pans and knives. 

The location is great and close to a hip and commercial street.

Only thing is what other have mentioned already, which is the shower pressure is low, and it is a first floor apartment.

Would totally recommend for a stay."
1599856,24000438,2014-12-16,7039394,Ines,"Joseph was a great host even though we only met his mother Dana. Everything was as described and the location is great. We drove only 20mins with the car to downtown. The apartment was clean, cozy and the beds were really comfortable. Would stay there again and recommend it to everyone! Thanks for everything ;-)"
1599856,24229360,2014-12-23,17952261,Serena,"We absolutely loved Joseph's place!! The house was clean, comfortable, and has everything you needed. The location is great, easy to get to Seattle either by car or light rial. The kitchen was fully equipped, definitely a plus if you wish to prepare food during your trip!!  We were greeted by Joseph's mom, Dana. Such a lovely lady, easy to communicate with and made sure we had a good stay! Highly recommend their place if you are looking for a place to stay Seattle!!"
1599856,24416585,2014-12-28,23396844,Ronna,"We had a lovely time here and liked both the accommodations and the neighborhood. We enjoyed checking out the local diner, Geraldine's, for breakfast and amazing bakery and even took a yoga class -- all one block away. The space itself worked just fine for our family of four: We had one parent and kid in one room and another parent and kid in the other. We liked that there was no TV but plenty of books and even played a game of University of Washington Monopoly!
We would recommend this as a great home base for exploring Seattle."
1599856,24571957,2014-12-30,10901737,Nathan,The unit was the perfect size for our group. It was great having two separate bedrooms. It was clean and very comfortable for our weekend visit to Seattle. It was very close to transit and walkable to a few bars and restaurants but we were glad to have a car to make trips into downtown Seattle. 
1599856,24934802,2015-01-04,18813957,Jessica,"Great place to stay in the Seattle area!  A 15 minute drive to Pike Place, and located just steps away from a cute street with bakeries, bars & restaurants.  The apartment has all the amenities you need while staying away from home."
1599856,25349436,2015-01-13,8377632,Claire,"We didn't meet joe, but the apartment was awesome! Close to the airport and an easy to get to downtown Seattle on the light rail. They provided great information about the local area and we thoroughly enjoyed breakfasts at Geraldine's. It was a great few days in Seattle! "
1599856,25815918,2015-01-26,10685749,Jin,Great place! The house had everything that was needed was clean and comfortable
1599856,26132275,2015-02-04,6072848,Martha,"We stayed here in Joseph's sweet apartment for 5 nights while we were attending a workshop that was down near the airport. The apartment was very well situated for traveling anywhere in Seattle. We went from SeaTac to Mercer Island to Ballard to Greenlake to Pioneer Square quickly and easily! Then we could come back to our clean, quiet, warm and well appointed space. There is a business district 1 block away where there are many restaurants to choose from as well as shops and bars. This space served us well. The beds are very comfortable, the kitchen has everything you need and I was surprised by how quiet it was at night. I live in the Boondocks of Eastern Washington and I always have trouble sleeping in loud, busy cities, but  not here! I hope to book this apartment again the next time I travel to Seattle. Thank you Joseph!!"
1599856,26295577,2015-02-09,2554443,Alice,"Joseph and Dana were kind and helpful as ever. The place is welcoming, well stocked, an obviously sharing and hospitable group of friendly people.  Attentive and responsive."
1599856,26672185,2015-02-17,7845706,Liz,"Joseph and Dana were great hosts. The apartment was very homey, had great interior design, and everything we needed. It was located in a great spot for us with coffee shops and restaurants nearby. It was also very close to where we need to be for our conference. Both of them were very responsive to our texts and checked in on us to make sure everything was ok. We had a great stay!"
1599856,27437048,2015-03-04,9860881,Derek,"Joseph was great host, and his place in Columbia City was the perfect spot from which to explore Seattle.  My best Airbnb experience yet.  "
1599856,28042966,2015-03-16,9233684,Cassie,"We had an excellent time! Joe was very helpful and flexible with our check in. His mom stopped by to say hello, give tips and answer any questions. The place itself was very nice and had everything we needed, the beds were super comfortable! It was in a great location close to the light rail to get downtown. I have nothing but good things to say about the place and host :)"
1599856,28236209,2015-03-20,16726885,Jane,It was a great space for myself and friend to stay while studying in Seattle for the week. The place was clean and homey. I would stay there again.
1599856,28337284,2015-03-22,8338062,Ivy,"It's a warm & cozy place to stay during the raining season in Seattle. House is clean with everything there. Close walk to light rail also lots of shops and bars just around the corner. We did not see Joseph in person, but he is being helpful. Thank you Joseph. We had a nice stay."
1599856,28571957,2015-03-26,28724428,Karen,"The listing was very accurate, the house was 2 blocks away from the restaurants and stores. The house itself was clean. Thank you for providing a lot of clean towels for us. The space was comfortable and cozy. It was a great first airbnb experience, thanks to the hosts. I'll be using airbnb again. "
1599856,33767224,2015-06-01,26164758,Wendy,"
This is a great location -- walking distance to many fine restaurants and night spots, as well as the Link into the city or down to SeaTac. The space is very accommodating -- lots of linens, towels, cooking utensils, everything you could need for an extended stay. And the hosts ... well, they were magnificent, from providing things and information, to letting me back in after I locked myself out, to cleaning up after me after I left. And very friendly, helpful, and generally welcoming and pleasant. A great place to stay and great people (and the upstairs neighbors are nice too!)"
1599856,34071625,2015-06-04,32641083,Phoebe Chui Ching,Joe is very kind to greet us at the house and makes sure that everything is okay. The house was nice and the location is excellent.
1599856,34399571,2015-06-08,25368814,Nicole,Friendly and helpful greeting and introduction. Comfortable place to stay in a great location. We had a great weekend. Thanks.
1599856,34942985,2015-06-14,29596390,Margarita,"We had a great time, the place is convenient, close to shops and restaurants. Very clean and it has all you need, enough supply of towels and bedding needs. 
Thank you Joseph and Dana"
1599856,35385001,2015-06-18,3666331,Xiaoxi,"We didn't get to meet Joseph during our stay, but we kept in touch by messages before arrival. Joseph's mom Dana stopped to say hi, and provided us some useful information about nearby grocery stores. Also when we got some problems unlocking the door, she was very patient and helpful in the phone, telling me what to do. It is a nice place for a family to stay. We enjoyed cooking in the kitchen, which saved a lot of money. Overall, Joseph's place has made our vacation in Seattle a quite satisfying one."
1599856,35566615,2015-06-20,33112861,Rachel,"The location: transitional and quiet after dark, but within walking distance to restaurants and bars, and LINK in the other direction.
The apartment: Cute and mostly well-kept (but please see below)
The hosts: Jo and his girlfriend (I'm sorry, I don't know your name) were very accommodating. She went out of her way so our family could get into the apartment an hour early. 

If that was it, I'd give the space a 4 or 5. Sadly, the apartment has fleas. I know this can happen to anyone, so in a month or so, the apartment should be safe again (if it's treated properly). We stayed only for 2 nights, as planned. After the first night, I noticed bites on my feet (by the time I left, I had around 20 on my feet); the evening of the second night I began to see them everywhere: kitchen, bathroom, both (website hidden) admitted that a prior guest (some time ago) had animals w/fleas but said no one has mentioned anything. These fleas were tiny, maybe the apartment was treated once and only eggs were left; now the eggs have (website hidden) and his girlfriend came over promptly to change the linens and check in with us. We spent our last morning in Seattle laundering and bagging our clothes instead of taking in a few more sights like we had planned. 

We were 45 minutes late getting out of the apartment. Just as we drove out (parking on the street so my 3  kids and I could walk to our first meal of the day at Geraldine's), Dana drove in. I'm sure under normal circumstances, she's a perfectly lovely person. She kind of waved me down, and after handshakes/introductions, she said ""Let me educate you about fleas."" What ensued was a not very coherent, defensive ""education"" about how fleas don't choose people as hosts, which she interpreted to mean that they can't survive on human blood (false) and I didn't need to wash all my things because they don't travel on you (mostly false). When I argued her ""facts"" she'd say things like ""What do you want from me? I can't give you your morning back. I can't take the bites off your feet."" I didn't start the conversation. We simply left. 

I tried to remain matter of fact and courteous throughout this whole fleas thing, but stopping a single mom and her three kids in the street to have this odd and ill-informed ""conversation"" after a stressful morning and no meals...that last experience was just too much. My last day in Seattle was a huge disappointment, and made me late for a commitment on the other side of the (website hidden) refunded around 1/3 of my money, which I never asked for but do appreciate. I'll probably spend it on flea prevention for my pets at home in case we brought anything back."
1599856,35910474,2015-06-23,19807223,Paul,"My wife's 2 sisters and she had a fabulous time in Seattle due in no small part to Joseph's accommodations. It was fabulous complete with fresh locally roasted coffee beans waiting to be ground and brewed! They found it easy to use the light rail and it was so efficient to get to and from the airport and to downtown Seattle. The business district a block away is exceptional. Joseph had everything they needed and more. It was extremely comfortable for them. They enjoyed the bird theme, the wide variety of books and numerous pieces of information about Seattle and Columbia City. I'm rather envious of their visit and hope to stay there with my wife some time."
1599856,36924389,2015-07-02,36071482,Joe,"Joseph welcomed us to the unit and gave us a tour when we arrived. The description of the unit was accurate, although it was a bit of a tight squeeze for five guests. Four guests would fit a bit more comfortably. A two minute walk to the Light Rail allowed us to get downtown with ease, and there were a lot of great shops and restaurants in the immediate surrounding area as well."
1599856,37547465,2015-07-08,25546732,Marc,"Joe's place was wonderful. There were four of us on a family vacation: my sister, my parents and I. Joe's futon and two bedrooms suited us perfectly. Joe was the best host, even springing for a fan in the warmer than average Seattle summer when we visited. The location can't be beat, with the vibrant Columbus City neighborhood right around the corner. And getting into downtown Seattle is a cinch.

We loved our stay and would stay here again, no question."
1599856,37861441,2015-07-11,34025538,Morten,"We had a very nice time 2.5 blocks from anywhere!

Our host was there to great us and personally make sure that we came in OK.

The description of the place is accurate and the kitchen is fully equipped, so that you can make a real meal there. A nice thing, when you need a break from hotels and airlinefoods. "
1599856,38105703,2015-07-13,30231226,Jolanda,"Nice spot near a street where you can eat anything you like. House is nice, you can even take a book with you. The house was a bit smaller than expected but good enough for a family of four. You can park your car in front of the house. Thank you for let us stay at your house Joe"
1599856,38398232,2015-07-15,28848721,Yong,"房子位置不错，离高速公路不远，到塔科马机场20来分钟车程。
房东很友好，我们到达已经是晚上10点，她还专门过来给我们讲解垃圾分类的要求，还提供了各种地图及坐车指南。"
1599856,39487117,2015-07-24,12735691,Mike,"A great stay in a great neighborhood in a great town. The home is warm and cozy and was perfect to put us parents in one bedroom and our 5- and 2-year-old in the other bedroom. As advertised, it's a fun neighborhood perfect for walking, eating, playing. Couldn't be happier. Owners were helpful and responsive but not the slightest bit intrusive."
1599856,39912597,2015-07-27,30354751,Jim,"2.5 blocks  from Anywhere says it all.  Could have stayed the whole weekend just exploring and sampling food/drink in the neighborhood, but we were there for the ball games. LRT was just up the street to get to the stadium and go downtown, perfect.  meeting up with Joseph was quick and easy, pretty straight forward for the apt. and it was clean and functional with great local fair to support us including a new natural foods store one block over.  Apt. is clean and comfortable as described.  Would definitely use it again if in Seattle."
1599856,40202899,2015-07-29,29041688,Franck,"Logement agréable situé dans un quartier calme.Pas très grand pour 5 personnes mais pour 2 nuits c était bien. Les commerces et restaurants sont proches c est intéressant. 
"
1599856,40563232,2015-08-01,10946299,Felicity,Great location. We walked with our suitcases from light rail. We spent the full day downtown so didn't spend much time in the apartment. It looked like it had all the essentials for cooking etc. 
1599856,40917635,2015-08-03,341501,Connie,Easy communication and conveniently located space. Taking the light rail was easy and great eateries around the area. Close to the sea fair. The unit was a bit smaller than expected.
1599856,41924676,2015-08-10,30159178,James,"To put it briefly, this place is flat out amazing. 

Our stay involved going in and out of downtown daily via LightRail which was only a two block walk and when we didn't go into the city, there was more then enough going on down the main street (about only a block away) to keep us occupied and full of food. 

The tenant was there to meet and greet our group as we showed up and give advice to some of the local hotspots and eateries just down the street including a new market that was opened right around the corner. 

The house is just as it is described and shown in the listing. A smaller downstairs apartment with 2 bedrooms and a fold-out in the living room. Even with 4 larger guys, there was enough space for us all to sit together and discuss the days events each evening.  

There is no TV, but there are lots of books to read and WiFi is available so be sure to have a laptop or tablet with you if you feel like you need some visual entertainment while you are there (Hulu, Netflix, etc.) 

There are very few words that I can use with my limited vernacular to express how satisfied I am with my stay here so I guess I will end this review just as I opened it: To put it briefly, this place is flat out amazing."
1599856,42520305,2015-08-14,4567440,David,"Joseph's place was exactly what my three friends and I were looking for. It is clean, cozy, had a nice sized kitchen for cooking with all necessary cooking ware, and it was an incredibly good value. The location is excellent too. It really is about 2.5 blocks from the light rail which can take you anywhere in Seattle. Ranier street, which is a block away, also has tons of restaurants, bars and fun stuff to visit. I would highly recommend staying here, but do note the square footage because it might not be large enough for a large family. We easily fit four people comfortably (one couple and two single men). Thanks Joseph!"
1599856,43025612,2015-08-17,4653545,Madeleine,"We had a lovely stay in Joseph's apartment. The area is great, transport links fantastic and communication with him was excellent. It is a bit of a squeeze for five people - you can't sit round the table because there are not enough chairs, but if you are eating out all the time it is great."
1599856,43368701,2015-08-19,34876631,Mengqi,It's a nice apartment. My families and I spent two wonderful days in this apartment. It is not too large but it is enough for small group people to have a good rest. It is located on a good location. It is convenient for us to take bus and train to the city center and some good view points! Joe and Dana are so nice! Thanks!
1599856,43939998,2015-08-23,13148174,Beth,"This was a perfect homebase for our exploration of Seattle. As the description says, we were close to transportation and a really cool neighborhood. A great bakery and grocery within walking distance were really appreciated. There was always a spot on the parking pad for our rental car, and communication and entry were easy. Space was clean and comfortable, and would definitely stay again. Thanks, Joe!"
1599856,44515840,2015-08-27,29212175,Katie,"We stayed at the apartment for 4 nights.  Although we did not meet Joseph, he gave us plenty of information prior to our stay to make it easy.  The kitchen was well stocked but there was no shampoo or bath soap in the bathroom.  The apartment was generally true to its reviews.  However, there was evidence (cat food, smell) that a cat had been in the apartment and I would have appreciated knowing this since I am allergic to cats.  I also found the carpeting old and stained."
1599856,45795147,2015-09-06,827728,Zeeshan,"Everything was great.  The place was exactly as described.  No surprises.  Cool neighborhood with restaurants and grocery stores near walking distance.  Awesome shower.  Check-in and check-out was painless.  I would stay again at this place.  And, they had delicious almond chocolates!!  We ate all of them!  :) 
"
1599856,46161872,2015-09-08,21730994,Jiamin,We spent a great time in Joseph's house. It is convenient to the central Seattle City. Nice neighborhood with the best brunch restaurant just one block away. 
1599856,46406751,2015-09-10,22302610,Pieterjan,"This place is not at all too small for 4 people, and even 6 people could work out if you'd arrange yourself. You feel this is a home to Joe. His mother was kind to welcome us, and give us some tips to get around."
1599856,47147774,2015-09-16,11669319,Jeremy,"Our stay was amazing at Joseph's apartment. Although Joseph was away, his mother Dana was a great host and very responsive. The apartment is in a great neighborhood and close to all the things you could need. The new co-op is a block away, and there are a ton of restaurants nearby. I will definitely being staying here during my next stay in Seattle."
1599856,47586482,2015-09-20,11161828,Michael,"Had a wonderful stay! Very easy to get to and the key code door lock made it super easy to check in. Everything you need is already in the apartment. The host was very accommodating, super nice, and communicated very well. Would definitely stay again! "
1599856,48089161,2015-09-23,184880,Robert,"This place worked out really well for my family- myself, my wife and two kids. The neighborhood is great! Thanks for sharing your home. "
1599856,48400320,2015-09-26,7708425,Bradley,Joseph was an amazing host that provided information about our stay in a quick and courteous fashion. The apartment we rented from Joseph was very clean and was easily accessible from a light rail station. We enjoyed our stay and would highly recommend Joseph as a host in the future to anyone traveling to the Seattle area. Thanks again! 
1599856,49759247,2015-10-06,30673698,James,"This is a quaint clean quite 2 bedroom apt that fit our needs to the tee!  Joe met us at the door and after just a few minutes, all was completed and we settled in.  Rooms clean and allow for a good sleep.  No TV which was actually a good thing as it allowed us to talk and just chill back and read, take walks, etc.  The area is so nice with a few  breakfast restaurants, small pubs and of course the coffee places.  the rail system is an easy walk to and from there to go anywhere within Seattle.  I would recommend this place and stay there again without blinking an eye!! Thanks Joe"
1599856,50831038,2015-10-15,9403714,Ilana,We just finished our stay in Joseph's place and it was perfect for myself and my two children (6&8). The place had everything we needed but wasn't so 'precious' that I was worried the kids would mess anything up (they didn't!). We loved Columbia City and walked every morning to the bakery around the corner and then every evening to Full Tilt Icecream for dessert and vintage video games. There is a school across the street that had a playground and basketball courts and another great playground and fields a few blocks away. All in all a great place to hang out
1599856,51305539,2015-10-19,28521332,Ermila,Joseph was super nice & very easy to talk to. His place was perfect for four people. We didn't have any problems at all. Thanks again for letting us stay in your home. Btw-we loved your cultured library!

Everything was very clean and comforting, really homey feeling. Definitely going to have to stay here again next time I visit Seattle!!!"
1599856,52828760,2015-11-02,16864524,Laura,"Our host was available to meet us at our arrival and extremely responsive to our concerns during our stay.  We did not use the kitchen because of the many dining out choices in the area, but it was nice to have available a full kitchen and laundry.  Great neighborhood!"
1599856,53040201,2015-11-04,26722041,Sally & Thijs,Really fantastic place. Very comfortable and very clean. Hosts were very responsive and accommodating. Location was great and very easy to catch the train downtown.
1599856,53460182,2015-11-09,30420622,Chandra,"The apartment was great - clean, comfortable beds, fantastic location.  We didn't really use the kitchen, but it was well-equipped.  Joseph was really helpful- we unfortunately didn't get to meet him in person as we were out most of the time, but he checked in with us and was very friendly  and accommodating.  Would definitely stay here again!!"
1599856,54230970,2015-11-17,37828388,Megan,"Had a great stay at this Columbia City apartment. It's small, but there is plenty of room for 4 people, especially if you're using it primarily just to sleep. Perfect location to catch the light rail to the airport and to downtown. Close to a great grocery store and some good restaurants and coffee shops. Super cute area. It suited all our needs!"

1599856,55426517,2015-12-01,47672096,Ella,"We love the place so much! We are a group of 4, 2 couples taking a road trip from Vancouver. Location is perfect, quiet but accessible. Just 15 mins drive from downtown, 15 mins from airport (normal traffic).
The place is warm and cozy! Jo is so nice to be so flexible with our late check-in on the first day (as we were doing our crazy shopping @outlets before getting there). and thanks for the recommendations of restaurants and supermarket nearby.
The 2 nights we were there was really cold outside, but the home is so warm all the time. 
The kitchen is what we love most although we only had chance to cook for one dinner (cos of our short stay), things are well kept and utensils are clean. 
The washroom/ bathroom is newly renovated and it's clean too. (Though the wall between the bedroom and bathroom is a little thin and you can hear the noise when water is running from the tap, but that's not a problem for us.) 
Will definitely return next time! "

1599856,57212059,2015-12-23,20543813,Darcie,"The place was just as it was described. Joseph's mother welcomed us and accommodated us while we there, and she was very helpful. The space was clean, cozy, and close to decent restaurants and shops. I would recommend this listing to anyone visiting Seattle."
1599856,57629803,2015-12-28,4549254,Lynette,"Great location! Very convenient to Columbia City shops and to the light rail. Worked at well for my husband, 19 month old, and I! Extra books were a nice touch :). Bit on the cold side even when adjusting the thermostat. "
1599856,57909216,2015-12-30,20897214,Marilyn,"Joe's mother, Dana, welcomed us at the apartment. She was very helpful with information about the apratment and directions for the neighbourhood. The apartment was delightfully retro with gorgeous handmade quilts and a crow theme throughout. There were lots of good books and kitchen and bathroom amenities. The place was very environmentally conscious, the beds were comfortable, and it slept all 4 of us quite comfortably. The furnace made the apartment toasty warm very quickly. We would definitely stay there again! Also, a great neighbourhood, and truly 2.5 blocks from anywhere.

Thank you for making out Seattle trip so fantastic! "

The apartment is located within walking distance of a number of great restaurants (including phenomenal oysters) and bars, which was great. The apartment was very clean and cozy and was overall a great place to spend a weekend in Seattle. Although we did not meet, Stephanie was very helpful and made sure we were able to get into/check out of the apartment in an easy way. She also suggested a few restaurants, which was much appreciated! Overall, we really enjoyed our stay and would highly recommend for others! Thanks, Stephanie!"

The parking situation and access to the building was a bit confusing at first but we mastered it in no time! The apartment was exactly as advertised and the location is ideal! Stephanie was great at responding to all communication in a timely manner and was quick to answer any questions we had. Thank you!"

6591894,39574136,2015-07-24,30661570,Elle,"Well planned B&B, great amenities available that make the stay very comfortable and easy.  Gorgeous neighborhood- this house is close to parks, museums, local eateries. Also, a wonderful way to meet many people if you are new to the area. I stayed in the home for my first week upon moving to Seattle."
6591894,39953426,2015-07-27,17241939,Hui Koon,"A very homely feel throughout my stay. Great selection of cuisines along 15th Avenue, and if you walk a little further - Pine Street. I stayed here for a few days and then moved to a hostel downtown in order to be closer to all the action. This place is awesome, nonetheless, especially for people whose sole purpose in Seattle is not just to be a tourist."
6591894,41991358,2015-08-10,37264813,Jake,"This is my first AirBnB experience and I couldn't be more happier choosing to stay at this place. The people in the house are all welcoming and I have a very positive experience staying at this place. 

The view from the house is breath-taking. Even better than the hotels downtown ha!

I would love to stay here again next year if I have a chance to visit Seattle.

Thanks again for having me."

6591894,43406659,2015-08-19,27603463,Wesley,"The guys were great. I got a text the day off just to make sure I was getting in okay. Once I arrived, Jon helped me get things squared away and gave me a brief tour of the place. There was a Saturday night bonfire going on, but I had to head off to dinner plans with a friend instead. I got to meet several of the guys staying in the Purple Room throughout my week. Everyone is friendly and the atmosphere is awesome. Would definitely stay here again if I return to Seattle!"
6591894,44934527,2015-08-30,19601648,David,"Very nice group of folks who live here and equally friendly guests. Listing description is accurate, and the neighborhood is safe and well situated by many bus lines. Very organized and clean house. An interesting hostel/homestay hybrid that would work well for many travelers. "
