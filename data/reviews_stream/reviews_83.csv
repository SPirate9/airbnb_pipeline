92835,13228393,2014-05-22,8408328,Amy,"I stayed at Lauren's place for a night, just in town for work. Her apartment was conveniently close to my company's downtown Seattle office. Lauren recommended I visit a nearby sushi restaurant called Maneki's, a unique and cozy spot I never would have known about otherwise. Lauren was very responsive to my text messages and Airbnb communications, and she personally gave me a nice tour of the apartment, which was well organized and very clean. The unit is rather close to the freeway, and the hum of the cars is consistently present, although not overwhelmingly distracting. Overall I had a great experience, and hope to visit Seattle again soon!"
92835,13544203,2014-05-30,14774341,Aleta,"Totally LOVED the place, it was exactly as the pictures showed and was so charming and CLEAN!! I've stayed in hotels and have walked around in socks only to find them totally black on the bottom. Walked around in her apartment with socks on and my socks were WHITE!!! Lauren was the BEST, had tons of suggestions and went out of her way to accommodate us. I would totally recommend this place and would love to come back again! This also was our first experience with airbnb and it was sure a pleasurable one! "
92835,13567032,2014-05-31,4115096,Yushan,"Although I only met Lauren one day, it felt like if Lauren was my long lost friend! My mom who came with me truly thought if Lauren was my long lost friend who lived in Seattle! Lovely place and enjoyed the place so much...wish I could have stay there a little longer!"
92835,13648349,2014-06-02,11242140,Hannah,"Lauren was the best! She was very good at responding to your messages very quickly and she was so nice. Unfortunately we didn't get to meet her in person but she was a pleasure to work with via email. Her apartment was exactly as described. Very clean and comfortable! The apartment was in a great location downtown and close to all of the tourist attractions. However if you need to take a cab, there is always one lined up outside because there is a hotel right next store. Even though the apartment was next to a busy highway, we had no problem with loud noises. I would highly recommend Lauren's apartment if you need an affordable, comfortable and clean place to stay while you are visiting Seattle! Thank you for your hospitality Lauren!!"
92835,14220551,2014-06-15,679438,Julie,"Another great stay with Lauren! So accommodating, and responds quickly to any questions!"
92835,14462511,2014-06-20,11743129,Katherine,"Lauren was a great host.  She helped us get oriented to the city and secure parking for the week.  The apartment was exactly as described.   Very clean and put together.  It had all the amenities we needed, including kitchen supplies for some light cooking.  Great location.  A short walk to Pike Place, ferries, etc.  Would definitely rent again.  "
92835,14678442,2014-06-24,10945428,Deanna,"Fantastic apartment and location. Lauren was friendly, hospitable and courteous. Within walking distance to Pike place Market, downtown spots and First Hill and conveniently located to numerous bus stops if you need it.
If you can't walk up stairs easily there is an elevator in the building to get to the apartment. 
Plenty of room for a couple or small family. There is a constant rumble of street traffic noise from outside but if you're sensitive there are ear plugs provided among other things that are graciously furnished by past travelers.
My husband and I highly recommend Lauren and her great apartment for your stay. Thank you!"
92835,15085296,2014-07-02,4756495,Elle,What an amazing location. Perfect for sightseeing around the city on foot. Lauren was lovely and her apartment was clean and cozy.  The only negative was the traffic noise from the highway. I would not let this from stopping you from staying here. Location trumps the noise. 
92835,15137255,2014-07-03,10137396,Amy,"Great location which near light rail
Station, pike market. Apartment is cosy snd nice. My family of 4 enjoy the stay so much. Lauren is so friendly and helpful.  "
92835,15210838,2014-07-05,501716,Glenn,"Lauren was very accommodating when our luggage was lost, causing us to be late for check-in.  Also, she was kind enough to allow us to have our Amazon orders shipped to her--we live outside the U.S.

The location of the apartment is very central to downtown Seattle and makes for a convenient stay while enjoying the city.  Its size is ideal for a couple."
92835,15810701,2014-07-16,12459230,Kathleen,"A charming, well-equipped appartment with a very comfortable bed. It is very central and within walking distance of many attractions. It is also close to most public transport and the taxis at the front door are very handy. Only drawbacks are the traffic noise which wasn't a problem for us, and the lack of airconditioning which since it was extremely hot during our visit, made us a little uncomfortable. Obviously this would not be a problem for most of the year. Lauren, our host was great, prompt to communicate with us, and did everything to make our stay in Seattle most enjoyable."
92835,16011697,2014-07-20,10908067,Sabrina,"Lauren is very accommodating and extremely helpful. She responds to emails, phone calls, and texts in a timely fashion, and is more than willing to answer any and all questions about her town. 

The space is CLEAN, super cute and is supplied with all the necessities. Her location was perfect for my stay as it is walking distance to the Market and Pioneer Square and a quick bus ride to Capitol Hill (the stop is literally in front the the apt!). 

All in all, I had a wonderful time for my first trip to Seattle, and more importantly, my first Air BnB experience.

Thanks Lauren, I will be back!"
92835,16300967,2014-07-25,4746621,Emily,Lauren was a lovely hostess.  She made us feel really welcome.  We really enjoyed our stay with her in Seattle.  
92835,16652671,2014-07-31,4074781,Diane,Second time at Lauren's and still perfect! She is the best! Thanks for everything! 
92835,16821887,2014-08-03,13044273,Vaughn,Lauren was a fantastic and helpful host. Her apartment is charming and in a wonderful location. Highly recommend!
92835,17041956,2014-08-06,205858,David,Great apt.  Very close to downtown.  Lauren met us and showed us the place.  Extremely clean and cozy.  I would definitely stay here again.
92835,17273910,2014-08-10,7330155,Jessica,"We had a great Seattle visit staying at Lauren's place. Close, clean, and convenient to all. Highly recommended, we felt at home and comfortable. "
92835,17333851,2014-08-11,13414032,Darrell,"We loved the apartment!   So much character and was perfectly located!  The perfect walk to the Pike Place Market and even the Mariners game...and a very short drive to the Space Needle!   A must stay for sure...When we come back to Seattle, we will definitely pick Lauren's place!"
92835,17497653,2014-08-13,13575607,Janet,"Lauren is the quintessential host.  She worked hard to ensure excellent communication, easy check-in, and was super easy to work with--very accommodating.  The apartment is nicely stocked.  What she advertises, is what you get!  The location is centrally located downtown which was wonderful but also had traffic noise from the nearby freeway which made it a little challenging to get to sleep initially--bring ear plugs!."
92835,17735679,2014-08-17,10764873,Jim,"Lauren was great. Very accommodating and helpful.  Her apartment could not be more convenient to downtown Seattle.  It was just about perfect.  In a neat eclectic older building, her apartment has everything you might need.  It was great visiting with her and hope we can return the favor and good hosting if she gets to Virginia!
 "
92835,18226641,2014-08-24,175398,Mitchell,"Lauren was very helpful getting us oriented to the apartment and provided everything we needed for our stay. The neighborhood was perfect for us: I was attending a convention at the Westin a few blocks away and the cost was about one-third of the hotel. The building was secure and on the same street as the Renaissance hotel, so it's a populated area (which is good). The location was also a nice walk down to the waterfront. I recommend this apartment for a single traveler or couple. It can sleep 3 on an inflatable bed, but that might be a bit crowded for some.  This is an exception value for the price. It isn't a luxury hotel. The building is quite old but in good condition. So having the right expectation is important. I'd definitely stay at Lauren's place again."
92835,18397253,2014-08-26,14446557,Bernie,"Nice little apartment, lots of big windows to give you natural light, and it really is central to everything. I had a car, but ended up walking most places. However, keep in mind that Seattle has hills (much like San Francisco), so walking is a pretty good workout.  :-)

I know some people have mentioned the traffic noise, but I'm a pretty sound sleeper and didn't have any issues with it. I was fortunate to be staying there from Saturday night through Monday morning, so I could park on the street for free. If you're staying other days, you should consider the cost of parking (or just use the Link to get from the airport -- I probably didn't really need a car).

The host, Lauren, is very nice and helpful. She lives in the same building so it's easy to reach her if there's a problem.
"
92835,18521389,2014-08-28,10484404,Carissa,"This apartment was quite lovely and we enjoyed our stay very much. It was convenient and in a great,  safe location.  I wasn't bothered at all by the highway or city noise, in fact I slept very well. I would definitely stay here again and recommend it to friends and family."
92835,18706467,2014-08-31,14223892,Ligaya,"Great communication between guests and host. The best location if you stay at downtown area with easy access to the seatac airport during daytime.
"
92835,18798342,2014-09-01,3266156,Layla,"We were very happy with this little apartment near the library. It was very neat and clean, the bed was extremely comfortable, and we enjoyed the charm of an older apartment, eg claw feet on the bathtub! Lauren was great. "
92835,19362807,2014-09-11,17115668,Paul And Caroline,"Great 2nd stay using airbnb.

Lauren's communication was fantastic, and really helped manage expectations around arrival, keys, check out and the local area.

Met Lauren outside the apartment, which is right next to the main freeway, but strangely enough you get used to very quickly and don't really notice.

Lauren showed us round and spent some time helping talk through the area, apartment, options and some suggestions for our short-stay.

The photo's provide a good representation of the apartment, and was perfect for our short-stay.  We only really used the apartment for showers and sleeping as we were out for more than 12 hours each day, so didn't really use any of the amenities, including cooker or TV.

Wifi worked well, as did the silent fans in the bedroom to help keep us cool as we were fortunate to have great weather when we were there.

The apartment is part of a older style block, and while this is similar to what we are used to in Edinburgh, the block and apartment could probably do with some refreshing and maintenance, but didn't detract from a fantastic stay.  No hesitation in staying again as the apartment is very well placed, and Lauren our host was great.

Walking downtown to pike market or up towards Capitol Hill from the apartment is very easy if you like to stretch your legs."
92835,19593766,2014-09-15,11790738,Kasey,We loved this place. Loved the setup and was very comfortable to stay in during our 4 night stay in Seattle. Will definitely stay here if we ever get to Seattle again (which I hope we do!).
92835,19739304,2014-09-17,6162696,Eva,"Very nice apartment ,centrally located, immaculate , Lauren was very welcoming upon our arrival, great value ."
92835,19799707,2014-09-18,2965830,Ashley,Lauren was a great host.  Super flexible with my arrival and easy to communicate with. 
92835,19832205,2014-09-19,20291401,Robin,"This is our first air bnb experience and you made it a total breeze! Checking in was super simple and the apartment was great! It was conveniently located near bars and restaurants, free evening parking was a plus and the easiest access imaginable to the I5. Thanks again Lauren for warm friendly welcome we hope to see you again :-)"
92835,19923699,2014-09-21,6761277,Erin,"Lauren was a great host - super friendly and relaxed (and an Arsenal fan, so you can't go wrong!)  The apartment was clean and homey, full of character and in a perfect location.  We had a great weekend away and highly recommend Lauren's place! Thanks again! :-)  "
92835,20137397,2014-09-24,4922204,Mindy,"We had a great stay at Lauren's apartment! It is in an ideal location for exploring downtown Seattle. Lauren was very friendly and helpful. I didn't feel well on our first night there so my husband and I decided to stay in, and Lauren provided several recommendations for restaurants that delivered food. The place has everything you can possibly need for a comfortable stay!"
92835,20495543,2014-09-30,18169949,Megan,This was our first airbnb experience and it was wonderful! Lauren was so helpful and accessible that we felt right at home. She greeted us at the door and gave us some tips right off the bat. The apartment was clean and spacious. It is within walking distance of a lot of sites like pike place and pioneer square. It's also very close to the light rail station. We took a taxi when leaving the city and there was a taxi stand right next door at the hotel so we were never worried about flagging one down.  The description was accurate that there is some street noise but that didn't bother us a bit. It was like white noise. We would love to come back and stay again!
92835,20655014,2014-10-03,20591268,Marianne,"Lauren is a great host! She is extremely helpful and flexible - we could ask her anything about the apartment or Seattle and she would do all she could to help us out.

The apartment is located in a really good and safe area. It took us only 10-15 minutes to walk to Pike Place Market... There were some minor things that didn't work in the apartment but Lauren pointed it out when we arrived so there were no surprices - and we had no bad experiences during our stay.

We would absolutely come back again!"
92835,20894988,2014-10-07,17060650,Hyunji,"Lauren's apt has so nice location. Just 5-10 mins to Pike market. Lauren helped us for everything about parking, restaurant, landmark.. Staying her apt was so nice experience!"
92835,21201387,2014-10-13,5601048,Mike,"This is the second time I've stayed at Lauren's apartment in Seattle. The location is great. Once you take the Link train from Seatac airport to Pioneer Square it's a 10 minute walk to the apartment. Centrally located, a block from the main public library. I have an event that I attend at the Seattle Convention Center, and Lauren's apartment is a quick 10 minute walk away. Restaurants and the Seattle Art Museum are also a nearby, as well as Capitol Hill. There are also grocery stores and drug stores within walking distance.

The apartment itself is roomy and comfortably furnished. Everything we needed for our stay was provided, included Seattle guides and maps. It really felt like coming home at the end of every day. Lauren is the perfect hostess. She was available for information if we needed it, but also gave us our privacy. I would definitely rent Lauren's apartment again for my next visit to Seattle."
92835,21326189,2014-10-14,920525,Tony,"What a lovely apartment! Our host was helpful, communicative, and flexible with our plans. The space was clean and comfortable, and had everything we needed for our one-night stay.

Like everywhere in downtown Seattle, it was quite a climb to get there! But, it's very near to great food, the library, and the waterfront. We were even able to walk to the train station when we left in the morning."
92835,21511452,2014-10-19,3263527,Kristin,"Our stay at Lauren's was the best! Her place was so cozy. She was always a text away. Her place is close to everything. Everything is in walking distance or near bus stops. We will definitely stay here again, she made our trip to Seattle even better than expected! "
92835,21673689,2014-10-21,10529481,Vu,"Lauren was a great host. Very informative and helpful. The location was superb. we were in the middle of everything, pikes place, china town, art museum, aquarium, convention center. We pretty much walked everywhere. "
92835,21823322,2014-10-25,19455146,Lisa,"Lauren was a great host!  We ran a little bit late, but she was very accommodating.  The apartment was quite spacious for being downtown.  It had a lot of character (the good kind!) and was comfortable.  It was about 8-10 blocks from Pike Place Market and was a very easy walk.  There are plenty of restaurants around.  Lauren gave us some good suggestions that were within a couple of blocks.  She lives very close by and was available if we needed anything.  

We had a wonderful experience and would definitely stay again if we find ourselves in Seattle."
92835,22062034,2014-10-29,16390464,Karen,"Staying at Lauren's place was such a great experience. The apartment was clean and as charming as the photos show. The location was perfect for us because it was walking distance to most places but for the couple of times we had to cab it, there is a cab stand steps from the building entrance and it is so convenenient. Lauren was incredibly helpful.  She sent us a list of restaurants she thought we should try and gave us several tips on getting around Seattle. Overall it was a perfect experience for us!"
92835,22226938,2014-11-02,16955452,Lindsay,I absolutely loved staying in Lauren's place. Lauren was great with pre-arrival questions and communication and even helped me figure out where local amenities were. This apartment is very centrally located and it's easy to get to major tourist locations from here. Lauren was even volunteered to help me store baggage before my flight. I 100% would gladly stay here in the future and would recommend this location to friends and family. Thanks for the Seattle hospitality!!
92835,22454797,2014-11-07,6500158,Katie,"What an amazing apartment!!! The location is unbeatable! Everything  was in walking distance!!
 Lauren is such an amazing and awesome host! Lauren was very accomodating during our stay  especially when we missed our flight! I had nothing to worry about because i know that Lauren will be there if i needed anything. The apartment is exactly like the  pictures shown on the listing. We are a family of four and we fitted perfectly. The bed was very comfy and the air mattress was good too. Even though my family and i stayed in Seattle for 2 nights, we felt very comfortable and happy with Laurens cute apartment! I would definitely recommend Laurens Apartment to anyone visiting Seattle.
Thank you Lauren! 

Katie and Family."
92835,22650431,2014-11-11,8006951,Sandra,"Lauren's place was a wonderful apartment in the middle of Seattle's downtown area.  Very clean stocked apartment with a London theme.  She was very helpful on where to go in Seattle and informed us about a public transportation app to get around the city.   She will meet you at the building and help you with light rail stops.  She told us to get off an University because the hill isn't as steep as Pioneer Square.   Her place is close to Century Link and Pikes Place, so you have places close by.   "
92835,22833171,2014-11-16,5331935,Kimberly,"The apartment was great! Lauren was an excellent host, bending over backwards to accommodate, and the apartment is well decorated and charming. You have very easy access to downtown and the waterfront. It is very close to the highway, but that doesn't create any issues and might be really convenient for someone driving i."
92835,23001747,2014-11-19,16772149,Andrea,"LAUREN,
Is ridiculously AMAZING.  Seriously speaking, if you do not use her charming space when you need a place to chill in Downtown Seattle you are missing out on a wonderful experience.  She treats you like you are her friend of 10 years.
She wants you comfortable and you will be.

I will be returning. Guaranteed! 

AndreaS"
92835,23114999,2014-11-23,16149397,Gina,"Lauren is a wonderful host and we loved staying at her cute, comfy & very convenient apartment. She was extremely helpful when our train was delayed, impacting our arrival. Thank you!"
92835,23368225,2014-11-30,2039663,Bruce,"This apartment was exactly as described. A very charming vintage apartment that we enjoyed a great deal. As others have mentioned there is a lot of freeway noise and parking can be a bit of a hassle but easily manageable and parking is a nuisance everywhere in Seattle. 

For those unfamiliar with Seattle this location is basically between the financial district and ""pill hill"" where the medical centers are so the immediate few blocks are not very tourist friendly but both Pioneer Square and Pike Place Market are easily walkable only a few blocks away in either direction so it is central for those areas and busses to almost anywhere in Seattle are only a couple blocks away.

It's really nice that Columbia Center tower is very close and I'd really suggest people who stay here visit the observation floor in the tower both in the daytime and the night since it is so close by and a pass can be used all day (10-8). It's a great view and fun to see both daytime and nighttime.

Also don't miss out on visiting the library next door. It's a cool and unique building. Go up to the top of the spiral stacks and you can have a vertigo inducing view of the atrium."
92835,23652341,2014-12-07,17609024,Aaron,"Very friendly. Lauren was able to be flexible and work with our schedule. The apartment was roomy, eclectically and cutely decorated, and bathroom/kitchen areas were tidy. Bed feels great! You are next to the highway, but if you don't mind a little white-noise you can let the ""ocean"" waves rock you to sleep."
92835,24205192,2014-12-22,18274116,DeeAnn,Lauren is amazingly helpful and made our trip up to Seattle super-fun!  The apartment is just as charming and comfortable as advertised.  We wished we could have stayed for longer.  
92835,25464644,2015-01-17,22177155,Caitlin,We visited Seattle for 6 days to experience the city. Lauren's apartment is in a perfect location for downtown. Before we arrived Lauren offered to give us directions to her home.  She was a wonderful host and promptly answered any and all questions we had. She was also very helpful with restaurant suggestions. Lauren's apartment was more than I imagined. It had a feeling of home; it was a different experience than a hotel which we enjoyed. 
92835,25895041,2015-01-28,16686850,Nikoletta,"Lauren was lovely. She met me outside the building and showed me to the apartment, which was nice and clean as expected from the pictures. The apartment is close to downtown, but also right next to the freeway as described in previous reviews. I thought what people described as white noise would be soothing to me (i usually sleep better with white noise), but was utterly wrong. It was not just the freeway noise that never calmed, but the endless truck deliveries across the road and backing up beeping that kept me awake at night. Same goes for the several car alarms that went off at 3am in the morning for about 10 minutes. None of this is the host's fault, and I acknowledge it might have been an exceptionally noisy night for the neighborhood and the location was fairly described, I guess I am just more bothered by this then others. If you book here, I hope you are a deep sleeper. As it is I was pretty much awake all night."
92835,25949824,2015-01-30,21366705,Rollin,"Lauren's space was really nicely furnished and very comfortable. I loved the old building and the decor; I felt at home immediately. She was very welcoming and friendly and I enjoyed chatting with her for a bit before heading out to dinner with a friend. There were plenty of amenities available like towels and dishes. I slept very well in the comfy bed and was plenty warm even though it was chilly outside that night. There was wi-fi available but I did not use it.

Two things to keep in mind about this space if you are thinking about staying here. One is the bedroom window looks out directly on I-5, which has constant traffic all night. The building is very thick due to how old it is and the windows are newer, double-glazed ones, both of which cut the noise dramatically but it's still pretty noticeable. It's good to keep this in mind if you are a light sleeper.  The other is that parking can be really challenging to find, and it's all paid, though between 8PM and 8AM street parking is free if you can find it. There are a couple of lots nearby. I was able to find a spot right on the street and paid that night for the first two hours of the next morning (a cool feature of the meters there), so I did not have to rush out at 8AM to make sure I didn't get a ticket.

Neither of these is a deal-breaker by any means; just good things to know ahead of time so you can plan. I definitely recommend this space if you are looking for a spot in this area. It's super-close to First Hill, which is a really cool area to walk around in."
92835,26179415,2015-02-06,21291647,Vanessa,I felt welcome from the moment I landed in the city.  Lauren met me at the door and I felt like an old friend that had come to visit. She was welcoming and warm and made sure that I was settled in and knew where everything was and rule of the building.  I couldn't have asked for a better host.
92835,27158690,2015-02-27,8177286,Emmanuel,"I had a perfect stay in Lauren's appartment.

Lauren was very helpful."
92835,28163005,2015-03-19,19309149,Janan,"Lauren was so accommodating and friendly.  She let us drop our bags off early in the morning well before check-in time.  She proceeded to tell us everything there is to know about staying at her place and made it a smooth, easy experience."
92835,28240932,2015-03-20,1226376,Lauren,"Lauren was a fantastic host, and she has a great name, if I do say so. ;) Silliness aside, Lauren was awesome. She welcomed me personally and helped orient me to her space, the building rules and the neighborhood. The apartment is adorable and very conveniently located! Thanks again for having me, and on short notice."
92835,28593773,2015-03-26,7596232,Peter,"I had a great, but short time at Lauren's place.  The apartment was as advertised.  The location is great for downtown activities and easy access off I5.  My flight was delayed, and Lauren patiently met me at 12:30 to get me settled in.  "
92835,28773935,2015-03-30,22545125,Frances,"We had a mixed experience staying with Lauren - she greeted us warmly and helped out with directions, was flexible with our arrival etc. When she showed us the place we realized it isn't near the highway though, it is ON the highway, so it isn't just noise but wall-rattling at times. The space lay-out works very well for two people for a weekend, bedroom - sitting room - kitchen (particularly nice kitchen, well equipped) and bathroom off the kitchen. Unfortunately the bathroom experience was a bit sad since the face-cloth provided prettily rolled up with the other towels was filthy, and I only discovered that after I'd used it, so I spent a good portion of my first shower pulling someone's hair off me... Otherwise the place was clean. Our main complain was the bed - perhaps fine for 1 person, but for 2 it was really bad. Felt like a bag of cushion stuffing placed over weepy springs. Eventually we asked Lauren if there was anything she could do, and she did try to help, but short of replacing the mattress, there wasn't really any hope. So we slept very badly for four nights, despite the pretty decor and Lauren's attempt to sort things out.  "
92835,29153239,2015-04-04,5191276,Sunny,"Lauren provided the perfect little home away from home for our night in seattle.  Very comfortable, queit and safe and great location."
92835,29485541,2015-04-08,15493248,Paul,Lauren was great and very friendly!  She helped us out navigating the steep hills of Seattle.  I would absolutely choose her place again in the future.
92835,29839480,2015-04-13,260187,David,We absolutely loved the location!  It was easy to get to the rail (light link as well as Amtrak) and downtown.  The apartment is nicely furnished and made for a comfortable stay.  Lauren was a fantastic host and she aimed us at some great places to eat and find coffee.  Highly recommended!
92835,30066100,2015-04-17,26129650,Joahna,"Lauren’s apartment is located in an amazingly central part of the city – Pike Place Market, Pioneer Square, the Convention Center, and the ferry terminal are all within walking distance. If navigating Seattle’s hills by foot isn’t your style, then other options are always available – Uber, public transportation and cabs were always near (there’s a cab stand right outside the apartment building).
Lauren was extremely pleasant and is easily reachable through texting.  She even accommodated our early check-in and sent us helpful directions on how to reach her place via the light rail from the airport.  The apartment overlooks the I-5, so there’s a constant stream of noise from the freeway – bring earplugs if you’re a light sleeper. Currently, there’s construction going on around the area, so you will hear trucks coming and going late into the night.
The apartment was decorated with lots of personal touches to make you feel like you’re staying at a friend’s place as opposed to a hotel (we appreciated the lightning fast Wi-Fi that Lauren provided). The kitchen is well stocked with cooking and eating utensils and there were towels and miscellaneous toiletries (even a hair dryer!) available for use in the bathroom. The bed (although fine for two people) was extremely squeaky to the point where I thought the neighbors could hear whenever I sat on it. There is no dresser in the bedroom, so if you’re going to be staying for more than a few days, you’ll be living out of your suitcase. The laundry room is in the basement – cost is $1.25/load (so save up those quarters). Although the apartment was tidy, the general cleanliness could be improved upon (e.g., dusty window-sills and décor, crumbs on the stove).  It’s an older building with quirks, but the cost and location make this place an absolute steal if you’re looking to experience downtown Seattle.
"
92835,30443789,2015-04-22,27230054,Jonas,"Thank you for the awesome place Lauren. It made my Seattle experience so much more than staying at a hotel.
"
92835,30679800,2015-04-26,19795207,Clarissa,"Lauren was excellent, she was very detailed in the directions to the apt. We got there without a hitch. The apartment was great, very nice and well located. It was clean and very cozy."
92835,30934529,2015-04-29,22026638,John,"Lauren is wonderful host and incredibly wonderful person! She could not have helped us more. From checking on us as we made our way there to texting us suggestions for dinner when we were out.We had a wonderful time, the apt is clean and cozy. Great location to be able to walk to everything."
92835,31286471,2015-05-04,14234902,Katherine,"Lauren was a great host making us feel very welcome in seattle with lots of tips and advice about where to go and what to see. The flat has everything you could need and is in a great location, just a short walk to Pike Place market etc. It is next to a busy road but it didn't bother us too much. Would stay again! "
92835,31759449,2015-05-10,22919725,Linda,Lauren went out of her way to make us welcome. we arrived from the airport later than originally planned and Lauren was there waiting to greet us.
92835,32105850,2015-05-14,18802884,Vy,"Lauren was an awesome host!  She greeted us when we arrived and made us feel right a home instantly.  She was extremely helpful with the parking situation.  Her place was really nice and clean.  The location was perfect, really close to everything."
92835,32635924,2015-05-19,33161193,Maurice,"This was an awesome place to stay at, the apartments environment was very welcoming and I felt comfortable here in this location. Although, I did not get to meet Lauren because she was away on travel, there was open communication between us and within the apartment there was a listing of additional phone numbers of other people in case she could not reach back to me. The furniture and decor was very nice and chic, and the bedroom had a comfortable bed, so I had no trouble sleeping whatsoever. The apartment was clean and organized. The location was also great, due to it being near downtown and close to areas of interest such as pike place market, shopping centers, etc. Overall, I would definitely recommend staying here to everyone and would definitely return here upon another visit to Seattle."
92835,32895476,2015-05-23,11259037,Lauren,"All previous reviews had it on the money. Very cute apartment that is walkable to major sites in the area (note: it's at the top of a fairly steep hill depending on what direction you are coming from!). It's true that the road outside provides noise, but I hardly noticed it and slept great. It's also true that it could probably use a legit scrub down - I found  MONSTER dust bunnies when hunting for a place to plug in my phone. However, I loved the cute decor, the location, and the price. Nothing in the listing was misrepresented and all necessary amenities were available."
92835,33068264,2015-05-25,24275788,Kelly,"My boyfriend and I thoroughly enjoyed our stay in Lauren's apartment. It was in the perfect location and we were able to walk everywhere which was a nice surprise since we thought we'd be ubering all over the city! The apartment fit our needs and was nicely decorated, charming and practical. We found the bed to be really comfortable and the white noise from the freeway to be rather relaxing. We weren't able to meet Lauren because she was in the UK, but she did a fantastic job coordinating everything for us and was always a text away. We will definitely be staying here again next time we visit Seattle! "
92835,33496369,2015-05-29,28025902,Joy,We enjoyed our stay here very much!  The apartment was very clean and comfortable (very much as pictured in the ad).  It was within walking distance to many things downtown.  Lauren was very kind and helpful.  We were very pleased with our experience here!
92835,33659912,2015-05-31,6098643,Summer,"Lauren is really the ideal Airbnb host: well-organized, friendly, knowledgeable, and easily contactable if needed. She provided all the information I needed for a stress-free trip. Her place has charming original details and includes everything necessary for a comfortable stay. I would definitely stay here again in the future. "
92835,33987388,2015-06-03,3048364,Lucy,"Amazing location, fully facilitated,  loved it. Lauren is very kind anf understanding, she even helped me receive packages and accommodated my arrival time changes. Thank you so much. Really appreciate it!"
92835,34274157,2015-06-07,27327745,Synthia,"We really enjoyed our time in Seattle. Lauren was very friendly, as almost all of the reviews have mentioned. Pros: The apartment was very centrally located downtown. Being on the second floor helped us to feel more safe staying in a downtown area and the apartment has a ""homey"" or cozy feel to it. We felt right at home by the end of our stay. There is also laundry in the building which was nice, and an iron/hair dryer. The bathroom and kitchen were rather clean. A lot of people complained about construction and noise as the apartment is right off of the highway. This construction must have stopped because there was none.. There is a constant hum of noise from the highway but it actually helps me sleep! Lastly, there is TV and wifi provided in the apartment. Cons: If you aren't really a city person this aparment isn't for you. I had never really used public transportation and sought to walk everywhere. By day two I could barely feel my legs! The apartment is at the top of a hill so you have to walk down very steep hills and then back up to get most places downtown. Some people are used to that. I am not. There is only one bus that really passes in front of the apartment and it takes you way across town if you hop on, so we ended up just walking back late at night a few times (which is not something I feel safe doing). We ended up figuring out the bus system the best we could and then rented a car on the last day of our trip to go explore outside of the city. That was probably the highlight of our trip. I highly recommend visiting Snoqualmie Falls if you can! Also, one other thing to keep in mind is that there is no central AC here. Luckily at night it cooled down outside so we would open the windows, but then flies were coming in and swarming around the apartment. It may be rather hot during the summer months.. Overall a great stay for the money and a great time in the city. "
92835,35060020,2015-06-15,26029510,Kaylee,We had a wonderful experience at the apartment! It was in perfect walking distance to all the tourist attractions and very easy to get to from the airport using the light rail. Lauren was very friendly and accommodating. This was our first AirBnB experience and the bar is now set very high thanks to Lauren. If you're coming to Seattle book this apartment!
92835,35309357,2015-06-17,32774935,Garrett,Lauren was great to deal with! very helpful and prompt. No complaints. Her location is wonderful for quick access to the Light Rail and all that downtown Seattle has to offer. 
92835,35645044,2015-06-21,16103092,Aaron,"Lauren was an exceptional host! She went out of her way to make sure we were comfortable. She was trustworthy, honest, and open. We were visiting Seattle with a VERY busy schedule so the location was perfect. Walking distance to the ferries, downtown (convention center, market, space needle, etc), as well as to capital hill for all the awesome restaurants and night scene. The place was comfortable, clean, well kept, and quiet. We would definitely stay here again! Thanks for everything Lauren!"
92835,35943588,2015-06-23,33973607,Josette,Lauren was very gracious in assisting us with our arrival.   She was very hospitable and accomodating.  She was also very responsive and made herself available for our multitude of questions.  
92835,36357268,2015-06-28,12391360,Skylar,"Lauren was warm , friendly and accommodating! The place was cute and clean and the perfect location for access and walking distance  to all the spots we wanted to visit!
This is quaint spot for acouole wanting to enjoy the city!!
Thanks Lauren!"
92835,36629771,2015-06-29,27293628,Wendi,We enjoyed our stay at Lauren's charming historical apartment. Lauren was very outgoing and easy to work with. The apartment was in a great location and was within  walking distance or a short cab ride to all we wanted to see and do.  The only down side was that is was unusually warm during our stay and the apartment did not have air conditioning.  I would recommend trying this air B and B.
92835,36943881,2015-07-03,4135297,Kelsey,Lauren's apartment was beautiful and perfect ! 
92835,37076611,2015-07-04,32129724,Sean,"Lauren greeted us with a smile upon arrival, even though we were late. We felt welcomed with open arms. We are so glad we chose Lauren's apartment, not only because it is centrally located (15 min walk to Pike's Market, 20 min walk to Capital Hill), but because it was clean, cozy and comfortable. Next time we are in Seattle, we'll be giving Lauren a call!"
92835,37655699,2015-07-09,31464135,Kara,"We loved our stay at Lauren's apartment. This was our first airbnb experience and Lauren made everything so easy. Lauren was very helpful and sweet. She gave us tips on taking the Amtrak and genuinely encouraged us to contact her if there was anything we needed. The apartment was exactly as pictured and located in walking distance between the Pike Place area and Pioneer Square, which was ideal for us. We'll definitely be back should we be in the area again. Thank you, Lauren! "
92835,37838938,2015-07-11,17216409,Elizabeth,"I spent two nights at this apartment with my daughter in July.  Lauren is an excellent host, personable and informative.  The apartment is ideally situated for exploring downtown Seattle on foot, and has a quirky,  lived-in feel, which we loved.  Lauren allowed us to check out slightly late to suit our cruise ship departure, which was greatly appreciated."
92835,38460336,2015-07-15,30851696,David,"Great location! About a block away from our office at the Columbia Center. 

The building is older and the entrance and hallways smelled a little musty. The apartment was fine though, and there was a nice breeze coming in through the windows. The apartment was also somewhat noisy with a busy road close by, but my White Noise app took care of that.

The apartment was very clean and comfortable, and I liked that Lauren posted all of her notes and postcards from previous guests on a cork board in the kitchen. Nice touch.

All in all, my 7 hours in the room were pleasant and restful."
92835,39265230,2015-07-22,18769635,Katherine,"We loved staying at Lauren's apartment.  The day we were driving in we hit a ton of traffic and were about an hour late arriving, but Lauren still waited for us and met us at the apartment to show us around.  The apartment was terrific; it was just as described.  We walked to the majority of things we wanted to see in the city as it was in a fantastic location.  Lauren provided us with everything we needed for our week stay and gave us some great tips on things to do while around town.  All in all, we really loved our stay!"
92835,39598385,2015-07-25,25538846,Iain,"Lauren was a fantastic host, replied quickly to all correspondence, and went out of her way to ensure our visit to Seattle went smoothly. The apartment was a perfect base for our short visit and allowed us to walk everywhere quickly and easily. It was clean and tidy and had everything we needed. The wifi was fast and worked flawlessly too which always helps! Thanks Lauren"
92835,40197833,2015-07-29,17179498,Teresa,"Staying at Lauren's apartment was an absolute treat. It was a super cozy and comfortable space. My boyfriend and I felt like we were at home and not just in a hotel. The pictures are accurate and location was perfect. 15-20min walk to everything. It is close to a major road; yes there is noise (which did not bother us). This did mean that uber and cabs got to you easily and quickly. Lauren was great to deal with. Very responsive and knowledgable. She was accomodating with an earlier check in/ check out. She met us in person outside the building, brought our bags to the apartment and texted us when the space was ready. Definitely recommend this location to anyone looking."
92835,40446206,2015-07-31,27407246,Aaron,Great apartment! Everything was easy and made our first airbnb experience very enjoyable.
92835,40617062,2015-08-01,36101710,Alisa,"Lauren was awesome. Very welcoming and even helped me parallel park my car because I'm terrible at it. Great space very close to downtown. She provided us with an extra air mattress, which was appreciated. We stayed on one of the warmest days of the week so the place was quite hot, however, there was a large fan that helped us keep cool. "
92835,41314624,2015-08-07,9535100,Laura,"Lauren was amazing! Super friendly, accommodating, and communicative. Her apartment was in a great location and is exactly as pictured. We were only in Seattle for one day, so it was perfect for visiting all the major spots - Pike Place, Space Needle, etc."
92835,41350968,2015-08-07,13109657,Jose,Our stay was great! The apartment was convenient to everything we needed to get to. Lauren was very helpful and nice during our stay in the city. I could stay here again. 
92835,42371939,2015-08-13,22958896,Leif,"I am glad to say my first-ever use of Airbnb was a very positive one! I spent four August nights at Lauren's apartment in Downtown Seattle, and I must say I wish I could have made it a few more nights! Lauren was a great host, made sure I had everything I needed, availed herself in the instance I needed anything, and was very accommodating in spite of my flight being delayed.  The apartment was the perfect launching point for my Seattle explorations, whether it was to a Mariners game (just a quick Link ride away), dining in Capitol Hill or Belltown nightlife (just a quick bus away), or a ferry to Bainbridge Island (just a few blocks down the hill). I traveled solo but the apartment is spacious enough for a couple, and even though I brought everything I needed in the way of toiletries, there's plenty of extras in case you forget.) Thank you, Lauren, for helping me get to know a great American city, can't wait to come back!"
92835,42516181,2015-08-14,31985886,Michael,"Excellent location, very friendly host and a comfy bed; what more could you ask for? Oh, you need more? How about a host who will hold your bags and get you some dry towels AFTER you've checked out. I"
92835,42829122,2015-08-16,3660976,Jessica,"Host met up with my boyfriend ahead of the stated check in time, which really helped since we were just about to leave to go out all day/night. The studio was very large in a nice neighborhood, accurate with the listing. We were very happy to have stayed there our 2 days in Seattle."
92835,43209820,2015-08-18,24563714,Samantha,"We had an amazing time in Seattle. The apartment was really cute, quite spacious and perfect for our stay. The location was ideal, walking distance to Pike Place market and the Harbourside. 

Lauren was amazing, so helpful and friendly she was there to greet us and get us settled and able to provide great recommendations for places to go and eat and how to get around.

Would highly recommend to anyone, we would definitely return again."
92835,44411327,2015-08-26,26934136,Christian,Lauren left the place ready to go for me and getting there from SEATAC was easy. The neighbourhood is central and not bad. 
92835,44627132,2015-08-28,22715639,Lisa,Great stay. Lauren's apartment had everything we needed. Very comfy bed and great location! Would recommend.
92835,45059549,2015-08-31,30939468,Molly,"Awesome! Great host, easy to communicate, super cute place. Would love to stay here again. "
92835,45772980,2015-09-06,961258,Jennifer,"Lauren's apartment was the perfect size and very comfortable. It was an easy walk to Pike's Place and the museums. We only needed to use Uber at night. The best aspect of the apartment is how clean it is. I like that it is just for guests and does not have a lot of personal stuff inside. Lauren was very accommodating and allowed us to check in early. It was not an issue for me that the apartment faces the highway and has a lot of background noise. For me, it was white noise, but if you are sensitive to sounds, just consider that. Overall, this is a fine apartment. "
92835,46691960,2015-09-13,29170613,Mathieu,It a great appartment with a very good location. There is lot of space for 2 peoples and the bed is very confortable. Laren received us at 11 pm and give us all info about the appartement. We spent 7 days their and that was great ! Super appartement avec tout ce qu'il faut. Très bien situé pour visiter Seattle. Le lit est très confortable et les voisins très tranquilles. Laren est disponible et répond toujours à nos questions. Nous y avons séjourné pour une période de 7 jours et ce fût fantastique.
92835,46876504,2015-09-14,18334004,Daniel,Lauren did a great job welcoming us in to her apartment. She was very friendly and her place was indeed very charming and clean. It was perfectly located in Seattle and perfectly convenient for short visits to the downtown area. 
92835,47223926,2015-09-16,43957474,Jamie,"Lauren was very accommodating and even allowed early check in. She also helped my find my way on the Link Light Rail, gave me some great recommendations for dinner nearby, and made me feel very welcome. Her apartment was perfectly located for my needs, both as a traveler interested in exploring a new city and someone attending meetings for work. The neighborhood was perfectly safe, and everything that I needed was within walking distance. "
92835,47462534,2015-09-19,30156928,Emily,"Lauren was there to meet us when we got to the apartment, and it was like being greeted by an old friend. Her apartment is the perfect, cozy home base for exploring the city. It was a little hard to sleep the first night with the city noises and brightness from street lights (and the bed is quite squeaky), but after exploring Seattle the second day, we slept much better. Overall, would definitely stay again and recommend!"
92835,47856883,2015-09-21,14734946,Nour,"We had a wonderful stay at Lauren's place! The apartment is nicely furnished and very clean. It is in a perfect location -- walking distance to all the main attractions in Seattle (Pike Place Market, Pioneer Square..). Lauren is an incredible host! She went above and beyond to make sure our stay was comfortable. We would definitely stay here again! "
92835,48070546,2015-09-23,19593677,Roxana,"We stayed  in Lauren's apartment for a few days during September. The apartment was clean, quiet and centrally located with easy access to public transportation. Although the apartment is located near the freeway the noise was not an issue. Lauren was friendly and helpful. Definitely looking forward to visiting again in the near future."
92835,48267202,2015-09-25,32298737,Andy,"Lauren was an awesome host. Her communication was fantastic. She gave helpful directions to find the place, showed me around at checkin, and encouraged me to contact her with any questions. She made it so easy and the location was very convenient. "
92835,49156310,2015-10-01,2807111,Danny,"This listing was very accurate. The location was great for my purposes (working a few blocks away), and the apartment was conveniently near the entrance to the building and not far from the stairs so it was easy to find. Lauren gave me instructions a couple days before my stay, and it was painless to enter the apartment, and just as easy to leave. The apartment itself is no-frills but a comfortable bed and working shower was all I was looking for. 

The unit is right across the street from a main highway, and the windows are not insulated well so there is significant traffic noise at all hours. This does not bother me, but may bother some.

Lauren told me that the landlord of her apartment and building manager know she rents it out and are OK with that. But then she also asked me to tell them (if asked) that I was a friend of hers, which made me uncomfortable. Luckily I did not run into anyone nor have to lie to them."
92835,50066984,2015-10-09,11440747,瑞,The apartment was comfortable and cozy. Lauren is also very helpful and responds very quickly to any questions or request. The location is very convenient and easy to find. Highly recommended!
92835,50434602,2015-10-12,7831926,Laurel,"Lauren was so nice and met us outside and accommodate our schedule. We're used to city life and older homes (a bit of white noise from the freeway and the charms that come from homes built 90+ years ago), so this place was great for us. It was really easy to get there from the airport via Link; just know that it's an uphill walk. The house had all of the amenities that we needed and was a great place to relax after sightseeing. There is so much that you can get to on foot from her place."
92835,50863731,2015-10-15,44637739,Lyn,"Lauren was a very accommodating host. My flight into Seattle was delayed into the night and Lauren kindly made sure that I was still able to access the apartment upon arriving in town. The apartment provided me with all that I needed while working in Seattle for a few days. You could hear some road noise at night but after the first night I must have become used to is because I slept quite well. Very comfortable bed. Lovely towels, and given my late arrival Lauren kindly provided me with some supplies to get me through! The apartment is in a great location, only one block from the Seattle Public Library, a few blocks to the main shopping centre at Pacific Place, with lots of cafes and restaurants within 2-3 blocks heading towards Pike Place. The laundry facilities in the basement were a plus too, just make sure you have a few quarters."
92835,51428444,2015-10-20,36483717,Andy,"Lauren was extremely friendly, helpful, and went above and beyond in helping us retrieve something we had left behind on our stay. She was knowledgeable about the area and quick to respond with any questions we had. Excellent Host. We had a fantastic stay -- the room was bright, cheery, clean, and relaxing. It was located very conveniently to a lot of things we wanted to do in Seattle. This helped to make our honeymoon an incredible experience, and we'll definitely be returning to Seattle again, and likely to Lauren's place if it's available!"
92835,51619945,2015-10-22,43223427,Ricardo,Perfect location for our trip. Lauren was a great host. She let us know the best ways to get around and gave great recommendations on where to eat. Thanks for making our trip better Lauren! 
92835,52126184,2015-10-26,21343217,Gary,The apartment was great.
92835,53237127,2015-11-06,17339159,Elmer,All was outstanding!  Lauren was a gracious and informative host.  The apartment was very comfortable and in a truly convenient location.  We will certainly stay there again.
92835,53554029,2015-11-09,4013496,Jennifer,"Lauren was awesome! She was super responsive and super friendly. Her cute apartment is in a great location (walking distance to everything we wanted to see), and the bed is soooo comfortable. We will definitely be staying with her again!!"
92835,54009247,2015-11-15,10715098,Brian,"We loved staying in Lauren's apartment during our stay in Seattle. The location was perfect, with easy access to light rail and other transportation options.  Plus the place is adorable with all the amenities you'd expect.  Lauren was a kind and gracious host with plenty of restaurant and neighborhood recommendations.  We'd love to stay in the apartment again for our next trip to town!"
92835,54101860,2015-11-16,32044961,Darren,I did not get to meet Lauren as I had to fly in and head directly to the stadium.  She graciously allowed a friend to pick up the key.  She set up an air mattress to accommodate us.  The place was perfectly located and near the Seahawks lair.  It had more than enough amenities.  I will definitely be back everything I stay in Seattle!
92835,54365293,2015-11-18,38398701,Mis,Laura is a warp speed communicator and was extremely helpful! Her apartment was exactly as described and perfect for my last minute trip to Seattle! Great location and super clean! Thanks again!
92835,54577811,2015-11-22,41346007,Ashley,"Fantastic stay! Much better than a hotel (price, space, and location). Felt more like a local than an out-of-towner. Would definitely stay here again. Communication with host was easy, reliable, and comfortable. "
92835,55714755,2015-12-05,32430004,Paige,"Lauren is an amazing host. She was MORE than accommodating and such a light to be welcomed by after traveling. The apartment was sweet, clean, and cozy. Perfect for our quick weekend getaway to the city.  The place is GREAT. I'd suggest it to anyone."
92835,55812329,2015-12-06,32971123,Rubi,"Great location, very comfortable, easy check in check out "
92835,56196473,2015-12-10,30930545,Jeremiah,"When I'm in Seattle for work I really just need a place to sleep and get ready in the morning. Lauren's place vastly exceeded these basic needs. It's very cute, clean, and comfortable. In spite of the fact that I didn't take advantage of most of the amenities, I'm sure they would make for a great several day stay for someone who intended to spend more time there. The location is spectacular -- only a few blocks from my office and close to pretty much everything. Lauren's place will be at the top of my list whenever I come to town for work."
92835,56319372,2015-12-12,49300102,Victoria,"Lauren's apartment was an absolute gem!  Within walking distance to Pioneer Square, Pike's Place and Capitol Hill and very cozy.  Lauren let us check-in early so that we could drop off our bags before heading back out and she gave great directions on how to get to the apartment from the light rail with not too much of a hike.  We would definitely stay here again, thank you Lauren for making our first air bnb experience a success! "
92835,56674374,2015-12-16,10336851,Audrey,"The location was perfect and Lauren was the most helpful host I've had so far! The apartment is spacious, comfortable, and central to all Seattle neighborhoods. Parking was a little difficult but Lauren was super helpful and told us about all the possible places to park. You may end up having to pay about $30 a day to park in the area so I would recommend public transport while staying here. I highly recommend this listing, everything was perfect! "
92835,56870229,2015-12-19,4627976,Kim,"Loved Lauren's apartment. Very convenient for exploring downtown and no need to have a car. Clean, comfortable, cozy. Would definitely stay there again. Thank you Lauren and Happy New Year! "
7151924,42211531,2015-08-11,29482398,Tricia,"My daughter and I loved our stay in Breeze's B n B. The B n B was roomy, clean, comfortable, and artfully decorated. Breeze was quick to respond to messages and provided us with great information regarding the details of the suite. We arrived to a lovely bottle of wine, chocolates, and a hand-written welcome note that made us feel right at home. The B n B was easy to find and located within walking distance to shops and restaurants in Queen Anne. Street parking was available near the B n B. Breeze's B n B was nicer than many of the downtown Seattle hotels we've stayed in. Breeze provided light breakfast fare, beverages, utensils, a hot plate, a microwave and toaster oven, an espresso machine, a French press, ground coffee, tea, an electric kettle, linens, ample fridge space, and pots & pans. Guests can easily make a simple meal or warm-up restaurant left-overs. The large sectional sofa was comfortable and two people can sleep on it. There is also a large screen tv with fantastic surround sound. The bedroom had a cozy queen sized bed and the bathroom was large with a nice shower/tub and vanity. Although our schedules prevented us from meeting in-person, Breeze was kind, courteous, and provided us with a wonderful place to stay while visiting Seattle. I highly recommend you experience Breeze's hospitality for yourself at her lovely Seattle B n B."
7151924,42918109,2015-08-16,1485463,Alexis,Great spot with very friendly and hospitable hosts! The place is modern and cozy with nice touches like radiant heat in the bathroom floor :)
7151924,43829595,2015-08-22,39772752,Zuli,"My stay was fabulous!  The living quarters are decorated like something out of a magazine!  Everything was comfortable- bed, couch, etc.  I’m a person who likes to fall asleep watching TV, so the 65” flat screen didn’t hurt.  Whatever I needed was there in the unit- extra blanket, plates, forks, knives, etc.  

The location is centrally located.  My hosts were great people and very accommodating!  The neighborhood is nice and quiet- street parking is available.  The wi-fi was great but I had no cell service in the unit.  

This was my first Airbnb experience.  I am a known hotel snob and lover of room service, but I will seek Breeze out for all future trips to Seattle!!  Overall great experience.   "
7151924,45132785,2015-08-31,6396731,Carol,"Breeze and Kartik were perfect hosts! They were extremely warm and considerate, and we appreciated their attention to details, which made our stay so comfortable. At first, we were a bit nervous about our privacy in the mother-in-law suite, but within the first day, we realized the common entryway was not a problem since they used a separate entrance. The apartment is beautiful and very clean, and the kitchen was well-stocked with wine, beer, chocolates, and everything needed to make a delicious cup of coffee (or tea!). Breeze and Kartik were very sweet, and they even provided umbrellas to keep us dry in the Seattle rain. In addition to the great accommodations, we loved the location of this BnB. Queen Anne allowed for an easy walk to Fremont and downtown (so long as you’re up for a bit of walking and hills). It is a quiet and charming neighborhood in close proximity to great restaurants, markets, cafes, and bars. We will recommend the Queen Breeze BnB to anyone staying in Seattle!"
7151924,45814161,2015-09-06,39078291,Tana,"This was our first time trying out Airbnb and if our next experiences are anything like this one, we will never stay in a hotel again. I can't recommend Breeze and Kartik's place enough. The neighborhood is beautiful and close enough to walk to several different neighborhoods. The amenities beat anything you will find at a good hotel. Breeze was very helpful and accommodating to our flight schedules. We even arrived to a handwritten card, chocolates, wine, beer, and other treats. We owe Breeze and Kartik a bottle of wine and beer so hopefully we will be able to stay here again soon! "
7151924,46567415,2015-09-11,43794003,Marisa,"Breeze is amazing!  She graciously squeezed us in last minute as my husband and I were scrambling for lodging the day of our arrival into the city.  We arrived at the suite and were so impressed, from the amazing entertainment system to the kitchen stocked with fun appliances and treats, everything was dialed in!  The suite was super cozy yet so hip and stylish and we felt right at home during our stay.  The neighborhood was quiet and charming with plenty of street parking and centrally located.  Breeze went above and beyond for us which we are very thankful for! "
7151924,47209742,2015-09-16,6598794,Brad,"We had a great time at this comfy apartment in Queen Anne. It was well appointed and a great home base for exploring the city. The close by restaurants, and grocery stores were a bonus. Thanks for a great stay."
7151924,49577060,2015-10-04,366302,Eric,"amazing last minute booking for the nw chocolate festival weekend. 
had a wonderful stay.  located in a cute safe neighboorhood and close to wonderful markets and restaurants.  Metropolitan 24hr market - nice selection - good veggies.  Macrina bakery/cafe  - yummy baked goods, desserts, and savories.  Both places were great, since I was in chocolate lectures, demos, and panels all day.

I wish had more time to visit nearby chocolopolis and molly moon's ice cream/dairy.  Also, I skipped the amazing selection of coffee in the kitchen and the nearby area to save my tastebuds for chocolate.

5 Spot was a really nice nearby restaurant to meet up with my artist friends with small kids for dinner.

They have a really helpful guidebook of the nearby area.
Breeze was away, but I was able to contact her by text with prompt replies and recommendations.

I was able to cook and prepare simple dishes in the mini kitchen
really nice cookware, knives, and utensils.

quiet, comfy, and relaxing.   The decor has a nice seattle hip vibe.
soft and lux towels and bathrobes.

weather was beautiful, otherwise the cute mini umbrellas would have helpful.

great place and host!!!"
7151924,51376486,2015-10-19,18289690,Jenny,"This beautifully decorated apartment with private entrance is exactly as described/pictured. Breeze and her husband, Kartik, provided everything (and more!) that we needed to make our 5th anniversary celebration weekend in Seattle phenomenal. Bedding and bath were comfortable and luxurious; the heated floors in the bathroom were a wonderful bonus on drizzly days. The well-appointed kitchen boasted dual refrigerators, sink, ice maker, toaster oven, microwave, hot plate, Nespresso machine, french press coffeemaker, and more and was well-stocked with gourmet coffee grounds, Nespresso pods in multiple flavors, flavored sparkling waters, local brews, chocolates and even a bottle of wine. We had some trouble establishing the wireless connection for cable television the first night at the apartment and Breeze and Kartik were incredibly quick to follow up with us. Within hours of our message, all of the kinks with the television were ironed out and the system was working perfectly. The neighborhood surrounding the apartment is a huge bonus. The streets are quiet and tree-lined and there are several parks within walking distance. We also loved that we were no more than 4 blocks from grocery and retail stores and great restaurants like Ethan Stowell's How to Cook a Wolf. Public transit has a pick up merely one block from the house which is convenient for trips downtown and beyond. Uber also services the neighborhood. We relied primarily on Uber and spent approximately $8-$14 per one way trip around town - Fremont, Capitol Hill, Downtown, etc. If you have the chance to book this gorgeous space, do it! For the extremely reasonable price, you won't find a hotel with amenities as posh as this. Thanks again to both Breeze and Kartik for an incredible experience!"
4637670,23486122,2014-12-01,24273308,Danielle,"Benji was a great host! He showed us around and made us feel welcome. His place is wonderful, we woke up to a great view of Seattle."
4637670,23661304,2014-12-07,24301128,Matt,This is a nice little spot about a 5 minute walk from the convention center. Benji was a good host and was flexible with check-in and checkout times which I really appreciated. The place was clean and not as noisy as I thought it would be being so close to the freeway. Perfect spot if you need a place to crash and want to do things in the city but not stay in the heart of downtown. I would definitely rent from Benji again.
4637670,24007191,2014-12-16,23835654,David,Benji was very accommodating and the apartment had a great view. Only about a 15-20min walk from pike place and right by capital hill the location made exploring downtown Seattle very easy.
4637670,24208717,2014-12-22,23358511,Víctor,Very nice place. Very flexible with times and arrangement. 
4637670,24439073,2014-12-28,24711531,Stefan,"Benji was a great host, we needed to get in early and he was flexible with his timing. The apartment was as described, beautiful view and great furnishings. Easy walk to the market and had everything we needed to cook the fish we bought there. Very very appreciative of Benji and his apartment!"
4637670,24502571,2014-12-29,15246784,Nathalie,"Benjis place was comfortable, and in a convenient spot. Thanx Benji  "
4637670,24749861,2015-01-02,17433112,Art,"Great location and comfortable apartment with plenty of restaurants and bars within walking distance. The view from Benji's place was also awesome. Benji was a wonderful, friendly, and helpful host. "
4637670,25068558,2015-01-05,8943635,Shea,"Great small and affordable place within walking distance of everything we were interested in during our short stay. Benji was very welcoming and helpful. The traffic noise is something to be aware of, but nothing some earplugs can't fix."
4637670,25505386,2015-01-18,4732308,Meagan,My boyfriend and I had an awesome stay at Benji's apartment! We were in town for a show at the Paramount and we could literally see the venue from the window. The place was clean and cozy and it was easy to communicate with Benji. I highly recommend.
4637670,25609011,2015-01-20,5051171,Jeff,"Benji's studio was just what we needed for an easy trip to Seattle. The apartment is clean and comfortable, with a little kitchen that had what we needed (though we mostly ate out). 

The location is very convenient, but I'm glad I packed ear plugs since it is right next to the interstate. We walked to the convention center and favorite restaurants downtown. Capital Hill, Pike Place Market, and Seattle Center are also in reasonable walking distance. 

Bottom line - I would stay here again!"
4637670,26112522,2015-02-03,6512659,Lauren,"Our experience at this High-rise Studio was fantastic! Benji was an awesome host: He was very flexible with the check-in/out times, super responsive to questions, and provided us with stay essentials. 

The apartment itself is in prime Capitol Hill location, with easy access to restaurants and shops, and only a short walk to the Link. The tower is near the freeway, but the apartment is on a high floor and the traffic is an unobtrusive white noise. It really was perfect for us.

We would absolutely recommend this studio and Benji to others! Thanks, Benji!"
4637670,26325022,2015-02-09,7915865,David,"We had a great time staying at Benji's place for a weekend. What we liked most was the central location of his apartment. We were within walking distance of most places in central Seattle. Something to note is that his apartment is pretty close to the interstate, so keep this in mind if you need a 0 decibel sleeping environment. The apartment itself was simple, clean and Benji was very easy to work with and accommodating to our schedule. Benji was very quick to answer our questions and respond to our inquiries. All in all Benji's apartment was everything we needed and we would stay there again. "
4637670,26985439,2015-02-23,1028678,Peter,"Although we never actually met Benji, he was very quick to respond and was very flexible in arranging around our arrival and departure schedules. His space was as described and an excellent home base for exploring Seattle and seeing a show at the Paramount. Other reviewers have noted the noise due to the building's proximity to Interstate 5 - definitely bring earplugs. The noise level may decrease slightly in the evenings, but it never entirely lets up."
4637670,28024115,2015-03-16,28196080,J. Bacchus,"The studio is ideally located, immaculate, and has everything needed for a weekend on the town."
4637670,28435891,2015-03-23,7746950,Matt,"Great space and exceptionally clean. I didn't meet Benji, but he made the experience fairly easy. Great access to all of the places downtown, I was able to walk everywhere. Look forward to coming back. 
"
4637670,28775363,2015-03-30,1570699,Jimmy,Benji and and his place was amazing. He was very flexible on the check in and check out times. His studio was 3 blocks from the convention center and a couple of blocks from many great restaurants. There may be some noise from the nearby freeway but it never bothered me. I had a great stay and would definitely stay again. 
4637670,29274164,2015-04-06,25659147,Hailey,"Benji's place in Seattle was wonderful. My boyfriend and I felt super welcome - check in and check out was super smooth and easy. We used Benji's kitchen to cook a meal that we bought at pike place market... that we walked to and from! Everything was super quick and easy to get to. Even street parking was easier than we thought. 

Thanks for letting us stay Benji! "
4637670,30363647,2015-04-20,23711351,Ameer,"Benji had a great apartment in a very good location. The view was fantastic and there were no issues. We did not actually meet Benji but he made it very easy to check in and check out without any hassle.

It made my weekend in Seattle much more enjoyable to have an affordable place to stay in a great location."
4637670,31371006,2015-05-04,14152080,Debbie,Benji's place was great and very conveniently located. We were able to walk pretty much everywhere. His place was very clean and comfortable to stay at. He made it really easy to pick up keys and was very flexible about checking in and out.  
4637670,31901963,2015-05-11,24347354,Tara,"Location was ideal! I am a light sleeper so I had to use earplugs for freeway noise. The apartment was clean and cozy, I would definitely stay here again. "
4637670,32481697,2015-05-18,16817805,Angel,"Benji is the man hands down! As far as the studio...everything you need. Clean, accessible, and a rad view. Benji made tons of recommendations and we weren't disappointed. Definitely staying here next time in Seattle. "
4637670,33899877,2015-06-02,28375933,Ruzaliya Rose,"Pros: nice, clean apartment, great location, walking distance to many attractions! The KeyCafe service was very convenient to pick up and drop off the keys without having to arrange a meeting with the host.
Cons: very close to I-5 freeway and is a little noisy; also got a little warm during the day (end of May)."
4637670,35070538,2015-06-15,29112562,Marco,"I had a great experience staying at Benji's place. His place is very clean, comfy, and in walking distance to a lot of areas. It's really close to the Link Light Rail and bus depot if you need it. Benji was really helpful and quickly answered any questions I had. I highly recommend his place if you're coming to visit and explore Seattle!"
4637670,35924779,2015-06-23,31861553,Lonnie,"Benji is a great guy. He met us at the place and was very accommodating. You'll like him right off the bat. The place is charming, in an older 12 or 13 story building. It's about a quarter of a mile from Pikes Market and downtown, certainly walkable. It's clean and has everything you'll need to enjoy the city.  "
4637670,36514669,2015-06-29,29999128,Jeff,"Great little place.  Great location.  Host was accommodating and friendly, and he responded right away to messages.  Hard to ask for more.  We'll be back.  "
4637670,38265189,2015-07-14,31741782,Evan,"The apartment was exactly as advertised - clean, well arranged, and convenient to downtown/Capitol Hill. Benji was a great host - easy to contact leading up, and very prompt and accommodating once we arrived.  We had a fantastic trip & owe much of it to finding this great listing over a summer weekend."
4637670,38988682,2015-07-20,8058990,Bianca,"Benji was a good host. Amazing location very close to downtown and Capitol Hill. Easy to contact, clean. I would recommend this place. "
4637670,40161512,2015-07-28,2855234,Srihari,"Absolutely enjoyed our stay at Benji's place. Everything was as described; place was clean, well maintained and Benji gave wonderful instructions regarding all the little things."
4637670,40889673,2015-08-03,4968274,Tyler,"Benji was just the kind of host we like -- friendly and to the point.  He met us to drop off the keys, showed us the ins and outs, and then left us to enjoy.

Great location and pretty much looks like we expected.  Big windows with a great view.

The only downside was pretty specific to our trip.  It happened to get up to about 95F that weekend, which made the apartment very hot with those big windows and no A/C.  Benji provided a fan and that helped, but it was still quite warm even at night.  On a regular day this probably would not have been an issue."
4637670,42112510,2015-08-11,10922551,Marissa,"You get what you pay for and while this was no 5 star experience it was well-priced, clean, and worked out just fine for us since we were not in the room much. "
4637670,43236387,2015-08-18,29275049,Roary,Benji was great and very easy to work with....he was very willing to work with our late arrival time and then a flight delay.  The apartment was great and as promised; the location is ideal and the facilities were good.  The bed was very comfortable...would stay with Benji again!
4637670,43838032,2015-08-22,20971628,Todd,"What a great experience! Centrally located, terrific view, clean and comfy. Not to mention, the host is more than accommodating and made checking in and out seamless. "
4637670,45242041,2015-09-01,28725025,Brianna,"This apartment was in a cool location, close to the convention center which we walked to each day. Also walking distance to the waterfront and pikes place. The host made it easy to check in and out. We only had a car for one day and used uber the rest. But mostly walking which was the best way to get around. Parking across the street to pay for overnight. The place was clean and had all amenities needed for a weekend stay. The view was pretty cool as well and we could open windows for a nice breeze. The apartment is small generally but we really liked the style and I actually thought it was big for a studio. It was perfect size for 2 people. Has kitchen but we ate out mostly. "
4637670,46121589,2015-09-08,33704968,Meher,Benji was a great host. Very receptive and flexible with check in and check out timings. 
4637670,48640011,2015-09-27,44711244,Heather,"I didn't meet Benji, but he was a very responsive host. Flexible with check in and out he provided a smooth experience. His space was exactly what we were looking for, close to what we wanted with everything we needed. We were able to pay for parking right next to the building and walk to shops and restaurants including pike place market and the Capitol Hill area. As a city dweller the noise didn't bother me at all. I would absolutely stay again. "
4637670,48972500,2015-09-29,30802037,Tait,"Benji was a great host.  The Apartment was very clean.  Towels were laid out and ready to use, Bathroom and kitchen were clean.  The neighborhood was right between downtown and Capital Hill.  Huge variety of restaurants, music venues and mass transit.  Thanks for the great experience."
4637670,52287285,2015-10-27,14334206,Shalyn,"Didnt get to meet Benji but he was always quick to respond to all of my over planning text messages! Neighborhood wasn't a bad place and like everyone else has said it is true to be right between capital hill and downtown, walking distance to both areas or just a quick $5 Uber. Perfect little apartment for 2 people to stay, we felt very comfortable and at home. If you're tall you might have a hard time with the low shower head as my boyfriend did but definitely wasn't a big enough problem where we wouldn't stay there again. Kitchen is very small and refrigerator is tiny but we didn't need it for more than a few of our beers anyways :) and morning drinks at the kitchen table or on the couch is an awesome unique view of Seattle and Paramount Theater.  "
4047399,22270199,2014-11-02,22736768,Ian,Meghan's apartment was in a great location. The apartment itself is very cozy - the pictures don't do it justice - and we loved the area around it. Highly recommended!
4047399,36392379,2015-06-28,27080077,Nick,"Meghan is super friendly and hospitable. Her apartment is very modern and well-kept, but most importantly, directly next to Seattle Center. We had a great time!"
4047399,43412022,2015-08-19,39608730,James,"This is a fantastic property!  Easy walking distance to all Space Needle attractions, safe walk to Kerry Park and the beauty of Queen Anne.  Solid restaurant, cafe and coffee recommendations.  Very safe area.  Didn't bother with a rental car - just walked, used the monorail and Uber.  The apartment was spotless.  Never met Meghan, but communication was simple using text and the AirBnb app."
4047399,43937992,2015-08-23,24713363,Sam,"Roya and I really enjoyed staying here. Meghan was a very good host.  The apartment and building was clean and updated, and the rooftop made it super special.  There was so much to do in the local neighborhood that we only took a few trips outside of it, and really felt that the neighborhood was the best of it all.  Seattle is an amazing place, and staying by the tranquil Seattle Center is a huge perk.  "
4047399,46118036,2015-09-08,19916845,Stephanie,"My partner and I loved our stay at Meghans, it was exactly like the photos, very clean and located in such an amazing spot, right outside of the festival we were attending! The instructions and rules were simple and easy to follow and Meghan made it easy to get in touch! "
2898954,45017340,2015-08-30,3978147,Joshua,Diane was very welcoming. The room and bathroom were really nice with a private entry. We even got fresh baked blueberry muffins in the morning!
2898954,45168476,2015-08-31,41594079,Dimpy,"Listing was very accurate, Diane was very welcoming and very friendly. She offered us freshly baked blueberry muffins which were yummy!! There were also some free drinks, fruits, tea, coffee, oatmeal bars and yogurt for a quick snack."
2898954,45325416,2015-09-01,33320822,Tatiana,"We had an awesome stay at Diane's house. The location is just perfect (10 min with the Light Rail to downtown) and the house is gorgeous. We could enjoy the whole basement and had everything we needed. Moreover, we could enjoy a perfect light breakfast with all the things Diane had placed in the fridge for us (fruit, yogurt, tea, coffee, cheese, beverages). Diane is also super friendly and provides the best advice ever about Seattle. We would definitely recommend her place to our friends that would like to travel to Seattle."
2898954,46030379,2015-09-07,31697630,Reuben,"Staying with Diane was easy and comfortable. The bed was excellent, the bathroom was beautiful and it was a nice quiet neighborhood. The mini fridge and granola was a huge help and my experience there was really my idea of an ideal AirBnB visit. "
2898954,46341139,2015-09-09,21178477,Alphecca,"There are not enough words to describe how awesome Diane and her husband are.  I found a jewel 2 miles from downtown!  The bed was extremely comfortable, room was spacious, and so was the bathroom.  Diane was very accommodating to some last minute requests and responded to my texts within minutes.  She also provided snacks, beverages, and lots of good info about the city!  Will definitely be back soon!  Thanks again!  "
2898954,46674937,2015-09-12,42522935,Andrew,"Diane hosts a lovely and amazing space.  Diane is just lovely as a host and their home is exactly as described... updated and modern, a delightful place to stay!  You will not be disappointed at this charming and beautiful home."
2898954,46775245,2015-09-13,41865766,Elyse,We had a great time in Seattle staying with Dianne. Her place was clean and in a great location. Very easy to get around using transportation. She was very helpful with figuring out the transit. Would recommend to a friend!
2898954,47133173,2015-09-15,27507633,Monica,"We had a wonderful stay at Diane's place.  Diane and her husband and mother were very welcoming and hospitable. Diane went over different places we might like to visit in the area and also out of it (for the rest of our trip north of Seattle).  The private room and bathroom were very comfortable and there was also a fridge nearby stocked w/great goodies. For breakfast in the morning there was yogurt and granola and Diane also made some delicious chocolate cookies. The location was also perfect; only a few blocks to the light rail, which we took to Pike's Place and downtown Seattle.  And the neighborhood was lovely; we really enjoyed walking it. All in all, a great find!"

I will definitely be staying here again if I come back! It's less than a block from the bus stop and a very short walk to the light rail! Bed is comfy, bathroom is super clean and modern! Diane provided healthy snacks and drinks which was amazing and super helpful for our stay. I'd definitely recommend this place! :)"

Et enfin notre hôte a fait tout ce qui était possible pour que notre séjour soit réussie. Petites attentions pour le petit .déjeuner "
2898954,50664239,2015-10-13,25320944,Maggie,"This was our favorite airbnb place we've stayed in so far! Even though its listed under private room, it really felt like a guest house or a tiny little house separate from the main house. It was spacious and VERY CLEAN. Diane provided healthy, delicious snacks that we couldn't get enough of. The bathroom was so clean and all the products were either Seattle based companies or organic, which we really appreciated! Diane left Seattle magazines and maps, which helped us greatly. We will be staying here again for sure!"
2898954,51376297,2015-10-19,33900035,Derek,This room was clean and accommodating as described and more!  We had a wonderful weekend in Seattle attending the SeaHawks game and this location was perfect for enjoying downtown and getting to the stadium and to/from the airport without needing a rental car.  Diane and Gary were great hosts and even invited us up to chat one morning over a breakfast snack.  I would stay here again in a heartbeat!
2898954,51756436,2015-10-24,44546102,Anna,Diane met us at the door and was ever so friendly and engaging!  The room was just as described and pictured online.  The bed was very comfy......we're fussy and this was wonderful!   We noticed so many details that Diane had attended to.  And then there was the cream for our morning coffee.....such a nice touch!  We definitely recommend!
2898954,52095677,2015-10-26,44755879,Christa,"This was our first airbnb experience and we were pleasantly  surprised on how much we loved it! Diane made us feel so welcome.  The set up was wonderful, it felt like we had our own guest house.  It was so clean and the house and  neighborhood were  beautiful.   The location was perfect and close to all the public transportation  you need. I cant wait to return to Seattle and stay with Diane again. :)"
2898954,57079813,2015-12-21,16632938,Karen,Diane & family were wonderful hosts. The room & bathroom were clean & private. The snacks & coffee for the morning were such a nice touch. She even offered us some baked treats fresh out of the oven. The area was nice & we felt safe walking to our friends birthday party a few blocks away. Our only regret was not getting to know our hosts a little better. 
2134911,14753347,2014-06-25,16358872,Daniel,"The Studio at Mibbett Hollow was everything promised from the advertisement and very comfortable; the location and view were even better! I was a first-time boat dweller and I loved it. Princess, the cat, is a sweetheart and Lynne is a delight to get to know. Everyone at the marina was friendly; the location is safe and convenient. "
2134911,15078535,2014-07-01,16969057,Debra,"Had a great visit with my son and stayed on Lynne's great houseboat. She was there to share info as needed, pick up milk for my morning tea and was a good unobtrusive host. We chatted in the evenings briefly if we were both around. The studio is comfy and princess the cat is a nice occasional visitor : ) Easy to get to, onsite parking, comforts of home away from home and anticipated boat facilities. I will surely be back now that my son is a Seattle transplant. 
"
2134911,16169810,2014-07-22,18103221,Aleksandra,"Lynne was a wonderful host. She welcomed me and told me everything I needed to know, she even took me to the grocery I needed to get to! The place was cozy and comfortable and her cat, princess was precious."
2134911,16368611,2014-07-26,17956443,Joseph,"Lynn was gracious and helpful. It was a great time to stay on a Seattle house boat.
It's great to see the boats go by in the morning, right out the window."
2134911,19377114,2014-09-11,2330676,Sally,"Lynne was a very gracious host, she met me at the houseboat the first day and went over everything I needed to know.  I had a magical experience on the water in her home, I will gladly visit again.  The location of her home is very close to the Ballard & Fremont neighborhoods, which was a perfect location for my trip. Thanks again Lynne for your hospitality!"
6288141,41220867,2015-08-05,33364290,JoAnn,Love this apartment! The pictures are very accurate. Location worked great...we actually walked along Lake Union to Capital Hill for dinner and ran the Green Lake loop the next morning. Highly recommend.
6288141,44422839,2015-08-26,13871618,Colleen,"Enjoyed our stay at the apartment....it was pretty, neat and clean and close to all we love in Fremont, Wallingford and Ballard"
6288141,45093111,2015-08-31,36856086,Al,"Autum, our host, was great.  The apartment was good for 5-6 people and was close to restaurants and bars.  "
6288141,50778301,2015-10-14,9243370,Ever,"Lori's place is really nice! Big windows, well-equipped kitchen, comfy beds, lovely bathroom, and most importantly, beautiful view of the city. Autumn is very welcome and helpful. My friends and I had a lot of fun there. It feels like home."
2660384,12306108,2014-04-28,6248754,Kevin,The apartment was perfect in terms of space and size.  Well furnished and clean.  In an excellent location in Belltown.  Michael was great to work with. 
2660384,12959385,2014-05-15,4335011,Marie,"This was a great place to stay, especially if you need to be downtown. Everything was very clean and tidy, just as advertised. Michael was wonderful as a host and very accommodating. Thanks for a great ten day stay."
2660384,13017872,2014-05-17,10360056,Taran,Spot was clean and cozy. Michael was very helpful and quick to respond to all questions. 
2660384,13750532,2014-06-03,14829525,Jeanne,The apartment is very clean. Great location and Michael is a responsive and attentive host. 
2660384,13896656,2014-06-07,14795241,Jonathan,"Michael's place was exactly what I was after - a good location, clean and tidy. Definitely towards the 'functional' end of the few airbnb places I've stayed but the area, convenience and view made the apartment well worth it. "
2660384,13963980,2014-06-09,123822,Lisa & Phil,"The apartment was clean, secure, comfortable, and had a great view! We really loved the Belltown location -- close to entertainment and nice restaurants but not in a high traffic area. Communication with Michael was clear and prompt. We had a great stay!"
2660384,14134552,2014-06-12,16306746,Martin,"Second floor apartment is very small with only windows facing onto a rather busy Western Avenue. No AC or cross ventilation requires windows to be open in the summer - creating abundant noise. The unit is situated directly across the street from an active homeless shelter, ""the millionairs club,"" potentially creating a less than secure atmosphere at night especially for female travelers. As the security gate to the inner courtyard did not properly close, we had to rebuff someone inside the courtyard wanting access to the apartment unit. This could have been a problem if he was was aggressive. Safety is a real issue here. "
2660384,14379785,2014-06-17,12880590,Nicole,"PROS:  This unit has a GREAT location with quick walking access to many attractions.   The bed is extremely comfortable and it's easy to get in and out of the secure unit with Lock-Box access. 

CONS:  The unit is located on a Noisy Street, hence the great location.   The curtains are fairly thin & translucent, and there is a bright street light outside the unit.  If you are a heavy sleeper, you probably won't even notice.  If you are a light sleeper, bring an eye mask and you should be fine.  

"
2660384,14564607,2014-06-22,14527537,Liz,"We enjoyed staying at Michael's apartment very much and would definitely choose to stay there again. The location is excellent, easy walking distance to Pike Place market, great restaurants, the Space Needle and the main shopping streets. Michael does not live there and has equipped the apartment to meet the needs of his guests with fast wifi, comfy bed and lots of good quality bedding and towels. As everyone else says, it is spotlessly clean. I must mention the air bed! It plugs into the electric and within a few minutes turns into a queen sized comfy bed nearly as high as the real one! Michael is great at communicating with his guests and quick to respond. I disagree with Martin, the previous reviewer, about the location. It feels safe and the place across the road is for people to drop in and find work. No harm in that surely. It is on a main road so there is some traffic noise but it did not disturb us. Perhaps on a hot day with the windows open it might bother light sleepers. Personally, it's something I would put up with because of all the other benefits. Thank you Michael."
2660384,15403683,2014-07-08,4602273,Christa,"Michael was a great host! He was always available to answer any questions I had, and that was very much appreciated. The apartment was exactly what I was expecting from the description and pictures on the listing...and incredibly CLEAN! The bed was very comfortable (I think I want to buy a memory foam mattress now!), with the perfect amount of pillows. :) The Wi-Fi was fast, which was awesome since my boyfriend and I both needed to use our laptops for work while we were in town. We were both grateful that Michael had recently added an AC unit since it was a bit warm (by Seattle's standards) while we were there (side note: the AC unit was a bit noisy when we were trying to sleep, but I'd rather have a noisy AC unit than none at all!). We loved how close we were to both Pike Place and Seattle Center, and the view of the water was great, especially on the 4th of July. 

Unlike one of the previous reviewers, I did not feel unsafe at all. There is NOT ""an active homeless shelter"" across the street...it's a charity that provides help to people who are experiencing homelessness and/or unemployment by giving them temporary job assignments, meals, shower & laundry facilities, and other social services. I didn't feel threatened by anyone I saw going in or out of the facility across the street. Additionally, I didn't have any problems with the gate to the inner courtyard...you have to pull on it to make sure it clicks into place, but that's not so hard to do (it certainly didn't cause me any trouble or make me feel unsafe, that's for sure). The lock on the door to the apartment itself was a bit tricky to get the hang of, but once I figured it out the first day I didn't have any further problems with it during the following four days we were there. 

I would recommend this apartment to anyone wanting to visit Seattle, and I would definitely stay here (or at any of Michael's other properties) again in the future!"
2660384,15557313,2014-07-11,1964531,Kent,"The place was perfect for my needs (even had A/C for the unusually hot days I was in town) during a 2 day business trip to town. Loved the Belltown area, great for wandering and finding restaurants and bars, and great spot to take off on a run near the water. Would definitely stay here again.

Place was clean and pickup/dropoff of keys was super convenient."
2660384,15783887,2014-07-15,4492037,Ahmed,"We enjoyed staying at Michael's Belltown apartment. It was clean and stocked with all the basics like soap, shampoo, paper towels, etc. Michael also did a great job staying in touch during our stay. Highly recommended."
2660384,16201721,2014-07-23,14807902,Yuen,"The host is really helpful, he answer every single email and phonecall within minutes, the appartment is small but more than enough for 2-3ppl for a week. 
The location is really convenient, its just 10mins walking distance from the pike market place and 15mins or less to the Space needle, and there are plenty of great restaurants around that area. 
The appartment has everything you need for a week, the only downside will be that the AC was too loud but Michael has told me that he will replace/fix it so It should be good later on.
I would give it 9/10, love the place and Michael was really helpful even when we arrived at night the first night and we had to call him.

If I go to seattle again I will definetely try to get this place one more time.

Thanks
"
2660384,17128623,2014-08-07,12461084,Catherine,"The apartment was perfect for our quick stay in Seattle.  Everything appeared very neat and clean and the beds were quite comfortable (my friend loved the air mattress!).  There's a Roku with Netflix streaming which is a nice touch.  The air conditioner was essential during our stay and we were definitely grateful it was there.  I would definitely stay here again and recommend it to others.  It's super close to Pike Place as well, which was really nice."
2660384,17139254,2014-08-08,1002779,Megan,The reservation was canceled 21 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
2660384,17193453,2014-08-08,17614742,Adria,"I am always inclined to say nice things because I do not want to hurt the but this place was beyond the pale.  i am including pic of the most offensive issue. However, let me begin with what was obvious from the beginning.  The apartment is VERY LOUD during the day and at night.  As if we actually had our beds on the street.  The street itself is very busy (Western Ave.-a downtown through street) and there is construction going on across the street.  The curtains are sheer -- attractive but they do not keep out any light.  This includes street lights, the construction site which has all night lights, as well as the shelter across the road, with people coming in and out at all hours of the night.  Very important for us, basic amenities were not provided, including a coffee maker or wash cloths, which we consider to be very basic and .has been available in every other VRBO, Airbnb, HomeAway and hotel/motel we have stayed in. 

Lastly, the pics are of the packed on dirt on the bathroom sink. ( Unable to attach for some reason.)

Despite all of this, the owner took advantage of the market and extracted $274 from us for a single night.
"
2660384,17388569,2014-08-11,5878573,John,"The apartment was fine for our needs - a one night stay in Seattle. Everything was to our satisfaction and Michael responded to our emails and texts promptly. Thanks, Michael!"
2660384,17940633,2014-08-19,17293264,Brandy,"This apartment was perfect for our 2 day stay in Seattle.  It was within walking distance of everything we wanted to see and do (including Pike Place Market and the Space Needle).  The host replied to questions/concerns very quickly, always available to help which was much appreciated.  

there was a bit of construction going on right outside the window covering up the ""view"" when we were there.  This would have been more of a problem if we had stayed in the room the whole time, but since the pier was a short 2 block walk from the apartment it didn't matter much.   

Overall, had a great experience!  Would definitely re-book for a weekend stay, but possibly seek out a more reasonably priced place for a longer stay.  "
2660384,18313598,2014-08-25,2331527,Tiffany,"The host did his best to be accommodating, but I should have heeded other reviews that complained about very loud street noise and loud A/C noise. The windows are closed but they're very thin and definitely not double paned because all street noise can be heard very clearly inside the studio. The street noise ranges from loud drunken pedestrians late at night to transportation trucks in the pre-dawn hours. The A/C is too loud to leave on during sleeping hours. There's also no view from this apt because a new building is being constructed across the street. I would not stay here again nor would I recommend it."
2660384,18618642,2014-08-29,4969724,Payton,"Michael was very accommodating to our travel plans and was very flexible in checkin time which made our stay so much easier and more enjoyable. His apartment is in a perfect location for those that want to explore Seattle. The apt was walking distance from great restaurants, bars, sightseeing spots, the waterfront, etc... We couldn't have had a more enjoyable stay. "
2660384,18707485,2014-08-31,14816896,Michelle,"Michael was able (willing?!?) to allow me to stay for just one night in the middle of a long holiday weekend.  I very much appreciated that accommodation.  I found the condo to be clean and tidy.  There was a locked security gate into the courtyard and another locked door to access the building which was great since I was a single woman alone for my stay.  I did not feel comfortable going out alone during the evening as the surrounding area was a little ""dicey' for my comfort level.  The unit was noisy due to the street traffic (even with ear plugs).  Michael did provide a floor fan and a portable window A/C unit.  Though a little loud, both were appreciated as it was a little warm.  Would have liked to see some kind of instruction or info on operating the digital TV/Roku but was able to get a couple local channels.   Felt the bathroom sink was in need of replacement due to chips/nicks that were repaired and the rust on the overflow.   Was surprised the unit did not have a microwave.  We had a little miscommunication about leaving the key when I departed, but it worked out.  All in all, for one night, it was fine.  "
2660384,19037515,2014-09-05,19386936,Jaime,"The apartment was just like staying in a hotel only much less expensive. The studio is clean, simple and just what we needed on our vacation. The location is excellent for walking to just about anywhere in the city. Michael was very responsive and quick to solve an issue we had with obtaining the entry key. The bed was comfy and there were plenty of linens. The kitchen was stocked with all the basic necessities for cooking and there was even coffee and coffee filters. It appears to be a well managed building, the grounds felt safe and were clean as well. There is a construction project across the street so we did have a bit of noise but overall I really enjoyed staying here!"
2660384,19470862,2014-09-13,19483085,Sirigoon,"Great location.  Easy access to everything.  Instructions given by the host was thorough and easy to follow. Love the fact that there was a/c.  The a/c unit was a bit noisy, but it kept the room nice and cool.  We were there in Sept so it can get kind of hot and stuffy even with the window opened so we were thankful for the a/c.  Place was also nice and clean. The only complaint was that when you go outside, the hallway by the elevator always smells like someone was smoking pot.  However,  this is Seattle where it's legal so that's not something that can be avoided.  You just have to go with it and you cannot smell it once you are inside the unit."
2660384,19764697,2014-09-17,21033986,Josh,"Apartment/studio was clean, and decently furnished. Smaller than I expected, but otherwise a good spot to crash for the night!"
2660384,19975222,2014-09-21,5362184,Tanya,"Michael was very responsive and very accommodating to my boyfriend and me who were visiting Seattle. He answered all of my questions promptly and did everything he could to be helpful and make sure we had a good trip.

His apartment was perfect for what we needed. From his doorsteps we were able to walk to everything we wanted to do - dinner and drinks in  Belltown, a visit to Pike's, Oysters downtown, and even the ferry terminal to Bainbridge. As some reviews mentioned, with the window open there is some street noise, but we thought the fan and AC worked just fine and didn't disturb our sleep. 

His apartment was also very clean and tidy and very spacious for a couple. I'd definitely recommend staying here, especially if you want to be in a cool neighborhood with lots in the surrounding blocks. Had a great time. Great stay."
2660384,20303552,2014-09-27,21155888,Joseph,"This was a very comfortable and clean apartment in a fabulous, up-and-coming neighborhood in Seattle.  There is a wide array of restaurants, coffee shops and even the fabulous, world famous El Gaucho restaurant is on the same block.  We walked to Pike Place, Seattle Art Museum and the Big (Ferris) Wheel.  The Lucky Diner is a throwback to the 1950s - say hi to Kevin, who runs the place.  If you want to watch a movie where food and drinks are served - the ""Big Picture"" is steps away (though we didn't stop by there - highly recommended by locals).  If you love jazz, Tula's and Jazz Alley are in walking distance.  We even walked about 6 blocks to the Space Needle, Chihuly Museum of Glass and the Experience Music Project at Seattle Center.

The only two negatives we perceived - (a) the existence of a major construction project across the street - but the building is going up fast and should be completed shortly.  The workers began at 7:30 am and we were up and around by then anyway - they stopped working at 3:30 pm or so.  Second, (b) the stand-alone air conditioning unit in the apartment was loud - but again, we left it on during the day and it worked fine by the time we retired for the night.

I would recommend this to others - a good value and a quality B&B.

Charlotte wasn't in town so I didn't get to meet her, but getting the key from her lockbox and finding the apartment could not have been easier. Overall the experience was like taking a room in a hotel, simple, low hassle, and generally pleasant. "
2660384,20590928,2014-10-01,9441594,Gil,"Charlotte was very accommodating and is a gracious host. The apartment was clean, well decorated, and spacious--complete with modern utilities. Exactly how it looks like in the picture.

It's also in a quiet and convenient area in downtown Seattle. Couldn't have picked a better place and would stay here again during my next visit. "
2660384,21013637,2014-10-09,21979619,Liz,"This host was very responsive and clear in communications. The unit is in a great location - 5 minutes from Pike Place market; right by a nice waterfront park with bike and running path; and tons of good restaurants within a few blocks. The unit is nice and was spotless when I checked in. The only downside is the traffic noise outside, but this is easily solved with some earplugs."
2660384,21172337,2014-10-12,22065507,Mary,"Very easy to find and get into. Great location! Walkable to many places and cheap cab rides everywhere we went, never more than $10. Spacious enough for two people. Overall, great stay."
2660384,21264043,2014-10-13,22224189,Timbo,"Bed was clean and comfortable.  Although, Netflix didn't have ""Begin  Again"" the movie, which we wanted to see desperately, not hosts fault at any means, but it was still fun.  All in all, if you have good company with you, there shouldn't be any problem."
2660384,21439720,2014-10-17,22131046,Jaime,"Charlotte was courteous, easy to work with, and helpful.  The apartment was conveniently located near Pike's Market.  A pretty spartan room, but for city visitors who want an easy in and easy out place for a night, this did the trick.  "

The location is great, within walking distance from the Space Needle (from where you can take the Monorail to downtown), and even to the Pike Public Market on a sunny day. The unit has everything you need, a cosy bed, TV with Netflix, wi-fi, instant coffee and tea bags, a kettle and a coffee filter, towels, air conditioning, fridge, stove, dishwasher. It's a bit noisy as it faces the street, but we had a good night's rest there anyway! The host was very helpful while we were in town, so feel free to contact her if you need to.
The neighbourhood is nice and has lots a quick small places to eat brunch, but also is within walking distance from some nice restaurants: Umi Sake and Mama's Mexican Kitchen. 
For a short stay in Seattle, this was a very good choice, both price- and location-wise."

2660384,24126215,2014-12-20,20132760,Ling Ting,Good place and near bar. So I very like it. 
2660384,24631203,2014-12-31,18492801,Ned,"Super great place, location, and host! Charlotte was right on top of everything and is a real pro AirBnBer... The apartment is exactly as described and is so convenient to all of downtown Seattle, Seattle Center, Belltown, and the waterfront. Clean, comfortable, well-appointed. Will stay again!"
2660384,24681316,2015-01-01,23398252,Vic,Perfect place to stay while in downtown Seattle. It was walking distance to the pike and to the Space Needle where we watched the New Year's Eve fireworks. Had everything that we needed for our stay. Thanks again Charlotte.
2660384,24903529,2015-01-03,24974881,Andreja,"Nice studio apartement, perfectly located for exploring Seattle by foot. Clean and very cosy for a couple or a single traveler. Smooth check in. We stayed for 2 nights and can recommend it!"
2660384,24987963,2015-01-04,25274395,Eileen,"The apartment was clean but rather depressing.  There is no table or desk.  Due to construction across the street and the windows fronting on Western Ave -- there was a great deal of noise beginning before 4:00 am as semi trucks came in and a large crane was installed -- impossible to sleep.  Given the level of the disruption, I believe that apartment owners would have been notified in advance -- I should have been warned."
2660384,25275798,2015-01-11,9832933,Brad,Wonderful place.  Convenient to the space needle and downtown.  Everything was neat and clean.  Road noise calms down at night and didn't cause any issues with sleeping.
2660384,25376233,2015-01-13,17690209,Brodie,Charlotte's place is in a great location in Belltown.  There are plenty of places within walking distance including Pike Place.  The check in/out is easy and the studio is exactly like the photos.  Charlotte's communication is very prompt and she helped us check in a little earlier. 
2660384,25761853,2015-01-25,16307600,Saagar,The location was amazing and the apartment was clean. Charlotte was a great host and very helpful. I would definitely stay here again!
2660384,26311910,2015-02-09,26006844,Kemplen,"This condo is in a great location and within walking distance of Belltown, Pikes Market and the Space Needle. The traffic is a little noisy, but all in all, a great place to stay in Seattle! "
2660384,26524355,2015-02-15,23458847,Lindsay,"Charlotte has someone who answers calls at all hours, so when we got there late at night, it was nice to have someone kind to talk to that knew how to get in.  The neighborhood was GREAT!  I would recommend it to others.  Cost wise, I think we could have found a hotel that was around the same quality, but then you lose the feel of being in that cute little neighborhood and live like the locals. "
2660384,26668852,2015-02-16,27795171,David,"The stay was easy and private. Simplicity at its best. My partner commented that it was almost like a hotel, rather than an Airbnb. Thank you, Charlotte, for making this so easy."
2660384,26931286,2015-02-22,12355035,Hope,"Charlotte's place in Seattle was wonderful! It was in a great location. It was walking distance to Pikes, the Space Needle and it had tons of cute restaurants and hip bars very close by. Charlotte's place was also very clean and comfortable. Overall we had an awesome experience staying here, and would definitely stay here again next time we are in town! The only thing I would mention is if you are a light sleeper, pack some ear plugs."
2660384,27151675,2015-02-26,4842511,Samuel,"Great place, simple to get in and get out. Parking can be a bit tricky but it ain't hard. Overall, it was a good space to relax and crash. Would stay again"
2660384,27644486,2015-03-09,25825100,Ann Loraine,"Charlotte's space is conveniently located in the middle of everything! The Space Needle, Pike Place, even the light rail station is in walking distance.

The space is very clean and just as pictured. I would stay here again the next time I travel to Seattle."
2660384,27803621,2015-03-12,27719873,Daniel,Great place to stay! Charlotte was more than accommodating and her instructions were spot on. I would definitely recommend this listing and would gladly stay here again.
2660384,27955510,2015-03-15,26083449,Mary,"The space was wonderful, it is in an excellent location that is very close to many attractions. The studio itself was clean and organized, no problems whatsoever during check-in or check-out. I would definitely recommend it to anyone who wishes to visit Downtown Seattle. Charlotte was timely in her responses and answered any questions that I had. "
2660384,28131160,2015-03-18,17421566,Linda,The studio was exactly as it is pictured. Was perfect for a few days in Seattle and in a great location. Walking distance to everything! Also very clean. Great stay - Id definitely go back! 
2660384,28212437,2015-03-20,8978107,Taylor,"The building (but not the room) smelt funky. 

The room definitely looks nicer in the pictures.

The neighborhood isn't the nicest. 

Picking up keys via lock-box was a bit sketchy. "
2660384,28359537,2015-03-22,23228277,Taylor,Charlotte was very easy to communicate with and had everything prepared and explained to me before I even arrived. The apartment was clean and had no problems arriving or checking out. Really enjoyed my stay and I would use this place again.
2660384,28587189,2015-03-26,29714670,Stephen,We had an excellent time staying here! Check in was very easy. Everything was the way it was described. Great location. Pike's place and downtown was all in walking distance. The room was very clean and had everything we needed. I would definitely book this room again.
2660384,28668677,2015-03-28,11740291,Brian,Listing was accurate. Nice place and in a nice part of town too. Everything went smoothly and we left satisfied.
2660384,28715437,2015-03-29,27623803,Jason,"Great little studio in Seattle.  We really liked the space and having a kitchen and small living space.  Was comfortable, clean and convenient if you're looking to spend time on 2nd Ave area in Belltown, or even Pike place and 1st Ave if you're ok with a short walk.  
"
2660384,28858488,2015-03-30,10872748,Brooke,"This place is what you'd expect from a downtown aparement and was as described. Charlotte was able to accomindate me on a last minute notice which was great. 
"
2660384,30150692,2015-04-18,18007332,Tien,"Charlotte's studio looked exactly like what was pictured and described in the listing. It was clean and the bed was comfortable. The essentials were provided, including an iron and blow dryer. The location was very close to downtown and nearby to Queen Anne, where we visited Kerry Park. Charlotte was able to accommodate an earlier check in time, which saved us from carrying our baggage around! I would definitely recommend this place and stay here again whenever I come back to Seattle! "
2660384,30206879,2015-04-19,1353152,Eliysha,"The place was beautiful and it was the perfect location in relation to Pike Place Market. The apartment was cozy and it came with a Roku that's set up with Netflix that makes it perfect for us to wind down after a long day of sightseeing. Overall, a wonderful place! :)"
2660384,30565068,2015-04-24,3017624,Tejal,"This place was perfect for my trip. Although it was a studio it was spacious enough for our things, the extra air mattress, and the sitting area without feeling crowded. There were thoughtful touches everywhere, like toiletries in the bathroom and lots of towels in the closet. The Roku was easy to use and we were able to watch a movie using our amazon prime subscription without any problem. The check in was very easy. I was having trouble with the key box at first but one phone call solved that easily. Check out was even easier. The building is quiet, we hardly saw any other people. The location is wonderful, walkable to lots of restaurants and shops, in addition to Pike's Market. The place was very clean, easy to find, and the bed was very comfortable! All in all it was a great stay and I would recommend it. "
2660384,31080364,2015-05-01,21213917,Denis,"Excellent apartment, very spacious and clean! A very comfortable bed, TV with Roku and Netflix - everything is exactly as stated or better! And what a location! Highly recommended, will stay here again for sure."
2660384,32166006,2015-05-15,20449144,Courtney,"This was a great little place to stay if you just need the basics. It's close to a lot of attractions, and there are plenty of bars and restaurants around. The bed is SUPER comfortable. The air conditioner was a little loud like others have noted, but it's a constant noise that didn't keep me awake at all. There's also not a microwave, which would have been nice for reheating leftovers, but that wasn't too big of a deal. I'd definitely stay here again!"
2660384,32426897,2015-05-17,33167638,Kyle,"My girlfriend and I stayed here for the weekend and absolutely loved it. The apartment was clean, comfortable and in a great location - close to bars, restaurants and attractions around downtown Seattle. There were extra sheets and towels readily available and a Roku with Netflix made it feel very homey. Charlotte was very prompt in reaching out after booking and her instructions/directions were simple to understand and we were able to get settled quickly. I highly recommend staying here and would love to stay here again next time I'm in town."
2660384,32685056,2015-05-20,2161443,Norman,"Perfect. Great Location, unit was exactly as described. Very clean and everything worked flawlessly. Charlotte was easy to communicate with and helpful. Will definitely book again when visiting Seattle. "
2660384,33072730,2015-05-25,25363804,Brooks,"We had a nice experience with Charlotte at the studio. The space is cozy, but works well for one or two people. The location was great because we were able to walk almost everywhere we wanted to go. Some road noise, but wasn't bad a night when there wasn't as much traffic. Would recommend this space to friends visiting Seattle and would stay again should our travels take us back."
2660384,33357868,2015-05-27,4609118,Sarah,Clean and central with a responsive host - everything we could have hoped for. 
2660384,33568151,2015-05-30,27389332,Megan,"My husband and I really enjoyed our stay at Charlotte's studio. The location is perfect, everything is within walking distance! We drove up from Oregon and parked our car in a garage that Charlotte recommended and paid $21 for 24 hours. We hardly saw anybody else that lived in the building, and it was very quiet. The studio is very bright and nicely decorated.  Definitely felt like 'home away from home.' We will definitely stay here again when we come to Seattle next. Thanks Charlotte!"
2660384,33741443,2015-05-31,516345,Alicia,"This was a great little apartment that worked great for my one night lay-over in Seattle. The location was really great, the apartment clean, and the instructions clear. "
2660384,34556353,2015-06-09,5259951,Bryan,"I had a great stay at Charlotte's listing, clean, easy to find and everything I needed was there. I'd stay there again in a heartbeat. Thanks so much Charlotte!"
2660384,34750685,2015-06-11,32749705,Kyle,"This listing is accurately described with an amazing location to access everything from public transportation, to see the sites, and even incredibly close to the water. The neighborhood was very ideal, not on a busy street, out of the way for privacy yet still available to the city of Seattle and all its glory. Her directions were simple and concise, didn't have any trouble entering or exiting, or checking-in or checking-late. Ideal listing with all the amenities you need to enjoy your stay. I would definitely recommend this to someone and hopefully in the future will be able to stay once more."
2660384,34961758,2015-06-14,31924391,Stephen,"Had a great stay in Seattle. The studio condo worked out great. Simple and close to everything we wanted to see. Many resturants, bars and coffee shops all around. Walking distance to just about everything especially pikes place. "
2660384,35230456,2015-06-16,15864919,Barat,"The apartment is very pleasant: nice size, lots of light, and very neat.  It is very convenient to Pike's market and the Sculpture Garden as well as to many restaurants and cafes. We had a very nice stay."
2660384,35911099,2015-06-23,22238891,Austin,"This was the perfect jumping off point for anyone visiting Seattle - whether for only a few nights or an extended stay. The condo was in a great part of the city, tons of great places to eat and check out within walking distance. I would definitely stay here again. "
2660384,36206808,2015-06-26,32933175,Adrienne,"Fantastic apartment & location! My husband & I had a lovely time exploring Seattle, it was very easy to walk to a lot of touristy places like Pike Place Market, but the apartment was nice & quiet. Food in the neighborhood was excellent.

The apartment was very easy to find, extremely clean and Charlotte was very helpful, especially accommodating our need for an earlier check in.  "
2660384,36353214,2015-06-27,36674998,Jesse,"This is the perfect spot if you just need a place to shower and sleep! Located right smack in the middle of all that is Seattle. Very clean, very cozy, very quiet. This place is walking distance to plenty of food spots and less than a $10 über ride from Space Needle, Pike's Market, and other notable places of interest. "
2660384,36455405,2015-06-28,31485355,Renee,Condo was large in size and very clean. Bed was comfortable. Having the A/C was a wonderful touch given the heat outside. Great restaurants around and walking distance from tons of things to do. Would definitely return!

2660384,37489741,2015-07-07,34390544,Maja,"I really loved staying at this downtown Seattle studio. We rented the car, but walked to most of the sights of interest like Space Needle and Pike Market. Tons of really good restaurants within walking distance.
The place was as described, neat and very clean. 
Arranging the stay at Charlotte's was very easy: her instructions on how to access the keys to her place without ever meeting her in person were precise and easy to follow.  
Overall, a very enjoyable stay, and would do it again."
2660384,38509809,2015-07-16,35139156,Michael,"This studio is very comfortable, and has all the furnishings you need for a great week out on the town. It's location is even better. Close to everything! My wife and I had a very good time in Seattle. The studio was certainly a big part of our experience."
2660384,38657683,2015-07-17,37917528,Travis,This was my first experience with Airbnb and it couldn't have gone any smoother. We were very pleased with the condo and the location.  I would highly recommend staying here if you are in Seattle for business or pleasure.  Thank you Charlotte. 
2660384,38967339,2015-07-19,38712355,Charles,"As advertised, Clean,Comfortable &Convenient.
Ideally this unit should be priced at $150 per night rather than the $200 they are asking.
I drove my own car and parking was a little challenging as with any big city(expected)
all in all it was a good experience. The AC was a plus, it would have been a real Bummer without as it was very hot outside. "
2660384,40627152,2015-08-01,4838657,Nick,"Exactly as described. Very clean, organized, and comfortable. Great location and very accessible to other parts of Belltown and Downtown Seattle."
2660384,41041396,2015-08-03,39881968,So-Yun,It was my first Airbnb experience and I was very satisfied.
2660384,41761285,2015-08-09,28032721,Ryan,"Great location walking distance to grocery, restaurants, cafes, waterfront. Building easy to get in/out, AC is perfect when it gets hot. Overnight parking nearby for about $20 a day."
2660384,42631912,2015-08-14,30222637,Scotland,Good location and a simple place to stay. It feels as if your in a scavenger hunt when reading how to access the key. Building is a bit older.
2660384,43141806,2015-08-17,40021606,Joe,The Studio was the perfect respite for us on our whirlwind weekend in Seattle. Everything was just as described and the location was perfect for us to walk everywhere we wanted to go. Charlotte was a pleasure to work with and quick to respond to our questions. 
2660384,43459576,2015-08-19,4266010,Bessma,Apartment was in a great location.  Apartment is exactly as described and is very comfortable. 
2660384,43683046,2015-08-21,29960484,Radha,"Charlotte was very helpful and responsive to messages. This was a good location, although it took some work to find the keys and get into the apartment when we got there. Older building and apartment, but nice bed and clean bathroom. A/C was very useful."
2660384,44065962,2015-08-23,41779836,Hu,"This BnB was spacious, no surprises and the location is good. It can get a little street noise but easily remedied by turning on the A/C. "

2660384,45111129,2015-08-31,9740737,Johanna,"The best aspect of this apartment is the location. The description was fairly accurate, although the apartment and the appliances were older than they looked in the pictures. Most importantly, the apartment was very clean, the bed was comfortable, and everything worked. Charlotte is responsive and easy to work with. You are walking distance from most things. Easy check in and check (website hidden) was a plus. We rented a car by the day so that we did not have to pay for parking.  Overall, we had a good experience at this apartment."
2660384,45509458,2015-09-03,7486619,Meagan,Great experience. Apartment is exactly as described/pictured. Location is perfect for exploring tourist attractions and great restaurants! Parking lot was $12 a day (10 hours & walking distance) and free street parking at night was easy to find. 
2660384,45711760,2015-09-05,38104414,Douglas,"It was clean and a great location. Easy access into the unit, and was like a very large hotel room. Definitely could use updating; the carpet, cabinets and appliances were all rather worn. That's not a major quibble as it was clean and neat and as represented. And the location would be hard to beat. Just up the street were exceptional restaurants, bars, shopping, and the like. Pike's Market was walking distance. The biggest drawback was parking. Any of the nearby garages were incredibly expensive. You can get away with parking on the street, however. It's 4 hours at a time, and from 6:00 p.m. to 8:00  a.m. it's free, so you can work it. I would rent it again without hesitation."
2660384,46516725,2015-09-11,36012623,Ryan,"Great experience. The apartment was exactly as pictured. Very clean with exceptionally comfortable bed. It was a warm night, and the air conditioning unit worked well. Kitchen well stocked. Thanks for the coffee in the fridge! Wonderful location 5 min walk from Pike Place Market. I would love to stay here again!"
2660384,46739006,2015-09-13,6931032,Matthew,"Exactly as advertised. Very clean. Very comfortable bed. Yes, a little dated as others have said, but would not hesitate to stay here again."
2660384,47090695,2015-09-15,2261461,Anne,"This condo was in the perfect location between Pike Place Market and the Space Needle, two blocks from the water.  The condo had a nice court yard.  "
2660384,47216950,2015-09-16,11880845,Lu,"The apartment was in a great location, walking distance between downtown, space needle, and the sculpture park. Charlotte's instructions were very clear and the house was spotless."
2660384,47770450,2015-09-21,3238129,Anthony,Great experience. The apartment was exactly as pictured. Very clean with exceptionally comfortable (website hidden) unit worked well. Kitchen well stocked. Thanks for the coffee in the fridge! Wonderful location And neighborhood. I rwcommend staying here

Having a kitchen was handy with all the basic necessities. Charlotte kindly provided an iron with board, hair dryer, and shower necessities. I would gladly stay here again! "
2660384,48457304,2015-09-26,35591586,Bryan,"Charlotte's place was clean, comfortable, and in a great location. We were in town for a short weekend trip and the studio met all of our needs. If you're from out of town and coming from the airport, no worries. We used the light rail to the University Street station and then requested an Uber for the last mile or so to Charlotte's place. Would recommend to anyone wanting to explore Seattle as its downtown location near all of the sights is tough to beat."
2660384,49269493,2015-10-02,43106846,Stephen,We waited to review because we had 3 other Air BNB's. This one was by far our favorite. The location was perfect. The apartment was clean and all amenities worked.
2660384,49612559,2015-10-05,40384279,Eric,I loved the location of this apartment and check in/check out was super easy. I highly recommend this place if you're looking to spend time downtown or at Pike Place. 
2660384,50000083,2015-10-08,5442483,Stephanie,"It is a very nice place. Very secure and a great location.  Apartment was clean and comfortable.  It is on a main road, so if you are a light sleeper (like me) I suggest bringing some earplugs for a sound night sleep.  I would recommend this apartment to my friends."
2660384,50093344,2015-10-09,43130966,Erica,"The location was easy to find and a very convenient walk downhill to the Clipper ferry which was our main reason for selecting a place to stay in this particular area.  Older building but has had a lot of upgrades.  Room was made available a little earlier than usual to store our luggage which was a bonus in terms of customer service.  Unit had a small portable AC unit which was nice in the afternoon when it was just a little warm and humid.  Very good coffee shop just a block away.  Nice place, would stay there again."
2660384,50442023,2015-10-12,39080488,Haley,"Would recommend this place to anyone! Easy to check in/ out, great location close to pikes place market, and nice accommodations. Charlotte was quick to answer any questions I had. "
2660384,51364526,2015-10-19,45866794,Kalea,This was a great place to stay for the weekend. It was very clean and well kept. The location was awesome - walking distance to Pike's Place market and most of downtown. Getting the key and into the building worked perfectly. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone staying in downtown Seattle. 
2660384,51701896,2015-10-24,13168434,Pam,"Apartment was as advertised, good location.
Very neat and clean. Access easy with key safe lock. Local information would have been appreciated as would a microwave.
A very positive experience."
2660384,51787304,2015-10-24,21450984,Nicole,Charlotte gave very great directions about how to get into the place. It was very clean and had everything we needed!  
2660384,52526585,2015-10-30,45674237,Khalid,Great little studio apartment within a few minutes walk of the Bell Harbor conference center. Room was as described and the entire experience exceeded my expectations. Highly recommended.
2660384,53366600,2015-11-08,42258520,Jose,This was a great place to stay. Very secure and a great location. Apartment was clean and comfortable. I recommend this place to anyone staying in downtown Seattle.
2660384,53799505,2015-11-12,48617394,Jim,What a pleasant stay I had in this Studio. It was very well located to all sorts of great spots. The rooms were very clean and tidy. The hosts were very accommodating. I hope to go back when visiting Seattle.
2660384,53965259,2015-11-15,12586360,Kim,The check in process was extremely detailed and well organized! Charlotte responded very quickly whenever I asked a question and was incredibly helpful. The location of this unit was close to everything and we just walked everywhere. I would most definitely stay here again!
2660384,54920058,2015-11-25,2675385,Blake,The directions were clear and concise.  The location was great.  There are not a lot of cooking utensils or glass/stemware.  The place was a great value for the cost.
2660384,57332004,2015-12-24,19417225,Jerry,"Charlotte gave the detailed instruction, also provide some advice on fun stuff nearby, which are really helpful, especially it was my first time visiting Seattle.

The place is kind of matching the description, but it is little bit off from the pics. It is at a great location, really really close to most of the fun stuff in Seattle. It is also clean and spacious, should work well for 2 or 3 guests. 

However, the place is too close to the main street, which yields lot of noise during the night and morning. The sound proof is not great either, I can clearly hear the conversation from the neighbors during the night. So for all light sleepers, please be aware."
2660384,58171480,2016-01-01,31316861,Tanar,"Easy to find and easy to get to, we hit a snag when the front door wouldn't unlock. Luckily, the housekeeper was walking by and between him and a call to Michael, we managed to get the door unstuck. Michael was very apologetic about the door and hopefully, by the time you read this, he's gotten it fixed like he hoped.

Inside the apartment looked exactly like the photos although less white and more beige. It's spacious, quiet, and warm. The bed is probably the most comfortable bed I've ever slept on in my life. Slept like a rock. 

It was a very cold night so we Uber'd to the Space Needle but walked back. In the morning, we walked to The Market as well. Everything's close and easy to get to. 

We never got to meet Blake Lively though. Ah well."
2392869,10524322,2014-02-23,12329945,Charlie,"Great apartment in a great location!  Foodies would especially enjoy this property because it is so close to Pike Place Market and has a nice kitchen.  The logistics could not have been easier, thanks to the great hosts.  

Apartment was clean and neat. Pretty quiet too, especially for such a central location."
2392869,10697877,2014-03-03,12325319,Ron,"Miranda and Michael were great hosts. The apartment was as I imagined based on the photos and very convenient to both the Washington State Convention Center and to Pike Place Market. Check in and check out was easy. Miranda and Michael were responsive to a problem I had with Wi-Fi and helped me fix it in short order. The fifth floor apartment is accessible by elevator and has a front view out to Elliot Bay and West Seattle over the top of buildings across the street. Back bedroom is away from traffic on 1st Ave., and surprisingly quiet for a downtown location. Good responsive communication with the owners was a real plus. Thank you Michael and Miranda."
2392869,11055018,2014-03-18,1751013,Ammu,"Miranda was a very gracious host and the apartment was just perfect for our short visit to Seattle.  The apartment is just as you see in the pictures.  It was spacious, clean and had a great view.  It was also walking distance to many key Seattle attractions (Pike's Place, Space Needle) and tons of restaurants and bars!

Our flight got in super late (and delayed) and Miranda was completely patient with us and waited to let us in on a Friday night.  Our return flight was not until the evening and she let us check out late.  Such accommodations just made the trip so much better and we are completely grateful to Miranda for being a lovely host!"
2392869,11246347,2014-03-26,10650241,Pamela,"I had a wonderful stay in this one bedroom apartment.  Everything was clean and the hosts were very welcoming, willing to accommodate my very late arrival.  The kitchen was well appointed, and the apartment had everything one would need.  The neighborhood was the best part - there was a lovely view of the water, and it was only a short (less than five minute) walk to Pike Place and to the waterfront path.

Would highly recommend this apartment to anyone, and definitely would stay again."
2392869,11356863,2014-03-31,3418700,Matthew,Everything went smoothly with Miranda and the apartment. A great place centrally located near Pike Market. The place was fantastic perfect for our needs great view too. We met at the appointed time received a tour of the place and a complimentary bottle of champaign (sadly I can't drink it but the thought was there) comply bed and awesome shower. Made the trip so much smoother. If you need a place to stay on work or vacation these are your people to see. Thank Miranda and Michael for the great experience. 
2392869,11539603,2014-04-07,12359427,Veronica,This is a great apartment and very conveniently located right next to the market. Miranda was extremely helpful and welcoming and ensured we had everything we needed for our stay. I would certainly recommend stating here.
2392869,11919703,2014-04-19,10703132,Gloria,"We had a terrific stay.  Michael and Miranda were extremely considerate hosts, very responsive, and it was a wonderful, comfortable apartment. The location couldn't be better.  We were just minutes (walking) from the Pike Place Market, the Seattle Art Museum, and the Seattle Aquarium (there is also a Target a few minutes away, which was very convenient for sundries). It was a very short walk to the monorail and then a short hop to Seattle Center, with the Space Needle, Chihuly exhibition, etc.  It is also a short walk to the beginning of the Duck amphibious tour and to the Argosy Cruise tour--we just didn't have time too take them. But we plan on coming back when we can and staying in the same apartment. There were great restaurants within walking distance, but we also enjoyed being able to just stay in and eat in the apartment a couple of nights after especially long days, one of the perks of renting an apartment and not a hotel. And you really could not ask for better hosts. "
2392869,12370628,2014-04-30,1882296,Rebecca,"This is such a terrific downtown site.  The view across the bay, watch the ferries come and go,  the access to all downtown sites and buses to nearby groovy suburbs or ferries, all so easy from here. Eat out, or buy excellent fresh food from the pike place market across the road. Wow, for simple fresh food lovers.
Great lounge room, sunny with views, nice fixtures. Position perfect."
2392869,13502018,2014-05-29,11709074,Megan,"My boyfriend and I just went for a short trip to Seattle, about 4 days.  Overall, we enjoyed the stay.  The place looked just like the pictures.  It was a wonderful location.  We were able to walk nearly everywhere.  The place was very cute and well-maintained.  Unfortunately, we were without hot water for a shower, but this is in the process of getting fixed by maintenance.  There was no toilet paper when we arrived, so we had to go to the store, but otherwise, everything was great.  Miranda greeted us there and checked in on us during our stay, which was nice.  Overall, a good experience!"
2392869,13666840,2014-06-02,9270678,Carla,"Location, location, location! 

Miranda was there to meet us on time, easy to communicate with, and responded quickly to requests like extra toilet paper and towels. The apartment easily accommodated 2 people, 3-4 would be a squeeze.  Within a 2 minute walk of Pikes Market, the waterfront and endless GREAT dining.  Less than 15 minutes to the Space Needle and the Art Museum, and a quick cab ride to SafeCo and Century Link Fields. Downsides: Parking - expensive ($40-$60/day) and when and where you could park had lots of time restrictions. Shower- no hot water for the entire 4 days. Street noise - if you are a light sleeper or not used to city noise in general, the noise level at night is high, especially with windows open on weekends. Overall, this is an excellent ""foodie"" and shopping location, with great nightlife and plenty of sensory adventures. "
2392869,13948363,2014-06-09,6556569,Susan,"Love this location!! It really could not be easier to get here. This great apartment is right in the heart of downtown - all the options for seeing the sites. We walked everywhere from here. Plenty of great restaurants in the area, as well as famed Pike's Market. 
The apartment is on the 5th floor with plenty of room for 2. We did not use the kitchen, but there is a full stove and refrigerator. 
Although we did not get to meet our hosts, Miranda was easily accessible by text. It was easy arrival and departure. 
Love this spot! 
"
2392869,14184349,2014-06-14,13937335,Mike,"We had a lovely time staying in Michael & Miranda's cozy apartment. The place is truly in the perfect spot for a seattle visit. You are just steps away from Pikes Place Market and dozens of fun bars / restaurants. The apartment was clean and stocked with things like: TP, paper towels, shampoo & conditioner, towels, dishes, pots & pans, dish soap, hand soap. Remember your bath soap from home, understandably it was not provided. Miranda did an outstanding job staying in contact with me and was extremely quick with all replays to my questions. Bobby, who let us into the apartment was quite affable and had an contagious smile! Like previous reviews have stated the noise level at night is a bit bothersome when the windows are open but nothing more than average city noise. Overall great place at a very fair price. Thank you Miranda. "
2392869,15395438,2014-07-08,1218173,Dave,The apartment was nice. Cable TV would have been nice. We had to leave the windows open since it was so hot out and it turns out the neighbors were really loud - blasting the TV all night and having loud conversations till the early morning. Shower was really small.  
2392869,15617677,2014-07-13,11194936,Krysten,"We stayed in Mike and Miranda's place in July, and we loved it! The location was great for walking to Pike Place Market, as well as a lot of great restaurants and cafes and public transit. The apartment was clean and just as pictured. Unfortunately, Seattle was in a bit of a heat wave when we were there, so the apartment was rather warm. We picked up a fan, which we left in the apartment and were reimbursed for, and that made it very comfortable. If you're bringing a car, plan on paying a hefty amount for parking right by the apartment, but if you're willing to walk a little, we found that the Pike Place Market garage was the most reasonable price in the area, with a short walk back to the apartment. If you're heading to Seattle and looking for a place in the middle of everything, I'd highly recommend this apartment!"
2392869,15818643,2014-07-16,2573705,Lysa,"We had the best time at the Cozy Apartment.  It's the perfect size for two people.  Their host, Bobby, was responsive and waiting for us the minute we got there. He was kind enough to provide a fan on an unusually warm spell in Seattle.  

The neighborhood is great, you could not ask for more as a tourist. It's right across from Pike Market and there is every amenity in the neighborhood. Great breakfast spots included Bacco Cafe and the Biscuit B**ch (awning says Cafe Lietto). 

The wireless worked great. There's no cable TV (which is fine since you're supposed to be on vacation) so load up the Netflix and the HBO GO if you want TV. 

Thanks for the great vacation. "
2392869,15947774,2014-07-19,9853829,Judy,Great location - close to everything - apartment in a nice building and cute and attractive. Miranda and Mike were available and helpful.
2392869,16077197,2014-07-22,13864744,Frank,"Great place, really convenient location, and everything went smoothly. Would recommend!"
2392869,16336895,2014-07-26,12733698,Patty,"Location, location, location! This rental is in the perfect location. Our hosts left bottles of water and plenty of city maps for us. The apartment was great, AND a view of the water. This great rental is two blocks from Pike Place (the famous fish market), and tons of eateries. You can even walk to the ferries for a $7.50 round trip ride to the surrounding islands. We loved our stay here."
2392869,16784402,2014-08-02,4099223,Jason,"The apartment was clean, bright, and as many others have said, in a great location. It's close to many good restaurants and bars and doesn't feel unsafe at night. It's also five minutes away from the transit tunnel so it's easy to get to and from the airport and other major bus lines. There are a lot of buses on Third Ave as well, three minutes away.

I left all of the windows open at night and didn't find it loud at all — just the general city din. The bedroom is directly adjacent to the elevator shaft so you hear some gentle mechanical whirring but it's fine for all but the lightest sleepers. The elevator is generally quiet between 11pm and 7am.

I never met Miranda and Mike personally, but Miranda was incredibly responsive and I had no doubts that if anything had come up she would've been able to resolve them quickly."
2392869,17332479,2014-08-11,2929408,Sarah,"This apartment is in an awesome location. Close to great restaurants, shops, transport links etc. 
the apartment was clean with a very comfy bed although a couple more pillows would've been handy. The shower is pretty small with not the best pressure. I reccomend the hair dresser around the corner if your a woman with long thick hair. Saying that it was very clean with nice thick towels. 
The kitchen is pretty well equipped although a toaster and a microwave wouldn't go astray. 
We had a problem with the window and mike was straight on it and it was fixed within a couple of days. 
All up if it's a great location your after this is the place to stay. "
2392869,17610406,2014-08-15,13423369,Gary,Great apartment in a fabulous location.  Within walking distance of numerous restaurants and of course Pikes Market is just around the corner .  Check in was smooth and easy and the apartment was very neat and clean.  Overall a great experience in Seattle. 
2392869,17928875,2014-08-19,8238915,Amy,Great location for visiting Seattle!  Steps away from tons of restaurants and shops.  
2392869,18237216,2014-08-24,16327962,Michael,"This very cozy 1 bedroom is in the perfect location for downtown activities and easily accessible to bus lines. With great views of the bay, this apartment is perfect to acclimate yourself with everything Seattle has to offer. "
2392869,18561847,2014-08-28,19000732,Mark,"Mike and Miranda's place was an awesome experience for our first trip to Seattle. The location was exactly as we had hoped for and the description was spot on. No AC but that's typical for Seattle. Weather was good while we were there. Nice view of the water from the front window.
Miranda's friend Bobby met us upon arrival and gave us the keys...no problem. We arrived via train from LA and our arrival time was uncertain but as I said, no problems. 
This is not luxury; but we had a very good time and would recommend this accommodation for our friends if they were traveling to Seattle. It was a very good value compared to other nearby hotels in the area."
2392869,18724074,2014-08-31,1742350,Janette,Our hosts touched base with us and kept us informed of how to enter their apt.  They even checked in with us during the stay to help with any questions or needs.  Very nice hosts. 
2392869,19025192,2014-09-05,16021719,Michael,"Location, Location, Location! Miranda's apartment is literally steps from Pike's Place Market in the heart of town.  The apartment was a perfect size and very comfortable for our stay.  Miranda was very accommodating with our change in schedule and followed up with us several times to make sure our stay was perfect.  If you are heading to Seattle, do yourself a favor and stay here! "
2392869,19275262,2014-09-09,5921291,Matt,"Great location, host was responsive on a few missing items. Nice place, as advertised."
2392869,20001504,2014-09-22,11309407,Elizabeth,"This apartment is in a perfect location, within walking distance of Pike Place market, the space needle, downtown, and tons of great restaurants.   It is perfect for two people, nicely furnished and well cared for.  Miranda is a pleasure to work with, welcoming, helpful and very responsive."
2392869,20191489,2014-09-25,19943494,Ryan,"Great location, great apartment and great host. Would highly recommend."
2392869,20887184,2014-10-06,15687336,Lisa,"This location is amazing with the best views!   When we go there, we were welcomed with a bottle of sparking wine and chocolates.  Miranda and Mike  reply very quickly to questions and are really nice.  Great value received for the $ spent.  "
2392869,21018874,2014-10-09,10213811,William,"Great spot - apartment was comfortable, neighborhood was cool and convenient, and the hosts were helpful without being invasive. I'd stay here again!"
2392869,21319880,2014-10-14,22209326,Elizabeth,"Miranda is extremely helpful, available 24/7, prompt and super friendly. Can't beat the location! I would definitely stay here again. "
2392869,21447384,2014-10-17,22389409,Sameera,Miranda was super welcoming and really responsive about everything and available 24/7. Miranda and Mike are amazing hosts and I would recommend anyone to work with them! They have a very high integrity level and even left yummy chocolates and sparkling wine for us! 
2392869,21614910,2014-10-20,1607743,New,"Miranda's apartment is spacious and has an incredible view of Puget Sound and the Pike Place Market. Also a super convenient location for walking to great restaurants, parks, and the light rail station downtown. "
2392869,21841372,2014-10-25,1440756,Eric,"Truly a perfect space and location for experiencing all that Seattle has to offer... Thanks, Miranda, for being a great hostess."
2392869,22217389,2014-11-01,13350951,Cindy,"The apartment is absolutely beautiful! The view is incredible you can overview the market from the living room and the bedroom. Everything was very cleaned and organized and the apartment is perfectly located right in the middle of downtown surrounded by restaurants, shopping mall and great bars (not to mention the market right there). Miranda was very helpful and she made sure my experience went smoothly!  Will definitely consider staying here again."
2392869,22496217,2014-11-08,11071512,Allen,Great!  Couldn't be nicer and Miranda was wonderful.
2392869,22865017,2014-11-16,2958883,Carina,"Miranda met me at the apartment when I got in around 9:30 pm, nice touch to have a personal welcome. She checked in with me during my stay to make sure I had everything I needed. She also made sure I had a fan that I had requested before my arrival. The apartment was cozy and very well located right around the corner from Pike Place Market. I'm a fairly light sleeper, easily disturbed by noise, and I had no trouble on that account. "
2392869,23233493,2014-11-25,20472595,Casandra,"The unit is amazing. Great view, great decor, great hospitable host. You could not ask for a better location. If you are coming to Seattle this is the place to stay. "
2392869,23510416,2014-12-02,8871685,Claire,I had driven many hours to get to seattle and upon arrival was greeted by the very warm Miranda who helped me settle in.  The place itself was amazing the view was incredible and it's so close to everything you're going to want to do.  If you find yourself in seattle for a week I suggest you check out this incredible room with a view.
2392869,23753329,2014-12-09,869195,Charlie,We absolutely loved this place! Great location and the apartment did not disappoint. It was just like the photos. Plus Miranda was a great host and even went out of her way to send us a list of recommendations on places to see and restaurants to dine. We loved Seattle and if we visit again we will certainly come back! 
2392869,24029056,2014-12-17,238234,Shauna,"Miranda and Mike's apartment was perfect for our weeklong stay! The location simply cannot be beat - one block to Pike's Place, Seattle Coffee Works, The Crumpet Shop, etc. The apartment was clean, comfortable and nicely appointed. And the view! To top it off, Miranda was a thoughtful and attentive host. I'd stay again in a heartbeat. "
2392869,24215024,2014-12-22,23633061,Anna,"Miranda was fantastic! The view was spectacular! The apartment was conveniently central to everything, safe, clean and comfortable. 
Miranda checked in a few times to make sure all was great and it was, she was also very generous with a delicious bottle of chanpagne as a housewarming gift. I will definitely stay there again. "
2392869,24466586,2014-12-29,1389558,Eric,"One of the best Airbnb experiences I have ever had! Miranda and Mike were super accommodative throughout our whole stay. They were available with recommendations and follow up texts everyday. The place itself was a gem in the best location right next to Pike Place Market, which my girlfriend and I walked to every morning for breakfast and lunch. Would positively recommend this place along with Miranda and Mike any day! Thank you guys so much for a wonderful stay and experience!"
2392869,25081485,2015-01-06,22412033,Shari,"A comfortable 1 bedroom unit with a spectacular view of the bay, ideal location for walking to downtown Seattle's attractions, close proximity  to the running/biking trail along the waterfront, and an easy bus ride to Amtrak's King Street Station.  Would highly recommend this unit; a perfect Seattle get-away.  "
2392869,25279296,2015-01-11,1332398,Girish,"Miranda was a great host. She met up with us the day off to hand us the keys, gave us a tour and explained how the building worked. The place itself has an amazing view and it's very central. A few of my favorite restaurants and cafe's are just downstairs or around the corner. The apartment is in a dated building, but we didn't hear the other neighbors except the occasional door being slammed. The one thing that caught us off guard was that there wasn't a microwave in the kitchen (there is an oven and stove). Just heating up quick things was a bit tedious since we had to heat up leftovers in a pot or pan. The bed is comfortable, the heating throughout the apartment was great and the internet was fast. The bathroom looks and feels dated, but the cleaners cleaned it well and it wasn't a problem for us. Even being downtown, there is no street noise while the windows are closed, you'll hear some ferry horns, but that's it. The view is unbeatable!"
2392869,25396445,2015-01-14,8049320,Dixi,"The apartment is in a great location and the view is postcard perfect.  Everything was very neat and clean.  For guests traveling by car, parking on the street is a major problem and the nearby lots are expensive.   There is no microwave if you are planning to heat some leftovers.   "
2392869,25501196,2015-01-18,6285722,Katie,"Our stay in Seattle was amazing. Miranda met us as soon as we arrived and made sure we had everything we needed. The place was absolutely adorable and clean, with an epic view of Pike Place Market. The apartment is in a prime location and we had no trouble finding our way around. We will definitely be back again. Thank you so much!"
2392869,25805926,2015-01-26,24203542,Chris,"Our stay at Miranda and Mikes was Awesome!  They were both very helpful and accommodating and replied promptly to our questions and concerns.  They also provided a seamless check in.  The apartment is amazing, especially the view overlooking the market into the harbour.  Attractions, restaurants, and night life are all within walking distance.  I would not hesitate to stay there again on my future travels to Seattle.  "
2392869,25929855,2015-01-30,23655758,Mike Or Linda,"First and foremost Mike and Miranda were great hosts.  A day or two prior to our trip we hadn't heard form them regarding protocol for check in but all was solved with minimal issues.  Even though they could not make it, they sent their agent and right hand man Wally to take care of things regarding check in. Our travel plans changed at the last minute and we ended up arriving much earlier than we had anticipated, Mike and Miranda made sure we could get in early with no delays.  Nice job guys thanks.  Wally was great and filled us in on all we needed to know.  Wally and Mike touched base with us at times to make sure all was well.  We felt very welcome, the proseco and chocolates were a wonderful touch!  We found the apartment pretty much in line with what we had read but it is showing its age a bit.  The location thoroughly rocks being just a block off of Pike Market and so many great places nearby.   The view was PRICELESS!  Down sides: we had hoped for more utensils and equipment to do some cooking with since we were so close to the market.  They have it minimally stocked in this regard.  Mike and Miranda have the bath up to speed re: hairdryer, towels, shampoo and conditioner but we found ourselves short of soap. A quick trip to the very close City Target solved the problem. Overall we enjoyed our stay and loved getting to know Seattle better."
2392869,26152053,2015-02-05,10843841,Markku,"Miranda and Mike communicated everything very well, politely and timely both before, and during the stay. All arrangements for checkin and check out were handled very smoothly and well. 
The unit is at an outstanding location at Pike Place market, with one of the best views in Seattle. There's lots of natural light from the windows, and the unit was very pleasant to stay in, in good condition. There are lots of great cafes and shop right downstairs and in the adjacent blocks."
2392869,26402523,2015-02-11,999689,Eric,"We had a great stay - didn't need the hosts but they were super responsive and accomodating with our late check in. Thanks!

Eric"
2392869,26677319,2015-02-17,24882422,Wallace,Miranda was an amazing host! The listing was just as described. You can't beat the location and views. Furnishings made it felt just like home! Communication was speedy and thoughtful. 
2392869,26829628,2015-02-20,22803786,Shi,very good！so nice. I uses the Airbnb at first time. Thanks the gift！
2392869,27204499,2015-02-28,9989223,Krystal,"We had a wonderful stay! The hosts were great and promptly replied to all emails and texts. The apartment was easy to find, exactly as pictured, clean and conveniently located downtown.  Perfect for a couple, comfortable bed and linens.  The kitchen is petite but plenty of space to work. If you do plan to cook, bring a pan/ cookware as it is limited. Being steps away from Pikes Market and all of its beautiful produce I am glad we brought our own cookware.  I can't say enough good things about this place and we look forward to returning!"
2392869,27877859,2015-03-14,21446237,Bow,"The unit is perfect. The location,the style,the bed,the kitchen,the view...everything is wonderful! Eve is a nice host, she answered all my questions and wrote a postcard to welcome us. The red wine that Eve gave us was very nice,too. We will remember this perfect experience in Eve's unit, we will be back soon!"
2392869,28469139,2015-03-24,6216914,Robert,"The description and photos accurately portray this small, but perfectly comfy apt for 1-2, just steps away from the Pike Place Market, with a great view of Elliott Bay. This downtown neighborhood is a mix of hi- and lower-end establishments, and though on the 5th (top) floor, the apt is within ear-shot of the busy streetlife, bar-scene, and adjacent highway.  (Though much noiser than we are accustomed to, we did not find this overly intrusive.) It's also just blocks away from the light rail, Seattle Art Museum and multiple music venues. We would happily return on future visits.

Though Eve was not the original contact person who booked our 1-wk stay, from the time she contacted us (a week in advance), she was consistently helpful and responsive to all questions and/or concerns. She met us when we arrived, and promptly thereafter addressed several minor issues we identified during the first day or 2; e.g., our hosts promptly replaced a living room lamp that could only be turned on/off by reaching behind (i.e., moving) the couch, and provided a toaster, dish rack, and needed battery for the only clock. (We also suggested a radio and a plunger, which we understand were sinec added.) 

Finding both wine and coffee provided was much appreciated, as were Eve's super-speedy responses to any/all our text messages, and her suggestions concerning nearby eateries--incl. Cafe le Campagne, which we and our local friends enjoyed.

2392869,28651401,2015-03-28,26428239,Kelsey,Eve was extremely attentive and communicative which made our trip much more smooth. She answered all our questions in a timely manner and was there to give us the keys. The unit and the view are beautiful and within walking distance to the market and other attractions. We loved our stay and can't wait to get back to visit Seattle again!
2392869,28888217,2015-03-31,12486483,Davida,Great location. Right at Pike's Place Market. Great view. Nice place. Easy communication. Easy in/out. 
2392869,29220065,2015-04-05,1160919,Eran,"The stay in the apartment way exceeded my expectations! I have stayed in Seattle many times before, however this place was by far the best. First the location is superb! One step from Pike Market! 
The apartment was exactly as described. Pictures are exact and accurate. Cozy, great and the attention to details was above and beyond. Last but not least - Eve had made sure that the stay and the experience is nothing other then 5 stars!"
2392869,29688926,2015-04-11,5453897,Gavin,The apartment was very well presented and comfortable. We really enjoyed our stay and loved the location which is perfectly placed to enjoy everything Seattle has to offer. Eve was a great host and we highly recommend staying here when you visit Seattle - we will definitely stay here again when we visit Seattle next. 
2392869,29971159,2015-04-15,21575651,Thomas,"Eve was very forthcoming with great customer service and local advice. It was nice to have the private bedroom so I could linger in the living room area.  The location can't be beat;  Our first night dinner was at the Pink door behind the building and breakfast was literally next to the front door at B****** Biscuits.  Everything we wanted to see and do was within a short walk, including the monorail to the EMP and the Light rail from/to the airport.  And of course the view is distracting."
2392869,30090355,2015-04-17,5887546,Perry,"Eve was a fantastic host, I arrived at the apartment earlier than I expected to yet she kindly went out of her way to meet me and let me in which was sincerely appreciated! Eve was always easily reachable to answer any inquiries & extremely helpful with laying out so many different services one could use in the city, often providing you with a starting credit of some amount to be used which was very cool. 

The view and location of the apartment make it a must stay for me the next time I return to Seattle. Being so close to many great restaurants, activities and landmarks made this my happiest Airbnb experience yet! Thanks again Eve!!  "
2392869,30671461,2015-04-26,27756183,Jackie,Eve was a great host. She was able to accommodate our early arrival and was very hospitable. She made herself readily available should anything come up (which it didn't). The location and view can't be beat!
2392869,30904134,2015-04-28,29322320,Pablo,"Eve is great!
Appartment is in a perfect location
We had a great time"
2392869,31341826,2015-05-04,3129651,Michael,"Had great contact with Eve and she went out of her way to accommodate our early arrival time. Great place, great view, great location."
2392869,31638940,2015-05-08,23229964,Arlene,"The place was everything described.  Eve gave us options for us to travel from the airport to the place, within one block of pikes place>
we opted for the light rail, easy ride, low cost.  we stayed at the place for the entire 3 days as we had a unbelievable view of everything worthy to see.  
I walked from pike place to the flagship REI, a bonus for a die-hard long time members.  Ate breakfast in town, walk around, explored and returned to pike place many times during the day.  
I recommend happy hour at Chan's...and happy hour at Robertos.  all walking distance.  
Eve was attentive to all our needs and we thoroughly enjoyed the airbnb unit.  
We would recommend this place.  We are looking forward to enjoying a visit to seattle, and most likely will stay at the same place.  Unbelievable view, good food, walking to everything, including a target.  
I would suggest a small microwave so that I can easily heat up Beechers macaroni and cheese for my mid-night snack.  
thank you  a "
2392869,31836472,2015-05-10,3696119,Kyle,"Eve was an excellent host! She was very welcoming and was very flexible with the check in/out times. We had a strange time frame we were working around and had asked Eve if we could check in and check out at strange times. Eve had no problem with our requests. She also left us a bottle of wine which was very nice of her.

The apartment is in a prime location for anyone that is visiting Seattle for the first time. The Pike Place Market is right down stairs along with some of Seattle's most popular restaurants such as Biscuit Bitch and The Pink Door. The apartment was very clean and the view was spectacular. The view alone was enough for us to rent Eve's apartment again in the future.

5 star experience."
2392869,32738406,2015-05-21,519940,Jeff,"I stayed here for a 10 day vacation in May 2015 and had a great time, the views out of the window are amazing. The apartment is yards away from Pike Market and in the perfect location to access all that downtown Seattle has to offer. Eve's apartment has all the amenities needed for an independent stay and there are numerous café's, bars and restaurants right on the doorstep if you want to eat out. Eve was really nice and friendly and always available if I needed anything. In summary, I would definitely recommend a stay at Eve's apartment and would stay there again in a heartbeat."
2392869,33082806,2015-05-25,19074776,Kelsey,Eve was pleasant and communicated well with me as soon as I booked the Apartment in Seattle. She responded to every question very promptly. She arrived on time to meet me the day of my arrival and offered some great tips on where to do and places to see. The apartment was clean and had the most amazing view of Seattle's market place. I couldnt have been happier. 
2392869,33779707,2015-06-01,29018499,Stephen,"Eve was a wonderful host, responding promptly to all our messages and ensuring a seamless check-in process.  She greeted us in person (with some lovely welcome gifts) and showed us around the apartment in a courteous, warm and friendly way.

The apartment was exactly as described and pictured. It was very comfortable and well-equipped, with amazing views of Puget Sound, the Great Wheel and Pike Place Market (which was just around the corner - very convenient!)  Everything else, including the Link Light Rail station from the airport, was within walking distance.

We'd recommend Eve & Michael's place to any visitors without hesitation."
2392869,34414471,2015-06-08,1696554,Wanda,"We had a terrific stay at Eve and Michael's.  The apartment is in a perfect location with a fantastic view of Pike's Market, the ferris wheel, and water.  It is clean, comfortable, and a great place to relax after exploring the city.

Eve was very helpful before and throughout our stay.  She was very accommodating when we requested a late check out. Thank you, Eve!

We would highly recommend staying at Eve and Michael's."
2392869,34777168,2015-06-12,11394572,Jennifer,"Eve was an excellent host! She was prompt and courteous. The apartment was perfect for two travelers. The location was within walking distance to a wealth of attractions, shops, and restaurants. Overall, we'd chose to stay here again."
2392869,35204763,2015-06-16,18086621,Justin,"My wife and I LOVED this apartment!

Eve's apartment is perfect in every respect. Probably the best location in town with an absolutely amazing view of Puget Sound and Pike's Market. 

Apartment is really nice and Eve was very responsive to any needs. I have no doubt if we are ever back in Seattle, we will be staying at Eve's apartment again!"
2392869,35545838,2015-06-20,29890919,Marcia,"This was our first experience with Airbnb and my husband and I were a little apprehensive as we flew into Seattle.  However, we easily made our way into downtown Seattle via the rail transit train ($3 per person one way) and we found ourselves only about three blocks from the apartment!  Eve kept in contact with me in the days leading up to our visit and was very helpful with any questions we asked.  We set up a time to meet up at the apartment and Eve was there waiting for us.  The description on Airbnb of the apartment was accurate and the view from the windows overlooking Pike Place Market and the water was amazing!  We were in a great location and had no issues getting around the city from our place.  I would definitely recommend this place as a clean, convenient, well located apartment, especially if you are going to spend the majority of your time in the city.  We did not have a rental car, but if we did, it may have been difficult to find parking for it in the downtown area.  Eve & Michael were great hosts and after this great experience, we are looking forward to our next Airbnb stay! I would definitely recommend!"
2392869,35914709,2015-06-23,85813,Michelle,"This air bnb has a view more amazing than in the pictures and was in a spectacular location for getting around the city. The bed was very comfortable, laundry was convenient, and there was more space than I thought there would be in this prime real estate. Eve responded promptly and was courteous and reasonable. All in all a great experience and well worth a visit!"
2392869,36374576,2015-06-28,16108536,Henry,Loved staying here! Fantastic location and very nice apartment. 
2392869,36860474,2015-07-02,6383411,Nik,"Eve has taken really good care so that everything worked absolutely smoothly. All questions were answered promptly and all coordination was easily done.
The appartment is as seen on the pictures: An awesome view of Pikes Place Market, the ferris wheel, the bay down to the harbour - just perfect. And it is not just a single window, its all windows!
The place of course was absolutely clean and very well maintained.
100% recommendation!"
2392869,37303893,2015-07-06,19282834,Travis,"This was a fantastic place for us to stay during our trip. It was within short walking distance to all sorts of restaurants, and right next to the Pike's farmer's market. Eve and Michael were great hosts, and answered all of our questions about places to visit, where to eat, and when the best time was to see the city. They were very responsive and check in/out was a breeze--couldn't recommend this property enough!"
2392869,37739067,2015-07-10,31176090,Tim,Eve met us quickly....checked in while we were there...and left us alone too!...WORKED LIKE CLOCKWORK!!
2392869,38263398,2015-07-14,31463324,Christine,Views were amazing. Close to everything. Eve and Daniela were great. We had a great time. 
2392869,38597783,2015-07-17,30725427,Shannon,Gorgeous and spotlessly clean apartment in a perfect location. Eve went above and beyond to meet us and make us feel at home (even leaving a bottle of wine!) Highly recommended for Seattle tourists or business travelers.
2392869,40213053,2015-07-29,5910526,Robert,"The two best reasons for staying here are the outstanding views (Elliot Bay and the ferris wheel) and the central location near Pike's Market. the apartment itself was adequate but nothing special. It had parquet wood floors which needed refinishing, the furnishings were generic and the apartment needed better maintenance (e.g. a tear in a sofa seam) and more thorough cleaning. Eve seemed responsive to email feedback after we left, so maybe these deficiencies will be corrected"
2392869,40727890,2015-08-02,22662907,Julie,Wonderful apartment and location with a great view! Eve was very helpful and the apartment had everything we needed. Highly recommend! 
2392869,41736785,2015-08-09,31405619,Sheila,"This place was better than expected, the view is amazing and its close to so many different places to eat. Much happier with this experience than with any hotel experience I've had. Will be sure to use Airbnb in the future!"
2392869,43479892,2015-08-20,16522248,Jooree,Good area. Great condo. Overall good experience.
2392869,45242407,2015-09-01,30410100,Stuart,"The apartment met our needs and was spacious and comfortable.  Great location within walking distance to public transportation, sights, and restaurants.  We especially enjoyed the view - day and night the waterfront view was delightful! "
2392869,45799669,2015-09-06,13507802,Katie,"Overall, our stay here was comfortable. The property is well-located for exploring the main tourist areas of Seattle, with its close proximity to Pike's Place Market and the Space Needle, etc a quick monorail ride away. The view was truly spectacular--we spent lots of time by the windows, watching boats go by and shoppers bustling around at the market.

I was incredibly impressed that the host proactively offered early check in. That was a real wow!

We did feel that the place needed a bit of freshening up, as some of the furnishings were showing a bit of wear. Everything provided was adequate, but nothing extra--no extra blankets or throws, for example. It was clean, however. 

Although overall we had a pleasant stay, I do feel at this price point, even given the location, I expected a slightly higher overall spec. 

Note that only pics 11 and 12 seem to be of the actual unit where we stayed."
2392869,46743643,2015-09-13,40250203,Angela,"Overlooking Pike Place Market, you really can't get any better of a location. Besides the awesome views, we were walking distance to pretty much everything that was on our list to see and eat. The convenience was worth a million bucks but the view...priceless!

The apartment itself is clean and spacious and had all the amenities we needed. Daniela was the perfect host, always checking in on us to make sure we had everything we needed.

I would totally recommend staying here and on my next trip to Seattle, I hope to be able to book the same apartment."
2392869,48777465,2015-09-28,40499111,Paul,"Met us with key right on time, there was a welcome bottle of wine on the bed, and place was spotless and all as advertised. Great (email hidden)n't wait to come back!"
2392869,49956313,2015-10-07,31377564,Janet,"Daniela make check in very convenient:  she can arrange a self check in.  The apartment is great, the view is wonderful and the location is perfect for many Seattle destinations."
2392869,50972996,2015-10-16,22883855,Lindsey,"This BnB will definitely remain close to the top of my list for favorite places to stay in Seattle. It is dangerously close to EVERYTHING, including the chocolate dessert at Le Pichet. The apartment was perfectly spotless, comfy and livable for the week long stay. There was plenty of space, and the unit was thoughtfully furnished from glassware to water filter to toiletries.   The arrival instructions were thorough and check in/out was a breeze."
2392869,52286788,2015-10-27,24009741,Lawrence,"Looking for a place to stay for a last minute getaway, my wife and I can across Daniella's place. She was very responsive to our emails and questions and had everything ready and set up for us in a weeks notice. Her place was modern, very clean and beautiful. We felt like we were at home. The view was amazing and could not believe we had such a wonderful place to stay for our trip. From the cleanliness to the decor and the soft sheets and abundant amount of amenities we had such an amazing experience. 5 stars for hospitality!! Daniela was easy to get a hold of and made sure we had everything we needed. Thank you again for making our experience an unforgettable one. "
2392869,54019047,2015-11-15,29010143,Satu,The apartment was clean and comfortable. The location is amazing. Jocelyn was extremely accommodating host and made sure we had everything we needed. Would stay again!
2392869,57273971,2015-12-23,26024999,Weiqin,Nice comfortable place. Super good night view.
3626497,16190337,2014-07-22,3831403,Peter And Sarah,"Both Elyse's cozy condo and Elyse were great. I would book with her again.

This classic condo is clean, comfortably furnished, and well maintained. The bed was cozy, soft and comfortable in its own bed-sized ""nook"". The window blinds were great for letting in light and maintaining privacy. WiFi was strong and fast. The kitchen had everything needed for two people to cook comfortably. The simple tiled bathroom was tidy and cozy. There's a mirror just outside the bathroom and with good lighting to help 2 people get ready at the same time.

The building is an older (1930's?), brick and wood construction walk-up building on a hill. The condo is on the ground floor at the rear of the building, protected by a fence and a railing. I lived in this type of building before and was used to it, but if you expect not to hear any sounds from other building occupants, that's just not realistic. But the most we heard were light footsteps. The building and the area was actually very quiet during our visit- it seems that most residents and neighbors aren't party people, or loud TV watchers, either.

The location was perfect for our wanderings of Capitol Hill, and sampling of shops, parks, bars, and restaurants. It's a few, steep blocks uphill to Broadway, and a few level blocks over to Olive Way's bar/resto zone. Let's not forget Top Pot, either, and it's very tempting hill-climbing fuel.

Elyse was very responsive and helpful, promptly responding via email and text, and checking in with us by text mid-rental. She was also was very accommodating to our schedule, and sympathetic to some challenges with the AirBnB site.

We had no trouble parking, because we found a spot on the street as we arrived, and just walked around the remainder of the time. I noticed a few open spots nearby as we walked around, so parking shouldn't be too bad, but rock star might be hard to get. Load-in/out from the alley access would be very easy once you get the key.

Would happily rent from Elyse again.
"
3626497,16234911,2014-07-23,18158820,Damian,"Elyse was a great host! She responded promptly to my messages and was an absolute pleasure to interact with during my stay.  Her condo is conveniently located near all of the downtown attractions and the bars/restaurants on Capitol Hill and Queen Anne.  Additionally, the size of the condo is perfect for one or two people, which the pictures accurately depict.  I highly recommend her place to maximize your stay in Seattle!"
3626497,16382861,2014-07-26,13314869,Jen,"Elyse's place is very nice, and Elyse herself was great and helpful with insider tips about what to do and how to get around Seattle. The apartment is serene and comfortable, with an older charm and some really cool details. I liked the sleeping nook a lot - cozy! The apartment is on the ground floor and I did hear some upstairs neighbours walking around, but it wasn't loud or bothersome. The location is sweet, equidistant to Broadway, Pike/Pine Corridor, and Downtown. Thanks!"
3626497,16514235,2014-07-28,9521246,Benjamin,"Elyse and her fiance were welcoming when we arrived and quickly showed us the condo. She was very accommodating with our arrival time and communicated very quickly about any questions we had and checked in with us throughout the stay to make sure we were comfortable. The location is great, quiet but close to the excitement of the city. "
3626497,16635564,2014-07-30,18229037,Andrew,"Elyse was a great host. She made us feel welcome and even left us blueberries in the fridge. She also left little sticky notes for things that may have been unclear.

The apartment looks as good as it does in the listing and is nicely decorated. We found the apartment to feel clean and spacious.

Two standout features of this listing are:
1) The neighborhood - from talking to some locals, apparently the neighborhood around Broadway is not ""touristy"". Things didn't feel ""touristy"" and everyone I spoke with was really nice. I thought being able to go walk up and down Broadway from the apartment was pretty cool. Elyse's neighborhood also feels safe.
2) The bed - one of the comfiest beds I've ever slept on! Also, nice sheets.

Overall, we had a great experience staying here."
3626497,17175400,2014-08-08,2114007,Alyson,Our stay in the condo was fantastic. It was a perfect amount of space and the neighborhood was great as well. We walked to breakfast each morning and one afternoon walked to the downtown shopping & Pike Place Market. Everything in the apt was so clean and neat & we felt very welcomed by note reminders around the house. Also I loved the piano! I could only play chopsticks and my 6th grade recital piece but I loved pretending I could play nonetheless. 
3626497,17377267,2014-08-11,18349948,Maria,"Elyse was great with communication and gave us some advice on getting to her condo from the airport that ended up being extremely useful.  The location was easy to find and the neighborhood was very cool.  It was evidently an up and coming neighborhood, which resulted in quite a bit of contrast between the old and new.  We loved it.  The pictures and description of the condo were spot on, so we knew what to expect.  However, we were pleasantly surprised that Elyse took the time to leave out area maps for us, leave notes in places to help us out (like finding ""hidden"" light switches), and be super friendly, offering up suggestions and giving directions.  The price we paid was on point, and we would highly recommend both Elyse and this condo to Seattle visitors wishing to stay in the Capitol Hill area.  "
3626497,17634964,2014-08-15,18348427,Cameron,"This was a great apt in a quiet yet central neighborhood.  The place was very clean and comfortable.  The kitchen was equipped with everything needed to cook if you like, but the plethora of wonderful restaurants nearby made it unnecessary for me.  

Elyse was very pleasant and made check in very easy.  She also was kind enough to share with me some recommendations for nearby food and drink options.  

The apt is just a short walk to downtown and is in what appeared to be a very safe neighborhood.  This would be a perfect place to stay for a couple looking to explore the city, or someone on business that just needs a place to sleep and work.  "
3626497,17709862,2014-08-16,7720996,Kristi,"What a lovely apartment! And in a great location. Elyse left helpful notes and essentials (coffee, plenty of towels and blankets) that helped us have a seamless stay. "
3626497,18071683,2014-08-21,1545457,Kenneth,"The stay was great. Elyse met us the day we arrived and was flexible on our arrival time which helped a lot. She also provided a map which shows some of the local attractions and helped get us oriented.

The place is nicely located in Capitol Hill in walking distance of all Cap Hill has to offer as well as just a bit over a mile from tourist attractions such as Pike's Place Market. Her space is nicely put together and comfortable with nice furnishings. We did spend most of our time out of the condo as there was a lot to explore.

I would definitely stay here again!
"
3626497,18183988,2014-08-23,487549,Peregrine,"Elyse is a great host & went out of her way to make sure we knew where her place was. The apartment is just how it looks - cute, clean & close to everything in Cap Hill. It's just off the beaten path enough to be quiet.  The sleeping nook is adorable. "
3626497,18330442,2014-08-25,5449215,Sruti,"Elyse's apartment is really wonderful. Clean, thoughtfully decorated, and really peaceful. We instantly felt at home. The location is great and we really felt like locals immersing ourselves in the vibes of Capitol Hill. Great  walking distance from bars, downtown, and Volunteer Park. Overall, wonderful experience, thank you so much Elyse!"
3626497,18491805,2014-08-27,5640180,Katherine,We had such a fun time in Seattle.  Elyse was very welcoming and gave us suggestions as to what to do and helpful maps.  The apartment was very nice and in a great location.  We essentially only used it to sleep as Seattle has a lot to do and lot to eat.  We walked everywhere from there and if we were too tired it was close to some bus lines.  We would definitely stay there again!
3626497,18570612,2014-08-28,13197927,Jessica,"This place was lovely! Elyse made it incredibly easy to check in, despite her not being available in person to show us around. She was very communicative and the space was immaculate. It was very centrally located for where we needed to be. We'll definitely be staying here again!"
3626497,18806915,2014-09-01,18362772,Jamie,"The host was great. She was clear in her communication, easy to get ahold of and on time to meet us. Her place was perfect for us. It was exactly as she described. She also had coffee and tea for us and the kitchen was easy to use. The location was stellar. Easy walk to downtown, easy walk to Capitol hill stores .  Elyse also stored our luggage for us on the last day because we had a late flight. Super helpful. I would return to this place in a heartbeat. Also loved loved loved Seattle. What a great city!  Oh yeah, Elyse left us maps too, and explained the basic directions. Really helpful. Five stars for sure!"
6274351,34355919,2015-06-07,34365270,Michael,"Michelle was very welcoming and super super helpful! My partner and I were brand new to Seattle and Michelle did so much to make us comfortable and help us whenever we needed assistance. Her home was beautiful and clean, a wonderfully comfortable place for us while we visited! Also the neighborhood was perfect: safe, friendly, with an awesome coffee shop / bar near by. For getting downtown, the bus stops just a block away and there's always the lite rail or an Uber nearby."
6274351,34925584,2015-06-13,30722588,Scott,"Excellent host, house, neighborhood, and room.  Very comfortable.  Good location.  Everything top notch.  "
6274351,35154084,2015-06-15,34877831,Cat,"Wow! What a beautiful location to stay in, and such a lovely lady hosting, as well. I had told Michelle I was visiting friends so I knew the area okay, and she left me be for most of the weekend. She was always helpful and prompt when I texted her questions. The place itself - I could not have asked for a better one! It is right next to a great running/walking trail that runs along Lake Washington and a very safe neighborhood. Her dog was also the calmest dog I have ever met."
6274351,35425702,2015-06-18,34185996,Juliette,Michelle 's home was comfortable and very nice. Michelle is a very nice and very helpful guiding me. She picked me up from dropping my car off to be shipped. Thank you for making my stay in Seattle so pleasant. 
6274351,35607314,2015-06-20,24868499,Lee,"Great location and place! A very nice part of Seattle, very clean and a great atmosphere."
6274351,46697656,2015-09-13,31053757,William,I enjoyed a pleasant stay here long-term during a summer internship. Michelle was kind enough to drive me to and from the airport. Had no issues and liked the house and its proximity to the light rail and buses. The stairs are good exercise!
6274351,50624885,2015-10-13,22136344,Christopher,"Michelle is a spectacular host, friendly and super helpful. Accommodations were clean, comfortable, and I had a very pleasant and enjoyable stay! I would highly recommend if you are visiting Seattle."

It is a straight shot down I-5 to our favorite hangout, Alki Beach. Susan is a gracious host. Any questions that we had, she immediately got back to us. The condo is, affordable, clean, beautiful and has an at home feel. The neighborhood is great and the neighbors are very friendly. Thanks Susan for helping to make our vacation as lovely as it was. I look forward to visiting Seattle again next year.

953595,8990789,2013-12-01,1586593,Jo Breen (Jody),"This apartment in upper Queen Anne in Seattle has been perfect for us. A one bed, one bath with a queen size sleeper that is SO comfy.  On-sight parking is easy & wonderful to have. The quiet neighborhood location with simple walking access to all is so fun. One of the best bakeries in Seattle is just down the back lane and a market is located on the next corner. The Queen Anne shops, cafes & restaurants are about a 4 block walk; one I take almost daily. The apartment itself is in excellent condition: clean, modern, outfitted, light and airy with everything we need. I highly recommend these great digs. Andrea and her property manager have been very accessible for any inquiries or help. All over rating? EXCELLENT & GREAT!"
953595,12389494,2014-05-01,1586593,Jo Breen (Jody),"I have reviewed the Bright + Airy Queen Anne apartment but I would like to add we stayed for 6 months. We really enjoyed our time in the apartment itself as well as the location and neighborhood. I was sad to go! If you are looking for a great Seattle spot with all the conveniences of a clean, well organized space this will be your happy place. I also want to mention the owner Andrea and her property manager Greg were more than dependable for any detail gone awry ( maybe a glitch in the internet that Greg tweaked immediately ) All in all, throughout the six months we really had nothing of a major incident. ALL was smooth. Thank you again Andrea and Cheers to Greg for such great team work.
"
953595,17264483,2014-08-10,13647404,Brian,The Bright + Airy Queen Anne Apartment was perfect for our two week stay.  The apartment accommodated my family of four with no problem.  Andrea and Greg were very responsive and I would rent from them again when we return to Seattle.   The Queen Anne neighborhood was gorgeous and I can't wait to come back and explore again.  Thanks Andrea!
953595,17823626,2014-08-18,15108582,Helen,"Fabulous apartment. Very clean, good supply of everything you could need. Great communication from Andrea ensuring that we had everything we needed both before and during our stay. The neighbourhood was perfect - easy to get to downtown Seattle using the buses and a really nice area just to wander around.
We would recoomend staying here for anyone visiting Seattle."
953595,18322321,2014-08-25,17931620,Ernesto,"Andrea and her place were great! She and her property manager were always helpful and quick to respond to my messages. 

The apartment was really nice and had everything I needed to feel at home. There's no a/c, but it does have fans, which help quite a bit. 

I would definitely recommend this place to anyone."
953595,19090282,2014-09-06,11137841,Ashley,"Andrea, our host, wasn't in town but she communicated with us prior and during our stay to make sure that we had everything we needed. She also had Greg, her property manager, called us to make sure we were settled and everything was exactly as described. The apartment was impeccably clean and updated. We loved the neighborhood. It was so quaint and had lots of good restaurants, groceries, yoga/pilate studios, and anything else you might need in walking distance.  Queen Anne is close to everything in Seattle without the crazy traffic.  It was a nice getaway for us.  Wish we had more time to see the rest of the Pacific Northwest."
953595,19390238,2014-09-11,9123455,Courtney,"Andrea was a great host - very easy going and easy to get a hold of. The apartment itself was amazing. Plenty of space, very clean and had every amenity you could need. The neighborhood is perfect if you're looking for something away from the hustle and bustle of downtown Seattle - BUT still very easy to get downtown. Plenty of street parking, delicious cafes three blocks away.  

The worst part of my stay,  leaving. "
953595,26515505,2015-02-15,3243449,Mehmet Cenk,Best place to stay in Seattle.
953595,27590057,2015-03-08,5761971,Pamela,"I was in Seattle for a job and the apartment was perfect, nearby shopping and close to the location I was  working at.
The neighborhood is fabulous, beautiful as spring was just starting to bloom. The neighbors very nice. Greg the manager is fantastic.
I hope to return and actually have a vacation! It is a lovely place and the location is great.  Andrea is wonderful!"
953595,27863021,2015-03-13,29042686,Ross,"I booked Andrea's place last minute for my parents - and I mean last minute - and I couldn't have been happier. Andrea was incredibly timely and helpful with her responses - and given this was my first Air BnB experience it's left a great first impression. Thanks Andrea! The apartment is brilliantly located in the Queen Anne neighborhood, so close to everything you need and the space itself is clean, bright, modern and comfortable. It's definitely on my list for next time. "
953595,27982180,2015-03-15,10662684,Erin,"We had the most lovely stay in this adorable apartment. My husband had a work conference and we had been super busy at home, so the baby and I took the opportunity to tag along and have a weekend away. Andrea was fantastic with communication leading up to and throughout our visit. The place was super clean when we arrived and we were able to get into the building and apartment on our own with no trouble at all. I must admit that we didn't explore the town immediately. It was so cozy that we turned the living room sofa into a bed and stayed cozy watching Netflix for a while. In fact, we liked that sofa bed so much, we got one for our spare room when we got back home!

The neighborhood was great! Super nice and safe for me and the babe. It was a rainy weekend while we were there so we didn't walk around too much but there is so much to do close by. 

We loved the complimentary pillows, but don't forget to pull the cases off before you leave or you will have to ship them back like we did. Oops! 

I would definitely recommend that you stay at Andrea's, you won't regret it. We certainly hope to have the chance to stay there again sometime. Cheers!"
953595,28216458,2015-03-20,28190723,David,"We had a fantastic time visiting Seattle and Andrea's apartment in Queen Anne was a perfect base for our trips in the city, the islands and to Mt Rainer.  Queen Anne is such a fun neighborhood - we found the people and businesses very charming.  The apartment itself had everything we needed, was quiet and very clean.  Andrea was super responsive and timely.  Thanks for everything!"
953595,28707697,2015-03-29,602284,Annette,"The apartment was comfortable, very clean, easy to access and very practical. My mom, son and I each slept well and had plenty of space to spread out. I found the neighborhood quiet, peaceful, safe and family friendly. It is out of bustle of downtown but close enough to make access pretty easy. Andrea was very responsive and easy to reach. The apartment is just as described!"
953595,29377228,2015-04-07,13747383,Robin,"Andrea was very kind and informative when I contacted her by email and phone. The apartment is just as nice as it looks in the photos; and is super clean and un-cluttered. The artwork is classy. The kitchen, the bed and the bath are all high quality; it is a pleasant apartment in an excellent location.
We would stay there again when we are in Seattle."
953595,29754189,2015-04-12,4101992,Caroline,"Really enjoyed our Seattle weekend in Andrea's place! Super clean 1 bedroom apartment with all basic kitchen equipment in place. The location is amazing: 35-45 minute walk to the Space Needle, 5 minute stroll to gorgeous views of the mountains, 2 minute walk to hot coffee and fresh pastries. On-street parking is easy. Andrea does not live in Seattle, but she put us in touch immediately with a local host, who checked in with us the day of our arrival (as did she). All was trouble-free. "
953595,30108342,2015-04-17,22357676,Carrie,"This apartment was adorable and looked just as pictured. The neighborhood was ideal for getting around town and for amazing views. Andrea was quick to respond to emails and was very helpful. This was the most pleasant experience I've had in all of my visits to Seattle and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a quiet, comfortable place to stay with plenty of street parking!"
953595,30231665,2015-04-19,30020119,Sonia,"Just stayed a couple of night at Andrea's place. The apartment was as described. Quiet area of Queen Anne with hips to do just few blocks away. Andrea and her manager Greg were very responsive. 
Would stay here again. "
953595,30515210,2015-04-23,22623095,Avery,"Five words: I want to live here.
Only downside: Might develop addiction to local bakery.

Andrea's apartment is fantastic! It's exactly as listed and an exceptional place. I opened the door and it smelled like a meadow, wow! The bathroom has heated floors and the shower head was mounted for tall people so you won't have to duck in the shower either. I could brag about everything, but I'd just be repeating what the listing so accurately describes. Do yourself a favor and request a booking, you won't regret it. I would stay here a 100 times over, and have already suggested Andrea's apartment to a couple of my friends. She is a great communicator and genuinely cares about how you feel about your stay, Thanks so much, Andrea!. "
953595,30626211,2015-04-25,30077810,Manuel,"I can't put into words how amazing this place was. Getting in was a breeze. The rental was immaculate. It's a large space with plenty of room to stretch out. Liked the modern decor. The area is beautiful! Communication was enough to be helpful but not so much as to be intrusive. Great bakery right around the corner and a great bar right around the other corner, both walking distance. Also not too far from Kerry park which was an amazing view and even better at night. Seriously can't say enough nice things about the whole experience around this rental unit. A+"
953595,31706589,2015-05-09,7599673,Nichole,"The apartment was clean, modern, spacious, quiet, and relaxing. The garden-filled neighborhood was lovely. It's a little off the beaten path if you don't have a car but close to bus lines, a short walk to a great bakery and stunning views, a longer walk to shops, and an easy Uber ride to downtown, Seattle center, Ballard, and more. We enjoyed the French press coffee, full kitchen, and free laundry but would have liked a more supportive bed and couch than the small IKEA platform bed and foldout couch (both about as comfy as a futon). The TV provided was Apple TV with Netflix and Hulo, no local or cable stations, and it required some setting up. Andrea was out of town and her property manager Greg was available but hands-off. An external key box with a code made check-in easy. "
953595,32824225,2015-05-22,7840070,Magdalena,"Andrea is a very kind and welcoming host.
She was attentive and did make sure that our needs are met. She always replied to my communications within minutes.

We rented the apartment for my in-laws and they were very content and more comfortable in this beautiful unit then in the hotel. 
The apartment is spacious, clean and as advertised: bright and airy. 
The neighborhood is the best in the whole Seattle, walkable, scenic, green, safe, quiet, and with enough restaurants and cafes. 
I would highly recommend staying at Andrea's place.
   "
953595,33045702,2015-05-24,29941183,Angela,"Andrea and Greg were great hosts.  Even though we didn't physically meet them, we felt very well taken care of.  Communication was great.  Andrea really took away any of my hesitations about staying in an airbnb!  We stayed for 2 nights and 3 days.  Andrea was very flexible with check in/out times, which was wonderful for us.  The space was just as described and pictured (except there are shades now instead of curtains) and we enjoyed our time there very much.  The street and building is very quiet.  Street parking is just as easy as Andrea says it is.  We basically parked right in front of the building.  The unit was clean and we had no issues feeling comfortable there.  There is a filtered water pitcher in the fridge.  Enough hot water for a lovely long shower.  We had no issues with the TV/wifi.  We actually didn't sleep in the bed - we ended up camping out on the sofa bed in the living room by the TV (Andrea provided an excellent, very thorough apartment manual that included pictures on how to set up the bed).  The sofa bed was pretty darn comfortable!  Andrea provides lots of recommendations.  We loved the fish tacos from Malena's Taco Shop and had a breakfast sandwich and coffee from Macrina Bakery!  YUM!  Not far from the Space Needle and downtown.  Bus stop within walking distance.  If you are into board games, check out the Blue Highway Games on Queen Anne Ave N & Boston!  I can't think of anything else to say, but to stay here if you need a place in Seattle!  Great location!  Great apartment! Great hosts!  We definitely will stay again when we come back to Seattle.  We couldn't have asked for a better first airbnb experience!!  Thank you Andrea and Greg!"
953595,34353354,2015-06-07,31763451,Laura,"Amazing!!!! The apartment was super comfortable and very clean!!! The neighborhood is gorgeous!! I wish i could have stayed there longer. Andrea and Greg were fantastic and very attentive.

953595,34937469,2015-06-14,4340677,Cheryl,"This is our first AirBNB stay and Andrea and her property manager could not have made it easier. The apt was spacious, spotless with all the amenities you need. We loved the location, quiet and convenient. Thank you Andrea for your thoughtful touches. "
953595,35270667,2015-06-16,5176425,Denis,"Staying at Andrea's place was easy and awesome.  The place is incredibly clean & neat.  The location was great, and while they were ready to help at any time, because of the nature of my trip I came & went at odd times."
953595,35784523,2015-06-22,30707843,Hugh,"Andrea was very responsive and provided a detailed guide of things to do in the area as well as excellent recommendations for local restaurants and cafes.  The apartment is located on a quiet block that is just a short walk to shopping and restaurants.  There were plenty of parking spots available on the street, so there is no concern if you have a car with you.  The apartment was very clean and spacious.  Checking in and checking out were a breeze.  We will definitely look to stay here again."
953595,36278226,2015-06-27,11878123,Emily,"Andrea was an amazing host and provided clear information about the apartment and neighborhood to make our stay enjoyable.  The apartment is perfect!  It was clean, comfortable and beautiful.  The location couldn't be better - on a great residential tree-lined street, great for walking.  I will always recommend this spot and this host."
953595,41569451,2015-08-08,15949767,Tracy,"We stayed in the flat for 6 weeks and it was absolutely great. A real home from home. The proximity Queen Anne and also down town Seattle and the vicinity to bus stops makes this a fantastic location. 

Andrea and Greg could not have been more helpful and where there for everything we needed - but also gave us our space, The flat is lovely, we stayed two adults and a child and there was lots of room - the sofa bed is great and is comfy enough to use for 6 weeks easily. 
If we come back to  Seattle we will be contacting Andrea again.
"
953595,42882459,2015-08-16,32749125,David,"Our stay at Andrea's apartment in Queen Anne was exceptional in every way.  Communications were fast and super helpful, including advice on details like local shopping.   Check-in and check out were incredibly easy.  The apartment and the supplies were spotless and up-to-date.  The place was quiet and easy to find.
Overall, the experience was perfect.  More than basics, there is an intangible aspect to staying at this location.  The neighborhood and street where the apartment is situated is amazing.  If you are looking for a place that will give you the sensation of living in the super-cool town that Seattle is right now, this is highly recommended.  Small requests for things needed were handled with speed and elegance.  First class experience.  "
953595,44003638,2015-08-23,807481,Adama,"Andrea's apartment is in a great, quiet neighborhood, accessible to cafes, restaurants, massage places, groceries, etc. The apartment is even better than the pictures do it justice. It's clean and lovely, fully stocked for extended stays. 

Andrea & Greg were incredibly helpful, thoughtful and thorough. Communication was clear and suggestions were plentiful. 

I would definitely recommend a stay here.

"
953595,45265589,2015-09-01,37845345,Ela,"We had a great stay at Andrea's place in Queen Anne's. The apartment is bright and clean, well equipped with all you can wish for. Andrea made sure that all our needs were met - she even arranged for a crib for our two year old joy. All three of us slept like babies - it is so calm and quiet. The location is perfect for picturesque strolls through green and peaceful streets of Queen Anne's and visits to Macrina's bakery, which is just a minute down the road. It is very close to the city center - it takes about 10 minutes by car and there is always parking space on the street. We highly recommend Andrea as a host and we will definitely consider asking for her hospitality during our next visit to Seattle."
953595,45640313,2015-09-04,20572933,Caitlin,Beautiful apartment in a great location. Pictures of the apartment are exactly what you find. The neighborhood is safe and easy to get around. Plenty of free street parking. Well stocked kitchen. Andrea was responsive and easy to work with. I will definitely recommend to friends. 
953595,45982304,2015-09-07,40318785,Hyun,"I booked a trip to Seattle for my parents and aunt/uncle. This was my first time using AirBnB and Andrea made everything so easy and accessible. She was prompt and easy to reach- which is of utmost importance for me. 

Prior to the trip, she would check in with me to make sure everything was going smoothly. Her instructions were concise and easy to follow and her place, from what my family relayed to me, was very well organized. 

They really enjoyed their vacation- which was a first in a very long time. The trip made them happy- which in turn made me even happier. 

She will not let you down. "
953595,46794887,2015-09-13,5804411,Noel,"Thank you Andrea. The AirBnB was spacious, quiet, clean, and in a great location! The perfect landing pad for exploring the city. We hope to be back again soon. "
953595,47993799,2015-09-22,25541428,Terry,Andrea prepared a wonderful Queen Anne Hill/ Seattle guide with all sorts of great tips. The house was clean and neat just as in the photos and I appreciated her attention to using natural products. She was prompt and responsive to my questions.
953595,48585999,2015-09-27,12165808,"Manuel, Debbie And Justin","Andrea sent us a complete information packet before we left for Seattle which was very helpful. The street the apartment is on is beautiful and the apartment is exactly as it is described-bright, airy, and immaculately clean! The location is perfect for exploring Queen Anne and is within walking distance of Seattle Pacific University where our son attends school. Andrea was easy to communicate with and we enjoyed our stay. We would recommend this apartment to those who are looking to stay in the Seattle area. "
953595,51614652,2015-10-22,103808,Maggie,"I felt so welcome from the moment I arrived in Seattle. Andrea graciously let me store my bag in the flat while it was being prepared for my arrival. She anticipated all my needs by providing dish washing detergent, laundry detergent, extra paper towels and toilet paper. Everything was so clean and spacious. I loved this neighborhood and felt so safe and lucky to stay here. I would recommend Andrea, Greg and her flat very enthusiastically! I hope to stay here again in the future."
953595,51848767,2015-10-24,20742756,Samit,Wonderful house and location. Andrea was really great in providing all the necessary information to make our trip easy and successful.
953595,55132411,2015-11-28,48161596,Burton,"We rented Andrea's apartment for family that were visiting Seattle for Thanksgiving and it was perfect.  The location is on a quiet street that is convenient for exploring Seattle and walking to the shops and restaurants of Queen Anne.  It was a great base for my family to visit the city -- and to rest up after a busy day.  The apartment is spotless and has great space.   Andrea was very communicative and offered lots of great information about the apartment, the neighborhood and Seattle in general.  The place was exactly as advertised -- and we'd happily stay again.  "
953595,57778209,2015-12-29,48078145,Valerie,"Andrea was an amazing host. Before we arrived she sent very detailed information about the apartment, the neighborhood, and Seattle. And she continued to check in throughout the visit to make sure everything was going well and to ensure we were having a great experience. 
The apartment is FANTASTIC! It is so spacious and sparkling clean and Andrea has thought of everything we could have possibly needed. The location is ideal...on a beautiful, quiet, tree lined street in a great neighborhood. Great bus options for getting downtown too.  
Great location, great apartment, great host! "
3916050,18382198,2014-08-25,20323841,Robyn,"Lisa was kind. The room is small, but if you need a place in a pinch, it gets the job done.  She does have 1 or 2 other people besides herself living there, but didn't see them often."
3916050,18778394,2014-08-31,2591391,Edward,"Lisa was very sweet and I had a great time at her place. The room is small but the price was right and the location is very good, safe, and close to lots of Seattle. "
3916050,19494635,2014-09-13,12393648,Brian,"Lisa's home is in a very good location if you need to get into downtown Seattle, but don't want to spend a bunch of money on a place closer in. There is a stop for the Rapid Ride bus only one block from Lisa's house and that bus will get you downtown in about 25 minutes (and has free wifi!)
I didn't have much of a chance to chat with Lisa once I arrived, but she was very prompt in responding over email when I was planning my trip."
3916050,19645660,2014-09-15,15585637,Hans,"Lisa was great in communicating back and forth and getting to the place from the E bus line from downtown was easy (just take the 91st St RapidLine stop). 
The room was as advertised; it was a small room, but very comfortable and no issues with the wifi while I was there."
3916050,20064489,2014-09-22,21385294,Nella,"Great host, very friendly and sweet. Good small room, clean, smells fresh, clean bathroom. Nice neighborhood; not near buses though, you should have a vehicle if you are looking to get around town! "
3916050,20395145,2014-09-28,21385294,Nella,"Round 2 with Lisa was absolutely amazing and perfect! My apologies for some inaccurate bus information on my first review (I am not able to modify it). There are some bus lines right up the block from Lisa's place (I used the E line bus mostly) with easy access to the city.

Lisa is a sweet heart and very warm and welcoming; her genuine personality has rubbed off on her lovely son Adrian! 

Wifi was readily accessible, I was able to do laundry no problem, entering the apartment was easy (a key was always available for use). 
The space was very clean, the bathroom was clean! Overall a wonderful experience!"
3916050,25650438,2015-01-21,25892250,Michele,"Pros: I got lots of privacy. The room was clean. 2 towels were provided. Communication and parking were good.

Cons: Son screamed a lot and the living room and mostly the kitchen were so dirty is was disgusting. "
3916050,25827391,2015-01-26,26414887,Nader,"Lisa's house is located in a very nice area. Its less than a minute to the E line which comes every 10 minutes or so and will take you to the light rail or downtown.  Plus, her house is near several grocery stores and restaurants within walking distance. The neighborhood is very quiet yet safe. Lisa leaves you to do as you please, so you never feel like a stranger in her home. She is very nice, and will answer any questions you may have. The bedroom is nice and cozy. The WiFi is also fast. If I had to do all over again, I would absolutely do it again!"
3916050,26810700,2015-02-19,17468680,Kate,"Lisa is a friendly helpful host. The room is nice, the bed is comfortable and clean and the house is very quiet. I would definitely stay there again.  Great value for the money!"

3916050,27549976,2015-03-07,26978274,John,I felt very welcome by Lisa's warm greetings when I arrived. The room has great privacy and the house and neighborhood is perfectly quiet. Complimentary bottled water was provided together with clean sheets and bath towels.I had no problem at all during my stay.
3916050,27698986,2015-03-09,4172512,Kirsten,"Lisa's place was very lovely for the price! She wasn't invasive at all and let me go about my business. Despite appearances, the mattress was incredibly comfy (and I have back problems)! I'd gladly stay again. "
3916050,28754072,2015-03-29,6511387,Micha,"Lisa was very welcoming. The house is located not far from Green Lake, in a very nice neighborhood. The room was clean and ready for me. It is not large, but it is a cheap, and comfortable space to stay, for a traveller with a tight budget.

I will recommend staying there, if you find the (accurate) description suitable for you."
3916050,29954196,2015-04-14,30158543,Tomas,Lisa was very accommodating and quick to communicate. The place is right next to the 99 which makes for easy access to North Seattle neighborhoods.

3916050,31488417,2015-05-05,32084405,Hannah Christina,"Lisa was very friendly and helpful.  The room is clean and there were clean sheets and towels.  It was a comfortable bed and I am very greatful to have had such an affordable and convenient place to stay, right off highway I-5."
3916050,32221916,2015-05-15,8880284,Jun,"Lisa was very hospitable and gracious as a host.
I had to make a last minute arrangement, and Lisa was very responsive and accommodating. Reservation, confirmation, and her first response all took place within 10 minutes.  Fresh water and towels were waiting in the room. 

The place was very well maintained - clean, uncluttered, and very comfortable. It is at a very convenient location right off the highway.  

She was also very understanding when I had to leave a little after check-out time because I needed a little extra time for rest. You can tell she really wants her guest to feel comfortable and relaxed. 

Highly recommended."
3916050,32800875,2015-05-21,33595840,River,Bed on floor. Bathroom not clean.
3916050,32951185,2015-05-23,8880284,Jun,"My second time staying at Lisa's place. She was again very hospitable, extremely responsive with communication, which is very important to me when I airbnb. Location is also very convenient right off the highway and close to stores and restaurants. 

Her demeanor makes you feel comfortable and at home. I appreciate her small gestures such as water bottles in the room. The room is relaxing and is not cluttered with the host's belongings, which is the case with some airbnb hosts.

I highly recommend her to anyone visiting Seattle!

3916050,38847353,2015-07-19,33856971,Brent,"Lisa was a very understanding host.  I had to get in very late at night, and had to leave very early in the morning, and she accommodated that very easily.  The house gave a very good feel for Seattle, and she grows some amazing figs!  I only wish that I were able to stay there longer."
3916050,40480565,2015-07-31,15869430,Max,"Lisa was very nice and accomodating.  She was quick to respond to messaging/texting.  The room was what I expected, and mattress was comfy.   The house is in a very nice location: easy to walk to Greenwood, which has great coffee shops, and right by a bus route to downtown, and to the University.  I enjoyed my stay!"
3916050,40693831,2015-08-01,39913500,Quet,"Lisa was a great host, very welcoming. The listing was accurate and the neighborhood was great!"

3916050,41296586,2015-08-05,13353727,Corey,"This place was just as advertised, and was perfect. Lisa worked with my wonky and shifting arrival schedule and made it easy to check in. The neighborhood is quiet, but close to Greenlake (walkable), so a perfect location in my opinion. A nice quiet stay. Would definitely stay here again.  "
3916050,41786464,2015-08-09,13346914,Yang,"Lisa is very nice and friendly. She is very approachable and makes you feel comfortable at home. 

The room is small, and underground. It is sufficient for one person. 

The area is convenient, as there is direct bus to downtown. "
3916050,44261201,2015-08-24,36401449,Kim,"Very good and owner so nice, Thanks a lot. I will see you again"
3916050,44614255,2015-08-27,42079673,Santiago,Lisa was an awesome host. The place was quaint and quiet. Just as posted. You got some great places to eat nearby and public transportation access. Had a great experience.
3916050,45230378,2015-08-31,4285146,Singi,"Lisa was very friendly & welcomed me to her home. Her house is located in a good area, convenient to the highway & Greenville city center. However, the house has a lot of clutter. Parking on the street in front of the house was convenient.
Bathroom was clean enough but a lot of clutter, specially given several guests having to share it. The basement room is basic, nice little window allows fresh air to come in. I found clean towels & bottles of water welcoming. However, the mattress as described is on the floor and not comfortable. It was good enough for the one night. But the sheets were not clean. Didn't look like they were changed since the last guest. They had a few strands of very long hair and the pillowcase had stains. There was no extra sheet provided, just the fitted sheet.
Therefore, I had to utilize my travel sheet & sleeping bag for the night. So glad I had that stuff. For $50+ I expect at minimum clean sheets & clean towels, even if the room & bathroom has not really been scrubbed down. 
I do appreciate Lisa welcoming me with short notice, but it was instant booking, so I expected the room to be clean and ready, anyway."
3916050,46160997,2015-09-08,4460059,Kasra,Room was just as described. Lisa was friendly and welcoming. Great location with walkable streets to nearby Green Lake and cool restaurants in Ballard.
3916050,46663280,2015-09-12,41158892,Paige,"Lisa's was kind and friendly, even though we ran into each other only twice. The room was the perfect little nook, perfect for getting work done. What a great find! Would definitely recommend!"
3916050,47773009,2015-09-21,42734316,思园,Lisa is a great host! She's very nice! Her house's location is very good! It's such a pity that I didn't have enough time to talk with her.:(
4053092,20852044,2014-10-06,1221430,Alex,"The house was exactly as advertised, and was a great place to stay for an overnight in Ballard. The private bedroom and bathroom were extremely clean and cozy. Communication with India was prompt and friendly. She was generous and accommodating when we asked to borrow an iron and hairdryer. It was about a 15 minute walk to the nice shopping and eating zone on Market St. All in all,  if you're keen on the Ballard area, I'd recommend staying here!

Notes on getting around: it's about a $20-25 cab ride downtown to the bus station. If you use car2go, we found that there weren't many available nearby."
4053092,21021468,2014-10-09,17634848,Scout,"I had a wonderful stay at India's house. She met me for check-in and did a great job of explaining the house as well as pointing me in the right direction to local coffee shops, restaurants, and bus line. The room is large with lots of natural light and a very comfortable bed! The house is and yard were well maintained. I enjoyed being in the Ballard neighborhood. Setting up a meeting time with India was very easy. Great host and great house! "
4053092,21067843,2014-10-10,196121,Ken,I reached India in the morning needing a place for one night. She got backed to quickly. We had a very pleasant stay and would highly recommend her place.
4053092,22125524,2014-10-30,1877671,Pam,India's house is so warm and cozy! The upstairs guest room has a nice bathroom and work space. She left out coffee and all the instructions we needed. The area is super central but quiet enough to relax! 
4053092,22511590,2014-11-08,20171752,Bruce,"Quick response from India when we contacted her with questions. 
It was a charming house in a quiet neighborhood and we enjoyed our stay.  "
4053092,23442795,2014-12-01,22770898,Anthony,"India is a fantastic hostess. She kept in contact with us right until arrival, insuring she would be home to greet us and help with directions if needed. Once we arrived, India gave us a tour, showed us our room (which was VERY large), our bathroom, where the amenities were, and even brought us two glasses of water. 

Her listing is entirely acurrate. If anything, the space is larger than described and the bed is very comfortable. 

Her home is located in the best neighborhood in Seattle (Ballard). and is very close to easy public transit and Ballard Ave. Home of the best restaurants in the city. "
4053092,24628835,2014-12-31,17686998,Sanghwa,"The host India was very nice and accomodating although I couldn't have a chance to meet her. She was very organized explaining how to use her house and there was no hassle to use it. The room looked same as the picture and cozy. As advertised, the whole second floor was for guests, so that we could easily make ourself at home. The area there was a little bit far from downtown by public transportation but managable; bicycles and car2go can be a perfect substitute. "
4053092,24798805,2015-01-02,25343450,Tara,India was amazing! We booked our stay with one days notice and India responded within 5 minutes. This was our first airbnb experience and it was surprisingly easy. The space was as advertised and looks exactly like the pictures. Location was awesome. Ballard and Fremont are only minutes away. 
4053092,26121449,2015-02-03,1443092,Jessica,"The room was comfortable, clean and well lit. After a week of traveling all over Seattle and the Olympic Peninsula India's rental was a nice, peaceful space to relax and renew. Highly recommend to future travelers in the Seattle area."
4053092,27703464,2015-03-09,1509031,Kay,Very clean place in lovely Ballard. It was nice to have a back entrance very private feeling and to have parking on the street. 
4053092,28765411,2015-03-29,29960273,Cassy,Lovely neighbourhood with some excellent food and shops nearby. The room was quiet and warm and well set up. We really enjoyed our stay!
4053092,29831435,2015-04-13,7001759,Rebecca,"This is a very comfortable spot, private bath with large bedroom. Entrance in the back door and right up the stairs. The directions were great. We did not have the pleasure of meeting India, she was at a workshop but great communication and will be back for sure. "
4053092,30817550,2015-04-27,20860577,Paul,"India was very welcoming and made sure we could get into her space at the time we wanted. The upstairs rooms were spacious, bright, clean, and felt very homey. The neighborhood is quiet with the old Ballard feel. We appreciated the hospitality and certainly would come again. "
4053092,32004537,2015-05-12,16201918,Toni,"What a lovely, comfortable home in a great Seattle neighborhood. India was away during our stay but the mark of her family life made the place seem homey and welcoming.  Everything was spic and span and well laid out. It's near two other wonderful  Seattle  neighborhoods--Freemont and Greenlake, and,best of all,  near my daughter and her family. Highly recommended."
4053092,33122784,2015-05-25,6390099,Timothy,India has a wonderful home and we felt very comfortable during our stay.  Would definitely stay here again.

It's also close to shopping and restaurants in Ballard and Tremont and the neighborhood coffee shop (Slate) is right around the corner. Would definitely stay here again!"
4053092,38283126,2015-07-14,5756876,Daniel,We felt at home right away. It's a very comfortable space to explore Seattle from. India is a good host. 
4053092,38768028,2015-07-18,2451069,Danesh,"India was amazing -- friendly, very responsive, and had great local recommendations. Room was super clean, had a large comfortable bed, offered lots of privacy and in a great location!"
4053092,39785662,2015-07-26,10732747,Samuel,"India was a great host and the room looks just like on the pics. All was perfect! It's a quite calm residential area, but a bus to downtown is easy to catch close to the house."
4053092,41110589,2015-08-04,12731600,Christopher,"India did a great job of providing a clean, relaxing, and enjoyable space for us to stay. We were thoroughly impressed by the cleanliness of the place and we definitely appreciated the privacy and space afforded by having the upstairs to ourselves. The place itself was really beautiful and well decorated. We really fell in love with the neighborhood - it was quiet and had lots of really nice homes and landscaping. And it still felt pretty close to the city. Lots of good food and drink in the area as well.  

Although we didn't get to talk much in person during our stay, India was great at communicating through AirBnB and answered all our questions promptly. We had no trouble checking in, even though our train arrived late in the night. She was even kind enough to accommodate us leaving our stuff at the place until closer to our departure time on the last day. "
4053092,43824526,2015-08-22,390774,Dimitris,We had a very pleasant stay at India's place. We found both room and the whole upstairs quarters that she offers her guests to be clean and comfortable and India herself polite and helpful. Checkin and checkout were easy and the location in Ballard is great.
4053092,47017575,2015-09-14,43944584,Elizabeth,India was very responsive to my inquiries. The location was quite walkable. The accommodations were clean and cheery.  I would certainly recommend it!
4053092,47327780,2015-09-17,9579903,Georgia Lee,India's place was perfect for our short visit to Seattle. It was accurately reflected in her post. 
4053092,49831949,2015-10-06,14654589,Ashley,"The listing was very accurate.  The house was charming, clean and comfortable.  Having the second floor to ourselves made the experience feel very private.  Great neighborhood with plenty of street parking.  India consistently responded promptly and provided helpful tips on local restaurants.  I would stay here again."
9432497,54830073,2015-11-23,24257117,Kirsten,"My stay at Pauline's 'Be At Home' place was lovely!  I wasn't able to give her much notice--less than 24 hours, that I was coming.  And she responded very quickly--within an hour or two of my request.  

All my texts to her after that, she responded to almost instantaneously, with a gracious welcome and offer to assist with anything I needed.  

I was able to arrive and settle in, getting into the house with a code she gave me, and she had eritten me a note of welcome, telling me the house was a shoes off space, and that I could use the kitchen, LR and bath as I needed or wished.

The room was big, with a comfortable double bed and a recliner in the room.  There was a thermostat that let me adjust the temperature to my liking.  The Windows looked out on the neighborhood, with trees.  

I wanted mostly quiet alone time, and got that easily.  I went out to brunch with friends, having packed up and left beforehand.  I met one member of Pauline's family who was very gracious and welcoming, showing me where hot and cold water was in the kitchen, and might have offered food had I wanted or needed some.  

All in all, a lovely visit in a quiet NE neighborhood.  Not too far from things, with a car.  I hope to visit again.  I was very satisfied and comfortable.  "
9432497,54961801,2015-11-25,49588341,Tweety,It was nice & everyone did there own thing. My massage was great too! Must get 1 from Pauline if u can. Thank u Pauline 
9432497,56269977,2015-12-11,46883182,James,"Pauline welcomed us with a dish of delicious chocolates.  The room was exactly as shown in her photo, the bed quite soft but providing restful sleep.  The room had its own thermostat and we were able to set it to our comfort level when there.  The room included a large closet, a living room style chair and a table with folding leafs.  The house has a large kitchen and living room.  We did not use either as we were visiting a ton of friends and relatives spanning Federal Way to Monroe; we spent a lot of time commuting.  Pauline's house is in an older, established area of Seattle (off Lake City Way) convenient to North Seattle on Northward.  Central and South Seattle commutes can be difficult depending on time of day unless one knows the city (being former residents, we do) or, as I discovered, using the WAZE app which got us from the airport to her house in about 30 minutes at rush hour (read very slow traffic on I-5).  While there we found two great eating places that were new to us: the Fiddler's Inn (Pub) on 35th (.3 miles from Pauline's) and The Breakfast Club on Lake City Way at 123rd (about two miles; parking behind the restaurant).  The house is very convenient to Jefferson Golf Course (Public), a Major Shopping Center (Northgate), recreation at Greenlake, and across from it the Seattle Zoo (excellent).  My wife and I enjoyed our stay at Pauline's and recommend it to those going to Seattle."
9432497,57454942,2015-12-26,2034965,Marina,"Pauline was very helpful and acomodating, my flight was rescheduled and she made sure I could easily enter the house and find everything I need. The house is in a great quiet neighborhood, close to the buses going to the downtown Seattle (approx. 0.6-0.8 mile walk). Buses go regularly according the schedule. Never had trouble travelling to and from the house. Additionally, the house is nice, clean, quiet and spacious. I really enjoyed a nice soft bed, spacious bathroom and the temperature thermostat in the room. Pauline is very friendly and willing to help and give advice when I needed. Very prompt with the responses as well."
9432497,57684029,2015-12-28,50168519,Alex,"room and washroom is clean. host is friendly.

4030600,19846306,2014-09-19,2678675,Jon,"Miesha is an extraordinary host. She is down-to-Earth with a sunny disposition. The house was clean, spacious, and afforded all the amenities we were expecting. We stayed with her for 6 days and were extremely satisfied with our choice, and eternally grateful for her hospitality. Thank Miesha!"

4030600,20172932,2014-09-24,9410752,Peter,"Nothing but great things to say about Miesha and the room.  The location was perfect and  room was exactly what we were looking for.  Miesha is very friendly, accommodating, and knowledgeable about the city.   We had our bicycles with us and took the short ride down the hill to Magnuson Park for a swim, as well as hopping on the bike trail to go to Ballard, Fremont, downtown, etc.  The room is not large but we were out and about most of our stay so it wasn't an issue and Miesha made us feel very comfortable in the rest of the house so we didn't feel confined to our room at all.  We would definitely stay here again if we were staying in the area.  "
4030600,21166813,2014-10-12,863606,Lancy,The area is great! Only a five minute drive to the sat farmers market.  Miesha was super nice and accommodating to my schedule.  Too bad our daughters didn't get to meet!
4030600,22389945,2014-11-04,23192707,Andriy,"I had never been to Seattle before this stay, and my goal was to explore the city in and out. Miesha made me feel like I'm at home since the very first minute till the end of my 3 days stay. I'm so happy I chose to stay there instead of any other accommodation option. During our every morning coffee ceremony she shared with me lots of insights of living in Seattle and helped me to feel the city vibe. Also the laminated map of the city beats any one I bought on the Market hands down, especially when it was drizzling :)

More formal:
- Quiet neighborhood
- Lots of parking (free, no sweeping days)
- Easy commute to downtown, Green Lake, UW
- Warm cozy room where you fall asleep immediately 
- Neat bathroom and shower
- Large patio
- Huge airy windows in the dining room
- Great host"
4030600,23905422,2014-12-14,3285646,Sarah,"The neighborhood is fantastic. It's really near a ton of stuff, including the bus line to get to downtown. The houses are all well maintained and particularly festive this time of year. 

Miesha is a fantastic host, the house is lovely and the room is extremely comfortable. Overall I had a blast, and I can't recommend it enough for anyone else looking to stay up in Seattle. "
4030600,23986591,2014-12-15,24797215,Dan,"Miesha is an amazing host. Besides having a beautiful home with a comfortable bedroom, she was attentive to make sure that every detail worked perfectly for her guest. In fact,  I was offered a delicious soup on the day of my arrival.  I feel very luck to have had such a great first experience with airbnb and I definitely recommend Miesha."
4030600,25423863,2015-01-15,1125196,Paul,"Staying with Miesha was very relaxing and comforting. She provided coffee in the mornings and even offered to shop for food when she was at a grocery store. She invited me to watch a football game on TV with her friends and eat chili. It is within walking distance to the 71 bus stop to the U-District. The house was beautifully spacious and well-furnished, had lots of natural light, and the room was warm and comfortable. Her adorable daughter was also fun to play with. I would definitely recommend staying here."
4030600,25725460,2015-01-24,12396101,Juan,Miesha's place was really nice. She went above and beyond to make us feel comfortable and relax at her place. We would definitely recommend this to anyone planning to visit Seattle.
4030600,26755262,2015-02-18,22106331,Li,"The stay at Miesha's was great! She was incredibly nice and helpful, by giving us directions to the bus stop (btw, it's only 2 minutes walk away) and even providing us with free bus ride coupons. The room is very cozy, and the rest of the house is very spacious and bright. The neighborhood is quiet and has ample street parking. It's easy to get to University Village where there is dining, shopping, etc. Definitely recommend staying here!"
4030600,27111991,2015-02-25,5894986,Brian,"Miesha's place is in a great neighborhood in Seattle, with loads of amenities nearby. The room is exactly as described and super comfy and clean. 

 "
4030600,27666772,2015-03-09,26973990,Cyra,"The thoughtful Miesha welcomed me with entirely the hospitality I had hoped for: a posy on the bureau of a room with lots of plugs and hangers and pillows and a window looking into the garden by day, over a full moon by night. Heat controls in both bedroom and bath, plenty of hot water in shower and cup, a neighborhood walkable, interesting and useful."
4030600,28664342,2015-03-28,14339724,Julie,Miesha's location was perfect for me!  I come to Seattle often to visit our sons and grandsons...The room and bathroom were perfect.  It couldn't have been any more convenient.  Miesha was very accommodating!

4030600,29517241,2015-04-08,29408367,瀚廣,"Meisha is really nice and thoughtful. She gave us the password of the door on the day of our arrival. The downtown bus stop is 10 min walk away and comes every 30 minutes. It takes another 20 minutes to the downtown by bus. If you plan to stay at Meisha's place, yoy can either plan to leave earlier or rent a car. Parking is free.
Guest room is cozy and has nice view. You can enjoy separate bath room. Washing and drying machines are in the basement. Doing laundry is easy and convenient.
Cat is fat and cute,  and she is not permitted to enter guest room.
Meisha loves organic food,  so you can enjoy healthy breakfast every morning^^"

The room was fine, the bed super comfortable, the bathroom spacious and clean, and the coffee in the morning delicious! The neighborhood is beautiful and quite, and the bus line really convenient for both downtown Seattle and the UW-district.  I would definitely stay at Miesha’s place again. Many thanks to Miesha and to her wonderful family!!

4030600,32564683,2015-05-19,30620728,Eunice,整體環境讓人覺得舒服，乾凈。房東是個很體貼的人，會站在房客的角度思考。唯一可惜的是這次旅行沒遇到房東，但那並不影響整個旅行的氛圍，希望下次有機會可以見面。
4030600,32797223,2015-05-21,13711002,Alexa,It was very nice of Miesha to accept my booking request the very same day. She was duper attentive to all of my concerns about the booking. The check-in and check-out process was easy breezy. You would be happy with how nice and clean the room is. I definitely recommend staying here. 
4030600,33036233,2015-05-24,30131248,Xiaqing,"This is our first experience with airbnb, and its great! Miesha was an 5 star host. The guest room on the first floor and the bathroom were super clean. Even the towels provided in the bathroom feels good. We stayed for three nights and every morning there's hot coffee and breakfast bars waiting for us on the counter. The shower was nice also, with the right amount of pressure. Overall the neighborhood was beautiful, convenient and quiet, and the guest room and the house was exactly the way we expected. Parking was very easy. We had very good time there and definitely would come back if possible in the future. Thanks, Miesha."

Miesha provided a wonderful guide to the surrounding area and to Seattle at large.  She gave us a tour of the home and a warm welcome upon our arrival.  The neighborhood is beautiful and convenient to several excellent restaurants, as well as to the University of Washington campus.  It was a lot of fun staying, privately in her family's guest room, but feeling welcome within their home."
4030600,33752725,2015-05-31,24587652,Parisa,"Miesha was an amazing host, she left us snacks and made coffee for us in the morning and even made us breakfast and we joined them for dinner one night. It was really nice being in a homely environment after travelling for so long.
The room was really great, and the bathroom was super clean. 
I would definitely recommend staying with Miesha and her family :)"

Meisha was prompt to respond to my request and let me know everything I needed to access the room. The house was clean and the kitty was taken care of by the neighbor. The amenities and the finishes of the home are beautiful and  inviting I was so comfortable from the moment I got in.. Everything from the plush queen bed, to the bathroom and kitchen stocked with Trader Joe's foodstuffs and toiletries. The house is very close to a bus-stop to access downtown Seattle. After several months of my travelling through densely populous regions, the calmness of the home and pleasant neighborhood were a very nice change of pace. Once they family got back, we shared a dinner together and lovely conversation. They made me feel most welcome. Thank you Meisha and family!"

The big back porch was perfect for catching up with some friends.  The book of instructions, rules, and tips was really nice.  A great place to stay in Seattle."
3971346,19558181,2014-09-14,20608774,Dominic,Derek was very prompt with his responses and willing to go the extra mile to make us feel welcome.  The home was just as described and wonderful.  We really appreciated the deck and the view.  It's very private and quite as well.

It really is pretty and beautifully appointed. We were invited to help ourselves to wine in the fridge, etc. It's a really gorgeous space, and we were very at home. Being able to bring my old dog was a huge plus as well. "
3971346,20776892,2014-10-05,12126461,Jody,We had a great time at Derek's place.  We were a group of 6 and there was plenty of room.  The accommodations were comfortable. The neighborhood was quiet and there was plenty of parking.  Everything was as stated in the description.  The house was modern and clean.  We were able to enjoy the beautiful deck overlooking the private yard and fresh veggies from the garden. Derek was easy to communicate with and very gracious.  We had fresh honey waiting for us upon our arrival which was a nice treat.  I would stay at Derek's again if I had the opportunity.
3971346,22639312,2014-11-10,21838870,Ke,"Derek was quick in reply. The house is close to downtown, 12mins drive. Quite neighborhood, big trees. Interior is new. Rooms is ok if you are not sensible to pets.  "
3971346,23183700,2014-11-24,6638957,Cara,"Derek's home was beautiful, clean and nicely situated 5 minutes from Ballard and 10 minutes from downtown. If you're driving there is plenty of parking on the street in front of the house and there's also a bus route 1 block away. Derek was quick to respond to inquiries and really helpful, even with a booking issue I was having with the Airbnb app."
3971346,24474930,2014-12-29,23520953,Alan,"Derek's house was all set for us with clean linens on the beds, fresh towels, a well-equipped kitchen, and even wood in the fireplace. His demeanor was welcoming and comfortable. We will be back!"
3971346,27279267,2015-03-01,13077155,Susan,"Wonderful experience!  I would definitely recommend Derek's place to friends and family. 
The house is spacious, comfortable, and clean. We had plenty of room for seven people and we were glad to be able to include our little chihuahua for this visit. The deck and yard are great - some areas with great views, while other areas feel very secluded and cozy. 
Derek is a gracious host. Cheese and crackers were a complimentary and welcomed snack as we settled in. We also loved the gourmet s'mores! 
We appreciated Derek's thoughtfulness and generosity."
3971346,28169757,2015-03-19,13452727,John,"Derek wasn't around when we were there, but he left us some great tips in a notebook on the counter. The place was really clean, awesome location, beautiful back yard. We had a great time!"
3971346,28560376,2015-03-26,26922251,Charlene,"Derek's house was great. I loved the open feel of the house and wish we could have come at another time of the year when the weather was warmer so we could have enjoyed the deck in the backyard.  Derek was open to letting our dogs come, which was a bonus for us. They had plenty of room to roam in the backyard, and plenty of space to lounge out in the living room. Great space, great view. Thanks. "
3971346,29244203,2015-04-05,5555705,Tri,"Derek was very responsive which helped for our last minute booking (less than 24 hours in advance).  Great house, clean and spacious for our 3 younger kids. Located in the less-busy neighborhood of Magnolia which made getting around very easy (with a car). I was worried about the railyard nearby but there was very minimal noise only one of the nights.

While Derek wasn't here when we visited, he left a notebook full of tips for places to go and eat in the neighborhood.  He was also gracious in letting us charge our EV while visiting."
3971346,29589437,2015-04-09,10468087,Neha,"The house is a gem in a wonderful neighborhood. Derek has all of the amenities to make it comfortable, except a hair dryer. My family and I loved it!"

Derek made sure the house ready and well equipped with necessity including linens, toiletries, kitchen supplies etc. The house are clean, homey yet spacious. Open floor plan allowed 7 of us to hang out and spend time together as a family in one place!  The location is convenient to check out popular spots in Seattle. Overall, we had a good time and thanks Derek for your hospitality!"
3971346,30527970,2015-04-23,5484238,Lisa,"The house was fantastic, beautiful gardens and great balance of cozy and cool.  The neighborhood was super cute, and just 15 minutes to downtown without traffic.  Derek responded very quickly and throughly and all was exactly as he had indicated.  We'll be my 1st choice for future Seattle trips.  "
3971346,31544263,2015-05-06,3484556,Sadie,Great stay! Magnolia is quiet but also close to Ballard where we enjoyed our time. The backyard was beautiful. House was clean and it worked well for us and our 1 yr old daughter and small dog. 
3971346,33104293,2015-05-25,5465360,Guinevere,Our family had a great stay in Derek's home.

We would definitely recommend this house to anyone. Thanks Derek! 
3971346,33433526,2015-05-28,9170681,Claire,Derek's house was perfect for a relaxing vacation with friends. The deck was my favorite part and it was close to downtown... But not too close and we wanted an escape. Derek was the best host 
3971346,34470651,2015-06-08,33755559,Andrew,"Derek made us feel unbelievably welcome!  I was with contemporary ballet dancers, and he offered his massage services at a discount rate, offered to cook us dinner if we were so inclined, and the place was immaculate when we got there!!  The house is the perfect spot to feel close to the city, but also feel like you have enough room and quiet to relax.  The neighborhood is mellow, and the yard is incredible.  The strawberries in the front portion of the garden are ridiculously delicious.  We will definitely request Derek's In City 50's Modern Urban house next time around!:)  
Thanks So Much Derek,
Andrew"
3971346,34931242,2015-06-14,1010413,Anne," Derek left a note which made us feel welcome and relaxed. The house was clean and well set up. Great location; 10 minutes to downtown, easy access to many local parks and other attractions.  Very quiet neighborhood with minimal road noise. Having access to the garden and the fire pit was awesome. Large, well equipped and stocked kitchen is a plus - we were there with a family of five and mainly ate in - the deck was a great place for meals and conversation.  House layout allows plenty of personal space and also common areas. 
Highly recommend.  Expect to be back in 2016. "

3971346,40581596,2015-08-01,33143062,Gina,"Great house in beautiful neighborhood! Super clean with awesome outside space and huge deck. Close to bus stop, so getting downtown is easy. Other things (restaurants, groceries) are walkable; just be ready for hills. Derek was a good host - very helpful and friendly! We loved our short stay and highly recommend. "
3971346,41188096,2015-08-05,17798779,Lesley,We had a great experience in Derek's house. It was very clean and pleasant and had an overall good vibe. The three bedrooms were very comfortable. Terrific beds. Very nicely renovated bathrooms. Magnolia is a super sweet neighborhood with amazing vistas of Seattle and plenty of Coffee shops with easy driving access to downtown.

3971346,42823200,2015-08-16,23520953,Alan,"Derek is a very gracious host. In our second visit, we got to know the nearby Fremont, Ballard, and Magnolia neighborhoods better. Derek's house in in a great location, an easy $10 Uber ride to Seattle Center (much easier than lolling, then paying, for parking). I highly recommend both Derek and his home."
3971346,43909126,2015-08-23,4994246,Ignacio,"Eventhough the house from the outside looks like a little ""jungle"" the house was great. 
Derek didnt meet us at the check in but it was easy to get in and he was helpful with the information we needed.
The neighbourhood is very quiet and lovely.
Easy to park on the street and very close to a bus stop wich takes about 20min to downtown.
We would highly recommend it and defenetly would stay here again."
3971346,44917139,2015-08-30,23116824,Layne,We had such an awesome stay! We look forward to coming back on Thursday!
3971346,45942533,2015-09-07,23116824,Layne,"Derek was great.  He was available before and throughout our booking.  We did not have a single issue.  His home is lovely and close to transit.  Various neighbors in the neighborhood gave us helpful advice and even offered an umbrella during a downpour.  As described there is a small yappy dog next door, but never a problem."
3971346,46716668,2015-09-13,37952511,Tiffini,"Derek was very easy to work with and was responsive all the way through the experience. His home is a sweet retreat in a charming Seattle neighborhood. His large deck, awesome shower, fun record collection and generous hospitality made our stay memorable. If we ever need a place to stay in the Seattle area again, I would definitely try to stay at Derek's!"
3971346,47864246,2015-09-21,42808651,Paul,"Derek was a great host! We were able to book him last minute and he was very accommodating for our group, even though we had a party bigger than the listing. He made his house really feel like home away from home. Definitely reaching out to him again on my next trip out to Seattle.  "
3971346,49439090,2015-10-04,20608774,Dominic,This was our 2nd stay!  We love the house and the location.  We'll be back!
3971346,55186505,2015-11-29,5317585,Leslie,"Derek has a wonderful house that we felt so at home in. We were made to feel welcome and so were our two dogs. The house has a great deck overlooking the spacious fenced back yard with views of the city lights. 
Derek is so generous with his space and all that he provides. It is such a lovely open floor plan for gathering and for foodies that like to cook and share meals together. The kitchen is well equipped, big comfy sofa and beautiful large dining table. 
It was easy to sort trash from recycling and compost with the info posted on the side of the fridge. The house is in a sweet part of Magnolia, near parks, a dog park and the village. 
There was ease in every aspect of this booking. We loved our stay and will definitely be back!"
3971346,55911908,2015-12-07,5628414,Lisa,"Derek was a great host. He was generous with his record collection , food and bar. That creates such a homey vibe in the house! It made me want to be extra respectful of his things. And he was so thoughtful by allowing our 2 dogs and providing doggie beds and food bowls.  I only wish he told me where to put the recycling and garbage. "
4278896,21568663,2014-10-19,17020198,Frank,"I really appreciated my stay with Allison! This was first time sharing someone's apartment and was concerned it might be awkward... However, I found the experience to be totally relaxed and enjoyable. Allison was very prompt in responding to my questions and arrangements for gaining access to her place were totally easy! Her flat is very spacious, light and clean which definitely made my stay very comfortable. I would absolutely recommend staying with her! "
4278896,21804147,2014-10-24,8261293,Jill,"I had a fantastic stay with Allison and will absolutely be booking with her again the next time I am in the Seattle area! Communication leading up to my stay was great. Her condo was even more colorful, cozy, and tidy than in the photos. Allison was in and out of her place during the day and studied at night which allowed for a quiet and pleasant atmosphere for me to get some work done in the evenings."
4278896,22567421,2014-11-09,23340705,Jennifer,"Allison is kind and gracious, made me feel very welcome. The neighborhood is quiet and super convenient to Seattle Children's Hospital, Husky Stadium and U.Village. The room is perfectly appointed and a truly comfortable bed! I highly recommend!! Thank you Allison."
4278896,22921069,2014-11-17,1601502,Cynthia,"Allison's apartment is conveniently located, sunny, very clean, cozy,
and warm. I would not bring a pet here. She keeps her place immaculate. She was friendly and kept me informed as I journeyed to Seattle, and as I returned to my home. Just right for the weekend and so easy to get to the University of Washington, Children's Hospital, and Talaris Conference Center.  Really recommend her spare bedroom and modern bath.  Thanks, Allison"
4278896,23788183,2014-12-10,23071878,Lars,"Allison was a delightful host.  The room and bathroom were comfortable and clean.  The location is very convenient, located near a grocery store, coffee shop, and Chinese restaurant.  It is also along bus lines.  The pictures are very accurate.  I would definitely stay with Allison again. "
4278896,24411365,2014-12-28,18673136,Don,"Allison made us feel like her home was truly our home away from home.  Her place was immaculate and most convenient for our stay.   She is located in a great residential neighborhood (Laurelhurst) and we were only a short distance from our son's home.  While she wasn't there during our stay, she left great directions on use of her home and the added benefit of a carport.  We loved staying in her place as we were visiting during the Christmas holiday and it was a nice, quiet refuge for us.  Located close to shopping, the University of Washington, Seattle Children's Hospital, and some great restaurants, her place is ideally situated. We would highly recommend her place to anyone visiting in the UW area of Seattle.  "
4278896,25148544,2015-01-07,17849624,Ronnie,"I was in Seattle to interview at Children's, and I couldn't have picked a better place to stay than Allison's home. The guest room and bathroom were huge, immaculate, and incredible welcoming. There is an awesome electric fireplace in the living room. Allison was a perfect host. She responded to all my texts quickly and thoroughly. It was a 4 min walk to Children's. Absolutely zero things went wrong during my stay. I would not hesitate for a second to recommend her home to anyone."
4278896,26226592,2015-02-07,26758120,Julene,"Allison was a great host and the room was wonderful. Just 7 houses down from Seattle Children's Hospital made it a perfect place to be while my daughter was inpatient. The bed was super comfy, nice bathroom and very comfortable house. Quiet, wifi, private tv, access to kitchen and living area and was everything I wanted. I was able to come and go as I needed and felt welcome my entire stay. I will definitely be staying there again when I'm in the area. Will recommend to anyone!"
4278896,27893979,2015-03-14,28510117,Neil,"Nice clean bedroom and a super private bathroom, plenty of on street parking as well as a wonderful host...how can you go wrong"
4278896,29139562,2015-04-04,10132034,Ramani,"Allison is a very busy and organized professional who's gotten her hosting down pat.  She has printouts that contain everything you need to know about her apartment--how to operate the fireplace and Keurig coffee maker, for instance.  Her space is wonderful--large and roomy with a skylight in your bath.  It feels more like a family room in a house than an apartment and is filled with folk art collected during Allison's travels around the world.  You can take the bus (or even walk) to University Village and take express buses from the university to downtown.  Try it, you'll like it!"
4278896,30041913,2015-04-16,3169089,Arvind,"I stayed at Allison's place for eight days and it was fantastic. First, the room was specious and bathroom was clean, big and well lit with skylights. I had a TV in my room, though I didn't use that. Kitchen and living areas were clean, big and very comfortable. Location of the apartment is very good. It is right on the bus route and very easy to get to University.
I had many wonderful conversations with Allison. I would strongly recommend this place to all my friends."

4278896,31255524,2015-05-03,31944695,William,"A clean, well-decorated private room with a great well-lit private bath. Our schedules didn't allow for much interaction over the weekend, and I hardly knew it the times she was at home. Very welcoming host with clear guidelines and instructions for the available facilities. It is a modern and well-kept apartment in a quiet residential neighborhood. Easy parking on the street in front. Near University of Washington, with University Village shopping center close by. I would return without a second thought. Thanks!"
4278896,31650942,2015-05-08,30801300,Gerard,"This is my first ever bnb experience and it was amazing. The place is located in a beautiful and quiet neighborhood. Allison was very hospitable during the stay. She provided information about the neighborhood, which greatly helped during my stay. Everything was well communicated. The place is as described and as shown in the photos. "

The location is excellent for anyone visiting the University of Washington or nearby children's hospital. The trail is just across the street and bus stops are nearby. Allison is well-traveled and can also provide good recommendations for things to do locally, such as hiking at Discovery Park, which I highly recommend. She is easy to talk to, while mindful of her guests' time and her own. Overall, this was an excellent experience!"
4278896,34693592,2015-06-11,27978070,Daniel,"Allison was a perfect host. We were made to feel like new friends, and invited to use the spacious seating areas and kitchen. The apartment was cheery and clean, and the peaceful neighborhood as described. Parking was a snap. The room and bath were clean. we were a short walk from a nice breakfast place. Only negative was the bed; it was a little too small for the two of us. Otherwise, everything was top-notch."
4278896,35823307,2015-06-22,2777206,Teresa,"Allison was a great host and has a lovely home.  
She was incredibly accommodating to our schedule and organized which was very much appreciated. Allison is great to interact with!

The bed and bathroom were very clean and spacious. The rest of the apartment is well decorated, inviting, and clean. The location is in a quiet neighborhood that is easily connected to the University of Washington and other areas of Seattle. The room gets some of the car/bus noise from the major street the apartment is on, it's not very loud but something to keep in mind if you are very sensitive to noise. Parking was very easy and the house is close to a few major bus lines.
I'd recommend this listing to anyone looking to visit and explore Seattle."

It worked perfectly for my visit to do a workshop at the Center for Spiritual Living  just 1 mile away.  A coffee shop and restaurant as well as some shops very close by!  Thank you!  I would visit you again if the opportunity came up! Helen
4278896,38712430,2015-07-18,15501244,Robin,"Allison was a very welcoming host! The apartment was clean and her instructions easy to follow to find the house and to get acquainted with everything. She is a very chill and friendly lady that sticks to herself, giving you as much privacy as you need but is very fun to talk to. 

 It is very conveniently located next to an amazing bike trail and bus stop, it made the morning commute to UW between 15 and 20 minutes. I opted to walk the 2.5 miles back almost every day. I had a long stay and she had no problems letting me use her kitchen, laundry room and fridge for a few things. 
The house is next to a very busy street, so if you are super sensitive to road noise this may not work for you. I can't say that it kept me up at night. There is shopping about a mile down the hill and several restaurants within the half mile. I would easily stay here again. "
4278896,39789550,2015-07-26,35150342,Rachel,Really lovely property. Easy access to the university and Lake Washington. Allison is a great host with lots of ideas and suggestions to make your trip to Seattle different. Highly recommend.
4278896,40270509,2015-07-29,30400578,Elisabeth,"The room, apartment and surrounding area are as described and shown in photographs. Even though our paths only crossed when I first arrived, Allison was pleasant, helpful, and easily reachable by phone/email. I would recommend staying here!"
4278896,40781921,2015-08-02,37440287,Maria,Our stay was pleasant even though we spent little time in the apartment. 
4278896,41783469,2015-08-09,35677473,Scott,"My girlfriend and I did not get to meet Allison until the third day of our stay because of our conflicting schedules, but she was very welcoming when we finally did. Allison was very sweet about everything! She left many brochures in our room in case we didn't know our way around, as well as very clear instructions/rules that should be followed. The place was as advertised and was very clean when we got there. The neighbourhood is extremely safe and we felt very comfortable there. There is a Safeway ~3 minutes drive from the place, which was very convenient. 10/10 would recommend and stay again!"
4278896,42546953,2015-08-14,35662243,LauraLee,The listing is exactly as described and the location is perfect for access to the university. Allison was a great host and we had a wonderful stay.
4278896,44569856,2015-08-27,40506794,Michael,"Nice apartment, well appointed, beautiful global decor, and everything in place. Allison's and my schedules didn't overlap much, so I only met her once, but she had everything set up and instructions in place so that I could come as go as I pleased. "
4278896,44918947,2015-08-30,29992050,William,Great place to stay in an excellent location. Allison was a very helpful and accommodating host. The neighborhood is lovely and convenient to the university and parks. Everything was very clean and just as advertised. Would be happy to stay there again when in Seattle.
4278896,48879158,2015-09-29,8315021,Marsha,My host told me to make myself at home in the apartment and to feel free to use the kitchen and washer and dryer if need be. The neighbor hood was nice and quiet and just off the campus of the University of Washington.
4278896,51124127,2015-10-18,40232451,Tina,"This was our first Airbnb experience.  Alison was the sweetest host and provided a clean, comfortable and relaxing environment.  Our daughter was at Children's Hospital so the location of the apt. was perfect!  "
4278896,52628241,2015-10-31,46541563,Kaitlin,"Great space, clean, welcoming. Great location with easy access to the rest of Seattle."
4278896,53851223,2015-11-13,48277171,Natalie,"Allison was a wonderful host! The apartment and room were beautifully kept and very comfortable. The bedroom and bathroom are in their own hallway which adds an element of privacy. I was in town for an interview at the children's hospital was able to walk there in about 2 minutes. I briefly met Allison and she was very lovely and accommodating, even when I had to call her at 1am to find my way to her place! If you're in the area I would definitely recommend staying at her home!"
6707735,34610997,2015-06-09,2335112,Natalie,"STAY HERE! Carolyn and Jason were perfectly FABULOUS! Pretty sure they're the kind of hosts that will let you dictate the level of personal interaction you're most comfortable with.  They've struck the perfect balance between giving their guests space and privacy while at the same time being incredibly  accommodating, responsive and easy to communicate with. I booked last minute and they had the place ready within hours. I loved the space- it was stylishly decorated, comfortable and very conveniently located. Right next to a park and walking distance to all the amenities that Wallingford has to offer.
I was traveling with my toddler, and when I was trying to check out, I realized my cellphone was missing. While frantically searching for my cellphone, Jason was kind enough to call it for me and a man answered saying he'd found it in the street. So, while I tended to my toddlers needs he DROVE TO PICK MY PHONE UP FOR ME!!! Not only were they amazing hosts, the space was perfect. I'll definitely stay there again and highly recommend it to anyone. "
6707735,34826494,2015-06-12,7606602,Heidi,James and Carolyn were lovely and gracious hosts. They even came back early to let us in and volunteered to help with luggage. 
6707735,35031359,2015-06-14,11076939,Allanah,"Though my boyfriend and I did not get a chance to meet Carolyn & James in person, the basement apartment was so comfortable and charming we felt we got a good sense of their personalities. 
There was great art on the walls, a wonderful book collection and fresh eggs from their yard hens in the fridge! (Along with a sweet note to please enjoy.) My bf & I were completely charmed and we hope to return and stay longer.
The apt was clean, neat and hospitable. The table was set and there were all the dishes, pots, pans and silverware we could have possibly needed. Carolyn responded quickly and efficiently and the check-in & out process was a breeze.
The apartment is in a great neighborhood called Wallingford that is nearby tons of options for food, coffee, movies, groceries, chocolate, sushi, you name it! Yet, it still has a clean, small-town feel to it. 
Great neighborhood, stylish spot, perfect hosts and right price!"
6707735,35161133,2015-06-15,17000056,Garland,"Charming doesn't do this apartment justice.  So cozy...artsy...super quiet neighborhood in the heart of Wallingford.  Very close to everything you could imagine....and....a magical gift of eggs from their very own hens were waiting for us in the fridge.   Bed was very comfortable....great nights sleep after a busy day in Seattle.  Very quiet....cute kitchen.....darling breakfast nook....just the right size for us.   I will come back again for sure! 
"
6707735,35595217,2015-06-20,21064669,Lauren,"My in-laws came to town and needed a place to stay, but here is their review:
Carolyn and James were such great hosts for us! When we needed to stay an extra night Carolyn was more than accommodating. It was a great first airbnb experience for us! There was coffee, tea, fresh eggs, fresh towels. Carolyn checked in with us via airbnb to make sure we had everything we needed and respected our privacy. Their home was beautiful and they have a beautiful dog and cat! We would love to stay again and will definitely be booking with them when we come to sSeattle next.
"
6707735,36075119,2015-06-24,17824338,Georgia,"I really enjoyed your cool place, and also your prompt response, thank you for wonderful stay."
6707735,36139061,2015-06-25,22590354,Greg,"Upon arriving I met James and was shown around the property to the basement apartment. Inside James and Carolyn had left a handwritten note welcoming me and my dog. Along with the note they also left some eggs in the fridge that were from their very own chickens. You can really tell they care about their guests and want to provide a welcoming environment. 

The apartment was furnished well and I really enjoyed the decorative art around the place. After speaking a bit with James I believe everything was either made by him or second hand, which is really cool. Their entire garden is comprised of all second hand plants that he saved from the brink of death. I really enjoyed my stay and appreciate their hospitality."
6707735,36578237,2015-06-29,34698393,Susan,"I love James and Carolyn's basement apartment! Check in/check out was a breeze.  The space is inviting and homey plus, bed is comfortable, neighborhood is lovely, and includes parking.  Next time I'm in the Seattle area, i will be checking their availability.  "
6707735,36809849,2015-07-01,32471269,Anthony,"Carolyn and James are very considerate hosts and I had an excellent stay. The space was clean and welcoming, with a very thoughtful spread of everyday things you might need on a trip out of town.  The entrance was private as was check in and check out. I definitely recommend staying. "
6707735,37201408,2015-07-05,1295300,Monica,"Host stayed in contact with me, I texted our arrival time and got great directions to the place. Great hosts. 
Accurate description. Great location. really great location! Quiet street, parking, walking to shops, restaurants. Next to parc. Farmer's market on Tuesday afternoon.
Apartment is spacious, pleasant, well furnished and outfitted.
"
6707735,37671870,2015-07-09,24807660,Ruby,"We loved our stay in Carolyn and James' home! The apartment was clean and comfortable with all the amenities we needed for our four-night stay in Seattle. Despite the unusual heat in Seattle, the basement apartment was very cool. Though we didn't see Carolyn or James during our stay they left us sparklers to celebrate the 4th of July and fresh eggs from their chickens. "
6707735,37769871,2015-07-10,5077693,Simone,"Carolyn & James were lovely! We arrived in Seattle early and they were kind enough to clean the apartment so we could drop our dog off early.

The apartment was incredibly clean, cute, and charming. We enjoyed the neighborhood and all of the wonderful shops/restaurants nearby.

Carolyn was even kind enough to email us some fantastic suggestions of places to eat and see while were in Seattle. Not to mention the farm-fresh eggs in the fridge. Fabulous!

We will definitely be staying there again in the future when we visit Seattle."
6707735,37999390,2015-07-12,35329751,Michael,I had a great experience! They accommodated my bike and let me bring my stuff over a little bit early. I'd happily stay there again if I ever come back to Seattle.
6707735,38295413,2015-07-14,4505495,Nina,We loved staying here and would highly recommend it. A great atmosphere and happy vibes permeating the home! The neighborhood was just what we were looking for and we had a great time!
6707735,38412179,2015-07-15,16885482,Michael,"We only talked to Carolyn and James once on our trip and they were very friendly. The basement we stayed in felt more like a home with its own entrance, a clean kitchen, bathroom, and separate bedroom. There was a ton to do in the area even though the house was tucked away on a quiet residential street. James was nice enough to point out a cool bar for us to go to just around the block. We'd definitely stay here again and would recommend Carolyn and James' home to anybody."
6707735,39188750,2015-07-21,36006589,Michael,"Carolyn and James were incredible hosts! The apartment itself is remarkable, and they went above and beyond to make us feel comfortable and help us with whatever we needed.  Their place is in a great residential area of Wallingford. Coffee shops, a supermarket, restaurants- all are only a few blocks away, but nonetheless at night the neighborhood is quiet as a mouse. Bus stop is three minutes' walk away. Amble down the driveway and look along the street and you're staring smack at downtown- a wonderful sight at night! If you're staying in Seattle, stay here- you won't regret it. Plus, you get to make fresh eggs for breakfast in the cute kitchen from their own chickens. How cool is that? "
6707735,39950682,2015-07-27,35589689,Christopher,"The apartment was exactly as advertised. The added touches of personality from James and Carolyn really made for a unique stay such as fresh eggs from their chickens and their own artwork. The kitchen was well equipped. I have stayed in many vacation rentals and typically the cookware is extremely cheap and worn out. That was not the case here. The neighborhood is excellent with many restaurants, bars, coffee shops, and a grocery store all within a few blocks. Carolyn and James were attentive during our stay without being intrusive. I would recommend to anyone looking for a place to stay in north Seattle."
6707735,40157114,2015-07-28,8540956,Joe,"Carolyn and James were easy to work with and very accommodating.  Their home is in an interesting and pedestrian friendly neighborhood.  The apartment was basic but cozy, comfortable and private. "

6707735,40527072,2015-07-31,16178685,Caitlin,"Carolyn and James were wonderful hosts! The basement apartment is cozy and cute, and Ruby the dog is even more magnificent in person. The bed is super comfy, and the hosts were totally accommodating (there were even fresh home-raised eggs in the fridge!) -- we'll definitely stay here again on our next trip to Seattle. Thanks again!"
6707735,40661395,2015-08-01,38497213,Janelle,"This apartment is in a cute neighborhood. The decor is unique and adorable. Carolyn & James made sure to contact me prior to check-in regarding key location. And they left fresh eggs in the fridge! My stay was short so I didn't get to meet the hosts, but we enjoyed the apartment. I would definitely recommend this location!"
6707735,41670186,2015-08-08,23005509,Lene,"Apartment is very comfortable and fun. We had everything we needed, and the location is fantastic. Just a short uber ride away from everything you want to see in Seattle, and located in a really cute fun neighborhood to explore right outside your door. Would definitely book here again, thank you Carolyn for your hospitality. Boyfriend loved the chickens! "
6707735,43071899,2015-08-17,37367630,Christa,"Communication was fast and easy, and the location was fantastic - quiet neighbourhood, but so close to the I-5 and our friends' wedding venue!

Great space, comfy bed and couch for lounging, colourful and funky with lots to look at while we enjoyed the fresh eggs for breakfast - fresh flowers on the table were glorious too!

Extra care and attention throughout (while very much giving us privacy, perfect for us introverts!) spoiled us. Future Airbnb hosts will have a lot to live up to, after this great experience with Carolyn and James!"
6707735,43403357,2015-08-19,9752206,Matt,"This was one of the best Airbnb experiences I've ever had. The neighborhood was quiet and beautiful, the apartment was super convenient, comfortable, and clean. Our hosts were extremely responsive and friendly, making the trip a breeze! I would go back to Seattle just to stay at this apartment again!!"
6707735,43593641,2015-08-20,34722595,Kim,"This was mine and my husbands first experience with Airbnb. We were very happy with Carolyn and James basement apartment, it is exactly how you see it on the website. The apartment had a bit of a musty odour to it and there wasn't enough toilet paper in the bathroom. That being said, the apartment was very clean and the fresh eggs for breakfast were lovely and very much appreciated. Great neighborhood and close enough to downtown in a Uber taxi."
6707735,44338806,2015-08-25,5727747,Erika,The neighborhood is very charming.  Nice to walk to coffee and the store.  Kitchen is nice with welcoming touches.
6707735,44529095,2015-08-27,35171861,Donna,"This was our first airbnb experience. Communications with Carolyn before our arrival were clear and easy. We loved the basement apt that was creatively furnished with comfort, whimsy and a great sense of humor! Two place settings at the dining nook  and fresh eggs from their chickens in the fridge were an especially nice touch. The location could not be better. This is a great neighborhood in Seattle. We would definitely book this apt again and will recommend it to friends.  Oh--comfy bed too!"
6707735,44715849,2015-08-28,6469654,Julie,Bill was happy with the apartment.  It was really close to the school he was working with and he loved the neighborhood.  Will be back.
6707735,44831695,2015-08-29,16781715,Karina,"Lovely colourful basement suite in the Wallingdon area, around the corner from a small park - and with chicken's eggs in the fridge, fresh from the coop in the owners backyard!  Great welcome from Carolyn, with some useful tips on what's in the area.   Little taco place a couple of blocks away did some great take-out so we could dine in our kitchen nook, where the table was laid for a romantic dinner, complete with cloth napkins.   Fab home from home -  completely recommend.  Decorated with a confident artistic touch.  Very relaxing suite.  And nice and cool in the hot weather Seattle's just had.  "
6707735,45117411,2015-08-31,37131068,Aundra,We loved it and didn't want to leave as soon as we pulled up to the neighborhood.  Very friendly neighbors and great hosts.  The home is taken care of with love and you can feel it when you enter.  Exactly as the pictures show.  Loved talking to their dog (very calm dog) and having our chicken eggs in the morning.  Walking distance to many great stores and restaurants as well.
6707735,45613388,2015-09-04,42400461,April,"This is a lovely hidden gem in the Wallingford neighborhood.   A few minutes walk to good eats, quaint shops, and a grocery. The basement apartment suite is private and clean.  Carolyn and James have thought of everything!  There were fresh eggs in the fridge and a full assortment of teas.  The outdoor patio is perfect for enjoying the weather and catching up on some reading.  They were sure to check in on me and brought fresh towels down.  I will stay again the next time I'm in Seattle.   It's Perfect!"
6707735,45685103,2015-09-05,22022230,Claire,This basement apartment is in a lovely neighborhood. There is an entrance to a beautiful park at the end of the cul de sac that I highly recommend any other guests visit.

6707735,47106342,2015-09-15,41768910,Steve,Awesome. We met James and he was very friendly. I also think we me most of the neighbors on the street who were also great. Nice little basement apartment in a great neighborhood. I think we found our go to in Seattle when visiting with the pooches.
6707735,47404757,2015-09-18,4983199,Brighid,It was a great location and very charming indeed! Cozy basement apartment true to the description and rave reviews. I'd definitely stay again!

6707735,49812899,2015-10-06,32154182,Katie,We had a great time staying at Carolyn's basement apartment. It was the perfect place to stay while we waiting to move into our apartment. Communication was great we always had what we needed. Plus the fresh eggs were delicious. 
6707735,51489427,2015-10-20,24980026,Emily,Carolyn and James were awesome. Their place was awesome. Neighborhood is quiet and great. Fresh eggs in the fridge! They welcomed me and my puppy on late notice and didn't even mind his puppy-ish whining when I left the house (though I'm sure they would have preferred him whine free). Great place and great hosts!
6707735,53392189,2015-11-08,15153768,Calvin,"Lovely and quirky art filled space centrally located in a quiet residential neighborhood in Wallingford. Carolyn and James' place is beautiful and well kept. Fresh eggs from their chickens in the fridge! They responded to requests promptly.

We enjoyed walking up and down the main drag of 45th street, which has a really chill college vibe. "

The hosts made sure I got in okay, and ensured if I needed anything to just give them a call. I absolutely loved the art as well. My preschooler thought they were pretty rad he even took one to school for show & tell. Would definitely book again"
6707735,55375638,2015-12-01,7309775,Jessica,"Carolyn and James' apartment was the perfect place for us to spend our long Thanksgiving weekend.

Both the apartment and the hosts were warm as could be. we would definitely stay here again!
"

The neighborhood was a bit quieter and cozier than we expected so we felt we had to be quieter than usual hanging out outside, but the stay was still a great one. Would recommend this home! "
1029680,28293697,2015-03-21,6147352,Kerb,"Thank you for the wonderful, relaxing, and productive stay at the bungalow.

3535171,16036757,2014-07-20,17831157,Zach,"I had a wonderful stay at Lynda's place.  It's a very cute house in the Greenwood neighborhood with great coffee shops and restaurants right around the corner.  Check out Pete's Egg Nest for an amazing breakfast.  The setup of Lynda's house allows you to have a private stay which is nice if you need to come and go late at night and you don't want to disturb anyone.  The room was clean, comfortable, quiet, and all around relaxing.  Beautiful flowers out front as well.  I much preferred this stay to ordinary hotels and inns.  Lynda was an excellent host and I will definitely be staying again!  

Thanks."
3535171,16427207,2014-07-27,17927845,Violeta,"First of all, I have to say that I made the reservation for my husband, so the next lines are about his experience. Lynda was a amazing host, she was always helpful with all what he needed, about food, location, trasportation, etc. She is a very polite person and used to share some drinks and meals with my husband.  The neighborhood is quiet, there are good restaurants around, it is very easy to take public transportation.  The room is very comfortable, clean and quiet.  He told me that there was an excellent experience, he absolutely recommends her house for accomodation and he will take Lynda's house again if he goes to Seattle some day."
3535171,16799384,2014-08-02,786836,John,"The host was very warm and gracious, and she made every attempt to make you feel at home.  She provided information about local restaurants and sites to see in Seattle.  I would be happy to stay there again but sometimes the available parking was limited."
3535171,17114926,2014-08-07,14824674,Stefano,"We were looking for accomodation for 2 people that we wished was 
- cleaned
- in a household eell kept, that revealed care
- in a safe neighbourwood which could entuslly offer dining opportunities outside of the touristic circle
- managed with discretion, savoir faire and care, attention for the customer
If you are sharing all these desires Lynda's place is your place.
Well done Lynda and thank you again"
3535171,17466025,2014-08-12,7318607,Katherine,"I stayed here with my sister while in town for a wedding. although Lynda was unable to be at the house for the first few days of our stay, she managed to make us feel more than welcome and made sure her son was there to get us all settled in. The room was exactly as expected and we had access to all amenities during our stay. Such a lovely home and beautiful back patio where you can enjoy your morning coffee. And she always has a fresh bowl of fruit and some bread and bagels to which you can help yourself! Honestly, one of my best AirBnB experiences yet! "
3535171,17719252,2014-08-16,19570957,Andy,"Lynda was a great host.  Everything on her listing is accurate.  As someone who is relocating to Seattle, she was extremely helpful on various parts of town and social activities.  The location is great and easy to get to/from various parts of the city.  I would definitely stay here again and suggest Lynda's place to friends."
3535171,18128355,2014-08-22,17602469,Janice,"My husband and I were in Seattle for our friend's wedding. During our stay, Lynda has been very welcoming and considerate, thus I must say Lynda is a great host! First of all she placed a detailed letter on the desk listing all the dos and don'ts which I think is a perfect way to obtain mutual understanding. What's more, she even put bus schedules and books about Seattle's attractions right next to your room door. The room was clean and tidy. There is very pretty gardening up front. Personally I think Lynda's place is better than hotels, as it got many nice restaurants and cafe around the corner, and it has easy access to public transportation. It was an excellent first Airbnb experience!"
3535171,18890828,2014-09-02,18834088,James,Lynda was a very gracious host. She interacted with me as much or as little as I wanted. We had some pleasurable discussions in the morning over coffee. She is very knowledgable about the area and can help guide you to a better experience. The room was excellent with a very comfortable bed. 
3535171,19291781,2014-09-09,19570957,Andy,"This is my second time staying here.  What can I say, I'm a repeat customer for many reasons.  Lynda has a great setup here and is very welcoming.  Enjoyed breakfast and dinner multiple times on the back deck.  Great location, ample parking and restaurants within walking distance a block or two away.  I don't require a lot of pampering so I'm probably an easy person to please.  The place is generally clean and organized with space to store food if you choose.  I would recommend it to anyone."
3535171,20530129,2014-09-30,18661392,Sharon,"I just stayed at Lynda's and was happy with the accommodations.  It was my first experience with airbnb and she made me feel comfortable and  welcome.  Her description of the home is very accurate.  Although I didn't spend much time in the surrounding neighborhood, I could see many shops and cafes in passing.  I would definitely stay at Lynda's again and recommend it to my friends."
3535171,22619504,2014-11-10,22219830,Jerome,Lynda is a great hostess and the accommodations are quite comfortable.  The only (minor) problem: any noise travels quite easily through the house.
3535171,22831633,2014-11-16,196804,Donna,"Lynda was a warm and welcoming host and opened her lovely home for me to stay while visiting family nearby. The bedroom was as described with a very comfortable bed and very good quality mattress and pillows. Her home was very clean. She provided continental breakfast and French Press coffee to start the day off right.  
The neighborhood is very convenient with lots of coffee shops and restaurants and library nearby. ALso very near bus transportation.
I plan to stay at Lynda's again next time I visit family."
3535171,24320174,2014-12-26,19623371,Courtney,"We arrived at Lynda's home late at night, in the rain and we were delighted to find our living quarters to be warm, bright, roomy and welcoming.  The closet was huge, so we unpacked immediately and made ourselves at home.  Lynda showed us around the rest of the house and provided kitchen space for our food,  if needed.  Every morning she made wonderful coffee.  She even invited us to her Christmas party!  Our children live within walking distance which is why we chose Lynda's location.  It worked out beautifully to be able to walk back and forth between her house and theirs.  
Lynda had lots of information about the neighborhood and Seattle, itself, with plenty of ideas on things to do.  She was very helpful on how to use the bus lines.  Staying with Lynda was a wonderful way to spend this Christmas.  "
3535171,28544659,2015-03-25,682566,Margot,"My daughter and I had a lovely stay with Lynda and a great trip to Seattle.  Her house was in a great location that seemed convenient to just about everything. Her house was spotless and beautiful and she was a totally thoughtful hostess. Her communication was excellent--she was so kind to share her kitchen and always have coffee, muffins, etc for breakfast for us. Thank you for everything, Lynda!"
3535171,28913124,2015-03-31,29944168,Jeremy,"Very clean, extremely friendly, great neighborhood.  Can't go wrong here!"
3535171,30620048,2015-04-25,29676379,Jack,"Lynda was very welcoming and I enjoyed staying at her home. She gave advice about where to go in the area, as well as providing amenities such as a refrigerator just steps away from the two rooms and plenty of towels. She was a great host."
3535171,32083005,2015-05-13,32276045,Phillip,"Lynda was a great host.  She treated me like a relative that you wanted to see and host.  She was very welcoming.  Very accommodating.  Offering help on where to go and what to see.
The listing was accurate.  I can't comment on the neighborhood as I didn't get a chance to walk around but it seemed nice.
I would definitely recommend staying here."
3535171,33540610,2015-05-29,56133,Grant,"Lynda was an incredibly gracious host and her house was beautiful, comfortable and in an excellent location."
3535171,33961990,2015-06-02,30304511,Julie,Lynda was a great host. The house was clean and in a cute suburban neighborhood. Lynda was very welcoming and had breakfast and coffee available for us in the morning. Thanks for a great stay!
3535171,34464189,2015-06-08,33460398,Donna,It was just what we needed and we enjoyed it so much.  The back yard is prettier than the front yard.  We enjoyed being out side so much.  I recommend it to anyone that is going to be in this area.  
3535171,35683444,2015-06-21,33772929,Ariana,"Lynda was a great host, with how she was there if you needed her/wanted to chat in the morning, but also doing her own thing if you wanted privacy. We felt very safe and comfortable in her home, and our room was a quiet, perfect space for two. We would recommend her house to anyone, it's in a safe area of Seattle, and overall access to it was easy when traveling anywhere by public transportation/walking. If you are looking for a great house with a great host, stay here! "
3535171,36706356,2015-06-30,34776929,Patrick,"Lynda was an amazing host! My wife and I stayed in her house for a week, and we have no complaints. Lynda contacted me before the trip to arrange a time to check in (or if she wasn't available, instructions on how to do so). The bedroom and bathroom were clean and well stocked. Her house was in a great neighborhood with restaurants, coffee shops, grocery stores, and bars all within a very short walk. 

We enjoyed having coffee with Lynda on her awesome back porch in the morning. She is a wealth of knowledge about the area. She was very respectful of her guests' privacy if it was wanted (but we really just enjoyed talking with her).  She made us feel very welcome in her home. 

I was in town for some job interviews, and Lynda was always sure to wish me luck before I left, and ask me how they went afterwards.  

I highly recommend this listing, and I will definitely look to stay here on any return visits!"
3535171,37204091,2015-07-05,35598078,Diane,"We had a fantastic stay with Lynda, her house is lovely, we felt very much at home during our 2 nights there. We took the bus to get there from down town which was very easy.  We loved the bagels, fresh coffee and great conversation out in the garden each morning. We would certainly recommend staying with Lynda."
3535171,37823991,2015-07-10,37784550,Darron,"What can I say? I had a most *excellent* stay at Lynda's!  She was very accommodating of my last-minute booking and late check-in, with no fuss.  The room was very clean!  The bed was comfortable and the bathroom was fully prepped with towels, wash cloths, soap, and shampoo ... very convenient for me!

The location is amazing too! Lynda's place is very close to highly rated restaurants, if you don't feel like being downtown for good food.  And my morning commute into Downtown was very easy too. The first morning there was only some traffic, and the next morning there wasn't any.  It took about 12 minutes by car. (It took 20 minutes by bus in the evening from Downtown to Lynda's.)

I strongly recommend anyone needing a clean, comfortable, private place to stay, in an awesome location, stay at Lynda's.  Thank you so much for an excellent BnB experience!!"
3535171,37984225,2015-07-12,6225193,Maayan,"Lynda has a lovely home and has set it up to be very comfortable and easy for guests. We could enter and exit through the garage as needed, and shared a bathroom with one other room of guests during out stay.  This was a great location for apartment/home hunting as it's right near major roads and also near some great neighborhoods.  Lynda is a warm and welcoming host and we enjoyed staying with her. "
3535171,38992003,2015-07-20,25958887,Lori,"This was my first AirBnB experience.  I am a VRBO host myself.  Lynda was an exceptional host with the ideal location in Greenwood.  She is less than a half a block from the main drag of neighborhood businesses and about 3 blocks from Green Lake.  The main bus line to get to downtown Seattle was a minute walk. As for her home, what a great set up! There is a dedicated entry and the bedrooms and bathroom which are in the lower level of the home, are very private and comfortable. I liked that although she was home, there was no pressure to interact. But once you meet her, there's no way you won't want to join her in the kitchen at the top of the stairs for morning coffee! (I did the Coffee Crawl (tour) in downtown so I feel confident in sharing my enthusiasm for her roast! Delicious!!)

Lynda is exactly as all former reviewers have described.  She is so personable!  Book your stay here and you will not be disappointed. I will be back and this is where I will be staying!"
3535171,40609318,2015-08-01,34900491,Pat,"Lynda was a wonderful and gracious host & I felt as if I were in a ""true"" B&B where you feel as if you are a guest in the host's home and they interact with you as a ""tour guide"" for their city. Lynda had pre-arranged to pick me up at the airport, gave me a tour of her neighborhood, made sure that I was comfy in my room, provided ample tourist literature and maps, taught me the local bus system, provided a great breakfast & timed the coffee perfectly for when I showed up in the kitchen. Her home and gardens are beautiful & I felt safe and welcomed at all times. I really enjoyed Lynda's conversations and she displayed the perfect balance of being friendly with out being overly-intrusive."
3535171,41785812,2015-08-09,6809203,Susan,"Great neighborhood!  Lynda made us feel welcome and our room was clean and comfortable.  Loved being able to walk through downtown Greenwood.  Fun shops, pubs, and cafes. "
3535171,42351038,2015-08-12,1430141,Arya,Excellent space and location. Pictures do not do it justice. Lynda was a great host. Would stay here again.
3535171,42892890,2015-08-16,38288856,James,"Very friendly and helpful host. Convenient entry with code #. Nice room, comfortable bed. Clean, modern bathroom."
3535171,43644677,2015-08-21,37995472,Charlene,"Lynda was so friendly and nice when I stayed there. The room was quite, clean and comfortable. It's easy to go to downtown by bus. I would like to stay there again if I travel Seattle"
3535171,44014577,2015-08-23,986111,Melissa,"Lynda was super prompt and great about getting back to me.  Her place was very clean and described as is.  It was easy, the area was charming and her place was relaxing.  Thank you Lynda!"
3535171,44833565,2015-08-29,41452927,Lynda,"Lynda made me feel very welcome.  The bedroom and bathroom were spotlessly clean!  The neighborhood was wonderful; minutes to shops, restaurants and the bus.  Took the bus to downtown, a boat tour and Pike's Market.  It also felt very safe.  I took the bus and train back to the airport, leaving when it was dark!  The total cost was $4, instead of the $45 I paid taking the shuttle coming in.  I would definitely recommend Lynda's home, especially if you want to get around Seattle easily without a car.
"
3535171,45300605,2015-09-01,40891780,Janet,"The host made us feel welcome and relaxed. We were surprised how quiet it was considering the busy street. 

Lynda makes you feel comfortable. I would recommend this for anyone wanting to try Airbnb. This was our first time and we will try it again for sure. "
3535171,45822423,2015-09-06,21233034,Clinton,"So this was my first Airbnb experience. I was a little nervous and unsure but Lynda was super communicative and welcoming. Everything that she stated on her listing was spot on, her house was easy to find and well kept, her directions were clear, and her rooms were comfortable. She had coffee in the morning and even some bagels and fruit. It was much better than staying at a hotel - I actually felt like I was staying at a friends house. There is plenty to do in the neighborhood and it was easy to get to all the major hot spots, as well. I will definitely be using Airbnb more in the future and if I'm ever back in Seattle I'll see if Lynda is available, first! "
3535171,46424805,2015-09-10,4919757,Helen,The room was just as described. Everything was clean and comfortable including the bathroom. Linda was a very gracious host. She was very flexible with check in and check out times which helped us a lot. She offered to provide free breakfast both mornings and was friendly and helpful. It's much easier to get about the city with your own transport although the bus was fairly nearby if needed. We did not use it. There are cafes within a two minute walk.
3535171,46996323,2015-09-14,43660546,Jianli,"My girlfriend and I stayed in this lovely place for three nights when we traveled to Seattle. The listing is exactly as described, and looks exactly like the posted photos. The host, Lynda, is very welcoming and considerate. She has prepared a notice which told us things we need to know when we stayed. So although we got there very late and didn't have a chance to meet her that night, we got all the information we needed. There is also always cool water and juice in the fridge. And when we left, Lynda is very nice and let us put our bags in the house and pick them up later, before we left for our flight at night. "
3535171,47758727,2015-09-21,30546288,Rachel,My husband and I had a wonderful stay with Lynda. She made us feel very comfortable and at home there. Also the bed was very comfortable! She was very flexible with our schedule as we came and went later in the evening.
3535171,51554079,2015-10-21,235088,Ira,"In a word, terrific!
Lynda is helpful, thoughtful & gracious.
Spotless-clean & comfortable place.
Great neighborhood, too."
3535171,53083207,2015-11-04,13004670,Emily,"Great! Lynda was very helpful, happy, laid back, easy-going, clean and tidy. We loved the location as well with all of the great restaurants nearby. "
3535171,53485881,2015-11-09,45593481,Bob,A very comfortable stay with a gracious host.
3535171,55218389,2015-11-29,11870234,Gloria,"Lynda made me feel very very welcome. The room and bath are exactly as they appear in the photos. There are plenty of towels, bath products and a hair dryer in the bathroom and in my bedroom. Lynda picky me up at the airport and was there when I arrived even though it was rush hour. There was delicious coffee, yogurt, fruit and oatmeal every morning. Lynda was kind enough to offer me any bakeware I need to cook thanksgiving dinner for my family in their small apartment and I did borrow a roasting pan. There was also fresh bread for toast at breakfast. I don't want to neglect to mention that. Besides space in the kitchen frig there is also a small frig and microwave in the garage guests can use.  The bed was very comfortable. Thank you Lynda!"
3535171,55879311,2015-12-06,30898061,Debra,"I enjoyed my stay at Lynda's home. Great location !!
The home is charming & comfortable, Lynda was doing some holiday decorating which made it more cozy. She made me feel so comfortable. Everything is just as described, I had a very restful sleep & would certainly book with Lynda again."
3535171,57905444,2015-12-30,7706697,Barbara,Clean quiet affordable. A bock from my nephew's house ...ultra convenient.

7128310,38329609,2015-07-14,9176097,Roman,"Noora was a great host, helpful and hospitable. Her recommendations of things to try were spot on. The apartment itself was quite spacious, and Noora generously let us use her coffee and tea supplies. Of course, we didn't spend much time in the apartment because it was so close to the things we wanted to do. The bed was comfortable. 

Two minor issues with the apartment, none of which were Noora's fault. First, there was a noisy neighbor whose music traveled into the apartment. Second, we often smelled marihuana in the hallway (though we really should've expected that given it's Capitol Hill in Seattle)."
7128310,38772467,2015-07-18,17132476,Chris,Noora was very accommodating and the check-in/check-out process was painless. The location is awesome (lots of great things in walking distance) and the apartment is very spacious. 
7128310,42154117,2015-08-11,19840978,Roland,"Noora is a lovely host, i saw her at my arrival, she is verry friendly and had always a smile. showed me arround the apartment, which is great located in Capitol Hill, a lot of bars, restaurants are in walking distance. 
sorry for my english, i'm swiss :-)"
1593939,6978161,2013-09-01,2825235,Sasha,"Roger was very personable and accommodating- 
He took me under his wing, gave me directions on where to go, and even took me to a service at his synagogue! 
It was great. Thanks Roger."
1593939,7042137,2013-09-04,8263368,Tatsuya,"It was awesome! He is very friendly and his house is decorated by his arts and his friend's paintings. When I arrived there early, he took me a short trip around his house. I'll surely stay here again. Thank you so much!!"
1593939,7086145,2013-09-05,8510541,Lissa,roger was warm and helpful.  His place is close to bus lines and was easy to get around town from.
1593939,7213178,2013-09-10,8662546,Daniel,"Very accommodating and friendly host. I enjoyed my stay and the neighborhood. The bed in this room is next to washing machines and an open doorway to the kitchen, which isn't ideal, but wasn't a major inconvenience. Nice windows and view to the backyard + a little sitting area and coffee table. Travel to downtown is pretty easy by bus."
1593939,8011120,2013-10-12,8736911,David,"This was a great stay. Roger is a wonderful host and the place itself is warm, clean and uncluttered. The location is great. Roger has been doing this a while and is an AirBnB pro."
1593939,8063858,2013-10-14,9192833,Shawna,"First time using Airbnb, I booked this room at Roger's house. His house is very clean and welcoming. I grew up in a 100 year-old victorian house, and Roger's house had that same charm. Made me feel at home! He has notes and instructions around the house for guests, so even though he wasn't there when I checked in, I still knew I was welcomed. He knew I was doing a 5k the next morning and left a banana with a note when I left! Very thoughtful, great communication, thank you Roger!"
1593939,8229779,2013-10-21,9039613,Bob,"Roger's space is clean, warm and cozy, and user friendly.  After a long day, it was great to come to a home rather than a hotel.  The proximity to grocery stores and eateries is perfect,  and the ability to cook even late evening was a bonus!!

Thank you Roger!!"
1593939,9210173,2013-12-13,8787311,Nathan,"This was my first time using airbnb and the experience went very smoothly. Roger is a friendly host, the room was very clean and comfortable and it was much less expensive than a hotel would have been."
1593939,9431800,2013-12-28,1231188,Melody,"My experience staying at Roger's Laundry room was excellent. The room was clean and tidy, exactly the way it was described by other reviewers. Being someone who lives in California and Southeast Asia my whole life, I was also a little concerned about whether the room would be too cold during winter. I emailed Roger about my concern and he promised he would make it warm and he did! :) The heat was already turned up in the room before I arrived, I felt completely at ease in the room! 

Bonus points to Roger's friendly manner and hospitality! We spent a fair amount of time chatting about language learning, culture, traveling, art etc. which I enjoyed very much. 

I highly recommend Roger and his places to everyone! :)"
1593939,9625591,2014-01-03,4149369,Phyllis,"Peaceful house, friendly folks  make sure you realize this is a laundry room without a door.. Roger and even other guest can -and do- enter.  I didn't mind."
1593939,10996710,2014-03-16,12244315,Oteri,"Roger was a great host, he was very responsive and made me feel welcome despite a hurried reservation on my part. The room was very comfortable and private and I enjoyed Roger's company, as well."
1593939,11316745,2014-03-29,8616871,Sovannaroth,"My first thought when i walked in, i was not sure that the bed would be comfy or not but after i sat on it and slept on it , it was super comfy!! Roger provided me 4 pillows !!! And i love that!!, so i could choose how soft of the pillow that i wanna sleep on that night. The place is very clean, warm,quiet ,and smells good and i had a very good sleep!!!  Thank you Roger!"
1593939,12324533,2014-04-28,14757860,Martha,Roger was a lovely host!  This was my first stay with Air BnB and he was very helpful with the process. The house was pleasant and well organized with good attention to detail.  There was tea and coffee and fresh towels and blankets we could help ourselves to.  Roger was easy to get a hold of and kind. I would stay with him again if I return to Seattle.
1593939,13331688,2014-05-25,13713198,Julia,"I had a great stay at Roger's place. The laundry room was comfortable and felt very private. The view of the back yard was very nice and the birds woke me up in the morning. Oh, and Roger makes a great latte as well.The neighborhood is a lovely residential area. Just a few blocks away you can enjoy the hustle and bustle of the city with shopping and restaurants, easy access to public transportation etc. i spent most of Saturday walking around. The University and Green Lake are close by. I also walked on the Burke Gilman Trail. This may be a bit far for some, but again, Roger's neighborhood in Fremont is easily accessible to everything. I did not see much of Roger, but he made me feel welcome and is a fun guy.  "
1593939,13987413,2014-06-09,16038554,Elyzabeth,First time with air bnb and I had a great experience staying with Roger. He was a very generous host and gave me lots of suggestions for places to explore. You should stay with him!
1593939,14101145,2014-06-11,13412308,Jeanne-Helene,"en fait il ne s'agit pas d'une chambre mais plutôt d'un lit une place installé dans la buanderie qui communique directement avec la cuisine, avec peu de place pour poser ses bagages
dans ces conditions c'est assez bruyant à cause d'un réfrigérateur ancien qui fait beaucoup de bruit et de l'utilisation de cette cuisine;
de plus il n'y a pas de rideaux à toutes les fenêtres
si on est sensible au bruit et à la lumière c'est pas bon
Tout ceci est bien précisé dans l'annonce que je n'avais pas bien lue.
Pour moi le prix est excessif.
L'hôte est agréable; 
In fact it is not about a room but rather about a single bed settled in the laundry which communicates directly with the kitchen, with little room to put its luggage in these conditions it is rather noisy because of a old refrigerator which makes a lot of noise and of the use of this kitchen.
Furthermore there are no curtains in all the windows
if we are sensitive to the noise and to the light it is not good
All this is specified well in the announcement which I had not well read.
For me the price is excessive.
The host is pleasant;
Jeanne-hélène"
1593939,14575447,2014-06-22,16056607,Youngsoo,"I had a great stay at Roger's comfortable place! The room which I slept was not spacious, but it had a bed, a small table and a chair, and a closet. I could use all I needed in my room. Roger is friendly and responsive. Every time I had a question, I called him and he was always willing to share his time and take care of my concerns. Since he is fun to talk with, I recommend to have a chat with him about whatever you want. He gave me a Seattle driving tour and it was one of the greatest things that I did in this trip. He is an expert in Seattle and so I think that it is worth paying if you are interested in looking around Seattle."
1593939,15565255,2014-07-11,17800005,Wylie,"I was in a jam with no place to stay, late in the afternoon. Roger was timely with his response and accommodating for a late arrival. Thank you for sharing your home. Cheers"
1593939,15621855,2014-07-13,14174357,Heidi,"This was a great stay and exactly what I needed -- a place to sleep a few hours before pedaling the Seattle to Portland ride.  Even though I arrived in Seattle much later than expected, I found a warm welcoming space and had a nice chat with Roger before settling in to sleep.  I was already awake and preparing for my ride in the early hours of the morning when Roger's other house guest came home.  We had a brief and friendly chat in the kitchen over glasses of water before he went upstairs to bed.  By 4 a.m. my bike and I were blissfully on our way.  Thank you so much, Roger, for being accommodating to my weird schedule.  I quite enjoyed the well-lit sunroom with it's lush garden backdrop and, of course, the purple marmoleum floor!"
1593939,15726077,2014-07-14,17733830,Jared,Nice stay. Rodger made the accommodation easy and comfortable. Location is great. 
1593939,16209551,2014-07-23,16512722,Khoa,"This was my first time using airbnb and everything was great. Roger is a great, friendly host. The room is clean and organized. He makes everything easy during my stay, and he is flexible with check-in and check-out time. It was a good trip and good time staying at Roger's place for me."
1593939,16372387,2014-07-26,1778973,John,Roger's place was just as described. He was easy to communicate with - a nice guy - and the place was super convenient for a great night's sleep on a budget. I would stay here again under similar circumstances.
1593939,16581266,2014-07-29,18165688,Connie,"Roger was very good at keeping me informed of all before I arrived. I got in late and left early, so didn't really get a chance to absorb the very lovely ambiance~ but this house is in a nice neighborhood near a place that I come to for appointments in Seattle, so I am happy to have found this bright little oasis in the city where I won't have to deal with traffic!! I'll definitely stay here again :-)"
1593939,16724783,2014-08-01,17214240,Kimberly,Roger's sunroom/laundry room was very comfortable.  I made use of teh toaster oven and refrigerator.  He left out teas and some snacks which was very welcoming.  I was very comfortable sleeping there.
1593939,17192088,2014-08-08,19202300,Jeannie,"Roger was not available during my stay so, unfortunately, I did not meet him. He was prompt in communicating and left clear instructions. His home was neat and clean. My room was a bit cramped but that was not a problem as I was out and about for most of my stay, and just slept there. I would stay again, if I were in the area."
1593939,17386751,2014-08-11,210842,David,Great place in a quiet neighborhood close to many bars and restaurants just a few blocks away.  It was my first time in this neighborhood and I enjoyed it.
1593939,17852986,2014-08-18,18146092,Jose,We didn't have the pleasure of meeting Roger because he was out of town. We enjoyed our stay in his cozy house. It is centrally located in a very nice area of Seattle.
1593939,18220862,2014-08-23,19481297,Keli,It is my first time to try Airbna! It is amazing and great experience to try it and save money and make friends in Seattle!
1593939,18280775,2014-08-24,20085067,Cosmo,Was in and out of there in less than a day but I had a great experience. I felt very welcomed and enjoyed talking with Roger. Thanks for the ice cream!
1593939,18450540,2014-08-26,905781,Joshua,"Roger was an excellent host, very friendly and helpful. His house is in an great location and very accessible. The room was a described, simple yet quite comfortable. The house has a cute backyard patio, and is in a quiet neighborhood. I'd stay here again anytime!"
1593939,19049772,2014-09-05,19869205,Yiru,"*Roger's place is really cozy and comfortable to stay. 
*He is really nice and friendly too. 
*Loved that area. 
*It's easy to get to downtown by buses( I even did by my foot!)  "
1593939,19218102,2014-09-08,18781323,Matthew,"Roger was very pleasant. I was viting a friend in town who rents a room nearby, and he was very accomodating for us. He made himself available, but was never intrusive. He helped me with some key logistics in managing bags that saved me a lot of hassle and allowed me to enjoy my time there to the fullest. 

Roger's place is clean, cozy, and he has lots of coffee and tea selections to offer. He cares about making his guests comfortable and has great knowledge of the area. Roger's place is wonderfully located only a few blocks away from convenient bus routes, beween charming Wallingford and Fremont neighborhoods, and near Green Lake. Tremendous variety in dining across multiple cooking styles and ethnic foods from taco stands to upscale cuisine all within walking distance. Friendly local bars. Neat shops. Easy to take the bus downtown. Great value. A true Seattle experience, I'm sure. Cheers, Roger!"
1593939,19354034,2014-09-10,11919744,Andrew,"Popped into Seattle for the night for a show. Roger's place was easy to get to, clean, and an ease to enter with the key lock box. Bed was great and the privacy screen was sufficient. Would recommend this space to anyone who just needs a bed in a cool location! "
1593939,19439787,2014-09-12,16736213,Pohsien,"Roger is a talkative good guy. He provides clean rooms and flexible policy . He also allowed me leave baggage when the leasing was over. Moreover., he has many stories about his energetic  past to tell you if you wanna listen to. "
1593939,19744699,2014-09-17,20617545,Luis,This was my first experience with AirBNB and Roger was a great host.  The room was very clean and perfect for what I needed.  Good location with lots to do within walking distance.
1593939,20042485,2014-09-22,5174172,Santiago,"This was my first airbnb experience having a private room instead of booking the whole flat. 
I have some experience on airbnb and without any doubt, this has been a very special one. Frankly!!
Roger is an exceptional host. He cares about his guesses and try to keep everything perfect. 
The house is very well situated at one of the trendiest boroughs of Seattle. 15 minutes away from downtown you ""live"" in a quiet, nice and residential area... But at the same point you live at one of the most exciting parts of Seattle with good restaurants, bar, ice cream shops, etc. 
The room I stayed in (downstairs) is not the best I've been in. But this is not a problem as it was very good enough for what I wanted. And the price is damn good!!!
That's on the technical point of all. 
On the human side, Roger talks to you and listens to you. I had a great conversation that lasted hours as we went for a tour. For me, visiting a city is not just visiting places. It's knowing the city. And my expects were fully completed!!!
If I were you... Do it!!"
1593939,20258176,2014-09-26,13207954,Marcus,"Roger is a wonderful and caring host! I was gone quite a bit, but always felt welcome! Thanks for the hospitality!"
1593939,28764046,2015-03-29,29973754,Ameen,Roger was very helpful with directions to the house and met me on the first day. The bus connection from downtown to the house is very convenient and I spent a day walking around the neighbourhood and found great food options on foot. I stayed in the laundry room which is  functional and met my needs and represented good value. I'd contact Roger to stay again if in Seattle. 
1593939,29900831,2015-04-13,11104546,Melissa,"Roger was not around but had a clean home, gave me great suggestions, was quick to respond to my questions and lives in a great neighborhood, close to many cool spots, especially Fremont"
1593939,32442138,2015-05-17,33514034,Jeongju,"If you are traveling alone, I can recommend Roger's house. He is talkative, considerate, and good! When I lived in his house, it was just coming back my home. Although I stayed one short day, his house was very clean and perfect. And what's more, the transportation which is nearby his house is so comfortable.

If I visit Seattle one more time, I will go to his house."
1593939,32788310,2015-05-21,33309520,Robert,"If your looking for a quiet enviroment to stay This is the place, I was there for 4 days and rarely heard a peep from anyone. Roger was friendly, helpful, and accommidating.  I recommend this place .. great location with many food options in the area and getting around was easy.  5 / 5 stars"
1593939,33191899,2015-05-25,10134755,Kelly,"Roger was a fantastic host and someone I would definitely stay with again.  There is a very communal feel to his home and I appreciate that.  His communication about times to meet, kitchen layout, etc etc. were great.  I felt very welcome my whole stay.  Thanks again Roger!"
1593939,33588359,2015-05-30,31402144,Bob,"Nice place, very clean.  The room was good for a single traveler. Close to a lot of restaurants in Wallingford. Very nice front and back porch."
1593939,34333353,2015-06-07,33541279,Jay,"People like Roger is what makes Airbnb an awesome platform.

This sunroom is a nicely priced listing offered by a wonderful host who is super helpful and accommodating. Roger ensures that the place is clean and the guests have what they need (plus more!). The area is quiet and and getting to downtown is an easy commute. Also, Greenlake and Woodland Park is like a 15-20 minute walk if you're into outdoor activities.

If you are traveling and happen to be lucky to see this listing available, I suggest you book it asap =)"
1593939,34870427,2015-06-13,8336715,Jose,"Roger's place is perfect for traveling alone. Very quiet and clean. 
Roger is a great landlord, very easy communication, check in and out was super easy. Plus, he is very caring and a very fun guy to talk to. 
100% recommended! "
1593939,35405592,2015-06-18,34484975,Andrew,"Nice neighborhood, walking distance of grocery store, things to do, and bus stops. Great central location if you're looking to do stuff downtown but also want to explore cool outer neighborhoods like Greenlake and Phinney Ridge. Accommodations were comfortable, and I felt that it was easy to get well rested throughout my stay. Roger was very knowledgeable about things to do in the area and how to get around the city. Overall the sunroom is a great option for a lone traveler on a budget."
1593939,36602751,2015-06-29,35407951,Scotty,Roger was very warm and welcoming. He was waiting on the porch when I arrived to greet me. 
1593939,37098687,2015-07-04,36574074,Sion (Maria For Legal),"I enjoyed his quick and thorough communication about finding the location and leaving the key for me. Its a fantastic neighborhood  too. The laundry room with an old twin bed and the first floor (that was all I saw) had a austere monk like aesthetic with no modern luxuries or amenities. The refrigerator and freezer were old and rusty.  I was disappointed at thread bare old sheets, blankets and lack of pillows and the line to use the single bathroom and shower at midnight.  Being without a real door and part of the kitchen makes it not a place for anyone who wants to sleep in. There was an unusual and serious heat wave and he provided open doors and a good fan which I appreciated. I locked the screen door for safety and he chastised me for doing so, as guests I never saw had to be let in by him as a result. I still think my choosing security for his home was the right choice, the lock was there so I figured that is what he would want. I was chastised for being atheist (told I don't exist!)  and he told me it would offend his other guests and  cited their heritage and age as the reason if they saw me in my night shirt. I was in only a night shirt looking for water and the wi-fi five feet from my screened off doorway when I thought no one was on the first floor. I know atheists are marginalized and make some folks very uncomfortable and I had included that in my profile so I can avoid conflict with anyone in their private homes.  I checked out a day early and just wrote the expense off. I think for some folks this place would work well (many great reviews here of happy folks )  even though it was very uncomfortable for me, so I am not saying to not book this. I do believe the positive reviews are people's real experiences,  as is my mixed review is truthful too. "
1593939,37249378,2015-07-05,33885152,Michael,"Fremont is a great place to stay while in Seattle. I booked one night with Roger, as I needed to catch my flight from SeaTac the next day but still wanted to hang around Seattle in the evening (instead of at the airport hotel). The price was great, and despite the room being listed as a ""laundry room,"" Roger did a great job of making it feel like a bedroom. It was comfortable to sleep in. "
1593939,37534510,2015-07-07,16373449,Dana,"Roger's place is the best place a traveler could ask for- it's nice and clean and Roger is an amazing host! The neighborhood is really cool and there are plenty of stuff to see around, many restaurants and a grocery store near by. Roger is very friendly and happy to help with anything you need. If I ever get back to Seattle Roger's will be my first choice!"
1593939,37833304,2015-07-11,14174357,Heidi,I had a great time staying in Roger's sunroom again.  He was there to welcome me to his house and offer activities during my stay.  I enjoyed dining at restaurants in the neighborhood and checking out Wallingford on bike.  I found the space quiet and restful and accommodating to my needs.  The other guests in the house were friendly and courteous. 
1593939,38075949,2015-07-12,37849990,Kosala,"Host was welcoming; received a call and text to make sure I knew how to get in late and to make sure I arrived safely. 
Safe neighborhood. I would recommend again!"
1593939,38748036,2015-07-18,2403124,Edith,"Roger's little house is charming, and the downstairs bedroom off the kitchen turned out to be very quiet, since everyone else in the house was very considerate about making noise in the kitchen area.  Roger is very thoughtful and considerate, and he did things like bringing us fresh blackberries he had picked. I will definitely plan to stay with him again when I am visiting in Seattle."
1593939,39413974,2015-07-23,35487491,Chris,"I had a great experience staying at Roger's. He was friendly, considerate, and communicative. Things to expect like guest arrivals, noise, or space constraints were always made clear well ahead of time, and Roger often made accommodations. Though the downstairs room is not large, Roger makes good use of the space. Views of the garden and interior decoration make it a comfortable home. Roger also suggested travel and dining options to improve my experience in the neighborhood and the city. I would definitely stay here again next time!"
1593939,39663430,2015-07-25,34347445,Christine(Xiaoyan),"The room I chose at this home is pretty good for a single, clean, simple, cozy. He detailed prepared everything may need. Appreciate his host. "
1593939,39826020,2015-07-26,37938992,Liviu,"I only stayed one night at Roger's place and had no complaints whatsoever. The room was small but comfortable and the house was very quiet, thereby allowing me to get a good night's sleep before apartment hunting the next morning. Would definitely stay here again and I'll recommend Roger to others. "
1593939,40036058,2015-07-27,17316772,Ted,"I quite enjoyed my stay at Roger's quaint Seattle style house.  Located centrally in Fremont, it allowed us easy access to where I needed to be for my friend's wedding.  Though a bit small, the front porch and back patio are very charming, although there may be 2-3 other tenants in the place which I would've liked to know about beforehand.  Overall though a very positive experience and I would definitely recommend!"
1593939,40191332,2015-07-28,19074817,Larry,This is a nice environment. Roger was very welcoming.
1593939,40543333,2015-07-31,39662049,Crystal,"Rodger was a good host and his house is located in a great neighborhood close to green lake.  He was at the residence to greet me and gave me lots of wonderful tips on restaurants (fantastic waterfront happy hour), neighborhood and local hot spots to check out.  He was easy to communicate with and made connecting with him accessible, if needed. On my final day, Rodger was kind enough to drive me to Waterworks park which has spectacular view of the city and dropped me at a waterfront restaurant for a yummy Salmon dinner.  He definitely knows his way around the city and can provide you with many recommendations on  local gems.  The room is exactly what it is listed as and having access to outside patio made it feel more spacious.  I don't think I would be able to stay in the small space for several days yet it was just fine for my 2 nights in Seattle.  "
1593939,41363545,2015-08-07,31975967,Peter,"Roger was a fantastic and friendly host, and the room was comfortable and perfect for a single traveller."
1593939,43079494,2015-08-17,37884065,Kristen,"Roger was very welcoming when I arrived in Seattle. He took the time to show me around the house and point out maps/guides that he had for the area. Knowing that I was there for an event and some of the places I wanted to see, he told me the best ways to get around the area. He even suggeated apps that I could download to help find bua routes. The neighborhood as a whole was very clean and safe. I never had any issues coming or going anywhere. I'd highly recommend Roger as a host and would stay there again myself if I'm ever back in Seattle!"
1593939,43822780,2015-08-22,875584,Scott,"Roger is a great, courteous host who was easy to coordinate with and flexible on timing. He met me at arrival, showed me the place, and that was that. Room was clean, comfortable, and had plenty of Seattle charm-- just what I was looking for. I will stay here again."
1593939,44509810,2015-08-26,26467164,Phillip,"Roger was a wonderful host, with a warm personality and laid-back way, and I felt very welcomed and relaxed. He has a lovely and immaculate home, and its location makes for an easy walk to many restaurants/cafes in the Fremont area. The room was cozy and very comfortable, and it looks out on a nice backyard/garden. I highly recommend staying with Roger if you are coming to Seattle--it will definitely add to the enjoyment of your visit."
1593939,44705751,2015-08-28,33453002,Bjoern,"Roger was very friendly and I slept well! 
I would recommend this place."
1593939,44977791,2015-08-30,6509080,Gaurav,Roger was great in responding quickly before I arrived and in coordinating my arrival. He gave me a lot of tips for my visit and was a lot of fun to talk to. The room was great and just what I was looking for. Fremont is also a really great area to explore and I would absolutely stay here again.
1593939,45628540,2015-09-04,42856972,James,"The description was accurate and I enjoyed my stay. Roger is a very gracious host, and the house is charming with convenient public transportation options. "

"
1593939,47749257,2015-09-21,27174361,Cate,I enjoyed my stay very much at Rogers. The laundry room was perfect for me! Roger was interesting and it was fun to get to know him.
1593939,48648336,2015-09-27,6437803,Stacey,"This is a comfortable room and location for visits to the Seattle area. Short walks to food, conveniences and transit. Easily accessible for those who would like to cook on their own as well. "
2060441,14593976,2014-06-23,9705227,Jacques,House was spacious and had a great location. Plenty of off street parking and comfortably slept ten people. Kitchen was fully stocked and free cable and internet. The house is better furnished then the pictures show and includes a small outdoor patio. 
2060441,16881207,2014-08-04,11486226,Matt,"Ian and his wife Jeanette were great hosts and I would definitely recommend them in the future. The location was great and the house had everything needed to make our stay comfortable. Two things to note: One was that the description listed 7 beds and there were only 6. This was a bit confusing at first, but Jeanette realized their error and updated the listing. Also, to their defense, I believe the original capacity for 12 people was accurate, just not the number of beds. Second, the house is off the street down a narrow drive. The tenants are not to park there so seemingly there shouldn't be a problem. However, a guest of mine drove in to load up his things to leave and accidentally backed into the neighbors house. While this was a pain for both myself and Ian, Ian and his wife were very gracious and we resolved the issue fairly quickly with Airbnb's help. "
2060441,18937492,2014-09-03,164058,Erik,"Nice house, cool neighborhood. Had everything we needed."
2060441,19365916,2014-09-11,6329580,Roger,I booked this house for a 3 day retreat with a team of 5 co - workers. It was a great venue to collaborate. 5 nice private bedrooms. A couple of kitchens and an outdoor patio with table and barbecue. The house is well stocked with appliances and utensils and everything you need and very clean. A short drive to the center of Ballard. Great experience. We were really happy with the home.
2060441,19594207,2014-09-15,17220273,Michael,"The house was as advertised, clean and well furnished.  Street parking was not a problem, just avoid parking under the trees; lots of pitch and bird residue.  Very satisfied, thank you."
2060441,36000416,2015-06-24,28126471,Gry,Ian and Jeanette were great hosts.  The house was spacious and clean and parking was not a problem.  We loved the patio and grill area.  The house is close enough to walk to Ballard and the Locks and it suited our needs perfectly.
2060441,36921363,2015-07-02,2663394,Andre,"The house was clean, spacious, and perfect for our needs! Thanks Ian!"
2060441,42103766,2015-08-11,15979542,Robert,Communication with the host was perfect.  I had several questions in the planning stages and they were very quick and thorough in responding.  There was a little barking dachshund next door that the neighbors let out in the daytime making it difficult to take a nap.  Otherwise it was all great.
2060441,45922496,2015-09-07,28070782,Reese,The house was fantastic and in a very central area close to local amenities.  Having two seperate self-contained areas was a bonus and street parking was not a problem.

6263270,44211499,2015-08-24,33934572,Dana,"Kristin and her husband greeted at their apartment - the place is hotel quality. Very modern and clean and looks as it does in the pictures. The location is great as it's walking distance to Pike Place Market and other city attractions. Neighborhood is very cool - great restaurants/bars, but a little seedy at night - the property is super secure so we felt fine getting back there. Tip: Be sure to double check how to use the lock - we were worried we were going to break it in the door. "
6263270,46632650,2015-09-12,3638705,Julie,"This condo was great. Looked just like the pictures. Very new, and clean, and well stocked for guests. Nice fluffy towels, shampoo, and all the amenities you would get at a hotel. Great building in a great location. Kristin and Ron were excellent hosts, gives us lots of tips for getting around, where to eat, etc. Ron even met us down at the Ferry. Lots of great restaurants and bars right there. Definitely would recommend! "
6263270,50175299,2015-10-10,37726229,Luciane,"This condo was the perfect stay for my husband and I. It looks exactly like the pictures and it's very clean and comfortable. It is much better than a hotel and has everything you need. I highly recommend Kristin's place to anyone going to Seattle. She met us when we arrived and showed us the condos amenities. We loved that the owners took care of every detail to make us feel at home. The location is the best! We didn't need to rent a car because most of the places we wanted to visit were with walking distance. We are very glad we chose the Belltown Condo for our Seattle trip! Thank you, Kristin!"

Quiet !! You feel just like at home 
Fluffy beds, relaxing Shower "
9394485,55144281,2015-11-28,1329711,Robert,Very nice house. Everything was very clean and well organized. Only stayed one night but would have enjoyed staying much longer. Didn't get a chance to meet Shannon but she communicated very well with us and could tell by the way she set up the house that she is a very conscientious person. Will definitely stay there again if we are in the area. 
7871807,44043231,2015-08-23,3240014,Miguel,Pepe is a great host – he really takes care of all the small details. Vella (their dog) is a great host too. Had a great time with this crew.
7871807,45860447,2015-09-06,3240014,Miguel,"Another amazing stay at Pepe's, Maddy's and Vella's. Second time I've airbnb'd with these fantastic hosts. Would definitely book their place again.  "
3394837,32364034,2015-05-17,31035386,Kevin,"Our stay at the Urban Condo was everything my friends and I could have asked for. We were politely greeted at the exact time we scheduled and was introduced to the very spacious apartment. All of the amenities were provided as described. The location is perfect for anyone who wants to explore downtown. Pike Place Market is down the street and Capitol Hill is just down the other way. My friends and I loved it and wish we can come back soon! 

P.S. if you book this place, make sure to check out the rooftop for a stellar view of the city!"
3394837,36039151,2015-06-24,34741730,Ryan,"It went well overall, we originally were set for this one bedroom but ended up getting a free upgrade to the two bedroom. The two bedroom was pretty spacious, clean, and had an amazing roof with a view of the whole city. Overall good experience. "
3394837,36357930,2015-06-28,25410932,Elizabeth,Location was excellent for all major attractions!
3394837,38368118,2015-07-15,6094025,Rachel,"This was a PERFECT spot to stay for a conference at the convention center. It was literally a five minute walk, which was really nice. 

I stayed here with two other girls, one took the couch bed, and the other two shared the king bed in the room. It was plenty of room for the three of us. We used Uber or Lyft to get anywhere we didn't feel like walking to, and each time, it was about $5. 

My friends checked in for us, and said the gentleman who met them was extremely nice and very welcoming. The apartment was super clean. We'd definitely stay here again and probably will try to for the same conference next year!"
3394837,42257279,2015-08-12,32387089,Chui,"Doug was outside the apartment building waiting for us. Therefore, we did not have to wait to get our keys, which was great. He explained the procedures (take out trash, how to run the dishwasher etc), and told us about the location of the nearby grocery store. The neighborhood was convenient to get to the convention center and Pike's Place Market. Dough also stopped by shortly before we left the apartment to check all's well. Overall, a good experience. "

"
3394837,50641718,2015-10-13,32007779,Larry,Rebecca was so helpful with the booking and Doug welcomed us and was very informative. Apartment is perfectly positioned for the convention center. Walkable everywhere and great for hitting the Capitol Hill district. Everything's right there.
2075094,9719659,2014-01-06,10090016,Maggie,"Annie’s home is located in a nice neighborhood and close to 
downtown with public transit, 5 mins walk to the bus stop and took 15 mins bus to downtown (Pike market, first Starbucks, Art museum, Nordstrom rack, etc.) We even tried to walk to downtown cost 1 hr and 30mins. The bungalow itself was cozy, clean, comfortable with nice view balcony and I loved cooking at her kitchen with her plenty type of spices! This is the first time I slept in a loft bed, it was fun experience for us. Annie herself is a delightful host, she was very communicative and we had great conversation of sharing our travel stories, her true life stories of adventure was unbelievable!  We stayed 7 days and I absolutely have no complaints. Highly recommend her lovely bungalow and we’ll definitely stay with her again next time!!
Annie 的房子在西雅图山上风景很不错的区域，走5分钟到公车站，坐15分钟公车到downtown，我们有一天尝试着走着去downtown用了一个半小时，路上看了Lake union的整个风景。Annie的房子很舒适，装饰的很艺术，阳台的风景很美，厨房里调料很多，住在这里很惬意。房间里是双人的上铺，就是晚上上洗手间有点麻烦，但是这是我第一次睡这样的床，所以还觉得挺有意思的。Annie是个很随意并且热情的姑娘，跟她相处可以很放松，我们一起分享了我们旅行的故事，她的故事都特别的有意思并且很惊险。总之很推荐来西雅图的朋友住在她家！"
2075094,11131112,2014-03-22,10843588,Sara,"Words cannot express what a great host Annie is. She is generous, patient and ever so funny. We loved spending time in her colorful home! Best parts: this street smells amazing in the springtime!! We could tell when we were almost home. The nighttime view of the city from the kitchen window makes my heart do flip flops. Love it! Thank you for making this such a wonderful first Airbnb experience, Annie!!"
2075094,12035831,2014-04-21,14340548,Bamboo,"Anna is such a pleasant person. I enjoyed talking to her. They have Sakura flowers in the front yard, really neat. Anna is an artist who make her own jewelries, her jewelry sells in Chihuly Glass & Garden, pretty neat. The bedroom has a loft bed, really basic, but the bed is super comfy. I slept like a baby at night. The bungalow is not super clean though, it will be so much better if the bathroom and the bedroom carpet are cleaner. But doesn't hurt if you are not very picky on that and if you don't stay long in your room. Neighborhood is good."
2075094,12169192,2014-04-24,963108,Nick,"Annie's place was fab - great views, good location, and Annie is a very creative and fun host."

Awesome balcony. 10 minutes away (walking distance) from pubs and restaurants in Fremont are."
2075094,14258872,2014-06-15,10079944,Bob,Annie's bohemian place was cute and has a great view of the valley below towards Seattle.  She was responsive and helpful in accommodating my late arrival and although we didn't meet due to my short stay all was good.  
2075094,14536710,2014-06-21,6387104,Nathan,I love this place! Annie is very nice. The bed is cozy. 
2075094,15022028,2014-06-30,15549750,Ramesh,"I had a great stay at Annie's cozy place. The bed is comfortable, the rest of the furnishing of the bedroom is basic but has all that's needed. The rest of the house is cozy and includes a terrasse with a beautiful view onto Downtown Seattle. Restaurants and coffee places are in walking distance. Annie's place is a great location for a longer stay than just one night (as I had).
And last but not least, Annie is is a fun, uncomplicated and charming host!
"
2075094,15519907,2014-07-10,5153603,Renganathan,"Living here and with Annie was a great experience. It felt more like home and having lived in the neighborhood before, it was a near perfect experience. Thanks Annie."
2075094,15658214,2014-07-13,5592782,Anne-Marie,"What can i say that hasn't already been said?  Annie is upfront, lovely, friendly, and very relaxed.  She is very accommodating and will help you in any way she can with whatever you need.  Her place is a clean old house; it definitely met my expectations, but as other reviews have pointed out, if you're looking for a perfect shiny pristine place, an older house or apartment will not be up your alley.  I was extremely happy and comfortable at Annie's place.  :) "
2075094,15739549,2014-07-14,15338767,Bryan,Annie was very flexible with my arrival and departure. We were able to have a nice chat about the merits of the neighborhood.  The home is in a great location for exploring the neighborhood of Fremont by foot.  I particularly liked the natural lighting and decor of the space.  
2075094,16035958,2014-07-20,963571,Aaron,"Annie was a fantastic host, and her home is stupid-comfortable.

The room was clean and comfortable. The back porch was the best part, and the calm kitchen table-turned-office came a close second. Would definitely like to stay again next time I need to come to Seattle."
2075094,16639646,2014-07-30,18112400,Eva,Yes - 
2075094,16868911,2014-08-03,18758400,Maria,"Annie was very welcoming and gave many good tips about the neighborhood.  Her place was quaint and the deck out back was relaxing.  It was a great location that allowed easy access to downtown.  We enjoyed our stay at Annie's place.
"
2075094,19254965,2014-09-08,19668461,Laurie,We had a great time at Annies' house. There are so many fun things to look at. It was really nice sitting outside on the terrace in the evening. Thanks for having us!
2075094,19582976,2014-09-14,21186387,Emily,"We needed a place and last minute Annie accepted us. Although we never met her, Annie was very accommodating. Bathroom and kitchen supplies were well stocked. Her space was well decorated in a quaint neighborhood in Fremont. My cousin and I shared a room with a grown up bunk bed. We spent our evenings hanging out on her porch and relaxing. "
2075094,20394760,2014-09-28,21617983,Kathy,"The Artist Bungalow was the perfect place for my weekend getaway from Alaska.  After some delicious Thai food in Fremont, I checked in to the Artist Bungalow, dropped off my bags and found live music within minutes of driving in Fremont.   The Artist Bungalow accommodations were clean, view fantastic and the vibe was casual and friendly.  Double love the location and sense of calm in the house.  Kathy"
2075094,21271273,2014-10-13,21596052,Dan,"We did not meet Annie on this trip, but found her place to be just as described, and perfect for us. Great walking to Fremont and Wallingford, easy downtown bus ride. And a lovely balcony!"
2075094,22567863,2014-11-09,20640343,Natalie,"Anne made everything the most convenient for the guest. The house is in a great location, nice space, had all amenities I needed, very clean. 
I loved the artwork throughout the house.
Will definitely stay there again and higgle recommend to others."
2075094,23078755,2014-11-22,19108090,Cristina,"I couldn't have picked a better place to stay in Seattle. Annie's place was beautifully decorated and in the center of everything. Excellent view of the city from her balcony. Great artwork by the way, we had a blast looking at it all. Absolutely  no problems during our visit. Thank you for everything!"
2075094,26230142,2015-02-07,26596137,Marlene,"Annie's place was a great haven with a warm and welcoming feeling, I felt instantly comfortable. She seems like such and strong and wonderful woman and her home and personality exude that. "
2075094,27691586,2015-03-09,28558781,Alex,"Fantastic place, very welcoming host. Left out delicious tea for us in the morning. Room was well-equipped and beds were comfy. Super cute neighborhood with great views of downtown. Sitting on the deck in the morning sun was quite memorable! "
2075094,28966128,2015-04-01,13096314,Mary,"Annie's home is so cozy and in a perfect location- walking distance to Fremont and Wallingford downtown areas. Annie is a lovely host, and I had a great stay! I would highly recommend Annie and the Fremont bungalow :) "
2075094,30449705,2015-04-22,27128168,Dale,"Annie is a detail-oriented, easygoing, generous host. She was quite flexible about both my check-in and check-out times. And upon my arrival, despite a busy schedule, she made time to greet me and make sure I had everything I needed. She also give me an upgrade to a charming, tasteful, spacious private kitchenette downstairs that had its own bathroom, porch, and private entrance, since the room I had paid for was not ready. And then there were all the little thoughtful touches, like food in the kitchen--oatmeal, sipping chocolate, tea, honey, milk, pasta, etc, as well as the bathroom that was stocked with things I may have forgotten, like toothpaste, shampoo, mouthwash, etc. The neighborhood was both residential and lush with greenery and a wide variety of restaurants and a supermarket within about half a mile's walking distance. I felt very safe there even at night. I thoroughly enjoyed my first time in Seattle, using her home as a convenient base. I would definitely stay there again. "
2075094,33886662,2015-06-01,17058460,Rachel,"Unfortunately Annie wasn't home during my stay, but she made sure everything was ready for me. Her house is very cute, complete with creaky floor boards and a beautiful view from the kitchen and the back sun room. Plus the location can't be beat!"
2075094,35482588,2015-06-19,2282115,Kathy,"I picked Annie's place for two reasons: it was walking distance of my work in Fremont, and I wanted to cook my own dinners. For both, it worked out great. Annie wasn't around much, but we did cross paths the first night. She gave me a little tour, although by then I'd already read her excellent welcoming instructions.

I used the lower bed, which was comfortable. She supplies ear plugs and says she uses them herself, but I didn't bother to. I never heard the people who were downstairs, although I suspect they heard me walking around, since the floors in the bedroom are a bit creaky.

The house is old, with an old house's beauty and quirks. The shower worked well but drained slowly, as her note said it might. The wifi seemed flakey in the bedroom (it took a few tries to connect) but might have been fine elsewhere. (I didn't need to rely on it.) Annie's personality shines through in the art on the walls and the books on the shelves—fun and interesting! The back porch, with its view, is a wonderful place to relax and eat.

All in all, this is a great place to stay, and Annie is a communicative, gracious host."
2075094,35869848,2015-06-22,22691507,Ellie Lei,"A very serene and beautiful house to stay, love Annie's fun taste in decor. Fremont is a neighborhood with chic, laid-back vibe--would love to back here in the future! "
2075094,37815592,2015-07-10,37700832,Cabrach,Annie made us feel right at home from the time we arrived.  The location is terrific--walking distance to everything in the heart of Fremont and easy access to Aurora.  A highlight is the sunny porch next to the back deck.  
2075094,38456336,2015-07-15,38008488,Karolína,I really enjoyed staying at Annie's place - it's a charming house in a calm neighborhood. Annie was really welcoming and made sure I had everything I needed.
2075094,38575873,2015-07-16,2083804,Brandon,Great place. Easy solution to my lodging problems. Would definitely stay again.
2075094,40513563,2015-07-31,10232323,Lina,We stayed three nights in Annie's lovely bungalow. Beautiful neighbourhood. Annie was a great host and we would stay there again.
2075094,41260517,2015-08-05,312655,Joshua,"Fantastic, clean, quirky: very, very Fremont in the best of ways. Annie's place is lovely and has lots of greenery and great views. Easy walking access to Fremont. Super friendly and organized host, who it turns out went to the same high school as me. Awesome AirBnB coincidence."
2075094,48017418,2015-09-22,3783894,Carolyn,"I was so excited to find a place to stay only a few blocks from where my son now lives -- not only did it make it convenient for both of us, but I got to feel like I was part of the neighborhood, living where he lived. I could walk to his place and we walked or biked to so many  great breakfast, lunch and dinner places. And the house was so charming and welcoming. Thanks to Annie for responding right away to all my inquiries! "
2075094,49579107,2015-10-04,4720344,Ian,We had a lovely stay in Annie's house. The house was in a great location and walking distance to most of Fremont. We booked at short notice and Annie was very accommodating. Thank you!!

With peace,
Gretchen and Joe."
6973790,42310824,2015-08-12,36478993,Corey,"Easy walking distance to pretty much everything. Great base camp location to explore everything you want

The place: great that Emma includes a parking pass/garage easy to get in and out of . Check in was smooth and she was accommodating to check in early. 2 couples stayed. Bed and pullout couch comfortable. Decor and furniture was nice.

Location/places visited: location was great to walk everywhere. Emma's recommendations were on spot. Ate lunch at local 360 was great.  Breakfast at macrina bakery. Steelhead diner for dinner is a must great seafood. Lowells for clam chowder.  Best place for drinks happy hour bath tub gin company

Only negative on everything is our apartment was definitely hot to sleep. A/c from the window is on the bedroom side and does not circulate air very well throughout the entire apartment. The fan made it a little more comfortable

Also one of our party members left their glasses at the location after already checking out. Emma was great in responding and getting them mailed back to their house!"
6973790,44510241,2015-08-26,782552,Ernest,"Fantastic place to stay. We've stayed in Seattle a lot but this was our first Seattle AirBNB and it far exceeded any nice hotel. It was cozy, clean and Emma was a delight to work with. Her recommendations were perfect. Loved the bakery on the same block. Anyway we will be back!!

"
6973790,47654075,2015-09-21,29292850,Emily,"Perfect location! It's walking distance to Pikes Place and a lot of great restaurants and bars. The apartment was clean and comfortable and several amenities were provided. Emma was easy to communicate with, she responded quickly and was very accommodating. "
6973790,48155117,2015-09-23,16312557,Peter,"I was in Seattle on business and have wanted to stay in Belltown. Emma's place is PERFECTLY located. I walked everywhere. It is an easy stroll to get anywhere you want in the downtown area. I didn't have a car this trip, BUT there is secured parking included with the place which would be a big extra benefit if you had a car 

Emma's place is exactly as pictured and very comfortable- bed, chairs, table etc. and it was nicely appointed. Tastefully done. I worked in the evenings and it was just like working at home. I could be in the easy chair, couch or at the table (actually all 3) and the internet was fast. 

The welcome book with instructions was clear and there were great nearby restaurant recommendations. I would recommend it and will likely stay there again. "
6973790,49870827,2015-10-06,5912331,John,"Excellent place, great location, very comfortable, easy to get into and the hosts were excellent.  They were able to accommodate a last minute stay.  Would highly recommend Emma's place!"

6973790,53260554,2015-11-07,3620672,Joseph,"Emma was great. We didn't require much of her, but she was very accommodating when we arrived to check in. The apartment is real nice, looks just like the pictures, very clean.

Location was great. In walking distance of all the tourist attractions in Seattle. Walk one direction and you can see the Space Needle, EMP Museum, Chihuly Garden; walk the other direction and you can see Pike's Place Market, the stadiums, etc."
6973790,56026278,2015-12-08,32842231,Rhonda,Great location and place to stay on a trip to Seattle. The condo had everything needed and extra supplies on site . We were there during extremely rainy weather so the parking was great because we left the area and went places but would love to come back when the weather is nice and explore closer by on foot ... 
6973790,56379498,2015-12-13,11984633,Logan,Excellent location. Greatly suited my needs. Good internet and nice shower. We enjoyed the pool. Would stay here again. 
6659301,35411698,2015-06-18,2896980,Sam,Eric was a perfect host. We booked last minute and he was super accommodating. His place is great. The apartment is big and comfy and has lots of light. It is walking distance to all the great stuff to do in Capitol Hill. Would definitely stay here again. Thanks Eric!
6659301,35709329,2015-06-21,35004016,Matthew,Eric was very friendly and welcoming and responded quickly to my messages. When we got there he had everything set up and ready for us to feel right at home. The place had everything we needed and was very clean and neat. It is located on a quiet street and is conveniently located a few blocks from some really fantastic restaurants and shops in the CapHill area. I would definitely look to stay here on subsequent trips to Seattle. 
6659301,39137785,2015-07-20,35669971,Franny,Eric was extremely accommodating to us. He got the place ready at last minute's notice and even left us snacks. The apartment Is awesome and exactly as described - great location and very quiet. We never had to move our car because we could walk everywhere we wanted to go. My 18-year-old daughter wants to live there!
6659301,40159327,2015-07-28,24268518,Joan,"Eric was very warm and welcoming. He was in constant contact and was receptive to helping with anything I may need.

The building is perfectly located a block off the action on Cap Hill, but the street is quiet and safe.  I recommend Eric's rental!  "

He was very kind and left us a it some snacks and wine, made sure we knew where the local spots were, and was overall very accommodating.   The house is in a great location close to all the sights you'd want to see. Stay here, you won't regret it!"

The Queen Anne area is absolutely beautiful and conveniently close to so many Seattle attractions.  Not only were all of these features perfect for us but on top of it all what really made this a fantastic experience is that we were able to bring our cat with us.  They were very welcoming of her which made the challenge of having to bring her especially helpful. We definitely plan on going back!"
2267088,11119045,2014-03-21,13034615,Pauline,"This was a great little suite for our family with 2 little kids.  A truly fully equipped kitchen and helpful host. The neighborhood is full of beautiful, unique homes and it's near many amenities. We liked the ability to go down to the walkway by the water and then walk across the Fremont draw bridge to explore more little shops and cafes."
2267088,11194004,2014-03-24,823819,Elsa,"The space is sunny and clean, with beautiful art and comfortable beds, in a safe and scenic neighborhood. Barbara and Michael are lovely, gracious hosts who immediately made us feel welcome. Upon our arrival, they even provided our 2 year-old with milk in a cute little elephant cup, and introduced her to some wonderful toys. We wish that we could have stayed longer, as it felt like a home away from home."
2267088,11356331,2014-03-31,12165808,"Manuel, Debbie And Justin","A real find for SPU parents!  Debbie, Justin (our college student), and I enjoyed our time in this super convenient and very clean apartment.  Loved the lay out and the off-street parking.  Plus walking to campus was a breeze - only about 2 minutes.  Barbara, Michael, and Max were wonderful hosts-making sure we were comfortable and had everything we needed. There were so many extra ""nice little touches"", it felt just like home!  We liked it so much we booked it again for next month.  "

This is the second time I have stayed in the garden apartment and it was just as convenient and cozy as the first visit.  Queen Anne is fast becoming one of my favorite places, love the coffee shops and the restaurants. On Saturday and Sunday morning, our son, Justin, walked over from his dorm at SPU and had breakfast with me. Thanks to the great hosts who stocked the fridge with bread, eggs and milk so I was able to make french toast.   I am trying to come up with another reason I can go back again..."

2267088,12831336,2014-05-12,2826592,Aaron And Annelize,"Michael and Barbara were very friendly and accommodating.  The apartment had everything we needed for a great stay in Seattle, they even provided a crib and changing table for our infant, and provided breakfast items in the fridge!  They were very informative of the city, and gave us great restaurants tips.  I highly recommend them to anybody looking for a great place to stay, with lots of privacy and in a great location to the city.  We will definitely use this accommodation again for our future Seattle trips.  "
2267088,13079778,2014-05-19,11055999,David,"We really enjoyed our stay here. Michael was a great host and very friendly and helpful. The unit is very clean and functional and has everything you need for a short or a longer stay. It is roomy, comfortable, very nice. There is off street parking for one car which is very helpful. If you are needing to be at SPU this is absolutely perfect. It would also be great as a home base for exploring the Seattle area. Highly recommended. "
2267088,18835480,2014-09-01,20130157,Doug,"We were a little worried, having had no experience with airbnb to date,  however, I can recommend this location easily, as Michael and Barbara were excellent ambassadors for airbnb.  Prompt and courteous in all communication, they made adding a day to our stay a smooth/easy transaction and Michael put us at ease from the moment he greeted us and took the time to show us the space.  The off street parking spot was right outside the door to the unit so loading and unloading the car was easy.  The unit was relaxing, quiet, clean and peaceful enough that our cat was immediately put at ease and was ready to explore the whole place without needing any time to get acclimated.   The unit is within walking distance to the Sunday Market and the PCC, as well as all those sweet little shops, etc, in Fremont. There were unexpected, nice touches inside the unit as well- like fresh oriental lilies on the dining table and organic peanut butter, organic oatmeal, etc, stocked in the kitchen.  We enjoyed staying here and would do so again.

2267088,19927870,2014-09-21,14254026,Sue,"Barbara and MIchael were really excellent hosts. They were absolutely striving to do their best to accomodate us. They even started us with a few breakfast items in the fridge and bread and cereal so we didn't have to worry about grocery shopping the night we arrived. The communication process was really smooth and Barbara checked in with us via texts on a regular basis to make sure we had everything we needed. The apartment is really spacious which I hadn't really anticipated as it looks smaller in the pictures I believe. The king bed is amazing too. The place was very well stocked and very clean. There is a laundry area too which we got to use. The area in which the house is situated is amazing, fairly close to downtown in a very quiet a quaint neighbourhood with a nice view of Fremont from the patio which we enjoyed on a few sunny days. All in all I would highly recommend staying with Barbara and MIchael. If you have never been to Seattle before they will also gladly provide you with information about the city, what to see and where to go.
Thank you Barbara and Michael for an excellent last week in Seattle."
2267088,20856674,2014-10-06,225658,Deb,"Barbara and Michael were gracious, knowledgeable about Seattle and the apartment was perfect for our three nights! My daughter and I enjoyed the spacious layout and cool Jacuzzi type tub! We felt 'at home' and would stay there again :)"
2267088,21093065,2014-10-11,7743392,Jinie,"We loved this comfortable and clean apartment in Queen Anne. A true 'home away from home' with two spacious bedrooms and beds, a living room and full kitchen. It's also very close to Trader Joe's if you want groceries. Barbara was in touch and very informative about the neighborhood as well. We would stay here again. "
2267088,21197938,2014-10-13,17875891,Caren,"Wonderful stay with Barbara & Michael!!  This was our first use of Airbnb and they have set a pretty high standard.  Apt is spacious, immaculate and exactly as described.  Barbara kept in touch and welcomed us warmly.  It was so nice having the ""basics"" in the refrigerator so when we got up in the morning we didn't have to wonder what we were going to do for breakfast.  It was a perfect location (near the Fremont district & the marina).  

We will definitely be back and stay with Barbara & Michael, as we have relatives nearby and this worked out perfectly.   It gave us the ability to see what it is like to live in Seattle, instead of just feeling like a tourist."
2267088,21503264,2014-10-19,14613873,Julie Ann,Barbara and Michael are wonderful hosts!  This was our second visit and we plan on staying here for our future visits to the Queen Anne area.
2267088,21880535,2014-10-26,6298094,John,"Looking for a Seattle rental? Look no more! The top three things about this rental are 1. the hosts, 2. the space, 3. the location. The hosts: (Barbara and Michael) have hospitality down to a T. We had a quick introduction with Barbara, which was lovely, and then were able to get  questions we didn't even know we had answered through the helpful materials they had supplied within the unit. I appreciated the check-in text that she sent me during our visit as it was nice to know someone was available in case I had a Seattle question. The space: This unit is awesome! The kitchen was more than equipped with everything we needed (including coffee!) and the added touch of rolls/jam/eggs in the fridge was extremely thoughtful and appreciated! The living space was quite comfortable, plenty of seating for our party of 4. The bedrooms are HUGE! It was nice to not be tripping over suitcases. I appreciated the fact that I could unpack my things and not have to keep digging through my luggage. The beds were the right levels of firm/softness and the temperature throughout the unit was great. We are from Arizona and big babies when it comes to cold...we never felt cold in the unit even though it was cold outside. I was a little concerned about sharing one bathroom, but there are enough mirrors in the bedrooms that we were able to share the space easily and use the mirrors in our individual bedrooms for the female primping. It was quite nice to know we had a designated parking spot to come back to and didn't have to fight it out on the city streets. After being caught in a rain storm it was much appreciated that I could throw our jackets/hoodies in the dryer instead of hoping they would dry out for the next day. The location: we had friends that stayed in a hotel that missed out on the unique layout of the city. We were able to explore varying areas of the city and get back to the unit with ease. There are so many services in the neighborhood, that with better weather, we could have walked to. We found plenty of local eateries, a local Scandinavian bakery, and of course local bars. We 110% had a fantastic visit and will most definitely stay here again on our next Seattle trip!"
2267088,22245637,2014-11-02,11103482,Tim,"Barbara and Michael were great hosts to work with. I had family coming into town so we needed some extra space and their 2 bedroom apartment worked perfectly for us! Barbara was very flexible in our check in and check out times and we loved the space! There is a Roku box connected to the TV which makes it very easy to watch Netflix and Hulu and they had a carton of eggs, English muffins, and a carton of milk in the fridge for us for breakfast. Location is great as long as you have a car, downtown is only a few minutes away and Upper Queen Anne is just a quick drive down the road. I would definitely recommend this spot to anyone visiting Seattle!"
2267088,22532100,2014-11-09,5168221,Jylian,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Barbara and Michael's. We were in Seattle attending Oprah's ""The Life You Want Weekend"" and found this location perfect. Just a short bus ride and we were at Seattle Centre. The suite was ideal; well stocked for all our needs. Even fresh coffee beans and grinder.
Having two private bedrooms with amazingly comfortable beds was such a treat.
Barbara was very accommodating and super helpful.
We highly recommend this suite and would certainly stay there again.

2267088,25923505,2015-01-30,2638621,Angelo,"Barbara ci ha accolti nel miglior modo possibile. La casa è deliziosa e completa di tutti i confort. Abbiamo anche trovato tutto l'indispensabile per la prima colazione. Il problema è che ci siamo innamorati di Seattle, e ancor più di Queen Anne... non vediamo l'ora di ritornarci!"
2267088,26125849,2015-02-04,14613873,Julie Ann,Barbara and Michael are gracious hosts.  The accommodations are very clean and it is a quiet place to stay. I look forward to being a guest of theirs again.

Barbara was there to greet me when I arrived.  She spent an hour with me telling me about the house, showing me things in the kitchen and giving me tips for restaurants in the area."
2267088,26652807,2015-02-16,27245023,Z,我们非常开心能入住Barbara And Michael的房子，房间很好，沐浴房很棒！她们还为我们准备了一些食物。更让我们感动的是，因为我们在旧金山出了意外，不能按期到达，她们主动为我们延期一天，充满了友好和关爱❤️Barbara And Michael Thanks again
2267088,27274133,2015-03-01,27183702,Christine,"We were very happy with Barbara and Michael, the perfect host. The breakfast items left in the fridge were very much a surprise and very appreciated since we arrived later in the evening.  The suite was spacious and suited our needs.  The neighborhood is very quiet and right in the middle of were we wanted to be."
2267088,27762024,2015-03-11,4940198,Cris,"We could not have been happier with this apartment and with Barbara and Michael, who are great and gracious hosts!   An incredibly well equipped kitchen, with all the essentials (spices, olive oil, sugar) we needed for the meal we cooked there.   There were lots of tasty things for breakfast--milk and oj, teas and coffer (and grinder!), english muffins plus butter and jam and peanut butter, eggs,and cereal.  The beds were very comfortable and the apt is well located yet quiet.  Extra benefit to have washer, dryer, and parking place!!  We would definitely recommend to others.  Thanks Barbara and Michael for making our stay in Seattle so comfortable!     "
2267088,28254695,2015-03-21,27006420,Jena,"The garden apartment was great in so many ways. It is completely private, well equipped with washer/dryer, kitchen needs a great bathroom and great internet options for watching tv. The hosts are very knowledgeable about the area and offer helpful tips on what to see and do. Plus I felt like they really cared about us. "
2267088,28698027,2015-03-29,12165808,"Manuel, Debbie And Justin","Home sweet home! This was our fourth stay in this charming garden apartment! Barbara welcomed us when we first arrived and provided wonderful breakfast goodies including coffee, cereal, butter, eggs and other items. We always feel so comfortable in this home and love the Queen Anne neighborhood! Being one block from SPU, our son's school, makes it a perfect location for a family get away. Thanks Barbara and Michael for another great vacation! Hope to see you soon! "
2267088,30071165,2015-04-17,21309069,Sarah,"Barbara and Michael's apartment was just perfect for our needs ( a family of 4).  In a fabulous location within easy walking distance to the Queen Anne shops and further to the city (its not that far and the views are fabulous!).

Barbara kept in contact with me in the days leading up to our arrival and made some really helpful suggestions about places to go in Seattle and to eat locally.

The apartment was extremely comfortable, especially the beds, and the fridge was equipped with coffee, tea, organic milk, cereal, English muffins, eggs, butter and more for breakfast. Everything you would need to cook for yourselves is also provided.

The TV is internet based so we had access to Amazon, Netflix etc which was useful. It was also very good having access to a washing machine and dryer.

This is a great place and I would happily return if I find myself back in Seattle.

Thanks Barbara and Michael. "
2267088,30554145,2015-04-24,28869505,Kelly,"When I arrived at Barbara and Michael's home, Barbara greeted me and showed me around the apartment. It was spotlessly clean and very comfortable. The backyard area had a great view of the Fremont neighborhood and would have been a great place to sit on a warm day, but it was a bit too chilly for us to do that during our stay. The kitchen was stocked with English muffins, jam, and coffee -- a perk we did not expect but definitely enjoyed and appreciated. The apartment also had tons of extra towels, blankets, and pillows. 

There were four people total in our party, and we all slept comfortably. Five people would be doable here, but I wouldn't add more than that. 

The location was also great -- this is a quiet, charming neighborhood that's far enough away to give you a taste of life outside the downtown hubbub, but close enough that you're not paying $30 for an Uber ride every time you visit something more touristy. 

All in all, we loved staying at this charming, clean Queen Anne home and would heartily recommend it. "
2267088,30791681,2015-04-27,19136158,Anne,Barbara and Michael were wonderful hosts! The listing is exactly as described and the place was super clean. The neighborhood is wonderful and quiet. This was my first airbnb experience and they were great. Definitely recommend if you plan to visit Seattle.
2267088,31163202,2015-05-03,25907622,Sagi,"Barbara and Michael are the most pleasant. All went smooth, reliable and pleasant. Place is clean, hosts very gracious and nice. Place is quiet, located in the most beautiful location. Barbara prepared map , bus routes and schedule for us without us asking. They left us a few things as welcome that served us for breakfast and made us feel at home. Top Hosts!   If we ever in Seattle again , no question we'll prefer to stay with you. "
2267088,31933975,2015-05-12,27018446,Dave,"Barbara and Michael were great hosts and provided everything we needed for a fun stay in the Queen Anne district and surrounding Seattle area. The quiet area and views from the back deck area were great and we really loved Sammy their pup! They were able to make some great suggestions for food and entertainment as well as a quick primer on where to catch the local bus service for our daily trips into Seattle City center. This saved us a lot of money in parking fees (and avoided some thick traffic) and allowed us to see a different side of the city as well. They provided lots of information, flyers, and travel books for us to use while there. The home was cute and cozy, plenty of room for the 5 adults we traveled with. The house was well appointed and we had everything we needed. Besides the bus access to the city, from this location we walked across the canal bridge to the Fremont district for all they had to offer, a really fantastic spot for exploring this area! Thanks for everything!!!!"
2267088,32232141,2015-05-16,8380837,Ben,"Barbara was very welcoming, the place was immaculately clean. Our host even a supplied us with eggs, bagels, jam, milk and coffee etc. to use during our stay. 

Four of us stayed in the unit and the beds were clean and very comfy. 

Barbara was always available for information and very accommodating. She has a wealth of local knowledge and was quick to offer us a list of activities or dining options. 

We had a fantastic time and will definitely be staying here again next time. "
2267088,32674704,2015-05-20,10947612,Katherine,I sent a list of specific logistics questions which Barbara answered in time for us to make travel plans.  We notified her via text message when we were on our way to the apartment.  The location was good - a comfortable distance from downtown but easily accessible by bus or taxi.
2267088,33350185,2015-05-27,25609220,Ben,"Nice and quiet location.   Very close to almost everything we like to do in Seattle..  This venue had a red informational book; it is very thorough and if one of our party had any questions, I would have them look in the book.  :-)"
2267088,33764157,2015-06-01,15528439,Marie Et Christophe,"Petite perle à Seattle! Ce logement nous a séduit aussi bien de part sa situation que l accueil généreux de nos hôtes. 
Rez de villa spacieux, très propre, en pleine nature avec un superbe jardin.
Excellente situation, quartier très paisible. 
Nos hôtes ont été très prévenants sans être envahissants et plein de bons conseils que nous avons suivi.
Si nous avons la chance de pouvoir retourner à Seattle, la question du logement est réglée!!!"
2267088,34047397,2015-06-04,5642473,Julie,"Barbara couldn't have been more welcoming.  She thoughtfully provided everything that might be needed during our stay, even breakfast items so we could have a quick meal the next day before sight seeing. The apartment itself was very warm and truly felt like our home while we were in Seattle. The walk in tub was fantastic! Barbara provided many great tips as well as material on Seattle which we gratefully used. The location as well as the apartment was beautiful and Barbara was lovely - we couldn't have asked for a better experience  and will be staying here again."
2267088,34287393,2015-06-07,29996263,Troy,Michael and Barbara have a very nice apartment. It is clean and well kept. It is very comfortable. The Queen Anne neighborhood is wonderful with friendly people and breath taking yards. The streets are narrow so don't bring your large car or truck
2267088,34928245,2015-06-14,22194231,Carol,"We had an awesome experience staying at Michael and Barbara's apartment. It was clean, comfortable, well-supplied and very conveniently located--loved having a parking spot and access to the laundry. The hosts are thoughtful and were a pleasure to meet."
2267088,35644115,2015-06-21,29234056,Jennifer,Michael was there to greet us when we arrived and show us around the apartment. We met Barbara later in our stay. They both made us  feel very welcome and had wonderful advice about Seattle. The apartment was very well maintained and fit all our needs. It was a great home away from home for the 4 nights we were there. We especially loved the little patio area. Plus they had some food available to get us started when we arrived which we really appreciated. The neighborhood was great with several places to eat and get groceries. We had a wonderful stay! 
2267088,36174896,2015-06-26,30507598,Leah,"A perfect spot for our family of 4. The apt. was exactly as described and had all the amenities to make us feel at home. The neighborhood is quiet, clean and within walking distance to many great restaurants, cafes, shops etc..... Also very close to the main tourist attractions in Seattle. Barbara met us when we arrived and showed us the place. I definitely will recommend Queen Anne to my family and friends. Beautiful weather and beautiful city! Thanks...."
2267088,37128026,2015-07-05,68603,Jennifer,"It was my pleasure to stay with Barbara and Michael! The unit was perfect for our group. It was great to have a kitchen to cook in-- and three separate beds. 

Barbara and Michael ensured that we knew the layout of Upper Queen Anne and where all the best local spots were. "
2267088,37727212,2015-07-10,3391835,Carolyn,"The place was great, Close to everything we wanted to do. There was food there for us when we got there, that was nice. The walk in bathtub/ shower was really nice. We had a really good time. Barbara an Michael were great. "

Michael was so friendly, spending the time to give us directions to restaurants and orient us to what the neighborhood has to offer.
We loved the neighborhood! Close enough to walk to all sorts of restaurants and we had gorgeous evening walks through the neighborhood."
2267088,38686707,2015-07-18,21166691,Martin,Barbara und Michael empfingen uns mit offenen Armen. Die Unterkunft liegt ruhig aber doch stadtnah (mit dem Bus ca 15 min zum Centrum). Sie ist sehr konfortabel eingerichtet und blitzblank sauber. Barbara und Michael waren sehr hilfreich für die Tourenplanung in Seattle und am Ende machten sie uns noch ein tolles Geschenk. Wir würden jederzeit gerne  wiederkommen
2267088,39273956,2015-07-22,31803666,Monica,"We had a wonderful experience ! Barbara greeted us upon arrival, gave us a tour and answered any questions we had. She had a red binder full of helpful information about the area including bus routes , restaurant recommendations and grocery shops. The accommodations were immaculate , spacious and well supplied. They even supplied breakfast items such as muffins, eggs, milk, coffee and teas!! We highly recommend this listing and we will return! "
2267088,39729646,2015-07-26,12955079,Melissa,Michael and Barbara were great hosts! The apartment was very comfortable and made our stay in Seattle very relaxing. We had a great time! The parking spot was very convenient! 
2267088,45051370,2015-08-31,18190118,Nikki & Dennis,"This was one of those amazing experiences where awesome hosts, in an adorable apartment, in a fantastic neighborhood, in a wonderful city all came together.  We stayed here for a month and as full-time travelers, this is our favorite rental!

The apartment:  We arrived to a clean, comfortable, tastefully decorated apartment fully equipped for our month long stay.  Everything we needed was provided and more!  Ample breakfast items to get us started awaited us:  teas, coffee, eggs, orange juice, bread, cereal, milk, fresh flowers…. The apartment had great natural lighting and was easy to open up to cool summer morning breezes.  We slept well at night; it was very quiet and the beds were comfortable.  There is a beautiful outdoor patio area where we enjoyed morning coffee.  A true gem!

The hosts:  Barbara and Michael have perfected the art of hosting.  They warmly greeted us upon arrival and were a wealth of information about the area throughout our stay.  Our time in Seattle would not have been the same without them.  Not only are they fantastic hosts, they are down-to-earth good people and a pleasure to chat with.  They even remembered my husband’s 50th b-day and brought a gift.  Yet, they also were respectful of our privacy and would text us, so as to not disturb us by knocking on the door, when they needed to contact us for things like cleaning and changing the bed linens and towels weekly.  Hospitality at its finest.  Thank you Barbara and Michael for everything!

The neighborhood:  Aside from historic, hilltop charm, this neighborhood is a runner’s/biker’s dream!  A 0.4 mile walk (through a beautiful college campus) leads to the Ship Canal Trail which connects to the Burke-Gilman Trail.  These trails offer 30+ miles of traffic-free, mostly flat, running/biking bliss.  We also used this trail to access downtown by biking to Lake Union Park (bike racks at MOHAI), then walking into downtown.  Closer to the apartment is Queen Anne Street where there are two grocery stores less than 1 mile away (Trader Joe’s & Safeway) and a plethora of restaurants, coffee houses and shops. We had our car, but rarely used it because everything was so accessible by foot or bike.  There is also a bus stop close by.  During evening strolls, we met some of the neighbors:  Max, Gary, and Keyoo.  They were all great sources of info and conversation.  Very friendly neighborhood.

All in all, this is our favorite rental and I would HIGHLY recommend it!  Great apartment, great hosts, great neighborhood...it doesn't get better than this!
"
2267088,45779551,2015-09-06,35563092,Justin,Barbara and Michael were very helpful and informative. The neighborhood was a great place to use as a base for exploring both Queen Anne and Fremont. Both neighborhoods are really great places to explore in Seattle. The place was very clean and the hosts were awesome!
2267088,46570699,2015-09-12,21955341,Peter,Barbara was the perfect host she made us so welcome.The apparment was even better than we thought it would (website hidden) was in a good area to get around also for food (website hidden) we were going onto a cruise from Seattle it was great to be able to use the washing machine.
2267088,47958591,2015-09-22,14613873,Julie Ann,Barbara and Michael are excellent hosts.  I have stayed with them previously and they have such a welcoming way about them.  The location is quiet and the accommodations are very clean.  I look forward to visiting again.
2267088,48273686,2015-09-25,25233766,Doug,"Wow. There are hardly words to describe our very wonderful stay at this convenient Queen Anne apartment. Barbara seems to have thought of everything - yes everything, you migh need as part of your stay. We felt at home after a very busy day of orientation for our daughter at SPU. We will definitely be a repeat guest at this property. Thank you to the hosts."
2267088,48685135,2015-09-28,2100391,Julie,"The location was superb; fast and easy access to downtown, Lake Union, Woodland Park Zoo, Capital Hill, etc. Barbara was extremely kind, informative, and a wonderful host. The basement apartment is quite spacious. Both bedrooms are rather large. The back patio is really  a small concrete in the driveway, but it is a nice extension. The back is not fenced in, so this makes it tough for little ones or pets (if latter are allowed). All in all, this place is an exceptional value. You couldn't ask for better hosts."
2267088,49434219,2015-10-04,36866617,Gretchen,We had a wonderful stay!  Michael and Barbara have a beautiful home in an equally beautiful neighborhood. Within walking distance of Queen Anne Ave where there are lots of quaint restaurants and shops. I would stay again and definitely recommend booking this home!
2267088,51105563,2015-10-18,22549724,Ed,Barbara was a very accommodating host. The place is in a nice neighbourhood close to everything that we were interested. 
2267088,53244631,2015-11-07,31384251,Margot,Staying with Barbara and Michael was a real pleasure. They are both very kind and helpful and they make sure they tell you about the nicest places in the neighborhood. The house was very clean as well. We had a wonderful stay!
2267088,53958906,2015-11-15,7251953,Deirdre,"Barbara and Michael were superb hosts, very warm and friendly, and very concerned about our comfort during our stay; if there was something we needed not already provided, or directions/advice about Seattle they unstintingly took the time necessary to make things clear and understood. Their apartment was clean and neat and comfortable, had virtually everything we needed for a restful, enjoyable stay. Barbara and Michael obviously love Seattle, love being hosts, and this was reflected in how they approached us and providing for our visit. We unhesitatingly recommend them, with the highest marks, and look forward to our next trip to Seattle and (hopefully) stay with them."
2267088,56204166,2015-12-10,6741881,Eric,We found everything very comfortable! Clean. Kitchen had food on arrival. Nice neighborhood. 
2267088,56590620,2015-12-15,18169968,Linda,"The apartment was great, exactly as described, and Barbara and Michael were good hosts.  They met us when we arrived, and showed us around.  They were easy to contact and always quick to respond.

There was a lot of information in the apartment about the neighborhood and transportation options, including maps.  Barbara had ideas for walking routes for us, as well as buses to use.  The living room/dining room was very cozy and nice to lounge around.  The beds were top notch.  Everything was spotless.  The kitchen was well equipped and the hosts had thoughtfully included some breakfast food including milk, juice, eggs, muffins, and most important - coffee and tea!

For me, the best part of the apartment was the neighborhood.  It was an easy walk to a variety of coffee shops, restaurants, and small boutiques.  The buses were very convenient and easy to figure out.  The neighborhood itself is full of beautiful old houses with well-kept gardens, and it was especially nice to walk after dark with all the Christmas lights.  One day we even walked down to the Seattle Center, although the hill back up to the apartment was a challenge!

I would love to come back and stay again, and confidently recommend the apartment to other travelers."
2267088,57198049,2015-12-23,15211853,Genevieve,"We had had a long flight and to arrive at Barbara and Michael's flat was a delight. She was so welcoming and the flat was warm and comfortable. She had even provided us with some breakfast things. (which was incredibly helpful and desired after a long long day traveling.) She provided us with a lot of good information about the place and everything near us. Hospitality, in its finest form. We slept so well.
Even in the lead up to our arrival, communication was excellent. 
This has to be one of the best places I have stayed and I would encourage friends to stay here when visiting Seattle. 

"
2267088,57755442,2015-12-29,4675089,Alanna,Barbara and Michael were absolutely wonderful hosts while we were here. The garden apartment was very cozy while we were there over Christmas. It was cold outside but warm as a mitten as soon as we walked through the door. Bedrooms were large and beds were very comfortable. Barbara was very knowledgable and informative about the neighborhood and city as a whole. Would highly recommend the garden apartment!
7326419,41449935,2015-08-07,38970354,Claudia,Julie gave us clear instructions on her availability and directions to the house.  She was available with the key and all the information I needed for the room.  She also left information about restaurants and transportation in the city and her area.  The neighborhood was very amenable to walking.   This was my first experience with AirBNB and we were quite satisfied with it.  
7326419,41820836,2015-08-09,9081200,Tonia,"Julie was a welcoming host. She made sure to meet us at her house at check in to give us a key and show us the room and bathroom we were using during our stay. The room was very cozy and clean and the bathroom had a luxurious walk in shower stocked with beautiful scented shampoos and soaps. Each day when we came down stairs, Julie made a point to say hello before we left to make sure we were doing ok, answer any questions about the area and just friendly great us. It was a convenient Uber ride ($9-$18) to the districts of Ballard, East Lake, downtown and Fremont."
7326419,42045311,2015-08-10,2262527,Haeyoung,"My sister and I stayed at Julie's for a night. Julie was very understanding and flexible when we were stuck in traffic to meet her for the key. The room we stayed in was very cozy and comfortable. There were other guests in the house and the walls were very thin. They were watching something and we were able to hear everything late into the night. But we were so tired anyway we fell asleep pretty quickly. Overall, Julie's place was close to everywhere we needed to go. It was very convenient. "
7326419,42909732,2015-08-16,38376170,Emily,Julie was a great host. She stayed up late to let us in when we had a late arrival flight into Seattle. The house is a great location in the U District and it is easy to walk to the UW campus or to get to the freeway by car. And I liked the room we had over looking the street. 
7326419,44964543,2015-08-30,40650623,Zachary,Julie was great! The place was clean and comfortable. We loved shopping in the University District.
7326419,45973687,2015-09-07,30306260,Deirdre,"Flexible about our arrival time. Good information on places to eat .  Comfortable room even though we had a shared bathroom we never saw the other guests so no wait.   Very quite house easy parking nearby 
"
7326419,47777343,2015-09-21,20659428,Michelle,My experience with Julie was great and easy. My daughter and I arrived a little early and Julie was able to accommodate us. Julie greeted us with a smile and showed us our room. It's exactly how she describes it. 
7326419,50297380,2015-10-11,42295674,Vladislav,"Julie was very accommodating. My girlfriend and I's flights were delayed, and this didn't cause any issues with the host even though we were late. "
7326419,51164115,2015-10-18,44375312,Sarah,Super easy & positive experience. 
7326419,51479397,2015-10-20,6066954,Sha,Location is great for anyone with residency interview/business at University Washington medical center. UW is a short (s easy on your budget.
7326419,51816014,2015-10-24,7594881,Beth,"Really nice place, great location that was walking distance to the university. Beautiful, clean bathroom with communicative and friendly hosts. Bed is very firm. "
7326419,54864637,2015-11-25,45776984,Danny,"Julie was great! Flexible, warm, and accommodating. A lovely home with a rustic feel and a large upstairs bathroom and shower. I'd definitely recommend it. "
7326419,56212085,2015-12-10,41959979,Colleen,Julie's place is conveniently located within walking distance to the University of Washington and was a nice place to stay during my trip.
7326419,56556682,2015-12-14,18899206,Amy,"Julie was welcoming despite my late evening arrival. She was very respectful of my privacy. I only stayed here for two nights but it was very convenient. No one else was occupying the other guest room so i had a separate bathroom to myself, which was very clean."
9110560,56497229,2015-12-14,43180582,Anderson,"Comfortable room.
Convenient to take bus.
There is a 24hours supermarket nearby.
David is a good host who doesn't live with us."
442487,1383262,2012-05-30,2155628,Kara,"Margot and Ivy's place is in a quiet and lush neighborhood that's still a convenient bus ride to downtown.  It's a small walk to some very nice cafes, bookstores, and restaurants (thumbs up for Elliott Bay Book Co., Oddfellows and Molly Noon!).  The beautiful and peaceful Arboretum isn't far off either.  

The studio itself is very spacious and comfortable.  The surrounding gardens are beautiful and the hens right outside the window added some unexpected charm to this urban oasis.  Margot and Ivy were lovely and considerate hostesses.  Would definitely recommend. "
442487,1391873,2012-05-31,2485100,Evan,"This was my first time using air BnB and it was a great experience (To be honest, I think I may have been permanently spoiled). 

The place is a beautiful, clean and spacious studio basement with plenty of light and views up to the permaculture garden above. Fresh eggs, coffee, tea, recommendations, wifi, an extra bed, and a private shower were all amenities I was very thankful for after having been driving for days on end. 

One great perk is that the space is separate from the main unit, which means you don't feel awkward coming and going (as I had to do at 3:45 AM to drive to seatac airport).

Margot and her daughter were VERY friendly, exceptionally thoughtful, and made the entire process fluid and fun.

Thanks guys!

442487,1403148,2012-06-02,528079,Lauren,"I've stayed with Margot and Ivy a couple of times and always look to see if their place is open before booking another spot.  This light and bright studio is very welcoming and comfortable.  As other guests have stated, the linens are very nice, the location is stellar and the hosts very accommodating.  You don't often find yourself having a cup of tea for an hour while returning someone's key :-)  I felt instantly welcome here and enjoyed the sense of community, not to mention the urban farm feel with the lush gardens and curious chickens!  Fresh flowers, eggs or other goodies from your hostesses are a bonus, as is the full kitchen.  Hope to see you again soon!"
442487,1473567,2012-06-13,2237033,Alfredo,"This is a fantastic place (comfortable, cozy, private, quiet) in a great location in Capitol Hill.  Just minutes from grocery stores, cafes, and restaurants (check Safeway, Coastal Kitchen, Cafe Ladro, and Victrola Coffee Roasters on 15th Street). Just great! I really enjoyed staying at Margot and Ivy's Lovely Garden Studio - I highly recommend it. The garden and the fresh eggs were a plus. "
442487,1497032,2012-06-17,1754565,Daniel,"Our stay at Margot and Ivy's studio was the perfect way to end our trip across the US and overall the best Airbnb experience we've had.
What else is there to say... we loved the place, the garden and the hens and we highly recommend you meet the lovely hosts Margot and Ivy."
442487,1504683,2012-06-18,47947,Teresa,"The apartment was very clean and cozy.  We truly enjoyed the fresh- from-the-garden strawberries from Ivy.  Margot gave us many ideas for places to eat also, which we appreciated.  And loved watching the chickens in the morning."
442487,1536904,2012-06-22,206203,Amanda,"The lovely garden studio is indeed lovely with charming bouquets, fresh strawberries and eggs from the chickens you can view out the windows. For a basement apartment it is especially light and has a pleasant feel. Margot and Ivy are very nice and are happy to make your stay a wonderful one. They are good communicators and check in and out is easy. The neighborhood is quiet but people live upstairs so earplugs might be handy for light sleepers. Great place and great value!"
442487,1546002,2012-06-23,2695876,Leanne,"Staying with Margot and Ivy was great, the room was huge and quiet with great light, lovely and clean too. They were very communicative when it came to seeing if I needed anything and making sure I had the keys but did not disturb me atall. I would not hesitate to go back and stay for a longer amount of time, it really was lovely!"
442487,1556539,2012-06-25,553007,Holly,"Margot and Ivy provided the ultimate space for a quick getaway into the city.  The studio is minutes from everything.  It was close enough for me to get the middle of the city in just a few blocks but far enough from the urban core for me to feel like I'd stepped into the relaxation of small neighborhood comfort.

The interior was comfortable and well tended with wonderful attention to detail.  A welcoming packet provided plenty of information on the space, the neighborhood, and how to enjoy our stay.  It was warm and comfortable with the soft linens and soft carpet.  

The chickens were quiet enough to barely know they were there but cute as heck when peeking back at me through the kitchen window.  One evening we were greeted with a gift of fresh eggs delivered to our door!  I was able to use fresh rosemary from the front garden and whipped upa fantastic late-night breakfast.  It was delicious! 

I would recommend this space to anyone.  It is perfect for a business traveler, a student, a suburban escapee who needs a quick getaway (like me!) for  weekend, and plenty of other folks too."
442487,1655086,2012-07-08,251251,Maggie,"We found many parallels between our lives and Margot and Ivy's. The location is fabulous, the hominess perfect, and the price better than right. We were very happy. Traveling with personal connections like we had with Margot and Ivy make the experience so much nicer! They are down home and real. Much thanks, you two!"
442487,1676130,2012-07-10,2117822,Kinsey,"We loved Margot and Ivy's place!  It was super cute and clean and in the middle of a great neighborhood.  Being able to experience a neighborhood rather than just a tourist hotel is part of what made our trip to Seattle special.  They are great hosts and it is a great palce to stay!
"
442487,1709870,2012-07-15,366160,Elizabeth,"I had a great, but too short, stay at Margot & Ivy's truly lovely studio.  Even if this weren't a very nice place to stay with warm, welcoming hosts and features including a comfortable bed (not too soft, not too hard), lots of good pillows, soft sheets and duvet, big and fluffy towels, a shower with good water pressure, fresh eggs from the chickens out your window, a full kitchen, lots of natural light, beautiful flower gardens, safe and quiet neighborhood...even if all those things weren't true - which, of course, they are! - you should stay here because this location can't be beat if you plan to roam around the city on public transportation a fair bit.  

I know it's not obvious at first glance of the map, but hear me out. From the bus stops within 2 blocks, you can get almost anywhere on just one bus:  downtown/waterfront/Convention Center (route 11 or 43), Capital Hill (8), Seattle Center/Space Needle (8), UW (43 or 48), Ballard Locks (43), Golden Gardens Beach (48).  It took far less effort for me to get to where I needed or wanted to be from this studio than from a hotel near downtown on my last visit.  So if comfort alone doesn't sway you, the logistical aspect should.  

I can't say enough about the great hospitality and friendliness from Margot and Ivy.  I leave wishing I could have spent more time visiting with them.  I hope to return soon!"
442487,1722399,2012-07-16,1424858,Kitty,We had a great time at Margot's and Ivy's place. The studio was clean and spacious for three people. It's also very conveniently located. Margot was very friendly and we enjoyed the fresh eggs and strawberries. 
442487,1763111,2012-07-21,2694746,Maryam & Ryan,"Margot & Ivy's place was perfect for our overnight in Seattle as a 3 person party! Lots of space and easy access to public transportation. They also live in a very trendy area of Seattle, so if you are a foodie/interested in nightlife, this is a great spot for you!

We love the chickens as well! And anywhere that let's you cut fresh flowers for your stay get's an A in our book! Thank you for a lovely stay!"
442487,1776369,2012-07-23,2459143,Eric,"This was by far the best AirBnB place we have experienced.  Everything was just lovely and beautiful, plus wonderful hosts.  Had a lovely time and look forward to returning again,"
