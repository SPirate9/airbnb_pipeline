2858482,33953089,2015-06-02,33616022,Mitchell,"Britt and Jet have a lovely home in a very nice neighborhood. The room we stayed in was well furnished and comfortable. When we first checked in there was a basket of snacks, tea, and cold water waiting for us in the room. They have a big, well-equipped kitchen, and several great places to get groceries nearby, so it's a great place if stay if you intend to cook. There are also several great restaurants and bars within an easy walk from there as well. Both hosts are quite knowledgeable about food and they make some great recommendations. 

This was easily the nicest place we've stayed with Air B n B so far!"
2858482,34473626,2015-06-08,34189131,Charlie,"Great host, great place, you will sleep well in the room provided. Pretty Decent location in seattle. Enough said."
2858482,36110225,2015-06-25,22001802,Gryf,"This was our first experience with Airbnb, and it couldn't have been easier!  Jeanette and her housemate were friendly and helpful, and nice to talk to!  This house is in a wonderful location with easy access to the whole city.  Everything was clean and neat, and we were encouraged to make use of the whole house.  A great visit."
2858482,36535382,2015-06-29,32598511,Yaming,The location is good and safe. It takes only 10 minutes to Seattle downtown. The room is clean. Jeannette and Britney are friendly. We spend most time outside and wish we have had more time in the house.
2858482,38158888,2015-07-13,21057144,Megan,"Jeanette was very welcoming and made us feel right at home. She was helpful with giving us ideas to best take advantage of Seattle in the limited time that we had to spend there. The house was clean, bed was comfy, nothing more you could really ask for!"
2858482,41937760,2015-08-10,32509549,Francesco,"The place was just what we needed. Comfy, quiet and calm. Everything was clean when we came, just perfect. It is exactly as the description says, will come back"
6744143,36134818,2015-06-25,35392941,Denise,Thank you so much for a wonderful stay!  The views are just as pictured.  Perfect place to kick back and relax after a day in the city!
6744143,37010246,2015-07-03,8991881,Maria,"Great location, right on beach, quite neighborhood, with parking spaces. The only thing is the house gets extremely hot!! No air conditioning so I would recommend more fans or bring your own. "
6744143,37371729,2015-07-06,36095595,Angela,"This home was absolutely perfect for what we wanted for a 4th of July stay-cation in Seattle.  I know the area pretty well, so I knew this side of Alki/Lincoln Park would be a lot quieter, which it was.  We even got a private fireworks show thanks to the neighbors about two doors down.  Very private, intimate, and gorgeous view of the Sound.  With that being said the big windows in the home that allowed us to enjoy the beautiful view was amazing to wake up to every morning, but it did shower us with some very extraordinary heat during the late afternoons.  The home didn't have AC since it was older, so it was like a sauna in there starting around 2/3PM.  Another thing was there was an awesome fire pit in the back we weren't allowed to use, wish I was told that prior to booking :( Had some issues with one of the windows as well, but like I mentioned the home is a bit older with all it's original windows.  Overall very clean and if you're looking for a place that makes you feel like you are definitely in the PNW, this place will do that and more with it's view!  "
6744143,38757933,2015-07-18,20979088,Kayla,"This waterfront home is anything less than amazing. The view is out of this world, the neighborhood is quaint, yet close enough to restaurants and shops, the interior is fabulous and the home was extremely clean. It felt like we were right out of a movie. The rooms are spacious and the beds are comfortable. The kitchen has so much space and has appliances readily available. I cannot say enough about the perfect view and the how grateful we are that we were able to stay at such a lovely and cleanly home. I would go back in a heartbeat and recommend this specific location to anyone. "
6744143,38882250,2015-07-19,36304436,Finn,A Pillow representative was there when we checked in and walked us through the property.  The home is very clean and well maintained.  The property is in a very quiet and secluded neighborhood with easy access to the beach and trail.  
6744143,40112360,2015-07-28,35820860,Margaret,"The place was great. The view is absolutely incredible. The hosts kindly provided binoculars that helped us to observe the Great Blue Heron that visited daily, as well as the osprey, bald eagle and Canada geese that made appearances. It is a quiet place and a bit out of the way, which might not be for everyone, but this suited us perfectly. We expect to return to the area and hope that we will be able to stay here again next time."
6744143,41777066,2015-08-09,31316831,Qing,One of the best places I've stayed in! Perfect for family/couple vacation. Perfect view and gorgeous sunset!
6744143,43738225,2015-08-21,14124877,Mike,The host canceled this reservation 33 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
6744143,43738227,2015-08-21,18323036,Cody,The host canceled this reservation 36 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
6744143,43775695,2015-08-22,27620391,Paula,"Yes the host made us welcome, the neighborhood was very nice."
6744143,44172394,2015-08-24,8330117,Josh,"This house has an amazing view and a ""Mad Men"" vibe to the interior. It offered a peaceful launch pad for our minimoon with great views of the Sound and a bonus heron sighting. The rocky beach is below a sea wall and the patio and the shoreline changes dramatically with the tide. Beauty aside, I'm not sure this place is worth the cost as currently presented. It's described as an entire home but the owners or managers live below. There were few amenities included - no bath soap, welcome kit, water, etc. that may have been an oversight by the management company. A random assortment of hand towels were left at the door after dark. The floors were sticky. On arrival some other people - the owner and friends? - were on the patio using the furniture. They didn't say hi. There were no Adirondack chairs as shown in the picture - just some wrought iron chairs. A shade umbrella would be nice. Overall the home seems kitschy but rather sparse and due for some updates. There's a 50s-60s charm and a great view but not sure I'd pay a premium for this again. "
6744143,44569769,2015-08-27,16401627,Sarah,"Spaces like this are why I love AirBNB.  Enjoy a million dollar view from this very cool vintage beach house.  Check in was easy and the house was spotless.  Very comfortable bed, cable TV and wifi.  This is a vintage house in Seattle, where not many have A/C.  With the western exposure, the house will get warm if you do not lower the shades in the afternoon.  There is a stone patio by the water, great for sipping wine and watching the sunset.  My favorite public pool in the world is walking distance down the beach.  It's a salt water pool with a killer view of the Puget Sound.  The house is tucked out of the way in West Seattle so you will need a car.  It's an easy 15 min to downtown and 15 min to SeaTac.  I will stay here again.  "
6744143,45663534,2015-09-05,36142285,Elizabeth,"The house is so cool! The furniture and decor are either original or support the mid-century vibe. The location right on Puget Sound cannot be beat and you can easily walk right onto a huge and lovely park just by walking out of the driveway and turning right. There is no through traffic on the street, so it is very quiet.

Very few windows open, so I imagine it might be steamy in hot weather, although there are many fans provided. The kitchen has any small appliances you might wish, new frig, etc., but not very many glasses. Buy yourself a bag of ice! There are hotel style amenity kits provided, which was a nice touch, fluffy towels and nice linens. There is a serviceable washer/dryer. We provided our own detergent.

We hated to leave and would stay there again in a heartbeat. West Seattle is a neat neighborhood with plenty of restaurants and a short distance from Seatac. If you are inclined, public transportation is excellent.

The photos don't lie--this is a peach!"
2686624,11847397,2014-04-16,1367673,William,Our stay at Chris's place was really nice.  My family needed a temporary place to stay and his basement apartment was very homey with a really nice energy.  It's a nice private cozy space that will make you feel right at home.   He offered a really good rate for the area and the space.  It's also within walking distance of Seattle s beautiful Greenlake.   
2686624,12090850,2014-04-22,13604004,Karen,Chris was super awesome and very accommodating during our crazy pre-wedding week! Their house is super clean and cozy! I world recommend this place and hope to book it again soon for any stay in Seattle! This is a hidden gem!
2686624,12626850,2014-05-06,5271283,Desiree,"My son and I loved our stay at Chris' home. Street parking was available right in front of the house. Our private entrance was to the side. The suite was comfortable and cozy. Our hosts made us feel quite welcome with ideas for places to eat and things to do, but gave us plenty of privacy. It was located close to bus lines which took us easily into downtown Seattle when we didn't feel like driving. We'd stay there again."
2686624,12985073,2014-05-16,14984372,Keri-Ann,"Chris was an amazing host, very accommodating, and helped us with any questions we had.  He was easily reachable and responded quickly.  I love how he made suggested itineraries of places to go and where to eat.

The price for his place was awesome!  $45 a night is a real steal for a 2 bedrooms, kitchen, and living room.  Everything was so clean and such a cozy comfortable place to be in.  I absolutely loved the décor, the landscape pictures and designs just made us feel right at home.

I highly recommend this place to anyone who wants to stay near green lake and I will definitely stay here again the next time I visit Seattle. 

Thanks for a wonderful stay Chris!  We'll be sure to book with you again in the future!
"
2686624,13145422,2014-05-20,179481,Enrico,"My sons and I had a great time at Chris'  house and he was very helpful and hospitable.  I think it was one of best value I have encounter since I've been using Airbnb.
Thank you Chris."
2686624,13473577,2014-05-28,9927955,Gail,"My husband, daughter, her infant son and I stayed at Chris' place over the Memorial Day weekend. Our check in time fluctuated and I contacted Chris immediately with each change, he was quick and accommodating with his replies. The unit is a downstairs in the home and was extremely quiet. It was clean and any convenience that one may have forgotten was readily available. The rooms were good sized and nicely decorated. While we were there Chris' talents transformed the front yard into beautiful area. Chris was readily available. Having lived in Seattle in the past, I found the location excellent-simple access to 99 and an easy walk to Green Lake & near Woodland Park Zoo. I would highly recommend a stay here.  "
2686624,13580134,2014-05-31,2707955,Rob,"I didn't have the pleasure of meeting Chris, however Jasen was there to handle all of the essentials and he was awesome. This is hands down the best AirBnB space I have ever stayed at due to the attention to detail. Chris and Jasen have a packet laid out that provides incredible insight to the city of Seattle that complements their wonderful space. I highly recommend this space to future guests and would gladly stay here again myself if I'm ever in need of a place to crash in the Emerald City. "
2686624,14736298,2014-06-25,14522494,Cathleen,"Chris and Jasen were the best! They entertained my kids by answering their million questions and were very hospitable. The house was clean and spacious with free wifi and DVD player. It was easy access to the freeway and about 20 minutes to everywhere we wanted to go. The streets were a bit narrow, but there is plenty of parking. It's in walking distance to many restaurants along Greenlake. The best part about this location is that there were cherry and blueberry trees along the sidewalk, which is something we don't see in LA! I would definitely book this place again the next time I'm in the Emerald City!"
2686624,14890728,2014-06-28,17111211,Karisa,"My parents and sisters stayed with Chris and it was fabulous! The space is just as it appears and its very close to downtown and green lake. Everything was very clean and tidy. It's a great space for vacationing and it's a great price. The tenets are very quite, and the neighborhood is very cute. My parents thoroughly enjoyed their stay here and will defiantly be back in the future! Thanks for your great hospitality Chris!"
2686624,15093335,2014-07-02,14319480,Christina,"We had a wonderful stay. Very cute and comfortable place. Very, very quaint and clean. Amazing location! Had no problem getting to major Seattle attractions, only a 15 minute drive! We would definitely stay there again on a future visit!"
2686624,15756102,2014-07-15,4274489,Landon,"A high recommend from two fellow Airbnb hosts! My wife, toddler, parents and I stayed here. Chris and his male partner were the epitome of hospitality - flexible, accommodating and communicative. When a minor problem arose, Chris was quick and kind to respond. The space itself is clean and lovely. Chris was thoughtful to leave lots of shampoo. He invited us to see his garden. The location is close a major bus stop that goes to downtown and ten minutes walk to Green Lake. Ideal fit for family who likes to cook and walk. Thank you for a pleasant stay. "
2686624,16082392,2014-07-22,14632433,Jera,"Our stay at Chris's place was extraordinary. The unit was exactly as described and very well kept. I felt like I was at home with the comfy couch, big beds, and roomy kitchen.
The neighborhood was quiet and located a short walk from a main road in which the bus will take you directly downtown for 2 bucks. There are also restaurants and watering holes within walking distance.
Chris was polite and respectful of our privacy. I never really knew when he was home or not. Chris has done a great job making his house stand out as one of the nicest on the block.
This stay has opened my parents eyes to the value and convenience of airbnb and I doubt they will be shopping for hotels on their next adventure.
Thank you."
2686624,16401568,2014-07-27,6703902,Christy,This basement apartment was very comfortable and nicely decorated. Beautiful Green Lake park as well as the numerous cafes adjacent to Green Lake is within a 10 minute walk. The apartment is located in a great neighborhood with easy access to I-5 and many other great Seattle neighborhoods. The check-in process was easy with the lock box. The apartment had a great book with host recommendations as well as maps and brochures. 
2686624,16775231,2014-08-02,353965,Mary And Geoff,Chris hosted some colleagues while we were all in town working.  The apartment was exactly what they needed.   Super helpful hosts.  Apartment was quiet and restful.   And they were extremely understanding of a late night key mixup.  Recommended! 
2686624,22177475,2014-11-01,8395058,Shawn,"My wife and I really enjoyed our stay at Chris' 2 bedroom apartment. It's in a convenient location (really close to Greenlake and Ballard, and a short drive to downtown) and in a nice quiet neighborhood. The apartment itself was very clean, furnished nicely, with a well stocked kitchen and access to a washer and dryer. 

Chris and Jasen were incredibly friendly and helpful. They immediately made us feel at home in a new city. I would highly recommend staying here on your next visit to Seattle!"
2686624,32898933,2015-05-23,19544441,Amy,"I stayed here on a business trip, and the house was a great location and easy to get to the highway and different areas of town. parking was very easy at this home. It was nicely decorated and nice to have a television with cable. Chris was very responsive and timely with communication. All the basics were covered. "
2686624,33585657,2015-05-30,5896110,Nancy,"Chris gave very clear information about the house, and he was in touch with me via text twice to make sure everything was working out with our stay. The house is only a half mile from Green Lake, and I was delighted to run around the lake each morning.  The lower level of the house is very clean and quiet. Chris left a list of great activities for our time in Seattle. We enjoyed our stay at this quaint suite. "
2686624,34319367,2015-06-07,14333053,Claire,It's a great experience living in Chris's apartment. The room is clean and well kept. Two bed room has a decent size. Chris respect our privacy and we really had a great time. :) 
2686624,35200919,2015-06-16,13325440,Mina,"This was a perfect and cosy place for my family to stay during my wedding. More than anything, Chris was so accommodating, understanding and flexible when a family emergency arose. Would definitely recommend this place and stay here again. "
2686624,35704285,2015-06-21,34818894,David,"Chris's place was great.  It was very comfortable and clean, the location was great for seeing Seattle.  Chris responded to all my inquiries in a timely fashion.  I was extremely happy with the rental and the rental experience."
2686624,36010815,2015-06-24,29749533,Sally,"This 2 bedroom lower flat was very comfortable and well-located for our 3 day stay in Seattle - and also well-priced for Seattle.  Much more comfortable than a hotel room, especially for my 82 yr old mother. Chris was available for any questions we had.  It was a warm weekend, and the flat was very cool and comfortable.  "
2686624,36401458,2015-06-28,25828995,Anna,"The four of us, 2 couples, stayed at Chris' finished basement apartment for three nights. From start to finish his communication was excellent. Although we didn't see him face to face I was able to reach him for any reason at any time. We were very comfortable during our stay. Parking was not a big problem on the street. The full equipped kitchen was very accessible and clean upon entering. Each room has a heater that we used when we first arrived. The location was great and since the entrance to the apartment was separate from the rest of the home; we never felt like we were bothering him upstairs. The two separate bedrooms and the living room accommodated us really well. Beds were comfortable and sheets were clean as well. The only thing I had to be careful of was to make sure that my clothes didn't sit on the carpet too long because it would get damp from the moisture coming up from the ground. Overall, this was the best airbnb experience we have had out of the 3 airbnb locations I've visited so far. I would highly recommend!"
2686624,38257722,2015-07-14,23962219,Leyla,"Chris was very good and helpful host...we enjoyed staying in his house..the location was wonderful near to green lake, especially if you like walking.."
2686624,39480812,2015-07-24,1464692,Dev,Gute Beschreibung und auch Gute gegend. Immer telef. auch erreichbar.
2686624,40089636,2015-07-28,32536707,Tonya,"Chris provided us the perfect ""home"" while visiting Seattle. Close enough to reach downtown in minutes. Enough room so we all had our own space. Privacy to feel like we were not sharing a house. I loved it. Chris, thank you for making our vacation memorable!"
2686624,40493626,2015-07-31,38200395,Jimmy,"I spent three nights in this suite with family members.  Throughout the stay, we enjoyed the comforts of this basement apartment and felt we got a great deal for staying in Seattle.  It was like have a pleasant house all to ourselves.  So, don't let its description as a basement fool you.  There is much to be gained from securing this suite.

Further, this place is located in a quiet neighborhood, from which it is easy to get to major Seattle attractions without the traffic congestion and hustle of downtown life.  The surrounding area is safe, friendly, and quiet."
2686624,41078270,2015-08-04,18152448,Susan,"Great place to stay within walking distance to Greenlake.  Downstairs basement apartment with full kitchen and bathroom facilities.  Nice, neat and affordable.  Chris was super responsive to every question we had.  Thanks for the great visit!"
2686624,42111797,2015-08-11,22292250,Max,"This was one great stay. The place itself was nice and spacious, in a  very quiet neighborhood. Chris was always there to answer question or help us with anything we needed. It would take us less then 20 mins on a bus to get to the downtown. There is a big lake nearby where all the locals spend their time on the weekend going for a picnic, or for a run, or to do some paddle board yoga. There are no dining spots around in the neighborhood, but as i said the commute to any other part of the town is pretty easy. Overall we had a good time and are very happy with our stay. Would definitely recommend this place for everyone! "
2686624,46577131,2015-09-12,31099717,Amee,"We stayed in Chris' apartment for about a month while we were transitioning to moving to the area. Chris gave us such a warm welcome and that was just the start of our wonderful stay. The apartment is clean, up to date and very comfortable. After being on the road for weeks, I can say that Chris' place is nicer than almost all the hotels we stayed in! Chris was easy to get ahold of, responded to questions very fast and very kind when we did see him outside the house. We almost always were able to park directly in front of the house and it is a very short walk to Greenlake Park. Coffee shops, ice cream and restaurants are also walkable from the place. Thank you Chris for giving us a real home while we were in transition! We are so grateful to you. "
2686624,47162097,2015-09-16,28422305,Ryan,"Listing description was accurate. Apartment was as expected and exactly what we needed. Kitchen was very nice and Chris even supplied coffee. Thanks so much for hosting, Chris! We will definitely use again if the opportunity arises."
8666707,54396422,2015-11-19,35023629,Tamara,Shawn's place is truly special. It is modern and cozy and comfortable. Shawn was a super nice host - very supportive and easy to communicate with! I would definitely stay there again! 
3706719,17646574,2014-08-15,9679616,Mika,.
3706719,18155542,2014-08-22,20217999,Stuart,"Accurate Listing, clean studio. Convenient location, close to shops and the UW."
3706719,18595746,2014-08-28,6186754,Elizabeth,Accurate listing and cute studio! Great location. Melissa is extremely easy to work with. 
3706719,18908808,2014-09-02,19414577,Kimberley,A great neighborhood to stay in while in Seattle! 
3706719,40094195,2015-07-28,32193480,Petra,"The studio was very clean and just like the pictures. The bed is extremely comfortable. Be aware that it can get very hot in the summer as it has south-west exposure and the sun sets around 10 pm. I spent most evenings in a local cafe to stay cool during this year's 2+ week heatwave. This building in general was very hot during this time. There is a fan that helps just a little. 
Melissa was responsive although with a delay at times due to the busy summer season. She was very accomodating and helpful. "
3706719,45041773,2015-08-30,23177776,Joshua,"I really liked this apartment, very clean and comfortable with all the amenities and a great location (I'd recommend the portage cafe a few blocks away).  I appreciate Melissa being able to accommodate me on such short notice (ie I was sending my booking request just three or four hours before arriving)."
2557712,19488078,2014-09-13,20131353,K. Brook,"Tobin is a very generous host- she proactively communicated (welcome/logistics/sightseeing/kept in touch throughout stay), accommodated multiple arrival times, created a very useful home & neighborhood guide binder, gave us gifts of assorted of local Seattle treats (coffee, chocolate, pear cider, fresh flowers in each room!), let us gather from her gardens for picnics (raspberries, strawberries & tomatoes!) and her house was very cute, clean & multiple fun ""lounging"" areas (inside, front porch, back garden patio).  We were able to get (and really enjoyed!) an authenticate Seattle/NW experience thanks to Tobin, her Craftsman home, her friendly neighbors, the Phinney neighborhood (great shops, restaurants, parks...and possible the best zoo in America), and great location relative to Seattle & day trip attractions.  Thanks so much, Tobin!"
2557712,24850975,2015-01-03,24092273,Joyce,"Tobin's home was a perfect place for my family to stay while they were visiting me over the holidays. It was very comfortable, warm, and inviting, and Tobin was a terrific host. She met us upon arrival, and made sure to have basic essentials available, as well as local goodies and fresh fruit. The location is in a great neighborhood, with easy access to a local market, restaurants, cafes, and the zoo. Very happy to have found this home! "
2557712,33784975,2015-06-01,3031519,Kevin,"This was a terrific AirBnB experience, probably the best I've had. Tobin was a great communicator the whole way through, and made us feel very welcome, providing a baby gate, toys, and other treats for our family. The house is beautiful, clean, relaxing and comfortable. We loved having breakfast and dinner on the back patio, and a beer on the porch both surrounded by Tobin's beautiful garden. And the neighborhood is lovely, vibrant and full of young families. Tobin gave recommendations to great restaurants and cafes a short jaunt away (Mai Thaiku was a highlight.) Overall it was a wonderful stay in a great neighborhood. "
2557712,35100788,2015-06-15,32546525,Barbara,"Tobin responded promptly to all inquiries. When we arrived, there were flowers in the bedrooms and living room, as well as chocolate and wine on the fireplace mantle. Very clear instructions were left for us so we knew exactly how to do things and what to expect. Her home is beautiful and easy to find; parking was plentiful."
2557712,36655013,2015-06-30,1525001,Sherry,"My daughter moved to Seattle about three years ago.  My husband and I have traveled to see her several times and stayed in several different places around Green Lake.  We finally found a place that feels like home.

Tobin's house has great windows allowing the June sun to come in the house from every room.  The living room windows face onto a sunny porch with beautiful flower boxes.  In the back there is a large garden, a grill, and table.  We cooked out and had friends over.  Just delightful.

The neighborhood is quiet but lively.  Had a great massage from the next door neighbor and even had the pleasure of attending a block party.  All of this and the location is perfect.  One morning I walked to the Ballard Locks, got some coffee, and watched the boats come and go.  After dinner one night we walked to A la Mode Pies on Phinney.  Oh, man!

Tobin was an excellent host answering every question in a timely manner.  She allowed me to pick produce from the garden.  Yum!
I've recommended her place to other parents with children living in Seattle."
2557712,37652518,2015-07-09,32532642,Kier,"I, my husband, 16-month old daughter, and mom stayed at Tobin's house for 5 nights. Tobin was very responsive to messages and really wonderful about making sure we had all the info we needed. The location was perfect for a family with a small kid since the zoo and an excellent playground are very nearby. The house was adorable and well-stocked with everything we needed. We would definitely stay again!"
2557712,38301596,2015-07-14,393805,Olayinka,"Walking into Tobin's airbnb was like walking into your own home.  A stylish, clean, exceptionally well-designed version of your own home.  Tobin was incredibly communicative, thoughtful and accommodating.  The house had the amenities of a bed and breakfast or hotel with much more charm and class.  The neighborhood is lovely, only a 15 minute walk to the lake.  We had the opportunity to cook excellent food and spend time in the backyard or lounging on the couch.  It was an incredible experience!"
2557712,38924389,2015-07-19,4647250,Jennifer,"Tobin was an excellent host!  She communicated quickly and often, answering all my questions cheerfully.  Her house is situated in a great neighborhood-extremely walkable with so many little restaurants just up the street.  Actually it was difficult to decide whether to go out or stay in and enjoy dinner on her deck among the flowers and vegetable garden.  The house itself was incredibly clean, very comfy beds and always plenty of street parking.  Her house is really the best of Airbnb-it isn't just a house, it is a home.  "
2557712,39318706,2015-07-22,48852,Shawn,"Lovely home, and they really went above and beyond to make their house a welcoming place to spend time in Seattle.
We had two small children (age 4 and 6), who were delighted to discover sidewalk chalk, and some small toys, and a small but well-curated selection of children's books.

The gardens are also quite nice.

"
2557712,40241694,2015-07-29,37175340,Shelagh,"A perfect place to call home, the house in Phinney Ridge made our vacation in Seattle absolutely wonderful. Every time I cooked a meal in the well-appointed kitchen or sat by the wonderful back garden or front porch, I thanked my lucky stars that I found this place! Tobin had everything set up for us perfectly--walking into such a stylish, clean home, with fresh flowers and a welcoming note and a bottle of wine, set a great tone for a relaxing time. My family of four was very comfortable. 

We loved exploring the neighborhood and the city; though we had a car with us, we were able to get to anything needed by bus, bike or on foot. We appreciated being able to store our bikes. Grocery and coffee shops nearby, pizza place down a hill, pie shop on the corner!

We didn't meet Tobin in person but she made sure she was available for any questions. Judging from how attentive she was and how beautifully set up the house was, we concluded that Tobin is one of the nicest, most kind and clever people we never met! My only regret was not staying longer. "
2557712,41396348,2015-08-07,34870268,John,"This home was perfect in every way.  It is located in a quiet, lovely neighborhood that is close to downtown Seattle and the University of Washington campus. The house itself was extremely clean and charming, with attention to the smallest details throughout the home. It was a comfortable and relaxing place to come home to after long days exploring the Seattle area. Tobin was a pleasure to work with and  communication was excellent.  We will definitely stay here again and will recommend this to anyone looking for a home away from home in Seattle."
2557712,41799398,2015-08-09,35544945,Yu,"Nice house in a great location. Near green lake and the park, easy for a morning running. Love the place!"
2557712,43982585,2015-08-23,22709751,Amy,"We absolutely loved out time here.  The house was in the perfect location for us, and suited us well for our little family (two boys age 4 and age 2).  We walked everywhere in the surrounding neighborhood.  It was exactly as described.  We especially enjoyed sitting outside in the back eating dinner and watching the sun go down.  Definitely would stay here again!"
2557712,47025865,2015-09-15,472621,Anne,"De check-in verliep erg makkelijk, de sleutel lag op de afgesproken plek, dus we konden onszelf zonder problemen binnenlaten. Zoals het huis er in het echt uitziet komt overeen met de foto's, we vonden het zelfs groter dan verwacht. En het zag er net zo mooi uit als je zou verwachten op basis van de foto's.
Bij binnenkomst lagen er een flesje wijn en reep chocola op ons te wachten, erg lekker!

We verbleven met ons 5en in het huis, samen met mijn ouders, mijn man en baby. Het was niet ruim, maar paste zeker wel. Pluspunten vonden wij de veranda en de achtertuin, waardoor je ook lekker buiten kunt zitten. Ook handig dat we gebruik mochten maken van de wasmachine en droger in de kelder - vooral met een baby heb je dit wel nodig.

De buurt is erg rustig, en kindvriendelijk. We konden eigenlijk altijd zonder problemen voor de deur parkeren (gratis). Vlakbij het huis zit een park waar je lekker kunt wandelen, maar het is ook erg leuk om door de woonwijk te lopen en alle huizen & tuinen te bekijken.
In de buurt zitten meerdere horeca gelegenheden waar je koffie kunt drinken, kunt eten of eten kunt ophalen. Erg handig.

Het contact met Tobin verliep probleemloos. Ze respecteerde onze privacy, en onderhield via Airbnb contact met ons. Voor vragen was ze bereikbaar, en we hebben haar ook nog even ontmoet toen ze een pakketje in ontvangst moest nemen dat bij het huis afgeleverd werd.

Al met al vonden wij het een erg fijn huis in een leuke wijk van Seattle. Zeker een aanrader."

6131411,35433174,2015-06-18,33687656,Xinpeng,"Shawn is a responsible host who is willing to help everything. The house is in a good location and very clean, except that it costs extra money to pay for parking. Overall good experience!"
6131411,36247362,2015-06-26,6842088,David,"EXCELLENT! is one of the words that comes to mind when thinking about our stay at Shawn's lovely apartment in Capitol Hill. Great location very easy access, short drive to downtown, many good restaurants and bars around. Shawn himself is a GREAT host, always attentive and very easy to reach, he was giving us directions and advice during our stay in Seattle. Will definitely try and book one of his places on our next visit. Thank you so much Shawn we had a wonderful stay! "
6131411,36567369,2015-06-29,22726634,Richard,I loved the place. Very cute 2 bedroom setup with spacious living room.  Had extra air blow up mattresses which made it very nice and extra fans to cool it off.  The host was very accommodating.
6131411,44226084,2015-08-24,965456,Jonathan,"We had a very pleasant stay in this apartment - we had everything we needed to be very comfortable, and the location was excellent - very conveniently located, in easy walking distance to everything in Capitol Hill.  The keycode system for entry made things very convenient.

Shawn was very helpful, and though we didn't get to meet personally, he was very responsive and made sure we were taken care of. I'd recommend both Shawn and this apartment very highly to anyone visiting Seattle."
8355276,49866270,2015-10-06,45679876,Marina,"Rilwan was a great host. He provided a clean private space for me. Everything was clean and orderly, he was on time and very friendly. I would definitely stay at his place again. "
8355276,50369828,2015-10-11,45401394,Eric,Have to admit my first experience was a great one. Rilwan was very accommodating to my girlfriend and I. Very flexible with the check in/out time. Never felt any pressure to leave at the end of our stay. The apartment was clean and tidy and was in a great location centralized to all of the things we wanted to do in Seattle. Hope all of my future experiences with airBnB are this pleasant. 
8355276,51478501,2015-10-20,19533746,Malachy,"Rilwan was a great host. Very punctual with check-in and check-out and was available during my stay if I needed anything. The apartment itself is really centrally located if you are spending time downtown or near the waterfront. It is also very near public transit (I went up to Edmonds one of the days I was in town, and it was very easy to get to the bus from the apartment). The neighborhood is great with a wonderful grocery store just around the corner and restaurants just a 5 minute walk from the place (Sushi Kanpai is highly recommended). I would definitely recommend this apartment if you are looking for an affordable place to stay in a great area of Seattle!"
8355276,51778560,2015-10-24,44547985,Precious Grace,Rilwan is so accomodating! We had last minute changes on our flight but he stil managed to meet with us to give us the key. Everything was perfect. We loved the place! The neighborhood is quiet and nice. Walking distance to Downtown. We love Rilwan's place! We will definitely stay here again when we go back to Seattle! We enjoyed Seattle and this place made us feel at home. 
8355276,52439477,2015-10-29,16511629,Florent,All was well. Place could have been cleaner.
8355276,52872365,2015-11-02,32933418,John,The place was great and location was good! Rilwan was an excellent host.
8355276,53358199,2015-11-08,20586758,Justin,"Great at communication, especially with emailing or texting. Readily available if questions or needs. Great location, walking distance to pike place market and downtown. Relatively private location."
8355276,53729128,2015-11-11,22319966,Ellen,"Wonderful experience with Rilwan. He was super easy to get in contact with, and amendable to me changing the departure time when I left. Such a great host. The place was so clean and tidy. Will definitely book again if coming though Seattle."
8355276,54124787,2015-11-16,46178104,Craig,Rilwan greeted us with a smile and was quick to help us get all set up.    The neighborhood was relatively quiet and only about a 10-15 minute walk to pioneer square and around 20-25 from pike place market.  Overall we had a great weekend and will certainly consider Rilwan's studio as an option next time we visit beautiful Seattle. 
8355276,54295741,2015-11-17,7482530,Pam,"Rilwan was very easy to work with - nice coordination and communication regarding key pick-up.  The apartment is a good location for access to I-5 and downtown Seattle.  Several cafes, restaurants and a small neighborhood grocery store are within walking distance.  It is a block away from Harborview Medical Center, so the siren quotient from ambulances is high.  Apartment was not clean and lacked some basics such as soap, water glasses, kitchen towels, an iron and back-up bathroom towels.  "
8355276,54515829,2015-11-21,46337258,Anna,"Our stay at Rilwan's was lovely. He was super responsive and the key handoff and departure went smoothly. The place is centrally located and was very close to the Paramount theatre, where we went to see a concert. If you're looking for a cheaper place to stay without any crazy bells and whistles, this is your place! "

4710869,28844451,2015-03-30,19862803,Riley,"My stay at this place has always been great.  I rarely ever go to Seattle in circumstances where I have time to hang out, but the other guests here are always polite and sociable when I am around and stay active and engaged."
4710869,32850122,2015-05-22,33009266,Weining,"The host is quite welcome and people living in the house are pretty friendly. The neighborhood is quite and clean, and you can get downtown easily from the house."
4710869,33169380,2015-05-25,27321178,Hannah,"Description was accurate. They did a great job communicating and making sure I knew exactly where everything was and what I needed to do to get in and get settled. Great neighborhood (probably my favorite  part of Seattle!) I definitely recommend checking out the parks nearby including the Washington Park Arboretum and Volunteer Park - as well as Volunteer Park Café on 17th and Galer around the corner and down the street from the house! Also, you must look up Hello Robin's for amazing ice cream sandwiches!"
4710869,40722190,2015-08-02,14292383,William,"Crayola house is warm and welcoming!  There is always someone to give you a tour when you arrive, someone to share a meal or beer with, and someone to talk to (if you want).  The house vibe is flexible to what you want out of the experience. I loved the Saturday house bonfires.  In addition, the house sometimes organizes for other events like the 4th of July.  My room was as advertised and had so much storage.  The neighborhood is UNREAL: you are in upper Capital Hill with the neighborhoods of 15th and 19th near by and the Pike/Pine bars are only a 20 min walk away.  Very safe and very beautiful.  Perfect."
4710869,44806128,2015-08-29,20365218,Johann,War sehr angenehm

4710869,45982975,2015-09-07,40107611,Matthieu,"Staying at Crayola Home was perfect! First the neighborhood is super nice. Crayola home is a great house too! Its kind of huge, clean, organize, is all you need there ( laundry room, nice kitchen, spacious leaving room etc...) and you'll feel welcome by anyone who stay there, travelers or those guys living long therm there. Good atmosphere, great view, cool people, hope I'll go back there! But if you're reading and not sure about to book there, just do it..."
4710869,46446456,2015-09-10,42551306,振威,"The house is not far away from bus station, I dont konw how to say what I live in that way. That is so cool and awesome. Every one treat me so good. I love that way!!!!"
4710869,47427091,2015-09-18,9047829,Christopher,"It was easy to stay here and everything is considered in the house manual and reasonable.  It is amazing that such a large house with as many people staying in it can be so organized, clean and hospitable. "

4710869,54910617,2015-11-25,41089614,Matthew,Crayola House was great and as described. This was my second time staying there - would return again!
4710869,55760283,2015-12-05,10264088,John,These people are airbnb ninjas. They have it down to a science. Everything was easy. The house is kept very clean. It has a library vibe to it (at least on the weekdays) which is nice because it is conducive to getting work done and resting. It's in a beautiful neighborhood too.
4710869,56874210,2015-12-19,41089614,Matthew,Accurate description! Third time staying here and as great as ever - would definitely recommend (as well as stay there again!)
8487843,49964321,2015-10-07,20326947,J.,"Sweet, quiet spot with easy access to everywhere in downtown Seattle. located steps away from the monorail which will whisk you away to EMP or the space needle, the apartment also offer easy access to many nearby restaurants and bars. Best doughnuts and coffee in the city are only a block away. 

Thanks for leaving the snacks. "
8487843,50564124,2015-10-12,18024699,Mika,"We loved our stay at John and Lynn's lovely apartment.  The layout is perfect for two people with a well-equipped kitchen and large bathroom.  Every amenity was provided, beginning with a thoughtful ""welcome"" card and snacks upon our arrival.  The apartment was immaculate, this is the only place I've ever stayed that I didn't clean upon arrival.  The location is amazing and we were able to walk to almost every surrounding neighborhood on our itinerary.  If you don't want to walk,  the public transportation is plentiful including train, monorail, bus, streetcar and Uber.  John and Lynn are fantastic hosts and Pillow was very prompt in answering any inquiries.  We would definitely stay here again and highly recommend it to anyone visiting Seattle.  "
8487843,51582213,2015-10-21,13714246,Janell,"We enjoyed staying at John's place. It was very comfortable with fun decor. It's in a good location for seeing  the Seattle sights. 

John was very accommodating in letting us alter our reservation at the last minute. We very much appreciated this. 
When we had a little trouble finding the bldg John called to help us. "
8487843,52278665,2015-10-27,46109789,Randy,A great place in the lively Belltown neighborhood. Great food and walkable to downtown and tourist destinations. John was a great host and was readily available when needed. The apartment was a comfortable studio and met our needs superbly. 
8487843,53569946,2015-11-09,1628945,Kimmie,"Perfect studio apt for visiting Seattle. Brand new, clean with all the right amenities. It had everything I needed from a hairdryer, to a french press to an ironing board. I appreciated the little touches such as the basket of snacks, coffee/tea, mini shampoos, handy directory for exploring and USB plugs in the nightstands. 

John works with a property management group and both parties were super responsive. There was a mishap with the heater my first night and John brought over an electric heater the next day. 

Location wise, this can't be beat for visiting. Walking distance to Downtown, Pike's Place and a short cab ride to Capitol Hill and Queen Anne. Highly recommend staying here."
8487843,54039708,2015-11-15,16163497,Bassel,"Absolutely fantastic overall experience!
John & Lynn host an incredible and perfect apartment in one of the best locations in Seattle.  The attention to detail is really what sets their place apart from all others I've stayed at.  Nothing is left to chance.
The neighborhood is awesome, and is conveniently located just a short distance from many of the best attractions/restaurants in the city.  We loved walking around to everything.  
The apartment itself is super cute, and exceptionally clean.  It is actually even better than described in the text or the pictures.  We thoroughly enjoyed our stay, and would highly recommend this to anyone visiting Seattle.  "
8487843,55408896,2015-12-01,11766549,Lisa,"This studio apartment was hands down the perfect place to rest and relax during our Seattle trip this Thanksgiving. From the personal touches like the snack basket, the Netflix account, and the french press, we felt right at home. The apartment was small, but perfect for our party of two. There was a spacious closet to store luggage and clothing so we had tons of space to stretch out. The apartment was immaculate, and the management service Pillow was prompt and helpful when we had an issue with the wifi connection- even John stepped in to reset the router for us within 24 hours of reporting an issue.

We were truly steps away from downtown, the Space Needle, and hardly needed to bike/drive anywhere. Will definitely come back on our next trip to Seattle :)"
8487843,55743842,2015-12-05,11757177,Jackie,"This listing is amazing!  The photos don't do it justice - it is the perfect retreat in the heart of seattle.  John was a thoughtful host and provided lots of great information, as well as delicious snacks.  The apartment really has everything you need."
8487843,56331501,2015-12-12,46054716,Alice,"We loved staying here - it is so well equipped for visitors and in a perfect location. It is peaceful because the window faces onto a courtyard, not the street. The apartment is homely and has everything you need including coffee and tea and a very helpful guide for advice on what to do around the city. We even managed to get out to ski at crystal mountain - the shuttle bus leaves from just a few blocks away. Definitely 5 stars!"
8487843,56742205,2015-12-17,17767321,Jc,"We really loved John's apartment! We got in very late, but this wasn't a problem because there was a lock box. The apartment is located in a safe and vibrant neighborhood. It was easily walkable to any place in the central business district or public transportation. The furnishings and details were beautiful! Although most of the furnishings were new, the apartment still has some interesting architectural details. The unit was very clean and we had everything we needed to prepare breakfasts. There is an informative guest guide to help with operation of appliances, etc., and recommendations for restaurants and activities. Internet is easy to access and fast. We would not hesitate for a moment to stay here again."
8487843,57058186,2015-12-21,34641414,Udit,"John, What an apartment! We felt so at home. Thanks for the personal note and snacks. The apartment was had everything we could ask for and thing we didn't even know we would need.  Being a coffee nerd I appreciated the French Press and kettle.  The info notebook was very helpful as well, including info on things to do and places to eat. The checkin and out process was easy.  The Apartment was clean when we checked in.  We stored our bags at Warwick, on the adjacent block after check out.  Equidistant to Space Needle, Pikes Place and Belltown. an I would stay here again for sure."
8487843,57978736,2015-12-30,34003173,Brian,The Sparrow's Rest was the perfect little getaway in the city. The bed is comfortable and the service is out of this world. The combination of John and Pillow's responsiveness are the best I've experienced on AirBnB. The unit opens to a courtyard and is very quiet considering the midtown location. Thanks again for a wonderful stay. 
7638263,53287182,2015-11-07,14858908,Terry,"Last week I had my first experience with Airbnb, at the home of Brian in Seattle.  It couldn't have been any better!  My accommodations were comfortable and immaculate, the coffee maker was ready every morning, and I had complete privacy.  The dogs, Albert and Flash, were friendly, quiet, and never around unless I asked to see them.  The location was perfect, just one block from friends I was visiting.  The neighborhood is quiet and safe, and Brian's home is just a block from the bus stop, with quick and easy access to downtown.  Just down the street from the bus is a wonderful bakery/cafe called Grand Central with authentic French croissants, among many delicious menu items.  There's also a wonderful Italian restaurant, Serafina, in walking distance.
My schedule included a late arrival and a late departure, which Brian graciously accommodated.
If you are looking for a comfortable place in a great location, I highly recommend Brian's Eastlake Private Room!"
7638263,54660787,2015-11-22,45020793,Shawn,"Brian's place was perfect! He gives you a whole floor to yourself - including a bedroom, small living room, and private bathroom - while also making his kitchen a welcome space if needed. Brian was very easy to communicate with prior to and during my stay. Coming and going is very easy also! Brian was fun to speak with while also giving plenty of space for quiet and privacy. Well worth it!"
7638263,55264638,2015-11-29,15262211,Mark,"I had a great stay at Brian's town home! The communication and directions were very good prior to arriving. Everything was as it was represented. You have a very clean room, bathroom and TV room next door. The Town home is close to the city, restaurants, and coffee shops. Thanks Brian, I look forward to staying there again! "
5030361,28057042,2015-03-16,11701860,Dan,"Min and his listing are both a delight. He's an incredibly attentive and welcoming host and he was always ready to show me a new great restaurant or destination in his beautiful city. Min's home is clean, well kept, tranquil and stylish. His living room and patio are great places to unwind after a day of exploring and the guest bedroom is very cozy and comfortable. I slept very well. Min's home is located in the fantastic and incredibly walkable neighborhood of Capitol Hill and is surrounded by fantastic dining experiences and coffee shops. It's a great way to experience the cultural center of Seattle living.

I had a fantastic time exploring the city with Min, who took me on a walk to Pike Place Market, a drive around various neighborhoods with points of interest, a walk to Volunteer Park and a trip to a beautiful waterfall outside of the city. If you want to see Seattle in a way you wouldn't by just visiting a hotel, this is definitely the way to go, and at a much more reasonable price. He's even got an amazing espresso maker to get you moving in the morning.  I can't recommend Min and his listing enough."
5030361,28191436,2015-03-19,29292349,Sean,Min was incredibly welcoming and knowledgable of the area. A beautiful space that is nearby to many great spots. A truly hospitable and enjoyable experience.
5030361,28360709,2015-03-22,29445577,Se Young,"Min definitely made me feel welcome. Even though I arrived in Seattle late night due to flight delay, he stayed awake waiting for me till I got there. Min's place was clean and organized. Bed I used at Min's place was pretty big and comfortable. I was happy that I could have such a great bedroom and a private bathroom. Listing description was very accurate. Min had also a beautiful living room and garden. On second day of my stay, we walked around neighborhood and he showed me some fabulous restaurants and shops around. He made breakfast with coffee for me before I left. That was so nice of him. I was supposed to be picked up before checkout time. My host family was not able to pick up at that time. Min generously let me stay for another hour. I would strongly recommend Min's place for those who are looking for a place to stay in Seattle. It is a great price and great service."
5030361,28535381,2015-03-25,2269987,Joe,"I had a fantastic time in Seattle, and Min was a great host in this great Capitol Hill apartment. Super clean and very comfortable bedroom, great private bathroom, and the rest of the apartment was well decorated, modern, and comfortable. Location can't be beat - easy walking distance to just about everything fun! Min was an ideal host - offered a ton of suggestions for things to do, made me excellent coffee, and was very friendly. Thanks for a great stay, Min!"
5030361,28738283,2015-03-29,9188762,Steven,"Our stay in Min's was great. He is very knowledgeable about the city of Seattle and gave us some very cool things to check out. Min is extremely welcoming and friendly. We were able to lounge in living and felt very comfortable with him. The apartment itself is also very nice, tidy, and well decorated. He has a lot of interesting books laying around. The bedroom was great and had everything we needed. Min's place in Cap Hill is well recommended for those looking for a place to stay in Seattle."
5030361,28846515,2015-03-30,20440219,Johnny,"Min is a great host and has an awesome place! 

As a host Min was very friendly and accomodating. He even allowed me to use his washer and dryer for my laundry and even showed me how he prepares coffee in the morning. 

Min was very helpful in giving me tips on where to go and what to do in Seattle and in Capitol hill. He clearly knows the area quite well.

His place is quite nice and unique. The room I stayed in is quite comfortable and his bathroom was just as nice as some hotels I stayed in. I loved his living room which has plenty of space to hang around in. He has plenty of books to read  and he makes an awesome cup of coffee. 

I'd love to stay with him again."
5030361,29123583,2015-04-04,25455233,M,It was fun staying at Min's house. We had a nice steak dinner together and it was good steak lol. Min was willing to help me when i had no idea what to do in Seattle. It was my first time using Airbnb and i'd like to use it more if my time permits. Thanks Min.
5030361,29523345,2015-04-08,24021680,Dai,"Min is a great host and his place is perfect. The apartment is located at Capitol Hill area which is quiet and nice. My friend and I had a lot of fun staying there.

Min's apartment is exactly what shows in the pictures, or even better. It is super neat, spacious, and well decorated and has everything you need. Min is very helpful and easygoing. He waited us until late night and gave us a lot of suggestions about what to do in Seattle.  Even though he was not home,  he was always willing to help. I wish I could stay in Seattle longer. 

Thanks, Min!

5030361,29953039,2015-04-14,24274529,Konny,"Definitely one of my favourite airbnb travel experience. I am a young female travelling to Seattle and Min definitely made my experience special. He is such an attentive host, check in was a breeze with him replying promptly to every single one of my messages. The house itself is beautiful inside and out, the shared spaces in the house is not only clean and cozy, but also tastefully decorated. My room was perfect, just the right size with everything I need including a desk and a large walk-in closet. The washroom was clean and everything was provided for your convenience. As it was my first time in Capitol Hill, Min was nice enough to help plan my trip around the area with every recommendations on point with what I wanted to see. The place is literally walking distance to everything, with the most charming cafés, restaurant and grocery stores just a couple blocks away. It is also just a short walk away from the Melrose market and the infamous Starbucks reserve. I honestly couldn't ask for more as I get to explore all the top spots in Capitol Hill within a short afternoon due to Min's diligent planning. Min is extremely kind and approachable, making me feel like home the first step I went into the door. Thank you for being such an amazing, caring and attentive host! I will definitely be staying at Min's place again the next time I find myself in Seattle!"
5030361,30161279,2015-04-18,30628741,Muriel,"Min est une personne très chaleureuse. Il a écrit de nombreux mails pour nous informer comment arriver chez lui et afin de nous mettre à l'aise. Min est une personne réservée et discrète et veut tout faire pour satisfaire le séjour des voyageurs. Capitol Hill est un quartier très intéressant, surtout pour diner le soir. Les restaurants sont à 5 minutes à pied de chez Min. Min nous a accompagné pour nous guider et pour finir nous sommes restés diner ensemble. C'était très agréable. Il veut absolument tout faire pour nous aider, son appartement est superbe. De très bon gout et impeccable, la chambre est grande et très joliment meublé. Les photos ne mettent pas assez en valeur la qualité de son appartement. Min nous invite à partager notre journée avec lui, tout en respectant l'intimité de chacun. Il le fait avec beaucoup de discrétion, ne s'impose pas: il veut vraiment faire au mieux. Nous avons beaucoup apprécié ces moments privilégiés. Dès notre arrivée, il nous fait visiter la maison, nous propose un café. Min est un hôte qui a envie de partager et qui est généreux, nous avons beaucoup été touchés par sa gentillesse. Seattle est très compliqué pour se garer. Min nous laisse une place de parking est s'est vraiment très appréciable. Nous sommes descendus à pied jusqu'à Pike Market 30 minutes, c'est une belle trotte! mais il y a les transports en commun pour y aller et pour y revenir pour ceux qui hésitent. Nous aimons ces quartiers un peu résidentiels, calme et avec beaucoup de charme. Nous le conseillons vraiment, c'est un très bon compromis."
5030361,30410090,2015-04-21,686684,Tushar,"I had a nice stay at Min's place. He was very welcoming and the apartment was comfortable. As a half-basement unit, it can be a little dark and cool, but Min has done a great job decorating and making the apartment feel comfortable."
5030361,30807158,2015-04-27,10566729,LauRen,"Min was very nice and lives in a great location. We didn't have a car, there were bus stops all aroud and Capitol Hill is very close to a lot of great restaurants (Go to the Wandering Goose - get the Aunt Annie's Biscuit). Or we took an Uber which was not expensive at all ($7 charge from Ba Bar - amazing Pho) We could also walk to Pike and Pine, and you could walk downtown but its a bit of a stretch. 

The room is a good size, has a closet, a desk and memory foam bed. Great for the price and for the location!  "
5030361,30998524,2015-04-30,30672824,Julius And Catherine,"Min was an AWESOME host. Our first day, he showed us around the neighborhood, which is ridiculously beautiful. He's super friendly and easy to talk to. His place is gorgeous, very clean and it even has a garden! Every morning, Min offered us coffee and tea. He was also nice enough to let us do a bit of laundry as well. Our bed was super comfy (I think it was memory foam!). Overall great experience and would highly recommend if you're looking for a knowledgable host and a beautiful place to say."
5030361,31618129,2015-05-07,18985698,Steven Henry,"Min was very welcoming, meeting me outside the apartment building and giving the full tour of the parking, key use, and the apartment.  He very much opened up his whole house to me and made me feel at home.  He is a very educated and interesting young man and we had several very good conversations.  He also made me a great espresso one morning."
5030361,31724119,2015-05-09,10085459,Meghan,"Min made us feel right at home. He has beautiful apartment in an amazing neighborhood. So glad we stayed in capital hill. The area offers great bars, restaurants and bakery's. We easily walked to downtown. The room and bathroom were very clean and had every amenity you would need."

5030361,32267949,2015-05-16,31880497,Jane,"Min was a wonderful host. Capital Hill is a fun area to stay-lots of boutiques and coffee shops and gorgeous residential neighborhoods. Min's place is on a beautiful area and you can see the Space Needle from his location.He greeted us warmly and was very accommodating. His condo is well appointed with interesting art work, neat, immaculately clean. Great memory foam bed, ample closet space, spotless bathroom, sheets and towels perfect, He prides himself in the amazing espresso machine and paraphernalia that goes along with it to make a perfect cup of espresso. It is about the best I've had. Thanks Min! His espresso equipment is world class! Min loves Seattle and shares his knowledge willingly of the area. Guests are welcome to sit in the living room, which overlooks a lovely garden area. Many interesting books are available as well. Loved staying there and would definitely book again. In fact I posted his listing on my FB page. Thanks Min for being a great host and opening up your home to us. "
5030361,32701685,2015-05-20,601904,Joe,"Min was a very gracious host who made us feel very welcome in his home.  From the moment we arrived, Min gave us recommendations for places to eat locally after a long flight, as well as plenty of ideas for the rest of the weekend.  He even went out of his way to personally escort us to some of the surrounding neighborhoods of Seattle that we could not have gotten to on foot.  The room was clean and the bed was comfortable.  The bathroom was very clean as well and had all the amenities and toiletries that we needed.  The house was in a great neighborhood with many good bars and restaurants in the area, and an easy walk to downtown.  We really enjoyed our stay in Seattle and would recommend Min's rental."
5030361,33377401,2015-05-27,4715450,Morgan,Byron and I really enjoyed staying at Mins . It was very central and we could walk everywhere. I will definitely stay here again . We even hung out and watched basketball together . He is a great host .
5030361,34225220,2015-06-06,30149653,Chris,"The apartment was great and Min was an excellent host. He provided tons of recommendations for the neighborhood and surrounding areas. Capitol Hill itself was a really fun place to stay with tons of restaurants, bars and shops to check out."
5030361,34725447,2015-06-11,6458161,Luca,"Stay at Min's was simply perfect. Min loves Seattle and surroundings and brought me all around the city to have a taste of it. His house is cosy, quiet, and clean. Capitol Hill is a perfect location to explore the city and to stay in a quiet and trendy area.
A beer, a glass of wine or a coffee to share are always ready for you if you decide to stay at Min's.
Highly recommended!

A casa di Min? Semplicemente perfetto! Min adora Seattle e dintorni ed è stato una guida perfetta per farmi assaporare la città. L'appartamento è molto accogliente, silenzioso e pulito. Capitol Hill è un quartiere ideale per esplorare la città restando in una zona trendy di Seattle.
Una birra, un bicchiere di vino od un caffè sono da condividere con Min sono sempre pronti se decidete di restare da lui.
Decisamente consigliato a chiunque!
"
5030361,35565541,2015-06-20,33002517,Deanna,"Min exceeded our expectation as a host. Is a incredibly knowledgeable on not only Seattle, but Washington in general and a lot of it's history. He was very hospitable and willing to give suggestions as to places to visit and eat. He was very accommodating and pays attention to details, which made me and my boyfriends stay comfortable. He is in Capitol Hill which is perfectly located walking distance to many cute restaurants and shops/boutiques. We walked a few times to pikes market place. There are so many pretty parks with lots of greenery around Min's place that are nice to take a stroll through. It's a quiet area but easily accessible to entertainment. I would say this area is accommodating for all ages and all interests (especially if you love coffee and food). "
5030361,35796595,2015-06-22,3960149,Maureen,"Min is an absolutely wonderful host.  He is very knowledgeable about Seattle, has great recommendations & makes fabulous coffee!  His apartment is extremely clean & quiet and has a very comfortable bed.  The apartment is also located in a great area near beautiful parks & plenty of shops & restaurants.   Min is very conscientious, accommodating and committed to helping his guests have a fantastic stay.  Thank you for everything, Min!"
5030361,36018346,2015-06-24,31477920,Frank,My wife was very nervous going to stay at someone's home we have never meet but after meeting Min things changed. We were so glad to have stayed at Min's beautiful home. Min is a fantastic host and his home is well kept and very clean. Min is very knowledgable not just of Seattle but also of the beautiful state of Washington. He showed us around Capitol Hill which was very beautiful. Min knows of the best places to eat and the best way to get around the city. We really enjoyed Min's hospitality and can't thank Him enough for making us feel at home and opening up his home to us. The neighborhood is peaceful and beautiful and just a couple of blocks of great places to eat and stores. My wife was very happy we chose to stay at Min's.  Staying at Min's is a decision you won't regret. 
5030361,36285027,2015-06-27,6190704,Pat,"Great location, close enough yet far enough so it remains a sweet little suburb of seattle. Min was full of suggestions of places to go and things to do so that made out stay easier. "
5030361,36675467,2015-06-30,24172131,All,"Min's place was clean and comfortable, and was exactly as pictured. He also provided all the necessary toiletries and linens. The location of his place was perfect because it was in the heart of Capitol Hill and it allowed for easy access to many shops, restaurants, bars, and parks. Min was also a wonderful host. He provided us insight about the geography/history of Seattle and local eats/attractions. 

Thank you Min for the many, many recommendations of stuff to do both in and outside of Seattle! Can't wait to visit the state of WA again!"
5030361,37054162,2015-07-04,4394242,Jerry,"My girlfriend and I had a fantastic three-night stay with Min. Min's home is nicely decorated and provided a cozy and welcoming atmosphere for our trip. Our room was clean, quiet, and comfortable, and had all the essentials we needed. Everything was exactly as he said on his helpful and comprehensive listing.

Min's apartment is conveniently located right in the heart Capitol Hill and provides easy access to numerous restaurants, coffee shops, and bars. We had no problem finding good eats and good coffee around the area.

Min was a great host and made sure that we had a great stay. Prior to our arrival, Min was very accommodating to our schedule and we always had a clear line of communication. Once we were there, he took us on a walking tour around the neighborhood and gave us recommendations for food and fun - which we greatly appreciated!

Overall, if you're looking to spend some time in cap hill, or just need a launch point for some exploring around Seattle, we highly recommend staying at Min's!

"
5030361,38271303,2015-07-14,6903202,Ivana,"Min's place is undoubtedly a 5 star hotel with a personal and cozy touch and home feel. The place is extremely tastefully designed. The pictures almost don't do it full justice. I loved his fancy espresso machine and sipping the coffee in his charming back yard patio/garden. There was a lovely energy in the whole apartment and I enjoyed coming back to the beautiful room. Min is a an extremely accommodating, professional and friendly host. He made me feel like I am staying with a friend. I would absolutely love to return in the future. I highly recommend his place. "
5030361,41397125,2015-08-07,1482494,Rachel,"Min's place is beautiful, clean, and full of gorgeous plants and wonderful art. It is in a fantastic, very convenient neighborhood full of great restaurants and bars. Yet the room was very quiet to sleep in and the bed/bedding very comfortable!  If you are a walker, you can walk to the Seattle Art Museum, indie movie theatre, and the Pike Place Market. Min was knowledgeable about the city and willing to pass along any tips or info."
5030361,41950067,2015-08-10,6982551,Erica & Adam,"This was probably the best Airbnb experience I've ever had! Min is simply a great host. He met us outside and hopped in our car to help us find a parking spot in his neighborhood. He had great recommendations for things to do in Capitol Hill and Seattle, made us lattes in the morning and encouraged us to take home some pears from his tree in the backyard. The apartment is in a great location, and I couldn't have been happier with our stay!"
5030361,42693359,2015-08-15,21688464,Jeff,"Great area, clean room, and Min was very pleasant and helpful. Great experience."
5030361,43237415,2015-08-18,25242539,Fiona,"Min was great - his place is clean and tidy, and is in a fantastic location. It's easily accessible by both bus and by foot, and is also close to all of the cool Capitol Hill locations. Min himself gave us several good suggestions about where to go and what to do - we would have, for example, missed out on the excellent farmer's market without his advice. He also let us keep our bags at his house past our noon check-out time, so that we didn't have to lug them around the city until heading to Sea-Tac at 5. When we return to Seattle, we'll definitely consider staying with Min again. "
5030361,43671976,2015-08-21,1182060,Amanda,"I decided to stay with family instead but Min was very good with communication and accommodated me with a key prior to check in so that I could drop off my bags before heading to my event downtown.  I highly recommend him to anyone, a very nice and honest person."
5030361,44910265,2015-08-30,13147058,Param,"I stayed here with my husband for 1 night. We checked in around mid night but Min was up to help us settle in . The apartment was beautifully decorated. The room was small but clean and cosy. We had our own bathroom outside our bedroom. The bathroom was well equipped with toileries and towels. If you like to stay close to the downtown,then this place is definitely worth a consideration."
5030361,45321813,2015-09-01,41911808,Stanton,"Min was a very gracious host.  He made some immediate recommendations on how to further enjoy our time in Seattle.  He was able to tell us all about area and even helped us map out where to go to start off the day with a nice cup of coffee and some good food. 
His home is exactly as pictured, and our private room and bath were well appointed, very comfortable and exactly what we were looking for.
I'm in the travel business and I definitely recommend Min's place. "
5030361,45783739,2015-09-06,34326905,Dorothy,Min made us feel very welcome; the listing was accurate and the location was attractive and very convenient to downtown Seattle.  We enjoyed our stay.

5030361,48003675,2015-09-22,41636882,Kevin,"Min was very warm, welcoming, and accommodating. He was quick to answer any questions concerning the logistics of my stay, met me upon arrival to discuss parking, and showed me around the surrounding community. His home is in a great location between Broadway and 15th. Lots of excellent restaurants/bars/coffee shops are in close proximity. The bed was comfortable, and the apartment was clean and cozy. If I'm ever in Seattle again, I will most certainly be staying with Min!"

Min was available via text to talk about parking, directions, and logistics. Min even switched his parking with me when I couldn't find a close location. The room was adorable, the bed was very comfortable, and I enjoyed being Min's guest. This is a shared space and shared entrance. I loved the location--central to absolutely everything."

I'd recommend this place to anyone visiting Seattle and will likely be going back again. His place is very clean, located close enough to downtown to walk everywhere and in a cool neighborhood with a lot to do. "
5030361,52339282,2015-10-28,44042677,Andy,"We had a nice stay in this space. The condo was very cozy and clean. Min was more than accommodating, and was great at pointing out some local places to check out. He was easy to keep contact with and responded in a timely manner"
5030361,52970162,2015-11-03,1756663,Sarah,Really great location.  Not a bad cab ride to the airport or from Amtrak.  Easy to walk to major streets with so much to do.  The space is very cool and it was easy to pick up keys.  Would be great to sit in the garden but it rained during our trip but it looks nice.  
5030361,53507066,2015-11-09,5140049,Alysia,"Min was an absolute lovely host, very warm and welcoming and made sure everything I needed was set up and at my disposal throughout my stay. He was also great at recommending places in the area to eat, get coffee, etc. His apartment is beautiful and very quiet - I felt right at home! I'd stay with Min any time I go back to Seattle."
5030361,53688174,2015-11-11,37098236,Jenna,"Min was awesome! His apartment is in such a great part of the city and he was wonderful at giving recommendations.

Thanks Min!"
5030361,55472263,2015-12-01,43812837,Angel,Min has a beautiful warm home. We felt like home during the stay. He did an awesome job decorating his place.  Unfortunately he was out of town during out stay and we haven't met before we left. 
5030361,56603121,2015-12-15,47938826,Amanda,Both Min and Seattle were fabulous. Min gave outstanding restaurant and coffee shop recommendations and was very hospitable. Hope to be back again one day!
5534463,28059908,2015-03-16,29070617,Katelyn,"We had an amazing weekend on the Oasis at Bell Harbor Marina in downtown Seattle. Chuck made sure we knew everything we needed to about operating the lights, sinks and toilets before leaving us and even offered to take us out for a ride (which unfortunately we had to turn down due to time restraints). He also let us know he was only a phone call away for any questions or problems. The boat is absolutely beautiful, it is extremely well maintained and well styled. It is hard not to feel like a movie star as you sit in the harbor in downtown Seattle on the biggest yacht in the marina! This was the experience of a lifetime and we hope to go back and do it again to take a trip up to the San Juan Islands. "
5534463,30712721,2015-04-26,15166172,William,AWESOME!!! First and foremost Chuck is an outstanding host and his hospitality is first rate. We stayed the weekend for a bachelor party. He made sure we were prepared for the ensuing weekend by giving us tips about the area and where to find provisions. Chuck helped us get familiar with the boat and made us feel at home. He was honest and more than willing to accommodate us. The boat was parked within easy walking distance of the local nightlife. If I return to Seattle in the future I will be calling Chuck first for accommodations. 
5534463,41931565,2015-08-10,380960,Aaron,Fantastic experience!  Chuck is incredibly friendly and welcoming.  He's the type of host you'd be happy to hangout with.  In fact we did!  Some friends and I took a tour on the yacht with Chuck and had a wonderful time.  I highly recommend you do the same if you stay on his wonderful boat.  I have stayed in many Airbnb over the last several years and have had a great experience the majority of the time.  This was by far the best experience I have ever had.  I was blown away at how amazing the yacht was and how friendly and hospitable Chuck was.  I hope I am able to stay here again next year when we return.  
5534463,42566307,2015-08-14,10475331,Jason,Amazing experience on boat!  Chuck met us at dock and took us through tour of yacht.  He had water and beer for us.  He made our family vacation end on a very high note!  Family with 4 kids under 11.
5534463,42859782,2015-08-16,35782015,Barbara,"Our experience on the Oasis was top notch from start to finish. The owner/captain, Chuck was terrific! He was most welcoming and accommodating. The yacht was clean and comfortable and we had great views. It was a fun experience and I would highly recommend staying here when you're in Seattle. Better than being in a hotel, especially, if you're looking for something different and fun! It truly was a delightful experience and will be recommending The Oasis to all my friends."
5534463,44417156,2015-08-26,22503021,Jennifer,"Highlights of the trip were Chuck's hospitality, a cruise around Lake Washington, the two large staterooms, and breakfast on the back deck.  The third cabin was fine for my teenage boy (or would have been great for two younger kids).  The fourth cabin (off the back deck) would be good for someone who didn't mind the smell of diesel and liked to be isolated from the rest of the boat (I chose to sleep on the hideabed in the main salon instead).  The salon, kitchen and back deck were great.  Chuck had to change the mooring to Westlake Ave on Lake Union just before we came; there is a Starbucks nearby for breakfast.  Loved watching the seaplanes take off nearby in the early morning and evening."
5534463,44692409,2015-08-28,25205098,Rachae,"Chuck was amazing.  He was very accommodating to our group.  The boat was great, clean, lots of room for our group of 20 to hang out and enjoy the afternoon cruise.  We will definitely be back to the boat soon!!  Thanks Chuck! "
5534463,44888363,2015-08-30,30787158,Jeff,Chuck was very easy to work with and the accommodations were great. We truly enjoyed the two days on his Yaht. 
5534463,46698927,2015-09-13,33194307,Josh,"Wow!  Our weekend on The Oasis was everything we expected times 500.  From Chuck explaining everything to us, to the cleanliness and quality of the boat, and to the cruise on Lake Washington, this was a one-of-a-kind experience that anyone staying in the Seattle area should consider.  Chuck was readily available to answer a couple of questions we texted him throughout the weekend, but little was needed.  He has the boat set up for an amazing experience to make memories that last a lifetime.  "
6425652,38602225,2015-07-17,29587926,Michael,"Our hosts were very nice.  The neighborhood was different than expected, but not bad.  It's a long trek up to Broadway, and a short trek down to the South end of Lake Union, where you can find a few restaurants.  However, the apartment is right next to a very loud freeway.  Perhaps this wouldn't matter much in the winter, but the place has no a/c, so we had to keep windows open, and the traffic was really too loud.
One other thing guests should know: the apartment is on the top floor of a four or five storey building with no elevator."
6425652,42022301,2015-08-10,39247069,Patricia,"Cameron was awesome! So friendly, kind and very easy going.  Great place! Comfortable, clean and quite large! The pics do not do the view justice.  I would definitely stay here again!"
6425652,43142347,2015-08-17,40416624,John,A very nice clean apartment with a great view. There was some freeway noise that didn't bother us but might bother some people. Cameron was very easy to deal with.
6425652,46202803,2015-09-08,14416585,Matt,"Hosts were kind and professional and timely. The apartment was clean and it was only a 4 dollar Uber ride to get to any part of capitol hill we wanted. The freeway noise was noticable, but we got used to it after the first night."
6425652,48940224,2015-09-29,18464617,Cory,"Cameron was an excellent host! The meeting time was flexible and he was there to greet me and show me around. 

Cameron's apartment was great. An awesome view of Lake Union and a great location right off the freeway. Wifi was good and rooms were comfortable. "
7396508,43713069,2015-08-21,4665692,Tracy,"5+ Star Rating!!  Andy is the most amazing host.  Not only is his property beautiful, well maintained, and fully equipped, but he was, hands down, the best host I've ever worked with.  He was responsive, kind, and incredibly helpful. Even though he was travelling, he was completely accessible to us and helped our group with everything we needed and beyond.  It truly made our trip! 

Highly recommended !  Our Seattle trips will now all be to Andy's properties because we know that the quality and service will be top notch!!  

"
7396508,47235666,2015-09-16,5440976,Carlos Javier,"They made us feel so welcomed we came back to Seattle from Portland and stayed at their other unit our last night in Seattle and it was just as good as the last time.  We even got another bottle of wine!  

The unit was quite, comfortable, clean, and the new appliances are a nice touch.  I would stay there again, again, and again.  The kitchen is  very spacious.  Great hosts and the location is just amazing. They accommodated  us at the last minute and made it all work.  



"
7396508,47429726,2015-09-18,37039633,Dan,"What a great property.  Clean, well-appointed, spacious and very much like home.   Sure can't say that about the typical hotels I normally stay in when up in Seattle on business. Excellent location to be able to get virtually anywhere in Seattle easily - whether by your own car or public transport.  Quiet and comfortable, too.  All of the personal touches were magnificent and really makes you feel welcomed.  I would recommend staying here any time when visiting Seattle - whether that's for business or vacation/pleasure.  Cheers!"
7396508,47587765,2015-09-20,14682069,Martin,"Andy went above and beyond to make myself and my colleague feel at home. He took great steps to provide me a detailed welcome package that included information on Wifi, traffic, his own background and much more. In addition to this, he was available to not only help me navigate my way through Seattle to his home for an early check in but Andy took a moment to create a welcome bag for me! It made me experience go from staying at a strangers home to feeling in a place of friends. "
7396508,48225973,2015-09-24,28233449,Eric,"Andy was the very model of an Airbnb host: communicative, thoughtful, gracious, accommodating of our changing needs. He made sure our stay was comfortable and enjoyable. The apartment was spacious, bright, and centrally located. Perfect!"
7396508,48929795,2015-09-29,8895665,Anna,"I highly recommend staying at Andy's place. Andy was very welcoming and incredibly helpful with all of our questions. We stayed in this 1b apt for 4 days and it was great. Andy provided us with several fresh towels to use throughout our stay. Andy was even kind enough to leave us a welcoming note and a bottle of wine for our celebration. He also left us a goodie bag with plenty of snacks that we took with us and really enjoyed on our hikes! This was my first rental and I couldn't be happier with the result. The apt is in a great location to downtown and has several fun restaurants within walking distance. I definitely recommend reading through Andy's tour guide for helpful tips to make the most out of your visit to Seattle. All in all - if you're heading to Seattle, this is the place for you! "
7396508,50777793,2015-10-14,44436650,Rusty," Staying at Andy's place was really awesome.  He was a great host.  Made me feel welcome and was always available if I needed anything.  He checked on me several times to make sure I was good. The apartment was as promised and very comfortable in an excellent location for me visiting my son in Capitol Hill.  They left me a bottle of Washington wine and a bag of goodies--chips, candy, cookies, water, etc. (Nice touch). I will stay at this place the next time I return to Seattle.  It's apparent that he takes good care and maintains the apartment very well."
7396508,51383921,2015-10-19,43477241,Billy,We had an awesome time at Andy's rental. It was comfortable and spacious for two. It was also very clean. Andy had great recommendations for Seattle. I would  definitely stay here again!
7396508,52747225,2015-11-01,1400778,Alexis,Andy is a super-attentive host. He went out of this way to satisfy my needs and make sure my stay was comfortable. Would definitely like to be his guest again. Thank you!
7396508,53706222,2015-11-11,667783,Robert,We had a big group (none of us had been to Seattle before) and Andy was a fantastic and accommodating host for us.  The house was really nicely furnished and the location has great access to both downtown and Redmond.  Highly recommend staying here!
6215943,34331826,2015-06-07,11176757,Zahida,"If you're looking for a breathtaking, relaxing, family-friendly, and conveniently located place to stay in Seattle, this is it! The house is minutes from Lincoln Park and Fauntleroy Park (both amazing in their own right), local restaurants and artsy boutiques, and maybe a 10 minute drive to the freeway.  Given the house's spectacular views, you'll be able to catch the sunset over Puget Sound and the Olympic Mountains every night.  It's absolutely beautiful!

The house is also very funky, in a great way!  They have an awesome downstairs area with a lounge, yoga space, 2 sleepover-style beds, and workspace.  Between the yard, the patio, and deck, you'll have plenty of spaces to enjoy yourself and relax.  There's even a canoe!  The place is funky fresh!

Colleen was honestly the best AirBnB host I've had to date!  She left a welcome packet for my family and tons of books on things to do in Seattle.  Better yet, she gave us her cell phone in case we had any questions.  

You will enjoy yourself here and feel very welcome.  "
6215943,39923504,2015-07-27,12415989,Michael,"Nice house, nice furniture, sheets etc.Located in a nice upper middle class neighborhood in the city close to downtown. several restaurants and shops close by and an excellent park about 5 minutes away. We used the park a lot for the adults to run and kids to play. Very quiet and safe neighborhood."
6215943,41296810,2015-08-05,37665814,Michael,"It was a very nice house in a quiet but interesting neighbourhood - close to parks and the seafront. Lovely sitting-room, sleeping-rooms and bath-rooms. We felt at home from the first moment."
6215943,45067473,2015-08-31,16550979,Jennifer,"The house was exactly as described, not to mention clean and welcoming. This was a spacious place to stay, even with five adults. The house had everything we needed, including ample linens. Colleen was helpful and completely unobtrusive; the neighborhood was lovely and the view of the Sound from the dining room was relaxing and nice. Downtown is just a Rapid bus ride away from a stop just down the block, or about a fifteen minute drive. Overall, a very nice place and a good stay! The garden was fun and we enjoyed grilling some nice steaks one of the evenings we stayed. Would definitely recommend."
6215943,45761843,2015-09-05,37608777,Himanshu,The host canceled this reservation the day before arrival. This is an automated posting.
6215943,49333969,2015-10-03,11030949,Bob,"This place is way nicer then the photos!  Very clean, nicely laid out, cool place.  I especially like the back yard garden.  Great location, nice view, room for many, there is nothing not to like!"
6215943,52816016,2015-11-02,34765808,Teri,We felt comfortable in the neighborhood and could walk to the wedding venue and restaurants.  The house was perfect for us and the host was as well.
8306501,47846437,2015-09-21,43882163,Alexandria,"As my first Airbnb experience, I was a little nervous but instantly felt right home! My room was super cute and I had my own bathroom that came with body wash, shampoo, conditioner and towels which was a huge plus. Their outside deck had an absolutely beautiful and stunning view of the Olympics (I'm a very outdoorsy person so that was something extra special for me while I visited). Also a great location - only a few minute walk to downtown Fremont. I stayed with them for 10 days and it really felt like my home away from home. I highly recommend staying with this awesome and super friendly couple! My first experience was 100x better than I could've imagined. "
8306501,48469663,2015-09-26,6721280,Sonja & Roman,We had an absolutely perfect stay at Katha's and Matt's place. It's situated in a very nice neighbourhood and the room is just beautiful. The two of them were always there for us when we had a question and informed us about great concert locations in Seattle. We can definitely recommend this place to all travellers  out there.  
8306501,49815158,2015-10-06,3644545,Natasha,"We really enjoyed our visit with Katha and Matt! They were such kind and welcoming hosts, and they really made us feel at home in Seattle. And they have two of the most adorable cats in the world! 

The room was cozy and warm, with an awesome chandelier. I also appreciated the ease of street parking near the house and the convenient distance to downtown Fremont and Ballard. Everything was straightforward and true to description.

Thank you to Katha, Matt, Marvin, and Mr. Bear for a wonderful stay! "
8306501,50534037,2015-10-12,13412245,Jennifer,"Katha's husband was there to greet us and was very inviting. He showed me around the place which had a charming, ""hipster-ish"" vibe. The deck was beautiful. We had our own bathroom but it was downstairs so it was a little inconvenient at times. Especially when I started feeling unwell and was diagnosed with appendicitis =/ Anyway, Katha and her husband were very nice about letting us stay a little longer in the home than anticipated."
8306501,50985918,2015-10-16,9029425,Kimberley,"The two things I loved most about Katha's home were the location and views. It's in a quiet area, yet within walking distance from Fremont. Ballard is a very short drive (these are my two favorite Seattle neighborhoods).
The room itself offered plenty of closet space, a desk, and a comfy pull-out bed. It was also nice to have a private bathroom although I should note that one has to walk through the house to the basement to access it. 
Katha and her husband were very pleasant to chat with but still allowed me my privacy. They were also very accommodating about check-in/out times. Overall, a great stay!"
8306501,51877417,2015-10-24,31248389,Meagan,Katha gave us a tour when we arrived and made sure we knew where everything was and that we had what we needed.  Offered to let me use her blowdryer which was nice. 
8306501,55230560,2015-11-29,3506806,Sue,"This is a spacious room with a view in a house where the couple lives. It’s suitable for a short period and for the price. You could hear the chats outside so I suggest a small fan or a space heater to block the noise and feel more privacy.  Matt supplied a space heater which was nice, he was more available and ready to help. 

Some parts of the house are still being renovated so they are oldish.
I stayed over two weeks so I needed more privacy after that. I had access to the bathroom upstairs which was a better deal than the other reviews. There are two cats that come in and out. 

The kitchen is shared, so there is limited accessibility to preparing meals. I felt like I was getting in the way sometimes. 
For me, it’s been a while since I shared a space, so it felt a bit awkward, and I am a New Yorker who’s more open and inclusive than the average Seattle person. But all that said, the room and bathroom were equipped and served the purpose. 

Fremont is very cutet, it feels like a suburb at first but you can walk a few blocks down into the town center, it's a very small quaint area with nice cafes and bars. When the sun is out, it feels great."
3554558,23326165,2014-11-29,15837167,Marcie,"We very much enjoyed our stay at Of the Tree and Clouds.  Jacqueline was an excellent host, providing a ton of information through Seattle specific books, magazines and maps on the very best attractions that the city has to offer.  The location is very convenient to get to downtown Seattle without much hassle and easily walkable to central Fremont shops and restaurants with great access to the Burke-Gilman trail.  The apartment is comfortable and has everything that you'd need in a vacation rental with an airy view towards Queen Anne over the canal.  We felt very welcome here and highly recommend this accommodation!"
3554558,23498271,2014-12-02,2156449,Lisa,"We recently stayed in Jacqueline's place for a quick weekend getaway to Seattle and it was just perfect! We were welcomed with a lovely card and a chocolate bar from the local chocolatier. Jacqueline was a gracious host, checking in with us to make sure we had everything we needed for a comfortable stay. We happened to be visiting during an unusual cold spell and. when I couldn't find an extra blanket, she delivered one to the rental the next day! The rental itself is clean, well-decorated, and has a modern kitchen with all the essential amenities. The location of the rental was a perfect base from which to explore some of Seattle's best neighborhoods. It is a 10-minute walk to the heart of Fremont and a longer, more-adventurous walk to Ballard. We look forward to our next stay here at this lovely gem!"
3554558,23689514,2014-12-08,1402827,Natalie,"We stayed at Of the Trees and Clouds for a long weekend visiting our old stomping grounds, family and friends. The space itself is a perfect getaway unit for up to 4 people. In our case, it was 2 and a toddler. Jacqueline's prep for our stay with our little one made traveling way easier with toys, a pack n play, high chair, diaper pail,  BOB stroller, even kids towels,  readily available for our use! Cozy in decor, and relatively sound proof. 

The location was perfectly between Fremont and Ballard, and very walkable to Fremont's main commerce area. If you are here for work at Adobe or Google, this is a great alternative to a hotel.

Jacqueline was very responsive and   proactive in reaching out to make sure we settled in OK. We will definitely keep this option in mind for future visits."
3554558,24533170,2014-12-30,17171176,Terry,"My husband & I stayed at this lovely, comfortable, & spacious apartment on our recent visit over the Christmas holidays while visiting our son.  The space was wonderful with a full kitchen (cooking utensils, Keurig + K-cups) which was ideal.  The view of the canal from the wall of windows was fantastic and it was a short walk to the trail and downtown Fremont area."

3554558,26398590,2015-02-11,9933741,Ana,"Jacqueline is a kind and great host. We enjoyed our stay at this beautiful apartment. It had everything we needed. We loved the full kitchen, comfortable bed, and the living room with fireplace and big windows. We stayed a lot in the apartment to relax and unwind after touring the city because it was so cozy. The location is perfect. I highly recommend this place if you're visiting Seattle. =)"
3554558,26694948,2015-02-17,26504048,Kevin,The place was great! Super comfortable and clean. The location is great for exploring different parts of the city. Jacqueline was very nice and laid all the details out clearly. All and all a great apartment in a beautiful part of Seattle. Would definitely stay here again. 
3554558,27071980,2015-02-24,27643209,James,"First off, the apartment is fantastic.  It's very comfortable and very close to all Freemont has to offer. Jacqueline was very helpful and easy to get a hold of. She checked in on us frequently to make sure that we were enjoying our stay and that everything was up to our standards. I would recommend her place to anyone."
3554558,27369425,2015-03-02,8190421,Adam,Great location in a great neighborhood! Hose was clean and welcoming.  Jacqueline was friendly and helpful! Definitely staying here the next time I'm in Seattle!
3554558,27533137,2015-03-07,16496578,Drasi,"Second time staying with Jacqueline but in a different apartment.  Everything was wonderful, comfy bed, super clean and cute, light and bright and wonderful chocolate!!
I highly recommend this apartment and Jacqueline is the perfect hostess- I always feel welcome and cared for."
3554558,28001551,2015-03-16,9195919,Michael,"Jacqueline and Tom were great hosts! They were attentive and answered any questions we had regarding our future move to Seattle. Additionally, they checked up on us every few days to make sure we had everything we needed in the unit. "
3554558,28368522,2015-03-22,24411652,Jeff,"Jacqueline's apartment was great! It was super clean, well decorated, the kitchen was well equipped, and it had a nice table + desk in front of huge windows to sit and work at. The neighborhood is quiet, with easy parking, but the center of Fremont is just a short walk away. Really nothing to complain about here, and I can definitely recommend! "
3554558,28696443,2015-03-29,23829943,Jim,Great Place! First time to Seattle for my wife and I to visit our Son and daughter-n-law. They live in Fremont and this was really convenient. Has all amenities but no TV which was NICE!!!.. Will definitely stay again if available.
3554558,29173451,2015-04-05,762629,Jeannine,"Jacqueline is a wonderful host - she is responsive, quick, intuitive, and makes you feel welcome from the moment you step into one of her homes. I was especially impressed by her attention to detail - extra blankets, plenty of hot beverages, and even different shampoos for different hair types. We loved our stay at her place, and would gladly move in permanently.
"
3554558,29676673,2015-04-11,16496578,Drasi,"As always, Jacqueline is the perfect hostess.  My second time staying in this apartment and every bit as wonderful as the first.  Clean, comfortable and cozy."

3554558,32334895,2015-05-17,29322312,Hayley,"This was our first experience using Airbnb, and it was all that we expected and more. Jacqueline and Tom were such great hosts! The space was very clean and cozy and stocked with everything we could need. The neighborhood was great with lots of places to eat and shop within walking distance. We would love to stay here again next time we visit Seattle! 
"
3554558,33433001,2015-05-28,21019949,Robert,"The listing was accurate and the apartment was even better than advertised. It was beautifully decorated and meticulously clean. Jacqueline made us feel welcome and everything easy - from finding the place to gaining entry, to a welcoming Theo's chocolate bar, to great resource material on the area and Seattle. Parking was available on the property and on the block. Everything we needed was an easy walk. The view from the windows was great. Bed and all furniture was comfortable. The kitchen well equipped. We will for sure want to come back to this apartment. Thank you Jacqueline and family."
3554558,34555808,2015-06-09,504401,Shauna,"I thoroughly enjoyed my 4-night stay at Jacqueline's beautiful apartment. It's very clean, cozy, bright and airy, and was stocked with everything travelers would need during their stay, including a Bluetooth speaker for guests' listening pleasure. The keyless entry system was very easy to use. Conveniently located, the apartment is within a 15 minute drive of downtown and many of Seattle's most popular destinations. It served as a relaxing base of operations during my visit. I highly recommend a stay at any of Jacqueline's properties. She is a pleasant, conscientious, responsive host."
3554558,34785086,2015-06-12,12034340,Sara,"The apartment was even more gorgeous than the pictures, and you can tell from all the little touches that Jacqueline takes pride in it. The full kitchen was beautiful and well-stocked, the pull-out couch was very comfortable and the balcony was lovely. Jacqueline was a very responsive and helpful host, and we had a great time!"
3554558,35453003,2015-06-19,186189,D'Vorah,"I loved staying in Jacqueline's one-bedroom apartment. The location was great, close to my friend's home, 10 mins walk to Fremont, stores and shops, PNC market, Fred Meyers, as well as bus lines to downtown or elsewhere. The apartment was beautifully decorated and comfortable, and I loved cooking in the open kitchen while the setting sun bathed the entire room in soft light. My friends and I sat on the balcony and enjoyed the view. It was so convenient to do my laundry on my last night! Jacqueline was friendly, available and responded promptly to my request for screens (which had been left off of the new windows in oversight), but was totally respectful and would have left me alone had I not approached her myself! :) I highly recommend this apartment, it was truly a lovely stay."
3554558,36003217,2015-06-24,12024105,Janet,Listing was very accurate.  Jacqueline was a great host.  Was easy to get a hold of when we needed something.  Apartment was very comfortable.  Kitchen was awesome!
3554558,36282913,2015-06-27,32717294,Jhon,"The apartment was beautiful, great location. There are  a few buses to downtown making getting around very easy.  and may I add that there is a 3am pizza place at the bottom of the hill? I highly recommend this place, and Jacqueline was really such a fantastic host always making sure we were well settled. "
3554558,36767200,2015-07-01,3125666,Michel,Très jolie et agréable appartement situé dans un quartier attrayant et (email hidden)is bruyant car proche de routes très déservies
3554558,37731175,2015-07-10,28129822,Stephen,"This was our first trip to Seattle and we fell in love with the city. Our stay at this apartment was a great experience. There are a ton of cool bars and restaurants within walking distance and a Uber ride to downtown cost a mere $10. Not to mention there is a world famous studio right around the corner from this apartment! Reciprocal Recordings! (Nirvana, Death Cab, etc). Our host was great and we were very pleased with our first Air B&B experience."
3554558,38371415,2015-07-15,5431893,Tracy,"A wonderful home away from home!  We visited Seattle for 5 days in mid-July.  Jacqueline's apartment was beautiful and the deck was perfect for relaxing after a long day!  The location is great - close to downtown Fremont, a quick bus ride to downtown Seattle, and easy access to lots of other fun neighborhoods.  The kitchen is stocked with everything you could need.  We're already talking about our next trip to Seattle, including staying at Jacqueline's place again!"
3554558,38979461,2015-07-20,3901470,Jennifer,"Jacqueline was a very thoughtful host.  She left books for my daughter to read that she thought she would like, and she did!  There were lots of Seattle magazines and tour guides that were very useful to us.  She also left us a sweet card, a delicious bar of local chocolate, and there were nice extras like Keuerig coffee complimentary.

The location was ideal (about 10 minutes walk from the center of the Fremont area) and also very close to the super-swanky revitalized Ballard neighborhood.

It was nice to stay in Seattle without staying right downtown.  Fremont is a much more relaxing location to start and end your days."
3554558,39597781,2015-07-25,25516459,Natalie,"Both Jacqueline and the apartment were fantastic. Jacqueline was very kind and responsive throughout the entire process. The apartment was clean, beautiful, and in a great location. We would certainly stay again. "
3554558,40079901,2015-07-28,15910885,R,"We had a great experience. Jacqueline was very accommodating. She had made it feel like a second home. Decor is a well thought out minimalist. Perfect for a vacation or get away. Apartment is fully stocked and conveniently located. Our family of 4 was very comfortable. We were in the heart of Seattle in close  proximity to many parks, restaurants, coffee houses, shopping, and activities. I would highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a pleasant stay as a local in Seattle."
3554558,40589608,2015-08-01,34077089,Michael,This was my first AirBNB experience and it was wonderful. The house was well appointed and plenty of useful information was provided. It was well situated which made navigating the city a breeze. Would definitely stay here again if it is available.

Especially liked the chocolate factory and the multiple places to drink coffee within walking distance. The apartment is very nice, well maintained and has everything one would need, including a washer and dryer. Although I did not meet my host, Jacqueline was very helpful while communicating using texts. Highly recommended, I would stay there again."
3554558,43354039,2015-08-19,4201740,Mary,"Jacaueline's top floor in Fremont is top drawer.  The accomodation itself was very tastefully decorated, as well as providing everything one would need...beautifully laid out functional Kitchen...spacious calm bedroom.  Nice outdoor deck.
Everything was in walking distance in the Fremont neighborhood..great places to Eat.
Jacqueline, herself was kind enough to get items returned to me that I had left behind.  She also met me with an umbrella (desperately needed) the afternoon of my arrival.  I would definitely stay here again while in Seattle."
3554558,44532652,2015-08-27,36165826,John,Wife and I enjoyed our stay very much. Great place and great location. Everything you need is within walking distance. Apartment was everything we needed and more. Host went above and beyond with all the little extras. We will stay here again the next time we are in Seattle.
3554558,45462674,2015-09-03,6336588,Holger,"When you know Seattle and the Fremont/Ballard area, this is the place to stay. We had a great time and convenient access to all the things we love in that area. The apartment was clean and practical with all the nice amenities you need for a family stay. The streets are a bit busy and it sits in the industrial area called Frelard. Not a big issue for anyone who appreciates the charm of that part of the city. The host was very attentive and made our stay very pleasant."
3554558,45951200,2015-09-07,24698319,McKenzie,"My boyfriend and I had a wonderful time at this apartment! Beautiful decor and perfect location. Many restaurants, bars and shops well within walking distance. Jacqueline was a gracious host and available if we needed her! Highly recommend!"
3554558,46704032,2015-09-13,8093015,Chance,"Jacqueline's place was perfect to explore seattle. Comfortable bed, friendly and helpful host. Perfect for a casual trip to Seattle or for one who wants to see everything. 

"
3554558,47374116,2015-09-18,6730756,Sonia,"Jacqueline and her lovely daughter made us feel extremely welcome in Fremont and the Top Floor is just lovely! Jacqueline has gone to every effort to make it as comfortable and accommodating as possible. Seattle is a truly wonderful city to visit as a tourist and this was a perfect springboard location to set out from, each morning! Thank you so very much!"
3554558,48882353,2015-09-29,39082203,Debra,"We arrived late at night. The owner had left lights on for us. The apartment was warm. There was a personal note from the owner along with a chocolate bar! What a nice warm welcome that was! 
The apartment was very comfortable for 2 people. Lovely balcony. Nice big windows. Well stocked kitchen (though we ate out every meal). And, the perfect location! Just a few blocks to lots of great bars and restaurants in the Fremont district. We rarely needed our car. I will definately use this place again next time I'm in Seattle!"
3554558,49783190,2015-10-06,3330740,Selby,"This place is incredible! I love the way it was decorated :) it was so close to so many restaurants, bars, yoga classes, and beautiful walks along the water. Definitely away from the typical touristy stuff, but close enough when we wanted to do that. Jacqueline and Tom were great! Gave us complete privacy, but helped in a heartbeat when we needed them to. "
3554558,51462551,2015-10-20,25061176,Lizette,We had an amazing time during our stay in Seattle. Our rooftop flat in Fremont was perfect - beautifully decorated and well stocked kitchen. We visited Seattle to visit my daughter who is attending Cornish College of the Arts. The space was the perfect size for the three of us. The location also can't be beat and we had a great time at the Fremont Sunday Market and enjoyed our misty walk to Ballard. The best part however was simply hanging out at the flat. My daughter worked on her project while my son and I prepared dinner and college meals for my daughter to have when our visit came to a close. Would love to come back and stay here again. 
3554558,52060158,2015-10-26,26024656,Emily,Our stay was great!  The host was communicative and helpful. The apartment is charming and decorated beautifully. We enjoyed the amenities provided. The apartment is close to many things and a short bus ride from downtown. Would highly recommend!
3554558,52729791,2015-11-01,1767541,Dann,"Jacqueline is a wonderful, hospitable host. We loved staying at her place, and were really happy we stumbled on it. She is accommodating, considerate, and a wonderful communicator. We'd love to stay again in the future."
3554558,53937425,2015-11-14,9361467,Tom,Super easy set up. Friendly host who coordinated everything seamlessly. Well located and nice and comfy house. Internet a bit patchy- only drawback.
3554558,54249227,2015-11-17,45995307,Becky,"We had a wonderful stay at this beautiful apartment. Plenty of space for us (2 adults, 1 kid). Photos and description are very accurate. Good location-- easy access to Downtown, and short walk to restaurants and shops in Fremont. Jacqueline was very easy to communicate with, and made us feel welcome. There was even a Spiderman towel in the bathroom for my son :)"
3554558,55604380,2015-12-03,1393779,Cara,"Jacqueline's apartment was exactly as described and hoped for. We loved having space to cook and eat in Seattle. It was a plentiful size apartment for 3 adults (including one couple). She has lots of special touches throughout the apartment including a hair-dryer, lots of kitchen supplies, and lots of books and tourist information to keep you occupied. 

Fremont is a great little neighborhood to stay in and you can easily walk to downtown Fremont from the apartment. The Burke-Gilman trail is also very convenient to the apartment. 

I didn't like parking in the tight parking lot, but there was usually a space on the street directly in front of the apartment. 

The only caveat is that there is a construction company that works on weekdays outside the apartment, so if you are a light sleeper (or sleeping in the sofa bed), you may be bothered when they start working early weekdays (~6AM). 

Overall, we would be very happy to stay here again, especially in the warmer weather when you could enjoy the little patio and more of the outdoors activities that Seattle has to offer. 
"
3554558,57752291,2015-12-29,22906541,Wanda,"We loved staying at this place and would come back again. The small touches made the experience like staying at home. The host provided us with coffee, tea and there were dishes, bowls, wine glasses, pots and pans and everything necessary for cooking on a stove, oven, and microwave. There were extra boxes of tissue for our noses due to the cold and wet Seattle weather and paper towels for unexpected spills and even books and a puzzle to keep us occupied without the need of a television. The Bose system and wifi was excellent. During the holidays, we streamed Christmas songs and played old fashion guessing games using our iPhones! Thanks for providing a great family experience."
7531405,48958277,2015-09-29,7649746,Garett,"Ben and Haley were the perfect hosts.  Super friendly, accommodating, and amazing.  Their home is stunning, comfortable and all around a perfect home away from home. I would love to stay here again on my next trip to Seattle. I would highly recommend their home to anyone traveling to Seattle. Thanks again for an amazing stay!! "
7531405,49703145,2015-10-05,19112847,Janneke,"We had a great time at Ben and Haley's! The room was clean, spacious and had a good bed. Ben and Haley were great hosts, they even made us breakfast! We would definitively recommend this place to other people!"
7531405,50359979,2015-10-11,33915632,Anne,Ben & Haley are warm and welcoming! The room is awesome! I had a really good experience staying here. I would totally stay here again! 
7531405,51469775,2015-10-20,12412161,Kazumi,The place is divine and the location is just perfection. Ben is responsive and made sure everything was in place. Loved the stay and Seattle 3
7531405,52349775,2015-10-28,14294776,Stephanie,The accommodations at Ben's were great - just as pictured. The room and bathroom were meticulously clean and spacious. Ben was a very responsive and pleasant host. I'd definitely stay here again!
7531405,52875642,2015-11-02,10473749,Jeannette,"Ben and Haley, what a nice couple!
From the beginning, Ben was very communicative and detailed in his responses. The room and apartment are exactly as described, uber clean and homey. The apartment is perfectly located! THE BED!!! Let me tell you, if Seattle wasn't such a cool city we could have stayed in and we would have been content! Overall, we had a wonderful experience and would definitely recommend Ben and Haley's place to anyone and everyone. Thank you for the hospitality:)"
7531405,53518200,2015-11-09,3258771,Kelli,"Our stay with Ben & Haley was awesome! Having your own bathroom & entrance really mattered to us, and everything was clean and well presented! We had a great stay & would recommend to anyone looking for a great location and beautiful room."
7531405,54329708,2015-11-18,11839621,Jeff,"It was nice staying with Ben. I really liked the separate entrance, that was really convenient. The location was also great because it wasn't too far into city be congested. Also, the view from the roof was very nice. The space was really comfortable and felt very cozy.
"
7809455,43002411,2015-08-16,35743045,Richard,Bryan welcomed me on arrival and was a great host. My schedule was crazy so I was really just in to crash and out after a shower in the morning. The bathroom was large and clean with plenty of hot water and great towels. The room had a nice comfortable chair and a desk that I hadn't noticed from the add. The neighborhood was quiet and convenient. I had a car and there was plenty of on street parking.
7809455,44225226,2015-08-24,8294,Jo,"Nice neighborhood, convenient to the bus (we had no car). Very pleasant place for my son and I to stay. Loved the cats--and the family was nice and helpful! When Bryan realized the listing said a queen bed and it was actually a double, he made a separate bed available so my son and I wouldn't be crowded. A coffee maker in the room was thoughtfully provided. He also picked up both my son and I from the train station. I would definitely recommend this place and will stay here again when I return to Seattle."
7809455,44477297,2015-08-26,11293204,Tim,"Bryan had coffee in the room, which was a nice touch; I'm not a coffee drinker but I can appreciate that extra little bit of attention.  Towels and plenty of pillows were laid out and ample power allowed me to plug in laptop, iPad and a couple other things.  

Great room and attention to detail!"
7809455,44981337,2015-08-30,5355322,Alexandra,"Bryan is a very good host, he ' s very reactive and welcoming .
His family too .
we were comfortable in this private room and the bathroom was just next the door .
Rather practice ^^

thanks"
7809455,45877110,2015-09-06,27020021,Louis,Bryan and his family was gracious to host our stay for 4 night at their home located in a very multi-cultural yet extremely quiet neighborhood.  There are ample parking with easy access to major road leading into downtown.  It was great to enjoy soccer match on their big screen projector and you can totally feel the passion they have for the game!  We also had access to a great range and stove to prepare our meal when we didn't feel like venturing out for food.  The room is clean and spacious for petite Asian couple like our self.  
7809455,46089749,2015-09-07,20482538,Tina,"We got there late and Bryan was there to greet us.  Nice historic neighborhood.  Street parking.  The room is clean, the bed is comfy, the bathroom is huge and big living room area.  I would definitely stay here again "
7809455,46360387,2015-09-09,10322339,Hervé,"We only stayed for a night, but Bryan was very helpful. The house is great and you can feel his passion for football. We had a good time at his place "
7809455,46435420,2015-09-10,43140734,Litto,Thanks for being really flexible with our schedule and hosting us. You guys did a great job with having a very clear set of instructions on how to get in and use the room. Thanks again!! Bedroom was very cozy and comfortable. 
7809455,46554446,2015-09-11,6607094,Diana,"Bryan is a great  host.  when we arrived, he gave us a warm welcomed and also he gave us a pretty helpful list with closest place we could go in the neighborhood.  The room  and the bathroom were very clean,  and the bed was really comfy. Besides he allowed us to use one his bikes, it was very helpful.  we felt very luck y to have found nice room.Thank you so much for your help and letting us to stay in your house, we had a really great time. Definitely we recommended this place. "
7809455,47181546,2015-09-16,41767385,Russell,"Great host and a great house! I stayed in the room for five nights with my girlfriend, and the room was well furnished and comfortable. Bryan and his family were nice and welcoming to both of us!"
7809455,48946632,2015-09-29,20730681,Lars,"Had a great stay with Bryan and family. They are very easy-going and helpful and my stay was pleasant and uncomplicated, just the way I like it. Also enjoyed watching the weekend soccer highlights with the family and learning about some teams and players I had not been following or a while."
7809455,50022915,2015-10-08,21274060,Joey And Faviola,As described. We really liked the neighborhood and Bryan and his family were very respectful and friendly. Thanks a lot.
7809455,50821656,2015-10-14,40912341,Cécile,La maison de Bryan est vivante et chaleureuse. La chambre est agréable et propre. Nous avons été très bien accueillis par Bryan et sa famille. 
7809455,51438754,2015-10-20,770778,I-Hua Emily,"Bryan is a really nice guy! He picked us up on our way from the airport and drove us to the place. He was really informative, kind, and helpful throughout our entire trip. "
7809455,52202384,2015-10-26,16841872,Van,"We had a short but pleasant stay with Bryan.  We arrived rather late but Bryan was able to meet us and help us settle in.  The room was cozy and comfortable, easy access to the bathroom and backyard.  We had to catch an early flight and didn't get to spend much time around the house but it seemed very homey."
7809455,52469031,2015-10-29,9224627,Jim,"Bryan was very commutative and made it easy for me to arrive very, very late.  I got caught up in informal business discussions and arrived long past my curfew.  The room was very nice.  I highly recommend staying with Bryan."
7809455,52945839,2015-11-02,9224627,Jim,"This time I arrived early enough to actually meet Bryan!  As before, he was very accommodating and the room nice / comfortable.  Highly recommended. "
7809455,53539854,2015-11-09,9731152,Careena,"Alyson was there to meet me when I arrived at her doorstep and showed me around her home; acquainted me with her kitchen and she had cleared 2 shelves in the fridge for my use. She also brought down to my room a coffee maker with coffee, cream and sugar. Bryan and Alyson were amazing open, friendly, trusting hosts with 2 beautiful children. The location of their home was perfect for my workshop and still close to nature; Lake Washington and Seward Park. I really liked having a backdoor to use coming and going from this home."
7809455,55075562,2015-11-27,10575532,Alisen Robbin,Both my husband and I enjoyed our stay. We felt very welcomed and rested well in the space. I think we slept 10 hours both nights we stayed in Bryan's home. That was so great. Thank you!
7809455,55626454,2015-12-03,9224627,Jim,"Again, as always, a very easy visit.  It seems that I have the entire lower floor to myself.  Very easy access and comfortable room."
7809455,56918782,2015-12-20,35356625,Kelly,"Bryan was a great host, providing us with the information we needed prior to our arrival and making sure we had all that we needed. Our stay was for only two nights and we were sightseeing a lot, so we didn't see the family much. Bryan gave us a ride to the light rail station when we left, which was really nice. The bathroom is shared, but it was always free and the bed is comfortable."
5766989,28762514,2015-03-29,27181362,Kevin,"The place was even better than I expected. It was clean, comfortable and had the amenities I was looking for. I will keep this one on my short list."
5766989,29231868,2015-04-05,23535665,Adam,"The apartment was very clean, in a excellent location. Brian gave great recommendations and always responded promptly. He also has a great record collection! Highly recommend this place for a weekend getaway."
5766989,29705250,2015-04-11,2542104,Christian,"Spacious, very nice place in a great neighborhood. Half a block to good coffee, restaurants, and bars. But far enough off the main drag of the Fremont neighborhood that it's quiet. Wonderful host."
5766989,29806804,2015-04-12,25815677,Tegan,"Brain's place was great. Very neat, and it was so great that he allowed 4 people to stay over. I would definitely stay there again. Although a parking spot is not guaranteed, we lucked out and snagged a great one."
5766989,29946537,2015-04-14,30512441,Paulo,Brians' place was just as described. Such a convenient place in Fremont thats walking distance to lots of shops and also the troll. Definitely would book again !
5766989,30366161,2015-04-20,22022699,Jason,"The host was awesome and super fast responding to everything from parking questions to having an iron.   Super clean every where.  Loved it.  The TV was easy to use the bed was comfortable and the shower was hot. It was as clean as a 3 star hotel.  It was great having the whole place to myself and very easy to find.  Plus I walked everywhere.  Close to everything.  Now being so close to everything has the one drawback of people wanting to be there.  Overnight parking is only on the west side of the street.  So if you are looking for an overnight spot on a Friday night between 8-12pm you might have to drive around a little bit.  Believe me the location is worth looking for a spot sometimes.  But hey it's a city and that's what you have to do.  The value on this place was out of the ballpark.

  "
5766989,30826748,2015-04-27,31114295,Jessi,"We are so glad that we found Brian's apartment in Fremont! :-) The place was clean, smelled clean, and pictured exactly. It was one block away from buses, restaurants, bars, etc. We had an amazing time. We could not have picked that location better."
5766989,31841402,2015-05-10,12109888,David,Everything went as smooth as possible and it was the perfect place to stay near everything we wanted to explore in the Fremont District.
5766989,32350313,2015-05-17,7274282,Heng,"Brian's place is in an absolute amazing location especially if you like to bike as it is close to the Burke Gilman trail.  It is also affordable for such a desirable location.  Brian communicated with us in a timely manner as to when we could check in and tried to get the place set up for us despite a busy schedule.  The place itself is well laid out and comfortable.  The wifi is fast and efficient and access in and out of the place is keyless so it is convenient. However, if you enjoy coffee, we recommend you bring your own coffeemaker unless he bought one for his guests since our visit.  (We ended up buying one at a nearby Fred Meyer) As well, the place isn't very soundproof so if you're a light sleeper, bring ear plugs.  We hope to stay there again during our next visit to Seattle."
5766989,33192345,2015-05-25,32800773,Srishti,"Brian's place was very clean and comfortable. Brian was super helpful in responding to texts promptly even though he was on vacation. We had access to the whole apartment which was great for our family. If 3 or 4 people are staying, they should prepare to arrange blankets and sheets with Brian or by themselves."
5766989,33838822,2015-06-01,33249289,Natalie,"This is a fantastic place to stay! It is so close to great places to eat, drink and have fun! We were here for a hair show and were within walking distance which made the location perfect for us! The place was super clean and comfy. We felt very comfortable. Brian was great and gave us very clear information about his place. We will definitely stay again if we have another show in the area. Oh and the uber ride to the waterfront isn't much at all so you can experience downtown easily!"
5766989,34382976,2015-06-07,32165212,Gregory,"Easy to contact Brian. Prompt response.

Having read in other reviews that parking can be a challenge, I was ready for a bit of searching. Not too bad except on Friday night.

I really like the Fremont area and the apartment was clean and comfortable. "
5766989,35582645,2015-06-20,7962344,Charlie,"Brian's home was the perfect location for our Seattle stay. Excellent restaurants and night life within walking distance left us hoping to return to the Fremont district. Bus lines to take you a short ride into the city are close by, and Uber drivers were available day or night within a few minutes wait. I highly recommend this listing for a stay in Seattle."
5766989,35882896,2015-06-22,2498029,Julie,"The apartment was spacious and clean and the neighborhood was great.  However Brian forgot to contact me the day of my arrival so I didn't know how to get into the apartment or if I was in the right place.    He finally contacted me at about 8 pm after I emailed him 2 or 3 times to confirm the time of my arrival.  I also called Airbnb and his emergency number.  He was very apologetic and everything worked out alright but being by myself in an unfamiliar neighborhood with no confirmation was pretty nerve-wracking. 

The reviews given previously are very positive about his communication so my experience was most likely not the norm.  "
5766989,35991250,2015-06-23,36303780,Stefan,"My wife and I had a great time in Seattle for our anniversary, and Brian went out of his way to make sure we enjoyed ourselves.  He was very quick to respond and made my first Airbnb experience awesome.  He couldn't have made it any easier for us to check in to the apartment and have a great place to stay.  If I ever need a place in the Seattle area again, I will definitely be staying here. "
5766989,36536731,2015-06-29,30074251,Kari,"Brian was very responsive and helpful in explaining how to check-in and check-out of the apartment, as well as answering any questions that we had. The place is quite spacious, comfortable, and very clean! We enjoyed the proximity to downtown Fremont, as it's a great area and easily accessible to other neighborhoods (downtown, cap hill, queen anne, ballard, beacon hill, etc.).  The cable and record player were an added bonus! "
5766989,38028864,2015-07-12,36562720,Greg,"This was my first time using Airbnb, and it was a very smooth experience. Our host Brian was very clear in all communications and made the process very easy. The accommodations were as seen in the pictures and even better.  The kitchen, bathroom and master were just perfect and much better than a hotel room. The home was very clean and just what we were looking for. The location in Freemont is ""The Bomb""....close to everything!"
5766989,39995973,2015-07-27,14604033,Benjamin,"Brian is an incredible host. Extremely great communicator and lightning quick replies. Kept me in the loop with consistent updates via the Airbnb app.  

Brian's place is very clean and was set up with fresh linens and towels. Everything was exactly where you would expect it to be and we had no issues whatsoever. 

The location cannot be beat. You are in the heart of Fremont one of Seattle's most vibrant and fun filled areas. A 1 minute walk down the block takes you to Fremont St with plenty of fantastic restaurants and bars. You're also close to the Fremont Troll and what felt like hundreds of breweries just a 10 minute walk away (Ballard). 

WHEN I return to Seattle I will be checking to see if Brian's place is open because the stay was top notch. 100% recommend. "
5766989,40485420,2015-07-31,37491270,Stephanie,Brian's apartment was very clean. Perfect location to Fremont shops.
5766989,40954894,2015-08-03,11493446,Remko,"The photos don't do this place justice! Amazing location, super clean apartment, great shower and comfy bed. "
5766989,41792855,2015-08-09,37426880,Jayson,"Great apartment in a great location! The apartment is a block away from many of Fremont's shops, restaurants, and coffee shops and very close to the bus stops to get you to wherever you want to go. The apartment itself was clean and well taken care of. We would definitely stay here again!"
5766989,42157914,2015-08-11,37700690,Brandon,Convenient spot with all we needed for an easy stay in freemont. VERY attentive host. Would come back again
5766989,43072822,2015-08-17,37432603,Joslyn,"Brian's apartment was cute and clean. He was also very accommodating to our needs and readily available for recommendations and suggestions. Plus, you can't beat the location!"
5766989,44200629,2015-08-24,40825377,Susan,"Having never been to this area, we were pleased to easily find Brian's place.  It was clean, comfortable, and within walking distance to restaurants, local sights, and shopping.  Easy access to Seattle & a great neighborhood all on it's own!"
5766989,44936806,2015-08-30,29233111,Tory,It was our first time to Fremont and I have to say Brian's apartment was the perfect spot. The apartment was nice and clean that was centrally located to the most amazing food and drinks. We will definitely be coming back. 
5766989,45320284,2015-09-01,40218443,Rongrong,"Everything is good, we stayed as home"
5766989,45711682,2015-09-05,3137758,Kelly,"The apt was exactly as described ... very clean and Brian was very communicative about the check in/out process.  The apt is in a great location and you can walk to everything in downtown Fremont.  We had a car and street parking was available.  Helpful hint:  the walls are thin and the upstairs neighbors are loud but there is a fan in the bedroom which helps drown out noise.  Overall, we had a good experience!"
5766989,45986130,2015-09-07,19002735,Killian,"The area was awesome, close to some great places and not too far away from down town. Apartment was clean and just what we needed"
5766989,46618236,2015-09-12,4070833,Tara,"Brian was great! I didn't have the app downloaded so wasn't receiving his full messages via text (completely my fault) and even still we had zero issues getting in to the apartment. The location is great, and the apartment is clean and has everything you need. "
5766989,47541260,2015-09-20,43545053,Elysia,Brian's apartment was immaculately clean and comfortable. Bathroom and kitchen both updated beautifully. The area was literally right up the road from all of Fremont. This was the perfect location. Brian was was also great at communication- he answered any questions immediately and was in constant communication with us the day of check in to make sure we arrived smoothly. Would stay forever if we could!
5766989,48619612,2015-09-27,38391285,Alexa,Brian's place was great! Everything was clean and it was the perfect size for a weekend stay. I loved the updated kitchen and televisions. The neighborhood was great (a little confusing to drive in) and I didn't have any problems finding a parking space on the block. Overall great experience!
5766989,49016917,2015-09-30,6966560,David,"Great experience! Brian was helpful and always responded to messages within minutes. It's a nice, clean apartment in a location that was great for me."
5766989,49574130,2015-10-04,7595375,Bob,"Brian was super responsive and made the reservation very easy. His place is very clean and located a couple minutes walk from downtown Fremont. We had a great time exploring the city and just kicking back in the apartment watching movies.

Thanks Brian."
5766989,51378311,2015-10-19,45563785,Heidi,"Brian was quick to respond to any and all questions and was unexpectedly flexible on requests.  The apartment was clean and ready to occupy with big fluffy bath towels folded and laid out.  Everything you could need was there and ready to use/easy to figure out.

The apartment is located close enough to the main area of Fremont to walk everywhere.  I didn't need to use my car for the entire four day stay."
5766989,51791605,2015-10-24,3321125,Melissa,"This rental was clean and comfy, with basic amenities. It is worth mentioning that if you are in need of coffee in the morning (like I am), that there is no coffee-making device in the apartment. There are a few coffee places within a few blocks however, including the PCC market, which opens early.  The door uses keycodes, so no key to remember! 
The location is great, although street parking is tough to find without a walk up/down the hill. The block is fairly densely packed with housing, and so you will hear the neighbors, both above and in adjacent properties. 
Brian was very responsive and stayed in contact until I confirmed that I had gotten in without incident. Great host!"
5766989,53523186,2015-11-09,27323000,Lauren,Listing description was very accurate. The apartment was clean and the location was excellent. Brian was very responsive. We enjoyed our stay.
5766989,53780090,2015-11-12,28678885,John,"good spot. walking distance to everything I need for my visits to Fremont. Brian's place is clean. Would like to see some 70's electric jazz represented in the vinyl collection, but otherwise, all good. "
7557951,44949052,2015-08-30,35171731,Johann,"It was our first experience with Airbnb, Elizabeth was very nice all the time, replying quickly to our doubts. Her place its in perfect conditions, veeeery clean and with nice light. You can walk to downtown, we walk to the spacenedle and made about 20 min walk. If you need a place in Seattle for a cruise day stop, or in general for vacations, her place its a perfect place. Thanks for everything Elizabeth!"
7557951,46748939,2015-09-13,40881185,Judit,"We got a detailed description of the place plus recommendations for shopping etc. It was all super convenient. It's walkable to Downtown, or you can use Uber. The place was clean, cute, felt like home. The bedroom hosts 2, the third person slept on one of the sofas. It's probably a bit inconvenient for someone tall/big, but it was just fine for me. We had a very pleasant experience and our host was very responsive."
7557951,49493899,2015-10-04,39264207,Andrew,"We had a great stay at Elizabeth's place! Clean, neat and delightful, her apartment is also close to transit, shops and restaurants. It was a terrific base camp for a long weekend in Seattle, and we couldn't have felt more at home."
2881446,20687077,2014-10-04,6439503,Richard,"We felt very comfortable and welcome in this apartment. It was exactly as we had expected and the blueberry coffee cake we found on arrival was yummy! We appreciated being able to cook some of our meals, and the location made it possible to walk to many area attractions. We'll be back!"
2881446,21280399,2014-10-14,18735876,Darlene,"What a fantastic place to stay!  Although I have stayed in Seattle many, many times over the years, this was my first experience with airbnb, and I must say that it surpassed all of my expectations. The condo was exactly as shown in the photos.  The unit, as well as the building, was immaculate.  The kitchen was well equipped. A handbook with all information we could possibly need was available in the unit. The host was easy to communicate with and even accommodated a bit of an early check in, and was easily available by phone to answer a couple of questions I had. Belltown is my favorite neighborhood in Seattle, (unlimited choices of restaurants and shops) so this location was fantastic, central to everything, and so walkable.  The courtyard garden was beautiful, a great place to enjoy a morning coffee."
2881446,21521184,2014-10-19,19869100,Ryan,"Great spot!  Very clean and comfortable.  Best part about this place is it's location.  2 minute walk (or less) to really anywhere you would want to eat/drink, 6 minute walk to Pike Place and 8 minute walk to The Needle.  "
2881446,23029409,2014-11-20,2872755,Lisa,The reservation was canceled 28 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
2881446,23604335,2014-12-06,4358645,Johan,"We had a wonderful time in Michelle apartments, we were staying as a family with young children and the management company arranged a baby bath for the shower. The location is central within a short walk to the Seattle center and with very good restaurants nearby that also do take-out. Bonus point for the real French boulangerie ""La parisienne"" within 2 blocks. Michelle's place is cosy and very well arranged and our stay was comfortable, even with small childrens."
2881446,27922896,2015-03-15,3769296,Rowena,"My boyfriend and I enjoyed our stay here very much! The studio is just as swanky IRL as it looks in the pictures. We were very satisfied with the space, it felt spacious even though it was only a studio. The setup made it feel quite roomy and I didn't feel like I was disturbing my boyfriend, while he was asleep in bed, as I stayed up later (with the lights on) in the living room area. I absolutely loved the decor! Everything was very clean, and the place was well equipped! 

Michelle was very accommodating! We had to set up different check-in and check-out times, she made the arrangements promptly, and she was very easy to contact. Also, Michelle and Doug were very kind and easy to talk to, which I really appreciated.

The studio is in a great location! It was a nice short walk to Pike Place, the Space Needle, Olympic Sculpture Park, and even the Ferry Terminal. Lots of restaurants and great bars are also nearby. The area (and most of Seattle) felt very safe to walk, even at night. You don't really need a car in this area, but we did have a rental, so the gated parking space worked out for us. Overall, we were very happy with our experience! I would definitely stay here again! "
2881446,30724286,2015-04-26,5892753,Danielle,"Fantastic central location, five minute walk from the Clipper terminal, one block from most of the major bus lines and 5 minutes to Pike Place. 

Tastefully decorated, great for two people. 

Only negative part of our experience was that we had some challenges sleeping as walls are very thin (loud dog in suite above, loud tv next door and suite is situated right next to common area where an event was being held). When we called about the noise when it was particularly bad on one night, the vacation rental company dealt with it professionally and swiftly by sending an on-site representative to shut down the event going on after quiet hours next door. "
2881446,34447694,2015-06-08,17696345,Mason,Our stay was a great one. Seattle is a great city and this place has prime location to enjoy the great things Seattle has to offer. We were able to walk to Pike Place and the surrounding Belltown nightlife. We also rented a car to get to some of the further attractions. Having the rental car was no problem due to the easy parking access on site. The unit itself was stocked with everything we needed and more. Overall a fantastic stay. 
2881446,37113362,2015-07-04,373702,Vivian,"After needing to switch to a different place to stay, the management of this property allowed the last minute reservation. I have to say it was absolutely for the best. 
The condo is in such a great location. No more than a 15 minute walk to get to any attractions. Plus there is a bus stop right in front. 
It is very clean, nicely decorated. Parking is provided w/ the reservation, kitchen has all the essentials, the bed and even the pull out bed in the couch were comfortable (we like firm). The shower pressure has a little to be desired but nothing you can't see past. There is a little overhead noise from the people living above, but again, it wasn't bothersome. Even though the unit is located in a very central spot, outside noise is a non issue. There is an AC unit in the condo and I have to say it was worth every penny as it was in the 90's here in Seattle for most of our stay. I would definitely stay again for our next trip to the city of its available. "
2881446,43240541,2015-08-18,27857236,Greg,"We had the pleasure of staying in Belltown Swanky Studio in August.  It could not have been easier to locate and we were met outside the covered parking area when we arrived and guided in.  I would recommend not using a car while there as we never touched it until leaving after 3 days.  ""Check in "" was smooth and quick.  No surprises.  The location is great.  Right in between Space Needle and Public Market, less than 10 minutes to each.  Took a bus to Pioneer Sq and a Sounders game.The Studio itself is very nicely decorated and the 4 of else felt we had plenty of room.  We did not use the patio but did make it to the pool which the kids enjoyed.  
The location is really the thing here.  Not only is it within walking distance of most everything, there are countless restaurants, bakeries, coffee shops etc, around every corner.  It is hard not to eat every meal at the market but we did have very good food at Belltown Pizza and the French café on 3rd street on way to the Needle.  Hope to return someday.
"
2881446,45791770,2015-09-06,37839303,Julie,"The Belltown Swanky Studio was a great location.  We walked to Pike Place Market, the Space Needle, and the Chihuly Glass Museum.  We rented a car so it was nice to have the secure garage spot as well.  While we didn't get an opportunity to try all of the bars and restaurants that we wanted to in the area, there are many dining options within walking distance.  I found the bed very comfortable and the furnishings were very nice.  It was also relaxing to come back to a place that felt like home versus the hotel experience.  "
8409750,51998291,2015-10-25,25222010,Andrew,Gayle was incredibly helpful in making our Seattle experience a success. The apartment is truly a experience and in a prime location downtown. Having private parking was also a privilege and made things pretty care free if you don't mind taking a walk. I would recommend to anyone ready to experience Seattle. 
8409750,52901041,2015-11-02,27431750,Allison,Gayle was very kind and made sure I knew how to get into the apartment and handle everything. All of our interactions were great and helpful. Check in and out were easy.  The location of the is perfect and convenient. The apartment was clean and wonderful and I would definitely stay again!
8409750,53652774,2015-11-10,12005783,Dan,Gayle's place is beautiful! The building has some great amenities and is right in the middle of downtown Seattle which made getting around very easy. There is also a great little cafe and pizza place downstairs. 
8409750,53997306,2015-11-15,21150466,Rebecca,"Gayle was delightful to work with and made setting up our stay in Seattle easy and stress-free!  The building is in a great location and within walking distance of everywhere we wanted to go--shopping, movies, restaurants.  The Macrina bakery adjoining the condo is perfect for a delicious pastry and coffee breakfast, and there are dance clubs right across the street for those interested;) The condo itself is very clean and very beautiful, the two queen beds very lovely & comfortable--it's not a hotel, it's a home.  We felt very safe with the security of the building and neighborhood area, and the parking garage was a real perk!  I would recommend this to anyone looking to walk around and explore Seattle!"
8409750,55481335,2015-12-01,49088993,Steven,"Gayle was fantastic! Always a call or txt away. Very gracious and made us feel right at home. The condo is a corner unit, with windows on 2 sides. Clean and well appointed. There's a bakery on the 1st floor and a Starbucks next door. Secure building w/ free parking on-site. Overall a great experience.
... and our kids loved it too! "
8409750,57618405,2015-12-27,44957733,Tom,"We loved the apartment. The location was perfect, and the apartment was nicely decorated and very comfortable for 5 adults. There are many wonderful restaurants within walking distance. The dedicated parking space in a garage was a real plus as well. All-in-all a wonderful stay."

46022,96434,2010-09-13,220639,Shauna,Meg is wonderful and her home is very cozy & inviting.  I thoroughly enjoyed my stay.
46022,98703,2010-09-16,111132,Bruce,Meg was awesome -giving me directions over the phone and welcoming us in for our late arrival.  The home is very nice and the host is great.  Hope to stay again sometime!!
46022,402811,2011-07-28,803426,Dave,"Meg's cottage was great!  Within about a mile, there is a golf course, beaches, tennis court, coffee, bars, bread makers, cupcakes, stores, gas stations... it's like staying in a small town, right over the W. Seattle Bridge, minutes to downtown!  There's a great Irish pub, great sushi, great pizza... without the hassles of city parking.  It's the perfect location, and Meg is great, too!  We will definitely stay with Meg again on our next trip to Seattle!"
46022,1073227,2012-04-02,1156167,Carolina,Nice little house. Great Yard!

5805907,29029872,2015-04-02,2465042,Lynn,Great little basement room in a great location. Close to pubs and restaurants and a bus stop. Very comfy bed and a sweet xylophone. The hosts are very welcoming and offered full use of their kitchen and upstairs bathroom.
5805907,29238497,2015-04-05,9510334,Heather,"Aurelia and Tim were very warm and welcoming.  They provided me with everything that I needed for my stay.  I had a beautiful big bedroom with lots of natural light and a super comfortable bed.  

Thank you! "
5805907,29642258,2015-04-10,6686193,Simone,Room was clean and spacious; easy to get to downtown via bus stopping only a few blocks away; very friendly and responsive hosts!
5805907,29881822,2015-04-13,30534454,Haley,"This is an incredible location in a welcoming Seattle neighborhood.  This home is only a few blocks from a lake, public bus route, a bakery and countless enticing eateries.  
Aurelia and Tim were really welcoming and very open to sharing information.  I wish I would have been around more to get to know them.  They even left a note on the door to welcome us and they had little notes explaining where light switches were and other helpful information.  They were also very communicative when there might be noise.  This was a perfect spot for me because I was out all day and it is very quiet at night.  But during the day you can hear noise in the living room.   
Overall I would come back again.  Thanks Aurelia and Tim!"
5805907,30161441,2015-04-18,10061746,Reuben,Super sweet people!  Great location and very spacious.  Private entrance is very convenient.  Their dog Blue is so darn adorable!

5805907,30591279,2015-04-24,31621147,Jon,Great experience! Tim and Aurelia had a great place. The description of the place was prefect! Just what we were looking for 
5805907,30799894,2015-04-27,29900303,Elaine,"The room was beautiful and spacious, just like in the listing. It was really nice to have the private entrance and our own bathroom down the hall. It felt like our own nice space, and we didn't have to worry about disturbing anyone. Aurelia and Tim were very welcoming, recommending lots of nice sights in the nearby neighborhoods. You can tell that they've put a lot of love into the room, adding little touches like cozy chairs, warm lighting, and books. It was a wonderful place to come home to after a long day of sightseeing. "
5805907,31059002,2015-05-01,15240241,Evan,"*Arrival: notes greet you and help you find your way around the house & even a welcome letter with neighborhood recommendations. *The space: Very large and private room below the main house (to call it a basement would make it sound dark, there are large windows and plenty of light). There's a comfy queen bed, a couch, a nice chair to lounge in, and cool art on the walls. A dimmer switch for the lights next to the bed is super helpful as you're bedding down for the night. *The hosts: The nicest! Aurelia & Tim are super cool, gracious hosts who want to make sure you're happy. If you want privacy, the downstairs space is your own sanctuary, but I recommend heading up to the kitchen to say hi. *The conclusion: If you're staying up in the Green Lake area, this is where you should stay."
5805907,31249186,2015-05-03,6051731,Mimi,Aurelia did a great job making us feel welcome. The room is exactly as pictured and the bed was the most comfortable bed I've slept on at an airbnb. There's also a private entrance and bathroom so it's almost like having an entire studio to yourself. The neighborhood is gorgeous and just two blocks from Green Lake.
5805907,31398398,2015-05-04,32101586,Angela,"Aurelia and Tim are some of the most friendly and welcoming people we have ever met. The room and amenities are exactly as described/pictured. The room is probably bigger than I expected. 

We stayed for one night with our 4- and 2-yr-old, and they loved it. The downstairs bathroom does not have a tub, but Aurelia and Tim offered us their upstairs bathroom to use the tub to wash our kids. They also have a ton of kids books that kept our kids very entertained. The xylophone in the room was very popular with our kids. They enjoyed the stay so much that they didn't want to leave.

The area is awesome for kids. It's a block away from the zoo. It's about a 3-block walk away from Green Lake, which is great for walking/jogging around. Lots of great local restaurants in the area too.

We would definitely stay here again. Hope this review helps you feel great about your decision to check out Aurelia and Tim's place!"
5805907,31671944,2015-05-08,8398277,Emily,"Everything was great at Aurelia and Tim's! Accommodations were clean and cute - we had everything we needed. Bed was super comfortable, too! We felt welcome and the whole process was very easy. Thanks!"

The bed is super comfortable and the massaging chair was just awesome! The private bathroom is cute and we had everything that we needed. The private entrance makes it feel like you have your own place. The place is in a really good neighbourhood and there were some lovely restaurants and shops close by. Aurelia and Tim are both really friendly and super helpful people. It was so nice to got to know your little family :) we enjoyed our stay here and would definitely recommend it! 
5805907,32078152,2015-05-13,24500460,Page,"We loved staying with Aurelia and Tim! The room was large, bright, and relaxing. We slept extremely well  in the comfortable bed. Aurelia and Tim are super friendly and generous, sharing their home effortlessly. Their daughter Amara is adorable and very social. We would love to stay with them again next time we're in Seattle."
5805907,32132766,2015-05-14,24677153,Lea,"The home of Aurelia and Tim was beautiful, comfortable and cozy. We felt very welcomed.
Everything was perfectly arranged for us. They even had a list with recommendations including some neighborhood restaurants and bars. We tried out two of them. The food was amazing.
We could come and go any time. It was super uncomplicated and easy-going. The accomodation is also appropriate for families.
Since we had travel plans, we only stayed for one night. We wished we could have stayed longer. The best airbnb place I have been so far!
"
5805907,32282980,2015-05-16,1686978,Keevan,"Tim and Aurelia were fantastic hosts and their space is quiet and so comfortable.

5805907,33600139,2015-05-30,16779710,Christina,"I was at the end of a move and I needed a place to stay for one night. I am so pleased that the place I stayed was Aurelia & Tim's. This room was so peaceful, quiet and lovely. I couldn't have asked for better.

Aurelia & Tim are great hosts. They made sure I was aware - in advance - of activities in their house that may have had an impact on my stay, left instructional notes about the space with information about heat, lighting, and included a guide to local eateries. By the way, the bed is amazingly comfortable. 

If you need a simple, peaceful place to stay then this it."
5805907,41341734,2015-08-07,33399217,Christine,"We loved staying at Tim and Aurelia's place and couldn't have asked for more.  We arrived late-ish and everything was laid out for us and there were clear instructions on how things worked.  After a restful night, we visited with them in the morning.  They were very kind and generous hosts."
5805907,41864023,2015-08-09,24333423,Darcy,My friends and I stayed at Aurelia and Tim's place for a weekend in Seattle. They are lovely hosts and the accommodations were on spot. Good location close enough to the city centre to get around easily. I would highly recommend a stay!

Nicole and Josh were very hospitable and answered any question that I had with ease. Would definitely recommend this place!"
4053972,19647815,2014-09-15,1110700,Spencer,"This was my first time in Seattle and I could not have asked for a better place to stay and better hosts than Josh and Nicole. They are very quick at answering my questions either by email or text prior to my arrival. I had the chance to meet them and spend a bit of time talking to both of them. Really cool people. They are quite knowledgeable about the city and what it has to offer.
The apartment pictures are accurate but they don't do it justice. The place was immaculately clean, bright, quiet and more spacious then anticipated. The # 2 bus is at the corner and it brings you all the way downtown in less than 20 min. You can go to Capital Hill in less approx 10 min. The apartment is approx 5-7 min walking distance from Lake Washington which is just beautiful to see and swim in. The neighborhood is an upscale spot with some of the nicest folks I have met.

I will book this spot again when I'm back to Seattle and would definitely recommend it to others. 

Spencer"
4053972,19859089,2014-09-19,12934633,Ryan,"Josh and Nicole's place was great. Very clean and well appointed with everything you would need for a short or long stay.  Getting in was very easy, as they have a code for the lock.  Their place is very close to some fantastic restaurants and coffee shops within walking distance.  My favorite was the adjustable bed. I slept fantastic very comfortable. I highly recommend this stay in a beautiful part of Seattle."

They greeted me upon arrival and showed me to the apartment which I found to be quite true to the description - charming. The space is beautifully appointed with everything one needs to feel at home. The surrounding neighborhood is outstanding for walking, eating, shopping. 

My stay was work related and I was inspired by the light in the space and the privacy to write with ease. Nicole and Josh have created a most lovely home. "
4053972,20537315,2014-09-30,6224742,Jane,"Nicole and Josh were very welcoming, and we felt free to ask them questions if we needed.

The apartment was very nice, the hosts were accommodating, a great location, convenient to Downtown and Lake Washington, and Nicole checked in to see if we needed anything. Perfect stay. Thank you."
4053972,21388700,2014-10-16,21462192,Kathleen,"This was our first experience with airbnb and found it to be nothing less than positive.  We are sold and doubt we will ever stay in a hotel as we travel.
The apartment, located in a lovely Madrona neighborhood, was immaculate and we appreciated the privacy.   Nicole is a lovely hostess and would recommend this to visitors to the Seattle area."
4053972,21548820,2014-10-19,500385,Erin,"My boyfriend and I stayed at Nicole and Josh's this past weekend and it was really perfect. The neighborhood was great and the apartment was exactly what we were looking for—clean, cozy, and well-stocked with everything we needed.

It's newly renovated with all the modern touches one could want, including heated floors in the bathroom and kitchen!  Everything was super clean and well appointed.  We took refuge next to the fireplace both nights and loved being able to cook in the full kitchen.  Josh and Nicole were easy to communicate with via AirBnB and text.  Josh welcomed us in person and quickly tended to the few things we needed during our stay.  We'd stay again in a heartbeat!  "
4053972,22821564,2014-11-15,21468581,Steven,"A great experience. They were able to accommodate us while out of town on a days notice. The location is excellent, close to leschi (the lake Washington side of Seattle) with easy access to down town. Left us recommendations for areas to look at. Overall I would definitely consider staying here again!"
4053972,23494017,2014-12-02,22211863,Adam,"It was a terrific apartment- immaculate and well equipped and the hosts were great.  A minor snafu on getting the access code was resolved quickly, graciously and effectively.  Highly recommend this location and these hosts."
4053972,23631362,2014-12-07,22688883,Christopher,My hosts made me feel perfectly at home in their beautiful mother in law apartment. They made sure everything g I needed was available and helped me get around the neighborhood. The apartment is pleasantly furnished. It has a full kitchen and there is TV as well as internet. The bathroom was all so pleasant. The neighborhood was beautiful. Old Victorians on the lake. Definitely a place to come back to.

4053972,24193306,2014-12-22,1686971,Chuck,Josh and Nicole were very welcoming.  Josh was even trimming bushes ( in the rain) along the pathway to the apartment as we arrived. The apartment is in a great location and was a quick drive to downtown Seattle. The apartment was very clean and the bed was comfy. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay.
4053972,24331392,2014-12-26,1422769,Bill,"This home was a very good fit for our 4-day December vacation.  Due to our fault of not reading initial instructions, we had trouble starting the gas stove.  Nicole and Josh were available by phone to help us through that.  There were no further problems.  The space was very comfortable for the two of us.  We spent parts of two days walking through the neighborhood and at a Lake Washington park, and part of another day in downtown Seattle.   The home is located well for a variety of activities.  We would have liked to be there in the summer to use the seating area on the patio. 

"
4053972,24575173,2014-12-30,3841814,Nicole,"The space is beautiful and in a perfect location. It looked exactly like it did in the photos.  Easy on street parking.  Bed was very comfortable.  Unfortunately, we were allergic to the fragrant fabric softener and contacted the hosts about this.  They were absolutely wonderful and let us know that they would no longer be using that after our experience.  Thanks Josh and Nicole!"
4053972,24683346,2015-01-01,8718090,Valerie,"We had a great 1-night stay at Josh and Nicole's apartment.

The apartment was cozy, clean and well-stocked and provided a great retreat from the work day. I regularly walked to some scrumptious restaurants (and an ice cream spot that blew my mind!!) and along the lakeside. Nicole and Josh were helpful and highly responsive. It was clear that they take great pride in their home and that translated directly into a wonderful guest experience. "
4053972,27261497,2015-03-01,7646634,Alycia,"Great neighborhood and fantastic little apartment!  My boyfriend and our 2 small dogs and never felt cramped in the space, plus there where great parks to go walking everyday.  The kitchen was a great layout and was perfect for making simple meals."

4053972,29186690,2015-04-05,8739021,Allen,"We loved our stay in Madrona, a very attractive quiet part of Seattle.   The apartment has many features and attention to convenient detail.   Josh and Nicole left fresh butter, a fruit basket and assortment of teas for us!   Mr. Marriott move over! We hope they will have us back."
4053972,29638181,2015-04-10,4328335,Nichole,"My stay at the sweet and cozy Madrona was just that. The apartment had everything I needed. They even had a DVD player so that I could do my workouts if I wasn't in the mood to go for a run along Lake Washington which is super close. The local restuarants that are in walking distance are also FANTASTIC. it was also accessable to the bus lines. I appreciated the basket of fruit, teas, and drinks in the fridge. It was a great stay!!!"
4053972,30414146,2015-04-21,1824920,Sarah,"What a delightful retreat in Madrona! My partner and I had a wonderful and restful time here. Nicole was so helpful when we had a change in plans- horrible weather delayed us in our drive out to Washington- and she handled it with ease. It was really nice not to have to fuss! 
The heated floors and the little stove kept us cozy and I loved the bedding! 
Seattle will be a common destination for me in the coming year and Both my partner and I deeply hope to stay here again! "

The apartment was sweet and cozy, as described, and very clean as well.  Exactly as expected and had everything  needed for an extended visit.  Nicole and Josh were gracious hosts and made us feel super welcome. They checked in a few times to see how things were going and change the towels. When the bathroom sink was clogged, Josh came and fixed it right away.  We enjoyed meeting their boys and adorable new puppy as well.  I'd highly recommend this place for any couple to stay."
4053972,32899019,2015-05-23,20290855,Jerry,"Nicole and Josh were great attentive hosts. The Madrona apartment looks like it is pictured and described in the listing. The neighborhood is quiet and clean with quick and convenient access to public transportation. The apartment is lovely, and it was one of the highlights of visiting Seattle.

4053972,35343763,2015-06-17,5066460,Levi,We loved everything about this apartment from the homey feel to the adorable and beautiful neighborhood. The entry is very private and there is a perfect spot to sit on the front patio and have coffee in the morning. The location is close to all the perks of the city but on the outskirts enough that it was very quiet and calm. Also finding parking was a breeze. Wonderful hosts! HIGHLY recommend.
4053972,35467990,2015-06-19,31465605,Melissa,"This was a great place to stay.  Nicole greeted us warmly and gave us lots of information about the surrounding area prior to our arrival.  The neighborhood is lovely and quiet, and the apartment is a 10 minute walk away from great restaurants.  It was very easy to get to downtown Seattle by bus (about 20 minutes during rush hour) as the bus stop is across the street from the apartment.  After the hustle and bustle of the city, it was great to come home to a quiet apartment at night."
4053972,36540435,2015-06-29,2648648,John And Brando,Josh and Nicole place is one of the best stays we had. They were also very excellent in communicating and gave us good recommendations for neighborhood restaurants and even their favorite yoga studio. Highly recommended. Thanks guys!

We stayed here for one night during a move and Josh and Nicole made everything super easy for us. They were super responsive to our questions and accessing the apartment was super easy. Lots of parking on the street. Stop reading this review and rent the place. "

4053972,37349106,2015-07-06,30992055,Vivien,"I booked the apartment not for myself, but for a visiting event speaker.  She reported to me that the hosts were friendly and helpful, and that the apartment was quiet, comfortable, had a nice color scheme, and met her needs.  She also said she appreciated the welcoming touches like drinks in the fridge and flowers."

4053972,38140431,2015-07-13,8014437,Holly,"This apartment is very much as pictured. Very nice and clean. It was a great place for my teenaged daughter and me to stay while touring local colleges. Josh and Nicole were very good at communicating in advance and Josh met us and showed us the apartment and was able to offer recommendations about local restaurants that turned out to be just quite good. The provided coffee, tea, sparkling waters and ice cream bars that helped to make us feel at home."
4053972,38487582,2015-07-16,29047736,Jillian,This was a very comfortable space and we liked having close proximity to the lakefront. Beautiful neighborhood! 
4053972,38673876,2015-07-17,1436910,Kathy,"We had a lovely stay at Josh and Nicole's apartment. The location and neighborhood are wonderful... Very hilly, but a nice walk to the main drag with restaurants/shops, and very close to the lake as well.

It fit our needs  for a three day stay and even though our hosts went out of town, we were able to get advice and help by text message.  We would be pleased to stay here again and as we have family in the area, we probably will."

4053972,42533516,2015-08-14,22726437,Claudia,"Josh and Nicole were very welcoming and at the same time gave me my space: Nicole showed me in and gave me the basic instructions. A beautiful bouquet of flowers made me feel special and made the already nicely decorated apartment feel like home.  Nicole even had some refreshments waiting for me on that hot afternoon.  Everything was as advertised on the inside and nothing was wanting, down to extra toiletries, if needed.  I loved the neighborhood, too: the lake is a comfortable walk down the hill and the Bus # 2 can take you to downtown Seattle.  I highly recommend this place - thank you, Nicole and Josh, for sharing this special place!"
4053972,42878775,2015-08-16,30235352,Staci,"Great apt in the Seattle area, nice and clean, looked like it was just remodeled by a show on HGTV! Bed was very comfortable.

4053972,45794907,2015-09-06,13793500,Capriccia,"Josh and Nicole's place was the perfect home base for our 3-night visit to Seattle. Excellent, safe location and very private. Plenty of street parking.  Walking distance to cute shops and nice restaurants (although we opted to drive),  and only about 3 miles from Seattle's city center. The place was immaculately clean, comfortable and had every gadget I needed (toaster oven, hair dryer, hot water boiler!). The showerhead was even the right height for us tall people! I would definitely stay here again and highly recommend it to others."
4053972,46127376,2015-09-08,35733215,Stephanie,What a great little place! My husband and I were delighted with the easy process of getting in and settling.

The apartment was exactly as advertised so no unwelcome surprises awaited us. Josh and Nicole were great hosts and our stay was vey cozy. 
4053972,46480739,2015-09-11,8961810,Julie,Thanks so much to Josh and Nicole for opening their apartment!  They are incredibly welcoming - this was the perfect pit stop before heading up to Whidbey Island.  Whether you are familiar with Seattle or new to the city this would be a great place to stay.
4053972,46700149,2015-09-13,18536975,Cristine,"Exactly as described--utterly perfect for my return to my home city for work. The space is bright, comfortable, private and very clean.  The private entrance opens down a path to the sidewalk where you can simply turn to your right to enjoy Lake Washington; only a few blocks to get to the shore (a great place to walk, run, exercise your dog, and stroll to one of the great eateries or coffee shops). The hosts keep a fantastic home, their apartment is a true delight, and I felt my privacy was respected while knowing I could reach out to them at any time if I needed something. Thanks Josh and Nicole!"
4053972,47461308,2015-09-19,34459855,Lawrence,"This was a great apartment! The pictures were exactly how the place felt, cozy. Nicole and Josh were absolutely wonderful. They sent us a guide for our stay with things in the immediate area and some great ideas for downtown.  Ample parking within steps of the house. The walkway up to the house made it  feel like it was our own home. This would be a great place to stay for a week or two. Morning walks along the lake will get your day started off right. Highly recommended."

Madrona is a pretty, residential neighborhood with some great restaurants within walking distance. We thoroughly enjoyed our visit. "
4053972,53225635,2015-11-06,27276696,Ami,"Josh and Nicole are still wonderful hosts! We have stayed in their apartment twice now and we love it. They take so much care to ensure guests have what they need and provide extras to make the stay extra comfortable and sweet. The apartment has everything you'd need for a short or long stay. They went a huge extra mile for us and mailed something to us that we'd left behind. We are very grateful! We'd stay here every trip to Seattle if it was available. Convenient to downtown, great restaurants nearby, safe neighborhood and of course, wonderful and attentive hosts. Thanks guys!"

Not only was the location perfect but the apartment itself was just as it was described in their ad: ""Sweet and cozy Madrona apartment.""  It was very private with lots of natural light coming in and it had all we needed for a relaxed short vacation. Finally met our host just before we were leaving and she was as nice as could be. We will stay there next time we come to Seattle!"

They were there to greet us and show us around, and responded promptly when questions came up. The apartment has everything you need - full bath, well-stocked kitchen, and comfortable couches. The bedroom is snug but also comfortable. There is a small dresser in the closet to store clothing. We visited a few of their restaurant recommendations and are happy we did! Madrona is a great little neighborhood. Lots of safe street parking available. We would certainly stay here again!"

3615614,16747917,2014-08-01,2316605,Anita,"T.J. was my favorite host in the heart of Capitol Hill.  She was so welcoming, interesting and helpful. The apartment is very clean and the bed very comfortable. You will fall in love with her dog.  T.J. anticipates even the little things that a traveler might enjoy, like a book-light for bedtime reading and a heavenly bouquet of lilies in the bedroom.  She went out of her way taking a bus with me downtown to be sure I got to the correct address and calling the cab for me at the end of my stay.  I loved the pampering!"
3615614,16801840,2014-08-02,17073101,Meghan,"T.J. was such a warm and welcoming host, and I could not have been happier to start out my stay in Seattle in such an amazing location. I like to go for runs to explore the neighborhoods I stay in, and she researched routes for me, plus drew me a map of the best places to get food afterward.  She was so helpful in getting me there too, giving me public transportation directions from the airport and staying in touch with text messages when I hopped on the wrong bus. Overall a fantastic experience. I would stay with T.J. again in a heartbeat!"
3615614,17013873,2014-08-05,18399519,Craig,Absolutely the best. I don't think we could have asked for more. T.J. was an incredible host. I will absolutely recommend her to any friends traveling to Seattle. Thanks for an amazing weekend.

3615614,19034059,2014-09-05,2783056,Bradley,"Staying with T.J. was the greatest airbnb experience that I've ever had; probably ever will. She gave great recommendations, directed me to the places I needed to get to, and even assisted me (significantly) when I become ill. If I ever am able to return to Seattle I will try my absolute hardest to stay here again. T.J. was an extremely gracious host. I definitely made a friend during my trip in her. She also has extremely adorable and loving pets."
3615614,19322551,2014-09-10,6209850,Kenneth,"TJ is an amazing host. Prior to arriving I had so many questions about how best to get to her place, and she took time out to check bus/rail schedules to help me with that. While there, she gave plenty of advice on where to go, what to do, and made sure I stayed safe. I really felt like I had someone looking out for me!

The room is as comfortable as it looks, with plush pillows and a super comfy duvet. Lambda and Haskell (especially Lambda!!!) were great too! Location-wise it can't be beat either; you can easily walk to everything Capitol Hill has to offer.

I'm so glad I chose to stay with TJ. I've definitely made a new friend for life :)
"
3615614,19394931,2014-09-11,2564258,Max,T.J. was super inviting and making me feel very welcome. Very cute apartment and bedroom in a great part of town. I will definitely stay again next time I am in Seattle.
3615614,20027280,2014-09-22,11962660,Brad,"We had a lovely stay at TJ's convenient & airy Capitol Hill (website hidden), her friendly Goldendoodle dog Lambda and her initially wary-but ultimately very affectionate cat Haskell made us feel very much at home.  We very quickly felt like longtime friends rather than weary (website hidden) went the extra mile to assist us with advice, maps, and even arranged a parking space for us."
3615614,20149224,2014-09-24,11962660,Brad,"Everything worked out beautifully with TJ & her comfortable & convenient apartment.

Wonderful pets and more importantly wonderful airbnb experience. I would certainly book here again.  
3615614,24847694,2015-01-03,2207903,Xi,"The location of T.J's Apt. is AWESOME in captial hill. Bus stations are just accorss the street and the buses runs whole day that could take you directly to either D.T. or Space needle in 20mins. Seattle is also a walkable city. It took us no more than 30mins to walk back from Pike market. Furthermore, Bars and  restaurants are also very near from her Apt. On the new year's eve, the bar street were crowded with young people waiting to get in and have a drink. 

T.J. is absolutely the most friendly and helpful host one could ever had. During our stay, she not only made us delicious breakfast and noodles, but also gave us so many useful advices which makes our tour much easier.  She is such a kind and easy going person that we talked a lot while we both at home. My frind Jing and I both had a wonderful time talking with her. I enjoy the moment so much that we walking her dog in the park nearby her house. Her pets are so cute and lovely behaved. We love them a lot. 

T.J. drove me to the airport on the day I left Seattle. I appreciate it so much and feel so hard to say goodbye to either the city or my awosome host. I will definitly come back to her place if I were in Seattle in the future!

In all, T.J's place is where you want to stay in Seattle!! 
Highly recommend!!!!!

3615614,25205529,2015-01-09,16443001,Oh,"Her house was really awesome. She asked me a lot of times need anything. Room looks like hotel and she provide almost everything. In my opinion, room looks better than photo. She tried to recommend some place to go. Also,her dog and cat are really cute and friendly. I really miss her house. I definitely recommend her house to stay in!"
3615614,25386374,2015-01-14,23718876,Kelly,"This was my very first trip using AirBnB, and it was so amazing that I can't wait to plan the next one. I have nothing but great things to say about T.J., her place, and my experience in the Emerald City. 

The flat is perfectly located for everything you could possibly want to do in Seattle. It's well-served by public transit, but you can walk nearly everywhere without too much trouble. (The Space Needle and Pike Place Market are both less than two miles away.) Capitol Hill has a very cool vibe; there are lots of great restaurants and shops within easy walking distance, but it's still a fairly quiet neighborhood. No worries about loud parties keeping you up at night here, even when the Seahawks win!

T.J. was an amazingly attentive host. She kept the lines of communication open with me the day before and the day of my arrival, so everything was perfectly set up by the time I got there. She was incredibly knowledgeable about not only Capitol Hill, but the entire city. Any time I needed to know anything, from bus routes to awesome thrift stores to the best place to get non-Starbucks coffee (Espresso Vivace, if you're curious), she had the answer. She was friendly, great to talk to, and very easy to contact if I needed anything. When I started feeling a little under the weather during my stay, she had tea and cough drops on hand right away to help me get through the worst of it. She provided many of the ammenties you could expect from a hotel (towels, robes, soaps, amazingly soft bed), but with all the warmth and comfort of staying at your best friend's house. She has a cat and dog who are both very sweet, though you would never be able to tell that there are pets here if you didn't see them yourself, since the place is spotless and odor-free. 

Based on location alone, it's almost mind-boggling how great of a value this listing is. But with the provided amenities and such a wonderful and experienced host on hand, you'd be hard-pressed to find a better deal."

Not knowing anything about Seattle when I arrived, I was given detailed instructions on how to get from the airport to the door of the apartment (which is close to pretty much everything) where I was met by TJ. She is friendly and a great host. Lambda (the dog) and Haskell (the plus sized cat) were also very friendly.

The bed was extremely comfy and was provided with towels, bottled water, chocolates and even french press coffee in the mornings! The room also had a selection of leaflets and books about Seattle which will keep you busy on your (website hidden)'s knowledge of the area was second to none and a great help when finding an apartment and suggesting places to go.

Along with her friendly cat and dog, T.J. seemed happy to have me in her home and eager to answer any and all questions I had about Seattle life and what to do.

I was very happy with my time at T.J.'s, and would recommend her to anyone interested in a friendly and approachable host with a comfortable home in a hip location!"

I feel warm welcome from T.J., Haskell (the cat), and Lambda (the dog). T.J. knows the city and knows what a great host should be. She's a very caring and amazing person. I'm sure you will have a great time at T.J.'s place like my boyfriend and I had. 

The listing description was really accurate. Her place is so closed to everything. Great restaurants and cafe are just around the corner. If you need anything, just don't hesitate to ask her. She's always there to help! :)

The recommendations for good coffee and where to find some Vegemite were especially appreciated. Her two pets, a cat and a dog, are also great company and particularly affectionate. 

The room is exactly as depicted and described. Clean, comfortable, and enough space. The place is also well located to be used as the perfect base to explore all the great bars, cafes, and restaurants of Capitol Hill (also a great district for live music). It's an easy walk into the downtown area, as well. 

I'd happily stay again!"

I had an amazing time in Seattle!

Capitol Hill itself was really interesting (lots of restaurants, bars, thrift stores and a very nice bookstore within 5 min walking distance). As the add says, the apartment was also close to Downtown and the more touristy areas. It was very easy to get around."

She is beyond a host who just provides you a place to stay, but also a sweet, considerate, thoughtful, warm and close friend. She made dinner and invited me to join with her friend the day I arrived.  She made very good French press coffee for me every morning. She gave me tons of advices of where to explore the city and how. And during my last night stay, she made popcorns and we watched Lilyhammer together. I felt like at home and really enjoyed my time stayed there. Her lovely pets Lambda(dog) and Haskell(cat) are both very smart and sweet companions.

The place located at a perfect spot of the city——Capitol Hill, which is walkable to everywhere. I did not take any transportations everyday I started my trip.  My room was clean, neat and comfortable. The bed is soft and big. You can find anything in hotel such as towel, soap, water in your room and even maps. The neighborhood is clean and quite too. If you want to take a bus, there are stops just cross the street.

I miss Seattle and T.J's place and I think someday I will back there again.

3615614,32574961,2015-05-19,742230,Yaseen,"Believe all the reviews from previous guests - T.J.'s space blends the amenities of a hotel experience and the intimacy of staying at a B&B, all while conveniently located in the center of Capitol Hill. T.J. was kind enough to take in my luggage despite me arriving hours before my check-in time - moreover, she drew me a map and suggested places to go despite helping her previous guests check out and cleaning up for my arrival at the same time. Over the course of the trip, she went out of her way to make me feel welcome - coffee in the morning, apples to take on the go, and soaps/sea salts for baths and showers. 

The location is ideal - I didn't take public transportation except to and from the airport, but there are many bus lines in the area that will take you downtown and elsewhere. (I was able to get to Pike Place Market in under twenty minutes by foot, but I am a brisk walker.)

Be careful - the bed is so comfortable that you might sleep in more than you'd like! "
3615614,32863795,2015-05-22,31164979,Joost,We enjoyed our stay with T.J. a lot. She was very accomodating. The appartment is nice and clean and at a awesome location.

Your accommodations were great, but even more so was your amazing enthusiasm for having us and giving us amazing local advice and knowledge, you are a natural, amazing host, truly talented!  Thanks so much.  BTW, Loved your pet family members (kitty and dog, love!) as well, so special! Highly recommend staying with TJ, she's a passionate air bnb host!"
3615614,33278015,2015-05-26,31848322,Frankie,We are so pleased to have stayed with T.J. She added much to our Seattle experience. The room was very comfortable and we had everything we needed. The apartment is also in a great location. But best of all T.J's an interesting and helpful person. She gave us lots of helpful tips but also left us to do our own thing - she has the perfect balance for a host. 
3615614,33417461,2015-05-27,17373502,Brian,"TJ is a great host! I have many great things to say about this room. First off, the room is located in a prime location in Capitol Hill, easily accessible to downtown and surrounding areas via public transportation. You're also within walking distance of bars, restaurants, and the many diverse neighborhoods that surround it.

The room itself looks exactly like the pictures. It's clean and has all the amenities you need, including towels, soap, drinking water, and a (website hidden) is also an amazing host and provided a light breakfast (bananas) and coffee/tea. We also had a great time talking about Seattle, which she is very knowledgable about, having lived in the area for years.

I'd definitely recommend this room if you're visiting Seattle. "
3615614,33575698,2015-05-30,5397450,Liam,"TJ was a great host making us feel right at home. Not only was the room comfortable and her lovely dog and cat great, but TJ had set out lots of little amenities including a robe and slippers to lounge around in. The flat was well located within Seattle, probably about a 30 minute (hilly) walk from the heart of Pioneer Square and situated in a great district in itself. We had a couple good meals in the area around the apartment, and TJ treated us to great French Press coffee during our breakfast. Overall we had a great, but brief stay with TJ and her lovely dog and cat."
3615614,33830744,2015-06-01,16172765,Annika,"TJ is a great host, she's super nice and extremely helpful. Her apartment is lovely and the bed is probably one of the most comfortable beds I've ever slept in. "
3615614,34007941,2015-06-03,32663002,Ioannis,"T.J. was a great host, very helpful and very friendly, making an extra effort to find and recommend places to visit. The room was excellent, the bed comfortable and the bathrobe and slippers particularly appreciated! 

This is probably the best area of Seattle in terms of cafes, bars etc. Would definitely recommend it!"
3615614,34467736,2015-06-08,8738428,Laura,"T.J. was immediately responsive to my questions before I arrived. T.J. made my stay so comfortable, and welcoming. The space is lovely, clean, and charming. I recommend this sweet space for any traveller."
3615614,34801791,2015-06-12,33704535,Saul,TJ was a wonderful host! The place is as described and she knows a lot about the area. She was more than willing to point me in the right direction as for places to go and things to do. 
3615614,34903879,2015-06-13,19739046,Kurtis,"My short experience staying at T.J's was amazing! Visiting Seattle 
for the very first time was so easy after meeting her.
Her quick replies, hospitality, patience (as I arrived later than stated) and overall helpfulness with places to go see and eat made me wish I could have spent more time there. Her place is centrally located and getting around from there was a breeze.
Clean apartment, ideal location, friendly pets and a great host made 
my stay worth coming back for! Super host for a reason :) 
thanks again T.J for everything! "
3615614,35300162,2015-06-17,16690057,Vanessa,"T.J. was great! She was excited to have us and guide us to the yummy places to eat. The room was great just like pictured! She left fruit, water, chocolate, brochures, tips...and so much more to make our stay as great as possible!"
3615614,35675333,2015-06-21,20757752,Marissa,T.J. was a wonderful hostess. It was my first experience with Airbnb and a perfect introduction. T.J. was warm and friendly. She gave us a ton of recommendations for places to eat around the city. She also was extremely helpful with navigation on public transport throughout the city. She made herself available for anything we needed. She was incredibly kind and upbeat. We also had the pleasure of hanging out with T.J. over drinks for a night in her home which was my favorite part about the visit! Her dog and cat were adorable and I loved having them around.
3615614,35807757,2015-06-22,12832815,Jordan,Great place in the heart of Capitol (website hidden) is so hospitable and the bed is really comfortable. Would stay here again for sure! 
3615614,36061894,2015-06-24,35623810,Prasanth,The accommodation has been very comfortable and relaxing. T.J is a great host and made me feel home. I'll recommend this place to my friends.
3615614,36138320,2015-06-25,16671351,Arthur,"T.J. went above and beyond. She gave me some good tips on where to go in the neighborhood, told me about Seattle in general, and let me play with her dog and cat. I was beat from travelling so I wasn't talkative, but she still took the time to chat with me and make me some coffee just to see how I was doing. Her place is in a cool neighborhood and it's right by a bus that takes you into the center of town. She's a good person and a fine host, you'll have everything you need while you're there. "
3615614,36546174,2015-06-29,3108811,Erik,"Our host was so lovely and welcoming. We really enjoyed her hospitality and our conversations. It really felt like visiting a good friend. We felt relaxed and cared for, but also given plenty of privacy for relaxy-taxi times.
The neighborhood was perfect. It made us fall for Seattle. If I lived in the city, I'd want to live in that neighborhood for sure. Being right next to the park was a huge bonus and it was walking distance to everything we were attending with lots of food options and amenities around! I highly recommend the ice cream shop at 11th and Pike. Lambda and the cat were lovely. We were instant friends.

If we come back to Seattle, we want to stay there again, for sure, if she's not booked up. :)"
3615614,36779923,2015-07-01,30257062,Felicity,Very welcoming and happy to assist in any way. Bed was extremely comfortable
3615614,37573192,2015-07-08,5058805,Joslyn,"T.J.'s a wonderful host! We arrived in mid-morning, and she graciously welcomed us and had the room ready even before check-in time. (Plus she had guests the night before, so she worked quickly and efficiently to get things ready for us.) The room was fantastic, comfortable for the two of us, but there's not a ton of room if you're lugging lots of baggage.  

We loved staying with T.J. because of all the little things she did as a great host. She gave us excellent recommendations for what to see in Seattle (Kerry Point for sunset, Bakery Nouveau) and how to get there. Plus, she left water, fruit, and local chocolate for us in the room, which were above-and-beyond what I expected and delicious. Finally, her lovely furry friends were adorable and lovely, and we enjoyed spending time with them and seeing her cat do tricks.

Overall, we would definitely recommend staying with T.J. because of the excellent Capitol Hill location, her thoughtful recommendations and knowledge of Seattle, and her sweet pets and care for the room and her guests. "
3615614,37697583,2015-07-09,36703856,Caz,I had such a good time at T.J's.  It was just one night but the room was lovely and she spoilt me with fresh fruit and chocolate truffles.  Her dog and cat are absolutely gorgeous.  I was helped me with a recommended walking tour and directions to find half-price Happy Hour seafood. Capitol Hill is such a great area to stay in and T.J. is good fun to be with.  She even got in Yorkshire tea for me as I'm from the UK!  I loved my time there. 
3615614,37869862,2015-07-11,9288911,Dominik,"I completely agree to all other positive reviews at airbnb – T.J. is a wonderful host, offering a nice accommodation just next to the vibrant heart of Capitol Hill. Her tips for exploring Seattle are great and even better are her pets and her bright mind for interesting, intelligent conversations. "
3615614,38417317,2015-07-15,1448046,Cesca,"TJ is so sweet, thoughtful and generous.  We want her to come visit us!  Our room had extra special touches (flowers, chocolates, fresh fruit, to-go H20, welcome card, slippers, robes...).  Her pets are lovable (how many cats play fetch?)  She taught me how to make perfect French press coffee.  "
3615614,38604538,2015-07-17,26804506,Danielle,"This was our first Airbnb experience, and TJ was fantastic! She was quick to respond and very accommodating to our travel delays, welcomed us with fresh fruit and chocolates, relieved our jet lag and morning sluggishness with delicious French press coffee. She was abundant with personalized suggestions and tips to get the most out of the city, engaged us in interesting conversation, and provided a positive attitude. If TJ's personality wasn't enough, her eclectically decorated place is clean, comfortable and located in one of the best neighborhoods in Seattle. But the real icing on the cake was Lambda, her gentle, well-mannered teddy bear of a pup! If all airbnb hosts are half as hospitable as TJ, the holiday inn will be as old hat as Chingy's 2003 hit that shares its name sake. "
3615614,38843164,2015-07-19,17770572,Josh,"Great (website hidden) was a great host, very enthusiastic with great local suggestions! Awesome dog and a plump cat too "

T.J. was extremely accommodating with my requests even though some were pretty last minute and unplanned.
Her apartment is situated in a conducive neighbourhood with little disturbance during my stay. Nights were quiet and peaceful, providing me and my friends a good night of rest in preparation for the following day's activities.
All in all, I've had a pretty pleasant experience staying over at T.J's and would highly recommend her apartment to anyone looking to explore Seattle's good food, music and coffee. :)"

3615614,43028805,2015-08-17,13484982,Lotus,"TJ was a fantastic host for us in Seattle! Her apartment is located right in the middle of everything fun in Capitol Hill, and an easy distance to all we wanted to do during our long weekend. The room was perfect - cozy, quiet, and had everything we needed. The pictures were completely accurate, and the apartment is really beautifully decorated with things from TJ's world (website hidden) was so friendly and accommodating, offering us coffee and tea each morning and always available for advice and chats. Best airbnb host ever, I'd recommend her to anyone visiting Seattle! This stay was better than anything else we could have have found at a regular hotel, hostel, and probably a lot of other airbnb's. And we loved her dog and cat! "
3615614,43761600,2015-08-22,34060343,Nicolas,"Nous avons passé 3 nuits formidables chez T.J. (et son chien et son chat). Nous nous sommes tout de suite très bien senti grâce à la personnalité de T.J., son accueil et son très bel appartement, très cosy. Nous y avons trouvé une belle chambre, très propre, avec un lit très confortable.
Le quartier est très animé (mais calme à l'appartement) et sûr. 
Nous avons passé un très agréable séjour à Seattle grâce aux nombreux conseils de visite de T.J.
Merci beaucoup T.J. pour ton accueil et nous espérons avoir l'occasion de te recroiser un jour.

We spent 3 beautiful nights at T.J.'s (and her dog and cat). So we immediately felt at home thank to the personality of T.J., her welcome and her very nice cosy appartment. We found a very nice bedroom, pretty clean and a very confortable bed. 
the area is lively (but quiet and safe).
We had a very pleasant stay in Seattle, especially thanks to T.J.'s pieces of advise.
Thanks a lot T.J. for your welcome and we hope we will have the chance to see you again."
3615614,44289628,2015-08-25,18518582,Jacqueline,"This was my first visit to Seattle and TJ made the trip better by being a super helpful host throughout my stay. Upon arrival, TJ was very nice about letting me drop off my luggage early even though it wasn't check in time yet and also offered to let me leave my luggage if I had a late flight on the check out date. The room was very clean and comfortable and TJ had the room set up with lots of Seattle informational magazines and maps.  She gave great suggestions for where to go for even marked on maps for me. The location is as described in the listing description, the center of all things fun- restaurants, bars, and walking distance from all the touristy things.  When I woke up in the morning, I was greeted by the smell of French press coffee (she's very nice about sharing her coffee) and her awesome dog and cat.  If you are more of a recluse, the room is situated in a way where you can go in and out undisturbed since the room is right across the entrance; otherwise TJ and her pets are very friendly and they are comfortable to be around  (Her dog gives the cutest hugs).  TJ is a lovely host and I would love to stay with her again on my next visit to Seattle.  "
3615614,44585139,2015-08-27,2205290,Jill,"T.J. is the best host I've ever had. The room is perfect upon arrival, with lots of lovely finishing touches that put it above most hotels. T.J. has maps and tons of great recommendations, spending time to orient you to Seattle and Capitol Hill, and is a bit flexible if you are incompetent at estimating your arrival time, as I was.  But what truly sets T.J. apart, in my opinion, is that she is very friendly and welcoming, and it is never awkward.  The shared apartment dynamic can be difficult to navigate, I was amazing at how I instantly felt like we'd been great roommates for years.  I'm a shy introvert, so this is no easy thing to accomplish!  It also must be mentioned that T.J.'s pets, Lambda and Haskell, are the best pets in the world...I can't lie, I really miss Lambda! :)"
3615614,45362960,2015-09-02,1662583,Anne,"T.J.'s place was perfect! It's the only airbnb place we've stayed where the room is made up like a hotel room. T.J. takes great pride in presenting a clean apartment and making you feel very welcome. It was also in the perfect location, with a lot of cool places to eat, drink and shop nearby. T.J. is very happy to advise of the different areas of Seattle to check out and has really cool maps for all the areas. Also, a shoutout to her canine and feline housemates, Lambda and Haskell, who are both so adorable! We would definitely stay with T.J. again and highly recommend it."
3615614,46479087,2015-09-11,9005982,Davide,"T.J. was just great! Super warm welcome and a lot of attention to details! Better than a 5-star hotel. Yes, details, that's the key. She's so nice and kind and let you feel home, besides providing you with all the hints and tips to get the most out of your stay in Seattle (really, trust her suggestions because you won't be disappointed). And of course, she also takes care of all the appliances for your stay ... and even something more! And last but not least, the place is lovely and the guest bedroom is cosy, clean and tidy, and the bed is comfy and amazing for a great sleep. Not to mention the point that the house is located in Capitol hill, the place to be in Seattle. The district is in fact fully packed with the coolest, most vibrant restaurants, coffee shops and clubs in town!"

T.J. was very responsive and helpful from the start. She allowed me to drop-off my bag early. I found her to be warm, welcoming, friendly and respectful. She provided me with loads of wonderful tips about the neighborhood and public transportation including guides and maps. Her very cool pets, Lambda and Haskell were sweet and friendly to me. I'm allergic to cats, and I had no issue with Haskell at all – not even smells. I love the quiet, cozy and comfortable bedroom – lots of sweet details like flowers, a water pitcher, fruit and a nice robe. The location is great! It's conveniently located near many restaurants, shops and public transportation. I would definitely stay with T.J. again! ❤️"

We even had an emergency passport situation and she walked us through that with ease.  All we can say is THANKS!! TJ for being such a wonderful host!  We will definitely recommend you to our friends."

Location is great. Lots of places around, bus stops on every corner to get you wherever you want to go, but also well located to go by foot if you want to enjoy the feelings of this amazing city.
Bed is big and comfortable and bedroom is very well arranged almost as an hotel for your best BnB experience. 
Dog, Cat and also TJ make you feel at home. I've had a very good experience staying there."

Her apartment is in walking distance of some of Seattle's coolest bars and attractions. The dog (Lambda) is a wonderful cuddle bug, as is the big ginger cat, Haskel.

Plus, she has two adorable and equally friendly pets!  I'm a huge animal person and was thrilled to hang out with Lambda and Haskell.  Sweetest dog and cat (website hidden) told me that she's had guests tell her she spoiled them on AirBNB, and I can already tell that's 100% true."

3615614,52839735,2015-11-02,43803589,Cheryl,"t.j. and her little""family"" , the big dog and small cat ,made me feel very welcome during my visit to seattle. She helped me find a few nice places nearby to eat, came out in the pouring rain to walk home with me one day, and helped me sign up and get a free fare on the uber my last day there. thank you!"
3615614,54005693,2015-11-15,20904631,Elizabeth,"Words cannot express how grateful I am for being able to stay with TJ. She was so welcoming and so incredibly helpful during my stay! TJ wasn't just a host for my Seattle visit, she honestly became a dear friend. She was so genuine, sweet and encouraging about my relocating to the Seattle area. I am forever thankful to have had the opportunity to stay with her (Lambda & Haskell!) in her adorable artist style apartment. It truthfully felt like a home and not just an airbnb. I highly recommend staying with TJ, for whatever reason may bring you to Seattle. She will welcome you and offer help in any way possible. :)"
3615614,54980031,2015-11-27,3636072,Jane,"T.J. was a charming hostess.  She (and her lovely large, but gentle dog) greeted us warmly, no problem that we arrived quite late.  The room is cozy and comfortable, amenities clean and neat, great french press coffee in the AM.  It really did feel like staying with a friend of a friend and we had a fun conversation in the morning - hope to keep in touch!  She provided us with a map of the area and some great suggestions for an interesting walk.  (There is an amazing French bakery several blocks away.)"
3615614,55382497,2015-12-01,43732110,Rebecca,"My sister and I have never really explored the Seattle area before, but TJ was full of fantastic information, including where to go to eat and the best places to watch the sunset. We were immediately welcome into her home, and fell in love with it's charm, along with her fantastic pets! TJ was always excited to hear about our crazy adventures throughout the day, and would give us endless possibilities of other fantastic places to visit. Her apartment is walking distance to so many great places in Capitol Hill, and a close walk the sites downtown. The room is cozy and warm, and the bed is very comfortable. I would stay here again in a heart beat!"
3615614,56264730,2015-12-11,17873205,Taylor,I absolutely recommend staying with TJ. She is amazing and has become a friend that I will have for a long time. She makes anything you need available to you and is a pleasure to spend time with! Plus the apartment is in an amazing location. I would stay here again in a heartbeat. 
9429399,55476759,2015-12-01,48982988,Carrie,"Ellen made sure I had all the information I needed prior to my arrival. The main door has a pad code lock on it. Unfortunately it was not operating properly when I arrived so I had to contact Ellen. Ellen was out of town during my visit but she was able to send her daughter to my rescue within 10 minutes of texting Ellen. 
My family stayed in the Entertainer unit and we loved it. It was spacious and homey, much better than staying in a hotel room. Especially since we have an 8 month old. 
The house sits on one of the Main roads of Ballard and even with the main road that close the neighborhood was still peaceful and quite. We were also in walking distance to a grocery story, bakery, and family that we were visiting. Plus we were on one of the main public transportation routes that went all the way to downtown Seattle. 
The only issue that we had was the front door lock. Hopefully this can easily be fixed. I definitely recommend this location to anyone wanting to stay in and around Seattle. "
9429399,56013115,2015-12-07,32990955,Fern,"An oasis of calm. Thank you so much for welcoming us into your home. 
- Fern"
8425013,48625547,2015-09-27,11161172,Joe,The house was very clean and comfortable right when we walked in. Upon arrival we instantly fell in love with the area with its local coffe and restaurants we felt at home. The old school heaters were a very pleasant experience since we don't have them back in the Bay Area. The ping pong table gave way to a wonderful night. Over all the neighborhood was a cozy one and the upkeep of he house was up to par in our opinion. 
8425013,53062720,2015-11-04,27174208,Rita,"We had a fantastic stay at the Madrona home. It was exactly as pictured and more! The location is very scenic and quiet. 

The house is very clean and neat. All the beds were really comfortable and the amenities available were just right.

There were places to eat fairly close in the neighborhood and we had no complaints! "
8425013,54899048,2015-11-25,47942212,Caitlin,"Joe's Madrona house made our trip to Seattle! It's clean, spacious, has lots of rooms and is close to downtown Seattle. Only disadvantage was that one of the front doors was jammed, so we had to use the back door and the part of the first floor ceiling needed repair. 

Highly recommend this house!"
4681687,24681154,2015-01-01,5037912,Brendan,Great location and place to spend the night. Lilia was a great host and was quick to respond to anything that was needed!
4681687,25259963,2015-01-10,23905229,Roger,All I needed was a place to stay for one night. Instead of trying the hotel I decided to do Airbnb instead. This place was exactly what I needed. Instead of staying in a cold stuffy room I stayed at a place that felt like home. Very happy with it.
4681687,25647560,2015-01-21,23952305,James,"Lilia's studio was fantastic and exactly what I needed for a few nights in Seattle! I didn't actually meet Lilia but she kept in constant communication, ensuring that everything was okay, as well as providing many tips on great eating/drinking establishments. She was also kind enough to leave some local coffee and beer for me. The place was lovely, comfortable and an easy bus ride to downtown - I would definitely stay here again should I ever return to Seattle!"
4681687,25852512,2015-01-27,18845540,Sadi,"Lilia was very friendly and accommodating. Apartment was as described, clean and on a great location. I'd definitely stay here again.
"
4681687,26692235,2015-02-17,26362711,Tonya,"Lilia was a great hostess.  The studio was great and in a nice neighborhood.  She had a basket of breakfast food for us as well as ground coffee.  There is a nice little kitchen area with a coffee maker, microwave and toaster oven.  Just a few blocks away you have some great restuarants, a music club, trader joes and some nice shops.  She provided us with some fabulous restaurant recommendations.  We had a great stay and I would recommend this studio for anyone traveling to Seattle."
4681687,26897414,2015-02-21,6387496,John,"I booked very last minute and Lilia was great about making sure the place was clean and ready for me. This is a cute little studio, I was very comfy here. I had one small issue and Lilia went out of her way to take care of it for me. It's the details that count, like having coffee, tea, and bagels set up, it really made the difference for me coming in from out of town. The neighbor hood is great, and you're back in a quiet ally away from the main road so you have great privacy. You're also really close to all the basics, including the core of the California St. area. "
4681687,27444914,2015-03-04,28193374,Melissa,"Had a really good experience w Lilia.  Nice, quiet unit, close to shops, and convenient to W Seattle bridge.  While we did not actually meet, Lilia was very quick to respond to my emails, and was great when I accidentally locked the key in the unit.  Resolved it w/o interfering w/ my plans.  :) "
4681687,27846096,2015-03-13,786142,Carter,"Lilia's place was welcoming from the beginning.  It took a little to find it, as I had not been in her neighborhood before and the house numbers were on the houses on the hill, but once there, I was greeted warmly and the place was shown to me personally by her sister.  Overall I like the neighborhood, plenty of amenities, even a lovely downtown view just down the hill in the park.  There was a coffee press, all the plates etc. I would have needed, and some items to munch on, which was convenient each morning. Overall a place I would love to use again on a future trip."
4681687,28342071,2015-03-22,21051571,Alissa,"Really close to the beach and the freeway to get pretty much anywhere in Seattle. Right next to California street which has a ton of food and shopping. WiFi signal was so weak I really couldn't get any work done while inside the room but, maybe that's not such a bad thing while your on vacation. Thanks for everything Lilia."
4681687,28591047,2015-03-26,25698148,Chris,"This little studio was exactly like the description and photos -- clean, light, and functional.  We had a car, and the location was convenient for accessing West Seattle, Alki beach and downtown Seattle.  Parking off street in the carport was super nice after dealing with parking in other parts of the city.  We had a lovely meal at a restaurant called Locol not terribly far away (we drove though).
We never had to interact directly with Lilia, but that was because everything was so easy -- in fact we appreciated the privacy that this cozy studio provided in the middle of West Seattle."
4681687,28716773,2015-03-29,24017132,David,"We had a wonderful stay here in West Seattle. The studio was what we expected, very clean and quaint! There was coffee and tea left for us that we enjoyed in the morning. The covered parking was very convenient. It is close to Alki beach and California Ave which has a lot of cute places to shop and eat!"
4681687,29648248,2015-04-10,25959616,Carmen,"Lilia has a wonderful little get away spot.  Emails and information was spot on.  West Seattle is a great place to stay, easy access to downtown, but lots of great places to eat and shop just a few blocks from Lilia's on California Street.  Easy alley access, with a place to park.  Also, patio table and chairs to enjoy a glass of wine outside!  The apartment is clean and well maintained.  I would stay again."
4681687,30346840,2015-04-20,19469844,Denisa,Lilia was a wonderful host. The studio is located in a garage but once inside it's extremely cozy and offers complete privacy. It is also located in a great neighborhood: Close to downtown and close to Alki beach. I would definitely stay here again. 
4681687,30843676,2015-04-27,10545658,Brittany,Lilia was very nice and communicative!
4681687,31375545,2015-05-04,28211167,Alice,This place was great!! Me and my friend enjoyed our stay very much. It is a good distance from downtown. Definitely will be coming back here.
4681687,31825412,2015-05-10,31867666,James,"It is a very nice little place. It met my needs well.

My host was very thoughtful and communicative (online) which made things easy. We had no interaction in person, which was just fine for me. 

I ended up coming and going at odd hours, but the entrance was private and separated from both the main house and the neighbors so I didn't feel like I was being a nuisance to anyone. 

Room for Improvement:
-The wifi was only consistent from outside.
-A mini-fridge would have been exceptionally useful. (A microwave and dishes for two were provided.)
-A bottle of hair gel would have come in handy. (Shampoo, conditioner, body scrub, and hand soap were provided.)

...but these aren't complaints. I had a very pleasant experience :)"
4681687,32390693,2015-05-17,2974468,Paul,The studio was easy to find thanks to Lilia's directions. The room was clean and comfortable. It was great for our over night stay in Seattle. 
4681687,33904312,2015-06-02,2656505,Devon,"This place was perfect for our week long stay, and Lilia was so helpful.  The studio had everything that we needed, and was cozy and comfortable.  Lilia was there if we needed anything, but was not at all overbearing.  I highly recommend staying in this place.  It's in a beautiful neighborhood, and a wonderful city."
4681687,35441871,2015-06-18,33371715,Daniel,"We stayed in Lilia's wonderful quaint and private studio garage for a few nights. A great place for a couple to retire after a days excursion. Great location in West Seattle that is walking distance to great parks and great food, (a bit hilly so bad knees beware). And you definitely have to check out the north shore water front (5-10 min drive) great for bike riding! Cab/uber was about $30 round trip to downtown. Which was fine since we were new to the area and didn't want to worry about all the hassles of taking a car into the city. Everything was really great, Lilia was easy to reach, and we had more privacy than we could have asked for.  Definitely on our list for places to stay next time we're in the area!"
4681687,35625779,2015-06-20,35839308,Cinthia,"A very comfortable space and about a 20 minute drive to Seattle. The room was as described with a private parking space, clean towels, soap, shampoo, and even complimentary tea! Lilia gave us very easy instructions for checkin which was extremely convenient since we got in late at night. Although we didn’t meet Lilia in person, she made sure she was always just a text away. Also the room is separated from the main house which gave us the privacy we were looking for. Highly recommend!"
4681687,36236069,2015-06-26,8614940,Rachael,The space was really clean and easy to access! Lilia made sure I was able to get in and get settled and the space was exactly what I needed!
4681687,36723521,2015-06-30,976360,William,"Lilia's place was great.  It was a private bungalow with everything that I needed.  A short walk away is a very nice 24 hour QFC for any food supplies you might need.  In addition, a little past the QFC was a street with a Sunday market and a bunch of restaurants and a microbrew.  At first, I rented a car when I arrives, but public transit to and from Lilia's was so convenient that I canceled the car.  I would definitely stay again."
4681687,37371619,2015-07-06,9451295,Heajung,"The studio is small but comfortable and a 15 min drive to downtown. Check-in was very easy and convenient. Wi-fi was good. Parking was easy. Thanks to Lilia's studio, I could enjoy my trip.
"
4681687,37694592,2015-07-09,34978426,Clayton,The cozy studio is a great spot. It is located on the main route 21 bus into town and just down from West Seattle running oval. The studio was tidy and everything you needed was available. Lilia was also very attentive and sorted out my wireless password issue. Fantastic. 
4681687,38523339,2015-07-16,17947102,Amanda,Lilia was a wonderful host and her space was absolutely lovely. She was super responsive for any questions we had but gave us privacy and space during our three night stay. She even allowed us to check in a bit early when we arrived to Seattle earlier than we'd anticipated.
4681687,38890876,2015-07-19,36715302,Andrew,"This place suited us perfectly. Close to my sisters and near the track where my competition was being held. Had a great breakfast nearby at Easy Street Records and Cafe on Alaska St. Lots of great restaurants along Alki beach. 
We will stay again for sure next time we are down this way. "
4681687,39325522,2015-07-22,1581651,Karen,Private studio with covered parking.  Nice neighborhood.  No frig which turned out to be an inconvenience.  I think they are trying to get a frig.
4681687,39647923,2015-07-25,203051,Sheng,"Great location and you don't feel like a tourist staying in West Seattle. If you are looking for privacy, this is the perfect place. "
4681687,39960421,2015-07-27,15537927,Blazenka,"Lilia's laneway home was a nice little place just outside of downtown Seattle, and was perfect for our trip. It's a really nice cozy place, has the basic amenities, microwave, fridge, and a french press, and most importantly: Parking! I have a Mazda 3 GT and it was a bit tricky getting into the spot due to the dip in the road, but going in from the right angles it worked just fine. Lilia's studio is located really close to downtown, it's just a short ride to the city centre. Definitely a good location."
4681687,40409882,2015-07-30,33479237,Thorbjørn,Great place!
4681687,40767662,2015-08-02,29939135,Tasha,"Nice, cozy spot in West Seattle! I'd definitely recommend it!"
4681687,41772468,2015-08-09,35909563,Julie,"The studio is super cute and convenient to downtown Seattle and other neighborhoods. The listing was descriptive and accurate.  It's a perfect place if you are visiting Seattle for a short time and need an affordable, fun place to sleep.  "
4681687,43062511,2015-08-17,36573566,Allison,"This was a great place for our stay in Seattle. Easy drive to downtown (I also took the bus in one day and that was close and easy too!) but we liked being able to just stay in West Seattle for our meals (It is so much easier to park and get around!) The place has most anything you might need, mini fridge, microwave, toaster oven, plates and cups, and of course a bed and your own bathroom. Pretty quiet neighborhood and we were never bothered staying there. Lilia said she was available if we needed anything but we never really did so we didn't contact her. "
4681687,45110652,2015-08-31,38682628,Joann,"Cozy studio just as described. Clean and quiet. West Seattle is the gem of the city and Lillia's place affords you great location to The Junction, Alki Beach and of course downtown Seattle. Loved our stay there and would come back again."
4681687,46599868,2015-09-12,39477963,Fikret,Lilia's place was as described. The bus stop just a couple minute walk away was very convenient; we could get to downtown Seattle easily without having to deal with the hassle of driving and parking. Lilia was also a great host and made our stay in Seattle an enjoyable one.
4681687,47124479,2015-09-15,2481187,Justin,"Lilia was a great host. Very easy to communicate with and flexible and understanding when I had to modify my reservation. The apartment was relatively basic, but comfortable, affordable and well-located. It comes with a covered parking spot, which is huge. I certainly recommend Lilia and her West Seattle apartment."
4681687,47975940,2015-09-22,15423259,Michelle,"Lovely stay! The room was clean and had nice little extras, like granola bars, teas, shampoos, lotions. The neighborhood is safe, walkable, and accessible to everything we needed in West Seattle. Bus sop for Downtown Seattle is right out the door. Thank you for hosting us."
4681687,54827460,2015-11-23,48537368,Kim,"I liked the location of your room built into your garage. It was easy to find and get to.  Off street parking in Seattle anywhere is very nice.  The dishes and flatware were great to have and the coffee was very nice.  It was good to come and go and not disturb or be disturbed.  I'm sorry I wasn't at your place the weekend before.  It's actually a great location for a diver or other sports participant since there is ample room for gear to set under that nice little carport.   I bet it's quite nice in the summer as well.  It felt secluded even with homes all around.  

I felt very welcome and appreciated you checking in to see if I needed anything.

"
4681687,55157871,2015-11-28,48988060,Joel,"Place was exactly as described. Adjacent to all West Seattle attractions and bus line to downtown. Great host, and highly recommended listing to all. Simple, easy, swift check in and out."
4681687,56315910,2015-12-12,12486540,Monika,"Lilia is a wonderful host and the apartment is fabulous!! It is spacious, clean, small kitchen and a cozy living area. The location is in a very quite residential area. I loved that I could park the car right by the private apartment entrance with a covered parking spot. Lilia is available for communication anytime. She is very accommodating, kind, and caring. I felt like I was right at home and would love to stay again. I highly recommend!"
4681687,57102649,2015-12-21,49460043,Stefani,The air bnb is located near everything which makes traveling into the downtown very convenient and easy. Beautiful location. I throughly enjoyed my experience. Lilia was a great host! Super helpful and very accommodating. She checked up to make sure if we needed anything; but of course all was provided! Would definitely recommend staying here. 
535300,1589819,2012-06-29,2658930,Katie,"Dee and Adam are great hosts!  They even printed a very important document for us, at an after hours time.  Their place is eclectic, cool and comfy.  It's almost like a small studio, with a mini-fridge and microwave - - coffee, washer and dryer and your own private bathroom.  What's even cooler is the outside garden, that has a ton of flowers and you feel totally engulfed in and want to stay out for hours.  The place is a block away from the beautiful lake!  Seriously a five minute walk.  There are a selection of restaurants and a few watering holes in the immediate area, but downtown Seattle is just a hop, skip and jump away.  They provide you a parking pass, and again are a wealth of information regarding things to do - - even providing a binder with all kinds of neat things to do and see.   We'd definitely recommend them and would stay again; but we've decided to stay here - - thanks again Dee and Adam, wishing you all the best!  "
535300,1617856,2012-07-02,2767198,Eli,Awesome place! They are steps to the lake! Great backyard to relax in. The hosts are super helpful.
535300,1708197,2012-07-14,2895333,Annette,"Cozy room in a great location, one block from Lake Union. Kind and helpful hosts.  Fabulous backyard. Finding parking late at night can be troublesome, but possible.  Very quiet. Had a great night's sleep."
535300,1726004,2012-07-16,2857888,Daniel,"Dee and Adam were great to work with. They helped with finding transportation, where to visit, and even how to work the grill. You just cant beat great hosts in a great city."
535300,1778046,2012-07-23,1530674,Ernesto,"Dee and Adam are great hosts. They picked me up from the Westlake station because I took the train from the airport. They let me borrow their bike and umbrella and even offered me some snacks and fruits! Their pets are adorable and they definitely made me feel welcome throughout my week-long stay. We had our daily talks either in their living room or in the front yard because of the great weather. 

Their place is perfectly located, close to the lake, UW and lots of coffee shops and restaurants. A very beautiful neighborhood, full of flowers and houseboats. 

The room is clean and is separate from the house with a view of the beautiful garden. You get your little kitchenette, your own bathroom and you get to use the washer/dryer. Their apartment is upstairs and the floor creaks a little but it didn't really bother me. Overall, I really enjoyed my stay and will definitely go back. "
535300,1806875,2012-07-26,1284408,Christopher,"Absolutely loved our stay. Dee & Adam were very social & accommodating, I can't imagine a better place to stay while visiting Seattle, it's only a few minutes drive to everything. Best of all was they let us use their grill to cookout and have a dinner in the backyard. We'll definently stay here on our future trips!"
535300,1868760,2012-08-02,2645396,Marla,"We had a very enjoyable experience staying with Dee and Adam.  The hosts were very friendly as was the neighborhood.  The area was convenient to buses, a market and good restaurants.  The little patio and garden area right outside our room was perfect for visiting and the garden was eclectic and lush.  We also enjoyed Hershey, the canine host.
"
535300,1913523,2012-08-07,2475075,Bruce,"Dee and Adam were wonderrfully friendly and helpful hosts.  Our stay was trouble free, the pet accomadations were great, and the back yard is cozy and fun.  The location near the water was ideal for us.  The bedroom is a little small, but comfortable and we would not hesitate to stay with the Nashs again. "
535300,2114226,2012-08-27,3188473,Lena,"Dee & Adam were absolutely wonderful! They were so accomodating and flexible with my schedule. The space is cute, charming and the perfect location. I was able to walk everywhere. They also have the most friendly neighbors! I highly recommend staying here"
535300,2248342,2012-09-10,3065885,Megan,"Adam and Dee were so friendly and hospitable!  They even took care of our dog while we attended a wedding.  The room was great, it was like staying in a hotel only cheaper!  The lake was also so close we were able to take our dog swimming as much as we wanted!  Really great hosts, and their guide to the emerald space was very useful, especially for finding restaurants in our price range!  Really a great stay and I'm so happy to have made some new friends in the Seattle area!  I would most definitely stay here again!!!!"
535300,2302864,2012-09-17,2837129,Emily,"Our stay was short but very sweet!  Dee & Adam our friendly, helpful hosts.  We enjoyed chatting with them, and appreciated their lovely patio & garden.  Eastlake is a great location near public transit & lots of good restaurants. We'd love to return!"
535300,2354969,2012-09-20,30902,Sherry,"Doreen and Adam were exactly as we pictured as was their home. They were always prompt on messaging us and made sure we were comfortable. Having the washer and dryer right in our room was an added plus. We had our breakfast in their really cool garden every morning and our wine there at night. .The location was so much fun. We either walked. took a bus, or drove to any destination we were scouting."
535300,2394454,2012-09-24,2650789,Erica,"I had a fabulous stay in Seattle at Dee & Adam's lovely Eastlake apartment!
This was my first Airbnb reservation and everything was seamless from the actual reservation to finding my accommodation and meeting my hosts.
The apartment was extremely comfortable and the garden was beautiful. It was especially helpful to have a guest parking permit provided for the duration of my visit also. The location in Seattle is  very convenient and the neighborhood of Eastlake seems to be one of Seattle's best kept secrets!
I have to say though, that the best aspect of my stay in Seattle was of course my hosts - Dee & Adam. what a great couple! Very friendly and welcoming and so interesting to talk to about all manner of subjects including our mutual love of travel and photography.
If you are headed to Seattle, don't hesitate to book with Dee & Adam. Your trip will be perfect!"
535300,2469998,2012-10-01,3463863,Susan,"Dee & Adam,

Thanks so much for sharing your home with my daughter and me. The location was great with nearby access to some good breakfast/coffee spots and public transporation to downtown. We enjoyed meeting Hershey and Luna as well!

My daughters car was in the shop during my visit and that bus stop was a lifesaver. The lake is a very short block away in the opposite direction and offers wonderful views of downtown Seattle, two mini-parks with waterfront seating, houseboat views and a neighborhood grocery store.  I was able to purchase a few things and ate breakfast in my room each morning.  It was great having a refrigerator, microwave, coffee maker and hot pot in the room.  The room was cozy, clean with lovely new bedding.  The bathroom is private.  The upstairs floor is a little creaky and the noise at night took a little getting use to but I would not hesitate to stay here again.  I so appreciated all the extra touches from Dee and Adam, they really know how to take care of their guests.  "
535300,2692647,2012-10-22,3903486,Jonathan & Jennifer,"What a great place, and great hosts!  The location was perfect, about the same distance to downtown / U of W / Capitol Hill, and the neighborhood itself was very quiet and sweet.  Jonathan, Keva, and I enjoyed the space even though we were running all over that weekend.  My only lament was that we didn't get more time to chat with Dee and Adam.  Thanks so much!  We will be back!"
535300,2711889,2012-10-24,3600515,Luke,"Really great space downstairs and the info book Dee & Adam provide is stellar. Awesome time in Seattle!

Spaaaaaaaaace Neeeeeeeeedle!"
535300,2769041,2012-10-31,3264368,Norah,"Lovely lay out. Cozy and very welcoming. My mom stayed with Dee & Adam for 5 nights and she slept very well. Easy to get to/from, plenty of parking, beautiful garden, laundry, and ginger biscuits! Couldn't have asked for a better place."
535300,2819531,2012-11-05,4007418,Annie,"Clean, cozy, and well-situated!  The coffee pot was pre-loaded for the morning (awesome), the bathroom stocked with toiletries, bed comfy and warm, transit super close by with direct lines downtown and to UW.  Good restaurants and cafes nearby, and the suite is in a very cool neighbourhood a block from the water.  Definitely would stay here again!"
535300,2828135,2012-11-07,1691967,Lucia,"I had a wonderful time staying at Dee and Adam's in Seattle. They were great hosts, and even left me a box of chocolate mint cookies! The room is really cute and cozy and the garden has a bunch of cool string lights so it looks sort of magical at night. They had a comfy bed for my dog, too. The location is great, very close to a few cafes and the gorgeous lake. I would definitely stay here again. "
535300,2880612,2012-11-13,1368517,Brittany,"We had a great time in Seattle, staying in Dee & Adam's little downstairs apartment.  The bed was comfy & the coffee & little cookies they left were really nice!  Dee & Adam left us to ourselves, but were great about leaving the key & parking pass for us when we arrived, even a bit early.  
The entryway area where the microwave, fridge & coffeepot are is very small, but had everything we needed.  
The location was great, just 2 blocks from a nice little cafe & the bus stop from which we hopped a bus to downtown.  I'd return for our next little getaway to Seattle!"
535300,3103168,2012-12-17,1153097,Molly,Dee and Adam were very welcoming and friendly
535300,3377479,2013-01-20,1925907,JoAnne,"We chose this location first because we were visiting our son and his home was only a block away!  As it turned out, this cozy, slightly quirky spot was perfect for us and had everything we needed and more.  The location is walkable for coffee shops, restaurants, views of the lake and sights of the city.  They have a charming garden and patio which I know we would use if we were there in warmer weather. The room is very small, quiet, clean and comfortable. It was great having a private entrance, too."
535300,4151809,2013-04-14,5697261,Laureen,"This spot in Eastlake is tiny, but if you don't need a lot of room it is quiet and comfortable and very close to absolutely everything including biking and running paths and lots of restaurants.  Our hosts were very helpful and accommodating. "
535300,4530745,2013-05-11,5495660,Emilie,"We enjoyed a lot our stay at Dee and Adam's. The studio is really comfy and the garden very agreable to have breakfast or diner.
Thanks again both of you for your kindness and all the tips (and the ride downtown) ! 
See you another time, maybe in Paris :)
Emilie and Eric"
535300,4688750,2013-05-20,3608932,Mel,"This spot is located in a great neighborhood. We ate dinner at a fantastic  neighborhood restaurant, The Blind Pig. We enjoyed wine in our private garden area, in front of a  burning chiminea under the beautiful Seattle night sky.Dee and Adam were most accomodating!"
535300,5068318,2013-06-10,6662671,Wenke,"I really enjoyed my stay at Dee & Adams. The place is clean, comfortable and quiet. The view of the lake is so beautiful in the summer, and they have a lovely garden of flowers and colored lights at night. Dee and Adam are very friendly and considerate. They prepare the place with every little detail I could ask for, travel books, laundry, wiki, parking permit, and cookies. It made my moving to seattle so easy. Also, the place is walkable distance to downtown, or it is easy to hop on a bus on the street corner. I'd definitely recommend it to my friends."
535300,5124083,2013-06-13,669455,Kamelia,"Thank you Dee and Adam for the lovely time. Thanks for the recommendations, wind boat trip and that you shared your afternoon with me. It was great time for me."
535300,5159788,2013-06-16,3710587,Courtney,Thank you Dee and Adam!  We had a wonderful stay. A very convenient location and we were able to being our dog!  They were both friendly and very accommodating. We would definitely stay here again
535300,5262058,2013-06-21,2488026,Matthew,"What a beautiful location and quiet, just steps away from the lake! Dee was a thorough and considerate host, and we loved staying in her space. The room is conveniently located close to public transportation that goes both to University District and to Downtown Seattle. The room itself is cozy, and we really appreciated all of the small touches--the private bathroom, the mini fridge, the coffee maker, and the back yard. We didn't see much of Dee, but she was very kind and helpful and, overall, made our trip to Seattle a joy!"
535300,5294248,2013-06-23,5280526,Rieke,"Dee and Adam were wonderful hosts - kind and helpful. They provided everything we needed and made us feel really comfortable. We could bring our luggage early and store it there longer than previously arranged which made it so much easier for us. 
The room is small but perfect for two. We were lucky with the weather and also could use the garden in front of the room. We can warmly recommend the place!"
535300,5543558,2013-07-05,6532581,Finbar,Great hosts. Place is exactly as described. The garden is a little quiet oasis in the vibrant and friendly Eastlake neighborhood. Really enjoy the company and space to relax.
535300,5696934,2013-07-12,6813556,Sara,"Dee and Adam's garden is a heavenly space!  We spent lots of time outside because it was so pleasant.  How nice to have use of the laundry facilities as it was almost the end of a long vacation to the NW.  They live within walking distance to many fun restaurants, and they've prepared a large notebook for travelers wanting to get out and enjoy Seattle!  We would enjoy staying in their guest quarters again!"
535300,5785242,2013-07-16,2645396,Marla,We had a fabulous stay at Dee and Adam's. They are delightful hosts. This is our second stay at their place and it couldn't have been better. We especially appreciate having access to their charming garden. We hope to return again soon!
535300,5858974,2013-07-20,4303637,Melanie,It's a cosy and independant room with good equipment. The neighborhood is calm and very nice . The most in this place is garden's access : it's soo coll when we have walked a lot in Seattle to rest or eat breakfast !
535300,6243085,2013-08-05,250448,Shaw,"Great host, even willing to say up at night to let me in since my flight arrived late.  The place was lovely and I'd be happy to stay again!"
535300,6300372,2013-08-07,6474573,Christopher,"This place is exactly as advertised: low price, great location, friendly hosts. Inside, the sleeping area is cozy, with all of the modern accoutrements one could expect. But the magic is definitely found outside, where there is a pristine garden patio, perfect for unwinding after a day of touring Seattle."
535300,6401923,2013-08-11,7534176,Cindy,What a wonderful little get away.  LOVELY garden to enjoy and room was just perfect.  We even saw an EAGLE sitting on post outside one day!  Dee and Adam were gracious hosts and helped us find a  few items we needed.  Definitely would stay here again when we visit Seattle.
535300,6463524,2013-08-13,5497684,Addis,"Adam & Dee's house is perfect for an economic trip to Seattle. The facilities are a bit old, but you will have everything you need, including coffee maker and laundry machine. Walk distance to Lake Union. Even most lake bank is blocked by floating houses and trees, I still found a perfect place to take some wonderful pictures. Of course you can walk a litte bit farther to the lake parks.
Triffic is very convinient, there is buses directly to downtown, King St station, and also very easy to take metro to airport.
Adam is a kind hearted guy. Almost all major information is already prepared.
Compare to the price, highly recommended!"
535300,6594590,2013-08-18,7637098,Jen,"To pee or not to pee- That ended up being the question. While I had a pleasant stay @ Dee & Adam's place-what happened post stay has left a bad taste in my mouth. Post visit, they informed me that my dog had peed on the comforter. They took it to the dry cleaners & demanded I pay the $43 bill. I still think it was spilled iced tea but regardless, I would think all bedding would be washed post stays? I have never heard of a hotel or b&b charging a guest cleaning fees. Obviously, if I had spilled red wine, etc...this would be different but as adults we all know that sometimes bedding can get soiled. Furthermore, the comforter could have been taken to a big load laundromat for $15. Unfortunately, the multiple emails I received from them insisting I reimburse them cancelled out any good of my actual stay and frankly they represent the cliche uptight Northwesterner (Portlandia anyone?). It should be noted as well that the place is quite small (would be very challenging if their were 2 guests) and their upstairs noises were constant. Sadly, this was my first experience at an Air bnb so not sure I would do this again."
535300,6660540,2013-08-20,1482630,Andree-Anne,"We highly recommend a stay at Dee & Adam's place. First of all, Dee & Adam are very welcoming and had lots of little attention to feel comfortable. The room is very clean and we had our own bathroom and entrance. Finally, the place is located in a lovely neighborhood close to the Lake Union and lots of shops. It's a 20 minutes walk to the city centre and it's also super easy to get there by bus. "
535300,7126447,2013-09-07,8502300,Niki,"I had a great stay at Dee's and Adam's. The room is really cute, and I loved the privacy and independence of the set up! I regret not having more time to hang out with Dee and Adam, or enjoy the garden (it was rainy). - thank you :-) "
535300,7156248,2013-09-09,6787913,Ashley,"Dee and Adam were lovely hosts. The location was perfect (so close to Lake Union!) and the apartment was cozy and filled my needs. They provide all the amenities you need, plus a really hand binder full of maps, dining guides, and other tourist info. 

I highly recommend staying with Dee and Adam. "
535300,7637107,2013-09-27,1819314,Jody,"Cozy, affordable, close to scenic Lake Union. Friendly hosts add nice touches like water, tea, etc. Though we didn't have time to sit in it, there's a pretty back garden."
535300,7697226,2013-09-30,2208852,Robin,"We especially loved the neighborhood and its access to restaurants and public transportation and the view of the water was lovely.  The room was comfortable and cozy.  Though we didn't see much of our hosts, they generously left us a nice bottle of wine and some cookies.  "
535300,7932027,2013-10-08,8978569,Ronald,"Dee and Adam were very nice hosts, they have a great unit that's fairly separate with it's own entrance and amenities like coffee, a fridge and a packed binder with everything you ever needed.  Two blocks from a fantastic view of the lake!  They foster dogs that are very playful and cute."
535300,8093920,2013-10-15,8197753,Inmaculada,"Unos días increíbles en Seattle. La casa está algo lejos del centro pero a 5 minutos tienes la parada del autobús además puedes encontrar de todo: supermercados, restaurantes, cafeterías... Nosotros teníamos coche, por eso escogimos algo alejado del centro (allí aparcar es una pesadilla). El día que llegamos no encontramos aparcamiento gratuito Dee nos dejo su plaza :)).  
La habitación es algo pequeña pero cómoda y acorde a nuestras necesidades que eran...pues dormir allí. 
Gracias por todo!"
535300,8233731,2013-10-21,9309402,Jennifer,"Dee, Adam, and Hershey were fantastic hosts for my partner, our dog, Bailey, and I for a weekend in the city! Dee and Adam were kind enough to provide Bailey with a bed, as we were unable to bring her bed in the car.
The space was lovely and separate from the main unit and the back yard was a wonderful, relaxing (and a bit nippy in October!) place to sit and drink our morning coffee. It is in a beautiful part of Eastlake, close to all sorts of restaurants and has easy access to public transit. Additionally, the walk around Eastlake was nice.
I would highly recommend staying with Dee and Adam, especially if you're traveling with your dog!"
535300,8632262,2013-11-09,3241369,Martin,"Deen and Adam are really cool guys, flexible and relax.
Ready to help you anytime. I had a short but nice chating before I left. 
The place clean, nice and has everything you need for staying. Pretty close to Lake Union so you can walk around a beautiful landscape with a cup of coffee. There are restaurants, cafeterias and grocery shops pretty close. 
Just thank you for hosting me! "
535300,9143715,2013-12-09,9541688,Matthew,"A Quaint, lovely place.  Great value for money and wonderful hosts. We had a great time in Seattle, and would gladly stay here again!"
535300,9968846,2014-01-21,6495497,Jennifer,"Great location nearby downtown and the university area! We did not take advantage of the lake trail but saw many others that did. The hosts thought of many conveniences in the room to make our stay comfortable (i.e. Soaps, shampoos, q-tips, coffee,etc). We even enjoyed a movie one night from their vintage VHS collection!"
535300,10163638,2014-02-03,11586528,Andrew,"Dee, Adam n Hershey are friendly hosts and are very welcoming!  The space was clean, cozy, and convenient to the Seattle area.  If you've never been to Seattle before the hosts are happy to give you recommendations and tips during your stay.  Just steps away to Eastlake which is beautiful in the morning.  We definitely enjoyed our stay and our puppy enjoyed the added treats and attention from Dee!  "
535300,10324008,2014-02-13,9969305,Paul,Dee and Adam were very friendly hosts. The room has everything you need and the location a block away from the lake is awesome. Would def stay again.
535300,10437231,2014-02-18,188826,Ed,"Dee and Adam are great hosts ... easy to communicate with, and very accommodating in their guests needs.

The unit is accessed from the outside with it's own entrance, so you are free to come and go as you please.  It is a small, clean unit with all the amenities to make a comfortable stay.

Location to downtown, neightborhood restaurants, parks, etc. is very good."
535300,10726217,2014-03-04,12194666,Ricky And Tim,"I don't think I've had a better stay anywhere, we felt almost like we were in our own home away from home, no go back to the motel feeling, everything was cozy, and nothing unthought of, Dee and Adam are wonderful host, make you feel right at home, I hope we get to go back again soon as well Dee and Adam were always at the other end of a phone when ever you needed directions or a recommendation, just like talking to family, I cant thank them enough for thier hospitality or find words to describe my happiness with our stay."
535300,10995029,2014-03-16,10535080,Sasha,"Dee & Adam's place is very clean and quiet.  The bed was one of the comfiest I've ever slept in, and they have nice amenities such as all sorts of tea and shampoos and make-up removers.  The location is very convenient and close to everywhere.  Parking around their place is a lot easier than anywhere else in the city.  I actually didn't get to meet Dee & Adam as our flight got in after midnight and we leave early and get back late at night, but they were accommodating and were always reachable via email.  I would highly recommend anyone to stay with them."
535300,11068589,2014-03-18,64609,Dee,"We stayed at Dee's place for 2 nights. She was very accommodating & informative, with our last minute booking! Cozy & cute place, in an excellent area of town! Very easy to get to downtown or University Village by car, to do some shopping. I went for a bike ride (despite the rain) around Lake Union, and found that a great way to explore and see some sights! About the room, it was perfect for our needs, including a small tv. Little touches in the bathroom, in case you forgot some toiletries, were very thoughtful! Plenty of visitors guides and maps too! 
 Would definitely consider staying here again when we visit Seattle in the future!
 Off-topic: We ate at a couple of places on University Blvd, and I guess because they're feeding the students, the portions were quite generous!  And we did visit Pete's down the street, WOW, what a wine selection!
 "
535300,11290269,2014-03-28,12709757,Sebastian,Dee & Adam's place is well located and its a really nice bedroom and bathroom. It was literally my own space for a few days.

535300,11594901,2014-04-08,8185805,Regina,"Dee and Adam offer a lovely, clean, cozy and  private little getaway! I totally enjoyed my stay with them. Dee is a gracious host and thinks of the little things that make a difference. She was extremely helpful with any questions I had regarding transportation and local restaurants and sites. Travelers have their very own entrance and garden hideaway at Dee's and Adams.  "
535300,11935643,2014-04-19,2923527,Tracy,It's a cozy house located in a lovely neighbourhood. It's well equipped with high privacy as you have your own entrance. Dee and Adam are nice and helpful. I would definitely recommend it to the others.
535300,12197390,2014-04-25,8571095,Kobie,I had a wonderful stay with Dee & Adam. They responded quickly to my last-minute inquiry and communicated throughout the next day. Dee & Adam are a lovely couple who were very accommodating and made sure I had everything I needed. They also had excellent recommendations for restaurants to try in the Eastlake and South of Lake Union neighborhoods. The room is very cozy and clean with private access through their beautiful backyard. I really enjoyed being able to just throw on my running shoes and be just steps away from stunning lake and skyline views. I would highly recommend staying at this relaxing place and would certainly stay here again when I one day return to Seattle. 
535300,12356061,2014-04-29,13605641,Sebastian,Our stay at Dee and Adams place was simply awesome. It is a nice seperat appartment. The Location is really close to The waterfront. Dee and adam are incredibly nice and friendly! Thank You Guys so Much for everything!
535300,13223431,2014-05-22,10664050,Jessica,Dee and Adam were very accommodating with my stay. They communicated with me before we arrived and the room was in top-top shape despite a guest being in there the day before us. 
535300,13420017,2014-05-27,14176857,Jia Y.,"Dee and Adam had such a cute spot. The private room was clean and tidy, and our hosts were super warm and welcoming. Location was literally just a short few steps to Lake Union, where we got amazing views of the lake. "

They were always available if I had any questions & so helpful with ideas of things to do. The room was just what I expected. It was clean & cozy . I loved the private garden right outside my door. It was great to come ""home"" after a day of fishing on the Sound, get cleaned up & relax in the garden. I would highly recommend this home!!!"
535300,14228387,2014-06-15,14013675,Katie,"Oh my goodness - our stay at Dee and Adam's was truly fabulous. We couldn't have asked for a better home base in Seattle. :)

Unlike other Airbnb stays, this room was made with a guests needs in mind. At each turn there was a pleasant, thoughtful surprise that made out trip easier. The little things, like makeup remover wipes, a neighborhood guide, laundry soap, and outdoor recliners, made me feel like I was at home, or at least at the home of a whimsical, warm aunt. 

Eastlake is quieter - a hilly, safe refuge outside of the city center. It was nice to come back to after a long day of touring. We would definitely stay again - no doubt!"
535300,15148366,2014-07-03,16536550,Karina And Jeff,"We had a great time staying at Dee and Adam's place! The accommodations were wonderful, with the privacy of a hotel but the comforts of home.

All the little things were taken care of too: a helpful binder with info on the neighbourhood, lots of fresh towels, soap, shampoo etc.  The neighbourhood is perfect: super close to downtown, but feels safe and neighbourly. Just a couple blocks from the lake and within walking distance to lots of restaurants etc.  "
535300,16468555,2014-07-28,15941849,Kerri,"We loved our visit with Dee and Adam!  It was our first time using airbnb and they made it very easy for us.  The location was wonderful- minutes away from the bus stop, close to many great restaurants and right next to the lake!  Our space was very clean and cozy.  The experience was much better than any we would have had at any hotel and much cheaper too (plus the added bonus of their fuzzy companions).  We can't wait to go back and stay with them again.  "

The binder that Dee put together for guests with restaurants, attractions, and other things that travelers need, was very thorough, and helped us immensely during our stay. The location was great, literally just steps from beautiful Lake Union. Staying here was the perfect place to begin our honeymoon, and everything exceeded expectation. Thanks Adam and Dee!"
535300,17304077,2014-08-10,1537596,Mark,"My son and I had a great stay at this accommodation. It was perfect for a boys weekend in Seattle. Close to Safeco Field, it allowed us easy access to the ballpark and a comfortable sleep at night. Adam was a great host and made us feel very comfortable upon our arrival. I am very grateful for the time he took to orientate us to the city and to provide ideas about navigating Seattle via public transit.We would certainly consider the space for a future Father-Son road trip."

We found our space incredibly clean (really, really clean) and well cared for.  Additionally, the neighborhood was definitely solidified as one of our favorites in Seattle- walkable to the lake (with parks you can actually swim at!), convenient to everywhere, with an abundance of great dining and drinking options.  As a bonus, they have a bunch of sweet and adorable animals to hang out with!  "
535300,18344766,2014-08-25,6936169,Kyle,"Had a great stay at Dee and Adam's. They had everything we needed, the bed was comfortable, and the private entrance was nice.

535300,19982022,2014-09-21,21286311,Longfei,"Very nice people & place. Good position, near Seattle downtown and the lake. If u have a car, street parking permit is provided, if not, bus station is nearby. Generally very good experience:)"
535300,20147317,2014-09-24,15873795,Lynn,"A warm and cozy space, perfect home away!   Great location in Eastlake and Lake Union with convenient and private entry. Close to restaurants, transportation  and coffee shops. Dee and Adam were delightful and accommodating, with lots of insight into the area as well as responsive to any inquiries I had.  My first experience with Airbnb and certainly won't be the last.  Look forward to returning again next year on my annual trip to Seattle!"
535300,20302112,2014-09-27,3951978,Michael,"GREAT location!
Dee and Adam are great hosts, but the real appeal of this listing is the location.
Just 1 block from the lake shore where we went to watch the seaplanes take off and land, and just 2 blocks (5 minutes walk - if even) from the bus stop that brought us straight to Pike Place for 2.25 dollars each way!
Convenient for stores and a great wine shop down by the lake."
535300,20837992,2014-10-06,79707,Melissa,"Dee & Adam were easy to communicate with, quick to reply to questions, and stayed up late the night of our arrival.
Suite was small/cozy, but with good head height which my 6'1"" partner appreciated.  Floors from upstairs squeak a bit, which for us was not a problem as we are used to living in apartment buildings, but might be advisable to bring earplugs if you are sensitive to noise. 
There is a lovely little garden area adjacent to the suite for evening BBQ's.
Location was fantastic.  We know Seattle well, but had never spent any time exploring Lake Union.  The suite is a 2 minute walk to water in a peaceful residential area just off the I-5.  We brought kayaks with us and were able to launch them without moving the car.  
If you were inclined to go downtown, you could walk there in about 45, or take a bus a few blocks away.
We would definitely stay here again.  "
535300,22354791,2014-11-04,3288734,Samantha,"This was my second stay with Dee and Adam; it is an extremely convenient location for my purposes and, with it's private bath, it is especially well-suited.  A well-thought out accommodation, complete w/necessities for eating in, a comfortable room and hosts who are available while respecting one's privacy, make for a great stay."
535300,22626938,2014-11-10,23256892,Lauren,This was my first time staying at an airbnb and I love it! It was a perfect location and had everything we could have asked for. The hosts were super responsive and very helpful with any questions that we had. Loved the garden and being so close to the water. Perfect spot!
535300,22763762,2014-11-14,3924822,Roger,Host met us and showed us to the door -- it was dark when we arrived and this was very helpful! The neighborhood is lovely and very convenient to the lake and walking.
535300,26504608,2015-02-14,8327283,Jan,"Definitely a cozy little room with lots of warmth and charm. It fit my needs perfectly for a safe and comfortable place to rest to rest each night. Street parking was effortless and the ""noise"" from upstairs where the hosts live was barely noticeable to me and quite soothing. I had total privacy. 

This is the perfect place fall asleep after your long day. The space was larger than I expected, which was a pleasant surprise. And I loved the towels!! Thick and absorbent without being too fluffy soft. 

Check-in and Check-out were quick and seamless. Super nice hosts. Nice, quiet, uneventful experience, exactly what I needed. "
535300,27618660,2015-03-08,26815286,Pryor,Exactly as billed - a comfortable room in a lovely neighborhood. The room was clean and cozy. We'd definitely visit again.
535300,28403108,2015-03-23,12642317,Sean,"We had a nice time staying here. The location is great, easy to get around to many places in Seattle, and simple to get to. Our hosts were very welcoming yet non-intrusive, and it is quite dog-friendly. They even provided a nice dog bed for our dog!"
535300,28574304,2015-03-26,14390063,Nina,"Dee and Adam were very sweet and accommodating hosts. The lakefront location was relaxing and a good place to come home to after busy days out downtown. The room was well furnished and had necessary amenities - we felt immediately welcomed and comfortable.  

As hosts, Dee and Adam were communicative and attentive. They provided us with restaurant recommendations and even had a binder of Seattle information in the room. We had a lovely conversation with Dee about her experience of Seattle and she may have even convinced us to consider living in the PNW in the future! 

Thanks for a great stay!"
535300,28873663,2015-03-31,26790228,Laura,"My boyfriend and I had a wonderful stay in Dee & Adam's cozy city oasis! We had everything we needed and much more. Really enjoyed being so close to the city, but in a charming neighborhood without the traffic and noise. Dee was incredibly helpful and we really enjoyed getting to know her and Adam during the course of our stay. This is a perfect spot for anyone who wants their own space but also enjoys meeting great new friends! Cheers, and thanks again."
535300,29782525,2015-04-12,30387060,Marissa,"Dee & Adam made my boyfriend and my stay really stress free and welcoming from the moment we walked through the door.  Greeting us was a cute sign and a cozy clean room.  We really enjoyed how close we were to the city (about a 2 mile walk or a quick bus ride) and the private entrance into the suite.  The suite came with everything we needed for a two night stay, including a coffee maker, mini fridge, and microwave as well as a desk area and spacious bathroom.  My boyfriend, who is 6'7"" had a little issue with the size of the shower, but for me at 5'3"" it was fine.  We highly recommend staying here if you are looking for a private space that is near the city without being downtown."
535300,30000377,2015-04-15,30782341,Muhammad,Friendly hosts. Cute and clean place. Very beautiful neighborhood only one block to lake.  Room had everything I needed.  Highly recommend.  
535300,30344968,2015-04-20,30882636,Jamie,"Had a great stay with Adam and Dee, the neighbourhood and lake views are lovely, and there are plenty of things nearby (there's a folder full of local attractions provided), whilst also not being too far from downtown. The room is a little unit in and of itself with its own washer, dryer, fridge, microwave, and a private entrance. Highly recommended!"
535300,34515081,2015-06-09,787099,Dennis,"Nice little garden apartment with easy access to Lake Union and Eastlake restaurants.  Quiet, clean and cozy.  Dee was a friendly host.   "
535300,34947438,2015-06-14,5340510,Shaoqun 'Simon',"It was a great little cozy place right next to Eastlake. The setup was quiet, comfortable, and really professional with virtually everything you would need for a short stay. We also had great fun talking with Dee and Adam, and they are very warm and knowledgeable hosts. Thank you!"
535300,35377566,2015-06-18,5540809,Lisa,"Had a cozy three night stay with Dee and Adam. The private room feels more like a small private apartment with a nice adjoining garden area. Well equipped, comfortable and within walking distance to many  eateries and coffee houses. Steps away from Lake Union, but limited access to the waterfront. Very convenient location to UW, Gaslamp district and downtown. Dee is very friendly, quick with responses to text or email, and full of wonderful suggestions for things to do and places to go. We wanted a full waterfront sunset experience and she recommended Alki Beach in West Seattle, which was amazing! Would stay here again! Thanks Dee!"
535300,36098624,2015-06-25,14432374,Jo,"Dee and Adam made sure I arrived safely to Private Eastlake; even drove to pick me up so I did not need to ride a bus late at night.

Everything I needed was ready upon arrival; clean and tidy.  The space was adequate for me.  The bed & pillows were so comfortable plus extra blankets, which I love.  The neighborhood was pleasant and quiet.   I enjoyed eating my breakfast out on the patio table.


I would not hesitate to return to this site.

Dee was friendly and helpful; made me feel right at home."
535300,38023085,2015-07-12,21752431,Tom,"The room is in a good location and close to downtown Seattle where you can find many coffee shops and restaurants. Dee and Adam were very pleasant and made sure our stay was comfortable. However, we found the size of the room to be a bit too small for our needs. We did enjoy having access to laundry and thought the coffee and tea were a nice touch."
535300,39504448,2015-07-24,20948725,Zhenke,"Adam and Dee's place made my Seattle trip unforgettable.  If you'd like to have a sunset run near Lake Union, have delicious food, and have a feeling of being at home, this is THE place you want to stay. Dee and Adam are wonderful and lovely hosts. They gave me complete privacy and still have plenty of chance to chat - the best way to know Seattle. Hersey and James Bond are also great friends."
535300,40794365,2015-08-02,37725052,Chang,"Very beautiful and cozy room! And their garden is amazing! This is my first time using Airbnb so I have to say Dee and Adam really made a perfect first impression. In the room there is pretty much everything you will need, including bowls and plates and disposable fox&knife. Definitely will choose them again if I go to Seattle. "
535300,41396474,2015-08-07,13200813,Vanessa,"What a great little spot in Eastlake!  Cozy and private - perfect for a couple of nights for my husband and I. We were out and about so much and never needed anything when we were at the house, so we never actually met Dee or Adam. They were at work when we arrived, but we planned that ahead so getting into our space was a non-issue.
As mentioned in their description, we could definitely hear some creaky floors and house noises above us, but nothing that some earplugs couldn't take care of. Quiet neighborhood made it feel like we weren't even in a major city, but we were pretty close to everything we needed.  Had the convenience of having our car with us, so can't comment on public transit. Easy little walk down to watch the sunset on the lake or slightly uphill to restaurants, etc. They also had a cute patio area where we just hung out, read and enjoyed the nice weather.
We truly enjoyed our stay and would definitely go back the next time we are in Seattle. Thanks again Dee & Adam!"
535300,41741643,2015-08-09,32286751,Rebecca,"We really enjoyed our stay in Seattle at Dee and Adam's place. They have used the space so well to create a warm, cosy and 'home to home' environment in their lovely home, which was also in a convenient location. The help and advice provided by both Dee and Adam (especially UBER!!) was second to none and made our short visit to Seattle so much easier for us - thank you both! We will definitely stay here again if we're lucky enough to visit Seattle agin. Thanks so much :)"
535300,42210639,2015-08-11,23400513,Donel,"This is a cute place with alot of character and a quiet, pretty, and relatively central neighborhood with a number of local northwest-type characters around.  

It, is however, very homey--if you want something a bit less cluttered and more hotel-like it might not be for you."
535300,42737279,2015-08-15,39116693,Hilary,"Dee was so kind and hospitable to us on our stay. She was available, but gave us our privacy. The room was very clean and ready to go for us. She even had a Keurig with coffee and tea for us. Side note--most places in Seattle do not have air conditioning at all. This room did not, but the evenings got really cool (in the 50s), so it was not a big deal. "
535300,43609946,2015-08-21,26998633,Stefano,"We spent six beautiful days at Dee & Adam's place. The room was exactly as described: warm, cozy, comfy bed, very clean and fully equipped with everything we needed (washing machine, coffe maker, tv ... ). The back garden was a pleasant surprise, very quiet and romantic, we spent there some wonderful time reading and having breakfasts. The neighborhood was quiet and really close to Lake Union and all kind of restaurants are just few walking minutes away. We rented a car at Seattle Airport so the Parking Permit Dee & Adam gave us was a big plus for us.
Dee & Adam were wonderful hosts! They gave us a lot of informations and suggestions and always answered all of our questions and needs but at the same time they gave us all the privacy we needed.  Dee, Adam, lovely Hershey, JB and Luna are such a wonderful family, we really loved our time with them! We had a wonderful time and we will for sure stay here again next time we'll be visiting Seattle! It was our first experience with airbnb and it was great!"
535300,46769956,2015-09-13,41961353,Rebecca,"What a wonderful first experience! Such a cozy and beautiful place. Met the host and their wonderful dog, Hershey, and they were absolutely delightful. Everything was within 10 minutes! Thanks again!"
535300,47537222,2015-09-20,43209260,Tim,"My stay with Dee & Adam was great! Couldn't imagine a better place for my very first Airbnb stay. Everytime when they were back home from work we had a great time: with all the cool neighbors, with the pets or just in the living room and lovely garden. 

Tipp for everybody: Do a seaplane tour. That was awesome!

Thank you again for the great time and don't forget to take a look into your guest book. See you again soon! :)"
535300,48209896,2015-09-24,43199482,Amélie,"The room was even better than its description on the website and everything had been perfectly arranged by Dee and Adam. All the necessary information was laid out in a booklet and everything was super clean. I did not expect that the room would be this private so I would greatly recommend this place to people who are looking for privacy and calm. At the same time, Dee and Adam are both very welcoming and nice people and will happily give any advice on their neighbourhood and Seattle. Plus the location is easy, close to bus stops and cycle hire stations. An amazing experience overall and for a very good price! Bonus: the washing machines available and the TV with old movies! "
535300,48420442,2015-09-26,19910683,Patrick,"Great location. Easily accessible by highway and side streets. A short walk to a great market, view of the city and Lake Union. The hosts were welcoming and accommodating with a special request. Parking was easy to find. Access to a beautiful shaded garden and eating patio was an unexpected amenity. We wish we had time to use the chimenea. "
535300,50647151,2015-10-13,43126094,Christina,"This was the PERFECT place to stay! Very close to the city, yet not in the middle of the hustle/bustle. There was plenty to see/do within walking distance or a short 5 min drive. The biggest thing that separated Dee & Adam from the rest was their hospitality. From the late night check-in to our last night in town, we never felt like we were in a ""stranger's"" home. They were eager to help us with anything we needed in order to enjoy Seattle, yet they were very respectful of our privacy and were never over-bearing. Oh, and their fur babies were awesome :) If/when we go back to Seattle, we will likely work our schedule around Dee and Adam's availability. "
535300,51461305,2015-10-20,44138681,Jen,"This place was beautiful!!  Literally steps to the lake and fabulous local eateries.  Dee was so sweet, she waited up for me even though my flight was terribly late. She even took the time to explain where I should sight see the next day and it was past midnight. The room is small but cozy, has a washer/dryer and a walk up shower with great pressure. I have to say I almost didn't want to leave!  If I am ever in the area again I will definitely book again if they will have me.  "
535300,52122704,2015-10-26,11185781,Leanna,"Dee was very warm and welcoming, and eager to give us restaurant recommendations. The room was cozy and cutely furnished, and the private garden was a great place to relax. Fantastic location, to boot! Thanks!!"
535300,54156259,2015-11-16,46799738,Sirun,"Dee and Adam are warm and welcoming, and gave us advice for shops and traffic. The house is located perfect, close to the lake and easy to get pubic transportation. The room is so sweet and everything is perfectly prepared. Thanks a lot!A great live in Seattle ~"
3876097,18041525,2014-08-20,12999361,Jen,Tessa is just wonderful and a great person to meet and stay with. The apartment is just off of Discovery Park for any nature lovers looking for a great walk and there are buses right outside that take you downtown in about 15 minutes. It's the best of both worlds. 
3876097,18606969,2014-08-28,4705753,Maurice,"With a welcoming and gentle presence,  Tessa was a generous and truly caring host. She was flexible when I had an unexpected delay in my arrival time.  Tessa is genuinely interested in people and we had some great conversations. The part of town where she lives is next to a beautiful park and has great bus access.  No problem with street parking and tea was offered several times.  Highly recommended! !"
3876097,18640622,2014-08-29,20574138,Alex,"Tessa is a wonderful host, really welcoming and friendly and made my first AirBnB experience really enjoyable. We spent a good few hours over my 2 day stay talking about travelling, our experiences and life over many cups of tea. When I asked (very last minute) to stay on for a third day, she accommodated me with no problems at all - she is very flexible and easy going. There is a supermarket 5 minutes away from her house and there is a bus stop that takes you straight to town just outside her doorstep, as well as a beautiful park a 2 minute walk away. The neighborhood is safe and easy to access."

She was a wonderful host who made sure I felt at home as soon as I walked in the door, offering me a cup of tea and sitting down for a chat. Her home is very clean and comfortable and the neighborhood is gorgeous. One of my favourite AirBnB experiences to date."
3876097,35984935,2015-06-23,30798716,Betsy,"Tessa was a wonderful host. Her home was comfortable and cozy- while I was there, she slept in the living room as well but had put up screens so that each of us had a little privacy in our spaces. Her home smelled like Eucalyptus. She was flexible about my arrival time and even let me stay an extra night with her. I didn't get to spend much time chatting with her but it was a wonderful and affordable place to rest for a couple of nights- and the bus to downtown is pretty easy to navigate from her home as well!"
3876097,36325393,2015-06-27,21461394,Hillary,"Tessa was such a wonderful host. She welcomed me right as I arrived and recommended some great places to visit around the area. Her apartment was very easy to get to and on-street parking was always available. The entrance to Discovery Park was just across the street! Great, quiet location. 

Tessa was exceptionally kind and we shared many great conversations. I had an excellent stay. I highly recommend staying at her place if you are in Seattle. "
3876097,37684294,2015-07-09,21423478,Anthony,Tessa was such a gracious host and made my stay in Seattle very pleasant and enjoyable! She's such a sweetheart and I had a wonderful time visiting.

3876097,40816275,2015-08-02,17981294,Angela,Tessa was a fantastic host during my short stay. She has a very warm and kind personality and made me feel at ease in the space immediately. Her place is located in a safe area and also very close to the Zoo which I had plans to visit. I would definitely recommend a stay with Tessa she is a delight! 
3876097,41017766,2015-08-03,25133925,Weijun (Eric),"Tessa was so fantastic and welcoming during my short day for only 1 night. Her place is so quiet and peaceful. She offered me fresh fruits and warm black tea,both were my favorite.  The couch was so cozy and I really enjoyed a good night~ I definitely recommend a wonderful stay with her~ Thanks~"
3876097,48052548,2015-09-22,40576358,Hyebin,"My stay in Tessa's House was awesome :)
She is very welcoming and friendly. She also offered me some tea and fruits. She took care of me as a daughter during I stay :) Thank you very much Tessa!
The couch is very comfortable and bathroom is clean as well. I totally recommend her couch! I want to go her house if I go to Seattle again :)"
3876097,48849300,2015-09-28,33289062,Rebecca,Tessa was an awesome host! She greeted me at the door with hot tea and we sat and chatted for a while. The house was clean and  organized. The couch was very comfortable and I felt welcomed the entire time.

4105164,21260101,2014-10-13,22176454,Dylan,Harry and Rich were very welcoming hosts. They are friendly and make good conversation. The room was neat and the accommodation was better than I expected. I will definitely stay here again.
4105164,22350849,2014-11-03,23028723,Simon,"Harry and Rich has a beautiful home which is unusually well suited for hosting AirBnB guests. As a guest you have your own floor and bathroom (possibly shared with another guest) so the privacy is really good.

We both really appreciate Harry's and Rich's taste in interior design and furniture. Compared to most other American homes, their house feels more European/German in style and interior.

I was pleasantly surprised to find out that Rich shares my passion for coffee, so if you also a coffee enthusiast you can expect both great discussions and great coffee here. Because we only stayed two nights and had a fully booked schedule we unfortunately didn't have a lot of opportunities to talk to Harry.

We believe that Harry and Rich goes well beyond their duties as hosts and we would no doubt recommend them to our friends."
4105164,22866046,2014-11-16,23493729,Lonnie,"I very much enjoyed my stay.  The room and bathroom were well decorated, clean and comfortable spaces.  I especially liked that the room is on the lower level and gives a good deal of privacy and allows one to come and go as needed from a separate door without disturbing the hosts.  Harry and Rich were very welcoming offering just the right level of friendly conversation.  An overall very nice stay for the money.  I'll be back."
4105164,27976574,2015-03-15,13245489,Kate,"Harry was a lovely host--informative, reliable and courteous. Unfortunately, we only had a brief visit in passing and it would have been nice to spend a bit more time, for sure. The accommodation was great. Clean and spacious, it was very comfortable for two of us. I highly recommend it! "

The description of being close to downtown Seattle was also correct- and Harry and Rich gave us simple directions for how to take the C line directly downtown (takes about 15 minutes and is direct)."
4105164,34079560,2015-06-04,29650632,Guldem,"Harry is a perfect host -- attentive and thoughtful as well as friendly. The room, in fact the house in general, is super clean and well supplied. Lovely neighborhood, easy commute to downtown (only 30 minutes by bus in rush hours). I'd strongly recommend this place for anyone to stay in Seattle. "
4105164,34182521,2015-06-05,6167479,Herman,"Harry and Rich were great! Rich welcomed my girlfriend and I on arrival and made us feel very comfortable and at home. The house is very modern, clean and well maintained. The room that we rented was very clean and the bed is extremely comfortable - exactly what we were looking for after a long drive from San Francisco. Overall, a great experience and would definitely stay with Harry and Rich again. "
4105164,34199129,2015-06-06,29956383,Jim,Easy entry and beautiful home! The place was immaculate and nicely decorated. Easy on-street parking in quiet neighborhood. Very comfortable bed with good lighting.  I will be returning on my next trip to West Seattle!
4105164,34735689,2015-06-11,34547468,Jocelyn,"This is my first Airbnb experience and it was awesome. Harry and Rich are perfect host. They are very friendly, helpful, and awesome. They offered a lot of help to me and I really appreciate it. The house and the room are super clean and comfortable. The neighborhood was great! Super convenient spot, everything is just around the corner. "
4105164,37738591,2015-07-10,20914118,Kirk,"Wow!!! Where to begin:)) Meghan and I had a wonderful stay at Harry's and Rich's space. It was extremely clean and organized. It also gave the warmth of a ""home away from home"" feeling. We couldn't have asked for a better AirBnB experience. We came with a guest to host arrangement and we left with aspirations of a life long friendship with Harry and Rich. Everything was taken care of and they were both very helpful with suggestions on restaurants and also activities and sights to see in Seattle. We HIGHLY recommend this space if you want a relaxing and comfortable stay in Seattle."
4105164,38017204,2015-07-12,36116061,Laureen,"Harry and Rich were so accommodating and kind! It was our first Airbnb experience and they made sure that we felt welcomed and understood how Airbnb worked. I feel like they went the extra mile to make sure we were comfortable. 

Check in/out was simpler than we expected. Their place was also super cute and clean. If we ever ended up back in Seattle, we would definitely try to stay with them again! Thank you for the pleasant experience!"
4105164,38509777,2015-07-16,34778230,Dawn,"Harry and Rich are warm and wonderful hosts.  The room and amenities are exactly as described.  Quiet neighborhood. Convenient location - coffee shop around the corner, as is the bus stop, and a grocery.  A single bus ride on the RapidRide C Line to and from downtown.  Great value.  I would definitely stay with them again.  It was a very good experience. "
4105164,38585705,2015-07-17,16625604,Zach,"Harry made us feel incredibly at home even though we didn't talk too much( our fault-- not his).  We arrived and took a nap, left and got some dinner, came back and slept and left early in the morning for Portland.  Harry seemed to want to chat when we arrived but we had been out in the sun all day and were exhausted.  The room was super comfortable and in a lovely home.  We also were able to meet a fellow Air BnBer from Germany who was super friendly. "
4105164,38804410,2015-07-18,23944082,Rannie,One word..CLEAN! It was our first air Bnb experience. I love the place! We got in late after a soccer game. We just let ourselves in and out. Harry was there to greet us upon departure. Their kitchen was modestly designed.
4105164,38939659,2015-07-19,2845647,Chelsea,"Harry was extremely inviting, helpful and easy to talk to. The room was very well kept, private and quite. Great location for experiencing more of the city during my trip. Perfect for a weekend getaway! "
4105164,39379245,2015-07-23,32157626,Samantha,My boyfriend and I had a great time staying with Harry and Rich. They were very accommodating. They gave us some good suggestions as to things to do in Seattle and they even helped us set up their BBQ. Their home is lovely and extremely clean and the room was very comfortable. The neighbourhood was great and it was easy to get to downtown Seattle. 
4105164,40191122,2015-07-28,25225436,John,"Harry and Rich were a great host. The place was amazing and in a great area . Aliki beach is a must see . The area is a great neighborhood with some good food places , and not far by car from most attractions.    Harry made things extremely convenient, I literally felt like a roommate for years.  They are extremely friendly and if I wasn't so tired I would of chatted a little longer they are cool dudes. Thanks again guys !!! I highly recommend . "
4105164,40300558,2015-07-29,14152834,Jim,"Very nice location and accommodations with friendly & proficient hosts.
Quality & cleanliness of interior is akin to that of a 5 star hotel."
4105164,40437793,2015-07-31,31689904,Eden,"Harry and Rich were exceptional hosts! It was our first time using Air BnB and we couldn't have asked for a better experience. They were warm and welcoming, gave us great recommendations but also gave us room to enjoy the city and their home on our own. I can't recommend them more highly!

"
4105164,40701881,2015-08-01,22161,Philip,"Harry and Richard were such awesome hosts!  They were so inviting, gave us tips on things to do in Seattle, and even called in a dinner reservation for us on the night we arrived!  The bathroom and bedroom were very clean and comfortable.  Loved the fact that we were close to Alki beach and that we were walking distance from the bars, shops, and restaurants on California Street.  Downtown Seattle was only a 20 minute bus ride.  Would definitely stay here again.        "
4105164,41000493,2015-08-03,304384,Alessandra,"Harry and Rich were great hosts.  They were warm and welcoming, but made sure to give us our privacy for the whole of our trip.  The room was just as described.  Very clean and aesthetically pleasing.  Parking was easy.  Great, safe location. "

4105164,42637097,2015-08-14,7878456,Bonnie,"Harry and Rich were excellent hosts. They were super friendly and their place was clean and well decorated. 
First of all, upon booking the room, they provided us with a nice, informative welcome letter filled with the answers to any questions you may have about coming to stay with someone (where to park, access to the house, etc.). I found this very helpful and it seemed like they really covered all of the bases. 
We only stayed with them for one night, but wish it had been longer. We were in one of two rooms in their townhouse that they rent on airbnb and the bathroom is shared between them. This is about as close to a hotel as I think you can get in an airbnb situation. The room and bathroom were both spotless and basic toiletries were provided. We would definitely stay with them again in the future. "
4105164,42727704,2015-08-15,36925627,Adela,"Hosts were inviting, warm yet causal. The place is almost brand new. The interior is beautiful, clean and very comfortable. It was perfect for our quick weekend stay. We will definitely stay here the next time."
4105164,43135017,2015-08-17,22093208,David,Great! Clean and private. Harry is a gem!
4105164,44167894,2015-08-24,7967906,Juri,"I think the apartment was better than the pictures.. It was a wonderful surprise , because the house is beautiful modern and so comfortable.. plus  you have a bus stop for going Downtown near the house ,Fantastic..!
Harry is a fantastic host , he s smart and very nice .. And what about Rich , he s really wonderful person you can talk with him for hours... 
For sure if i would go back to Seattle i should come here..
Thanks a lot because i had a great experience..
Life is one and this is what you need , meet better people and see nice places..."
4105164,44829516,2015-08-29,41389224,Ryan,"Absolutely beautiful home. Like other reviews have said, the pictures don't do the space justice. Was able to go for a run in the morning with my fiance around the neighborhood (very safe and quiet) and the view of the Sound was breathtaking. Only took us about 5-10minutes to drive to downtown. Harry and Rich were were wonderful hosts, very accommodating and friendly. Really kind and wanted to help give my fiance and I the best possible time in Seattle with entertainment and food recommendations. "
4105164,44924109,2015-08-30,31480872,Jessie,"Thank you Harry for staying up late for us to check in! The 4 of us arrived at 11pm after a full day of PAX soaking wet from the storm. Harry welcomed us in and helped us settle into our rooms. He took the time to get to know us and made sure we had everything we need. The room was well furnished, clean and very roomy. Harry was very promt with his responds and send us a very detailed message the day before our stay for everything we needed to know. I would definitely stay again or recommend other friends to stay here. Thanks Harry! =) "
4105164,45187510,2015-08-31,41880632,Kyle,Super friendly and awesome place.
4105164,45996619,2015-09-07,40994398,Jacques,"Harry is a great host. He stayed up late to welcome us at his place.
He made us feel like we were home.
Room and apartment (decorated with good tastes) as described in a very pleasant and safe neighborhood.
Walking distance from the bus that will bring you directly to downtown and its famous Pike Market.
As a true native, Harry knows Seattle by heart and is ready to give you information and a visit plan for your stay well ahead of time and before you get there, by communicating as soon as you pick his place.
A great first airbnb experience.
Thank you Harry.
"
4105164,47137194,2015-09-15,587956,Steven,"The experience was excellent start to finish. Harry and Rich were most welcoming, check in smooth and accomodations first class...even heated floors. The location is good for West Seattle, great area, walkable and public transportation. Easy parking and good cycling jump off spot. "
4105164,48248550,2015-09-24,12200358,Christoph,"Harry is a great host - communication prior and during our stay was excellent,  his tips led us to discover great places in West Seattle (a great neighborhood!) His home is stunning, and the room and accommodations are wonderful,  not just clean and comfortable but almost luxurious. I would love to return next time I'm in Seattle."
4105164,48956681,2015-09-29,44754997,祝鹏,Very nice host. The bedroom is comfortable.
4105164,49299433,2015-10-02,42410444,Ayla,"Harry was very fast in getting back to me, super communicative and nice.  We were happy we got to meet both Harry and Rich.  They were very friendly and welcoming.  The place was clean, comfortable and pretty.  It was a great place to stay!  They are very thoughtful and considerate hosts, they left little water bottles and chocolates on our bedside tables— super adorable."
4105164,50127535,2015-10-09,45429998,Dor,"This was a great place to stay in during my visit to Seattle, and for all the relevant reasons: Harry and Rich welcomed me warmly, the house and room were incredibly comfortable and pleasant to stay in, and the neighborhood is quiet and very nice. The house is well designed and has a great homely feel. 

I spent a lot of my time working with a partner in the house, which was very accommodating for this purpose. If and when I come to work in Seattle again, I'd return to this place without bothering to look elsewhere.

Thanks a lot, Rich and Harry!"
4105164,53315404,2015-11-07,23706156,Shuraih,A five star experience! Harry was warm and welcoming and responded very quickly. The place was clean and very comfortable. I'd totally recommend this place!
4105164,53793308,2015-11-12,43284560,Lopaka,"Harry responded very quickly to all of my inquires.  He was very hospitable and welcoming. The listing was very clean, modern and updated.  Located in a great area just a bus ride to downtown.  My first trip to Seattle was magical and I owe part of that experience to Harry and Rich."
4105164,53945215,2015-11-14,44893307,John,"My trip down to Seattle was very last minute, and Harry was able to respond back quickly. He accommodated any questions or concerns that I had. Harry is very friendly and easy to converse with. 
I am very impress with Harry & Rich's place; very clean, cozy, and warm welcoming. If I am ever back in town, I definitely know who to book with, hands down! Thank you, Harry & Rich!"
4105164,55046455,2015-11-27,18779890,Jian,It was a great place to stay in Seattle.  Harry is a great host.
4105164,55475072,2015-12-01,48835796,Funny,"THANK YOU!Harry！
他是个非常好的房东，初到西雅图气温只有1°左右，当见到Harry满脸笑容的出现在机场接我们的时候，所有的寒冷都被他的笑容温暖了，然后带我们回家并了解家里的一切，房间超极温馨，明亮，卫生间也是超极6星级的【特别要说明他家的床，柔软干净】。
Harry他非常乐于分享，免费提供茶和咖啡，我们用他的厨房做重庆火锅，大家一起聊的非常开心。他还带我们去买交通卡，告诉我们西雅图交通。
房子所处地段安全，安静，步行3分钟就到bus站，乘坐C线，20分钟不到就可以直达派克市场，西雅图市中心。要是大家来西雅图，一定要去Harry家体验。真正的西雅图之家。"
5882923,29707703,2015-04-11,20380367,Sara,"In a last minute search, I feel extremely lucky to have found Terry!s brand new apartment available.  It is a beautiful apartment with easy access to fun shops and good restaurants as well as downtown Seattle.  The zoo and Green Lake also are close.  Available parking is always a plus for me.

Terry was an outstanding host - he was friendly, accommodating and even left a chocolate Easter bunny to greet me at check-in!

I am almost reluctant to give this glowing review - I am certain that next time I need a last minute place, Terry's apartment won't be available!"
5882923,31957181,2015-05-12,30777685,Umran,"We loved the house and the neighborhood. The house was very clean and organized, thanks to Terry..If we go to Seattle again, definietly will stay at that house again..:)"
5882923,33324915,2015-05-26,16023650,Greg,"Terry and Roger's apartment is clean, quiet, and spacious. Very well appointed and a great location to see the sights and sounds of Seattle from! Will definitely look into staying again if I come back to the area."
5882923,33677410,2015-05-31,31075482,Marsha,"Wonderful, charmingly decorated large basement apt in quiet neighborhood. Loved all of the extra amenities......goodies in kitchen, comfy bed and much, much more. I was in Seattle to visit my mother & the apt provided a relaxing home away from home. Fun neighborhood location within walking distance to local market, restaurants & coffee. Terry was the perfect host & I look forward to staying there again on my next trip in the fall."
5882923,34069768,2015-06-04,3355585,Courtney,Great location! Clean and spacious. Host provided us with a light breakfast and coffee which was much appreciated :) 
5882923,34214028,2015-06-06,18674250,Peter,"This is a wonderful place, newly renovated in a great neighborhood. Plenty of space and very comfortable, great kitchen too.
Terry did a wonderful job with having yogurt and cream cheese and bagels available..."
5882923,34634975,2015-06-10,580950,Jesse,"Had a great time in this lovely space. All needs were accounted for and had no reason to ask our host for help because it had already been offered. Beautifully decorated with care in a great walkable neighborhood, I'm looking forward to staying again."
5882923,35080319,2015-06-15,30660702,Chris,We had a wonderful time in Seattle.  The stay was one of the best parts!  We had more amenities than expected!   Lots of room and privacy.   It was easy to get to all of the places we wanted to go and parking was also easy.  Thank you Terry for making our stay so comfortable.   I would definitely book again!
5882923,35391407,2015-06-18,33148189,Rozana,"My boyfriend and I were in Seattle for a couple of days, and we really enjoyed our stay at Terry and Rogers. The apartment was clean, tidy and had all the amenities you needed. The kitchen and appliances are brand new. Terry was very quick to respond, and we received detailed instructions on how to find and get into the apartment. The apartment served our purpose really well and we would definitely stay here again. "
5882923,35919765,2015-06-23,30905487,Erik,"Fantastic!  Both the space and the hosts!  I rented this for my father and his wife who never experienced and AirB&B stay before, and they had nothing but great things to say about Terry & Roger and the apartment.  My dad said the bed was the most comfortable bed he's slept on in a while.  Terry & Roger were very accommodating - providing a breakfast for their first morning along with a bag of coffee.  And they printed out directions and attractions to see on our day trip to Bellingham.  The only concern is that the stairs leading down to the apartment aren't great for an unsteady person.  But they are addressing that, and it definitely wasn't a big issue.  They are genuinely good souls who care about people (and who happen to have great taste!).  I would highly recommend staying here."
5882923,36330182,2015-06-27,12452611,Miranda,"Terry's place is the best!  It is very comfortable and homey, well decorated and filled with everything you would need for an extended stay.  The kitchen is spacious and well stocked, the bathroom is roomy and everything appears recently renovated.  The neighborhood is great, you can walk to many shops and restaurants and a market is next door.  Street parking can be a little tough, I often had to park 2 blocks away (but not very far) and you should be warned that if you have a lot of luggage, it is a bit tricky getting it into the apartment, as you have to go up steps from the street and then down steps into the basement level where the unit is located."
5882923,36524047,2015-06-29,31386520,Catherine,"We had travelled Canada and the USA for three and a half weeks and Seattle was our final destination. Terry was most accomodating and extremely helpful, his local knowledge was invaluable and accomodation provided 10/10. In all our travels this establishment and its owner we couldn't recommend more highly. The location was good approximately 20 min bus ride to the city centre, local shops, cafe and restaurants within 2 min walking distance. Neighbourhood lovely, quiet and safe. Great value for money."
5882923,37738607,2015-07-10,5742193,Stephanie,"Terry made us feel very welcome, He followed up with email and answered the phone when we called for information on getting into the rental...The place looked just as photographed and the neighborhood is great, upscale with a gourmet grocery story, trendy shops and restaurants."
5882923,38175617,2015-07-13,23437180,Jordyn,"Terry's apartment offered a wonderful space in a quiet neighborhood which provided the exact stay that I was hoping for, truly a home away from home. Our trip was made that much more relaxing knowing that we had such a comfortable place to return to. "
5882923,38614640,2015-07-17,35253208,Zarabeth,Terry was a great host and the apartment was so cozy and beautiful. It was in a great location where we were able to relax and get around using public transportation. This was a wonderful experience that I would highly recommend to anyone. 
5882923,38997535,2015-07-20,28597372,Michelle,Hands down the best Airbnb in all of Seattle for sure but possibly in the world! What a pleasure to have all the comforts of home away from home. It was more like a luxury apartment in the heart of the city and the hosts only made it even better. My wife and felt extremely welcomed and every one of our needs were met. This is our go to spot in Seattle from now on! 
5882923,39384589,2015-07-23,23110932,Katy,"Terry's place was perfect for our honeymoon in Seattle! Such a great spot with shops, restaurants, & Ken's Market right around the corner, plus only a 10-15 ride to downtown attractions. The space was roomy for the two of us, and had everything we needed to be comfy. We would stay here again in a heartbeat if we return to Seattle! "
5882923,39914565,2015-07-27,22654310,Heather,"Terry's place was absolutely wonderful.  The location is perfect, close enough to downtown Seattle to experience the city and far enough to be in a quiet neighborhood.  The apartment was perfect for what we needed during our stay.  Comfortable and inviting.  If you are looking for a great place to stay in a quirky fun neighborhood with a lot of great restaurants nearby then Terry's place is the perfect spot.  If we make another trip to Seattle we will definitely try to stay here again."
5882923,40330178,2015-07-30,18943569,Chris,"This apartment was very nice - well set up, clean, comfortable.  Terry greeted us when we arrived and made us feel welcome.  Even in the warm summer days, the apartment stays cool, since it's a basement unit.  The neighborhood is nice, only minutes away from Safeway if you want to cook, and right across the street, there is a local grocery store that's a bit more expensive, but very convenient.

The only real difficulty is finding parking, especially on such narrow streets, but that's nearly everywhere in Seattle.  Make sure you're proficient in parallel parking!

Besides the parking (no fault of the host!), it was a great place to stay - one of the best I've experienced.  It's an easy drive to downtown Seattle as well.  I would definitely stay here again."
5882923,41198178,2015-08-05,31862097,Kelsey,"My boyfriend and I decided to go to Seattle because we had never been and knew nothing of the city. We booked with Terry after reading his reviews and seeing the beautiful apartment pictures on his page. Terry was a wonderful host. He was incredibly welcoming and friendly, getting to know us and giving us some recommendations for neighborhood and city restaurants and attractions. Furthermore, the apartment was lovely. It was cool (we visited during the summer) and private and totally accessible for all our needs (we cooked almost every morning). I would HIGHLY recommend booking with Terry, not only because it is a great space and city but because he is a genuinely great host! "
5882923,41370487,2015-08-07,35633382,Steven,"We enjoyed our stay here very much. The unit is quite spacious with lots of decorative elements. Terry was responsive in email/text from our reservation thru our stay. We had a slight issue with the TV after arriving and Terry was there immediately and took care of the problem (which likely I had caused). We were mainly there to do tourist things downtown, but we did have a nice meal at the German pub around the corner. The drive downtown was very simple without having to get on the interstate. Parking is tight in the neighborhood but we were able to find something close by or even right in front. We would be willing to return."
5882923,42401198,2015-08-13,1198978,Andre,"If you're planning to stay in Seattle look no further than this absolutely fantastic apartment! Terry has made sure that everything you can think of has been incorporated - comfortable bed, clean spaces and great artwork. Not only that but having maps/brochures of things to do around the city really helped us out. The apartment is spacious and cozy. Perfection. "
5882923,42830076,2015-08-16,31834457,Suzie,"Our host, Terry, was very helpful and pleasant, he was in contact checking if there was anything we wanted to know or needed whilst we were staying.
We loved the location, good restaurants and great food market, Kens, over the road, had every thing you needed. Close to Green Lake for walking.
Parking was a little difficult at times if the street was busy but a good bus to the city.
We would certainly return."
5882923,43373417,2015-08-19,402059,Kelly,"Terry has created the perfect home-away-from-home at his guest apartment in Seattle. The space is well-designed, clean and comfortable. It is only surpassed by the kindness and genteel hospitality of the host, Terry, who provides everything you could possibly need while away from home. He is an excellent host, communicates clearly and promptly. Thank you for an excellent airbnb experience!"
5882923,43707298,2015-08-21,41401201,Matthew,"Terry's apartment was beautiful and well located. We had everything we needed for our brief visit to the Seattle area, and the neighborhood was nice and quiet at night. Terry made us feel right at home without being invasive in any way. "
5882923,44210114,2015-08-24,17332720,Yunkin,"Cassandra Croft:
This was a fantastic find on airbnb. I highly recommend this place; if it's ever available I would not hesitate. The area is so nice to explore. It's so close to the Greenwood strip or the main strip in Ballard as well. I found some of the best Thai food I've ever had just a few blocks away. 

This airbnb made me feel like it truly was an island getaway and it's my new go-to spot. Terry is a delightful host, and made me feel completely welcome. From the eclectic decor (intricate hand-beaded art) to the thoughtful amenities (impeccably clean, breakfast snacks, super-comfy bed), the place was entirely lovely. Since I'm a wedding photographer I needed a few things, and this airbnb had everything from an iron, ironing board, washer, dryer, etc... The walk in is very cute with its little garden and seating area (just watch out for a few friendly spiders!). I would live here if I could without a doubt.

5882923,45249051,2015-09-01,34675567,Nav,"Terry has a wonderful guest apartment  with a perfect home away from home atmosphere in North Seattle. The space quiet, clean, creative and edgy. It allows you to relax and wind down after your travels. 
Terry is also an excellant host, he is easy to communicate with and is clear and consice with his information and instructions. I would definately stay here again! 
Thank you for an excellent airbnb experience!"

5882923,46705484,2015-09-13,35429282,William,This was the best place we've stayed on our vacation. So clean and nice and so much larger than it appeared in the photos. We'd reccomend Terry's place to anyone!
5882923,47639347,2015-09-21,14534279,Jennifer,"Terry was a fantastic host - the apartment was beautifully appointed, with everything to make you feel at home.  He'd left us items for breakfast as a ""welcome home"" and it was very much appreciated.  The apartment was stocked with everything you might need, including laundry detergent, a dishwasher (and detergent), even an iron and ironing board and a hair dryer (which was much better than any I've found in hotels). Terry was a consummate host and we would happily stay there again if we find a need for a short term place in Seattle."
5882923,47970907,2015-09-22,38478396,Kin,We enjoyed staying at this place as it was close to green lake park and a short drive to downtown.  Host was very nice to leave some breakfast for us in the fridge.  Place is very quiet/clean with ample street parking available.  
5882923,48236936,2015-09-24,30850655,Sherry,"Terry was so welcoming & there were so many amenities close by, everything we needed!"
5882923,49053929,2015-09-30,17771184,Dave & Jess,"Our stay in Seattle was wonderful thanks to Roger and Terry's hospitality! The apartment was clean, comfortable, and had everything we needed - including an iron, electric tea kettle, blow dryer, and more. Terry and Roger were even kind enough to leave us juice, bagels, and yogurt for our first morning after arriving on a very late flight the prior night. The location was ideal - close to a market, a bus stop, and several cute shops and restaurants. We could not leave a more glowing review...this apartment really was our ""home away from home"" in Seattle! Highly recommend, and many thanks to our lovely hosts. "
5882923,49769978,2015-10-06,2664600,Stephen,"I have nothing but great things to say about this space. It was exactly as described. All the comforts of home are here at this gorgeous apartment.

Getting around town was easy! We rented a car and there was plenty of on street parking. About 10 minutes drive to all the tourist attractions and we never hit any traffic.

Terry is amazing, he kept in contact by texting through the app and made sure we had everything we needed.

I would recommend this space to ANYONE heading to Seattle. Affordable, gorgeous and gracious hosts. We will return for sure!"
5882923,50102697,2015-10-09,1168573,Anna,"What wonderful hosts to a charming apartment!  The north Seattle residential location was just right, and the efficient apartment was perfect in accommodations and adornments.  Good taste and care are evident throughout.  Be certain to get Terry's
nearby restaurant reviews!"

5882923,51282200,2015-10-19,16065222,Will,"Terry was a perfect host. He was kind enough to answer a few of our questions about Seattle, as well as where to find food on the first night. One evening when we came home, we found a small pumpkin left outside the door, which was a nice touch. The apartment was a lovely garden unit, decorated with photos of he and his partner (what a cute pair!) as well as art from their trips to Mexico. The apartment was very comfortable, and we greatly enjoyed our stay."
5882923,51718331,2015-10-24,6399603,Samantha,"Terry's apartment was just what we needed - cozy, convenient to everything we wanted to do, and it really did have all the comforts of home. We appreciated the bagels, orange juice, and yogurt on our first morning; street parking was always available; the bed was extremely comfortable (which we needed after all the traveling!); and the heated floors kept the apartment surprisingly warm. 

Although we didn't get a chance to meet Terry or Roger as they were out of town, Terry made sure to check in throughout our stay to see if there was anything that we needed and would promptly respond to any questions. All in all, it was a wonderful stay in Seattle!"
5882923,51990133,2015-10-25,21558328,Leo,"Wonderful apartment, excellent area, couldn't be more pleased and would recommend it without reservations."
5882923,52216997,2015-10-27,31075482,Marsha,"This is my second stay at the host's apartment & I now consider it my Seattle ""home"". Everything about it is delightful, from the spacious, beautifully decorated rooms to the breakfast ""goodies"" in the refrigerator. The hosts provide so many extras. There is even an umbrella in case of rain. I cannot imagine staying anywhere else when I visit Seattle."
5882923,52464315,2015-10-29,34019081,Sean,"Aloha Terry!
I loved your apartment it was comfortable, clean, well equipped and very well designed. I can see the thoughtfulness that went into this apartment you have a wonderful aesthetic. I felt very welcome by you, thank you for your hospitality. Your suggestion on where to go, places to eat, your courtesy and concern for my comfort and your respect for my privacy are greatly appreciated. The neighborhood was safe and friendly and conveniently provided for everything I could possibly need.  I really enjoyed my stay.
Mahalo, Sean"
5882923,52968118,2015-11-03,39516117,Eve,"I absolutely loved the host they were kind, friendly,and thoughtful the place was everything it said and better it was so comfortable I didn't want to go home.better than a hotel if I ever visit Seattle again I vwould definitely stay here again."
5882923,53247857,2015-11-07,17430453,Elizabeth,We had a great experience at the apartment. Very tidy and warm place with every accommodation you could possibly need. 
5882923,53643730,2015-11-10,147315,Nat,"I had a fantastic stay!  The apartment is lovely, homey and comfortable.  It's located in a beautiful neighborhood.  I spent the majority of my time on this long weekend out visiting local friends at the start of a week's vacation.  It was wonderful to spend lazy mornings in this beautiful space.  I'd absolutely stay there again."
5882923,53782326,2015-11-12,578490,Jake,"Terry's apartment was large and very comfortable. The location was excellent, mere steps from blocks of restaurants but still quiet. I would stay here again."
5882923,54235295,2015-11-17,5626708,Adam,"I booked this place for my parents while they were visiting us. It was right in the neighborhood and very convenient. Here are a couple of quotes from my folks to provide some insight:

Mom: ""A gem in the emerald city.""

Dad: ""A beautiful place that made you feel right at home.""

My take? The homeowners were really great and accommodating, making sure my parents were comfortable and happy with the place every step of the way. They provided bagels for the first morning and some excellent coffee. The place is steps away from some of Phinney Ridge's best coffee shops, pubs, restaurants, and PIZZA!

Inside, the apartment is specious and well appointed. My partner insists she would rather live there than in our own place in Greenwood!

I'll recommend Terry and Roger's place to any future visitors.
"
5882923,54847103,2015-11-25,11519451,Jennifer,"Our experience at Terry's was great. The apartment was perfect for my husband and me. It was comfortable and cozy with all the amenities of home. The location is great with plenty of shops and restaurants in walking distance. It is a short drive to downtown, or surrounding neighborhoods like Ballard. Parking did seem tight, but we did not have an issue finding a space close to the house. I thought it was rather easy, but I live in SF, so my idea of easy parking may be distorted. 
We loved the place and location, and Terry is a super nice guy. We will definitely stay again! "
5882923,55356576,2015-12-01,42436713,Emily,"Terry was a great host from the beginning. He was very accessible to contact with any questions we had, and was diligent about getting all the necessary info for the apartment days before and upon arrival. The place was all warmed up for us when we got there and very roomy. The bed was also comfier than mine at home which was an added bonus. There is a great locally owned grocery store nearby and plenty of coffee shops. The place is also conveniently located near GreenLake which is a great place for walking and running. As someone familiar with the Seattle area this a prime spot for visitors and a short drive or bus ride away to all the attractions and fun neighborhoods. Terry was a wonderful host, and we will definitely be staying here again! "
5882923,55824418,2015-12-06,21558328,Leo,"We are repeat guests at the new apartment and we loved it even more than the first visit.  Again, the wonderful area and the amazingly comfortable accommodations made our trip memorable and we recommend this apartment without reservations.  You will enjoy your stay here.  "
5882923,56066607,2015-12-08,15323305,David,Wonderful stay.  Great location.  Very clean.
5882923,56716417,2015-12-17,5742193,Stephanie,"Terry was very attentive, eventhough he wasn't going to be there, He made sure to give us all the pertinent details to get in and the contact person, we could ask any questions of and even her tel #."
5882923,57210543,2015-12-23,43386031,Nick,"Terry's place was even better than expected, warm and inviting, decked out for the Holidays.  Walkable to many fun places from the zoo to Greenlake, shops and good food and drink...close in but quiet and comfortable, it felt like home.  We hope to return!"
5882923,58314733,2016-01-02,2991479,Ruth,"We had a lovely visit at Terry's cozy downstairs apartment. It has a queen size bed, heated floors, a lovely kitchen and wonderful bathroom. The location can't be beat - close to two great coffee shops as well as Ken's Market, restaurants, to say nothing of the Woodland Park Zoo. We'll be back!"
1686930,7931781,2013-10-08,6284522,Lisa,"If you have up to 4 people coming to Seattle, this is a great place to stay. Everything in this apartment is so comfortable, especially the beds. There are two soft arm chairs in the living area which I loved. The kitchen is surprisingly big and we found it was really convenient having the laundry for our use. Even with 4 guests we never felt cramped here, it's very spacious except for the bathroom, but it still has everything you need. Despite being a basement apartment there is loads of natural light, and you have so much privacy it's as if you are in a stand alone house. This location is also an added bonus, you can walk into town within 20 minutes and taxi back (it's a steep hill!) 
I really recommend this place if you want a modern and very comfortable place to stay in a great part of town. "
1686930,8394447,2013-10-28,2299579,Emily,"My husband and I shared this beautiful place with my brother in law and girlfriend. It was the perfect place to be able to see each other and also have our privacy from one another. Upon  our arrival, Paige left us a bottle of wine, a note, and a well organized folder of the city. The apartment was beautiful decorated and very clean! She supplied great shampoo and conditioner and even makeup removers (I loved that since I forgot mine). All in all, our visit was great and we would love to return. "
1686930,9115484,2013-12-08,9126555,Adam,"Paige's rental space is great.  Large and cozy, nicely decorated and appointed.  The location in the Queen Ann neighbourhood can't be beat for that trendy/artsy feel in a safe family oriented area.  We would/will definitely stay here again if visiting Seattle.  The hosts are good people (and even looked after our kids which allowed us to go out and be irresponsible ;)


"
1686930,9346078,2013-12-23,9816184,Maggie,"Hands down the most comfortable bed I have ever slept on. Great location, clean, and welcoming. I would recommend staying here for anyone."
1686930,10134719,2014-02-02,9681765,Drew,A five star location with a full kitchen and above average bedding. Paige was a great host . Very helpful and accommodating . The apartment is in close proximity to a large array of shopping and dining. 
1686930,10363467,2014-02-16,390803,Nicole,"The apartment is a great choice -- very nicely appointed and great little touches. Although I did not get to meet Paige, she left a nice note and amenities, and the couple of interactions with those living upstairs were very nice. Do not worry too much about it being an underground flat -- it's brightly lit and decorated, with a homey feel. Comfortable for two couples, nice beds and rooms with adequate closet space. Very clean and sophisticated. Great neighborhood with convenient bus service downtown. And our dog was so happy to find a bed ready for her in the living room! Would happily stay again. Thanks, Paige!
"
1686930,10411762,2014-02-17,2309966,Ash & William Landon,"The place was cozy, pet friendly  and well stocked up. It was close to everything and Paige gave us great tips for eating and nightlife. The only drawback is the bathroom, it was tiny and couldn't fit couple of my friends who were over 6ft. "
1686930,10553208,2014-02-24,10807588,Keith,"What a great little spot! Lots of space inside, nice yard, beautiful neighbourhood, well appointed apartment with super comfortable beds! We will most certainly be coming back to this Hideout!

Thanks so much for the stay!!! see you again soon!!!"
1686930,11155209,2014-03-23,10624340,Sunny,"Paige's apt is really nice and clean. All the thing in the apt make me feel at home, especially the supper comfortable bed and also the two arm chairs. The top Queen Anne where the apt located is a quiet and safe district and is also convenient to take No.2 bus to downtown without renting a car. 
Paige is so nice even we haven't met. She left a card for me some map information. She also gave me some good  recommendation on food, shopping and transport. The UBER ride which she recommends is convenient and cheap comparing to others.
If you need a quiet and comfortable home near downtown Seattle, just book it! "
1686930,11298190,2014-03-29,6533362,Anne,"We really enjoyed Paige's beautifully designed and decorated apartment; it was spotlessly clean, very comfortable beds, cushy towels, well appointed kitchen for morning coffee and tea and fixing up leftovers from lunch or dinner out; and the bathroom, although it would be very small for tall or big people, worked fine for two average-sized women (one at a time!).  We enjoyed the comfy living room for relaxing after our evening out on the town, and we'd also had a beautiful walk in the neighborhood in the afternoon.  The area is full of gorgeous historic homes and walkways overlooking the water; a well-organized guide-book on the counter was helpful for finding our way around.  Wonderful location for a visit combining relaxation and activity!  We would definitely visit again!"
1686930,12842557,2014-05-12,4729001,Hhartson,"3 adults and a toddler stayed the weekend at Paige's cozy apartment.  It was well decorated and the beds were very comfortable!  While it is a basement apartment, it was very bright and well appointed.  The dogs who live upstairs were very friendly, and super cute!  My only caution is that if you are over 6' the shower is a little snug.
Paige made everything very easy from the initial contact to checking out, she was very responsive to all our questions and left great recommendations for dining and shopping in the neighborhood.
The neighborhood is lovely and quiet and the apartment is a short walk from Trader Joes and all the stores and restaurants on Queen Anne Boulevard.  It was  very convenient to downtown  and the freeway for day trips to  Woodinville for wine tasting.  
Highly reccomended!


 "
1686930,13239810,2014-05-23,4359402,Elsie,"I have nothing but great things to say about our stay at Paige's beautiful apartment! We arrived in Seattle early in the morning after driving overnight from San Francisco, but Paige was so welcoming and graciously accommodated our very early check-in. She provided excellent directions to the house and clear instructions for how to access the unit. 

The apartment itself is gorgeous! Its garden entrance is very private and the interior is spacious, bright, and inviting. Paige has awesome taste in home decor - you will find yourself taking pictures (or mental notes) of all of the furnishings so that you can replicate it in your own home. 

Overall, it was a wonderful time in Seattle thanks to Paige's hospitality and beautiful apartment. We will definitely be back to the Queen Anne Hideaway!"
1686930,13808809,2014-06-04,1718037,Chris,"Paige's place was incredible.  The lighting, layout and amenities were top notch.  I host and she gave me some great ideas to make my place better.  Her neighborhood might be my favorite in Seattle.  She's going to see me again, that for certain.  Being able to bring my dog made this the perfect place."
1686930,14727509,2014-06-25,3033317,Matthew,"Paige was an amazing host and we could not have been more happy with our experience. She answered all of our questions promptly and made us feel right at home. The apartment was extremely comfortable and we did not once feel as if we were intruding on their space.
The apartment was everything we expected and more. It is within easy walking distance to restaurants, bars, shopping, parks and downtown Seattle. We would highly recommend staying here and we would most definitely stay here again on our next visit to Seattle. "
1686930,14840364,2014-06-27,14470460,Martin,"Very comfortable place! Great location and great hosts! I was in Seattle with a colleague for work and all the hotels nearby were booked up. This was way better than staying in a hotel.

Thank you Paige for all the amazingly detailed information and communicating so well and promptly."
1686930,14973240,2014-06-30,11660387,Kris,"First, Paige is a lovely and gracious woman. We were warmly welcomed and then turned loose. Our apt. was exactly as described….clean, nicely decorated, so comfortable, quiet and what a great location.  I was so pleased to find coffee and cream in the fridge. Kitchen is stocked and then some with the basic. Really couldn't ask for a nicer experience. 
"
1686930,15530065,2014-07-11,14847932,Kim,"Great neighborhood, location, accommodation!  Loved it.  Perfect for a Girls week in Seattle.  Walking distance to great restaurants, coffee, ice cream, and Trader Joe's.  Great price for what you get.  I will definitely stay here again next time I'm in Seattle with friends.  "
1686930,15631362,2014-07-13,16009038,Mark,"The apartment was just as advertised. A beautiful, well maintained basement apartment in a wonderfully quiet part of town that was close to the action but far enough away to separate yourself from the downtown and bar type areas. Paige gave great instructions for getting to the apartment, getting around, etc. We never actually met (which I had no problems with) but stayed in contact via texts and offered advice and recommendations during our stay. We couldn't have been more pleased to end our 10 day road trip here. My only complaint would be that the shower was a bit small but it's a very minor complaint"
1686930,15999351,2014-07-20,10257364,Becky,"Hi this apartment is truly lovely! It was clean, roomy, well equipped (there were even dressing gowns to use if we'd wanted!) and very stylish. We all loved staying here esp when we met the dogs who were all very friendly.  The neighbourhood is also great with shops and cafés just down the street and with the bus stop just outside the house made getting into town very easy.  We also used the Uber app which Paige recommends which I'd also now recommend as it was quick and easy.  Paige herself was really helpful and easy to communicate with and patient! I'd not read the entry instructions properly so she had to text them to me, this was entirely my fault but she was brilliant, so thanks again Paige for everything. "
1686930,17279210,2014-08-10,16544527,Cyndi,"Loved staying here! Cute Victorian home in the beautiful Queen Anne district. Right on the bus route which made site seeing really easy. Lots of restaurants, Trader Joe's etc. within walking distance. Paige was great and very accommodating. Hope to make it back soon! "
1686930,17982735,2014-08-19,13466643,Molly,"Wish we could have stayed longer. Really nicely renovated spacious basement apartment. Was very clean. Paige was easy to get in touch with when we got turned around finding our way there. Loved the cafe and doughnut shop around the corner too.

"
1686930,18006976,2014-08-20,17376999,Michelle,"We had a great time staying in Paige's cute, cozy home in Queen Anne. The place was very clean and was exactly as pictured. Although our stay was short, we enjoyed staying here very much! "
1686930,18464042,2014-08-27,6002261,Luis,"Great place. Roomy, clean, conveniently close to restaurants/shopping/cafes. Comfortable beds. Paige was a friendly and responsive host. Highly recommended."
1686930,18673059,2014-08-30,6247130,Tas,"We had an incredibly good time at Paige’s place – the apartment was in a gorgeous heritage Victorian home, in a great location (lovely stately treelined streets, a short walk to the Seattle Center, Space Needle etc), well equipped and roomy. Paige was an absolute gem and helped us with recommendations for getting around, where to eat, and helped us make bookings at restaurants when we needed assistance. My girlfriend found the bed so comfortable she is looking at purchasing one when we get home. Thanks Paige!"
1686930,19318294,2014-09-10,15219996,Ludo,"Great place, great host. The neighborhood was perfect and had everything we needed. Would book again and happy to recommend."
1686930,19395091,2014-09-11,7076150,Anna,Great spot on Queene Anne in Seattle. Paige allowed me to check in early which helped tremendously during my business trip. 
1686930,19442258,2014-09-12,3712480,Henry,Great experience.  Easy to access
1686930,20216309,2014-09-25,8315606,Jack,"This place is great.  It is a perfect blend of location, quiet, beautiful neighborhood, comfortable place and feeling like you are home for one night or many.  I was traveling with my two daughters aged 4&2 alone from Shanghai to the west coast and decided to stay over a day in Seattle before we headed onward so they could adjust.  Our flight landed early and Page worked so we could get the place around noon.  The two little ones needed a comfortable place to decompress and they had it.  The apartment is basement, but it is a Hal basement and gets very good light.  There are many restaurants very close by and the village itself feels like a small town within a bigger one.  Driving you are 10 min from Pike Place.  Queen Anne is on a hill, a quite steep one at that so if you walk going down is easy.  There are places around the neighborhood to get views of the city and the sound.  Best is you like dogs as there are a few in the building.  If you like dogs, perfect, one of them might come and stay a while.  "

Upon entry, we instantly fell in love with the place. The house was spotless and it quickly felt like home. We spent two nights here, exploring the city and every time we came ""home"" we had such a great sigh of relief. The beds were so comfortable. The house decor was adorable. We have zero complaints about this place and would recommend it to anyone! If we decide to visit Seattle again, we are definitely staying here again. Thank you Paige! "
1686930,21947392,2014-10-27,20615021,McCall,"The Hideaway is a cute, cozy 2-bedroom spot. Very clean and comfortable. Walking distance to restaurants and bakeries. Set in a very beautiful quiet Victorian neighborhood."
1686930,22645082,2014-11-11,18744320,Amy,"Paige was a wonderful host! First off, she was very good about communication before and during our time in Seattle. Upon arrival, we had forgotten to print out our Seattle City Pass, but Paige was so kind enough print it out for us! Seriously, from the minute we met her, she was helpful in recommending restaurants and must see sights! Paige and her husband have an absolutely beautiful home. We fell in love with our place for the weekend right away! Everything about it was so cute and cozy! The colors, furniture and decorations gave the place a real homey feel to it. And those beds were truly amazing! The house was absolutely spotless, with all the amenities you could think of available. If I had to be a hard critic about something, I would say the filtered water faucet in the kitchen poured very slowly. However, if you don’t mind tap water, go that route! We did, and tasted just as good! As for Seattle, we absolutely loved it! It really is a great city, with tons of sites, foods and events to keep you busy. The best thing, all our destinations were an $8 to $15 Uber or Lyft ride away! If I haven’t talked about Paige enough, here’s a bit more. On our last day we had a late evening flight, and wanted to continue sightseeing, but didn’t want to carry our bags with us. Paige was kind enough to let us leave all our belongings at the home, while we continued to explore Seattle. I highly recommend staying here, not only for the perfect place, but for the fantastic host too! We will definitely be coming back! "

Paige made it easy to ""check in"" and there were plenty of amenities to make the first night smooth,  including coffee for the morning.The location is awesome,  right near some lovely views and neighborhoods,  and off the main drag.  It was pretty quiet,  but also close to some good restaurants and shops. the perfect mix.  I would highly recommend this location for anyone visiting Seattle. Much nicer than staying in a hotel! "
1686930,29404968,2015-04-07,11175398,Nadine,"We stayed at Paige's Hideaway for the long Easter weekend and we truly enjoyed our time there. As we arrived early I had asked Paige if we could drop our luggage which wasn't a problem. The apartment is exactly as the pictures show, spacious kitchen and living room area and very cosy bedrooms - the beds are very comfortable, got a great sleep! The kitchen offers everything you need, we couldn't ask for more! The living room has two amazing rocking chairs and the entire hideaway is beautifully designed. Paige has even cosy bathrobes for her guests and bathroom is well stocked as well. Again, you couldn't ask for more. We absolutely enjoyed our stay and we certainly would book it again. Queen Anne is a nice & safe neighbourhood, with everything you need within walking distance - a pity that we only explored it on Monday, on our last day. But we followed Paige's recommendations and had a lovely dinner on Saturday night at Bettys and we also tried the local Pizzeria - yummie! I personally think it's a bit far to walk downtown (I guess it would take you 30-45minutes) but there is a stop bus right outside the house which has two bus lines (#2 and 29)bringing you downtown and there's another one (#13) just 5mins walk away. The bus ride into downtown takes about 10minutes and passes the Seattle Centre where the Space Needle, EMP, Pacific Science etc. are located so you get a nice view. 
Paige was a great host, we actually didn't meet but we emailed prior to our stay and texted over the weekend to get some more advice. I also like the fact that she uses bathroom & kitchen products from The Honest Company which focuses on safe, eco-friendly products. There were also brochures about Seattle - what to do, what to see in the living room in case you didn't plan your trip prior to arrival. And of course the wifi and the keypad on the front door helped a lot!  
Thanks again Paige for a wonderful stay!"
1686930,29726231,2015-04-12,17569448,Carol,"We found this lovely apartment just as advertised.  It was in immaculate condition when we arrived.  This apartment is a gem.  It is in the perfect location to enjoy all that Seattle has to offer. Of course the memory foam mattress with a feather topper and quiet location, would give anyone a rested feeling so you can take on the day. What more can we say, we could not have stayed anywhere else that was so comfortable for all of us, doggie included.  He loved the yard the other dogs and exploring the neighborhood with us.  Also, with just a short walk you could be eating great pizza and organic coffee!  You will enjoy yourself if you stay, Paige is a great host, thank you again."
1686930,30377724,2015-04-21,1472352,Vanessa,"Paige's Hideaway was an absolute gem. Located near cute shops, delicious coffee, and a beautiful view of the sound steps from the house - I can't think of a better place to stay in Seattle. The home is clean, cozy, and has plenty of amenities to make you feel comfortable (coffee, toiletries, etc). Paige was extremely kind and welcoming when we crossed paths in the shared yard, and her doggies are absolute gems."
1686930,30583181,2015-04-24,414366,Kelly,I absolutely loved my stay at The Hideaway. The rooms were cozy and the location is unbeatable! Hope to stay there again soon.
1686930,30771806,2015-04-27,16116062,Arlene,"We had a great stay at Paige's basement apartment in Queen-Ann.  Even though the apt was located on a lower level,it did not have a basement feel at all. It was well lit, felt very bright and still managed to get enough light in during the day.  Her beds were very comfortable, everything was clean, and Paige gave us great recommendations for things to do in the Seattle area.  Paige's place was also walking distance to a great ice cream shop, coffee shop and pizza place with great late night happy hour.  Overall, we had an incredible stay. "
1686930,31600546,2015-05-07,31182905,Ziyan,We had a wonderful stay at Paige's house! The location is very convenient! And the rooms are very clean and nice! We would highly recommend 
1686930,32915777,2015-05-23,31996484,Tina,"Queen Anne is a great location.  We were able to get to many highlighted spots in Seattle from this location.  The apartment was very nice and clean.  The Host gave us directions to the place and how to get in.  We never met her, but she was out of town for part of our time at the house.  There was a problem with the TV and while we were gone one day, she came in and fixed it.  The house had many kitchen amenities so we could cook when we wanted too.  I would recommend to have more towels at the house - only 4 were there so we needed to do laundry after a few days.  Also, the noise from the people above can be loud in the morning and our 20 year old kids slept in but we just got up.  Overall, a very good experience.  "
1686930,33516456,2015-05-29,2724104,Matt,"Great place to stay in Seattle!  The Queen Anne location is ideal to get south to downtown or north to Freemont/Ballard areas.  Walking distance to really great coffee, donut and ice cream shops!  Bus stop right outside the house and plenty of off-street parking available.  Really nice basement apartment with comfy chairs, couch, beds and linens!  Paige was really easy to communicate with and takes great care of this place.  She even catered to our needs that we had with our baby traveling with us.  Highly recommend!!"
1686930,33985014,2015-06-03,28857856,Nicki,The Hideaway was a fantastic apartment in a great location within Seattle. The hosts were great at communicating prior to arrival so that we found the flat with ease and moved in with no problems. The place was incredibly spacious and comfortable. So much so that we opted for a night in rather than go out - which was lovely. We were able to walk into Seattle easily - but there was also a bus stop outside - so brilliant for touring the city as well. 
1686930,34786672,2015-06-12,32541875,Dereck,"If your using public transport and want to be just a little ways from the hustle and bustle of downtown Seattle, this place is exactly what your looking for. Bus stop just outside the door that takes you anywhere in the city. Stops about every 30 minutes but you can access up to date info on a transport app to your phone. 
The beds here are comfortable and there is plenty of pace for  a family of 4. 
Host are not intrusive and helpful."
1686930,35227572,2015-06-16,32997950,Meredith,What a pleasure it was to stay at The Hideaway! It was a very comfortable size for my whole family and much roomier than it looks in the pictures. It's in the perfect location too-- the bus to downtown is right out front and the spectacular view of the city from Kerry Park is just around the corner! Highly recommended for a leisurely visit to Seattle!
1686930,35630880,2015-06-21,3393217,Nicole,"The neighborhood was beautiful and quiet. This was a great space. Tons of room, everything you could need. The bathroom is small but we even managed to have 4 women sharing it and it worked. :) The beds are amazingly comfortable - I slept like a rock. Paige has created a very peaceful and welcoming space. "
1686930,36266509,2015-06-27,29663058,Jeff,"Very clean and very comfortable for 4 people. Did use was washer/dryer bc weather was hot. We did cook a bit but on vacation I like to try the local food plus we were out most of the day. We used the public transportation system to get around and nice there was a bus stop out front. Also there was wi-fi.  Walk to Kerry Park for spectacular view of downtown and Mt. Rainer. Also we walked to Seattle Center in about 20 minutes. Shops and restaurants along Queene Anne were fun as was the Thursday market-fruit cheaper than at Pike Market, and some good food booths if you wanted to eat dinner there.  There is a Safeway store a half block past the Trader Joe. We would stay again. We didn't meet The host just the pooches. Enjoy your stay! "
1686930,36754919,2015-07-01,24164438,Julie,"Amazing place, lovely neighbourhood and Paige was very helpful and friendly "
1686930,41577192,2015-08-08,2771802,Katheryn,"My sister and I had a double date with our husbands here.  Paige was absolutely wonderful.  She gave us all the information we needed prior to our arrival and gave us our space but was friendly and informative while we were there.  The Hideaway is even more darling than pictured.  There are so many relaxing and welcoming touches!  Thank you, Paige for starting off our vacation in such a perfect way!"
1686930,41915799,2015-08-10,26373870,Rachel,"Our recent stay at The Hideaway was spectacular! A friend and I came up with our two daughters for the weekend and the Hideaway was the perfect place to accommodate all of us. It was beautiful, had plenty of space, extremely clean and in a quiet and beautiful neighborhood, without being too far from any Seattle activities or dining. Everything we could have needed was provided in the Hideaway from the basics of clean towels and plenty of kitchen utensils to extra shampoo and hair products! The beds were also extremely comfortable. Paige was the perfect host with great suggestions of where to eat and how to get around and encouraged us to call her if we had any questions or needed anything. My only regret was not booking another night! We can't wait to come back to The Hideaway and stay in this beautiful airbnb in an absolutely perfect neighborhood...
"
1686930,42202432,2015-08-11,19797313,Catherine,"Paige was very informative during the entire process. She sent us a detailed description of the area and local amenities. We absolutely LOVED her place! The beds were extremely comfortable (we ended up sleeping way past our alarms). The decor was adorable. We ended up hanging out on the back patio with wine and cheese for an hour before exploring the city. We saw Paige and her family in passing and she was extremely nice, recommending different restaurants and areas of Seattle! Everything was very clean, plenty of towels, dishes, etc. Just up the street there are plenty of good restaurants and a Trader Joes. Parking is also very easy to find here. "
1686930,43571064,2015-08-20,3258151,Michael,"Our family of four stayed at Paige's apartment in the Seattle and had a great experience. The apartment was as described and fit our needs wonderfully and much better option to the hotels in Seattle. Took a cab from the location (not all service the area, we used Orange cab) and the trip to downtown was only ~$8 for the 4 of us each way. Would love to rent again when we are in the area again. "
1686930,45953732,2015-09-07,38034106,Veronica,Love this cozy place. Two comfortable rooms for 2 couple and a full kitchen for simple cooking. Very close to Kerry Park and locate in a quiet area. Close to the most famous ice cream shop! Although we didn't get a chance to try. Open at noon...
1686930,49974390,2015-10-08,18280972,Bernd,"Es ist wunderschön. Die Lage ist perfekt, Busstation gleich am Haus und fährt direkt nach Downtown. Das Appartment ist sehr sauber und liebevoll eingerichtet. Der Kontakt mit Paige ist reibungslos Sie beantwortet jede Frage sofort und ist sehr freundlich. Wenn wir wieder nach Seattle kommen werden wir defintiv dieses Appartment buchen!"
1686930,50746867,2015-10-14,16716065,Jenny,"Beautiful basement apartment with everything we needed. Very cozy! We loved it! It is a basement apt so upstairs walking/running can be heard, so not for very light sleepers like one our friend was. Overall wonderful place to spend a vacation at :)"
1686930,51572503,2015-10-21,8656935,Serena,"My fiancé, fur children and I enjoyed ourselves at the hideaway and found it to be better than the description! Paige is an awesome host with an eye for perfection. Paige knows the Queen Anne area quite well and can direct you to all the wonderful things! We plan to use the hideaway with every trip to Seattle. "
1686930,52072049,2015-10-26,24681789,Shaun,"First off , wow! We all really enjoyed our stay in Sesttle. The house was easy to find, we were greeted  by a little doggie and his little land minds :/ right in the entrance way of the basement door. Would have been nice for someone to take the time to make sure the path was free and clear of doggie poo. The basement was wonderfully decorated and light to our surprise. The beds were comfortable as well. Over all we really enjoyed our home away from home. Just an fyi if you're a tall person good luck with the shower, it made for a 5'2 person. "
1686930,52841879,2015-11-02,4105481,Jenny,"The Hideaway was a comfortable stay for four people and one cat. It was nice to be able to bring a pet along on this trip. Paige was very accommodating, letting us stay a little while after the designated checkout time so we could spend more time exploring Seattle. The space was clean and cozy, and we had a great visit."
1686930,55901731,2015-12-07,28657819,Vendalyn,"A very friendly host who reassured us when we were unfamiliar with the Queen Anne area of Seattle. A ""Hello"" sign that made us feel welcome into a homey two bedroom basement apartment. My sister said she slept all night and so did I in super comfy beds. You will love this place!"
8953255,54058030,2015-11-15,48009095,Kevin,"My experience was great just as I expected! Alex replied pretty fast to everything I was asking him, he's a cool chill guy to meet! The house was clean warm and very cozy! It's a great spot to rent out, hoping I can come back one day!"
8919372,53546399,2015-11-09,26868652,Edward,"Great place and fantastic location. Clean, strong wifi, and positive vibe. Easy to get to."
8919372,54915375,2015-11-25,21008073,Lexy,"The apartment lived up to the listing. It was furnished with everything necessary to live like I do from home while staying in Seattle. The Internet worked great and so did the appliances. The laundry is a nice touch. Everything was clean and there were freshly washed towels waiting for me. I will definitely look to stay here again on my next trip. 

There was no in person interaction with the host, but there was assistance available via phone/email as needed. "
8919372,55259685,2015-11-29,3257238,Sandra,"I didn't actually meet Khanie, but we had a great stay at the property. The building was undergoing some renovations, so we weren't able to use the elevator, but this wasn't too much of a problem. There were very clear instructions left on how to get into the apartment and check-in was easy. 

The apartment is incredibly clean and has all the essentials you need in the kitchen, bathroom, bedroom, and living room (kitchen supplies, toiletries, extra towels & blankets, etc). The apartment is also centrally located: nice to walk around, close to public transit, and in an area where there is plenty of nightlife and things to do--even on Thanksgiving day! Overall, we had a really comfortable stay. "
8919372,55740841,2015-12-05,22805669,Long,"Good experience overall.  Had some difficulties getting into the building at first because no one was there to assist, but once we got someone on the phone everything was fine.  There was construction going on when we were there so there were noise issues, but that's not khanies fault."
8919372,58365554,2016-01-02,31786182,Nelle,The place was clean and well kept. The hallways were just a bit messy but the location made up for it ten fold. Very prompt replies to any questions and very professional. Quite a late check in but all in all a good experience! Thanks
5471427,30981992,2015-04-30,20576297,Robert,"First of all this host is new to Airbnb so has some glitches that more experienced hosts have found out about and do not do. These are mostly newbie mistakes that other hosts have had enough experience to rectify so they are no longer experienced by guests.

One problem I had that  is not the hosts fault but I will mention anyways is my vehicle had a side window broken while parked where I was told to park and a computer stolen. This has cost me over 1000.00 to rectify, a new computer being the bulk of this cost.

The host through feedback has been better able to explain his dwelling on his AirBnb site.

On his site he describes 10:00 PM being the beginning of quiet time. From the day I got there till I felt the need to go to a hotel for 1 night it was loud. The loudness was solved for me by my host providing a fan to create white noise when I came back even though he insisted that different people have different levels that they think are loud. At the end of my month stay there AirBnb investigated and reimbursed me on my credit card for the night I had to leave near  1:00 AM to get some sleep. If fan noise bothers you, you may want to take this into consideration. 

2 weeks prior to my stay I was informed by my host there would be no kitchen rights. I agreed to this since I felt I had not enough time to research and find another place. When I arrived I found out that the home was full of college and post college kids and my room was in the basement next to the washer/dryer. I am an older adult. I also found out my host would not be in the home but his business partner would sometimes be there and sometimes not. One time when I was talking in the basement with one of the young adults there the business partner sleepily showed up to join the conversation and when the young adult commented he did not know he was there he replied ""You can never  know when I am here."" Not something I would expect someone to say in a business. Something you say to children so they behave. The young adults except for the other AirBnb guest have long term leases. Everybody but me had kitchen rights, even the other AirBnb guest. A more experienced host would not give everybody kitchen rights except for one person. I never got kitchen rights.

The host did not believe in paper towels but I was able to talk him into allowing me to buy them to cover my inroom microwave food so it would not splash and then taking them for a walk to dispose of them in public trash can. He eventually bought plastic covers after I had already bought paper towels, and dusters.

I wish him well and success.

5471427,38620947,2015-07-17,21503727,Cameron,"Daniel is incredibly welcoming, perhaps the best Airbnb host I've had! He frequently texted with ideas of Seattle attractions and special events to check out while I was in town. The apartment was easy to access, and arrival/departure instructions were clear and painless. Located in a great area, this spot is ideal for travelers who want access to the U District and surrounding neighborhoods. The room was clean and comfortable, and outfitted with a few nice luxuries. All-in-all, a great place at a very reasonable rate."
5471427,40489135,2015-07-31,37620016,Teagan,"My stay at Daniel's was seamless! I stayed for about ~2 weeks. The house is in a great area, and easy to locate. Semi-private access to the finished basement in the back. Pictures well represented what the room actually looks like. I never did run into Daniel, but met other roommates in the house and they were very pleasant. Daniel offered great advice and suggestions to do/see. Overall a really great experience! "
5471427,47675114,2015-09-21,39391764,Chris,"Ravena is a beautiful, quiet neighborhood with lots of greenery. The nearby Ravena park offers a bit of nature for those so inclined. (And great running, too!) A bus stop with two lines is just a block away, and a stop with even more lines is five blocks away. Daniel was a great host and has a nice place. My room (in the basement) was quite clean and looked as advertised. "
5471427,48802300,2015-09-28,40649685,Yavor,"I really enjoyed my stay. The place was well run and quiet. The location is great - 30 minutes to downtown by bus. Buses run until 1 am, and there is a late night bus (83) from downtown at 2am and 3:30 am. Daniel was very helpful and the check in process went smoothly."
5471427,50129346,2015-10-09,44506287,Nini,"The room is ok. It is a private room full furniture and home electronics
 Dan is very nice and friendly."
5471427,52618798,2015-10-31,38525010,Lauren,"I stayed here for about 2 weeks while apartment hunting. I found it generally pretty quiet and extremely private as you are in the basement of the house. The people I did meet were really nice, I wish I had more time to spend with them! The kitchen is pretty messy so I did not cook hardly at all, but there is a microwave and fridge in the room that are clean. All in all it was totally worth it. "
5471427,55434555,2015-12-01,47900966,Sooman,Daniel was super nice and every once in a while gave me info on stuff that was happening around the city as well as check in on how my stay was going. As for the listing it was all accurate but I didn't realize that it would be similar to a hostel but on a smaller scale. Not sure if that is because of me reading the description incorrectly or if all airbnb's are like this. Also before booking I did my own research for how safe the area was and needless to say it checked a lot of my boxes for low crime rates.
4100009,19986875,2014-09-21,11745750,Jing,"Lara's apartment is full of details: red towels, bed cover, dish matt etc. matches black genuine leather sofa, white kitchen tables equipped with everything you ever wanted, including organic olive oil, salt, a shelf of spicy, wine glasses, and tasty coffee and camomile tea. My favorite part is bathroom - big and with very good toiletries...! Not mention the heating keeps all the space warm and cozy. It's just as convenient as home. The only down side of the flat is that it's not easy to get a cab over the weekend. But we managed to catch our bus. In conclusion, highly recommended."
4100009,20963989,2014-10-08,1007951,Mallory,"We really enjoyed our stay in Lara's newly renovated garden apartment. It was clean, spacious for 2 people and was nicely appointed. It was in a lovely neighborhood of upper Fremont and was walkable to lots of great shops and restaurants (we loved Via Tribunali pizza and Bluebird Ice Cream). It was also really easy to catch the Rapid Ride downtown and a bus to Wallingford or University Village. Lara was very friendly, easy to communicate with and was super helpful when we mistakenly left an important cord behind. We definitely recommend her place!"
4100009,21229956,2014-10-13,21543939,Mariposa,"I stayed here with my mother and grandmother while visiting my brother.  We found the space to be simply furnished with all the essentials.  We found the space cute, inviting and comfortable.  The host was friendly and accommodating where possible - quick to respond/answer questions.  The location was perfect for us - close to where we were going.  We felt the unit was very fairly priced.  There is no dedicated parking (slight inconvenience for my disabled mother and elderly grandmother) but I found no trouble finding street parking within a 1 to 2 block radius.  We would have liked to have a TV for mornings/late night, but really appreciated the shareable laundry room."
4100009,22078611,2014-10-29,22424705,Dayana,"Lara's place was amazing.  It was clean, quiet, and just what we needed.  The neighborhood and location are great.  Just one block to walk to the bus for downtown and it was a short walk to some good food near by.  The entrance to the side of the house was nice and private and we could come and go as we pleased. Lara was very responsive and easy to work with.  We indicated that we had 3 guests and the futon was made up already for us and worked just fine. Overall great experience and I would absolutely do this again! "
4100009,22795597,2014-11-15,17822434,Sarah,"Staying with Lara was lovely. The space was clean and welcoming. Having a private entrance was great, and the shower was a dream. It was wonderful to cook for ourselves for the week, and to be incredibly close to both a bus that goes directly into downtown Seattle and walkable and quirky Freemont."
4100009,23110963,2014-11-23,1524672,Dana And Eddie,"The home was conveniently located, very clean, well-decorated, well stocked with essentials, comfortable and easy to stay in. Host was excellent! The only negatives were lack of tv (wi-fi worked perfectly for streaming shows), noise from being underneath tenants, sound travels and we were not hoping to be early risers. 
Other than that, the apt was great and cozy!"
4100009,23390264,2014-11-30,23493816,Casey,"Very nice and clean basement apartment.  Actually more roomy than it looks in the pictures!  The host, Lara, is easy to contact and replies quickly.
Thanks for sharing your home with us!"
4100009,25023627,2015-01-05,10471341,Bartek,Pobyt u Lary był fantastyczny. Mieszkanie sterylnie czyste i ciepłe. Fantastyczna komunikacja z gospodarzem. Nie mieliśmy żadnych problemów. Lokalizacja bardzo dobra w ciechej i spokojnej dzielnicy. Nie ma problemu z miejscem parkingowym. Gorąco polecam to miejsce!!:)
4100009,25999777,2015-02-01,24448900,Turkka,I enjoyed my stay here. The place is cozy and comfortable in a nice neighborhood. It's a short walk away from Fremont's center with bars and restaurants. Bus stop to downtown is close by.
4100009,26271697,2015-02-08,10704837,Melinda,Lara made us feel quite welcome.  Our place was very tidy and even our daughter's bed was made up ready for her.  We were thrilled!
4100009,27210238,2015-02-28,5041037,Rachel,The appartment was great.  Even nicer than pictured.  We were very comfortable and enjoyed our stay.
4100009,27965916,2015-03-15,5197482,Kenneth,"Great accommodations. We loved the unit and thoughtfulness of our host. Especially the locally roasted coffee from the neighborhood coffee shop. The location was perfect for our activities in the Fremont and Ballard areas. One word of caution is that the unit has a low ceiling which those over 6' 1"" or so may want to consider. We would definitely stay there on a future visit. Thanks."
4100009,28613251,2015-03-27,23455936,Tsubasa,"This place is really good and comfortable place to stay. Rooms are clean and everything is organized. This place is pretty fancy place, and around there, there are some good coffee shops and restaurants, so you can definitely enjoy your stay in Seattle. Host is also good, she replies to you as soon as she can. That is why I did not feel uncomfortable. I recommend to stay there."
4100009,28826351,2015-03-30,29280389,Laura,"Lara's home was the perfect getaway stay for our weekend in Seattle. The apartment was stocked with everything we could have needed, even toiletries! The locations couldn't have been better close to fremont, Ballard, and many breweries, restaurants and shops within walking distance. Lara was close by and avaliable if we needed anything or had questions. This private basement is a fantastic rental, I'd love to stay again!"
4100009,29423278,2015-04-07,3577243,Mary,"This is a beautiful, spacious, sunlit apartment in a wonderful neighborhood!  The apartment was very clean, and tastefully decorated.  Lara was very sweet to leave us locally roasted coffee, and a variety of teas.  Plenty of towels and kitchen supplies, and the apartment was nice and warm."
4100009,29983602,2015-04-15,29456650,Patricia,"Lara's basement apartment was perfect for our stay in Seattle and we would definitely stay here again. It has lots of space, a complete kitchen, great internet, and the temperature was comfy. So much better than staying in a hotel! We used the bus system several times and the stops were conveniently located. The zoo, a large park, and a coffee shop are within walking distance. Thanks Lara for the coffee and the delicious Theo chocolate bar. By the way, the Theo factory is not too far away and it offers interesting tours. 
The only possible negative is that there are some fairly steep concrete steps leading up to the house which could be difficult for some people, especially with heavy luggage.

4100009,30391160,2015-04-21,28191793,Sonia,"This one bedroom, garden apartment is exactly as described. For my husband and I, it was spacious and suited our needs quite nicely. The location is pretty good as it's not terribly far from delicious restaurants and is close to public transportation. 
Lara kept in touch via email and we felt abe to contact her if we had any questions (we didn't)."
4100009,30885248,2015-04-28,14304184,Alan,Great stay. Apartment was just as described and everything went well. Lara kept in touch but I really didn't have any problems that needed her input. Would recommend. 
4100009,31150869,2015-05-02,9699560,Jeremy,"Clean and quite, love the neighborhood. Its a downstairs with its own access. "
4100009,31918374,2015-05-11,31181041,Todd,The listing description was accurate. The space was very beautiful and spacious. We had everything that we needed.
4100009,33911892,2015-06-02,30425604,Jody,Communication with Lara was excellent both before our stay and during our stay. The apartment was exactly as described. This is a great neighborhood - right at the uphill edge of Fremont. Easy walking distance to shopping and food in both Wallingford and Fremont. Kitchen was well equipped for us - we just had breakfast there every morning. Lara went the extra mile allowing us to leave our bags beyond the checkout time because we had a late flight.
4100009,34541167,2015-06-09,31936218,Deborah,"We loved our stay at Lara's home. The place was clean, cozy and very cutely decorated. We loved the location, and the convenience of being near transportation. It was so easy to get around. I would highly recommend anyone choosing to stay here, and would definitely stay here again myself."
4100009,36397058,2015-06-28,33040490,Amal,Very clean and cozy.  Will definitely consider to stay here again.  The owner was very easy to contact by text.  The kitchen had everything you could need for a short stay.  There was coffee and tea available for the morning.  A private side entrance was easy to access.
4100009,36892400,2015-07-02,27871475,Mark,"Communication from Lara was excellent - Prior to our arrival, procedures of how to enter the residence were provided, along with Lara'so contact info - Place was as described & pictured ... actually it was better than described & pictured  - Great location with nearby variety of restaurants, bars, statue of Lenin & a very large troll under a bridge"
4100009,38377522,2015-07-15,28889864,Chris,"My sister and I stayed at Lara's place for a few days, and it was a great experience. The apartment was very clean, and Lara had even put out fresh flowers and fruit for us. It was really nice. The location was ideal for us; we were within walking distance to the zoo, downtown Fremont, and all of the local shops and restaurants in between. 

Whenever we come back to Seattle, we are coming straight back to Fremont, and would love to stay with Lara again.

Thanks Lara for your hospitality!

-Chris and Courts"
4100009,39009926,2015-07-20,18002414,Betsy,We very much enjoyed staying in this apartment.  It is located in the Fremont neighborhood....two blocks from a bus that goes downtown and a few blocks from a good coffee place and market.  You can trust that the photos are accurate.
4100009,39734691,2015-07-26,28991117,Justin,"After spending the day running around helping my friends prepare for their wedding and doing all of that stuff, it was great to be able to come back and relax and rest in such a nice apartment. It's spacious, the bed was comfortable, and it's just as the pictures describe. Plenty of food choices within a few blocks or a short bus ride away, too. The next time I'm in Seattle, I would love to be able to stay here again. Thanks Lara!"
4100009,40321153,2015-07-30,13070997,Natalie,"Lara provided everything my family needed for our Seattle sleepover. Her little place was a home away from home. 
Many thanks, 
Natalie, Joe and Caroline."
4100009,42522966,2015-08-14,33746406,Manoj,"I had an amazing experience at Lara's: 5 nights in a spacious, fully-equipped 1 bedroom apartment conveniently located in Fremont. It was clean and quiet and cosy and comfortable. There was enough light even though this is a basement apartment. The little things (Roku with Netflix on the TV, fast wifi, warm blankets, coffee/tea, all the touches of a real home, etc) all added up to make my stay so much more pleasant than any hotel.  Highly recommended."
4100009,43212950,2015-08-18,9148553,Aizalea,"i felt very welcomed. the listing is accurate, everything i hoped for and more. "

4100009,44634115,2015-08-28,30597882,Gary,"Super clean, super comfortable. This was my first Airbnb and I can only hope they are as good as this one."
4100009,47480095,2015-09-19,1836440,Ilana,"It was an excellent Airbnb experience. The apartment is really  comfortable and actually nicer than the pictures :-)  We were 3 adults and there was plenty of room. Big bathroom with a great shower. 

Everything very tidy and clean. The host, Lara, was perfect and we communicated really well through email. Arriving to find fresh fruit, & good coffee to be made before going into town was very very nice.

The apartment is really well located, only few blocks to grocery store, restaurants and coffee. Would certainly come back on my next visit!
"
4100009,49712592,2015-10-05,27110868,Loren,Lara provided us a great place and seamless experience for our weekend in Seattle. Apartment is easy to access and in a great neighborhood. We spent a lot of time inside watching Netflix and it was perfect! Would definitely stay again. 
4100009,50124092,2015-10-09,45181572,Blayne,"This is a great place. Clean, quiet, and spacious. It has convenient access to downtown, Ballard, and the U District. And the location is especially terrific for vegans. Many Fremont restaurants, bars, and cafes have vegan menu items. The PCC and Marketime grocery stores have vegan grab and go. Mighty-O donuts is a 20 minute walk away, and Pizza Pi is a short trip away via bus."
4100009,50863561,2015-10-15,3251104,Kyle,"This is a fantastic place to stay in beautiful Fremont.  We found easy access to local bars and restaurants, with Ballard and the Woodland Park Zoo just a short walk away.  You can easily reach downtown Seattle in just a few minutes by bus or cab.  There's an express bus line just a block away, with an awesome view of Salmon Bay while you wait.

The space itself is very clean, comfortable, and quiet.  Lara is a very friendly host, and it's obvious that she cares about her guests' experience.  This was an excellent value, considering how close it was to everything we wanted to see and do.  We'll be back!"
4100009,51465805,2015-10-20,44781662,Autumn,"We loved this little apartment - it was very cozy and was in a nice, quiet neighborhood within walking distance to Fremont St, bus stops, and my best friend's apartment (who we were there to visit). Lara had local coffee, half and half, and organic bananas there for us when we arrived - very thoughtful. There was plenty of room for my husband and I and our teenage daughter. Everything was just as described, and we enjoyed our stay."
4100009,51918960,2015-10-25,33987546,Ifer,Lara's place was a wonderful stay. It was a comfortable and private space in a great neighborhood. Lara was a very helpful and kind host. The space had everything needed and more.
4100009,52625178,2015-10-31,11673768,Rick,"Lara's downstairs apartment near the Fremont district was a cozy, quiet nest for my girlfriend and I on a long weekend in Seattle. 

The location is great if you want to explore cool neighborhoods such as Fremont and Ballard and be outside the hubub of downtown. 

The place itself was very clean and had everything we needed and more. The bed was comfortable and large. The shower had plenty of hot water and there were plenty of towels. There was a full kitchen which actually we didn't use because there are so many great places to eat in Seattle.

Lara was a very thoughtful host, great with communications and made getting in and out easy.

On-street parking in residential neighborhoods can be a little challenging sometimes, but I usually found a spot right out side and at worst within two blocks.

I might look for a cool view the next time I am in the city, but Lara's place was a good value and very comfortable. 

Rick"
4100009,53683042,2015-11-11,34368836,Sandy,"Lara made our first trip to Seattle delightful.  Always quick to answer questions and offer suggestions and explain about the area.  The apartment was spotless and had many amenities and we loved the fresh flowers and tea, coffee and hot cocoa waiting for us.  The bananas and oatmeal were helpful as well as we had traveled from NH that day. "
4100009,54884351,2015-11-25,22568818,Paul,"Lara made the stay east and the flat was perfect to requirements. She very kindly provided tea and coffee and the wifi and TV made it an enjoyable and productive stay. Arriving and leaving was made easy.

I would recommend fully to anyone."
7459684,44967840,2015-08-30,19414766,Benjamin,"Charming duplex, central and walkable to many great parts of Seattle. Birgit was very communicative and friendly in meeting us to show the apartment upon arrival. I'd definitely stay again. "
7459684,45325560,2015-09-01,37097997,George,Birgit made sure the place was nice and clean before we got in. She made us feel welcomed and we loved her place. It was pretty spacious and not far from downtown Seattle. 
7459684,46971051,2015-09-14,10660533,Debbie,"The location was great for us.  It was nice to be able to walk up the street to Irwin's for coffee early in the morning.  Even though there is a bus stop within walking distance, I would recommend having a car to get around.  Don't expect any fluff, just a decent place to stay at a reasonable price."
7459684,47819701,2015-09-21,12639079,Ashley,"Checking in to the house was very easy, they left a key for me and also checked in the day before to see if I had any questions.  I am actually from the neighbourhood so I knew where I was going and what to do!  The apartment was just as they said on the listing.  I love Wallingford, not just because I grew up there!  House is walking distance to Portage Bay, a great brunch spot and Wallingford is very walkable."
7459684,48544759,2015-09-27,4052309,Jackie,"Catherine made us feel very welcome. We had some unfortunate mishaps with reservations (having nothing to do with the hosts) that the owners handled graciously. Catherine was available, accessible and helpful.

For that reason, it is difficult to give frank feedback about the accomadations. However, I feel that in the spirit of AirB&B and entrepreneurship, it is important to do so. This is my 5th AirB&B, in urban and rural areas, so I feel that I have a decent basis of comparison. I am confident that the hosts will respond in kind and this can become a great place to stay!

The good news: very clean, decent layout, safe, etc.  It is near some great restaurants and a great bike/running trail, which was nice. 
For folks looking to explore Seattle, Wallingford is not very central. That is a certainly a matter of preference, however. An argument can be made both ways: a nice, local feel vs. centrality.
The not-so-great-news: My boyfriend and I both agreed that, for the money, this place could have been nicer (or a bit less expensive). It just didn't feel very generously-appointed. We will give specific feedback to the hosts.
The bad news: The $75 cleaning fee. We have had two cleaning fees in the past ($40 each). I wasn't looking for it (my bad) and it came as an unpleasant surprise. 
Overall: I think that the demand in Seattle is very high for AirB&B. While I would not enthusiastically recommend this place, it was perfectly acceptable. Other reviewers have seemed to like it, so this might have just been our opinion, compared to other places that we have stayed. With a few tweaks (and lower cleaning fee), this could be a great place to stay."
7459684,49055872,2015-09-30,10909068,Rita,"We had a short, but very pleasant stay.  The apartment is lovely and comfortable."
7459684,49276715,2015-10-02,44956243,Sara,We had a great stay! Very comfortable and quiet. Host was very communicative and quick to respond when we had questions. Overall wonderful experience.
7459684,49642267,2015-10-05,13622315,Jess,My friends and I stayed very comfortably in this Wallingford home. One of my favorite Seattle neighborhoods. The space is big enough it did not feel cramped at all with two people in each room and one friend on the provided air mattress with a cover and sheets. Birgit was great at communicating with us and we would happily stay here again!
7459684,50022565,2015-10-08,1868054,Shahaf,"Our stay was great. Birgit's home is very comfortable. The location was convenient for us to explore Seattle by car or Uber: dumplings at Din Tai Fung, Seahawks game, Marination Station in West Seattle, Living Computer Museum, etc.  Birgit allowed us to park in the driveway which was great because street parking is tighter than I expected.

We never met Birgit but we communicated with her and her daughter Kristina by text and everything went smoothly."
7459684,51065704,2015-10-17,5357063,Richard,We had a great time at Birgit's duplex. Everything went smoothly and the place was prefect for us. We enjoyed the neighborhood and the access to downtown Seattle. The place was very clean and had all the creature comforts we needed and more.
7459684,53338483,2015-11-08,21458683,Anna,"I stayed at Birgit's for 3 weeks while visiting Seattle. The apartment was clean, spacious and in a good location ( close to Burke-Gilman trail, UW & bus connections). The kitchen was well equipped with cooking utensils etc. so the apartment is ideal for longer visits as well if you want to cook yourself and make it feel like home. Communication with Birgit was smooth before arrival and her daughter Kristina was helpful with everything I would need during my stay."
7459684,53549744,2015-11-09,28250268,Raymond,Very nice little home in excellent location
7459684,53816878,2015-11-13,4565017,Arielle,"We had a great experience here.  It was very convenient to my meetings at the University of Washington (less than 10 minutes walk) and house was stocked with everything and very clean and comfortable.  Birgin's daughter, who lives upstairs, came and checked on us to make sure we had everything we needed and made us feel welcome.  Definitely recommend Birgin's home!"
7459684,55104381,2015-11-28,28933653,Joe,"The place was just as described.  It was clean and well appointed, and we had everything we needed.  The neighborhood was very convenient to Wallingford and Seattle.  And, we appreciated the snacks!  "
7459684,55798807,2015-12-06,46891038,Andy,"Brigit was responsive and helpful, the rental was comfortable and well equipped. Great location close to the city, shops and food.  Great Value!  "
7459684,56046709,2015-12-08,3879676,Stephanie,"Clean, comfortable, and warm accommodations for a good price. Few blocks away from great food options. Also a short walk to Gasworks Park."
7459684,57203816,2015-12-23,2871906,Sameer,"I rented the place for some guests to stay for a week or so.

They had a great experience of a home away from home at Birgit’s place.  They especially loved the spacious premises. The location in Seattle is wonderful with several key places at walking distance. It is ideally located in the Wallingford area for walks by Lake Union, local coffee shops and eateries serving all possible cuisines, the University of Washington and a large shopping complex. 

Birgit is a wonderful host even from a long distance! Kristina who lives on the premises is one of the warmest people we had met. Thanks to her the check-in was very smooth and the stay enjoyable. She took care of everything my guests needed and ensured they had a memorable stay. We have promptly booked it again for other family coming to Seattle.

Thanks Birgit and Kristina. This was the best air bnb my guests had ever experienced."
4211836,21105054,2014-10-11,22051259,Anuj And Christine,"Seth & Tana are a lovely, welcoming couple.  Their home has a warm, homely atmosphere and is very clean.  The home is located close to Greenlake, which is a 10-15 min bus ride to the happening parts of Seattle (also the bus stop is a 3 min walk away).  They accommodated our later check-in at night, made sure we had settled in well, and gave us space.

Anuj spent the day working from the living room, which overlooks the front garden and the street.  He say the view was great with interesting people watching.  He counted five people who stopped by the garden and smelled the roses. 

Tana even baked some cookies!  We highly recommend staying there and hope to be back!"
4211836,22751791,2014-11-13,21948401,Rosannagh,"We had an awesome time staying with Seth and Tana in their beautiful home by Greenlake. Unfortunaltey Tana was away for the majority of our stay but we did get to meet her which was great. Seth went above and beyond to make us feel welcome and gave us great ideas of things to do in Seattle. Downtown was a bus ride away however we more enjoyed biking and exploring the local spots and neighbourhoods. We would definitely stay here again and recommend it to all, thanks again guys."
4211836,23024236,2014-11-20,2528005,Devotia,"I had a wonderful time with Seth and Tana. My flight got in late Sunday night and Seth was so welcoming, despite the late hour. Really convenient location and the room was perfect. If I weren't already moving to Greenlake, I would definitely stay again! They have AMAZING travel stories, ask them about their 7 month trip to South America and Mocha Beer :)"
4211836,38776622,2015-07-18,30934641,Courtney,"Seth and Tana were incredible hosts! They have a clean, calm house with a comfortable bed. They offered food from the fridge, homemade cookies, and were always open to chat whenever we were around. I definitely recommend the room to anyone looking for a cozy place to stay in a great Seattle location! "
5683765,45112091,2015-08-31,22415061,Michael,"The room was just like advertised and everything worked out well.  We were shown around the building by Doug and he was super nice.  The location is really great and there are a lot of great places to eat nearby.

Make sure you realize that the building requires you to sign a separate agreement, which for us required agreeing to pay some rather crazy fees if you did things like mixed the recyclables with the garbage or moved any of the furniture.  Everything turned out fine for us, but it's a little scary to sign a 19 page contract for a few day rental and it made us super paranoid while we were there."
8067053,46050760,2015-09-07,42316157,Juliane,"We didn't meet him, but he organized everything. Can't complain. Nice house."
8067053,46816543,2015-09-13,12061555,Marie,"I was looking for an affordable place in a close-in location with a comfy bed and I found it. The room was spacious, basic, and frills free. Bed was comfy. Location was residential but a quick drive downtown. I didn't meet Jared but he was nice over the phone and got me situated for check in. His dogs are lovely. "

7386675,41002456,2015-08-03,39189707,Greg,"This house was a prefect fit for my family!  Todd has a beautiful small (although felt much bigger than it was due to the layout) house near a dead end street overlooking Lake Washington and Seward Park.  The windows from the dining room had a fantastic view!  Todd has 3 young kids (so do we), and there were lots of toys in the kid's room (3 small beds) along with a train table, which made my kids feel right at home.  Outside there is a wooden play house/fort on the side yard, chicken coop with swing attached, and vegetable planters.  The highlight for our kids was probably the ramp that rolled a ride on top car down the hill in the back yard.  They probably did that 100 times each.  :)  There is no TV, but none of us really realized it, we were too busy planning our next outing, and the kids were too busy playing.  We were there over SeaFair weekend, and the location couldn't have been much better.  We could see the airshow going on out the front window, and hear the hydroplanes.  We took a quick 5 minute walk down the stairs at the end of the street and ended up at the bike path along Lake Washington.  We didn't even get a chance to explore Seward Park, but it is right there.  All the amenities you would really need, in a nice, clean, comfortable house with great views and a safe, semi-ritzy neighborhood.  We thoroughly enjoyed our 2 nights!  Thank you Todd for letting us borrow your house! "
2584354,11382267,2014-03-31,1493546,Bonnie,"This cozy home for travelers was indeed just that-- safe, quiet, clean, and peaceful. It was the perfect space for me while I was on family business in Seattle, indeed, I almost felt like I entered a retreat or spa when I walked in that first evening.  Lisa couldn't have been more accomodating, making sure I had no trouble getting in and finding what I needed.  I recommend this for a single or couple visiting Seattle--it was my first rental with airbnb and,  because it was such a good experience, I will use it again. "
2584354,11555391,2014-04-07,13259997,Charles,It was a wonderful stay and Lisa was very accommodating and helpful.  I highly recommend her.

2584354,15258031,2014-07-06,13890290,Paulina,"Lisa's home was perfect for my parents (and their first AirBnb experience) - I rented this so they could be close to me for a week long visit - house is on quiet stretch of Howell but close enough to walk to the Madison #11 bus and the #8 which both take you downtown - and its close to Cafe Flora and a bunch of restaurants, and Arboretum (where my parents spent 4 hours walking around!). It was great to have the amenity of washer/dryer - since my parents had just returned from a cruise and the only adjustment my dad had is that there was no TV - but a computer hookup (good in my opinion - no TV on vacation!). Overall great value for the price - and Lisa was kind enough to meet with me beforehand to make sure her place would accommodate an older couple :) "
2584354,15977228,2014-07-19,15425754,Lindsay,"We stayed at Lisa's for 3 nights. Her place is exactly as described and even better than the pictures! It was very clean, and she had fresh eggs from her chickens for us! We enjoyed sitting on the little front yard patio as well. Would definitely stay again. I also suggest if it is warm checking out the nearby Madrona Beach park- great place to swim in Lake Washington!"
2584354,17554242,2014-08-14,9965038,Patrick,"Lisa was incredibly kind and accommodating and the space was really nice!  The neighborhood was very quiet, and a short drive from a couple of great restaurants and shops.  Everything was really smooth from the keyless entry system to the instructions for the various amenities.  I would highly recommend a visit to Seattle, and if you go, a stay at Lisa's!"
2584354,18783600,2014-09-01,13900114,Rowena,"We stayed at Lisa's home for two weeks while visiting our daughter from the UK  and had a very comfortable and enjoyable stay. Lisa's home has a warm, cosy atmosphere, very interesting books and chickens providing fresh eggs. What more could you want?
The location is excellent, in a very quiet neighbourhood which is convenient for easy travel downtown and nearby restaurants and parks. We were able to park our car just outside the property and also made good use of the number 8 and number 11 buses.
Lisa left very detailed information for us and the whole process of booking and communicating was smooth and hassle-free.
We had absolutely brilliant summer weather throughout our stay as well and enjoyed sitting in the front garden and talking to the neighbouring cats.
I would highly recommend Lisa's 'cozy home' to travellers to Seattle."
2584354,20053040,2014-09-22,381104,Dylan,"This was a fantastic house to stay in. Lisa was very accommodating and friendly, the neighborhood was quiet and it was easy to get around the city via nearby buses. I will definitely stay here again next time I'm in Seattle and can't recommend it enough.  "
2584354,28325834,2015-03-22,28002908,Jenne,Wonderful place to stay! The location was in a quiet neighborhood and the apartment was great! Really easy to get in with the code and within an easy driving distance to everything. Lisa left detailed information/instructions and we have no complaints!!

Very clean, ton's of cool well-traveled knick-knacks make this a place I'll stay at again when in Seattle. Thanks Lisa."
