The location is incredible, though parking can be a bit a steep on the street. A few blocks North right off Pike has some free street parking, though it can be a hike. 

Overall though this place was spot on. Comfortable and clean. There is no TV or AC, though we didn't spend enough to time in the apartment to warrant them. Would definitely recommend, particularly at this price point."

Apartment is fantastic, neighborhood is fantastic, and the host even left me with a complimentary bottle of wine! 

I loved this AirBnB and you will too!  Definitely stay with Reginald! :)"
6882518,48233573,2015-09-24,23538910,Francis,"Nice location. Apartment is simple, and equipped with the bare minimum, yet functional. Not much light though, and the photo description must be taken from the rooftop of the building: you don't have such  a view, the apartment being within the first 5th floors of the building (not giving up the exact floor of rprivacy purpose).
All thing considered, I would consider getting back there when staying in Seattle, since location is quite convenient, and price is a bargain."
6882518,48796659,2015-09-28,4925207,Alysha,"Reginalds flat in Seattle couldn't have been in a better location. We were able to walk everywhere. In less than 20 minutes you can reach Pike Place Market, the Waterfront, Seattle Aquarium, etc. We were in town for a weekend getaway and found this place to suit our needs perfectly. Reginalds friend Heather was incredibly flexible and able to meet us at any time to show us the flat and give us the keys. This flat is exactly as pictured and there were even two small bottles of red wine waiting for us to enjoy during our stay. The only cons I have are the smell of the building; the hallways had a very pungent smell. Also, being in the city I had hoped to have some sort of allotted parking space, this was not the case. Seattle is ridiculously expensive when it comes to parking as well. Overall I highly recommend this place and will keep it in mind the next time I'm in the area. "
6882518,49264802,2015-10-02,28579767,Darlene,"The apartment worked perfectly for my trip.  It's located in a quiet area and everything I needed was within walking distance including downtown, Pike Market, and the Conference Center.  The apartment was spacious and modern feeling. Reginald was great to deal with - quick to respond and accommodating with check-in/check-out times. 
"
6882518,49507300,2015-10-04,30602218,Fernando,"Apartment was very clean and had everything we needed. Location was perfect, walking distance from everything! Host was very hospitable and nice. Definitely recommend a stay here!"
6882518,51802929,2015-10-24,46265324,Aranya,"Reginald's place was great. It was in a good location. Within walking distance from all the major touristy spots. It's right near Broadway where a lot of the stores and restaurants are. Parking can be a struggle. I parked in a parking garage two streets down from His place.
It was $15 for all day but it'll only give you that option in the day time. If you're parking there in the evening, you can get 10 hours for $3. The apartment itself was nice and neat. No tv or anything but there is wifi. If you're on a mission to see what Seattle is all about, you won't need all that extra stuff. Seattle has a lot to offer...even if your visiting on the weekdays. It can get a little noisy especially since it's right near two hospitals. I didn't mind it much though. Rain or shine. Go up to the rooftop and check the view out. It's amazing! I would definitely stay at Reginald's place again. "
6882518,52262711,2015-10-27,18326179,Iris,"I stayed at Reginald's place for a weekend in October and it was a delightful experience! The location is great: a pleasant to walk in neighborhood with a bike station two blocks away. The bikes make it a breeze to get to Pike Place Market or anywhere else you want to get to (there are plenty of stations around). The apartment is very charming and specious. The kitchen is stocked with all the tools and utensils you may need -- we cooked in once to take advantage of all the seafood Seattle's fish market has to offer.
Would definitely stay again."
6882518,52643623,2015-10-31,25558105,Nina,"This is a great location for getting around the downtown area of Seattle. His friend Heather greeted us when we arrived and showed us around the apartment. Everything was clean and easy to find. The only amenity that ran low was shampoo/conditioner but that was pretty easy to get ourselves. The roof has an amazing view, and I definitely recommend going up all times of the day to get some great shots of the city. There was an odd odor in the hallway that someone else commented on, but inside the apartment was fine. Lots of kitchenware if you feel like cooking but also a lot of great places to eat around the area as well."
6882518,52998516,2015-11-03,12677959,Hugo,My host was always attentive of my needs and was aware of my arrival and return .
6882518,54402307,2015-11-19,48499576,Zach,"Our trip was great. The apartment was in an excellent location, and when we arrived there was a bottle of wine waiting for us. Reginald was very accommodating and made sure we had everything we needed, and we will definitely come back to his place when we come to Seattle. If we had any notes, I can't think of any right now. We loved it. "
6882518,54654450,2015-11-22,33183393,Deborah,"Fantastic experience.   Great apartment, great part of town, great host.  "
6882518,55254119,2015-11-29,39561305,Yifan,"Reginald's apartment has perfect location and great environment. It takes about 20 minutes walking to pike place market, and 30-40 minutes to space needle tower. If you take Uber or drive, it would be only 5-10 minutes. Also, the apartment is clean and comfortable. I must say that it's a good choice in Seattle."
6882518,56885420,2015-12-19,10088797,Jeff,"Nice, spare space convenient to downtown Seattle.  Good value."
6882518,57594062,2015-12-27,7445698,Erin Kats,"Reginald's place is very cool: Convenient location, clean apartment, and gracious host!"
936484,20742562,2014-10-05,5237976,Dana,The apartment was great! Key location and clean apartment. The roof was unbelievable and a good place to have wine and cheese and enjoy the sunset. The only con was that we were not left enough towels for 3 guests and were missing a lightbulb in one of the fixtures. After calling though they helped us out the next day.
936484,21295313,2014-10-14,10793041,Jeff,"Jordan and his group were wonderful to work with and the unit's location would be tough to beat. After some miscommunication initially, I was very pleasantly surprised by how responsive and helpful the group was. They went above and beyond to make sure our travel went off without a hitch. The apartment, while small, has a great kitchen, location, and access to a beautiful rooftop deck. Would absolutely recommend any of their properties and would come back to this one! A+"
936484,25730106,2015-01-24,21121625,Gina,"Fantastic location.  We had everything we needed - there was enough room for us 3 adults.  Lots of storage space and good, clean, modern facilities (kitchen, laundry etc). Jordan was a great host  - the place i initially wanted was not available  but jordan went to a lot of trouble to find this very suitable alternate.  Nothing wrong here -  i would highly recommend a stay."
936484,28252428,2015-03-21,26593142,Taylor,It was wonderful. I recommend using the rooftop access as it is one block from pikes market and it's right next to the entrance to the four seasons. Great access for easy taxi pick up from location. Great views rooftop. Functional kitchen which you should take advantage of with the from the market one block away. Great for a couple or single. 
936484,31622660,2015-05-07,12677652,Ashley,"Perfect location! Clean, comfortable place with easy access to basically anywhere in downtown Seattle. Plenty of space for the 2 of us, with room for more (via foldout couch). Not the cheapest, but we saved on cab rides by being in the center of everything. Would definitely stay here again!"
936484,33332283,2015-05-26,10721305,Cheewai,"Great apartment at the perfect location. Is just right beside pike place market, great view from the rooftop. The entire apartment is clean and tidy as if it is a hotel room with a nice kitchen. The only thing i didn't like is the lighting in the living room is a bit dark at night. Other than that, this is a great place to stay. "
936484,41931804,2015-08-10,14014540,Pedro,"Nicely equipped unit with everything we needed. It's a bit small for 4 people, but efficient in its use of space. It's very well located right next to Pike Market and downtown. The host always gave us all the necessary information and help to make our trip and stay go smoothly. Very recommended! "
7559939,51015122,2015-10-17,39041267,Marek,"Neil is a great host, I felt welcome and that he really cares about my stay - it was awesome. He provided everything that was in the listing and even more. The neighbourhood is calm and quiet - just lovely."
7559939,55616827,2015-12-03,257881,Yoko,"Neil was an excellent host of the very well kept house. My toddler child and I needed an emergency stay within the city for a month, and he was so quick to help us out and always made sure that we were doing well and enjoying the stay. The time flew so fast and we sure did have a comfortable stay. I didn't get to spend much time with him and his guests because I was with my boy and also kept myself pretty busy, but he saw him calmly entertaining his guests for tea in his tea room. I absolutely would recommend his house to my friends. Thanks Neil and his girlfriend for their hospitality!!"
5324459,26576204,2015-02-15,19204052,David,"The host Peggy was absolutely welcoming and friendly and we have lots to talk about.  The room is v cozy and the bathroom is neat.   The bed is more of a super single size, and would fit 2 small-built or 1  big-built person.  It's easy to reach this place even if you are not driving or choose to go city centre by bus.  Take C-Line from Seattle and change to bus 128 at Alaska Junction. A 45 min journey only.  There is also a huge array of shops, theatres in West Seattle.  The lovely waterfront overlooking Seattle is only a few minutes drive away.   Highly recommended. Thanks so much Peggy for making my virgin AirBnB stay such a pleasant experience.  "
5324459,26955067,2015-02-22,9484575,Brendon,"Peggy was a fantastic host and I truly enjoyed my stayed.  Her home is very charming and is in a quiet neighborhood in West Seattle.  There is a large park, several co-op grocery stores, and a collection of local cafes and restaurants within walking distance.  

The home is filled with Peggy's art work, flowers, and collections from her world travels.  Peggy leads a very active life and she generously welcomed me to participate in several community events.  She even let me tag along to a festive Chinese new year celebration at her friend's Alki Beach condo!

Peggy - thank you for a memorable experience and look forward to keeping in touch!

"
5324459,28261292,2015-03-21,27873510,Samantha,"Other than a mixup at the beginning involving her not hearing the doorbell/phone for a couple hours this was a great place to stay. Very cosy, good location to walk to the beach. Peggy was very nice and welcoming. "
5324459,28830388,2015-03-30,12881743,Benjamin,"Peggy is a very nice host. She made me feel welcome during my arrival and throughout my stay. Her house is in a very nice area of West Seattle, and within walking distance of shops, restaurants and bus stops. The entire space felt like a home, and was a pleasure to relax and cook in during my stay. The bedroom has enough floor space for a couple bags, but there is plenty of shelf and closet space. 

I would recommend this space to anyone who desires to stay just outside the city and desires a clean and pretty neighborhood. "
5324459,29635049,2015-04-10,11611334,Liz,Peggy made me feel welcome from the moment I walked through the door. She took her time to get to know me and explained about my lodging. The room was comfortable and having a beautiful private bathroom was the best part. The home is in a lovely neighbourhood where all of the homes are well cared for. I would come back again.
5324459,29737901,2015-04-12,3406559,Sharon,Peggy greeted us at promptly when we arrived and showed us the room and bathroom.  She showed us the shared areas of the house and invited us to use anything we might need.   Peggy made our stay a great one and we recommend her place. 
5324459,30408519,2015-04-21,11611334,Liz,Peggy was a wonderful host. She answered my questions over the phone and was very friendly welcoming me into her lovely home in a beautiful part of West Seattle
5324459,31111910,2015-05-02,18059482,Pat,"Peggy's house is in a beautiful west neighborhood and just what I needed for my visit to kids and grandkids.  You can walk to just about anything you may need or want.  Public transportation seemed readily available as well, though I had a car to get around in during my stay.  Bedroom is small, but comfortable and cozy; definitely comfortable for one--might be too cozy for two .  Private bath is a real plus.
Peggy is a lovely hostess that I did not get to know as well as I would have like due to my schedule."
5324459,31889015,2015-05-11,1269022,Robert,"Sensitive communication in a time when I was ill.
"
5324459,40426298,2015-07-31,27705598,Charles,"This was my first Airbnb stay and it was fantastic. Peggy's place is beautiful, clean, and is in a quiet neighborhood."
5324459,43753575,2015-08-22,21315192,Massimo,Great experience with an awesome hostess!!!!!!
5324459,44434640,2015-08-26,2104891,Kehau,Peggy was such a warm and friendly host. My Mom and I had such a great time staying at her conveniently located home in West Seattle. She even baked some delicious goodies for us to snack on during the second day of our trip. Lovely place to stay in a charming neighborhood!
5324459,45463035,2015-09-03,32938964,Justin,"Our stay was good overall, it was a beautiful home, the room was big enough for 2 ppl, a full bed, a dresser, a small closet area, our own bathroom which was really nice. There was a beautiful garden if you wanted to take the time to sit and drink some coffee. The house and neighborhood are really quiet. Peggy was a nice host, easy to talk to, and get ahold of. The only issue we had was trying to fit food in the fridge/freezer areas. We stayed over a week and bought a few things to try and save money but it was like playing hardcore Tetris getting food to fit, there's very little room set aside for you. The home is a bit farther from the city than we would have liked, public transportation is so unpredictable out there it's very unreliable.  It takes a couple buses to get to the city (about 1hr and half),  but once your in the main city it isn't so bad. We ended up renting a car the last couple days to get around easier and Peggy was helpful and let us park on her driveway. If we had to do it again we would gladly stay with Peggy once more, we would just be sure to rent a car next time."
5324459,45664739,2015-09-05,24779190,Marc-Andre,"Staying with Peggy was great, she was easy to reach and the place was very clean. The west seattle neighbourhood us great, everyone is very friendly and alki beach is only a few blocks away. I would stay there again. "
5324459,45933644,2015-09-07,2259011,Lenora,"We had a nice stay at Peggy's place.  The location is great - near shops, restaurants, and the beach in West Seattle. Very nice neighborhood. The bedroom is a bit small for two...maybe better for a single traveler, but it was fine for our quick trip.  The bathroom is very clean and pleasant.  A hairdryer would be useful in there, but not a major lack.  We did not use the living/kitchen areas of the home.  "
5324459,46384395,2015-09-10,38826741,Anna,"The stay at Peggy's place was awesome!  Great neighburhood with nice people and very close to the beach. The room was clean and very nice, as well as the private bathroom. Peggy herself was lovely and really easy to talk to. Everything you need for your daily life is within walking distance! A bus stop is only one block away which makes it very easy to get around."
5324459,46871608,2015-09-14,35480468,Mary,"I had a nice stay in Seattle with Peggy. It was my first time traveling by myself so far away from home, but she made me feel welcome and I was very comfortable. She's a wonderful lady, easy to talk to and respectful. The home itself is cute, in a good location, and is also a short distance from the bus stop. Seattle is an awesome city and I really enjoyed myself there. I definitely recommend this home to anyone visiting."
5324459,47986098,2015-09-22,38965612,Angela,"Peggy was a warm, welcoming and gracious host. She immediately helped us feel right at home.  Her place is very special-an artist's haven through and through.  We loved her West Seattle location-lots of good food, interesting shops and great sights  just a short drive away."
5324459,48995313,2015-09-30,17574952,Ellie,"Met Peggy when we first arrived and then she was away most of the time, but Amy was in charge. Very convenient location for visiting family in Seattle when they have no extra room for visitors.
Double bed was big enough for two people without feeling crowded.
Neighborhood felt very safe and was convenient to Admiral Way."
5324459,49972920,2015-10-08,35087621,Maxime,"Nous sommes restés 7 nuits chez Peggy. On a été bien reçu. Nous l'avons seulement vu le soir de l'arrivée car elle partait en voyage et ne revenait que le jour du départ. Le logement est très bien situé dans un quartier paisible, on s'est senti en sécurité. Situé à seulement à deux blocs des bus qui vous emmènent en centre ville ( sur California avenue ) : 2,50$ à 2,75$ selon si c'est l'heure de pointe, et sont valables quelques heures et peu importe les autres bus que vous prendrez. Autre option, une navette gratuite ( ligne 775 ) est disponible 2 blocs au nord au niveau de la station essence ) pour rejoindre le ferry ( water taxi - comptez 4,50$ par trajet ) qui rejoind le downtown. Durée : 35-45min. Le logement, en lui même, est conforme à la description. Notez que la chambre est petite et la propreté n'était pas irréprochable. Mais à ce prix là, on ne peut que le recommander. Nous avons tenus 7 jours sans difficultés !"
5324459,50274888,2015-10-11,2951744,Ben,Peggy was very warm and welcoming.  Her home is very beautiful and cosy.  We had a great time and enjoyed staying in her neighbourhood. (try the waffles at Admiral Bird).
5324459,50766467,2015-10-14,11789759,Rita,"The welcome was warm and sincere. Peggy made me feel at home and shared her home, generously. Safe parking. Room was as described so read what she says. The place is clean and is in a lovely neighborhood. Her info on getting around is flawless. And there is chocolate!"
5324459,50954041,2015-10-16,1774897,Tricia,"Peggy's place was great! Super flexible too, we were able to drop our bags off before checking in. Thank you for the nice room and lovely bath with heated floors!"
5324459,51429160,2015-10-20,35026879,Ray,"Peggy was very welcoming and a great host. The listing was very accurate and at a great location to go sightseeing. Many beautiful places were only about 15 minutes away! The neighborhood was very pretty. Seattle left a very impressive first impression visit. My fiance and I loved it so much that we even possibly thought about moving here. Seattle is very clean and cares for the environment. Traffic isn't as bad as what we've experienced here in California bay area or even worst, Los Angeles."
5324459,52830516,2015-11-02,38801365,MaryJane,"This was our first time using Airbnb, and I am soooo glad, that our first choice cancelled, and Peggy was willing to accept our reservation near the last minute. Peggy's home is beautiful, we loved the plush carpet in the room, the comfy pillows, and our private bath. The room is close to the front door for quick access, and the neighborhood is bustling with things to do, and downtown was only a few minutes away, we enjoyed our stay. Thank You Peggyy!! "
5324459,53111859,2015-11-05,27753110,Sarah,"This was my first air BnB experience and it was a great one. Peggy was so accommodating for my brother and I allowing us to use the amenities of her home. Also the location was ideal - only a few minutes walk from the bus stop that took us straight into downtown Seattle. And Peggy was very helpful in telling us how to access the public transport.
Would definitely return if I return to Seattle ! 
Thanks Peggy !! "
5324459,54306585,2015-11-18,28398242,Nathalie,"The room is really nice and cosy and as described. Peggy has a beautiful house and she's a lovely host. I had some trouble with the ferry and arrived quite late and exhausted, but Peggy made me feel comfortable and offered some tea. 
Highly recommend!"
5324459,54712838,2015-11-23,36649513,Fallon,This was a very nice place to stay. The bed was comfortable and Peggy was a great host.
5324459,54859051,2015-11-25,44925268,Evie,"Peggy is a wonderful host! After a busy day exploring Seattle, she met us at the door with homemade ice cream and wonderful hospitality. She also gave great dinner advice!

Most of our time was spent outside of her residence, but while we were there she was very quiet and courteous to our desires for extra sleep!"
5324459,55102567,2015-11-28,25338004,Alyssa,"Peggy was a warm and welcoming host. My roommate and I drove up for thanksgiving weekend. Before she knew we had plans, she invited us to stay for thanksgiving dinner. It was a short drive or bus ride away from downtown Seattle and there were lots of quaint little shops and restaurants nearby. The house itself was very comfortable, although I would probably not recommend two people stay in that room. It was a bit crowded. It would be perfect for one person. Overall, it was a great stay and I would highly recommend staying with Peggy. "
5324459,56914560,2015-12-20,22095256,Peter,Peggy was a welcoming host. The house is well placed for both the West Seattle and Downtown area. I'd stay there again if in the area. 
447488,1964828,2012-08-12,2675281,Kim,"Vaibhav's place is lovely, well-appointed, and a quiet little oasis in the bustle of Capitol Hill. The location is really ideal to experience a truly vibrant community with a varied, active nightlife. Vaibhav thoughtfully left a list of local places which we would have explored if we didn't already have plans.

I especially appreciate Vaibhav's willingness to accommodate our last minute request, and given that we've been having some really hot summer weather (and most Seattle homes lack air conditioning), I really loved having a fan in the room that helped us stay cool - I thought that was a thoughtful touch.

Ordinarily we would spend time with our hosts but we were eager to get breakfast at Beth's Cafe and enjoy the gorgeous summer sun. Hopefully we'll meet next time!"
447488,1998422,2012-08-15,3197037,Jasmine,"mom & i really enjoyed staying at vaibhav's place. it was located in a safe neighbourhood with safeway(a huge supermaket), bus stops, eateries & bars just a stone throw away. the room & toilet was spacious & clean. vaibhav was even generous enough to let us stay on for another night at no charge. thanks vaibhav! would definitely recommend this place & stay here again. "
447488,2068041,2012-08-22,2384415,Fernando,Spacious and confortable room. Located in one of the coolest neighbourhoods in Seattle. This is a great place if you're looking for some privacy as it is located downstairs and has a private bathroom. Highly recommended!
447488,2127830,2012-08-28,2299224,Steven,"Vaibhav's townhouse was perfect for my first visit to Seattle. The layout is great and the space is clean, bright and modern. Despite the fact we did not meet, I was impressed with how accommodating and planful he was to ensure I had everything I needed for my long weekend in Capitol Hill. He left recommendations for parks, walks and happy hours to explore in the area. I loved having a private balcony, clean bathroom and shared use of the trendy bar/kitchen with incredible views of the city skyline. I totally recommend the place and the neighborhood! As a foodie and wine lover I was thrilled to discover Panevino on Broadway--their happy hour menu and small plates were some of the best Italian I've experienced and it is only a few blocks walk from the townhouse. Would definitely love to return for another visit! Thanks again for a memorable weekend in a great city. It would not have been nearly as enjoyable to have stayed in a hotel."
447488,2194265,2012-09-04,3104639,Alex,"A really awesome location! I loved staying at Vaibhav's home. It was clean, spacious, quiet, and the location is perfect. Highly recommended."
447488,2423366,2012-09-26,1469772,Chris,"Vaibhav's place is modern, with amazing views, and is perfectly situated in the Capitol Hill neighborhood. Vaibhav and his housemate were very welcoming and even invited us to join them on the deck for some cocktails. If you like modern amenities with a view, I would definitely recommend staying with Vaibhav!"
447488,2476086,2012-10-01,3627467,Marsha,"V made our stay so simple. He is very amiable and approachable. The room and bath were spotless. We had our own balcony. The bed was very comfortable. The condo is very centrally located in a very artsy part of town. You are within walking distance of just about anaything you need. If you read up on the metropolitan transit system you don't even have to rent a car or use a taxi. The bus system is very extensive and drops you off within 2 blocks. 

He was a great guy, as well as the perfect host and his home is very lovely. We will defiinitely try to stay with him again, if a room is available. "
447488,3882644,2013-03-24,4949895,Emmanuel,"Vaibhav and Heidi, his girlfriend, make you feel like you're home. 
It was a real pleasure to stay at their place and to discover the NorthWest, Seattle (and pub run) with their nice help.

Capitol Hill is the place you want to be in while you're in Seattle. Everything is next door: galleries, theaters,shops, nightlife.

When I'll be back in Seattle, that's the place I'll stay at again. Did I speak about the patio where you can take a sunbath when Seattle is getting sunnier?

447488,4422042,2013-05-04,4191999,Josh,"Vaibhav's townhouse is beautiful and in a prime location in Capitol Hill. The room is spacious, with a large bed; and there is a private bathroom. I stayed there for almost two weeks and Vaibhav was a fantastic host; I would definitely recommend to anyone looking to stay in the area."
447488,5027658,2013-06-08,2129087,Patti,"I stayed with Vaibhav during a work trip to Seattle when all the hotels were booked up. It turned out to be a very pleasant stay & better than a hotel - the room (and bathroom) were modern and so so clean & nice. The closet was completely empty - ready for me to unpack and feel at home. Off the back deck there's a view of the Space Needle! I stayed busy with work, but I found no trouble in coming and going and having privacy."
447488,5154020,2013-06-15,2350661,Vera,"My stay with Vaibhav and Heidi was perfect. They are both extremely kind, helpful, open and interesting. Their house is quiet and clean. The location is perfect to get to downtown quickly. I will stay there again rather then in any of the hotels I do know downtown."
447488,5294548,2013-06-23,6187840,Jenny,"You get the bottom floor of a 3 floor apt. This includes a bedroom (with access to a balcony) and a restroom, with access to the laundry room 2 ft away. The bedroom was clean, had plenty of storage, a huge window above the headboard, and was right next to the apt entrance, so I never felt like I was bothering the tenants. The second floor has the living room and kitchen, which is open to share, though we didn't make much use of it. Vaibhav was there at our scheduled key-swap time, but was also available when I had to push our meeting time due to commute issues. It's right next to many bus lines that can take you anywhere in the city and is located in Cap Hill, which has tons of restaurants, cafes, boutiques, and parks to visit."
447488,5403813,2013-06-28,6916177,Barbara,I love the idea that you can stay in a neighborhood and walk to all the local restaurants.  We could even park our car within distance of the apartment with a guest pass provided by the host.
447488,5437113,2013-06-30,412935,Denise,"Beautiful, clean, felt like a nice hotel room!"
447488,5500628,2013-07-02,6968365,Alexandra,"Very nice house in a beautiful neighborhood. Easy to get to Downtown either by bus or walking. 

The room and bathroom were clean and new. As there are no more people living in the same floor you have lots of privacy.

I would definitely stay here again!"
447488,6035407,2013-07-27,4397830,Bakh,"Excellent, safe location right in Capitol Hill. Great neighborhood: bars, restaurants galore. The room on the lower floor that i stayed in had its own bathroom and balcony. I am really happy that I stayed here.

The host is a mature, friendly guy. Loved having some geeky chats with him :)"
447488,6063965,2013-07-28,145892,Linda,Vaibhav's place was a perfect location and very comfortable. We were able to walk to restaurants and take the bus into downtown Seattle. Very convenient. Vaibhav was very helpful as well in suggesting places to check out. 
447488,6443148,2013-08-12,6424316,Roanna,"Vaibhav's townhouse is in a very convenient location, with many great restaurants and bars nearby. The room itself was pretty nice, although we had some trouble getting the a/c to work."
447488,6518536,2013-08-15,448354,Kelly,Vaibhav was a very responsive host!  His condo made a perfect jumping off point for a 3-day Capital Hill adventure.  It was so easy to walk everywhere we wanted to go.  
447488,6709721,2013-08-22,7259911,Topher,Great host!. Friendly and welcoming. 
447488,6768777,2013-08-24,4248464,Nami,We had comfortable stay at Vaibhav's place. The room was in excellent condition and the bed was comfortable. We had our own bathroom which was great. Vaibhav is a very accommodating host and ensured we had everything we needed. Excellent location!
447488,6881891,2013-08-28,4911971,Madeline,"The apartment is really nice and clean. Located in the heart of Capitol Hill, really convenient access to nightlife. Overall a really pleasant experience, would highly recommend this apartment."
447488,8330737,2013-10-26,2497576,Mike,"This is a very nice place to stay- clean, comfortable and convenient! You have your own private floor with bedroom, balcony and bathroom, along with access to the washer and dryer. The location is fantastic for easy access to downtown and central areas. You can walk to downtown easily as its down hill but we found taking a cab home to be best. There is a great app for getting cabs - free download in iTunes store - called Flywheel. It works great and we used it for our entire trip. We had rented a car but we really didn't need it except for three side trips on our 2 week stay. There is a Zip Car lot about a block away from Vaibhav's place.

Vaibhav was a great and hospitable host who is very familiar with the area and was very helpful in directing us to local bars and restaurants. We would definitely stay here again!"
447488,12021618,2014-04-21,7365454,Sung Cheul,"Absolutely great place to stay. The place is very clean and well maintained. Vaibhav was fantastic host who was reachable at all times.
Id highly recommend this place.
"
447488,13433981,2014-05-27,9862909,Jennifer,"Had a WONDERFUL time at Vaibhav's place! He was a wonderful host--very responsive to our questions before we even made it to Seattle, sent us great info about the city right before our trip, and was very helpful with getting settled into the house (thanks again for showing us the lock!). The room is wonderful--very clean, modern, and certainly enough room for 2 people to sleep comfortably in the bed. You essentially get your own floor so it basically feels like you have the place to yourself. Couldn't recommend Vaibhav's place more highly--it was my first Airbnb experience, and it will be a hard one to top! Thanks again, Vaibhav!"
447488,14245427,2014-06-15,15189064,Jenny,"Vaibhav's place was perfect! I had just moved to Seattle and needed a temporary place. They had everything I needed and it was very convenient that the room/bathroom was on a separate floor as I'd often get in late in the evening. The place is in such a great location - near grocery stores, great restaurants, ample parking and close to public transportation! 

Thank you, Vaibhav and Heidi! I thoroughly enjoyed my stay and would love to stay with you again if I need to! You were such great hosts! "
447488,14375014,2014-06-17,14969194,Erin,Our stay with Vaibhav in Seattle was lovely. His space is beautiful and very clean. Thanks! 
447488,15198691,2014-07-04,10479341,Sophie,"Great location in Capitol Hill, spacious room and nice hosts !!"
447488,15402196,2014-07-08,2564761,Hass,"Very easy in, easy out with ample street parking on weekends/holidays and available guest permit at other times. Definitely a decent option vs the more expensive Capitol Hill hotels."
447488,15521239,2014-07-10,1009707,Jon Mark,Nice place in a cool neighborhood. 
447488,16735289,2014-08-01,17891667,Chelsea,The host was nice. However the room was extremely hot and the pillows were uncomfortable. The location was really the only good thing about this place. It wasn't very clean and there were still dirty glasses from the people that stayed before. In addition to hair on the sink and toilet. This place is good for one quick night but that's about it.
447488,17116717,2014-08-07,18227698,Chen,It's very great and amazing place I like your bed and comfortable Thanks a lot and I have a nice day in Seattle.
447488,17419418,2014-08-11,19537651,Andrew,"Though we never crossed paths with Vaibhav, we had an extremely pleasant and smooth stay at his home.  He communicated regularly, had very clear arrival instructions, and provided a great space.  The location is ideal, and the room and bathroom are high quality.  I would definitely stay here again! "
447488,17524849,2014-08-13,10640830,Wayne & Ellen,"Great location, very clean. We were there mid-August for two nights, and one of the nights was VERY hot. Also, the door to the patio lets in quite a bit of light due to a spotlight across the alley in back. There was a sheet we used to cover that up in the cupboard next to the door.

We'd go back again, but we'd make sure a larger fan was provided."
447488,18131845,2014-08-22,13009708,Anita,"My stay at Vaibhav's townhouse was a great experience. I had a private room and bathroom on the first floor of his townhouse with a beautiful view. Both were clean and nicely furnished. The street he lives on is beautiful and quiet, yet there was easy access to lively bars, restaurants, coffee shops and more just a few minutes away walking.

Vaibhav was a lovely host as well. He made me feel welcome, suggested places to visit in the neighborhood, and also invited me out to meet his friends on a few occasions. 

I would definitely stay again and recommend him as a host:)"
447488,19806072,2014-09-18,20982167,Xin,"We stayed at Vaibhav's house for 3 nights, and we really enjoyed. The living room was beautiful and I loved how it was decorated, especially the red sofa, pillows and the fireplace. The bedroom was on the first floor, and there was a bathroom beside it. We was in a hurry when booking the room, but Vaibhav accepted us quickly. One thing I don't understand is the cleaning fee, since no one came to clean the bedroom and the bathroom during the three days, though they were still clean after we used them. Generally, we enjoyed our time and recommend it."
447488,20469522,2014-09-29,2702026,Pamela,"My friend and I stayed at Vaibhav's place for a long weekend. The room is exactly as advertised and it was really nice that we had our own bathroom and could make use of the kitchen. The communication went very smoothly and it was no problem that we arrived around midnight. We met Vaibhav the day after arrival and he was very friendly, giving us advice on what to do. The location is very nice and in a nice neighborhood with many cafes and restaurants.
I would recommend his place to others."
447488,21546684,2014-10-19,9073335,Renee,"Pros and cons to this experience. Although we never actually saw Vaibhav, he was accessible & responsive. Pros: great neighborhood within walking distance of everything, private bath & bedroom on separate level, access to kitchen, LR, washer/dryer, balcony off bedroom w/ sliver view of Space Needle, temp. control, & lots of closet/drawer space. Cons: overpriced especially w/ cleaning fee, bathroom floor, toilet & tub not clean, no soap to wash hands after using the toilet, layers of old dust throughout the bedroom & bath, dingy bedding, a general lack of cleanliness."
447488,35600885,2015-06-20,9493611,Nancy,"Vaibhav had a wonderful and convenient place to explore downtown Seattle with or (in my case) without a car. He has provided everything you need with a private entrance, bathroom, and private patio with space needle view. From the airport take the light rail for $3 to the last stop (west lake) then take the 43 bus (in front of ROSS) to 15th street (at Safeway)., then walk down 2 blocks and make a left. You can get everything you need on 15th street or Broadway. I'm staying here again when I come back. don't miss visiting the Chiuly gardens near the space needle. Thanks again Vaihab. "
447488,35867497,2015-06-22,4080028,Stephanie,"Vaibhav is a super awesome host!  We actually didn't get a chance to meet him while we were staying here, but he gave very simple clear instructions on how to check in.  He also gave us great recommendations on places to check out and cool things going on in the city.  To my surprise, the room was actually NICER than pictured.  Which normally it's the other way around.  The room was super clean and well furnished.  Very comfy vibe.  Would definitely stay here again next time I'm in the area. :)"
447488,36614225,2015-06-29,16373393,Antonio,"Hi there, we have been like at home in Vaibhav´s place. 
He is a polite and super nice guy. 
Totally recomended!"
447488,37873502,2015-07-11,33387679,Val,Vaibhav is a very nice host! I stayed 14 days on his place and he took care of me. He gave me all the recommendations on places for visiting the city. He was very patient with my bad english. The room was nice and comfortable and the neighborhood of Capital Hill is really great.
447488,38933306,2015-07-19,38126025,Tambre,Our stay here was amazing! The location was perfect distance from many cool spots in Capitol Hill and not far from downtown either. The room was nice and the bed comfortable. I would definitely stay here again. Vaibhav was quick to respond to any questions and recommended many great bars and restaurants. This is definitely a place worth visiting! 
447488,39443335,2015-07-23,3623220,Lorenz,"Vaibhav is a very nice, quiet and helpful. The area where he lives is absolutely great. Anything you want and need is very close (supermarket, bars, restaurants). Safe place. Very nice room. I enjoyed it and will come back soon. For people who are used to sleep in shaded rooms: There are almost not shutters or curtains in the room (don't worry: nobody can have a look in the room from outside; but maybe you want to bring an eye mask with you). "
447488,40050553,2015-07-27,19535825,Maggie,"Listing was very accurate. We didn't stay for long, just one night and we left very early in the morning. Vaibhav wasn't there but he made getting in/out of the home very easy and all his instructions to do so were very descriptive and accurate. Easy place to stay if you're just looking for a place to crash while visiting Seattle."
447488,40664507,2015-08-01,9372607,Evan,Vaibhav was a wonderful host. He answered my questions promptly and went out of his way to make sure I had everything I needed. The room was clean and comfortable. I would definitely stay with him again.
447488,42574544,2015-08-14,28928896,Aaron,"Vaibhav was a great host. We enjoyed being in a cool neighborhood with plenty of bars and restaurants within walking distance.  The room was just as described and had a nice private patio. Overall, it was a great experience. Would definitely stay here again. "
447488,43290500,2015-08-18,3715651,Tristan,"Great neighborhood and location. The check-in/out was super easy. It's a cute, nicely maintained room with a separate, private bathroom."
447488,43838534,2015-08-22,23678655,Raphael,The location was really good. The bathroom was fairly clean. The room could was slightly dusty - so my allergies flared up a bit. Other than that no real complaints. Vaibhav responded promptly and made for a pleasurable stay. I would stay again when I visit Seattle next.
447488,44863451,2015-08-29,39373977,Danny,"Even though I was only staying for one night,  Vaibhav provided all the information I needed about his ABB well in advance of my check-in. He laid out everything clearly, and provided a room that has a fantastic layout, and everything I needed for my stay. I didn't check any other parts of this ABB, since I was only there for a night, and only needs to shower and sleep."
447488,48957110,2015-09-29,7664,Lecia,"The space was just right for our needs - sleeping and comfort.  We didn't get to met Vaibhav, but instructions were easy to follow and sent just before we arrived.  The location is excellent with easy access to restaurants and entertainment in Capital Hill.  It is an uphill walk from the Pike's Place area, or an easy Uber ride."
7420339,40050708,2015-07-27,10396157,David,"We enjoyed staying in Miles' lovely house very much; he was great; a conscientious and considerate host, responsive to our questions, good at anticipating possible questions and addressing them in his house instructions, etc.  He even left a bottle of wine out for us on the back porch!  And the house was quite nice -- definitely better than we expected.  The living/dining room area at the front of the house is lovely; the kitchen worked well and was well stocked; and the washer/dryer worked nicely.  There are two nice bedrooms and a nice bathroom upstairs; no problems with any of them.  There was also a third bedroom (that we didn't use) in the basement, and a full bath on the first floor.  The back yard was nice, though we didn't end up spending much time in it.  The front porch had a great porch swing, which we did enjoy repeatedly!   The house is a block from the bike path and Metro Market, a really nice upscale grocery store.  All in all, no complaints, and I expect others will also have a great time staying in Miles' house!"
7420339,41836538,2015-08-09,39051289,Chris,"The house was nice, clean and very accommodating.  Miles was a excellent host and everything was very easy. "
3449059,15785060,2014-07-15,17422599,Samantha,"Darcy was wonderful.  She was helpful, fun and kind. The atmosphere of the apartment and surrounding pioneer square was exactly what we were looking for."
3449059,16266185,2014-07-24,17652626,Marci,Apartment was great and Darcy was very helpful! Thanks!
3449059,16486464,2014-07-28,16149074,Jessa,"
The place is very cute and spacious, plus it is in a cool location. There is a club next door/under it (Trinity) which had very loud music, but with fans on at night we were not too bothered by it.
I didn't get a chance to meet Darcy or interact with her in person, but the check-in and check-out process were easy and she was responsive to emails/communication.
Plus, I loved how walkable the location was as well! It really lets you get a taste of Seattle!"
3449059,16996389,2014-08-05,17600893,Josh,"Pros
-Location, location, location.  Everything is within walking distance
-Host was fairly quick at responding to questions and very accommodating
-Cable tv/comfortable bed
-Spacious apartment/vintage decor

Cons
-""Sounds of Seattle"" loud outside noise including bar patrons/garbage trucks/seagulls/sirens/traffic
-Poor WI-FI (only worked in the bedroom...sometimes)
-Check-in and check-out were a bit of a hassle (bar staff unaware of schedule)
-Hot apartment (requires more fans)
-Cleanliness could be improved"
3449059,17376006,2014-08-11,10899964,Joe,"If you're looking for a really cool place to stay in a really cool part of Seattle this is the place. It's nicer and cheaper and better located than most hotels in the area and there's an awesome bar/restaurant downstairs and public parking right across the street. If I'm lucky enough to travel to Seattle again in the future, Darcy will be my first call.
"
3449059,17511996,2014-08-13,17404412,Lisa,It was okay. Way too hot in the apt.
3449059,17844956,2014-08-18,9794328,Lisa,"I had a great experience staying with Darcy, the check in process was very smooth and Darcy was very helpful. We were able to store our luggage in the bar while our rooms were getting ready so I appreciate that. I also loved how organised Darcy was with the rooms. 

The apartment was clean and well equipped. I only wish I could have stayed longer to utilise it more!"
3449059,18029625,2014-08-20,6093553,Jill,"Darcy was great!  Great communication with host prior to arrival.  Had a rental car before arriving, but opted to return it a day early since the apartment was so close to everything.  Took the light rail back to the airport instead of fighting the Seattle traffic."
3449059,18315775,2014-08-25,8075215,James,"The location worked out really well for us.  We took the light rail from Seattle-Tacoma airport, which was a fairly quick ride.  If you get out at Pioneer Square and take the escalator to Yesler Street, you need only 2 walk 2 blocks.  From here we could easily explore the downtown sites on foot.  The only downside is it was noisy at night.  Well into the night we could hear late night revelers and restaurant noises.  The place itself was comfortable and nicely kept.  There is no air conditioning and it was a bit warm in the evening, but that is probably only the case a few days in the year.  Check in and check out was smooth.  I recommend the place to anyone who wants to really experience being right in the center of historic Seattle and doesn't mind some noise.  You can catch the underground tour across the street, which at first seemed might be really touristy, but turned out to be an fun and interesting way to learn a little about Seattle's history."
3449059,18547713,2014-08-28,18318632,Rich,The apartment was just as described and right in historic Pioneer Square. Check-in was easy via the bar staff in Merchants Café. Everything I needed for my stay was provided and I had no issues at all with anything in the facility. It was a bit warm during my late August stay and fans were provided in the room to help circulate some air from the window. However the staff I spoke with said Darcy is considering adding A/C before next summer. The apartments are all newly done so I understand completely. If you stay here you MUST try the fried cheese curds with honey and enjoy a Pyramid Apricot Ale on tap downstairs in the bar. I will definitely stay again given the opportunity.
3449059,19074727,2014-09-06,11819487,Rebecca,"We stayed in the Historic apartment #303 for 2 nights for the Seahawks opening game  9/4/2014.  We were right in the middle of all the cool activities in the Pioneer square area and within walking distance of Century link stadium.   
The location could not have been more perfect.  Good parking across the street and later free parking on the street.  Darcy consistently responded quickly to my inquiries, (e-mails & texts).  The apartment was a good size for 3 people and served our needs quite well.  It was warm, but the fans provided, ceiling fan and open window helped make it more comfortable.  We were on the 3rd floor so climbing the stairs did get old, but it was short term.   All in all it was a very good experience and we were all very satisfied with the stay.  "
3449059,19531676,2014-09-14,14323160,John,Great spot in downtown Seattle. The room is charming with a really good feel. Check-in was very easy at the Merchant Cafe downstairs and they have fried cheese curds which are one of my favorite foods. 
3449059,20757318,2014-10-05,18263198,Trudi,Great little apartment in a historic building.  We enjoyed our stay and the place is easy walking distance to most of the cool stuff in Seattle. It was clean and comfortable and the staff downstairs was friendly and helpful.  Fun place to stay. 
3449059,20982016,2014-10-08,7274878,Lynn,"What a wonderful spot. First, I want to say that Darcy was so accommodating.  Now, I can talk about the space. It's in a historic building, but the interior has been updated while keeping the historic feel.  My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed the apartment. The bed was comfortable, the place was obviously professionally cleaned, and it had all of the amenities.  Location was perfect. Right in the heart of Pioneer Square.  Just a few blocks from the air train, which I took from the airport.  I didn't expect an elevator, so the stairs were fine for me. 

My husband ate in the cafe downstairs and said his salad was huge and the food was good. "
3449059,21205706,2014-10-13,1465908,Janet,"The description was very accurate.  The apartment is full of historic charm.  We loved how closely located to CenturyLink field we were.  We also loved the tavern downstairs.  The people were crazy friendly.  We were also located close to everything downtown, completely walkable to everything.  We will definitely stay here again."
3449059,21500922,2014-10-18,14607626,Peter,"Darcy's place was great, right near cool bars and restaurants and close enough to walk to the stadiums. Thumping bass at night from nearby club was somewhat annoying but that goes along with staying in the heart of the action. Would stay here again."
3449059,21516254,2014-10-19,20491238,Drew,"This was a really great apartment, super cute I loved all the vintage decor.  It was clean and well-kept, perfect Homebase for the weekend.  Beds were comfortable, ceiling fan was great (and necessary), kitchen and living room was cozy.  The neighborhood gets pretty sketchy at night tho, just keep your wits about you if you're out after midnight."
3449059,22010184,2014-10-27,22925341,Gabriel,"Great place, super easy! Worth the money!"
3449059,22045428,2014-10-28,1142414,LuAnne,"We loved our stay with Darcy!!!!!! The place was clean and comfortable. But, the history of the building and the way Darcy has put a personal touch into the rooms...........totally cool.
Darcy communicated well  and provided us with a parking pass ($20/day) that allowed us to spend our time walking the city. 
The location worked for us as we wanted to walk to Pike's, the sculpture garden and the rock and roll museum. The Seattle Center is 30-40 minutes walk. 
We had everything we needed in the apartment for a very comfortable stay."
3449059,22073985,2014-10-29,21622598,Tony,Wasn't given an exact address and spent 4 hours looking for the apartment in a ghetto part of town. Darcy didn't answer her phone or reply to our messages. When we did find the apartment it was quite cool.
3449059,22531767,2014-11-09,21983222,Judy,"This was our first time using AirBnB and I must say, it was a fabulous experience!  Our host, Darcy, was very attentive and promptly answered all my questions via text.  Check in and out was simple and quick.  The apartment was adorable!  We had two people statying in the room and had plenty of space.  The bed was also super comfy, so it felt like home.  There is a complete kitchen which was great in that we were able to make ourselves a nice breakfast before hitting all the sights we planned to see.  Saved us some money on restaurants!  Only con would be lots of stairs, if you have mobility issues (no elevator).  This was our first time in Seattle and at first we were a little concerned with the neighborhood, but quickly our fears disappeared.  Just use common sense.  Other reviews noted the noise from the neighboring night club, but it didn't really bother us, as we only noticed it on Saturday night.  The proximity to the stadium was incredible and an easy walk.  We also easily walked to Pike's Place Market.  If you go there, have the Mac 'n Cheese at Beechers.  It was heavenly!!   It is also just a couple of blocks from the Pioneer Station Light Rail which was a breeze getting to and from the airport.  Overall, we LOVED our stay here and would definitely stay here again!!"
3449059,22834002,2014-11-16,3505343,Sharon,"We really enjoyed staying in this apartment, as there were three of us, and one person was able to use the futon that was set up in the living room.  The neighborhood is not the most desirable, but we had absolutely no problems there and it was only a 2 block walk from the train station.  "
3449059,22974759,2014-11-18,21532847,Tyler,"Darcy's historic apartment is comfortable and pleasant stay! The location is convenient and in the heart of the city. With that, comes the harsh realities of systemic poverty. Darcy provides a great place and is very accommodating. If you're traveling by public transit you will have minimal problems. If driving, I highly recommend locating a locked or secure parking garage and not parking on the street nearby. Due to out of state plates and looking like a tourist, my car was broken into. Don't assume I ignorantly left stuff worthy of stealing. Darcy's place is recommended, but don't park on the street nearby!"
3449059,23495662,2014-12-02,16393069,Melissa,"Darcy was a lovely hostess, greeting us upon arrival and making sure we were comfortable and our room was completely prepared upon check-in. The room itself is spacious, clean, comfortable, and well stocked. I especially enjoyed the location literally 2.5 blocks from the light rail to SEA-TAC. It's right in the heart of Pioneer Square, which is one of my favorite areas - close to touristy Pike's Market, but also within easy walking distance to all the amazing restaurants in International Village (I highly recommend Jade Garden!) Our only inconvenience was the other airbnb guests staying in the unit below us. They decided to have an insanely loud 25-person party in their room starting from about 8pm Saturday night until about 4am. It was a huge nightmare as we came back to the apt early that night because I was wiped out and needed sleep. I know Darcy did her best to get them to stop (including calling the police), and apparently they did a number on the room before finally getting out of there. Those rude guests aside, I would definitely recommend this place as it seems like that group was an unfortunate one-off."
3449059,23759893,2014-12-09,17479824,Monique,The apartment was adorable. It was clean and quiet. The location was ideal. The staff were beyond helpful and friendly. They recommended great places to go. Alicia the bartender actually drove me to get my friends purse she (email hidden)ry big thanks to her for helping us out. 
3449059,23901562,2014-12-14,20339341,Calvin,"Great stay with Darcy. First AirBnB stay. Was a bit different than I was expecting, but turned out perfect. It's more like a hotel stay. The rooms are above the Merchant Cafe, so you check (email hidden), similar to if it was a hotel lobby. They give you the key to the room and take you upstairs. The place was very nice and clean.  Pretty much all the amenities you'd need.  
One call out I would say is it isn't actually a 2 bedroom. There's one bedroom and a foldable bed that's stored in the closet that you can put out in the living area. Worked perfectly fine for my buddy and I. 
Also, there is a club next door and you can hear/feel the bass during the night. Didn't bother us since we expected it. 
A nice bonus is you get a discount on food/(email hidden) below!  Would definitely recommend for anyone. "
3449059,24029694,2014-12-17,2896438,Mark,"Darcy had a nice, clean unit in a convenient downtown location "
3449059,24058050,2014-12-18,7696552,Jay,"Short version: Get here during daylight hours. Find secure parking for the night. Nice place, but the pictures are misleading.
Long version: Didn't get to meet our hostess, Darcy. The location is easy enough to find. What's not easy to find is secure parking nearby. This is not a good choice if you are not familiar with Seattle or if you'll be arriving after dark. We arrived later in the day (after dinner) and were surprised that we nearly missed the bartender at the cafe (where we were directed to pick up keys) would have been gone. He had no clue about the room and had to call someone to confirm. Got pestered by drunk customers until the bartender led us upstairs (a lot of stairs). The apartment was very cold as we walked in and very dark. The window in the living room faces an office building across the alleyway. I'm not sure where the street view picture was taken from, but it's certainly not from this apartment. The space is very clean, well decorated and full amenities. I'm sure someone could make better use of the features if we were staying longer (kitchen and laundry)."
3449059,24328233,2014-12-26,23348230,Christopher,I had a great Holiday stay in the heart of downtown Seattle. The place was clean and comfortable. I'll stay there again!
3449059,24644283,2015-01-01,17219531,Andrew,"Darcy was very sweet and even flexible with our check out time since we had a late flight and didn't want to drag our luggage all around Seattle. The room was very cute, I especially liked the exposed brick. The restaurant downstairs has amazing happy hour prices. My boyfriend and I were able to order more than we could actually eat for about $15. All in all it was a wonderful experience and we will definitely be staying with Darcy again next time we are in Seattle."
3449059,25143642,2015-01-07,24749600,Martin,"Darcy's apartment was a real slice of Seattle history, and we enjoyed our stay there. Three of us fit in comfortably with a double bed in a separate bedroom and a futon in the living room. We didn't get to meet Darcy in person, however the bar staff were friendly and showed us to the apartment on arrival.

The location right on Pioneer Square is excellent, and we could walk around central Seattle easily from the apartment."
3449059,25328233,2015-01-12,1768664,Olivia,"The apartment was perfect for My husband and I, the location is perfect for dinning, going out for drinks and just wondering around the city.  The apartment is comfortable, super clean and the perfect size. The people (email hidden) are super friendly. 
"
3449059,25537760,2015-01-19,22085031,Taryn,Great location. Great apartment. Definitely gives you the feel of being in a city. Would love to stay here again. 
3449059,25712459,2015-01-24,4359003,Laura,"We enjoyed our stay. Darcy's appartment is above Merchant's cafe which has pretty good appetizers. The appartment itself was tidy and comfortable to stay in for 3 people. The TV was a plus to use at the end of our outings. The only downside was the location. At night, the homeless are more aggressive at night when asking for money, especially the ones outside 7-eleven nearby."
3449059,25765667,2015-01-25,23215120,Corina,"What a great staycation!  We only live about 20 minutes away from Seattle but love to visit the city often.   
This was our first Airbnb experience and we were NOT disappointed. The apartment was walking distance to a lot of the city. And only a $5 Über ride to everywhere you want to go. 

We got there right at 2pm checkin time but our room wasn't quite ready. Darcy was a gracious host and upgraded us to a more expensive room free. We really appreciated that as our place was a corner room looking out over pioneer square. 

After we got situated we visited the cafe downstairs for a wonderful snack of fried cheese curds and yummy sliders. 
It was great to experience Seattle as if we lived there.  Thank you Darcy!  We will be back. "
3449059,26166428,2015-02-05,11131196,Jennifer,The place is beautiful and with just enough finishing touches to remind you of it's history.  Very well kept and lovely to spend time in - I'd recommend for sure!
3449059,26455519,2015-02-13,26337451,Joe,"Before even getting to the room above Merchant's Cafe, Darcy was very helpful and timely with providing answers to questions. The room was well kept and rather nice for an older building. Location was very convenient downtown however parking was tricky at times and the amount of homeless individuals in the area could be overwhelming at times. Very fair advertisement of the room, location and the stairs! Would gladly visit again. "
3449059,26493776,2015-02-14,26600096,Cassie,"We enjoyed our quick stay. It was close to everything we wanted to see and a short walk to the train station in the morning. The bar down stairs was nice for a late night snack. Our flight got in earlier than the bar opens so we waited with a coffee at the Starbucks next door. Cute decor, comfy bed!  Everything we could need. Thanks for the stay!"
3449059,27531325,2015-03-07,25484717,Lykke,Cool location - a bit dark but very clean. Easy checking in and out.
3449059,28297655,2015-03-22,2925647,Jeffrey,"What a fabulous weekend we had!!! First, we were able to park right next to the condo using the parking pass for a small fee which was great knowing my car was safe & a lot less than paying street parking. Second, we got to meet Darcy who was lovely. She showed us our condo and was a gracious host. Third, her staff were great! We enjoyed visiting and having drinks in the bar down stairs, plus the bonus discount was a treat! Our condo was perfect and had everything we needed: a well stocked kitchen, washer/dryer. Seriously, next time we are in town for a game or just need a little get away, we will be staying here!!!"
3449059,28545943,2015-03-25,2921245,Colten,"Check-in was easy, just had to wait around til the 2pm check-in time, but since you get to wait in a nice restaurant that's not such a big deal. It's a very cool location, and during my stay I walked to lots of great places downtown. Having the bright marquee of ""Merchant's Cafe"" to walk back to made it easy to find while wandering around. The apartment itself is very cute, exactly what I expected from the pictures. "
3449059,29023836,2015-04-02,27450730,Steve,"I was in Seattle for business the week of March 30th. This was my first time in the city and wanted to stay close to the Pike Place market and great restaurants.  This location was perfect from a touring perspective, however as can be expected, there was a lot of street noise in the evenings. Also, the homeless are everywhere and comfortable asking for money. I personally do not have an issue with this, but be prepared if you are in this area. Parking can be a bit of a challenge, so ask the host about a parking pass for your stay.  $20 per day is deal considering most places are $15 during the day and don't offer overnight parking."
3449059,29118414,2015-04-04,22567452,Jeff,"A very neat, historic place to stay. The unit had everything we needed and was a convenient launching spot for exploring the city. The staff at Merchants was super accommodating when we arrived shortly before closing due to a flight delay. They helped carry our bags when showing us to the unit and even put in a last minute food order for us. We would definitely recommend to anyone who is looking for a clean, fun place to stay in Seattle. "
3449059,29510767,2015-04-08,10055585,Andy,We only stayed there one night. Great place to stay for 4 with the extra futon. Awesome location and a quick Lyft ride to anywhere you want to go in Seattle.
3449059,29668210,2015-04-11,9953016,Matthew,"We enjoyed our stay at Darcy's place. The check in was a breeze. We grab our key from the bartender downstairs. He was very kind and offered to carry some luggage for us to the 3rd floor. The apartment was very nice. The only downside to the stay was the noise outside. This is to be expected though when you stay downtown. A lot of early morning trash trucks in the alley, random people, and birds. The club music next door can be heard through the walls too. We did split the room, so my experience comes from sleeping in the living room on the pullout bed. Whereas the other couple we traveled with said most of the noise was muffled or rarely heard in the bedroom. We had a great stay though as the noise is tolerable. Again, it comes with the location. The check out process was really easy and everyone was very accommodating. Our flight was in the evening, but we were allowed to leave our luggage in the bar after check out and stroll the city. Terrific cafes and shops all around. I would recommend this place! "
3449059,30426678,2015-04-21,31229990,James,"Had a very good experience at the historic apartment. Started with a very friendly and helpful bartender at Merchants who let me in the property. 303 is at the top of the building , so requires a couple flights of stairs. The room itself was quiet (in an active neighborhood) and comfortable, if a touch dim. The location was great for access to the waterfront and the rest of downtown Seattle. Walked for hours around the neighborhood, which is equal parts historic, fun and gritty. "
3449059,30767648,2015-04-27,27892566,Coleman,"Great overall experience! The space was exactly as described. We were able to easily walk to the stadiums, Pikes Place and the ferry terminal. It was a quick ride from Sea-Tac Airport on the light rail. Would highly recommend for anyone looking to experience Seattle for the first time!"
3449059,31018051,2015-04-30,23384189,Tianhe,The apartment is nice and comfortable and the host was very helpful! Recommended!
3449059,32041030,2015-05-12,33003462,Cathy,"Lovely historic neighborhood and building. Apartment is clean and comfortable. Good location for access to waterfront, market, shopping and parking. "
3449059,32309737,2015-05-17,13003929,Alicia,We actually didn't end up staying in apartment 303 we stayed in 203 since 303 was given to another guest by mistake. Not a big deal 203 was really nice.  The location was perfect and only a 10 minuet walk from the train station/stadiums. I loved the old building with the brick walls. The neighborhood has a lot of homeless people which is hard to avoid in any downtown area. Just be prepared to get asked for change a lot. We would definitely stay here again on our next trip to Seattle. 
3449059,32507141,2015-05-19,29317777,Jane,"While the location of this place is great, we had lots of difficulties with the hostess. I don’t know how many of these troubles stemmed from misunderstandings between us, but Darcy’s slow response time and hostile attitude was off-putting, to say the least. 

I had given Darcy our time of arrival, but we had to wait at least fifty minutes for her to come and open the door for us. When we finally got into the apartment, the WIFI was so weak that it was unusable from the flat. We had to sit on the stairwell or go downstairs to the bar in order to access the internet. We complained to the bartender downstairs but were informed that there was nothing that could be done. The only response Darcy gave us regarding this issue was that she was certain that we were incorrectly inputing the password, which was clearly not the case. 

Then, we discovered that there was no hot water! We complained again, but the employees downstairs were understandably busy. They called Darcy but were not able to reach her. Later on, the hot water came back intermittently. There was only enough for one person to shower at a time. We were offered another apartment, but it had poor ventilation and was smaller than the one we had booked, and there was no guarantee that the hot water situation would be better in this other apartment, so we declined. While sorting out all of this, the bartender spoke to us in the corridor, causing some noise, and another guest complained. We apologised and went back to our apartment. 

After this, Darcy began sending aggressive messages to us, deploring us as the “worst guests ever” and threatening to call Airbnb security. In addition, she oh-so-helpfully reminded us that we would be fined if we “trash” the apartment. Last of all, she asked us to leave a day earlier than we had planned. 

We did so. I don’t know if she was having a bad day, but I don't think my concerns and requests were unreasonable. While I am sorry for causing unnecessary noise that evening, that only happened because the bartender was trying to sort our situation out, and we did not deserve Darcy’s vitriol. "
3449059,33060796,2015-05-25,14458173,Helen,"No sign of the host but an employee looked after us.
The location was good, and we could indeed walk to the major attractions of the city.
The apartment was for two couples but one couple was on a fold down bed blocking the way to the bathroom.
Because the bed would not even unfold we removed the mattress and put it on the floor of the living room for the other couple.
Not convinced that it was good value for the money."
3449059,34071466,2015-06-04,20239138,Ginger,"We did not meet Darcy in person, but picked up the key from Merchants Cafe. Tony was very nice and helpful to anything we needed. 
The apartment was clean, up two flights of stairs, and very historic feeling. In the pictures it shows a view of Pioneer square. This is inaccurate, this apartment has a view of the ally/office building. There were some hidden gems within the block. Julie's Garden, cheap Chinese/Vietnamese food. Comedy Underground, cheap entry fee and the local comedy was hilarious!

Pros: Great location, washer/dryer, secure entrance, mini fridge, HD TV, queen size bed, coffee shop two doors down.

Cons: Internet is TERRIBLY slow, noisy (it's in the city, so just expect it), 7am garbage truck wake up call every morning, homeless in this area are verbally aggressive (we found acknowledging them is much better than ignoring them)"
3449059,34138205,2015-06-05,32226831,Rebecca,"This was a great place to stay while sightseeing in Seattle. The location was close to many attractions, and we were able to easily find a spot to park on the street overnight. Check-in with the bartender downstairs was quick and easy. The apartment was spacious, and while there is a kitchen and washer/dryer, we didn't need them during our one-night stay. There was some noise that came in through the window from the street below, but it wasn't a problem at night with the bedroom door closed. Recommended!"
3449059,35446303,2015-06-19,25613490,Radika,"We really enjoyed Darcy's 303 apartment on Yesler way in Seattle. it was located central to all the attractions that i wanted to show my parents. 
As for the host: we encountered an issue during checking in- since the bartender could not find the key to #303. Darcy was out of town. So we spend about 1 .5 hr at the Merchant cafe and finally the bartender arranged us to stay the night in the close by Marriot hotel- and gave us a round of drinks and offered food on the house. Also we got a nice bay view room at the mar riot of the night. Darcy and her bartenders were quick to communicate through all this and the next day they got us the 303 apt and Darcy gave us a complimentary fruit basket. 
Even though we had an issue, they resolved it as well as any one could and was quick to make sure that they did their best to make us comfortable. We stayed there for 7 days altogether- and quickly settled into the beautiful apartment. I would certainly recommend this spot- and i will stay there again. I know that even if some unexpected thing happens the host would take care of it!"
3449059,35808463,2015-06-22,13925916,Melody,"The apartment was great - One room had a kitchen with a 4 person peninsula and a loveseat with a couple comfortable chairs...and a big flatscreen. The other room had a very comfortable bed. No AC, but the fans and open windows cooled it down comfortably. It's clearly a vacation rental - not someone's personal apartment. The windows look into the alley - and there was typical city noise. It was an easy 10-15 minute walk to Pike's place in one direction, and the stadium in the other. Homeless in the area are plentiful and can get a bit aggressive, but it is the city. We parked on the street at night and in the garage across the street during the day and just walked everywhere. The Merchant's cafe downstairs was a nice perk - and they have a great happy hour. We have plans to come back! "
3449059,36564593,2015-06-29,19194822,Emma,"The room was very nice with a perfect location to downtown! Would stay there again. It was hard to contact the host and the place could of been cleaner, but other than that good stay."
3449059,37165308,2015-07-05,33244046,Kate,"We did not meet Darcy. We stayed one night. We checked in with the bartender at 2pm., and he went looking for the key. He found it upstairs with the housekeeper who wasn't done cleaning until close to 40 minutes later. We stayed in #303, and it is beautiful brick and wood, as in the photos. It could use some general upkeep and a deeper cleaning, such as fixing the toilet so it doesn't wobble or cleaning dust balls off the ceiling fan and ceiling--but it was clean enough and fine for a night. We happened to be there during a heat wave, and so we were glad there was a portable air conditioner in the apartment. The second bed is an air mattress, and we needed to move some furniture in the living room to get it set up. The hall light shines in over the door, which makes sleeping in the living room less than ideal. There were some street sounds, as other reviews have mentioned, but the air conditioner was nice for white noise. The bedroom was comfortable. I guess I'd recommend this apartment for 2 people rather than the 4 it can sleep. When making coffee the next morning, we found that the housekeeper had overlooked cleaning the maker/pot. We could walk around town really easily from this location, and we took the lightrail to the airport--it was a cinch. Many homeless asking for money--just as other reviews say. Some cool shops in the area, and we found a great restaurant 10-minute walk north--I can't remember the name, but they served sourdough pizzas and many types of drinks. "
3449059,37544239,2015-07-08,23260215,Katherine,"Great place and location!  Only downsides was parking was difficult and expensive (but that is everywhere in Seattle) and it was warm at night in bedroom. Living room has window unit but it doesn't reach bedroom well. On behalf of host, it was unusually hot for Seattle during our stay. "
3449059,37957669,2015-07-12,30849887,Kevin,"(email hidden) downstairs were very helpful and friendly. The 2nd bed  (which is actually an air mattress) is surprisingly not horrible. More than enough towels provided. Neighborhood is close to plenty of things to do.

Only minor complaint is that the wifi is not the most reliable."
3449059,38197006,2015-07-13,10974854,Everett,"A very interesting location above a landmark pub. Lots of pan handlers from the park across the street. Close to everything. Updated appliances, easy checking in and out,  secure building."
3449059,38376108,2015-07-15,15955093,Stephen,The space was decent and the neighborhood was good.  Alot within walking distance.  The air conditioning left alot to be desired
3449059,38599072,2015-07-17,33048936,Stephanie,"It was a great place to stay. The steps up to the apartment are pretty steep, so make sure you are up for it. She did have a plug in air conditioner for us, but the bedroom was still a little hot. I think it is usually much cooler in Seattle, so it shouldn't be a problem most of the year. The apartment was very clean and bright. The neighborhood was great. We were only a $10 cab ride from the Space Needle, so it is very well situated. There are two parking garages right across the street for overnight parking. "
3449059,38818117,2015-07-19,377563,Christine,Efficient communication and cozy apartment! We especially appreciated the easy access to the airbed and extra linens.
3449059,39222339,2015-07-21,37954838,Christina,"description was right on point - adorable historic apartment with a super-easy check in process through the cafe downstairs. the location was very walkable to pike's place / downtown, with a lot of cute shops/eateries nearby. 

I couldn't find street parking readily available (and did not want to feed the meter), but the parking garage, although pricey, could not be any closer. It was perfect for our stay in Seattle. "
3449059,40703954,2015-08-02,254356,Shirley,"Delighted with our stay st Darcy's!  Check in super easy - apartment had everything we needed including washing machine! Beds super comfy - very important after long flight! But best of all was the location! Great bars and restaurants and lots of life,  enjoyed our stay so much we're going back again in two weeks!"
3449059,41995613,2015-08-10,22635955,Andrew,"Everything was as advertised, no issues. Cool historic building and neighborhood."
3449059,43023720,2015-08-17,30075500,Nathan,Fantastic experience as my first Airbnb. Darcy and the cafe staff were great and very helpful. The place was just as described and pictured. The place was conveniently located and everything we could need was provided in the room. 
3449059,43611069,2015-08-21,12066532,Heidi,"I would not recommend staying here.
The apartment is nice enough, but has a dingy feeling to it. Not as nice as the pictures make it seem. We never met the host, just received a key from the bartender of the bar below. That was the only interaction we had with anyone related to the apartment. When we got in to the apartment the bedding was still in the washer and dryer, so we had to finish doing the laundry before we could use the beds. We were told to park in the parking garage across the street for the night. Do NOT park there! Our car was broken into that night, the window smashed,and many things stolen out of it. I messaged the host to let her know and she never replied to my message. If you're looking for a nice place in Seattle, do not choose this one. "
3449059,44111757,2015-08-24,34387183,Alba,"Although we did not met Darcy, her instructions were very clear and the staff at Merchants cafe (the oldest restaurant in Seattle!) was super kind and helpful. They even let us keep our luggage on the bar all day while we explore the city. One of the problems is that the apartment was listed as it has 2 beds. The second ""bed"" is actually an air mattress (which was comfortable, though). I think this information should be mentioned in the apartment description. The apartment is not very well insulated from external noise (garbage collecting, and a nearby factory that runs all night). It was difficult to sleep on the living room. The apartment is very nice and well located, it is ideal for 2 people but not for 4 people. Also when we arrived some of the sheets and towels were still on the washing machine and wet. The area, Pioneer Sq, is really cool, tons of nice restaurants and cafes (Gran Central, 2 blocks away) and you can easily walk everywhere, but also lots of homeless, it can be a bit scary at night if you go alone. It is also conveniently located 1min away from the tram that goes to the airport. But very difficult to park your car (unless you pay for the parking lot). "
3449059,45052199,2015-08-31,26370737,Steven,"We didn't meet Darcy however, Justin the barman of the Merchants Cafe, looked after our luggage until checkin time. The Apartment is ideally located in a vibrant area providing easy access to the city by foot and bus. The King Street train station is only a short walk away; this was useful to us as we took Amtrak from Vancouver. There are a good selection of nearby restaurants in the Pioneer Square  area and the Apartment reflected the era of construction, having just one window, however it suited us well. Even the blow up bed was self inflating & comfortable. The vibrant location meant it wasn't the too quiet however this wasn't a problem & one of the highlights was letting Justin conjure up a cocktail in the bar. If you want to visit Seattle Apartment 303 is a good choice. "
3449059,45233241,2015-09-01,11704915,Marc,"We found Darcy's appartment very stylish. Location and description of it was perfect for one night stay. Check-in and check-out in 1st floor's café was very convenient for late arrival. The appartment was clean and offered everything one could need for a city trip. The somewhat ""interesting"" neighbourhood in Downtown Seattle (especially at night) does not disturb once you close the appartment door."
3449059,45573562,2015-09-04,38705704,Paul,"Great location ... neighborhood has many fun pubs and restaurants,
Light rail and bus route is within a couple of blocks. All the major attractions are within walking distance. The room is exactly as pictured.  We were a party of four, one couple used the bedroom and the other had a blowup mattress in the living room. The room and neighborhood is best suited for the young. Darcy and her staff were excellent in taking care of our needs and providing us with info on how best to enjoy our time in Seattle. We would go back."
3449059,46364324,2015-09-10,14023136,Anne,Darcy was extremely helpful. The apartment is clean and tidy and steeped in history!  I accidentally left my jacket downstairs and Darcy made sure I had it back before I left.  Just beware that there are a few older style stairs to the apartment.  thanks Darcy
3449059,46582529,2015-09-12,35286083,Jon,"A nice place to stay with an even better restaurant on the ground floor.  Darcy was courteous and quick to respond, as well as had someone check the room after it was thought that something was left behind;  interactions were very business like."
3449059,46877113,2015-09-14,11207897,Stephanie,"Easy booking, great location, above a bar, but not noisy. It did get hot upstairs, but Darcy had a fan in the bedroom and it did a fine job of cooling it down.  Plenty of towels and kitchen amenities."
3449059,47125833,2015-09-15,6437803,Stacey,"Everything was easy and this is a downtown gem, near Seattle Underground tours. Great dining on 1st, and typical urban streetscene as noted in other reviews. Key pick up was easy and I could always get help if needed.
Simple stay, would recommend to others."
3449059,47205845,2015-09-16,10442212,Charlie,"Darcy was a great host, fast response times, lovely apartment in a great location."
3449059,47247518,2015-09-17,29670997,Steve,"All went well ...we arrived early from Vancouver so dropped our (email hidden)/cafe downstairs and walked to pike market for lunch.
We were on the 3 rd floor so the stairs were only an issue because Liz managed to load two tons of luggage into 1 bag.  She repeated this amazing feat yet again for bag number 2.
I thought by not buying another bag it may curb and limit the shopping.  
Oh how wrong I was.  Lol
The apartment was a good size and very clean.
Great location easy walk to pike street and even closer to central rail station when we arrived from Vancouver.

Thanks for hosting us.
 Steve and Liz."
3449059,49892305,2015-10-07,21983222,Judy,"This is our second time staying at Darcy's place and we enjoyed it even more the second time.  The check in/check out process is simple and the room is centrally located to everything we wanted to see in Seattle.  If going to the stadium, you can't get a better location as the stadium is literally just a few blocks away.  The room is clean and we appreciated the fact that there is a full kitchen so we could make breakfast before we set out for our day.  We highly recommend Darcy's place!"
3449059,50957165,2015-10-16,44629105,Lindsay,"We never met Darcy however the apartment is pretty much as described except the couch didn't pull out. What isn't described is the slightly spooky atmosphere of the hallways complete with Victorian era pictures/paintings. Definitely feels a bit haunted but after reading the history of the Merchants Saloon it seems the ghosties tend to stay downstairs. The bartender was kind and recommended we park in the Butler garage a street over instead of the one in front of the actual building.  The three flight walk up is a bit difficult with luggage but manageable. At night the area definitely had a large homeless population in the park across the way however we felt pretty safe walking to the piers and back after dark.  Overall, interesting building and history and decent place to stay for a couple nights in Seattle "
3449059,51129250,2015-10-18,24625132,Michael,The apartment was as advertised. A beautiful old apartment in a really central location. The one issue we had was that the second bed (futon) was broken and needed to be reinflated several times during the night to keep it from sinking. This meant only one working bed in the apartment. The staff in the bar below were great. 
3449059,51712143,2015-10-24,2929661,Debbie,"We were in Seattle to attend the Women’s Soccer Victory Tour and wanted a place close to the Amtrak Station and CenturyLink Field. First, keep in mind this is an old historic building/apartment with only stair access which was not an issue for us. We were in apartment 303 on the third floor. The positive aspects of this apartment: LOCATION- it is perfect if you are attending an event at CenturyLink field and/or taking Amtrak; there are many good restaurants in the area so you do not have to venture out of the area for a meal; transit (bus) stops are close by to get you to any other part of the city. Also, it is not too far a walk to Pike Market. APARTMENT- the apartment was very clean with a comfortable bed, largeTV, internet with cable and comfortable furniture. When we got there the internet connection kept crashing and Darcy quickly responded to my text message and had me go downstairs and have the cafe staff reset the unit and we had no problems after that. If you arrive before check in or are leaving town after check out you can leave your bags in the Merchant’s Cafe and Saloon until you need them; this is very convenient. The people who help you with any apartment issues in the Cafe were super friendly and very welcoming. Some aspects of the apartment that were less desirable for us: 1) there is only one window in the living area that opens into the busy alley below. Since we like fresh air, we kept it open and heard the pulse of the city very clearly day and night. 2) since the bedroom did not have a window, we kept the bedroom door open which let in the light from the hallway into the room (there is a bright light outside the apartment door [for safety] and a window above the door into the apartment and a window into the bedroom) so the room was never really dark. 3) there was no hair dryer or microwave 4) we kind of felt like unexpected guests as there were two ladders leaning along the wall and railing leading to our apartment and vacuum cleaners behind a chair outside the apartment. Also there were sheets still in the dryer and the dresser was filled with sheets so you could not use it if you wanted to. This was just a little tacky. I was a little disappointed when I emailed Darcy prior to our arrival (as Airbnb recommends) to give her our arrival plans and I got no response. Perhaps a text message would have been a better communication option. Overall, we had a great time in Seattle and this place met our needs for this particular trip. One thing I wish I would have done prior to staying here is spent some time reading the Merchant’s history—it is really fascinating and I would have explored inside the Cafe to appreciate the history. However, when..."
3449059,52346127,2015-10-28,23925359,Aj,"Loved this historic old apartment with modern convenience. .
There were stairs getting in, which was ok for us. We drove right off the ferry and straight in front of the apartment.  It was great, we used the blow up mattress for the second bed. 
Great old apartment with brick walls, nice colors, amazing location. 
It really made Seattle feel magical .. 
And though we never met Darcy, the unit was easy to access abd she worked with us in the days as we were one day behind due to our family catching the flu during our road trip 
Would recommend  and we would stay there again 
 "
3449059,52748707,2015-11-01,11480648,Natalie,"Darcy welcomed us in person and showed us another suite in addition to the one we'd reserved the night, to give us more choice (though we chose to stick with 303). Merchants bar below is a gem. I've stayed in different apartments in the building before and have always had a great stay. I'll be back! "
3449059,53359117,2015-11-08,45453805,Andy,Cool building and room. Great location for walking to almost everyplace in the southern part of (website hidden) downstairs was cool.
3449059,53798857,2015-11-12,23754186,Crystal,Darcy's place above the merchants cafe was a gorgeous stay. Everything was so close to the hotel. Literally walking distance! The original character in the house was beautiful and so cozy. 
3449059,53869967,2015-11-13,48267054,Marcel,Exactly as advertised. Helpful staff. There are a lot of homeless people in the area but definitely feel safe and at home in the room! Would stay here again.
3449059,53935404,2015-11-14,48547497,Daehung,"Really good place to stay. 
They have got everything; convenient location, facilities, wonderful hosts and affordable price.
Room was cozy and spacious."
3449059,55340672,2015-12-01,17527298,Chris,"We had a great time staying here. The historic apartment was as described.  I am a social studies teacher so I loved the historic room, historic bar, and historic district. The place was clean.  The bar Merchants Cafe was a great place to eat and drink.  The male bartender was fun and very helpful! The local/regional beers on tap was a plus and the food was great!   I would recommend this place and I would stay there again!"
3449059,55680656,2015-12-04,23755469,Dakota,Very cool location not to far from pike place and century link field

4288801,23339570,2014-11-29,522363,Eric,"Claire has a beautiful home about two miles north of the University of Washington.  I stayed here for several weeks - both in the first-level bedroom and in the lower-level suite - during my first term of graduate school here.

The house is quiet and well-kept.  The beds in both the rooms are great.  I really enjoyed Claire's company when we're both around at the same time.  The house is large enough that your have sufficient privacy in either room.

Ravenna is a quiet neighborhood of middle-class, nice homes, with views of the Olympics to the west and of the Cascades to the east.  The 72 and 73 buslines, which run to UW and downtown, are a block over.  The commercial hub, the Roosevelt Square area, is a 10-15 minute walk to the southwest, and has a Whole Foods as well as some restaurants and cafes.  
"
4288801,31641885,2015-05-08,29659763,Libin,"Great experience overall. Claire is very nice and will try her best to accommodate your needs. You can get plenty of privacy if you want to be private, but you can also socialize with your roommate and Claire if you choose to. You can do laundry using Claire's washer and dryer if you don't mind non-scented detergent. Plenty of parking on the street. Convenient commute to UW via bus 68, 72, or 73."
4288801,32411123,2015-05-17,9824255,Noemi,We had a wonderful stay at Claire's house. The apartment is located in a nice residential neighborhood and well-connected to city centre and UW. Claire was an amazing and very helpful host. We would highly recommend staying with Claire!
4288801,32945980,2015-05-23,2470188,Tracy,Claire was a nice and accommodating host. Her downstairs bedroom was clean and quiet. We had a separate bathroom. It's a five minute walk to multiple bus routes in a safe suburban area north of the university district.
4288801,43682109,2015-08-21,40499712,Patricia,"Claire is friendly and easy to communicate with. She does a great job keeping her place clean. The private rooms are as described and she has a lovely home. Parking the car right by her house for free was a huge bonus, as was feeling comfortable with the neighborhood.  "
4288801,56906659,2015-12-20,1445341,Vlad,The place is  a great location and the house is in excellent condition. It's pretty quiet but not too far from fun things like UDistrict which is a walkable distance. There is also a lot of space in the living room Every part of my stay was very smooth. I stayed with Claire for 4 months and the whole experience was great. Claire is not only a great host but also very nice to live with.

8446766,54107085,2015-11-16,44613982,Joel,"Tad was great! Very quick to respond, and very accommodating. The place was updated, and stocked with everything I needed. It was also very convenient location to reach all West Seattle had to offer, and not too far from downtown and the airport. Overall a really positive experience, and I would happily stay here again on future trips to Seattle."
3238295,15236653,2014-07-05,2315832,Abbie,"This place is ***amazing***! We had an extremely pleasant, comfortable and easy stay in this beautifully appointed, fully equipped basement apartment. Samim and Aleksandra are considerate and thoughtful hosts, who go above and beyond to make you welcome and provide everything you could need, from tableware and pots and pans and kitchen tools, to high-end toiletries. And a bag of Starbucks coffee for the coffeemaker! And a box of chocolates! 

You even get to use the peaceful haven of the back yard covered patio, with its own gas fireplace! Samim and Aleksandra have amazing taste, and everything here is high quality. I want this kitchen! And you get a real washer and dryer inside the bathroom, too. And convenient outlets everywhere for your devices. Oh, and did I mention the heated bamboo floors??

The location is great for getting around Seattle, whether you're walking, biking, busing, or driving. The neighborhood is wonderfully walkable, with an array of fantastic restaurants and shops as well as Ken's Market for groceries and gourmet deli goodies. If you have a car, there is ample street parking within steps of the door.

If you have mobility issues, you do need to know about the steps up to the ground level of the house from the sidewalk, and the few steps back down to the entrance of the apartment. This was no problem for us. We also really appreciated the ""just right"" firmness of the bed and sofa (we prefer firm). Oh, and the sofa has a pull-out bed! We didn't need it, but it's a nice touch.

We were in town for a job interview for me, and to visit family and friends--and go to Pride! We stayed for a week, and wished we could stay longer. Samim and Aleksandra are absolutely lovely, and we were sooo comfortable in this light-filled, private haven. It is so nice to have all the comforts and independence of home when you are traveling. Little things like a full-sized closet and a real refrigerator (a really nice refrigerator!!) make such a difference. Thank you, Samim and Aleksandra! We hope to visit you again."
3238295,15517071,2014-07-10,16718796,Jon,"Our stay at Samim's apartment was fantastic. It's a lovely, bright and comfortable space with modern/new amentities and materials. The hosts have excellent taste! The space is gorgeous. The air conditioning, washer/dryer and dishwasher felt like luxuries! 

There is loads of space and you can really feel at-home here. Samim was very friendly and had a professional touch with a nice binder of information about the place (including brochures for the area). They also had a fully-stocked kitchen (including coffee grinds, filters, tea, dish soap, etc). They had all the little detailed items as well as all the major things like dishes, cookware, towels, etc.

The neighborhood has ample on-street parking and it's a quiet, pretty street. This airbnb was used as we waited to move into an apartment. I would definitely suggest this specific place to friends and family who visit. "
3238295,16026827,2014-07-20,14089955,Rob,"Samim and Aleksandra were fantastic hosts.  They were very responsive and helpful and eager to help us with anything they needed.  The apartment itself was  even better than described.  New, modern, clean, spacious and located in an extremely handy location with easy access to all that Seattle has to offer.  We had a great week."
3238295,16497531,2014-07-28,5019662,Sam & Carmen,"Wonderful apartment with great amenities such as fully stocked kitchen, bathroom supplies, entertainment system, etc.  Easy access to Greenlake, expressway, and coffee shops/restaurants.  Would definitely recommend this place for anyone looking to enjoy the Seattle area."
3238295,16998362,2014-08-05,17723333,Chris,"This was our first experience with air bnb and I'm tempted to quit while I'm ahead because I'm not sure any other place could get better. The apartment was immaculate and the hosts were incredibly kind and gracious. And they have mastered all of the small touches that really made our stay amazing; such as eggs and milk in the fridge, theo's chocolates when we arrived and laundry! Also it's in the best part of Phinney Ridge, just down the street from the zoo and walking distance from Sullys Snowgoose Saloon (aka favorite bar in seattle).
We were staying here during our wedding and it was a perfect oasis of serenity in between family chaos. We will definitely be booking again any time we are in Seattle in the future."
3238295,17574877,2014-08-14,15846852,Julie,"Samim's place is better than advertised. The airbnb experience could not have been better. Samim is a fantastic host who is always personable.The place has a full kitchen, washer/dryer, living space, bathroom, and a separate bedroom. The renovation is amazing with great taste and everything you need. The location was perfect in Phinney Ridge and a short driving distance to Pike Place and the Space Needle. On-street parking was never an issue as it is located in a quiet neighborhood. Would stay here again without hesitation. "
3238295,18185952,2014-08-23,13751678,Ashley,"If you are looking for a place to stay in Seattle, look no more more. This apartment is amazing and the hosts are sweet as can be. As partially submerged basement in a renovated craftsman home, this apartment is light, fresh, and modern. And above all, it's a home away from home. My boyfriend and I loved being to just crash on the couch and relax at the end of a long day of sightseeing. And being able to cook meals in the fully stocked kitchen was a real bonus as well. Samim and Aleksandra were excellent hosts and it was a pleasure to interact with them. This listing was all it promised and more. Definitely would stay here again!"
3238295,18664441,2014-08-30,14133222,Hien,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Samim's private apartment. It was spacious, clean, comfortable and tastefully decorated. Samim welcomed us when we arrived and showed us around the place and all the amenities which include a well stocked kitchen and bathroom. We appreciated the big screen TV as we were able to catch some tennis during the US Open week. All in all, it was such a pleasant stay for us that we'd love to stay here again should we have another chance to visit Seattle in the future. Thank you Samim for having shared your very nice home with us."
3238295,18951899,2014-09-03,6013552,Joan,"I reserved Samim's newly-renovated basement apartment for my parents who were visiting Seattle. They were very happy with the space and loved staying there. All the amenities it offers — tastefully decorated, TV + cable, washer/dryer, fully-equipped kitchen, internet — plus its fantastic location within walking distance to Phinney Ridge restaurants and the Zoo, makes it an excellent Airbnb property. Samim was also very friendly and helpful in making sure my parents were comfortable. 
"
3238295,20188847,2014-09-25,4547222,Debbie And Michael,"Read this: We have been traveling in Europe for over a year using airbnb almost exclusively. To do this, we rented our own home in Seattle so when we came back to visit friends and family we needed a 'home-away-from-home'. To do this in our own home-town seemed impossible! However, this absolutely wonderful, well decorated, comfortable and amenity-rich apartment was the perfect choice! The neighborhood is eclectic and fun, with lots of shops and great restaurants. The bus is handy (although a bit tedious) - but the city center is a short drive away. Call Uber if you don't have a car. Samim and his wife were so hospitable and helpful - you couldn't ask for better hosts. If you are coming to Seattle and want to spend time in an authentic neighborhood as opposed to right downtown this is the place. "
3238295,20706766,2014-10-04,21199848,Harold,"This was an absolutely stellar experience. Samim and Alexandra were extremely welcoming and ensured that everything was in order for me.

The apartment was excellent. It's a fantastic space with very new furnishings, very nice kitchen and bathroom. It was super quiet and felt very much like my own little place.

I can't recommend this space highly enough. Thank you for such a great stay."
3238295,21749198,2014-10-23,21500976,Max,"Samim was a wonderful host--he made sure we had absolutely everything we could possibly need. The apartment was beautiful and comfortable, and in a great location (close to several coffee shops, restaurants, a book store and a grocery store). Couldn't have had a more positive experience. "
3238295,22428969,2014-11-06,21574986,Kris,"We felt very welcome; when we came in there was some very nice chocolate which tasted so yum! The apartment is beautiful, and everything was as described. Samim made sure everything was 100% OK. The neighborhood is lovely too. Highly recommended. Would go there again!"
3238295,23194813,2014-11-24,23899031,Kyle,"Awesome apartment, location was great, very inexpensive for the accommodations, and the host was very nice.  I appreciate the hospitality I was shown during my stay.
Thank you,
"
3238295,23313068,2014-11-28,58718,Dietrich,"Fantastic service from Samim, who was very communicative, and very understanding of me accidentally putting the wrong dates in!

The location was very easy to find, and there was parking right out front for easy access.

The apartment is immaculate, spacious and comfortable.

Two things to be aware of:

1. The fold-out bed is a partial fold-out couch - there's not a full mattress in there. This is fine for a couple of nights with one person, but I wouldn't want to have a couple sleep there, or sleep there for very long. Probably fine for kids though!

2. Light sleepers should know that there's a knocking sound at night - water heater maybe?

Overall the place was fantastic for our needs - right amount of space, great location, and the hosts did a fantastic job!"
3238295,27268160,2015-03-01,16755471,Alison,"My dad and his friend just completed a four night stay with Samim. They were thrilled with the accommodations and how clear and easy Samim's instructions on getting to and inside the house were. I went over twice during their stay and was delighted to find a beautifully renovated and clean space. Sometimes basement rooms can be dark and unwelcoming, but there was so much daylight that the space felt light and open. The location couldn't have been more perfect, Phinney Ridge is such a cool little neighborhood, nestled in between Ballard and Greenlake (where I live) so transportation to and from was a breeze. 

My dad and I would absolutely recommend Samim and his beautiful Airbnb to friends and family in the future. Thanks for a great stay!"
3238295,27720781,2015-03-10,26792753,Sandy,"Samim and Alexsandra were the perfect hosts and they were very responsive with any questions that I had during my visit.  The apartment is spacious, nicely decorated, bright, clean and included everything I needed for a comfortable stay.   Upon arrival it was a nice surprise to find a few basic groceries and chocolates so I didn't need to shop right away.  Great location within walking distance to Woodland Park Zoo, restaurants, a market and bus stops.   I hope to stay here again on my next visit to Seattle."
3238295,30297548,2015-04-20,25042984,Michael,"We had an absolutely wonderful experience staying at this airbnb.  It is in a lovely residential neighborhood with beautiful views, and the unit itself was immaculate and welcoming.  There are several restaurants, a grocery store and many shops within walking distance.  We drove to Seattle, and there was always ample street parking.  Samim and Aleksandra put a lot of thought and effort into every detail and are wonderful hosts.  We would highly recommend them to anyone and hope to stay there again the next time we visit Seattle."
3238295,31772656,2015-05-10,28049575,Katie,We are just checking out of this beautiful home.  We had a fabulous stay and look forward to future visits!  The hosts are very friendly and hospitable!  Everything from a hair dryer to chocolate is here for you!  It is a great location and we will definitely be back!
3238295,34445458,2015-06-08,11278939,Elisabeth,"I loved this basement apartment! I was there for a little over two weeks and wish I could have stayed longer! The unit was furnished with everything I would need for a long-term stay, including all the necessary kitchen items, bedding and linens, washer-dryer, dishwasher, and more. It was very clean and nicely decorated. I was never cold in this unit, because I was able to adjust the heating (floor heating) which maintained a perfect temperature throughout my stay here. It was a big unit and felt very roomy with high ceilings and lots of space, yet was so comfortable and cozy at the same time. The TV and cable were a HUGE plus for me. I could come home from a long day of work, walk to one of my favorite restaurants just two blocks away on Phinney Ave to grab some dinner, curl up in a blanket on the comfy couch, and veg out in front of the huge flat screen tv at night. So relaxing. :) I would definitely stay here in the future and highly recommend this place to visitors in Seattle. "

Everything works. Parking was readily available on the street, and there is a separate, private entrance. The yard is professionally landscaped, inviting, and well maintained. The pictures accurately depict the apartment. Samim was welcoming, available, but not intrusive. He did everything he said he would do and was timely in his communication with me. There is everything to like about this whole Airbnb experience. I have already recommended this apartment to a friend, and I would definitely stay here again."
3238295,45895950,2015-09-06,7111067,Henry,"Highly recommended!

Great experience. The apartment is beautiful, well-lit and fully stocked with nearly everything you'd need for your stay.  It is in a gorgeous neighborhood in Northern Seattle, that has plenty of restaurants, shops and natural attractions close by. If Downtowns is your thing, there is a bus stop 2 blocks away that will get you downtown in 20 minutes. And the bus runs every 10 minutes or so.

Samim is a great host, with a great place in a great location. I would not hesitate to stay here again.

3238295,47773606,2015-09-21,24023187,Aaron,"The apartment was very clean and well decorated. I arrived to find a binder with interesting local attractions on the table and a bar of chocolate to get me started. The hosts checked in several times to make sure I was doing well and were quick to resolve an issue with the wireless internet. The neighborhood is great with restaurants and shops within a several block walk. I was staying on business, and found the apartment comfortable for me to spread out my work. All in all, a very comfortable stay in an attractive location."

The home was very comfortable, clean, and quiet.  The neighborhood was in a great location.  We were able to walk to local cafes and coffee shops, and run to nearby green lake and the running trail around it.  Samim was and excellent host, very attentive and responsive.  If we ever come back to Seattle this is where we will be staying.  Highly recommended!"
284813,869513,2012-01-17,1371795,Peter,David's place was located in a great part of the city (near the market and Belltown restaurants) and was easy to get into.
284813,1238328,2012-05-07,1822300,Ron,"Very cool, super hip loft. Great location - just a few blocks to the Space Needle and maybe 10 blocks to Pike Place market - both were an easy walk for us even in the rain. The loft is gorgeous and felt very luxurious to stay there. Only downside is street noise, which didn't bother me and my wife as we are used to city living and used our noise machines (thanks to our iPads). Nice to have a parking place too. Once in the city we just left our car there and walked everywhere. Love Belltown, just a few blocks away. We would stay here again."
284813,1488959,2012-06-16,1516852,Chris,Enjoyed the stay.  Very nice loft and good location.  Good communication with the owner.  Would consider again.
284813,1546560,2012-06-24,1792113,Adam,"The place is beautiful. The location is perfect and it is right near the Seattle center and close to the market and aquarium. Full kitchen with any and every ammenity you could imagine. The place was clean and the pull-out bed downstairs is actually very comfortable. There were extra blankets, pillows, and towels. My friends and I were extremely satisfied and you will be too."
284813,1618732,2012-07-03,1031007,Nick,"Everything you see is as delivered. Would be hard-pressed to find something that didn't fit the description. David answered my call and everything went as smoothly as his directions said they would. If you want a jazzy space in a good location, you get full value for the price. Would rent again."
284813,1937495,2012-08-09,2872073,Michael,Very nice street level loft apartment. Great location. Easy half mile walk to great attractions. Very well kept and supplied. Only downside is a little noisy being street level and AC wasn't working when we were there. Despite that I would definitely stay here again.

284813,2494301,2012-10-03,1016036,Emma,"Really well-appointed loft in the middle of Bell Town. It's not super close to Capitol Hill (the main cool neighborhood of Seattle) but it's close enough to lots of bars and restaurants, and a 15-20 minute walk from the touristy stuff of Pike's Place and the Space Needle/EMP. Lots of nice touches, and nice to have a balcony."
284813,2663987,2012-10-20,3654181,David,"Very nice two story loft, with good location, excellent aesthetic, beautiful kitchen. As others have said its first floor facing a busy street so a bit noisy at night (cars > people) but that didn't bother me much. Parking was a terrific plus. Definitely would stay again. "
284813,3412040,2013-01-25,4670463,Kaleb,"Stunning loft, great location, easy instructions! Few blocks from the downtown shopping area and waterfront. 

Can't say enough about the unit - seriously stunning. The 2-story windows let in an enormous amount of light and the openess of the loft is incredible. 

Highly recommended for anyone looking for a good time.  "
284813,3428698,2013-01-28,4613630,Maria,"David’s loft in Belltown was perfect. Clean, accessible to food and bus routes. Everything went very smooth. I would definitely stay in this location again.  "
284813,3532015,2013-02-13,3835378,John,"Walking into this loft feels as if you've stepped into your own place. The loft is fully furnished with every sort of kitchen equipment you could need. The loft is large and spacious and the bed is comfortable.
The loft is centrally located – about 10-15 minutes walk to Pike Place Market and 10-15 minutes walk to the Seattle Center and The Space Needle. 

As others have reviewed, the loft is located on ground level of a quite busy road, at all times day and night there are cars and trucks driving past, the trucks can get quite noisy especially of a night time. David did provide ear plugs though."
284813,3648298,2013-02-27,2403236,Susanna,Very great experience! It was our first time using Airbnb. David was a great host. His place was just like the pictures. Clean and stocked with all things u need. AMAZING location downtown. Short walking distance from pikes market and space needle. We enjoyed our stay and would definitely stay at one of David's condos/places again!  
284813,3686060,2013-03-04,3362116,Michael,"Our stay in Seattle was an amazing one thanks to this great loft. A nice sound system, great decor and perfect location (walking to Pike's and Space Needle) made going out and putting our feet up midday a pleasure. Having this place truly felt like a vacation done right, and I would recommend it to anyone who wants to live it up while they are in Seattle."
284813,4108078,2013-04-10,656114,Jessica,"What a wonderful place to enjoy the downtown Seattle area! The open, bright space, lovely decorating, and comfortable bed make this a fabulous alternative to any hotel! Everything we needed durning our stay was available, and the access to the unit and parking made it perfect. It's just blocks from the Sculpture Park, the waterfront, and easy access to the Public Market, as well as all the fabulous Belltown restaurants, coffee shops, and Macrina Bakery (a must visit every morning!). I would return for another stay any time!"
284813,4131791,2013-04-12,5779421,Kevin,David's loft is a great place to stay and great location.  I would highly recommend this place.  The only small tidbit is the street noise in the morning.  But David provides earplugs that should help.
284813,4171458,2013-04-15,5039924,Lili,Perfect downtown location.  Beautiful and unique spot.  I loved staying here!
284813,4242012,2013-04-22,3970175,Sarah,"David was a joy to work with! His place had EVERYTHING we needed and was very comfortable. Oh and location is PERFECT! 10 min walk to Pikes Market, couple blocks from the space needle, near freeway access (if you plan on venturing out further than just the city,) a block from bars and great restaurants (if you like sushi try UMI), or even a short walk to local grocery markets. You do hear street noise (cars and on weekend more ""foot traffic"" than a weekday), but you're in the CITY!!! Enjoy it, its all part of the experience... and if not like other reviewers stated he supplies ear plugs.  I would definitely stay here again the next time I'm visiting Seattle! "

284813,6256889,2013-08-05,7543838,Ruth,"Very cool apartment, very clean, and GREAT location.  This worked out really well for my husband and me.  We had a great weekend in Seattle, walked everywhere. Right in the neighborhood there were excellent breakfast spots, and then just a 10-15 minute walk to Pike Place.  5 minute walk to the cool sculpture park on the water.  As a first time airbnb-er, we were pleasantly surprised with the apartment, bathroom amenities (equivalent to a hotel), etc. You do need to close all the blinds at night to have any privacy, as this ""loft"" is actually on the first and second floors.  But we thought it was perfect.  "
284813,7092376,2013-09-06,6337106,Yann,"We stayed for PAX Prime 2013, based in the Washington State Convention Center about a 15-20 minute walk away (also the center of town), and could only offer the utmost gratitude and highest commendations for an excellent destination and host! The photos don't do the scale of this apartment justice, since it is understatedly spacious (coming from someone in the UK, at least). The place was spotless, and offered more than enough amenities to accommodate the stay. Only 10-15 minutes walk from the Space Needle, this is the ideal destination for a visit to Seattle!"
284813,7155253,2013-09-09,5016518,Amelia,"We absolutely loved staying at David's place for our first visit to Seattle. The location is extremely close to several delicious restaurants, cool bars and a couple general stores. I highly recommend Macrina for breakfast and The Innkeepers back patio for happy hour on a sunny afternoon. Pikes Place, EMP Music Museum, and the Space Needle are all only a ten minute walk away. We didnt use our rental car once!
The accommodations were great. Super comfy bed, great shower and the washer and dryer really came in handy for our road trip. 
Highly recommend this place!"
284813,7271024,2013-09-14,5290742,Ashley,"The loft is in an amazing location and it was great to have a full kitchen, laundry, and parking! We have only very minor complaints such as check in being a bit awkward. We felt like we had to sneak around to get inside and the directions even say to not make it obvious you're reading directions to get inside. I guess that sometimes comes with the territory of using airbnb. The shower curtain and couch are gross (super stained curtain, shedding couch), but otherwise everything really is nice. Seriously can't beat the location!"
284813,7495136,2013-09-22,5551673,Vinayak,"Great loft in an unbeatable location in Seattle. Walking distance to some awesome restaurants and bars in happening Belltown. The neighborhood is well lit and feels safe to walk around in. The loft itself is exactly as it appears in the pictures -- neat and clean, spacious for 2 people and tastefully decorated. It has a fully equipped kitchen and washer/drier/dishwasher. It is also one of the only dog friendly accommodations in that area on airbnb -- our pup had a great time. 
Communication with David was prompt and clear. Overall a great experience for us."

284813,9144489,2013-12-09,10210100,Lori,"The loft was very nice! Right in the heart of Seattle with easy access to museums, restaurants, and breweries. The loft is on a busy street so there was some noise, earplugs are provided. It was very cold, frigid temperatures in Seattle the week that we were there so the heater was running nonstop and because of the windows it was a little drafty. The bed was very comfortable and the apartment was very clean. We really enjoyed the uniqueness of the loft. It was a great space!"
284813,10718526,2014-03-04,5594354,Janalynn,"We had a wonderful time staying at the Loft.  Everything was very neat and clean, and the neighborhood was pleasant.  The photos are representative (with the exception of the two with the orange wall, which must be another property?), but the couch and shower curtain have been updated.  It was wonderful to have a full kitchen, and washer and dryer.  We did not have any trouble with entry/exit instructions, as David made it all clear.  The parking space was tight, but that is pretty standard at these sorts of complexes.  While there was a bit of road noise from the street directly out front, it did not bother us.  We're from a big city and are used to some noise, so neither of us used the earplugs that were provided for guests.  We loved being so near to the Myrtle Edwards State Park, which has  a lovely trail along the water for running/walking/cycling.  When the weather was nice, we walked to Pike's Place Market, to the Seattle Center, and to restaurants and bakeries in the neighborhood.  We definitely plan to stay here again, next time we visit Seattle, and we'll recommend it to our friends.  "

The downstairs apt was so comfortable and cozy for our short visit.  The art displayed was so cool and interesting it was hard to leave."

The bathroom has one of the best showers I have ever seen! "

We were meeting longtime friends for dinner and did not what a trip home to Whidbey Island to shorten the evening.  Loved the walkable neighborhood, gracious host and comfy bed.  Everything we needed! Amy"

1301535,14044809,2014-06-10,12434060,Jordan,"The house was extremely welcoming and comfortable. Corinne and Tom provided all of the amenities you would find in a hotel, but with a much more comfortable environment. The proximity to dining and activities was also extremely convenient. I would be happy to stay here again!

They communicated promptly, and you could tell they wanted our stay to be as enjoyable as possible. We really enjoyed the back yard, and the hammock is great!The neighborhood is charming and sooooo quiet! I will stay there again.  "

I am 6'3"" and bumped my head once in the basement through my own fault, but if you are over 6'5"" I would recommend looking for another place. Would definitely stay here again!!"
1301535,14380377,2014-06-17,2657236,Rachelle,Ben and I had a nice time at Corinne's. We arrived earlier than expected but got to meet Corinne later in the evening. She's wonderful! Her home is beautiful and the space we stayed in was so cute and homely. Her dogs are adorable and we got to meet them in the morning :). This is just what we needed after camping.
1301535,14403065,2014-06-18,15745828,Tristan,"Absolutely fantastic experience here.

1301535,16674720,2014-07-31,17764771,Kathy,"Corrine was a lovely hostess, very friendly.  The neighborhood was well maintained and quiet.  It was easily accessed and within walking distance to Ballard downtown.  The main bedroom was very comfortable.  The second bedroom was well furnished.  My family had a very good time there.  We really enjoyed the deck area during the evenings, winding down from the day's adventure.  All in all, I would love to stay there again.  Thank you, Corrine for a nice time in the Seattle area.  "
1301535,16806003,2014-08-02,4349653,Jon,"Corinne's place was fantastic! My friend and I loved the luxurious queen sized bed with a great duvet. The basement bedroom was also excellent for a sunny summer day as it was quite cool and a great respite from the heat. The bathroom was emmaculate as well and the shower felt like something from a new, modern hotel. We also loved its proximity to great places like Delancey and easy access to bot the D and 40 lines to downtown. Corinne was also an exceedingly nice and accommodating hosts with 3 very adorable dogs."
1301535,16848117,2014-08-03,363753,Jeremy,"Hey all,

We had an early flight to Seattle and arrived at 8:40am.  Check in wasn't supposed to be till 3pm.  However, Corinne, heartwarming and gracious, allowed us to drop off our bags while we explored the city until we could check in.

The accommodations were splendid and homey.  Remember to keep the tradition of signing her guest book before you part ways from this slice of Seattle Life stay!

Thanx Corinne! "

We found several restaurants close to the house. The apartment is not too big not too small, perfect for a family of 4 like us. It is well decorated. We really like the bedroom and bathroom.
We also appreciate the warm welcome of Corinne when we arrived. "

There were so many little touches to make us feel welcome, with hot chocolate and oatmeal packets in addition to the coffee and tea, and chocolate mints on the pillows.  The bed was so comfortable it was hard to leave in the morning.  And Corinne and Tom were awesome hosts.

Their place was also a really short walk from shops and restaurants.  We had a great night getting a few drinks at Kickin' Boot, taking a walk around the rest of the Ballard strip, and then returning for more awesome food at Kickin' Boot."

Corinne and Tom are so hospitable and accommodating--any little thing you can possibly think of to need during your stay is available. My cousin and I stayed for a long weekend and while we were pretty much there just to sleep and shower, the place would have been great for much more than that. I felt safe and the location was great--it truly felt like a home away from home!"

Very homey with personal & thoughtful touches - books, games, maps, etc.  Comfortable bed and pillows so we slept great. Cute residential neighborhood is safe and easy to walk around, including at night,  to shops and restaurants. Close and easy access to bus lines which we used to go to downtown Seattle.  Terrific location. A lovely home with gracious hosts!"
1301535,21425570,2014-10-17,21100141,Scott,"This was our first Airbnb and it was fantastic.
We were running late and Corrine had no problems accommodating us, when we arrived she greeted us and was very friendly. She gave us great info on restaurants in the area and sightseeing advice. 
Staying here was like staying at a friend's house, clean and comfortable with coffee, tea , cocoa and oatmeal. There was plenty of room for the three of us and although the ceilings are a bit low as mentioned i had no problems (I'm 6') and plenty of clearance and the place was very spacious.
Was only a few minutes drive from Pikes Place and Space Needle, and there are places to eat and stores only blocks away.
Wish we could have stayed longer and will absolutely stay here again.
Thanks  for everything Corinne

1301535,22013052,2014-10-28,4887699,Jacqui,"This was a great space in a basement apartment, perfect for the weekend stay. Corinne and Tom were always available in person or by text and very responsive, which was so helpful. They were great with a last minute change to the reservation, gave us detailed tours of the space, and always with a ready smile. My 6' friend was fine in the space, just had to duck a little for the heating ducts but he didn't mind at all. I would recommend this space and this host to others. By the way, the media room was an entirely separate room with a really comfortable convertible couch and a door that closes for privacy. My friend said the couch/bed was very comfortable to sleep on. The media room and the bedroom run parallel to each other with a common wall between the two."

Their place feels like home and if we could stay there again, we definitely would. They are both very nice and they made sure we we're comfortable and had everything we needed. They are very detail-oriented and put a lot of thought into the rooms. There we're plenty of board games to keep us entertained on rainy nights and their coffee/French press was invaluable. Everything was perfect, you couldn't ask for better hosts. "
1301535,22762411,2014-11-14,18281600,Billy,"It's such a comfortable place to stay, make us feel like just at home.
Corinne and Tom have been very nice and helpful.  We got nice advices from Corinne about our tour plan.  We really loved our Air Bnb experience, we find a smart choice for our travel."
1301535,22889226,2014-11-17,13280445,Naomi,"Corinne and Tom were so warm, friendly, helpful and welcoming the entire stay! Tom even helped us bring our bags in and my sleeping son in his stroller down to the apt. The apt. is fantastic and both bedrooms are wonderful spaces! The chocolates, cookies and selection of teas and oatmeal were such a sweet touch!  Ballard is a wonderful neighbourhood and their home is in a great spot! "
1301535,23529192,2014-12-03,23372725,Chenwen,"The house hosts, Corinne and Tom, are friendly and thoughtful. They made me feel relieved with my first experience of Airbnb."
1301535,23592311,2014-12-06,15494090,Greg,"We arrived quite late (10pm) but Tom still happily gave us the tour and  got us settled in.  After a Super 8 the night before we were happy for the extra space, cleanliness and security.  There really was ample space for the 4 of us and our many suitcases.  We were only in town for 3 nights and 2 full days so were out all day sight-seeing and came back late at night to sleep.  The bed was very comfortable and the heated blanket kept us toasty warm.  Tom was very kind to let us park in the driveway the night before we left and Corrine was very quick with communication prior to the trip and helping us out with suggestions and ideas. I only wish we had a chance to spend a little bit of time catching up, but were like ships in the night as we were so busy.  This was our first AirBnB experience and it was a great one.  We would have no hesitation in recommending you stay with Corinne & Tom if you are heading to Seattle. Thanks guys for your hospitality.  "
1301535,23737837,2014-12-08,24520887,Tyler,"Great location in Ballard close to Fremont and the breweries there, which was very convenient for our needs. Really cool rental with lots of space that is well decorated and equipped."
1301535,23780180,2014-12-09,21940842,Eva,"This was a great place to stay. Corinne responded to my request quickly and with just 1 day notice and was very accommodating. Upon arrival Tom came to greet us and gave us a quick tour. The place was very clean, the coffee and tea were very appreciated and I would definitely return. There was a list of recommended restaurants, breweries, etc in the city and neighborhood which was great-we used these and had a really good dinner as a result. Overall great space and great hosts! "
1301535,24854376,2015-01-03,23871682,Bridget,What a great stay. Perfect for what we needed! Tom and Corinne are super friendly and gave us plenty of privacy. Thanks a bunch! 
1301535,25435681,2015-01-16,19074080,Christel,"I only saw Tom briefly, but Corinne was extremely helpful and courteous to me during my entire visit. I couldn't have asked for a nicer hostess. The neighborhood was very walkable with plenty of places to eat. 

The rooms are quite large and nicely appointed. I enjoyed staying in them. Everything was very clean. The wifi was top notch. The bed was so comfy I had a hard time getting out of it. The place definitely has that basement feel to it though, with low ceilings, little natural light, uneven heating and minimal sound insulation, so that's something to consider if those things are an issue for you. Also, the kitchenette is better for preparing snacks than meals, and there is no table suitable for dining, so I would recommend planning to eat out for major meals.

Overall I thought this was a great value with so much space and privacy. I had a wonderful stay, and would recommend it for those that enjoy nicely furnished basements."
1301535,25527278,2015-01-18,2234953,Julie,Corrine was a fabulous host. There was so much to do and so much thought and detail gone into every aspect of our accommodation. From detailed tourist destinations to netflicks - we truly enjoyed our stay in Seattle. Corrine was great fun to talk to and genuinely intereted in us and did her best to make our time in Seattle the best possible :-) I'd stay here again in a heart beat.
1301535,25612494,2015-01-20,25819113,Siavash,The place was great. Corinne was very nice and showed us around the place. There were lots of board games and movies available to use. I would definitely stay there again. 
1301535,26076927,2015-02-02,10171846,Kate,This place was perfect!  Corrine was an awesome host and the neighbor hood was so cute.  We had a great time and were within walking distance of everything we needed.  
1301535,26352074,2015-02-10,4887699,Jacqui,"Just enjoyed my 2nd stay with Corinne and Tom. There is no greater compliment than a repeat lodger!  :-) Two large comfy rooms and spaces to sit and chat. Both rooms have a heater and the bed in the bedroom has a heating blanket, too. I love that they continue to make small improvements to the place to make it more comfy for those who are staying here. Thanks again!"
1301535,26619207,2015-02-16,26292646,Sara,"We had a wonderful stay with Tom and Corinne! The room was even better than advertised. The bed was cozy and comfortable, we loved the little touches like having tea and almond milk available, and the rain shower in the bathroom was great! PArking was easy and the Ballard location was close to lots of restaurants and shops. We would definitely stay here again!"
1301535,27956041,2015-03-15,28533014,Derek,"This place was awesome! Chocolates on the pillows, delicious pastries for snacks, and an all around cute atmosphere"
1301535,28064629,2015-03-16,9727446,Kimberly,"We had such a pleasant stay here! Everything was clean and cozy. The decorations were quirky, beds were heavenly, and we had all the ""extras"" we needed. The host introduced herself but gave us our privacy. We would definitely stay here again if we needed a place in Seattle. "
1301535,28113158,2015-03-17,12933109,Juniper,"The space was very comfortable and clean and Corinne was very kind. We arrived pretty late, but she gave us instructions on how to get in and it was very easy. The apartment was really cute and had everything we needed for our stay. We would absolutely stay here again! "
1301535,28183126,2015-03-19,28642856,Camila,"Tom and Corinne were extremely hospitable - our stay with them exceeded our expectations based on their listing. Corinne was happy to give us recommendations on what to do in the city, and there was so much thought put into every little detail of the bedroom + common area to make our stay as comfortable as possible. "
1301535,28941892,2015-04-01,13043498,Gerald,We stayed with Corrine and Tom for three weeks while visiting our granddaughter who was due to have a baby. Corrine and Tom were very accommodating during our stay. They even worked with us to make two separate bookings since we would be making a short trip to Idaho in the middle of the three week stay. This way we didn't have to pay for the days we weren't there. They even stored some of our luggage in the meantime. The rooms are perfect. Very nice and clean. They have a beautiful home and have stocked the guest area with all kinds of things to keep you entertained. The low ceilings weren't really an issue even with me being 6 feet tall. We visited several times with Corrine and very much enjoyed our conversations. I would highly recommend this air bnb and would stay here again. Thank you Corrine and Tome for your hospitality. 
1301535,29687284,2015-04-11,29589855,David,Corinne greeted us and gave a nice overview of the rooms. It worked out perfect for our family and the neighborhood was awesome. Would gladly stay with them again.
1301535,30656374,2015-04-25,21427013,David,Outstanding stay
1301535,34862864,2015-06-13,20984558,Jessica,We were very pleased with our stay at Tom and Corinne's place.  Corinne was very welcoming and accommodating.  The description was accurate and the place very comfortable.  We would stay again!
1301535,35210650,2015-06-16,30032897,Jenni,"Corinne's and Tom's  place is everything and more they say it is. They have thought about every little imaginable and unimaginable detail to make their guests feel comfortable. We felt relaxed, had enough privacy and slept like babies :)

The neighborhood is nice and quiet, and theres a bus to the 'city' within 2 minutes walk. Plenty of parking place.

We will definitely stay at Corinne's and Tom's next time we're in Seattle, highly recommended! "
1301535,35414336,2015-06-18,30929855,Audrey,Corinne and Tom made our stay in Seattle convenient and comfortable. Their place is very homey and they put a lot of thought and care into setting up their airbnb listing and we really appreciated it. We would definitely come back if we're in the area again!
1301535,35639833,2015-06-21,1110615,Mary,"The accommodations were spacious, clean and had great amenities.  The Ballard location was great."
1301535,36094530,2015-06-25,30245096,Connie,"We really enjoyed our stay at Tom and Corinne's.  Before arriving, I was concerned the accommodation would not be spacious enough for 4 guests, but it definitely was. Very private, the bathroom is spacious. The kitchen area has everything you need for your stay.  the location is not far from downtown. We took the light rail from the airport, and from there we took a taxi, it was about $23 to Corinne's place. We used public transportion back into downtown. There is a car rental place only 5 minute walk from Corinne's which we needed to go to Mt. Rainier. I would recommend you stay here. I really liked the basement feel to it.  Thank you Corinne for your hospitality. "
1301535,36250698,2015-06-26,8225143,Matt,"An all-round fantastic Airbnb. Corinne was great and made our short stay as pleasant as possible. The house is located in a quiet residential neighbourhood, walking distance to loads of trendy bars, restaurants and shops. A great introduction to Seattle, would definitely recommend."
1301535,36707423,2015-06-30,32759748,Mitchelle,"This particular photo is SOOOO Misleading!  The room looks a tad small and a little 1980, but that is not the case at all!  There are two wonderfully sized, independent, clean, comfortable bedrooms.  Everything is up to date and there are generous amenities including plenty of outlets, bedside lights, all kitchenette necessities from cutting board to compost trash, and a great reading selection.  The bathroom had everything from a hairdryer to fluffy towels to a deluxe shower head.  The hosts were friendly and non intrusive.  Tom met us as we arrived and gave us a perfect tour of the space and the amenities including ""Here's how to use the media center"". The private coded entry made for easy access.  The dogs made a bit of noise from time to time, but nothing unmanageable.  As someone who is afraid of dogs I felt fine the entire time.  Easy communication before and during the stay including modifying our arrival time since we got distracted in downtown and didn't get to the house till later in the afternoon.  And amazingly convenient location including parking.  Even with it being a busy weekend in Seattle we were able to get to Capitol Hill and downtown within minutes by car as well as the shore.  We were about 10 minutes from a 24 Hour fitness, 5 minutes from a Walgreen's and grocery, great diverse neighborhood for walking.  Though Ballard itself seemed a bit more Caucasian hipster than the rest of Seattle, as two women of color we felt safe and accepted walking around, joining karaoke, and watching the Women's World Cup wit the locals.  "
1301535,36960745,2015-07-03,28714944,Elizabeth,"Corinne and Tom were excellent hosts. They made us feel very welcome by providing tea and chocolate! The neighborhood was quiet and close to our destinations in the city. The space was clean and spacious, and easy to park and enter/exit. It was truly ideal for my sister's bachelorette party, and I would highly recommend you stay with Corinne and Tom. "
1301535,37091543,2015-07-04,36085055,Yasmeen,"We loved loved loved our experience in Seattle and it was made even better staying with our hosts Corinne and Tom! Corinne was very sweet and it was nice to meet our hosts since I usually do not. She was really welcoming and gave us many suggestions and recommendations. The neighborhood was very safe and residential. The pictures should be updated since the place is even better looking now. The pictures don't do it justice, it really is swanky! There are so many little details and decor that made the place feel welcoming and cozy. It was very spacious and entertaining. Corinne gave us a nice tour of the place and explained where everything is. She has a few set of rules and you have to pay to use the washer and dryer. The bathroom was clean and had all the amenities a hotel would have plus a homey feel. Next time I visit Seattle, I will be staying with Corinne and Tom."
1301535,38259016,2015-07-14,19847019,Anne,"I had a lengthy stay with Tom and Corinne along with 2 other friends. It was absolutely brilliant. They are very friendly and welcoming and helpful in all manner of ways from assisting with bags to telling about the local area and what was on at the time. 
The unit is very comfortable with large airy rooms. No kitchen as such but we had microwave, fridge, toaster, kettle and coffee pot. Laundry facilites are available  The TV is basic, no cable but netflix is available as well as wireless internet. There is plenty of parking in the drive way and street. A fenced back yard and back porch to sit if desired. We did not make use of this but could have. I would definitely stay again if I was back in Seattle. Its a pretty central location with easy access to down town and other important tourist places :):). "
1301535,39307718,2015-07-22,26332283,Dan,Corinne's place is awesome! It's comfortable and clean. Very spacious even though I'm traveling with three other adults and a two-year old. It's conveniently located so close to everything. Corinne checks in with us often to make sure if we've got everything we need. We definitely recommend this place!
1301535,39421189,2015-07-23,36816248,Daniel,Wir waren sehr zufrieden. Corinne war sehr freundlich. Saubere Räume und freundliche Atmosphäre. Gerne wieder.
1301535,39916490,2015-07-27,2398753,Angie,"This place was amazing.  It's pretty huge and accommodated my entire crew (6 people, one infant) and had room to spare.  Very comfy. It was easy to find and right in the middle of where we needed to be.  I loved being able to have access to the back yard to relax.  The hosts were more than awesome.  I didn't get to meet Corinne in person, but she was amazing at dealing with me trying to book this place and changing my mind a million times!!  I would book again when I go back to Seattle.  "
1301535,40572332,2015-08-01,988079,Jim,"Corinne greeted us on our arrival and showed us the living quarters covering all the particulars regarding the TV,  coffeemaker, hot plate, and the location of the kitchen essentials.  She encouraged us to either knock on her door or call her or Tom anytime with any questions.  

The listing was accurate and certainly lived up to our expectations.  

The neighborhood is safe and tidy.  Ample on-street parking.   Public transportation is also within easy walking distance.  We primarily chose the location because it was within a mile of our daughter's home.

You won't be disappointed if you decide to stay with Corinne & Tom."
1301535,40887536,2015-08-03,4444249,Tiffany,"Corinne and Tom were very welcoming and considerate hosts. They took the time to set our beds and walk us through the place. It was a great setup and most things that you need as a visitor was pretty much provided. If you forget something no worries they have most things in stock, hence an iron and blow dryer. 

For those of you who are dog lovers; they have a few dogs in the home above the guest rooms; which felt pretty relaxing because when they barked I know the place is safe. 

Overall, Corinne and Tom made a great pair of hosts. We definitely felt comfortable staying at their home. 

Thank you for having us stay at your awesome home. We enjoyed our stay. "
1301535,42254848,2015-08-12,988079,Jim,The listing was accurate and the neighborhood was delightful.  Tom helped me in with my bags and we quickly settled in for our second stay with Corinne & Tom.  The two spacious rooms provided the privacy that my daughter and I required.  We will definitely stay with them again on future trips to Seattle.
1301535,44411691,2015-08-26,7200756,Kate,"The hosts were very communicative and welcoming. The apartment is fabulous. It is very spacious and comfortable, with everything my family needed for a weeklong stay. We loved the personal touches and amenities. The location is perfect and easy to get to using public transportation. The neighborhood is not only safe and clean, but also quaint and peaceful. There were a lot of dining options with walking distance, and a short bus ride takes you to downtown Ballard. I definitely recommend a stay."
1301535,44794118,2015-08-29,33236190,Brian,"Corinne and Tom's cute and LARGE basement apartment was charming, and absolutely wonderful for a stay to visit family in Seattle! Decor was quirky and something I wish I could reproduce at home. Great amenities and special touches like DVD collection for the kiddies. I slept like a baby in the master bedroom and was so much better than a tiny hotel room. Corinne and Tom have made me a convert to AirBNB - I will be back!"
1301535,45380612,2015-09-02,24481033,Isabella,"Corinne and Tom have been splendid hosts, helping us feel comfortable and offering advice when we asked for it. The apartment is extremely cozy, a great place for a get-away from one's busy lifestyle. And is even equipped with all sorts of games and shows to entertain yourself even if you feel like staying in/it's raining. My group of 6 felt that the apartment was a just nice fit for us but an additional person would have been a little tight. Overall, loved the apartment and would love to visit again!"
1301535,47176437,2015-09-16,6016560,Linda,"Corinne and Tom are the perfect hosts: accessible but not intrusive. Their apartment is very clean, comfortable, and well-lit, with both overhead and task lighting options in every area (not always the case in basement apartments).The neighborhood is very safe, suits my needs well, and is as others have described. An added plus for me was the wealth of information about Seattle and environs they provide: published guidebooks, attraction brochures, bus and ferry schedules, restaurant menus, and Corinne and Tom's own self-produced restaurant guide with wonderful annotations about what makes each place special. I hope there'll be space available every time I visit my daughter in Seattle!"
1301535,48912706,2015-09-29,16475523,Gretchen,"My plans changed quite a bit during my trip but Corinne and Tom were very accommodating! I unfortunately didn't get the chance to meet them, but their place was amazing! Lots of room, nice and quiet, and great location. They had everything you would need for your stay, including tons of travel brochures for things to do around Seattle. I would definitely stay here again!"
1301535,49257181,2015-10-02,33289062,Rebecca,"Upon arrival Tom met my friends and I outside and gave us a detailed tour of the place. The place was beautiful, even better than the pictures! The neighborhood was lovely and not far from downtown. We really enjoyed our stay."
1301535,49674903,2015-10-05,44208653,Alison,Corinne & Tom were great! We were able to easily find the place and let ourselves in and it was all ready for our arrival. They were super friendly and helpful and the place was perfect for our stay. Would love to stay again if we found ourselves in the area again!
1301535,50189430,2015-10-10,41878785,Vicky,"Corinne and Tom were perfect hosts, very welcoming and accommodating. Their apartment is full of interesting objects and was spotlessly clean. Very comfy beds and high quality bed and bath linen. There are limited cooking facilities but this wasn't an issue for us. We loved the supply of fresh coffee beans too!"
1301535,50906218,2015-10-15,19357238,John,"Very welcoming experience, attention to detail, helpful about our experience in the area, traffic, places to eat, etc.  "
1301535,51379486,2015-10-19,44971709,Ruth,Corinne and Tom made me feel so welcome! They were so kind and helpful and thought of everything we could have needed. Having not spent much time in Seattle the Ballard neighborhood is so much fun and has so many things to do. The space was great and better than I could have expected. Everything was wonderful! 
59708,740555,2011-11-23,1401631,Jenny,"We stayed at the Tuscan Oasis mid week for 2 nights in November.  
Pros: great location, clean, well stocked and comfortable. Even the pull out sofa was comfortable! A big bonus was the the fantastic bakery below. Handy for breakfast and really good coffee. 
Cons: If you are a light sleeper I would not recommend this as the best place for you. Traffic noise is constant.  Plus, and this was a big one, we woke up to screams in the middle of the night not to mention having the displeasure of many a drunken serenades. "
59708,3205897,2013-01-01,3682888,Deborah,"We stayed in this updated unit (316), on the west side of the complex. Things we appreciated: privacy, internet, cable, washer & dryer, dishwasher, & free covered parking area below- we challenge you to find a better deal in Seattle.  It was VERY clean, well laid out & organized. Kitchen, bathroom & living area was completely stocked. Easy access to pool, hot tub area, work out area, and courtyard.  
The location is perfect for Seattle attractions /ferries/ rental car locations, and easy to use the bus system/ light rail.  I had read that some previous tenants were not fond of the noise, but one must remember they are in a city, and this is just a part of being in a highly populated area- if your windows are open, you will hear city sounds. -comes with the territory. 
We were able to sleep soundly and feel comfortable. Darik was was attentive to our changing needs and always professional. We would recommend this unit to any of our family or friends. "
59708,23465433,2014-12-01,6290076,Chelsea,"Tuscan Oasis was a great find. Excellent location (the bakery downstairs is delicious and it's only a few minutes to Pike Place Market). We had 4 guests so 2 of us slept on the pull out couch, which was comfortable. The hosts set us up with some snacks and a whole binder full of great recommendations. We loved Seattle. Thanks!"
59708,28495528,2015-03-24,27101615,Michael,The apartment was very conveniently located in Belltown and the place was clean and just as described.  We were met in front of the building and everything was ready.
59708,28703266,2015-03-29,2850625,Shir,"We were four friends staying at the flat during a conference weekend and couldn't have hoped for a better experience. The flat was comfortable and accommodating, exactly as published. The foldout sofa bed is very comfortable. We could sit there and work during the day, as well as enjoy the amenities such as rooftop patio, courtyard, gym, and pool. 
The neighborhood is fantastic, close to the beautiful sea side promenade and to many good restaurants, cafes, and bars. It was also an easy walk downtown to where our conference was held. 
Finally, Oasis Rentals were quick to respond to every question or concern we had, and were always friendly, courteous, and made sure we had a great experience. 
Thank you for an excellent stay!"
59708,54953121,2015-11-25,8267886,Millennium Flats,Apartment Looks Great!
4047058,19575727,2014-09-14,21012522,Clare,"Classic and clean, this is a beautiful craftsman house with a friendly host, who goes above and beyond for his guests, and one sweet bengal cat."
4047058,20057424,2014-09-22,21012522,Clare,"I extended my stay in the Green Suite, a sunny room with ample closet space, plenty of hangers and shelving, and comfortable bed.  The room is as pictured and described...very nice."
4047058,20265416,2014-09-26,11343101,Anastarr,"Roland's home is beautiful and quite homey! He was very welcoming, and accommodating. It really felt like my own home, as I was very welcome to utilize the kitchen and TV/living room as my own comfortable homey hang out spots. The house is very clean and comfortable, especially the TV room! 
He rents 3 rooms out in the upstairs part of the house, which are all very close together, so unfortunately you can hear your neighbors at times, which can tend to be a problem if you are trying to sleep. But it's also nice for meeting new people on your visit. The room I was in, the Green Suite, is probably the most spacious out of the three, and was very comfortable. The bed, including the bedding is very cozy. There is a shared bathroom on the top floor, and a nicer, bigger bathroom near the kitchen downstairs, which I recommend using. Something to be noted is that there is a cat, Jasper who lives there also, and he definitely wants your attention, so be prepared for some cat lovin'! The neighborhood is AWESOME!!!! It is in such a great location, the best in Seattle in my opinion! You can walk to the lake and take the entire trail around Green Lake. I also highly recommend popping into a sweet little spot called Chocolati where you can get an assortment of amazing chocolate truffles, hot chocolate and coffee. The neighborhood felt very safe! 
I honestly rarely saw Roland, he really just gives you your space to make it your own home, but the times I did see him, he was very friendly! Thanks Roland! "
4047058,20463981,2014-09-29,2666721,Duane,"Roland, as a host, is why I turn to AirBNB when looking to book an accommodation when traveling. He's warm, creative, artistic, informed, and just plain thoughtful when it comes to hosting guests. His house, well, his house is a very, very fine house that has been lovingly restored and is as exactly as described. Roland opens up his home so that you feel like you're not just renting a room for a night but that you're at home. Take time to sit on the porch in the rocking chair and read a book. Sit out in the back yard and have a bowl of Kashi while listening to the leaves rustle. Watch a movie in the large spacious living room, or as I did, read a book. Or pet Jasper, the cat, who's a talker and really cool. 

My room was exactly as described. (I chose the Green Suite for it's color.) It looks out to the street, which is quiet. There's a large spacious closet in which you can store everything out of site. Plenty of fresh towels & water. Oh, and did I mention that there was a bar of chocolate, castille soap, and water on my pillow when I arrived? The room is breezy and bright, the bed huge and comfy with lots of big pillows. The house is quiet and the other guest were totally respectful of one another's privacy. If you're a fan of architecture, you'll want to really check out the details in the house. There's a bench along the wall, on which you could some personal items, such as a framed picture, if you're there for an extended stay. The house is just that inviting. 

Parking was also very easy in the neighborhood; and Roland's home, most importantly, is located with walking distance of Tangletown, where you'll find Zoka Coffee and Mighty O Donuts as well as one of Ethan Stowell's restaurant. (Yeah! Totally awesome find.) Take an early morning walk around Green Lake, which is one of my favorite spots. This part of Seattle is one of my favorites.

When I return to Seattle, and I will be returning to Seattle, Roland and his home will be my first choice. (I would rearrange my trip dates, if I had to..)
Roland is what makes AirBNB such an amazing experience. 

I met some of the other people in the house while on my stay, and we'd all had the pleasure of Roland's hospitable nature. You just know that when relating the story of Seattle to friends, each of us spoke of Roland from the outset."
4047058,20663369,2014-10-03,21342855,Suri,I feel so lucky that I booked Roland's rooms for my parents during their two-week-long stay in Seattle. The neighborhood is safe and quiet; rooms are tidy and cozy; Roland is considerate and interesting! My parents speak little English but Roland successfully taught them how to use washer and dryer by using body language:) I definitely will recommend this place to my friends when they visit Seattle in (website hidden): Roland's cat Jaspurr is super cute! 
4047058,21295844,2014-10-14,11816317,Christyn,"Our stay with Roland was excellent. We couldn't have asked for a better host, home or neighborhood to experience on our trip the Seattle. 
                           Once we were settled in, Roland gave us an orientation tour, where he told us about the neighborhood, local attractions, and welcomed us to enjoy his TV room, kitchen and beautiful back yard area. He provided coffee, tea, and yougurt as well as some chocolates and water on your pillow. 
There is wonderful little cat, Jasper, who lives here too. He is very friendly and soft. Given the opportunity, he will make a nest in the covers with you and snuggle all day. 
The neighborhood, Wallingford was perfect! Green lake is a quick and beautiful walk from the house and a great place to get in an early morning run before enjoying fresh bagles and coffee in Roland's terrace. There are many local shops, grocery stores,  and coffee shops all within walking distance. As well as a qucick drive to the interstate which makes getting to Capitol Hill or Downtown a quick drive. "
4047058,22166285,2014-10-31,3444252,Lee,Another awesome experience staying with Roland! 
4047058,22973229,2014-11-18,8657276,Gian,"Roland is an ideal host. The experience he provides is a prime example of just how awesome Airbnb can be. The home is beautiful, clean and comfortable. Roland is a passionate, inspiring person and I would stay here again and again! Fantastic location and great vibes. "
4047058,23000698,2014-11-19,8657276,Gian,"See my previous review of Roland's space for details, but in a few words: Awesome, Inspiring, and Awesome. 
:)"
4047058,23561249,2014-12-04,24274599,Brendan,"Our room was exactly as shown in the pictures, everything was very clean. The house was warm and inviting. Roland was very accommodating. Great place to stay for a few days!"
4047058,23868938,2014-12-13,55195,Colleen,Roland's place was really nice and is in a wonderful neighborhood. It was clean and comfortable just like the photos depict. Roland is a nice host and made sure to check in with me periodically to make sure I had what I needed. The location is fantastic as well. It's a stones throw to Green Lake and Wallingford. The new PCC market in Green Lake was a great amenity to have so close. 
4047058,23985623,2014-12-15,20625336,Carlos,"Roland has a nice apartment, had a great comunication with him and he is constantly checking on you!"
4047058,24745328,2015-01-02,21012522,Clare,"The Green Suite is very comfortable, classic, and clean.  The house is in a popular, safe, centrally-located neighborhood in Seattle, so it's easy to get downtown.  I recently stayed at this Greenlake Craftsman for an extended period of time due to construction at my apartment.  The host, Roland, and his cat Jaspurr were great company, and always made me feel at home.  "
4047058,24975907,2015-01-04,17744152,Zoe,Very nice and clean room.  Provides clean towel and shower necessities.  Bottled water and chocolate was a nice touch.  Convenient location.   Roland was friendly and helpful.  Would strongly recommend. 
4047058,25319587,2015-01-12,122112,Sabrina,"Roland was one f the most amazing host, super friendly and making sure you have a good stay. The house is super clean and very elegant feel to it.
We did cook together one night and enjoyed dinner with an othe guest, that is what Airbnb is about"
4047058,26142181,2015-02-04,23129914,Jane,"It's a great place to stay! clean and neat! Roland is very kind, and his cat is so cute and funny! "
4047058,26168277,2015-02-05,20489280,Soren,"My first AirBnB and I'd do it again, and recommend it to a friend!

Roland made for good conversation and a great host - he's thought of everything. The kitchen is stocked from dishes and appliances, tea and cereal, to a gas burner-stove.  I cook all my own food and so brought a dish to reheat but if you needed or wanted to cook, you'd be well equipped here.  There is a collection of tea at the ready and bottled mineral water waiting in the room. The Green Room was clean and uncluttered with a nice view of the neighborhood.  Jasper the cat made for good company. Roland enjoys sharing interesting stories and he had plenty.  He was responsive to my request to raise the temperature a bit at night, which made for a restful night.  I had the opportunity to mingle with his guests but still plenty of quiet rime to myself in both my room and the rest of the house.  
Note: there is a long flight of stairs leading to the house, and the bedrooms are also upstairs. Roland was quick to assist me with one of my bags... But this can be worth knowing ahead of time should you have any challenges with stairs on your good or bad days.
Also worth noting - the house is a 5 minute drive or from the Woodland Park Zoo and the lake.  So, plenty to do just a walk away. "
4047058,26347828,2015-02-09,26383653,Crystal,"Roland was a nice and welcoming host. His home is lovely and is treated as a swanky hostel. His cat Jaspar is gorgeous and sweet. Didn't have a chance to say goodbye but it was indeed a pleasant stay. My only issue was that my belongings were moved without my being there because we had been set up in the wrong room. Other than that, great place."
4047058,26402085,2015-02-11,23595343,Brandie,"Everything was as described, but even better. Roland was welcoming, accommodating and simply a pleasure to be around. The bed was so very cozy! Oh and the large bathtub was a delight to soak in. The place is right next to Green Lake - the perfect place to go for a run- in a quiet neighborhood within easy walking distance to bus stops that will get you anywhere in the city you wish to go. I'll definitely stay here again and recommend it to others.  one more thing - I'm allergic to cats but Roland's didn't affect me at all.
- Brandie   "
4047058,26706762,2015-02-17,294172,Ashe,"Personable host, lovely house with creative appeal. Communication was easy, Roland was great. We had an overall wonderful time staying here and would recommend!

4047058,26934155,2015-02-22,23069006,Cari,"Great room, great location! Roland is a great host and the room and house was perfect for my Seattle visit.  If you are in the Seattle area, I definitely recommend staying in one of Roland's rooms. "
4047058,28564760,2015-03-26,17744152,Zoe,"The location of Roland's place is awesome, close to downtown, walk to green lake.  House is clean & cozy and Roland is such a nice host.  Five stars recommendation! "
4047058,36160944,2015-06-25,17641932,Nate,This was a super comfortable stay and incredibly flexible.  I decided last minute to get a place and Roland was gracious enough to accommodate me last minute.  I love the style and the feel of this place and I think I want to add some of his hosting touches to my own Airbnb listing.
4047058,36248225,2015-06-26,36515581,Jason,"Due to flight delays, I didn't arrive until well after midnight.  Roland was so gracious and left the light on for me.  After a long day it was a pleasure to find such a comfortable and welcoming room.   
The whole place is immaculate and really set up for travelers.  I'll definitely look to stay here again on future visits."
4047058,36327503,2015-06-27,30501869,Juan,"Roland is a wonderful host, was very helpful.  The green room was clean and comfortable.  We greatly enjoyed our stay.  "
4047058,36779465,2015-07-01,3811324,Julie,"Roland's house is a beautiful craftsman in a great location. The house is set up very well for guests and is in a great location - able to walk to restaurants and to green lake. The outdoor space is quite pleasant for morning coffee. Roland is very interesting, friendly and helpful. I highly recommend staying here if you want to experience a neighborhood in Seattle."
4047058,36889766,2015-07-02,10134755,Kelly,"Roland and his home are both ideal airbnb experiences.  He caters his home toward guests and it's a wonderful time staying with him, his very cute and vocal cat and the other travelers from all over the world. I look forward to staying here more. Thanks again for everything Roland!"
4047058,37090137,2015-07-04,35429383,Brandy,"We loved our stay at Roland's.  The bed was extremely comfortable and the room was so sweet and cozy. Roland was very friendly, as were all the guests the night we stayed. The location was perfect for us! We woke up and had a great run around green lake, which is just a few blocks away.  Overall wonderful experience! We would definitely stay again. "
4047058,37195759,2015-07-05,27713840,Mike,"Roland was awesome, he made the stay easy and a great stop over to Vancouver."
4047058,37487879,2015-07-07,5853526,Don,Roland was a great host. His house is located within walking distance to public transportation and great restaurants. He did an excellent job explaining where everything was around the house and how to use everything. The house itself if really nice. It is obvious that he takes care of it and you can tell he has been making improvements. I am willing to bet that it will be even nicer in the future.
4047058,45437912,2015-09-02,41880632,Kyle,Super nice experience. Would totally do it again 
4047058,45848543,2015-09-06,33403354,Eric,"Great place... Roland goes above and beyond to make you feel welcome.  The kitchen and bathrooms were stocked with quality coffee, teas, soaps, towels, etc.  The house is located in a great part of town (walking distance to lakes, bus lines, movie theater, coffee, etc).  The room itself was high-end and comfortable.  Highly recommended.    "
4047058,46451470,2015-09-10,1131640,Ryan,"What an outstanding house! Roland is a great guy and the house is perfect. Best value Wallingford, right next to green lake. If you're reading this, you should already be booking. Personal touches put this place straight over the top. "
4047058,47195552,2015-09-16,2515340,Thomas," This is an incredible place to stay. Roland and James make you feel very welcome to the house. It is a beautiful, quiet oasis in the neighborhood, in walking distance of great restaurants, public transportation and walks. The atmosphere is very friendly and helpful. I loved the time I spend with Roland as well as the quiet time just reading and hanging out. I cannot say enough good things about the house and the host. If you can book a stay here, you will be very satisfied with the entire experience. "
4047058,47440272,2015-09-18,103996,Kaili & Ben,Roland was very welcoming and his place was great. The bed was very comfortable and was right down the street from a great park (went for an awesome run in the morning). 
4047058,48008209,2015-09-22,11776801,Eriko,"It was a very nice experience, staying at Roland's place. Great location. Very clean and well equipped house and a bedroom. Wonderful hospitality by Roland and James. I especially enjoyed talking with Roland at a dining/meeting room. The experience reminded me of the movie, ""My Dinner with Andre"".  "
4047058,48410628,2015-09-26,38333773,Yong,"thanks Roland for his kind guidline to Boeing tour & Rainer Mountain, this is a real clean and warm place you could choose in Seattle."
4047058,48588811,2015-09-27,18865210,Sarah,"The host Roland was awesome and he has a new property manager James which is equally as awesome.  

The place was CLEAN, ORGANIZED, and WELCOMING.  Pretty much the 3 most important things when staying in someones home. 

I would recommend this place to friends and family.  These guys do AirBnB right!   "
4047058,48793452,2015-09-28,43979893,Stephanie,Beautiful house and great welcome! Loved it! 
4047058,50099851,2015-10-09,18415780,Lauren,"Great little BnB in a lovely, safe neighborhood! Roland was great! And my stay here was very pleasant! "
4047058,50234454,2015-10-10,19382134,Erika Kathleen,"The room was amazing! The bed was comfortable and the green room makes you feel at home. James and Roland even put in a Cadbury and Sparkling water for guests :) really appreciated that! In addition, the house is just 5 mins by walking from Green Lake, which is amazing! I only met James once but he is very responsive via email with my requests and concerns. I recommend staying in this house if you love nature :)"
4047058,50669130,2015-10-13,11903264,Lu,"Very cozy home, great design, tidy and modern. Very cozy bed, very quite and beautiful neighborhood. I slept so well after my wandering around the city all day. With so many construction going on in the downtown area, this place provides you the quietness you needed. 

So close to Green Lake, and walking distance to Fremont. Few blocks walk to two major bus lanes, one to UW, and one to downtown. 

Roland is a great host to chat with, very helpful and attentive. 

I would chose to stay at his place again next time i am traveling in Seattle. "
4047058,51195006,2015-10-18,8900743,Adele,The description was accurate as were the directions.  This place was very pretty and quiet.  The host(s) were very open and were able to help with things like directions and where things were. Lovely stay! 
4047058,51931676,2015-10-25,33581039,Nikki,"Everything about my stay at Roland's home was great. This was my third experience using Airbnb, and I have to say it was most likely my favorite. Roland and James were very personable and welcoming. The in house cat was also a delight, lol. I'm allergic to cats, but had absolutely no issues with theirs! The home itself was clean, beautiful, comfortable, and in a nice and quiet location, but also within 15 minutes of downtown. I had a rental car, and parking wasn't an issue at the house. Overall, I absolutely loved staying at this place, and would highly recommend it to others. I plan to come back next year, and will most definitely plan to try and stay here again."
4047058,56247210,2015-12-11,11776801,Eriko,"This was my second stay at Roland's place. It was nice fun stay overall. Roland and James helped me extend my stay in economical way.
Jasper, the cat was lovely addition to the house.
The WALL was great, indeed, Roland!
Thank you so much for your hospitality."
4047058,56538218,2015-12-14,20023211,Rosana,"The place was warm and cozy. Roland made an extra effort to make us feel welcome. Overall, a great experience!"
4047058,57436083,2015-12-26,47291550,Anna,"Roland and James were very friendly. Everything in terms of towels etc was provided. Kitchen was fully equipped. It was very neat and clean. Toilets and baths on first floor was great. On second floor it was neat and tidy but no lock. However, we did not think there was any good place to sit and have our breakfast etc.

4047058,57984858,2015-12-30,23454266,Ellise,"James and Roland have a great and very easy set up with everything you need. Such a nice relaxing stay even for just one night. The home is very cozy, clean, and warm. The big bathtub was pretty great too! Thanks for the stay."
4047058,58098957,2015-12-31,49616508,De'Arius,Roland was a cool . He showed us around & gave us our space . His place was nice & clean as seen in the photos . Overall my time & experience for the first time was great ! Thanks Rowland . 
7368599,43129727,2015-08-17,40070493,Jamie,"Conan's house was very clean and spacious. There was 6 guests in our party and there was more than enough room for us all. Everything seemed new, or at least very well kept. Conan was easy to communicate with and responsive to inquiries. I would definitely stay here again!"
7368599,43459722,2015-08-19,34312648,Jamie,"Conan was a great host! Due to an unfortunate event, my group and I (total of 8 people) had to find a place to stay ASAP. His fast replies helped us resolve our remaining days in Seattle. His house was clean and it was perfect for the 8 of us. I would definitely contact Conan if I ever visit Seattle again!"
7368599,46241510,2015-09-08,7282092,Martin And Jessika,"We spent a very peaceful evening at Conan's house. The area is residential and only about 15 minutes drive away from the city core. We were a group of 7 adults and there was more than enough room and beds to comfortably accommodate all of us. There is a driveway for parking, and check in was simple, as Conan was good with communication over Airbnb. We just had to make our own beds, where the sheets were conveniently placed in cubby holes in each room. The only risk is that the state of the house upon check in is based on how well the previous group of guests clean up after themselves. Conan did send a message regarding the cleanliness though, so I'm sure he would have rectified the situation had it not been clean. We would stay here again :)"
3303376,15072591,2014-07-01,16995771,Eric,"Georgetown is a fascinating little neighbourhood. The Mexican and pizzaria provided some of the best meals ever... at VERY reasonable rates. Old buildings are great. local coffee shop, musix bar, pinball shop, etc. And the weekend market; trailler full of mysteries! Definetly worth exploring this neighbourhood. The actual place you will stay at is basic but great (especially the red barry white). 2 noteworthy aspects though: the building is quiet, but the airport near by is not (not a problem for me, but might be for some as planes past near by), and get to know the bus system (including the tunnels). Bonus, Angielena was very accomodating!"
3303376,15556462,2014-07-11,16759906,Rich,"This stay, will stay for a lifetime. This historic and beautiful building is full of some of the most beautiful culture, warmth and love I've ever had the privilege of experiencing. Angielena is truly a host like no other and a person like no other. She exemplifies the most kind heart and her smile is enough to make any not so good day a great one. Inspiration flows in this home and it's immediately apparent and easy to see why so many artists thrive here. Georgetown is rich in culture, art and creative minds. This is a must stay if one is wanting to experience the Seattle you hear about but no longer see in downtown. Our room was minimal and bright. Our furniture was either historic and or handmade and it was all so beautiful. The luxurious bathroom is definitely there to spoil and provide one of the most romantic and rewarding showers. We were truly blessed and relieved to come across and stay in such an amazing place. Not to mention the other tenants and neighboring business owners who are surely becoming close and life long friends. No better place to be in Seattle and has made the Pacific North West the base for adventure we've been looking for. Thank You very much Angielena. "
3303376,16136768,2014-07-22,16883416,David,"We came to visit Seattle, and Angielena was perfect as a host. She shows you how everything works in the building upon your arrival, which was very useful, as well as transport tips to the city. The house is located in Georgetown, 15 minutes by bus to downtown. Georgetown is also quite interesting due to its hipster mood. Angielena also gave us some very good tips for breakfast in the surroundings. The room was clean and comfortable. The washroom is shared, but clean,  and inside its best hidden secret, a spectacular shower!!! :) "
3303376,16321375,2014-07-25,18112342,Ben,I really enjoyed staying here. It was exactly as pictured and had a great vibe. The area was pretty cool as well. Thank you for such a great first airbnb experience Angielena. I will be back in three months! 
3303376,16523863,2014-07-28,2038253,Latishia,"Angielena was an amazing host. This was the first time that we stayed in a communal airbnb situation and were a little nervous but it truly was an amazing experience. Angielena greeted us at the door and even helped us with our bags after getting off a delayed flight, she was a welcome ray of sunshine after a long night. We truly appreciated her being accommodating of our needs and even allowing us to store our suitcases on the last day as we had another late flight. The community that Angielena and the artists have fostered is very warm and welcoming. And I cannot forget the ""Barry White"" bathroom and shower which was absolutely life changing, it has definitely spoiled us for all other showers. The only downside was that our room got quite a lot of sunshine first thing in the morning which was not ideal for sleeping in so I would recommend bringing a sleeping mask or some thicker curtains ;). Thank you so much for everything!!"
3303376,17052894,2014-08-06,17269187,Benjamin,"Loved it! Thanks to Angielena, we had a wonderful stay. Georgetown is such an awesome place. Great food, beer, art and of course great people. The room was perfect and the shower was very relaxing. Will definitely be back. "
3303376,17245211,2014-08-09,18490927,Judith,"We enjoyed our stay at the Georgetown Arts Collective. Its a very characterful area of reclaimed industrial units about 15 mins bus ride from town. We liked it a lot and its really great if you like art, music and cool bars but its not for everyone as there is nothing else there. 
It is next to Boeing Field so there are loads of planes landing right over your head and also it is next to Highway 5 and several freight train lines.
Our room had no aircon and was too hot and very noisy. If you could keep the windows shut it would be fine but that wasn't an option. 
I think there are some lovely rooms there with aircon but ours was very sparse with no furniture except a sofa and bed and a hanging rail. To be fair the airbnb description does convey the industrial feel.
The best feature of the building is the shower although it is shared so not easy to get into sometimes.
Angielina was lovely although we only saw her on check in and didn't see or speak to anyone else over our 2 days. It would have been nice to get to know some of the artists or other guests but there are no communal spaces and all doors were shut. 
There are some very cool places in Georgetown. I recommend breakfast at the Hangar Cafe next to the airfield. It was excellent, both food and service and also cocktails and food at la Cantina. Once a month they have Art Attack which looks like its worth a visit."
3303376,18815213,2014-09-01,19182185,Ben,"Angielena was a warm and welcoming host and was very accommodating with our lessthan ideal arrival time. The building is absolutely lovely and the room is very comfortable and private. The monster shower (8 heads!) is a joy and we had no problems accessing the bathroom even though we were sharing the building with the other guests.

We did find that there was a bit of noise from the nearby airfield as we had our window open. It wasn't loud enough to ruin our sleep but if you're a light sleeper you'll want to keep the window shut.

Georgetown is a great area and we spent a couple of fun evenings in the local establishments. Access to Downtown Seattle is great with regular buses that take you there in about 15 minutes."
3303376,19047600,2014-09-05,20201609,John,"Angielena was an enthusiastic, helpful host who certainly helped me find the best Seattle and Georgetown, in particular, offer.  She was readily available when I was able to check in and her tour of the arts center was fantastic.  I highly recommend taking her advice on local activities and especially the local food scene.

The room within the arts center was small, modern, and very comfortable.  I slept well every night.

The highlight of the arts center was certainly the Barry White bathroom.  Check it out.

I highly recommend Angielena and her accommodations."
3303376,30783783,2015-04-27,21339015,Srijith,"What can i say! I was absolutely thrilled to stay here after reading the reviews and was not disappointed at all. The room I stayed was good enough for me and was maintained very clean. I don't have to say anything about the bathroom as you would have seen reviews of it from the other reviewers, nevertheless its amazing with the many shower heads. Taking a bath here everyday is a vacation in itself :) 

Enough about the room. The building hosts many beautiful artists. I attended one of the ""Art Attacks"" that happen once in a month and it was great to see all the arts by these wonderful people. If you are an art buff, you will love it. If you are not, you will still love it!

The place is close to an airport, so you would hear planes zoom by which did not cause any inconvenience to me as I wouldn't hear it in my room. 

I stayed here for 35 days and had to use the washer/dryer. Its pretty free throughout the week, may be a little busy on the weekends. Plan your washing/drying on a thursday or early sat/sun. 

There are plenty of restaurants close by. A highly rated mexican place, couple of diners, another highly rated pizza place...etc. Oh, and also the tasty ""shawarma"" truck!

Angielena is a delightful host. We had so many awesome conversations about culture, architecture..etc etc. She is immensely helpful in case you have any issues and is only a text message or a phone call away.

I made a lot of friends here. Angielena is one of them as was an awesome artist  (Francis) who lives next door. He was friendly and I definitely miss so many conversations we had. He even gifted me an art he made and I couldn't say how much amazed I was with how good the world still is!

I kind of miss staying here but the next time I am in Seattle, I would bring my whole family. My wife can't wait to actually see the place about which I told her so many stories.

So, my final feedback for you folks thinking about staying here.
 ""Go for it! You won't regret it"".

We went to Seattle during a heat wave and she even put an air conditioning unit in the window when she felt that our room was too hot!  The location of this place is great, right across the street from the bus stop which takes you into downtown Seattle for $2.75.  The neighborhood felt safe, lots of families walking around, but also plenty of young single people.  Only a $12 lyft from downtown Seattle as well. "
3303376,39641561,2015-07-25,6743824,Kathy,"Room was comfortable, air conditioning offered but wasn't needed. Angielina gave excellent directions how to get there, met us, gave us the grand tour. Bathroom was quite elegant, and there were at least two other bathrooms to use if necessary. We enjoyed the back porch.
Neighborhood is busy, lively early at night, noise mostly from planes at Boeing Field, but we slept well.
Angielina was very helpful. She contacted us the morning after everyone there heard a disturbance in the neighborhood late at night and explained what had happened.
Lots of good coffee and breakfast spots in the neighborhood.
We'd definitely stay here again."
3303376,40803354,2015-08-02,38411366,Nathan,"Angielena is a lovely host. She made me feel very welcome and took the time to give me a thorough tour around the building when I arrived. My room was light, sunny and tastefully decorated, and the bed was very comfortable. Georgetown is a funky suburb with lots of bars, restaurants close by and an easy 15-20 min bus ride to downtown Seattle. I enjoyed my stay here and would recommend to others. Thanks Angielena!"
3303376,41131454,2015-08-04,38586350,Ulrike,Angielena ist sehr nett! Das Zimmer war sehr schön und sauber! Das Haus ist sehr originell und in einer tollen Wohngegend! 
3303376,41818202,2015-08-09,38614545,Nicola,The facility was beautiful and Angielena was a wonderful hostess! We had a great experience! 
3303376,43282141,2015-08-18,7500703,Margherita,"A very particular and artistic place to stay in: we loved it. Georgetown is beautifull, we would have never discovered it if it wasn't for Angielena's room. It is not in downtown Seattle - it's a 25 min bus ride from there -  but it's not a big deal: for the evenings you have excellent restaurants, breweries and bars right near the house. Great experience!"
3303376,44360506,2015-08-25,23187542,Katie & Hagan,"We had such a wonderful time staying at Angielena's! The location is great, in a really charming historic neighborhood--it's easy to get to downtown and the airport. Awesome restaurants, bars and coffee shops are everywhere.

The building is its own lovely community, with interesting artists and Airbnb guests to meet and chat with. It's a great combination of historic charm and modern convenience. Everything is super clean and, and there are several bathrooms, so even though there's not a private loo, there's always one available. The back deck is a great place to hang out, and there's a vintage trailer shopping mall in the back on weekends. There's a well-stocked kitchen and our room was very comfy. 

Angielena is a fabulous host, she's created a really great experience for guests at this very cool property. We'd 100% recommend staying here."
3303376,46184621,2015-09-08,14989877,Jaqueline,This place was great!! We totally enjoyed our stay here. And we definitely plan on coming back! 
3303376,47286021,2015-09-17,4611856,Sandra,Angielana was very welcoming and friendly and offered clear information both about the rental and the area.  She is enthusiastic and friendly and is a wonderful host.  The building is very beautiful and there are some great people using the space as artists and longer term guests.  This is a great location right in Georgetown and there are some nice shops and restaurants nearby as well as good transit to the rest of Seattle.
1483944,7050211,2013-09-04,829596,Carlos,"Great place. Very close to all the buses needed to get around town: Greenlake, UDistrict, Capitol Hill, Downtown. 

Big and comfortable bathroom and bed. Very private. Betty cooked us a very tasty breakfast."
1483944,8757118,2013-11-16,1366459,Laura,"This accommodation is as advertised-- peceful, clean,  spacious, and nicely decorated, making it a great value.  I loved the small living room outside the bedroom that was solely for my use.   Betty is a gracious, caring, and knowledgeable host, a world traveller, who will make you feel welcome and do her best to make you comfortable during your stay."
1483944,9422866,2013-12-28,2027939,Susan,"A most enjoyable and peaceful stay. Thank you so much, Betty!"
1483944,10447026,2014-02-19,3942417,Gregg,"A wonderful host with a great breakfast both days.  The room was clean, quiet and better than what the listing stated.  I would confidently send others to stay at this property and will ask to go back again when in Seattle.  I was able to easily get to the bus and downtown without any hassle.  Green Lake was fun to walk around and the restaurants nearby were great.  Thanks for a nice stay."
1483944,10551174,2014-02-24,5149551,Janice,Betty is the absolute best.  She was very accommodating when we needed to arrive a few days early and could not have been more helpful or kinder. She is also a fabulous chef and we really enjoyed our breakfasts and chatting with her.   The room was very comfortable and everything was spotless.  A great place to stay.  THANKS BETTY!!!
1483944,10930365,2014-03-13,12777582,Jennifer,I had a great stay and look forward to coming back. Betty was a gracious host. 
1483944,11157802,2014-03-23,12862660,Henry,"Betty and her son, Frankie, were very gracious hosts.  The bedroom was large and cozy.  We had access to a large bathroom and sitting room.  Betty provided us with a healthy lite breakfast for each of the days that we stayed with her.  She was very helpful in sharing and recommending some Seattle sites for us to explore.  They were very easy to talk to and we enjoyed our wonderful stay with them.   They both truly made you feel at home!"
1483944,11460534,2014-04-03,13649276,Judy,"Awesome stay - private, comfortable, delicious breakfasts - all with the best hospitality!  Thanks for a great experience, Betty!"
1483944,12040449,2014-04-21,14459090,Richard,"Betty is very sweet and kind! I felt welcomed the moment I arrived, and she is conscious about the quality of food she prepares. I now have a really wonderful Friend and a place to stay when I travel to Seattle. Thank you!"
1483944,13169740,2014-05-20,4503218,Marine,"Staying at Betty place was a real pleasure! She is a great host, really polite, and considerate. We were made to feel right at home. 

About the flat, it was tidy and very clean. Moreover it's a great location to explore Seattle. So, everything was perfect.

Well, we definitely recommend anyone to stay at this place, and meet Betty and his son!"
1483944,13523248,2014-05-29,10400337,Jasmin,"Betty was a really nice host! The room was clean, tidy and private - everything you want! Perfect place to stay and if you want you are always invited to do stuff with the family."
1483944,14690554,2014-06-24,3329256,Rick,"Betty was a gracious host who made me me feel right at home.  The bedroom and sitting room were clean and roomy, as was the private bathroom.  I enjoyed the delicious ""Dutch Baby"" Betty served for breakfast, and appreciated her home's convenient location near many places of interest.  "
1483944,15328081,2014-07-07,15765416,Martin,"Betty's place was wonderful. It was well organized, spacious, and quiet. Betty was the best host you could ask for. Her breakfast was tasty, and she was generous with her time and space. She made our fourth of July weekend so much fun!"
1483944,16508251,2014-07-28,1150464,New,Our short one night stay at Betty's home was very pleasant. Betty was responsive and very accommodating to our late check-in and early checkout... She even had a healthy breakfast for us!  The home is in a safe residential neighborhood and conveniently located for easy freeway access!  
1483944,16630355,2014-07-30,6953537,Leysan,"Betty is an awesome host, very kind and attentive to guest. The stay includes breakfast, which was cooked very well.
The room is very clean, comfortable, house has all the necessary amenities. So all in all I really enjoyed staying here."
1483944,16892362,2014-08-04,13867978,Marlene,"A great base location for our sty inSeattle.  Betty was helpful with recommendations for places to eat ant things to see, as well as parking hints.  The room was comfortable and a nutritious and tasty breakfast each day was a real treat.  We enjoyed our morning conversations while Betty prepared our breakfast.  Be sure to ask her about a ""wheat grass shot"" or one of her healthy smoothies-- both were surprisingly delicious!"
1483944,17522730,2014-08-13,17208725,Cécile,"Betty et son fils nous ont accueillis avec beaucoup de naturel, comme si nous étions chez nous. Toutes les informations pratiques (wifi, clé, accessibilité) sont données clairement dans la description du logement, ce qui rend les choses plus faciles. Nous avons eu accès à la chambre située au rez-de-chaussée ainsi qu'à la salle de bain et au salon attenants. La chambre de son fils se trouve également à ce niveau. Un autre couple logeait à l'étage où se trouve également la cuisine. Nous avons apprécié les petits-déjeuners de Betty et les conversations matinales avec elle ainsi qu'avec l'autre couple. 
La maison est située dans un endroit très accessible en bus. Il est facile de s'y rendre depuis l'aéroport ou bien la gare ferroviaire. Le  centre-ville est également très proche en transport en commun (ligne E). Le quartier est extrêmement calme et sûr. C'est un quartier pavillonnaire proche du Green Lake où l'on trouve des restaurants et des commerces (env. 5 min à pied). Le trajet en bus jusqu'au centre-ville donne une magnifique vue du Union Lake depuis le pont qui le traverse.  En somme, nous avons apprécié cette adresse et son hôte qui ont rendu notre séjour à Seattle des plus agréables. "
1483944,17594998,2014-08-14,19546241,Allison,Betty was a good host and was willing to work with us on our travel time. We came into town for a late baseball game. The room was clean and inviting. She made a delicious breakfast in the morning for everyone.
1483944,17647631,2014-08-15,18836941,Alden,"We had a wonderful stay at Betty's home. The bed was very comfortable, and she made us an AMAZING breakfast in the morning with delicious fresh fruit. We wish that we could have stayed longer!"
1483944,17780791,2014-08-17,6854001,Xu,"We had a great stay in Betty's house for 2 nights. Betty is so nice, her breakfasts are so wonderful. Betty's home is quiet and comfort. The room is very clean. The travelers we met at Betty's home are also very nice. It's really a beautiful memory in US. Thanks, Betty!"
1483944,18249421,2014-08-24,779897,Cheryl,"This is the first real B&B that I've booked through airbnb, and it was lovely. Betty is generous and accommodating, and her home is bright and peaceful. We enjoyed getting to know Betty over her healthful breakfasts - a great way to start each day. We would stay here again."
1483944,18596194,2014-08-28,1211994,Shuchi,"Our stay at Betty's home was wonderful. The house is located at the end of a very peaceful residential street. The room and bathroom were clean, well stocked and both the bed and the couch were very comfortable. And the breakfast! Betty is a superb cook and everything is organic and/or homemade. Do ask for her delicious chia porridge topped with homemade almond milk and a wonderful assortment of fruits and nuts! Betty makes you feel very welcome and it was lovely to chat with her over breakfast each morning. I would not hesitate to stay here again."
1483944,18693178,2014-08-30,5369633,Dennis,Betty and her son were great hosts and the breakfast was awesome.  
1483944,18846378,2014-09-01,10296009,Jessica,"Betty and her son were fantastic an gracious hosts. The room was great- comfy beds, big bathroom and lots of natural light. 

The neighborhood is quiet and peaceful. Her place is easily accessible by transit that let's you get anywhere in the city in a quick manner. 

And her breakfast was delicious. She's a pleasure to chat with in the morning. I couldn't recommend her place enough!"
1483944,19005914,2014-09-04,13242462,Rudy,Betty and her son were great hosts. They made me feel at home from day one. The room was spacious and very clean. Their lovely house is located in a residential area north of Downtown Seattle.  No need to rent a car. Public transportation is pretty reliable. I'd love to stay at Betty's again in the future.
1483944,19182844,2014-09-07,20985621,Ryan,"My wife and I wanted a place to stay close to all our favorite Green Lake/ Ballard stomping grounds before we relocate for work. Betty was quick to respond (same day) and host us for the weekend. As our first AirBNB booking, we couldn't have asked for a better experience. The bed was comfortable, the bathroom was clean and right off our room, and it was quiet so we got plenty of sleep. Being located at the end of a dead end made it safe and private but just minutes from the main roads. We would definitely stay again with Betty if we come to town for a visit. "
1483944,19558069,2014-09-14,20822236,Sarah,"I had a nice experience, never got the chance to actually meet Betty.  The room/bathroom were clean. The room was a little cold for my liking. "
1483944,20571012,2014-10-01,1392115,Robert,"Listing was accurate, yes.  Neighborhood pleasant,  near North Seattle Community College and I-5.  For the recommended exit off I-5, do not find yourself on the express lane, however."
1483944,21794388,2014-10-24,21968548,Clement,"Betty greeted me and showed me my room, bathroom etc. She was pleasant and welcoming and the bedroom, bathroom and common areas were clean and well kept.  I was just there for 10 hours so had relatively little interaction. Place was on cul de sac and in quiet, pleasant neighborhood.  Very easy to reach from I-5."
1483944,21914544,2014-10-26,16342997,Cynthia,"Neighborhood was very nice, and location easy to find.  We found a wonderful Italian restaurant nearby to have dinner while waiting to connect with our host."
1483944,23107834,2014-11-23,3118074,Edith,"My husband and I stayed with Betty and Frankie for a month while work was being done on our house. She is friendly, communicative, and laid-back - I feel really lucky we found a place to stay nearby where we felt comfortable and could take the bus to work easily.  A month is a long time to be away from home!

Another bonus is that private room is quite and has plenty of storage space (which was perfect for our long term stay.) There is a large, bright kitchen for guests who may want to make their own meals. Betty is an excellent cook herself - I regret not being much of a breakfast person because I enjoyed what I did taste of her cooking/baking :)

I should also mention that the area is quaint and beautiful - I enjoyed several walks in the neighborhood. "
1483944,23304694,2014-11-28,2916925,Margaret,"Betty was a wonderful host and her place was lovely, clean, and comfortable! The location was perfect for us because family was just across the street. I should add that Betty's breakfasts were great and she was savvy about accommodating the needs of my gluten sensitive daughter without blinking an eye! We readily recommend this warm and friendly home. "
1483944,23394695,2014-11-30,13710922,Diane,"Betty's hospitality started with checking for food/breakfast preferences prior to our arrival, and continued to accomodating our arrival and departure times. Her home was located in a quiet easily accessible neighborhood that was so convenient for the things we needed to do in downtown Seattle. Our room was lovely-clean, quiet, and comfortable and had everything we needed. I would definitely love to return if the opportunity arises!"
1483944,24434205,2014-12-28,16342997,Cynthia,Very welcoming home and hostess! Super comfortable room and great breakfast. It's home away from home for me; have stayed twice now and will again.
1483944,25516548,2015-01-18,16342997,Cynthia,Home away from home...Betty is like family. It was our third stay there and we will continue to return.
1483944,26576310,2015-02-15,27603400,Mikaela,"Betty was a wonderful host! Both her and her son were very welcoming and open. If we wanted space they would give it to us, but if we wanted to interact with them they were great conversationalists. And Betty's chia porridge was delicious, unlike anything I've had before. Overall great stay!"
1483944,27094041,2015-02-25,736751,Rachel,"Betty's place was perfect. Exactly what I needed at the end of a busy day. Quiet, private and very comfortable. The room is spacious and bright.  Betty is a lovely person whom I regret I did not have enough time to spend chatting but she was very sweet to understand. 
She is a wonderful host and makes everyone feel at home.  I look forward to returning in June with my husband."
1483944,28551872,2015-03-25,29924825,Gary,"Betty greeted us and provided the things we needed for a night there.  Her son actually originally let us in as she was at work, and he is very sweet as well.  After walking to find Green Lake on our own and failing, he helped us with the simple directions to it.  We totally enjoyed walking around the lake and having dinner at a local chowder house along the lake.  Very relaxing after a day of driving!  In the morning she made us and the other guest there a yummy chia porridge breakfast.  She was busy getting ready for the day making her raw foods and we felt like we got a great education in that as well.  Her sweet open personality and gracious hospitality just made us feel comfortable and cozy.  At this point we're thrilled to have found Airbnb and this way of traveling to see our sons."
1483944,29249791,2015-04-06,21920721,Mechthild,"Wonderful place to stay - nice and cosy room and a great host! Betty, again many thanks for your warm welcome and the marvellous breakfasts you surprised us with every morning!! I do hope we'll be able to come back again!"
1483944,29986379,2015-04-15,13479795,Judy,The listing was just as described by others.  It's a very comfortable home in a good quiet neighborhood.  Betty is a very good host.  She made a warm and healthy breakfast every morning for us.  It is a relaxed and warm home setting that we definitely recommend.
1483944,30704754,2015-04-26,30480867,Gwen,"The room was comfy, the bed more so.  Pillows are key for me and they were great as well.  My Daughter slept on the futon and like that as well.  Betty is very sweet and charming.  Enjoyed our stay!"
1483944,31263026,2015-05-03,12741150,Kim,"Quiet street, clean room. Keys where not where they were supposed to be at check-in. Spacious driveway area for parking."
1483944,32252318,2015-05-16,1392115,Robert,"We both consider this airbnb one of the best in North Seattle.  Our third stay here.  The host(ess) is warm, friendly, helpful, flexible.  She truly cares about her guests.  Breakfasts rate an A+, morning after morning.  Food is healthy and nutricious.
"
1483944,32759386,2015-05-21,27077164,Ying,"Betty is an amazing and gracious host! She tended to all of our needs, especially with our 1 year old. The neighborhood is very quiet and within walking distance to shops and parks. We came at a beautiful time with all of the flowers blooming. We definitely recommend Betty and using Airbnb again!"
1483944,32949461,2015-05-23,26136369,Elizabeth,"Betty made it super easy for us to ""check in"" at the house even though we were unsure of what time traffic would let us arrive. We stayed in the room closest to the downstairs entrance, which was perfect since my roommate and I came home late from dinner. Betty is wonderful and very hospitable. She even offered to cook us breakfast! The neighborhood is lovely, quiet, and super close to Green Lake, where there's a great walking/running path. Would definitely stay here again. "
1483944,33509108,2015-05-29,30738187,Abdullah,"It was a great experience. Betty was so nice. She made delicious dishes for breakfast. The room was organized and comfortable. The neighborhood was quiet and safe. In general, this place is recommended."
1483944,34096915,2015-06-04,33758466,Andrea,"The room is nice and the bathroom fine. Breakfast was great and Betty is easygoing and friendly. If you are going to bed before 10 or 11 pm, you should know that you can hear a lot of what is happening elsewhere in the house, including voices and footsteps.  We stayed with our baby so were in bed pretty early. Overall the experience was good. "
1483944,34935884,2015-06-14,736751,Rachel,Betty has hosting down to a science. We were very comfortable and the house is clean and lovely. But it is her sense of hospitality that comes through loud and clear. We truly enjoyed our stay.  Highly recommend this location which is a short walk to the lake and an easy bus ride to the city center. 
1483944,36340381,2015-06-27,29673550,Yuxuan,Betty人非常好，还给我们做非常丰盛的早餐。房间很干净，晚上有很安静，交通方便，而且不远就是翠湖公园，真的非常不错。有朋友去的话一定要推荐这。
1483944,37188864,2015-07-05,16886053,Jessica,"Betty was very friendly and sweet! We stayed for a week and she cooked great breakfast for us every morning, and they are so yummy! Betty was also very generous and would share a lot of stuff with us. The room downstairs gets a little hot as we were in ""the hottest summer"" in Seattle history, but if you open the window cool air gets in and that will make you feel comfortable. Best to have two people in this nice room.

I highly recommend Betty's place. Staying with a great host was a wonderful experience."
1483944,37703554,2015-07-09,36669139,Bizeng,"Betty has a warmly heart,  and served delicious breakfast. The room was nice and clean, it was convenient to  take bus  to downtown and airport. We lived there for three happy days with betty, thanks."
1483944,38200219,2015-07-13,27446692,Yaxun,It was a very pleasant experience staying here. Everything is perfect and clean. The host will even prepare breakfast for us. We are very happy that we stayed here.
1483944,39298920,2015-07-22,35807674,Dennis,"Betty gave us a warm welcome but gave us privacy when needed. The neighbourhood was quiet and had eclectic houses to look at.  The park nearby was great for walking, swimming, and we even saw a play. Because we had a car, and  she was conveniently located near two major arteries of the city,  we could get around easily. She provided travel information when needed and was kind and respectful.   At one point it was really hot and the air conditioning was a great relief.
Her breakfasts were something to look forward to.  Fresh juice, waffles, omelates, fruit and we learned about raw eating.    I  also liked the separate entrance and the bathroom to ourselves.  The room was clean and spacious.  It gave us everything we needed for our stay in Seattle.  "
1483944,39949061,2015-07-27,35093946,Phil,Betty was very friendly and helpful. She cooked some very good breakfasts and made us feel welcome. The location was great as we were able to catch a bus downtown so we could leave our vehicle at her place. We would definitely recommend this B & B!
1483944,45365733,2015-09-02,9200995,Marilyn,"My wife and I stayed at Betty’s B&B for the month of August. We stayed in the first floor bedroom, which has its own bath. She also has an upstairs room to offer. 



There are many good things to be said about this place, not the least of which is Betty herself. Like any good host, she is very helpful and hospitable. But more than that, she is unfailingly cheerful and friendly and does her best to accommodate reasonable requests. In addition, she prepares wonderful breakfasts for her guests, up until 8:30 AM. These vary from day to day but are always tasty and healthful. 



The house itself is relatively new, on a very quiet residential street and close to bus stops for buses (the 16 and the 48) that go downtown, to the U-District, Ballard or Wallingford. It is less than a mile walk from the north end of Green Lake.  



The kitchen, like the living room, is a shared room. It is well-equipped and roomy. If you’re planning a long-term stay, like we did, or plan to use the kitchen to cook in, you may find that you need to ask Betty to make space in the fridge and on a cupboard shelf for you. When asked, she was more than cooperative. Another thing about the kitchen, which is on the second floor, is that it is adjacent to a wrap-around patio. This is one of the nicest features of the house. There is a hot tub on the patio and numerous bird feeders. The house has a screen of trees most of the way around, which lends it a feeling of semi-privacy. 



The bed in our downstairs room was adequate. It has one window. It lacks bed stands next to the bed, as well as a TV, but one is available in the living room upstairs. There is ample closet space to hang clothes in and a good-sized chest of drawers. There were not enough clothes hangers, so we purchased some ourselves. The downstairs bedroom has its own bathroom but it is not en-suite. The bathroom has cupboard storage and a roomy shower stall but no tub. 



All in all, Betty’s house is a good choice for someone on a budget who wants to stay in a residential north Seattle neighborhood and does not mind using shared facilities."
1483944,46002011,2015-09-07,41164145,Erin,Betty was a wonderful host. We had breakfast our first morning and it was so good!  Easy walk to the express bus on Aurora which got us downtown quickly and cost much less than parking would have.
4256558,25505686,2015-01-18,24937452,Chris,"Nice apartment, well placed for the city and also trips out - parking makes it super convenient. Clean and well presented."
2970666,13691965,2014-06-02,14798963,Lazar,"This is a great apartment in the perfect location in Seattle. My wife and my 4 year old son stayed there for 7 nights. The apartment was very modern, clean and fully equipped with everything. Autumn was a great host and very helpful with everything. I would highly recommend this place and Autumn as a host!"
2970666,15142525,2014-07-03,15722161,Nealon,This is a great apartment and listed just as described. It's a great location on Capitol Hill for those who already know Seattle. But it has lots of info in the house. The instructions throughout the house were great and made the unit very easy to stay at and enjoy.
2970666,15758637,2014-07-15,6063540,Alex,My friends and I were in Seattle for a week. This was a lovely place to stay. Very updated. Has everything you need. Plenty of towels and sheets. Plenty of things in the kitchen. The outdoor balcony was fun and very nice. We had an amazing time here and would definitely stay here again next time I come to Seattle!!!
2970666,15934963,2014-07-18,872754,Kenny,Nicely designed apartment and great location. Was a great stay.
2970666,18629206,2014-08-29,19626405,育馨,非常乾淨，跟照片也一模一樣。Autumn人很好，只可惜和我們訂的房間是不同的雖然很像。(以致最後一天才發現) 但如果日後還要住Seattle，我們還是會選擇這裡！
2970666,19479195,2014-09-13,16261910,Brian,"Clean place, responsive owner. No issues at all."
2970666,20233385,2014-09-26,2757754,Johannes,"Perfectly located apartment in one of Seattle's hippest districts. You are close to some cool bars and cafés and some great shopping. 

The apartment is very nice and comfy and has everything you are looking for.

Thanks again to our host Autumn. She was very supportive and had an answer to all our questions and helped us have a perfect stay in Seattle. 

Would definitely go there again!"
2970666,20432525,2014-09-29,155246,Maria,"We loved the location of the apartment and it was so clean and comfortable.  Autumn was a wonderful host, making sure we knew everything we needed for our stay and also offering us tips/recommendations on what's around us. We would gladly book this place again and encourage others to stay here as well!"
2970666,21587864,2014-10-20,6200952,Yi-Jou,Excellent location!  Clean and comfortable.  I'll be looking Autumn up for future visits.
2970666,21948002,2014-10-27,13271311,Janine,"Great location, comfortable bed, as shown. Thanks! "
2970666,22326276,2014-11-03,9237878,Steve,"Autumn was a building owner's dream property manager.  She knew everything pertinent about the unit, the property and the neighborhood.  SHe told us helpful hints to make our stay easier.  She took care to answer every one of our questions we asked to get settled… on our first meeting with her and in followup phone calls we had.  I had the feeling we could have asked her anything and she would have known the right answer on the spot.

The unit was exactly like the photographs showed it to be… spacious, well appointed without being crowded with stuff, with a nice view of the downtown.  It was also quiet within the building, which had a few units.

The neighborhood was familiar to me and I loved it.  Cap Hill is a great place to call home, whether for a week or a lifetime.  Great shopping, restaurants, and parks, as well as good transportation links."
2970666,22775947,2014-11-14,22290971,Charlie,"I had a great experience renting this apartment from Autumn.  She was prompt in meeting me to check in and very helpful in explaining the apartment and area.

The apartment was perfect for my needs.  Modern and spacious, with a great balcony, I would highly recommend this apartment to friends and family.  The pictures do a great job highlighting the quality and feel of the apartment.  There was construction between 7:30 and 3:30 every weekday at the apartment project next door, however Autumn let me know this when I first inquired about the apartment to make sure I was okay with it.

The apartment is in a great area of Capitol Hill as well, just blocks away from Broadway and Olive, but still tucked away on a secluded side street.  Highly recommended!"
2970666,25634792,2015-01-21,4158513,Keller,Beautiful place and a great location. Highly recommended!
2970666,26015280,2015-02-01,12807393,Antonio,"Amazing stay. Great location and close to major Seattle attractions. Cool, clean and safe. Highly recommended."
2970666,26985270,2015-02-23,13079204,Evan,Gorgeous apartment in a fantastic neighborhood. Perfect airbnb experience. 
2970666,27729925,2015-03-10,11457634,Annie,Great neighbourhood!  The condo was fresh and nicely decorated.  All of our needs were met.  Super comfortable bed.  Next door construction was a bit of a surprise. Would stay here again!
2970666,28469823,2015-03-24,24522171,Ellis,"We had a wonderful stay here during our trip to Seattle. The apartment was just as described, with all the things one needs to feel at home. We loved the neighborhood too!

Autumn was super friendly and helpful during our stay. Very accommodating. She gave us some great recomendations."
2970666,28713016,2015-03-29,1376942,Ligia,"Autumn was a great host, very friendly and easy to contact. The apartment was exactly like the pictures, clean and in a convenient location. Overall a great experience!"
2970666,28943216,2015-04-01,3832615,Lorna,"We felt quite at home.  Autumn was a very responsive, knowledgeable and great host.  The information listed was quite accurate, this place was very central to everything....within 10-15 minutes of the all the sites we wanted to visit, EMP museum, Pikes Market, and International District. "
2970666,29665944,2015-04-11,9906200,Harold,"We had a great time in Seattle in Autumn's apartment. Autumn was a great host, she was very welcoming, with lots of great information, and responsive to all our requests. The apartment was in a great location, close to a ton of neighborhood amenities. 

The only complaint would be in regards to construction that was happening next door, but we understand this was out of Autumn's control.

All in all, we had a great stay!"
2970666,30109880,2015-04-17,10827446,Gabe,"I had an excellent stay at this 1-BR apartment. Autumn was an excellent host.. she was very accommodating by meeting me late at night for a late checkin, and she gave me great recommendations on local restaurants, coffee shops, etc. The property was also fantastic.. very nice quality and a wonderful location, very close to all the best that Capitol Hill has to offer. I'd absolutely recommend Autumn & her properties to any friends or family."
2970666,30392191,2015-04-21,28831141,Katie,"Our stay here was great! Autumn was very responsive, communicating with us before our trip. The apartment was very nice and clean. It was a great location, not too far from downtown and in a really fun, interesting neighborhood. There are a lot of bars and restaurants nearby as well as multiple bikeshare locations to help get around. I would definitely stay here again. "
2970666,33986324,2015-06-03,29234250,Pam,"Autumn was so helpful and informative. The condo was everything we expected, great views, clean, modern and within walking distance to tons of fabulous restaurants and shops! Bus stops were close as well. We felt like residents of Capitol Hill, strolling to the grocery and even cooking for our son whom we were visiting. We will stay here again! You made our first trip to Seattle delightful."
2970666,34705839,2015-06-11,30808329,Cheryl,Autumn was very welcoming!  Felt right at home!!   Great location 
2970666,35538864,2015-06-20,27444912,Beverly,"I received pertinent information well in advance and reminder emails just prior to my visit. This condo was clean, attractively decorated and modern. I especially loved the balcony and enjoyed having coffee there each morning. The location was ideal and I could easily walk to various restaurants, shopping and venues. "
2970666,37332766,2015-07-06,33790209,Supratik,"Autumn met us when we arrived, walked us up to the apartment and spent time talking to us about the amenities, the neighborhood and things to do in Seattle. She was very welcoming and friendly, and we enjoyed meeting up. The building is somewhat older but the apartment itself has been renovated and and was very comfortable. We were a family of four (2 adults, 2 children) and the apartment size was comfortable for us. It was unusually hot for Seattle and the apartment would get quite hot by the evening, but leaving the air-conditioning unit on through the day (as recommended by Autumn) did help. Laundry is in a common area of the building (and pay-per-use), which was less convenient than having it in the apartment itself.

The location was convenient, close to downtown ($6-7 by Uber to the Space Needle, for example), and within walking distance from grocery stores (QFC, etc.) and lots of restaurants on Broadway, a few blocks away. Capitol Hill is a nice residential neighborhood with lots of foot traffic and we felt safe, even late in the evening. "
2970666,37627849,2015-07-08,27755183,Laura,"The apartment was just as pictured, and was perfect for our stay in Seattle. The location was fantastic as well, near plenty of lovely restaurants, coffee shops, bars, grocers, and in walking distance to Volunteer Park. Thanks!"
2970666,38479282,2015-07-16,22092314,Josh,This was my wife and I's first experience with Airbnb and we loved it! Reuben met us to check us in and let us know all needed information and then we were left alone to enjoy our time. He did let us know he was available 24/7 if we needed him for anything. We definitely enjoyed staying here and were thankful to have a full place instead of just a hotel room. 
2970666,39155810,2015-07-21,31297788,Dennis,"The apartment was beautifully appointed, not too cluttered, yet comfortable and clean.  The location was great with easy access to all the top places in Seattle.  Autumn and her team made us feel very welcome and at home.  I will get back to Seattle, and would love to stay at one of Autumn's locations again.  I highly recommend it."
2970666,40300768,2015-07-29,39854718,Peter,"I needed a place to stay last minute and I'm glad this listing was available! Great location and size for a short trip in town for a group of up to 4. One thing, and not necessarily negative, was that the apartment was not cleaned when we arrived. However, I must say I booked this location and was handed the keys in less than 2 hours. Autumn responded immediately and had the place cleaned right away so there was no harm done. I was pleased with the quick response and action taken to get everything sorted out. Will stay again."
2970666,41582189,2015-08-08,16417838,Daniel,My wife and I had a wonderful time in Seattle and because of the central location of the apartment we were able to go everywhere we wanted to.  The unit itself was very clean and well stocked with all that we needed as per the online description.  We were met by a representative who showed us around which was great.  Thanks you.
2970666,45965979,2015-09-07,27435442,Zachary,"Fantastic pad in the ""everything is walkable"" Capitol Hill neighborhood of Seattle. Spacious 1 bedroom with comfy fold out couch, recently redone was great for myself, wife and daughter. We had a great time and Autumn and her crew were attentive when needed. De infinitely recommended."
2970666,46387993,2015-09-10,37301,Katia,"The apartment was in a fantastic location, well-appointed with modern furnishings, clean and comfortable. Autumn even included a bottle of wine to welcome us. Plenty of towels and all the amenities you could want. I was a bit confused because our specific unit was not the one pictured on the listing, but it was just as nice. Keep in mind that this isn't a lived-in apartment, if that's what you're looking for."
2970666,46883519,2015-09-14,16221711,Derrick,"Autumn's apartment was perfect for what we needed.  The apartment was beautiful, exactly like the photos.  The location was perfect.  It was walking distance to coffee shops, bars, restaurants, and grocery stores.  We would definitely stay here when we visit Seattle in the future."
2970666,47376844,2015-09-18,3674191,Ben,"The apartment was in a fantastic location for our first trip to Seattle. We had a lot of fun exploring the neighborhood, and it was convenient to get anywhere we wanted. Autumn was very kind and helpful, and the unit was clean spacious. "
2970666,48075013,2015-09-23,10398078,Janet,Autumn was super great! We arrived early and she had locker space ready for our luggage. Our check in was timely and the apartment is just as the pictures show. Beautiful apartment! We had a relaxing and enjoyable stay. Thank you!
2970666,51270407,2015-10-19,4757236,Ross,"Space and location are fantastic. Close enough to Broadway and the Pine/Pike corridor that you can easily walk but far enough away that you don't have to deal with weekend evening noise. 

Apartment was very well presented and super clean. Access is easy. Autumn was great to work with."
2970666,52252560,2015-10-27,4784888,Kathy,"My husband and I stayed at this property in Oct 2015.  The communication with Autumn and her management team was easy and promptly responded to.  There are several properties at this address she manages.  Mine was not this one pictured, (no balcony), but I knew that before check in.  All furnishings were modern, apartment was clean and spacious -- very comfortable.  Location was great: 4 blocks from large grocery, and the ""main drag"" of Broadway in Capitol Hill, Seattle.  Just 1 1/2 miles walk to Pike Place Market or the Space Needle.  Looking forward to our next stay!"
2970666,53387256,2015-11-08,46738585,Amy,"Very clean and spacious apartment. We requested early check-in and Autumn was happy to accommodate! Check in was fast and easy. Wonderful location in a residential neighborhood on a quiet street within walking distance of many restaurants, cafes, grocery stores, and Pike Place Market if you don't mind a longer walk. There are stairs to the building's entrance, so probably not a great choice for anyone who needs accessibility."
2970666,54869463,2015-11-25,6670093,Anne,"My mom and I traveled to Seattle for our first time for a long weekend - we loved the apartment! Everything was spotlessly clean and welcoming. We love to cook, and were so happy to find a kitchen fully stocked with everything you'd need to cook up a meal. The beds were extremely comfortable, with lovely comforters - even the fold out sofa bed was great, definitely the best I've slept on!"
2970666,56073923,2015-12-08,26191992,Karina,"Nice place, good location! Downtown was about a 10 min drive. Location looked just like the photos and Autumn was easy to communicate with!"
2970666,56333215,2015-12-12,28991054,William,Good location & comfortable accommodations
2970666,56626926,2015-12-15,49914543,Sunny,"A very good house to stay. The bed is comfortable, kitchen is convenient, and is easy to go to the main view points in seattle"
2970666,57397722,2015-12-25,42606446,Clement,"Autumn was a great host. We had to change our arrival time several times and she had been very accommodating. The apartment was exactly like the picture, modern, clean  and comfortable. Even though we did not do any cooking, the apartment was well equipped and stocked. The apartment is in a great location, within walking distance to lots of restaurants, bars, coffee shops and grocery stores.. Downtown is 10 minute drive or 30 minutes of easy walking. We especially appreciate the option of having a parking space reserved at a reasonable fee. We would definitely recommend this place to anyone visiting Seattle."
4784639,25489121,2015-01-17,22756340,Heidi,"The place was wonderful!  Very cozy, indeed.  Perfect location.  "
4784639,26959608,2015-02-22,6794529,Megan,"Fantastic flat beautifully decorated in great location. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay here. Everything we needed including coffee was waiting for us on arrival. You won't want for anything staying here. Laundry, storage, hair dryer, extra linens, soft towels, and a high end hotel feeling really made us feel pampered!  We lived our stay and would book again in a minute. Big enough for our two boys ages 8 and 9 and mom and dad. No problem. Thank you!"
4784639,27814393,2015-03-12,893008,Cheryl,"We had a wonderful stay at Marilyn's place. The apartment was very clean and well stocked. The finishings were excellent, with high quality linens and towels. We did not hear a peep from the other two tenants located in the building. We thoroughly enjoyed the Phinney Ridge neighbourhood with the local cafes, bakeries and Red Mill burgers. Every morning we walked around the corner to get a tasty latte and pastry from Fresh Flours. It was perfectly located for us to get downtown being close (but not too close) to the 99. Great airbnb rental!"
4784639,28875416,2015-03-31,9908858,Deonne,"The apartment was fantastic.  Everything we needed had been provided.  The space is beautiful and was just enough room for 2 adults and 2 kids.  The location was great, within easy walking distance to restaurants, a park and the zoo.  I would definitely say there again when we return to Seattle."
4784639,30249786,2015-04-19,5138512,Brooke,"Beautiful apartment, great location!  We spent a week in Seattle visiting family and needed some extra space for our family of 4 and this place was perfect.  Nicely appointed, stocked with all the necessities for bath and kitchen and was very clean!  Location was great as it was close to the Zoo and a short walk to Green Lake which is great for running and has some nice parks.  Outdoor area/backyard/patio is also beautiful and peaceful with a grill and outdoor seating that we put to good use.  Marilyn was easy to communicate with and helpful.  Would love to stay here again the next time we are in town!!   "
4784639,34471349,2015-06-08,19316936,New,"Great place, very clean. Secluded back patio but a great location. "
4784639,36110570,2015-06-25,24462106,Marc,"Marilyn did a great job of making us feel welcome and checking in to make sure all was okay.  The house is fantastic - super nice interior, peaceful backyard, and perfect location in a great neighborhood.  We loved the area and all the great coffee shops and restaurants (as well as walking distance to Greenlake and the zoo), and it was within short distance to everything we wanted to see.  The place would be great for anybody looking to explore the city, and as a family of 4, it was everything we could ask for.  

"
4784639,36323400,2015-06-27,18683841,Iris,We really enjoyed our stay at this beautiful house!  It really felt like our home away from home for our short two-day stay.  It was very clean and had everything we needed.  We especially loved eating our meals outdoors in the backyard.   The house is also in a great location.  I really appreciated the fact that Marilyn had large bottles of shampoo and conditioner available because we didn't have to buy travel sized bottles (which can be a pain and a waste sometimes).  We went to Pike's Place Fish Market and enjoyed a Copper River king salmon dinner at home one night.  Great way to end our trip to Seattle! 
4784639,37814770,2015-07-10,3219199,Mariela,Beautiful home located in a very tranquil neighborhood.  I love the fact that I have a park a block away and plenty of restaurant at walking distance.  Well decorated house and extremely clean.  Spacious backyard.  I would definitely  go back to this location with my family.  15' drive from Seattle City Center.  
4784639,41724780,2015-08-09,12652950,Brent,"This is a lovely, comfortable apartment that is in a location that is especially convenient to the Phinney Ridge neighborhood and to all of north Seattle in general.  The communication with Marylin leading up to and during my stay was timely and helpful.  Although the exterior of the building is fairly basic, the interior is very nicely done and the outside garden spaces are especially attractive and well maintained.  It should be noted that the apartment does not have air-conditioning, which is not a problem in Seattle for most of the year, but does cause the apartment to get fairly warm in hot summer afternoons - evenings cool it down quickly however.  A visitor staying at this apartment who wants to see Seattle's tourist sites should probably have a car for transportation, although bus service is available close-by."
4784639,44022257,2015-08-23,6399446,Jodie,"Marilyn has created a warm, beautiful space. It was perfect for accommodating four adults and convenient to all of Seattle's highlights. We each enjoyed our stay, especially the outdoor spaces and the ability to prepare meals together in the well appointed kitchen. "
4784639,46136394,2015-09-08,36174271,Michael,We truly enjoyed this beautifully appointed place in a very charming neighborhood near Green Lake. There are several restaurants and cafes within walking distance and it's just a few minute drive to downtown. We loved the beautiful private back patio with lush landscaping. We will definitely come back again to stay at this place when we visit next!
4784639,48324095,2015-09-25,43689135,Stephanie,We had a very good time to stay in Marilyn's house.  She prepared everything for the guests and super professional as a superhost!
4784639,49586395,2015-10-05,2266867,Meredith,Apartment looks just as pictured. Perfect location. Really enjoyed walking to the zoo and running at Green Lake. Wonderful restaurants nearby. Easy to hop on the 99 to run down to Seattle's downtown.
4784639,54012972,2015-11-15,74659,Juan And Kathy,"The apartment was perfect in every sense.  It was beautifully decorated inside and out and spotlessly clean.  The beds were very comfortable and the linens and towels were high-quality.  My mother declared she was going to move in permanently, which is quite a compliment.  It's hard to add more to the other great reviews.  "
8350401,48844255,2015-09-28,359467,Rob,"We had a great time staying with Joanna!  The house was clean, kitchen well-supplied, and the apartment was very easy to access by bus - we did not have a car and had no trouble at all.

I would recommend her as a host and would stay with her again on my next visit!"
19623,31032,2010-03-23,85846,Erin,"We had a great time in Urban Oasis 2-bedroom. Plenty of room for sleeping and relaxing . . . and not in the same room. The best part? We walked everywhere! Close to the Market and the Sculpture Garden. And all sorts of food options right around the corner. The only downside was the night noise. Otherwise, a great trip."
19623,86352,2010-08-29,123009,Jeremy,"Excellent apartment, Sally and Darik were very helpful and understanding with all our requests. We all enjoyed our time in Seattle."
19623,91700,2010-09-07,97979,Rachelle,"The place is absolutely beautiful and worked out much better than getting 2 hotel rooms. We loved the ability to walk down to the market, buy some fresh fish and veggies and make our own meals in the well stocked kitchen. Belltown is a great area and 1st street (2 blocks away) had a fun nightlife scene, but just outside of the building can get a bit sketchy at night. That being said, I would absolutely recommend this unit to anyone who is looking to see Seattle by foot and wants the conveniences of a home."
19623,110987,2010-10-04,25011,Carly,"Though I didn't get to meet Sally or Darik we spoke via email many times prior to the reservation and they were both very professional and understanding with my constantly changing plans.

The apartment is spotless and had all the amenities one could want from the washer and dryer to the shampoo, conditioner, and hair dryer.

We didn't take advantage of the free parking spot but thought it would be worth mentioning.  A completely seamless and lovely stay in Seattle- seize your opportunity to stay here!"
19623,121209,2010-10-18,210431,Heather,We had a great stay at the Urban Oasis.  The location couldn't have been better.  We were within walking distance of all the major attractions in the downtown area plus the condo is right on a major bus corridor.  Bell town was a fun neighborhood with lots of places to eat etc.  We loved the full kitchen and had a great stay.  Hope to use it again someday!
19623,157110,2010-12-22,225496,Ian,"The apartment is as pictured which is great, it is clean, neat, tidy and had good amenities. Overall our experience was a good one and i can recommend it. The area is close enough to the downtown, about 0.5km to the markets and action, probably easier to get a taxi or bus if you want to go frequently. The parking is good but watch out for the allyway being blocked by other vehicles which did happen to us a couple of times.
I did have trouble contacting the host Derek and I just kept getting his answering service so make sure you have your contact details worked. Apart from these minor issues the place was good.
Neighbourhood is OK but if I was a woman I wouldnt be walking around at night."
19623,159748,2010-12-29,265389,Katie,"The good: apartment is quite nice! Comfy beds! Usable kitchen! Very thoughtfully equipped- down to an umbrella! A big step above other furnished vacation rentals I have stayed at. Convenient location too.

Drawbacks: 3rd ave is where lots of buses run, and lots of people noise too. Could be a problem in the summer with windows open-- we stayed there in December, so we'd just whine about the rain, which is probably not Sally & Darik's fault.
I suggest you ask to see the rental agreement before you commit. The one they sent me said no one who wasn't a guest could come in => no dinner guests?! even though the cooking facilities were one of the attractive points!? Also they wanted my ccard info even though airbnb already had it. They are advertising this place through at least one other venue so maybe they use the same paperwork for all, but it made me uncomfortable."
19623,496930,2011-09-03,302040,Margaret,We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and I must admit we were pleasantly surprised when we entered the front door even though I had seen the photos.  The welcoming basket of goodies gave a very nice touch.  We will definitely recommend Urban Oasis.
19623,851613,2012-01-09,487025,Juan,"Upstanding operation, good value, great neighborhood.  My only qualms were the serious street noise in one of the BRs and the nominal bathroom door: perfect for a family, not so perfect for splitting the place with friends?  Maybe there are other units in the same building that don't have either problem?"
19623,903185,2012-02-05,1448221,Chiara,"We had a good experience overall. The fact that the power was out in both bedrooms during our entire stay and wasn't fixed was annoying. Had to borrow the cleaning lady's flashlight to get around in the bedrooms.

Aside from that, the location was perfect for the venues we were attending."
19623,973255,2012-03-05,1789703,Bobbie,"LOCATION, LOCATION, LOCATION.... This place was perfect for us, we walked to Pike Place for coffee and enjoyed the enviroment of each condo we used. Thank you!"
19623,1208540,2012-05-01,362813,Helena,"We had a lovely time in Seattle although ""Sleepless in Seattle"" was definitely the overall theme.  We have two small children (4 years and 8 months) and the noise from the bus stop (both from the buses and the people waiting for the buses) was just too loud for our children to be able to sleep/nap comfortably even in the back bedroom.  Otherwise the apartment was well equipped and clean.  The fact that the apartment is walking distance to the shopping district, the market and the ""Needle"" is its best feature.  I do not think this apartment is suited to young families but for anyone else it would be really great."
19623,1223964,2012-05-03,462634,David,The Seattle Oasis is a wonderful place to stay! I would really recommend it to anyone who would like to experience Seattle—very convenient and a beautiful apartment!
19623,1676616,2012-07-10,1686032,Cat,"My friends and I had a fun time here.  It was in the perfect location as the concert we were attending was just around at corner.  It is also a great location that is close walking distance to many tourist attractions.  We took full advantage of the roof top patio as the weather was beautiful.  A major plus was the secured parking spot as well as a well stocked kitchen. The only minor downside was the bathroom sliding door, as it wasn't as private as we'd like as we were friends sharing and not couples.  Overall I would definitely recommend it."
19623,1939036,2012-08-10,2490632,Edward,"Very convenient, but noisy!  Small in size though looks big in picture.  The pictures shown were actually taken from the roof of the building.  The Apartment is on the second floor.  Apartment is clean but we had to pcik up towels from the dryer!!"
19623,1999609,2012-08-16,2190955,Ron,For the Price it was very very nice for 4 people. The location allowed walking almost everywhere and we were within the summer free bus zone. Some of the bus traffic was a mite noisy when the windows were open and our weather was in the mid 80's so they were open most of the time. The roof top deck was very relaxing. Thanks  Also City pass was a very good choice we saw it all.
19623,2748307,2012-10-29,1624284,Erik,"I went to Seattle with 2 colleagues from work to attend a conference.  This unit worked out perfectly for us.  It was within easy walking distance to the conference hotel, and in its own great location (close to lots of good restaurants).  The unit itself is cozy, and is very well-managed.  The check-in/out process was smooth.  I highly recommend the unit for any stay in Seattle, whether work or pleasure, and will look at it first when I'm back in the city."
19623,3157007,2012-12-26,3120355,Lindsey,"We had a great time at the condo... We had 6 people staying there so it got a bit cramped. It was very safe, and we loved the amenities and close proximity to places that we wanted to go. "
19623,3767821,2013-03-12,172775,Justin,"Had a great stay in Seattle, great central location, great apartment with all the amenities you could ask for, including a nice roof top patio to enjoy a beer and a bbq whilst over looking the city. The second bedroom was a little noisy due to its street front location.

The only improvement could be the bathroom door is close to see through. Make sure you are comfortable sharing with whoever is in the second bedroom as well the door isnt really a door.

The hosts made it virtually like a hotel stay, so well prepared, so easy and simple!  From the welcome basket to the book of information of the area it was all so well done that i'm wondering why more AirBnB hosts dont do the same."
19623,11061798,2014-03-18,5230718,Zain,"Really enjoyed the location. Walking distance to just about everything, the house was very warm and welcoming with a cute balcony. I would definitely stay here again but granted it was a little tight with six people. "
19623,11260503,2014-03-27,5188180,Bryon,"We arrived early and Darik was very accommodating in allowing us to check in early. The apartment was very clean and well-stocked with a nice ""welcome kit"". The location is fantastic for those interested in checking out the space needle and other museums. There are also several great places to eat nearby.  Overall, I highly recommend this accommodation. "
19623,15089756,2014-07-02,4947564,Kwang Woo,"It was very lovely clean, quiet  and secure place.
We loved washer and drier.
Close to many beatiful attractions and seaside is few blocks away.
We also enjoyed restaurants near apartment.
We will definately stay again in next time Seattle. "
19623,16662446,2014-07-31,16501574,Paulette,"Yes,  all information and instructions were very clear and helpful.
Office assistance easily accessible and helpful over the phone. 
Apartment was comfortable, located very close to everything, and we had a great time in Seattle.  Thank you!
"
19623,19368966,2014-09-11,19291647,Alex,"We had a great time staying at this place! First, the location was perfect. It is located within walking distance of places like Pike's Place Market and the Space Needle. Next, the condo was nicely furnished and very comfortable. We appreciated the gift basket to welcome us in. The building has a communal area with gym, pool table, kitchen, tv's, rooftop deck, bathrooms (all of which we made use of during our stay). Lastly, the  hosting agency was very responsive and instructions were laid out perfectly for us to check in, check out, and everything in between."
19623,19873854,2014-09-20,18291644,Ashley,"This apartment is in the perfect location for exploring Seattle's tourist attractions, most things are walkable and there are good amenities in the surrounding area.
The apartment itself is perfect, from the welcome pack with those little extras to the lovely rooftop area. I would recommend this apartment to anyone looking for a great place to stay with a central location.

The owners were most helpful and accommodating, even when we had to notify them that we would be later in arriving. "
19623,20745947,2014-10-05,5509531,Anna,"Darik's place was absolutely gorgeous.  There was jazz playing when we entered and a lovely gift bag with some water and snacks to tide us over during the trip.  The beds were very comfortable, including the pull out sofa bed and what was also quite wonderful was the rooftop common area that was amazing on a beautiful Seattle day.

The location is very central.  It's an easy walk to Seattle center (10 minutes) and also an easy walk to Pike's Place (10 minutes) and the cool shops in downtown.  My friends loved the idea of being able to easily access some amazing bars and restaurants just a block away from the apartment and highly recommend everyone to stay here if they can!"
19623,21075758,2014-10-11,11932730,Tor Einar,"Veldig god og detaljert informasjon gitt på forhånd av leiligheten,og hvordan komme dit.
Leiligheten var svært bra.
Veldig sentralt i forhold til offentlig transport og bespisning.
"
19623,21459863,2014-10-18,15242840,Jason,Two thumbs up!  Great condo.  Great location.   Super clean. Very organized.  One of the best Air BnB experiences so far.
19623,23308096,2014-11-28,9559413,Melanie,"We had a great time here. The location is excellent, and we walked everywhere. We have two kids and we felt like it was a good size and we didn't feel like there was an issue with the bus noise at all. "
19623,23667386,2014-12-07,1241887,Steve,"Nice place, very accomodating and helpful. "
19623,23922189,2014-12-14,8479262,Kyle,"Darik did a great job with the preparations. Very detailed instructions were left. Check-in and check-out were a breeze. The location is perfect for visitors to Seattle. You are never more than a ten minute walk away from all the main attractions, including Pike Place, Space Needle, the waterfront and the light rail station to the airport. 

Welcome basket was great and Darik did a great job and was very proactive with all communications. "
19623,24140159,2014-12-21,13957561,Rushiru,Overall good visit. Good location and nice apartment.
19623,24511794,2014-12-29,3069812,Dirk & Lorraine,"It was different from other Airbnb experiences as we didn't meet Sally or Darik. It was more like a hotel than air Bnb experience. 

Saturday night there was a party in the building that was quite loud. Then Sunday night there were people yelling in the streets and dogs barking. If you are a light sleeper I would bring ear plugs.

As other people mentioned you want to share this space with people you know well. The bathroom door and second bedroom you can see around as it's a sliding screen/door. 

The location is great, walking distance 10 -12 mins to pike place and 8 mins to the space needle. The parking spot is great as parking can be expensive downtown.

The kitchen was well stocked. "
19623,34647876,2015-06-10,32616685,Erin,"We had a lovely time on our visit. We had no problem finding the place and getting access to the apartment. The place is quite small compared to how it looks in the pictures on Airbandb. There were some towels left in the dryer from the previous tenants, but the apartment was clean and in a good location near the fish market and great bars and restaurants. Unfortunately, our friends in the room closest to the street didn't get much sleep. Out there window is a very active bus stop that had constant traffic starting very early in the morning. There is no A/C and it was pretty warm so we had to keep the windows open. The fans helped with the heat and the beds were very comfortable. The biggest issue we had was with the bathroom door or lack thereof. It's a sliding glass door that is slightly see-through with gaps on both sides. Zero privacy. We took advantage of the bathroom in the lobby when we wanted privacy. The rooftop is the best part of the condo by far, but unfortunately we were only in town for a few days so we were out exploring the whole time and never made it back before 10pm when the rooftop closed. "
19623,43604117,2015-08-21,20133440,Meg,A very smooth check-in process and instructions very easy to follow. A great location to all the Seattle attractions. 
19623,45636877,2015-09-04,37521342,Cathy,"Couldn't be happier! It was my first airbnb experience! The apartment itself is very clean. I appreciate the welcome basket that's filled with water, sparking water and even some green tea bag. The host was really nice and had made our check in and check out seamless.  
价格算下来跟酒店差别不大呢 起码酒店比较新 这间的房子一股阿三味 周围还有好多无家可归的人跑来跑去的 车库也小不好倒车 唉 幸亏只定了两天不然要气死"
19623,48862880,2015-09-29,32477136,Jodi,"Wow!  What a beautiful place to stay!  Just returned back to New England a couple of days ago and already want to return to Seattle. The apartment was wonderful.  However, the pics led me to believe it was a little larger than it actually was.  There were 5 of us in the apartment, so it was a little tight when we were all gathered in the living space, but other than that, absolutely perfect...tastefully decorated and really in a wonderful part of town. I had 2 fourteen-year olds with me who really enjoyed the open space of the billiards/tv room and the open air of the roof-top deck.  Seattle is amazing...and our neighborhood, ""Belltown"" is close to major sights (walking distance).  Just a wonderful experience all around and it didn't rain :)!"
19623,51890209,2015-10-25,2761011,Keiko,"This condo is centrally-located to a lot of great sights that are within walking distance (Pike Place, Space Needle, shopping), but we also rented a car and it was convenient to be able to park the car in the building. 

The apartment itself was comfortable for 4 close friends. We shared the beds. Previous reviews about the noise from the street are accurate. The condo is on the 3rd floor and 1 bedroom faces a main busy street, so you can hear a lot noise late into the night. Check-in and check-out was very easy. 

I would recommend this condo to anyone visiting Seattle, or if you're working downtown. "
9426058,58159885,2016-01-01,27742269,Lauren,The listing description of this place was very accurate. The bed was was comfortable and the room wasn't too hot or cold. The bathroom was very clean and well stocked with toiletries. The living room and kitchen were very nice. The apartment was a great location. Using an Uber to enjoy the night life of seattle was not expensive at all. This was one of the nicest places I've stayed and at such a good price. Kumail was a good host. He replied to messages quickly and gave great instructions on how to get in. I very much enjoyed my time in Seattle and was very happy to have a great place to go back to. 
3646393,35360026,2015-06-17,5653660,Drummond,Sharon responded very quickly (fastest AirBNB reservation I've ever made) and was very easy and helpful to work with. A+.
3646393,35426906,2015-06-18,8856828,Jennifer,Sharon was incredibly welcoming and accommodating. Her house is lovely and very convenient to the UW campus (~25 min walk).
3646393,35724903,2015-06-21,35517155,JoAnne,"Perfect first Airbnb experience!! 
Thank you, Sharon! Beautiful home in a great location. Short walk to restaurant, coffee shop, and small grocery. Easy access to major roads. Always had a close place to park. The rooms were very spacious and clean! Thick bath towels, large shower with two shower heads and huge Jacuzzi tub in private bath. The satellite dish was not working when I arrived but Sharon had it fixed immediately. Good kitchenette area with sink, fridge, microwave, coffee and tea pots. Access to laundry room and ironing board. Very nice to have a separate entrance so we could come and go without worrying about interrupting our hosts. 
Sharon was the perfect host, very welcoming and quick with good advise on getting around Seattle. 
I loved everything about our stay! "
3646393,36219191,2015-06-26,29543411,Taylor,"Sharon was wonderful and my mother had a great time staying at her house. I stopped by with my two year old son and was greeted by Sharon and her mother, who provided a great selection of toys for my boy to play with and we had a great conversation about the current state of affairs in Seattle. Thanks for taking such good car e of my mom and making her feel so welcome!"
3646393,37120524,2015-07-04,3644794,Seth,Sharon is awesome! From the moment we walked through the front door she was kind and very thorough. This was our first time staying through airbnb and Sharon made it feel like we were staying at a home away from home. She was very accommodating. We loved the Jacuzzi tub and the bed was super comfortable!
3646393,37679917,2015-07-09,22589065,WangSoo,I was a little worry about the location in seattle. But the owner was kind to me and she always worried about my feeling. That i enjoyed staying there for four days. I went to all of part in seattle haha..thank you for everything.
3646393,37877256,2015-07-11,6617576,Hillery,"Sharon's home is lovely, and we had a comfortable stay! She attended to many thoughtful details and was friendly and easy to stay with. The space is very large and the bathroom is especially nice. "
3646393,38314267,2015-07-14,12062595,Andrea,"The space is beautiful, clean, and perfectly comfortable.  It's nice to have a bit of privacy between the two sleeping areas (separated by the bathroom).  My favorites were the luxury bathroom and the quiet, peaceful neighborhood. Sharon is a gracious, friendly and helpful host, providing everything from snacks in the mini-kitchen to tips for exploring the surrounding area.  If we ever return to Seattle (which is likely), I know we won't need to search for another airbnb place to stay!"
3646393,38471400,2015-07-15,14017858,Christina,"Sharon was a great, accommodating host. She was very easy to communicate with and gave us good suggestions that took us to some really cool non-touristy places. We ended up spending the day riding on a bike path which we were able to catch just a few blocks from her house. Great stops at parks and breweries along the way. 

We especially liked Sharon's willingness to allow us to park in her back alley since our car was full of stuff (in the midst of a road trip). 

The space is clean and comfortable. Sharon has put a lot of thought into making sure her guests have a pleasant stay. We had everything we needed and then some. Pictures and descriptions are accurate. 

The neighborhood is very nice and residential. There were not many places in the immediate area (for example there was not a place right down the street to grab a sandwich for lunch). But since we had our bikes, the location worked out well for us.

We'd definitely recommend staying with Sharon. 

"
3646393,38874344,2015-07-19,7658990,Kirsten,"Sharon is a wonderful host. She was always helpful and giving us tips and ideas for nice things to do in Seattle with our two little kids. It was convenient to have a bicycle shop and the waterfront activity center around the corner, so we could explore the city by bike and canoes. The location is in a nice and secure neighborhood. We had wonderful days in Seattle and I highly recommend to stay at Sharon's apartment. "
3646393,39183677,2015-07-21,35542227,Pete,"Sharon and her husband Jaime could not have been more welcoming.  Our trip was part of a larger family reunion in Seattle, and the rest of the group stopped by over the course of our stay.  Sharon was very flexible with our changing plans, and was always ready with recommendations for activities to do around the area.

The actual place was extremely clean, and had everything you could possibly ask for.  We had 3 adults and one 7yo, which fit in very nicely.  Sharon had plenty of nice touches in the flat such as a variety of snacks and teas, as well as a stocked fridge with drinks (enjoyed the Apple ale!).

We also enjoyed the back garden sitting area, and Sharon was happy to come out to chat to us each morning to hear about our Seattle adventures.

In terms of the area, there was a nice market, coffee shop, bike shop, and restaurant in easy walking distance.  The road the house was on, while close to main street access, was very quiet with plenty of parking available.

One of the huge surprise benefits of the whole experience was access to 3 high quality bikes.  While not emphasized on their website, Sharon and Jaime were happy to let us use their 2 road bikes and 1 mountain bike.  This turned out to be a huge plus, as the house is also close to at 3 (that we found) prime biking areas.  Firstly, the Arboretum is essentially just across the road, and is absolutely stunning for nature lovers (and most of humanity!).  Secondly, the Interlaken road allows a easy and traffic free (mostly) ride towards town.  Finally, the Burke-Gilman trail, is only up the road and across the bridge, and allows for hours of riding around great swathes of Seattle.

Overall a very pleasant experience, and I would wholeheartedly recommend Sharon and Jaime and their wonderful place."
3646393,39778886,2015-07-26,25655912,Jennifer,"Sharon was an absolutely wonderful host and her place was so cute, comfortable, and in a great location. Even before we arrived, Sharon was super communicative and helpful, going so far as to alert us of potential construction a few blocks away that would be taking place at night (as she knew we had a baby and might hear it).  Though Sharon was traveling while we stayed at her place, she was at the ready to answer any questions we had.  The basement apartment was larger than we anticipated, well maintained, and very comfortable.  The jacuzzi tub was an added bonus and the back porch area was perfect for a glass of wine in the evening. We loved it.  Thanks Sharon for everything!"
3646393,40394744,2015-07-30,7228906,Kate,"
Sharon's place was perfect...quiet, comfortable, clean and cool! She is located on a pretty, leafy street in Montlake and we enjoyed the nearby Italian restaurant and little coffee shop. 

This was the perfect place to get a great nights sleep while visiting nearby relatives. We were made to feel very welcome and will certainly plan to stay here again when the need arises."
3646393,40926819,2015-08-03,4166513,Colin,"Sharon and her family made us feel very welcome and we even spent some time sharing stories of Brazil on the back patio over drinks.  There were lots of complimentary snacks in the suite, etc., which was a nice touch, too.

The suite is in a finished basement which was a real blessing as we were there during a heat wave and it managed to stay quite cool, despite no A/C.  The main bed is very comfortable, the fold out couch is pretty typical, and the shower/bath are both really nice.  The whole suite is kept very clean.

The neighborhood itself is pretty quiet, with a couple of good grocery stores, a pasta/pizza restaurant, a neat antique shop, and a bar.  It's easy enough to get a bus or uber to wherever.  I would highly recommend staying with Sharon to anyone looking for a place in the area."
3646393,41249671,2015-08-05,18595942,Janet,"Everything was wonderful, from pre-reservation communications to warm farewells.  The neighborhood is lovely and convenient, the accommodation exactly as described, and the hosts are friendly and interesting.  Comfy bed, wonderful shower (didn't use the jacuzzi tub), lots of thoughtful touches.  Highly recommend and would definitely. come back."
3646393,42136216,2015-08-11,23736143,Scott,"Sharon and her Husband are some of nicest people we've ever met: accommodating, welcoming, personable.  They really go the extra mile; we felt like their listing really captured the benefits of private vacation rental AND hotel experiences alike, with little to no room for improvements.

Okay, maybe there is one possible improvement: pictures! No photos can do justice to this beautiful, quaint basement studio.  The listing received was better than expected.  The bed and sofa are both extremely comfortable.  The entertainment system is top notch.  We were tempted to spend our whole vacation in the studio, but why would we when...

The neighborhood is perfect.  The home is in a quiet, established community, but the neighborhood is charming and full of character.  You can't beat the accessibility, with ample parking and nearby bus stops that zip you to downtown, capitol hill (or walk to capitol hill!), the U district, and Mercer/Bellevue.  One connection gets you over to beautiful Alki beach or Discovery Park!  Must be one of the lowest crime areas within a bus ride to downtown.  We'll ALWAYS stay here when we visit Seattle; hopefully this review doesn't make it hard to find availability."
3646393,42917508,2015-08-16,32268192,Matt,"Magnificent experience! From the beginning, Sharon & Jaime were extraordinary hosts. They reached out prior to my arrival with all the information I needed to know about the rental. They sent a list of their favorite eateries and local places to check out while there. They were the first to update me if anything unexpected occurred. They offered to loan us their bicycles to get around town. They invited us to dinner. They stocked the mini-fridge with little breakfast things to make sure we had a pleasant morning. They even had chocolate and wine in the room upon our arrival! I've had family members that don't do that much!

From arrival to departure, both Sharon & Jaime made my wife and I feel welcome. The area was centrally located to the city. A 20 minute car drive could get you anywhere you needed to go. There were also wonderful places to visit that were within walking distance. Namely the Arboretum and GAS Coffee. Parking for Seattle is typically a nightmare, but we never had a problem on their street. We also always felt very safe. Being from Atlanta, you develop a keen sense when to ""run"" and when to ""walk"". Their neighborhood was more of a ""leisurely stroll"" kind of pace.

You'll be hard pressed to find a better value in the city and I highly doubt you'd meet better hosts. Top notch!"
3646393,43277390,2015-08-18,39070653,Michael,"Sharon was a wonderful host! She was very sweet and accommodating. I felt right at home. She had plenty of recommendations of things to do in the city and all of them were wonderful. 

The room was beautiful and very comfortable. The shower and jacuzzi tub were a wonderful touch. Not to mention, the house was in a great location to get from place to place. Would definitely stay here again."
3646393,44169738,2015-08-24,10855484,Alex,"Sharon and her husband are what make Airbnb so enticing. They were incredibly warm, welcoming, hospitable and provided wonderful accommodations. On top of just hosting us, Sharon and her husband invited us into their home to chat and have some wine, gave us amazing recommendations on things to do in the Seattle area and even let us hang out with their dog Luna :)

All in all, staying with Sharon made our exploratory trip of Seattle easy, comfortable and fun and I would highly recommend staying at Sharon's Airbnb if you need a place to stay in the Seattle area."
3646393,45033593,2015-08-30,4199245,Anja,"We had great days @ sharons place! they have been given us a really warm welcome and everything we asked for. many good advices for our city trips and we had a really nice glas of wine with them in the kitchen:)
at any time back there!!

best wishes
Anja&Gerd"
3646393,46739823,2015-09-13,40494748,Kate,"The whole experience was great. Beautiful neighborhood with easy access to coffee, grocery, and Arboretum. Easy street parking. Sharon was extremely helpful and responsive with our requests. She stocked the fridge with some goodies in advance of our arrival, and helped get a pack n play for our baby.

We hope to be able to visit again!"
3646393,47866538,2015-09-21,18404184,Qingyuan,非常友好的房东，这让第一次使用airbnb的我有了一个非常棒的体验。但由于太忙了，每天早出晚归，没有时间和房东多聊一聊，不过她还是很乐意和大家分享的。
3646393,48711702,2015-09-28,22040406,Kathy,"My 10 day stay at Sharons place was SO comfortable! I could come and go with total ease, and the warm friendly rapport with Sharon and her husband make me feel almost family! A fantastic experience!!!"
3646393,50541262,2015-10-12,14897371,Shelly,"Sharon is a really nice and friendly host! My parents came to visit me and stayed at her house for 2 weeks. At first, I was having problems during the booking process. She helped me to work with airbnb and contact me in time. Her house is clean and cozy, close to UW campus, it was comfortable and convenience to stay here. Although we live in the same house, the place for us keeps good privacy. 

Recommend this house to everyone and my parents said they would like to stay at here next time!!"
3646393,53655829,2015-11-10,30563909,Matt,"I had a 5-day stay here while visiting my UW student. Sharon and her husband could not have been more gracious and kind hosts. The unit was clean and quiet, the facilities were excellent (the bathroom / jacuzzi / shower were top notch), and the neighborhood is great. UW is a very short car ride, a short bike ride and even a modest walk from here. The nearby coffee shop is literally just a 3 minute walk away. Parking was no problem at all, and Sharon even relocated her own car to allow me to park my car on her back driveway during the one UW football game day that occurred while I was there - parking on these rare handful of days a year is strictly controlled on all neighborhood streets for miles around the stadium. Sharon was extremely helpful and friendly, and my son and I had a great time visiting. I highly recommend staying with Sharon. "

3646393,54673777,2015-11-22,49274293,Lauren,"What a wonderful place to stay! I was visiting UW for a few days and this was the perfect place for me. It was easily accessible to both UW and downtown, in a nice, quiet, comfortable neighborhood. Sharon and her family were incredibly welcoming and provided good tips for what to do in Seattle. The space was very comfortable and relaxing. I'd highly recommend staying here!"
3646393,55786110,2015-12-06,40193121,Ruth,"Had a great and restful time whenever we came back to Sharon's Air BnB. Arrived to a bottle of wine and some chocolates. Sharon is a warm, kind, and friendly host. Will definitely consider going back if we're in the area again. :) "
3646393,56432180,2015-12-13,15026763,Michael,"Sharon went above and beyond my expectations as a host. She was very helpful in providing suggestions and helping me get directions.

I have to say, the bathroom sold me on this place and it delivered. Dual action shower!? Changed my life and worldview.

The location is excellent. Very close to all the great spots in Seattle. I took uber quite a bit and rides ranged from $6-$16. All the values on the higher end were due to surge pricing and a fairly decent trek.

Definitely recommend. Sharon is a model"
3646393,57844677,2015-12-29,52062446,Melissa,Sharon is a very nice host and her home is very cozy! My family really enjoy this trip and will definitely choose Sharon's house again in the future ;)

Annie was highly accommodating, making my first trip to  Seattle a relaxing adventure. :)"
1133329,4695051,2013-05-20,855512,Sara,"We are so happy we found this amazing place to stay in Seattle!!

I met my parents in Seattle for the weekend so we needed a 2 bedroom place, pet friendly with flexible check in-out hours... 

Not easy to find... but going through Airbnb I realized it was worth to try a new place in the website, and I wasn't wrong.

Laurie and Gary's 2 bedroom is a GREAT place to stay! They are extremely helpful, friendly and nice couple.

The place is big, nice, clean, comfortable and you literally have everything you need!! Just pack your toothbrush (and underwear) because this place has everything you need and everything is brand new! The kitchen is fully stocked, there is coffee and teas, fridge for your left over food, the bedrooms have extra blankets if you need any, the bathroom has everything as well. Parking on the street was always easy to find just outside the house, its a beautiful neighbourhood. We took a long an pleasant walk along the sea-walk (3 blocks away), there are restaurants, bars, boutiques very close (walking distance) and the drive to Downtown Seattle is about 10 minutes. There is public transit if you are not driving.

We will try to stay in this place again every time we go to Seattle, it was a great find and we were so happy all weekend.

We found a home away from home and we enjoyed it very much!

We are very thankful to Laurie and Gary, they helped my parents a lot when they arrived (I arrived later), they also helped us with directions, suggestions for restaurants and shops around the area, they even helped my dad and fixed a seat belt in his car. 

The communication was very efficient, I was sending messages through the website (I didnt have roaming/calls/texts, but they do have Wi-Fi) and getting responses within minutes.

Long story short it is a GREAT place to stay with AMAZING hosts!"
1133329,4843504,2013-05-28,5971791,Motoko & Paul,"We moved from Chicago to Seattle, and stayed at Laurie & Gary's place while we looked for an apartment for the total of 7 days.  The location is awesome for any family with little ones. This B&B is in the beautiful, safe & quiet neighborhood, and there's a Zoo and the lake nearby.  

Inside the B&B- We were very pleased that they provided nice variety of toys for our 2-year-old. They also had changing tables & other amenities for baby/toddlers.  The kitchen was great.  all the appliances looked new & clean.  We totally enjoyed the fresh coffee every morning!  

Thank you Laurie & Gray, you guys were very friendly & helpful host! "
1133329,5063946,2013-06-10,6530129,Neiko,"2B or not 2B was cute, clean and well stocked. The beds were comfortable...and there was plenty of room for me and my three travel companions. Laurie and Gary had great suggestions for local attractions. They were helpful, but not intrusive. The suite is in a great neighborhood, close to the park, zoo and restaurants. Had we stayed in a hotel, we never would have gotten to know the neighborhood like we did; it was very homey, and more private than a hotel. And plenty of street parking was an extra bonus! "
1133329,5184720,2013-06-17,3177842,Lee,We had a wonderful weekend stay at the Milligans house. 3BR as advertised with a great little kitchen and back yard for our dog. The neighborhood is awesome with easy access to Green Lake and Phinney Ridge restaurants. Would definitely come again!
1133329,5262429,2013-06-21,5514028,Ingrid,Laurie and Gary were great hosts! They helped us out in very short notice and tried to help us in any possible ways. The appartment was clean and nice.They answered all our questions and provided good advice when we needed it. Thank you! 
1133329,5297465,2013-06-23,6500190,Edward,"We enjoyed our stay at your place.  It was clean, quite and very roomy. Thanks"
1133329,5380649,2013-06-27,3579726,Emily,"My trip to Seattle would not have been as great if not for Laurie and Gary's suite. My boyfriend and I are absolute homebodies and this was the perfect place for us. The space was spotless, welcoming, sleek and comfortable. The beds were great and we both had full nights of sleep without any discomfort. While the bedrooms and living room were comfy and everything they needed to be, the bathroom and kitchen/laundry area were probably my favorite. Both were laid out in a very smart way and utilized the space. The water pressure in the shower was awesome. We also loved having the kitchen area and made great use of the tea kettle. It was also unbelievably nice to be able to wash clothes halfway through our visit to the PNW. The place was very convenient to two different bus stops, awesome food, and some sightseeing. We even took a short walk to the zoo one day!  Laurie and Gary had so many suggestions for the area and were very kind and accommodating. Pay attention to all of their food recommendations. Laurie and Gary-and their space-are great! We would stay here again without hesitation. "
1133329,5493386,2013-07-02,3508560,Adri,"Would recommend for poor college students but not much more.  Pluses for college kids you don't care if its clean as long as it has a bed and a fridge for beer you're set.  Plus you could wash a couple loads of clothes if you were on a road trip or something.    You can't party here but its good enough to crash for a few nights.  We stayed with my parents and it was too hodgepodge for what we paid in my opinion - the 4 person rate was quite high.  First its very odd to enter through the garage.  Its full of clutter and you walk through this clutter to get to the entrance.  It feels very odd to essentially see a storage unit full of randomness.  The other issue was that it wasn't cleaned to a standard that I keep my own home.  A few surfaces were dirty or dusty, wet dirty wash clothes in the shower upon arrival, floors not freshly cleaned so as a whole it was off putting.  It wasn't filthy it just wasn't cleaned thoroughly and it showed.  I also let the owners know and didn't get a response which just seemed odd to me - unless the response was to come make nice with my parents - which didn't resolve the cleanliness issue.  The bathroom rug was really gross we covered it with another towel.  The kitchen is pieces wedged into a small space from Ikea and the bathroom was optimized in a small space.  It was creative with a few nice details like the moon light in the kitchen but in general not on par with some of the other places we have rented for a short vacation.  I probably wouldn't stay again or recommend to anyone since I've stayed at a nicer home for similar price in the University district before.  Sadly they were booked this trip.  Be ware also that these is no air conditioning so the summer months be prepared to get hot.  In general disappointed but we didn't check out early so it was disappointing but not awful."
1133329,5734370,2013-07-14,5080392,Tessa,We loved our stay at Gary and Laurie's. The house was easy to find and in an excellent location. The apartment is decorated beautifully and has anything you could need for a short-term stay. We were able to hear the conversations of the people in the apartment below and the walls in our apartment were pretty thin. We felt bad because we had a baby with us and thought that maybe other's were bothered by us. Just something to keep in mind.  
1133329,5863027,2013-07-20,4430337,Debbie,"Laurie was a fabulous host!  The apartment was efficient, comfortable and the location was fabulous!  Backyard was a surprising bonus. "
1133329,5910090,2013-07-22,3405911,Elizabeth,"Laurie went out of her way to return a left behind item and was helpful and attentive upon arrival. The place was perfect, quiet, cozy and well appointed. Great location. Thank you!"
1133329,6070687,2013-07-29,5174234,Jared,"Our quick trip to Seattle for a wedding was made less stressful by Laurie.  We have a 9 month old and Laurie had everything set up for us by the time we got there.  Great toys, crib, high chair etc.  It was very thoughtful!  The location is really ideal for almost everything in North Seattle and downtown is maybe 10 minutes.
All in all we would definately stay here again, thanks Laurie!"
1133329,6139525,2013-07-31,7631960,Mark,"We had a great stay at Laurie's fantastic home, Instantly we felt relaxed and 'moved in'!
It was the perfect size for the tree of us and I love they way the place was put together! 
We even got to meet the dogs!

I will recommend this place to my friends that are Seattle bound and I hope to use it again on our next trip!

Cheers
Mark"
1133329,6199431,2013-08-03,7352717,Stephanie,Apartment was as we expected from the website. It worked well for 4 adults. Well-located and had everything we needed - including lots of info on things to do/see in Seattle. We spent most of our time out and did lots of walking in the area. The lake walk is a real plus!  
1133329,6321272,2013-08-08,6615673,Priscilla,"We rented the 3-bed unit and private bedroom for 3 days as a family group of 4 people in early August.  Laurie and Gary were friendly hosts, and we were grateful for a surprise breakfast and late check-out on our last day, when we were due to catch an o/n flight to London.

The house is well-situated in a pretty, old neighborhood with views down to nearby Green Lake.  No breakfast is provided but we were pleased that it was just a 5 minute walk to local shops and restaurants, and about a 15 minute drive to other areas of interest in Seattle.  The house is nicely decorated, with comfy beds and well appointed bathrooms, and a fully stocked kitchenette/washroom in the 3 bed unit.

On the whole it is very nice accommodation but we feel that we should point out aspects that might be of concern to some potential renters:

(1)	To get to the bathroom from the private bedroom you have to walk through the host's open plan living/kitchen area, where coffee/tea-making facilities are also provided.  The hosts did not use this area much however.
(2)	The 3-bed unit has no door between the hallway and the shared stairway; instead there is a dog gate and curtain.   The bedrooms do have doors, but family members using the unit felt uncomfortable with what they perceived to be a lack of privacy and security when moving around the unit.
(3)	The rooms can get hot during summer and one of our group had a problem with mosquitoes when the windows were opened for ventilation, along with an early awakening by the sun which might not appeal to late risers. 
(4)	One other reviewer has mentioned a bit of dust here and there – we did notice this in the private bedroom.  The living areas and bathroom were very clean however.

Having said all that, we appreciated being in such a lovely neighbourhood and the hosts’ hospitality.  We wish them all the best in their venture.
"
1133329,6542945,2013-08-16,7813741,Lori,"Great location, nice hosts!  House was only 30 minutes by bus in rush hour to Pikes Market and very close to beautiful Green Lake.  Wifi was a pleasant surprise for us!   Had some take out from Mai Thaiku on Phinney Ave. and would definitely recommend. Wish we had more time in Seattle. We'd stay with Laurie again!"
1133329,6656696,2013-08-20,6863805,Beatrice (Bee),"If you want to know what it's like to live in Seattle, stay here.  It's right in the middle of a cool neighborhood -- narrow streets, crazy parking and all.  (I lived in SEA for 20 years, so I should know)  One night, someone was playing the tuba across the street!  (not late or loud -- it's a family nabe, just a nice bit of music floating across).  But close to everything,   The accommodations are very comfortable -- the host has thought of everything for your comfort (thick towels, good bedding, things for children, a well-equipped little kitchen, comfortable places to put your feet up, a good TV, wireless, etc.)  You can walk to Greenlake, and nice restaurants, bakeries, hole-in-the-wall stores on Phinney and Greenwood.  The apartment is the middle level of a house, and overlooks a lovely, classic-Seattle overgrown backyard courtyard.  i.e. pretty quiet.  Homey.  If you want a luxury hotel, this is not it, but a business traveler or small family could stay here very happily for a while.  Loved it, and would book again. "
1133329,7362687,2013-09-17,7118010,Richard,"This location was a serious disappointment.  It was advertised as a 3 bedroom/bath whole house/apt.  Very misleading.  It was 2 very small bedrooms with an uncomfortable futon in the small tv area.  If the futon was used as a ""bedroom"", there was no place to sit and watch tv or eat, since the tiny kitchen only held 2 people. There were cobwebs in every room and a ""gym-like"" smell in the bathroom that didn't go away even after I cleaned it.  All of the towels had to be re-washed since they smelled musty and rancid.  We discovered why when we opened the washer.  The rubber seal on the inside was completely black with mold, long term mold. The owner had a nasty attitude when we approached her about the issues but did refund our money and we left 3 days into our 8 day stay.  There were no doors between us and the 2 other floors where the owners lived, and another guest was staying.  Just curtains hung as ""dividers"".  Both of the beds were double size mattresses right on the bed frame, not even a box spring under them.  This was an after-thought for the owners to try to make some quick money.  Very unpleasant experience.  However, AirBnB handled the mess beautifully and promptly! "
1133329,7768416,2013-10-02,7168294,Lila,Everything went sooo smoothly. I was very pleased w/ my stay.
1133329,8019749,2013-10-13,7855040,Lena,The place was clean and quiet and easily accessible by bus. Everything ran smoothly and Laurie was available to answer my questions.
1133329,8188780,2013-10-20,8315802,Serena,"Went with four college friends recently, and stayed here while vacationing in Seattle. We absolutely enjoyed the stay! This place is pretty much in the middle of most of the places we went to! Very nice and quiet at night too, if you're worried about safety and/or noise level. This place has a washer+dryer (with detergent) if you are traveling light and need to do laundry during your stay. Kitchen was very useful too; dishes, utensils, stove, fridge were all very useful. Bathroom towels were provided for us to use, too! Comet and Darwin were awesome too; thanks Laurie for letting us play with them! We'll definitely come back here next time we're in town!"
1133329,8377758,2013-10-28,5621720,Olivia,"We had a very nice stay at Laurie's! The bedrooms are a good size, and the kitchen is cozy and funky. This is a great place to stay with kids and well-behaved dogs, as both the apartment and the neighborhood are small-creature friendly. Phinney Ridge is quiet and mellow, yet has some great restaurants, parks, the lake and zoo, and it's so easy to hop on the bus/99 to get downtown. 

Some reviewers have mentioned a lack of privacy: although a curtain and gate rather than a door separates the apartment from the main house, I felt very comfortable and in no way exposed. The curtain/gate leads to the staircase, and I was greeted once by a friendly, quiet dog, but saw no traffic otherwise.

I also found the entrance through the garage to be fine, private, and easy for coming and going at will. We took a lot of walks in the quiet, pleasant residential streets and enjoyed a true Seattle vibe. Thank you Laurie!"
1133329,8943481,2013-11-27,1711209,Abigail,"Laurie's apartment was fantastic for us -- we've lived in Seattle before and also have a toddler, and this apartment perfectly accommodated our situation.  I think it's best meant for those who are a little familiar with the city, as it's in a residential area a bit removed from the major sights except for Green Lake.  But you're definitely in walking distance of a cute neighborhood, and easy driving distance to anything you'd want to see in the city.

Laurie obviously has made the extra effort to be child-friendly, and it was SO appreciated by us. One of the bedrooms is down a hallway, a bit removed from the rest of the apartment, so it was perfect for our daughter to nap/sleep there without us worrying about our noise keeping her awake. They provided a pack-and-play, changing pad, infant bathtub, baby shampoo, high chair, and lots of baby/toddler toys. Basically, they've pulled out all the stops to allow you easy, relatively fun travel with a kid!

In conclusion, this apartment's definitely one of the best arguments for going with an Airbnb over a hotel when traveling with kids, and a terrific place to stay when you're in Seattle."
1133329,9018439,2013-12-02,9153708,John,"This was our first opportunity to use airbnb and it was a wonderful experience for our family. The location was perfect for what we like to do, it was a neighborhood not a sterile hotel where everything is alike. We could and did walk the neighborhood, we enjoyed being so close to the Woodland Park Zoo and we could hop on a bus to go anywhere we wanted to without the hassle of driving. We gave thanks for our hosts since we were fortunate to stay there over Thanksgiving. The place was clean and comfortable, perhaps an extra chair would have been nice, but when we were asked if there was enough chairs we said yes, so that is really on us. Laurie was right on top of a concern that we had and told her about. All in all this was a great way to experience a great neighborhood in Seattle. We would gladly do this again at this same site."
1133329,9135343,2013-12-09,6752820,Sandra,"My two sons and I really enjoyed our stay in Laurie's apartment. It was very cozy and had all the comforts of home. It is in a quiet neighborhood, close to nearby attractions and bus lines. There are local eateries within walking distance. Laurie provides lots of helpful information for getting around and for things to do. My family would highly recommend this suite to others, particularly those with children."
1133329,9428394,2013-12-28,10283575,Richard,"We visited Laurie's home over the Christmas holiday. We were extremely happy with all aspects of our stay. Laurie was an excellent hostess. The three bedroom, one bath, and full kitchen was immaculate equipped with every amenity imaginable. The private entrance code allowed for complete privacy. The unit was also quite tastefully designed in a beautiful neighborhood (just 5 blocks from my brother's house). I took morning walks to the lake a few blocks. I would rather stay in Laurie's place than a 5-star hotel. Thanks Laurie!"
1133329,9509398,2013-12-31,4036531,Laurie,"Laurie's home was the perfect, cozy (heated floors - yippeee) setting for our Christmas break.  We had the entire floor of her home - with a private entrance - and it was equipped with everything we needed to make our stay comfortable.  This home is just a few short blocks away from shops, restaurants, pubs, grocery stores, etc.  And, there are great choices for lots of outdoor activities nearby.  We highly recommend Laurie's home.
Cheers!"
1133329,9629689,2014-01-03,1468469,Linda,"The spouse and I needed a last-minute place to stay for a few days in Seattle.  We sent a request to Laurie, and heard back immediately (which was DAYS better than others...).  Every time we needed to contact her, she was friendly and immediately available, which is awesome and takes a lot of stress out.  The apartment we stayed in was on the middle floor, and surprisingly large and nicely done.  Two comfy full-size beds and a futon.  One room is private, the others are separated by a thick curtain.  Bath is small but nicely outfitted.  The kitchen is cafe-cute and stocked with the usual dishes/pans and sink, and also a washer/dryer, dishwasher, coffeemaker.  The floors are radiant heated with its own control.  We walked two blocks to the main drag with lots of restaurants and pubs, YUM.  And did I mention Laurie was great?  Recommended!
~Linda  "
1133329,9919939,2014-01-19,7990856,Morgan,"It was a great place to stay! Within walking distance to restaurants,  etc. The heated floors were nice but a bit too warm at times. Other than the beds being quite small (full size) we have no complaints. Laurie was very helpful and responsive. We will definetly stay here again"
1133329,10254403,2014-02-09,2520312,Sarah,"The place was nice and it is very convenient. only problem that I had was the host did not answer my cell phone so I did not know where to go what to do etc. but well, I had good stays. "
1133329,10495821,2014-02-22,8368900,Angela,"Laurie was amazing! The house was lovely, vibrant, and impeccably clean. We had everything we needed and more. I couldn't have asked for a better spot to stay on vacation in Seattle. I would stay there again in a heartbeat!"
1133329,10857504,2014-03-10,12541678,Greg,Laurie's place was great! I especially liked the well-stocked kitchen area. An easy walk to the shops & restaurants on Phinney Ave.
1133329,11826701,2014-04-16,11264746,Marilyn,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay in Laurie's place.  It was clean, cute, well-stocked, and in a great neighborhood.  Her street is charming!  We especially appreciated the book of information she has compiled.  It was very comprehensive with her personal recommendations for restaurants, activities, etc. Laurie was very quick to respond to any of our questions (though we did not have many, since her book was so thorough!)  We would stay here again!"
1133329,14947778,2014-06-30,3175646,Ryan,"We stayed for a full month and were overall very satisfied with our stay. The location couldn't have been better for our family as we could walk to many things and easily drive/catch a bus to everything else. The Phinney Ridge neighborhood has many restaurants and shops, some within two blocks of the house. 

We were also training for runs and were able to go right down the hill to Green Lake and utilize the path... very cool!

Laurie always replied very quickly to any requests which were typically just for flaky internet connection :)

The only thing not observable in the photos is that this apartment is open to the main part of the house. When we arrived we noticed that the hallway led to a staircase that opens directly to the other living areas. There were gates and curtains to provide some privacy, but we were expecting a full locking door.

One last note, the third/middle room lacked seating for the four of us. There was one very uncomfortable futon/couch but no other seating options. For a short stay it would have been a very minor issue, but for a full month it became a fairly significant annoyance.

All in all, we would stay here again. The value for the location is unbeatable compared to other options in the area.

Thanks Laurie!"
1133329,16538170,2014-07-29,7876243,Frank,"We spent about three weeks in the guest suite in Laurie's home as a family of 5 (with 3 teenage children) on our family summer vacation from Germany. We had a fantastic time! The suite was just as described by Laurie. Our children shared the one queen size bed and used the sofa in the living room as additional bed. We had the separate bedroom for us parents. The kitchen is fully  equipped and functional (including washer and dryer that we used quite frequently), however, too small for sitting together as a group of 5. We had our meals in the living room and positioned ourselves around the smaller living room table and used the sofa as well as the kitchen seats.
We used this suite as our basis for our vacation to the Pacific Northwest. From here we took trips (inculding overnight stays) to the Olympic National Park, the Mt. Rainier National, Park, the San Juan Islands as well as Vancouver, BC. 
Laurie's home is located in the very nice Phinney Ridge neighborhood.  Beautiful Greenlake is just a few blocks away and helped me during very early morning walks to get over my jet lag within the first days. This is one of the neighborhoods that you can only really appreciate when living in one of the residential homes (as there are simply no hotels in this neighborhood).
Laurie provides and shares all the relevant local information (next grocery stores, local neighborhood restaurants).  Our favorite restaurants were the Phinney Market Pub (ask for the mixed garlic french and sweet potato fries) and Bongo's Cuban restaurant both within easy walking distance.
We have experienced Laurie as a very warm and caring host. Our children loved the dogs and even ""invited"" Darwin once to spent an hour in our appartment. On the other hand if you do not want to have any contact with the dogs you will hardly realize that there are dogs living in this house. During this very warm summer period Laurie provided us with two extra aircondition fans. A late check-out was no problem and helped us a lot to get even more relaxed to our evening flight."
1133329,17437338,2014-08-12,3022578,Ilya,"We had a very good experience with Laurie's place. It's on a quiet street with easy parking, the separate entrance is very convenient and the whole setup is very well put together. The house is right by Green Lake and the zoo, within a 5-10 minute drive to a lot of nice north Seattle neighborhoods and maybe a 20 minute drive to downtown.

The 2 beds and the futon are comfortable, there is a fully functional kitchen, a washer and dryer (very handy if you're going to explore the gorgeous nature in the area), and all the rooms were stocked with everything we needed. The stand-up shower could be a little bigger, but that's a very minor complaint.

Laurie was very responsive and pleasant the two times I called, but if you want complete privacy, everything is set up for you to arrive and check out quickly and easily without having to arrange anything or wait for anyone.

Overall, this was a great experience."
1133329,17925648,2014-08-19,11867773,Simone,"Laurie was a great host and the neighborhood was perfect for exploring, yet close enough do get downtown in a matter of 10 minutes.

The unit we stayed in was cozy and had access to the backyard as well, which was a nice little escape.

Great size for a couple and maybe a little one as well.

"
1133329,18402661,2014-08-26,5355746,Todd,"Laurie's place near Green Lake was excellent! It would be hard to find a better location to see the Seattle area. The living space is a short walk to Green Lake, the zoo, and good restaurants. It is a short drive/ride to Fremont and Ballard (our favorites) and only a slightly longer drive/ride to the Pike Place Public Market. The three rooms and small kitchen provided everything our family of four needed for a wonderful stay. Thanks Laurie!"
1133329,18980783,2014-09-04,13908532,Cathy,"Accommodation was PERFECT for two friends travelling together.  We stayed for 7 days on first leg of trip to USA & Canada.   Clean, spacious and had everything we required.  Just like staying in a self contained unit.  Quality bathroom with walk-in shower.  Washing machine and dryer most welcome. Access to full cooking facilities allowed us to stroll to the nearby organic supermarkets and cook our own meals when we wished.  Loved nearby Ken's Market and your recommended dining opportunities in Phinney's Ridge.  Peaceful walks through leafy neighbourhood and Green Lake allowed us to get a feel for the vibe of this beautiful city suburb.  Weekly Farmers Market was a great experience. Close to the city too.  Heaps of useful local information and tourist info provided by owner.  Extremely pleased with first airbnb experience.   All our planning was easy with very prompt replies from Laurie to any queries and requests we had while planning the accommodation.  Thank you, thank you.  Highly recommend this accommodation.   "
1133329,19138983,2014-09-07,19393444,Hillary,"Nice stay in a scenic neighborhood! Host was very helpful, responsive and accommodating."
1133329,19314088,2014-09-10,16798672,James,The accommodation was as listed. Ver clear instructions were given on how to access and when we arrived it was very clean and tidy. I thought the facilities were good and certainly as described. It was quiet and cosy and we felt very safe within the neighbourhood and were close to local restuarants and town etc. 
1133329,20747824,2014-10-05,1600054,Dyuti,"The listing description is accurate. We were very impressed with this rental because it was clean, and very well equipped. It is a good place to stay for a while (e.g. 5-7 days or longer) because she has thought of a lot of important details. W/D, fullly equipped kitchen, bathroom with amenities, many towels. It is very comfortable and also quiet. The neighborhood is probably one of the most desireable in Seattle, and the rental is within walking distance of the Seattle Zoo, several bars and restaurants and on a bus line. There is very little to complain about (really, nothing). Street parking was always available, no matter what time we arrived. "
1133329,21055130,2014-10-10,485950,Chris,"The neighborhood was great, and the kitchen was functional for basic cooking. 

The host made us feel welcome by providing a small child bath and a high chair – both of which were awesome. Other than that, we didn't interact with them except through email. 

The apartment itself had some quirks that weren't super. Entry was through the garage, which was fine, but it was, well, through a garage. There was no door closing off the ""Entire home/apt"" from the main living area, though there were curtains and a dog gate. The big downside of this was that when there was noise in the main house, it sounded like it was directly in the apartment. So, we frequently heard dogs, kids crying, and some late-night socializing. 

The layout was good for us (there was a separate room for our son to sleep in), but the furniture definitely felt a little worn and ""left over.""

None of it really disturbed us, but it was not exactly what we expected from the space. "
1133329,21279488,2014-10-14,5161255,Sarah,"We had a great stay and the neighborhood was so well-located for us! This was our first time traveling with our baby and it was so easy to use the Pack & Play, infant tub, and changing pad. It made everything very easy for us. We visit family in Seattle often so would certainly consider returning! Thanks for everything."
1133329,21804265,2014-10-24,7455520,Estelle & Arnaud,Laurie was a great host. She was very helpful. The flat is very well decorated. We enjoyed very much our stay there. I highly recommend this place. 
1133329,22500066,2014-11-08,22821858,Joan,"This was a great experience! The residence was better than described! The accommodations were well appointed, very comfortable, cozy - felt more like being welcomed to a friend's home than staying in a ""strange"" place. Lots of little touches - coffee was great, available laundry detergent & reusable grocery bag, umbrella, comfy beds, sheets & towels. All in a great neighborhood! Plus easy to follow & use codes to enter & lock up."
1133329,22664133,2014-11-11,9862173,Jojo,"We didn't get a chance to meet Laurie nevertheless, we had a great time in this lovely home right outside central Seattle.  Since the house was so close to downtown Seattle, we got most of our touristy Seattle to-dos crossed off right away. Our favorite part was actually walking around Lake Green in the morning.  The lake is only a few blocks from the house and it was a great way to start the day!"
1133329,23289078,2014-11-28,12937084,Mary,"Great place... just as advertised.  Clean and nicely equipped and a super location.   Since we were flying with little kids and arrived in Seattle around noon, Laurie was kind enough to let us in early.   Phinney Ridge is my favorite neighborhood in Seattle... restaurants, shops, bars, coffee houses.  It's all charming."
1133329,23467844,2014-12-01,10761758,Lila,"Laurie responded very quickly to my enquiry about renting her place. The place was as described in the listing.  It is in a very nice neighbourhood, close to downtown Seattle, so worked very well for us. It is well appointed, with lots of amenities included, such as coffee, laundry detergent, etc., making it very convenient.  The keypad/code locking system is great, nice to not need keys."
1133329,23728394,2014-12-08,21262888,Win,"It would be hard to think of a better place to experience Seattle than Laurie's apartment.  A stone's throw from the beautiful Green Lake loop, the space is located very close to two major through roads, making it easy to buzz in to city center while staying out in a quiet neighborhood.

We came to Seattle for a theatre weekend, and it was so easy to get from city center back to Green Lake that we came home for dinner in between shows at Seattle Center.  Meanwhile you are also close to Ballard and Fremont.

My friend and I both commented on how comfortable and welcoming the apartment is.  It made our weekend experience there.  I will definitely be back.

It's an authentic Seattle neighborhood experience and infinitely superior to any we could have had at even the nicest hotel in town."
1133329,24824117,2015-01-03,17124514,Lisa,"Laurie made us feel very welcome by providing an excellent booklet on the apartment and the neighborhood, including many details on shops and restaurants. We followed her advice -- even ordering her favorite at the Chinese restaurant -- and weren't disappointed!

Phinney Ridge is a quiet, charming, older neighborhood with lots of character. We enjoyed checking out the restaurants and walking around the local lake.

The listing was more or less accurate except some of the furniture shown in the photos was not there when we stayed. Instead of the big chest in front of the futon, there was a very rickety coffee table that we were scared to move when we unfolded the futon because we thought it might break. Also, the futon looked different from the photo -- perhaps just the cushions were different.

The apartment appears a lot more bright in the photos than it really is -- especially in January. We found all the rooms to be too dark, even with the overhead lighting turned on. It made reading in bed difficult. On our last day we had to leave at 4 am and could barely see in the TV Room to pack up our things. I finally moved in a lamp from the back bedroom so we could pack!

Finally, there is only one large mirror for three bedrooms -- inadequate under any conditions but really inconvenient for three women trying to get dressed up to go out on New Year's Eve. Between the bad lighting and lack of mirrors, we struggled!

But the apartment was clean, well-heated, had a good bathroom with plenty of towels and a nice little kitchen. There was a strange smell (cat litter? mold?) when you first walked in but after you were inside a few minutes you didn't notice it anymore."
1133329,25476120,2015-01-17,21572420,Raven,"This is my first time using airbnb. I was excited but also worried about the recidency. Fortunately, it was a wonderful experience and Laurie's house is awesome! It is just 5 minutes walking to bus station and all the restaurants and convenient stores. I love the location that we can see the view of the green lake and snow mountains. The rooms are cozy and comfortable and the bathroom is really neat and clean and I love the smell of the shampoo "
1133329,25682569,2015-01-23,21820174,Xiaotong,It was a great place to stay in Seattle. The host is very nice. Location perfect. Everything feels like a home! Recommended!
1133329,26620502,2015-02-16,26633463,Charles,Cozy place that is convenient to the bus line and Green Lake. Place accommodated our three teenage girls and ourselves. Laurie was responsive and easy to work with over our stay. 
1133329,27326296,2015-03-02,25764241,Atava,"This was my first Airbnb experience and it was wonderful.  My friends and I felt very cozy and comfortable in this guest suite.  It truly felt like a home away from home.  The apartment was clean and quiet and the kitchen had all that we needed to make our own food.  

The location was great as well.  We were able to walk to nearby restaurants and grocery stores easily.  Plus, it was very easy to walk to the nearby scenic Green Lake.

Laurie was a friendly host and I would definitely recommend this place for people who are staying in this area of Seattle."
1133329,28090061,2015-03-17,3905970,Rachel,"Great neighborhood, convenient location, and quiet accommodations. Note that this is a lower level apartment in a large home. Access is from the side of the house through the garage with its own secure entry. However the only thing separating you from the owners house is a french door with opaque acrylic insert with clear glass transom over it. This is the last photo in the gallery. The door is not lockable from the rental/apartment side, so it is basically open to the owner's side. We presume this is for fire code to provide a secondary egress from the lower level. Not as ""private"" as we had expected but know that for the price you are getting a great deal! Note there is also a garden apartment below this apartment (the house is on a slope, so there are two levels of rentals). Very comfortable otherwise and really nice household supplies for the eat-in kitchen. The only real issue we encountered was a the IKEA futon/couch that does not appear to be assembled correctly in the living room but since it was only used for watching TV no big deal. Easy in, easy out, really great! Happy to have had the chance to stay. "
1133329,28423555,2015-03-23,10334671,Lisa,"Laurie's place was on the first floor of her lovely home.  Everything was clean, new, and in excellent condition.  Lovely apartment located in a great neighborhood.  We traveled by public transportation and everything we needed was easy to reach.  Laurie was very helpful and easy to reach.  Will return."
1133329,28567388,2015-03-26,11189456,Devin,"Loved this place, cozy and close to downtown. I would definitely stay here again. Thanks Laurie "
1133329,28784632,2015-03-30,20992823,LumOr,"I rented this suite for my friends from out of state. They loved this suite. This place was well stocked with everything we needed. The location was perfect. It was very close to everything we needed including a coffee shop and a local organic market. It is in walking distance of Green Lake as well. In addition, Parking was never an issue. I definitely recommend this place and this neighborhood for a great Seattle experience. "
1133329,29664491,2015-04-11,7553534,Renate,"Laurie's place was in a wonderful neighborhood, quiet, with some interesting eating places, and close to the bus stop with easy connections to downtown, Puget Sound and other places. 
We value privacy, so we liked the fact that Laurie left detailed instructions for everything, but did  not impose herself. We did get the sense though that if we needed her she would be right there.
The place was exactly as described. 
We had a great experience.
"
1133329,31698749,2015-05-09,28140123,Alison,We stayed here for three weeks in between moves and it was fantastic. The apartment had everything we needed and Laurie was very helpful. Great location! 
1133329,32037561,2015-05-12,32915376,Darren,"Excellent,  clean, bright, comfortable with lots of charm and privacy. Everything worked just as described. Lots of little additions that made it even more welcoming, from coffee to dryer sheets, everything had been thought of. My stay couldn't have been easier. 
"
1133329,36547316,2015-06-29,33610409,Mary,"There were so many thoughtful touches in this home. I loved all the extras in case you forgot things (in the closet) as well as the toys for children, kids cups/plates/utensils, and the baby crib/blankets. The neighborhood was great and we loved walking to shops and the lovely park a few blocks away. Perfect place to stay for a family (we have a 1 yr old and a 4 yr old)."
1133329,55180056,2015-11-29,2229821,Rebekah,Laurie was a great host! She was able to provide and pac n play and high chair for our visit which was very helpful. The apartment was perfect for us and our 1yo daughter and in a great location. We would recommend staying here and plan to again. 
6646985,34379280,2015-06-07,22097887,Xiaoxia,This house is quite clean and cody. It is very convenient to take link to airport or (website hidden) Lius are very nice and willing to provide transportation suggestions.I will choose this house again when I  visit Seattle next time.
6646985,35014360,2015-06-14,34793637,Katie,"Julian was an excellent host.  The room is exactly as described and the room and bathroom were nice and clean.  I was only there one night, but I felt very comfortable and safe during my stay.  The location is so close to the Link light rail ( you can see the station from his house) which made this stay even more convenient for me.  Julian was also very accommodating with my arrival (my bus didn't arrive in town until around 10:30pm) which was greatly appreciated."
6646985,35162472,2015-06-15,23722509,Jingyi,Clean and comfortable room!
6646985,35503877,2015-06-19,2234440,Scott,"I stayed at Julian's house on two different occasions. Both worked out well. He and his wife keep a clean and orderly home. There are four rooms for rent upstairs and two shared bathrooms. I never had issues with access to the facilities or guest noise. There was a bit of traffic noise in the evening, but closing the window blocks it out. "
6646985,35622663,2015-06-20,35578067,Liyan,Julian and his wife are very nice and flexible with my arrival time. The location is perfect and very near the Link (email hidden)e house is extremely clean and comfortable. There was bottled water in the room. They also drove me to see the night view of Seattle and took photos for me. Highly recommended!
6646985,35882582,2015-06-22,35995470,Jamie,"Unfortunately I had car trouble and had to cancel my stay, but Julian was very understanding and even offered to assist me with my trouble. "
6646985,36061680,2015-06-24,11429036,Brooke,"Julian is a very kind host who explains everything well and gives you privacy. The room and bathrooms are very clean and as pictured. While the house is very quiet, the surrounding area is loud so I would recommend earplugs for sleeping. For the price, this is an excellent deal."
6646985,36146211,2015-06-25,18433850,Sophia,"Julian accommodated my request to check in early, greeted me with a smile and helped me get settled in my room. We chatted a bit about my travels and return to Seattle. "
6646985,36458136,2015-06-28,35986570,Gina,"I didn't end up staying at Julian's place because of change in travel plans.  He was very prompt in responding to my questions and concerns.  Also very understanding to the changes that happened last minute.  From the description, I believe his place is quite close to the Link light rail and would be very convenient to get to the SeaTac airport and downtown Seattle.  Great option if one doesn't have a car."
6646985,36912947,2015-07-02,15054741,Lita,"I love this room; it's bright and comfortable, and so close to the LINK station. Julian and his wife are sweet and very accomodating. I'd definitely stay here again."
6646985,37217344,2015-07-05,6942617,Marlon,"Staying at Julian's is exactly what you expect from an air B&B. Very clean,  comfy bed, convenient, affordable and a very accommodating host that will give you recommendations as well. You are a 5 to 10 minute walk to Columbia city where you can start off your day with breakfast at Geraldine's or the really good bakery. The link train system is right next-door to the house which comes every 10 minutes and can take you to the airport in 20, and downtown in 15. Julian's will be my go to place for Seattle vacations in the future."
6646985,39944812,2015-07-27,35112636,Shannon,"I very much enjoyed my stay with Julian. I had a long term stay of three weeks in Seattle and found him and his wife super welcoming. They actually drove me around Seattle to show me the best bus routes to take to get to Capitol Hill when I arrived. They are located directly off the Link station with easy access to downtown Seattle and the airport, which is convenient. Columbia City is cute (definitely visit the bakery) and just as I was leaving a PCC market opened, which makes Columbia City a very nice place to be on the outskirts of downtown Seattle. There is also very easy access to Lake Washington for recreation. The room is super clean. Everyone staying at the house was very respectful and discrete to others' privacy. I would definitely stay here again in visiting Seattle. "
6646985,40132943,2015-07-28,37443692,Alejandra,"Julian was great, he would reply to messages in a timely manner and was very accommodating. For example: I messaged him if it was possible for me to leave my luggage there before and after check-in. When I arrived he was very welcoming and gave me a quick tour to show where everything was. The room and bathrooms were very nice and tidy. I also really liked that he lives really close to the Link Light Rail, it's a quick 20 minute ride to SeaTac and Downtown Seattle."
6646985,40268769,2015-07-29,37483942,Wang,"Nice location, good value for money. More appropriate for solo traveller."
6646985,40670106,2015-08-01,39347937,Robert,"Host was very nice and room was comfortable.
Very convenient to I-5...Seattle and W. Seattle.
Lots of neighborhood noise...but not late at night.
"
6646985,41261585,2015-08-05,38967363,Emily,"Mr. and Mrs. Liu are very kind hosts who keep very tidy but useful spaces for their guests. It is a small room, but perfect for access to the lightrail and several buses to get you around the city. It was great for being able to visit Seattle and get a broad view of the area.
"
6646985,41467328,2015-08-07,11015683,Siobhán,"Really nice place, well located, hosts were very friendly and professional. Everything I could ask for!"
6646985,41469192,2015-08-07,17985059,Sheila,"The room was bright, cozy and the right temperature.  The Hosts were very accommodating with the hours I needed.  i was able to spend many hours writing!!!"
6646985,41798084,2015-08-09,24159369,Stephen,"Julian was very friendly and welcoming and I would recommend staying in his room.  The location is right next to the Columbia City station, so there is easy access to downtown Seattle.  My flight in was also delayed  so I did not make it to the place until 1am, but Julian was still nice enough to show me around the place even at such a late hour."
6646985,42269663,2015-08-12,35149340,Subho,"Nice host, very convenient location and cheap price. Great room, no complaint."
6646985,42421923,2015-08-13,31185662,Abdoul,The couple was very friendly. It was a quiet room. I slept well. I enjoyed everything.
6646985,42574427,2015-08-14,32022933,凯,"The house is located between airport and the downtown, and only five minutes walk from the light rail station. The room is very very clean and the couples are so nice!! "
6646985,43368314,2015-08-19,34687625,Cheng,"This is my first time using airbnb. It was such a great experience. The hosts are very friendly and considerate. The room is very clean and the bed is quite comfortable. If I am in Seattle again, I will choose to stay at Julian's place. "
6646985,43560647,2015-08-20,40990516,Cheng,"Very good experience! Room is clean and tidy, all the households are great. This is my first Airbnb experience and I was deeply impressed."
6646985,43643690,2015-08-21,10810113,Kat,"I stayed in room C for a night and as far as airbnb goes, I've had better experience. Although the house is in a good location, it is loud. And don't expect the wifi to work. "
6646985,43873177,2015-08-22,41730051,David,"Julian was great, made me feel quite welcome. The neighborhood is suburban, but cool: super ecelctic- Senegalese, Kenyan, Vietnamese, Mexican, five dollar latte white occasionally. I'd recommend it as a place to crash with a close walk to picturesque downtown Columbia City, and the LINK train to the airport or downtown. Quite safe with shared bathrooms, clean sheets, wifi, and a no-shoes-in-the-house rule. "
6646985,44972565,2015-08-30,14646646,Ronald,Friendly and accommodating. Very helpful in helping get around and getting there.
6646985,45103195,2015-08-31,38250419,Tom,"Good communication, comfortable clean room and bathroom.  Was great, thank you!"
6646985,45795656,2015-09-06,2100139,Yvonne,"Julian s place is very clean and neat. I like that he actually has an area for all the guests to take the mineral water whenever they go out. He rents out 4 rooms in total in the house, just like a ""Mingshu"" in Taiwan. Other than 1 night, where the inconsiderate PRC guests in the other room were very loud in the middle of the night, my stay is all good."
6646985,47364904,2015-09-18,39735018,Kimberly,"He was extraordinary and gracious. I hit snags. I messed up. He was kind, decent and renewed my belief in kindness and caring."
6646985,47667501,2015-09-21,38428347,Misa,"It was my first Air Bnb stay, and it was as nice as expected.  The place was an easy access from downtown, just a few minutes walk from the nearest Link station.  I loved the neighborhood, with several nice places to eat, and the PCC nearby.
The room was warm and clean, enough for a single traveler to spend the night.  Other rooms were full when I stayed, but my privacy was well kept."
6646985,48033263,2015-09-22,22312010,Tengwen,"cozy and neat room.  kind host. awesome price!
definitely recommend!"
6646985,48357040,2015-09-25,19355445,Yuliana,“Fablous!” - I stayed at Julian's house when I went to Seattle. I loved the homey atmosphere. Julian and wife are very warm and welcoming. They treated me like family and went over and above board to make me feel comfortable and indulged my every whim. I really enjoyed my stay with Julian and wife and will definitely return. Yuliana Molgora
6646985,49026550,2015-09-30,42834868,Angela,"Location, location, location.  As promised on the profile, Juilan's home is minutes from the LINK station, which easily gets you into downtown in 20 minutes. It turns out that they have a number of rooms for ""rent,"" making it feel more like a mini-hotel, but everything was clean and neat, just like the photos.  As I was only at the house to sleep, I didn't interact with Julian and his wife very much, but they were warm and accomodating.  I highly enjoyed my stay, and I would definitely stay there again the next time I'm in Seattle. "
6646985,49785836,2015-10-06,30677271,Dorothy,"Julian and his wife were really accommodating. I landed at SEA-TAC in the morning but since check in wasn't til 3, they allowed me to drop off my things until check in time. The room was perfect for one person visiting Seattle for the weekend. Such a convenient location since it's right next to the LINK light rail and 8 bus line. Super easy to hop on there to go about Seattle. "
6646985,49985754,2015-10-08,27387664,Sarah,"Julian and his wife keep this place so tidy. He allows for the greatest amount of personal privacy, providing a key for the home and your room upon arrival. I had a fine stay!"
6646985,50127365,2015-10-09,45438672,Alexander,"My stay with Julian was great.  I arrived on a late flight and took the LINK in.  Julian was kind enough to meet me at the station and walk me to his house.  The room was well-lit with plenty of electrical outlets, and all bedding including additional blankets and comforter was provided.  The neighborhood was quiet as well, and I got a great night's sleep before heading into the city."
6646985,50604701,2015-10-12,42775331,Gina,"Very good place. I'm really enjoy the trip!!
"
6646985,50877894,2015-10-15,4396505,Shubhodeep,"Julian's place is the most wonderful place to stay at in Seattle. It's close to both the airport and the city (20 mins each), and has all conveniences close by as well. Julian is a great host and the room is warm, well-lit and comfortable. Highly recommended!"
6646985,52302196,2015-10-27,46385258,Matt,Julian was a wonderful host.  The bed was extremely comfortable and my stay was pleasant!  Thank you!
6646985,52484404,2015-10-30,41679383,Haizi,Julian & his wife were amazing hosts! The room I stayed in was perfect with a nice view. Super close to the train & stores. I highly recommend this place if you're traveling to Seattle!
6646985,52609300,2015-10-31,45583231,Rae,"Julian was wonderfully helpful from the beginning. He was willing and knowledgeable with directions from the Airport (and to various other locations) and I particularly appreciated him meeting me at the station late at night. The location is a really convenient midpoint between the airport and the city, and only two minutes' walk from the light rail. Both Julian and his wife were warm, courteous and generous hosts.

The room was simple and perfect for a solo traveller. Everything was clean and in working order. As there are 5 guest rooms on the top floor it's a good thing there was more than one bathroom!"
6646985,53263424,2015-11-07,11942072,Valentina Maria,"Julian and his wife were really nice.
The house was cozy and comfy.
The room clean and bright as in the pic.
Their house is a few step from the bus station and the link that can take you everywhere.
I have really appreciate the great position and enjoy my stay!"
6646985,53438653,2015-11-08,2992598,Gang,Julian was great -- very responsive and flexible with arrival time. The room and home was very clean. I would definitely stay here again!
6646985,56155052,2015-12-09,50159769,Carrie,"Julian's place was awesome. In terms of comfort, the room was very well furnished and clean. The location was also great--it was both convenient to the airport as well as to Seattle downtown. Julian and his wife were both extremely hospitable and helpful. I highly recommend his place."
6646985,56970278,2015-12-20,50908426,Kang,"Julian and his wife were very nice and friendly. Julian gave me some tips about traveling around downtown Seattle. The room and bathrooms are very neat and clean. Towels, bathing essentials and hair dryer were also provided. Location is convenient to downtown and SEATAC airport. It's extremely convenient if you have a morning flight to catch. Great airbnb experience."
6646985,57848037,2015-12-29,36902998,Nutsinee,"All the comments about host generosity and cleanliness of the place are all true. Not only that. Julian and Jasmine care about guests' needs. I had weather allergies during my stay and found a box of kleenex in my room (a box of kleenex?? Who would have thought of that!). There was a desk and a lamp. Two pillows and two warm blankets (+extra in the closet. I stayed in room C btw.). Julian even went all the way out to assist my trip and offered a parking spot right by his house for half a price of airport parking before I flew out of SeaTac (this was not part of the Airbnb offer. Don't book with him and expect this kind of offer every time, but I'm showing an example how far he would go in helping his guests). There were about 5 rooms. All upstairs. Two bathrooms which were kept clean all the time. I would suggest bringing earplugs. Not all guests have respects for other people's sleep. Overall my experience was a pleasant one. Will come back again if I have a business in Seattle!"
6646985,58325238,2016-01-02,48315364,Weiwei,"The room is super clean and warm.

Julian and his wife are really easy going and helpful for your trip. They look like your old friends.

They can pick your up at the LINK station, it's only 2 mins walk to his  house and around 15 mins to downtown. 

Due to my early flight, they also provided me the car service to airport. 

Will live in his house if I come back to Seattle again.

There are plenty of rooms and enough bathrooms to not have to wait much. The neighborhood is very peaceful and well connected by buses to UW and Seattle downtown. There's plenty of parking down the street (but not right outside the house).

Leah and Michael are prompt in their replies and have everything arranged so that you don't have to bother much. I won't hesitate to stay there again if I get the chance to visit Seattle."
4710866,28150486,2015-03-18,11097161,Matthew,"Great house, definitely recommend."
4710866,28544218,2015-03-25,21278862,Jordan,"This was a shared space in a pretty busy house, so it will only appeal to a certain segment; however, it was a wonderful place to stay, and the surrounding neighborhood was fantastic!"
4710866,29772487,2015-04-12,30007527,Luke,Excellent. Great listing no complaints 
4710866,30146354,2015-04-18,26332678,Antowan,I enjoyed my stay at the Crayola Home. The signs were really helpful and every one was friendly. 
4710866,30791289,2015-04-27,17035952,Павел,"Nice little bed to crash on, best value in town. The people are nice, never met the owners but I'm happy they provided a place for me to stay. Definitely recommend it!"
4710866,31722344,2015-05-09,29828508,Kathryn,"This is in a beautiful neighbourhood and although the house is unassuming from the outside, it is quite large on the inside with views all the way to the water. I was able to make it there using public transport from the airport which is great though took a while. Leah was very good about explaining how the house was run and checking in with me to make sure everything was ok even though I didn't get a chance to meet her for a few days into my stay. She is very friendly and organized. There were lots of bedrooms and lots of interesting people staying at the house. I was only there for a few nights but quite a few people seemed to be staying for a couple months at a time. Great place to go if you want to meet other people!"
4710866,32652675,2015-05-19,10799985,Zain,"Michael's place in seattle is an excellent place to stay no matter what you're going to Seattle for. I came up looking for an apartment as I'll be moving to the city next week and the crayola house met and exceeded all expectations. It's in a lovely neighborhood and all of the amenities & common areas in the house are more than everything you need for whatever amount of time you intend to spend there. The rooms, bathrooms, kitchen, backyard area are all pristine and the check in/checkout processes were flawless and very convenient. I'd stay here over and over again if I had to visit. "
4710866,33805515,2015-06-01,31322324,Vernon,"It was  a cosy corner of the Seattle neighbourhood. the house was comfortable and inviting. There were other guest which was great, all of them were friendly. "
4710866,36046402,2015-06-24,32904305,Hussein,"Had an amazing time! there were plenty of amenities, the people were very kind and always welcoming. There were activities to help people get more comfortable and the environment was very homely. Close to the downtown core and close enough to hike around towards parks like Washington park. Would highly recommend if one is visiting for their first time or coming back to the city"
4710866,39373431,2015-07-23,30132382,Sarah,"Such a relaxing environment and gorgeous view of Lake Washington & surrounds.
I felt like Crayola home was a great retreat in Seattle, a great place to rest and get creative! Not too far from Downtown Seattle.
Def lots of guests coming & going but I enjoyed the Saturday night bonfire! Something we don't do in Summer in Austrslia for obvious reasons!"
4710866,41925233,2015-08-10,30301541,Zichun,"I was amazed by the big house and the people in it. Like everybody says, Crayola Home is an excellent place to stay!"
4710866,44676142,2015-08-28,34077861,Shravan,"I had a wonderful stay here, I'd absolutely recommend it to anybody. The best part is that you get to cross paths with some really interesting people. The place is well managed by Leah and Jon is always there to answer any questions you may have. Leah or Michael almost always get back to you immediately. I highly recommend this hostel, a great place to stay! "
4710866,45065382,2015-08-31,19661343,Morgan,"It's been a year since my first visit and those small problems from the first trip have been smoothed out. With construction finished there are plenty bathrooms to go around and now little whiteboards to more effectively claim your bed.
While I didn't see Leah she did check up on me via texts to make sure that everything went well and it did. The lack of curfew makes it easy to stay out late without having to worry about being locked out, and even when I showed up after 11pm other guests would often be up still. 
Interacting with the other guests is possibly my favorite part. Definitely recommend"
4710866,49230285,2015-10-02,1756350,Swaroop,Loved staying at Crayola again! Miss the people and the place.
4710866,52133091,2015-10-26,21236499,Ray,"A big, clean house with lots of amenities."
4710866,55766663,2015-12-05,31785357,Andrei,Very welcoming place. I was in and out all day so it was rare that I ran into anybody else in the common areas but those I did meet were friendly. Being in Seattle for the first time I thought the Capitol Hill area and surrounding neighborhoods were beautiful and this house was right in the middle of it all. Great spot for the few nights I was there

8365938,50707404,2015-10-13,45757822,Marilyn,"Kristin was a wonderful host who was concerned about our comfort, privacy, and convenience. The apartment decor is a bit outdated and worn (not Kristin's fault). The roomy king sized bed was very comfortable and nicely made up with a bathroom directly across the hall. It was a bit spendy for the apartment unless location, location, location is your main concern. If you want to walk to Green Lake, Starbucks, some nice restaurants and shops this is close to them all. Our experience is positive and would recommend it as a clean, safe place to stay around Green Lake. There is parking although it's a little tight if you have anything larger than our Rav4."
8737284,51597529,2015-10-21,41345508,Mica,"Great space! Great hosts! Very nice and accommodating. It was my first Airbnb experience and I felt very welcome and got stay at an awesome location! 5 minute drive from cap hill, nice neighborhood with beautiful balcony and great sunset views!!! "
8737284,51661169,2015-10-22,41666633,Brittany,Emmett was easy to communicate with and flexible with our arrival and departure times. The place was nice and cozy. Enjoyed the balcony and close proximity to downtown Seattle.  
8737284,52259814,2015-10-27,12361907,Janae,"Emmett and Barbara were excellent in terms of communication and very flexible. The apartment was just what we were looking for in terms of location and space. Very cute and cozy, making you feel right at home. Awesome cafes and restaurants in close proximity and the views are spectacular. I left some belongings there and Barbara was kind enough to offer to send them to me! Great people, great spot!"
4484426,34936405,2015-06-14,28182957,Lauren,"Description was accurate, accommodations are good. Quiet part of town, quite nice. One of the better quality furnished apartments out there. Would recommend!"
4484426,42100956,2015-08-10,40901838,Arcadio,Melissa was a great host. She was very accommodating and flexible. This was a big help during my stay. 
4484426,42725573,2015-08-15,38776789,Yu,Melissa greeted us at the door and showed us the house. The unit is very clean and spacious for our family of 4. Located in a quiet neighborhood. The nearby University Village shopping center is just 5 minutes away by walk. We also liked the trail nearby. Highly recommended.
4484426,43393355,2015-08-19,38499121,Arjun,"Great, clean place, especially for coming to campus.

Melissa was very accommodating when we arrived. The apartment looks just as the pictures describe: a very spacious living room, two bedrooms, and two baths. The kitchen had all the basics and laundry is in unit. Very clean as well! 

The neighborhood was a quiet cul-de-sac just off of the UW campus (about two minutes drive). There are plenty of dining options in the immediate area and getting to and from downtown Seattle is less than a 15 minute drive. The listing says no parking, but we were able to find street parking on the block every time, usually we found a spot right in front of the building. "
4484426,44316163,2015-08-25,7280902,Chengzhe,"Melissa's place is terrific. The size of the apartment is fantastic, and it is located extremely close to University Village, where there is a huge selection of stores and a supermarket (QFC). It's well kept, clean and Melissa was very helpful during our stay. She was very responsive when contacted."
4484426,47003775,2015-09-14,16538386,Alan,Melissa's apartment was clean and tidy. Great location if you're headed to UW. I would stay here again for sure.
4484426,54508429,2015-11-21,35601818,Reyaz,"Love the open, airy feel of the place, including the view over UVillage.  The place is clean and bigger than I thought it would be.  "
4668327,33273262,2015-05-26,5399131,James,"Had a great time at Bri's place in Seattle. The place was just as described and was perfect for our 4 night stay. Its very close to the Link light rail and could get into downtown in 20-30 minutes .. much more convenient than trying to park. Bri was very easy to communicate with and had the place ready for our late arrival. Place was very and well equipped, would definitely recommend staying here!"
4668327,33858092,2015-06-01,33922795,Kevin,"I would call this a Seattle pied-à-terre. It's a cozy and homey spot located in Seattle's Beacon Hill neighborhood. This is not the Four Seasons or the gold-plated condo overlooking Pike Place Market. To stay here, you should enjoy City life - making your way around, dealing with parking rules, the sounds of a city. It's perfect for a cheap getaway for two or for those with business in Seattle who want a home at the end of the day rather than a hotel room. The owner is great - very friendly, helpful, and responsive. All-in-all, a great place to stay when your travels take you to Seattle."
4668327,34097275,2015-06-04,17324487,Ciara,"Bri was very easy to communicate with, great host! My boyfriend and I stayed here on a 3 day trip to Seattle. Super easy to find right off the LINK. House was clean and very comfortable. The bed was great! Also very nice to have a kitchen so we could have breakfast before going out for the day. The neighborhood is very cozy. Convenient grocery store only a few blocks away. We ate at Oak and had a few drinks and watched the Mariners at Tippe and Drague Alehouse. I can't say it enough the ease to and from the airport and right into downtown on the LINK was great!! Highly recommend this place!"
4668327,34547372,2015-06-09,8480812,Carli,Bri was awesome! Every time I had a question she was extremely prompt at getting back to me. The place was amazing and the neighborhood was as well! We will for sure stay again next time we visit Seattle! Thanks Bri!
4668327,35552567,2015-06-20,30132326,April,"Our staying at Bri's was amazing amazing and amazing! 
Her place is exactly what you see on pictures posted!! It's really clean and we have everything we need for our 11days staying!!
We had a great time in Seattle and got to walk around Beacon hills. We had tried the Oak,and it was perfect! And Mexican restaurant,tacos truck across the street and even Korean food! 
Very easy to take the train to downtown and perfect view from the windows.
Thanks to Bri we got to visit mountain rainier. Breath taking views up there that's worth the money even though we didn't rent a car but The tour Northwest was a perfect choice! :-) 
Five stars for Bri 's place!! 
We will be back maybe on November!
Have a wonderful day!
April."
4668327,35823962,2015-06-22,894511,Jan,"Bri was very welcoming, confirming with us that we were able to access the property and find everything we needed.  The house is adorable - very comfortable and cozy.  The neighborhood is quiet, with a grocery store and light rail access just 2 short blocks away.  We had a wonderful stay!"
4668327,36993513,2015-07-03,29288625,Dan,"Dealing with Bri was awesome, checking in and out was simple and her apartment was amazing. Bri, thanks for hosting, I had a great stay."
4668327,38261227,2015-07-14,30992693,Benny,"The location and convenience of Bri's townhouse is perfect.  Seattle area.  Close to free ways.  Free parking.  Close to super market.  I would definitely stay here again.  

Also, I really like her taste in decoration and furnishings.  Very urban and chic....  Reading the stuff she has up on the walls made me feel a lot better!  "
4668327,38610829,2015-07-17,10124037,Brittany,"We were very disappointed in our stay with Bri. The house was unclean (unswept floors, messy counters, very stained couches and rugs); and when we told her, she replied that she told us the house wouldn't be clean until check-in (which is when we arrived). It was very clear that she was trying to blame us and cited our initial desire to want to check-in early as an excuse for the dirty house. The wifi doesn't work, nor the kettle and even though the washer and dryer are advertised, there were clothes in them, so we couldn't use them.

There bedroom was so hot, we couldn't sleep in it, even with the windows open. This forced us to sleep on the dirty couches directly in front of the open windows, which made me very sick.

Because there was no air conditioning, you have to have all the windows open to avoid overheating the house. This means you hear every conversation, every crying baby and every huffy comment from her neighbor about guests (aka us). They were loud and rude.

Outside of being dirty, the house itself IS cute (quirky decorations) and in an amazing location. The light rail is two blocks away, so we managed to stay out of the house as much as possible (except for the second day when I was too sick to leave). 

Overall, probably my worst Air BnB experience."
4668327,39904665,2015-07-27,7991920,Kelsey,"If you're looking to catch a baseball or football game, this is the perfect place! Extremely close to Beacon Hill station and two stops away from the stadiums. Free parking was always available and close! Bri's house was clean and having full access to the kitchen helped a lot of making breakfast. She was always available when I had questions which was great. Please note, there isn't a/c but there is a fan in the room which helps on the hot nights, however, don't sleep with the windows open. The trains run all night long so it can be noisy. Other than that, everything was perfect! Thank you Bri for allowing us to stay at your home!"
4668327,40376609,2015-07-30,4345264,Alison,"Bri was highly responsive and helpful. Her place is an easy two blocks from the Beacon Hill train station which made getting to and from the airport and downtown super easy. Her place is comfortable and homey. The townhouse is only a few blocks from the 12th Street park where you can see downtown, the industrial section, and gorgeous sunsets. I recommend it!"
4668327,42332202,2015-08-12,28876185,Scott,"Not only was Bri there and available the entire trip, the neighborhood was lovely and the property description was perfectly accurate. "
4668327,43493342,2015-08-20,25814380,David,Bri's townhome worked very well for me and my family. Bri left a well stocked kitchen so we were able to cook and the Netflix account was much appreciated once our 6 month old went to bed. The location is a little far from the center but well connected with the Link line. 
4668327,44679816,2015-08-28,23358021,Joel,"The place was great, as advertised. Clean and convenient. Bri has it stocked and set up like a pro, we had no need to contact her for anything. "
4668327,45090222,2015-08-31,3504671,Lauren,"Bri's place was clean, spacious, quiet and comfortable! It was exactly what we needed - we used it as a quiet spot to get ready for a wedding. Location was perfect for what we needed, check-in was easy. I would recommend to anyone looking for a place to stay in the Beacon Hill neighborhood."
4668327,46407002,2015-09-10,41569297,Justin,"Bri is the epitome of a superhost. I don't even know where to begin! Bri was very accomodating. We ran into a potential issue in that we couldn't stay at her place for one of the nights we booked because of a booking issue, and Bri was so kind enough to book us a night at a BEAUTIFUL downtown Seattle hotel instead as compensation for not being able to stay at her place for that night. She's very thoughtful, and she has got to be the most generous host I've ever met. Most host probably wouldn't even care or go beyond the extra mile to make our trip to Seattle so worthwhile and seamless but Bri made the magic happen. 

Her place was spotless, clean, and very convenient for getting to and from downtown Seattle via the rail system. Her house is absolutely ADORABLE! Me and my fiancee felt so comfortable and relaxed staying here - as if it were our own home. Everything she stated in her guidebook for the house was very clear and easy to understand (ex: using Wifi, getting keys in the lockbox, house rules, and etc).  She was highly responsive to any questions or concern we had, and she made this experience one I'll never forget. 

Thank you Bri for being the best host I could ever ask for - you truly are a wonderful person and such a caring soul for providing us with such a lovely place to stay for our vacation. I highly recommend Bri as a host and I would suggest anyone looking to stay in Seattle to book an AirBnb experience with Bri! "
4668327,49646997,2015-10-05,37815916,Maggie,When we arrived we had to walk through a semi sketchy area to get to the bnb. We were pleasantly surprised when we got there. Bri's place was adorable and very homey. Everything was just as it looked and even better than the photos. 
4668327,51888367,2015-10-25,38081509,Chelsea,"Staying at Bri's place was perfect. It was super close to downtown which was nice. The fact that we could park at the end of the street for all day parking was great so we didn't have to worry about not getting up in time to move the car. 
Bri's home was very cozy and there is a market right up the street wich was convienent. If you are looking at visiting Seattle I would definitely recommend her place."
1340668,5688061,2013-07-11,924663,Matt,"I had the honor of being the first Airbnb guest in the lovely home of Tahoma, Laura, and Spencer. They easily rose to the challenge of new hosts, thanks to their friendly, generous, thoughtful and positive attitudes. They kindly invited me to join their BBQ dinner party with their extended family. It was a blast! I highly recommend staying here if you have the chance."
1340668,5858389,2013-07-19,5055002,James,"Easy to fine, easy parking.  Offered kitchen & laundry, far more than I needed.  Nice room and nice bed."
1340668,5900710,2013-07-21,7560039,Hermann,"Tahoma and Laura are wonderful hosts and made me feel right at home. The room is spacious and very clean. Spencer and I hit it off right away. The location is convenient. There is a running trail in the neighborhood. Grocery and restaurants are all within walking distance. The bus works great and I got in downtown for my meeting in 30 minutes.
I would highly recommend Tahoma and Co. I will definitely stay with them again next time in town."
1340668,5931980,2013-07-22,4719274,Kontien,Tahoma and Laura were really friendly and great at making sure I had everything I needed during my stay. 
1340668,6199895,2013-08-03,6439972,Adam,"Tahoma, Laura, and Spencer were all great hosts. Very easy to talk to and super accommodating. The room was spacious and clean, (and the washer/dryer was seriously the fanciest washer/dryer I have ever seen). Unfortunately I was working the entire time I was there. I wish I had more time to spend with them. Bus stops were very conveniently located a block away, and I either took the bus or biked to work each day."
1340668,6265475,2013-08-05,7853516,Jane,"Stayed one night with Tahoma and Laura and it was delightful! The room was clean and the bed was super cozy! It was super easy to get from the house right into downtown on the bus which was very helpful! I had a chance to chat with Laura, despite my short stay, and she was very welcoming and nice to talk with! I highly recommend staying with them!"
1340668,6314089,2013-08-07,4719526,Alex,"Had a wonderful stay. The room was very spacious and clean. We were able wash our clothes which was perfect timing for us. 

Although we didn't get to meet to Tahoma on our check in, we were welcomed by laura who let us check in later in the day which was was perfect for us. She also gave us local recommendations and was very warm and welcoming!  We would definitely stay here again and recommend to our friends!"
1340668,6360535,2013-08-09,7979369,Kevin,"I only stayed one night but the room was very nice, really clean and i felt safe and comfortable in the house. Tahoma was really nice and was more than ready to help out with anything i needed. Recommended. "
1340668,6491548,2013-08-14,1307603,Angelica,"My husband and I stayed here for a few days to explore Seattle. The location is very convenient and you can't beat the price. Laura, Tahoma's fiance is the one that handled everything in regards to our stay. She is extremely friendly and very accommodating. She asked if we would be cooking and brought down her cast iron skillet and small rice cooker for us to use. The bedroom is very clean with a large desk and was actually nicer than in the photo. She was very thoughtful and actually put in little items like Starbucks instant coffee, tea, sparkling water, a spare razor, shampoo and condition etc.  As I said above, her spot is very convenient for a few nights stay while exploring Seattle and you can't beat the price."
1340668,6571012,2013-08-17,7819216,Dominique,"great stay at Tohoma and Linda place.
Linda and Tohoma gave us some good advices and were ready to help us when necessary

house is as described
easy with the bus 358 to be downtown Seattle"
1340668,6702274,2013-08-21,994349,Michael,My stay was in a basement near the washer and dryer.  The room was nice but still needs a few things like a reading lamp.  The bed was excellent and the shared bath was decent.  A bike was promised but had a flat tire.  I think it's a bargain just needs some fine tuning.
1340668,6893882,2013-08-29,2286442,Chloe,"Tahoma was such a friendly host. Location was super convenient as    buses to downtown and the funky neighbourhoods of Freemont and Ballard can be caught from just around the corner. Roommate Trevor was barely around, but friendly when we did see him. Kitchen was pretty bare bones so if you're planning on doing your own cooking, scout it out first. Overall, this place worked for us."
1340668,7019612,2013-09-03,7803936,Oliver,"I had a great time in Seattle and at Tahoma and Laura's house.
The place is quite and nice just a reading lamp is missing :-). It is very easy to get to downtown by bus. The stop is just 2 blocks down.
This place is a bargain and an I would come back anytime again."
1340668,7253676,2013-09-13,8199171,Hannah,"Laura, Tahoma and Spencer were great hosts! Their space is great, though I agree with the previous reviewer that it could use a reading lamp. Their home is clean, comfy and in a great location for exploring the city (gotta love the Aurora express bus!)  mahalo for letting us stay while we find our new home in Seattle!"
1340668,7475897,2013-09-21,6199756,Jasmin,"Staying with Tahoma, Laura and Spencer was an absolute delight. They are prompt with communication and made it easy for me to arrive when they weren't home. The bedroom space is perfectly private, yet a comfortable community feel when you open the door to the dining area and the bathroom. The room was clean and cozy, yet spacious. They are wonderful people. I would stay here many times over!"
1340668,7756746,2013-10-01,7286165,Zac,"The bed was epic.   Extremely comfortable.   Really quiet.   I was pretty much gone all day but you get a lot with this daily rate.   Kitchen, laundry, and the bus is right there.   I gave it three because of Northgate and not because of the home.    There really isn't much to do in the neighborhood and eating options are slim to none in the neighborhood.   BUT there is no way in hell you are going to get this deal closer to the city.  So there you have it.   "
1340668,8323391,2013-10-25,20570412,Jessica,"The hosts were very nice and helpful, they had my puppy play with theirs upstairs while I was out and about. And I got to do laundry! "
1340668,9065056,2013-12-03,10243141,Sarah,"What a great place! I would recommend it to anyone coming to Seattle. Located near everything you need and Tahoma, Laura and Spencer couldn't been more welcoming and accommodating. "
1340668,10358172,2014-02-15,11083172,Todd,"Staying with Tahoma and Laura has been great. I've had great conversation with Spencer, Laura, and Tahoma... and shared a few glasses of wine. Their place has fit just right for me and my needs. The bed is super comfy! Thanks all!"
1340668,16874655,2014-08-03,19142801,Susi,"We only needed a short stay and this space was great, clean, comfortable, convenient and friendly hosts. I would recommend it. "
1340668,17071035,2014-08-06,18803577,Mikko,"We enjoyed staying with Tahoma and Laura, they were excellent hosts and gave us a lot of good advice and good conversation. The room was comfortable, the description was accurate and the neighbourhood is very nice.  We were pleasantly surprised by the clean and comfortable room. The connections to downtown Seattle are very easy to use and conveniently located. "
1340668,17633768,2014-08-15,13039725,Judy,"My stay at Tahoma and Laura's place was enjoyable. 
The room is in the basement with a separated entry.
The room is a decent size, coming with a super comfy bed (double/queen size?), a big desk and a closet space.
There are a shower and also a small kitchen and dinning area. 
You would share the basement area (kitchen and shower) with Spencer who is super friendly guy. 
The washer and dryer are right outside the room. 
Overall, the room is pretty quiet. The house is at a quiet block so you cannot really hear the traffic. You can hear footsteps and sometimes the voices from up stair, but that's what you get living in a house. I'm pretty used to it. 
One little complain though is the wifi. The connection at kitchen area is great, but not in the room. If you are like me who like to enjoy some before bed TV streaming, it might be sightly difficult. After Tahoma got the company to fix it (thank you!), it got better but still not ideal. But this situation did make me quit facebook and tv shows for a week. I won't say it's a bad thing really. 

I didn't hire a car during this trip, and the location of this house made it very easy for me to get around. 
E-Line will take you to the north and down south through Green Lake, Seattle Center to downtown where you can easily make connections to other neighborhoods like Capital Hill. (Also, free wifi one RapidRide!)
40 will take you to Ballard and Northgate. 
There are also little gems even just around the walking distance around neighborhood.
For  example, about 5-10 mins north, there is one amazing Mexican food truck next to Home Depot's parking lot. 
5 mins south, you get the Burger Mater with nice onion rings and milkshakes. A bit further south, you can find the Boardroom cafe. Free refilled coffee (decent coffee) and awesome breakfast balls and burittos. 
Yup, the main purpose of my trip this time was food adventure, and this place made my life pretty easy. "
1340668,17889775,2014-08-18,19587767,Brian,I enjoyed my stay! Spencer was very nice and the bed was very comfortable. 
1340668,18090864,2014-08-21,1787252,Megan,"What a terrific place to stay! The room is in the basement, no frills, but if you're just looking for a place to stay after wandering around Seattle all day, this is it. I met Tahoma, Spencer, and Laura, all wonderful, welcoming people.  It's really easy to get to the house by bus, just take the E line. It runs every 10 minutes or so and will have you downtown in 20. Highly recommend!"
1340668,32635853,2015-05-19,22046455,Sami,"We had a great stay. Cozy room, super sweet hosts and great location."
1340668,40587457,2015-08-01,18272703,Gaurang,"Tahoma has been a great host and is extremely warm and welcoming. I had an absolutely wonderful time at his apartment this summer. The connectivity to the local E-line buses (bus-stop is just a block away) is the best part. 
The wifi connectivity has some scope for improvement, otherwise the apartment description is accurate and there were no major glitches.
"
1340668,49129356,2015-10-01,14738223,Andrew,"Tahoma and his family made me feel very welcome. As far as the neighborhood goes it really is a short walk to Carkeek Park, and is relatively quiet. I found myself spending a lot of my spare time in Greenwood a short distance away. "
6411986,33329162,2015-05-26,33536991,Kjersten,"We loved staying here, plenty of space convent and easy to navigate. Great location especially if you have a car. Easy to get  to cap hill, downtown, bell town, etc. Also decently priced for Seattle."
6411986,33865720,2015-06-01,33941417,Julia,I enjoyed staying here. The space was neat and tidy and Tim was willing to answer any questions I had.
6411986,34576881,2015-06-09,34492770,Shani,"This was my first Airbnb experience and I loved it. Tim, the host is very friendly as well as his roommate Rob. The apartment was in good shape and it was easy to come in and out as we pleased since we had our own key. The location is pretty close to the city so it was very convenient to just take Uber or Lyft from the apartment to the city each day. I had a wonderful experience and I plan to use Airbnb again in the future."
6411986,35256703,2015-06-16,34967747,Rana,The description of the place was accurate. Tim was very nice and welcoming. He also offered to pick us up from the airport. He is very nice and gave us recommendations of places to visit. The location of the apartment is so close to downtown and convenient.
6411986,35842373,2015-06-22,20938607,Mark,"This was an awesome experience. The whole house is covered in super rad art, and Tim was a super gracious host. The room was clean and well appointed. It was clear how things worked and any house quirks. Its also a quick jaunt to a lot of rad areas in the city. Tim is cool and an engaging conversationalist. Thanks so much!!"
6411986,38293695,2015-07-14,30794763,Josh,"Tim was very helpful; he left a detailed note describing rules, amenities, and tips. Replied quickly, and offered directions on how to get there from the airport most efficiently.

The space itself was more cluttered than I would consider comfortable; not that it's not livable, but it seemed every counter, corner, and wall-space was packed and stacked.

The bathroom was in good condition, clean, albeit a tight squeeze, especially in the shower for 6'2"" me. Just be prepared.

I appreciated the extra blankets and sleeping bags! Most of them smelled like dog though, which was a bit off-putting. To be honest, I must have skipped over the part of the listing that said they had a dog. Totally my bad. The listing DOES say they have a dog.

The kitchen was a bit of a mess - there was a cloud of gnats around the sink the entire time. 

It got rather hot at night, and there's no AC or fans. Windows don't have screens (and those that do are ripped open), so I didn't feel comfortable leaving them open.

In summary, Tim was a gracious host, but the space could use some work.

P.S. We had far too much fun with Alexa, the Amazon Echo."
6411986,41110315,2015-08-04,17734710,Delphina,"We were really happy with this place!  Spacious living room and kitchen, garden and great we could use Netflix and plenty of other utilities. The bed was super comfortable. Nice decorations too, with an endless amount of books and movies. It's doable to walk to the center, otherwise a taxi won't cost much. Tim and his roommate are very nice and they helped us where necessary. Also, we basically had the whole spot to ourselves the whole weekend! "
6411986,45848567,2015-09-06,2966025,Laura,The bed was super comfy! Tim was out of town but his roommate Rob was very nice and welcoming.
6411986,46309920,2015-09-09,41384453,Heidi,"Tim was great from the get go, super prompt with all correspondence and very helpful directing out of towners :) the house is older but adorable, really nice just outside the city, and everything was very clean. The bed is large and comfortable, the bathroom is clean and large, and the linens were great. Tims roommate is very quiet and conscientious and was really helpful setting us up with getting into the house. Great for young people exploring the city!!"
7344117,39115395,2015-07-20,4563050,Tyler,"Jessie is both helpful and very personable. As we were her first air bnb guests after taking this home off of the 'for sale' market, there was still organizing and staging/setting up to finish when we arrived. We became the beta test for all future guests-- Jessie both provided us with an amazing compensation for any inconvenience that it may have caused, and some sparkling wine. Yum! The space is beautiful, five minutes from downtown, and we were more than happy with our experience. I would recommend this place to anybody that finds it on line. Thank you, Jessie!"
7344117,39563433,2015-07-24,38705918,Yue,Jessie is a really nice person. You will have a nice experience here. We guys had a really terrific time in Seattle!
7344117,39843196,2015-07-26,23228855,Todd,"I had the pleasure of meeting Jesse for our two night stay in Seattle at the Loft and I can honestly say I've never been so welcomed by an airbnb host. She made us feel very welcome, and had all the information we needed for our stay at the ready, tailored for our travel plans. There was a cold beer waiting for me upon arrival and a few food items to help us between meals. She definitely went the extra mile and has aspired me to up my own hosting game. 

The loft is as advertized, great for groups, and its location is ideal; a short taxi straight down the street into DT, we even walked once. 

I would definitely request the loft for my next visit to Seattle. I spoke with Jessie about some of her ambition to make the suite even more enjoyable and I'm excited about her plans. 

Highly Recommended! "
7344117,40808574,2015-08-02,20102906,Alex,"Jessie's AirBNB was a great environment for our startup work retreat. It was spacious, clean, and well-equipped for our needs. Jessie was pleasant to work with and super helpful in recommending restaurants nearby. Also loved that she had the kitchen stocked with snacks and drinks."
7344117,40979628,2015-08-03,5198922,Bobby,Jessie was great and so was her home.  She was friendly and very flexible in helping make our stay wonderful.  The home is new and has a great view from the top deck.  There are 3 beds and two futons that convert to a bed along with a twin mattress available for sleeping.  Bonus - there's a great pop and shoot basketball game on the ground floor along with a parking spot out back so you don't have to street park.
7344117,41271119,2015-08-05,39424373,Jenna,"This is a wonderful place for a family to stay.  With 2 teen boys, we were happy to have the space and the apt was beautiful. Clean and fresh. Jessie was way more than a great host. She accommodated any need we had and was infinitely flexible around key pick up. This is our first air b&b experience and Jessie set the bar high."
7344117,42170043,2015-08-11,874504,Lisa,"Our stay in this Airbnb was lovely.  It was a pleasure to stay in this well situated, light and airy loft.  Jessie was so wonderful to deal with in every manner.  The loft was filled with beautiful flowers from her garden, light billowing in through large windows, a stocked refrigerator & pantry, beautiful linens & towels, a mac computer and plenty of games...everything we needed and more.  The location is excellent; either a 10 - 15 minute drive to all points of interest, a bus out front or a short Uber to Central Link.  A grocery store is within easy walking distance (3 blocks) or a small grocer and coffee shop is steps away.  Jessie was an incredible host, available to answer questions and recommend restaurants and travel destinations throughout our stay.  She also picked us up at the station and delivered us to the loft.  At one point we had a small issue in the apartment and Jessie had it taken care of within an hour.  We saw beautiful sunsets from the balcony every night.  "
7344117,43280240,2015-08-18,552874,Jason,"Jessie's place was a fantastic spot to stay in Seattle for a couple of nights. We had a car with us as we visited the Boeing factory and hiked up to Cascade Pass and it was great to have off-street parking right under the apartment. The place has everything you need and was perfect for 2 couples, but could be also hold a lot more people. We had a problem with the bed, but Jessie was super responsive and she's the type of host who is really making sure her guests have a great stay no matter what mishaps might happen along the way."
7344117,43567003,2015-08-20,2165015,Caroline,"Jessie is like you wish every airbnb host to be; generous, kind, prepared and responsive. The space is beautiful and I would recommend it to anybody. "
7344117,43824371,2015-08-22,33461579,Meghan,"Jessie was an amazing host! We were the first larger group (7) to be hosted, and even as the beta testers, all of us felt more than welcome. There were all sorts of little touches that made us feel at home. It was nice to have a little reference sheet with anything we might need and takeout menus for little spots close by. Jessie even came back with extra towels just to ensure we had plenty. Given the opportunity, I think that it's safe to say we'd stay there again. "
7344117,44669095,2015-08-28,5775657,Melissa,"My coworkers and I had a great stay in Jessie's place! It looks exactly like the photos. I wish we wouldn't have had to work all week so we could have spent more time enjoying it and playing games there. Jessie was extremely helpful and attentive, and consistently made sure we had everything we needed. There were plenty of places to sleep and great workspace for early morning conference calls. The food and drinks provided made a late night arrival so much better! And the location was just a short Uber or Lyft ride to everywhere we needed to go, if we weren't up for walking those steep Seattle hills. I'd definitely recommend Jessie's place!"
7344117,45107443,2015-08-31,3687585,Bradley,"Jessie hosted our family during our wedding weekend. We live in downtown Seattle, and location is very convenient. Jessie was the best host you could ask for: accommodating, helpful, communicative. Our family had a fantastic stay here, beautiful space.  She is very willing to help out and make your stay great. We will definitely look here first when looking at future stays in Seattle."
7344117,45527421,2015-09-03,7525420,Annalyn,Loved staying here! Very spacious and clean. Jessie was very kind and helped us get situated. There's a coffee shop a block a way and a bus stop right in front. Would definitely recommend staying here! Space fits lots of people!
7344117,45959597,2015-09-07,38579736,Jill,"Jessie was an amazing and thoughtful host. She went far beyond hospitable and the house was loaded with everything we needed and so much more!

The layout of the house was perfect for our 7 member family to find individual privacy and spacious gathering rooms packed with games and activities. 

 Thank you so very much, Jessie. We had a wonderful vacation!"
7344117,46599337,2015-09-12,19542277,Hoda,"Super welcomed! She greeted us when we arrived, and reached out to us prior to arrival, asking if there was anything we needed or recommendations for our time in Seattle. Jessie is extremely thoughtful, kind, funny, and open to suggestions and feedback to make her place as awesome as possible for all of her guests!"
7344117,46728202,2015-09-13,2126518,Tom,"Jessie and her apartment were fantastic. The space is completely unique, and in such a great location to amazing restaurants and bars as well as downtown. We wish we could have stayed longer as Jessie made everything so easy. Thanks for such a great stay! We'll be back!!!"
7344117,47416865,2015-09-18,10914817,Johannes,"Jesse was an extremely helpful and flexible host. The unit was clean, spacious, in a great location and overall just really cool! Great for groups."
7344117,48716945,2015-09-28,5285011,Chrissy,"Jessie was amazing! Highly recommend the loft for large groups, worked out perfectly for the team ;)"
7344117,49477938,2015-10-04,42863549,Patrick,Nice big loft - great location - wished I was in town more than one night!
7344117,49939154,2015-10-07,45226966,Sara,"My kids and I really enjoyed our stay at this stunning home. Jessie made us feel very welcome when we arrived. The location is very good - in just 20 minutes or so of walking you can reach Union Station, downtown Seattle and if you don't feel like walking there is a bus stop directly outside."
7344117,51966747,2015-10-25,3076072,Andrew,Jessie's spot was the perfect crash pad for my group of friends while we visited seattle.  Plenty of space for hangin out and cooking.  Thank you!
7344117,52467294,2015-10-29,4768515,Travis,"Jessie was incredibly friendly and accommodating. I knew nothing about Seattle and she was more than happy to give suggestions. The house was very interesting. Lots of space put together in some very creative ways. I have to be honest, the photos seemed to suggest that the materials of the house (floors, railings, lights, etc.) were of a higher quality than they are. But I can be kind of a snob about such things. I think this place is perfect for families or sports fans, as there's only one really luxurious sleeping room. The rest is great for kids and college ppl. Overall we really enjoyed our time there. "
7344117,52664981,2015-10-31,34038727,Fangchao,I have a wonderful experience here. The loft is pretty and its location is convenient too. Do not hesitate to live here.
7344117,52731375,2015-11-01,45735694,Jaclyn,The place was lovely and perfect for our group! Jessie was great with communication and made our time in WA much easier. 
7344117,53099068,2015-11-04,21616327,Trudy,"It's not often you get to be in a location with five levels. The location came with one parking spot and then there was ample street parking available. It is so close to food and downtown that in terms of convenience the location is perfection.  We had issues connecting to the internet it was on and off so ultimately we tethered with our cell phones.  Jessie was incredibly responsive- she replied to inbox messages and text messages in minutes so it was very easy to work with her.  She gave us a tour, passed on the keys and made recommendations for local places to get groceries etc.  The shower in the master bedroom had heated floors and a tub fit for royalty. We definitely indulged. Overall the experience was great."
7344117,53700673,2015-11-11,19841514,Ryan,"Thanks Jessie! Your loft was wonderfully accommodating. All my guests loved the space and proximity to downtown. And the weather was perfect... Thanks again!

Ryan"
7344117,54600100,2015-11-22,37738619,Mark,Jessie was a great host. The loft was perfect. I would recommend this location to people. It was close to downtown. Thank you very much. 
7344117,55427470,2015-12-01,46942848,Chris,"Jessie's place was exactly as I expected. Although I had my own car there, I took an uber a few times and it wasn't more than $10 to get to the local grocery store. She had plenty of extra beds laid out as well as some food and drinks in the fridge and pantry. The master bedroom bed is extremely comfy. I would recommend this place to anyone, Jessie treated me very well. "
7344117,55820472,2015-12-06,18930678,John,"House was AWESOME! Greatly exceeded my expectations in size and amenities. Extremely roomy and very well-appointed. Views were amazing. 

Jessie was a fantastic host. Very easy to get in touch with and super flexible. Would highly recommend."
7344117,55971734,2015-12-07,14042192,Adam,"Fun, funky space that's spacious and as described in the listing. Great for a group with both shared and private spaces."
7344117,56440378,2015-12-13,33916152,Katrina,"I rented this space for an appreciation party for 5 ladies and it was fantastic! Plenty of space for everyone to sleep, with lots of room to spare. We had a large dinner and the kitchen was plenty big for all of our cooking. One suggestion would be for a bigger/longer dining table. Otherwise, the space suited us perfectly. Thanks, Jessie!"
7344117,57977192,2015-12-30,38593786,Brent,"This row home was amazing - 5 floors, lots of space and bedding. The games (basketball, poker table, etc) were icing on the cake. Jessie is really laid back, was very accommodating for our work group. The area is close to DT with no shortage of amenities. The full kitchen allowed us to go grocery shopping and make an excellent dinner. A bottle of wine from Jessie and various items in the fridge made the experience that much better. Highly recommended. "
1433440,10445762,2014-02-18,8364019,Jen,The reservation was canceled 104 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
1433440,15350819,2014-07-07,16208837,Brie,"Susan was so lovely and helpful, always making suggestions about activities in the surrounding area. The house is very nice, clean and airy and the bed beats any bed at a hotel. You get a private bathroom and a large closet. The Columbia City neighborhood has many cute shops, a great bakery (Columbia City Bakery), an awesome diner for breakfast (Geraldine's), and a wonderful spot for an afternoon beer and some soccer watching (The Columbia City Ale House) - the bartenders are the sweetest. And you are a 5 minute walk from the light rail! Such an easy area to stay in, especially if you want a calm, cozy, small-town vibe to come back to at the end of a long, eventful day in downtown. I would stay at Susan's again in a heartbeat. "
1433440,15559235,2014-07-11,17656344,Andrew & Clare,"Susan and her place were great! If you want to be on the light rail (SeaTac) near everything to see in Seattle, this is the spot! Susan was very endearing and if you like dogs, Lucia is adorable and well-behaved."
1433440,22823693,2014-11-16,16394914,Julie,"I stayed with Susan for about 4 months. During my stay, Susan was very accommodating and hospitable. She made me feel right at home the minute I moved to Seattle and often gave helpful insight into activities & events going on in the area and often invited me to join company she had.  The house was always kept extraordinarily clean and it was a HUGE plus having my own private bathroom. The neighborhood also has beautiful aesthetics and very friendly neighbors! The close proximity to downtown/market and Capitol Hill also made staying here super convenient on the weekends - either a short Light Rail ride or a quick Uber :) I would certainly stay at Susan's place again.
"
1433440,25163933,2015-01-08,5255859,Tasha,"My husband and I stayed with Susan for a month during our initial move to Seattle. She made us feel extremely welcome and we immediately hit it off and felt right at home. Susan was super helpful with suggestions in the neighborhood and for tips during our apartment search and move. The room is quiet and comfortable, and the big walk-in closet space and private bathroom are a big plus. 
Susan's hospitality was amazing and she was incredibly warm and generous. We had a great time. And her dog Lucia is the cutest! Thanks Susan!"
1433440,27923163,2015-03-15,24582391,Justin,"Susan was a wonderful host! She cleared ample space for my groceries, allowed me to use any of her spices, and even fed me on a number of occasions. She also bought something to clean the inside of my car when I mentioned needing to get that done. The house is very nice and spacious. Comfortable bed, great walk-in closet, Roku in bedroom, big private bath, new washer/dryer that's almost always available, and awesome patio w/ fireplace for the upcoming spring/summer months! Lucia the dog is an incredibly friendly companion. "
1433440,31044013,2015-05-01,29192289,Lauren,"Susan had a very nice home. It was clean upon arrival and throughout our stay and she was kind enough to provide towels and toiletries for the month. The area of Columbia City is cool. Lots of places walking distance if you want to get food or drinks, coffee or see a movie. Also an easy drive to downtown or a quick trip on the light rail, which is also close to walk to. It was a decent place to stay while we looked for places to move in the area. She has a nice and cute dog which we had to watch when she went out of town for a few days. I would say overall the experience was pleasant. On a few occasions it felt like we were living in our Moms house though. Her son is also living in the house. It was maybe just a little too crowded for us towards the end. "
1433440,41056248,2015-08-04,26079089,Jessica,"Staying with Susan was my first experience using Airbnb, and it was absolutely excellent! Susan was so kind and welcoming, she always included me whenever the opportunity arose. I stayed with her for just over two months, and had a fabulous time. She always had recommendations of things to do, places to explore, and new things to try. Her home is lovely, with a very spacious bedroom, and her pup Lucia was so stinking cute, always giving a warm welcome! Her home is an ideal place to stay for anyone who wants easy access to downtown Seattle without paying downtown hotel prices. The light-rail is a short walk from her home, and you can pretty much get anywhere you need to go from there, or using the bus system. The little shops and restaurants of Columbia City were also a short walk away; I absolutely loved the little pizza place down there, with true flatbread pizza! I would highly recommend a stay with Susan, whether for a few nights, or a few months, she was truly a great host."
1433440,43377409,2015-08-19,36608271,Larry,"The host did not make us welcome.  She wasn't even there for several days after we arrived. The room was small, but as pictured.  The room was hot.  The host turned the air conditioner off at night and we could not sleep with window open because of noise and light.  The room was very light at night. The blind gave us some privacy, but did not block the bright outside lights.  The microwave was filthy and I had to ask the host to clean it. There were black spots on the towel provided."
1433440,44317083,2015-08-25,8904328,William,"My husband and I found this listing to be perfect for us.  We had easy light rail access, free parking when we did rent a car, and an ideal location near to children in Seattle and Tacoma.  Susan was delightful and knowledgable about Seattle plus we found our transactions with her to be easy and simple.  Her home is lovely with modern, high-end kitchen and our own private bathroom.  Our bedroom had an exceptionally comfy bed plus a desk and plenty of closet space.  All of this came at a very fair price.  We would absolutely stay there again.  Thank you, Susan"
1433440,44813498,2015-08-29,24802382,Cheryl,"The place was in a good location to drive into the city. It is located in a new and quiet subdivision. The room is on the smaller side and the bed is a double but comfortable. Both the room & bathroom were clean. There was a bit of a mixup with the code to get into the place as it was changed 3 times before we got one that worked. It would have been nice to have something for breakfast being that it is listed on airbnb but there are places to eat nearby. The place worked for our 2 night stay in Seattle. Loved the friendly dog who eagerly rolls over for stomach rubs.
"
1433440,49708773,2015-10-05,15998372,Richard,"Susan was awesome. We really enjoyed her and her dog who was also super pleasant and welcoming. The room was quite nice and quiet.  We didn't spend much time there during our 3-day stay but the television and Roku seemed very effective if needed. We had our own bathroom right next to our room.  The room also had a walk-in closet which was fantastic.  We were able to get some stuff out of our suit cases and re-organize from our long trip. 

Well done Susan!"
1433440,50794044,2015-10-14,8015121,Martin,Our stay with Susan was a great experience! Susan was very friendly and helpful and made us feel very welcome. There is plenty of on street parking nearby and the walk to the light rail was quick and easy. Highly recommend to anyone!
1433440,52965017,2015-11-03,3790897,Ashley,"Public Review:

Susan's home is comfortable and new construction. The large bathroom and closet were great amenities. Susan was communicative and open as a host. She truly knows her neighborhood, Columbia City, and is happy to share information about anything from local politics to where to buy groceries. 

Staying with Susan was great for our first two weeks in Seattle. She was flexible and welcoming to us in planing our stay."
7245586,42340312,2015-08-12,17857524,Nils Philip,"The stay was good even if the host seem quite new on Airbnb. Some routines like how to check out could be good and also there is a need for shaping up the place, some cleaning could be good, especially the shower. On the other hand the host really tried to make it a good stay for us, the location is good in a nice neighbor and the prices is really good if you compare similar locations. Also the separate entre is really nice! The place really have potential! "
7245586,48540689,2015-09-27,40447852,Tope,"I stayed at this location for a month. I never met Tania but I did meet her father twice. They rent out all the rooms in the house. There were only a couple of people there when I was there. I stayed in a basement room. There was a bathroom on the same floor but the kitchen was upstairs. There was a minifridge by the room. The basement has a private side entrance that they recently added a keycode deadbolt in. The door to the room itself wasn't that great, it didn't feel very secure but I had the only key and nothing was taken. The neighborhood is nice, it was a short bus ride away from the university and hospital so it was what I needed. The room itself was unremarkable, it is as pictured with a full size bed. The room had a peculiar odor that reminded me of cat litter and felt damp at times. I asked for air freshener and was told to buy some at the local store. My stay had ups and downs and I can't say that I would do it again given the choice. The bathroom shower was short and cramped and the smell was off putting. However given the location it suited my needs. "
7134759,45533578,2015-09-03,3192103,Nik,Great place and a great host.  Would stay there again anytime. 
7134759,45890935,2015-09-06,3758887,Timothy,It was a great neighbourhood super close to good restaurants and easy transit.The place is quite and clean.
7134759,46222504,2015-09-08,5051746,Julia,"Elin was a great host! Her home is clean and modern, and the bed was quite comfortable. The neighborhood is great -- there are a lot of restaurants, bars, and shops within walking distance. "
7134759,46829813,2015-09-13,27507633,Monica,"We had a great 2-nite stay at Elin's. We had just landed in Seattle (from San Francisco),and she was very helpful in getting us there. The space was very private, even though it was in her townhouse- we had  a different floor than the main living area was on, w/our own bathroom (and use of kitchen if we wanted). This was located within walking distance to Ballard, which is a very hip neighborhood w/lots of restaurants and cool nightime scene. The price was very affordable and half of what we would have paid at a hotel. It was our first experience staying in someone's home and was a very pleasant one. We actually spent the next 6 nites on our trip using AirBnB rooms because of our time at Elin's. Would totally recommend to any one wanting to check out Seattle- great transit system too."
7134759,47135334,2015-09-15,43822016,Alan,"Fantastic place to stay! Short walk to Ballard attractions and restaurants, as well as bus lines downtown. The room and private bathroom were immaculately clean and the bed very comfortable. Elin is a kind and attentive host. Would definitely stay here again!"
7134759,48659918,2015-09-27,45022502,Yana,"Elin's home is comfortable, clean, and in a fabulous location. The bed was nice and firm (my favorite!) and the balcony off the room was a lovely connection to the crisp weather the weekend I was there. Elin has done a great job describing her place genuinely well and I highly recommend staying here if you're interested in exploring Ballard."
7134759,49381714,2015-10-03,44871031,Linda,Our week stay at Elin's  was fabulous.  The Room was very well done.  The bed was so comfortable and the room very homey and inviting. There was also access to a well equipped kitchen. The location is perfect if you are wanting the Ballard downtown area as well as a walk away from the locks and beautiful botanical garden.  We are planning to stay on our next visit as well.  Thank you Elin.
7134759,49865983,2015-10-06,27362364,Ben,Great stay these three days.  Bed was super comfy and the little desk in the room was perfect for working during the day.  Great location within walking distance to food and coffee.  Great communication from Elin.  Highly recommend.
7134759,50370537,2015-10-11,3903741,Ariel,"This room was outfitted like a very nice hotel suite. I enjoyed my stay there. Very comfortable bed/linens. Quiet. Great location. Parking was a little tricky, but could always find a spot within two blocks."
7134759,51337207,2015-10-19,45110752,Jo Anne,"Elin communicated with us and told us our door code.  It worked well for us except once and we texted her and she took care of that.  The queen sized bed was comfortable and having a balcony was a plus.  The house is located near the heart of Ballard which was very important to us as our son lives nearby and we could walk to everything.  The room temp was comfortable and the few times we ran into Elin, she was very friendly and helpful."
7134759,52731647,2015-11-01,26251543,Jessica,"The location was great and close to  Ballard core and bus lines to Fremont and downtown. The room itself was cozy; the bed was super comfortable. I liked the little balcony outside too. Elin was very kind and let us keep our bags in the house even after checking out, as we had a late flight. Would stay here again!"
7134759,53076266,2015-11-04,31686641,Stephanie,My boyfriend and I enjoyed our time at Elin's lovely tow home. It was cozy and in a really great neighborhood. Would recommend to anyone visiting Seattle who wants to stay out of the thick of the city and experience how living in Seattle can actually be.
7134759,53984263,2015-11-15,10664522,Bradlee,"Listing was as described and was in a very convenient location to great bars and restaurants in Ballard.  We enjoyed our stay and the price was very reasonable. Shower items (towels, soap, shampoo) were provided as well!  The bed and the pillows we're a little stiff for my liking but not enough to loose sleep."
7134759,54452377,2015-11-20,11344605,Nefer,"I was in town for a week-long work event in the area and thoroughly enjoyed my stay at Elin's place. The private room had everything I needed to get work done and the furnishings were quite comfortable, tidy, and clean. The area is walkable to all the conveniences of Market Street and my personal favorite place for breakfast, Portage Bay (just two blocks away). If I'm ever in town for a work event, I would stay here again."
7134759,54876984,2015-11-25,8501363,Dawn,"We had an awesome stay in Elin's Airbnb, she was an awesome host! The room was fantastic, clean and very comfortable. Location was incredibly convenient as well, as it is just a couple blocks off Ballard's main street. The keypad is a nice addition and was great since we came in from our flight quite late so it was nice being able to get in without having to wake anyone up. I would highly recommend staying here. "
7134759,56887241,2015-12-19,1192364,Muriel,"Elin's place is wonderful, I was lucky to be able to stay there for 8 nights and I wish I booked a longer stay.
I rented the master bedroom with my own bathroom.
Her house is spotless, very welcoming, very quiet. The bed is super comfortable, I was able to rest in a peaceful environment.
Parking is pretty easy on the street. 
Elin is really nice and well educated young woman and she respects your privacy.
I would definitely stay at her place again and I highly recommend Elin's house."
4396961,28692170,2015-03-28,14366553,Meet,Jerome did a great job welcoming me. Was very prompt with responses. The room was ready when I arrived and it fit the description perfectly. Really glad to have lived here.

The room is very well-kept (btw, Jerome renovated the room all by himself!) and very clean. What's more interesting is the host himself. Jerome is a super friendly guy, very helpful, and very smart! If you're into engineering, ask him about his inventions! Very inspiring!"
4396961,32032985,2015-05-12,12104454,Janet,"My second time staying at Jerome's place.  This time I tried the roomy ""Grey Room"" and loved it because of the morning light & the view off the deck! Again, Jerome is such a nice host - helpful with luggage, directions, information, & usually has an extra banana or orange to share! His place is REALLY neat, clean and organized. I enjoy the Leschi area & felt very safe my entire visit!"

Jerome is an awesome host, cheerful and friendly. I had the chance to have really nice discussion with him. He is open minded and knows a lot about life. 

I liked his house. Clean, and easy to live. In a really quite area, but still walking distance to the lake, Chinatown or buses to go where ever you want :) "
4396961,32867456,2015-05-22,8027646,Susan,Jerome welcomed me like an old friend. His space was clean and comfortable. He helped me navigate the bus system and gave me some good tips.

4396961,35698523,2015-06-21,34530431,Alexey,"Jerome was a really welcome host. He made my first experience using airbnb very positive. He helped me with directions to his place and made good suggestion about places which could be visited in Seattle. 

The grey room was also good. From a balcony you will have a great view on the downtown of Bellevue. It has a large comfortable bed and a desk if you need to work. WiFi worked only for my tablet, not for my laptop. "
4396961,36234263,2015-06-26,27188461,Omer,This is the second time im staying at jeromes house and like i said before The place is amazing quite comfortable clean well maintained.  Jerome is a wonderful man! Definitely recommended.
4396961,36625358,2015-06-29,17127083,Devika,"Jerome was a wonderful host. He was really hospitable and made sure I had everything I needed, and very accommodating about any requests I made. The room was exactly as pictured - quite large and comfortable and opens onto a small balcony. Jerome made sure it was clean and stocked with everything I needed (sheets, towels etc.) The neighborhood is residential and felt quite safe to me even when I returned late at night. There is adequate public transport linking the area to downtown Seattle.

One thing I really likes about staying here is that Jerome has a great system for coordinating the space his houseguests share. The bathrooms are clean, things are clearly labelled, instructions provided where required, and the spaces in the fridge and kitchen are color-coordinated which makes everything pretty efficient. 

I stayed only for a weekend but Jerome made me feel really welcome. He a great guy and always ready for a fun chat, and was really helpful about providing tips about how to get around Seattle etc. Would definitely recommend!"

Not too far from most of the main attractions in Seattle and there is a very nice view of Lake Washington from the 2nd floor balcony.  The room is clean, comfortable, and has everything you need.  Jerome was also very helpful in giving me information about where to go and what to do in the city.  Truly a great host!"
4396961,37883762,2015-07-11,1624707,Janine,"Jerome was the best host I have ever had!  Friendly, informative and funny.  He had an endless supply of fruit and cold water.

4396961,39255299,2015-07-21,34915182,Valerie,"This was my second stay with Jerome and I couldn't be happier with my experience. He's located a short walk to 3 different bus stops in a very safe and friendly neighborhood. He's added seating on the balcony which has a fantastic view of the city. Everything was comfortable and clean and very safe. One of the bonuses to staying here was meeting fellow travelers from all over the world. Jerome is a wonderful host, he provides fresh fruit and water bottles and always has interesting stories.  I can't wait to come back 'home' to stay again soon! "
4396961,39796269,2015-07-26,6065278,Robyn,"Jerome was very welcoming and hospitable. He stayed up to greet us despite a delay in our arriving flight, and showed us around. Additionally, he was very kind and offered us water, fruit, and advice on how to get around. "

The balcony was super cool and had a nice view. The neighborhood was nice, pretty quiet. "

4396961,42758776,2015-08-15,39661838,Mariko,"I was so surprised that Airbnb offers an amazing opportunity meeting with Jerome. 
Jerome was really nice and friendly. I and my friend talked with him every morning and evening. We had a lot of communication and fun time a lot!
He helped us a lot; going to meet us, carrying luggage, helping to taking buses and so on! 
In this house, Fresh fruits like berries, grapes, bananas, apples and strawberries are always ready in the refrigerator. I was very happy to have them as a breakfast.   
Also, the hose and rooms are so clean and beautiful.
Grey Room is so big and very comfortable.
There are a big bed, desk and sofa and closet. 
From our room, we have big terrace and can see grateful view of Seattle. So fantastic. We can relax the bed so much. 
Accessing to Seattle downtown is also good! Many buses are going to Seattle and University of Washington. We actually didn't have a car. However, nothing inconvenience. 
Anyways, I really appreciate Jerome's kindness. 
We definitely want to come back to his house again and recommend to everyone to stay his house!"
4396961,45157869,2015-08-31,39397211,Thong,The listing was accurate. The room was great! It has everything I had expected it would be.

I would definitely come back to visit again!
4396961,46518775,2015-09-11,42328750,Jose,"Jerome Gipson was a really good host, providing us water, fruit and good advices about our safety and where to go. His house was always clean and quiet. It is well located in a very good neighborhood, just 2 blocks away from the bus stop that drives you directly to downtown in 20 minutes. 
The Grey Room was comfortable with acces to a balcony which has a beautiful view of the landscape (Mount Rainier). 
If I need to go back to Seattle, for sure Jerome's house will be my first choice."

4396961,49401546,2015-10-03,35639492,Joy,"Jerome went above and beyond his hosting duties for me. I lent me some tools to use on my home improvement project that were a life-saver. The listing was 100% accurate since I had to have a desk in my room as well. House was kept really clean and neat, with clear directions on everything. Jerome was also super chatty, had great stories, and tons of personality which was welcome after a long day. Neighborhood was quiet, easy to find parking, yet close to the city. Morning sunrise and Lake Washington view from the balcony was absolutely beautiful. If I could give 6 stars I would!"

I was visiting family for the thanksgiving holiday, and couldn't have been happier with the experience. I highly highly recommend, and will be staying here on my next Seattle trip."
9580021,55336410,2015-11-29,49570402,Frances,"The Hampton Court was a wonderful base for my visit to Seattle. And as a single female traveler, I always felt safe in the building and in the Capitol Hill neighborhood. Matthew was a very gracious host: prompt with communications, and  gave great ideas for lesser known places to visit within walking distance. The apartment was nicely furnished, cozy and had everything I needed for my urban oasis: a comfy bed, high-end bath products to instant oatmeal and Tazo tea to start my day. The views from the rooftop of the Olympics and of the Space Needle really brought the authentic Seattle experience. I would recommend this place to friends."
9580021,56699108,2015-12-16,7356124,Lori,"This little gem is in one of the best neighborhoods in Seattle. Walking distance to so many, restaurants, great bars, book stores new and used, Asian Art museum and Volunteer park. Plus two buses just a few blocks away go straight downtown. 

Matthew was a superb host. The apartment was clean, and thoughtfully appointed with everything you will need, plus little extras that really made it feel special. The bed was the most comfortable I have ever slept in away from home and even the water pressure was excellent, little things you don't realize you miss until you're without them.

Really pleased we found this place, definitely recommend!"

Melinda is really friendly and made us feel welcome in her home. The neighborhood seems very nice (unfortunately our visit was quite short and we didn't get much time to explore), the journey downtown was only about 15 mins by bus. "
8294379,55011419,2015-11-27,516686,Paul,"The space was perfect place for us, as we had family in town. It was very clean and well stocked with everything we needed. The location is very central, as it is close to downtown, U-District and Capitol Hill, which provide many of the great places to see and eat here in Seattle. Thank you again Melinda!"
8294379,56463453,2015-12-13,29068286,Michael,"Melinda and the space were great! I honestly didn't know what to expect since this was the first time I crashed with a stranger, but Melinda was super welcoming, kind, and a great conversationalist. The room and private bathroom were clean and comfortable. Great water pressure in the shower too (really.... Everyone should know the water pressure before they stay somewhere!). The location is pretty close to the city and there are some great spaces nearby for morning coffee or food (my fav was Voxx coffee)

Thanks Melinda!!!"

Although we never met (he left keys and a code) all of our communication was timely and pleasant. Plus he has the best wifi password ever. Recommend and would stay again. "
8755762,54302477,2015-11-17,47954816,지선,"인테리어와 호스트분의 관대함은 만족하였으나,
청결 상태가 전반적으로 많이 미흡하였습니다.. 특히 샤워 후 몸 닦는 검정 타월은 최악이었습니다. 물도 닦이지 않고 검은 털이 몸에 다 묻어서 다시 씻을 정도였습니다.. "
8755762,54475713,2015-11-20,6904454,Greg & Johann,"The 4 of us stayed 1 night on our way to Portland. Great location and place in Capital Hill! Building lives up to its historic name and is very old, but it's clean and has well-lit hallways. The 1 bedroom's interior design is very unique and quite roomy. Bathroom has charm, but dated (the separate super hot and cold faucets were not ideal and no one opted to use the shower). However, having 2 sets of keys was useful!

Rah is very sweet and left us morning croissants, which the guys devoured enjoyably. He is quick to respond and always very cheery. I would suggest asking him specific questions, otherwise you might not get the whole answer at once (i.e. when asking about key exchange, we received an answer of building door code but without the actual code numbers...or when asking about WiFi, we just got the password but not the network name). In addition, Rah tried to be helpful when one of us lost his watch (thanks for checking).

On a side note, overnight parking is insanely hard to find (parkade was actually for students only), especially since we arrived late evening. We ended up just using the 2 hour spots for overnight and woke up at 8 AM to pay through the phone, so then at leasr we didn't need to move the car until 10 AM.

Overall, this is a great stay for 1 night. I really liked being able to walk home from a night out in Capital Hill. Thanks for hosting and all your help, Rah!"
8755762,54899050,2015-11-25,23990951,Karl,Rah was great! Very responsive to my messages and circled back the day I arrived to make sure everything was in order. I wanted to be in the Capital Hill neighborhood and his place was perfect for exploring the area. Great bars and restaurants and a lot of young people. Definitely would recommend if you're looking for a tastefully decorated flat in Cap Hill! 
8755762,55055773,2015-11-27,44426163,Kelsey,Great neighborhood and location. Capitol Hill has a lot to offer. Rah was super helpful and easy to communicate with. 
8755762,55217999,2015-11-29,46175323,Paula,It was great
8755762,55662104,2015-12-04,46596023,McLean,"We loved staying in this flat!  Very unique and hip, as well as comfortable.  My wife and I loved the decor as well as the chandelier lights being on dimmers.  Only a 10 minute walk to the Paramount theater where we were going to a show.  Location overall was great, although parking was a bit of a pain.  We ended up paying $22 plus tax for 24 hours to stay in the lot a block up the same street (evening/overnight parking only goes until 8am) the parking garage across the street said we would have to be out by 7am to make room for the college students.  Raj was very easy to communicate with and answered texts promptly.  Next time we come to Seattle for a show, we will definitely try to stay here again!"
8755762,55744911,2015-12-05,49625109,Alison,"extremely kind and accommodating. 
thanks again.

8755762,56133794,2015-12-09,8434392,Jose,"Rah's place is in an absolutely perfect location. It is right in the heart of Capitol Hill, super close to all of the best bars, restaurants and shops and only a few minute walk from downtown. The place itself has its obvious charm and Rah has set it up in a way that makes you feel very cozy. It is noticeably old and is a bit smaller than you expect it to be. The bedroom isn't properly separated from the living room so there is no privacy if you have more than two staying, but the location, comfiness and interesting decorum more than overcome its shortcomings. I would definitely stay there again. Thanks Rah. "
8755762,56608595,2015-12-15,14591138,Melissa,"Rah's place is glam and so gorgeous!  It's perfectly located in Capitol Hill and walking distance to everything (Broadway, Pike, Pine, even Belltown and downtown if you feel like it). Rah was quick to respond to my questions and I truly felt right at home in his space (I didn't want to leave). I highly recommend staying here."
8755762,56729440,2015-12-17,11272674,Tara,The place was a great location in capital hill! Central to lots of amenities. Funky decor and super soft bed. 
8755762,57308006,2015-12-24,2734255,Luiz,"Rah's apartment in Seattle is great. It's really well located, with lots of good bars and restaurants within walking distance. We loved Honey Hole (a sandwich place), and Top Pot (a donut place/bakery). The apartment has a really cool feel and great decorations. Rah left us lots of local recommendations for things to do as well. Great place!"
8755762,57673106,2015-12-28,9176496,Elaine,"Staying at Rah's is certainly a unique Seattle experience with tons of personality. Located in the perfect spot just off bustling Pine Street, the unit is great for people who want to check out Capitol Hill and stay in walking distance of downtown and pike place.  It's an older building so things are a bit ""rustic"", but the decor makes it interesting and fun."
8755762,58017735,2015-12-31,15690396,Lauretta,"Our ferry from Victoria was delayed three hours so we arrived quite late.  Rah sent us the code and made the key available so we could slip in and slide right into bed! And the neighborhood - Stumptown coffee was just around the corner along with shops and restaurants just as the ad said, so nice!  The space is certainly different and perhaps not my style however I know good interior design when I see it and this space has it going on!"
8755762,58321749,2016-01-02,4895012,Crystal,"Great host!! The place is very cute and vintage, it's in the perfect area too. I will be staying again if the place is available"
555182,8521658,2013-11-04,8730295,Ramon,"Deb was timely, helpful, and easy to communicate with. Her house was clean and accessible. I would recommend staying here to anyone. "
555182,9134751,2013-12-09,4634262,Chad,"Deb's space was absolutely perfect for our purposes, and quite roomy.  The amount of sleeping space was impressive and diverse and felt very cozy.  The availability of immediate street parking was great, and the location was near enough to lots of districts in Seattle proper.  Definite choice for families or a gang of couples vacationing."
555182,13844536,2014-06-06,6354951,Srul,"Me and my family (5 members) stayed on Deb's place for a few nights, and it was great. The place is peaceful and relaxed.

Not in downtown (as we knew before), but you need to have a car anyway to get around the city - and supermarket, parking etc are close by.

Deb was informative and available, of course. Recommended for sure.
"
555182,13969970,2014-06-09,15239088,Jean Paul,Deb is really accommodating. The house is warm and has a homey feel in it. The set up was fantastic.
555182,14465666,2014-06-20,12588162,Jesse,"Deb's house is great! Kitchen, refrigerator, bathrooms, living room, bedrooms were all well groomed. It was a little chilly at night but, she left heated blankets for us! Very clear space once checked-in. Artsy touch was not an obstacle. As ""First-time Airbnb-ers"" it was totally perfect.
Thanks Deb!"
555182,15266862,2014-07-06,15688348,Sharon,"We had a great experience staying at the ""Artistic House"".  Deb was a courteous hostess but did not intrude.  She had no problem with our late arrival time, and went out of her way to get a French press for us (her old one had vanished at some point. )  The neighborhood - Wedgewood, in NE Seattle - is lovely, filled with charming bungalow homes, many with interesting gardens and landscaping.  Also the house is within walking distance of a grocery store which was very handy.
Note however that this is not like getting a vacation rental house where everything is brand new and set up just for you.   This is like staying at a friend's house while they are not there.  So their ""stuff"" is still there - in the closets,the fridge, etc.  And this is an older home, not a brand new ""McMansion"" - it has small rooms, a small, minimal kitchen, and a very small washer-dryer unit.  There is no air-conditioning - the norm for older Seattle homes.   (It cooled off beautifully every July evening we were there, down in the 50's, so with (screened) windows open it was just lovely.)
This was exactly what we expected from the listing, and none of this was a problem for us.  In fact, it was an excellent value for the price.  But if you are looking for a luxury vacation rental home, need lots and lots of closet space., and/or just can't survive without A/C.. this home is not likely to work well for you."
555182,15676370,2014-07-14,7808227,Carol,"Very old house, photos made it look a lot nicer. host not very personable. Would not recommend. "
555182,17093263,2014-08-07,15110825,Mark,"Our family of five stayed here for 2 nights and Deb made sure we had everything we needed and was very helpful and friendly.

The house has lots of character and charm . As another review said it is just like staying in a friends house. If you like a good value house, in a good neighbourhood, handy for Safeway which has everything you need in a homely and quirky way then it is a great place to stay."
555182,17434239,2014-08-12,15181145,Penny,"My son and daughter-in-law and their 4 children aged 1-10 stayed here for a 4 day weekend. I inspected the place shortly after they arrived. The house is located on a quiet pretty street that is walking distance to excellent shopping.  I found the bedrooms large and well appointed with nice sheets and plenty of blankets for the cold Seattle evenings.  There is one small bathroom but I didn't hear any complaints.  This house was good for our family for two reasons: It is on the ground floor with no steps.  Our one grandson uses a wheelchair and I would highly recommend this house for anyone using a wheelchair.  Also it is located  near the Jewish community so the synagogues are within walking distance.  My daughter in law also invited her brother for 2 days and the house accommodated everyone. We made use of the frig, freezer and tea pot. The living room, kitchen and bathroom of the house have many old-timey features, so if you like that you'll really love this house! Our family used the front yard and the back patio every day-where there was lots of seating and a picnic table.  We were lucky to come on a hot sunny weekend. My son also found some nice parks for the kids nearby and there is a large Safeway two blocks away.  The house had pretty landscaping and garden.  The one thing that didn't match my son's family was the small eating area. But there is a table that seats three and a counter that seats 2 more but they worked it out. Deb had lots of chairs for us and I thank her for that."
555182,19248752,2014-09-08,14340374,Ryan,"Deb met us upon arrival and gave us the tour - I loved the decor; marks of world travels. Located in a nice neighborhood, it was a great location for our business trip - Thank you!"
555182,23277866,2014-11-27,23662838,Bao,Deb was very easy and pleasant to work with.  The house is definitely one of a kind in Seattle with many interesting objects to enjoy.  Great overall experience!
555182,40933893,2015-08-03,5377699,Susie,"Deb's home is cute, cozy, and comfortable. She left us fresh blueberries from her sister's farm on the first day! The neighborhood is quiet and safe. Perfect for our young/artsy group!"
555182,41467608,2015-08-07,14543352,Jeff,"our whole family of 6 stayed at Deb's artistic home for 1 night .we met with Deb and she showed everything that we needed to know about her space and was friendly.The space was very clean and enjoyable for all of (website hidden) is interesting to look at all that is part of the house ...very whimsical! It worked well for our family to stay there , it is very quiet neighborhood and close to Safeway for any grocery needs. "
9617068,56954144,2015-12-20,37726364,Sarah Jean,"Seamless experience with precise communication. Great stay in a trendy apartment in an awesome walk to almost everything location! 
"
5470943,33092202,2015-05-25,29825177,Patrick,"Matthew was a great host. He welcomed us fully when my group and I got into town. He answered lots of questions about things to do in the area, and was very willing to get to know us. The neighborhood is delightful, and the apartment is very clean as well as fully furnished. I really couldn't have asked for more. "
5470943,34014231,2015-06-03,33238598,Shawn N KrisCina,"We just got back from our vacation in Seattle. Our experience was beyond anything we expected. A big part of that is the experience staying in Matthews place. The place was as described and better. The place was very clean and most of all cozy. The place for me, my husband and 2 big for all player size boys. The place had character. Matthew really had an eye for detail. His design and decor made the place feel hip, fun and yet very comfortable. 
He left us bagels and cream cheese,a bottle of wine, chips, coffee and creamer and fruit! He had all household items we needed to get by for 3 days. Here were fresh flowers throughout the house that was such a nice thing to wake up to.
The netflix and wifi made it perfect for the kiddos.
The place smelled good and the beds were comfy.
Matthew was very easy to deal with. 
Great communication and friendly. We drove in late and he stayed up and let us in and greeted us. He gave us privacy the whole time we were there.
I recommend to anyone to stay in here.
Staying here really made the trip perfect. It was so worth the rate. It was a great deal and I can't say enough positive things about this experience. "
5470943,34642162,2015-06-10,7988306,Elizabeth,"My niece and I stayed in Matthew's two bedroom apartment in Capital Hill for a week in June. The location is perfect, and the apartment is a jewel. The space is beautifully, thoughtfully and whimsically decorated, and every amenity--from fresh, local coffee to fluffy towels and luxurious bedding--is available.
Matthew is an incredible host. He greeted us on our arrival and gave us a full tour of the apartment. He was always available, by text or in person, to answer any questions we had or to offer excellent restaurant recommendations.
We thoroughly enjoyed staying at Matthew's home and would definitely stay there again on our next visit to Seattle.
"
5470943,34721185,2015-06-11,31311598,Jeffrey,"Upon entering this space one can see the timeless effort spent turning this into a place you want to be!  Since I didn't have the space to house my family and this was just a few steps away, I placed them them here.  They could not have been happier.  CLEAN and beautiful!  Matthew greeted us upon arrival and is a true gem.  This is a lovely space I'll use in the future!  I can't think of any negative comments!!!"
5470943,35455207,2015-06-19,29952223,Mark,"This was our first experience with Airbnb, and we were pleasantly surprised.  The apartment  exceeded our expectations. Matthew had just finished building the suite. Very nicely done! Matthew thought of all the comforts and then some: tastefully and whimsically decorated throughout, fresh flowers, fully supplied bathroom (with luxurious towels), fully equipped kitchen with full-size appliances (He provided us with StumpTown Coffee, gourmet popcorn and cookies, and a bowl of the largest red apples ever, condiments in refrigerator, sparkling water), Seattle maps/books, Netflix access on a large screen tv. There was a separate laundry room with detergent provided. There were abundant walk-in closets and dressers in the comfortable and quiet bedrooms.  We slept very well! The property is nicely landscaped and is situated in a quiet neighborhood with abundant on-street parking (a huge plus in Seattle).  Matthew provided us with a list of nearby grocery stores, since we like the idea of making breakfasts and an occasional dinner between sightseeing.  He also asked if we needed any camping or picnicking supplies.  The house is within easy walking distance to scenic Volunteer Park,  cafes, and restaurants on 15th St. It was ideally situated for us to explore Capitol Hill, downtown Seattle, UW campus,  Tacoma, national parks, and Leavenworth wine country.  We definitely would stay here again. Thank you, Matthew for helping to make this vacation restful!"
5470943,35782977,2015-06-22,23631640,Robert,"Matthew waited for us to wend our way from the airport, following a late arrival. He was very welcoming, had fresh flowers, fruit and coffee waiting. The apartment was delightful, and we lived staying there."
5470943,37062074,2015-07-04,34037610,Patricia,"Matthew waited up for us despite a very late arrival, and our apartment was complete with coffee, wine, and a few goodies. This was our first experience with Airbnb and it won't be our last. The house is lovely, in a great neighborhood, and provided plenty of space for 3 of us.  It was nice being able to do laundry since we were there for over a week.
The location is excellent, with street parking available and within close proximity to bus stops."
5470943,37456926,2015-07-07,127439,Victoria,"Wow! We loved the space and the proximity to all the things we wanted to do in Seattle. Navigating to the home and getting into our apartment was smooth as silk. Everything was so fresh, clean, and well thought out it immediately put me at ease. We will definitely stay again on our next trip to Seattle, if Matthew will have us. :)"
5470943,37690530,2015-07-09,36237604,Ross,Matthew's home is beautiful!  It is also very comfortable and perfectly located. Everything we needed for a relaxing vacation in Seattle was at our fingertips. We will be back.  
5470943,38262558,2015-07-14,2081540,Anne,"A gem of an apartment in a perfect location!  Matthew was a great host and the charming 2 bedroom basement apartment in his traditional craftsman home was comfortable, spacious, clean, and thoughtfully designed.  It was perfect for our family of 4 and very conveniently located near Volunteer Park, a myriad of restaurants and 2 bus lines.  We're looking forward to staying here again when we're next in Seattle."
5470943,39278700,2015-07-22,4318308,Evelyn,"The apartment is very tastefully finished and in a fab neighborhood and worked out well for four people. Matthew was a great host, very helpful and a very good resource for advice on restaurants and places to go to."
5470943,39532962,2015-07-24,30237644,Michael,"Matthew was a great host, staying up late to show us in after a slightly delayed arrival at SEA. The space is amazing as is the neighborhood!  Matthew was very accommodating and respectful of our privacy. Would definitely recommend this property and will stay again the next time I'm in Seattle!"
5470943,40096129,2015-07-28,752613,Monica,"Communicating with Matthew was easy.  He met us upon arrival, graciously allowing us to arrive several hours before official the official check--in time. 
The space is a ground-floor apt in Matthew's large home (private entrance) in the lovely Capitol Hill district. The apt is beautiful: tastefully furnished and immaculately kept.  Lots of important details made it even better, from the great bath products and thirsty towels to the sleek kitchen.  Matthew had also generously stocked the kitchen with some milk, beer, coffee and other essentials.
The neighborhood is beautiful and tranquil, an easy bus or Uber ride downtown.  we also liked the local shops just a short walk away.  All in all, this has been one of our best AirBnB experiences and we recommend Matthew and his apt. without reservation!"
5470943,40617880,2015-08-01,2921692,Anna,"Matthew is a great host, and we were incredibly happy with our choice. His home is very cozy and well decorated - imagine a lovely west elm look and feel. Even the gardening is beautiful. The beds are also extremely comfortable. 

The location is wonderful - 15min from downtown but in a residential neighborhood minutes to volunteer park. Since we have a baby, it was nice to be across from a school playground and just blocks from beautiful volunteer park. The restaurants in Capitol Hill are also great, but mostly about a 20-30min walk. We have stayed in downtown Seattle before and prefer the quieter, less touristy Capitol Hill area.

Matthew is an excellent communicator and replies very quickly. He also left strawberries in the fridge, as well as chips and salsa - very thoughtful. He is rigid about composting which is great. He is always available but also out of guests' way. 

Overall, fantastic experience if you are looking for a local's way to explore Seattle. 

Note the rooms are via the side door in the bottom of the house, and not the main house. 
"
5470943,41324643,2015-08-07,22733761,Rebekah,"Great space in a lovely area-- right by the park and near restaurants and cafes. 
Convention Center is about 45 minutes walk. Loved walking and exploring the city from the apartment. Comfy beds, huge bathroom, all the amenities you'd need. A bit noisy (a basement apt!) So bring ear plugs if you're a light sleeper."
5470943,41935674,2015-08-10,28887484,Sharlyn,"Our stay at Matthew's house couldn't have been better. He was flexible on the meeting time and was there waiting for us when we arrived. The accommodations were up to date, comfortable and well-equipped. The neighborhood was beautiful and we enjoyed going for walks to the downtown area and the park. would stay again and recommend it to others. Thank you, Matthew"
5470943,42546647,2015-08-14,20865495,Ian,Beautifully remodeled and great for kids!
5470943,44300654,2015-08-25,2667055,Angela,"We loved staying with Matthew!  He is a very hospitable host, accommodating in the extreme.  When we walked in the apartment, it simultaneously felt like home and made us think of new design ideas for our home.  The apartment had everything we needed. Our family of three was very comfortable in the two bedrooms.  The residential neighborhood is quiet and beautiful with lots of trees and two parks within a few blocks for walking and hiking.  Parking was so easy at any time of the day or night. We loved the Wandering Goose and Volunteer Park Cafe for breakfast.  Even though it was summer without air conditioning, with the windows open we were very comfortable. Extremely clean and well kept, the apartment was our perfect home base when we visited family in the area.  Fast wifi, washer & dryer were really convenient after our road trip from Virginia. Netflix was a nice touch too. We would love to stay again, this is our favorite airbnb stay ever! "
5470943,46372016,2015-09-10,1788432,Rene,"Matthew's place in Capitol Hill is a great spot to explore Seattle from.  Public transportation is easy and nice to have parking if needed.  We also walked to a lot of places: parks, restaurants, bars, and grocery all close by.  The place itself is beautiful and very well maintained.  It seems like every little detail has been thought out and the time and effort put in shows.  There were three adults and an 18 month old on this trip for two weeks and we could not have been happier.  When we had more family join for a few nights we were able to rent the room available in the upstairs portion of the house which was an unexpected perk.

Matthew was as good a host as I have come across on Airbnb.  Easy to get in touch with, available as needed, and beyond welcoming.  I can't say enough positive things about the house or the host.  Would highly recommend to those visiting the area."
5470943,47061608,2015-09-15,25455601,Scott,I had a great stay at Mathew's place in capital hill.  Great location and great space.  I hope to visit again. 
5470943,47429288,2015-09-18,2655113,Travis,"Matt was very friendly, flexible, and accommodating. The place was very inviting, and felt like a home away from home. I would stay with Matt again during my travels to Seattle."
5470943,48710309,2015-09-28,30181076,Mi,"Loved, loved, loved everything about the house.  Couldn't have asked for any more."
5470943,49365985,2015-10-03,2220382,Sarah,"Matthew's place is the ideal Seattle hideaway, I would recommend it to anyone."
5470943,52869805,2015-11-02,20312510,Joshua,"Matt's home was a really comfortable. Great for my work trip that found me having to stay Ina few nights to work. Super close to a ton of amenities, and an easy drive to even more. Matt's super responsive, and was quick to answer any question or concern I had. Overall, I'd stay again in a heartbeat."
5470943,54013594,2015-11-15,2475596,Nicole,This is by far my favorite place. Matthew keeps his home clean and it's very welcoming. The heated floors made my stay so much more comfortable. 
5470943,54330588,2015-11-18,7366529,Cheryl,"My daughter and I stayed at Matthew's place for three nights. Matthew is a wonderful host...he responded quickly to my messages and was flexible about our arrival time. 

The recently renovated unit is impeccably clean and very tastefully decorated. The bedrooms are comfortable and the heated floors were appreciated during a cold winter storm. The bathroom is large and well appointed with fluffy towels and bath products. It was nice to have a full kitchen and Matthew kindly left coffee, a bottle of wine, and several snacks for our enjoyment. 

The neighborhood is charming, with restored homes, many trees, and parks nearby. Just lovely!

My only suggestion is to invest in cable for the TV...Netflix is great, but if you want to watch a cable or network program, you will have to rely on your mobile device. 

I highly recommend Matthew's lovely basement apartment for your stay in Seattle!"
5470943,54642567,2015-11-22,2475596,Nicole,"Matthew's home continues to knock it out of the park. Honestly, if you have a chance make sure to book this place!"
5470943,55104879,2015-11-28,44311138,Peggy,"Our host Matthew was away but had his friend Christopher meet us at the apartment. Christopher was very nice, helped us with our bags and promptly answered any questions. The place was very clean, charmingly decorated (as depicted in the listing), nicely heated and quite comfortable.  Travel magazines, some little snacks and coffee were also thoughtful touches.  The location was perfect, in a lovely residential neighborhood near two parks and many cafes, grocery stores, etc...our small children appreciated all the open spaces and playgrounds nearby. "
5470943,55719244,2015-12-05,21065564,Jennifer,"Matthew's place was extremely clean, cozy, and well decorated. This attention to detail is something else! Not only was his place impeccable, he was great about keeping in touch and making sure our stay was comfortable. Because we couldn't meet on the day we arrived, Matthew took the time to greet us another night even though it was late, and he spent time chatting with us about our time in Seattle. I would absolutely recommend his place to anyone interested, and would love to stay there again if we find ourselves in Seattle! Thank you, Matthew!"
5470943,56681397,2015-12-16,7698413,Lane,"This is a lovely place! The location was perfect, gorgeous neighborhood, central to many sights. All the furnishings are quality and the design is cozy and luxe. It was spotless and well outfitted, we would definitely stay here again!"
5470943,57330930,2015-12-24,49715277,Rui,Matthew is really really nice and helpful during and before our trip in Seattle. He gave many suggestions upon food and also sightseeing.
7151417,40291219,2015-07-29,22915807,Meredith,"We had a great visit to Seattle. The house was great!  Emily left great instructions and the whole place was exactly as pictured and described. She kindly left recommendations and nice extras like games, washing soap and even a frisbee.  We would absolutely book again and highly recommend it. "
7151417,40989579,2015-08-03,31601803,Allegra,Had a great stay in Seattle at Emily's! The house was comfortable and central to everything in Seattle. Emily was incredibly accommodating with any of our requests and had some great restaurant recommendations for the area. Definitely a great place to stay with family and friends.
7151417,41268334,2015-08-05,12515131,Roopal,"Emily's home was a perfect getaway while we spent a few days in Seattle. It's designed well for families with young children. 
The best part is it has 3 bedrooms and 2.5 bath and is only 20 minutes to downtown. The kitchen is equipped with pots and pans and the entire house has abundant day light (on a sunny day in Seattle). 

Emily communicated very well through the booking process and accommodated us as we traveled in and out of Seattle on red-eye flights.

The neighborhood is very quiet, at a dead end with grocery stores and other essentials at a short drive. I will definitely recommend a stay at this residence. "
7151417,43168155,2015-08-17,40237923,Tina,Clean and loved the space.  Very quiet as the home is in a residential neighborhood.  Close to downtown Seattle.  The bus stop is within a 5 minute walking distance.  But if I had to rent a car -- there is lots of street parking.  Would recommend this Airbnb to friends and family.
7151417,44173919,2015-08-24,23656005,Carla,"Great neighborhood, clean and efficient. Foot traffic from kids running around upstairs was a little noisy in the morning. 3rd bedroom has tiny children's beds, as you can see in the picture. Not really suitable to fit adults in that bedroom. Would be nice to have a set of keys for each bedroom."
7151417,45390008,2015-09-02,39121522,Jacqueline,"The neighborhood was absolutely wonderful. It felt safe, and it was quiet. There were many surrounding shops, food venues, and bus stops. "
7151417,46890399,2015-09-14,37082091,Mary,"She did not make us feel welcome.
I was surprised by the poor condition of the apartment.
The blinds in the kitchen were terrible, a complete shambles and the dining room blinds were in tatters and we had to prop up the slats against the windowpane.
We could hear people walking above us late at night and early in the morning so sleeping well was impossible. Even the flushing of the toilet upstairs disturbed us. The place is just not soundproof.

Not one single bedside light or lamp in the house! Unbelievable!
It was like living in an office as she only had flourescent ceiling lights.

It was pretty hot and there were no standing fans or ceiling fans at all! We knew that there was no AC, but not a single fan!

Emily did tell us to go and buy one and then she would reimburse us!!  
I definetly expected better for the price.
  
Also, I left some clothes in the dryer and she asked me what I wanted to do with them. I contacted her numerous times prior to leaving Seattle and asked her to tell me what garments I left and I am still waiting to hear!  Overall not a good host and the apartment pretty cheesy.   But I guess you can get away with that in Seattle. The redeeming feature was the location."
7151417,48119577,2015-09-23,23042680,Rongdi,"Clean and spacious place, absolutely perfect for family trip!"
7151417,48625023,2015-09-27,44533186,Erik,"Our stay was great. It's a beautiful location with some great breweries, restaurants and coffee shops within walking distance.  We had all the amenities we needed and had no problems."
7151417,56909471,2015-12-20,15493977,Kristen,"I stayed with Emily for almost 3 months. It was the perfect location, just up the street from the main part of Freemont. Although I did much of my commuting via bike, there was the 5 bus- a 5 minute walk down a staircase. Emily was very kind, easy going and extremely easy to contact throughout the stay. Easy street parking (no permit required) as well as a private entrance made her place even more alluring. Everything was as described, clean and had all kitchen appliances you would need to make a meal. Wonderful stay, wish I didn't leave Seattle! "

935862,10317101,2014-02-12,11517303,Robert,"This is a privately owned condo, professionally managed by Jordan's firm. We were in for a convention and loved the location, as it is within walking distance (or a $6 cab ride) to the Seattle convention center. We arrived late on a Sunday. The check-in was simple and fast. Just show your ID to the concierge and receive an envelope with keys and a parking garage access card.

We found a plumbing problem in a bathroom sink and called it in. It was too late for maintenance and not an emergency. So, Jordan's firm moved us to a new unit 10 minutes later. Problems can occur anywhere, anytime. What is important is how they are resolved. No complaints at all. The new unit was identical to the first, with a great view.

These two bedroom units have two bedrooms and a queen size sleeper sofa in each. There is a coffee pot and a basic kitchen equipped with the basic appliances. Bring your own coffee.

The concierge service in the lobby was excellent, with good recommendations on places to eat and local knowledge. Security access was quite restricted. The building felt very safe.

We would definitely stay here again."
935862,19975969,2014-09-21,19526883,Sean,"Jordan made us feel very welcomed when we arrived. The apartment was clean and had everything we needed for the weekend. Although Jordan was not there to give us access to the apartment, he made it very easy for us. He sent us instructions 1 week before we were to arrive and made sure we had his contact information incase something was wrong, and he always replied quickly to all our questions. The location is prime for any visit to downtown Seattle, with everything within a 5 - 10 minute walk. Our group consisted of 4 guys and this apartment slept all of us quite comfortably, and made sure we got a good nights rest.  I would fully recommend coming and staying with Jordan to anyone. There are no complaints on our end, with the amazing views from the balcony to the spacious apartment, and the downtown atmosphere, I will be back for sure. "
935862,24889735,2015-01-03,279315,Valentina & Jeremy,The place is great with a amazing view. Vero convenient with everything you could need around.  Very easy check in and checkout. 
935862,43571134,2015-08-20,12904945,Tommy,We had a nice work trip to Seattle and Jordan was super helpful with great service. The condo was nice and clean and in a great location. Thumbs up!
935862,49788779,2015-10-06,23054920,Brett,"The listing was absolutely ""as advertised.""  I was there on a business marketing / vacation trip.  Our location was perfect in the heart of the Downtown area.  We were walking distance of most everything we wanted.  A (phone number hidden) Uber will get you anywhere you want to go outside of walking distance.  The view was incredible looking directly at the ferris wheel and sunsets.  All amenities you want are located within the building or less than a block away.  I will recommend this listing and StayAlfred to anyone!"
935862,51025744,2015-10-17,40431526,Eva Marie Kelley,Fabulous location! Loved the views and the space as well. Would stay here again
