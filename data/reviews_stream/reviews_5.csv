Cons: It definitely feels and smells like a basement and lack of stand-up shower is inconvenient. The host emailed me the morning I left and asked me to put clean sheets on the bed which would have felt ok if the place were priced much lower."
1100714,13046956,2014-05-18,14943796,Donna,Everything went very smoothly and room was as advertised.  Bed was very comfortable and rate was fair. 
1100714,13087086,2014-05-19,14085774,Christina,"1st of all the host was very nice and the area was wonderful. But the pictures make the place look a lot more finished then it was. The 1st 2 rooms really are just unfinished basement. The tubs next to the washer dryer and boiler. The the hot water ran out for me. The 3rd room really is very nice, cozy and more finished. The bed was very comfortable. "
1100714,13155403,2014-05-20,14943796,Donna,Property was as advertised . 
1100714,13343019,2014-05-26,12590046,Shrinidhi,"A nice cosy room in a nice,quiet neighbourhood - yet in the thick of things. All of Seattle's main attractions were either a walk or a bus away. We did not have to rent a car at all  during our 4 day trip due to the fabulous location. Erika was prompt and responsive to all of our needs - like an extra room heater and a water kettle (we were travelling with our 4 year old). I guess she is just starting out on Airbnb so she has some small nice-to-have details to sort out like a microwave and a fridge in the room. However, she did let us use her fridge in her kitchen upstairs and also gave us a kettle to heat milk in since her microwave wasn't working. The only downside I want to mention is the noise from upstairs that you hear, especially in the mornings when her kids are running around. Since the room is part of the basement, anyone sleeping there can hear all the activity that happens above - loud and clear. And if you are a late riser, it's definitely a little annoying. This has been my first Airbnb experience and has otherwise, definitely been good. "
1100714,13548477,2014-05-30,15543104,Sarah,"Cute little place to stay in a great location. It was great to have the driveway available to park in and there is plenty to do within walking distance. Would stay here again, for sure."
1100714,13918503,2014-06-08,14409723,SmilingHara,"It was perfect!!  I loved the bathtub feature and Erika had lavender Epsom salts there for us to use to make it extra special.  Also the bed was extremely comfortable, I slept like a baby!  "
1100714,14241460,2014-06-15,2402648,Nicole,"Overall a great place. Location is fantastic, private entrance was great, apartment was cozy. The only downside was the lack of a stand-up shower and that the hot water ran out really quickly. "
1100714,14293672,2014-06-16,10061794,Mark,"Location, location, location!  Good price and a separate entrance.  The actual bedroom in the back is huge - but know that when you walk in there is a bed, and that's not the actual room itself.  A tad confusing - I know it sounds simple, but a sign to the bedroom would be nice. 
Erika provided some really nice details - from shampoos and soaps to earplugs and reading items.  I slept like a baby on the bed. Truly - best night sleep I had for a week of traveling. 
The only warnings - 1) the stairs to the sub-apartment are quite steep and 2) this is a basement, so those of us who are over 6 feet will have to be mindful of overhead equipment for a short section as you make your way to the very large bedroom."
1100714,14517927,2014-06-21,7162609,Melanie,"Great location in Capitol Hill, close to public transportation that will take you to all of Seattle's main attractions. The room is in the basement but is comfortable. There are two separate bedrooms so it is quite spacious. My only complaint is the bathtub situation. There is only a hand shower and because the bathtub is raised, you are unable to stand to bathe, so I had to bathe myself squatting...Other than that this is a great place for the cost"
1100714,14629083,2014-06-23,15911903,Lukas,"Apartment was as advertised. Excellent location to be at Space needle in 10 min (bus).
Apartment was clean and the bed was comfortable.
I met Erika just once, because I was in town most of the time but she seemed to be a very nice and helpful host.
I would stay there again."
1100714,14880221,2014-06-28,15859473,Usama,"Very good location and very good price for Seattle. The room was cozy and quite large and the bed was super comfortable. Notice that there are two rooms in the unit, you have to go past the bathtub area to get to the ""proper"" one (the big one).
It also had several goodies that were nice to have (shampoo, toothpaste, coffee, tea, etc).
The bathtub was probably the least comfortable part given that a 5'11'' person cannot stand on it (you'd probably need to be shorter than 5'4'' to stand on it), but the bathtub is large enough for a large person to lay in there and get a nice bath.

Location was excellent, Capitol Hill, just 20mins walking to downtown, plenty of bars and restaurants in the area (but the house is not next to one, so you'll be fine with no noise)."
1100714,15048701,2014-07-01,8592861,John,"What a great location, only 20 minutes walk from the conference area but away from the hub-bub of the downtown. 

The apartment was as shown, the ceiling heights are a little low. So if you are tall you may want to give it some thought but was perfect hobbit hole for my diminutive 5'6"" stature. And the bed was very comfy!

Erica was great, really responsive, communicative and generous with amenities. 

"
1100714,15571617,2014-07-12,2073736,Carolyn,"Well, I didn't really feel welcome because I never met my hostess. Also, I sent her a text when my plane landed hours before check in to ask if I could leave my luggage at her place before checking in and she did not respond to my text. It's tough to lug your luggage around for hours. This is a partially finished basement apartment with a basement smell. The location is good, though the taxi had a hard time finding the house coming and going. FYI, take the train from the airport to downtown and get a taxi from the train stop. The powder bathroom was pleasant and there is nice art in the bedroom. The picture you see is the nicest view in the basement apartment and the window is driveway level. Also, I could hear the upstairs noise."
1100714,15760460,2014-07-15,4018691,Sarah,"We enjoyed staying at Erika's place in Seattle. The house is well located: near Cal Anderson parks and lots of restaurants, but still on a relatively quiet street (there was some noise from the neighbors and passers-by during the night). Because it was a weekend, Erika allowed us to park our car in her driveway, which was very convenient.

The apartment itself is in the basement, which means that the ceilings are a little low and the air is a little stuffy. But the space itself is quiet large and the bed is very comfortable. Erika supplied a variety of toiletries as well as tea and glasses, etc. which made it easy to eat breakfast there.

It takes about 30-40 minutes to walk to tourist spots downtown like Pike Place Market, which was fine for us. We enjoyed our stay!"
1100714,15842323,2014-07-16,7582331,Bethany,"This please is lovely! However, as other reviewers have said, the ceiling is short, and there is no standing shower. The bathtub is glorious. Definitely my favorite part. But if you are over six feet you might get annoyed with the height accommodations. Nice and cool in the basement. Great bed! Clean sheets and towels. We were on a road trip and she was very accommodating with our parking needs :) GREAT STAY!!!"
1100714,15938955,2014-07-18,812139,Stefan,"Erika is a nice, welcoming host, but the space has a bit awkward layout and furniture is old and well... smells of old. Beddings were certainly clean but they cover a cheap old mattress and pillows that are not comfortable. The bathtub is raised on a platform which combined with the already low ceiling of the basement makes it very uncomfortable to use (it's easier to shower in a campground). Otherwise, yes, it's roof over one's head but for $100/night I would expect to feel more comfortable. Reminded me of a college dorm experience."
1100714,16200061,2014-07-23,14340964,Kenneth,The place was very nice and was exactly what we needed while in Seattle. We had a great time staying there and it was great to come to after a long day out and about. Like others have said the ceilings are a little low but not unmanageable. All in all it was a great experience and I would recommend it to others.
1100714,16313391,2014-07-25,4581823,Sarah,Great little space and separate entrance. Very private and respectful. And an amazing location! 
1100714,16474980,2014-07-28,2604008,Lindsay,"We had a good stay in Erika's apartment, it's in a fantastic location and we were able to walk everywhere- nearby restaurants bars and downtown. It certainly is a basement apartment though, while spacious it is dark and a bit stuffy.  Great place to stay if you're planning on being out most of the day! "
1100714,16765705,2014-08-02,14062296,Jimmy,"Erika's place is at a great location, a short bus trip away from most tourist spots and great bars in Bell Town. She's very friendly and responsive with msg. Prior to our trip, she made sure we have all the info we need for the stay."
1100714,16894766,2014-08-04,15823984,Judith,The location and price can't be beat. Walking distance to all the restaurants and shops of Capitol Hill. Bed was very comfortable.  
1100714,16997638,2014-08-05,6723778,Micaiah,The place was very clean and nice to stay at. I wish we had been there a little longer so I could have taken advantage of the awesome tub! The apartment was close to so many cool bars and restaurants! We were only a short drive over to Pike's Market and the Space Needle. 
1100714,17233404,2014-08-09,12441027,Elizabeth,Ok
1100714,17261848,2014-08-10,12441027,Elizabeth,Erica made us feel welcome. Te place is clean and quiet and good value for two people or two couples who want separate bedrooms. Ceiling is a bit low for those over 5 foot 11 inches.
1100714,18313216,2014-08-25,17080247,Nicolas,"Erika's basement flat is a quirky place, quite large although with few windows and with relatively low ceilings. We particularly enjoyed the free standing bathtub. Location is great, you can easily reach downtown in 20min and the neighbourhood is up and coming."
1100714,18541513,2014-08-28,5416111,Emily,Erika was a fantastic host! The apartment was much bigger than expected and very cozy. The location was perfect and easy to walk to some of the best bars and restaurants in the area. The only drawback was the occasional noise of foot traffic from the main house but she kindly provided earplugs. We would definitely stay again!
1100714,19078223,2014-09-06,3968506,Emmanuel,"My wife and I spent two nights at Erika's apartment and overall it was a good experience. 
The area is nice, quiet and close to great restaurants and touristy spots. The apartment was rather clean, well located and we were able to park our car in the driveway during the length of our stay. It's always nice not to worry about parking space while traveling. 

On the downside, we regret not getting to meet our hostess. It almost felt like spending a few nights in a random motel which isn't what we expected from an Airbnb host. The room is in a basement which is not very well lit and get fairly cold at night. Also we could hear noises from upstairs which can be unpleasant at 8am on a Saturday."
1100714,19551540,2014-09-14,20630131,John,"We got lost on the way to Erika's place and tried to contact the host several times by cell to no avail.  I also messaged her before my wife and I drove down to Seattle with no response, so I didn't really feel welcome or that my business was appreciated.  When we arrived we could not park with the host as advertised, again no answer on her cell phone.  I had to park up the street in a pay parking lot, so a little inconvient.  However, when we retuned from the Mariners game, she had moved her car to make room, so that was nice. 

The place is what you what you expect when you are paying $120.  Yes, the cieling is barely six-feet if that, but very manageable.   However, the location is great, a really neat part of Seattle, reminds of the Main Street area in Vancouver, BC, very funky and lively neighbourhood.

The place was not as clean as I would expect it to be when you are renting it out to guests.  There was a used bar of soap to use when bathing, kinda gross(she did provide bottled bath gel, but still put out a new bar of soap).  There was half a roll of toilet paper with no other rolls provided(we had to use paper towels).  Finally, when we stripped the beds and pillow cases, I was a little shocked-the mattress and pillows were sweat soaked and brown in colour(they were white long, long ago) with several very dark blotches that looked like blood stains-maybe time to buy new mattress and pillows)

Overall, I would rate it as average at best, no expectations were exceeded here.  I gather others have experienced better from reading the reviews, however, when my calls and messages went unanswered as well as having to pay for parking when I sent her a message explicitly detailing that yes, I would be driving and would need a parking space, let's just say I didn't exactly have my hopes up for a great experience. 

if you are hard on for a place to sleep tand that's it, his is your place.  I don't think that I will be returning"
1100714,19736518,2014-09-17,15146242,Belinda,Nous n'avons pas eu l'hôte au téléphone ni ne l'avons vu pendant notre nuit à seattle. L'endroit est très grand
1100714,19787312,2014-09-18,218389,Hudson,"I wish I could have stayed longer! Erika's basement is comfortable and full of books, art, and character. The whole process is very user-friendly, with clear instructions on how to get in and out, where to find amenities and wifi, etc. The place is definitely unique in layout, with a sumptuous bathtub in the laundry room!, but for me that was a feature, not a bug. (If you arrive after dark, you may have to hunt for light switches.) This was my first-ever night in Seattle, and I can't imagine a better way to experience the Capitol Hill neighborhood for the first time: a quick walk through the park brought me to the bars and restaurants and music venues and vinyl shops. All told, highly recommended."
1100714,20014286,2014-09-22,16133170,Laure,"Very good location and very practical (particularly with a car), and a complete autonomy has Erika all the needed information ready in advance. Not good to spend time in the daytime though, as it is dark (it is a basement) but that did not bother us as we were out all day visiting Seattle."
1100714,21572248,2014-10-19,15097585,Kevin,"Very cool place, we'll stay again"
1100714,21908214,2014-10-26,22331475,Bluesette,Fantastic place to stay right in the heart of Capital Hill.  My favorite things were the super comfy bed and the claw foot tub.
1100714,22223419,2014-11-01,4710782,Thomas,Great place if you want autonomy and privacy. Your own entrance. Would be good for small families. Lots of cool books and toys.
1100714,22585302,2014-11-10,8116388,Robin,"This is an excellent location, near a park, Farmer's Market, lots of restaurants, good book store. Easy to walk to places even at night. The apartment is quiet, the bed was very comfortable. After a long day of hiking, it was especially nice. Room for you to hang your clothes, put your bags away and sit at table with tea. "
1100714,22785266,2014-11-14,7941646,Steve,"Erika welcomed me as I was backing my car into the driveway. Though I had not shared with her that I would be driving a car she immediately invited me to park my car in the off-street parking in an  otherwise overly crowded neighborhood. In the morning we connected via text and telephone so she could get her car out of the driveway to run errands.
In this quaint basement setting there was peanut butter and food if needed. There were ample choices of soaps and shampoos available. Though it was cool outside a heater quickly warmed the cozy setting. Erika made me feel totally welcome not only the first day but whenever our paths did cross. I would definitely stay here again."
1100714,22879888,2014-11-16,23743673,Nick,The place was clean and the location was convenient. The outside access was great for being out-and-about and stopping by the residence whenever necessary.
1100714,23089556,2014-11-22,3909386,Philipp,"The room was big and tidy, loved the bath tub :)"
1100714,23232948,2014-11-25,23176162,Franz,"The place was fantastic! It is really spacious as well as the location being close to the exciting part of the city and next to a bus stop that took us straight to the middle of downtown in less than 10 minutes! Whether you are a couple or a family visiting Seattle, I couldn't recommend it more!  "
1100714,23398381,2014-11-30,9268768,Faro,"Arrived with great communication.
Erika was friendly and explained everything that we needed to know.
She even sent a text message with all the information for amenities and great spots to eat and see.
The bed was very comfortable. 

The location was great and close to Dicks burgers, (have to eat there at least once).

Place was fairly clean, some cob webs but it was in the basement suite so expected.

Parking was easy and convenient. 
WiFi connection was great too.

All in all had a great stay!"
1100714,23589208,2014-12-05,3817960,Andrey,Quite basement in good neighbourhood. The room felt very private - I haven't seen anybody during all of my 3 days stay. Great value stay.
1100714,23600004,2014-12-06,22955171,Zahir,"It's my first time using Airbnb with Erika. It so amazing Erika is a nice a person. I was so welcomed. The room is clean with a privet bathroom and privet entrance. Erica provides everything in the main room towels, radio, books, quite, tea , coffee even the shaving stuff. It's so nice.. Thanks Erika "
1100714,24628693,2014-12-31,1495479,Ellina,"Erika was very accommodating and was generous to offer us the parking spot in the driveway during our trip. Her spot is truly a GREAT location, a brisk walk to a lot of great eats and bars, Pikes Place Market, and if you're really up for it the Space Needle and EMP Museum are also walkable distances!"
1100714,24649764,2015-01-01,23314108,Rania,This house is super cute! There were two pretty comfortable beds in separate rooms which made it easy for four of us to stay here comfortably. We had a lot of privacy even though the residents upstairs were home. It was really nice to be able to park in the driveway as well. It was a homey feel with good books and artwork decorating the walls. Erika was easy to communicate with and even offered to send us the bag we accidentally left which we are super appreciative of!
1100714,25257553,2015-01-10,18841055,Emma,"Super easy. The price was ridiculous, such a steal for being on the same street as the park and so close to everything Capitol Hill offers. Erika is easy to get a hold of and the private entrance is very nice and the main bed is so comfy!"
1100714,25288635,2015-01-11,25056663,Kharen,"Erika, our host, made our stay easy with no fuss. We stayed for one night, the place offers two bedrooms and very spacious. The room is in the house basement. 

Also, the location in Capitol Hill is close to a lot of great spots. Such as 15th St and it has a lot of restaurants. "
1100714,25393159,2015-01-14,21124999,Rok,"Fairly priced and represented in photos. Great location. Easy and straightforward protocol for getting key to the place. I wish it had a stand up shower, but bathing sitting down in the tub was acceptable. 
"
1100714,25760105,2015-01-25,4274504,David,"Great spot next to the park, really comfortable and cosy place to stay, definitely on my list for Seattle places to stay!"
1100714,25821650,2015-01-26,26021498,Paige,"Erika's instructions were clear on how to get into the apartment and where it is located. The main room (pictured) is in the back space so you have to walk through the front room and bathroom to get to it. Space is a little dark since its under the house. Space was clean and organized. Only bath tub, no shower."
1100714,25950548,2015-01-30,10103404,Ann,The reservation was canceled 14 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
1100714,26058081,2015-02-02,25649796,Alasdair,"Great place with a private entrance. Everything as described. Close to restaurants, bars and a short walk or cab ride to downtown. I would recommend to anyone I know to stay here when visiting Seattle."
1100714,26188437,2015-02-06,26375453,Luke,Excellent location and a very comfortable space.  There was a lot more space than I expected.  Erika did an excellent job of coordinating when we would arrive and was a very accommodating and friendly host.  I would definitely recommend staying here.
1100714,26311918,2015-02-09,26026858,Lindsay,"Clean, quirky apartment in a great location. Four of us stayed in the basement and each found that we had more than enough room and privacy. The bathtub is a stand alone and is on a pedestal - so this might be tricky for taller folks but worked out well for us! "
1100714,26548418,2015-02-15,21580919,Keegan,"Our stay with Erika was effortless and exceeded expectations! The private entrance was a big plus, and we could come and go as we pleased. The apartment was super cute, clean, and well kept. Great location, and I would highly recommend this listing for anyone looking to stay in Cap hill."
1100714,26941372,2015-02-22,27273688,David,"I had a great experience and the listing was as described. Great location and Erika was resourceful, would recommend staying there to others."
1100714,27041593,2015-02-23,27819972,Homero,"Fast response, easy private access, make sure you tell the driver it is east 10 ave. I didn't and I was dropped off at another 110 10th ave. kind of a scary part of town. Was so confused. Good overall "
1100714,27192869,2015-02-27,22139422,Olga,"Erika was a friendly hostess. The private entrance and parking were convenient and the location ideal. It was nice to have separate sleeping areas. The space felt a little cluttered. Overall, it made for a great stay."
1100714,27241080,2015-02-28,28413501,Christian,The location was amazing.  Erika was friendly and allowed us to have a wonder overnight stay in Seattle. The place was clean and met all of our needs.
1100714,27454509,2015-03-04,23121791,Bruce,"Very convenient! Clean, simple. No hassle what so ever. Thank you for letting us use your house!"
1100714,27635705,2015-03-08,112877,Shandell,The reservation was canceled 6 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
1100714,27738464,2015-03-10,2729557,Camila,"The private entrance and parking were convenient and the location ideal. Overall, it made for a nice stay! "
1100714,27912213,2015-03-14,2886661,Christine,"Erika was very friendly and helpful! And the space was spacious enough for the two of us plus two kids. 

However it certainly felt messier and like more of a basement than we were expecting. We had to duck to walk around, and could hear the water running through the pipes all night. 

Still, the location was good. And despite us booking super last-minute, and Erika was quick to respond with directions and other useful info."
1100714,28154775,2015-03-18,15642953,Ruize (Ray),"Strongly recommend! Pretty central location, easy to get a bus to downtown Seattle. The place is nice, got all we need! Thanks Erika, she responds so quick and give us all the information we need."
1100714,28226741,2015-03-20,17959303,Wade,Cozy apartment with easy access. Exactly as described. Great for a quick stop in Seattle. 
1100714,28282989,2015-03-21,29271355,Reggie,"Erika was great! It was really easy to communicate with her before and during our stay in Seattle.  

The place was clean and was exactly as described in the listing.  The neighborhood was close to many places to eat for brunch and was easy to get around since the location was centralized and close to the downtown area.  It had everything we needed!"
1100714,28362196,2015-03-22,21534606,Jason,"We did not see the landlord during our one night stay. We were a little put off by the fact that there were quite a few toiletries all over the toilet room sink and were not sure if somebody was still staying in one of the rooms (despite our reservation for 3 people). Aside from the slight untidiness and musty smell of the basement, we did not have any major complaints.

The neighbourhood is great, right next to the large park with lots going on. A little further walk (less than 5 minutes) brings you into the heart of the restaurant/bar/club district in Capitol Hill. It's far enough away from the noise yet close enough to be convenient. Awesome location."
1100714,28576769,2015-03-26,10442823,Dylan,"The place was great. Never saw Erika, but we got in with no problem. Beds were comfortable, great location. "
1100714,28712418,2015-03-29,27288202,Travis,"Erica's place is great! She's a super-friendly host and has lots of advice about places to eat, and how to get around on foot. The location is perfect: tucked into a quiet street, but right near the bustle of Capitol Hill. The room itself is just what I was looking for: basic, but really inviting, clean, and relaxing. The bathtub shower is actually really nice to use and not inconvenient--for me anyway. I will look forward to coming back when I'm next in Seattle!"
1100714,28920109,2015-03-31,29646332,Keith,"Such a cute and quirky place - I loved it. Right next to cal Anderson park, which is also awesome. Erica's instructions were straight forward and I didn't run into any issues."
1100714,29110455,2015-04-04,26988354,Bailing,"It is a lovely and quirky basement, cozy and interesting as well.  "
1100714,29224638,2015-04-05,14141860,Melissa,"While the location was great, the actual space was a little weird.  There was a lot of partially used toiletries around and we had a hard time finding towels and the only sink is in the bathroom.  It felt more like we were staying in someone's room while they were out of town.  It was nice to be able to park in the driveway but the text during dinner asking us if we could move the car was a little annoying especially since I had texted the host before we left asking if it was ok if we left our car in the driveway and I didn't get a response.  The bed was comfy and the location was great but if I need another air bnb in Seattle I would book with another host. "
1100714,29683715,2015-04-11,21987888,Lesley,"We never actually managed to meet up, but Erika was very welcoming and kept in touch with us through the website. She gave us great directions on how to find the house and lots of tips on the neighbourhood. Capitol Hill is a GREAT neighbourhood and is so fun, lots of funky cafes, bars, restaurants and really laid back.

The house is really beautiful, and the garden is lovely. The basement suite is quite big with two sleeping areas. It was clean and tidy and the bed was really comfortable, I slept very well. There is no shower, but a great old claw foot tub with a hand held shower attachment. Towels and soaps were provided as well."
1100714,29884550,2015-04-13,30562505,Andrea,"Bed was made and bathroom was clean when I got there. super easy instructions about how to get into the space with the key in the email when you book with Erika. It was a shame I couldn't use the tub to soak in because it looked gorgeous!

Only thing was that I wasn't sure if someone who was renting out their home or if this was a space only use for airbnb-rs. (there were several toiletries in the bathroom and personal stuff like books in all the rooms. Nothing was sketchy about it it just felt like I was living in someone space.)

But you can't beat the location! It was so close to everything and there's even a parking or by that I took advantage of on a sunny day."
1100714,29960384,2015-04-14,20899212,Krista,"Really awesome place! It's in a basement so expect low ceilings (you may have to duck under pipes if you're over 5'6"").  It didn't bother me or my boyfriend one bit. The tile work is amazing and definitely gives off a Seattle vibe. Extra points for the killer bathtub. The location is central and perfect for anyone trying to explore the city. I could hear people upstairs in the morning but Erika provided earplugs on the nightstand which did the trick. I had a wonderful experience staying at Erika's place and would definitely consider staying there again the next time I make it to Seattle."
1100714,30446670,2015-04-22,16019756,Matthew,"Erika is the best Airbnb host I have had so far and I have stayed at quite a few now. She set us up with a list of things to do for food, drinks, arts and entertainment and all of her recommendations were amazing. This was thee best location I have ever stayed in when visiting a city. It was in the middle of everything in the city that we wanted to be a part of. Our 6 day stay was doable all without renting/needing our own car. Walking and biking was plenty good. The separate rooms were nice and cozy and I slept like a newborn baby each night on the comfortable bed. I would definitely look forward to booking the same spot for my next visit to Seattle."
1100714,30738332,2015-04-26,15243628,Tiffany,"Erika's place was exactly as desribed and pictured, with quite a bit of space. It was easy to find and is in a great, central location in Capitol Hill. We had a last minute emergency but Erika was  flexible with our stay, which was greatly appreciated!!!"
1100714,30833521,2015-04-27,3380909,Christopher,"Loved this place!  Funky, eclectic, comfortable and everything you want in a great location on Capitol Hill.  Walk to all the hot spots...and wake up in a really cool place.  And for you coffee addicts, French press and coffee bean grinder await you in the AM.  Hope to stay again!!"
1100714,31240150,2015-05-03,18848398,Nick,"Erika was a great host. Her place was perfect for us. The location was great! She let us go upstairs to turn the heat on which was great. There is some clutter and the bathtub was awkward sitting in it, but besides that it was a great stay."
1100714,31971142,2015-05-12,20490545,Brian,The host was understanding and helped us out a lot.  The place is clean and adventurous and for travelers it is the best house.
1100714,32043655,2015-05-12,1787,Kimberly,The host canceled this reservation the day before arrival. This is an automated posting.
1100714,32508831,2015-05-19,9450927,Ben,"Erika provided excellent instructions on how to arrive, what to expect, and she provided a very welcoming environment!"
1100714,32976579,2015-05-24,29892906,Mike,Great place to spend a weekend in Seattle. Very low key spot that is easy to find and in a safe neighborhood. Walking distance to Pike Place Market and great places on Capitol Hill. The place had enough room for 3 people. Overall a great experience. 
1100714,33411308,2015-05-27,33869396,Soraya,"While I chalked up this place as a quirky experience, my slightly less adventurous cousins were mildly horrified. The layout of the place is odd, the lack of shower and placement of the bathtub is strange to say the least, and the musty basement smell is very present. The place feels very lived in, as though we were staying in someone else's living space, and the used toiletries did not inspire confidence in the overall cleanliness. It was also fairly loud in the morning, being underfoot their living space (which wouldn't be a problem if we were morning people). 

Communication with Erica was amazing, always quick and clear. The place was a great location and so easy to find.

Overall, this was fine for our one night stay, but I would probably be deterred from staying any longer."
1100714,33509571,2015-05-29,26446421,Jenni,"Erika was very thorough with instructions and made check in/check out very easy and smooth. You are in a basement so you can hear people walking around and talking from up stairs. The private  entrance was really nice. The location was prime and was a short bus ride from downtown, next to a park and with in walking distance of good restaurants and coffee shops. Taking a shower in the bathtub was kind of awkward and there is not a lot of privacy while doing so. "
1100714,33729823,2015-05-31,8181547,Robin,"Overall we enjoyed our stay. The location can't be beat, but the low ceilings are challenging for anyone 5'8"" or taller. "
1100714,34551021,2015-06-09,3975815,Shannon,"Overall, I was disappointed in the rental and would not return. The location was great, parking was provided which was very helpful, and it was easy to access the room; however, the space is not very comfortable. It is essentially a basement that clearly still serves as a storage area. While the ""main room"" is a bit nicer, there were a number of large black flies throughout the room (killed three but about four others remained) and as such I was forced to sleep in the other room while leaving a light on in the main room to keep the flies distracted so they didn't keep me up with their buzzing all night. There are no windows and no fans so the space is a little warm during the summer and stuffy. There was also no toilet paper, just a roll of paper towels that I ended up using. I only booked for the one night, but if I had booked for longer I probably would have cancelled and stayed somewhere else. "
1100714,34635221,2015-06-10,1842989,Karen,"Very cozy and quiet space, close to the heart of Seattle and convenient to attractions most people want to see.  Enjoyed my stay and would be glad to stay here again."
1100714,34705206,2015-06-11,696662,Christian,"Very friendly host, great location. Thanks, Erika!"
1100714,35106634,2015-06-15,32373327,Jane,"I’m not even sure how to word this review without sounding mean but…it was not what we expected and would not stay again.  

1.The ceiling was so low that my husband (6’5”) and I (5’7”) both had to duck as we moved around. 
2.The bathtub is in the middle of the central room. As long as no one wants to use the bathroom or go in and out of the place you can have privacy.  
3.I felt like I was staying in a friend’s room….a really messy friend.  There was stuff everywhere. Used bottles of lotion, old phone chargers, broken jewelry and yellowing brochures litter all corners of the space. To be fair the floors and linens were clean it was just so cluttered.
4.The bed is comfy but do not look at the mattress when you take the sheets off at the end of your stay.  Keep your eyes closed when you remove the pillow cases too.
5.If you want a very hands off host you’ve got it. The automated e-mail that she sent had all of the information we needed for our stay. We never saw or heard from her nor did she answer any of my further questions beyond sending me her automated message again.
6.The biggest redeeming quality…The location is outstanding. You can easily access the whole city via public transportation and your own two feet.

If you are looking for a cheap place that is nicer than a hostel then this is the place for you. If not, you might want to keep looking.
"
1100714,35227315,2015-06-16,31867912,Kaitlyn,"Our overall stay here was mostly positive as it was a great location and Erika was a fantastic host that left very thorough instructions.  The only setback was we were not prepared for how little space we had to shower and lack of privacy (no curtain/door).  Thankfully my friends and I are very comfortable together so it wasn't a major problem, but definitely unexpected.  "
1100714,35396247,2015-06-18,26816677,Sara,"The location is great for walking to many locations in Seattle! Didn't really engage with Erika, but said hello."
1100714,35788906,2015-06-22,31162967,Jarek,We received all necessary information before arrival. We met Erika just once during our stay and we said hi to her. The place is really big and the locations of the house is very good if U wanna be nearby the downtown or the Capitol Hill.
1100714,36018521,2015-06-24,7833833,Jennifer,Perfect cheap spot to crash with accessibility to all the great things on Capitol Hill... Only down side were the kids running around early in the morning upstairs
1100714,36298532,2015-06-27,8097561,Adrian,"It's basically like staying in someone's janky basement storage area. Hope you're not tall because the ceilings are really low! 

Also, bring earplugs if you like to sleep past 8 AM, because you will likely be woken up by whatever is going on in the house upstairs -- people walking around, kid yelling, pets? Hard to tell, but the hubbub woke me up. I needed to catch an early-ish flight anyway, but still...

You won't really be able to take a shower since you can't stand up in the bathtub. The collection of random personal hygiene products is ... interesting. 

Never met the host (although I'm sure I could have gone upstairs and knocked on the door) and check-in was easy, with the private entrance. 

Don't expect much -- in fact, expect less. But the price is low compared to other Airbnbs in the area (which I stay at frequently) so I guess you get what you pay for!"
1100714,36758178,2015-07-01,26662315,Johan,"Wij boekten voor tweemaal twee dagen deze verblijfplaats (begin en einde juni 2015).
Positief punt: de ligging op wandelafstand tegenover  Downtown Seattle en het park in de onmiddellijke buurt.
Negatieve punten: In tegenstelling met de foto’s op de website vonden wij een slordig ingerichte kelder van een woning. De hele inrichting was allesbehalve netjes onderhouden. Veel voorwerpen van de eigenares slingerden er rond. Bij het binnentreden en ook daarna merkten wij een geur van schimmel in deze ondergrondse verblijfplaats. Gedurende twee volle nachten (verhuurder was toen niet thuis) hoorden wij van uit ons bed muziek. In een slaapkamer stond naast het bed een diepvriezer continu te draaien met een hinderlijk geluid ten gevolge. De parkeerplaats was meestal ingenomen door een lokaal voertuig, wat het binnen en buiten halen van de bagage erg bemoeilijkte. De verhuurder zag dit maar kwam niet tussen.
Conclusie: misschien geschikt voor een backpack reiziger, mits een lagere prijs. Wij keren daar niet meer terug.
"
1100714,37553184,2015-07-08,11674603,Ian,"Never met Erika but checking in was easy. Do have to warn about homeless people around the area and literally a couple who live literally across the street. Our first night was very eventful as we woke up at 1AM to someone knocking on the upstairs door for about 10 minutes with the dog barking and going nuts. In addition, you can hear just about anything if you sleep in the room next to the door as the door doesn't seal all that well. If you're a light sleeper, I wouldn't recommend this place. Just like the other reviews, there is a musty/moldy smell once you walk in and everything is all over the place. You do get what you pay for. "
1100714,37867189,2015-07-11,221368,Divya,"Loved the neighborhood and location (we lived in that neighborhood for years, so we were familiar with the location - right off the park, close to all of the Cap Hill restaurants, bars, etc.).  We were just there for one night while we attended a wedding 1 block away.  Probably wouldn't want to stay here for an extended period - low ceilings, no light, awkward layout, but totally fine for spending one night in a very convenient location for a great price!  It was very hard to get ahold of Erika beforehand (didn't get any responses to direct messages, but did get one response to a text).  That said, Erika did provide enough instructions in her welcome email that covered the basics, so we were fine getting in and finding what we needed.  Was also great to be able to park in the driveway.  "
1100714,38028944,2015-07-12,36634931,Allison,"Erika's place is right in the thick of the lovely gay-friendly Capitol Hill neighbourhood! Close to lots of restaurants, bars, coffee shops, stores and bus routes. It was easy to catch the bus (although the one on Denny Way seemed to only come every 20-30 minutes or so, so plan ahead) to downtown and/or towards the Space Needle and Pike Place. 

We had a little trouble with the lock box to enter the suite, but thankfully, Erika was home and cheerfully helped us out. You may want to ask her about the lock box before you've arrived if you've never used one before like ourselves. 

The suite was safe, clean with towels/toilette paper provided. There's also a neat vintage tub. I'd definitely stay here again. 

Thanks Erika! "
1100714,39276178,2015-07-22,24449834,Rachelle,"The host was not around, but we were okay with that. The place was very close to shops on Broadway - a great sushi place and a breakfast place, not to mention the pharmacy -- so very convenient.  The park was a little drug-addicty, but eh, no problems. The place itself was quite cool. "
1100714,39485771,2015-07-24,31361944,Matt,"The nieghborhood was fine with bars and coffe shops near by. What was lacking was the cleanliness of the apartment. There where no clean towels put away, instead they were left in the dryer. The pictures of the tub were deceiving as you could not stand up to take a shower and it is very exposed to the rest of the apartment. Which makes the apartment less then ideal for anything more then a couple."
1100714,39611554,2015-07-25,3072478,Nimrod,We had a great stay at Erika's. The self check-in/check-out is super convenient. The location is incredible - we had no trouble at all with parking and it turned out to be a 2 minute walk away from a really cool Seattle Block Party street music and food event we really enjoyed. Everything was clean and comfy.
1100714,39766499,2015-07-26,34225955,Wendy,The room was as described and Erica was warm and welcoming. The room was clean and nice.
1100714,40431046,2015-07-31,13737348,Steph,"My husband and I stayed here for one night and I found the previous reviews to be pretty accurate. Erika was very responsive, helpful, and easy to reach by text. The place is in an awesome location, the price is good, and they recently remodeled. Our bed was really comfortable. There are some unique features of the apartment, like the tub which is in its own room (not in a bathroom), which has no door.  I probably wouldn't feel comfortable staying here with another couple, but it was fine for just us. As other people wrote, the noise from above is pretty intense and made it impossible to sleep in. Overall, I would definitely stay here again though."
1100714,40695770,2015-08-01,39953717,Megan,This was such a great room for a weekend getaway! I orginally booked it because it was the cheapest room on short notice but I would stay again.
1100714,41197410,2015-08-05,31546852,Patrick,"Erika kept in touch before my arrival and sent detailed instructions about keys, wifi, check-out, and even recommendations for local places to eat.  The listing was accurately described.  The neighborhood was easy to get around, right next to a large park full of activity."
1100714,41519306,2015-08-07,7089732,Robert,"Had a great stay with Erika. The second bedroom is lovely, if lacking a bit of light. Erika was kind enough to give us a lift into town when we left as she was going that way. Would recommend for a short stay in Seattle."
1100714,42126155,2015-08-11,33971733,Scott,We felt very welcome.  It was a great location in the city with access to everywhere.  It was very reasonable for 4 people.  
1100714,42387380,2015-08-13,33112788,Anna,Erika was very nice and helpful. The room looked like in the pictures. Everything what we wanted to see was in walking distance or easy to reach by the bus.
1100714,43470259,2015-08-19,25363701,Kate,Needed an affordable place to stay for one night last-minute in Seattle and Erika was very prompt & helpful. The space is a basement with two big beds in separate rooms. Ceiling a bit low in some areas (if you're tall) but overall a very spacious listing and had no problems. Very close to all the downtown Seattle hotspots. The space was very clean and Erika is a great host!
1100714,44005176,2015-08-23,31227968,Dawn,The home was in a great neighborhood and we were able to park in Erica's driveway. The bed was comfortable. Issues we experienced were noise from the main house (basement apartment) until very late. There was also a musty smell in the apartment. Neither of these issues prevented us from a good time! 
1100714,44511835,2015-08-26,19322576,Mario,The host canceled this reservation 4 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
1100714,45339721,2015-09-01,40441177,Dan,The place was roomy and located in a great neighborhood.
1100714,45705069,2015-09-05,16356260,Niklaus,Erika and her family were welcoming and very nice. We slept very well in the clean and spacious room. It was very nice that we could check in early and leave our baggage after checkout.
1100714,45816373,2015-09-06,40388415,Freeda,"We had a great  time in Erika's apartment! We stayed there after Bumbershoot Saturday night. It was a great location and we walked back from the Seattle center (about 1.5 miles) after. The apartment is a little funky but cute and clean and was perfect for us. There is a bathtub but not really a shower but it wasn't an issue for us since we only stayed one night. We met Erika briefly and she was super nice and happy to talk to us. Someone (we think the next days guests, it wasn't Erika) did open the door in the morning while we were waking up which was weird but we think they must have just read check in time wrong. You can hear walking around upstairs in the morning but it didn't bother us much and she has extra earplugs if you're a lighter sleeper."
1100714,46713274,2015-09-13,36665105,Jordyn,"This was a great place in a perfectly located area for many activities. I walked everywhere while I stayed here. 
This really is a neat little basement area of Erika's home. 
It was a bit noisy at times, but nothing unmanageable. 
Thanks for a great stay!"
1100714,47280553,2015-09-17,42044095,Elizabeth,"The listing did a good job of showing the place--it is important to explore a little, as the rental gives you the entire space. It was easy to get to the all important coffee shops! "
1100714,48755963,2015-09-28,23436992,Chris,"Erika was very nice! So inviting and had a great setup for a private area to stay in... The space is rather odd. No shower. Only a tub and there are two rooms in the space with queen size beds. You are in the basement with low ceilings and you can hear ALL movement going on upstairs.. Dog walking, people moving about, made it difficult to sleep at times. Despite Erika's inviting home, I cannot recommend this place due to the loud noises from above, she provides earplugs... But it was not enough for my wife and I to get some good shuteye to explore the city."
1100714,49800055,2015-10-06,38842611,Walli,"We were extremely disappointed with our stay.   Even though Erika was friendly,  there was no coffee, cups,  glasses, tissues,  etc provided.  Apartment was not clean to my expectations,  and most of all,  we were concerned there was no Smoke Detector Alarm in the basement!!! Scary if there was a fire to get out!!!   Also,   my husband is 6'2"" tall and he had to walk stooped over since ceilings are low!!  I feel this should have been brought out in the overview comments.   We will never stay there or may not use AIRbnb again when we return to Seattle.   Walli Hinson"
1100714,50329521,2015-10-11,44217727,Ali,"Erika was the sweetest host. I'm so glad we got a chance to run into her and her son and dog to have a chat. The space that she provided was huge and quirky, had its own entrance, a european-style bathtub and a definite feeling of privacy. 

I would warn anyone sensitive to sound though, that they should be aware that this is a basement rental and that because she has a young son and a dog, you can hear them playing around upstairs. Personally, I did not find this problematic; She provides earplugs by each bedside, which worked just fine for me. Also, the bathtub could pose a problem for someone with a disability since it is on an elevated platform. Overall though, I would recommend this place to young, short (very low ceilings) travelers like myself, who want to be close to the fun and action of Capitol Hill, and just a mile's walk from Pike!"
1100714,52805617,2015-11-01,47062995,Jonnee,It was a very nifty spot with great location... But during the stay I was unaware that I would be sharing the space and tub with another person as they didn't know either so the showering situation was weird as it's only a curtain separating the room and also would have to come into my space to go to the toilet besides that situation if you rent both beds it's a really great rooms to rent
1100714,54526109,2015-11-21,34409212,Irene,"The place is completely private. it was great to me.

The place is definitely basement of house and spacious and equipped such as microwave, laundry machine and bed+bath with shower-tub.  
I read review that sound from upstairs could be heard and that is true. There is a boy and this can be serious on weekend. However it is okay to me.

The problem was parking. there were no street parking space around the house. I turn around house 3 times but could not find. So I parked behind of host's car. but one day other guest parking there and I parked really narrow front yard. When I go out I touched wall and damaged rental car... :(

Anyway it is reasonable to afford cost and I recommend to the guest who is not sensitive on upper sound (Thump and talking sound) and no have a car.

8131881,49415756,2015-10-03,43674195,Alli,The host canceled this reservation 7 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
8131881,52415111,2015-10-29,44913904,Colin,"Rick's place was fantastic. His description thought is very accurate, but if you don't mind some short ceilings, it's a great place to lay your head after checking out the city. He supplied an oil radiator that kept the room nice and toasty and was available with an easy call/text/or email. It was a great place to stay and was located in a rad neighborhood.  Definitely recommend this place if you're looking to see Seattle on a budget. 10/10, would rent again. Cheers."
8131881,53707366,2015-11-11,2135520,Alan,"I enjoyed my stay here, it was perfect for what I needed. Rick's description is spot on - it is indeed a ""Hobbit Hole"", a small (smaller than even a small hotel room), private basement space with low ceilings and just enough room for a bed, a tiny desk and chair, and a kitchenette. The kitchenette has a microwave, toaster oven, coffee maker, and full sized fridge. The bathroom is normal-sized and the shower has great water pressure. 

There are no frills here - it's clean but not completely ""finished"", there are some odds and ends lying around. The towels, bedspread, etc, are utilitarian. This is a place for sleeping, eating, showering, and heading out to do whatever you're in town to do. And you can head out easily. The neighborhood is nice and quiet, residential, but just two blocks from a nice stretch of coffee shops and cafes, as well as a pharmacy and grocery store. Access to public transport is easy, and it's a cheap Uber ride to downtown. 

Though we did not meet in person, Rick was available to answer questions and provide information as needed. Overall this is a good value for a no-frills private space, in a great location, and I would stay here again. "
8131881,54982349,2015-11-27,44143876,Brandon,"My girlfriend and I chose to stay at this place for about 4 to 5 days and were very pleased. Although we never met the host, he was very accommodating. He gave us detailed directions on how to get there from the airport and supplied us with a heater and other useful things, and he emphasized on asking him if we needed anything. The place had a fridge, a coffee maker, a microwave, a tv, a radio with surround sound, and a full bathroom just as suggested. We were very pleased with the place and how nice the host was and would like to stay at this place in the future."
8131881,56025083,2015-12-08,44887040,Karla,"I have nothing but good things to say :) My boyfriend and I stayed here for about a week and it was awesome! Rick was very reachable throughout the whole trip and so accommodating. Very nice guy too! The room does indeed have low ceilings, but it gave the room that much more character :) the shower was amazing and the little heater provided warms the room up extremely well. I would definitely recommend this place!"
8131881,56661289,2015-12-16,36659810,Blake,"Great stay! Well situated, very easy stay. Nice and cozy place. Rick was very accommodating! I'd definitely stay here again."
8131881,57241161,2015-12-23,8675047,Rachel,"Rick's space is just exactly as listed, and was absolutely perfect for me. It's a cozy little basement that is just right for going out and exploring (or visiting nearby old favorites, in my case) but was comfortable enough to lie around and watch TV on a rainy afternoon. Our paths didn't cross during my stay but I always felt that my questions were answered as quickly as if he'd been upstairs. "
8131881,58003417,2015-12-31,45452006,Hyung Suk,He is a great host because he quickly responded what I ask. I had some issues with the place but it will be okay unless you use many electronic devices at one time and lose your fuse.
9532861,55326289,2015-11-29,49931038,Tara,"Beautiful loft. Internet did not work, which was unfortunate. Great place if you are looking for minimalism and a convenient location."
8101950,48634004,2015-09-27,43900518,Jonathan,There was a bottle of wine and some chocolate waiting or me upon my arrival!
3066740,35290812,2015-06-17,28982649,Desiree,"We attended our son's graduation from the University of Washington and decided to make a vacation out of it. I saw the 'Silhouette'  and thought that it would make a perfect gathering place for our adult family. The boat is very close to Gas Works Park, Fremont Brewery, and many local restaurants. Chip and Karen made us feel welcome and were very helpful with sight seeing suggestions and different eating options. The highlight of our trip was the cruise that we chartered - if you have the time, I highly recommend it! It is a great way to see Seattle! Chip was our captain and being a lifetime resident in the area, was very knowledgeable of the city and various landmarks. The 'locals' that attended the cruise raved about how much fun was had! Karen was very helpful and made sure all of our needs where met throughout our stay.  The dining and gathering areas on the boat are spacious and there are lovely views of the city - both day and night. There is a full size refrigerator/freezer and the kitchen is fully equipped so you can prepare easy meals if you want or there are restaurants close enough to walk. We rented the kayaks that Chip and Karen made available and we all had fun taking turns paddling around lake - it was my first experience in a kayak and it was great! Overall, it was a very memorable trip and if you are thinking about a visit to Seattle you should see if the 'Silhouette' is available for your stay."
3066740,35784255,2015-06-22,15479667,Larry,"Karen was waiting for us when we arrived, helping us board the boat and getting settled. The view is amazing, especially at night as you sit on the foredeck looking at the Seattle skyline. The boat is very comfortable with all the amenities of home. We had never stayed in the Freemont area and thoroughly enjoyed just discovering our neighborhood and the many restaurant and Pub choices."
3066740,38991473,2015-07-20,6452843,Cathy,"Karen met us in person after some easy texting to set the time, and showed us the yacht and everything associated with it. There was even coffee and cookies set out for us!!"
3066740,40501783,2015-07-31,38602189,Randall,What a great way to spend the week!  Karen greeted us immediately and provided everything we needed.  The Silhouette has beautiful views of the city both day and night.  The accommodations were perfect.  Wonderful location.  Would do this again!
3066740,41415451,2015-08-07,20380557,Yu,"Karen is really nice to show us around the boat. The boat is modern, clean and has great city view. The only complain is that there is sound of wave hitting the boat on and off, sometime at night and sometime at early morning. Beside that, I totally enjoyed it!"
3066740,42025279,2015-08-10,560834,Jimmy,"Fantastic hosts, lovely boat.  Cheerful tour around the lake and then cleared out."
6404427,35863330,2015-06-22,181621,Barbara,"Wow! When you step in the door of this home you will know, with a capital ""K"", why this house was featured on architectural designs as one of the 15 must-have Coastal Bungalows. I'll try to cover some of the highlights and then review the hosts and location.

 ""Coastal"" ""urban"" and ""bungalow""  with a definite Seattle/Northwest feel, describes this home...just the right mix of casual and elegance. 

Lets start with the million dollar view of Elliott Bay from the living room and front bedroom and front deck.  And the view of the Olympic mountains with gorgeous sunsets.  The front boasts floor to ceiling glass windows. Beautiful, richly appointed decks, stone walkways, huge hot tub/jacuzzi, gorgeously landscaped for complete privacy, sky lights abound, and french doors from both rooms onto patio front and back patios. Fully appointed high-end designer kitchen, smart -TVs in each room and in living room, rich leather sectional, and super comfy beds and linens. 

If you are creative at all - and maybe even if you aren't - you will literally spend hours admiring the design work and the personal touches.  The hosts completely renovated this house, including the landscape, themselves.  One small personal touch is the rock floor area in the entry and wood stove (gas) pad created with rocks they hand picked from a local beach. It's these kind of touches that add the warmth and earthy, energy felt throughout. 

Robert and Yaicha are fun and laid back. Close-by and easily reachable, they did not intrude in any way. Complete privacy. Easy check in with electronic code and no key to worry about. Delightful people, for sure. And they are avid outdoors people and can direct you to hikes, beaches, ski trails, you-name-it.

The neighborhood is gorgeous. Very quiet, yet walking distance to all kind of action on Queen Anne Avenue. Restaurants, coffee shops, pubs, spas, specialty shops (check out the olive oil and balsamic vinegar shop) and boutique shopping for the ladies.  

The architecture and views from this neighborhood are outstanding. If you love homes with character and gorgeous yards, you'll love strolling about with your morning coffee.

Close to downtown, Seattle Center, the waterfront, parks, farmers market....just a few minute bus ride - or a walk for the more adventurous - and you're there.

I've traveled throughout the world and this is a one-of-a-kind gem! And frankly speaking, the value is outstanding. This is an entire, self-contained, turn-key house. Perfect for a small family retreat - Holiday gathering - Baby Shower - Bridal suite for the bride and her mom and sisters - great location for a girls get - away.  In fact, this would be the perfect place to rent for an entire month if you are looking for temporary housing until you find something permanent - or if you are temporarily working in the area.
"
6404427,36905236,2015-07-02,23052923,Stephanie,"This home was the perfect place for an Anniversary get away in Seattle!  Robert and Yaicha made us feel at home with fresh cut flowers, raisin bread and an Anniversary card to greet us.  Located in Queen Anne, just a few minutes outside downtown, it created a relaxing and safe environment for us to unwind from our adventurous days.  It had all the essentials to enjoy several home cooked meals and watch the sunset each night.  This coastal bungalow felt like a cozy cottage perched on the hillside of a quiet cul-de-sac.  We would recommend this home to any of our friends or family and can't wait to come back next year! "
6404427,38145038,2015-07-13,33045757,Olivia,"Yaicha and Roberts place was exactly as shown in the pictures. The place was extremely well kept and clean, the decor was beautiful and the space was functional for our stay. We were 4 adults and one baby and we had ample space to relax in the living area the front porch and back patio. The kitchen was fully equipped with a gas stove, all high end appliances and cookware.  The in suite washer and dryer was also convenient.  Best of all, was the outdoor jacuzzi which was nice to have after a long day in the city. We were also glad the place had 2 outdoor parking spaces. 

The location was about a 15 min drive to downtown area which didn't bother us. 

Yaicha and Robert were great hosts, responding promptly to our questions before our stay. They were kind to leave us an information booklet and a loaf of raisin bread from the local bakery which was delicious.  They also accommodated an earlier check in time given we were travelling with a baby which we greatly appreciated. We did not have to meet them given the place has a convenient keyless entry, but if we would have loved to thank them in person for our lovely stay. 

I would definitely stay here again in the future and would recommend this place to friends."
6404427,38518494,2015-07-16,2316655,Jolene,The house was beutiful and perfect! Its in a really good safe neighborhood.  We found it easy to get around using lyft.  Its just minutes from downtown with a beautiful view of the lake.  There are also bikes that we didnt get to use but i would imagine it would be lovely ride around the queen anne neighborhood. The owners also left us a wonderful loaf of bread from a local bakery that was absolutely delicious! They had coffee available for us and even wine! The kitchen is fully equipped for making a nice breakfast or dinner and then there was stuff to make smores! How awesome is that! I can go on and on but just know it is truly wonderful!
6404427,39030318,2015-07-20,1684198,Eric,"Excellent stay, greeted with local pastries, a kind note, and everything was pleasant and as described. Thank You!!!"
6404427,39582378,2015-07-24,35708268,Grace,"We were very pleased that Robert and Yaicha were able to accommodate our request to stay at their lovely place on such short notice!  When we arrived we found the place exactly as pictured with the additional treat of scrumptious raisin bread from Macrina bakery.   We had everything we needed and more to feel at home -- plenty of clean towels and linens, Netflix, a well appointed kitchen, and the convenience of laundry and a dishwasher.  Robert even serviced the hot tub prior to our stay -- such a treat for cool evenings!  We absolutely recommend staying here, and hope to do so again in the near future!!"
6404427,40221722,2015-07-29,6167950,Sarah,"This home was beautiful with great attention to detail. The hosts, Robert & Yaicha, are very friendly and approachable (and they even left us a delicious welcome treat!). The neighborhood is quiet with stunning views of the sound (which you can also see from the home). They have bikes, tennis equipment, and even marshmallows for roasting. We loved the kitchen supplies and ended up staying in and cooking - then going into the glorious hot tub - more nights than we had originally planned. Great spot for a relaxing Seattle vacation. "
6404427,41952200,2015-08-10,6668106,Scott,"It's always nice when a property is as nice or better then advertised. Such is the case with the Queen Anne bungalow.  A nice loaf of cinnamon bread from local bakery waiting for us as we arrived. What a great location.  Nice little (par 28) golf course at bottom of hill with a putt putt course.  Another bonus was finding the stairs of Queen Anne. There are a lot of them.  Great place, we will return."
6404427,42693276,2015-08-15,35793918,Jesse,The owners were awesome and gave great recommendations!  The wifi went out and they were over instantly to reset it.  Would recommend to anyone!  Such a cute house and awesome location! 
6404427,43233413,2015-08-18,13002145,Tim,"Nice quiet neighborhood, place was as described. Plenty of privacy on the back deck. It's about a mile walk to bars and restaurants through beautiful streets.  I reason to leave QA!"
6404427,43598546,2015-08-20,9331269,Julia And Mic,"Yaicha & Rob's place is a fantastic mix of both their talents in a blend of comfort and beauty. I enjoyed my stay- sleeping in the back bedroom looking out onto the outdoor space and had a relaxing soak. I loved using the kitchen and our group felt completely at home making meals and looking out on the great view. The walk around the neighborhood and Queen Anne was perfect for a quick bite, and their location makes it easy to get out and around the city and beyond. Great job making it perfect vacation spot for us!
"
6404427,43776226,2015-08-22,20442220,Sara,"Our family had an amazing stay at the Queen Anne Coastal Bungalow. It is clear Yaicha and Robert lovingly maintain the house and property  -- thinking about every detail to make our stay special. They really go above and beyond! The house was just as beautiful in person as in the photos and squeaky clean! The kitchen was a pleasure to cook in -- newer Jenn Air appliances, sharp knives and they even had All Clad pots/pans! The location is great -- especially the sunset views of the Sound and the mountains -- something hard to find in a short term rental on Queen Anne. Nothing short of ""dreamy!"" We hope to visit again soon!"
6404427,44769553,2015-08-29,27894059,Paige,"This is a wonderful place to go and rest. Colors on the wall are nice and calming. There is a great Seattle & Sea theme through out the home. Even a BBQ if you feel like staying in and grilling. All their appliances are top notch and working wonderfully - my favorite surprise being the dual headed shower! Note that Yaicha & Robert live next door, so if anything goes wrong they are happy to help. Has a nice view and is a little hide-away in Seattle. Awesome for a week stay from out of town or a staycation if your local!"
6404427,45099039,2015-08-31,31046880,Tara,"We had the most wonderful experience staying at Robert and Yaicha's Bunglow! It was just as described, a little oasis in the heart of Seattle! We would definitely come and stay again. The hosts were so kind and welcoming, even leaving a loaf of fresh bread from a local bakery for us! It was beautifully decorated with a beach theme. As it was raining one day, it was wonderful to have a cozy fire in the kitchen fireplace! Highly recommend! "
6404427,46135583,2015-09-08,36442961,Alice,"This was our first trip to Seattle and our first airbnb experience, and both were exceptional.  The location in Queen Anne was perfect for us as it is just a few blocks from our daughter, and near the wonderful restaurants of Ballard and Fremont.  The house could not have been more perfect for us - the front porch with its amazing view, and the backyard with its grill, hot tub and complete privacy.  I love that no screens are necessary (we're from Maine where the bugs are legendary), so we could leave the sliders open.  The kitchen is well equipped, the Franklin stove took the chill off the mornings....it was perfect for us.  The hosts, Robert and Yaicha, were welcoming (left us flowers and a wonderful treat) and accommodating, available to answer questions but otherwise invisible.  It was a great experience all around!  Thank you Rob and Yaicha, thank you Seattle!!"
6404427,46546672,2015-09-11,42956912,Hiroko,"It was beautiful my first airbnb 
We had wonderful 2days
Nothing inconsistent thing.
Their place are so considered and very clean ,we just inspired 
I feel like a travel during stay
That place has a lot of aspects like a staying ocean, staying mountain and staying oriental country...

Yaicha and Robert are so kind and quick response 
Hot tub and outside fireplace are very nice 
We spent good time in there
We want to be back the place in a year."
6404427,47473710,2015-09-19,38490295,Dolores,"Listing was as described, great location, wonderful hosts. Quick to respond if we had questions during our time there. Hot tub was very clean and a great perk of the house. "
6404427,48291448,2015-09-25,25277673,Martha,"What a great experience staying in their home!  Beautiful views, very clean and comfortable with many personal touches throughout the home.  Located in a great neighborhood to explore Seattle.  The hosts were close by and easily accessible for help with anything needed.  Yaicha even set out champagne and cupcakes to celebrate my engagement through the request of my friend, which was a really nice touch."
6404427,50015029,2015-10-08,448134,Anne Kristen,"We really enjoyed our stay. It was lovely having a place and a parking space to call our own!  The hot tub and fire pit were great.  The beds were comfy and the kitchen was awesome!  If jt hadnt rained so mucj we would have BBQed!  The left us bread for the next day breakfast and we're very gracious about us coming early.  We wanted to stay longer but couldn't,  unfortunately.  If you have guests coming into town or you're visiting, we highly recommend this place!  And you'll likely be happier with this than with paying for more than one hotel room!  We will likely be coming back for another stay.  Also, if you don't want to drive Uber and post will pick you up or drop off food for you.  And there's a whole food just a few blocks down hill and lovely parks near by.  "
6404427,50260576,2015-10-10,11096578,Jenny,A very comfortable stay close to everything Seattle has to offer.  The home is beautiful! Great hot tub was a bonus!
6404427,50659884,2015-10-13,23879091,Xiaotong,Best airbnb experience ever！This house is soooo pretty，with full living goods. Yaicha and Robert are really nice and helpful，they let me early checkin and late checkout. And they answered all my questions in five minute.
6404427,51035781,2015-10-17,2326280,Casey,Had a great experience staying at this house! Everything was definitley as advertised and the hosts were more than willing to answer any questions I had before and during the stay. The house is right near public transportation so getting into the city wasn't an issue. Had a great time overall and the house was lovely. 
6404427,51574414,2015-10-21,46172245,Peter,"Yaicha and Robert's bungalo is fantastic.  Beautiful finishes, amazing views and and great hospitality.  They even had a fresh loaf of bread waiting for us as a welcome gift.  It really is as nice as it looks in the photos - I'd highly recommend this location to anyone visiting the Seattle area, especially if you're planning a vacation and can take advantage of your surroundings."
6404427,52439251,2015-10-29,740362,Yoko,What a lovely home!  The hosts have created a very relaxing environment and made the process of getting checked in very easy.  I run an art space and needed to find accommodations for our visiting artist and curator. The hosts were gracious to accommodate our needs and I was confident our guests would be well taken care of - definitely would use them again!
6404427,52778627,2015-11-01,16660107,Liz,The house is beautiful and feels very spacious. We didn't get to use the barbecue or fire pit since the weather was a bit wet and windy but next time most definitely.  We will be back!
6404427,53348314,2015-11-08,723429,Grant,"Great place and great hosts! Living room bigger than expected, and loved the hot tub. Convenient location too."
6404427,54004604,2015-11-15,46978117,Allison,What a great little bungalow!  Loved every minute!  It was just what we were looking for for our weekend get away with friends.  Thank you!
6404427,54740927,2015-11-23,46502316,Amina,The house was really nice and clean and described/ pictured really accurately! Yaicha and Robert were very accessible and helpful also. Check in was really easy and everything was very clear and instructions were given for most of the home appliances. Will definitely recommend this house to others when visiting the Seattle area! Thanks again :) 
5272327,33405714,2015-05-27,22775914,Tanesia,"Emily & Ty were great! The accommodations were perfect for my boyfriend and I...spacious, cozy and in a great location. I communicated primarily with Emily and she kept in touch and on top of things from before our trip right up to the moment we left. She covered all bases in making sure we had all the information and things we needed. The welcome letter waiting on the bed detailed everything we needed to know while staying as well as suggestions for restaurants and stores nearby. While I only got to meet Ty & the adorable little doggies, my boyfriend got to meet both Emily & Ty and I was impressed with their additional suggestions for places to check out on our day trip to Bainbridge Island, and a cool, innovative ice cream shop close by. We appreciated how helpful and genuinely nice they were. Emily is sweet as pie and it was obvious we chose well in staying here. We would definitely return if ever we're in Seattle and need a place to stay again. Thanks for the hospitality! 
"
5272327,34467824,2015-06-08,33658124,Kaja,"Die kleine Keller-Wohnung bei Emily ist sehr gemütlich! Sie hat alles, was man braucht und auch die Größe ist optimal. Die Gastgeber haben sich sehr um uns bemüht und waren immer ansprechbar und hilfsbereit. Alles sehr, sehr nett!"
5272327,34881875,2015-06-13,7726925,Daniel,"Emily's description of the unit is very accurate. She did an outstanding job of being available before, during and after the rental period for any questions or concerns. I never had any doubts that my in-laws, whom I rented the unit for, would be in good hands. Easy check in. Very clean unit with all the essential amenities. Emily knows all the right things to do for an AirBNB unit and does them with sincerity. "
5272327,35687437,2015-06-21,33478898,Kathryn,"Excellent location, adorable mini apartment. Clean and comfortable space in lovely neighborhood within walking distance to excellent bakeries, restaurants, and the waterfront. Emily was a great host who replied to all requests and questions right away. Would definitely stay with her again, thanks so much!"
5272327,36971923,2015-07-03,9130837,Sam,"We had a wonderful stay with Emily. She was a wonderful host, very attentive and responsive, and the apartment was excellent. It was spacious, clean, comfortable and in a great location, just a 10 minute cab ride from downtown, a 15-20 walk from Lake Washington and with plenty of restaurants and coffee shops in the immediate vicinity. Emily also provided plenty of material to help explore Seattle, including a couple of great suggestions in the guide she'd written up that we didn't see elsewhere. We truly enjoyed our stay, and would absolutely, 100 percent visit again on a subsequent trip to Seattle.  "
5272327,37331536,2015-07-06,13379924,Edward,"What a lovely host.
The best thing is when there is a glitch and it gets fixed with a smile.
That is Emily
"
5272327,38130284,2015-07-13,33786503,Victor,"The place is great! It is cozy and bigger than expected. Only 20 minutes outside of Seattle, it's in a nice peaceful neighborhood. It's super close to the bus station for easy travel and close to some pretty good eateries and boutiques. Emily was welcoming and very quick to respond. I had a great experience and would definitely stay there again!"
5272327,38721596,2015-07-18,34376111,Orlando,"Emily and Ty ( Ziggy & bubbles) were just great. We had excellent communication throughout our stay. The garden apartment was just as it was described. Neighborhood is amazing. Shops and restaurants so close by. We had great coffee and breakfast at Belle Epicurean which is literally right around the corner!  We were 10-15 minutes away from downtown. If you are looking for a great quiet nook of a neighborhood that is close to everything, this is the place! We didn't get a chance to sit in the backyard oasis which looked so relaxing because we were out exploring Seattle everyday (our first time here).We highly recommend Staying in this little beautiful apartment. You Just can't beat the location! We would not hesitate to stay here again!! Thank you Emily and Ty!! "
5272327,40098371,2015-07-28,34146397,Tiffany,"Emily's mini-apt photos just don't do it justice! My boyfriend and I were visiting Seattle to escape the humid NYC heat and luckily found Emily's place after combing through inflated hotel rates. We're more independent travelers so we spent most of our time outdoors but we could still appreciate how homey the apt felt. She really thought of everything: from the detergent for the W&D, clean linens, coffee maker (and coffee, although we didn't use it), air freshener and really helpful Seattle informational packet, we never felt lost at any point. She was also quick to reply if you had a question and was more than available if we needed. Totally recommend!"
5272327,40740125,2015-08-02,34084620,Nicole,"Emily and Ty's mini apartment was adorable and spacious! Super accessible to downtown (15-20 mins by bus), but with so much to explore just within walking distance (Viola and Belle Epicurean were by far my favorite spots). Although we did not see Emily and Ty until mid-way through our stay, they were easily reachable through text. I appreciated that Emily reached out ahead of time with instructions  and made sure we we had everything we needed after check-in. There was also a great ""welcome packet"" waiting for us when we checked in with food and activity recommendations around Seattle.

Emily and Ty have a wonderful space with great amenities and are sweet hosts - would highly recommend!"
5272327,41281031,2015-08-05,33381604,Viktor,"Leiligheten lå 15 minutter med buss unna Pike Place Market, og bussforbindelsene var gode. Vi ankom sent på kvelden, uten at det var noe problem. Leiligheten er stor og ren, og inneholder alt du trenger for en kortere periode i Seattle, WA. Flott med egen inngang. Emily hadde lagt frem brosjyrer og et kart over byen. Hun pekte også ut noen lokale perler i nabolaget hva gjelder mat."
5272327,41598688,2015-08-08,33607261,Dana,"Emily was very accommodating and easily reachable by text. The apartment is roomy and the bed is comfortable. The location is very convenient - walking distance to a convenience store, eateries, and bus stops. "
5272327,41950486,2015-08-10,11027812,Tom,Great place! We had no glitches. It was also a wonderful neighborhood and Emily was very accommodating.
5272327,42390682,2015-08-13,34079712,Kurt,"My girlfriend and I visited Seattle for the first time a couple of weeks ago, and Emily's place was a great fit for us! It's clean, spacious and cozy, but what makes it so ideal is its location. If you don't plan on renting a car, the bus stop is right around the corner and you can easily rely on public transit to take you downtown. In addition to the bus, we used lyft and uber, and it was only about a 5-10 minute drive to get to Pike. Emily was also a great hostess, and she was always very easy to contact. Don't hesitate to ask her for any recommendations! She will also have a list of places to go/eat ready for you on the table. Thanks, Emily, for providing us with your awesome place!  "
5272327,43308728,2015-08-18,16022774,Jaclyn,I had such a great visit in Seattle at this mini apartment. It had everything that I needed and was in an awesome location - cute restaurants steps away and a great run through the Arboretum and out to the water just a block or so away. Emily was extremely helpful and available during my stay. I would definitely stay here again if I'm back in Seattle!
5272327,43765094,2015-08-22,9271726,Rachel,"Loved staying at Emily's place! Was able to easily Lyft and Uber my way around the city and then come back, freshen up, do a load of laundry and get a good nights sleep.  Would not hesitate to stay their again. "
5272327,44527289,2015-08-27,34909988,Elyssa,"The apartment was so much more than we had expected. It was wonderfully decorated; Emily and Ty were very sweet and accommodating (and have the cutest pups!). It's close to Capitol Hill, so for a young couple it's great to be so close to the night life. There are also chic cafes within walking distance for a more ""intimate"" date night. You can hear noises coming from upstairs, but it's not overwhelming at all. The house faces the East, so it's great for getting natural light in the morning. I would definitely recommend it to anyone staying in Seattle :)"
5272327,46292076,2015-09-09,26608673,Fatimah,Emily and Ty's place was very cozy for my husband and I. it was perfect for our short getaway. We loved the fact that her place wasn't too far from downtown and parking around her neighborhood wasn't bad at all. 
5272327,46900256,2015-09-14,33919990,Jennifer,"Emily was an excellent hostess! The space was clean, comfortable, and inviting. Location was perfect - we walked to several restaurants during our stay, all of which Emily recommended in her welcome packet. Emily was easily reachable during our stay & more than willing to answer questions if needed. We felt right at home and would definitely stay again. Highly recommend! "
5272327,47502725,2015-09-19,6465719,Martin,"The apartment was very comfortable and spacious; there's plenty of room to relax and great amenities like a TV, kitchen, etc. It's in a great location, around the corner from places to eat and drink and a quick drive, bus or bike ride to Capitol Hill, Madrona, Madison Park, downtown, and other neighborhoods. Emily is a gracious host; she messaged me to check on how things were going and if I needed anything, and was very quick to respond when I asked for something (a towel). Highly recommend staying here!"
5272327,48887602,2015-09-29,25777960,Sue,"Emily and Ty are the most friendly, down-to-earth, gracious hosts we could ever expect.  We loved the neighborhood in which this BnB is located, with great eateries within 2 blocks.  And the unit is completely cozy and clean and bigger than we expected.  We took advantage of the outdoor deck and loved spending a couple evenings there. "
5272327,50100034,2015-10-09,44128118,Maria,Amazing place! Very clean and cozy! Emily was a great host! Close to many restaurants and neighborhoods. Easy parking! Would highly recommend! 
5272327,50488125,2015-10-12,363242,Mika,"This was such a great trip and experience!

The place:

The pictures very accurately represent what you see once you arrive. The space is a basement converted into a single unit apartment; the ceiling is a little lower in some areas so for those that have a bit of a phobia about low ceilings, this might not be the place for you. I'm 5'10"" and was able to walk around without issue but did bump my hands into the ceiling once or twice when I was doing my hair :)

The apartment is clean, simple and stylish and you can tell that Emily and Ty put thought into creating a space that was inviting and fun. Shampoo/conditioner, body wash, blow dryer and even toothpaste was provided (extra points for that as we forgot toothpaste). If you are doing an extended stay, it's nice that you have access to a full size washer and dryer. 

If you are an *extra super duper* light sleeper, you may want to bring ear plugs if only because Ty and Emily do live upstairs (the minimal noise we heard didn't bother us one bit but it might bother some people). They were extremely courteous about keeping quiet in the mornings so as not to disturb you during potential beauty sleep hours and I'd imagine this would not be a problem for most people.

The hosts:

Emily and Ty are awesome people. Really, I feel like we made some true friends. They are super laid back and just really good people. We ended up hanging out with them all of Friday night. They were kind enough to share a bottle of wine with us and we even had an adventure out for a late night Dick's run! 

They really cater to the individual(s) staying with them and make themselves available as much or as little as you want them to be. One of the days happened to be legit rainy and they were sweet enough to loan us a couple of umbrellas. It can be tough out there for a girl and her hair ;)

Their two little Yorkies, Ziggy and Bubbles, are adorable and happy to keep your lap warm if you let them. We're major dog people so felt right at home :) 

We had so much fun getting to know Emily and Ty. I was really sad when our trip came to an end in part because we love Seattle but also because we would have loved hanging out with Emily and Ty some more. 

Summary:

The location is choice. 
You're super close to downtown Seattle and the Capitol Hill area (15-20 by bus or 10-15 minutes by car). There are also a number of restaurants and bakeries within walking distance. The area was nice so if you simply like to walk around like we do, this will be a nice area to do so. 
The price is right.
The hosts (and dogs) are really sweet.

I would totally recommend staying here!"
5272327,51349458,2015-10-19,5054599,Thomas,"Emily made me feel welcomed from the day I submitted the request to stay in her apartment. She was able to accomodate me late arrival and made sure I had full access to her whenever I needed anything. She's done such a great job with notes and instructions that we didn't need anything.

Very positive experience and definitely a recommendation."
5272327,52234028,2015-10-27,44302997,Young,"Good neighborhood with easy access to downtown Seattle. Plenty of easy parking around the corner, and all amenities as described. Thanks Emily!"
5272327,54249766,2015-11-17,46071497,Katelin,"The Mini-Apt. couldn't have been a better home base for my boyfriend & I during our quick 3 day trip to Seattle for the Seahawks/Cardinal game. The location couldn't have been more perfect for what we needed & Emily couldn't have been more friendly/welcoming. 
However, if you've never experienced Seattle in the Winter, plan accordingly as it is a much different kind of cold than what a Dry Climate State resident is acclimated to.  
Also, for anyone over 5'6ft. tall - This unit is not Large & Tall friendly. :) "
5272327,54732999,2015-11-23,2457116,Jason,"The apartment was very clean and much bigger than expected! The ceilings are a little low because it is a basement apartment. I'm 5'10"" and didn't bump my head on anything. If your over 6 feet tall, it might be a tight fit. The included washer dryer is great so you don't have to pack a lot, especially in the colder months where packing multiple sweaters and jackets can cost a lot in check-in fees. We went in the middle of November and outside was about 35 degrees whereas inside it was about 65. Being from California this is still cold to me, but still very comfortable. The space heater was perfect for the coldest nights. The shower was nice and hot and the bed was nice and comfortable. There's also plenty of little shops and bars within walking distance! I would definitely recommended this for anyone traveling to Seattle!"
5272327,55118888,2015-11-28,46563866,Bella,Very comfortable and cozy room!! Has everything :)
2764126,19077509,2014-09-06,14305458,Ester,"The Townhome of Freddie was a very pleasant place to stay for two weeks (2 persons), we really enjoyed the house. It is very comfortable, open and light. The house is couldn't be any cleaner and is well equiped with all kitchen, bathroom and laundry utilities. The neighborhood is safe, shops are only one block away and a few restaurants within walking distance. Freddie made us feel welcome and at home and she is a good, helpful and friendly host. Also the contact before our booking was fast, easy and i even could come and visit the place before booking it. We definately recommend this beautiful house and nice host!"
2764126,20021145,2014-09-22,19854229,Abraham," THANK YOU
 FREDDIE!  We loved staying at your townhouse and really  appreciated the private garage.  It seems that parking is  prime real estate in Seattle.  
 
 We dropped off our daughter at Seattle
 University and it was an easy walk to/from the campus.  Grocery  shopping was a breeze with both Safeway and Trader Joe's  being a 5 minute walk away.   The bus line was  around the corner so it was convenient to get around on  Seattle's transit system.
 
 Your home was immaculate, tastefully furnished (loved the pillow-top bedding), and having wireless internet was a bonus.  
 
 We highly recommend your
 place to those traveling to Seattle and look forward to  staying at your place again when we visit our daughter.
 
Mahalo,
Abe & Pam

The neighborhood was close to Trader Joes, Safeway and a couple of cute restaurants.  We would definitely stay at this Townhouse again if it's available.

"
2764126,28601565,2015-03-27,26330017,Paul,"Freddie has been so helpful during the 6 weeks I stayed at this perfect townhouse.
Always there when you need her and takes very good care of her townhouse - clean, modern, and a very pleasant interior. Very we'll situated - close to many shops, bars, restaurants, parks, and the lakes. Really great place and THE reason I'm renting the place again next month.
If you want to be close to the city centre or need to work north or south of Seattle, this is the very suitable. ( only took me 30 mins from and to Bothell)

Freddie, thank you so much and looking forward to renting again in a few weeks time.

Paul"
2764126,29067301,2015-04-03,29623509,Anne-Evan,"Freddie was so welcoming, even staying up very late for our arrival.  The condo was just perfect for our week-long stay.  We had plenty of space to relax, and the kitchen and laundry made it so convenient.  But the big treat was the garage for our rental car!  Not having to fight for street parking was a huge plus!  Thanks for having us, Freddie!"
2764126,29848552,2015-04-13,28930702,Peter,"Freddie was out of town when we arrived, but her friend greeted us warmly and with all the information we needed.  The apartment was immaculate and nicely furnished.  It's located in a lovely and convenient neighborhood, but looks out on cars and backs of other buildings with a sliver of a view from a few windows.   Our only real problem was the construction right next door that began at 7 AM.  We were not warned about this, but when we met Freddie at our departure, she told us she didn't know the construction would start that soon.  
       Also, a warning for the elderly and disabled -- there are many steps, and they're a little slippery.  Bring slippers with soles.  "
2764126,33905718,2015-06-02,29539412,Brian,"This wonderfully appointed condo and Ms. Barrett's attention to our needs resulted in a very relaxed visit to the Capitol Hill area. The condo was very clean, well supplied, with lots of window light, nicely appointed bathrooms, and provided a very comfortable time while in Seattle.  The use of the secure garage as part of the condo was very nice in an area with challenging on-street parking. "
2764126,34284333,2015-06-07,29562868,Jay,"We loved the townhome- it was beautiful and spotlessly clean. The neighborhood is wonderful and close to downtown, the university, Lake Washington, Pike Place Mkt,  and the Seattle Center. Freddie was gracious and made sure we were comfortable. Having a garage was also a major plus. 
We would definitely love to stay there again.
Jay and Diane"

The apartment had all the amenities necessary for cooking/cleaning and we had a comfortable stay. The location was great for runs to and through the nearby arboretum and there were many nearby shops, cafes, and yoga studios. We had a comfortable and nice stay and would recommend Freddie's place to others visiting the area."
2764126,54264140,2015-11-17,47465941,Robert,What a great trip and awesome house.  Freddie was very accommodating and gave us the lay of the land.  The house has everything you need and is in a perfect location to get downtown in a manner of minutes.  Safeway and Trader Joe's are just down the street.  Loved our stay.  Thanks Freddie!
2764126,54889689,2015-11-25,47526761,Tomoko,All of the facilities are so comfortable. And the location is so convenient. I'd like to stay again if I have a chance.
2764126,55023309,2015-11-27,264956,Chana,Freddie's townhouse was beautiful and perfectly located for our needs.  It was clean and comfortable and had everything we could have wanted for our stay. She was very flexible in allowing us to rent for the amount of days we needed and meeting us to show us around and give us the keys. We'd rent it again in a heartbeat!

Mike was out of town during my stay, so our sole contact was via text  It was Mike's mother that I interacted with in person; and she was unbelievably gracious, thoughtful, and accommodating.  I would love to stay here again."
4583161,27844714,2015-03-13,27923460,Chelsea,"Mike and his family were very hospitable, and the check-in/out was super easy.  The bedroom comfortably fit 2 people, and it had a great mattress.  Great location, great hosts."

Mike was super communicative and answered all of our crazy questions. He was laid back about us leaving and coming in late. He even gave us recommendations to awesome restaurants and bars that made our trip to Seattle worthwhile. If we had more time we would've loved to hang out with him and his friends. 

Overall, we're glad we stayed here. Thanks again for extending your home to us! :)"

4583161,29677249,2015-04-11,28257010,John,What a great experience. Mike and Marianne were such gracious hosts. The space was very private and accommodating! I most certainly would stay again if they have it available when I visit the area.
4583161,29878425,2015-04-13,7412768,J.D.,"This unit offered a clean and comfortable room and an excellent bed and TV with a range of viewing options. Bathroom facilities were quite good, and the host was accessible, informative and helpful. All in all, a fine stay on an excellent weekend."

4583161,33314609,2015-05-26,29097066,Brian,"Stayed over Memorial Day weekend. Great location in Queen Ann central to downtown, Freemont, and Ballard. A walk away from a great overlook of the city at Kerry Park. Parking wasn't a problem. The bedroom and bathroom are very clean and nice. Great bed, very comfortable. The host Mike is friendly and knowledgeable of the city.  I would stay again when in Seattle. "
4583161,33751273,2015-05-31,6194837,Bill,"

Great location for our needs.  Mike was a super host.  Communicated quickly, gave good advice for eating and public transportation, answered all our questions.  Nice neighbourhood.  Quiet and private room.  He went above and beyond to accommodate our needs.
"
4583161,34679168,2015-06-10,34974421,John,"Had a very comfortable and convenient stay in Seattle with Mike. His home is in a very clean and safe area, with convenient access to all parts of Seattle. Room and restroom are very clean, private, and comfortable. Located on the lowest floor of the home where the home entrance is. Loved being able to come in and out without disturbing Mike and his family. 

Overall, very welcoming and hospitable experience. Highly recommend. "
4583161,34746125,2015-06-11,3511231,Matthew,"This was the perfect spot for my quick trip to Seattle. Mike was very communicative and straight forward about what times worked for him, and he was even flexible to help fit my schedule once I arrived in town. The set up was perfect, a beautiful, clean bedroom and bathroom downstairs right by the front door, while Mike was upstairs for anything I should need. 
The neighborhood was quiet and close enough for me to walk around and find a good pizza spot and a cool place to grab a beer.
I cannot write a review without mentioning how clean and comfortable the bed was. I slept great.
AWESOME SPOT. 10/10 would stay again."
4583161,35133137,2015-06-15,34151287,Sage,"Mike was friendly and good to communicate with and the listing accurately described the accommodations. The room was clean and in good condition, the bed was comfy and the location was really convenient for us.

The only thing that was a bit of a surprise was the degree of privacy.  The listing says ""private floor"" and ""Guests have the entire first floor"". This is technically true but the first floor consists of the entry/foyer for the house and the bed and bathrooms are both accessed via the foyer. So if you're moving between the bedroom and bathroom you're out in the entryway for their home. This was not an issue but did come as a surprise.

I recommend dealing with Mike and this listing met our needs well for our recent stay in Seattle."
4583161,35320738,2015-06-17,33945254,Mark,"Our host family could not have been more friendly or welcoming.  They offered us a breakfast of fruit, yogurt, cereal and coffee in their beautiful kitchen, as well as helpful suggestions on nearby places to walk and dine.

We had exclusive use of a bathroom on the bottom floor of the 3-floor condo.  The room itself is just big enough for the bed and a TV; there is no chair or desk,so TV watching would be from bed or standing.  The closet was full of clothes; not a problem for our one-night stay."
4583161,35820239,2015-06-22,10469698,Cameron,"It was nice meeting you Mike. Your place worked perfectly for my wife and I, it was very clean and comfortable and exactly as described and the location was great. It was nice to enjoy a beer on your balcony and take in the view as well. We shall return!"
4583161,36629123,2015-06-29,36542831,Ashley,"The neighborhood and location was perfect. Quiet neighborhood, close to downtown. We ordered an Uber from the house and there was no issue finding the place. Although Mike was not there, his sister let us in and we dropped our stuff and left. Although our stay was quick and easy, the bathroom toiletries (soap, towels, etc) were limited. We had one towel and the soap was almost completely gone. The nightstand was pretty dusty and the room a little small. Perfect size for a couple though, especially since we were just there to sleep. Mike was easy to communicate with and happy to answer any of our questions. "
4583161,38159052,2015-07-13,32502739,Kailin,"This was my first experience renting an Airbnb and it was great! My friend and I had a wonderful time! Mike was quick to get back to us and answer all our questions.  He was out of town during our visit but his mom, Marianne was a lovely host and made us coffee and tea in the morning and recommended some fantastic restaurants for us to try. The room and bathroom were nicely tucked away from the rest of the house. Overall, a great experience! "
4583161,38921808,2015-07-19,27847610,George,"I got this room for my dad and sister as they visited me in Seattle. Mike was very easy to communicate to and very willing to help and make the stay the best it could be. The room is just as listed, a small room with a bed for 2, perfect if you are out and about all day and need a place to sleep at night. Also Queen Anne (the neighborhood) is gorgeous and very walkable. Lots of parks and coffee shops to enjoy. "
4583161,39256660,2015-07-21,23575719,Ian,Quick and easy
4583161,39459919,2015-07-23,38933975,Christy,The room was perfect for our 24 hour visit to Seattle. The neighborhood was extremely quiet but so close to everything. Mike was very welcoming and accommodated our arrival time. He was always very quick to respond to any questions. Thanks and would stay here again!! 
4583161,40124700,2015-07-28,36536928,Eeva,"Mike was great responding to my question before our arrival, and was able to meet and let us drop off our luggage and pick up the key much earlier than the original check in time.
Room and all the amenities were great. Having a private floor, and entrance made it perfect for us. If there ever was any questions the answer was just a text away!
Location was good, about 10 minutes (via Uber of Lyft) to downtown and another cool area called Ballard. There isn't that much within short walk like breakfast places etc. But if you're like us and once you leave the house you're out for the day, it doesn't really matter.
There was a bus stop within walking distance, but we're not bus takers so we used Uber and Lyft for our rides.
Perfect place if you want to go in and out with privacy and spend most of your time out and about exploring Seattle!"
4583161,40378663,2015-07-30,820769,Andrew,Mike was great and so is the room. Clean house and lots of privacy in the lower level.
4583161,40873022,2015-08-02,9287686,Cara,"My boyfriend and I had our lodging plans fall through at the last minute, and Mike was able to help us out in a pinch. His quick response saved us a lot of stress! The room was exactly as expected, in fact it almost looked nicer in person than in the photos. Mike and his mother (who lives upstairs) were very welcoming and pleasant, and they have a very comfortable home. Great area and perfect for a one-night stay. "

6577295,34105278,2015-06-04,34656543,Gary,My stay with Yissie and Kyle was fantastic.  The neighborhood is a mix of new and old but mostly new buildings.  I did not use the rail but if needed it was only a few blocks away.   Really can't say enough about how welcoming and accommodating both were!  I had a great conversation with both and look forward to staying with them again if they'll have me :).
6577295,34185212,2015-06-05,33731079,Bastian,Yissie and Kyle were great hosts and we enjoyed our stay with them. The location near to the train stop in a nice neighborhood is good to go to the city and the airport. Nice clean place as you would hope for and very friendly and good conversation hosts! Anytime again!!
6577295,34491863,2015-06-08,11735783,Bryan,"Yissie and Kyle was the best! The house is very clean, maintained and overall beautiful. Their location is blocks away from the light rail and the neighborhood is safe at night. I highly recommend staying at their place and they made us feel very welcomed. We are definetly going back thanks to them. They are perfect hosts and if we needed something they were always accomadating. They went above and beyond for us. Thank you guys so much and you made our Seattle trip better than expected. "
6577295,34615775,2015-06-09,17987157,Kathy,Nice couple helpful host. Convenient location especially if you need to access to airport. 
6577295,34737620,2015-06-11,34674837,Warren,"A great location for visiting all that Seattle has to offer. Yissie & Kyle made us really welcome in their delightful modern townhouse which is set in a lovely neighbourhood with easy access to the light rail system. Nothing was too much trouble for them. Plus they were enormously helpful and patient in answering a million and one questions we asked them about Seattle, for which we were very grateful. But they are determined to do even more to enhance their guest's experience. We wish them every success. We certainly enjoyed staying with them."
6577295,35253104,2015-06-16,21839360,Jenny,"The house is very clean and new. And the couple is very cute~ I enjoyed a private bathroom inside a private room. The location is really convenient and easy to get access to the bus stop and light rail. Even those who don't drive( like me) can enjoy their trip. You can self check-in easily. Btw, the mattress is comfortable too~ "
6577295,35357698,2015-06-17,9260824,Yiqing,"I had a great rest at this lovely room. I arrived late, actually midnight, and Yissie texted me and communicated with me a lot. I appreciate her care."
6577295,35833991,2015-06-22,11871275,Seinda,"Yissie's & Kyle's place is very nice. The location is very convenient. Only a few minutes walk to get to the bus stop & Link Station. Yissie is always helpful every-time we needed to ask something, she will respond quickly. It wasn't a problem either when we arrived at 2am, we were able to enter the house without disturbing anyone.
They also provided us with maps & guide books of Seattle in our room!
We fell in love with the city on day one. Hope we can visit again sometime in the future."
6577295,35991518,2015-06-23,36306383,Jamie,"Yissie and her husband are great conversationalists. The room I stayed in was SPOTLESS. The location of their home is extremely convenient for those using public transportation --it is off the light rail and is also a very short walk to many buses. If I ever find myself in Seattle again, I would definitely stay here. "
6577295,36701231,2015-06-30,34864456,Taylor,"We had a very good experience with Yissie and her husband. The room, house, and neighborhood were all as explained in the host description. They were very accommodating with any needs that came up during our stay. I would highly recommend staying here to anyone wanting to visit Seattle!"
6577295,36844608,2015-07-01,2983766,Rachelle & Paul,Yissie and her husband were great hosts! It was a short stay as we only stayed for the one night. Literally in and out! I would suggest to take the light rail from the Airport to Columbia City Station (which is the closest stop to their house) which should only cost you $2.50 oneway. Its an 8 min walk to there house from the station. The area it self has some quirk to it. The room and bathroom were clean and tidy. The bed is pretty small and lying on the floor with no base. More like a futon. Overall great place and I'd recommend staying here. Thanks guys!

6577295,37091829,2015-07-04,32691533,Charlie,"Yissie and Kyle were great hosts!  Their place is super clean as I'm sure you can tell from the pictures.  Having our own bathroom attached to our bedroom was really convenient.

Yissie is on top of communication getting back to me almost instantly.  Parking was no sweat and it was great to stay in a brand new, beautiful home.  

Kyle was great to talk to and gave us some awesome advice about what to do and see in Seattle.  We recommend them to anyone!"
6577295,37480716,2015-07-07,10588125,Lee,"Yissie and Kyle's home is a beautiful, well kept residence in a diverse neighborhood of Seattle. The space provided was great, privacy was respected and they were gracious and welcome hosts. A simple setting to go out on adventures that was near some mass transit was what we were looking for on our trip, and Yissie's place far exceeded expectations."
6577295,37586177,2015-07-08,16138012,Michael,"Yissie is very friendly and accommodating.  After checking in, we felt comfortable coming in late after taking in some local entertainment, and her house is very clean."
6577295,37685232,2015-07-09,36294235,Robert,Our hosts made us feel very welcome. We parked our car by their home in the early afternoon and took the light rail into Seattle. Very convenient and we avoided all the traffic and looking for a place to park!
6577295,37988520,2015-07-12,33447591,Cam,"Location:
Convenient and safe neighborhood to walk to the light rail. Great if you're not renting a car and it's $5 all day for the light rail. 

House: 
We didn't meet Yissie but we did meet her lovely husband, Kyle.
The house is new, clean and there's an adjoining bathroom. The ""futon"" mattress was comfy, stocked with towels and exactly the minimum we needed for comfort. 

Thanks for your hospitality, we really enjoyed our stay. 
"
6577295,38403130,2015-07-15,14977796,Nicole,"Yissie and her husband Kyle were fantastic hosts to us! Yissie was proactive and timely with communication, and she and Kyle were incredibly warm and friendly. The room they have available feels very private and has its own bathroom, which you get to from inside of the bedroom. The entire house is very clean and well-kept. They had a Seattle guidebook and lots of brochures for things to do in the city available in the bedroom, which was really helpful for us. Their home is less than a 10 minute walk from a light rail station, which was very convenient for getting into the city. There is also a nice set of restaurants and shops about 10 minutes away from Yissie's place. "
6577295,38505884,2015-07-16,839759,Angela,Yissie's was a great and knowledge host. The place was beautiful and the room was as described.

The location was extremely convenient - the light rail was a very short walk away and the best way to get to the Mariner's stadium and other destinations.

Street parking was ample and safe. 

We would definitely stay again if we're back in the area."
6577295,40350768,2015-07-30,33853154,Jason,What a fantastic host!  The space was very clean and she had everything needed to welcome a visitor to Seattle.

6577295,44450413,2015-08-26,33759282,Fridtjof,"We arrived late, but that was not a problem because of the keybox. Though we met Kyle who was a very nice host. We chatted a bit and showed us our room.

6577295,45085480,2015-08-31,36570297,Fay,"The home was new and clean and convenient to public transportation. The neighborhood was okay and had an international flavor. It was a 5 minute walk to the light rail which in one direction went to the center of downtown and the other to the airport. However within several streets in the direction to the center of the city, the neighborhood changed to less desirable. Luckily, the light rail station was in the opposite direction."
6577295,45297963,2015-09-01,40669530,Dianne,Yissie made me feel very welcome and relaxed. Lovely comfortable clean room. Easy access into city. My brief stay was excellent. 
6577295,45484709,2015-09-03,8587007,Carolin,The two are perfect hosts for a Seattle trip. Room with personal shower is all you need. They were totally understanding that we had a huge 9 hour jetlag. In good distance both to the city center and the airport. Would recommend staying here! 
6577295,46135982,2015-09-08,11201639,Chase,"Friendly and very comfortable. 
Great place and easy access to the city.

6577295,46388033,2015-09-10,39405888,Brittney,Yissie and Kyle were very friendly and quick to respond. The space was perfect for a place to crash in between site sighting in Seattle. Keyless entry was nice too. Very much enjoyed our time there!

6577295,49135804,2015-10-01,36541451,Tyler,"Yissie and Kyle were very kind and considerate hosts. They were flexible with our check-in time and gave us full access to their home, even after they left for work the next morning. I would recommend them to anyone passing through."
6577295,49443363,2015-10-04,40193538,Lisa,"We have a very good experience in Yissie's house! 
It's very clean, new, modern style. The location is quite good, very close to the LINK-the very useful and convenient public transportation.
Yissie and her husband are so nice and lovely. And it's so amazing to find we're colleagues, work for the same company in different location. It's really a small world. :)
Thank you Mr & Mrs Kennedy, wish you a lifetime of happiness. :) 
Stay in touch!"
6577295,49732617,2015-10-05,22329687,Zachary,"Yissie was a friendly and easygoing host. They have a lovely, bright, conveniently-located home. I would absolutely stay here again - it was a great experience. "
6577295,50173673,2015-10-10,31768301,Ines,"very nice experience. You can get everything you need here and the district is very pretty. Yissie is a happy and helpful girl, you will definitely love her. We even take a walk aside Washington lake. Her husband is a very good and lovely guy."

I also live that they keep a guest book filled with ideas for places to visit. Their room was perfect for our stay, everything  you need is there, and their house is in a perfect location next to the light rail. I would definitely recommend them for your stay!"
6577295,50483755,2015-10-12,30079085,Soojin,"Although it was a very short and vusy trip in Seattle, their house gave great comfort. Convenient to access to airport via light rail! The guest book is so cute and i had fun to read before going to sleep.  Thank you!"
6577295,51022400,2015-10-17,27388065,Alex,"Didn't get a chance to interact with Yissie that much, except for our brief meeting when we first got in Seattle and she was very warm and welcoming - perfect for that chilly night when we came in. Yissie's home was perfect - very new, modern, & clean! Photos are accurate. Also super convenient to the light rail that was a brief 5 min walk which took you straight to downtown in about 30 mins. I would most definitely stay here again and I recommend it to anyone visiting Seattle! "
6577295,51305330,2015-10-19,43225847,Stephanie,"my experience was good. Our hosts were friendly, helpful, and accommodating. We didn't spend much time there, as we were out and about in the city, but we enjoyed our time there."

"
6577295,52565131,2015-10-30,2994277,David,Had a nice last minute stay with this nice young couple. Just what I needed. Proximity to light rail was a 12 minute walk through a nice newer looking part of town. Dined at a great new Thai restaurant.
6577295,53281939,2015-11-07,34673024,Mark,"Excellent place to stay with close proximity to city. Great communication and accomadatii s were very comfortable with private bath. 

Love this time of year to be inSeattle . 

"
6577295,53408197,2015-11-08,2783827,Jeremy,Yissie and her husband were great hosts.  The house was immaculate and just as described.  The light rail was super close and convenient for getting to downtown Seattle.  The guestbook is a must read as it has entries from people from all around the world.
6577295,53549494,2015-11-09,36498346,John,My second stay here. I think that should speak all of the volumes needed. ;)
6577295,53670243,2015-11-10,36467301,Aaron,"Very last minute trip to Seattle and well worth it. Yissie and her husband were awesome and welcoming. We had arrived a bit early, but Yissie let us drop our luggage off and off we went exploring. The house is in a nice neighborhood. Perfect location to get to Downtown Seattle. 5 minute walk to the Lightrail, about 2.50$ and a 15 minute ride. Would definitely stay here again and explore more of the PNW. "
6577295,53777233,2015-11-12,36498346,John,"I wish I had time to better plan my trip because the location of this place is perfect. My plans changed last minute and I had to rent a car instead of taking advantage of Seattle's public transit system. This couple is a great couple to stay with, Yissie's husband is a great person to chat with, and both are very inviting. Their home is beautiful, and you can see pictures of their very own trips around the house. One thing that's important to me was the cleanliness of one's home, and they really delivered. The bed was surprisingly comfortable, and the bathroom you use is connected to the bedroom you sleep in. If I ever come back to Seattle, I wouldn't hesitate coming back here."
6577295,54097886,2015-11-16,41495401,Meagan,"Yissie and Kyle were such a nice couple! Their house was very nice, clean, and comfortable. They are very close to the light rail, so it made touring Seattle very easy."
6577295,54383290,2015-11-19,34390207,D J,"Yissie and Kyle were most gracious in making their home available for the weary business traveler! The location is spot on as one can easily enjoy the urban village life that the Columbia City neighborhood has to offer, or head into downtown Seattle via a quick train ride. The home is very comfortable, peaceful, and I felt right at home."
6577295,54612586,2015-11-22,47379445,Tcherylindria,My daughter and I enjoyed staying here with Kyle and Yissie. We didn't get to interact with each other but the stay felt so warm. Thank you guys.
6577295,54921571,2015-11-25,42175829,Jonathan,Great place to stay! Yissie & her husband were very sweet & welcoming. Would definitely recommend to others. 
6577295,55043050,2015-11-27,12016162,Anthony,Yisse did a great job with communications and the place was exactly as described. I would recommend them to any traveler!

The room and bathroom are incredibly clean and Yissie and her husband gave us more than enough privacy while making themselves available if we needed anything. "
6577295,56530844,2015-12-14,20919095,Patty,"The place was very clean and very comfortable. Very close to the lightrail  and was easy to get around. If we are back in the area, we would stay here again! I highly recommend Yissie's place."

6577295,57443222,2015-12-26,16953362,Linda,"Yissie and Kyle were very helpful in helping us find their place in the dark and Kyle even helped us carry our bags upstairs.  Their place is modern, clean, and convenient to the light rail and Columbia City.  They even had a very attractive Christmas tree set up in the front room.  We did not see our hosts very much as we were visiting relatives during the holidays and spent most of our time away from the BnB."
3594959,17377830,2014-08-11,18149359,Denise,"This cottage was clean and charming.  Becky and Jim emailed just the right amount (enough to be sure we had everything we needed and that we knew how to contact them if a concern came up).
The location was convenient for walking to the bus line and was quiet at night. We would recommend this place without reservation.
"
3594959,19675875,2014-09-16,18172309,Jacqueline,"Very easy booking and convenient move-in/out.  Cute place with lots of charm, extremely well stocked, and very clean.  Perfect for what we needed as a home-away-from-home for our family until we could move into our permanent place.  Great location - walking distance to excellent restaurants.  Thanks Jim & Becky!"
3594959,21466969,2014-10-18,20691306,Adam,"The house was clean and well presented upon our arrival. It is small, but cozy and it has a nice back yard space. Jim and Becky have it cleaned every two weeks for longer-term guests (if they desire), which helped keep it spic-and-span. 

The location is great with easy access to Fremont stores and restaurants. It is also near a couple of bus lines that are direct routes to downtown. 

Jim and Becky are very honest and are quick to respond to any concerns and requests. They use the garage and part of the basement for storage of their goods and, as such need occasional access to these areas of the house during the stay of longer-term guests. They are very respectful of their guests' schedules for such circumstances. 

Our stay was a positive experience and we wouldn't hesitate to rent from Jim and Becky again. "
3594959,27766736,2015-03-11,11262317,Antonio,Becky and Jim are lovely people with a lovely house. They were incredibly accommodating when I needed some short term accommodations for my elderly uncle. He and I both appreciated the carefully updated but also well preserved fifties feel of the home. It was a wonderful place to help my uncle transition into a new life in Seattle and I deeply thank Becky and Jim for the role they played in going above and beyond as hosts.
3594959,30153295,2015-04-18,30131064,Randall,"We have had a wonderful time staying at Jim and Becky's house in Fremont.  It is well equipped, they are wonderful hosts and were very accommodating. The location is very walkable to numerous sites and places to eat.  It was an enjoyable and cozy ace to stay for the whole family."
3594959,30899186,2015-04-28,30131064,Randall,We extended our stay at Jim and Becky's house for an additional ten days and we continued to have a wonderful experience.  They made the extension very easy which was a great help to us.  We highly recommend their house as a terrific place to call home for awhile.
3594959,45054028,2015-08-31,4814280,Jakub,"Becky and Jim really tried to make our stay as comfortable as possible. I stayed there for three months during summer internship with another intern, and if I would be in the same situation again I would just try to get here before trying anything else. 

We came to a house with full fridge and lots of other food/drinks ready for us. Jim gave us two bicycles with locks and helmets to use during the summer, and we had a car available, on a gentleman agreement to be responsible for it and give him some extra money, depending on how much we end up using it. Plus, we had a lady clean the house every other week.

Given all these additional perks, I would highly recommend the place for longer stays. I think it was non-standard even for nice people trying to make stay as comfortable as possible. However, I am not sure if the price would make it worth for a short (weekend) stay. But on the other hand, I have no idea what are other prices like.

Note that the place is in a steep hill (which I did not realize, but actually liked). The house itself is reasonably large, with garage/basement that is large, but half of it is taken by random stored items.

The only negative thing I could point out is that some people with allergy could have problems with pillows/duvets that are provided as default. I started sneezing a little bit after arrival, and it got better after I took them away. There are blankets and other pillows in the house, so this was not a problem for me. And one bed is relatively tall, so probably not suitable for small kids.

In summary, I stayed for 3 months during summer internship, and am more than satisfied with my stay."
3594959,49123498,2015-10-01,41658070,Jason,"Nice smaller house in Fremont, worked well for our needs.  House was clean when we arrived, and accurate to description. Both hosts were very friendly and regularly checked in to make sure all was well.  Please with the experience over all."
5309974,55498257,2015-12-01,31800813,Kenique,"Me and my girlfriend enjoyed Rachel and Alex's home. The space was very clean and cozy the keyless entire was a great way to get in and out. Rachel was always making sure we had everything we needed, and if we had any questions she always responded within seconds. The bed was super comfy (we slept like babies) and they're adorable baby boy was so well behaved there wasn't any crying or screaming just laughs :) and Alexa was super cool! "
5309974,56769016,2015-12-17,38047681,Peter,"I didn't actually get to meet with Rachel, but she was very responsive whenever I had a question.

Great location for public transportation, shopping, and food. Everything you need is within walking distance. While the location doesn't have a full kitchen, you do have your own bathroom, fridge, microwave, and kettle. The bathroom is also fully stocked, and coffee/tea is available."
5309974,57050832,2015-12-21,49665541,Brit,"Rachel was an amazing host! We didn't get to meet her husband, Alex; but they were both available if we needed them. We were well taken care of! She payed so much attention to the details; there was even a drawer in the bathroom labeled ""forget something?"" with various supplies :) 

The space was very private. The carport was nice, especially on the rainy days! And having our own entrance was great (we had some later nights, and this way we didn't have to worry about disturbing anyone).

Prior to our arrival, Rachel had asked if we drink coffee; there were fresh, whole beans from a local roaster waiting for us! Would definitely recommend to anyone for a superb, comfortable, and affordable stay in Seattle!"
5309974,57478097,2015-12-26,51360199,Daniel,"I was welcomed into a comfortable, charming room with attached bathroom. The bed is VERY comfortable! This is a great place to visit!"
2154617,10415009,2014-02-17,1616025,Leila,This is an amazing place right in the middle of it all. I live in Washington but wanted a night away in the city and after finding this gem in emerald city I will never stay anywhere else. Thank you Nick!
2154617,10700061,2014-03-03,12384021,Ajit,"Great place and location! Plenty of space, comfortable, and in the center of it all. Nick was polite, easy to communicate with, and super flexible. "
2154617,10787182,2014-03-07,1616025,Leila,Again my stay at Nick's was wonderful!
2154617,10828895,2014-03-09,12758638,Michael,"We had a great stay - comfortable apartment, amazing location, gracious host. Highly recommended!"
2154617,10908842,2014-03-12,12445811,Stewart,"Apartment was very much as described.  Cozy and comfortable for two.  Great location we were able to walk almost everywhere.  Didn't manage to try the pool and the sauna was out of commission.
We would stay there again."
2154617,10971761,2014-03-15,2734499,Jason,Nick has a fantastic place. Check-in went smoothly. Great communication. Perfect location! Thank you Nick!
2154617,11055348,2014-03-18,9157828,Thanos,Nick was very accommodating and eager to help us. His place was wonderful and at a very convenient spot in Belltown. 
2154617,12805851,2014-05-11,15225391,Naomi,"Nick made meeting up as quick and easy as possible. He showed us around his building and studio, which was very spacious and had excellent views, and made himself available to us should we need it. This was the perfect neighborhood for a first time visitor. "
2154617,12965671,2014-05-15,5610502,Paulette,"After looking at a couple of hotels and seeing a $300 price that did not include parking we looked at Nick's apartment on Air BnB.  We loved everything about  Nick's apartment.  The location was within walking distance of Pike's Street Market, the Seattle Art Museum and the Space Needle.  We also enjoyed several excellent restaurants within a few blocks walking distance.  Nick's space was very cute and comfortable with a spectacular view of the Space Needle at night.  All of this was for about half the price we would have paid for a hotel room.  In addition, Nick was very accommodating and friendly.  We look forward to staying again.
"
2154617,13059221,2014-05-18,15608211,Brandy,"Great city, awesome place to stay.. Nick was an excellent host - taking extra time to make sure I had everything I needed to enjoy my stay. Very memorable getaway!"
2154617,13191374,2014-05-21,6286823,Georgina,"Wonderful stay!!! Nick was very nice and accommodating . His place was charming and comfy.  I liked the apartment very much! Great location, highly recommended!!"
2154617,13427601,2014-05-27,14737430,Ellyse,"My boyfriend and I stayed for Memorial Day weekend and this was the perfect spot for our stay!

Host: Nick was friendly and very accommodating since we arrived around 10PM. Luckily he works nearby, so he personally walked us to the studio and showed us all the necessities in the studio (e.g. lighting, TV, etc.). He also left his contact info in case we needed anything.

Place: The studio's front door is programmed differently by Nick for every stay. The place is completely furnished with a TV, Bose speaker system, kitchen, queen-sized bed, table + 3 chairs, couch, large comfy chair, and washer and dryer in the bathroom. The place has these neat wall stickers that make the place even more hip. Also the balcony area has a view of the Space Needle (you can actually find this place from the Space Needle if you look hard enough). Only downside is we weren't sure how to activate the AC unit, so we just opened the windows (which was fine). This place is perfect for any individual or couple.

The condominiums also have this 3rd floor garden area, indoor swimming pool, gym, and common area complete with a kitchen. Elevators are super fast here so there's not a lot of waiting. Funniest thing about this place is that the hallways smell like food, as in the first floor restaurants' food (which was completely fine with me and only made me hungrier when venturing out).

Neighborhood: Extremely great area, the condominiums comprise of an entire block with some 4+ star restaurants, bakeries, etc. on the base floor. We literally would walk outside and grab pastries in the morning or get sushi at Shiro's. Plus the neighborhood has a ton of places to eat, drink, and stay open late all within walking distance. The whole Belltown area is pretty safe, even at night, so it's easy to walk around and explore without a worry.

Overall: This place is perfect for any couple or individual wanting to explore Belltown, Pike's Market, and the Space Needle area with or without a car. Very safe, tons of fantastic food options, and comfortable place. I highly recommend this place (and Nick) and I will probably be back here again."
2154617,13491884,2014-05-28,14222542,Rebekah,"The studio is so incredibly central with Pike Place and so on only a couple of blocks away and is situated in a great and safe neighbourhood with bars and restaurants all within walking distance. The studio is stunning; beautifully arranged and decorated with everything you could need, including a small balcony with a view of the Space Needle! The bed is super comfy and the shower is great. Nick couldn't have been more accommodating answering all my questions, making recommendations on bars and restaurants and he even came to collect me and my enormous bag in his jeep. This was a great stay."
2154617,13553005,2014-05-30,1749881,Kitty,Great! Really comfortable and central. 
2154617,13891176,2014-06-07,8596287,Jeffrey,"Nick was wonderful!  We needed to check in early and check out late and he did not hesitate to accommodate us.  Also, his place was in great condition, perfect for a couple looking to experience a night in the heart of it all in Seattle.  "
2154617,14482656,2014-06-20,16068267,Julie,Nick's apt couldn't have been in a better location for us. We walked to Pike Place in a matter of minutes. Space Needle is also a short walk in the opposite direction.  Since I wouldn't agree to go up in the Needle my son said we could get a view from Kerry Park which was a serious uphill walk but  gorgeous views. There are excellent restaurants and bars within walking distance to the apt so it was fun just to venture out and stop wherever looked good. And good it all was! The apt itself was great and Nick showed us around and was very responsive to everything we needed.  Our only challenge was parking. There are several lots nearby but the signs weren't clear regarding after hours parking so we were hesitant to use them so just parked on the street after 8 pm and then paid for parking at 8 am to avoid ticketing.   Great stay!
2154617,14745314,2014-06-25,15838642,Kate,"Nick is easy going and reliable. He was very quick with his responses to all of my questions throughout the booking process and in the lead up to our trip. 

His apartment is literally close to everything. We hit all of the major attractions and didn't need to take a cab once, if you want to be able to walk everywhere this is the place for you. It is very comfortable for a couple and is located in a safe, secure building. 

The apartment was very clean and had all basic amenities required. We made a few meals here and were able to make due with the pots and pans that were there. 

I would highly recommend this rental to anyone visiting Seattle. It is very close to the Clipper - about a 10 minute walk. We also enjoyed the location for our morning runs, we were able to find some trails near by which was great. 

We'd stay here again for sure!"
2154617,14806995,2014-06-26,17160084,Dawson,"Nice one BR. European style courtyard garden overlook.  A real plus for quiet when staying in a busy city.   The neighborhood is a favorite. Gray boutiques. Easy walk to everything, including Pike's.   If it wasn't a short business trip I could have stayed much longer!

Having host nearby a real plus.  Responsive. Great suggestions. And handy w missing chargers!

Rate it a keeper!"
2154617,14824636,2014-06-27,4072376,Kathryn,"Nick's place was a great home base for us to explore the city. We lucked out with beautiful weather, so we were out and about for most of our 36 hour trip! We were able to easily walk or take a brief transit ride to the stadium, ferries, and the train station. The apartment was neat and exactly what we needed for two of us. We were a little slow getting going on our checkout morning, but Nick was very understanding. We really enjoyed our stay :) "
2154617,14982258,2014-06-30,16303141,Elizabeth,"This was my first trip to Seattle, and Nick's apartment was such the perfect home-base for exploring the city!  Most everything my boyfriend and I wanted to do was within walking distance of the apartment.  And the few times we wanted to go further away than a 20 min. walk, there were ample bus lines to catch, just blocks away.

As far as the apartment itself, it was exactly what we wanted.  A cozy, comfortable space with all the amenities we could possibly need.  Of note were the SUPER comfortable bed, the back porch view of the Space Needle, and the awesome Cable station line-up.

Nick was a great communicator both before and during our stay, and it is clear that he aims to be as hospitable and responsive as possible for guests.  He even went out of his way to help us with a last minute issue we had on our final day (didn't involve our stay at his place, but still, he was willing to help!).

"
2154617,15158704,2014-07-03,5538655,Justin,"Great host, very accommodating."
2154617,15412639,2014-07-08,14992576,Jonathan,"My wife and I had a wonderful stay at Nick's apartment.  Perfectly located in Belltown and convenient to all the main attractions (e.g. Pike's Place Market, Shiro's sushi, Seattle Center, etc).   Nick was flexible with our check-in and check-out times and made us feel welcome and comfortable.  We loved the furniture and TV (with surround sound) and the rooftop view was incredible.  We highly recommend Nick's apartment!"
2154617,15529352,2014-07-11,14656236,Nate,"A great experience overall. Nick was good about working around our travel schedule, he offered us some recommendations for nearby restaurants, and even invited us down for a drink at the local bar where he works. The apartment is in an excellent location (within walking distance of plenty of food and drink options, the Seattle Center, Pike Place Market, and the water) and has some cool amenities (a pool, spa, and decently outfitted gym). I definitely recommend."
2154617,15579099,2014-07-12,15470820,Eric,"I highly recommend staying at Nick's apartment. It's just as advertised, in a great location, clean and comfortable. Nick was really easy to communicate with, and was accommodating with my challenging logistics. Thanks for the great experience!"
2154617,15647974,2014-07-13,681462,Jennifer,The apartment was exactly as described and in a great area of town. Lots of amenities in the building and many wonderful restaurants and shops in walking distance. Wish I could have stayed longer. Super easy and convenient booking and accessing the apartment.
2154617,16200169,2014-07-23,14073244,I Hui,"Nick is the best friend who lives in Seattle,we have a good holiday in his studio,if I go to Seattle next time,I will rent house from him again!!"
2154617,16463967,2014-07-28,1333873,Kate,"Nick greeted us as our cab pulled up at the apartment building and made us feel very comfortable with the room right away.  The neighborhood was perfectly located for walking all around downtown, especially the Pike Place Market and Space Needle. "
2154617,16619094,2014-07-30,353965,Mary And Geoff,Nick was great He hosted a friend for one night while we were in town for work. He was very friendly and easy to work with. Excellent neighborhood.  Definitely recommended.
2154617,17094912,2014-08-07,8357314,Melissa,"The apartment was exactly what I was looking for. I had a wedding to attend that was at the Sculpture Park and this was in very close proximity to both that and the downtown area. There’s a small supermarket downstairs in the same building, but if you have time you can get all you need at the Pike place market – 10-15 min walk away. The Space needle is also a 15 minute walk. The Belltown area is full of great funky bars and restaurants and the bakery located downstairs is probably the best in the city. 

The amenities in the apartment were great – the washer and dryer were a great help as I was there for almost 8 days and was running in gym clothes every day, which were limited. Bed was comfortable, as was the couch; hot water worked very well.  The TV and stereo system are great too, though I didn’t get to use them often as I was out all the time. There was a hairdryer (I didn’t see it mentioned yet) and also a drawer with some basic first-aid items inside. So far in the AirBNB accomodations I’ve stayed at, Nick’s place was the first one that had Bandaids and cotton wool etc. – basic stuff which every place should have, but no one thinks about. 

Nick was an excellent host – communication was always quick, and any issues I had were answered and dealt with quickly and effectively. He also had inside a little ‘welcome treat’ which was a really nice touch. I highly recommend his place to anyone wishing to visit Seattle. 
"
2154617,17218483,2014-08-09,17655570,Shelly,We booked Nick's Seattle apartment for our vacation through the Northwest. Nick was very easy to work with and very accommodating. The apartment was absolutely perfect. It's in a grey location of town and walkable to everything we wanted to do!
2154617,17347410,2014-08-11,13835661,Amy,"Great location- walking distance to bars, Space Needle, Pikes Place, etc. Nick was really accommodating to our arrival time and took time to show us around.  We loved staying at his studio!"
2154617,17470636,2014-08-12,19009704,Patrick,"Nick was very helpful. He met us in the lobby and showed us the apartment. Everything was smooth and as expected. Nick was communicative and flexible with times as well. 

The apartment is in a great location and has everything you need. "
2154617,17564829,2014-08-14,7333169,Shaunda,"This place was awesome! The location is beautiful and in such a happening part of town. It is walking distance to Pike Place market and tones of shops. Scattered around the building are multitude of restaurants and coffee shops which was great! The condo is fantastic. Clean, great size, awesome views and tastefully decorated. Nick was a great host. He had no problem adjusting to our late check in, and kept in contact throughout our stay to make sure everything was fine. In short I will be staying here again next year!"
2154617,17642369,2014-08-15,7382140,Eric,"Nick was very helpful answering any questions I had regarding availability/pricing/etc leading up to our stay, and was incredibly accommodating when we arrived.  Super friendly guy and timely.  The apartment was very comfortable and in a fantastic location near pubs, restaurants, and likely the best sushi joint we'd ever been to (Umi Sake House). Our only regret is not renting it for a longer period of time to enjoy the neighborhood more."
2154617,17759722,2014-08-17,6867426,Josh,"Nick was a great host and very helpful showing us around when we arrived.  The place was very nice and in a great location convenient to everything.  It was very comfortable inside and had all the accommodations you could ask for when you are traveling.  The place is way better than a hotel and way cheaper, too.  I would recommend this to anybody."
2154617,17871174,2014-08-18,3993655,Jessica,We had the most amazing weekend in Seattle. The apartment was perfect the location was amazing and everything was a dream. Would totally recommend staying! 
2154617,18167455,2014-08-23,13801651,Natasha,"Nick and his apartment were perfect. The only public transport we caught was to the airport because the apartment was just so central and walking to attractions in any direction was easy. The apartment was clean and had everything we could possibly need for our stay. Nick was friendly and helped us out with some top suggestions upon welcoming us. Even though we were out sight seeing a lot, the apartment's comfortable bed and great entertainment system were nice to come back to and wind down for a few hours. Would definitely recommend."
2154617,18257922,2014-08-24,18763872,Amy,"Great experience!  I felt right at home at Nick's place.  Got to enjoy an afternoon on the roof deck and an evening watching the Seahawks on the awesome tv and sound system!  Laundry facilities, assorted toiletries, easy entry, and even fresh flowers means I'll be visiting again.  Thanks Nick!"
2154617,18531760,2014-08-28,16810142,Nadine,"This was our first airbnb and it was great. Nick was extra flexible about check in which we really appreciated. I used to live in Seattle so I didn't need much guidance but if I did Nick was available and responded quickly. The place was nice and clean and the location was A+! Short walk to the market, space needle, westlake, etc. Some added bonuses: HBO/movie channels, A/C unit, view of space needle, view of waterfront, yummy bakery right below (Macrina), and most importantly...really soft towels. Really every amenity you would have in a hotel and more! "
2154617,18785157,2014-09-01,8494338,Darren,"This place was awesome and we will definitely stay here again.  It was exactly as pictured in a great neighborhood.  We walked everywhere.  Nick met us at the appointed time and showed us the apartment.  Gorgeous, clean and inviting.  We love everything about it.  There are lots of great eating places (the bakery next door is awesome) and you are minutes from the space needle.  We highly recommend this listing.  Perfect for two people!"
2154617,18880219,2014-09-02,11080067,Mark,"What a prefect AirBnB location for Seattle! We parked our car and didn't use it once during our time in Seattle/Belltown! Just a few minute walk to any part of Belltown, Pike's Place Market, & the pier/waterfront. 

The studio itself was very nice. Secure entrance building, comfy bed, AC, balcony with a view of the top of the space needle, a few drinks in the fridge for us, and the list goes on! Nick had a friend managing the property while he was away for Labor Day vaca, and both he and his friend were very nice and had great communication! Very flexible on the check in time and gave us a tour of the studio when we met him.  

I would definitely stay here again when in Seattle! A+ AirBnB Studio!"
2154617,18941393,2014-09-03,8879281,Ann,We were made very welcome by the host and he was very accommodating to a request we had. Great location.
2154617,19035508,2014-09-05,19199984,Josh,"This place is great. Nick met us in the lobby and gave us the low down on the stay. He was helpful with recommendations and city information. The space is nice. It has a modern feel with a great little outdoor deck off of a slider door that overlooks a beautiful courtyard garden and the Spaceneedle. The deck on the 7th floor has a great view of the water and looked to be a comfortable place to hang out. The location was great, with restaraunt a, bars, shopping, and the Market all near by. Would definately stay again. "
2154617,19126343,2014-09-07,12919530,Kim,"We had a great stay at Nick's apartment! It's extremely well located, just a few minutes' walk to Pike Place Market and right in the middle of lots of cute bars and restaurants in Belltown. Nick was really responsive, and the apartment was great. We were also pleasantly surprised to find street parking pretty easily."
2154617,19330123,2014-09-10,20065148,Sheri,Seattle was beautiful. The loft was in the ideal location. I couldnt have been any happier with this experience.
2154617,19418256,2014-09-12,12801039,Brian,"Nick was a great host, and we had a wonderful time staying in his apartment. He met us outside the apartment and walked us in to show us around the building (which we didn't realize had a rooftop balcony, swimming pool, and gym). He gave us some great restaurant recommendations which we are glad we took advantage of. His apartment was located in the ideal location--we could walk everywhere, and it was surrounded by several great streets with many bars and restaurants. Would definitely stay again if we return to Seattle."
2154617,19471494,2014-09-13,2342651,Neha,"Nick was punctual, responsive, and available. The listing is accurate. The location is perfect, everything is within walking distance."
2154617,19524199,2014-09-14,18690774,Jacek,My first airbnb rental was with Nick.  The apartment is great. Nick is easy to work with and I wouldn't hesitate to stay in his place again.
2154617,19738319,2014-09-17,8882064,Jessica,"Friendly host. This place was great. Right in Belltown and easy walking access to Pike Place, Clipper, shopping and great restaurants. Would highly recommend if you don't have a car."
2154617,19799761,2014-09-18,1764104,Raj,"Nick was a gentleman and was accommodating in terms of picking up the keys later than usual at his work.  The apartment is nice and is in a great neighborhood.   My meeting was walking distance from the apartment which helped relieve stress in the morning.  Unfortunately, I could not figure out how to get the A/C to work late at night and I did not think it was a good idea to bother the host.  "
2154617,20022891,2014-09-22,19990021,Missy,The description was completely accurate.  The studio is conveniently located and felt very safe.  We loved it!
2154617,20204368,2014-09-25,20774701,Amanda,Was a great experience!  The apartment and location was perfect.  Will for sure that there again.  Thanks nick

We had a fantastic stay, the accomodation was perfect (clean, well-equipped, centrally located, comfortable). Nick was very accommodating with our arrival and departure times. We would definitely stay here again!"
2154617,20718768,2014-10-04,21221078,Joey,"Nick was great and accomadating, even after we showed up a half hour late (due to the rental car agency). Gave us a quick tour and a few ideas to kill some time, and he was on his way. Very clean studio, view of the space needle as advertised, full kitchen included. For my first booked airbnb, I couldn't have asked for anything extra. Perfectly situated between Pike Place and Seattle Center (went to both), parking was the only thing that was a bit of a pain (but seems common for Seattle). This place is usually all booked up, which is a testament to Nick, his place, and the location of it. Highly recommended. Thanks Nick, we had a great stay."
2154617,21081568,2014-10-11,17296553,Michael,Great place with an even better host.  Nick met up with us and gave us a tour of the apt and the building as a whole.  He gave us recommendations  on where to get a bite and brews! Communication was prompt and really made us feel at home even though we were across the country.   The location is really great and smack in the middle of the space needle/ Emp and pikes place/ the aquarium.  If you are thinking about staying here just go ahead and book it.  You will be stoked like we were. 
2154617,21388344,2014-10-16,16796756,Chadwick,"My experience with Nick and his location in the Belltown neighborhood of Seattle was fantastic.

Nick was prompt upon meeting us, courteous when giving us a tour, and everything was as described.

The studio apartment was clean, furnished, and had all the necessary amenities. The Belltown neighborhood is ideally situated for Seattle first-timers, as it sits in the middle of Pike Place Market and the Space Needle. Transportation around the city is very easy from this location by walking and public transportation.

Communicating with Nick throughout the reservation process, stay, and exit were a breeze. He was quick to reply and answered all questions sufficiently.

I would most certainly return to stay here on a future visit to Seattle.

Thanks for everything, Nick!"
2154617,21454783,2014-10-17,22422304,Ben,"Perfect! First of all, Nick is a great guy with excellent communication. He gave us great recommendations for some late dinner and drinks. Both if which are a 2-3 minutes walk from his place.

The apartment itself is great. Quiet and Clean with more amenities then we had time to explore. The bed was also very comfortable. You'd be hard pressed to find a better place to stay on Seattle. We can't wait to come back!"
2154617,22513897,2014-11-08,23355546,Benjamin,"Perfect stay, kind host"
2154617,22920153,2014-11-17,12650764,Erik,"The check-in was really easy and the apartment was nice and clean. The bed is comfortable and the kitchen had utensils/cookware. There was a large screen TV and Bose sound system that I didn't really use. 

Nick was also really nice and easy to communicate with. My only complaint was parking, it would have been much better if the apartment had a parking spot. I do not recommend bringing a car!

2154617,23632128,2014-12-07,15483088,Jeff,"Nick's place was wonderful, exactly as described and a perfect location for my partner and I. We walked to Pike's place and the Space Needle without any trouble at all and barely used our car.  Nick was easy to communicate with and messaged us during our stay to see if everything was alright. We didn't make much use of the Wifi but it was great to have such a fast (100 mbit) and reliable connection.  We'd definitely stay again and recommend the space."
2154617,24681196,2015-01-01,21187396,Justin,Everything was great and was clear to the description. Nick was very accommodating in arrival and during the stay.

2154617,24934432,2015-01-04,6913135,Sandy,"Nick was fantastic and so patient with us. There was almost a 2 hour wait to cross the border from Vancouver to Seattle which meant we were going to be extremely late. He was so understanding and told us not to worry. We arrived around 4ish and he was right there waiting to greet us.   I was so tired, I just wanted to stay in and watch movies all night while my husband wanted to meet up with his friends. This made Nick's apartment perfect for us. The TV package allowed me to watch movies all night long, tucked under the blanket on the most comfortable sofa and my husband just walked over Pike street and met up with his friends for dinner. There are restaurants and a great coffee place below the apartment.  Everything you need is here. Will definitely book his place again when we're back in Seattle. BTW, Nick is super stylish ; )"
2154617,25120560,2015-01-06,1297354,Jessica,Loved everything! Hope to come back! And one of the best bakeries in town is literally underneath the building. 
2154617,25158863,2015-01-07,1297354,Jessica,Fantastic studio in a very convenient location. Great rooftop deck and wonderful building amenities. Loved the gym! Nick was awesome and wonderfully communicative. I'd love to stay again. 
2154617,25330718,2015-01-12,13126654,Rozlyn,Second time staying at Nick's place (came up for the Seahawks / Panthers game).  He made some furniture upgrades to the apartment which made it more comfortable and cozy.  Nick was very responsive before and during my stay and was super flexible with my requests.  This is definitely my go to spot for whenever I return to Seattle.  Go Hawks! 
2154617,25609019,2015-01-20,20338221,Kendra,"Nick did an excellent job of making us feel welcome.  He stayed in contact with us the morning we arrived and waited in the lobby to help show us around.  He added many things to the apartment that made a huge difference in our comfort level.  For instance, to go cups for coffee, tuperware, laundry detergent and floss!  He gave us suggestions on the area and was very friendly.  The neighborhood was in walking distance from Pike's Place and many local shops and bars.  Plus, the ocean was only a few blocks away!  If you are driving, parking is only $5.00 per day on the weekends, very reasonable for the area. "
2154617,25860991,2015-01-27,4242473,Frederick,"Great place , centrally located.  Nick was very accomodating. I even extended my stay!"
2154617,26113936,2015-02-03,4242473,Frederick,Great
2154617,26302314,2015-02-09,25304838,Brian,"This was my first time in Seattle and it could not have gone any better. My father and I were able to walk just about everywhere we wanted to go and I was surprised by the close proximity of all the great restaurants in Belltown. 

Nick was a great host as he was responsive, welcoming, and on time when we arrived from the airport. When we got to the apartment, he showed us the unit and all the amenities with it, showed us the gym, and answered any questions that we had. The balcony view on the 7th floor was a lot better than I thought it would be even if it was raining. 

My father slept on the queen-size mattress while I slept on the twin-sized day bed. I slept on it for 4 nights and had no problems falling asleep. Bathroom was very comfortably sized for 2 people and the full kitchen was a plus over a hotel room.

Good experience and I would definitely come back to Nick's spot. 

Thanks again!"
2154617,26544447,2015-02-15,3725614,Kathy,"Great location.  Condo had everything we needed for our stay.  Nick is a great host.  Thank you for a comfortable stay, Nick."
2154617,26695527,2015-02-17,17427772,Jenni,"My boyfriend and I came up for a quick trip to Seattle and stayed at Nick's place--it was perfect! Nick was very flexible with things (like our choosing to utilize the garage parking space after already showing up) and his place was awesome. Great location, modern, comfortable, and actually really spacious! Loved having a Keurig for the weekend, too! 

We will definitely be back! Thanks Nick!"
2154617,27345241,2015-03-02,149324,Valerie,"Nick's place is in a great location, with incredible restaurants and shops just downstairs, and walking distance to the main tourist attractions. Nick also accommodated my schedule, and was very welcoming when I arrived. The apartment was roomy, with more than enough room for 2 people, and a lovely view of the Space Needle. We had a great time!"
2154617,27892295,2015-03-14,6226788,David,"Nick was very personable - both before arriving and on the night of arrival.  He was very understanding that I was getting in late that evening.  It is a very nice apartment - comfortable and very convenient (I left from here to catch the Victoria Clipper).  Really great location.  Close to Pike's Place Market.

The most difficult part of staying here was walking past Macrina Bakery next door to the lobby.  I seemed to stop in and have some of the wonderful offerings whenever I could."
2154617,28136467,2015-03-18,20775866,Robby,Played tourist for the weekend & Nick's condo was the perfect place to stay. Plenty of space for the two of us & the building was centrally located in Downtown with tons of food & shops within walking distance. Condo has secure entry & was well stocked with everything that you would need for your stay.
2154617,28228716,2015-03-20,6789947,Ernest,We enjoyed our two night stay with Nick as host in Belltown downtown Seattle.  The location is excellent and we parked our car for the two days that we are there. Nick arranged for us to park under the building so it was secure and a good place to park. The coffee shop just outside of Nick's apartment has amazing pastries and really good coffee I would recommend it.  We look forward to our next visit.
2154617,28318843,2015-03-22,27700099,Becca,"This loft was incredible.  Very comfortable, very clean.  Everything you could need to have a comfortable stay was provided by Nick.  This was in a great neighborhood, very close to all the touristy activities.  Thanks Nick for a great stay.  We'll be back!"
2154617,28689388,2015-03-28,17427380,Karl,Awesome location - we were able to walk everywhere from here.  Nick was quick to respond to my booking and was easy to contact to figure out logistics.  Will definitely stay here again next time I come visit.
2154617,28795548,2015-03-30,27338876,Larry,"This was the perfect place for my teenage daughter and myself. It was comfortable, hip and above all, safe. This was my first airbnb so I didn't know what to expect but Nick was gracious and friendly. The condo had everything we could hope for in a place to stay. Coffee, tea, shampoo, TV and WiFi. With the view facing the courtyard, there was no noise to contend with even though we were in the heart of Bell Town. We were within walking distance of both the Space Needle and Pike Place and had a bunch of food and drink choices within a block of our place. Everything was perfect for our stay in Seattle!"
2154617,29000873,2015-04-02,28801507,Amanda,"We absolutely loved our stay in Seattle at Nick's downtown studio and would suggest it to anyone! We stayed in Seattle for two nights with our golden retriever pup, using the apartment as home base while we explored the city. We also paid to use the parking spot under the building which was so great and helped with the packing/unpacking process. The apartment was clean and comfortable, with great views of the Space Needle, full kitchen, laundry, bathroom and living room with awesome amenities. We walked to Pike's Place Market and brought a ton of fresh food back to the apartment - as well as walked to dinner, lunch, breakfast on both days. There is also a small city dog park a few blocks away that we used a few times, but did drive to Fremont for a larger dog park one day. We will definitely stay here again if we are back in the Seattle area and would highly suggest it to anyone on the fence! "
2154617,29503630,2015-04-08,3955470,Corinne,"We had a great time staying at Nick's studio. It was perfect and the location was fantastic. We walked everywhere. Area is very safe, plenty of restaurants around. I would highly recommend Nick's condo for anyone who wish to visit Seattle. The condo is very cozy and Nick is very helpful and friendly. "
2154617,29688956,2015-04-11,8332798,Tommy,"Wouldn't have had an amazing experience in Seattle if wasn't for Nick's last minute booking of his beautiful downtown studio. He was very accommodating and showed us around the apartment and answered any questions that we had. He was very quick to respond to any questions that we had via the messenger. It was within walking distance of Pike place and a couple of blocks from the pier, aquarium, and the space needle. As for nightlife, there are great bars and restaurants just right outside the apartment complex. Definitely booking this room again when I go back! "
2154617,29913606,2015-04-14,18195054,Emily,"Nick met us at the apartment to give us a quick rundown of the apartment and neighborhood.   He's a friendly guy with a great apartment in a great location.  The building was secure and the neighborhood felt safe.  The apartment had everything we wanted and felt quite large despite its small size.  It's very convenient to restaurants, coffee shops, and major tourist attractions (Pike Place Mkt, Space Needle, etc).   I highly recommend staying here when in Seattle!"
2154617,30691718,2015-04-26,29080480,Chris,Nick's place is awesome very central to everything. Nick was a great host. 
2154617,31158131,2015-05-03,20452975,Søren,"Jag var mycket nöjd med min vistelse hos Nick. Lägenheten är liten men fullt tillräcklig. En dubbelsäng och en enkelsäng, soffa med stor fin TV-anläggning. Köket räcker för enklare matlagning. Läget är suveränt, nära till allt. Takterassen är härlig och husets gym och pool bra för den som vill använda det.
Nick var mycket tillmötesgående och svarade snabbt på frågor."
2154617,31642597,2015-05-08,28154316,George,"Staying at Nick's was a fantastic experience.  Great communication.  He was right on time meeting up with us, very welcoming and knowledgeable.  His place is right in the middle of everything!  Walking access to many Seattle destinations.  As a bonus it it very close to pier 66 which is where were were embarking a ship for the next leg of our trip.  I would without hesitation recommend this apartment and I would absolutely stay again when in Seattle."
2154617,31899681,2015-05-11,30002759,James,Nick was very accommodating about getting us the keys given our hectic arrival schedule. The apartment is located in a great part of town with a short walking distance to so much. Would definitely stay here again. 
2154617,32126835,2015-05-14,16207606,Peter,The apartment was awesome. Very luxurious. Everything you could ask for including a view of the Space Needle.
2154617,32885263,2015-05-23,9775363,Brad,Everything was excellent.  Nick was very attentive and the checkin process was smooth.  Definitely recommend staying at Nick's place.
2154617,32983713,2015-05-24,12126717,Khilna,"Nick was super helpful and accommodated our needs really well. The apartment was incredible and well equipped, location is perfect! Within walking distance of many attractions. Definitely recommend this apartment to others."
2154617,33247698,2015-05-26,10418592,Marcia,"Three of us stayed at Nick's place during the Folklife Festival. It was a perfect location, close to the festival and to lots of restaurants, coffee places, stores, and to the bike path along the water for morning jogs. We walked everywhere, no car needed. Nick met us at the door, and was incredibly helpful during our stay. The fob for the front door didn't work, and he came immediately to bring us a new one. He also let us keep our bags in the room after check-out time, since our train left later in the day. The room was very quiet and comfortable (even the day bed), small but perfect size for 3 friends. We really liked the artistic walls. We didn't have time to use the building's exercise room, hot tub, etc., but the idea sure sounded nice! I would definitely recommend staying at Nick's studio apartment, and hope to return there in the future."
2154617,33592228,2015-05-30,13325456,Cori,"Great location!  Nick was a great host and balanced showing us where everything was and leaving us explore the city.  The Apartment was cute, and could easily sleep 4 people, so for the 2 of us it was perfect.  Great little view of the space needle, and we had breakfast on the rooftop terrace with overlooking the water.   Easy to walk everywhere, Pike's place is about 10-15min walk, and lots of places to eat within even a 2 block radius.  I would most definitely stay here again."
2154617,33806645,2015-06-01,20623049,Aidan,"Great apartment in a great location. Easy and secure access and plenty of food and drink options very close by. Very accommodating host, would certainly stay here again if I was in Seattle. "
2154617,34117849,2015-06-05,27759556,Melissa,"We loved our time at Nick's place. It was a perfect location for us on our first visit to Seattle, walking distance right between the touristy places we wanted to go like the Space Needle and Pike Place Market. There are a ton of great bars and restaurants right in the neighborhood too. A+ on walkability. The space was just right for the two of us and we found ourselves relaxing a lot more than we usually do at hotels - it was nice having some living space and a kitchen. Nick was very kind and flexible in meeting us and made sure we had everything we needed (wifi password, multiple towels, area maps, etc.) There's the bonus of things that make it feel like home - a makeup mirror, candles, and even movie channels on the TV. I didn't plan to be watching much TV on vacation but we ended up spending our last night in due to a crazy early flight, some rainy weather and needing to pack and do laundry so it was definitely a perk. (The washer/dryer were a godsend for us at the end of a weeklong trip!) The rooftop deck and patio balcony were pretty views, my husband enjoyed the gym and we always felt very safe and secure. This was our first Airbnb experience and definitely won't be our last. I'd recommend this for anyone visiting Seattle and looking for a clean and private place to stay in a decent price range!"
2154617,34528478,2015-06-09,19459534,Sarah,Perfect spot to stay. Easy walking distance to almost everything. Bed is very comfortable. Communication with Nick was great. Would stay here again. 
2154617,34634746,2015-06-10,31339124,Melissa,It was perfect! Close to everything clean and welcoming.
2154617,34843665,2015-06-13,26163985,Lori,"Nick was an excellent host.  From the moment we requested the reservation, he kept in constant contact with us and, because he lives and works only one block from the apartment, he was readily available to meet us upon arrival.  The apartment was clean and well maintained and had everything we needed for a comfortable stay.  The location couldn't have been any better!  Centrally located downtown, we could easily walk to all of Seattle's iconic attractions.  I can easily recommend this apartment, as well as Nick, to anyone wanting to visit Seattle."
2154617,35198777,2015-06-16,27839731,Brendan,Great location!!!!  Very quiet building!  Close to all tourist spots!  Nick is a great host- on time at check in and provides recommendations for local hot spots!
2154617,35381060,2015-06-18,13158830,Stephanie,Nick is a great host.  He was very accommodating and helpful plus Seattle itself and his location close to Pike Market and great restaurants was perfect.  Both my husband and I recently were laid off due to the downturn in  oil and gas and so we stressed about still going on this trip but his place is nice and affordable and the local restaurants are close by and very reasonably priced with excellent food.  Plus I also recently had knee surgery so it was perfect that I didn't have to walk too far.  The bakery right downstairs makes amazing breakfast sandwiches!
2154617,35998231,2015-06-24,26705245,Aaron,"Wonderful apartment in a great location.  Walking distance from Pike Place Market, the Space Needle, and the Stadiums.  It was a great space that was very well laid out and comfortable.  Nick was a excellent host who took the time to check in on us during our stay.  I would recommend his apartment to anyone else visiting Seattle and would definitely stay there again."
2154617,36653377,2015-06-30,1747933,Sean And Rebecca,"This is the second time we have stayed in this great Belltown building and it never ceases to please. You're close to everything and Macrina is right downstairs for incredible coffee and excellent breakfast items. You're 5 minutes from the waterfront, 10 from the market, and maybe 15 from Seattle Center. Nick is incredibly accommodating throughout, from planning the trip, to check-in (even late!), to heading out. His place also has a portable a/c unit which is super rare in Seattle. You'll be cool and comfortable. As a bonus, the studio is really more like an alcove studio with a half wall providing privacy into the bedroom. My wife and I were very comfortable with the bed and my brother was even able to take the twin in the living room no problem for one of the nights. All round great place and another great trip in Seattle!"
2154617,36794635,2015-07-01,30553521,David,"Nick's place is a great location for exploring Seattle. He was very responsive pre-visit, and met us promptly when we arrived. Within 15 minutes we were all set up. We paid the extra $20 to park in the building and that was absolutely worth it. Kitchen and bathrooms were fairly well appointed. Maybe not the best for cooking huge meals, but adequate for anything else. View is of the interior courtyard....nothing special but nice nonetheless. Nick had great suggestions for dinner and drinks and the like (Edgewater Hotel for on-the-water drinks was one of those). I'd recommend this place for sure. "
2154617,37137205,2015-07-05,19861103,Philippe,"Nick was there when we arrived. Apartment as described, clean and well located. Nick had also installed an air conditioning device, which was really appreciated in the heat wave occurring at the time we were there. Highly recommended. "
2154617,37323505,2015-07-06,1137225,Ian,Nick was on point! Was kind enough to have an AC in place for the rare hot Seattle weather! Awesome location!! Will stay again!!
2154617,37638581,2015-07-09,27351150,Travis,"Nick was a great host, was easy to get in contact with, and took the time to walk us around the building and show us all the amenities.  Its a great Belltown location, with a fantastic view of the Space Needle as well as the sound (from the observation deck).  We would definitely stay again.  Thanks Nick!"
2154617,37848644,2015-07-11,32164883,Aimee,"Nick's studio apartment was in a great location and provided a comfortable space for my husband, baby, and I. There was plenty of room for our baby to explore and for us to set up his pack and play. Thanks to Nick for the great accommodations!"
2154617,38116041,2015-07-13,3659554,Lauri,"We had a great stay at Nick's place!! The location is fantastic and the apartment suited our needs perfectly. When a small issue came up, Nick was very quick to respond and fix it right away. Thanks Nick for your hospitality!!"
2154617,38482903,2015-07-16,11443397,Lisa,"Great experience-definitely recommend. Location was perfect, nice apartment and building. Great beds. Especially great for two friends- a studio, but two real beds. "
2154617,38983872,2015-07-20,28718630,Laura,The location was perfect for our trip. We walked everywhere... From the space needle to the waterfront to pikes market. Also a great location for dining. Nick made it very simple for check in and check out. The space was perfect and the air conditioner during the heat was so appreciated. Perfect first experience to using airbnb!
2154617,39151664,2015-07-21,24771702,Kyle,Nick was very responsive and came to meet me at the apartment. Made everything very easy and the location was amazing. He even put in an AC unit because it was so hot when we were there. Overall a very nice stay.
2154617,39401306,2015-07-23,32783168,Joy,"Nick was great! So quick to answer all of my questions, super friendly. Apartment was a great location, able to walk everywhere. Bed was comfortable! Would definitely stay here again!"
2154617,39606746,2015-07-25,8819587,L,"Nick was great! He made sure that we were welcomed and despite an early check in had the place ready quickly. Its an amazing apartment in an ideal location in Seattle, easy walking distance from Pike's Market and the Space Needle. So many great restaurants and bars just blocks away. Would definitely stay again."
2154617,39912395,2015-07-27,7333169,Shaunda,"Great place all around! Perfect location, clean and comfortable, Nick is great! Always our first choice to stay here when we come to visit Seattle. "

The apartment was comfortable, clean, and in a great neighborhood. Good bakery right downstairs and a wide variety of restaurants with sidewalk seating within an easy walk. Really enjoyed our stay. Thanks, Nick. "
2154617,40888443,2015-08-03,27666791,Jenifer,Nick was amazing to work with!  His place is in the perfect location to walk or Uber around Seattle!  This was my first time using Airbnb and Nick did an amazing job of answering all my questions!
2154617,41924307,2015-08-10,30078677,Ricardo,Great location and overall fantastic place to  stay. One of the best travel accommodations I've experienced. 
2154617,42289774,2015-08-12,34398094,Dan,"Nick's place was the perfect accommodation for our two day trip to Seattle. The condo and building are both nicely appointed with modern amenities and the bed is super comfy. The location cannot be beat for someone who wants to be in the action in Seattle. It is a 7 minute walk to the Pike Place Market and about the same to the space needle... We even walked to SafeCo field for a Mariners game in less than 40 minutes. The neighborhood itself (Belltown) is great also with lots of restaurants, coffee shops, and bars. I definitely would recommend Nick's place for those traveling to Seattle."
2154617,43511107,2015-08-20,6735237,Sherry,"Nick's place was great!  Loved the location, especially the bakery downstairs!  Convenient to so much.  Inside was clean & very nicely furnished.  Booking for next year!"
2154617,44529979,2015-08-27,22172759,Vivien,"Great host and place! My friend and I were in Seattle for a short stay. Nick's place is very cozy, clean and comfortable.  We love the area especially the cafe downstairs! Very close walking distance to pike's place, downtown, space needle, and a bunch of cafes and restaurants. Nick was very nice and welcoming. Highly recommended! "
2154617,44753412,2015-08-29,8136293,Cecily,"Loved this stay! Nick met us at the apartment (despite our early arrival), showed us around, and was available by text if we needed anything. The place was small but well-designed, and very quiet. The bed was queen-sized, and super-comfortable, so we slept well (I had a bonus afternoon nap on the daybed, too!) Best of all was the location - just about halfway between downtown and Seattle Center, directly on top of the deliciousness of Macrina Bakery, and just around the corner from Shiro's (Best. Sushi. Ever.).  We had a great time, and found it perfect for the two of us."
2154617,44904363,2015-08-30,5850039,Lindsay,"Nick's studio was in a great location - there was a view of the Space Needle from his balcony as well.  Very convenient for Pike's Place and a wide selection of restaurants and bars (we had some great food!).  Apartment itself was fine, just what we needed for our one night in Seattle.  Nick was very helpful, and extremely accommodating of our arrival time - a great host!"

He was responsive and very easy to communicate with, explaining the ins and outs and giving us some tips. As goofy as it sounds,  I really loved the keyless door lock to the unit. "
2154617,45580002,2015-09-04,40006346,Jan Tadeusz,"Der Name ist Programm. Nach 10 Stunden Flug von Frankfurt sind wir bei Nick tatsächlich mittendrin in Seattle gelandet. Es gibt so viel zu sehen und zu erleben direkt vor der Haustür. Dieses gemütliche Studio war für uns ein ideales Refugium in der Stadt. Danke Nick, wir kommen sehr gern wieder!"

Nick helped us find the building upon our arrival and explained everything we needed to know about parking, the building amenities, and features in the unit. The apartment was very clean and well stocked with supplies. Nick was a friendly host and we enjoyed chatting for a few minutes before getting settled. Overall great location - easily walkable to sights and central locations. We would stay here again on a future visit."

Clean apartment with everything you need, and just a short walk to all of the major touristy things (Pike Place, Space Needle & Chihuly Glass). Thanks Nick!"
2154617,47467483,2015-09-19,36994827,David,"A wonderful experience all around. The apartment is a studio in the heart of Belltown, within walking distance of bus routes and Seattle landmarks. Nick has furnished the apartment with everything that you'll need to feel at home in Seattle, which is the kind of unique experience that you won't get by staying in a hotel. "
2154617,47754244,2015-09-21,13874799,Sanaz,"Phenomenal location, great host who is incredibly flexible with check-in times, and a clean apartment. There's really nothing else I could have asked for during my short trip to Seattle. "
2154617,48174837,2015-09-24,13079043,Jamie,Nick was great. I highly recommend this location if you want to walk everywhere in  Seattle. All linens were clean.
2154617,48394162,2015-09-26,34536678,Tom,Nick was a great host and the place was in a perfect location for first time visitors to Seattle. There were so many great places to eat in a two block radium... wow..
2154617,48880709,2015-09-29,39464840,Phyllis,"We had a great time at Nick's place...everything was as promised!  Loved our time in Seattle and the location was perfect for getting out in all directions.  We loved checking out the view of the Space Needle every night when we closed up the door.  Also, the rooftop spot was cool for looking out at the bay and harbor area. Well appointed and the decorating was very fun...our 25 year old daughter was in love with the place-she wants to move in!  It has a really nice, secure feeling too, our first Airbnb experience was great!"
2154617,49059061,2015-09-30,40228870,Brett,"Nick was a great host. Met me at the designated time and place. When there was a problem with our key fob he met us within minutes to provide a replacement. The apartment was great. Plenty of room, nice view, comfy bed, nice bathroom and everything was clean. The location is excellent, close to the water and everything downtown. I would definitely stay here again."
2154617,49153093,2015-10-01,38281294,Lindsey,"We had a great experience! The whole process was really easy, and Nick was helpful with all our questions. This spot is in a great location, within walking distance to a lot and a really short drive to all the main happenings in the area. "
2154617,49214835,2015-10-02,24917654,Michael,"Nick is a fantastic host.  He was extremely accommodating and made the check-in process simple and easy.  The studio itself is great.  As previous reviews mention, it is more like a one bedroom than a studio, with plenty of space to relax and spread out.  The apartment is extremely clean and in close proximity to a number of Seattle's more noteworthy attractions.  I'd recommend Nick's place to anyone visiting Seattle. "
2154617,49347720,2015-10-03,28478422,Michael,"Nick's place was as expected.  Great location, easy walk to many sights.  Communication with Nick was simple.  Would recommend. "

2154617,50533137,2015-10-12,19349444,Winston,"Nicks place is the prime spot to be when visiting downtown Seattle. Not only is everything a short walk away, the view outside is balcony is amazing. His place was spotless clean. We had a great time there. He was even reasonable when we accidently over slept. 

"
2154617,50804907,2015-10-14,12009127,Tammy,"The location was ideal!  And the neighborhood had many restaurants and shops at your fingertips.
My mom and I loved our stay in Seattle.
"
2154617,51138427,2015-10-18,12895909,Celena,Nick was wonderful! He welcomed us into the neighborhood by not only giving us the details of the space but also of Seattle. The apartment was the perfect location and walkable to the main sights to see in Seattle. Thank you Nick for being such a great host!
2154617,51446257,2015-10-20,23300202,Sean,"Nick's place was all that we'd hoped for: clean, spacious, comfortable, and in a great part of town. The building is safe and secure. Nick's instructions and coordination with us was also commendable. He made things easy for us and helped accommodate a late arrival with no stress. Would recommend! "
2154617,51544197,2015-10-21,34487181,Lauren,Nick was amazing. He was quick in answering my texts and the place was immaculate. Also it was in such a good area with easy access to everything.

2154617,52383240,2015-10-28,33523260,Mark,Nick was great and his place was awesome. He was very responsive the whole time. The apartment is in a good location in Belltown with a beautiful view of the space needle. Highly recommend 
2154617,53795866,2015-11-12,144705,Deanna,"Nick's place was absolutely PERFECT-- I made a last minute trip to see some friends in town, and could not have asked for a better place to crash. Convenient, safe, very very clean, very comfortable. Nick was easy to reach and is clearly a very kind human. Highly recommended."

I was running a little late  getting into Seattle, however Nick made it easy for me to receive the key and he promptly answered all my questions. If in Seattle for a few days I recommend this downtown studio location. "

2154617,55956157,2015-12-07,37328406,Gavin,"Nick was awesome. His place is literally in the perfect location with an awesome view. You're a five minute Uber from anywhere you would want to go, and walking distance from the pike st market and space needle. Nick gave us everything we needed and was very available and I highly recommend staying there. It was perfect."
2154617,56825901,2015-12-18,559283,Mathieu,The usual airbnb experience :)
8212190,47137930,2015-09-15,34991724,Megan,The host canceled this reservation 38 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
8212190,49503207,2015-10-04,1762473,Nia,The house was adorable & the perfect setting for a girls night. It was comfy & we had a great time. Sabrina answered my questions quickly & was very accommodating. She even left a birthday greeting on the door for my sister. We would definitely stay here again.
8212190,52782367,2015-11-01,26923849,Jisun,Wonderful house and wonderful host!  Sabrina was very responsive and made the stay very enjoyable !
8212190,54110140,2015-11-16,26870299,Jesse,It was a great place and Sabrina was extremely kind and easy to deal with. Would love to stay again. Seahawks lost so that was a bummer. 
8212190,54590203,2015-11-22,45462987,Denise,"Great location, very easy to find. The house is very warm and welcoming and we enjoyed our stay."
8212190,56490161,2015-12-14,45317745,Ruby,My daughter and I were welcomed with a bottle of wine and lovely note to start off our Mother/Daughter weekend. The house was perfect for our stay. Ballard has great restaurants and the house is close to downtown. We were delighted with this property! 
8212190,57527640,2015-12-27,47292571,Alissa,"We had a great experience at Sabrina's home. It fit our family nicely! She had a lot to offer in the kitchen, in terms of utensils and cookware. Very cute and homey! "
6077760,32143058,2015-05-14,27478700,Daniel Brooks,Great place. Great people. Great experience!
6077760,32788534,2015-05-21,27478700,Daniel Brooks,"The condo is beautiful and very well decorated! Alex was great to work with and was gracious enough to invite me to meet out with some of his friends. The neighborhood is also very cool (a lot of great restaurants small and large). If you stay here you'll be very close to all major Seattle attractions, and you'll get to experience great views in peace and quite. "
6077760,33543542,2015-05-29,27478700,Daniel Brooks,What a great stay! ...couldn't have asked for better host.
6077760,34166349,2015-06-05,27478700,Daniel Brooks,Alex was a great host! Thanks for sharing your home with me.
6077760,35940702,2015-06-23,24963437,Natasha,"Alex was an exceptional host. He was available to answer questions and give recommendations but gave us privacy, too. 

His house with modern decor is stunning. We enjoyed cooking in the kitchen and eating on both our private patio over looking the street and the rooftop deck with views of the cityscape and mountains. If you're a foodie, you'll gush over his cookbook collection! Our room and attached private bathroom are tastefully decorated. The bed and linens are very comfortable!! 

The street is pretty quiet but if you are a light sleeper, consider bringing earplugs or using a sound machine app.

We spent multiple days exploring Queen Anne and the adjacent neighborhoods of Freemont and Ballard. We're pretty critical of restaurants but every place we tried was unique and the food was well executed. Most of the coffee was so-so (surprisingly!) but pastries from the many bakeries were delicious.

If you're staying for more than one day, buy an Orca card and be sure to put enough money on it for your whole visit. There are multiple bus lines on both roads that run parellel to the road the house is on.

If you enjoy sushi, please go to Shiro's. Shout outs to Ballard Coffee Co and El Barracho for tacos and creative twists on margaritas in Ballard. We took a bus past Ballard to a park with a beach; it was a highlight of our trip.

Exploring Seattle made for an exciting visit but Alex made our stay feel like we were home."
6077760,36703900,2015-06-30,35038675,Brad,"I cannot recommend Alex's place enough.  Great location, great amenities...we had everything we needed for an awesome weekend in Seattle.  Alex stayed up later than normal on a weeknight to welcome us and provided some recommendations for restaurants and things to check out.  I'd definitely stay here again!"
6077760,37076444,2015-07-04,33069244,Lai,"Alex&Alexa's apartment is amazing! It is close to everywhere ($5-10 driving if you use uber or lift). They have a perfect kitchen and have everything you could imagine in the kitchen. They also have a wonderful bedroom for us to stay: private, clean, comfortable and cozy. And they are really nice and helping. Alexa shared her recipes with us and recommend restaurants, even one in New York lol. You will love this apartment. "
6077760,38756896,2015-07-18,12191038,Ivan,Alex's place was exactly as described on the listing page if not better. The room was clean and comfortable. The quality of this room is a lot better than your average room at a hotel. The view from the room and the patio on the roof are amazing. The neighborhood was safe. I was easily able to walk to the Space Needle and Pike Place Market. Their was ample parking on the street for my car.  Alex was easy to communicate with before our arrival and during our stay. I would not hesitate to stay here again for the next time I visit Seattle. 
6077760,40335447,2015-07-30,34304449,Janis,"My husband and I stayed here for a full week while we were visiting Seattle. The entire house is gorgeous: modern, clean, open and has great views. The set up is nice because the room is in its own area of the house- you don't have to go in the main living area if you don't want to or prefer privacy. We ate out for pretty much every meal so we didn't cook during our stay though it would've been a great kitchen to utilize! My favorite part of the home was the rooftop- great view! I also enjoyed waking up to the sunrise every morning and having large windows and a private patio to appreciate the view.

The neighborhood was mostly residential and generally quiet. We used Lyft to get downtown, especially coming back since it was all uphill! We also had a car for most of our stay that we used to get to the outer neighborhoods, parks, hiking trails, etc. and never had a problem finding a spot on the street. It's definitely cramped, but we were always able to find at least one spot without a problem. 

Alex and Alexa were both friendly and welcoming. We were all quite busy so we didn't cross paths too often, but when we did it was nice to chat. We got several great tips on where to eat and what to do from Alex. We enjoyed our stay! "
6077760,40777028,2015-08-02,36179873,Michael,"Absolutely lovely home in every aspect. Great location, view, comfortable, and tastefully decorated. The room has a private terrace too! Alex and Alexa are a lovely couple who made us feel right at home. This is an excellent Air B&B find in Seattle. Thank you Alex and Alexa for making the beginning of our vacation so great! :-) "
6077760,41935770,2015-08-10,31254710,Tylor,"Alex was awesome! Great guy with a great home and was very welcoming to us. We didn't get to see him much because of our own plans but he was a great guy to chat with when we could and he knew a lot about the area and things to do near where we were going. The area was also nice and only a few minutes drive from KeyArena where we were going, so it was easy to get back and forth. Highly recommended!"
6077760,42854203,2015-08-16,591227,Julie,Alex was an awesome host.  He was there to greet us upon our arrival with freshly cleaned linens and ice cold beverages. His home is spectacular! The view from our bedroom and rooftop patio is amazing! The kitchen is fully equipped for every type of cook. The location was perfect for getting to and from all the great neighborhoods of Seattle. We will definitely stay at Alex's place again the next time we visit Seattle.
6077760,43563286,2015-08-20,41088405,Julia,"Our stay was perfect. Alex is very friendly and responsive. The apartment is a short drive from the city center and we were able to find street parking close to the apartment. The room has its own patio and bathroom, and Alex let us use his roof, which has amazing views of Seattle at night. There was construction going on outside during our stay, but the noise wasn't too bad."
6077760,43797830,2015-08-22,38500399,Helen,"Thanks for making the beginning of our vacation a pleasant one.  Alex and Alexa were very accommodating. The room is modern and clean.

"
6077760,44306440,2015-08-25,19224182,Rebecca,"Wonderful apartment in a good location in Seattle - really enjoyed our stay.  Due to full east-facing windows, remember to bring an eye mask - the sunrise was amazing but it's also good to get a lie in!"
6077760,44781392,2015-08-29,378465,Chad,"Staying at Alex's was very pleasant, and I can confirm that the view from the patio is amazing. I would totally stay here again next time I find myself with a reason to visit Seattle."
6077760,45385270,2015-09-02,9148999,Elizabeth,"Alex and Alexa's place in Seattle is beautiful. The room is very private and comfortable.  The neighborhood is in a good location. There is a wonderful view of Lake Union from the apartment.

Also, Alex and Alexa left us wine and beer in the room, which was a nice touch! They were also helpful with restaurant recommendations.

We had a great time! We would totally recommend this place to others."
6077760,45815321,2015-09-06,6492705,Jeff,Extremely welcoming and friendly host! Treated us like old friends. Did everything he could to make our experience convenient and comfortable. The room was INCREDIBLE. Beautiful views right from the (very comfortable and clean) bed. Amazing view of the sun rising over the clouds each morning. Really every aspect of the experience was perfect and I hope I get a chance to stay with Alex again!
6077760,47165544,2015-09-16,19536185,Jeffrey,Alex's place was amazing! Just barely far enough out of the congestion of the city but close enough that we frequently walked to breakfast in the Fremont area or walked back from downtown after a day of enjoying the city. Very private room with a nice balcony and access to the roof deck with awesome views of Seattle. We didn't use the common spaces but loved the decor. Alex had great suggestions for our stay. I would not hesitate to recommend Alex's place. 
6077760,47718936,2015-09-21,41314475,Dmitriy,"All previously written reviews are spot on. Hosts are very accommodating and knowledgeable, location is convenient for city exploration."
6077760,48391740,2015-09-26,1784235,Michael,Firstly the room is fantastic.  The neighbourhood is clean and feels very safe. I walked misty in and out of downtown from here.  I enjoyed my stay. The only negative is that the sun rising in a morning shines right in the room through the privacy blinds. 
6077760,49326715,2015-10-03,21220147,Christoph,"We loved staying with Alexa and Alex. Their apartment is very tasteful and conveniently located. They gave us great tips for eating out and made our stay very easy. I can highly recommend staying with them as you can reach downtown, Fremont and Ballard easily by bus and car. The room gives you all the privacy you can wish for and a great bed for a good night's sleep. Would definitely stay there again."
6077760,51931374,2015-10-25,6899198,Anna & Nate,Hands down the best Airbnb in Seattle.  Alex and Alexa rock!
3953611,18639316,2014-08-29,12166209,Jorge,"We really enjoyed our stay with Karen, she and her husband were amazing hosts!

The suite was immaculate, the kitchen had tea, fruits, coffee and cereals. I personally think that the suite looks even better in person. It is very well spaced.

Karen also shares all her knowledge in an excellent summary with her own input (huge plus). She also provided us with lots of guides, articles and ferry timetables (among others). She is very happy to share her personal recommendations for sightseeing, dinner spots and other plans.

Also, the house is close to Downtown and Pike Pine (where most nightlife is). The neighborhood is beautiful and quiet without being too isolated.

We will definitely go back to her place if we are ever in town again!"
3953611,18851001,2014-09-01,6258726,Elliott,"Karen stayed in constant communication with us a few days prior to arrival and let us know exactly when she would be home so she could greet us there. She and her husband Dan welcomed us into their home and made us feel like welcome guests for the entire 3+ days we were there. They have a beautiful home and the entire lower floor is yours, with private bathroom, mini kitchen, a den and a very comfortable bed in the bedroom. We couldn't have asked for a nicer and more convenient place to stay for our trip to Seattle."
3953611,19099760,2014-09-06,20533810,Ronny,"Amazing host, convenient location and great rooms."
3953611,19248135,2014-09-08,9794054,Barbara,"A five star rating is not enough to represent our Airbnb experience in Karen and Dan’s home. Karen communicated quickly and arrangements were made with ease. Karen and Dan were delightful, warm and welcoming hosts, making sure we were comfortable and knew our way around town. The space has the feel of a high quality hotel suite, yet has a warm home-like experience. Included was our own bedroom, private bath, a small living room and kitchenette. Each room was clean and above average in quality and design. The bed was REALLY comfortable. Karen and Dan provided delicious fruit, cereal, yogurt and coffee for the morning. It was so nice to be able to have our own private space. Amazing price for what you get here. We’re so glad we got to meet Karen and Dan and have the privilege of staying in their beautiful home!"
3953611,20102500,2014-09-23,10110416,Carrie,Karen was a fantastic host. She gave us lots of ideas for places to go / see. 
3953611,21393384,2014-10-16,21819217,Beth,"Wonderful hosts, beautiful home, great location . . . . .
Karen and Dan were welcoming, friendly and very helpful.  The suite was spacious, nicely decorated,  well equipped, and very clean.  Their home is located in an urban neighborhood where it is easy to walk to shops, restaurants, Lake Washington and to public transit.  We were there for a week and would definitely stay there again."
3953611,22558592,2014-11-09,23194514,Jack,"We just loved our stay with Dan and Karen.  I am usually apprehensive about staying in occupied homes because I don't like to encroach on people's space, but I have to say I have rarely felt as welcome and at home as I have during this stay. 

The suite is on a separate level and totally self contained. It does not have it's own direct entry from the exterior, but Karen will code the front door lock with your own code so you have 24/7 access at your convenience. For the late night crowd, this is a great feature. We have two small kids and a late night for us therefore is 8 pm, so this wasn't even a consideration for us, but it is a nice feature in an occupied home. 

The home is lovely and immaculate. I am a Construction Manager so am instantly drawn to the quality of places I stay, and this home is very, very well done. Everything is well built, well decorated, and well maintained.  The suite is spacious, clean, cozy, and very comfortable. The bed was even more comfortable than my own bed at home.

The neighborhood is in a perfect location to explore Seattle and the surrounding area.... Just north of downtown and away from most of the huge traffic issues that you seem to plague the southern outskirts of the city. Easy access to downtown, but also has it's own nice little main street. We enjoyed exploring the neighborhood as much as exploring the city itself.  

Dan and Karen were very gracious hosts, and made us all feel very welcome. They even provided a list of things to do and see around town, which is always a huge plus when you are in a new city. We had an all around great experience and would definitely stay here again.
"
3953611,22854144,2014-11-16,23166319,ELiza,"Karen is a warm and welcoming hostess. She was very attentive to communicating with us before and after our stay. She provided a well thought out written summary of very local and general Seattle attractions and checked in with us often, but not too often. ""Our"" area was private, spacious and meticulously clean. And in Seattle we were thrilled to have a very quiet room in a quiet neighborhood."
3953611,23412801,2014-11-30,18695682,Shanleigh,"Karen is a wonderful hostess. The living area, bedroom, and bath are very well maintained, clean,  and comfortable. Karen is very helpful about local sites and getting around the city. The house is located in a quiet residential area, but just around the corner from a bus stop that takes you downtown, so it’s easy to get around without a car if you don’t have one. I enjoyed my stay very much. "
3953611,24065983,2014-12-18,24798840,Meri,"Karen and Dan are wonderful hosts. The suite is lovely and had everything my sister and I needed for a relaxing stay. The location is excellent. It was a great base for visiting family and friends, walking distance to Lake Washington and the cute Madrona neighborhood and a short hop to Capitol Hill, the U district and downtown. We look forward to visiting again!"
3953611,25030639,2015-01-05,4400925,William,"Karen and her family were very warm and welcoming. She had compiled a lot of resources for exploring the city. They made an effort to include us in their New Years party. Over all, very hospitable. 

Accommodations themselves were excellent! They had provided us a little food for breakfast and we were easily able to find space for our little family of four. Quite frankly, after visiting family in Portland, having this comfortable and private Shangri-la to stay in was a welcome change. We would definitely stay there again. "
3953611,26315674,2015-02-09,16818891,Aaron,"Excellent accommodations. Very comfortable. Host was very responsive. Location is also great, with easy access to Lake Washington, Madrona/Madison restaurants, and the Arboretum. Highly recommended. "
3953611,26752121,2015-02-18,7730805,Stephanie,"Karen and her husband were extremely warm and welcoming.  Staying in their private suite was like having a suite in a hotel.  Very spacious - very clean... great tv with all the channels....

"
3953611,27177340,2015-02-27,27648857,Jessica,"Karen and her family provided a wonderful place to stay for my parents while I was relocating that was so much better than a standard hotel.  The unit is exactly as advertised, very clean and cozy.  My parents greatly enjoyed the peace and quiet, as well as the proximity to Madrona's cute shops and restaurants, Lake Washington, and downtown Seattle.  The neighborhood and home are both gorgeous.  Highly recommended!"
3953611,27979036,2015-03-15,27564913,Jordan,"Staying here was an absolute dream....the pictures on the listing do not do justice for this beautiful suite! Every furnishing was beautiful and thoughtful. The space was very roomy and comfortable. Karen and her husband were the most incredible hosts - so friendly, accomodating, and helpful. Their home is absolutely beautiful and I look forward to my next visit!"
3953611,28500769,2015-03-24,29484590,Douglas,"This was a wonderful place to stay - clean and comfortable.  The beds were also very comfortable.  They had many good tourist ideas. Karen was great and went above and beyond.    They even did a load of laundry for us and also allowed us to keep our things at the house while we were out and about on the day we checked out.  The neighborhood is nice and quiet, and only about a 15 minute drive to downtown (assuming you miss the worst of traffic).  We highly recommend it.  We would definitely try to stay here if/when we get to Seattle again.  "
3953611,28690322,2015-03-28,15982303,Jasmin,"Beautiful neighborhood, amazing and attentive host.  We really enjoyed the stay. The space was very clean and very comfortable, my teens didn't even miss having a pool they enjoyed the relaxing space very much. "
3953611,28826598,2015-03-30,23223645,Sue,"This is a charming, private suite - very large and very comfortable.  In a wonderful, walking neighborhood.  Bedroom & suite are lovely and comfortable.  Hosts are the icing on the cake!  Well worth the price!"
3953611,29057159,2015-04-03,6542579,Crystal,"This suite was so cozy and comfortable to stay in, and Karen is an excellent hostess. I was in Seattle for work. Just one night, but I got a great night's sleep. The neighborhood is lovely, with lots of Spring flowers in bloom! I was also able to get some work done with a super-fast wifi connection. I definitely recommend this place!"
3953611,30748177,2015-04-26,21064166,Alexa,"Staying with Karen was the smoothest weekend trip I've ever tried to organize. There was an extremely long encounter at the border which put our trip back a few hours and when we arrived she greeted us with a glasses of white wine and snacks. It was extremely relaxing considering the shaky start to our trip. Karen's home was extremely well kept, and the suite 2 of my friends and I stayed in was equally as well kept with style and a sense of home. Clean towels, milk and cream for coffee, and great wifi made for a nice one night stay! Would definitely stay there again!"
3953611,32125506,2015-05-14,28101635,Kay,"This stay was so perfect. Karen and family have been so warm and welcoming. The suite is very comfortable and beautifully appointed. The great bed made this stay even more comfortable. The neighborhood is close to buses and Karen has gone out of her way to make sure I had everything I needed. I would highly recommend this city oasis, and definitely stay here again when in Seattle. Thanks, Karen."
3953611,32990652,2015-05-24,31291837,Sherry,"Karen is the perfect host.  The space is extremely large, comfortable, and stylish.  Karen has thought of everything.  She puts out numerous cereals, milk, cream, fruit, speciality yogurt, coffees and tea.  The Madrona neighborhood is charming and convenient with excellent restaurants.  I would live in Karen's space if I could!"
3953611,33403840,2015-05-27,2552926,Matthew And Jodi,"Beautiful Home, beautiful Suite with all the nice touches of a Bed and Breakfast.  Karens Niece was there to greet me.   Exceptionally clean and nicely decorated."
3953611,33739717,2015-05-31,26733056,Rick,"Karen made arriving easy despite not being there as we arrived early.  The space is indeed large and luxurious, it was spotlessly clean and Karen provided many supplies including lovely yogurt. It is also a basement so there is not much natural light although the front porch is available to sit out on.  The area in Seattle is spectacular and is convenient for some good local restaurants. Karen was helpful and business like and gave us good suggestions about things to see.  Recommended.   "
3953611,34077530,2015-06-04,32988167,Sarah,"The suite was beautiful and Karen was a lovely host! This convenient and comfortable home, complete with thoughtful accommodations made for a truly luxurious experience. The neighborhood is fantastic for walking around and enjoying the scenery, and Karen offers many thorough tips for a great trip."
3953611,34946852,2015-06-14,28000842,Shelley,"Wonderful stay, our hosts Karen and Dan were gracious and very accommodating. The one bedroom suite was perfect for the 3 of us, plenty of room, beautifully appointed, comfortable beds, luxury linens,  and the best homemade yogurt I've ever tasted. The home is in a quiet area of Madrona, close to downtown with easy access to both the 520 and I90 and the delightful Madison Park and Madrona. We've already booked our next stay!"
3953611,35399217,2015-06-18,32908124,Prerna,Hostess Karen is very friendly. Accommodation is well furnished and equipped with all amenities. It's slightly away from main strip but with car commuting is no problem. We used uber taxi extensively. Very prompt and convenient..
3953611,35806954,2015-06-22,32976852,William,"The listing was accurate and the hosts had thought of all things anybody would need.
They had left detailed info about restaurants etc. around the neighborhood. 
We stayed for four nights with 5 adult people there was enough room for the extra bed. 
The bedroom is private from the living/kitchen space.
Karen was very helpful and we had a pleasant stay.
Everything was very clean and luxurious.
Minus points:
The apartment is not so good if you have trouble walking stairs. 
Their home is on a quiet narrow street and we had to park our  Suburban around the corner in the side street."
3953611,36280029,2015-06-27,31864323,Sarah,"The rooms are beautiful and nicely decorated. It is almost a 2 bed rooms with a small dining area. Perfect for one family!  Karen and their family did their best !  

Only thing I did not aware was  the room are in basement and entrance is from main door through the host' main house. Small windows on bedroom. If you don't mind basement room, overall it is nice for the price."
3953611,36679823,2015-06-30,21342723,Michael,"We like Karen's house very much, especially we can take bus (Line NO. 2) to downtown, very convenience.  Karen and her husband and daughter are very kind to us, always give us the best tips how to travel around the city. I do recommend people who will plan at least 2 nights in Seattle to purchase city-pass, you can go to 4 different most famous spots and price will be 60% off. Also you must take harbour cruise to see the bay of Seattle, very very impressive.  We will definitely live in Karen's house again if we have a chance to visit Seattle in the future. "
3953611,36884905,2015-07-02,3803035,Bryan,"Karen was a great host.  She was very accommodating on our arrival time.  The suite was very clean and easily fit myself, my wife and my 2 kids.  The kitchenette was perfect some quick breakfasts before heading out into downtown.

It is located right next to the #2 bus and was easy to catch into the center of Seattle.  We also used Uber a couple times to get back when the kids were tired (only about $6-8 and easy to use).

The entrance is through the main house, but the suite is very private and comfortable. I would definitely recommend this to people wanting to stay near downtown."
3953611,37045654,2015-07-04,25619877,Jaeeun,"This place is very comfortable and very clean. You don't need to worry about any distractions, it's totally independent place from others! For facilities, I think the actual condition is a way better than the pictures described, everything's available here! What I liked most about this place was surrounding of this area. There are so many beautiful houses around Karen's house, (absolutely including Karen's house ;) ), and if you go out like 2 blocks away , you can see a beautiful scenery along the lake. 
And as to transportation, we had a rental car, and we were very easily go to the main strip. I remember that the 1st St. is the Pike Public Market, and Karen's house is near 32th? 33th? St. you just can go through all the way  without any traffics, and you also enjoy more detalis of Seattle during commuting.
Karen and her family was really great to us before and during our staying. 
I absolutely want to recommend this place if you plan to travel in Seattle, Karen's place will make you be able to enjoy and feel more comfortable and peaceful Seattle!"
3953611,37750685,2015-07-10,31217301,Pinida,"We had a really great stay at Karen's place. She reached out with advice both about seattle and other things I was interested in. Karen wasn't there when we stayed but her husband and daughter were friendly and helpful. The place is the basement of their house, which is cool in the summer. It is carpeted and has a fireplace. It was clean and nicely decorated with everything we needed. The house is in a beautiful neighbourhood on a hill. It is a little out of the way but there's a bus stop just down the road. The local area, madrona, is small but has 3-4 places to eat, a yummy ice cream store, a minimal supermarket, is downhill about two bus stops away. Downtown is onebusaway - takes about 30 mins."
3953611,37978558,2015-07-12,33065422,Conor,"Beautiful space in a great neighborhood. The hosts really went above and beyond, from letting us do laundry, to helping with our camping equipment, to sharing their beer with us on their lovely front porch. Couldn't recommend this place more highly."
3953611,38704791,2015-07-18,4294315,David,"the place is very convenient,I forgot my driver's license in the home,so I have to take bus during I stayed in Dan and Karen's house,the room was clean and we have a sparate floor.also Dan is a easy going man.He told me and even led me to the restaurant nearby his house on the first day.thanks for your help.we will come back again."
3953611,39604064,2015-07-25,28000842,Shelley,"This was our second stay with Karen and it was like coming home. We were there for a week and our family of three couldn't have been more comfortable. Spotlessly clean and well appointed, this is our go to in Seattle. Daughter Carolyn even helped us out with a load of wash. "
3953611,39763731,2015-07-26,34144060,Chris,The listing was accurate. It's a comfy home and the family was very welcoming.
3953611,41006165,2015-08-03,39203447,Roberto,"We had a wonderful time in Seattle. Staying at Karen and Dan's place played an important role in the great success of our trip. The place is very clean, comfortable and cosy. Both Karen and Dan are perfect hosts, thoughtful and caring, and will help you with anything you need, including great advice on places to go and things to do. The neighbourhood is quiet safe and beautiful, with nice restaurants and cafés nearby, as well as very conveniently located. The nearest number 2 bus stop is a couple of minutes away on foot and it connects Madrona with the main downtown spots in a short time. It is also a short and cheap taxi ride away. We definitely recommend it!"
3953611,41467648,2015-08-07,39389806,Christina,"My experience was so pleasant. I had the most welcoming room filled with food, refreshments, and a SUPER comfy bed!! My brother stayed in the pull out couch and said it was comfortable also! 

Karen is a great host. Anything I needed or asked for was provided. I miss her house already! It's so cozy and nice. I want to return very soon and will definitely be checking with Karen's availability first! Loved my experience and highly recommended this home for your next stay. "
3953611,41470221,2015-08-07,39045493,Melony,"Wow! What a beautiful home and gorgeous neighborhood! 

We weren't able to meet Karen, due to a business trip, but she had a team of family members lined-up to host and answer any questions we  had.  Additionally, her communication was very clear about the changes and she provided phone numbers for each person on the ""team"" in case we needed to get in touch.  

The suite itself is gorgeous, very comfortable and private and immaculately clean. The bed was extremely comfortable!!  Everything that we may have needed was provided (including wine glasses) and the breakfast of granola, coffee, fresh juicy peaches, and the most amazing greek yoghurt I've ever had was wonderful and greatly appreciated! 

We took the opportunity to explore Madrona a bit and was delighted with its charm.  We enjoyed a walk to Madrona centre for an amazing dinner at St. Cloud's, were treated to an impromptu African percussion concert in Madrona playground, walked down to Lake Washington, through Madrona Park, which was lovely, and enjoyed looking at the spectacular and unique homes in the neighborhood. On the way back, we stopped for decadent ice cream at Molly Moon's.  A lovely evening.

A few other things that we really appreciated was the information about Seattle and some of the neighborhoods that Karen emailed us; this helped us get a feel for some of the things that we wanted to explore and we were able to access the information on our phones while we were out and about. We loved the personalized entry code, which made it easy to come and go. And also, the information basket and books about Seattle in the suite were very helpful as well. 

We loved our stay! Thanks Karen (and Dan)!  "
3953611,41839860,2015-08-09,17413939,Emily,"Our stay was wonderful! They truly thought of everything. From the yummy yogurt and gluten free granola, to the walking maps of Seattle, we felt so comfortable and relaxed. The location is perfect for the person who wants to experience downtown and capital hill but wants to retreat after a fun evening to peace and quiet. "
3953611,42381487,2015-08-13,5906489,Mimi,"It was absolutely wonderful experience staying at Karen's beautiful house. I took my parents , they came visit me from Japan, to Seattle from California where I live. Karen was great communicator and had all information we needed from checking in to checking out. We arrived late at night due to Amtrak train  delay. Karen and her family gave us prompt and informative advice. We only stay one night but we wish we could stay longer. I highly recommend Karen's house to other Airbnb guests! 
Thank you, Karen :  ) "
3953611,43060473,2015-08-17,14654092,Simon,"A lovely Seattle suite, exactly as described. We couldn't be happier with the accommodations. It felt like home moments after checking in. The location is perfect and Karen is a wonderful host. She is very knowledgeable about the city and surrounds and has plenty of books, brochures, guides and maps to help you get the most out of your stay. "
3953611,43368509,2015-08-19,32988167,Sarah,"Another lovely visit to Seattle! Karen is a perfect, friendly host, making our stay convenient and comfortable."
3953611,43890048,2015-08-22,1251912,Brittany,"I made a last minute reservation for my in-laws to stay at Karen's apartment. It is just down the street from our house, so I can attest the neighborhood is quiet and has great coffee shops, yoga studios, restaurants, and more. My in-laws raved about how cute and clean the apartment was and how kind and lovely it was to meet Karen. She made their stay cozy and welcoming with breakfast treats and coffee and they would love to stay again sometime. I'm just bummed I didn't get to see the cute place myself!!"
3953611,44610209,2015-08-27,7662764,Villads,"Karen is a warm and welcoming host. The suite is in the basement of their very new house. Has everything you need: living room, small kitchen, double sink bathroom and a big bedroom.

The area is well connected with the #2 bus to downtown. Uber is recommended also though. Neighbourhood is very pretty and quiet. 

Very easy living at Karen's place. Recommended. "
3953611,44898148,2015-08-30,14407512,Alex,"Karen was an excellent hostess. My friends and I planned a short stay at her cozy place. Unfortunately, on our end there were several changes and cancellations. Karen was flexible and helpful throughout the whole experience, which definitely lessened the stress of planning a group trip. 

Those who were able to go found Karen and her home warm and hospitable, exactly what was needed for a busy weekend!"
3953611,45441285,2015-09-02,6390319,Toni,"Karen't accommodations were state-of-the-art perfect. I've never seen such a clean spot. Even the bath mat was something I'd wrap myself up in for comfort. And the breakfast goodies to start off the day were much appreciated.
Karen was happy to help with directions and suggestions of things to do. She even printed out maps for us. She is an excellent host.
Nice kitchen sink, soap, sponge, frig, coffee pot, etc. area all there and I was surprised to see there is nowhere to actually cook, but that must have been a complete oversight on my part. It was like staying in a very nice - and expensive - hotel suite!
"
3953611,46919273,2015-09-14,27859816,Janet,"My friends, Sheila, Tina, and I spent four nights at this lovely and welcoming home!  The lodging was most comfortable and homey. Karen's extras such as granola, yogurt and expert advice regarding places to go and eat made this an Excellent and wonderful place to stay! We most wholeheartedly recommend this superb location and stupendous hostess!  The neighborhood is nice and very convenient to Seattle Center.  We would definitely stay with Karen again.  Thanks again for hosting us in your home!!"
3953611,47376057,2015-09-18,27859816,Janet,"Staying at Karen's home was one of the best decisions we made via Airbnb.  We traveled to Seattle from Charlotte NC and visited Mt. Rainier and Olympic National Parks.  While there, we stayed twice in one week at Karen's apartment; we were comfortable in Seattle without any hassles (except for traffic) and that is thanks to Karen.  We highly recommend this location."
3953611,47646347,2015-09-21,12923876,Lee,Karen was very welcoming and we had no problem finding the house.  It is in a lovely old Seattle neighborhood.  The suite was as described.
3953611,48516762,2015-09-27,11603713,Susan,"This place had it all: great location in a quiet neighborhood, spaciousness and privacy, and it was spotlessly clean. We will definitely be back for another stay in this beautiful Seattle home!
Our hosts didn't miss a single step in thinking of every comfort, and were especially thoughtful in providing breakfast and snacks. In fact, coming in on our first evening, we were gifted with a fresh, warm loaf of banana bread (with butter!). Thank you Karen and Dan!  "
3953611,49000094,2015-09-30,38507697,Valerie,"I cannot even begin to explain how accommodating Karen and Dan were. She had everything you could ever need when staying away from home. Karen had new suggestions for activities everyday that we stayed there, and it was extremely helpful in planning our stay. I have never slept so well away from my own bed as I did the nights we stayed at this location. I will definitely be staying here on my next trip to Seattle if it is available!"
7952930,44073097,2015-08-23,41951247,Jeremiah,"Space worked out great for our family.  We were a couple with kids and the extra space vs a hotel was welcome.  Place was clean and well appointed. Nice kitchen with full fridge, stove, microwave, coffee maker, etc. They left out coffee and cookies for us which was nice touch.  Living room with couch with TV with Netflix and table with 4 chairs. Carpet is not perfect, but overall place was clean.  There is toys on the shelves for kids to play with which was nice for us.

Bed was comfortable and clean. They set up inflatable mattress and porta-crib for our kids which was great. 

Bathroom was clean and towels were nice and soft.

Location is quiet on side street with designated off street gravel parking space.  Short walk down side of house to back yard.  Back yard was nice with a swing, kid's playhouse, and patio furniture. 

Two potential negatives:
1.  Walk down to back yard could be a problem for someone who is mobility challenged.  Not an issue for us, but if this is a concern for you probably not the best location.

2. There is some musty smell.  It is a basement apartment in Seattle, so this is to be expected, but if you are sensitive to this it could be a problem.  We opened windows and it was less noticeable each day.

Besides that, we enjoyed our stay.  Location is nice and quiet and close to I-5 which let's you get around town quickly.  Family lives upstairs, but is quiet and respectful."
7952930,45324978,2015-09-01,5884533,John,"Megan was a great host, very pleasant and communicative! The house is in a great location, if you are headed into Downtown Seattle in the mornings and back in the evenings this is a perfect spot to catch the express lanes. It took us about 10 minutes to get to the WSCC during 8AM traffic!
The ceilings are a bit low for anyone over 6'1"", I'm 6'3"" and my head brushed the ceiling in a few places. but other than that it is a nice place to rest after a long day at a convention.

They were very accommodating on our arrival time, and during our stay provided communication that the weather had knocked out the power and updates as to when it came back on.

We would definitely stay again if our paths headed that direction again!"
7952930,45541932,2015-09-03,17172601,Lacy,"The actual experience was better than expected. The space is quite large, easy to find, and private. There is easy parking too, which is rare in Seattle. Being able to have dogs is  major bonus. The yard is a nice size, fully fenced, and my dog was happy to meander about. Megan's place is a great bang for the buck."
7952930,46194087,2015-09-08,27246418,Tommy,"Megan and her husband greeted my friend and I upon arrival, and gave us a tour of the place along with all the necessary instructions. The place was great and cozy. We really enjoyed all the amenities their place offered and absolutely no issues on the noise. Would highly recommend and love to stay their again!"
7952930,46547302,2015-09-11,9522583,Ian,"Megan and her husband were helpful, prompt, and accommodating. The space was perfect for what we needed, and a great value considering it's  essentially an entire private apartment. Great location and clean. The family loves upstairs, including little ones, but they're very quiet. Would absolutely stay here again."
7952930,46770192,2015-09-13,30998866,Bryan,"Megan did a great job accommodating a delayed arrival with issues on our end.  She was quite flexible in allowing us to show up and the place still felt cozy and inviting once we finally got in.  Easy parking that she kept open for us the entire stay.  The basement had way more space than we needed, it was good to be able to spread out and relax.

The bathroom has a low ceiling, but we were ok (at about 5'11"").  If you are 6'2"" or more you might have a problem.  Otherwise, this place worked out well.  

If you want a cozy, off the loud street, easy in-and-out type of place, then you should consider staying here."
7952930,48810370,2015-09-28,6263377,Cheryl,"We missed each other on arrival, but once we were in, the bed was very comfy and it was a quiet space to sleep."
7952930,49355167,2015-10-03,39239738,Sally,"We definitely felt welcomed by Megan. When I messaged her she was quick to respond, nearly within the hour each time. She made getting in easy and her communications were thorough."
7952930,49678541,2015-10-05,25722978,Teagan,We loved our time in Seattle and it was nice having a great place to rest up before the next day. The apt was much nicer than we expected. Thanks so much. 
7952930,50113678,2015-10-09,12147636,Allison,"Had a really nice stay at Megan's place! A few friends from California came to visit me and the space was more than enough for the three of us for the few nights we booked. Megan was also flexible with our check-in time which was a relief since we arrived late in the evening. 

The neighborhood is pleasant and close to the freeway. The space itself is clean and spacious, with a private entry and a nice outside area. 

I would definitely recommend this place for anyone coming to visit! "
7952930,51156280,2015-10-18,409761,Rosh,We had a wonderful stay! yeah! 
7952930,53385373,2015-11-08,8104145,Christelle,"Megan's place is exactly as described in the ad and on the pictures: large, cozy and comfortable. It's a basement but it's fairly quiet. It can fit 4 people very comfortably. Thank you!"
9970805,57744118,2015-12-28,11813281,Robert,"Emily's place was awesome, really centrally located. Her communication is great and she worked with me even though she wasn't home to help me find the apartment and everything I needed inside. Highly recommended!"
8958290,52187400,2015-10-26,19495162,Drew,"Very nice place.  Very comfortable in a beautiful, quiet neighbourhood.  About 30 minute walk from UW campus (or 15 in hurry), but probably 10 minutes by bus.
The couple was extremely nice and pleasant to chat with.
Two of the loveliest cats you'll ever encounter.
I needed a place very quickly and they were most accommodating!
Very comfortable bed.  I recommend fully and would definitely return upon my next visit!"
8958290,55847959,2015-12-06,32895184,Tulja,"Sehar and her husband are a lovely couple with a very cute home with a great view of the lake.  They made me feel very welcome, and even turned the temperature up just for me since I was cold.  They have two adorable cats that are as playful as little fun dogs, and a clean, comfortable home to enjoy while visiting Seattle."
3995007,19256892,2014-09-08,761617,Mike,The reservation was canceled 3 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
3995007,20438451,2014-09-29,19837354,Amy,"An was  great host—and responded to all questions.  The apartment was modern, very clean and the furniture was all very nice.  She provided many ""extras"" like dish soap, laundry detergent, etc.  The building is in a great location—walking distance to Pike Place Market, Space Needle, Aquarium, shopping district and the waterfront.  The patio right off the apartment is great, and has easy access to the shared patio.  When the weather allowed it was a great place to hang out—and we barely saw anyone use it even though the whole building has access.  We found the building to be quiet all times of the day.  The gym (which we didn't use) looked very nice.  The parking garage is very convenient--right under the building.  The space is a little tight, but once you get use to pulling in it is totally fine.
The only cons (and none were really a huge deal):
No AC but An let us borrow a fan which was great.  
There was also no access to regular TV—only TIVO, HULU or other AP based programming.  
The bedroom window is right up against the shared patio, so at first it felt kinda exposed, but there was barely ever anyone on the patio and with the blinds it was fine.  Noise was not an issue.
It is an ""open one-bedroom"" so more of a studio feel, but we had a third person stay with us a few of the nights and it was fine—the couch converts to a bed.
If we were coming back to Seattle we would stay there again!"
3995007,20792319,2014-10-05,2934253,Catriona,"Great location and stunning terrace overlooking the Sound. Room very comfortable and we appreciated the excellent onsite gym, parking and great variety of good restaurants nearby. Great location for walking around the city. Would certainly stay here again and recommend. "
3995007,23345052,2014-11-29,21946345,Herman,"An was the perfect host upon arrival after a long international flight. She made us feel at home and gave detailed descriptions of how to find our way around her apartment.  She had maps prepared for all Seattle's hotspots. She checked in regularly to make sure that we had everything we needed. And then there is the gorgeous apartment with sea view from the large ( almost private ) balcony. In immediate proximity of pike market, space needle and great restaurant area's the apartment is perfectly situated for fun walks. Check out hotel Edgewater on the waterfront. Great for a cup of coffe in the morning or glass of wine in the evening at approx 200 meters distance.
We hope to come back soon.

3995007,23538715,2014-12-03,1462456,Michael,An was very accommodating in terms of checking me in early and did everything possible to make me feel welcome and comfortable. The unit/location itself was perfect and I really enjoyed meeting An.
3995007,23661310,2014-12-07,55687,Sydney,"An was an amazing host! The apartment was easy to find and she guided us from the airport and welcomed us upon arrival which made our day so much better. 

The apartment is in a fabulous location with an amazing view, workout facilities, free coffee (!), its super clean and has a semi private balcony. We really loved our experience."
3995007,24029776,2014-12-17,22736276,Roxanne,"Our trip to Seattle was a great experience. I think what made it better was our private stay at An & Jen's listing. An was easy to reach out to and I'm thankful that she accomadated our last min parking situation. The space overall was cozy and looked exactly like the pictures. It was nice to have a booklet of suggestions at hand, because we were very new to the place. What I liked the most was that everything was within walking distance and accessible. The location was perfect and the view was ideal. Definitely coming back & definitely recommending to my family and friends."
3995007,24204650,2014-12-22,4771651,Susy,The host checked in with us regularly and was always available when we needed. The place was really nice and new and went beyond my expectations.
3995007,24283047,2014-12-24,24529131,Chuck,"Jen's house is so great that we can watch the view of lake at the house deck. Have a seat, enjoy the view as well in the morning and at night. The distance between Pike Place Market and here is about 15 min by walking. We don't worry about buying and eating in the neighborhood. The location of her house is quite convenient. My friends and I had really great sleep here. It's quiet at the midnight. "
3995007,24599339,2014-12-31,20239272,Julie,"Jen was very responsive during the booking process and very friendly upon check-in.  She provided a lot of very useful information about the area.  The apartment was very comfortable and the location perfect to discover the city, walking distance to all sites (space needle, waterfront, pike market, etc.).  We would totally recommend Jen as a host!"
3995007,24931130,2015-01-04,9453700,Jillian,"What a wonderful experience we had in Jen & An's apartment. A truly beautiful apartment in a great area of Seattle. It was our first time visiting the city and we weren't sure where to stay, and we were delighted with our choice. A ""walkable"" area  - close to Pike Place Market, good restaurants on 1st, Top Pot Donuts, Serious Pie, Dahlia Lounge, Palace Kitchen, The Space Needle, The Chihuly Museum - all Seattle musts. The apt itself is gorgeous - the balcony of course the highlight. We would stay there again! "
3995007,25321458,2015-01-12,21914804,Stephanie,The apartment was absolutely wonderful. It's in a great location with it being just a two minute walk from Pikes Place. Jen and An were very friendly and flexible with check-in and check-out times. I would recommend staying here if you're visiting Seattle. 
3995007,25552506,2015-01-19,12246247,Tien,"Great place to stay, the balcony is a huge, and even though it is shared, no one really goes on there, so it is pretty much yours. The location is very close to the market, about 5-10 minutes walking. The place was very clean, and you can tell Jen & An took their time with their decorations. "
3995007,25880190,2015-01-28,15523775,Jeanne,Our stay at Jen and An's place was just perfect! The location is amazing and Jen was so gracious and even welcomed us with a bouquet of beautiful flowers from the market place. The apartment is immaculate and very cozy with great decor. The balcony has a great bay view with a fire pit that we enjoyed. We had all amenities and even parking right out front of the building! I would absolutely recommend staying here to anyone for your time in Seattle. Thank you Jen and An!
3995007,26070783,2015-02-02,22721704,Greg,"The flat was lovely and was exactly what we expected. Wonderful location for some Seattle fun! Jen was a great host, giving us privacy but also leading us in the right direction with all her helpful resources provided in the flat."
3995007,26232244,2015-02-07,18492801,Ned,"Jen is a real pro and I have stayed at two of her properties now in Seattle... both fabulous. Easy access, great communications, and the places are always so cool and awesome. This one has an awesome deck with views of the sound and the gym in this building is fantastic. Cozy, hip, and delightful place in a great part of town. For anyone worried about noise, don't be. The place closes up tighter than a drum and the windows face away from the Viaduct so the traffic noise is minimal if not non-existent!"
3995007,26355585,2015-02-10,25099954,Liana,"Our stay was really comfortable, and the place was in a great location!  walking distance to the market, with a great patio.  The only hiccup was at check in, but Jen was quick to offer her apologies and a discount on the rate.  Great girls weekend."
3995007,27039333,2015-02-23,7119933,Stephen,"Jen's place was great: everything was as-advertised, and we had no issues. The place is well decorated, comfortable, and very clean. There was even shampoo and a fresh package of soap in the shower!

Jen herself was friendly and responsive to our requests, despite us getting in late at night. Thanks for having us!"
3995007,27174133,2015-02-27,3750680,Wendy,"I stayed here with a girl friend, both of us from NYC. We really enjoyed our stay at Jen's apartment. Super clean, large open spaces, washer/dryer right in the unit, and beautiful sunlight from the large windows.
Very close to Pike Place Market, and close to 1st and 2nd avenues, which had cute lunch and coffee spots. There was a large hill to walk up to get to that neighborhood though, just a warning.
Building was great. Easy to find and had a gorgeous large deck right outside the apartment. Jen left tons of maps and info about sightseeing in and around Seattle and even checked in with us during our stay to see if we needed anything. Would definitely stay here again if I find myself in Seattle."
3995007,27523790,2015-03-06,14768332,Brandan,"Jen was a pleasure to deal with. Very professional and helpful. 
The studio is located in a great area close to Pikes Place Market. I think the highlight of the unit is the attached deck with a view of the sound. Well equipped for a long stay with a modern kitchen and Washer/Dryer. No complaints, I would recommend to a friend. "
3995007,28039458,2015-03-16,6741518,Danielle,Jen's place was amazing and so was she! The location can't be beat! You are literally within walking distance to Pike's Market. The place was clean and exactly as described. I especially loved the view of Puget Sound. Will definitely consider staying here again when in Seattle.
3995007,28619239,2015-03-27,514097,Cherie,"Jen's home was in a great place for being downtown. A spectacular view and very spacious. Jen was very prompt on communication. The home had a very modern and clean feel, I wish it had had more kitchen supplies then I would've used the kitchen more. But overall it was such a joy to stay there and enjoy the beauty of Seattle right from her home."
3995007,30113731,2015-04-17,2413933,Amritansh,"Jen's place is great. Its a studio, but its roomy and very comfortable.
There is on street parking if you are out before 8am (or you have to pay) or there are a few garages close by.
Jen was really prompt in responding to any questions I had, getting in was super convenient, the place was clean. I would highly recommend and will use it if I am up in Seattle again"
3995007,30531633,2015-04-23,4018275,Tiffany,"We had a wonderful stay here! The apartment was very cute, clean, and lovely-- we loved how it was furnished! We also used the sofa bed which folded out into a futon, and it was very comfortable as well. The balcony was also a great touch, and the location is great; it's close to Centennial Park and Pike's place which is awesome! 

Jen was very welcoming-- she gave me a call when I got in to make sure everything was okay and to answer questions. The instructions on how to get in and where everything was were also very clear and accurate. She was very responsive and reachable. "
3995007,30803117,2015-04-27,23434488,Jannike,"Staying at Jen's place was absolutely amazing! It was super clean, up to date appliances and felt very cozy at home. She was super nice and very easy to communicate with. I definitely recommend staying at her place for sure! "
3995007,33478322,2015-05-28,13506892,Chad,"Amazing place with great view. The host was really helpful even though we got in extremely late. The apartment had all facilities and weather helped us sit out and enjoy seattle's awesome weather. Beds were fine, however, we had tremendous itching issues. Could be just us but Jen will be taking care of it."
3995007,33957583,2015-06-02,1755790,Olivier,"Jen's place was super convenient, modern and comfortable just by the waterfront. Terrace and view are a must, even though it is not private,  there is enough privacy. Building has good gym and easy access. Above all, Jen has really thought it out to make the guest experience very enjoyable. 
Good value"
3995007,34382664,2015-06-07,3553063,Dave,Great stay. Awesome location and hip little building.  Would definitely recommend. 
3995007,34741696,2015-06-11,12767294,Alex,"Thank you Jen for such a wonderful place to stay! You made getting in and out easy and checking in was flawless. The views were very great, the location was close to everything we wanted to do. Finding parking was not a challenge so we were able to walk to all the things we love when we are in Seattle.
The actual place was gorgeous, roomy and was a perfect fit for us.
Thank you again and we look forward to seeing you again.
Alex, Allison and Tash!"
3995007,35375835,2015-06-18,7932718,Wendy,"If you are planning a trip to Seattle, this is the perfect place to stay. The apartment is filled with light and looks onto a wonderful terrace garden which you can't see well in the pictures.  The flowers were is full bloom when we stayed.  All directions for getting into the  apartment building and the apartment itself were clear.  

You can walk to Pike's market in 8-10 minutes.  Or to the convention center in 25.  We were attending a conference there and found the apartment a nice distance. We could grab a warm croissant across from the market on our way in the morning.  Lots of uberX cruising by if you don't like walking.  "
3995007,36772946,2015-07-01,21655513,Gerd,"We really enjoyed this little apartment in the sky, especially the Eco roof garden right off our unit. The location was great, within walking distance to the Space Needle and Pikes Place Market. Lots of good restaurants close by, which we enjoyed. But the last night we decided to take advantage of the kitchen and cooking utensils to have home cooked colossal shrimp we purchased at Pikes Place Market, along with a bottle of wine and we were in Eco heaven. We will be back for a longer visit next time. Did I mention the great gym on the second floor?"
3995007,37454560,2015-07-07,12882359,Minnie,"The apartment is exactly as pictured. Clean, efficient, minimalist. Loved it. You can't beat the location. We walked everywhere..Pike Market, Needle, EMP, Chihuly gardens. Great restaurants within walking distance as well. Waterfront. The patio and deck were beautiful!  Our only surprise was the heat and the apartment does not have air conditioning. Jenn responded immediately to our request for an additional fan, an we strategically were out during the hottest part of the day. It all worked out.  Would stay again."
3995007,37709499,2015-07-09,858699,Kraig,"Great space, seamless arrival/departure, very clean!"
3995007,37830995,2015-07-11,27378161,Brittney,"Our experience was wonderful and made our Seattle stay perfect. From the details in the bathroom to the beautiful sun deck that we watched the sunset on, we couldn't have imagined a better first time Seattle experience."
3995007,38499063,2015-07-16,6878286,John,The apartment was lovely and perfect for a couple or young family.  The place was really easy to find and a short walk from Pike Place and all the main Seattle attractions.  The outside space is a nice added bonus as well - great for relaxing after a busy day exploring the city.
3995007,39754694,2015-07-26,31741708,Jared,"This listing is awesome! My wife and I had an incredible week in Seattle. The location is right between the shopping/market area and Seattle center where museums and the space needle are. Everything is within walking distance. The room got a bit stuffy, but the fan and open windows helped a lot. Check-in and check-out were super easy. I definitely recommend this listing. "
3995007,40088617,2015-07-28,12928153,Catherine,"Jen is the epitome of a great AirBnb host. She's very friendly, and you get a sense that she loves what she does. She's that kind of host that will go out of her way to make your stay perfect! "
3995007,40302610,2015-07-30,23936703,Stefan,"Unsere Gastgeberin war super, alles hat geklappt. Wohnung sauber und toll eingerichtet. Bettsofa eignet sich nur bedingt für 2 Personen. Seattle kann man von dort problemlos zu Fuss erkunden. "
3995007,40416625,2015-07-30,34614131,Chris,The host canceled this reservation 13 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
3995007,40734040,2015-08-02,28501878,Cayce,"Jen was such a great, accommodating host. Despite the fact there was a heat advisory in Seattle all four days we visited (and not a drop of rain or cloud in the sky), Jen let us use a box fan to help keep the place cool (There is no A/C). The view from the condo was beautiful and because this was such a central location, we only needed Uber for the longer rides to Freemont, etc.  

Jen had a quick response rate whenever we had questions or needed anything. "
3995007,41036364,2015-08-03,26029158,Cara,"The apartment is very conveniently located near Pike Place Market, the Neptune Room and many of the fun places to be in the city.  While it was tidy, it was not clean. There was no toilet paper when we arrived and there was a lot of dust and dander around the apartment. The outdoor space and view are both spectacular. Check out is a bit early if you're coming into the city for a late show, but is perfect if you're an early riser and want to get out and enjoy the city. Jen insists on not asking any questions of management in the building almost to a point that it makes you feel like you're doing something wrong by just being there. I felt uneasy in the space and would recommend asking all your questions upfront. All in all, great location."
3995007,41943480,2015-08-10,33758287,Andrew,"The host has been extremely helpful from the day I booked. Inside the unit itself, there was a 'house manual' that provided tons of information about the unit itself and the tourist attractions surrounding it. Definitely would book again!"
3995007,42284278,2015-08-12,37091373,Julie,"Jen made us feel welcome by being available for questions, being flexible and understanding about our very late check in due to traffic. Also a nice welcome more and info book. The multiple bags of popcorn also helped since we had not had dinner.
Pictures totally described the place. It was lovely and very comfortable.  At first the neighborhood didn't seem like much because we were not familiar with Seattle but it turned out to be a great location for the pier restaurants and pikes market. And lots of restaurants and stores on nearby 1st ave.
Would definitely stay here again."
3995007,42594516,2015-08-14,13758178,Eric,"Excellent location, clean modern apartment. Jen was a nice host and communicated very well prior to arrival and made everything clear. Would certainly stay there again in the future."
3995007,43202166,2015-08-17,41504281,Tirzah,Jen was wonderful. She quickly responded to all our questions and the studio was great - perfect for a short getaway. WE would love to stay there again! 
3995007,43763307,2015-08-22,34385926,Lance,Our stay was fantastic! We loved the apartment and views. The location was perfect as we were able to walk to all the attractions. Jen made the check in/check out process very simple and efficient. We would absolutely stay here again. Thanks Jen!
3995007,44035426,2015-08-23,41325885,John,"Great location, clean and tidy condo, very secure building made for a very nice short trip to the big city."
3995007,44290805,2015-08-25,14380488,Cameron,Thank you Jen for everything the stay was wonderful. We really enjoyed the view and terrace. Looking forward to staying with you again sometime.  
3995007,44802303,2015-08-29,4460906,Courtney,Best AirBnb! Would love to stay again!
3995007,45293391,2015-09-01,40434095,Jonathan,Jen was super helpful from the start. All directions were clear and easy to follow. She even let us check in a little early so we could drop our bags off. She was also readily available by text all weekend. The room was lovely and super clean. The description was spot on. Really nice building in a great location.
3995007,45661377,2015-09-05,34994268,Tera,Jen's apartment was beautiful and perfect for our trip! Convenient location to all the attractions we wanted to see in Seattle! The apartment is cool and we enjoyed the large balcony. Jen was very helpful and accommodating when we had questions about parking and logistics when we arrived. Great host!!
3995007,46271265,2015-09-09,23902920,Anna,"Very good communication made check in process super easy and seamless. The place is centrally located and close to Beltown bars and restaurant – walking distance to all Downtown tourist attractions.
We enjoyed the huge terrace overlooking the water, it’s right outside the balcony door. 
Beds were OK comfy, my only complaint would be that the place wasn’t cleaned very well for our arrival.
I would totally recommend this place if you a looking for a hotel quality place close to downtown.
"
3995007,47048850,2015-09-15,11859168,Derran,"Jen was great and made sure we were settled in and comfortable. Apartment is exactly as described and very comfortable for a couple, with a great terrace commanding views of the bay and islands. Great place to explore Seattle from, and a great host. Thanks, Jen!"
3995007,47496618,2015-09-19,11242455,Sandra,"We had a great experience using Jen's studio apartment.  It was clean, bright and very comfortable.  She was very attentive and communicated with us early on to let us know how to access the apartment.  The location was terrific - we could walk to Pike Place Market, Seattle Center and the ferry (which we took to go to Bainbridge Island one day).  There is a parking garage right across the street and we didn't move the car for the entire 3 days we were there.
Thanks, Jen. You have a lovely place."
3995007,47511584,2015-09-19,42292947,David,"Super easy and friendly, made me want to use airbnb more, she was very prompt on amy needs"
3995007,48154513,2015-09-23,37798568,Gerardo,"Jen was very helpful over the phone, making sure I knew the ins and outs of her place. The place itself was AMAZING. Like, my goodness, you can't beat that view. Definitely recommend this place. "
3995007,48884047,2015-09-29,28594583,Abhishek,The apartment felt a little small for 3 people. The location was good as it was very close to pike place market. The parking situation in the building wasn't all figured during the first day so we had to park in the street (I think Jen did offer us to reimburse if we chose to park in some lot). Overall it was an average place.
3995007,49402169,2015-10-03,25380665,Mark,"The perfect spot for our first time exploring Seattle! Our family of four felt very much at home in Jen's place during our first two days in the city. We walked to The Space Needle, explored Pikes Market, Seattle's Aquarium, and the Olympic Sculpture Garden all on foot from the condo. 

The view was excellent from the patio, and the sights and sounds of the water were present as soon as you cracked a window. Fantastic place. The only small thing that I wish was in the unit were toiletries. We couldn't fly with our toothpaste, or body wash and forgot to stop on the way in from the airport to grab any. Luckily there are a ton of markets and stores 2 minutes away. Again, that is completely minor and I'm only splitting hairs. This is the spot to stay if you're ever in the area!"
3995007,49961547,2015-10-07,29620706,Emma,We were only able to stay one night but found Jens place very comfortable with everything we needed and the location was very convenient. Jen was great at keeping in contact with us to allow us an easy check in and check out. Would definitely stay again on return to Seattle. 
3995007,49999359,2015-10-08,23383678,Kathy,We had a great time and the apartment was lovely! Make sure you bring your own shampoo and conditioner - but other than that our stay was excellent!
3995007,50632789,2015-10-13,14320361,Adam,Everything was as expected and as advertised. Jen was very welcoming and easy to communicate with. There is a great outdoor patio area just outside the room that has some great views. Great place to stay if you want to be within walking distance of both the Space Needle and of Pike Place (there are some hills though!). 
3995007,53565639,2015-11-09,21420927,Ada,"Lovely apartment with water view, cute balcony, nicely furnished. Absolutely perfect for weekend getaway. Loved the location. Belltown restaurants are fantastic. Host Jen was very accommodating and friendly. Really nice modern lobby area. The apartment is comfortable, clean, and cute!!"
3995007,54273743,2015-11-17,2886767,Zach,"Jen was very friendly and made our visit to Seattle smooth. The place is very cute and perfectly located for exploring the city on foot. There are a ton of great restaurants, bars, shops, and attractions within a short walk. It was also pretty quiet, despite being so close to everything. The patio makes for a fun and unique experience, as well. I would definitely recommend Jen's place to anyone looking for a walkable starting point in Seattle."
3995007,54762254,2015-11-23,3273432,Siamac,Fantastic home. We had a great time and the location is perfect. The host was fantastic and communicative. I had a great time in Seattle and it was amazing to stay at her home! Thanks again!
3995007,56212273,2015-12-10,30743398,Bryce,Jen's place was pleasant to stay in. Would reccomend to anyone hoping to explore Belltown while in Seattle!
3995007,56525016,2015-12-14,23182855,Amira,Jen has a very central key location loft in Seattle. The apartment was very comfortable and came with laundry which was nice. Great experience
3995007,56983684,2015-12-20,37729695,John,Jen was very responsive and helpful!  Very cool place!
5242712,27040181,2015-02-23,28076100,Tenaya,"This was a great place close to downtown, on the uphill side, and was very clean and spacious.  The host had a clean bathroom, big open main room and a nice kitchen just big enough for the basics, but works just fine!  King size bed is super nice and I got a good nights' rest there for sure.  The host left a place to hang a few things, plenty of room for me to spread out and big TV for sure!  Location was great for this place, hard to find parking but eventually I did each night."
5242712,29244065,2015-04-05,30373899,Savannah,"For a last minute trip, we booked this gem in Capitol Hill. Even with my very short notice, Alex was super friendly and welcoming! The place was clean, orderly, and easy to find.

His place is a large studio, fully stocked with all the necessary traveler's items, and bacon. I typically don't eat much bacon, but I was glad to indulge while visiting the well fed city. He even left some emergen-C packs--which was really nice after running ourselves pretty ragged with tourist fun.

There were lots of things to do in the neighborhood all within walking distance. It was easy to communicate with Alex who gave us lots of tips about traveling through Seattle--we ended up arriving late one evening and leaving early for our departure, which he was able to accommodate. 

I recommend him with enthusiasm! A really nice place to stay! Thank you Alex!"
5242712,29872660,2015-04-13,24877339,Taufique,"The studio was great!  It was perfectly located on Capitol Hill, just far enough to be quiet, but close enough that we could get anywhere just by walking.  Inside, the studio was clean, stocked with the essentials, maps, and anything else we might've needed.  The parking situation could have been bad, but our host had left us a parking pass for the neighborhood.  All in all, we enjoyed our stay, and would look up Alex's apartment again should we ever come back to Seattle."
5242712,32604404,2015-05-19,5603400,Eric,The place was in the perfect location in Capitol Hill.  The pictures really don't do it justice as this place is very clean and big for 1 or 2 guests.  It was easy to get in and out of the place and communication was easy and fast. 
5242712,33098486,2015-05-25,29753365,Hector,"The apartment's location is perfect.  Its one block from Pike street and 2 blocks from Pine.   This is a tremendous convenience since there is a plethora of dining options as well as a broad array of services.   The apartment is also large and very well kept so it was very convenient.    Although its very close to Pike and Pine streets, since the apt is not on the actual streets, its very quite.    Last but not least, the host was very quick to respond to any issues/questions.    Highly recommended for anyone staying in Capitol Hill.   "
5242712,33820135,2015-06-01,22195379,Tina,Very good experience. Spacious room. Very clean! Location is convenient and quiet. Will recommend.
5242712,34162389,2015-06-05,30109414,Greg,"The place was in decent shape and in a great part of Capitol Hill.  Comfortable bed and excellent shower.  I couldn't find the wifi info upon arrival, but the host was very quick to respond and it was resolved quickly.  

Would definitely stay here again.

"
5242712,34643992,2015-06-10,10372,Mitch,"The listing was as advertised. Quite a minimalist set up but it was quiet and the bed was relatively comfortable. Alex left shampoo, soap, even a bottle of wine which was nice. The main problem was the lack of AC; unfortunately there was a heat wave in Seattle at the time and it made it quite uncomfortable at night. I'm sure it's fine most of the year. 

The main problem I have  with this set up is the use of a third party called (website hidden). I have been using (and hosting) Airbnb for years, and this was the first time I have used this system. It really is quite depersonalizing, and eliminates much of the draw of airbnb. There was a glitch in getting in the front door, and I had to phone a call center in order to get specific instructions, instead of calling Alex directly. In fact I never had Alex's cell number, even when I asked he didn't provide it. I will probably continue using Airbnb but not if any of the hosts use this pillow service (which I'm not even sure you can differentiate on the listing). "
5242712,35097009,2015-06-15,25667047,Veronica,"When we arrived, the building's intercoms/numeric gate code system was malfunctioning (not Alex's fault) so we had to wait for a resident to open the door to the building for us but once we got in, everything else was smooth sailing. The apartment itself was very clean, smelled nice, and comfy. We slept well on the bed, and really enjoyed the air purifier :) thanks for a great Seattle stay!"
5242712,35346992,2015-06-17,8267121,Linda,This was a very nice and very clean apartment in a safe and rather cool neighborhood. A very easy walk to downtown for business and some fun local shopping. I recommend it!
5242712,35668498,2015-06-21,32717932,Danny,"This studio was great! It is close to everything and in a fun, safe neighborhood with lots of cafes and dining options. You can tell that the space is well-maintained, and the building is nice and quiet."
5242712,36817952,2015-07-01,5025663,Jacob,"Staying in this pillow location was great. The location is in a hip area that allowed us to walk almost everywhere..... By walking we justified all the pastries we ate from pike place. 
It was a very clean and comfortable accommodation that was exceptionally quiet. 

This airbnb met and exceeded my expectations. I would recommend to friends and family staying in Seattle!"
5242712,37976218,2015-07-12,33368340,Tiffany,"We had an awesome stay at Alex's apartment, it was clean and cozy with a nice king size bed. Alex was super helpful with our stay and recommended a lot of places for us to check out in Seattle. Alex had everything stocked for guests and if you forgot anything no worries because he has a closet full of items every traveller needs. Easy checkin and checkout. Overall great host and any issues were fixed promptly."
5242712,38463508,2015-07-15,5028135,Amanda,"I was in town for business and wanted to relax in a more ""homey"" feel sort of environment. I am still relatively new to airbnb so I wasnt quite sure how it was going to pan out. Luckily I found this inexpensive and very adorable listing.

It was available the dates I was going to be in town so I booked. When I got into town I waited a few hours for the unit to be ready.  Check in is at 3pm and no early check in available. There will always be pros and cons to staying in a conventional hotel . 

Finding the place and getting the keys were exceptionally easy, the vintage building was incredibly cute and in a trendy neighborhood. So you can walk to everything you need really.

The downside to this place is that parking is a bit tricky, and it is metered parking which is 5$ every 2 hours. Big city prices, im from LA so im used to it.  IF you can get lucky and find non metered parking then you are good to go. 

The unit was really inviting, and Alex was really informative. There was plenty of natural lighting  and the space was immaculately clean. I was very comfortable my entire stay. Everything I needed was closeby and I was able to cook my dinner instead of the surprisingly tiring room-service hahah.

Thank you Alex!

5242712,38638786,2015-07-17,207419,Hayoung,"The studio was clean and ready for us to use. The building was a bit spooky. Easy check in/out. Alex was really quick to respond nmy questions. 
 I didn't really understand the service called ""pillow"" where you can check all the instruction but if you don't have wifi connection, it's bit confusing. "
5242712,38917425,2015-07-19,30675072,Estefanía,"AWESOME!!!! My friend and I were so lucky to be able to stay at this studio and to be able to meet Alex. About the place, it was as it was described, very comfortable bed, very clean and with a lot of handful supplies like shampoo, toothbrush, sun cream, etc. We could go walking to downtown (around 20 minutes) and the neighborhood has a lot of cafes, restaurants and bar. Very lively during the weekend. 
Alex went far and beyond, he  helped us a lot, first letting us stay even though he needed his place that weekend. Also,taking us to explore a few places and giving us recommendations. The last day he even kept our luggage because we were departing late and we didn´t have a place to leave it.
Next time I go to Seattle, I will definitely try to stay here again! 
10 out of 10!

5242712,39224245,2015-07-21,36544032,Katrina,"This was a clean, centrally located apartment that was easy to navigate to. I appreciated how simple it was to check in. I enjoyed the neighborhood and some of the neighbors were very nice and helpful as to what to do around town. I would have preferred a safer parking area other than the streeet. I did not like how impersonal the Pillow service seemed as airbnb is supposed to be more personal. Overall the studio was nice and I appreciated how quickly Alex responded to my questions. Thanks so much!"
5242712,41621671,2015-08-08,5943872,David,"Great location, exactly as described.  One block from Pine/Pike corridor.  If you want to stay in Capitol Hill, this is perfect."
5242712,41977727,2015-08-10,19418263,Diana,"The studio was simple and clean.  Excellent location, walking distance to most everything.  Also, easy check-in/out process.    Small hiccup with the parking arrangement when we got in, but Alex responded immediately.  Note that the host hires a management company (Pillow) to oversee rentals.  It can be a bit confusing at first but worked out fine. "
5242712,43063454,2015-08-17,815073,Tatiana,"My sister and I thought this was a great little place in the perfect location. Within walking distance to Pike Place and Capitol Hill but far enough to not feel touristy. Our only critique was that there's a very large television which is kind of a tease once you realize that you can only watch local channels. We were wishing we'd brought our Chromecast or Roku, but besides that, great spot!"
5242712,43386297,2015-08-19,36985263,Derek,"We had a great time staying in Alex's studio apartment. It is just the right size for two people. Alex and the Pillow Team he used were very responsive to us, especially in letting us know how to get into the apartment. The studio was clean and smelled great. The bed was very roomy and comfy too. The stay even came with little amenities (shower gel, conditioner, lotion)! 
The location was indeed close to everything. It's about a 15-20 min walk to Pike's Market and a short cab ride to the Space Needle. 
Although long-term parking was hard to find, there is a U-Park lot close to the building on the same street that you can park overnight in. 
Overall, Alex's studio provided us exactly what we needed in our layover in Seattle. We would stay here again."
5242712,44535154,2015-08-27,34872089,Noelle,"Wonderful, central location and Pillow and Alex were a great host. We had a minor issue regarding WIFI, but Pillow and Alex were accessible and promptly resolved the issue. Perfect-size space, basic amenities provided and clean. Thank you for a great first trip to Seattle!"
5242712,45377881,2015-09-02,35302944,Kathryn,"Great location and very nice apartment.  Alex uses a third party service, but they were responsive and easy to deal with.  The instructions to get into the apartment were clear.

However, we did not have WiFi for the entire 6 day stay.  The third party service was unable to address it and Alex did not respond to provide any options toward resolution. Being international, this was a big issue.

There were some issues with the apartment itself - the bed was partially broken and we had to fix it before it could be used; the doorknob to the bathroom fell off, so you chanced getting stuck inside every time; there was very old and expired food all throughout the kitchen, which seemed unsanitary; the sheets were not properly sized for the bed and didn't include a fitted sheet, which was weird. 

Overall, due to the lack of advertised amenities and issues with broken/uncleaned items, the experience was not great.  As is, I would not recommend this location.  If Alex addresses the issues, it could be a good place to stay."
5242712,46595998,2015-09-12,38615897,Matt,"The place was clean and the location was very conveniently located.  The check-in instructions were very thorough.  The internet was immediately a problem.  The airbnb site for this apartment had different instructions in different places for the internet.  Part of the description said the router would be in the apartment and produce a password upon pressing a button.  Another part gave different instructions on how to connect.  When I asked Pillow homes, the management company, they gave me yet a third set of instructions.  The network Pillow Homes gave me didn't exist.  I went back and forth with them because the owner was mostly not available. Unfortunately, he was the only person with any power to do anything about the internet.  They said the internet was down and wouldn't be fixed until the day before I was scheduled to leave my six night stay.  They offered no other solution and no refund.  I eventually discovered there was a wifi network available for a fee.  The owner said he would cover it when I asked him to.  I had to ask multiple times after the stay was over for the owner to refund me the cost of the wifi, which he eventually did a week after the stay.

The down blanket had no duvet cover on it which doesn't seem sanitary since I doubt they are washing a down blanket after every visitor.   The bed didn't have a fitted sheet, but a sheet tucked in which immediately became untucked.  The pillows were much too large to fit in the pillow cases and just hung out.  There were no batteries in the TV remote.  The door knob on the bathroom would just fall off, locking you in the bathroom until someone on the other side opened it.  I think these details are being overlooked by the management company since no one actually lives in this place.  It appears to be a full-time rental. "
5242712,47434074,2015-09-18,33220591,Graham,"We cannot praise Alex and the Pillow team highly enough.  Despite the fact that we needed to find a place to stay at short notice they made the entire process so easy and completely stress free.  

The apartment was incredibly well presented, comfortable and spotless throughout and the cupboard containing spare toiletries, sewing kits etc. was a lovely touch.  The location was also perfect to explore Capital Hill, only a 15 minute walk from the heart of downtown and well served by bus routes.  

Alex and the Pillow team were also on hand to provide us with some excellent recommendations for local restaurants, bars and places to visit.  We would be more than happy to stay here next time we're in town and wouldn't hesitate to recommend the apartment to anyone else visiting Seattle.  A wonderful place to stay!"
5242712,51064881,2015-10-17,23759725,Aramis,"DON'T BOOK THIS APARTMENT!! This is the worst experience I've ever had on Airbnb. Alex gives his apartment to a management company called Pillow, which was fine, except when you called his number, it would just automatically be transferred to the company. Sometimes when you want to talk to the host himself, it is not that easy. But that is not the issue. The issues were much more severe than just communication. The first ""surprise""—Blood stains on the comforter and linen. That's right, BLOOD STAINS. I could hardly believe it, but there were blood stains on the comforter and linen. What a big welcome for the first day. We immediately try to contact Alex, which got transferred to the Pillow company. But since I don't have a number and usually use Google Voice(an app that needs Internet connection to make free calls), internet connection was crucial to me, which Alex knew beforehand. Just when I was trying to connect to WiFi, here comes the second surprise—there is no WiFi in the house! On the pillow page there was clear instructions on where to find the connector, what it looked like and where it was located, after looking for it for half an hour, I finally gave up. So we went out and stood out of a sushi bar with free wifi to call Alex's cell phone. And then later, while for 2 hours for the Pillow team to come get us a new comforter and linen so that we can sleep on the bed, we discovered another surprise—there were 3 HOLES ON THE WINDOW SCREEN. The Pillow team promised that they would deal with this as soon as possible, or at least tape them for us, but NOBODY came after that. So the entire week we were there, we weren't able to open the window because even though there was window screen, some bugs managed to come through. The first day was wasted just like that. We didn't do anything although we arrived there at 1:30 in the afternoon. We basically cleaned the whole apartment ourselves (the table was very dusty), made the bed with comforter and linens brought by Pillow team. And then the next day, we went back to the sushi bar so that I could contact Alex in order to resolve internet connection problem, that was when Alex told me that we need to buy the Xfinity Wifi and he would reimburse us. YES, YOU NEED TO BUY WIFI AND THEN GET REIMBURSED. If I knew this at the beginning, I would never have booked this place. So to me, it is very dishonest and I feel like I’ve been fooled. But if you don’t mind all I just said, the house does locate in a central location. We walked to everywhere except University of Washington."
5242712,52021548,2015-10-25,4588939,Romey,"Alex was extremely welcoming. In fact He (or she-not sure as we never met!) bought a couple of chocolate bars, a breakfast sandwich and a beautiful orchid and dropped it off for us!  How sweet!  I had trouble with the internet and called the service and all was taken care of immediately.  The place was represented perfectly and we were very happy in this well located spacious, clean studio.  Would stay here again for sure.  The only issue we had was parking."
5242712,55062148,2015-11-27,49431596,Michael,Alex was very accommodating and helpful with any questions we had. He made sure we enjoyed our time and had suggestions for things to do to make sure we had a great experience.
5242712,55743020,2015-12-05,1711256,Ryan,"My girlfriend and I loved this place.

Alex was really good about helping us feel welcome and included. He made recommendations as to what places to check out, and he left maps, restaurant guides, and periodicals about Seattle on the kitchen table for us.

I'm very much a fan - we may come back to this location when we are next in Seattle."
5242712,56971903,2015-12-20,815283,Elad,"Flat was as expected. Clean and tidy. Location was great, despite costly parking costs. "
7957689,48900711,2015-09-29,14538541,Zachary,"Really cute place with a great balcony view of downtown Seattle. Location was perfect with lots to do nearby, tons of restaurants and shops. Communication with Sarah was great I would definitely recommend to a friend. "
7957689,49801322,2015-10-06,43056443,Molly,"Perfect location!!! We walked everywhere! The apartment fit all of our needs. Parking was the only difficulty in trying to coordinate between street parking or lot parking in order to save some money, but I would stay here in a heartbeat! Place was clean as well!!"
7957689,50757137,2015-10-14,31111899,Diane,"We had a wonderful stay at Sarah's!  We didn't have a car, so location was very important to us. It definitely met our needs as everything we wanted to do was around 15 minutes in walking distance between Capitol Hill and downtown/waterfront area. Sarah left us a fantastic list of places to eat and check out and coordination with Sarah and her friend that met us for our keys were easy going and responsive to our schedule. We would definitely recommend to our friends! Thanks again Sarah! "
6375415,34234337,2015-06-06,33878849,Alexander,Jean's house is beautiful and it was big enough for us three men during our stay. The living room with the typical American kitchen is georgeous. Jean is very friendly and a good host. The house is located in a very beautiful part of Seattle.
6375415,34792989,2015-06-12,256501,Cynthia,"A Ballard Blessing!!!!  What a wonderful place to host our family with room for everyone right in our own neighborhood.  Fully stocked kitchen and darling Ikea decor made it a pleasurable stay.  Plus it has the most amazing view of Mt. Rainier I've ever seen outside the Space Needle.  You'll also enjoy the courtyard out back.

Great location, right on the D-line bus to get you downtown.  An Enterprise Rent-a-Car is also just up the road.  Much within walking distance including Honore Bakery, Delancy Pizza, El Camion (Mexican) and Top Banana Fruit Stand. Don't miss Scandinavian Specialties too for a taste of the local culture.  Sunday Farmer's Market also a must-do.  An indoor city swimming pool is across the street as well as a running track.

Parking can be an issue but we only had one night when we didn't get a street spot.  There is a garage but you'll need a small car and a steady hand to get in.   It can be done!

This is urban living at it's finest which may include noise if warm weather requires the windows to be open.  Air-conditioning is rare in homes here.  But if you are lucky enough to have great weather like we did it's a fair trade.  Room fans create some white-noise and it cools down at night.

Jean's townhouse was perfect for our family of five.  Enough privacy and bathrooms for all and a warm, welcoming living area to spend time together. She's thought of all the details in the kitchen right down to chopsticks!  I highly recommend!!!"
6375415,35675387,2015-06-21,9522619,Dave,"Jean was very easy to communicate with and provided detailed arrival instructions.  The townhouse was very clean and well prepared for our arrival with fresh towels and bedding.  The kitchen and living area on the 2nd floor was well designed and convenient of our group which was there for business, so we were able to create a makeshift office and had plenty of space for our files and materials.  The bedrooms on the 3rd floor each had a bathroom with plenty of space and even shampoo, conditioner, and body soap for our use.  Overall this was the best AirBnB experience I've had now out of 4.  I highly recommend this townhouse.  Oh, and although we were working with little free time to explore, we did find the town of Ballard with its restaurants and bars very convenient and a short drive away.  "
6375415,36840932,2015-07-01,15668778,Thomas,"The place is clean, beautiful, and well-lit -as advertised. Our family of five found it quite comfortable. Jean was responsive and efficient. She came through for us with very short notice and was easy to work with throughout our stay. The garage was a tight fit for our rental SUV but we had no trouble finding street parking just a few steps out the front door. I love the little balcony just off the living room: a perfect spot for mom and dad to sit and enjoy a cup of coffee but still keep an eye on what the kids are doing!"
6375415,37655743,2015-07-09,19931581,Whitney,My family and I had a wonderful time at Jean's house! It was beautiful! She even left a new stuffed animal for my daughter to have which was such a sweet thing to do. Ballard is such a great neighborhood and it's so close to everything. The Mexican restaurant El Camion is just a short walk away and it's very good! The house is just 15 min away from city center downtown which is great for sightseeing. The house was very well appointed with everything we needed in the bathrooms and kitchen. We would definitely stay here again! 
6375415,38134734,2015-07-13,34110907,L,"This condo was beautiful, Jean was in contact with us through out the whole trip. This was our first experience using airbnb and I was very impressed."
6375415,38551578,2015-07-16,37852507,Michael,"Jean's house is conveniently located but yet the neighborhood is quiet.  The house is well equipped and maintained.  Jean is very responsive to my messages and answers.  All those have helped my first Airbnb experience and my first visit to Seattle a very pleasant one. 
I recommend this place to stay.
"
6375415,40323130,2015-07-30,33669186,Angie,"Beautiful place to stay. Was outfitted with all the essentials needed to make it feel homey. Great location, close to most everything. We had no problem finding street parking all day/night long. Would stay again if we come back to Seattle. "
6375415,42842602,2015-08-16,1390271,Elizabeth,"We rented Jean's townhouse so friends and I could stay under one roof, and we were so happy with the experience! The house was beautifully clean and tidy, with enough linens and a great kitchen. We liked the location because it was far enough out of downtown Seattle to be able to feel like we were able to get to all of the various (and cool) neighbourhoods in the surrounding areas. Around the corner from the house is an amazing French bakery, (so tasty!) and a brunch place listed as the best brunch in Seattle. So, worth a visit if you don't mind waiting! There's a track to run on near the house if you feel like sprinting a few laps, and parking was ample. The house was also a safe place for a small child, which our group had. Jean was kind and attentive throughout the whole process, including providing little details for the baby. Also, the kitchen was perfect for making feasts and we had a fabulous time! Thank you for everything Jean! "
6375415,47634084,2015-09-21,35324110,Daniela,"I stayed at the house for 2 nights with 6 other girlfriends. We came from San Francisco to hang out with our Seattle friends for a bachelorette party. 
The house was great, very comfortable and perfect for a group of girls

I'm familiar with Seattle so knew about the neighborhood and was perfect for us. 

Only bad thing was once we already had checked out, I received a message from  Jean asking if more than 7 people stayed at the house. 
When the cleaner came at 9:55 she saw 10 girls outside the house and assumed we had all spent the night. With us, the cleaner was super nice and apologized for being a bit early but then lied and said we checked out late. 
If it wasn't for this, I would give a 5 star and would recommend it. "
6375415,48679498,2015-09-28,33931485,Laura,"Jean was friendly, efficient, and wonderful to work with. The house was clean, neat, cozy, and exactly as pictured. It's a great little spot close to a lot of wonderful restaurants. I'd recommend this place to anyone looking to explore Seattle. It's wonderful that bedrooms are on separate floors for added privacy when staying in a group. "
6375415,50077238,2015-10-09,40605305,Stella,很不错的房子，适合我们一家六口出行，房东Jean 准备得非常周到，甚至有宝宝餐具和备用的床品，房间里面也很方便清洁，易于维护，我们度过了很愉快的一周.住所周围有Safeway 和Walgreen ，离wholefoods 也不远，位置很好.就在Ballard 高中边上.离pike市场和Seattle Center 仅十五分钟车程
6375415,50865067,2015-10-15,33460771,Jomer,"The place was perfect for our group of 7.  It was in a nice and quiet neighborhood, easily driveable to a lot of the places we wanted to visit during our trip.  I'd definitely recommend this spot for groups larger than 5.   Jean was easy to contact and quick to respond whenever I had a question."
6375415,51346802,2015-10-19,45413527,Peder,Home was great.  First Airbnb experience and first time to Ballard and really liked it.  A lot around and Jean was also very responsive and gave some fun suggestions on what to do in the area.  Really enjoyed our stay!! 
6375415,52101296,2015-10-26,45214312,Nathanael,"Jean is very responsive and easy to work with.  The townhouse is nice, as advertised.  The housekeeper showed up right at checkout time."
6375415,53101018,2015-11-04,37265317,Zareen," This is my 1st experience with Airbnb, and it's amazing. The room I chose for one night staying in Seattle was beautiful, clean, cozy and convenient. Perfect for a family with or without children. It has all we wanted. The location is very close to the shopping centre and restaurants. The rooms are spacious and the beds are so comfortable and I had very good sleep. Thank you Jean for offering this wonderful home and I will definitely rebook this place when I visit Seattle next year. "
6375415,54279693,2015-11-17,48298459,Ma,"This is my first Air Bnb experience. I was traveling with my colleague. We had a wonderful time in Jean's house. It was clean and in good position. Only 7 miles to space needle. We checked out the place by running. If you are trying to find a place like home and hang out with your friends, that is a good option."
6375415,54888923,2015-11-25,21389011,Matt,"We enjoyed our stay at Jean's place.  Check in and out was a breeze with the instructions and lock box left by Jean.  The place was very comfortable, spacious and clean.  Located in a residential neighborhood with several new townhouses coming up and a school across the street, it was very quiet and comfortable.  But we didn't spend too much time in the immediate area around the house."
4477426,25259366,2015-01-10,14447595,Alfred,"Very quick and easy communication, smooth transaction. House is super clean; as Chef Micah is neat and organized, typical Chef nature hehe. Plenty amenities and open kitchen. Micah took the time to inform us about the neighborhood, socialize a bit, and recommended wonderful restaurants around town. Stayed only one night, but will definitely stay again!"
4477426,26659886,2015-02-16,19622449,Alisa,"great! micah's place is perfectly located / far enough from bars and freeways to get a good nights sleep, but everything a short distance"
4477426,27980394,2015-03-15,2563102,Aj,Absolutely loved my stay with Micah in Seattle. His home is beautiful and in a great location close to downtown and international district. Micah is great host he made us welcome and was very flexible with the checkout time. He is also very knowledgeable about restaurants in Seattle and recommended many great spots to checkout during the stay. Definitely look forward to staying with Micah next time I am in Seattle. 
4477426,29153167,2015-04-04,986397,Dorinda,"Micah was a great host: fast communication, seamless booking/check-in and -out. He was not there on the night that we visited, yet made sure we got in and had everything we needed. 

The house is clean, quiet, and airy, done with simplicity and warmth. Guest bedroom had crisp new bedding and insulated windows with light-damping honeycomb blinds. If you love food, you'll drool over his collection of cookbooks. The neighborhood is peaceful. 

A positive experience, and recommended stay."
4477426,29765672,2015-04-12,21358572,Hamilton,"Micah was a wonderful host.  I felt completely at home and had the run of the house.  The location of the neighborhood was perfect for the purpose of my trip.  I could grab an Uber and be exactly where I needed to be within 15 minutes and about $9.  

I would definitely recommend staying with Micah to anyone looking to stay in the Portland area.   Since Micah is a chef for one of the nations top restaurants, he can certainly tell you the special places in town to have a unique culinary experience.  "
4477426,30203871,2015-04-19,3003204,Tristan,"Micah was a good host.  We got to try his rhubarb dessert, and it was delicious.  His place was a little further from downtown than I would have liked, but I probably should have done due diligence and checked that before booking the place."
4477426,32151567,2015-05-14,4495782,Markus,"Micah is an amazing host! Very welcoming and full of great ideas what to and especially where to eat. He provided amazing free range/organic breakfast. If you want to spend an amazing time in a great place, possibly discussing food, Micah is the person to come to."
4477426,32380414,2015-05-17,31948175,Grace And Franck,Micah has a beautiful and cozy home. He was very flexible with our late check in and gave us great recommendations before and during our stay. The neighborhood seems very safe and is close to some good local spots. Parking was easy as well. I would recommend staying with Micah if you are visiting Seattle!
4477426,32719343,2015-05-20,32800757,Brock,Micah was awesome! He was very welcoming and helped us with suggestions on places to eat and things to see. We did most of them and were not disappointed. His place was very nice and the bed was very comfortable. 
4477426,33251147,2015-05-26,29403823,Cindy,"Micah was a great host and we enjoyed our stay! His townhouse is beautiful and the room was comfortable for two. Located in a safe neighborhood close to public transit, Micah's home is a short drive or bus ride from downtown Seattle.

We did not get the opportunity to spend much time with our host as we were out and about for most of the trip. When we first arrived, he offered a lot of great suggestions for places to go, neighborhoods to visit, and places to eat. We would love to stay with Micah again the next time we're in Seattle!"
4477426,33677754,2015-05-31,31099711,Esmeralda,"Unfortunately, we didn't get to meet Micah, but my husband and I are very happy with the accommodations.  Everything was in place and clean.  The neighborhood was safe and we didn't mind the distance to the downtown area.  We also appreciated the flexibility with our check-in and check-out times.  "
4477426,34957152,2015-06-14,30534355,Jennifer,"Micah was very accommodating and helpful during my short trip with a friend in Seattle. He was there the first day to give us a lot of good tips and he had a beautiful home. We either took the bus which is a short walk from his house or uber to get downtown, both which got us there very quickly (~10 mins). We enjoyed our stay very much and Micah was a great person to meet. Thanks for everything!"
4477426,35822616,2015-06-22,33943549,Michael,"This was a really great spot not to far from downtown (15-20 minute walk, 5 minute cab ride). Lots of room and good outdoor space too. We didn't spend a lot of time there but it was a great place to rest and recharge.  Micah wasn't around that weekend so we had the whole place to ourselves!  Which is a really great deal for the price. I recommend this place to anybody staying in the area. "
4477426,36272516,2015-06-27,8700862,Hanna,"We had a great stay at Micah's house in Seattle. Communication before arrival was always fast and friendly. Micah is a welcoming and friendly host, and I would highly recommen staying at his place."
4477426,36804391,2015-07-01,34979224,Brian,"Micah is really really really awesome and handsome guy!!! 
His place is so beautiful and there is everything you need to stay comfy!  
He allowed us to use kitchen so i could cooked for my girlfriend! 
There is always parking spaces in the neighborhood and it's safe
Thank you Micah for the best airbnb experience! "
4477426,37156654,2015-07-05,31978632,Yu Ren,Micah is a warm young man and his room for rent is fine especially clean. Micah help me to use Uber to rent taxi. We have good relation. Thank Micah!
4477426,37459342,2015-07-07,2045752,Julia,"We enjoyed staying at Micah's. Very clean, spacious and comfortable apartment and not too far from the city centre. Also reasonably close to Pike/Vine in Capitol Hill. Micah was away during our stay so we didn't have the good fortune of meeting him."
4477426,37741299,2015-07-10,31155714,Carlene,"Great Seattle accomodation at an affordable price. Very nice condo, comfortable bed and everything supplied that was needed for our short stay. Easy access to local attractions, restaurants and street parking."
4477426,38027134,2015-07-12,36631139,Rose,Micah returned emails and answered all our questions immediately.  We did not get to meet him as he was away.  The neighborhood was nice and easy to walk to restaurants.
4477426,38331766,2015-07-14,29481621,John & Melissa,"Such a well appointed and cozy home.  I felt so welcomed and was certainly in no rush to leave.  It's truly unfortunate I was not able to spend more time, but I will definitely make it a point to try and stay at Micah's home on a future return to Seattle. Micah, thank you for opening your home and making me feel like family. 

Cheers!
John"
4477426,39278436,2015-07-22,31754425,Kevin,Great place in nice neighborhood.  Close to several bus lines.  Within walking distance of some great places to eat and drink.   Clean and as described.   Micah gave fantastic recommendations on where to eat and drink in Seattle.   Spot on!  Great chef with lots of world traveling experience.   A real pleasure staying here. 
4477426,40226134,2015-07-29,14022664,Ligaya,"Micah is a great host. I love his place- very clean, safe and close to center of the city. He's very flexible and easy to communicate with.  As a very accomplished and successful Chef, we had a very interesting conversations especially about food!  
I would recommend his place anytime.  Thanks a lot Micah and thanks for introducing me to Uber- my other new best friend!
Best, 
Ligaya "
4477426,42281453,2015-08-12,20326580,Amy,"We missed Micah on our visit to Seattle but his house was gorgeous and was in a great location. It was really easy to get downtown with the various bus routes that ran within a 5/6 minute walking radius of the house. The room was comfortable for two people, and Micah was very responsive with my questions. Thank you again for letting us stay in your beautiful house!"
4477426,42839218,2015-08-16,31782560,Dani,"Micah was very communicative with the arrangements and we had no troubles at all finding our way to the house and making ourselves comfortable. His town house was wonderful, with a beautiful interior. It was a little further from downtown then expected, but seemingly close to the Seahawks Stadium (which was perfect for us) and still in walking distance to downtown (about 25minutes). Micah provided all essentials needed (towles, bedding etc.) which was very helpful, sadly we did not get to meet him personally."
4477426,43540877,2015-08-20,39364498,Julien,"We did not see Micah during our stay but we enjoyed his house. 
Great house, Great room. 
It was a little bit hot without AC due to the exceptionnal temperature we had. The neibourghood is quiet. "
4477426,43786574,2015-08-22,35499652,Magda,"Very friendly, perfect communication and great accommodation! Thank you! "
4477426,45058610,2015-08-31,19562592,Ramona,"Micah war leider bei unserem Aufenthalt nicht zu Hause. So hatten wir das ganze Haus für uns. Das Haus war sehr sauber. Es liegt etwas ausserhalb des Zentrums. Mit dem Bus fährt man eine gute Viertelstunde in die City (2,75$ pro Person, kein Wechselgeld!). Ein Pluspunkt war, dass wir die Waschmaschine und den Trockner benutzen durften. Wir würden wieder hier übernachten!"
4477426,45942028,2015-09-07,31845822,Rene,"We had a wonderful stay at Micah's beautiful home. It is very well appointed and the kitchen is truly a chef's domain, down to the copper whisking bowls.
Micah responded promptly to any enquiry and made excellent suggestions for places to wine and dine, it was very much appreciated.
We walked eveywhere from the house and it's a pleasant walk through lovely streets to Capitol Hill where there are lots of great restaurants and excellent coffee to be had. 
We had a great first time stay in Seattle at Micah's"
8869027,51400031,2015-10-19,2577876,Zoe,"Christopher's place was amazing, I don't think we could of had a better experience! Stylish, clean, central...everything we could of wished for! Would definitely pick this place over any other ones if I return to Seattle."
8869027,52451595,2015-10-29,33170435,Dominik,"Leider haben wir Christopher nicht persönlich kennengelernt, die Wohnung hat uns ein Bekannter gezeigt. Die Kommunikation hat jedoch gut funktioniert und die Wohnung war super!! Die wichtigsten Sehenswürdigkeiten sind alle zu Fuss erreichbar (10 min zur Pine/Pike-Street). Wir würden diese Unterkunft sofort wieder buchen und haben uns rundum wohl gefühlt."
8869027,53007110,2015-11-03,27439795,Kristen,"If we were to use one word to describe our experience at Christopher's, it would be....impeccable.  Christopher was an impeccable host, and his apartment was impeccably cleaned and appointed.  Meeting him was a pleasure, he had a welcome letter and chocolates set up. He gave us the rundown on his place, and he had curated a comprehensive list of local eateries for us, and he even helped us out with parking in his neighborhood!!   Christopher had set out an amazing selection of Aveda soaps and shampoos, and he may have had the most comfortable couch we've ever sat on!!

 Speaking about neighborhoods, Christopher's apartment is on a great residential street in Seattle, which is in walking distance of Pioneer Square, downtown Seattle, and Pikes Place market.  There is a coffee shop in the building, and a deli across the street.

We had a fantastic experience at Christopher's and we have no reservations about referring him to anyone looking for a great place to stay in Seattle."
8869027,54150747,2015-11-16,2460804,Jennifer,Christopher's place was fantastic! Everything was immaculate. He was easy to reach and had thought of everything any guest would need. I would happily stay there again!
8869027,54898633,2015-11-25,494507,Elizabeth,"Christopher was an outstanding host during our stay in Seattle. Accommodating from the onset, we were welcomed with a smile, and had the pleasure of staying in his gorgeous flat. Easy walkable to all of the ""touristy"" spots, but also accessible to neighborhoods you'd like to spend some time getting to know. Would highly recommend staying at Christopher's place!"
8869027,55228717,2015-11-29,47398769,David,"I have to agree with all of the the other reviews posted.  Christopher was a very gracious host.  His place was immaculate.  We had Thanksgiving dinner there and his kitchen was well equipped and supplied.  As described, his apartment is walkable distance to all of the Seattle downtown sights.  We parked our car in the optional underground parking but only needed it to visit our son up in Shoreline.  Our first AirBNB experience and it was a great one.  Thanks, Christopher!"
8869027,55954255,2015-12-07,10476328,Marci,"Loved my stay at Christopher's. His home is comfortable and decorated beautifully.

The bed was like sleeping on a cloud with marshmallows on top.
Heaven!"
8869027,56496917,2015-12-14,47277278,Kevin,Christopher unfortunately could not meet us when we arrived but he arranged someone to take his place to hand us the keys. His place was just as beautiful as the photos made it out to be! It was a nice place to stay for the weekend! The location was perfect for walking to just about everywhere we wanted to go. He was always very polite when we communicated and always responded promptly to any questions I had.
8869027,57784504,2015-12-29,38516485,Julie,Christopher's place was immaculately clean and very cozy. The bed and pillows were one of the most comfortable we've stayed in. The location is central and Christopher was a wonderful host. Definitely would come back here. 
8869027,58315849,2016-01-02,2385729,Brenda,"Christopher's place is amazing! My husband and I didn't get a chance to meet him, but Christopher made sure everything was organized and the key drop off went really smooth. His apartment is nicely decorated and so clean! We had a great time, very central and a close walk to bus lines."
226495,1193276,2012-04-28,325898,Ty,"This tiny spot was perfect for me and my coworkers. We ran to Seattle for a two day trip and this crash pad was perfect. The communication was easy and the vibe was chill. When we all ended up there after our event at 3am--and it took us a while to settle in (cold pizza and laughs anyone?) they were awesome about our late arrivals. Such great guests---the kind of people that make you feel like you are staying with friends. We all crammed into this place and it was great.

The one and only drawback---it was cold. Don't worry they have space heaters---but yikes...daddy was freezing.
"
226495,1576319,2012-06-27,2555230,Andrea,Lovely apartment in a great neighborhood.  Close to great restaurants  and even found a Zumba class within walking distance. Apartment was very clean and had all the suppies we needed. Owners went out of their way to accomodate our arrival time and make us feel welcome.
226495,1692770,2012-07-12,2317406,Rhema,"We had a great time and felt very comfortable in the ""fun""  apartment. Clean, nicely furnished and well appointed. Our hosts wee charming and made us feel very welcome. Would recommend."
226495,1722535,2012-07-16,2732947,Steffan,"This brightly decorated basement abode was perfect for our summer family stay in Seattle. Great balance of convenience, functionality and price."
226495,1984660,2012-08-14,2859132,Amber,"The apartment was easy to find. Check in was a breeze, The hosts, Glen and Rose Marie, are nice friendly people! There was plenty of space for two adults and two teenage girls. The beds are comfortable and I slept like a rock. The property is well maintained and the area is safe and relatively quiet for a major city. The kitchen is well equipped with more than one wine bottle opener - whew :) We did not want for anything. There are extra blankets, plenty of pillows, dvd's, plenty of towels, hand towels, washclothes, etc. If you go swimming or any summer water activity then bring beach towels. My boyfriend and I went for a late evening walk every night and felt like we were at home only 30 degrees cooler. This property is conveniently located and we could be in downtown Seattle within minutes. This is my fourth or fifth visit to Seattle and I would love to stay in the property again on future visits. Thanks Glen and Rose Marie!

On things to do: Ballard Locks, Fremont Flea Market, Fremont Troll, the rose garden at the zoo are just a few of the few things we did for FREE. The park adjacent to Ballard Locks has free live music during the summer on weekends - check w/ parks and rec...they even provided folding chairs! The view from Bank of America Bldg Columbia Center is cheaper than the space needle and it's the tallest buidling in downtown Seattle with a nearly 360 degree view. It's not for people that are terrified of heights..just riding the elevators to the 73 floor makes my tummy squeamish :) but I lived thru the experience. It's quite the view. $9 for adults, less for students and children. Cheapest downtown all day weekend parking is the City Centre/US Bank parking garage near Pike/Pine/Union I think? The entrance is a pain to find but well worth only paying $6 to park all day. It's a short walk to PIke's Place, the waterfront and tons of shopping."
226495,2071371,2012-08-23,2449601,Gary,Rose and Glen met us at the apartment and gave us a walk-through. They were very friendly and we had a good conversation about things to see and do. Our stay at the apt was very nice and the accommodations were just right. Would definetly stay here again!
226495,5731680,2013-07-14,6456417,Harry,"We stayed in this wonderful apartment for six days during our trip visiting friends on the Seattle area.  The apartment easily accommodated myself, my wife, or two young kids, my sister-in-law and my brother-in-law.

The apartment was convenient and an easy drive everywhere we needed to go.

Being partially below ground helped keep the apartment nice and cool during the heat wave that hit for part of our stay in July.

We would not hesitate to stay here again."
226495,5863900,2013-07-20,1030766,Brian,"Lovely hosts, kitchen fit the bill, slept like a babe. My sister and I shared the place for a week, we both loved it. I think you will need a car to see downtown Seattle but others might be able to negotiate public transit. "
226495,6058783,2013-07-28,4071510,Simmone,"Rose and Glen were superb hosts.  The apartment was perfect for a quick business trip with an ideal location in the hippest neighborhood.  The apartment itself was an urban oasis with an adorable outdoor in the front and back.  Although there is a kitchen, I didn't get any use out of it except for the microwave, which did not disappoint.  The first night I was there, Rose and Glen drove me into Fremont (totally unexpected!) and I was able to easily find my way back on my own.  I would highly recommend this cute apartment!"
226495,6419705,2013-08-12,6295074,Kelli,Glen & Rose's Ballard house was cozy and tidy! They were friendly and helpful. We loved our stay there and would come back!
226495,6913960,2013-08-30,7221545,Jill,"We had a wonderful stay in Seattle. Glen and Rose were very quick to respond to our queries. Great appartment. We used the 28 bus into Seattle, bus stop was very close and buses were on time. Would recommend to others. Great holiday. Thank you."
226495,7011185,2013-09-03,6624177,Jacqueline,"Very handy, pleasant space with room for everyone and excellent facilities for cooking or BBQ. Appreciated meeting glen and his friendly tips for getting around and loved finding the local map book in the suite. It was convenient to downtown Seattle, and pubs and restaurants & groceries were within walking distance. We only wish it were closer to the groovy heart of old Ballard. Would recommend to anyone to stay. The main bed was super comfortable. Thank you Rose & Glen"
226495,7336686,2013-09-16,5303060,Rebecca,"Very comfortable home with all the necessities. Close to a few stores and near bus routes, which can take you downtown or to other neighborhoods in Seattle. Rose and Glen were also awesome with their communication and making sure we felt at home! Thanks!"
226495,8996100,2013-12-01,9250584,Donna,It is a cheery little place that makes you smile. Had everything we needed and a great location. We will definitely return! 
226495,12737392,2014-05-09,12693514,Emma,The reservation was canceled 111 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
226495,13868346,2014-06-06,13446938,Tiina,"Rose and Glen were wonderful! They greeted us at the door and showed around the place. The apartment was charming and our 6-person group fit there nicely. The neighborhood was nice and quiet with a good grocery store closed by.

We really enjoyed our stay! :)"
226495,14157581,2014-06-13,5356266,Michael,"I had a wonderful stay at Rose and Glen's place. They are very kind and nice to talk to. Whenever there is an issue or question, they are very quick at responding or resolving it. They also don't live on site, so I feel I have great privacy. The place is neat and clean. It's not new and shiny, but it's very cozy and charming. The bed was comfortable and kitchen is well stocked with cooking utensils, and there are plenty of glasses and chinaware. The bathroom is very clean and has lots of towels!

The place is not without any caveat. One thing is that it's near a major road, so it could be loud for the whole evening. I absolutely have no problem falling asleep, but my mom had a hard time. Additionally, since the upstairs unit may also be occupied, one can certainly hear them if they get a bit loud. Maybe they feel the same thing about us."
226495,14488403,2014-06-20,16505223,Timothy,We stayed there for three nights. The location is good and it's easy to find. The host is nice. We will come again in the nearly future if possible. 
226495,14580901,2014-06-22,12734157,Jamie,Great hosts and a wonderful spot thank you guys much for making our trip complete would definitely stay here again Thanks
226495,14969953,2014-06-30,11550636,Tracy,"This is an easy place to stay if you plan to be visiting various locations in north or central Seattle. It's very easy to get to and always had parking right outside. Most importantly, the beds are comfy and water pressure is great! We would stay here again!"
226495,15261401,2014-07-06,14933655,Anjan,"Rose was very nice, place was clean, all essentials are provided.  Liked the private patio out back."

226495,15780910,2014-07-15,13607664,Clare,"We really enjoyed our stay in Ballard.  The apartment had everything we needed.  Rose and Glen made us very welcome and made sure we knew where everything was. They were great re changing our check out time as well.  Easy public transport to Downtown and Ballard has a lovely park and beaches and some nice individual shops.  The apartment is close to a great bar (1000 beers!), cafes and Safeway.

"
226495,15928536,2014-07-18,3528970,Paulina And Steve,The apartment was clean and conveniently located to the University of Washington.  It would of been nice to know ahead of time that this is a basement apartment with tenants above that share the hot water heater and that this apartment is on the corner of a fairly busy street.
226495,16250366,2014-07-24,15814256,Fernand,"Très bon accueil, en français svp.  Appartement très correct dans un quartier proche de la ville par bus "
226495,18092584,2014-08-21,564104,Crystal,"Email replies were very quick from the hosts.  In person, Rose and Glen were polite and very friendly.  The place was clean and provided what we needed for a place to stay.  It was the right size for our family of 4.  
I will say that if you want to be in Ballard, near the busier scene, you have to drive there."
226495,18170127,2014-08-23,7936970,Adam,We had a terrific experience staying at Rose & Glen's lovely place in Ballard.  Glen was exceptionally friendly and made us feel immediately welcome.  The apartment was as nice as described and fit all 6 of us (close friends doubling up) comfortably.  The location was convenient and parking was no problem at all.  I would highly recommend staying here.  
226495,18551980,2014-08-28,6916385,Nao,"Rose and Glen were very friendly, nice hosts! My family enjoyed their stay at this house very much. Parking is always available for one car in front of the house so you don't have to drive around the block to find a spot. I also liked the neighborhood. "
226495,21704060,2014-10-22,20553867,Weizhong,"The apartment looks really nice, with a unique interior design and all the utilities needed for a long stay. Rose and Glen are very warm and helpful, answered a lot of questions that we have about the apartment and the area around, since it' our fist time in the city. And it is located in close distnce to I-5, which makes it convenient to go to everywhere. I would recommend this apartment to anyone that's going to stay in Seattle for long."
226495,27660988,2015-03-09,20402024,Nick,"A very well-laid out and clean space in the heart of North Ballard.  Stayed there for about a month and had no complaints--functional kitchen, comfortable bed, everything one needs!  "
226495,27947814,2015-03-15,27864567,Anne,Apt was as nice as pictured. Plenty of hot water and towels. Close to our family living in Ballard. 
226495,36009126,2015-06-24,30848782,Kristina,"Rose and Glen were very nice.  The Apartment was great for what we needed it for. We have a full crew of people and we all fit nicely. The Apartment is close to Chuck’s Hop Shop, which is a great little place to unwind.  We found ourselves there multiple times during our stay. "
226495,36218215,2015-06-26,34544766,Lizbeth,"Pros:  Clean space with comfy beds at a fair price; friendly hosts hard at work to assure a clean unit when we arrived; groceries and some restaurants walkable; hosts were responsive during our stay; we flubbed the checkout time by 30 minutes and then left with the key - which we brought right back - and hosts were understanding. Cons: Noticeable, sometimes loud, street noise when the (ground level) windows were open - this is a partial basement - although air stuffy when windows were closed; footsteps of main house guests overhead may disturb some (our party was divided on this); washing machine broken and we could not start dishwasher. Although we would opt for a non-basement when options abound, this place was safe and clean and met our needs at a busy time of year. "
226495,36544178,2015-06-29,33377804,Erin,Rose & Glenn were great hosts.  The apartment location was perfect for our needs and the neighborhood was quiet and easy for parking. We would def. stay there again. :)  
226495,38261602,2015-07-14,20175023,Joanne,"The host met me on site and showed me the amenities of the  apartment. It was perfect for four adults. The neighborhood was safe and there as ample parking. Washer/dryer and dishwasher were included, which was very handy."
226495,39157783,2015-07-21,31906021,Jennifer,"This cozy apartment was nice a clean upon arrival! It's a basement apartment, so it stayed nice and cool in the scorching summer heat which was a plus! The neighborhood was nicely located near fun bars and restaurants. Bathroom was wonderful- lots of fresh and fluffy white towels. When we had an issue getting the washer going, the hosts were more than accommodating about getting it working for us in a jiffy! "
226495,40202511,2015-07-29,27840647,Michelle,"Rose and Glen were great communicators, extremely friendly, and a pleasure to work with. We were scheduled to get into Seattle before the check in time and they were more than accommodating and let us drop off our bags early so we wouldn't have to carry them around with us. Due to personal circumstances, they weren't able to show us around the property personally when we checked in, but we had no problem getting the key and getting settles. 

Seattle has very strict rules about recycling and garbage disposal that Rose and Glen did make us aware of--if you're not from a similar area you may find this a challenge to remember--but there are signs posted that we found helpful. 

The only negatives were the washer that was broken--they did try to work with us on this and graciously offered to wash clothes for us--and the dishwasher that we only discovered was broken as we went to press ""start"" the morning we were set to check out. These were minor inconveniences, but still a little inconvenient when those are two main benefits of renting an entire house. 

The other note I would be aware of is that a lot of sound comes through from the apartment above. The first few days there were people staying who liked late nights and lots of giggling. It was very difficult for us to fall asleep--especially still on East Coast time. The second group that stayed was not as bad, but we still heard every step they took or joke they told. The red bedroom is also a bit warm at night.

Overall, we enjoyed our stay and really appreciated the lengths that Rose and Glen went through to accommodate us and communicate despite their own change in plans. I would recommend this place to others for sure, just beware of the noise factor."
226495,40895826,2015-08-03,27005665,Melissa,"Great little basement apartment. It remained pleasant, despite the record-breaking heat wave. There were box fans to keep the air moving, but opening windows at night kept the temperature down. The location is convenient to several neighborhood shopping areas and an easy trip downtown. We could occasionally hear the family upstairs, but it was nothing out of the ordinary. We would stay here again when visiting our family."
226495,42135918,2015-08-11,5318065,Julia,"Nice apartment not too far from the main Ballard restaurant/bar/market area. Glen was friendly and easy to communicate with; he met us at the unit, let us check in a little early in order to get to an event, and even recommended restaurants and a Lyft driver. The apartment was clean and well appointed with two nice outside areas. My only complaint would be that the walls are pretty thin and the people staying (or living- I wasn't sure if it was a rental or home) upstairs were loud, stomping around early in the morning and late at night."
226495,43940079,2015-08-23,36538981,Kim,Host was very accommodating. Property was clean and fully stocked with necessities and any inquiries were responded to quickly. Great location.
226495,45264323,2015-09-01,33410106,Eric,"""Fun apartment"" met all expectations. The unit, smaller of two, is downstairs from a somewhat larger unit. Rose was always responsive, and was there to show us the details of our space when we arrived. With 2 bedrooms and a fold out couch in the living room, we were able to accommodate the 5 of us. One bathroom did create a bottleneck at times. ""Fun apartment"" served our needs well."
226495,46138073,2015-09-08,9183175,Alyssa,"The place was great and the neighborhood was awesome! We had a great stAy here. At one point, rose happened to be at the place (with my welcomed permission) during a wardrobe malfunction (long story) and she went above and beyond to be helpful. I recommend this as a great affordable option to stay in Seattle!  "
107962,335108,2011-06-26,574158,John,"We came to Seattle to escape the insane summer heat of Dallas. This was our first reservation/stay arranged through AirBnB and we truly loved our stay at Roberta's place. It is like a green oasis in the middle of the city, a charming little cabin only a few steps from a small, clear and quiet lake with its unexpected residents of trout, bald eagles, osprey and many ohers. The cabin had everything we needed to make our stay comfy but what I loved most was the large upstairs window facing the lake where we enjoyed looking at all the birds and the playful squirrels racing up the trees nearby. We would LOVE to come back and stay longer, Roberta made us feel so welcome."
107962,401104,2011-07-27,557020,Arsen,"Just about any English superlative-st adjective I can use to describe this place is going to be inadequate and insufficient for the purpose of this review. I would rather mention some details we particularly appreciated in no particular order: 

Spotlessly clean inside and outside, small but well designed interior, complete privacy unless you want to chat with the smiling neighbors, dock on the lake with several chairs and two paddle boats, a selection of fishing poles for the guests, fresh fruits on the table on our arrival, every effort made by our hosts to make our stay comfortable and enjoyable. And my fiance who is currently working on her English says the correct spelling in this case should be ""Hosts"".  

After Seattle,  Helen and I stayed a few days at MGM Grand in Las Vegas - in all fairness I should say that the place is very ""grand"" and quite ""nice"" if I am using the adjectives correctly.

Roberta and Dan - thank you very much.
"
107962,421056,2011-08-05,702486,Sharon,"We had a fantastic time.  The cabin was charming...clean, compact and very clever.  We would definitely stay there again.  Sharon"
107962,453689,2011-08-17,878144,Jodi,"What a great get-away. We had a fabulous time, felt very welcomed and cozy in the cabin. Tried the paddle boats as well as the row boat, what a beautiful lake to relax on. Thanks!"
107962,459094,2011-08-19,963279,Marci,"The cabin was just right for myself and daughter.  The lake was beautiful and we enjoyed boating and swimming, if you don't mind the fish.  

I almost hate to write a good review, because the cabin will be booked too easily and we have not yet made plans for next summer!  "
107962,474887,2011-08-25,948262,Corina,We had a delightful stay at Roberta's Haller Lake Log Cabin. The cabin was very clean and had everything we needed. Roberta was a fabulous host and even left us some fresh fruit. We loved using the rowboat out on the lake. We'd certainly come back again!
107962,510217,2011-09-07,699024,Kristiina,"So sad we had to leave this beautiful place!  My husband had just returned from a deployment to Iraq and we thought this would be a wonderful way to spend a week together re-connecting.  It was perfect!  The cabin is perfect for 2.  The views are beautiful, the surroundings are just right!  

We had the best of both worlds as we could wake up in peace and tranquility and then spend the day in Seattle or any cities that were just a hop, skip and jump.

The lake was perfect for swimming, laying out on the dock, trying to catch fish and using the paddle boats to get around the water.

Accomodations were wonderful.  The hosts were so friendly and even showed us the larger home they rent out too.  That was unbelieveable as well and we'll be sure to be back with the family next time to enjoy that piece of heaven as well.

Next time we are bringing our flotation toys for the water... we could have spent all day out there.

Thank you Dan and Roberta for providing such a beautiful place that we will definately come back to many more times.

God Bless You Both (and see you next Summer!).

Jason & Kristiina"
107962,515339,2011-09-09,795304,Carol,Absolutely fabulous !!!!  The cabin is cozy and comfortable. The views of the lake are beautiful as well as the surroundings. My husband describes it as a sanctuary in the hustle and bustle of life. We would definately stay again when in the area. Great job Roberta and Dan.....
107962,518901,2011-09-10,979923,Bev,"We absolutely LOVED the precious cabin on Haller Lake. And Roberta had everything covered.  Was just enough ""roughin it"" but close to all the Seattle conveniences, but who needed them?  Also this cabin is close to grocers if you need supplies .... actually within a couple minutes. ( Something not mentioned on Roberta's website )."
107962,522755,2011-09-12,76810,Christy,"Were we somewhere near Leavenworth, or in the Methow Valley or any one of a number of amazing locations in the WA mountains?  It sure felt like it!!!  Staying on a pristine spring-fed lake right in the city (and a close walk to much needed coffee shops), was truly amazing!  I grew up in Seattle and live 8-10 minutes from this property but had no idea this lake existed!  We decided to do a ""stay-cation"".  My 2 year old son LOVED it.  We went paddle boating in the boats they had available for us and we just enjoyed the serenity and beautiful scenery.  It didn't hurt that the weekend was in the 80s and the moon was almost full!  Truly an unforgettable weekend (and once we were all packed up and had to go home, it was a ten minute drive!).  I highly recommend it but almost hesitate to because it's such a secret gem.  Thanks Roberta!"
107962,545283,2011-09-19,906427,Marisa,"Roberta & Dan's cabin is absolutely wonderful!  I booked it for my visiting in-laws and they completely adored the location and amenities.  My father-in-law especially loved getting up early and going fishing in the lake or just taking in the peaceful scenery.  Roberta was easy to work with and very accommodating, even when my in-laws flight was delayed and did not come in until late evening.  I would highly recommend staying here to anyone, and we certainly look forward to booking this cabin or their larger house when we have more visitors."
107962,569878,2011-09-26,837448,Lynne,"We thoroughly enjoyed the peacefulness we found at the Haller Lake Log cabin.  It was perfect after the busy days getting our daughter settled at UW.  Roberta's communication before, during, and after our stay was great.  The cabin had everything we needed.  The setting was a little oasis.  So relaxing.  Perfect short stay.  Would love to return sometime and spend a little more time on the lake.  Thank you Roberta and Dan for sharing your lovely retreat with us. "
107962,609606,2011-10-08,600025,Carl,"My son and I have been back to this cabin many times. It's a short 5 minute drive from I-5 yet when you arrive at the cabin you feel like you are miles away from the hustle and bustle of the city life. Lying in bed at night you can hear the ducks chattering on the lake. 

Roberta is great and easy to get hold of by text, email or phone. She usually always gets back to us right away. 

"
107962,621053,2011-10-11,952778,Jay,"Beautiful little cabin -- the perfect size for two. Roberta and Dan were very friendly and helped us when we needed anything. Dan had a bit of an accident with my car in the parking lot, but solved the problem quickly and professionally. I would certainly stay here again and would highly recommend the cabin."
107962,635855,2011-10-17,975366,Bethany,Loved this little place!!!Had a wonderful stay and our host was very accommodating!We hope to stay here again soon and bring our family the next time.The grounds were so beautiful too!Thanks so much!!! 
107962,658717,2011-10-24,1213799,Minna,"My husband and I chose the Downey's Haller Lake cabin as our ""homebase"" while visiting Seattle for our anniversary weekend. Roberta and Dan have done an amazing job restoring and improving upon the cabin, the main house, and the surrounding property.

We almost didn't tackle our itinerary in lieu of just hanging out at the cabin with a crackling fire in the cast iron stove. The Downey's have also provided an enclosed oil space heater (looks like an old fashioned radiator on wheels) but the cabin is so efficiently designed and well appointed with cozy blankets that the stove was all we needed.

Dan met us upon our arrival and gave us a quick tour of the grounds, filling us in on the fascinating history of the place. We didn't get a chance to meet Roberta, but she was in touch prior to our visit and during to make sure everything was in order.

I really cannot stress enough how absolutely perfect the cabin was for our vacation - it felt like a remote little pocket of heaven. The upstairs area feels like a secret treehouse hideaway. We enjoyed hot coffee and donuts (Family Donuts nearby makes truly excellent apple turnovers) on the small dock out back - we would have loved to paddle out into the water as well but just didn't have enough time!

Even though the cabin feels tucked away and remote, it's actually very convenient to I-5 and only a short drive away from downtown. We were in the Fremont neighborhood for our Theo chocolate factory tour in about ten minutes (if not less).

Both Roberta and Dan take obvious and well-deserved pride in this property. All of the little details - from the thoughtful addition of rope lighting along the meandering path down to the cabin, to the welcoming bowl of fruit, to our choice of cozy flannel sheets or crisp cotton ones on that insanely comfortable bed - have been carefully thought out and executed to make staying at this lovely cabin the best possible experience.

We will definitely be back to the cabin in future, and are considering booking the house for larger gatherings. "
107962,689868,2011-11-03,1287783,Marilyn,"We spent four nights at the Haller Lake cabin.  It was perfect in every way.  It is cozy, romantic,  very clean and the lake is right there with boats and everything.  Only 10 miles to downtown Seattle.  Loved it"
107962,733826,2011-11-21,754751,Barry,"We loved Roberta and Dan's charming cabin, and they were super-friendly, even when I failed to extricate a failed experiment from their log-splitter. Will definitely stay there again."
107962,746312,2011-11-27,1276258,Samuel,"They were awesome. Picked us up by surprise in the rain at the bus stop. They checked in with us everyday to see what we were doing, how things were going and if we needed anything else. But they also gave us privacy.

The cabin is also amazing. Beautiful location and it's close to a lot and several different bus stops. Highly recommended."
107962,757440,2011-12-01,1323750,Connie,"Super interesting log cabin with nice grounds and Haller Lake view very near Northgate Shopping Center (and my daughter's apartment).  Hosts are very gracious and accommodating, and I'm recommending the bigger house for friends visiting their children in Seattle, and may do a ""girls' weekend"" from Spokane.

For the log cabin, I'd recommend one or two persons at most and to take only light luggage and a flashlight for the walk from the parking lot near the bigger house.---especially in these dark winter months.  You might also want to take a tape player or radio for music at the cabin."
107962,778833,2011-12-12,1351117,Randy,"Very cute cabin and very accomodating host.  Lake was lovely and it is very centrally located.  If staying in winter - it takes quite a while for cabin to heat, so bring lots of warm clothes!"
107962,797240,2011-12-20,411594,Andrew,Roberta and Dan have a great little cabin in a beautiful location.  It was quite and cozy and we wish we could have stayed longer.
107962,806111,2011-12-26,1309013,James,"We loved the log cabin at Lake Haller.  It was charming, very private and met all our needs.  We didn't spend much time there since we were visiting our daughter and grandchildren in Queen Anne.  During the spring, summer or fall, when you could spend more time outdoors, the cabin must be a (website hidden) to stay.  Even coming back in the evening and leaving in the morning didn't take away from the ""magic"" of the place."
107962,817512,2011-12-31,1437595,Jennifer,"Clean, well maintained, great little secluded location close to an amazing city."
107962,831449,2012-01-03,190361,Charles,"Had an awesome time at the cabin. Roberta was a great host, very detailed and explained everything we needed to know about the place (she even started our first fire for us!) Then when I left to go home, Roberta let me know that I forgot a few things and mailed them back to us! How awesome is that?

Over all, a very cozy place with pretty much everything you need. The bathroom is fantastic, and the decor is unique and good.

Will definitely use again!"
107962,856566,2012-01-11,1214221,Lizzy,"Roberta and Dan were wonderful hosts! Roberta was willing to meet us at an abnormal check-in time and had the cabin all prepped when we arrived. Dan even came and chopped up extra firewood for our second night! 

The cabin was lovely and so were the hosts! We would love to stay again in the future! "
107962,885660,2012-01-27,1571658,Nancy,"We had a wonderful experience staying at the log cabin.....  it was a beautiful setting right on a little lake.  It was clean, cozy inviting and warm by the wood stove fire.  Roberta is a beautiful woman with a big heart, always willing and able to attend to our needs.  The location was perfect, right off of I5 and perfect distance from Seattle.  We want to return in the summer months when the sun would be out more.... but we did see it and enjoyed our stay."
107962,888863,2012-01-29,1585486,Tammy,"We arrived to a warm cabin that hosts had started a fire in for us.  They were warm, welcoming, and attentive.  The cabin was exactly like the pics and was very quiet and set apart yet easily accessible to the city.  We definately hope to stay here again in the future!"
107962,906426,2012-02-06,1159900,Mary,"we made reservations at the last minute on a friday and Roberta and Dan were more than hospitable!  This cabin is just as the picture shows!Roberta and Dan were excellent hosts and I would recommend this ""get away"" to everyone!  They even have a paddle boat that we used around the lake!  This is an excellent location !  A real find!  
I will definately be back!"
107962,932399,2012-02-20,1547518,Katie,"This cozy cabin is a great spot for a weekend ""away,"" even though it is conveniently located in Seattle. It was clean and tidy and the hosts were friendly. Bring warm clothes because it does get chilly inside, even with the fire going. This and the bigger house on the property would be an awesome rental in the summertime, with swimming and boating on the lake right outside your front door. We went in February and enjoyed watching the ducks and geese. We even had a drizzly but fun paddle around the small lake.

For local eats, we liked the taco stand in the converted school bus on the west side of Aurora at 152nd, Old Village Korean (korean BBQ on charcoal!) at 15200 Aurora Avenue North, and Fu Man Dumpling House at 14314 Greenwood Avenue North.   "
107962,939761,2012-02-21,1716180,Blaine,Roberta and Dan have a great place! We shot a clip for a short web commercial here so we didn't get a chance to stay the night. The place is small but cozy. Best part would have to be the shower! I'm planning on booking this location when it warms up for a little weekend getaway with some friends. Roberta and Dan were very friendly and easy to communicate with. Thanks Roberta and Dan!
107962,945285,2012-02-24,295863,Kit,"This cabin is so charming, I never wanted to leave! Rustic yet refined log construction with a craftsperson's loving attention to detail. Intricate wood inlays, a gorgeous walkin shower tiled in natural stone, a great woodburning stove that keeps it cosy. Bedroom is upstairs, double bed, amazing view of the lake. Kitchen is also charming - microwave and single burner stove, little fridge and most everything you'd need, pots and pans wise, to cook the basics. Well appointed. Feels miles and decades away from metro Seattle, but is centrally located. Roberta is so neat and kind and helpful, we got in at about 1 a.m. when we arrived due to our plane schedule, and Roberta left a flashlight, detailed instructions and a lighted path to the cabin - even had a little fire going and lots of standby firewood to warm it up for us!  Roberta and Dan's cabin is going to be our #1 spot in Seattle from now on. Charming!"
107962,959436,2012-02-28,1301759,Carol,"Charming, secluded spot.  Great location.  The pictures are very accurate and owners very hospitable.  Highly recommend."
107962,984588,2012-03-10,1543917,Walt,"Great little cabin, perfect for two people.  The owner could not have been nicer or more accommodating!  A little bit of a work in progress, but very charming and full of character, and the price is right!"
107962,1003045,2012-03-15,1777299,Ian,"Roberta & Dan were excellent hosts. This was my first time using Airbnb and it was a great experience. This was a great place nestled away right in town, but you'd never know it. It's a perfect place for two and you couldn't ask for better hosts."
107962,1024108,2012-03-20,272496,Sally,"Roberta was very quick to respond to all my questions and she was also kind enough to remind me of a few things before we actually got there.  The cabin is situated in a beautiful spot and we really enjoyed our stay.  It does get cold in Seattle in the winter so be prepared for that, but the heaters and the fireplace certainly helped.  We hope to come back in the summer sometime so we can make use of lake!"
107962,1034066,2012-03-23,1717530,Denise,We enjoyed our stay at the cabin very much.  Roberta was very hospitable.  Great location to get to where we needed to be.
107962,1085033,2012-04-05,1550535,Alison,"We had a great time in Seattle.  It was lovely to spend the day in the city and then come home to this adorable little cabin in by the lake.  It felt isolated but was 10 minutes away from everything we wanted to do.
Roberta was great - the cabin is a little idiosyncratic but she taught us the ins and outs.  She even showed me how to split firewood which was good because even in April it got a bit chilly.  
Wonderful time all around.
Thanks.
"
107962,1101913,2012-04-09,1792001,Nick,"Our stay could not have been more lovely. The cabin felt like every inch was hand-designed, the wood-burning stove gave it a wonderful cozy feel, and we loved falling asleep looking out the window overlooking the lake. Dan made us feel like he really cared about us having an awesome time - and we definitely did!"
107962,1154157,2012-04-20,1640513,Rodney,"The log cabin is every bit as charming & cosy as it appears to be in the pictures. Slightly smaller than I imagined, but magical just the same. It was a quiet haven away from everything else we had to deal with in Seattle this time. It's sometimes hard to believe just how close it is to shops, etc & how far it is away from the hustle & bustle.

I recommend using the small paddleboat as often as possible. I was able to pull it out & launch it on my own, & it was easy to pull it up onto the pier & turn it over to keep the top side dry. Sitting alone out in the middle of the lake being gently blown around by the wind gusts was relaxing beyond compare.

This place will be our home base whenever we are in Seattle. We have already highly recommended it to friends & family."
107962,1168194,2012-04-23,1869876,Houston,"CURLERS - this is the perfect location when you are competing at the Granite Curling Club (GCC.)  The Heller Lake Log Cabin was not only in a better location than the local hotels but was cheaper and much nicer than the places our friends stayed this weekend.  And for larger groups there is also a house for rental on the same property.  

We flew into town for a Bonspiel (curling tournament) at the Granite Curling Club and this was the perfect location.  The club had a deal with some of the local hotels but when I looked into it they were 1) much farther away and 2) more expensive.  We were able to walk to GCC, which was only about three blocks away, while everyone else had to drive back and forth between the club and their hotel.  

The cabin is so nice and in such a great location for us that it makes the decision to return for future Bonspiels an easy one.  With there also being a house for rent on the same property we will likely have our whole team stay with us next time which will make for a much better trip while saving everyone money over the local hotel rates and save people time because they won't have to drive as far.

Even if you are coming to Seattle as a tourist instead of a curler, the location is great.  Even though it is north of downtown we were able to get back and forth to the airport quickly, even with traffic on our way back.  And downtown was easily accessed by car by either the freeway or Aurora Ave and when we didn't want to take the car there are buses running straight down Aurora to both the Fremont District (think Berkeley) and downtown.  

As mentioned by others, the cabin can get a little chilly at night but it wasn't an issue at all for us.  The space heaters are enough to keep it from becoming uncomfortable and the bed was not only comfortable but very warm.  With a fridge, coffee maker, and hotplate we had almost everything we needed.  (Bring a hairdryer if you require one but be kind to the electrical system by turning off some lights and the heater before firing it up.  We had no issues but I was an electrician and advise everyone to do that even when at home.)  Although we didn't get a chance to use them, there were even fishing poles by the front door for relaxing by the lake.

Roberta and Dan were wonderful hosts and we absolutely loved the Heller Lake Log Cabin.  Even though we arrived after midnight and had to depart at an odd hour in the afternoon, Roberta and Dan were so accomodating that we didn't have to worry about anything.  The direction to the cabin were spot on, which was especially nice because we arrived after dark.

We are looking forward to adding the Heller Lake Log Cabin to our regular list of fun weekend trips.  (Although it is a bit of a drive, check out Skillet Diner in Capital Hill for some incredible eats.  And if you make it to Pikes Place don't miss the mini-donut vendor who is on the street level.  For 24 hour a day dining (our first curling match started at 7am) Beth's is just a short drive south on Aurora Avenue and is a local favorite.)

All in all this was a wonderful location to stay at and we look forward to many more trips to this property.  You simple cannot go wrong with this location and Roberta and Dan as hosts, whether you are staying for a Bonspiel, just looking for a local get-away (it was nice and quiet), or visiting in full tourist mode.  We are already checking the calendar to see when we can get back up for a visit."
107962,1196735,2012-04-29,1479756,Cindy,"I stayed in this cute little log cabin with my boyfriend late April. The place was better than I had expected! The weather was beautiful and we were able to take advantage of it on the lake by using a paddle boat that Roberta dried for us. Communication between Roberta and Dan was great - they responded to all my emails in a quick and friendly manner. We had no problems at all with check in and out stay. It was a little tricky to find the place as I almost drove by the first time, but there is a street sign that will guide the way. I really enjoyed my trip, it was the perfect getaway! The cabin was isolated enough that you wouldn't know it was only a  5 minute drive away from the shopping mall. Will definitely be back!"
107962,1270292,2012-05-13,272224,Leticia,"Impressed with the site, the architectural beauty, the welcome details and the conversations with Roberta, our hostess...

We had a total ball in their darling cabin by the lake ;)

I took ""a ton"" of pictures...will post them little by little, to re-live the fun time spent there.

Full heartfelt recommendation, from both Robert and myself...:D

Always love, light and laughter;

107962,1303264,2012-05-19,2083008,James,"The best place to relax when going to Seattle.  You must stay here  when you come. Peaceful, beautiful, relaxing with awesome hosts.

Thank you Roberta & Dan!"
107962,1351064,2012-05-26,1572050,David,"Great quiet, peaceful and comfortable location: you think you are in the countryside but you are only half an hour or less north of downtown Seattle.  Roberta is a great hostess, making you feel very welcome and showing you all you need to know about using the equipment, the WiFi and the local shopping."
107962,1381777,2012-05-30,1971463,Gabe,"Clearly some thought went into the design of this cabin.  My parents stayed here, and we stayed in the main house on the same property with our kids.  What a cozy little place to enjoy Seattle.  Not too far from the downtown area, and not too close, either!  Clean, hospitable, and welcoming - we definitely recommend it!"
107962,1393969,2012-06-01,76810,Christy,"Our last few days living in Seattle!!!  We live close to this wonderful cabin and enjoyed it so much last summer, we decided to stay one last time before our big move out of state.  Our son loved it and we stayed busy enjoying nature the entire time.  We can't wait to return.  Thanks, Roberta and Dan!!!"
107962,1408575,2012-06-04,1552484,Susan,"The Haller cabin was a lovely surprise -- quiet, spotless, comfortable and peaceful.  We will try to stay there anytime we are in the Seattle area -- can't get enough of that beautiful lakeside view!"
107962,1425030,2012-06-06,1817715,Dawn,"What a perfect escape!! This cabin has been lovingly restored. The setting, though within Seattle city limits, is tranquil. I would strongly recommend this rental to all who appreciate the better things in life."
107962,1443708,2012-06-09,1821516,David,We had a great time at the log cabin.  It's a lovely place.
107962,1539384,2012-06-23,1459665,Margaret,"What a wonderful unique cabin.  It was fun and exciting to stay in the cabin.  I sent morning pictures from the cabin window with my coffee and the beautiful lake setting for all my FB friends to see!  It is a gorgeous view.  When it rained the sound of the patter on the roof and the rain falling on the lake was marvelous, and you add the crackling fire just to make it perfect.  Better yet, we had two days of glorious sunrises on the lake.  The grand kids loved visiting, although all the duck families we told them about we're scarce when they got there to feed them!  My husband and I enjoyed this serene setting in the midst of our crazy week of activities.  Thank you Roberta and Dan!"
107962,1564316,2012-06-26,1559529,Roger,The cabin on Haller Lake was exactly as described!  It was not far from Seattle's downtown so easy to get around to see everything.  The Wifi was much appreciated to keep in contact with friends and family while in the cabin.  We are looking forward to another visit to Seattle some day.  Thanks being there to open it up for us and for your hospitality!
107962,1594217,2012-06-30,1636522,Elaine,This is a tiny log cabin in an incomparable location in Seattle on a beautiful lake.  It is furnished perfectly and has everything one needs in miniature. it is perfectly conceived and with wonderful wood work.  We would definately stay there again.  The host is terrific. 
107962,1795438,2012-07-25,2045112,Frank,"What an outstanding perfect get away on the lake, it hasa beautiful mainroom with kichenette, fireplace and wonderful view, the porch was perfect for meals and Haller lake was serene. If anyone has the chance enjoy this place it is the best deal around instead of a chain lodging. It certainly made the trip much more memorable!"
107962,1817813,2012-07-28,2108302,Tamarin,We arranged our trip just so we could stay at this cabin and we were so glad we did.  The lake was beautiful and the cabin was so relaxing and restful. We barely wanted to leave to go into Seattle. I would recommend this place to anyone!!!
107962,1897627,2012-08-06,1135078,Eri,"Where do I begin?!  Roberta and Dan are such amazing souls who allowed us to not only rent their gorgeous property, but to hold our wedding onsite!  It was incredible, magical, whimsical and utterly perfect!  This is an amazing property with great space, beautiful landscaping, ideal location and warm hearts.  We hosted 9 people on the property and threw a wedding for around 70 people.  When we were not in the throws of wedding prep, we were swimming in Haller Lake or simply relaxing in the shelter of the trees or playing cards in the spacious living space.  Both the house and the cabin are well stocked and the owners have thought of everything you could need during your stay.  We are so incredibly blessed to have found this location through AirBNB and to have met this incredible family.  We HIGHLY recommend this place and are grateful to have held our wedding celebration here!"
107962,1950694,2012-08-11,2920758,Sarah,Roberta was a great hostess and the cabin is right on the lake and a fabulous and charming retreat from the city. Thanks Roberta and Dan!
107962,1982913,2012-08-14,2744017,Anna-Joy,Great place! We had an amazing time in Seattle. Would recommend it for sure!

107962,2204661,2012-09-05,2128122,Bonnie,We had a awesume stay at this cute rustic little cabin!!  Never felt like you were in the city at all.  Roberta was so nice and helpful to deal with.  I would definately go back.  We really enjoyed Seattle.
107962,2310761,2012-09-17,1439236,Carole,Roberta and Dan are very gracious hosts.  a very cozy cabin. 
107962,2378546,2012-09-23,2580609,Diane,We had such a relaxing time at the cabin.  The cabin just puts you into the mood that says come in and relax.   The yard and lake were so special.   We especially enjoyed sitting on the dock with the beautiful view.  The lake was so quiet and calming.  We truely enjoyed the quiet time at the lake and the cabin.    
107962,2404772,2012-09-25,1824537,Sharon,"Roberta and Dan have the most charming cabin, and home. it is so cosy. we flew in to Seattle to take an Alaskan cruise and stayed two days after. we found their place on airbnb and we are sure glad. pure relaxation, no tv no phone. you do not need it. the lake sounds sing you to sleep and help u rise. we will be back, absolutely love it. thank you Roberta and Dan for sharing this gem with others.

107962,2427445,2012-09-27,3136454,Annelie,"The Haller Lake Log Cabin is such a beautiful place to spend some time! It makes you want to stay there the whole time instead of seeing seattle and the big city. As soon as you enter the cabin you feel home. Roberta and Dan were great hosts by making you feel very welcome at their place.
If we ever return to seattle (which we definitely want to do) the Log Cabin will be our first choice to stay :)"
107962,2547144,2012-10-08,3665359,Ronelle,Beautiful place to stay!  It seemed so far away from everything but was so close to Seattle.  Lovely
107962,2577475,2012-10-10,3772994,Bradd & Amanda,"My wife and I stayed and the Haller Lake Cabin this week for our 2 year anniversary.  Everything was great, from the amazing views to the comfy bed, amazing woodwork, beautiful shower and included Comcast Wi-Fi.  I would recommend this place to anyone who is visiting the Seattle area and would like an AMAZING place to stay that is so much better than just renting a hotel room.  Its also only about 15-20 minutes from downtown and the Space Needle. Roberta and Dan responded within 2 hours of my request to stay at the cabin. They stayed in contact and also do text messaging to coordinate our arrival time. They were very flexible.      "
107962,2721082,2012-10-26,3387385,Erica,"This little cabin is very cozy and is close to a lot of amenities.  The private lake is beautiful and serene.  Having to create a fire nightly was challenging, but romantic."
107962,2752657,2012-10-29,3771266,Nadezhda,It was very good time. We like this beautiful place.Thank you Roberta & Dan!!! God bless you!!!
107962,2882237,2012-11-13,4086957,Daniel,Roberta and Dan's cabin on Haller Lake is absolutely wonderful!  We had a delightful time during our little stay and wouldn't change anything.  Hats off to Dan for waiting for us after our day went... awry.  Great place!
107962,2946276,2012-11-23,287962,Ian,"Stayed here after sending the day in the city for my Husband's Birthday and we both loved it!  It was a perfect quiet little place to end our day at.
Roberta was very friendly and hospitable."
107962,3055593,2012-12-11,2624235,Brooke,"Roberta's log cabin was a dream. The location is perfect: situated on a beautiful lake and only a short trip to the center of Seattle. Though, the comfort of the cabin sure made it hard to make that trip! The bed is comfortable, shower is nice & hot and the fire keeps the whole place toasty! Don't miss out on a stay in this special little place!"
107962,3106351,2012-12-17,1640544,Dan,The cabin is as great as it looks! Definitely a recommendation in my book.
107962,3345193,2013-01-14,1568840,Brooke,"The log cabin was beautiful, private, and in a great location! The Wi-Fi worked flawlessly, and the place was clean and comfy. Roberta was very communicative and friendly.

5 stars all the way, would definitely book again! "
107962,3369031,2013-01-18,4591619,Tim,"A very cool cabin on a lake nestled among tall trees. Pretty sweet as its about five minutes north of Green Lake! Will try to make it back in the summer and go for a paddle! The Host Roberta was very helpful, even an Albertsons grocery card on the key chain! Plenty of firewood kept us cozy. "
107962,3397822,2013-01-22,262015,Stephanie,The cabin was so cozy and comfortable - it was a perfect escape for the weekend. It was easy to coordinate with Roberta to pick up the keys. Overall just a great time! Thanks!
107962,3430824,2013-01-28,575700,Eva,"The cabin was one of the coziest and most pleasant places I have ever stayed. The view down to the lake is beautiful and the whole cabin was a pleasure to be in -- I wish I could have been there longer! Roberta was very friendly and provided a great introduction to the cabin, how to work the fireplace, and other little pieces of advice. Highly recommended!"
107962,3456476,2013-02-01,99566,Jake,Fantastic! This is a really great find and a wonderful price for Seattle. 
107962,3496988,2013-02-08,1640544,Dan,Another great stay at the cabin! I highly recommend.
107962,3515357,2013-02-11,4649930,Cindy,Thanks to Roberta and Dan for a great stay. The cabin is a very cute and cozy place for a weekend getaway. 
107962,3546892,2013-02-15,1453597,Megan,I cannot say enough about this wonderful cottage!  Roberta and her husband were wonderful hosts and the cottage is just all charm!  I want one of these in my back yard for guests or simply as my own retreat.  It was beautifully restored and incredibly cozy.  I hardly wanted to leave to do any sight seeing.  It was the main attraction!
107962,3707120,2013-03-06,3626330,Fred,"From the moment we arrived we were welcomed. Our flights got delayed and Dan stayed up to take us through the basics of the cabin. The cabin it self was a little slice of heaven and a welcomed change of pace from the city. Everything was perfect from the moment we got there until the moment we left. Our hosts made themselves available if we ever needed it. Great stay, great property if you're looking for a place to stay away from the city look no further "
107962,3872222,2013-03-23,5390253,Jacob,"Beautiful cabin, gorgeous lake, amazing hosts. We could not be happier with our stay at Roberta and Dan's cabin. They were incredibly helpful throughout the entirety of our stay and very hospitable. Without a doubt we will be back! Highly recommended!"
107962,3887960,2013-03-25,1413898,Paula,The cabin was great! We had a wonderful weekend.
107962,3941613,2013-03-29,5067895,Kayla,"We are so thankful to have found this absolute gem only 15 minutes away from the Space Needle, Pike Place and downtown Seattle! The cabin was incredibly cozy and we loved the little wood burning stove that kept us warm during our stay. Roberta even suggested that we take the canoe out on the lake to look for turtles basking on the rocks in the sun. Although we didn't see any turtles, there were plenty of ducks and Canada Geese to entertain us. Roberta and Dan were beyond accommodating, allowing us to come a day early to extend our stay and even offered to have a fire waiting in the stove for our arrival. Roberta responded to my reservation within minutes, providing directions to the cabin, and was in constant communication throughout our stay. The fresh oranges were a treat, too! I can't say enough about how incredible this little cabin is, and am already looking for excuses to go back for another visit. Do not pass this place up!! "
107962,4173309,2013-04-15,4205966,Maureen,"Fresh eggs, roaring fire, peaceful lakeside retreat...what's not to love?  Roberta and Dan host a lovely stay in a rare lakeside setting.
There space is quiet and beautiful and they give just enough, but not too much, attention to their guests.  I love how close it is to everything...5 minutes off the freeway, but it feels like you're in the middle of the countryside.  

Thanks so much for making this amazing space available!"
107962,4224701,2013-04-20,3404314,Cindy,"My husband and I very much enjoyed our two-night stay at the Haller Lake cabin. The small cabin itself is very charming--cozy, with attention to detail, both functional and aesthetic. The fire place was lovely. The setting and view of the lake are beautiful. Although it feels private and isolated, the cabin is close to businesses and we enjoyed delicious meals at Saffron Grill and Enat Ethiopian restaurants. Roberta was attentive and helpful, but unintrusive. "
107962,4249159,2013-04-22,5453686,Crystal,"So happy to have found this little oasis!!  The cabin is comfortable and cozy; the surroundings peaceful.  We had a great time on the lake, testing out both the canoe and the paddle boat :)  Already looking forward to our next stay!"
107962,4327116,2013-04-28,5694290,Andrew,"I thoroughly enjoyed my stay in Roberta and Dan's cabin. It was the perfect getaway during a hectic trip to Seattle. It was private, immaculately clean, and extremely comfortable. I highly recommend this place! I was shocked that it only took me 10 minutes to get downtown. "
107962,4363652,2013-04-30,5657249,Mas,"My wife and I stayed two nights at the cabin. The cabin and location were perfect for us. We were moving around in Seattle, eating and drinking actively in the daytime and chilled out at the cabin in the evening. The wood stove warmed us up comfortably at chilly, rainy spring nights. No doubt we'll come back again!"
107962,4488749,2013-05-08,2030916,Sallee & Andrea,"We had an amazing time!  Roberta went out of her way to be helpful.  We wanted to get married in their backyard, Roberta was great!  The cabin is perfect!  It is so peaceful on the lake, it's quiet & serene.  We went on the canoe daily.  It was in a great spot.  This is a true hidden gem!  Great area, it has a lot of places to eat and shop too.  We can't wait to go back!!  The wifi works great and the best part...NO TV!!  :)"
107962,4716672,2013-05-21,6266357,Joseph,"Great experience overall! Roberta was nice and wonderful, and took the time to show us around the cabin at first too. The cabin itself was beautiful, and led up to Haller Lake (making a wonderful view as well). 

The cabin itself was quiet (making for a great location for a weekend getaway). The only thing missing was a TV, but we had our own laptops which made up for it. 

Roberta also showed us her chicken farm, and gave us some eggs (which were delicious!)"
107962,4932177,2013-06-03,1640544,Dan,"As always my eight year old daughter loved staying at the cabin, fishing, canoeing, capturing slugs, building fires and playing with the chickens."
107962,5139726,2013-06-15,4115426,Alana & Norman,"We had a great time at Roberta and Dan's cabin. Roberta has organized everything one needs to make a perfect stay. And the wood stove is a great companion on a cool night. Roberta was helpful with local knowledge, like driving tips and laundry. We hope to visit again one day. "
107962,5299443,2013-06-23,2437492,Martin,Once again Roberta & Dan's charming little cabin in the city was wonderful. Its a wonderful place to wake up and a perfect little escape from the bustling city at the end of the day. The hosts are nice and accommodating and genuinely care if you are comfortable.
107962,5403295,2013-06-28,6947660,Victoria,"My husband was in Seattle on a business trip.  It was so much nicer staying at the Cabin than a hotel.  The lodgings were beautiful and quiet.  He would absolutely stay there again if he is back in the Seattle area.

Thank you for your hospitality."
107962,5964382,2013-07-24,6391764,Evelyne,"Our only regret is that we couldn't stay longer!!  This cabin is beyond charming and the backyard, dock and lake are the perfect backdrop.  Roberta was very kind and made our stay easy and comfortable. We sincerely appreciate the chance to spend a little time here and hope to return!  We could not recommend this cabin more! Thanks so much Roberta and Dan!"
107962,6338726,2013-08-09,1648168,Marianne,The cabin is an absolute paradise; you feel like you are far away from the city.  The lake is sparkling clean and warm for swimming.  I can't imagine a more perfect get-away location!  
107962,6528575,2013-08-16,1614893,Laurel,Roberta & Dan are great! Their cabin was wonderful! Amazing woodwork and beautiful stone...a comfy bed...clever roomy shower...all the kitchenware and appliances you need.  We walked out the front door at dawn and right down the lawn into the little lake.  And it's right on the bus line downtown.  We loved it!
107962,6612501,2013-08-19,6224131,Maggie,"As our first airbnb experience, I've gotta say - the bar was set pretty high. We were in Seattle for a couple days for my cousins' wedding, so unfortunately did not get to spend as much time in the cabin as we'd like. The cabin was more spacious than I expected, very comfortable and cozy, super clean, private, and very romantic. It was equipped with pretty much everything that we needed and if we needed something, like an iron ;) Roberta was there in a jiffy to provide it to us. 

The view is absolutely phenomenal and breathtaking. Coming from flat-landed Texas, the lake, trees, and just pure nature...was so refreshing - I really could have used some more of that. 

This was such a great experience. Hopefully, we'll be able to come back to Seattle one day and stay here again! Thank you Roberta and Dan for sharing your hidden gem with us, and for your hospitality! :) "
107962,6931162,2013-08-31,5708824,Luke And Julia,"My wife and I stayed here for our anniversary in Seattle. It's a very cute and cozy cottage located right on Haller Lake. We didn't get a chance to take advantage of the lake, but we loved the serene area and being located just 15 minutes from downtown. We would definitely recommend staying here if you have the chance. "
107962,7032472,2013-09-04,1354541,Colin,"Roberta and Dan were great. Their cabin was very peaceful, quiet and relaxing. We had a great time exploring Seattle, and their hospitality and little ""get away"" from the city was the cherry on top. If we ever make a trip back to Seattle we will be staying here."
107962,7909018,2013-10-07,7864590,Christie,"I LOVED this place. Super clean, toasty warm (thanks to the roaring fire that was already going when I arrived), and you couldn't ask for a better location. This little cabin feels so secluded even though you're in the middle of the city. There's no better place to enjoy a glass of wine and a book than the big overstuffed chair overlooking the lake. Roberta and Dan were great hosts- looking forward to staying here again!"
107962,8625191,2013-11-09,9244001,Michael,I wanted to take a retreat from work and instead of driving a long distance or flying somewhere I found this great log cabin close by. It was perfect. Very cozy with nice warm wood burning fireplace. Roberta and Dan were perfect hosts. Enjoyed the nice lake with ducks and geese and the sound of the rain on the metal roof was heavenly. Perfect retreat.
107962,8814965,2013-11-19,1155117,Barbara,"What a slice of tranquility in the midst of the city. Only minutes from Pikes Market, the Waterfront and Space Needle. What a convenient location. Dan and Roberta are delightful and the cabin is exactly as pictured and described. Cozy wood stove, amazing view of the lake and the cabin is a work of art in itself. Cant wait to visit again."
107962,9292159,2013-12-19,7324243,Jenn,The cabin was fantastic. So quaint with the wood burning fireplace and the beautiful view. Roberta and Dan were very accommodating. Would love to stay here again :) 
107962,9888403,2014-01-17,4812693,Lyla,"Beautiful location and lovely, cosy cabin!"
107962,9914870,2014-01-19,10749072,Sharry,"This is a great little cabin in the middle of the city!! Everything other reviewers said is accurate - gorgeous setting, cozy cabin with nice décor, etc. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for some peace and quiet for a couple of days. No TV, which was perfect for us, but does have wi-fi, so we had to exercise some self control and not use our electronic devices the whole time. The cabin is very, very small, but it is also very comfortable despite its size. The pictures accurately represent the size, too. I was not surprised by the size once we got there, since the pictures were accurate. Definitely bring slippers, but the floor isn't so cold that you regret being there or anything. I was a little worried about this aspect, but it was actually no big deal. Also, between the fire and the space heaters, it was plenty warm, and we didn't need any of these at night, and night temps were low to mid 30s while we were there. There were only really 2 things I can see that could be improved. First, most of the windows don't have curtains on them, so there aren't too many places you can get dressed besides the bathroom, with the door closed, without feeling like you're getting dressed in front of a window. Second, there are very few shelves or empty tables or the like to put your own things on - for instance, food or toiletries. Especially in the bathroom, there was no space to put toiletries or clothes, etc. Both of these points are very minor, though. I don't think I'd choose this place if we were staying for a week or anything, but for 2-3 days, it's perfect!"
107962,9978656,2014-01-22,3345237,Michele,"Our stay at Roberta and Dan's was *magical!*  They were kind and courteous hosts and had available any amenity you could think of, including: a canoe and paddle boat for the lake just steps away, pot and pans for the kitchenette, fishing poles and bait, disposable razors, lotions, and feminine products (haha), and extra mattress and bedding for an extra guest), board games and plush throws to enjoy near the fire, and a guest book we LOVED flipping through. There was even fresh cut wood waiting for us at our doorstep each afternoon when we returned. Basically, everything was perfectly in place for us.

Although we didn't have enough time to enjoy it all, decompressing near the fire place each night was soothing and relaxing. Possibly one of our favorite parts of our days there. And in the morning, we'd enjoy some of the tea they provided and sipped it near the dock on the lake.

The cabin is immaculately clean and there is so much detail and character in the space. You really feel you are in the middle of a forest when actually you are close to everything! Interstate 5 is about a mile away and will take you to just about any part of the city (only about 10 minutes from downtown). We also took it to Vancouver (2 hours north) and spent a day there exploring.

The neighborhood feels very safe, the cabin was much more private than we expected considering it is in the city, and overall it was a very serene place to stay.

We really felt we hit the jackpot with this place and would love to stay here again! :-)

107962,10017597,2014-01-25,11610688,Shaina,The reservation was canceled 64 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
107962,10265299,2014-02-10,7285020,Donna,"Wow!  This is like a cottage out of a fairy tale.  Completely private, among tall trees with a lovely view of the lake.  Cozy and comfortable.  All the furniture was comfortable to lounge on.  The wood stove kept me warm (I was there during a cold snap in February) and was easy and fun to use.  Scrupulously clean. My only regret was that I didn't have more time to spend curled up in front of the fire, or in front of the big picture window overlooking the lake.  Roberta and Dan were solicitous, but not intrusive--just available if I needed anything (I didn't!)  I will definitely be back."
107962,10416488,2014-02-18,1138681,Sharon,"I had really high expectations of this place, having seen the pictures on the airbnb listing, and I have to say that this cabin exceeded them.  I didn't even want to leave the entire visit and wanted to stay snuggled up in front of the wood-burning stove or in the big chair in front of the upstairs window overlooking the lake.  I'll bring coffee and half n half next time, so as to be sure I have plenty to drink the first morning there, since it is not provided.  Non-dairy creamer and tea are provided. The kitchenette was sufficient for us to cook some dinners, and Roberta had supplied it with a good assortment of cooking utensils and equipment.  I highly recommend this place.  It is amazing! "
107962,11117778,2014-03-21,11976610,Megan,"Roberta and Dan's Haller Lake Log Cabin  was everything I could have possibly asked for. It is truly a hidden gem within the hustle and bustle of the city of Seattle. 

Walking back to the cabin, I was immediately taken aback by the beauty of the trees surrounding it and the serenity of the lake stretching out before it. My first night, I simply sat out on the private dock, taking it all in. 

The cabin itself was perfect. It was cozy, rustic, and the ideal way to go ""back to nature"" without losing any of the amenities of home. The window in the bedroom took up almost the entire wall and each morning my boyfriend and I enjoyed awaking to sunshine and birdsongs. The patio in front of the cabin was fantastic for enjoying relaxing breakfasts outdoors, and the fireplace was ideal for cozying up on the couch each night. 

As if all of this wasn't enough, Roberta and Dan left coffee and tea for us and provided enough firewood to keep us warm all day and night. While Dan wasn't at home when we arrived, Roberta took the time to give us a tour of the cabin, show us how to light the fireplace, and answer any and every question we had. She was a fantastic host-- and even helped me locate the cabin when I got lost on the way there. 

I would definitely recommend this cabin to anyone and everyone interested in having a relaxing, enjoyable and picturesque escape from the city. 
"
107962,12327224,2014-04-29,11154445,Ben,"Absolutely stunning and serene little cabin! Great hosts with kind hearts, literally 9 minutes to the Union and 5th Ave parkade in downtown Seattle (smack in the middle of shopping and restaurants). The lake is gorgeous and for the most part mirror calm first thing in the morning! Honestly could not be better, won't stay anywhere else in the Seattle area anymore (unless all of you read this and keep the place booked). "

I loved being able to look out at the lake and have a fire in the woodstove. Use of the canoe on the lake was an awesome bonus!! They have restored the cabin with love and care and great attention to detail. Loved staying here! "
107962,13906855,2014-06-08,11789231,Charlie,"Our expectations were exceeded when we arrived at Roberta & Dan's cabin.  It was the perfect place to spend our honeymoon.  We used the paddle-boat on the lake on a daily basis.  The utensils and cookware inside provided us the ability to cook breakfast at home each day, which made our experience so much more relaxed than if we'd been in a hotel.  We were pleasantly surprised by the low rate - as the experience was priceless!  What a great value!  Roberta was also very hospitable, making sure your towels are replenished and such.  You'll also love her three chickens that mosey around!  5 stars all around.  Awesome stay.  We'd love to revisit soon!"
107962,14178169,2014-06-14,1621548,Sarah,"Before you open the beautifully crafted wooden door to this enchanted cabin, stop. Take a moment to look around. Look toward the beautiful trees, ferns, flowers, grassy meadow, the little lake. Close your eyes. Breath. Slow down. You're in for a treat. Now you are ready to walk into an extraordinarily crafted little bit of heaven. Would you expect hand crafted, inlaid wooden pegs to hang your hat? You'll find them next to the door and in the shower for your towels. There's more. You find them. Custom cut, beautiful wood along the stairs to the snuggly bedroom upstairs. This is a little nod to the over the top work these two people did to a cabin that was found in total disrepare. Many would have destroyed it. They saved it. And now, it's there - waiting to welcome you. You will find comfort everywhere. 

To say that Roberta and Dan are superior hosts makes me embarrassed at my poor command of the language. So I will simply say you won't find better people, and their commitment to the environment is commendable. The unique toilet is one testimony to this, as is their dedication to recycling.

Just wait until you take your shower. You're snuggled in what looks like a cave. To me, anyhow! It's so fun. The cabin is very well stocked with wonderful comforters, more dishes, utensils, pots and pans than you'll ever need, paper towels, teas, etc., nice big bath towels, lamps on both sides of the snuggly couch and the bed (good for reading) plenty of firewood, paper, kindling, fat wood, lighters for a really efficient and cozy fire (have Roberta show you a couple of very nice features)

Do you want a place for your honeymoon, celebrate a romantic anniversary or a couple getaway? Or just you getaway? This is the place. 

Do you need a very comfortable spot to stay in Seattle while you attend to medical issues at any of Seattle's World-recognized Medical Centers? This is the place for you. 

Do you ant to have a homey base to explore Seattle and it's sights? This is it. The hosts will help you in any way you need to find your way around.

But you may wish you had carved out more time to simply kick back in the cabin. Trust me on this one. This isn't just a place to stay like a hotel, it's a destination in and of itself. 

Try going out early in the morning or in the early afternoon; walk down to the dock and just sit quietly and relax.  A couple of times I took the paddle boat out to the middle of the pond and let the breeze move me slowly to the other end. Nice! So, do you need a place to just hide away for a while and recharge your batteries? Without a doubt, this is the place is for you. 

Thank you Roberta, from the bottom of my heart. I'll see you again.

107962,14461223,2014-06-20,10624563,Lance,"What an amazing place to stay! Beautiful location, cozy, close to everything but you would think you were up in the mountains! Roberta and Dan are wonderful hosts and make sure you have everything you need for your stay.  This was my first experience with Airbnb and it was a great choice!!! Thank you Roberta and Dan!

107962,14726233,2014-06-24,13488487,Josh,The reservation was canceled the day before arrival. This is an automated posting.
107962,17550839,2014-08-14,10801900,Misty,"This place was even more beautiful than the pictures shown.  Privacy is great and the atmosphere is amazing!  I didn't want to leave to do other activities we had planned.  

I loved being at the lake!  We used the paddle boat, fishing gear, deck chairs and canoe (careful it tips and we ended up in the lake). We created wonderful memories here.  

The location is perfect...close to Seattle, malls, restaurants, and sound.  I did not want to leave and was disappointed when I checked into a hotel the next day. I missed the cabin!  Can't wait to return.

 Roberta and Dan were very welcoming.  Thanks for a wonderful time!"
107962,17669832,2014-08-16,8991534,Milena&Manuel,"Roberta and Dans cabin was the last stop of our america-trip and we couldn't have chosen better. the cozy cabin was pretty decorated and well equipped. since it is located directly by the lake, staying there just let us feel down-to-earth and harmonic. the only thing that could have been better, was the weather. I just say thx to Roberta for helping us and letting us stay at her little cabin."
107962,18392743,2014-08-26,9716783,Robert,"Very nice cabin and very nice people. We loved staying here for 3 days while exploring the area. The cabin has everything you need and the lake is a lovely place to kick back.

Dan and Roberta are great hosts with plenty of tips on eating etc.

We will come back another time, thats for sure.

Thank you R and D!"
107962,19918859,2014-09-21,7866924,Hans,Very relaxed and friendly. A residential neighborhood with lots of animals especially ducks. We felt very much at home.
107962,20406405,2014-09-29,14133790,Pam,"This is a very sweet and cozy place to stay.  I enjoyed the beautiful windows overlooking the lake.  My hosts Roberta and Dan took very good care of me and I loved seeing Roberta's gardens, chickens and baby ducks!  I enjoyed a beautiful sunrise over the lake one morning and loved waking up and hearing  some gentle quacking.  Very conveniently located and just minutes from shops and quaint neighborhoods."
107962,20734475,2014-10-05,9595466,Jen,"We loved our stay in this cozy cabin. After a very long day of driving  (thanks to Siri) it felt so great to step through the door and feel immediately at home. The wood stove was easy to light and warmed the whole place in minutes. The stone shower was gorgeous and held plenty of hot water. The sheets were soft, and the blankets and towels were fluffy. A quick walk down the path took us to the serene lake, where we chilled out with mugs of tea and chatted with the ducks. 

Roberta and Dan were wonderful hosts. Both were very available to answer questions, and both were warm and welcoming. They love their cabin, and it shows in their attention to craftsmanship. 

We highly recommend staying at this little cabin. It is close enough to the city to soak up the local culture, and far enough that it feels like a real retreat. While you are there, check out Naked City Brew Pub and have a big pretzel with stoneground mustard- yum!

We will definitely stay here again!

107962,21010114,2014-10-09,13171076,Michelle,"Perfect stay at this wooden cabin. Great location, great environment, great privacy, great host and great value! Roberta is so nice to greet us in person and show us every detail of the house. We were also given the access to canoeing in the lake. You can't expect more from an BNB experience."
107962,21346502,2014-10-15,21179710,Mary,"Roberta encouraged me to text her when we arrived in Seattle, so she could light the wood burning fireplace. Nice touch and the cabin was cozy and warm. The neighborhood was quiet, filled with trees and the lake made such a peaceful setting."
107962,21432777,2014-10-17,21766773,Khristopher,"Our first AirBnB experience was at Roberta and Dan's Haller Lake log cabin. We absolutely loved it and will be going back! Our experience was memorable. We also appreciated how accommodating Roberta was, especially since we had an awful delay with our flight and getting into Seattle. The cabin was immaculate, spotless and well-cared for. Roberta ensured we had everything we could have wanted or needed. Loved the ability to use the canoe and fishing poles at the lake. The rustic charm appealed to both my wife and I and allowed us to feel like we were in a wilderness environment, yet able to easily access the city within minutes. Thanks for a wonderful stay!"
107962,21602991,2014-10-20,21504509,Chris,I felt right at home when I arrived at Roberta and Dan's great little cabin. It was clean and ready for me. I couldn't have asked for a better experience for the location and price and want to return when I come back to Seattle.
107962,22898434,2014-11-17,13239468,Leili,Cozy little cabin; Roberta made us feel welcome! Wonderful little getaway. 
107962,25093727,2015-01-06,618945,Behzad,"Roberta and Dan went out of their way to welcome us, the place was ready and tidy and we felt personally cared for. This place is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, well, for us we hope more than once! You cannot possibly regret staying here. We split our trip to Seattle between a nice hotel downtown and the cabin, and our stay in the cabin was much more memorable!"
107962,26219087,2015-02-07,10318608,Barbara,"Nestled by Lake Haller, the cabin feels miles away from the busy metropolis or the surrounding suburbs. Tall cedars and wide-spreading ferns lead down to the dock. The cabin is snug and comfortable. Roberta always makes us feel welcome.  "
107962,27436027,2015-03-04,27339755,Natalie,"The cabin was the perfect place for our long weekend.  Beautiful, quiet and secluded but just a quick drive to downtown Seattle.  Roberta & Dan were helpful with suggestions and information about the area. We definitely recommend this cozy cabin and would stay again if we return to Seattle!"
107962,27554124,2015-03-07,9218861,Joey,"Upon arrival, Roberta and Dan we're welcoming and kind; they had started a fire in the fireplace to warm the space and provided us with a tour. We were extremely cozy and comfortable for the couple days that we stayed at their cabin and felt right at home. I highly recommend anyone to stay at this place during their time
in the Seattle area. Moreover, I recommend that people take a day to relax and enjoy the cabin and lake; it's well worth it!"
107962,27660355,2015-03-09,27281329,Kayla,This was a birthday trip for my fiance and it was Exactly everything we could have hoped it could be. Prior to our trip Roberta was very helpful and always responded very promptly. When we arrived she greeted us and showed us around the adorable cabin. We were sad to have to leave but hope to make the trip again very soon.
107962,27885899,2015-03-14,5821717,Brady,Roberta & Dan were awesome. They greeted us when we arrived and gave us the full run down on everything we needed to know. This cabin was super cozy and has and outstanding view. My wife and I were so relaxed staying here we did not want to leave. :) 
107962,28017789,2015-03-16,27871741,Caitlin,"Roberta was wonderful and very welcoming. My husband had a great in-city getaway, looking at the lake, listening to the ducks and drawing in the cozy cabin. Will definitely stay here again, and highly recommend it! "
107962,28172496,2015-03-19,27812542,Sara,The cabin was adorable. Roberta was very pleasant. The fireplace kept us warm. The view was amazing. We would stay here again and again. Excellent first time experience. You can not go wrong with this place. Thank you Roberta!
107962,29916150,2015-04-14,14104507,Kimberly And George,"Thank you, thank you Roberta  for hosting us at our little home away from home. The cabin and yard feel as though they could be on a lake far outside the city and that is just our lifestyle!  The drive into downtown which we did frequently was insignificant. The cabin is interesting, attractive, and comfortable.  We loved the eggs Roberta shared with us.  We stayed at the cabin for 12 days so we brought a small tv and power antenna and enjoyed many a western movie!! Funny, that will be remembered as a highlight!!  Every morning we would watch a western and drink tea and totally unwind on vacation. "
107962,30318238,2015-04-20,8259668,Martin,"Roberta & Dan's cabin was a wonderful treat to come home to each day. Just a short drive into the city, it was a great location for exploring all of Seattle while also enjoying the beautiful lake it backs onto. The dock was a great place to have morning teas, go for a canoe ride, and soak in some sun. The log fireplace created a wonderful ambiance in this one of a kind cabin. 
Roberta & Dan were more than gracious hosts, making sure we had everything we needed and went above and beyond to make our stay enjoyable.

Thanks again! :)"
107962,30936201,2015-04-29,22206772,Nicole,"Roberta and Dan were great hosts - they gave us a tour of the cabin and made themselves available for whatever we needed. The cabin is conveniently located near the Seattle center, many restaurants, and grocery stores. We loved having the lake in our backyard and having the canoe and paddle boat to use whenever we wanted! We were lucky enough to get some sunny days there and spotted some turtles across the lake, an osprey, and a kingfisher!"
107962,33896517,2015-06-02,27235118,Marguerite,"The location is perfect.  Quiet neighborhood with easy access to downtown Seattle.  Roberta and Dan are welcoming, generous, and friendly without being intrusive.  It's hard to imagine a more perfect setting.  Sitting in a big, comfy stuffed chair in the cozy upstairs bedroom, looking out onto the lake, trees, birds.  I swam everyday off the private dock.  Water temperature was perfect and since there are no motorized boats allowed, swimming to your heart's content is safe and relaxing.  I travel to Seattle often, and as long as the cabin is available, it's where I will be staying from now on."
107962,42114650,2015-08-11,9874771,Philip,Once again had a great time!  Thank you.  
107962,43063480,2015-08-17,15445413,New,Beautiful and quaint cabin right on the lake! Hosts went above and beyond to make us comfortable. I highly recommend and would come back!
107962,44124588,2015-08-24,6436891,Emily,"This magical cabin was made even better by the beautiful pristine lake and warm and accommodating hosts. A big thank you to Roberta and Dan for their hospitality. The cabin was well stocked, clean, and super comfortable. I will treasure our time there and hope we can return one day! Only 15 minutes from downtown Seattle but a world away. Very tranquil and peaceful. "
107962,44879264,2015-08-30,22090240,Lynne,This listing was exactly as described. It is a bit a walk from parking to the cabin so for those with limited mobility a caveat would be in order. Roberta was very accommodating and pleasant to talk with. I have already recommended this lovely cabin to friends I think would like it.
107962,45559159,2015-09-04,29590276,Gerd,"Roberta & Dan were very helpful and welcoming.  A short jaunt from their off street parking to their little rustic cabin by the lake was a trip to the country without leaving the city.  It was peaceful, serene, forested park atmosphere on a sweet small lake.   Thank you Gerd"
107962,45779807,2015-09-06,35636131,Amy,"We really enjoyed our stay at Haller Lake Restored Log Cabin.  It is quaint, very charming and comfortable.  A truly lovely setting.  It really is like being in a fairytale.  Roberta was very warm and helpful host.  I can see why this place is always rented!
"
107962,46135262,2015-09-08,37449920,Kristin,"Roberta and Dan were very warm and welcoming. The cabin was quiet, charming and a wonderful place to crash after a long day in the city. Would highly recommend to others!"
107962,46473501,2015-09-11,11696006,Robert,Amazing! I don't know what to say! You can't beat this place! You won't be sorry! Roberta was very welcoming and provided everything we needed and great city recommendations! If we ever go back we will be staying here for sure.
107962,46705715,2015-09-13,6610538,Jessica,"Dan and Roberta's cabin in Seattle was a perfect escape after a long day exploring the city. They were gracious hosts, and gave us recommendations during our short stay in Seattle. The cabin was just as described, and well equipped with everything we needed. We highly recommend this place to anyone! We hope to stay here one day again. "
107962,49171576,2015-10-01,44842113,Brad,"Roberta was very prompt in reaching out to us about our travel and in responding to us via text. She was very courteous and full of helpful information. We went to a concert at Benaroya Hall while we were in town and she even directed us on where to park to help us to beat the traffic. We followed her advice and promptly got out of there!

She greeted us upon our arrival and walked us through everything. The cabin was exactly as pictured. There was a great fireplace and she had a couple of radiator style electric heaters to warm up the place. I prefer it chilly however so the fire was perfect all by itself. 

We had a great time and we really enjoyed our stay. It was only about 10-15 minutes form downtown Seattle, so it was a short jaunt to get where we were going everyday. The cabin was great and the small lake it sits on was beautiful. We knew exactly what we were getting as the description of the place on AirBnB was spot on. We look forward to staying there again in the future. We would highly recommend it. "
107962,49849165,2015-10-06,31832285,Nina,"Roberta and Dan were lovely hosts, making sure to check-in with us at various points throughout our stay to ensure we were comfortable and enjoying our stay. The cabin was as described. 

My friend and I enjoy the quiet of the outdoors very much, and the Haller Lake Cabin was the perfect place for us to relax and unwind when we weren't exploring Seattle. My friend and I were impressed with how easy it was to navigate Seattle, and how close we were to the downtown area and other shopping delights. I especially appreciated Roberta and Dan have a ""Seattle Guidebook"" and other pamphlets about different Seattle highlights. I personally enjoyed being in the middle of nature, including watching the squirrels scamper about, the waterbirds, private lake, and checking out the tall cedars and huckleberry bushes on the property. Highly recommended. "
107962,50028663,2015-10-08,41872420,Riko,"The house was like a tree&cave house!! I could stay away from the every day:) Haller lake was also awesome.I recommend waking up early and drinking a cup of coffee beside the lake! And thanks to Roberta,I could feel comfortable in anything(cooking,shopping,and talking with her!)"
107962,50520874,2015-10-12,22419187,Tyler,"Roberta and Dan couldn't have been better hosts! They were very hospitable and accommodating, making sure we had everything we needed. Their cabin was exactly what we were looking for during our stay in Seattle. I would highly recommend choosing the log cabin for your stay. 
"
107962,50786302,2015-10-14,6688169,Thomas,"Roberta and Dan we're very nice. The cottage was awesome and in great condition. Many windows (and screens to keep the bugs out). The place is very private, quite, and surrounded by trees. You feel like you are at a lake resort but only 10 minutes drive from the hippest of Seattle's neighborhoods. We enjoyed listening to the many ducks and paddle-boating on the lake. However, our canoeing adventure quickly became a swimming adventure. Getting in a canoe is harder than it looks, but at least we have an embarrassing story to tell."
107962,51578026,2015-10-21,45292739,Caroline,"Polly is great! Her cabin is adorable. Is not far at all from downtown Seattle too. Polly greeted us when we arrived and gave us a tour. She let us borrow her paddle boat, and my bf and I took a quick ride on the pond before exploring Seattle. So fun!! I did get cold while sleeping, but she has two heaters and a fireplace provided, so no complaints here! Definitely stay here"
107962,52101505,2015-10-26,45104621,Amanda,"This cabin was amazing! Our stay was short, but sweet. Roberta was very welcoming during the initial tour and made us feel very comfortable (this was my first Airbnb experience so that was a major plus). Everything was exactly as described.. The perfect private, cozy little getaway just miles from downtown Seattle. The cabin itself was clean and had everything we needed, and the view of the lake was incredible. I would absolutely return for another 'staycation' in the future. "
107962,52378697,2015-10-28,31399362,Trey,"My wife Geri and I loved this little cabin.  Roberta was friendly and helpful, and once into the cabin we had full privacy for our stay.  It's a great little ""cabin in the woods"" yet only about 20 minutes from downtown. There was lots of room to park with no extra charge, a small fridge and a burner in case you want to cook. We highly recommend this to others! "
4933447,28025273,2015-03-16,2631813,Doug,"Great place! Very comfortable, safe, tasteful.  Hosts very welcoming and considerate. Gorgeous views from bed. Eager to return. A gem!"
4933447,28344430,2015-03-22,15479416,Darrah,"My experience was excellent with Markus and Melissa, everything and more than what they advertised. It was great to be close to SPU, and to be in a safe, cozy place that felt very safe. This is a well-remodeled space with the best bathroom ever (for an Airbnb) with heated floors 24/7, plush towels, and every assessory you could want in the cabinet (Q-tips, Advil, toothpaste). The shower had good shampoo and conditioner, which is really nice for those like me who fly to Seattle with no checked bags, and therefore we can't bring but a few ounces of our own liquids. When I first arrived, Markus was very friendly and came right down when I phoned to say that I could not figure out the way to open the lock. I accidentally left my charger, and Melissa contacted me immediately to say she would mail it back. I highly recommend!
"
4933447,28654487,2015-03-28,27662080,Christa,"Amazing place! I would definitely stay there again. Beautiful Queen Anne location, $6 lyft ride to downtown. Markus and Melissa are very thoughtful and had spare toiletries for if you accidentally forget something (which was great because I forgot my tooth brush). They even included a free dinner card for their restaurant down the street, The Sitting Room, the food is amazing. Area is quiet and night and you can beat the view of the bay. Better quality than many hotels I've stayed at. Highly recommend it! "
4933447,29222647,2015-04-05,23490281,Jessica,"The suite was a wonderful place to call home while we were visiting the Seattle area. It was clean, cozy, artsy and private. Great view, luxurious touches and thoughtful hosting provided by Markus and Melissa. Our experience was everything we could have hoped for in an airbnb - they have it down! We highly recommend this listing. "
4933447,29780611,2015-04-12,25283730,David,Markus and Melissa were such a great host! They provided such a lovely place for a friend and I to stay. Super kind and hospitable. It was in such a nice neighborhood and they provided us with suggestions on where to go in the city.  I would highly recommend reserving their place for your next stay in the area.  I cannot wait to head back to Seattle and I give thanks to them both. 
4933447,30333728,2015-04-20,30492601,Lisa,"The fragrance of the blooming lilacs greeted me in this neighbourhood with beautiful rock gardens. A quiet oasis, close to many attractions, a perfect location. The room was warm and tastefully decorated (loved the artwork and books). Markus and Melissa were easy to communicate with, helpful with directions, and provided many thoughtful touches to make me feel welcome (variety of teas, toiletries in the bathroom, a helpful guidebook).  This was my first air b and b experience and I don't think I will ever stay in an hotel again. Best. value. ever."
4933447,31240090,2015-05-03,6676403,Jennifer,What a delightful space Markus and Melissa have! We stayed two nights after our lease ended and before we left for farflung adventures. Their beautiful home and kind attentions will make us smile and recall our last nights in Seattle so fondly. Especially loved watching the ferries and hummingbirds from the picture window!
4933447,31646302,2015-05-08,10876924,Michelle,"I felt very welcomed by Markus and Melissa! The space was very large, comfortable, and such a beautiful view. They provided us with anything we needed and made sure we were taken care of as soon as we arrived! Also, the heated floors in the bathroom were awesome. "
4933447,31970199,2015-05-12,2000075,Will,"Both Marcus and Melissa were wonderful hosts, we were  very comfortable in their garden and loved being so close to everything. We didn't need our car at all and could walk or get the bus to wherever we needed to go."
4933447,33253149,2015-05-26,10636987,Nancy,Markus & Melissa made us feel welcome by letting us arrive early to drop off our things.  They checked in with us by text to make sure we had everything we needed.  
4933447,33995340,2015-06-03,31053489,Kristin,"So wonderful! We had an easy trip into Seattle and the location was not difficult to find. The space is very cozy and welcoming and we felt very at home. The location is IDEAL for getting anywhere in the city you would ever want to go. Very walkable, but also good by bus and we used Lyft on occasion. Great little touches, like the fridge and hot water kettle, tea and cups. The bathroom is spectacular! Very clean and I loved the extra toiletries and the fabulous shower. We did not meet Melissa but we did speak with Markus and he was very pleasant and helpful. We would certainly consider a stay at their place again! Thank you!"
4933447,34422022,2015-06-08,1365549,Peter,"Melissa & Markus's apartment is extremely tasteful and comfortable, it has been stylishly furnished, the bathroom is especially well designed with a walk in shower.
Melissa met us on arrival and kindly gave us all the necessary information, Markus bade us farewell, both were excellent hosts.
The Upper Queen Ann area is a safe neighbourhood with some wonderful views to the ocean. It is a 30 minute walk to the Space Needle, there are buses in the area to downtown.
We enjoyed our stay in this wonderful apartment in this beautiful city."
4933447,34673247,2015-06-10,34741655,Margaret,"Melissa welcomed us when we arrived since she was home and encouraged us to share their yard if we chose.  A little later, we sat for a short visit with easy conversation which made us feel comfortable in our choice of Airbnb.
We easily found the home as it was close to downtown and Bainbridge ferry.  The listing description was accurate and location of space related to main house allowed us to be as private as we wanted and included a covered parking space near its entrance.  We felt going to and fro did not disturb the hosts or neighbors."
4933447,35086488,2015-06-15,31310801,Faye,"The host made me feel very welcome by keeping in touch via text during my travels and waiting up until I arrived and explained the door entry code and made sure that I had everything I needed.
The listing description was very accurate.  The garden suite is great, well furnished, clean, comfortable, quiet and has everything that you would need: tea/coffee/kettle/fridge/hairdryer/iron  - even books and games.

4933447,35417132,2015-06-18,21897904,Kyle,The place was absolutely fantastic. Marcus was a great host and the room was perfect for what we needed. Taking the D-Line bus into Downtown Seattle was quick and easy and even a Cab ride was only $10 if you needed to get back late at night and didn't want to track down a bus.  The room was clean and very large relative to a hotel room. I'd highly recommend it. The parking situation was also perfect. 
4933447,36210909,2015-06-26,362533,Brett & Jenny,"Fantastic experience! Markus was friendly and on time to greet me when I arrived, and shared great recommendations for nearby places to eat. The space is so cozy, quiet, peaceful, and immaculately clean. The bed is comfortable, and the shower is beautiful. The view of the bay in the morning is a stunning way to wake up! A perfect airbnb experience.  Markus and Melissa have my highest recommendations!"
4933447,36705015,2015-06-30,35079504,Christine,"This was my first booking with airbnb. What a great experience. Everything worked out perfectly; from reservation to check-out. 
I had a wonderful stay. The room was very nice and clean, and I had everything I needed - and more. 
I could not have had better hosts, either. Melissa and Markus are super friendly, and were always available to give advice and to answer the questions I had. 
This was appreciated very much as it had been my first visit to Seattle. 
I highly recommend staying with Melissa and Markus. Thank you so much for making my stay such a wonderful one. "
4933447,37207795,2015-07-05,4554937,Alexis,"Our host came to introduce himself, which was nice, and check in to make sure all was going well for us. I felt rude that we didn't get more time to speak with Markus and Melissa, but our agenda was jam packed! Very comfortable and cozy room with great guide books, maps, and information about Seattle. Great for us since we didn't do much planning before. Great shower, clean, quiet. Nice extras to make sure the stay was smooth. (fridge, iron, fan, toiletries, etc.)"
4933447,37875657,2015-07-11,21824157,Cynthia,We can't say enough about how wonderful our experience was staying with Markus and Melissa. From the first time we booked the room they were available to answer questions and so helpful in assisting us in planning our trip. All if their tips and suggestions worked out so well. The room is the perfect size for 2 people. The bathroom is gorgeous. Art work on the walls was a great plus. It was quiet. It had a small refrigerator to put a few things in and they provided a tea pot and tea which was so nice. They were both very kind and accommodating. They were located close to a bus stop that took us to downtown easily. It was wonderful. We would return.
4933447,38858966,2015-07-19,34537627,Jeff,"Markus and Melissa were wonderful hosts and provide the ideal airbnb experience. From the neighborhood, to the room itself, we couldn't have found a better place to stay for our first time in Seattle. "
4933447,39294329,2015-07-22,31357815,John,"Melissa greeted us personally, and made sure everything was in place for a lovely stay: we also visited their terrific cafe (tasty antipasti, good cider on tap), and they even gave us a ride home with them!  Cozy, green and private."
4933447,39562348,2015-07-24,20940921,Justin,Markus and Melissa have a great space! It was all I could need or want in a rental. Based myself here for a business trip in Seattle. It was a good central location on a quiet street. The room was very private and convenient. My only regret was not having the time to meet the hosts! I will be attempting to stay here in the future.
4933447,41925400,2015-08-10,30112778,Connie,"Markus was very welcoming and greeted us right when we got to the gate of the house. He made sure to answer any questions we had, and he was very easy to get in touch to by text. The neighborhood was lovely and is close to many bus stops. The place itself exceeded our expectations. It is a cozy place with an amazing bathroom, and it has a separate entrance from the rest of the house for extra privacy. The wifi was also fast so another plus there! Overall, I had an amazing time staying at the Private Garden Suite, and would love to stay there the next time I'm visiting Seattle. "
4933447,42333935,2015-08-12,921651,Laura,"We enjoyed spending 2 nights in this very clean and well appointed room (with bath). Everything was as described, and there were even products provided if we had forgotten toothbrushes, etc. It was evident that the place had been recently renovated, all was in perfect condition. It was also nice to get to know the Queen Anne neighborhood, as we have not spent time there before. Good area to walk in and plenty of places to eat in the vicinity. Be sure to stop in at The Sitting Room, owned by Markus and Melissa, a good place to eat but not that close to the house.
The directions as to how to get into the room with the lock pad were accurate, and we met Markus several times later."
4933447,42536684,2015-08-14,35998142,Andrew,"My wife and I absolutely loved our stay with Markus and Melissa! The location is amazing and the view from the large window is very nice. Their hospitality was refreshing, especially after a frustrating flight in. We truly can't say enough good things to truly do them justice, we will definitely be using Markus and Melissa again :)"
4933447,43655870,2015-08-21,19747410,Jessica,"Markus and Melissa were very accommodating. It was easy to get into the room, and it was a perfect place to stay for a few nights. "
4933447,44439715,2015-08-26,13753706,Peter,"Markus and Melissa's space is amazing. You'll have a tough time finding a more private space that isn't an entire home -- separate entrance, combo lock so no need for keys, beautiful bed and bathroom. We met Markus briefly as we arrived. We were late but he was still there to greet us. He gave some great tips for the area and left us to explore. One of the best Airbnb experiences I've had."
4933447,45087711,2015-08-31,36875144,John,"I enjoyed my stay very much. The host was very helpful and the accommodations were great. I do think Pike Place Chowder is over-rated, however."
4933447,45486071,2015-09-03,29581007,Cynthia,"Thank you Markus and Melissa for sharing your wonderful Queen Anne area apartment with us. We loved it. This is a private space in a convenient, comfortable area of Seattle. For one or two people this space is perfect. Markus met us in the beginning and even invited us to his restaurant/bar that he owns. We went there and tried it out. He is a gracious host. The apartment is as pictured, actually better. There is a covered car port and lovely yard. Do not hesitate to work with Markus and Melissa. Thanks again."
4933447,45941707,2015-09-07,22861212,Venus,"Markus and Melissa are one of the friendliest people you could meet, they were simply lovely. The place was nice, neat, cosy and overall a very comfortable experience. They were very thoughtful providing the basics, and gave us a quick tour of Seattle on the first day. Its a great location, close to bus stops and Seattle Centre. The only points would be that the bed is a little high (but still very comfortable) and also the view is a little obstructed by trees - but nonetheless still beautiful. A special note to Melissa - the garden is gorgeous,  very well kept!"
4933447,46418801,2015-09-10,41253472,Debbie,"This was our first experience with airbnb and it exceeded our expectations.  Markus met us at the door to help with parking which was great. The room was spotless and the bathroom was beautiful!
They even had a chilled bottle of champagne waiting for us as it was our anniversary trip.  Above and beyond and so sweet!!!

My only suggestion would be to trim the hedge as to see the pretty view from the room.
It was a pleasure meeting you both!!!"
4933447,46574213,2015-09-12,30151208,Mark,"My wife and I stayed 2 nights at the Neshat's Airbnb and found it to be a very nice experience. Very clean, huge shower, nice bathroom, comfortable bed. View of bay is a bit obscured by the bushes, but otherwise a nice location for us, as we waited to board a cruise ship. 
Friendly, helpful folk. This was our first Airbnb experience, and we recommend this Suite for anyone looking for a clean, comfortable, accessible place to stay at an economical price with excellent hosts. "
4933447,47046014,2015-09-15,18070636,Delia,"Such a pleasant experience! This space had the MOST WONDERFUL shower, and a very comfortable bed. It was decorated very nicely, had gorgeous view, and very nice hosts. I highly recommended. It was also really clean."
4933447,47354118,2015-09-18,21956852,Chris,"Hosts made us feel welcome immediately. The private garden was by far the best AIRBNB that we have stayed in to date. The neighbourhood was also just as described. Every possible tiny amenity was provided, indicating a great deal of thought was put into what travellers need."
4933447,47629139,2015-09-21,30984817,Yvonne,"This was our first Air B & B experience and my first choice from the options I looked at for many reasons; the neighborhood was very quiet and safe, everything was accurately described, actually even more beautiful in person, though the pics. were quite impressive.
 Markus was waiting for us outside their home even though we were running late and was so very kind in making us feel at home in our beautiful quarters. He made sure we were able to unlock and lock the keyed mechanism to our entrance, which was important, as I'm not a technical savvy person. 
Markus availed himself to all questions we had about our stay throughout, even helping with clear shortcut directions to destinations. They provided lots of great information in a binder as you would find in any fine hotel. 
They really care for their guests and it shows, you see it in all the details, I'd call it a five star place. Perhaps that comes from running their own bistro. I'm sorry we didn't have time to use their voucher left for guests but were visiting a lot of family for a wedding and we weren't calling the shots.  
When traveling I don't usually sleep very well, but that didn't happen this time. I was pleasantly surprised by the comfort of the bed, not too firm or too soft, really great as well as the pillows. I loved that it was situated in a nook, both my husband and I had plenty of room. We couldn't have been more comfortable!
 Having a refrigator to keep a few things to eat when back at our base was definitely a plus for me as were the heated bathroom floors and spa like shower; a great selling point when looking at the pics. The lighting was excellent.
There were so many other amenities  provided which made for a first class experience, lots of thoughtful details that reflect the hosts' intentions.  
Thanks Markus & Melissa for putting all your efforts into making this a fantastic experience for us!! If we are in the Seattle area again we won't have to think twice.

4933447,48173481,2015-09-24,17221712,Yen,"This place is wonderful! Upon arriving, Markus checked me in very efficiently and gave me important information on how to get around. They have basic info packet in the room. All I needed to know was there so I was all set!

Getting around is easy. The bus stop is close and the bus comes often. I got to downtown very quickly. Queen Anne is also a beautiful neighborhood! The view is awesome!

I appreciate the keypad code to enter the room, I don't have to keep a key! The shower is amazing! The bed is very comfortable. This is a very good space.

I had my own entrance to the room so I did not see Markus and Melissa much. They left me their number so if had a question, I just texted. They were in touch. On my last night, I had tea in their kitchen just to chat. I really enjoyed them! What a lovely couple!"
4933447,49129744,2015-10-01,18318466,Nick,"What a lovely place to stay! We loved the room. It was super clean, full of useful info about Seattle, books, and all the other amenities we needed. We only ran into Markus when checking in, but he was friendly and would've been happy to help us if we needed anything else. We'd be happy to stay here again. "
4933447,49466562,2015-10-04,7723666,Steven,"The place is really a luxurious hotel suite, it has everything you need and is tastefully decorated. A great location in a remarkable city with kind hosts: a great place to stay!"
4933447,49900269,2015-10-07,15286282,Tracy,My stay with Markus and Melissa was delightful. The room was immaculate. They provided all the necessary and luxurious appointments to make a visit both comfortable and nurturing. The heated floor in the bathroom was fabulous! The view of the water from the sitting chair was beautiful. Communication was easy and prompt. Markus greeted me upon arrival and gave great recommendations/suggestions. I would stay here again in a heartbeat!
4933447,50096152,2015-10-09,556788,Gabriel And Victoria,We loved our stay with Markus and Melissa! Markus went out of his way to make sure we had all of our questions answered and couldn't have been a better host in general. Thanks to you we had an absolutely wonderful time in Seattle. Thank you so much for a fantastic stay!
4933447,50495839,2015-10-12,32252266,Jacqui,"Very friendly hosts, lovely quiet neighbourhood with a prett view. Everything we hoped for. "
4933447,51061644,2015-10-17,5436679,Kisha,"Markus and Melissa were lovely hosts. Markus was there to meet us when we arrived even though it was late at night. The space was perfect – lots of natural light and a gorgeous view, comfortable bed, beautiful art, a great bathroom/shower and all the amenities we needed! Markus and Melissa invited us to their cute restaurant/bar for a party where we stopped by for a drink and they gave us the most delicious chocolate mousse we've ever tasted! On our last day, they let us store our bags in their home while we were out and about. Queen Anne is not quite in the center of everything touristy which is nice. Their home is in an adorable, hilly neighborhood with a nice view of the bay. We took a ~45 minute scenic walk along the water to get to Pike Place market. This was a perfect place to stay for our first trip to Seattle and we will definitely be back."
4933447,51441609,2015-10-20,42288362,Kelly,The neighborhood was beautiful! Our host was very friendly and pleasant. The bed and room were super comfy.
4933447,51817005,2015-10-24,46506367,David,Very nice people and a very nice room. A very nice stay. Very pleasant and quiet. Very comfortable. Would love to return.
4933447,53216408,2015-11-06,6129228,Ashley,"The pictures don't do that shower justice! So big and spa-like, a real treat! We loved the spot- especially the private entrance and big window with a view of the city. A great book collection if you didn't bring anything to read! And so much cool artwork on the walls! Comfiest pillows ever! Thank you thank you!"
8015531,47425801,2015-09-18,28110871,Nathalie,"as described. all fine.  Wifi went out and host responded with a hot spot for me to use - which I needed during my stay to work.
Many thanks for that.!"
8015531,47773863,2015-09-21,37949185,Dana,Great place. Excellent location. 
8015531,48047944,2015-09-22,29749407,Danilo,"Charlotte was a prompt communicator and addressed our needs timely and accurately. Check-in is flexible and accommodating. Property was exactly as described, but really...extra emphasis on being the closest you can be to Pike Place Market without breaking the bank. Enjoyed our time here."
8015531,48156412,2015-09-23,44779596,Zixu,"Great location. walking distance to Pike Street Market and the Piers. We had dinner at the Crab Pot, which is about 5-10 mins walk from the apartment. "
8015531,48367071,2015-09-25,7074942,Cyn,"The apartment was in a prime location, right next to Pike Place and with every walkable convenience within reach.  It matched the description exactly and had a cozy bed, shampoo/conditioner, great linens, and was very clean.  "
8015531,48558346,2015-09-27,21744638,Lindsay,"This place is fantastic - it is a very large studio apartment in a perfect location. Only a couple of blocks from Pike Place market, conveniently located near the Light Rail station, secure and quiet. We came in for a Seahawks home game and easily walked to/from the stadium, which is just under a mile away. Easy to get in/out of the place with the lock box outside the building. Would definitely stay here again and recommend to others!

If you stay here, you MUST try the Turkish Latte at the Fonte Cafe a block away. It's heaven in a cup. "
8015531,48953589,2015-09-29,44505945,Elizabeth,The instructions to gain entry were clear and worked perfectly.  The space was absolutely immaculate.  This is a great location and easy to walk to most of the interesting areas like Pike Place market and Pioneer Square.  There were travel brochures and public transportation information in one of the drawers.  In addition for being in such a busy place it was very quiet at night.  Great find in the city.
8015531,49080295,2015-09-30,6381356,忠,"I love the short stay, the apt is amazing have nice location. I look forward to staying here again."
8015531,49636056,2015-10-05,42522072,Denise,"This location was perfect for touring all the ""must see"" sites in Seattle. Everything was in walking distance, we even walked to the stadium and space needle (a little over a mile in opposite directions from the studio). Charlotte was great with responding to any questions I had and was very helpful with my reservation. Everything was clean and comfortable for our stay. I would definitely recommend this studio for the location and comfort!"
8015531,50120322,2015-10-09,7009885,Thomas,"I am very pleased with my total experience with this rental. The apartment is beautiful, and well equipped with all the necessities, and is impeccably clean. The location, as noted in the reviews, is within walking distance to great restaurants and attractions. The key exchange is set up to make check-in and check-out a breeze. "
8015531,50374611,2015-10-11,45529155,Thatcher,I loved the apartment. It was very clean and in a perfect location within walking distance of many attractions.
8015531,50879272,2015-10-15,45033565,Gwen,"Charlotte responded quickly with great instructions for checking in, the building and condo were very stylish, with lovely amenities.  The neighborhood was outstanding for enjoying the downtown area.  Great shopping, dining and easy access to museums and walking along the water front.  Don't miss Fonte for wonderful coffee - just steps away.  I would love to stay here the next time I visit Seattle."
8015531,50973599,2015-10-16,17523616,Vivian,We couldn't find the sheets or blankets for the sofa bed and froze. Other than that we really liked the location. 
8015531,51103850,2015-10-17,44800483,Andy,"Excellent location, easy check in, clean condo"
8015531,51216638,2015-10-18,32857331,Raleigh,"The room was right in the heartbeat of the city with peekaboo water and stadium views.  Pikes market.  Clean and Spartan.  Very modern, comfortable firm bed.  We had a great stay!  Thanks Charlotte."
8015531,51399748,2015-10-19,14298346,Marcus,The place was immaculate 
8015531,51590889,2015-10-21,46734646,James,"The good: Neighborhood is great. Easy walking or can to anywhere downtown. Apartment was nice and clean. Comfy modern furniture was nice. There's no personal things in the apt so if feels more like a hotel stay. Very easy to grab the keys and get in. The bad:
The shower head in the bathroom is broken. It's cracked right down the side so when the shower was turned on it sprayed everywhere and soaked us and the bathroom. The plug in the drain of the tub was also hinky. I had to take it out and put the pieces back in correctly to get it to hold water. Had it not been someone savvy, they would not have been able to bathe. The balcony is not the whole upper floor as it appears in the photos. It's a tiny balcony which is fine. The workers starting on the roof at 8 am kinda killed the city view vibe. Looks like they're here for an extended job since they leave gear here overnight. Super loud pressure washing and general labor was being done 10 feet from our heads. That's what we woke up to. The refrigerator compressor kicks on constantly. It's very loud when everything else is off for the night. The parking situation isn't great. It was about $35 to park from check in until 10 the next morning. 
Overall, it's a great little apartment. The owner needs to do some repairs to the bathroom ASAP. We will be staying again on our overnight getaways from Vashon Island. "
8015531,51683025,2015-10-22,42682344,Brad,Great stay. Comfortable place
8015531,51811916,2015-10-24,28980709,Jessica,"Check-in instructions were crystal clear and easy. The room was just as listed.  We enjoyed the small balcony and view, and overall stay. Extremely good value for being so close to Pike Place."
8015531,51991061,2015-10-25,11741895,Robert,"The apartment was clean, spacious, and is perfectly located! Highly recommended."
