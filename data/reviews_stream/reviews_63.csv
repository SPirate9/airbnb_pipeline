443580,11029009,2014-03-17,11680132,Lisa,"We had a great weekend in Seattle, that includes of course the Sweet Cabin, the place was warm, clean, and cozy, and we can definitely recommend this to others. The main house is right beside the cabin and the cat is wonderful. Thanks for all, Monika."
443580,11275783,2014-03-27,9447483,Bo And Shaina,Thank youth!
443580,11525757,2014-04-06,9998388,Eric,The Cabin is very nice and the facilities are very accessible. Monika is a prompt and helpful host.
443580,12083540,2014-04-22,11680132,Lisa,"Second stay in the cabin, and still all good and clean. The place is very convenient for a weekend stay in Seattle when you spend most time going round town."
443580,13620994,2014-06-01,15108976,Paige,"We stayed in the sweet cabin and it was lovely. Monika was out of town during our stay, but her roommate Erin was so nice and accommodating. Definitely getting your money's worth here. "
443580,49692749,2015-10-05,845466,Max,"The ""cabin"" is essentially one of those large sheds you can buy at home depot that a bed was tossed in. There was one lamp with no light bulb and two bulbs were burnt out in the ceiling. There is a space heater but when you turn it on it gets extremely stuffy and smells metallicy. So we opened the small window which doesn't have a screen which explains why we found a bug in the bed. The yard is super messy and the front gate is broken, so its wide open and you feel kind of exposed to the busy street when your sleeping in a shed. Also you dont get wifi out in the shed. Getting up to pee in the middle of the night was tricky. By 2 am, one of those huge northwest spiders built a web in our door frame that my girlfriend almost ran face first into (I understand this isnt the hosts fault and just bad luck) then you have to search around for the code to get into the house. In all honesty I felt like I was back in Thailand backpacking in a hostel. I never met the host as we got there late, but they were very friendly in the email they sent and made sure we were informed about places to go and public transportation options.  The house is very close to downtown which is great. The place could be a very nice stay if the host put just a little more effort in to making it more comfortable and clean. We felt it was way to expensive for what we received."
443580,49863881,2015-10-06,15097585,Kevin,"Everything was awesome, thanks "
443580,50028540,2015-10-08,17939587,Elizabeth,"My partner and I had a lovely stay at Monika's. The directions to the house and instructions for our stay were very thorough. This house has a few different air bnb rooms I believe and we stayed in the cute, little cabin in the front of the house. The bed was VERY comfortable and the shower in the maine house was great. Thanks for a nice stay!"
443580,50126271,2015-10-09,5326801,Jon,"Our stay was perfect.  It was nice to have our own private space in a nice, quaint cabin that was separate from the rest of the house. Monika and Ryan were super nice and helpful. They made our stay super easy and convenient. Plus the location was great.  We would definitely stay here again. "
443580,51306533,2015-10-19,43698378,Mitchell,"The listing was fairly accurate. The pictures made me feel like it would be a little nicer. All in all we were looking for the cheapest stay that was close to the city, and that is what we got. 
It would have been nice to meet the host and feel like there was a game plan. We kind of felt like strangers there. We weren't very aquainted with the set up for our stay. Fortunately the email to prepare brought up all the essentials. "
443580,51465024,2015-10-20,10926340,Perrin,"We only stayed one night, so was quick to judge.
However, I can say that the location is good, in a quiet area, but not far from the busy downtown.
Near by a nice movie theatre is playing old movies while you take dinner, and the famous Public Market is at 10min bus ride...

The house is cute, but we stayed in the cabin, that is a bit humid during the night... for a short stay it was ok. Maybe in summer it's better and you can enjoy the garden.

Otherwise Monika gave us all the informations we needed and was easy and quick to answer if any questions!

Thanks Monika."
443580,51594083,2015-10-21,46814413,Maxwell,"The cabin was very clean and comfortable. The location is ideal for walking to a lot of places in Capitol Hill. We got back to the cabin pretty late at night so I didn't get a chance to meet our hosts, but I would definitely stay here again."
443580,51743349,2015-10-24,15619449,Amanda,"Everything was just as described. It was simple and comfortable, which was all I needed. It is a single-room structure, furnished with a bed, bedside table, garment rack, set of drawers, and space heater. The cabin is about the size of a very large shed, but insulated and outfitted on the inside like a home. Pretty cool! The bathroom is in the main-house about 10 feet away, and easy access was provided with a code to that door. I actually arrive very late, 11pm and left at 10am the next morning. Monika made check-in and check-out so easy such that I actually didn't meet her. Everything was arranged for me and I had an easy and comfortable place to sleep for the night which was just what I needed."
443580,51935936,2015-10-25,18408496,Jenny,"Great stay in the cabin. It took me a while to get used to the locks, but it wasn't too big of a deal. Very simplistic and had everything I needed.  I didn't get to meet Monika or Ryan, but my friend did, and said that he was really nice. We interacted with some of the guests, who were all really nice and interesting people. The only downside is that the bathtub was a little scary for me to get out of because it was so tall and high (I'm 5'1"") but still had a positive experience overall! They even have a space heater in the cabin, which is great since it gets chilly in there! "
443580,52933835,2015-11-02,7939689,Miranda,The cabin was exactly what I expected and easier to access than I thought. Thanks for a quick and stress free stay Monika!
443580,53021380,2015-11-03,25892979,Janine,"Perfect place for a quick overnighter!  Met with Ryan the House Manager, pleasant and helpful.  Plenty of hot water for a shower and the bed was quite comfy and the room cozy and warm.  Will return!"
443580,53251226,2015-11-07,43758559,Matias,"It's a lovely cabin, the neighborhood is nice, pretty close to anything you might need and extremely comfortable :)"
443580,53475188,2015-11-09,44477924,Lina,Simple yet cozy cabin in a nice neighborhood within walking distance of a lot of what Seattle has to offer! Everything was nicely arranged and Ryan was home most of the time to answer any questions one might have. Only downside was that it was raining pretty much constantly (but I guess that's what Seattle is like in November). 
443580,54582940,2015-11-22,16403971,Cecily,Definitely a cozy space to sleep after a long day of exploring Seattle.
443580,54732729,2015-11-23,5927807,Margo,"Barebones and basic (a bed in a shed), but clean and affordable.  A bit of a funky smell (tho I am hyper-sensitive).  I ran into Ryan a couple of times and he is super nice.  The ""sweet cabin"" served my purpose well for an overnighter for an event at The Town Hall, which is within walking distance.  Not a lot of charm but perfectly adequate and a good choice for the price."
443580,55547866,2015-12-01,7904118,Elena,"The cabin was perfect for my needs. It was quiet and private and as an overnight guest I felt totally at home. When I arrived the cabin was heated and had fresh towels and extra warm blankets on the bed which kept me cozy. I also had a nice long 10 hour sleep because of the curtains which blocked off almost all the light and the bed was REALLY comfortable. Street parking was available right outside and you're pretty much near all the best shops and restaurants in the Capitol Hill area (my fave!). No other guests were staying at the big house so it was nice to have the kitchen and and bathroom to myself, and everything was super clean. As far as showering - the claw foot bathtub was a nice experience. Overall, would highly recommend. "
443580,55813367,2015-12-06,29830192,Tiffy,"The cabin and bed were clean and toasty. We had a good night's sleep and the neighbourhood was quiet. Too bad there was heavy construction work on the way to the cabin from downtown core.  Unfortunately, we didn't get a chance to meet Monika. It's pretty much a self-serve BnB with all the amenities and written guide provided for independent travellers."
443580,56903724,2015-12-19,18314606,Joyce,"Perfect house!! Monika wasn't there when we arrived.But we met Ryan. Ryan is super nice!!!! He took good care of everything. The room is really cozy and clean. The location is good too. 2mins walk to bus stop. 3/4 take you to downtown in 20mins or so.  Perfect house, perfect host, perfect location, reasonable price. Really recommend!!!"
116221,326647,2011-06-21,606338,Nancy,"
This is a lovely home for a weekend retreat. It is close to everything in Fremont...all within walking distance. 

The only ""hardship"" is the lack of parking. It is on-street parking, which meant circling around for blocks trying to find a place. We often parked 2 to 6 blocks away from the Condo.

All in all it was a fun weekend...we would rent there again."
116221,356457,2011-07-06,613623,Celes,"This truly is a beautiful, light-filled condo in a great neighborhood with easy access to Fremont and Ballard!  We had a great stay and would recommend it to anyone who wants to get a real feel for a great part of the city!"
116221,394914,2011-07-25,607734,Aki,"Spent a few nights here and enjoyed it thoroughly. The condo is very quiet and peaceful. Also liked Fremont a lot, it is a lot livelier with cafes and restaurants than one would presume by looking at the Google maps' street view images. Buses to downtown and back are easy to catch. My only minor gripe was that there was no wireless in the condo itself (I was under this impression when booking) - the close-by cafes do all have free wireless, so if you're happy with that, then this place is a great choice."
116221,462332,2011-08-21,730979,Jason,"Stayed here for the better part of our ten-day trip to Puget Sound, and it deserves all five stars--though if I were a very light sleeper, I might give it four, due to the heavy early-morning traffic on 39th St.  No problem that closing the windows wouldn't mostly solve, but the weather was so great this August that we kept them open.  The apartment is beautiful and ought to be given the respect it deserves, so please don't plan any big parties.  There is a lot of original art work in the living space, and there were no uninteresting books among the lot; so the owners are (in one of many possible worlds) probably poets who rent out their space in order to live without having to worry too much about money.  Fremont is a very cool neighborhood before the witching hours of say, 11pm and into the night, when the drag several blocks away becomes populated with a few obnoxious youngsters who seem to have traveled from elsewhere (New Jersey?) to occasionally pollute Fremont's otherwise pleasant alleys and backstreets with the stink of unthreatening-but-still-abrasive ignorance.  Quiet drinks with old friends seem to be hit-or-miss.  But, to be fair, we only had time to try this out on three occasions after the aforementioned witching hour.  All this considered, my wife and I would stay here again in a heartbeat.  We love Fremont entirely for its imperfection.  There are many city neighborhoods in the world that take themselves too seriously--if that makes any sense.  There's mostly good stuff here, though, and the peoples' love for their neighborhood seems refreshingly unironic in our snarky age.  I wish I had such a great grocery co-op in my neck of the woods, and a bar where people can hang out with their dogs and with other peoples' dogs.  We were so close to our friends in Wallingford and Ballard; and the quick rides into downtown Seattle or the U-District were as easy as ten minutes.  We'd stay here again in a heartbeat.  Thank you Luke and Danni!"
116221,487640,2011-08-30,807575,Julie,"Lovely little condo— very colorful and comfortable. Lots of books and art. Super convenient to my best friend's Fremont apartment and a good landing spot for Seattle adventures. Three of us fit into the condo— though I think it would be more comfortable for just two. The couch wasn't quite long enough for our third companion to sleep on but there was an air mattress as well. Pretty quiet although 39th was a bit noisy at night—I find city noise to be a comfort but if you're a light sleeper, plan on shutting the windows. I would totally stay here again.

Great hosts overall—this was my first airbnb experience and they were super helpful and accommodating of my newb-ness. "
116221,502276,2011-09-05,856079,Lulu,"My partner and I had a wonderful stay at this gorgeous and colourful Fremont flat.  Pluses: the flat is lovely and impeccably maintained, we loved the ambiance and the artwork; the neighbourhood and location for getting around Seattle are both great.  Minuses: street traffic is pretty noisy (we're both urban dwellers and still had a bit of trouble sleeping -- this place is not for you if you're a light sleeper); no wireless internet.  Also, we've never stayed anywhere where we were expected to do the laundry and replace linens after our stay -- not a huge deal, but it would have been nice to know this in advance since we'd assumed it'd be covered by the cleaning fee we paid."
116221,4691097,2013-05-20,4153210,Kimberlee,Luke and Danni were great hosts! They apartment was very clean and filled with everything that one might need. They're recommendations for what to do in the neighborhood were awesome!
116221,6580784,2013-08-18,5766537,Jennelle,"I stayed in Luke & Danni's condo for 2 and half months over the summer. The condo itself is clean, quiet and full of light--even after dark, Luke & Danni have placed lamps everywhere to maintain a very warm and cozy environment! The kitchen is well stocked with any utensil you would need for cooking.

The condo is as close as you could get to downtown Fremont and still maintain quiet on the weekends. I came expecting lots of street noise based on other reviews, but I never had a huge problem with it. I'm from Iowa, so my tolerance for that kind of thing is near zero. 

As hosts, Luke & Danni were extremely accommodating and always open to suggestions on how they could make my stay more comfortable. I appreciated that they let me keep to myself, but were always responsive if something needed their attention. Their prompt support and willingness to go above and beyond for me even before I moved in is what made my first airbnb experience as effortless as possible!"
116221,6677511,2013-08-20,1698056,Katie,"We felt right at home! If you’re looking for an extended stay, or a short stop over, this gorgeous apartment is for you. My husband and I traveled around the Pacific Northwest for two weeks, and this was the last stop on our trip. We stayed in several places, and this was by far my favorite. Danni and Luke were easy to communicate with and responded within hours of my request. When we arrived, Danni took the time to familiarize us with the apartment and even took us through a well-prepared welcome document that included everything from restaurant recommendations, to suggested area attractions, to an amazing hike steps from their doorsteps. The apartment is beautiful, clean, and like most people have noted, has lots of light. Although we went out to eat both nights we were there, the kitchen is stocked with everything you need to prepare a meal. This place has got the 3 C’s – comfortable, clean, and cozy! And, we will definitely return the next time we’re in Seattle. "
116221,6712899,2013-08-22,4770339,Martin,"What a great find and what lovely hosts! This top floor flat is just a beauty, and in such an amazing location! The windows are great and the place is very clean and stylish. We spent the majority if our time out on the patio, what a view! Fully equipped with anything you could need, great kitchen, laundry...I could go on. One more special thing I would like to comment on was the acoustic bass guitar in the flat, I had a blast playing with it...couldn't put it down! Looking forward to recommending to my friends!"
116221,6783437,2013-08-25,325016,Andy,"We stayed at Luke & Danni's place for three nights. They were very welcoming and accommodating, and the place itself is in a really great neighborhood. We couldn't ask for more. I'd easily recommend it to anyone else. "
116221,6877450,2013-08-28,7973622,Betsy,"We had a great experience at Luke and Danni's condo. The space was very clean, comfortable, and definitely light-filled. They had breakfast food available, which was nice. Fremont was a nice neighborhood. We went to some great restaurants and really enjoyed the local Sunday market. It was easy to take a bus into downtown.

Other people have been a little bothered by the street noise. While you can hear cars from the bedroom, the noise didn't bother us. "
116221,7013600,2013-09-03,7389793,Annaliese,"We had such a lovely time staying at Luke and Danni's lovely condo. This was our first Airbnb experience and it set very high expectations for the next one. The apartment is charmingly and thoughtfully decorated. The kitchen and living areas are stocked with everything you might need during your stay. It is a perfect location for exploring Seattle - it's steps away from the Fremont restaurant/bar scene and a short bus or Uber from Belltown, Ballard, Capitol Hill, Queen Anne etc. 

Luke and Danni are great hosts. They were very responsive over email and Danni was even there to welcome us when we arrived! She showed us all around the apartment and gave us great recommendations for things to do. She also left her own typed guide to Seattle, some milk and homemade granola.

It was an absolutely wonderful  experience and I wouldn't change a thing!"
116221,7077603,2013-09-05,7988191,Nancy,"Lovely, apt, very clean and quiet.  Aprreciated the granola, juice and fruit.
We arrived late for a 2 night stay. Apparently thid was a big deal. We were unreachable in the North cascades but did not know that before we eft. As soon as we returned to a cell phone receptive area we called.
We were shown where the vacuum cleaner was, cleaning supplies, required to use the squeegee on bathroom tiles, Instructios about how to use the dishes and sipose of trash. Been using B&B's for 30 years and never expected to clean especially after paying a $30 cleaning fee.
Also no reading ight on one side of the bed. That is not asking for too much. $347 was not cheap for our stay. 
We were never able to relax or feel welcome.
But I see lot's of positive reviews so I doubt this one disappointed guest will have a negative impact which is fine with me. Just not planning to return and hope to avoid AirB&B. You charge $35. for the privilege of staying at one of your propeorties and have no listed phone number. Just a big hassle and the least fun part of our stay in Seattle. Back home in New England ready to can tomatoes and await the fall colors."
116221,7150888,2013-09-08,5926213,Pamela,"We came to Seattle for some personal business and not so fun things... When we arrived at the condo, our spirits were lifted with the cheery, bright, light-filled condo and Danni's kind soul. The condo is a true reflection of the Fremont area with it's lovely fresh art, bright paint and fabric color choices, and the friendly neighbors across the street.  Excellent use of a small space with size appropriate furniture and appliances. Love the skylight, too! I appreciated the use of local organic products in the home and convenience in the very walkable Fremont neighborhood to art, shops, and overall quirkiness of Fremont. "
116221,7203758,2013-09-10,4149431,Tricia,"Very nice and clean apartment, the rooftop was really cool to see at night. The street noise didn't bother me much, and even though parking was hard to find, after we got settled in a slot opened right in front of the building, so we just moved our car (problem solved.) It was very convenient to the canal and Farmers Market. "
116221,41757909,2015-08-09,33522471,Valerie,"We had a great time in Danni's apartment. It is the perfect home to experience Seattle. We loved the location in the inspiring Fremont area with tons of restaurants, cafes and bars in walking distance. Going downtown with the bus was also very easy and takes only about 15 min. The apartment itself is very clean and has a nice atmosphere. Danni was a great host, easy to communicate. She had bought everything for healthy breakfast with homemade granola, which we loved. We will always come back when we are in the area and totally recommend the place."
116221,42706440,2015-08-15,31132410,Tamar,"This bright Fremont condo was as beautiful as it looks in the photo.  It was lovely and comfortable.  We appreciated the ""what's on"" guides that our host left for us. We enjoyed exploring Fremont, and trying out the different coffee shops, walking along the boat canal and trying a flight of cider at the cider bar!"
116221,43280846,2015-08-18,31654343,David,"This is a very nice room, definitely a bargain for the location, quality of accommodation, and price.  It was within easy walking distance of Fremont shops and restaurants, and couple block walk to the #5 bus, 10 minutes to Pikes Place.  Danni made me feel really welcome.  I'll definitely be staying here again."
116221,43781590,2015-08-22,7187550,Jenn,"Danni was an exceptional host!  She was very welcoming and made the process from initial inquiry to check out very easy.  The home itself is very warm and inviting,brightly lit and super clean - and it's in a superb location in Freemont and only 15 car ride to Seattle.  While the road outside seems busy, the apartment is actually very quiet.  A major bonus was the extensive information packet that Danni put together to help navigate not only Freemont but places to visit all around the general area from touristy activities to local eateries and even the best way to get there!  She also left very detailed information about the apartment itself from parking to garbage disposal which i found very helpful.  My daughter and i were visiting from PA to look for housing for her as she is going to school here in the Fall.  Danni's home was a perfect fit for us.  It's a beautiful clean space with all the amenities you can think of even a washer dryer!  I can't say enough good things about Danni and her lovely place!  "
116221,44021584,2015-08-23,16446467,Matt,"Nice, cozy, and clean apartment. Close to great restaurants, pubs and sights. Our tour guide even said that Fremont was her favorite Seattle neighborhood. The ""secret"" rooftop deck was a nice surprise!"
116221,44665950,2015-08-28,20945228,Jordan,Our experience was fantastic!! Parking was easy to find and our location was great. The place was super clean and Danni was readily available at all times. Would definitely stay here again! 
116221,45300253,2015-09-01,1653778,Ashley,"We loved our stay at Danni's apartment.  The place was very clean, organized, welcoming, and we loved looking at the eclectic art.  It was only a $10 uber to downtown Seattle, or about an hour walk.  We enjoyed doing both to get around.  Our favorite part of the stay was shopping around Pike Place Market and then cooking our gourmet meal at Danni's home.  We had all of the necessary cooking tools to make a delicious meal.  We highly recommend taking advantage of the kitchen!"
116221,56234969,2015-12-11,31731792,Christine,This is a lovely place to stay - convenient to many things and easy to access public transportation.  Danni was a wonderful host - making me feel welcome from day one.  The apartment had everything I needed - and even things I didn't need.  I would recommend this apartment to anyone looking for a nice place to stay in the Fremont neighborhood.  
116221,58175828,2016-01-01,31654343,David,My hostess emailed me in advance to arrange and appointment.  She was prompt and very pleasant to deal with.
7922663,58068751,2015-12-31,51351712,Maureen,"Mehrit's place was great. Everything was convenient and clean The room number 2 is very pretty, with soft sheets on the bed and a good heater that made the winter nights very comfortable. Unfortunately there was a regular noise, probably made by household appliances.
If you need to be well taken care of, Mehrit and Roko are the perfect hosts for you."
7201336,37924980,2015-07-11,10349305,Derek,"She was a great host. Was there when I arrived, showed me around and went back off to work. Thank you!"
7201336,38354451,2015-07-14,34943179,Matt,Leela was nice. Green Lake is walkable from here. Good place to crash if you're on your own. It's quite close to I-5 so if you're a light sleeper you might want to bring a pair of earplugs.
7201336,39431103,2015-07-23,37243849,Joseph,"This was a very nice place to stay, with a good location near the University.  Walking to campus took around 30 minutes, with plenty of good places to eat between my research hours.  Leela was very nice, even though I keep to myself mostly.  Location is near the highway which wasn't bad although you can faintly hear it."
7201336,39854503,2015-07-26,5244833,Vivian,"Spacious, clean and well-equipped room, less than 10 mins to downtown Seattle, close to highway, very convenient but you do hear the traffic from the room, earplugs will be helpful if you are a light sleeper.  Leela was helpful and kept good communications."
7201336,42615052,2015-08-14,1745409,Anne,"The room is super cute in a nice house.  Leela was very welcoming.  The house is right by the highway and construction, but with a fan in the window I really didn't notice and slept great.  Easy commute to downtown Seattle by bus or car. "
7201336,43424751,2015-08-19,6485259,George,"Great stay! Clean room with comfy bedding and a nice space. I know some people have made note about the car noise from the freeway, but with the windows closed the sound is minimal - I hardly heard it. Leela was kind and accommodating and afforded me a pleasant stay!"
7201336,44596474,2015-08-27,26596137,Marlene,The room in Leela's apartment was comfortable and cute. It's in a great location very close to Greenlake and the U-District. Easy access to the freeway. 
7201336,45421615,2015-09-02,27026294,Neva,"Leela had a lovely home and although we didn't see much of each other it was a great place to stay. Close to some really great restaurants, wholefood market, easy access to downtown via public transport and green lake is only a short walk away. The traffic from the free way never stops but I  wore ear plus and didn't have a problem sleeping, and I'm a very light sleeper. The house was clean, cosy and welcoming."
7201336,48256030,2015-09-24,44539351,Eléonore,Leela was super nice. She gave me a key so that I could come and go as I wished and respected my privacy. The bed was amazingly comfortable and the bedroom quite cosy. The bathroom was okay. Thanks Leela!
7201336,48830474,2015-09-28,12958880,Vishal,Leela's place is as described in the listing. It is an artist's work room. It is a small upstairs room with a common entrance but I never had a problem with getting in and out. Good place for staying for few nights and specially for someone who has something to do at University of Washington.
7201336,50545806,2015-10-12,24333524,Evan,"Leela was such a great host during my stay. My flight had a sever delay, and she was still so sweet and accommodating to make me feel welcome. Very cute Victorian style home in a convenient location without any parking issues. Thanks so much!"
7201336,53784851,2015-11-12,48174598,Kevin,"Leela was great, very welcoming. Room was actually bigger than expected. Convenient location."
7201336,53909537,2015-11-14,9434671,Laura,"A spacious room with a really comfy bed! There's some noise from the traffic, but it's really not so bad. Very convenient for getting downtown. Would recommend to any other solo travellers."
7201336,57850298,2015-12-29,6894612,Airick,"Leela was an absolutely wonderful and wise host. She was intelligent, informative, and quite hospitable. I would be honored to stay with her again."
8009814,47389088,2015-09-18,41744625,Nick,"Kate lives in a beautiful neighborhood and she is an extremely gracious host with the two cutest cats ever. If you plan on visiting the area, you can't go wrong with Kate and her bungalow."
2011193,18013356,2014-08-20,8852648,Jose,We loved our stay! Highly recommend. The house is centrally located and is a true northwest experience. Marne was a wonderful host and was very attentive. Our stay exceed our expectations. 
2011193,29376387,2015-04-07,2277497,Raghu,The reservation was canceled 3 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
2011193,37145243,2015-07-05,30451289,Fabian,"Charming house, exquisite location. 5 blocks away from restaurants, supermarkets. Short drive from Ballard, U Washington, Pike place, etc. Marne is a thoughtful host and prepped the house for our arrival. We found snacks on the dining table meant for us. Clean towels, toiletries, pots/pans, even an airbed setup for our kids. We stayed in the basement which stayed cool on hot summer days. 

During our holiday we drove around Seattle, returning to the house to rest the night or pickup equipment. Parking was relatively easy, could always find some in the side streets.

The highlight of the stay was the 4th of July fireworks event. The house is right by where people gather to watch the fireworks. Our kids really enjoyed the fireworks. 

I definitely recommend Marne's aparment for your next AirBnB trip to Seattle. It was our first AirBnB and a very pleasant one."
2011193,43601656,2015-08-21,26634331,Alice,We had a very nice stay at Marne & family's house which is very well situated in the city and cosy. 
7431247,42734617,2015-08-15,28387632,Katharina,"We had a Great stay in Seattle!

We had booked another accommodation before, but unfortunately they cancelled our booking 2 weeks before our trip started.
So we have sent a message to Evan and explained our situation. Because he was on a trip at the same time than our stay, a friend of him  welcomed us at his appartment and showed us everything. 
Even we didn't meet Evan personally we felt really welcomed, because there was a personal note waiting for us. 
The appartment is exactly as shown on the pictures and really clean.
Evan is really hospitable, friendly and helpful. 
We can definetly recommend this appartment and would book it again if we come back to Seattle one day."
6328150,33165643,2015-05-25,32233108,Amy,Our host was super friendly and accommodating with our check in and out times. Very clean apartment on the top floor. Great location thats close to Pike Place Market/Aquarium and the Space Needle/EMP Museum/Pacific Science Center.  We were in prime location for using the Seattle CityPass which I would recommend for a weekend. 
6328150,33609860,2015-05-30,33296168,Kelley,A wonderful apartment in a great part of town. Close to everything and very comfortable!
6328150,36792830,2015-07-01,34229535,Sarah,"Evren was awesome, and so was her Airbnb! I really enjoyed my stay. The apartment was clean, comfortable, and very nice. "
6328150,40792418,2015-08-02,37921249,Izna,The apartment was very comfortable and centrally located. Evren was super accommodating about check out times and was very responsive to my questions/concerns both before and during my stay. 
6328150,46081508,2015-09-07,21398149,Leonard,"Evren (and her apartment) is great! She wasn't around the weekend I was in town, but she made sure to pass on her favorite local spots. She was also available and responded to messages quickly.

The unit itself is clean and well kept and in a great spot in downtown Seattle. It quiets down in the evenings, but you still get some of the urban chatter. Really nothing else to say... Thanks, Evren!"
6328150,46797374,2015-09-13,43066774,Anthony,"Great studio apartment in a fab location.  Handy for Light Rail Link from airport and to the sports stadiums as well as Belltown restaurants and bars and downtown.

Evren was very accommodating and helpful."
6328150,47415980,2015-09-18,6414308,Jeffery,"When I visit Seattle I usually stay at the Warwick hotel, which is just across the street from Evren's apartment. I highly recommend staying at Evern's as an alternative to a hotel. Her place was clean and cozy and she has all the little things that come in handy when you're traveling, like an iron and coffee :) If you're not familiar with Seattle you can take it from me - the location is excellent - right in between the marketplace and the needle and walking distance to both. "
6328150,48593402,2015-09-27,43811861,Katie,This studio is a great place to stay in the city.  All the essentials were provided and apartment was very clean.  Great location near many stores and apartments.  Thanks again for a great place to stay!
6328150,49489266,2015-10-04,39049081,Claire,"The apartment was very conveniently located both to public transit, and right in the middle of downtown. The host's recommendations for places to eat and visit were wonderful. Instructions for checking in were easy to understand. Very happy that we were able to stay here. "
6328150,51819306,2015-10-24,6828964,Manu,Excellent experience! Fully recommend!
6328150,53639387,2015-11-10,6524006,David,"The apartment was comfortable and quieter than i expected.  Perfect for a short stay in the heart of the city. You cant beat the location.  Note, for those who need high speed internet to do work, the wifi is actually 4g. Evren was very responsive."
6328150,54168738,2015-11-16,27244760,Diane,Great location and Evren was quick to answer our questions.
6328150,55432854,2015-12-01,29994864,Tyacie,Great location close to everything.  Secure building.  Listing as described.  Very clean and cozy.  Host was available easily and quickly over email for the duration of our stay. Thanks! 
5632713,40977573,2015-08-03,2078001,Emma,"This was a fantastic airbnb choice. The RV has been lovingly redecorated and has everything you could need. There's a kitchennette, sitting room and cosy bedroom. We slept really well there. Thank you Jeremy for being a great host."
5632713,41805494,2015-08-09,37944707,Jim,"Fine hosts.  Nice place, all as described, comfortable bed, private.   "
5632713,43967303,2015-08-23,7573755,Danielle,"We had a fantastic time at the RV! It's the perfect budget option for a stay in Ballard. You can tell the hosts want you to feel comfortable in the space with the nice-smelling soaps and snacks. My husband and I appreciated how cozy it was. Also close to some delicious places to eat like Delancey, Honore Artisan Bakery and Un Bien, which was Jeremy's recommendation. I'd very much encourage people to stay. "
5632713,44710707,2015-08-28,17121562,Lynn,"Nice, cozy, clean, comfortable and convenient. What's not to like about that? Jeremy was a great host, and had good recommendations for places to eat in the neighborhood. The area was quiet, but easy access to 15th Avenue made getting around simple.  "
5632713,44950166,2015-08-30,39939110,Hannah,"Jeremy and Family were wonderful hosts! Before I had even asked, they let me know that the BBRV was clean and ready, and gave me lots of information prior to my arrival about how to operate everything inside. It rained heavily one night and Jeremy made sure everything was fine and that there weren't any leaks :) It was a beautiful little get-away, stocked with lots of thoughtful features. The neighborhood was very quiet during my stay, but near all of the fun that Ballard has to offer! I will be recommending the BBRV to any seattle-goers that I know of, and would love to stay again!"
5632713,45818924,2015-09-06,16672871,Rachel,I had a great time.  The info packet was very comprehensive and the little notes that Jeremy put around were helpful as well.  It was clean and comfy.  He let me do my own thing. He was very responsive on text and email. I loved staying here.  I had a rental car and getting here was pretty straight forward. 
5632713,46229052,2015-09-08,4400211,Vic,"After a day out on the town we always looked forward to coming back to BBRV! If anyone has reservations about staying in an RV, let me just say: it's awesome. I can't imagine a more fun and luxurious stay. While the interiors of most off-the-lot RVs are pretty tacky, Jeremy has put a lot of work into making BBRV feel very modern and homey with brand new wood floors and tasteful decor.

We didn't interact much with Jeremy,which speaks to how effective of a host he is. Entering and exiting the property is quick and discreet and all the information we needed was provided throughout the home.   He makes sure all of the amenities are taken care of including toiletries, beverages, and snacks, which were much appreciated. Thanks Jeremy!"
5632713,48220882,2015-09-24,43801662,Emily,Loved staying at the BBRV! I often travel to Seattle from Vancouver  for short trips and will definitely consider staying here again. 
5632713,49215999,2015-10-02,37944707,Jim,All was exactly as described and as promised.  Extremely nice hosts.
5632713,50184204,2015-10-10,39938660,Abby,This backyard RV was just what we needed for our trip to Seattle. It's in a convenient location to all the sites and has several great nearby restaurants. Jeremy was very helpful and prompt with communication! The RV was clean and had everything we needed. Would definitely consider returning if we come back to Seattle!!
5632713,51161525,2015-10-18,24368092,Taira,"My (now) Fiance' and I had a wonderful stay at Jeremy's airbnb. The space was cozy, clean, and a fun place to ""camp"" in the city. The location was unbeatable -- so many great places to walk to in downtown Ballard, and really easy to catch the D Line direct to downtown. I definitely recommend a stay at Jeremy's if you find yourself in Seattle!"
5632713,53140785,2015-11-05,4203248,Autumn,"Jeremy and his family have created such a thoughtful, clean, quiet, lovely place to stay. I was able to walk to many places and felt like I had my own little oasis in the bustle of Seattle. Excellent Airbnb!! Thanks Jeremy!"
5632713,53751689,2015-11-12,41213704,Margy,"Jeremy and Suzanne were great hosts who paid attention to all the things that make one feel at home.  They provided breakfast items, milk, tea and coffee.   The towels were thirsty, the bed was super comfortable.  The RV is surprisingly spacious. We enjoyed our time here!"
5632713,54910919,2015-11-25,15655835,Yao,We had a really nice stay. The RV is very beautiful and we had everything we need there. Jeremy is very friendly. I totally recommend staying here. :)
5632713,55215771,2015-11-29,4200450,John,"The listing for the Ballard Backyard RV was very accurate. It was a little cold outside on our visit during Thanksgiving, but were very comfortable  in the RV. The treats and breakfast stuff was appreciated."
5632713,56386608,2015-12-13,41213704,Margy,"We had another excellent stay at Jeremy's RV, and appreciated all the thoughtful touches to make us comfortable, especially the breakfast foods, milk, and even Christmas decorations!  Thank you again."
606297,1944452,2012-08-10,3094684,Shayla,"Keith is a wonderful host! Stayed with my brothers and there girlfriends along with my boyfriend. Only thing I'd say is there were a few spiders ;) 
But, other than that... It is a nice, warm and welcoming home! Thank you again Keith! "
606297,2249005,2012-09-10,3116421,Eric,"Very spacious house. A great place to stay for a large party (we had nine). Keith was way cool. He allowed us check in early, gave us a lift to dinner and arranged for a party bus to take us all to an event on Friday night. I wouldn't hesitate to stay there again the next time I'm in the Seattle area with a large group. Thanks again Keith for a being such a gracious host!"
606297,2387577,2012-09-23,3611250,William,Keith is a very friendly owner I have ever met!!!
606297,2432664,2012-09-27,3630287,Megan,"Keith  was and excellent host!  The house was perfect for our group of 9 people, and we really appreciated Keith's hospitality.  He was great with communication and even allowed our group a later checkout time!  We'd stay again in a heartbeat! "
606297,2542383,2012-10-08,3569920,Jeremy,"Great, friendly service.  Offered up some discounted party bus fun.  Tons of space, very clean inside - would recommend. Thanks, Keith! "
606297,3754851,2013-03-11,5216409,Vicky,"I had the opportunity to stay at Keith and Cherie's earlier this month. The house definitely accommodated 10 people in the party. Besides the two parking spaces at the house there was also parking right across the street for all of my out of town guests. Keith was very kind, accommodating and helped us arrange party bus service for out night out!"
606297,3820796,2013-03-18,2546733,Retell,"Keith and Cherie were easy to deal with.  Seamless transaction, location was easy to get to and the hosts were super accommodating.  I would have no problems booking with them the next time we visit Seattle.  "
606297,4090603,2013-04-08,2318120,Dan,Keith met us at the house and was a great host - the rooms were fantastic for what we needed (there were six of us and a baby) and we had absolutely no problems at all.
606297,4168122,2013-04-15,5666753,Daniel,"Keith and Cherie were really helpful and welcoming. They provided everything stated on their profile and communicated very well from the beginning to the end of our visit. We appreciated their concern on our travel by always checking up on us to make sure we are doing well. The house was less then 5 minutes away from Downtown Seattle and right next to the freeway, which made it easy to navigate. I would recommend this place to anyone who is traveling to Seattle. Great hospitality!  "
606297,4364809,2013-04-30,5759832,Herman,"We (a group of 6) recently stayed at this house for the weekend. Keith was a very welcoming and helpful host. He was very helpful with providing suggestions of things to do, quickly answering any questions we had, and giving us rides to and from downtown Seattle. He was available 24/7, and really made our stay as comfortable as possible! If it weren't for him, we wouldn't have been able to attend a great comedy show, and an after party at the See Sound Lounge, all on Sunday night. The house was spacious, very clean and definitely catered to our needs. The location is also ideal - everything is a short trip away. For those thinking about staying in Seattle, consider this place highly recommended."
606297,4594087,2013-05-14,5349309,Winny,"We love our stay at Keith and Cherie's apartment! They are both very gracious and helpful hosts, their large apartment was perfect for our needs while we visited Seattle for a family wedding. Keith was quick to respond to any texts and would drop by to say 'hi' from time to time.When our flight was delayed, he graciously allowed us to stay past our checkout time. Their apartment was very well stocked, from large crockpots to board games and books for the little ones.  We highly recommend Keith and Cherie's apartment and will not hesitate to return the next time we are in Seattle!"
606297,5290977,2013-06-23,2961670,Sonia,Our group had an excellent time! Easy walking distance to grocery store and light rail station. Keith and Cherie were extremely welcoming and accommodating.
606297,5342106,2013-06-25,6047253,Michelle,"Seriously!  We literally could not have had a better place to stay than with Prez and Cherie.  Everything was so perfect for us.  The house was in the perfect location for us to get there from Portland and really convenient to get around town.  Stocked with everything we needed to cook and have a nice time. Clean and comfortable.
We rented the entire space out for a bachelorette extravaganza fiesta weekend!  We are all mostly in our 30's and work in the service industry.  Keith (Prez) was so quick to respond and very accommodating while I was in a frenzy trying to plan out all the logistics for our weekend.  We really had the best time possible.   
Day 1:Our first night there we planned on a nice dinner in Capitol Hill and then drinks in the hood.  I had called us a few cabs (there were 12 of us then with 2 more joining (email hidden)e cab companies were ridiculous and I spent a half hour on the phone, only to find out they had dispatched to the wrong neighborhood.  Prez's dad Ali was out front chatting with some of my friends.  He was on his way to pick up some people in  a Party bus and he let us hop a ride with to dinner for a small fee.  We had a great time at dinner and out drinking and then we decided to call Prez and see if the party bus could possibly take us home. They came right by on their way home and let us dance the whole way home. We stayed up for a bit at the house and we had invited Prez to come by if he wanted.  He showed up with lovely Cherie and we had a nice time chatting with them on the balcony.  
Day 2: We were all pretty tired and hungry and as my friends were making breakfast Prez stopped by and offered to run to the store to get anything we needed.  He went and got us fixings for bloody mary's which i had completely forgotten to bring!  He saved the day!   We hung out all day at the house and felt very comfy and welcome.  
Day 3: we were packing up and getting ready to leave.  It was extremely convenient to clean up, do all our dishes, and put our towels in the hamper.  Everyone was so happy with our weekend.  Prez stopped by and chatted and we all exchanged numbers and now we have a new friend who we hope will come visit us in Portland.  This was one of the best experiences vacationing I have ever had.  They were so friendly and accommodating and made us feel at home.  Anytime I'm back in Seattle I hope that I can stay with them.  I wish that all people could be like them!"
606297,5537839,2013-07-05,1649051,Sandy,"We had 3 generations staying at the home. Prez and Cherie were awesome hosts. They were so accommodating with our last minuted requests for transportation. I would highly recommend staying at any of their properties. When we got back from the baseball game they had a feast of BBQ chicken and ribs, macaroni salad and all the fixins waiting for us! Super friendly people!"
606297,5905382,2013-07-22,2546733,Retell,"This is our 2nd time staying at this house and it has always been a good experience. Prez and Cherie have done some upgrades to the place and its a lot better! The deck is nice, has a spacious backyard and 5 bedrooms to accommodate a large group of people.  Prez was so accommodating and he made sure we were ok by checking up on us at night.  We stayed here during the Bite of Seattle and hopefully we will be staying here again whenever we are in town.  "
606297,5988086,2013-07-25,5685620,Francis,"Good location!  Easy access to downtown Seattle and other neighborhoods!  The house has great community space for 10 adults to sit comfortably and hang out.  Thanks Prez & Cherie for being responsible, understanding and welcoming hosts!"
606297,6031261,2013-07-27,2012666,Elizabeth,We had a great stay in Seattle. Wish we could have stayed longer! Cherie was very helpful and the house was great for our large group.
606297,6104621,2013-07-30,6297978,Lori,"Location, location, location! This house is located very close to a light rail station which got us downtown for special events such as a Mariners game, the Space Needle, and the big concert we went to Seattle for in the first place. It only took us 2 or 3 stops to get us to where we wanted to go. I spoke with Cherie on the phone and she was so amiable. The house is basic by design and was perfect for our large group of 11. The kids were able to entertain themselves for hours with the Wii and with the poker table provided. All in all, if you want a great location, this is the place for you."
606297,6239284,2013-08-05,6475468,Dan,"We spent a long weekend in Seattle and rented the house for an informal college reunion with a group of 10.  We certainly enjoyed our stay and Prez and Cherie were gracious hosts.  Prez was out of town but was responsive via text anytime we needed to reach him.  Cherie showed us the place when we arrived and was very interested throughout our stay in how our time in Seattle was going.  It was nice to have that personal touch, and made us feel welcome.  Also, we accidentally got locked out at 2am on our last night and both Prez and Cherie responded to our text messages within a few minutes!

There was plenty of room in the house for all 10 of us (we had both the lower and upper units) and the number of bathrooms and kitchen space meant that we didn't have any conflicts about taking showers or finding space in the fridge for our adult beverages.  

The location is nice because it is short 10 minute drive from downtown, and the house is very close to the light rail station, which you can take directly downtown in 15 minutes or to the airport.  The Beacon Hill area is a pretty typical Seattle neighborhood--nothing swanky but perfectly nice.  Similarly, the house was clean and definitely met all of our needs, but was not swanky.  For our group it worked very well because it was a very economical option near downtown with plenty of space, and the fact that Prez and Cherie were so responsive and interested in making sure we had a good time was a nice perk.  

We had a great weekend with our college friends in Seattle, everyone in our group was pleased with the accommodations, and we would recommend it to anyone looking for a good value in a location but who does not need a nice (but not fancy) place.  Thanks Prez and Cherie!"
606297,6339216,2013-08-09,2025056,Clorinda,"We had such a great time in Seattle and a big part of it was because of Prez and Cherie, you won't find more better hosts then these two! We did a pub crawl with the party bus the first night we where there and Prez took us to the hottest spots to party in Seattle and boy did we have a blast! Best pub crawl ever! Prez was so much fun and fit into our group perfectly. The house was very clean and fit our needs, it was located close to the Train station so heading downtown was a sinch and very quick. Prez and Cherie always made sure we had everything we needed and they always answered all our questions quickly, communication was easy. When we head back to Seattle I would def stay in their home again! I highly recommend this house you won't be disapointed I promise. Thank you so much Prez and Cherie! "
606297,6611345,2013-08-19,6013620,Ireneo,"Prez and Cherie provided a nice experience in their home, and were very accommodating and personal in that they were always in contact and made sure everything was all good to go! We didn't get to meet in person since I was too busy with my brother's wedding nearby in SODO and was occupied by our visiting relatives, but it felt like I knew them already based on their hospitality and contacting through texting. House is pretty spacious upstairs and just right downstairs. Would definitely stay again if the need arises! Thanks Prez and Cherie!"
606297,7004850,2013-09-03,5468045,James,A great host. Would highly recommend 
606297,7693205,2013-09-30,7383571,Codi,"Prez and Cheri we kind enough to accommodate our huge group of 11 visiting from Los Angeles. We had an upstairs and downstairs unit. The place was so big it didn't even feel like there were that many of us staying there!  They house was fully stocked with everything we could need. On our first night there Prez stopped by to welcome us and offered our giant group a ride in his amazing party bus to Elysian Brewery. 

I would totally stay with them again, big or small group. "
606297,8078723,2013-10-15,890695,Tom,I booked this house as a place for my family to be together while in town for a wedding.  The house is spacious and for our purposes well situated.  We had several cars so getting to the grocery three very steep blocks away was easy.  Public transit is also down the steep hill.  Walking in the neighborhood is pleasant with a nearby golf course and park.  The house itself has seen many parties and is showing the signs of wear.  The kitchen is stocked with necessities though the table ware is in short supply for such a big house.  A guest information book would be helpful as I did not meet our hosts at all during the four days and there are unexplained locks on some of the interior doors that caused some unnecessary frustration.
606297,8524819,2013-11-04,674858,Kale,"A group of us came down from Canada for the weekend, and this house was easily big enough for all of us. The upstairs kitchen is nice and big, although doesn't really have seating but we managed just fine. And there is tons of fridge space, which is great with big groups. Prez & Cherie were always available via phone, and responded right away."
606297,8814245,2013-11-19,8946155,Tim,"Fantastic location for those wanting explore all of Seattle.  Light rail makes the trip from the airport a snap.  It is a short walk from both light rail stations to the house.  When wanting to go the city, it is only 20min or so on the light rail to get there.  We went to the market, the Seahawks game, the space needle, etc. all without a cab fare."
606297,9439193,2013-12-29,8649718,Bonnie,"We rented the house for a family reunion/Christmas vacation and were disappointed with the condition of the house. From the pictures and reviews we thought it would be a good option for all of us (9 adults and 3 kids), but the house was much more worn and deteriorating than is portrayed in the pictures.  While the rest of the house was cleaned up okay, the kitchen was not clean and everything had a layer of grease on it (dishes, cupboards, oven).  We had to wash everything before we used it. While Prez was gracious in his response to some of our requests/issues (fixing the sink handle that had broken off), I think the experience would have been more positive if it had been professionally cleaned. I think the house needs some serious work/upgrades to accurately reflect what is portrayed online."
606297,9890971,2014-01-17,133702,Danfung,"If you're a large group that needs a budget place to crash after a night of partying, this is the place for you. The hosts were warm and friendly. However, if you do not fall in that category, you would want to look elsewhere.  The condition of the house was very disappointing as it did not reflect the photos.  It is much older and run down than appears in the bright flash lit photos.  The basement has been converted into bedrooms, but it feels dark and dank. It has as much charm as an old motel. I've stayed a numerous AirBnBs over the years and this was the most disappointing. "
606297,10048503,2014-01-27,11241242,Jeff,"The place was extremely roomy and accommodating. We had a group of 9. Each couple had their own private bedroom and there were plenty of extra beds to spare. Clean sheets and bathrooms is all I really ask for and this place fit our budget nicely! Location is pretty close to downtown, just an uber ride away. The place could use some remodeling here and there but overall it was perfectly fine. "

606297,10547885,2014-02-24,11888648,Andrea,"Prez & Cherie were wonderful, easy going hosts.  They did not hesitate to help us work around our large group of 18, and were extremely accommodating in all our requests!  The house was cozy and in fair condition, with enough common areas to bring the group closer together.  We had a great time here :)"
606297,10856001,2014-03-10,3538887,Luis,Fue una pequeña estancia pero buena. Con todas las facilidades que se veían en las fotos anteriormente.
606297,10990452,2014-03-16,12625679,Ryan,"Our stay in Prez & Cherie's beautiful house couldn't have been better! 

First let me start off with how easy, quick and professional Prez was to deal with during the whole process of renting out his place. He was very straight forward about everything and there was no confusion whatsoever. He also accommodated our last minute reservation and even allowed our large group of 16 to stay on top of this.  

As far as the house goes…The place is amazing! My favorite feature of the home was how it was conveniently located a short, 6 minute drive from the heart of the city. So whether you're going to Pike Place, Fremont, C-link/Safeco, or wherever this wonderful city may take you.. it is just a hop, skip and a jump away! Besides the location, the condition of the house was immaculate and the property was very large (even with 16 people, there was a ton of space!). 

It's the little things that count, and i have to thank Prez for going above and beyond to make sure we had the best time possible. There were maps, locations of popular attractions in the city, restaurants for you or the family to visit…and if you didn't want to go out, there were numbers Prez had set out for 3 different places that would deliver food right to you. He made sure there were the extra beds available for our large group, there was food in the fridge, and the bedrooms, bathrooms and kitchens were in tip-top shape. 

A+ Customer Service & Hospitality!!!!


P.S. We had the luxury of using Prez's transportation service. Since we had a big group, we took the large party bus into the city! This was great for our group and everyone had an awesome time. I would look into this if you are considering booking the rental space, as there were plenty of options besides the party bus like a limo, town-car, or even a van if you needed it.


-We will definitely be staying here again next time we are out in Seattle, and i would recommend this home to anyone thinking about doing the same, you won't regret it!!!  


-Ryan"

606297,12332325,2014-04-29,12328842,Evelyn Araniva,La estancia fue buena. Con un supermercado cerca y la casa muy cómoda. 
606297,12848225,2014-05-12,7730471,Harpreet,"Had a great stay at this 5-bedroom house. We had a large party in town for a birthday and Cherie and Prez were very accommodating, sending restaurant recommendations and even offered complimentary party bus service! The place is in a residential area - 10 minute drive from downtown, and is a bit on the older side, but looks like the photos and was very clean and had everything we needed. The hosts were thorough and communication was very clear. Would definitely stay here again if we had a big group!"
606297,13953974,2014-06-09,13741187,Michael,Great place!  Didn't really chat too much with Prez or Cherie but they seemed nice for the little we did talk.  Would visit again!
606297,14148929,2014-06-13,580993,Adelia,"- appreciate that the host had been very helpful & accomodating.
- love the speed of the washer n dryer
removing the carpet may be a good idea"
606297,14872779,2014-06-28,16076761,Katherine,"Prez and Cherie were very welcoming hosts, and the place was large enough to accommodate our party as well as two dogs. Prez was also very flexible, and refunded us for the additional guest fee when some of our party couldn't make it at the last minute. "
606297,15386517,2014-07-08,7599424,Virginia,"

We rented Prez and Cherie's house for a group of 12 attending my sister's wedding. It was a great setup - we were able to comfortably accommodate 2 couples and one mother and baby in the 3 larger bedrooms (2 upstairs and one downstairs), and single guests stayed in the bunk beds and the downstairs rooms. It was nice to have several bathrooms and 2 kitchens so we could prep food for meals or picnics. 

We enjoyed hanging out on the deck or in the living room during downtime, and when we wanted privacy we could retreat to our room.  The location was great as all of our festivities took place in Beacon Hill or Mt. Baker neighborhoods. 

The hosts were good communicators and responsive when we had questions, even dropping off a package that came after I had checked out.


"
606297,15673149,2014-07-14,10458515,Fred,"Great experience. Prez and family are great hosts/Made us feel welcome.
There 14 of us - Grandparents, children, grandchildren - the house was laid
out as great place to bond. Centrally located, we we had access to all the local attractions, sleeping accommodations were great, parking was abundant to handle 4 cars. This house is not brand new but if you are a large family, a large bunch of college kids or similar I cannot think of a better place to stay. This was a family reunion, in 10 years we will be back!!
"
606297,16619296,2014-07-30,17156954,Christine,"Our hosts Prez & Cherie were very welcoming and friendly as was our communication via email and airbnb. Their home was perfect fit for our family vacay with our big group of 13. :) The home itself is a little on the older side from what we expected in the photos, but everything works well and we had everything we needed--from full kitchen to laundry machines. We came in the summer so there were plenty of fans and windows that kept it relatively cool. We heard in the Winter it gets pretty chilly at night, so the heater is available around the home. It was really convenient distance to downtown Seattle - Pike's Market, Space Needle, Gum Wall, etc. We really were fascinated and impressed by the unique LED lights around the house (front door, door knobs, kitchen water faucet, etc.) and the programmable, digital door knobs. Loved the private spacious parking in front of the home to fit our 2 minivans and having two entrance doors both downstairs and upstairs."
606297,17038764,2014-08-06,10737931,Carol,"Our group of 5 women ranging from 40- to 60-something had a great weekend at Prez’ place.  I read the last 2 reviews, especially the very negative one.  We must have stayed at a different house & neighborhood because our experience was totally different. The house is older, so the furniture is not top of the line & the floors are scuffed, but everything was clean, not at all dingy & very serviceable. The patio was great & sturdy enough for 5 of us to sit up there every morning & evening. We never felt in danger from the structure. The blinds in the master bedroom have been replaced & are just fine. The kitchen is stocked with every cooking utensil you would need. There are cleaning utensils underneath the sink & in the room off the kitchen where the washer & dryer are stored.  The bathrooms are clean & signs are clearly posted where to put the dirty towels. There were numerous small bottles of shampoo under the sink in the master bedroom. The beds are comfortable.  The downstairs is a converted basement but nicely so.  It is 5 – 7 degrees cooler than the upper unit – a nice trade-off when the weather got hot during our stay.  There is no A/C, but plenty of fans, so sleeping was no problem.

The neighborhood is middle-class.  It was VERY quiet.  The house is located about 1 ½ - 2 miles from a major hospital in a major city, so hearing sirens would be understandable.  But we heard none.  I woke up at 2am one morning and it was dead quiet (the window was open).  No people went in & out because of the party bus. Use of the party bus is great.  Rates for the 2 times we used it (airport pick-up & a ride downtown) were extremely reasonable.  

Here are the negatives:  1) The master bathroom is small.  The door to the bathroom doesn’t open all the way.  The toilet blocks it.  So you have to open it ¾, go in and close the door to reach the shower.  2) At times, Prez did not respond to a text for several hours, but he did check in with us twice during our stay and prepared the fire pit for our use.  Unfortunately, we didn’t have any matches and there were none anywhere in the house, so be sure to bring some if you want to use the fire pit.  3) The stairs leading to the lower unit are steep and don’t have a banister, though you can hold on to the wall.  Not recommended for older people who are not steady on their feet.  However, there is easier access if they simply go outside and walk around.  None of these negatives was a deal-killer.  We had a good time, the house was a great value and we’d stay there again.
"
606297,17616235,2014-08-15,15680264,Lynn,"We had a great time at this rental. The ad was correct. It was easy to find and a ten minute walk to the train station. The carpets were very clean which we liked. A few of the beds were either too hard or too soft and we would bring our own pillows next time.

It was nice to have a functioning kitchen as we were traveling with two babies. ThEre was eight of us and we had plenty of room."
606297,17822999,2014-08-18,15276964,Grandin,"Prez & Ali were exceptional hosts. I cannot possibly emphasize how wonderful they were throughout our stay. If you are considering booking this house, stop now- just book it. Prez will ensure you will NOT be disappointed.

I booked this house for a bachelor party with 15 guys, and Prez made sure we were looked after the entire time. Without their help, I am doubtful the party would have gone half as well as it did. From transportation to recommendations about what to do, they were extremely helpful. The house is well stocked with everything you might need, and there are ample beds, couches, and even air mattresses if you are concerned about the capacity of this house.

The house is close to downtown and has a strip mall within walking distance so you can be sure that anything you need is nearby. As well, Prez owns and operates a transportation company so this is the airBNB equivalent of one stop shopping. This is the future of airBNB...fully integrated services, from accommodation to transportation."
606297,18109410,2014-08-22,500918,Elizabeth,"I recently visited with a group of underprivileged teenagers to visit colleges in Seattle. Prez was impressed with our mission and gave our group a really good deal so that we could afford to stay in the house. He was attentive during our stay and even came over one night to fix the DVD player. Overall the house is comfortable, the kitchen is well-stocked and has spices, condiments, and a few staples, and it was an easy walk to the light rail. "
606297,18409225,2014-08-26,5707425,Lan,"My friends and I were lucky enough to rent this home for our trip to Seattle. It was easy to find, conveniently located and offered up plenty of space for all of us. Prez was a gracious host and helped make this trip fun and easy. 
"
606297,18597016,2014-08-28,3548774,Fan,Prez & Cherie were very prompt with communication and made sure we were able to get help when needed. The check in process was easy and convenient as they had keyless entry and we had the whole house. The detailed instructions on their posting made everything easy to find and get. The rooms by the street can get a bit noisy at night as it is not inner streets. Overall good stay.
606297,19117377,2014-09-07,14157463,Greg,"Host, not responsive to text's asking for early check-in, claimed phone problems. Not likely.  The photos on the Airbnb site depict this home beautifully however, not so beautiful in person.  Be careful with expectations.  This house has seen better days, e.g. drawers in kitchen with no bottoms, no hand railing going down some fairly steep stairs to the bottom level, no indoor table that seats more the 5 people, digital door looks did not work on arrival had to get a universal code from the host.  This host apparently also owns a transportation busiu grass and parking area of the house.  Cleaning of these vehicles will occur during your stay so don't be surprised, as we were.  The good thing is the house is centrally located with easy access to grocery, gas etc. as well as downtown seattle, westside and other common destinations"
606297,19430893,2014-09-12,20587446,Taylor,"They were nice, flexible, and the place was clean. Would suggest it to anyone with a large group. "
606297,20760996,2014-10-05,20910394,David,"location was good, easy access on and off freeways, not far from grocery and a couple of cute restaurants.  I have to agree with Greg on some things- kitchen not particularly clean ( I had to clean up a spill and the rag was black when I was finished, not from our water spill), there are only a few eating utensils, the dishes felt greasy so we rewashed them.  I think it would be great to put in a dishwasher so all dishes could be equally clean.  Though there is a refrigerator for guests, the door was full of condiments of who knows what age.  I think it would be helpful to have the cleaning crew make new ice trays each time, some were so old there was barely a cube in the container.  I agree the access to the basement needs a rail, it is steep and circular.  While we were told the access to the house would be the last digits of the phone, it did not turn out to be so.  Luckily someone was there and could recode it for what we thought the code was, then it worked fine.  Parking not easy for more than one or two cars and when we left on sunday the Party Bus was so close to our car, access had to be across the passenger seat.   We did enjoy the limo ride to and from our destination- prompt service and nice to have."
606297,20976394,2014-10-08,2675134,Tommy,Great time at Prez's place.  Great host and good vibes there.  
606297,21156422,2014-10-12,21526260,David,The house was great! The hosts were very accomodating and even let us check in early because no one was staying there the night before. Towels were provided for us so it was very convenient. We occupied the whole house so we were able to hang out without worrying about noise. There was plenty of space for lounging and the hosts made our stay very enjoyable. The neighborhood felt a little sketchy but location was easy to get around from. We rented one car and the hosts gave us one of their parking spots to park. We also used uber to get around to the city which isn't too bad.
606297,21519461,2014-10-19,7580769,Leslie,"This place was perfect for our needs.  We were a group of 13 people attending a friend's wedding, and this house had enough space for everybody.  It also had some nice central hang-out spaces so that we could all sit around and play games.  It is also not far from the light rail and a supermarket, which was nice.  Prez and his father were there to show us how things worked, and, leading up to it, Prez and Cherie were very responsive.  Overall, this booking was very successful, and I would recommend it."
606297,21883697,2014-10-26,5152671,Dave,"Prez and Cheri's place was very nice, and was exactly as described / pictured.  The house is nice and spacious, and is well-suited for a large group visiting Seattle.  It is a bit further south, and so not in the heart of the action, but a really great home base, and everything of interest is easily accessible.

Prez and Cheri were very communicative, and were easy to get ahold of.  They responded to my inquiry about booking the place within hours, and responded very quickly while my group was at the listing when we had questions.  Check-in was seamless, and the apartment was very clean.

Prez and Cheri have a lot of rules about staying in their place, which are visible on the listing's description.  I think they are all reasonable rules and totally understand why they would be laid out up front as they are - in fact, its definitely better for the guest and host to have clear expectations of each other before booking.  However, some of the penalties (e.g., for broken glassware or moved furniture) seemed a bit harsh, and made it a bit difficult for us to really relax and feel comfortable in the listing.

One last thing worth noting is that the 'registration' required of all guests before staying at the listing seemed a bit overreaching - for example, at the time of our stay guests were required to provide information such as home address and pictures of themselves.  There are somewhat reasonable motivations for asking for this information, but it seems like it could be achieved in a less intrusive way that has less friction by just asking for everyone's Airbnb profile or something.

Overall, I'd recommend Prez and Cheri's - especially if you have a big group.  We had a great time while staying there, and would recommend it to any friends traveling to Seattle in the future."
606297,22227395,2014-11-02,4227041,Jensen,Great place and fantastic hosts. Thanks for being super accommodating and friendly!
606297,22863537,2014-11-16,19634537,Kaydee,"This place was AWESOME. They were such friendly and welcoming hosts and made themselves available for all of our needs. The house had everything we needed and was perfect for our large group. This place could easily accommodate a large family or group of people. The location was awesome, clean neighborhood with stores right down the street. I would highly recommend this house for any group heading to Seattle. Easy access to freeways (I-5 and I-90) and downtown. They even have sufficient parking for a large group, which can be hard to do in Seattle! We are already looking forward to our next retreat :-)"
606297,25181375,2015-01-08,14584786,Skye,Prez and Cherie were great hosts. Great communication and super easy check in!

606297,26603483,2015-02-16,7845706,Liz,"Prez and Cherie's house was perfect in accommodating our large group of 11 people. We had a nice welcome on our first night when Prez popped in to say hello and an even nicer bon voyage as they threw us a little going away party. Prez was easy to get a hold of, helped answer our questions, and made our stay very pleasant and worry free!"
606297,27921992,2015-03-15,26066217,Sue,"Great stay! Great choice for large group who want access to downtown. House was very clean and towels/bedding/kitchen were all well supplied. Layout and kitchen worked well for our group of 12. Mattresses were in nice shape too. Nice neighborhood, house on quiet dead end street, close to shops and easy to get anywhere. Plenty of street parking. Also rented a bus which was super fun and a great price. Can’t say enough nice things about Prez – he was kind, generous, and very laid back. Will definitely rent from him again for Seattle gathering. Thanks Prez and Cherie!"
606297,28298824,2015-03-22,13483960,(email hidden),"Prez was great with communication and allowed us to check in early, and was there to greet us upon arrival. The check in process was easy and convenient as they had keyless entry and we had the whole house. The detailed instructions on their posting made all expectations straight forward. The house was big enough to accommodate our large group and at an affordable price. It was located near the highway for short travel to/from airport, and also close to downtown. Off street parking available. Prez also gave us a comfortable and enjoyable ride to/from our wedding venue via his transportation service. 

Some things to note: the apartment basement was a bit musty and carpet damp, probably due to the rainy weather. I was concerned with some wear/stains on carpet and in kitchen as far as it impacting our security deposit but that wasn't a problem. I also wasn't 100% comfortable with the registration of all guests via their website; I felt like one person would be enough."
606297,28575158,2015-03-26,24171008,Jialong,Large and clean house. Near downtown and pretty convenient.

En ce qui concerne la maison, elle était propre et très spacieuse, nous étions 8 personnes à y habiter, avec de nombreuses chambres et salles de bains... Je recommande à toutes les personnes cherchant à se loger à Seattle, la maison de Prez, qui est parfaitement située. Et en plus de ça son accueil a vraiment été formidable et apprécié de toute mon équipe. ENCORE MERCI, grâce à eux j'ai vraiment envie de revenir dans cette belle région des US. "
606297,31013426,2015-04-30,23165536,Francesca,"I booked this reservation on behalf of some Australian friends of mine who were going camping on the Olympic Peninsula. They had never been to Seattle and wanted to see the city before they explored the wilderness... so I put them up at Prez & Cherie's.

Prez & Cherie's Airbnb is in such a great location, just as promised. Everything was incredibly comfortable and convenient. What was especially nice was P&C's willingness to accommodate a one-night stay. They guys had a great time and enjoyed their hospitality. :)"
606297,31761589,2015-05-10,10087705,Kris,Prez was VERY reachable and went to great lengths to make sure that we were satisfied during our trip. The listing looked exactly like it was shown online and the neighborhood it was in was very nice!
606297,34281097,2015-06-07,402767,Lianne,"First the positive:
We only dealt with Prez during our stay and he was very nice. There was a case of water with our check in and what seemed to be a ""pay it forward"" pantry stocked with some basic essentials from previous guests such as pancake mix, syrup, butter etc. There were plenty of plates and utensils in the kitchen. Prez also runs a transportation company, so it was wonderful to be able to hire him from pier to door service for our cruise. The house was overall clean and comfortable. They also let us do an early check in which was great because we had a LOT of luggage, very laid back host.
Neutrals:
It didn't bother me, but the house is on a semi busy street and some folks in my party aren't used to street noise so they were unable to sleep. And while Cheri & Prez require guests to clean up after themselves, a few previous guests hid the fact that they didn't do the best job of cleaning pots, so just be sensible about giving things a rinse. To note, I don't hold the hosts AT ALL responsible for the last 2, just a word for future guests.
Critique:
The house needs a number of small repairs. Holes in window screens, a cracked toilet seat, things like that. Nothing to seriously affect the enjoyment of the stay, or that we felt the need to have fixed right away, especially since we were only there for 2 nights. I should note that Prez was clearly making some repairs so these may just be things that he hadn't gotten around to yet.
**It is important to note that any issues we had were relatively minor. Having a place close to the light rail that was affordable and accommodated our large group was the main goal and this place fit the bill. I want to thank Prez & Cheri for hosting us!**"
606297,35202645,2015-06-16,23461261,Faith,"Thank you

606297,36191498,2015-06-26,14007745,Jodi,"The house is in a very convenient neighborhood, central and quiet. It is is good condition.  Prez met our group at the door, walked us through and showed us how everything worked. The home had good WiFi, an excellent covered deck, and plenty of extra linens and towels.

Communication with the hosts was mixed. There were times when they got back to us immediately, and other times when our texts were not returned.  The house can easily sleep 7 or 8, and the condo 1 or 2. More than that is pretty tight."
606297,36361752,2015-06-28,14563338,Andrew,"We had a group of 10 stay at this house over a weekend.  From the beginning, it was easy to get in touch with Prez.  There was no guess work as everything was laid out in detail.  The whole stay, Prez was a available at all times to answer any questions or concerns.  He just made it easy.  The house was plenty spacious for our group, and never did anyone feel crowded.  It was an overall great stay!  We would definitely look Prez up for another stay!"
606297,36712093,2015-06-30,13601360,Dan,"We had a great, relaxing stay. Prez had ample space for our party of 8, all the amenities you could need, and a great space to hang out and chill. We would definitely stay again when next in Seattle. "

606297,41916676,2015-08-10,22730385,Julie,Our stay in Seattle was wonderful.  Prez and Cherie were very helpful and accommodating.  Plenty of room for all 9 of us.  We enjoyed having dinner outdoors on the warm summer evening.  We cooked dinner both evenings and the kitchen was well supplied.  It was easy and convenient to walk to the Light Rail.  Thank you for giving us the hint about taking the Beacon Hill station.
606297,43210251,2015-08-18,3740772,Catherine,"Prez and Cherie could not have been better hosts. They were easy to work with and very accommodating. The apartment was convenient for our wedding venues but might not be as close to Seattle tourist spots. However, the house is darker and older than the photos suggest. Its set up is suitable for younger adults such as college kids but might not be appropriate for families and older adults. Renters should also know that, besides listing the names of each guest, a detailed registration form is required from every guest."
606297,44529786,2015-08-27,6050905,Rieko,"Prez was really accommodating and very responsive for our needs.
We had a wonderful stay. "
606297,45056280,2015-08-31,5957884,Judy,"Prez was very responsive to our requests for changes and assistance with using the facility.  The location is close to Seattle downtown which made visiting sites easy.

We were expecting the property to be more upgraded. The carpeting was stained, in our opinion not clean, and the wood floor in another room in disrepair.  Prez said the carpets are regularly professionally cleaned. There were some other minor Improvements that Prez was willing to take under advisement. Prez indicated to us that they didn't represent the house as five star. The price reflects the quality of the home. If it was more upgraded, it would have cost more.

606297,45661654,2015-09-05,16859984,Julie,"Prez met us at the house when we arrived, we had an early flight and since we were hours earlier than our check in time Prez & Cherie made it possible for us to drop by and leave our luggage which was quite extensive, as we had 11 in our party.  The house was great and so conveniently located to everything we needed.  The spacious upstairs kitchen was perfect for a group our size and included everything we needed.  We couldn't have asked for a better home to share for our pre-cruise visit to Seattle.  Thank you for your hospitality, Prez & Cherie!
~ Julie, Jeff, Melinda, Rick, Karen, Pat, Tricia, Ken, Scott, Pam & Bill
ps - highly recommend Prez & Cherie and this property!"
606297,50457810,2015-10-12,12302426,Zhengtao,"Prez houses good location, right next to the city center. Drive to the Space Needle need only 15 minutes. It is not big. It has five rooms, two downstairs, three upstairs. Perhaps it is because the house is too old, it does not quiet. If any one to use the bathroom, then all the people will hear the sound of water."
606297,51278992,2015-10-19,36485167,Jacob,"Had a great experience. The house was in a good location, it was a quick Uber to the stadiums or downtown. There was plenty of room and sleeping space for our large group. We felt the price was very fair for the home. Prez was very responsive and friendly throughout the whole process. I would highly recommend this home for a Seattle stay."
606297,56331192,2015-12-12,35570624,Remy,"Prez and Cherie were great hosts. The house was perfect for a large group of our size (12). There were plenty of comfortable places to sleep and house was very spacious and well kept. It's 1o minute location from downtown Seattle and Capital Hill was prime. Cherie and Prez were great communicators and made sure we had everything we would need to make our stay the best, as well as providing us with any information they could and answered any questions we had. We had a great evening there and would recommend their services to anyone looking for a great weekend in Seattle."
606297,57418339,2015-12-25,14453711,Aubry,Prez and Cherie helped our family out last minute due to snow and not being able to get over the pass for Christmas. They had the place ready for us within a few hours and let us check out a little later than normal because they were so accommodating. I would recommend to anyone that needed a big place in the area. 
4311244,40772787,2015-08-02,25344512,Martin,"This is a great apartment in the heart of downtown. The views over the city are fab (though you don't see the water). It's perfectly fitted out, has good air con and is v spacious. The gym, pool and communal outdoor space on floor 8 are also great. Getting in was easy with v clear instructions, a helpful concierge and private parking that has lift access direct to the apartment. For an experience of urban life in Seattle it's perfect. "
8326413,48353551,2015-09-25,1194219,Line,"We had a great time staying at Leah's place! The room was nice and the sleeping couch was surprisingly comfy. We had our one entrance to the room which suited us perfectly. 
Everything was very clean and organized and the train to the city center was just two blocks away. 
We recommend any future Seattle guest  to stay at Leah's place.   "
8326413,48619329,2015-09-27,5414926,Marie,"Leah was a wonderful host; very informative and kind and helpful. Her place is lovely; very close to public transportation, restaurants and exactly as described in the ad. I would highly recommend Leah to anyone who is visiting Seattle! "

8326413,51317881,2015-10-19,44122706,Courtney Marie,I had an amazing time staying at Leah's home. Everything was perfect :) They answered all my questions since it was my first time in Seattle. The room was the perfect size for me. A very warm welcoming feeling. I would definitely recommend staying here. Thank you for everything!
8326413,52543769,2015-10-30,46662763,John,Leah was very gracious and the room was outstanding! Very convenient to light rail and nice restaurants.
8326413,54074084,2015-11-15,48714424,Seth,"Host was incredibly nice, house was totally clean and orderly. Room was spacious and private with it's own entrance. Highly recommend this listing to anyone trying to visit Columbia City/Seattle."
8326413,56230071,2015-12-10,6928160,Amanda,The stay with Leah and Ryan was wonderful! They were very accommodating to my check in and out times and were very hospitable. The bed and room were very comfy! 
8326413,56775937,2015-12-18,6116108,Marieke,"We've had a good time at Leahs. The directions are good and the house is easy to find. ITS close to the lightrail that Will bring you to downtown Seattle in 15 min. 
The room is good, with your own entrance and a private bathroom up the first flight of stairs. 
Leah was Great and kind. We can recommend this place to everybody!"
8326413,56997090,2015-12-20,20897214,Marilyn,"After a long drive in the dark from Canada, I was warmly greeted at the door by Leah, Ryan & Max (their gorgeous cat). They were very welcoming and generous. The bed was very comfortable and there were extra blankets available to counter the winter cold. I enjoyed playing CDs on the Bose Surround Sound system in the bedroom. The bathroom was upstairs, but private and had a luxurious jacuzzi tub which I had the pleasure of soaking in. All the supplies were top quality, such as special soaps, shampoos, etc. Even the toilet paper was soft and thick. The house was a nicely decorated heritage home in a great location. I will likely be returning in the months ahead on future visits. It would have been very comfortable for 2 people."

They offered toiletries and towels, invited us to join them at the Freemont Market one weekend and even made an incredible Cinco de Mayo spread while we were there. Almost wish we needed to stay longer! Easy to get around from the house. I was able to walk to the buses that go downtown and the area is nice and safe too. Cute little dog lives there too! Thanks so much for the introduction to Seattle:))"
6106498,32135987,2015-05-14,24500460,Page,"Staying with Yedida and Vince was perfect! They are fun and interesting people with great travel stories, and their house is cute and very comfortable. They were super accommodating when it came to our check-in and check-out times, and they offered us room in the fridge and a place to store our bike rack while we were traveling. Towels and toiletries were also laid out for us when we arrived. They gave us great tips for exploring their neighborhood. And they have the friendliest little dog too! Their place is the perfect place to stay for exploring Seattle!"
6106498,32645349,2015-05-19,24321176,Chris,"This was our first AirBNB experience, and we stayed for two nights. We were happy to find it to be a nice, clean house, and the neighborhood is fantastic, too! Dida, Vince, and Kevin were friendly and accommodating. The bedroom was comfortable and private. Also...listen up tall people like me...the shower head was nice and high!

We would definitely return!"
6106498,32794228,2015-05-21,28948062,Melanie,"AHHH!!! We can't speak more highly of Dida and her beautiful home.  She was super welcoming, personable, easy-going, and we felt comfortable from the moment we stepped onto the property. This is sort of cheesy, but she really makes you feel like you're staying at your best friend's house for a night. Not to mention, if you're a dog lover like I am, you will fall in love with her little Chihuahua mix, Jacamo. The deck is so cute and peaceful, even though we didn't have much time to hang out, and her husband was lovely to meet as well.  Overall, a really wonderful stay. 

Thank you so much for your kindness and hospitality! 

- Clinton and Melanie "
6106498,32854651,2015-05-22,1171851,Regan,"Yedida and Vince were awesome. Super chill and accommodating! We basically just wanted to sleep in a real bed and take a real shower before heading out on a camping trip. We got just that plus warm, welcoming vibes and good conversation. Wish we had been  staying longer to enjoy their lovely home and hospitality more! I'll be looking them up on my next trip to Seattle, for sure!"
6106498,34813930,2015-06-12,25243609,Caroline,Staying with Yedida and Vince was super relaxed and easy. Everyone was welcoming and laid back and accommodating considering our unexpected late arrival. The dog is lovely as well.
6106498,35311826,2015-06-17,31759986,Alex,"It's home, sweet home indeed! I was met like an old friend! Dida was very friendly, attentive, helpful, and open to talk. The house is beautiful and comfortable. The small dog, Giacomo, is very funny and always ready to play with you, but he won't disturb you in any way, if you are busy.
Overall experience is so great, that I fell sorry that I did not stay there for a few days more."
6106498,35424400,2015-06-18,3801286,Rosa,"Dida was a great host. Very prompt in responding and very friendly. I enjoyed my one night stay in their cozy and clean room. I was wishing I could spend more time with Dida and her family and hear about their adventures. I highly recommend staying with Dida, Vincent and Giacomo :)"

6106498,35944131,2015-06-23,34017921,George,"Staying here with Dida, Vince, and Kevin was awesome.  They are the friendliest, most interesting people.  I read that talking to Dida is like talking to your best friend, which I thought was an exaggeration but it's definitely not.  Dida has this magic power to bring everyone together and make them comfortable and happy.  Talking to her is how talking to your family should be!  Their house has a great vibe, and Giacomo is incredibly well-behaved and unassuming.  I hope anyone looking for a place to stay chooses Dida's because they will look back on it with fond memories!"
6106498,36877924,2015-07-02,15760537,Rachel,"Amazing stay! Yadida, her husband Vince and their roommate were incredibly welcoming and helpful! It was a little hotter than usual and they did whatever they could to help cool the rooms down. The neighborhood is amazing. Next time I am in Seattle I will for sure be staying with them again! "
6106498,40902696,2015-08-03,46744,Andrea,"Home sweet home-away-from home was the place I stayed for about a month while looking to relocate to Seattle. Their home was nestled in Ballard close to many cafes, restaurants and bars. The home was spacious, cozy, neat and clean. Even though, I never had the chance to  meet Yedida and Vincent (vacationing) they left explicit instructions, so I felt very comfortable maneuvering around their home.  Their roommate Kevin, was a superb host. He made me feel very comfortable and I appreciated his knowledge and recommendations about the area.  It was a pleasure to stay in this lovely home and I would highly recommend it to anyone planning a stay in Seattle. "
6106498,42844471,2015-08-16,34301876,Morten,Basic accommodation. Flexible. Very good value for Money.
6106498,44314859,2015-08-25,38133388,Henrik,"I never actually got to meet Dida or Vince because they were out of town when I stayed there, yet they managed to make me feel welcome to their house through our online contact. I did meet Kevin and Giacomo who were both very friendly and nice.
Their home was just like the description says, bright and spacious in a nice neighborhood and lots of amenities within walking distance.

It’s definitely a place I would recommend anyone to stay at if you’re going to Seattle.

Giaccomo is the sweetest little dog and we wish we could have stayed longer! These hosts will make you feel right at home."
6106498,46579071,2015-09-12,32692913,Stephen,"Dida was warm and friendly from the moment we met. She was quick to provide local food suggestions and some tourist attractions in the beautiful town of Ballard. The house and neighborhood are totally cool too! Sunme and I loved our time in Seattle and that was largely due to Dida, Vince and Kevin. Thanks!"
6106498,46847421,2015-09-13,27241692,Kevin & Beverly,Yedida and her husband were lovely and gracious.  They and their home were warm and welcoming - clean and inviting with great art on the walls.
6106498,48174223,2015-09-24,30422340,Noël,"Yedida and Vincent were great hosts! An extremely friendly and open-minded young couple with good recommendations in terms of restaurants, bars, shops, etc. Their dog Giacomo and the house were lovely. Ballard is a very young and hip neighbourhood - perfect for young people and at the same time very close to the beach. Only 30min by bus to Seattle Downtown."
6106498,48767435,2015-09-28,37453768,Yuki,"Dida and her husband are cheerful and helpful for visitor. We could enjoy to go to neibor farmers market, and use bus smoothly.
Their house is also clean and nice taste.  It takes 30min to go Downtown, but it's not so much far.

We could have great experience thanks of them!"
6106498,50129286,2015-10-09,532926,Ariane,"My friend and I weren't sure what time we'd arrive and Yedida made it super easy for us to let ourselves in. Her instructions were crystal clear, down to the smooches we might get from her two dogs. We stayed only one night so didn't get to socialise much with out host, but she is lovely and very welcoming.

The house is located in a nice residential neighbourhood with a few restaurants within walking distance. We were able to get downtown with one direct bus. Very handy.

6106498,50437026,2015-10-12,28879502,Francisca,"Dida and Vince were great hosts! They were very friendly, accommodating, and welcoming. Their house is located about 10 minutes promenade from all the restaurants, cafes, and bars in Ballard. The room was clean and spacious, just as described. Their home was definitely ‘home-away-from–home” and I would highly recommend for anyone to stay with Dida and her family! "
7724630,48638213,2015-09-27,44293159,Courtney,This spot was a good suburban location for staying in Seattle. Quiet neighborhood with lots of parking only a 15 minute drive to the downtown. The room was a good size to share and the private balcony was a plus! We never met Sarah during our stay but she was very responsive when I messaged her. Her other roommate Kim was very nice and welcoming. Would definitely recommend this groovy artist studio to anyone who wants a relaxing stay in Seattle!
8717068,54767718,2015-11-23,26558292,Liz,"Maya and Henry have been gracious hosts since the beginning of our communication with them. They are fun and easy going and make the process of staying seamless. We couldn't have asked for a better set-up and they have been accommodating  to our needs above and beyond expectations. We will be staying quite a bit more in future. The Wedgewood community where the house is located is walkable and family-friendly. We regularly strolled the local streets and the house is walking distance from stores, coffee shops, cafes and a wide variety of beautiful green spaces. With an easy commute to downtown Seattle, the Tiny House is not to be missed! We want to have our own Tiny House some day so the stay has allowed us to explore the Tiny life before making commitments toward our own home. With all the luxuries needed for a cozy stay (including the easy and low-maintenance composting toilet) we highly recommend this place to any and all!

2710274,11630676,2014-04-09,6439972,Adam,"Sheryl's house is located a short walk from the main drag of Wallingford. I was able to easily walk to my work right near gasworks park in the morning. The place is a work in progress and has a cool feel to it. Although I was quite busy, Sheryl was nice to talk to when I had the chance."
2710274,13040000,2014-05-18,13907883,Carol,"The cottage is in one of the best neighborhoods in Seattle.  Very accessible from freeways or by bus.  She is a very interesting woman and a true Seattleite.  She is an intelligent and friendly person who has worked in conservation.  This is typical of Seattle (very similar to Berkeley where I have also lived.)  Meeting her is one way to learn what Seattle is actually like.  Extremely helpful and knows the area well.  If you like night life an active music scene is within 4 walking blocks of the house. If not the house is secluded enough that you won't know it.  She let us use the laundry facilities and has a special fridge just for guests.  
The house is a work in process. As it is less expensive than comparable properties if you are flexible it is fine.  It is clean and the rooms are small but cozy.  My boyfriend and I were quite comfortable in the South room which has views of the city.  Sheryl is very chatty if you want to engage her in conversation but also can give you space if needed.  
Meeting Sheryl was priceless.  The room fit our budget and was really a pleasure to stay in.  
Thank you Sheryl.  Keep in touch.  "
2710274,13256906,2014-05-23,11212738,David,"Sheryl is an excellent host, very accommodating and fun to be around. The house is, as advertised, a work in progress (e.g., you can see some unpainted plywood). It's cozy, comfortable, and a little quirky, in an updated early-1900's sort of way. The neighborhood, Wallingford, is charming and pretty, but down-to-earth. You feel like you've gone back it time a little."
2710274,13795548,2014-06-04,15092559,Linsen,"My stay at Sheryl's cottage was wonderful. As being said in the description, her cottage is in a long term renovation project carefully done by Sheryl herself, yet the ongoing project did not bother me at all, given I spent some time reading in my room and the living room. My bedroom, the shared bathroom and living room are extremely clean and tidy.  Plus I could see Mt. Rainier on a clear day from my window (from the south room)! 

Sheryl is a wonderful host and makes me feel at home. I checked-in late at 1 am due to a flight delay, yet Sheryl was willing to wait for me to arrive. She is very knowledgeable about where to visit in Seattle and love to share with me interesting stories about her house project. My trip was definitely not complete, if not for her. I feel lucky for having Sheryl as my host."
2710274,13937703,2014-06-08,6005176,Jeremy,"The house was pretty much as I expected, based on reviews by others. It is in a charming neighborhood of arts and crafts bungalows and 'cottages'. Charming residential quality to the area, lots of trees and flowering plants, and a mini traffic circle at each intersection for super effective traffic calming. The house itself is a work in progress, but peaceful and comfortable. Sheryl is a great host."
2710274,13994955,2014-06-09,3094117,Lisa,"In my opinion, this house is neither suitable nor safe for paying visitors. My 70 year old mother and I stayed for about under an hour then left. The house does look cozy and charming from the photo. In person, however, is a different story. Walking to the house, I couldn't believe my eyes -- it looked a bit like a scrap yard (likely due to the renos that are supposedly taking place). There are two key Seattle residential building code violations that suggest a danger to any visitor's safety: 1) A large open French door in the living room with no landing outside. This is unsafe for a child, senior, or someone who forgets the warning to ""not step beyond the door."" There is no posted sign, just a verbal warning from Sheryl (Violation of Code R312). 2) There is no full hand rail going up the winding staircase to the 2nd floor. For anyone slightly unstable or needing support, this makes going downstairs a big difficulty and unsafe (Violation of Code R311.7.8).

Also, when my mother and I first arrived, we laid down to rest our feet for about 15 mins. During that time, the bed shook several times for unknown reasons (planes overhead? cars outside? No idea why). It made laying down quite uncomfortable, and added to the realization that this place was both impossible and unsafe to sleep in.

Although it is indicated that the house is undergoing changes, I doubt that there is any serious work happening with a deadline in mind. The guest bedroom was meager, with neither the door nor windows finished. Some small things you can deal with - they're not the end of the world. But putting together an unsafe building (what other danger did we not see?), and make-shift/unfinished nature of the room, and the condition of the front yard, we pulled out. 

I left a message for Sheryl on Airbnb about an hour after leaving and finding a new accommodation at the Moore Hotel downtown (which I recommend), which is copied verbatim below, but I never received a response (see msg below). 

After years of travelling around the world by back-back, train, bus, plane in Europe, North America and South America, this has been the worst place I have ever stayed in (disappointment, surprise, stress).

***************
Hi Sheryl, 

Please note that we left your place with the keys on the table. You are very friendly, but we find the house not suitable to stay in, especially with no railings going upstairs. We were concerned about my mothers safety. In addition the fact that the bed shakes very frequently (planes?) made it impossible for us to stay . Best regards, 

Lisa

2710274,14104038,2014-06-11,16357411,Ethan,"Sheryl was a wonderful host, and spending my first two nights in Seattle at her place made for a great introduction to the area. My girlfriend and I mostly kept to ourselves when we weren't at work, and thus appreciated the privacy of our room upstairs. The bed was super comfortable, and the room was very clean. When we were downstairs, Sheryl was great fun to talk with and she made sure we felt at home. Thank you!"
2710274,14752107,2014-06-25,13114145,Beth And Oliver,"We had a fantastic stay - Sheryl's  place has all you need: close to two bus routes, welcoming communal area, good bathroom and comfy bed. Great neighbourhood too. "
2710274,14808079,2014-06-26,17213104,Paula,"The neighborhood is lovely, the listing is EXACTLY as posted and the host was a wonderful, helpful, and flexible person.  It IS true that the house is in a renovation, but our room was breezy, clean and exactly as described.  Thanks for a convenient and reasonable place to stay in the middle of an expensive city!"
2710274,15057966,2014-07-01,16067088,Veronica Michel,"Sheryl is great! She is very friendly and hospitable.  The listing for me is just as expected, the house is a work in progress as mentioned but is functional, clean and comfortable.  The rate is very reasonable, the neighborhood is great, charming and there are many things accessible by foot and bus transportation is close by.  I would definitely stay again for the next trip!  Gas Works Park is less than a mile from Sheryl's home and it is lovely!!!"
2710274,15329048,2014-07-07,16102367,Leslie,My husband and I really enjoyed our stay with Sheryl. The room was very comfortable and exactly as described with a beautiful view of the city. The house is being renovated but was exactly as described and was a house full of character. :) We really enjoyed getting to know Sheryl and hope to stay with her again sometime in the neat future! Thank you!
2710274,15575440,2014-07-12,374347,Jessica,"Sheryl was a lovely host, and her house was a great place to stay for a few days. As the other reviews said, her house is a work in progress but it was clean, the bed was comfortable and the shower was strong and hot, that's all I care about really. It was a nice easy walk (easy to connect to the walking/bike trail) to UW for my conference, and the neighborhood is quiet and has great restaurants very close. For the price and location and friendly hospitality, can't beat it!"
2710274,15633864,2014-07-13,16264348,Robert,"As noted, the house is in the process of renovation by Sheryl the owner, but it has a charm, is clean with a comfortable bedroom and a delightful front yard. Sheryl is also delightful and very helpful in orienting me to the neighborhood and nearby restaurants. "
2710274,15838974,2014-07-16,6357216,Ross,"The profile is accurate. Sheryl is a great host. Conscientious, friendly, and easy to talk to about a lot of different subjects. Her attention to amenities and comfort is obvious and much appreciated. We were very comfortable and were helped to feel very much at home. We look forward to staying here again next time I'm in Seattle. Frankly, I can't wait."
2710274,15981926,2014-07-19,17507920,Eric,"We couldn't have had a better first Airbnb experience! Sheryl was a fantastic host. She was friendly, welcoming, and we had a blast spending time with her when we weren't out and about town. Sheryl was a wealth of knowledge about the area (restaurants, sights, neighborhoods) and how to get around using the public transit, as we did not have a rental. 

Sheryl's home is lovely and we were sad to leave such a wonderful neighborhood, as well. The house is clean and comfortable and as the listing says, it is cozy and most definitely charming. Any renovations should be an afterthought as they didn't bother us one bit. We loved it here!

Sheryl's neighborhood, Wallingford, is great and though there's a lot to do in Seattle, you'd hardly need to visit anywhere else. There are great bars and restaurants nearby as well as the beautiful Gas Works Park a few blocks south of the home. Gorgeous homes and yards everywhere and the neighborhood is quiet and relaxing both day and night.

Again, this was a wonderful experience for us. The rate is more than reasonable for such a great host, home, and neighborhood. We look forward to staying again next time we're in town. Thanks, Sheryl!"
2710274,16229007,2014-07-23,18002279,M Lee,"This was a surprise trip for my partner and he's usually very reserved when he meets new people and unfamiliar spaces can be stressful for him. That said, Sheryl was wonderful. From the moment we walked up the driveway and she called out a greeting, it felt like we were friends coming to visit. The house is a work in progress but it has so much character, and it felt like a home. The room was sparce, clean, the bed comfortable, and even though all three upstairs rooms were so close, it was very quiet. There is a lot of exposed wood studs and the house looks like it is in the middle of a remodel that has lasted a long time. You can tell that a lot of work is going into this and she's doing it herself and with love. She showed us around the open spaces, we had our own towels and bath rug (which I appreciated, especially since we are sharing spaces with strangers). 

Sheryl was knowledgeable about all the cute little places to eat and drink and entertaining to chat with, which we did for an hour while unwinding and deciding on dinner plans.  Sheryl was very friendly and I appreciated her engagement with us, especially my very quiet partner. At one point I heard them talking while I was arranging dinner from another spot in the house. We had to leave early the next morning so we didn't get a chance to say good-bye but we are definitely planning a return visit and would stay there again."
2710274,16611607,2014-07-30,4497955,Tamara,"At first I was a bit taken aback with the presentation of the property, and the fact that much was under construction.  But then I realized it was exactly those things (so similar to my own house) that made me feel very much at home here.  That, and Sheryl is a charming, straightforward host who is very comfortable to be around.  She's there, or not, as you will.  She'll let you know what her boundaries are (I was recalcitrant about shoes off and she quickly and kindly reminded me) and respects yours.  My traveling partner and I both spent two afternoons sitting in the yard quite pleasantly enjoying the fabulous weather and trying not to be killed and also eating the apples falling from her ancient apple tree.    Bedroom was very accommodating, very comfortable sleeping, though a bit warm in the early evening.  Bathroom was beautifully light and shower had great pressure and coverage.  There is a refrigerator for guests and we used this for breakfast food and leftovers from the many restaurants that cover both Wallingford and Fremont (the two neighborhoods we explored the most).  

In short, I would come back without hesitation, if only to see what's been done with the house in the interim!"
2710274,16794805,2014-08-02,9365489,Nathalie,"To stay at Sheryl's lovely place was one of my most favorite airbnb experience! Even the house is under charming working constructions,  it felt like taking vacations far away from all the noisey stress in a secret magic garden,  including the amazing surrounding area as well. The room was super clean and big enough for two people. We've shared kitchen and bathroom with Sheryl and another airbnb guest, no problems at all. Besides her amazing ironic ways Sheryl is a totally easy-going person and provided us with helpful infos like a mini tourist center. Over all we came and left like old friends, with lots of great conversations to carry home."
2710274,16869159,2014-08-03,17086407,Lynn,"I enjoyed my very short visit, and could have easily stayed longer.  Yes, the house is a work in progress that happens to be clean, welcoming, and comfortable.  While there must be times when you have the soothing patter of rain on the roof, on this warm July evening I was treated to the occasional sound of an apple falling on the roof!  Sheryl is very friendly, and provided her guests with fresh fruit (including the apples of mention) and freshly made apple crisp!  I loved the Wallingford area--it's a great place for running (Gasworks Park) and I saw people coming out of a yoga studio--something for me to check out in the future!  Sheryl helped me figure out the bus system, and it's a very easy and fairly quick bus ride to downtown, with an easy transfer to the light rail for the airport."
2710274,16902603,2014-08-04,10088275,Ryan,"Sheryl was very welcoming and friendly. The house was a little different than what we expected, it may have just been the time of year with 100s of apples on the lawn or overgrown grass and vehicles on the lawn but when we pulled up we weren't sure we had the right address. That being said, the room itself was clean and exactly as described. We didn't notice in the photos, but the roof does slope over the bed so if two people are sleeping in it the least claustrophobic one gets to sleep on the inside. The stairs up to the bedrooms are narrow and as everyone else has mentioned lots of remodelling is happening. We had a bunch of gear to carry up and down the stairs so it wasn't super easy. The house was clean and colourful, lots of maps are provided to help tourists. The location was fantastic, this was one of our deciding factors when choosing the place and we weren't disappointed."
2710274,17177148,2014-08-08,18995129,Gregory,Sheryl is a fantastic host and a wonderful person. Her home is cozy and loving and the location is great.
2710274,17253532,2014-08-09,299971,Mary Elizabeth,"This was a wonderful and caring place to stay.  It is a walkable, viewable, and accessible neighborhood with access to public transportation.  It is an old house with renovation(s) in process, but if you love this type of place it is a must!"
2710274,17409611,2014-08-11,1028326,Jenny And Alex,"My short stay with Sheryl was great. The was very friendly and helping, give me a rundown of recommendations for the neighborhood, a map, and had a bunch of info on attractions in the area, if you should need it. The house and room were cute and comfortable. As she states, it's a work in progress, so there are unfinished parts of the house, but it doesn't detract at all from the fact that it is a nice place to stay, convenient, and a great price!"
2710274,18122151,2014-08-22,17875733,Kimberly Domino,"I loved my stay at Sheryl's house. Set back from the street, it really had the feel of staying in a farmhouse out in the country. The house is quirky (which is why I chose it), but everything was very clean, and my room had a spectacular view and was perfect for my needs. It even included a vintage desk to work at. Though the house is a work in progress, my stay was not impacted at all negatively by it. This house has great bone structure, and I was impressed with improvements Sheryl had made that serve to bring the lush outdoors in. The intangibles are what really made the stay for me... the house was redolent with the smell of apples from the giant tree out front stewing on the stove, and I also enjoyed the company of my host (who more than went out of her way to help me with job or rental contacts), her nice cat, Joey, and the succession of other nice guests, all of whom I hope to keep in touch with. A great memory will be kicking back in deck chairs on the front lawn and eating ice cream with Sheryl and another guest while shooting the breeze. This was my first Airbnb stay, and it'll be hard to top. I would definitely choose to stay with this host again in the future, and can wholeheartedly recommend it."
2710274,18222773,2014-08-23,1795137,Brady,"This is a comfortable and inexpensive place within easy walking distance to a great Seattle neighborhood: Wallingford. Sheryl is super warm, friendly, and accommodating. As other reviewers have mentioned, the house is under reconstruction so if you're high-maintenance this may not be the place for you. As a world traveler with an appreciation for the eclectic, I loved Sheryl's house and hope to return in the future."
2710274,18274707,2014-08-24,7804003,Karen,"The host was very welcoming, the room was clean and nice, and the neighborhood was terrific.  We would definitely stay there again. "
2710274,18795359,2014-09-01,17160701,Anke,"The house may be work in progress, the atmosphere is not - I felt very much at home and welcome, thanks to Sheryl and Joey."
2710274,18958379,2014-09-03,12899464,Charlène,Our stay in Sheryl's house was lovely. Everything is very organized for guests which helps to feel like home. Sheryl provides us plenty of information to discover the neighborhood and was very friendly. We will recommend this place to anyone.
2710274,19325505,2014-09-10,5226355,Chris,Sheryl was a great host & very welcoming. Very accommodating and friendly. Her home is a little rough around the edges due to the remodeling she is doing by herself. Can't wait for my next visit to see the progress. Thank you Sheryl for the hospitality. 
2710274,19450541,2014-09-12,208481,Chris,"The place was perfect for our needs, and Sheryl was very kind and accommodating. "
2710274,19628351,2014-09-15,2521631,Jenna,"Staying at Sheryl's house was a pleasant experience.  We were coming from Portland and bringing our bikes.  She made room in her basement and allowed us to store them there with ease.  The location of the house is super close off of I-5 and near lots of shops and restaurants.  You can easily walk to a variety of places to shop and eat.  It is a great location between the University district, Fremont, and Ballard.  Sheryl makes you feel comfortable in her home and has a lot of recommendations to offer on what to do in Seattle.  We had a beautiful view from our little room of the city.  "
2710274,20089175,2014-09-23,18698798,J.,"Sheryl made a warm an open welcome and provided a full tour of the house, room, and amenities and made me feel welcome and at home. While under construction with many unfinished sections and details throughout, the living areas are clean and I had everything I needed for my short stay in Seattle. If Sheryl was home she always checked in to make sure I felt invited to join her or she ensured that the TV wasn't load or distracting. The house is located in the charming Wallingford Neighborhood with plenty of food and coffee nearby. Everything is walkable and I didn't need to rent a car for my trip because of decent public transit from the airport and into the neighborhood. I had an easy neighborhood walk to a photography workshop near Lake Union and even saw Mt. Rainier from the south bedroom on my first day. A great value as my first airbnb experience. If you do not like seeing the structure of a house under construction or you are not used to typical cat litter/food smells then I suggest you consider other options. For me this was an easy choice, convenient, and a bargain value matching the accommodations."
2710274,20201502,2014-09-25,2833933,Jessica,"Sheryl was a warm and welcoming host. I felt very comfortable with her immediately and I enjoyed staying in her lovely home. My bedroom was cozy, clean and I slept very well to the sound of the rain. The neighbourhood is safe and pretty and a pleasure to walk through. I hope to stay at this sweet home again."
2710274,20469400,2014-09-29,6761423,Anne,"I felt comfortable and relaxed in this sweet, funky, old Seattle home. It is in the heart of north Seattle and easy access to everything including walking distance to Green Lake. Sheryl is an easy host with lots of knowledge about the area. I will certainly return to ""Joie's Palace"" again.   "
2710274,20850192,2014-10-06,9614821,Brenda,"Sheryl is a warm and hospitable hostess; although I saw her only once during my short visit, I enjoyed our conversation and she very kindly helped me get my 50 pound bag up the stairs to my bedroom.  My room was sweet and comfortable, although 2 people might not be as comfortable in the bed given the knee-wall ceiling structure of the room.  I look forward to staying with Sheryl again when I return to Seattle to visit my son in the U-District.  Super convenient for that, the price is right, and the vibe was a very positive, accepting one.    "
2710274,20924525,2014-10-07,7435243,Jill,"I stayed for only one night in the Cottage and had a good nights sleep. I shared a bath with 3 other people but had no problem. I stayed in South room and saw Mt. Reiner from my window. Sheryl is a very good host who gives a full walkthrough of the house and very polite. Thank you, Sheryl
"
2710274,21021978,2014-10-09,12429415,Ian,Very nice host and good accommodations. The house is under ling term renovation but no problem with cleanliness. Definitely someplace I would come back to. The map on line wasn't quite right on location but great neighborhood none the less.
2710274,21328903,2014-10-14,13189979,Leah,"Warm and welcoming home! Perfect way to see Wallingford, Fremont, and Ballard. It's all so close! Sheryl was very kind and helpful. I was enchanted by all the colors and conveniences: the loveliest purple and golden hues, all the bathroom and bedroom necessities provided, recycling and house care tips, an entire fridge for guests! Thanks again, Sheryl :)"
2710274,22867304,2014-11-16,23503033,Janine,"Great little house in Wallingford.  The host friendly, tidy, organized. Buses convenient to many areas of the city. Quiet neighborhood. View of downtown and the cap of mt. Rainer from the south room. The house is a labor of love for the owner."
2710274,23801438,2014-12-10,22096304,Mike,"Great experience. The place was exactly how described; cozy, quaint, a work in progress. Sheryl was lovely. I enjoyed talking with her and she was genuinely interested in getting to know me. We shared some wine on the first night I was there. Highly recommend staying here! Wallingford is a cool area with lots of restaurants and easy access to some beautiful parks and downtown Seattle. "
2710274,23856963,2014-12-12,6315418,Giulio,"Excellent experience! Sheryl is a welcoming, friendly host, with a cute cat Joey, and her house is located just a few blocks from 45th St. in Wallingford, one of the nicest high streets in Seattle. It's also possible to walk to Fremont and the University District in just 20 minutes (or take the bus, which runs on 45th St.). The room was extremely quiet, which made sleeping wonderful, and Sheryl was happy to chat with me in the living room or leave me alone in my room, as needed. The house is not completely finished in some parts, such as the occasional missing patch of paint, but it's really nothing to worry. Overall, a lovely house in a great location with a nice host!"
2710274,23982174,2014-12-15,798558,Kristen,"Sheryl's place was just as advertised on her profile. The space was clean, cozy, and in s GREAT location. Joey (the cat) is sweet!"
2710274,24573248,2014-12-30,13603519,Anna,"The neighborhood was great - and Sheryl was extremely kind. Guests were given ample space, their own towels and storage in the bathroom, and we welcomed to share the kitchen space - with a fridge only for guests. All in all, a good experience. And certainly good value for money! "
2710274,27370092,2015-03-02,25858932,Kelsey,"My experience staying at this cozy 1905 cottage was fantastic.  Sheryl was an awesome host.  She was the perfect amount of social without encroaching on your space.  If we were both in the house, she would hold a conversation with you, but if you wanted to be in and out of the house to explore Seattle, there was no awkwardness.  

The house was quaint and the neighborhood is beautiful.  The neighborhood was really safe even walking around alone at night.  It is within walking distance of University of Washington/U District and Fremont.  There are also several bus stations within 2 blocks of the house.   I found the location to be perfect.  

Sheryl also gave me tips on places to visit and restaurants to try, all of which were great suggestions.  I would definitely recommend staying here!  She also was very flexible.  My flight got cancelled and I had to stay an extra night and it was no problem."
2710274,28358151,2015-03-22,384993,Alexis,"Sheryl was an amazing host. She was incredibly welcoming and helpful. Her historic home, which is undergoing the final bits of remodeling, has a lot of charm. It's also incredibly close to 45th Street (less than a 5 minute walk), which has a ton of great restaurants, and a grocery store. You get immense bang for your back at Sheryl's. I wholeheartedly recommend staying there."
2710274,28722523,2015-03-29,26809568,Danielle,"It was very quick Seattle trip, but Sheryl was fantastic! This was my first time using Air Bnb, and she made my brother and me feel so welcome. Kind, caring, and funny! Talking to her, it felt like we had been friends for years. Joey the cat is cute too. 
The neighborhood is charming, cozy, and safe. It is close to a lot of restaurants, shops, theaters, grocery stores, bars, etc.  The Neptune Theater was about a 15 minute walk downhill. 
The house is under renovation, but clean and welcoming. The bedroom was nice, comfortable and charming. 
5 Stars, Sheryl! I would definitely stay again. 
"
2710274,28857499,2015-03-30,30153456,Tim,Sheryl was a wonderful host. We enjoyed  conversation late into the night. Then I crashed on a very comfortable bed. Because of the great neighborhood I was able to walk to Julia's restaurant for breakfast and had the best scramble of my life. Good times.
2710274,30583675,2015-04-24,12555407,Andrea,"I had an emergency and needed a place to stay immediately. Sheryl came through like an angel. Her warmth was immediate and without hesitation. Her house was the same, warm, very clean, cozy, and comfortable. We had absolutely everything we needed. She thought of everything!! It's truly a cottage in a big city setting with the comfort of home. The neighborhood is central, friendly, and easy to access. Staying with Sheryl was a great experience!"
2710274,31021392,2015-04-30,31206703,Lorna,"Excellent experience! My 1st Airbnb was booking for guests as my friend has a house on it. Trying it for myself, I couldn't ask for better. This may not be for everyone but I felt really comfortable here. The bed was super comfy and the good two nights sleep were well worth it. I feel like I made a friend with Sheryl. I'll definitely be back every time I have business and fun in Seattle. Great neighborhood for single women, too."
2710274,31141323,2015-05-02,1270438,Delany,"Perfect! 

Sheryl is a more than generous host and I couldn't have ask for a better place to stay or to feel more at home. No really I lived in the neighborhood for a few years so it was home. 

Recommendation: Stay in the South Room (it's got a skyline view).  

Thanks Sheryl! 

"
2710274,31405687,2015-05-04,3739005,Amber & Dan,"We had a great stay with Sheryl. She was very inviting and offered us tea as soon as we walked in the door. We stayed in the purple room with a very comfortable bed and lovely view. 

Her home is an ongoing work in progress, but it's by no means messy and it doesn't feel like you're in a construction zone. 

She is also within walking distance of a great area to eat and explore. 

I highly recommend you stay with Sheryl!"
2710274,31820902,2015-05-10,26557530,Cynthia,"Cheryl welcomed me and my Seattle family at the time we'd arranged. My grandchildren were charmed by her openness and good nature. Her house, a short walk from my family's home, is undergoing renovation, yet Cheryl was able to provide a super comfortable bedroom upstairs and shared bathroom downstairs. The neighborhood is lovely: quiet, graced by gardens including hers, and very convenient to bus routes and to Irwin's, a great cafe. So Seattle!"
2710274,33295390,2015-05-26,32791250,Mark,"This was my first time using Airbnb and I couldn't be happier. I will continue to take advantage of this great way to visit new places, get an authentic feel for how locals live and enjoy the company of friendly hosts and fellow guests. 

Sheryl is a very accommodating host and provided great advice for getting to her home from the airport, as well as great recommendations for sites/activities in Seattle. The cottage has an eclectic feel and numerous renovations in-progress. Late May was an excellent time to visit as the neighborhood was in bloom and the air was delightfully fragrant. Thank you, Sheryl, for sharing your home with us."
2710274,33534493,2015-05-29,30488796,Geeta,Lovely old house in a lovely neighborhood! Couldn't have been happier with my choice. Sheryl gave crystal-clear directions and instructions and ensured that everything was seamless in terms of key handover etc. Only had a brief chance to chat to Sheryl (arrived late in the evening and left very early the next morning) but I really enjoyed my chat with her and was rather sad that I wasn't staying longer as I would have loved to have explored the neighborhood more and this was the perfect launch-off point. This will definitely be my first choice of accommodation anytime that I am in Seattle.
2710274,33676458,2015-05-31,12936998,Sarah,Our stay was very satisfactory. The room was comfortable and clean. The house is in a great neighborhood. Great place to stay if you are on a road trip! 
2710274,33880943,2015-06-01,2440917,Mark,"Even though my wife and I never met Sheryl, she made our quick, one night experience smooth and simple in terms of easy check-in and directions to the house and to our room. Everything was as advertised....cozy and charming. And the location can't be beat for a great night of food (ramen & ice cream) and perambulating one of the most picturesque neighborhoods in Seattle.  "
2710274,34552863,2015-06-09,8735823,Amy,Sheryl was a great host- made me feel very welcome in her home.
2710274,34692666,2015-06-11,13967830,Sheila,It was great staying with Sheryl again.  She is so welcoming and gracious and will look forward to staying at her house anytime I go to see my daughter.  
2710274,35094119,2015-06-15,30930200,Jerry,Sheryl made me feel most welcome. Her transit and driving directions were detailed and quite welcome. The neighborhood is quiet with stores and eastaurants within easy walking distance. 
2710274,35734079,2015-06-21,35161537,Manasa,Sheryl was very helpful and welcoming. The neighborhood is a happening place and Sheryl was very enthusiastic to make me feel home. It is a wonderful stay.
2710274,35986293,2015-06-23,1571741,Konnie,"What a lovely house and host.  The space provided was very nice, and had everything I could ever need.  I appreciate how she clearly communicates in messages, in person and around the house.  I really liked the funky nature of her house, all the important bits were done to perfection, and the other parts were 100% charm! "
2710274,36067367,2015-06-24,24341417,Jerry,"You'll love Sheryl!  We had several great conversations.   Very easy going - when my plans changed,  Sheryl was happy to have me hang out in her sunny front lawn.   Room was clean and tidy."
2710274,36728204,2015-06-30,30501869,Juan,"Sheryl was a great hostess.  She made us feel at home.  Her home is a work in progress, but our bedroom and bath were clean and orderly as advertised.  "
2710274,36844498,2015-07-01,4407293,Jesse,"Sheryl was super nice, and her home was a comfortable and enjoyable place to stay. There are a lot of renovation projects happening, which I have to admit disconcerted me at first, but in the end I found it inspiring that she is doing a lot of this work all by herself. Her home is perfectly safe for visitors, and I would happily stay there again! "
2710274,37504728,2015-07-07,36287831,Marjorie,"Sheryl was great! We came during July 4th weekend and she gave us so many tips on making the most of our time there. She was very welcoming and her home is so cute. My fiancé and I were apartment hunting and the location was perfect for getting around. The room was clean and tidy, and she has really made it comfortable for guests to be there. Overall, great stay!"
2710274,37893480,2015-07-11,36560432,Marina,"Sheryl was a great host and made us feel very welcome. She is organized and knows a lot about the city. She recommended places to eat, different things to see in the neighborhood, and knew the best ways to get around the city. The neighborhood is also quiet but close to downtown and UW!"
2710274,38544796,2015-07-16,4111182,Terry,My girlfriend and I had a great time talking with Sheryl and staying in her place. She was a gracious and helpful host. The home is located in an awesome neighborhood and there is a lot to do within walking distance. This was probably the most thoughtful airbnb home I have stayed in with respect to how well everything in the house was explained and labeled. It's clear that the home and the listing are a labor of love for Sheryl. I'd stay here again. 
2710274,39336304,2015-07-22,16617670,Jane,"Sheryl greeted us at the door, showed us all around the house, told us interesting stories about the house and herself, and her ongoing home-improvement projects - all very fascinating.  She offered us cold drinks and hot showers after our weekend of hiking - so welcome!!
Our room was clean and pretty and well-ventilated. 
The common spaces are inviting and full of interesting photos, art and linens.  It's a great neighborhood, easy walking to parks, restaurants and shops.  Tree-lined sidewalks, very pleasant."
2710274,39534482,2015-07-24,34786770,Cai,"Sheryl was very nice to everyone. The room is small but very clean. She put things in great order and there are instructions in detail for the towels, trash and so on. There was an old apple tree in front of the house. Be careful about the red apples falling from the tree because they taste good!
She also showed us the groceries and restaurants in the neighborhood. 
It is a great experience in her house."
2710274,39964526,2015-07-27,36353474,Sara,It was a great location. Close to transit and shops all within walking distance. Small cozy room. Good value!
2710274,40640301,2015-08-01,34600110,Kathryn,"Sheryl's home is rustic but modern, welcoming, fully equipped, close to amenities with public transport to downtown Seattle practically on her doorstep. It is very clean and well organised. Sheryl is an easy going and informative host, a pleasure to converse with! 

Wallingford is full of affordable eateries, independent shops, a 24 hour grocery store right around the corner and plenty of entertainment. The neighbourhood is picturesque and feels very safe.

My boyfriend and I loved every minute of our 5 day stay. Even though we only spent a short time with Sheryl we felt like we were visiting an old friend."
2710274,41453627,2015-08-07,22900075,Cara,"This was my first time staying with a host, I have always used the Private Home option. This was a fantastic experience. Sheryl was the most welcoming host. This was a special night because it was Neighbor's Night Out, so the neighborhood was having a potluck. Sheryl invited me to join them, and her neighbors welcomed me as well. It was great chance for me to hear what it is like to live in Seattle. Sheryl has great recommendations for spots in the neighborhood. I love that you can walk to a lot of them from her house!  I could have talked to Sheryl all night! She makes you feel very comfortable. This experience will be hard to beat. I could not have asked for a better host. "
2710274,41805251,2015-08-09,37883858,Tom,Sheryl was a wonderful host. She met us at the door and greeted us. The neighborhood is quiet. The home is clean even though it's under renovations. Great experience. 
2710274,42605592,2015-08-14,37875693,Camille,"This was my first AirBnB experience, and Sheryl was an excellent host. When I called her before driving into Seattle, I felt immediately at ease and it seemed like I knew her for years. Returning each night after seeing the city really felt like coming ""home"" to this space she shared. I would definitely stay here again next time I'm in the city. Thanks Sheryl!"
2710274,44858079,2015-08-29,18887313,Chenery,"Sheryl was very welcoming! Her house is charming, comfortable, and a little quirky. The location is excellent - in a residential neighborhood close to shopping and bus stops. Sheryl has lots of maps and resources for travelers and the house is very well set-up for AirBnb guests. My sister and I enjoyed chatting with Sheryl and wished we could have stayed longer in Seattle."
2710274,45333205,2015-09-01,5086481,Blake,"Sheryl is a wonderful host. The room is quite, cozy and near everything. "
2710274,45525160,2015-09-03,36391290,Zoe,"My stay at Sheryl's cozy cottage was wonderful. Sheryl was extremely helpful in helping me navigate the neighborhood and making sure that I had all the information that I needed. She was fun to chat with but also let me have my space, which was very much appreciated. The accommodations were beautiful and Sheryl was kind enough to offer some freshly picked grapes and plums! I recommend this listing to people visiting Seattle who want to have a very kind and personable host with vast amounts of knowledge in terms of all Seattle has to offer."
2710274,48612610,2015-09-27,5986296,Barbara,"I really enjoyed my stay with Sheryl - very welcoming and great company!  Ideal location - walking distance to a movie theatre and restaurants and a hilly but pleasant bike ride to downtown Seattle.
Thanks, Sheryl!"
2710274,48949030,2015-09-29,1277364,Jeffrey,Sheryl was a very nice and accommodating host. Coordination via phone and email was great. Her home is older but fairly well kept. The cost was pricey in my opinion but that may be that Seattle is relatively more expensive than other cities. The location was excellent having rented a car.
2710274,49403966,2015-10-03,33939461,Aaron & Sarah,"Sheryl was very welcoming and helpful. She showed me where everything was located in the house right away and explained the house rules. I didn't spend much time at the house because of other engagements, but she was open to hanging out and having a conversation when I did see her. At the time I visited, her house renovations were more extensive than I originally thought based on her listing description, but it didn't really bother me. 

Wallingford is a very charming neighborhood with big, historic houses and beautiful gardens. Sheryl's house is situated very close to the main drag where the nearby grocery store, coffee shops, bars, and restaurants are. "
2710274,50525686,2015-10-12,3064701,Larry,"Sheryl was extremely welcoming, friendly, and accessible. I found visiting with her one of the highlights of my stay. I liked the location, near to places I wanted to visit. The street is quiet. Guests should know the one bathroom is downstairs and that Sheryl is remodeling. But it met my needs. Also, breakfast consists of fruit and tea or coffee, self-serve."
2710274,52631296,2015-10-31,26472201,Rudolf,"Sometimes you look for a getaway to that perfect yet lifeless space of a hotel room where the environment is carefully crafted to not be memorable and the staff do their best to be invisible. This is the exact opposite. A space lovingly in flux. An experiment in achieving zen in a space under construction. A host that offers unconditional friendship and interesting conversation if you are willing to accept it or just a space you may share. In short, I would stay here again, whatever it may look like tomorrow :)"
2710274,53057259,2015-11-04,43180582,Anderson,What Sheryl provide is a clean and comfortable room. And she is very nice and enthusiastic. 
2710274,54914335,2015-11-25,5939504,Sarah,"After an initial hiccup checking-in, Sheryl proved to be a gracious and generous host ---  a true Seattle neighborhood experience perfect for fellow travelers, conversationalists, tradespeople, etc.  Wallingford is unique and charming, as is Sheryl and her work-in-progress home.  Easy walk to coffee & pastries (Irwin's), food & drink (Kate's Pub) and a short drive to tools & sundries (Hardwick's.)  My new first choice for accommodations when I travel to Seattle."
2710274,55371325,2015-12-01,44770046,Miriam,Sheryl made every attempt to make me feel as though her home was mine for the duration.   It was perfect.
2710274,55900513,2015-12-07,16790818,Sally,"Hostess is warm, funny, easy to chat with and very accommodating. The place is clean as a whistle...plenty of room for my things..shower is hot and lovely, bed is comfortable in a super quiet neighborhood. I could walk to everything, parking was right out front, with easy access. "
5593504,28351264,2015-03-22,28830020,Luke,Justin was very courteous and accommodating. I loved staying in Eastlake because you're high in the hills with a gorgeous view of Seattle and just a twenty minute bus ride to downtown. 
5593504,28842370,2015-03-30,29831037,Shyneth,"A very lovely home, the room was more spacious than expected with a private bathroom. Prime location, it was within 15 minutes from Fremont, downtown and Capitol Hill. Parking wasn't as bad of an issue as anticipated and we were provided with a guest pass which made it so much more convenient. Met Justin very briefly, our schedules didn't align very well during our stay but he is very kind and respected our privacy. Overall, great experience, highly recommend! "
5593504,29208400,2015-04-05,25569917,Tatsuya,"I had great time in Justin's house. The room was so clean and cozy, and it has even a private bathroom. The location is perfect. This house is on a hill so you can see Space needle and downtown from the window in the living room. Justin is super chill guy and took care of me well. I definitely visit here again."
5593504,30094755,2015-04-17,16475507,Andrew,"Justin has a clean and very comfortable place. Though he wasn't around during my stay, he kept in contact the whole time to make sure I had everything I need. The beautiful South Lake Union is right around the corner and the bus was easy to catch into the city, very convenient. Highly recommend to all."
5593504,32632725,2015-05-19,33049550,Alicia,"Justin has a wonderful place with a great view of the city. He was super communicative and helpful throughout our stay in Seattle, despite being away on vacation himself. Justin made sure my friend and I had everything we needed. I would definitely stay here again."
5593504,45190962,2015-08-31,35352325,Sarah,"We had a great time staying with Justin, the place was in an amazing location, beautiful views from the window of the space needle. 
Justin was very accommodating and helpful."
5593504,45888715,2015-09-06,28806683,Emily,"Justin's home is very cute and tucked away on a quiet Eastlake street. The room was really clean and just the right size for my partner and I. Justin was super accommodating, taking us in rather last-minute and communicative about arrival. I definitely recommend staying with him!"
5593504,46322073,2015-09-09,41927327,Bonnie,"Justin made my first Airbnb experience a great one! My boyfriend and I stayed at Justin's this past Labor Day weekend. It was our first time in Seattle and this place was in the perfect location. Everything is located less than 2 miles from here so using Uber/Lyft was easy and cheap. There were many places within walking distance as well. We didn't get to meet Justin, but that's okay because he just left his key for us and the password to the wifi and we were set! The room and private bathroom were both very clean and he even left towels for us to use! The only thing that bothered me a bit at first was the sunroof in the room. It got very bright early in the morning, but it turned out to be a good thing for us because we needed to start exploring the city early anyway. We would definitely stay at his place if we ever came back to Seattle!"
5593504,47118157,2015-09-15,24358736,Stéphanie,"The private bedroom and bathroom are so nice! The pictures on Airbnb are less good than the reality, we were surprised :-) The neighborhood is quiet and not to far to Downtown. Justin is very friendly and convenient for the check-in/out. "
5593504,47839944,2015-09-21,27700495,Jocelyne,The listing was very accurate and the room felt slightly bigger than expected because of the bathroom attached.  Great location for what I needed and would not mind to come back and rent from Justin.  Everything was clean and quiet!
5593504,47886549,2015-09-21,16255806,Tiffany,"The listing in the description was accurate and Justin was friendly. The room/bathroom was clean and neat, and the location is very close to a few buses that head downtown. The neighborhood was quiet and seemed safe to walk at night. Definitely recommend staying here."
5593504,48593803,2015-09-27,13931605,Heather,The room was much bigger than I imagined. The private bath was very convenient . Justin made me feel right at home. Wonderful place to stay. Only down side was parking. Was able to park a few blocks away. It will be the first place I look next time I stay in Seattle. 
5593504,53647197,2015-11-10,29656007,Robert,The room was very nice and Justin was friendly and unassuming — bus stop is a few minutes away and there were a bunch of restaurants right close by as well.
5593504,53866560,2015-11-13,1834229,Mymy,Justin was the nicest and most accommodating host I've ever had! The entire town home is beautiful and the room was just what I needed.    The private bathroom was a huge plus! The location was also prime. I'm definitely staying there again. 
5593504,54390964,2015-11-19,47401339,Kate,"My friend and I shared the bedroom and the space is actually much bigger than the picture! The bedroom and bathroom both have skylights, so you will be waking up early with the sun. The private bathroom was a plus. Justin's space was warm and inviting and he was totally accommodating- he even was able to pick us up from downtown on our first day in Seattle, which was hugely appreciated because it was raining and we had all our bags with us. His space is in an AWESOME neighborhood, completely accessible to several bus stops, coffee shops, intimate dining, and even a grocery store if you plan on doing your own cooking. Cool neighborhood, clean and spacious townhome, and a helpful host. Would definitely book with Justin again in the future."
5593504,57140710,2015-12-22,23868410,Megan,"Justin was very welcoming from the beginning. He was very flexible with our check in time and allowed us to arrive later than expected. The room is very cozy and exactly what you need as a ""home base"" if you are eager to explore the city. He kept to himself, but was very approachable if we had any questions. All in all, it was a great experience."
4318814,23142938,2014-11-23,24017819,Dena,Caleb's apartment in his home was so cozy and nice. My husband and I were in town for a wedding and the space was perfect. Caleb was a welcoming host and the house was centrally located. The space was clean and Caleb even had beers in the fridge for us. We would definitely stay here again.
4318814,23918495,2014-12-14,18495127,Jenessa,"Caleb's private apartment was charming and peaceful. It was exactly what we were looking for in a get away: quiet, cozy, and relaxing but still central to all of the great neighborhood shops and restaurants. I would highly recommend Caleb's place to stay!"
4318814,25299610,2015-01-11,25755466,Joseph,Great house in a great location.  Caleb made everything quite seamless for us in our short time there.  Highly recommended.
4318814,25581855,2015-01-19,11274678,Kim,"Caleb's home is stunning and exactly as described and as photographed.  A friend and I stayed here for a weekend trip to Seattle and it was a very seamless experience - communication with Caleb was easy, the space was beautiful, and we appreciated the little touches such as coffee and beer in the fridge.  We would definitely stay here again!"
4318814,25949792,2015-01-30,546417,Ken,Great location. Wonderful host.  I'll be back
4318814,26111719,2015-02-03,25281983,Lucas,"We really enjoyed this space. Several times we commented that we could live here! The bed was comfortable, the kitchen was useful, and the pool table was great fun. The two chairs in front of the huge TV were very comfy.  Parking is easy on the street right outside the door. Caleb was very accommodating to our schedule even though I changed check in multiple times due to flight delays and family visits. We will be recommending it to our friends and family when they come to visit."
4318814,26468253,2015-02-13,27294514,Corrie,Everything was great! The space looked exactly like the pictures and was the perfect getaway for my husband and I. It was in an awesome location at a very affordable price. My husband and I hope to live in a place similar to this someday. 
4318814,26512052,2015-02-14,25973984,Pierre,"I really enjoyed my time here, very cool place with interesting books, guitars and the big LCD TV with Netflix.  It was super easy to check in/out, the WIFI is great.  All in all, I would totally comeback to stay here.
Thanks Caleb!"
4318814,26549746,2015-02-15,24555791,Lisa,"My husband and I were comfortable and enjoyed the pool table. The home was as described, full of interesting decor like musical instruments and was clean and tidy. We never met Caleb but he was quick to call and check on us. Thank you for your hospitality.  "
4318814,26611663,2015-02-16,3004560,Stephanie,"We loved our stay at the top of Phinney Ridge. Caleb was quick to respond, kind and welcoming. We loved the space - it was close to the fun of Seattle and yet it also felt like a retreat: pool table, giant tv, beautiful decor. Will come back for sure!"
4318814,27392762,2015-03-03,25997835,August,"Just spent three relaxing nights in Caleb's apartment.  Caleb met us on arrival and was a gracious host, to the point of checking in with us before doing some necessary work on the premises.  The location has great western views, and the zoo and Green Lake are easy walks away.  "
4318814,27549000,2015-03-07,26080170,Sammy,"We had a great experience in Caleb's apartment! It's in a beautiful and quiet neighborhood near Woodland Park Zoo. We were able to park right out front of the entrance. The space itself felt homey and open. Being musical enthusiasts, we enjoyed the guitars and ukuleles that were hanging on the walls. The pool table was also a great source of entertainment. The wifi wasn't working too well the night we stayed, but we brought movies with us to watch. The bed was comfortable (but maybe not big enough for someone over 6' tall) and the bathroom was fully stocked (great water pressure in the shower). You can hear footsteps above you in the bedroom, but it's not overwhelmingly loud. Also, there is beer and wine in the fridge if you need a drink at the end of the day. If you plan on staying longer than a few days, there isn't really closet space to hang up clothes. We were just there for one night, so living out of our suitcase wasn't a problem. "
4318814,27614275,2015-03-08,15674699,Crystal,Caleb's home is beautiful. My boyfriend and I loved the decor and special touches. Great area. Loved it!!
4318814,27957150,2015-03-15,500385,Erin,"It was great to come back to Caleb's place after a long day out and about in Seattle—it was super comfy with lots of interesting details, including a collection of instruments which Caleb bravely encouraged us to try out if we felt like it. Hopefully we haven't made him rethink that policy, haha."
4318814,28187353,2015-03-19,16396983,Heather,"Arrival was very easy and the host was accessible during our stay. We had everything we needed (toiletries, laundry machine/detergent).  We weren't given with much to cook with so we ate out a lot which is fine, and the dishwasher wasn't set up.  Coffee and tea were provided."
4318814,28664729,2015-03-28,19928707,Robert,"Caleb was a gracious host during my visit to Seattle. The apartment was just as the pictures show. The neighborhood, with the views from the deck, was breathtaking. I felt very comfortable and had everything I needed. I look forward to my next stay!"
4318814,29144545,2015-04-04,5832461,New,"the location is excellent: a lovely and quiet neighborhood with friendly people, close to the zoo and some great places to eat. inside the space you'll find all the entertainment options you could ever need, a functional kitchen, a cozy bathroom, and a comfortable bed.  caleb is a gracious and attentive host. highly recommended!"
4318814,29615998,2015-04-10,11707129,Lee,"This was my first time using airbnb but it won't be my last. I'm so tired of staying in hotel rooms. Caleb's Top of Phinney Ridge was fantastic. A great space, comfy bed, a real kitchen, and a wonderful neighborhood made my stay in Seattle very enjoyable. Restaurants and a grocery store are just up the street. The zoo and park are a couple of blocks away.  It was a great stay."
4318814,30039268,2015-04-16,4867970,Megan,"Caleb's house was nestled in a beautiful neighborhood with amazing views.  The hosts were very welcoming and Caleb offered us a Corona upon arrival, which we enjoyed while playing pool! We ate dinner at the Phinney Market Pub and Eatery (so good!) and were fully satiated! The airbnb was all we hoped for and more - very cozy, clean, and fun.  "
4318814,30245145,2015-04-19,14836497,Nick,"We had a great time staying at Caleb's place. The apartment is great, just as described. There is an excellent view off the back deck. Caleb made sure we had everything we needed and was a great host. "
4318814,30507007,2015-04-23,29244684,KeSorn,"Me and my girlfriend love the place, very nice neighborhood, we felt very relax and wanted to stay longer. Very convenient to go to everywhere."
4318814,30737980,2015-04-26,19185611,Cara,"We had a wonderful time staying here! Caleb gave us a tour around the place and was helpful in answering questions about the space and the local area. It was clean and accurate to the photos. It was well decorated, great bed and overall a fun place to stay. Easy to find, close to the bus, zoo, park and places to eat. "
4318814,31176947,2015-05-03,20030552,John,"I stayed here for three days, Caleb was a wonderful host, it was an easy check-in and he was pleasant and quick to respond to any questions.  The pictures and details are accurate.  However, the view from the deck is amazing.  I was lucky enough to get sunshine and was able to read and watch the ship canal from the deck.  From the inside, to the deck, to this location which is central to everything from the UofW to Ballard this is a great place to stay.  The location makes getting around very easy.  I will stay here again next time I am in the area."
4318814,31671071,2015-05-08,19932361,Arthur,"I really enjoyed my stay. The place was very clean, nicely furnished and perfect my 3 day stay for work.
Access to the apartment was easy and the kitchen was well equipped.
Thank you!"
4318814,31999205,2015-05-12,32308612,Alessandro,"My girlfriend and I stayed there for a weekend trip to Seattle. We only met Caleb once, and he is a super nice guy. The place is super clean, we'll maintained and is decorated very tastefully. The pool table is perfect for finishing off a busy day of sight seeing. The fridge also had some beers and condiments in case we needed them. We had an amazing time and hope to come back in the future!"
4318814,32010294,2015-05-12,2133947,Linh,"Caleb was a very welcoming host.  My husband, toddler and I had a great time staying at his place.  It was well kept, easy to find, in a nice quiet neighbourhood.  We especially enjoyed the pool table and our toddler loved the slide.  Would definitely stay again."
4318814,32266942,2015-05-16,17825490,Paige,"What a wonderful place!  The view was stunning, the space welcoming and intriguing, well-stocked with everything we could need.  We loved the instruments around, beckoning to be played, and wish we'd had time for a game of pool!  

Caleb was very responsive and made sure we settled in all right, and though we didn't get to actually meet (busy family weekend!), I know we'd have hit it off if we had.  We did follow the suggestion of a nearby pub for dinner one night, and it turned out to be the perfect place.  I want to go back soon!

The neighborhood is gorgeous, and we were able to walk to nearby attractions (Woodland Park Zoo, the aforementioned pub) as well as to the bus stop that took us directly to and from downtown and Safeco field.  Extremely convenient.

We are so glad we found this wonderful place to stay, and would return, and recommend it to family and friends, in a heartbeat!"
4318814,32701723,2015-05-20,31623535,Branden,"Had a great stay at phinney ridge! Beautiful location with a fantastic patio that has a phenomenal view. Walking distance to the zoo. Excellent bakery near the zoo on a corner (Fresh Flours). Provided beer, vodka, coffee, and toiletries! Provided a pack n play for our little one, too! Much appreciated! Great instruments and pool table. Little interaction with host, but was very nice and came by to check in on day 3.

Just a few things to note... the bed is a small queen (or a double bed) so it is a cozy for 2 adults. There is no couch, just chairs for sitting. There are two steps to get into kitchen and bedroom in case you have small children. There is not a place to eat indoors (the patio is fantastic of there is nice weather though).  About 15 minutes from downtown = $15 uber ride (lots of drivers in the area).  If planning on cooking meals there, they have a lightly stocked kitchen.  Good for  simple meals.  Does have one pan and one smaller pot well as a double boiler.  Can hear footsteps above as they live there, but did not bother us.  Place is as pictured.  

Overall a great stay.  Would be a fantastic place to host a party!"
4318814,33073741,2015-05-25,12800454,Kyle,"Caleb was very welcoming and the place was great - very central to awesome coffee, food and beer. We would definitely stay again!"
4318814,33838618,2015-06-01,32866882,Carson,"Our first AirBnB experience. It was great. Caleb was very responsive and answered all my questions. The place is just like the pictures. It's very clean and well maintained. The location was fantastic, it was very nearby everything. The Phinney Market Pub was 10mins WALKING distance. And, that was a great recommentation. Only think I would change would be to stay there longer, "
4318814,34253671,2015-06-06,2882960,David,"Caleb did a great job of communicating and making it easy to connect at his location. The space is big and comfortable and the pool table is a unique attraction. This was an anniversary trip so we ate at restaurants every meal. The full kitchen went unused - note, there is no dining area of any kind, but it didn't matter to us. "
4318814,34298375,2015-06-07,31146713,Joel,"An excellent Airbnb host, the place was neat and cozy. We especially enjoyed the view from the porch! Caleb was very responsive with our questions."
4318814,34948936,2015-06-14,30545797,Huy,I was a little nervous as this was our first AirBNB experience. Caleb made it very seamless and it was a joy to stay in his place. It was nice and cozy and I loved the opportunity to play a game of pool or noodle on the guitars. I would definitely stay again if the opportunity arises. 
4318814,35383474,2015-06-18,32136855,Zachary,"To start this place was excellent. Great view, cozy place and great host.  As my first Air bnb experience this was immensely better than I thought it would be. The place felt like home and was nice to come home to. It wasn't far from anything and you could walk or take uber. I would definitely stay there again and would highly recommend Caleb and this house. Thank you for sharing your house with my girlfriend and I! "
4318814,36016057,2015-06-24,7087434,Lynne,Caleb's daughter came down to give us the key (we were a little early) and then Caleb came down to introduce himself and show us around. The apartment was really beautiful.  It did have a nice view of the garden and with a few steps a view of the city down to the river.  The result was very open and airy.  There is a large pool table that my husband enjoyed playing.   We did eat a few meals there and used the little table near the window as our dining area.  It was small but very nice and comfortable.  A very good friendly vibe throughout.
4318814,36666425,2015-06-30,5883891,Courtney,"Caleb was a great host, he was very flexible in accommodating our late arrival (missed a connecting flight en route). The suite was very well appointed and very comfortable (especially during the heatwave). Location was fantastic (amazing view of Seattle) and very close to a number of great restaurants, bars, coffee shops, and a short drive to the rest of the city.  Parking can be a little challenging in Seattle, but we never had trouble finding a spot in this neighborhood. 

We loved having a kitchen so that we could cook breakfast and dinner rather than relying on restaurants throughout our stay. We did notice that the washing machine was broken, but once brought to Caleb's attention, he offered to let us use his family's washer and dryer. 

All-in-all a wonderful place to stay if you prefer a neighborhood setting. "
4318814,36953365,2015-07-03,6296760,Jane,"A welcomed spot for several days in Seattle.  It offers a handy kitchenette, comfortable lounging room with a pool table ready for play, little table and chairs on deck to catch the sun and savor the lush, sweet neighborhood, and, oh yes, a bedroom.  Caleb gave us a quick intro to the apt, and we quickly made ourselves at home.  A great home base for the two of us! "
4318814,37845986,2015-07-11,31735882,Julie,"This was an especially nice place to stay. It was clean, the bed and pillows were extra comfy and the pool table was a huge bonus that we took advantage of. We enjoyed the deck and the warmth and comfortableness of the place. We could have used more cookware and cooking utensils, but we made do. I would like highly recommend your place. Wonderful experience."
4318814,38266813,2015-07-14,1702920,Danielle,"We had a great stay at Caleb's place! After living in Seattle for 7 years, I knew that a place on Phinney Ridge would be a great location to bring my family to for their first visit to Seattle -and it was.
The place was clean and comfortable. The view of the Olympic Mountains is right out the door! 
Like Caleb mentions in the description, you will hear foot steps/furniture from above but it dies down at a reasonable hour :)
We did not meet Caleb and one of his daughters until the morning that we left -and I am so glad that we did because they are such a pleasant family. I would bring my family back here as well as recommend Caleb's place to my friends and family. Its a fabulous location in a great Seattle neighborhood."
4318814,39144180,2015-07-21,1003309,Matthias,"Everything was perfect. Smooth checkin, beautiful apartment and a wonderful stay all-around. Caleb was very welcoming."
4318814,39728661,2015-07-26,23224280,Jennifer,"We throughly enjoyed our stay at Phinney Ridge With a View! Caleb was a very hospitable host and the apartment was perfect for our stay. It was very clean and the location was great. Very accessible to the bus line and within walking distance to restaurants, zoo, grocery etc. We hope to return next year to Phinney Ridge when our son has his  wedding."
4318814,40599075,2015-08-01,3011921,Kyle,"Caleb's place is fantastic. Perfect location being close to Freemont and we loved the view of the ocean and mountains. Inside the suite there's beautiful exposed brick, a pool table, and the walls are lined with guitars and books.

We could hear footsteps upstairs but not an any unreasonable hours so it didn't bother us at all. I'd highly recommend this place."
4318814,40924207,2015-08-03,35415401,Eric,"Had a wedding in Seattle and hotel prices were insane, so found this great place up in Phinney Ridge. Had everything we needed, and even got a game of pool in. Their recommendation to try the local pub, which I believe they also own, turned out to be great too.

The only issue is that the apartment is below the main house, and the bedroom is directly below their common area, so we'd wake up to their kids running around in the morning quite a bit. Also, it doesn't seem like there's a lock door between the bedroom and the rest of their house - there should be something there to better ""separate"" the unit from the rest of the house."
4318814,41371001,2015-08-07,14996380,Kevin,"We had a great stay at Caleb's place. The apartment was very nice and clean. It had a gorgeous view from atop the city. Moreover, the location was perfect - it was a quick walk from Fremont and only about a mile from the eastern parts of Ballard. There was a pretty accessible bus line that went downtown as well. 

Caleb was incredibly friendly and helpful. He had tons of recommendations for places to eat, drink, and see. He was also very accommodating if you had any questions/requests. Definitely one of the best airbnb hosts I've ever had.

Next time we're in Seattle we're definitely going to see if this spot is available again. I would highly recommend it to anyone visiting Seattle."
4318814,41950077,2015-08-10,33599674,Matthew,"Everything was great! Caleb's decor is wonderful and has a great mix of Seattle pride and cool old artifacts, and the view down the ridge is fantastic. His pub has some amazing coffee too!"
4318814,42374761,2015-08-13,2378503,Jennifer,"We loved this private apartment in Phinney Ridge!  It was the perfect space to relax in, and had all the amenities (plus a pool table, guitars for playing, and tons of books!).  The space stayed nice and cool during the warm summer days, and we looked forward to coming home and vegging out in the comfy chairs in the living room.

As the host and guests have said, there is noise from upstairs, but it is within the expected daytime hours.  We weren't bothered by it at all.  The only other thing that became apparent is that the bathroom is not built for a short person!  The shower head is quite high (I had to have my boyfriend help adjust it) and the mirror in the bathroom is way over my head.  Very minor issues, but something to note!  Next time I'll bring a step stool.  :)

Caleb dropped in and said hello on the evening that we arrived, which was nice.  Otherwise, it was a very quiet and private stay.  We really enjoyed our time here, and would definitely return!"
4318814,43036757,2015-08-17,33323669,Katie,"We had an excellent stay and couldn’t ask for a better first Airbnb experience! Caleb’s place is exactly as pictured - private entrance, very clean, and in a beautiful, safe neighborhood. The bathroom and kitchen were well stocked with essentials. The bedroom was comfortable and very quiet at night. Having wifi and a washer/dryer was great too. The location was perfect for us, walking distance to an amazing zoo and a couple restaurants, and on-street parking was always available.

Caleb was very welcoming and friendly. We didn’t have the opportunity to visit with him or his family because we had a whirlwind weekend tour of Seattle planned with our family in the area; however, he seemed very accessible if we had needed anything. I would definitely stay here again, and would highly recommend it!"
4318814,43497728,2015-08-20,36086755,Ian,Caleb did a great job. The space was clean and well maintained. Everything was as described and the location was great. Highly recommended.
4318814,43966736,2015-08-23,34546844,Michael,"Caleb was an amazing host!  Helped show us in when we arrived and made us feel very welcome.  The space was very nice and unique. Awesome decor, comfortable, and a great view from the deck! "
4318814,44661385,2015-08-28,38516724,Sharon,"Caleb was very welcoming, gave good instructions, and left some treats in the fridge.  His place is nicely appointed, great neighborhood and view, very comfortable.  I enjoyed my stay immensely.  "
4318814,45514276,2015-09-03,15121499,Kathryn,"Caleb's place is just awesome! Great location with all the comforts of home. Waking distance to fun restaurants, shops and great parks. The space itself is really spacious and private. I highly recommend and would for sure stay here again!"
4318814,45699779,2015-09-05,2797168,Megan,"The house is in a beautiful neighborhood with quick access to great restaurants, bars and shops. We walked 10 minutes to Caleb's restaurant/pub, which was excellent and we highly recommend. The apartment was private, very charming, comfortable and had everything we needed. The deck and view were great. We like spending time in Ballard and that was a 5 minute drive away. It was easy getting in and out of the apartment. We would stay again and send friends and family there."
4318814,45940203,2015-09-07,35914663,Matt,"Caleb was great and the apartment was wonderful!

When we arrived, Caleb provided helpful instructions via text to get into the place.  He later stopped by to say hello, show us around, brought us fresh towels, and gave advice on places to eat nearby.   There was a print out on the pool table with everything we needed to know for our first Airbnb experience.  After that, he left us alone, and we had a wonderful time in Seattle and enjoyed the apartment.  I would highly recommend his rental to anyone who is looking.  it was very clean and provided everything we needed.

Thanks again!"
4318814,46516733,2015-09-11,42127906,Laurel,Caleb's place was great! Close to where I needed to be for my friends wedding and easy to find. Off street parking was a breeze. When we arrived Caleb gave us a quick tour (we could have just grabbed the keys from the hiding place but really appreciate the welcoming!) Pool table was a huge plus too. As mentioned in other reviews you can hear him and his daughters walking around upstairs but it didn't bother us at all. Would definitely stay again if given the chance. 
4318814,46888372,2015-09-14,15957053,Conor,"Caleb had everything ready for our arrival and the instructions were very clear. This unit feels very private, and despite being ground level, gets excellent light. Water pressure in the shower is very strong, and heats up quickly. Bed is quite comfortable. A large TV has access to Netflix, Amazon, and cable and is of fantastic quality. There are books all around and the whole place feels like it should be featured in a style magazine. The neighborhood offers plenty of parking and easy walking to either the shops on Phinney or on Fremont. Check out the Phinney Market Pub & Eatery for tasty eats and good drinks. "
4318814,48153626,2015-09-23,40233929,Alan,"Top of Phinney Ridge with a View is an incredible find! Caleb and family are a great host and the space is very comfortable. They set out a sheet with everything you may want to know including wifi and use of amenities.  The neighborhood is quiet and is a great place to relax.  Caleb greeted me when I arrived, had some beer in the fridge and even gave some grapes from his arbor. He owns the neighborhood pub which has a great beer selection and good food. Highly recommended. "
4318814,48710195,2015-09-28,31876811,Stephanie,Location is great. There's plenty of parking nearby. The space was better than described. Caleb has some really cool antiques that we enjoyed looking at plus plenty of guitars that we could try. We also played a game of pool. The stay was our last days of vacation so I did laundry. It's a definite bonus that I haven't seen in many other locations. 
4318814,49277983,2015-10-02,37729119,William,"My stay with Caleb was fantastic. Being my first AirBnB experience, I was unsure what to expect, but was delighted by his hospitality upon arrival and the beautifully appointed apartment.  While he assured me that he was a phone call away if I needed anything, I never had to take Caleb up on his offer -   the apartment was well-stocked and clean, and I wasn't going to complain about the flat screen TV or the immaculate pool table.

I found the location to be perfect for my short stay in Seattle.  There a few coffee shops and restaurants within walking distance, while the bus will get you downtown in 30 minutes.  I found it quite nice to spend a day in the city and retreat to the quiet of Phinney Ridge.

I highly recommend this listing!"
4318814,51134662,2015-10-18,42528238,Linda,"The host was very accommodating to a change in my arrival routine, making sure I got in safely. The apt was actually nicer than the photos showed, and all was very nicely appointed and clean."
4318814,51848152,2015-10-24,15121499,Kathryn,Great host! Awesome space in a fantastic location. The view is incredible. Highly recommend!

8921924,55929498,2015-12-07,45618447,Matthew,"Logan greets you with the warmest, biggest smile. The room and her home are clean and warm and cozy. She is super generous and a great conversationalist with a great sense of humor. We had some some fun talks and a couple movie nights. And....if you're lucky, she might let you sample some of her cooking- she's a gourmet chef! Having said that, the house is also set up so that you have your privacy and autonomy. Had a great time! I would definitely stay again."
8921924,57247277,2015-12-23,50693600,Eric,Logan was a great host and the room was cozy. She's very helpful and makes you feel welcomed into her home. Her 2 cats are adorable as well. Overall a great stay and highly recommended. 
1220816,6385669,2013-08-10,7848563,Oren,"Lori and Lane were amazing hosts-- friendly,accommodating, and super generous. Their place is huge, nice, and a total gem for anyone looking to stay in/near Seattle.

Definitely going back next time we're in town!

"
1220816,6526484,2013-08-15,6647061,Anona,"Lori's place was very clean & comfortable, and Lori & Lane were easy-going and welcoming. My friend and I liked the neighborhood because it was home-y and we were able to walk to bars, restaurants, and cafes. I would stay there again! (Also, Lori bakes really great chocolate chip cookies)! "
1220816,6996091,2013-09-02,8074444,Hannah,"Awesome experience! Lori was super friendly and the apartment was great! As clean as can be, spacious and a great location! You are in great hands with her!"
1220816,7076371,2013-09-05,3115177,Shari,"Had a great stay.  We were there for a festival and decided to look for last minute accommodation.  The place was great; it does lack a lounging area.  However this did not impact us at all.  It took about half an hour to get to town but for 2 bucks by bus it was worth it instead of paying for parking.  It took about 20 mins to walk up the hill to the the bus.
Lori was a great host; very friendly."
1220816,7269711,2013-09-13,1236611,Bethany,"This apartment had everything we needed (separate bedroom, full kitchen, laundry) and in a cute neighborhood! Also, unbelievably clean and neat.  The owners are kind and helpful, and went above and beyond to take care of us when we had to check out early. Highly recommend! "
1220816,7385114,2013-09-17,8693406,Joshoah,"The basement apartment is really nice, clean and tidey. The location is spectacular, within a few minutes of Greenwood Ave and some great bars and restaurants. The number 5 bus on Greenwood will get you into downtown very fast. "
1220816,7426204,2013-09-19,5225388,Dean,"What a wonderful stay! It could have been the generous accommodations, the extremely friendly and helpful hosts, or the  hot-out-of-the-oven banana bread with which we were greeted, but never has there been an airbnb experience that felt so much like home. "
1220816,7609229,2013-09-26,8755002,Alexander,"Lori is a cordial host. She was helping a lot with looking around the area and provided all required stuff including toys for a baby.

The basement is cozy and clean, well equipped. Downside is low ceilings and quite fresh climate. The latter can be solved if you ask Lori to turn on house heating system, small heater is also available.

The location is quiet, Freed Mayer store is in walk distance. Park earlier, it may be hard to park in night.

Overall -- I'd recommend the apartment for short stays. Location is perfect!"
1220816,7920568,2013-10-08,7381504,Heidi & John,"My parents stayed with Lori & Lane during their visit to Seattle.  They had a great experience there; a clean quiet apartment with everything they needed.  How lucky we were to find this gem right in our neighborhood, and we will definitely recommend to other family that plan to visit.  Lori and Lane are very accommodating, wonderful hosts!"

I would highly recommend Lori's home.
Thank you Lori for your kindness and for sharing your space with me."

I've already booked this space twice and would book again in a heartbeat. A++"

1220816,12947049,2014-05-15,13150437,Shaw-Jiun,"We stayed with Lori and her wonderful family for two weeks while waiting for our house in Seattle to be ready to move in. The basement apartment was well equipped with kitchen, bath and laundry. Lori is always available for questions and chats and our stay was very pleasant and comfortable for us and our two dogs. Lori was incredibly helpful and even baked us a yummy goodbye banana bread!!
The location of the apartment is within a short walk to lots of cafés and restaurants. It is also within a short drive to Ballard and Greenlake. As a result, we have become very familiar with the wonderful adjacent neighborhoods!"
1220816,13214229,2014-05-22,2274633,Jean,"The apartment was comfortable complete with a full refrigerator, stove, clothes washer and dryer.

My unique situation is that my son, daughter-in-law and 3 year old grandson live 4 1/2 blocks away.

My husband and I chose to spend most of our time in Seattle being entertained by our grandson.  I have been to this neighborhood many times and I know where to eat and what to see.

My stay at Lori's apartment was very comfortable and I WOULD STAY THERE AGAIN when I head from NJ to Seattle to visit Jim and his family.  

Thank you. 
"
1220816,13757043,2014-06-03,12702974,Dave,"Lori had the apt. all ready for me. The neighborhood is great and close to the center of Ballard and Greenwood. From downtown it is about a 15-20 minute drive. The apartment was  clean and the bed is a queen with the other bed directly next to it in the same room. Something to be aware of, if you have multiple couples or children. 
Although most of the aspects of this apartment were fine, I did have a problem with the amount of noise that was generated from the family living in the unit above.  I am a pretty mellow person, however it was a little excessive.  The noise  in this basement apartment can get pretty intense on the ceiling throughout the day due to their living situation (in the morning straight through dinner time, and couple mornings in the 5 am-7:45 am range too).  I was sleeping from the hours of 11 pm - 8 am. A couple times until 9 am. 
If you aren't planning on spending much time in the unit, it should be no big deal, if you are looking for a reasonable amount of tranquility and peace, this may not be the place for you. "
1220816,13902330,2014-06-07,10578389,Andrew,"Lori's place was clean and comfortable. Close to Green Lake and nice restaurants, but plenty traffic into Downtown Seattle."
1220816,13941560,2014-06-08,14054183,Mark,I was only there for a short visit but what interaction we had with Lori and her family was good. Lori was very nice and made sure to tell me more then once if we needed anything do not hesitate to ask. Good neighborhood and place was very clean and cozy. I would definitely stay there again.     
1220816,14419042,2014-06-18,2323023,Bethany,"We rented Lori's place for my parents-in-law while they were visiting us, and everything was as we'd hoped! The apartment was very clean, well-furnished, and the neighborhood was quiet. My in-laws loved all the thoughtful touches that made the apartment feel homey. Lori responded promptly and was wonderful to work with! "
1220816,14744873,2014-06-25,8716259,David,"Lori and Lane were friendly, cheerful and helpful.  "
1220816,14807966,2014-06-26,5961656,Jacob,"Lori was very accommodating with renting her B and B to my co-workers very last minute on Tuesday evening.  My co-workers were raving about how helpful Lori was during their stay, and how great her rental is.  We hope Lori will have us back again some day.  We have stayed at quote a few Airbnb's around Seattle, and this is by far the best! -Jacob"
1220816,15223786,2014-07-05,6313251,Jason,"During our stay we woke up to someone in the apartment which made us uncomfortable. It was probably an honest mistake but it didn't seem right that such a reviewed place would have people not knowing when there were guests downstairs. 

To Lori's credit, she was very apologetic and really wanted to make things right for us and we worked something out. I would say her communication is the only reason we didn't leave the same day. 

The apartment itself was in a great location and gave us quick access to the best of the area. Aside from the one incident it was comfortable and quiet. "
1220816,15580496,2014-07-12,15931936,Jeffrey,"Very positive experience.  I was travelling with my family including 2 kids ages 4 and 8.  We wanted a quiet residential place to sleep with a full kitchen to cook some meals.  The basement apartment was a little bit smaller than we anticipated, but worked out just fine.  "
1220816,15646131,2014-07-13,17273464,Edna,"Lori was very good to work with in arranging our stay.  Answered all my questions (I had lots - it was my first Airbnb stay).  She made the whole process go smoothly.   I wasn't as good at communicating and responding to Lori's emails, due to my being gone on vacation and not having cell coverage at times and no access to email at times.  We loved the apartment space, very comfortable - worked well for the three of us.  Exactly as shown in the photos.  Seemed to be in a great neighborhood - would love to stay here again for longer than one night and get to experience the shops and restaurants that are close by. "
1220816,15711852,2014-07-14,5078672,New,A pleasant and painless experience. Nice neighborhood and nice people.
1220816,15871929,2014-07-17,16355041,Konni,"Lori was always very helpful. The apartment is very cute, comfortable, and clean. I loved having a full-size refrigerator! There were plenty of plugs, too! We felt very safe in this neighborhood. Parking can be a little competitive, but the cross street seemed to have plenty of parking. We didn't get to try the little cafe down the street, but we noticed it opened before 7 am and stayed open late. "
1220816,16104640,2014-07-22,832287,John And Kathleen,Lori's Apt was perfect for us.  We were in Seattle visiting our son and his family and this apartment served as our get away in the evening.   It is perfect for 2 people or for a young family with small children.  The neighborhood is quiet and in a great location near Green Lake.  On street parking is available or public transportation is near by.   The Kitchen is well stocked with normal consumables.  The apt is very clean and Lori is a terrific host.  
1220816,16250477,2014-07-24,198756,Carolyn,"Great apartment for a visit to Seattle. For our visit, we were 2 adults and 2 kids. Lori left the apartment very attractive and with a great scented aroma. We arrived late and she left the light on for us, literally, making it an easy landing. She gave us lots of recommendations of restaurants and places to check out. We biked to Carkeek park (one of Lori's recommendations) and had a great time on the beach. We stored 3 bikes outside there and had no issue. Lori was also nice enough to let us park in her driveway when we had a mishap with our car. And last but not least, I accidentally left my fitness bracelet and she found it an mailed it to me. We really appreciated Lori's flexibility and consideration. "
1220816,16565711,2014-07-29,3096571,Raul,"Lori was super helpful through the whole AirBnB process. I definitely lagged booking a place to stay, and she was able to approve my request within a matter of hours! Lori was always one step ahead of me too, she provided clear instructions on the location, and lock box code, wifi password, the whole shebang! 

The location/neighborhood was just as described, and the apartment had everything you need for a 5 day/4 night stay! I loved how quiet the neighborhood was at night and in the morning, we never had any issues finding parking for our rental car, and it was super close to the 99 for quick access into and out of downtown."
1220816,16852213,2014-08-03,8652962,Jennifer,"We had a really great experience during out stay at Lori's rental space. The basement apartment was very clean, spacious, and comfortable.  Lori was always quick to respond to my messages and also quickly refunded me part of my fee after I told her that one of our friends was not able to make the trip last minute.  While the house is not super close walking distance to all the Ballard area shops and restaurants, it was very close and it was really easy and quick to jump down to the various areas of Portland. I did walk to Neptune coffee one morning and it was a nice walk. 
I would definitely stay here again when I return to Seattle. "
1220816,17569295,2014-08-14,8802832,Michael,"We enjoyed our stay in Lori's apartment. The unit is clean and spacious. The neighborhood is very quiet. It's a convenient drive to downtown or neighborhoods such as Ballard and Fremont. Bus stop is two blocks away to head to downtown area, also."
1220816,18124235,2014-08-22,10202484,Lasaan,"Lori was so very personable and most helpful upon our arrival!  She ensured my arrival via text and followed up with a call but the greatest experience was her above and beyond offer m to follow me to drop off my rented car and dropping me back to her place...truly the Seattle (customer experience) that I'm used to and had hoped for!  The area is really cool with lots of shops along Greenwood, very walkable and super short distance to several coffee shops, grocery stores, restaurants and lots more.  

The living accommodation was intimate, clean yet spacious with internet and cable.  You need to know that there is a little one above your head so you should expect little feet tapping and thumping above you in the mornings (not a problem for us). Lori and her family was not seen unless asked for and super accommodating and helpful (starting the gas grill, cleaning up a spill, etc). I will for sure look to return to this location when visiting home again."
1220816,18326705,2014-08-25,4123684,Theodore,"One of the most incredible set ups I have had the privilege of using. Very efficient and smart way of allowing you to have access to all and your privacy. Spacious and amazing bed set up, a couch as well as a tv with more dvds than you could possibly need. She has left notes all over so you are never in doubt where things are located. Truly the photos do not give it justice. Lori is very thoughtful, considerate and always in communication for your needs. If ever in the area of Ballard will always want to stay at her set up."
1220816,18729589,2014-08-31,394104,Shelly,"Lori was a wonderful host, very responsive and accommodating. Our train arrived very late and she was kind enough to leave a light on when we finally stumbled in at 6 AM. 

As for the apartment - it was very clean and spacious! We were close to Ballard and all our favorite destinations. I especially loved having a kitchen and access to a fridge, that's a luxury when traveling. 

The parking could be tricky, but spots are normally available along the street. My only recommendation would be for visitors with rentals, get a compact car. The smaller the better! :-) 
"
1220816,18998921,2014-09-04,15875167,Pipo,"Lori was very attentive, and the place is neat! The second bed is on a platform above the first bed, so it's a little like being in a boat or tree house. Really nice remodeled bathroom/shower. Sweet neighborhood that's convenient to both Greenwood and Ballard."
1220816,19641354,2014-09-15,10797483,Rajiv,"The space was perfect for my needs. Easy street parking, all the amenities of home. Though I rented for about 10 days, I only ended up staying there for 3 days because of emergent work travel. But they were 3 very comfortable days. At the end I realized I was definitely not going to return because my home was available and Lori was gracious enough to refund me for the last night. "
1220816,19909712,2014-09-20,21293274,Esia,"My stay with Lori and Lane was great. Access was easy, there are notes for everything you need or can think of.  There is a map, dining suggestions, DVDs, wifi, board games. The place was super (super) clean, comfy, spacious and felt like home."
1220816,20061475,2014-09-22,3889643,Paul,"Great little apartment! Clean and well appointed, with nice little touches. Thanks!"
1220816,20311616,2014-09-27,19659117,Jenna,"This location is a great place for someone looking for a cozy space to themselves. The kitchen is fully equipped, the bathroom was modern, and the bedroom has an impressive selection of movies to accompany the tv. The one drawback  is that the walls are somewhat thin, but if the ""pitter-patter"" of tiny feet doesn't bother you, you're good to go."
1220816,20540478,2014-09-30,20378582,Daniel,"Lori was able to accommodate us on very short notice. She was flexible on check in time and the apartment was cleaned and prepared for us.

The location is approximately 2 miles from bars in Ballard, which if you are not interested in walking will only cost 10 bucks by cab. 

The apartment adequately accommodated the three of us. We each had our own mattress to sleep on and were able to leave at will without disturbing Lori or her family."
1220816,21325435,2014-10-14,22264828,Kelly,"We had a great time in Seattle partly due to the home- style comfort provided at the residence and the neighborhood which was quiet and close to  shops, restaurants and bus stops.  The space was clean and open, and offered plenty of privacy.  The kitchen area is a bit cool, but the bedroom is toasty warm and the beds soft - I would definitely recommend this listing to others as a nice choice for staying in the city!"
1220816,22278977,2014-11-02,574608,Amanda,It was a great experience. Lori and her family are sweet and wonderful! The space is clean and convenient and cozy. The neighborhood is great also. We had a wonderful time!
1220816,25058839,2015-01-05,3126474,Shivaun,"We had a great stay in Seattle thanks to Lori! The space is a very nice lower-level apartment in a single-family home with its own (private) entry and includes a well-appointed kitchen (with basic dishes, silverware, glasses, etc!) bath, and bedroom. The bedroom itself is set up almost like its own studio apartment, half bedroom and half living room! There are notes from Lori around the space on the wi-fi password, how to use the TV remotes, etc. that we found really helpful and we were really glad to have them so we wouldn't pester our hosts! We really appreciated how much Lori respected our privacy and space. Additionally, we were very grateful that when we discovered we needed to leave a day early, Lori offered to refund us for the last day even though we were fully prepared to pay it! This was my first AirBnB experience, and I couldn't be happier!"
1220816,25384545,2015-01-14,24375780,Matthew,"Lori and her family were friendly, inviting and helpful.  The apartment was clean and comfortable, had an excellent noise machine and fan, lots of movies and all the basic kitchen needs.  The privacy factor was also excellent.  As others have mentioned, there is a little one above that runs around a lot.  It didn't bother us in the slightest, and generally brought a smile to our faces.  Can't think of a single negative thing to say here.  I would happily suggest this option.  - If you are unfamiliar with the area, there are plenty of restaurants, groceries, coffee shops, etc... All you would ever need.  "
1220816,25686408,2015-01-23,24406344,Sarah,The space was very comfortable for our stay in Seattle.  Lori was very quick to answer any of our questions and make sure that we had everything that we needed.  Will definitely stay again should my travels bring me through the Emerald City:)  
1220816,26709528,2015-02-17,21059392,Jesse,"Stayed there in a group of three. Great experience. Host was gracious and communicative by email, key transfer was a breeze. Unit was good, nice new fixtures in bathroom, easy to control temperature in every room, beds were very comfortable, big fridge. All in all, perfect for our needs. Walking distance to good selection of restaurants, coffee shops, lake, park, etc."
1220816,28140860,2015-03-18,28593213,Mark,"We booked this rental as our first Airbnb experience. Communication with Lori was quick and clear. The basement apartment was very much as advertised: clean, comfortable, well equipped, and a convenient separate entrance. The neighborhood is quiet. We were always able to find nearby street parking.

It appealed to us because it was very close to where we needed to be. It may seem out of the way, but it's easy to hop on 99 or I-5. I think it took me 10 minutes to get to the University. The airport is 25 minutes, barring traffic. A large grocery store is a short walk.

Maybe important to know: The main bed is quite soft. You can control the heat in the bedroom; the kitchen and bathroom were fairly cool, so we kept the bedroom door open to warm them up a bit. Yes, there is a toddler running around upstairs, but I'm a very light sleeper and it was never a problem for me.

I have already recommended this rental to some friends of ours, and I would gladly stay here again on our next trip to Seattle."
1220816,28402271,2015-03-23,27870162,Christine,"Lori is AMAZING!! She welcomed me right away and even helped me bring my bags in. Her home was spotless and so tastefully decorated I felt at home right away. The rooms were just as I expected from her description and the location was PERFECT in every way!! I got to everything I needed in towndown Seattle including Pike Place Market and Pioneer Square in no time and really had a fantastic visit. 

Lori is kind, helpful, informative, and knowledgable about the area and even sent me to a great little restaurant down the street when I was looking for a hearty breakfast. She understood my desire to find something that wasn't touristy and the food was delish!!

I have been recomnmending Lori's Airbnb to everyone I know!! "
1220816,28508338,2015-03-24,18515778,Kevin,Lori was nice. She welcomed us to her house. She let us know she was there should we need anything. Her rooms were very clean and every detail was taken care of. I would definitely stay here again.
1220816,28731391,2015-03-29,20991440,Justin,Fantastic space! Great amenities! Very friendly host! Wonderful location! Take advantage of this rental before it fills up!
1220816,29329755,2015-04-06,29064226,Frances,"Very pleasant safe neighborhood, close to coffee shops and stores and transportation. It was convenient set up for checking in and out, with key access in box and private entrance. The apartment was very comfortable and very clean. "
1220816,30865588,2015-04-28,22342976,Alice,"The apartment was easy to find, very clean, well equiped,  and just as described.  The neighborhood is residential, but a short (10 minute) walk from many restaurants and shops, and was ideal for us, as it was located between and just a few blocks from each of our children's homes.  There are also buses nearby to go downtown, however, we had a car.  Lori was welcoming, addressing any issues quickly.  Our only quibble was that the bed, while a very good mattress, was much to soft for our tastes.  (We like very firm mattresses.)  Lori added a board, which helped somewhat."
1220816,32083835,2015-05-13,16212311,Shannon,"My husband and I stayed for a week while we were resettling in Seattle. The basement apartment offered everything we needed for cooking, had plenty of space, good internet, easy access to bus lines.  Ceilings are somewhat low (being a basement), so be aware if you are tall. Lori and the family were very accommodating and welcoming!"
1220816,33138990,2015-05-25,346160,Brandi,"This was a lovely space that exceeded expectations. Lori and her family were warm and welcoming. The location is central and made it easy to get anywhere we went. I highly recommend this place, especially families."
2412633,10767789,2014-03-06,10642852,Isaac,"Our stay in Seattle was great!  Katherine's apartment was clean, cozy, and was very close to the U Village, and just a short bus ride to the U District.  The bed was very comfortable, and there was plenty of towels.  I will definatly try to stay at Katherine's apartment the next time I travel to Seattle, and would highly recommend it to someone looking for a comfortable place to stay in Seattle, without the insane hotel prices!"
2412633,11059044,2014-03-18,6916012,Cynthia,Katie made things very easy and this was a very nice and convenient place to stay. I would definitely recommend staying here!
2412633,11157379,2014-03-23,7011644,Rachel,We had a great time staying at Katherine's place! It was clean and cozy and the perfect size for my husband and toddler. Katherine was friendly and always easy to reach. The only slight issue was occasional noise from some of the neighbors but it never kept us up at night. Hope to stay there again!
2412633,15089726,2014-07-02,12052623,John,"This is the perfect place to stay.  Clean, comfortable, well-appointed condo very close to public transportation, Met Market, UW, U Village, and the Burke-Gilman Trail.  Katie is very easy to work with and we look forward to staying at her place again."
2412633,15345227,2014-07-07,1479756,Cindy,"I had a comfortable 2 night stay with my twelve year old brother at Katie's place. The place was clean and the bed was very comfy. Katie was also very friendly,  responsive and made an effort to speak to me a few times before our stay. We were informed that the place and plumbing is on the older side but we had no issues. I actually thought water pressure was great!  And while I know it's out of the owner's control, I found parking to be a little tricky. The place was located on a narrow one way lane and I had to park down the street because I couldn't find a spot in front of the house. Not a huge issue, but it did make loading and unloading a little more difficult. Overall, we had a very comfortable stay and would come back! Thanks! :)"
2412633,15645120,2014-07-13,676850,Kate,"Katie was travelling at the time of our arrival but her friend Lindsey was very welcoming (she even gave us advice on running trails and places to eat!). The apartment was incredibly clean, true to the posted pictures, very close to the Burke Gilman, and a short ride to University of Washington campus (bus stop one black from apartment). I highly recommend this apartment, especially for persons visiting UW.  I would definitely stay here again. "
2412633,15908419,2014-07-18,15030781,Kurtis (KC),"Katherine's condo is in an excellent location, and is comfortable, quiet, and clean.  We very much enjoyed our stay there and would definitely stay again.  She was also extremely prompt in communication.  This was my first AirBnB rental, so I was a bit unsure on how the process would work.  Neither Katherine, or an associate of hers who helped, missed a communication time by even a minute.  I was quite impressed and they made me feel way more comfortable with the overall process."
2412633,16124749,2014-07-22,12888333,Joanna,"Katherine's space is absolutely more stunning than the pictures! . Although we never got to meet Katherine,the check-in and check-out procedure were super simple and our questions were answered in a timely matter. The space itself was very spacious for two people. The kitchen was fully stocked with all the cookware we needed to make meals. The kitchen was also stocked with a dishwasher, which was convenient. The washroom was clean and there was enough linen provided to last us the three days we were there. We never used the laundry, but it is provided with the listing. The bedroom was spacious and had a super comfy queen sized bed with bedding. There was also a great entertainment system :) Overall, Katherine's place was great. We will definitely stay again if we're in Seattle!

2412633,26138412,2015-02-04,26443148,James,"Clean and bright apartment, with plenty of room and all the amenities. Excellent location -- close to University of Washington, Lake Washington and the shops and restaurants of University Village. Highly recommended."
2412633,37753208,2015-07-10,25914123,Joyce,The host canceled this reservation 136 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
2412633,47810829,2015-09-21,26443148,James,"The condo is very quiet, clean and convenient, located alongside a lengthy biking and jogging trail and close to the U of Washington and a well stocked, upscale supermarket. Parking on the street is also available. Highly recommended."
2412633,48904229,2015-09-29,14563601,Richard,"Katie was very friendly and timely with responses to any questions or concerns about the stay.  The location of the condo was excellent, close to downtown, I-5 (Boeing factory tour, whale watching, etc.), U-Dub, the University Mall (free charging for vehicles in SE corner, level D, southwest ramp), grocery stores and right on the Burke-Gilman trail for walking, running & biking.  Very clean with bamboo floors, granite countertop, light carpet upstairs.  Bed was very comfortable.  Our concerns about the availability of on street parking near the condo were unfounded,  spaces usually available right in front of condo, pull into drive to load/unload, park on street.   Ample space in closet and refrigerator, we traveled too ""heavy"" and appreciated the room.  We stayed for 8 days,  a very nice place to live while visiting the area.  "
8227038,47116626,2015-09-15,33303244,Emma,"Satadru was easy to communicate with. The studio was clean. Satadru kindly provided cola and coffee. When balcony doors were open traffic and train noise was loud, but ok when closed. Is an open plan studio so needed ear plugs as fridge was loud. No noise from neighbours. Comfortable sofa. No TV or kettle. Great location for exploring Seattle."
8227038,47828006,2015-09-21,31678692,Melissa,"The apartment was very clean and in a great location near downtown, bars and restaurants, and with a great view of the water. Satadru was very accommodating of our late check in as well. "
8227038,47860885,2015-09-21,1617927,Brent,"Satadru's place was fantastic. The apartment was very clean. The view was stunning and it's located right in front of the Seattle Sculpture Garden, which is a serene place to walk and enjoy public art. 

Satadru made accessing the place very easy and left detailed instructions to assist with my stay. All of my correspondence with him was well address and all responses were timely. I'd be delighted to stay here again. "
8227038,48772645,2015-09-28,15189673,Megan,Overall it was a great stay! The apartment was in a convenient location with a wonderful view of the water. Satadru made the check in/check out process really easy. We'll definitely be contacting Satadru again if we head back to Seattle. 
2339333,36528392,2015-06-29,25377815,Jeffrey,"Dirk's family home was really lovely.  It was the perfect accommodations for our family gathering.  Lots of space, great kitchen and wonderful outside gathering space.  We spent most of our time on the deck, where there is a terrific grill set up.  We also got a chance to enjoy the HUGE Jacuzzi tub in the downstairs bedroom while the rest of the family took advantage of the two large living room room spaces (one downstairs and one upstairs).  This place is very family friendly and has everything you need for a great stay.  Thanks Dirk!"
2339333,37554444,2015-07-08,29453591,Mary,"We enjoyed our first trip with 8 adults to Seattle to attend a wedding held partially at a green lake house  and also in the warehouse district for the actual ceremony.We found the neighborhood we rented in  was very nice and it was a good location to be in for Seattle. We were close by to a few stores ..Walgreens and the Foodstore was a few blocks away.    We did have a car but my son and girlfriend  took the bus often to get  around to green lake,  downtown and Discovery Park.  He said it was very easy and inexpensive.  The owner Dirk provided some nice things such as coffee and soaps and shampoos  and paper products for the bathrooms which we did not expect .  The house fit our needs wonderfully with four nice bedrooms with queen or larger beds and fans were also provided for the bedrooms since when  we arrived in a Seattlethere was a heat wave 90 % every day.   We were traveling with 8 adults so all the rooms and bathrooms got used daily. They were all quite nice.     We got great use out of the kitchen and back porch that had a grill and large table to enjoy breakfasts and a few dinners. The yard was lovely and private.   We really enjoyed the house and would recommend it highly.  We even used the washer and dryer several times and were thrilled to get to try the jura  expresso machine which we became quite addicted to. Thank you for a wonderful stay!  We enjoyed seeing and attending a Seattle family wedding with our family and even  got some free time to explore the city.   We topped off the whole wedding week with a whale watch trip  off  san juan island,  friday harbor to see the orcas!  It was a great trip and we luckily saw about 25 orcas breaching!  We look forward to our return to this fun city!   "
2339333,38273845,2015-07-14,8181528,Sarah,"What a wonderful stay at a great home! Five of us were in Seattle for a week, recording a new album, and needed a quiet, comfortable, spacious place to rest and (email hidden)e home was clean, private, large, light-filled, and so comfortable! The neighborhood was also lovely--the Ballard/Phinney area is very village-like, it's easy to walk to great restaurants and shops, but also a quick drive to the rest of Seattle and beyond. We were greeted with a helpful binder of information, fresh flowers, extra coffee and cream and a few goodies in the fridge. The kitchen was well-stocked. The bedrooms were large and comfortable. The whole experience was excellent! My best Air B n B stay yet!! Thank you, Dirk. Five stars indeed. Cheers...-Sarah"
2339333,38665666,2015-07-17,38164158,Damian,"Dirk and his family have a wonderful and lovely home.  Great for families for a corporate work week.  Very accessible for getting around and close to Ballard stores, restaurants and bars.

The process was smooth and Dirk was quite timely with communications and coordination.

Don't ask questions.  Get this house if it's available.

Cheers,
Damian "
2339333,39155746,2015-07-21,4134523,Meg,"We highly recommend the home. It is spacious, tastefully done, warm family atmosphere and in a great location."
2339333,40075341,2015-07-28,4981266,Elliot,The host was very responsive to my emails. He even gave us entrance instructions early which we really appreciated. The house was beautiful and exactly how it was described and pictured. They live in a great area with tons of stuff in walking distance and buses everywhere for the other stuff. 
4567243,24856835,2015-01-03,24122204,Victoria,"Andrew was a fantastic host during our stay in Seattle. While we never met face to face, Andrew made sure to communicate with us whenever we had questions, concerns, comments, etc. We were even able to book an extra day last minute with no hassle, which was a huge relief to me and my spouse. 

The space itself was/is BEAUTIFUL! As stated, the inside was renovated and was extremely charming. Everything was fully clean functional and made our stay even more relaxing. The space was large enough to accommodate dinner guests on a few occasions which was a nice bonus. The home is conveniently located and the surrounding area gave us plenty to do. 

I highly recommend this place to anyone considering visiting Seattle. I would not hesitate to return in the near future. Thank you Andrew for the wonderful, affordable space!

"
4567243,57671166,2015-12-28,43598735,Caitlin,This is a cute place located in northern Seattle. We had great communication from Andrew and really felt like we were visiting a friend's home. We will definitely use the home again if it is available for future trips.
9281758,57943169,2015-12-30,38744379,Jonathan,"Mackenzie was great, very communicative and helpful with anything we needed. The unit was also amazing, super clean and comfortable and spacious. Parking was a huge plus compared to other listings we were looking at, and another bonus is the fact that there's a Safeway next door. The place is also furnished to have everything you could need, and more. Would definitely stay here again, thanks Mackenzie!"
9281758,58716941,2016-01-03,43056443,Molly,Mackenzie was a great host and the apartment was everything it appeared to be in the pictures! Great location to everything you could possibly need. I'd do it again in a heartbeat!
3986788,38973822,2015-07-19,1737732,Bethany,"Pauline was an exceptional host, and knows how to provide the perfect experience. She has a great attention to detail, which is evident from the moment you arrive. She provides a key box outside the unit, which allowed for us to enter and get settled without having to worry about waking anyone up. There were instructions laid out clearly on the counter as well as an extra key to use during the stay. The place was CLEAN! The bed was so comfortable and the sheets were very nice. I loved the Robes available in the bathrooms even though we didnt use them. Very nice touch. The Kitchen had everything we needed, although I didn't end up cooking, I could see this being a really nice option for longer stays. We went to Endolyne Joe's for dinner, and I would totally recommend- its literally a few blocks away. There was a cute patio set up outside as well for our morning coffee. I really enjoyed all the lovely flowers and garden. Perfect location, couldnt have asked for a better spot. Pauline and Beau were also wonderful. She communicated right away and send me special directions to her place. I felt welcome and at home from the moment I arrived. Her Fauntleroy Cove is a West Seattle gem!! "
3986788,41898703,2015-08-09,33696024,Audrey,"Cute and well cared for little place, great location for being out of inner city but close enough to enjoy downtown. Parking is off street but very tight for an SUV. Make sure and use google maps street view to familiarize yourself with the road and drive way to the house if you arrive in the dark. Highly recommend for a short stay. We did discover that fighting raccoons came out one night,.. You don't get that experience in the inner city "
3986788,42324895,2015-08-12,21385708,Michael,"Beautiful place, close to marina and Fauntleroy ferry. Pauline was very friendly and accommodating. "
3986788,43656162,2015-08-21,36749027,Lea,"Clean, spacious, and very convenient location. Directions made it easy to find and access. Apartment is in a quite location and within walking distance to Lincoln Park. A nice feature for those with children or others wanting to take a long beach walk."
3986788,54050564,2015-11-15,44668247,Candice,Pauline was very warm and welcoming. The home was spotless as I walked in. She was very understanding with the changes I had to make. Thank you for a friendly experience.
3986788,56379494,2015-12-13,1619148,Deane,"My wife and I stayed during winter for a week and a half, and found the entire process effortless and supremely comfortable.  We drove a very large Ford Expedition and had no trouble whatsoever parking in our own off-street space.  We arrived late at night, and really appreciated the exterior lighting and the toasty warm apartment.

The furnishings, towels and linens are extremely high quality, the shower gets very hot quickly and has great water pressure, and the gas stove, quality knives and cookware were a pleasure to use.  The clothes washer and dryer have a large capacity, and both complete a load on regular cotton settings in under an hour.  The neighborhood is high class, very safe, and very quiet.  We slept quite well in the comfortable bed, thanks especially to a selection of very nice pillows.  The wifi internet reaches all corners of the apartment, at speeds of at least 30Mbps.

The attention to detail is excellent.  For example, much of the floor is an attractive tile, and comfy disposable slippers were provided so we did not need to wear socks (or shoes) to keep our feet warm.  Pauline and this apartment are an unbeatable combination, and we would love to stay here again!
"
2525172,12035018,2014-04-21,11675082,Robin,"We spent 2 nights the Hermitage and really enjoyed the experience.  The neighbourhood has a lot of interesting places to eat, vintage shops, bars and such within walking distance.  The room is reasonably priced and was as described, with a private entrance and bathroom.  I would stay here again.  No tv in the room, but we didn't need one, so no loss there."
2525172,12197027,2014-04-25,1351774,Barbara,"Jeannette was a great host! She was very timely in her responses to our last minute booking. The room is small, but was private and perfect for our two day stay since we planned on being out and about in Seattle for most of our trip. The location is within just a few blocks of restaurants, shops and the infamous Troll. My boyfriend and I had a car and found nearby parking easy. We would definitely stay at the Hermitage again!"
2525172,12307913,2014-04-28,14335658,Mian,"My stay at The Hermitage was exactly what I needed: Quiet, private, clean and safe. And affordable! I met Ned as I arrived, Jeannette as I was leaving (both briefly, and communicated by a note left on the stairwell when I needed something (and got a prompt reply). The space is bright, airy and surrounded by trees. I never had trouble with parking (was provided with a pass for neighborhood street parking). I never had to remember a key because they provide a very easily remembered personal passcode. The location is perfect, right in the heart of Fremont where, if you didn't need to venture elsewhere, you would never have to leave. Restaurants, coffee shops, bookstores, antiques, art, adventure are around every corner in what is known as the Center of the Known Universe. I will keep this spot in mind whenever I need a little Seattle getaway and recommend it HIGHLY to any and all who seek the same. Thanks Jeannette and Ned!"
2525172,12519733,2014-05-04,11302098,Brynn,"Our stay at The Hermitage was perfect for our needs. We needed a cozy place to crash and keep our stuff and this gave us just that- plus a cute little outdoor table, privacy, and a great location. We easily walked to a number of restaurants and the bike trail is just down the road. Jeanette and Ned were so kind to let us keep our bikes inside and we felt safe and at home in the Hermitage. Sorry we didn't get to spend more time, Jeanette and Ned! You seem like such kind people and we would've loved chatting. Thank you for accommodating our last minute request! "
2525172,12647727,2014-05-06,277071,Justin,"My wife and I had a wonderful time at the Hermitage.  We were not able to plan very far ahead and hence had to make a last minute reservation with Jeanette and Ned.  They were very accommodating and helpful.  Upon arrival they helped us in and gave us some good suggestions for local eats and entertainment.  I really appreciate the keyless entry (you get a door code) and wish that was listed in the amenities section of AirBnB.  The location is incredible, you're literally a few blocks from Fremont's main street.  We'd be delighted to stay here again and will definitely recommend it to friends. "
2525172,12766239,2014-05-10,15064522,Pim,"We enjoyed our three nights stay in the Hermitage very much. The room was - though small - large enough to feel comfortable. We especially enjoyed the small patio-garden, in which we drank our evening wine. Also the direct neighbourhood (Fremont) is an exciting area with nice little restaurants, breakfast-café's and the like. We would recommand our friends to stay at the Hermitage would they consider the far journey from Amsterdam to Seattle. And Jeanette and Ned are perfect hosts too!

The patio, although we didn't use, would be a perfect spot to hang and have coffee, tea etc in the mornings. Loved the shower and the location! My boyfriend and I spent a lot of time exploring Ballard and fremont. We enjoyed the troll under the bridge, literally a couple blocks away and we found ourselves there after out nights out just chatting and enjoying the sights. The location is safe! I'm from Seattle and can definitely say it's a really fun part of the city. Located by fun bars, easy transit to most areas of the city and great food. I felt very comfortable there and although I didn't get to meet Jeanette, I did meet Ned briefly and he was very friendly and nice. I would text them for advice on places to eat etc and they replied always very quickly. Apon our arrival they were very welcoming! I would definitely stay here again and recommend it to anyone! Thank you!!!! :)"
2525172,13190824,2014-05-21,14767046,Jack,"Great place to stay and enjoy one of the best cities and neighborhoods in the world. Jeanette and Ned were very kind and considerate and easy to talk to.  Great hosts, really.  Small room but very nice and private, great private bathroom."
2525172,13375568,2014-05-26,15317316,Brent,"I had a fantastic stay! The room was incredibly clean and stocked with helpful touring books. The Hermitage is nestled in the lovely neighborhood of Fremont, very close to the Fremont troll. A few steps away from the bus to downtown Seattle. I spent most of my time exploring the cascades. The mountains and hikes are breathtaking! Planning on returning!"
2525172,13484616,2014-05-28,3157653,Jocelyn,It was a really comfortable stay. We were out and about most of the time but it was a cozy place to come back and relax in. It was close to transit which was awesome as well. 
2525172,13553914,2014-05-30,15620064,Sonja,Der Aufenthalt war sehr angenehm. Die Bushaltestelle ist gleich in der Nähe. Das Badezimmer ist super. Wir empfehlen die Einsiedelei weiter
2525172,13667743,2014-06-02,14042762,Lynn,Jeanette and Ted were great! Perfect location and very comfortable with everything I needed. Short walk to Main Street for activities and restaurants. Would stay again. 
2525172,14131220,2014-06-12,239766,Nat,"a great place to stay! you can expect all the goodies:- quiet neighborhood, very clean, private bath, next to food/restaurants, keycode access, real bed, microwave, quick responsive host, etc... "
2525172,14686186,2014-06-24,753688,Michael,"The Hermitage was exactly what I needed for my almost two-week stay in Seattle. It's very close to Nalanda West, where I was participating in a Buddhist Retreat, and to the heart of the Fremont district with all its restaurants and shops. Having a private room with attached private bathroom was fantastic. I wasn't there much during the day so was not able to take advantage of the beautiful patio/garden outside the room. I didn't need any help from Ned & Jeanette but I'm sure they would have provided it. I hope to stay at the Hermitage again!"
2525172,15685146,2014-07-14,10843562,Jenn,"Jeanette and Ned had the perfect airbnb pad! The private bedroom is quite comfortable and comes with an attached bathroom and outdoor seating area. Everything was clean and very comfortable, and we loved the keyless entry. Though Ned and Jeanette were out of town, they were great hosts. They communicated everything we needed to know beforehand and left lots of maps and information. The best part of this place was location. The hermitage is a two minute walk from tons of bus lines that went downtown, and about a three minute walk from the heart of Fremont. We loved it!"
2525172,15841703,2014-07-16,447674,Vanessa,The Hermitage was the perfect place to stay for my trip. Conveniently located to both transportation and local sights. Jeannette and Ned provided everything you could possibly want or need within the space. Definitely would recommend staying here if you find yourself heading to Seattle. 
2525172,16248273,2014-07-24,15359302,Shimin,"Ned is really a nice host. Unfortunately,  we didn't meet Jeanette in our 7 day's trip. The private bedroom is quite comfortable and comes with an attached bathroom and outdoor seating area. The keyless entry system is very convenient, and you just need a code to unlock it, which they will give to you before you come. 
The location of the Hermitage is very good. It is only a two minute walk from tons of bus lines that went downtown, and about a three minute walk from the heart of Fremont. 
If I have to say some deficiency, there's no table and chair in the bedroom for you to use the laptop comfortably. And the cute cat, Beau, does not seem to like me and my girlfriend~"
2525172,16462908,2014-07-28,15519444,Wynne,"Our communication with Jeanette and Ned prior to our arrival met our needs completely.  We wished privacy, except for their amazing cat Beau visits, and that was honored.  The location was outstanding as was the room; very clean and cozy."
2525172,17821476,2014-08-18,14905673,Jennifer,"We really enjoyed our stay at The Hermitage. We were there for 4 nights before heading on a cruise. Our room was very clean and cozy. The location was wonderful, so convenient to transit. The keyless entry was also nice. We would definitely love to stay here again if we are in the Seattle area and would highly recommend The Hermitage for anyone looking for a nice place to stay in the city. "
2525172,18064506,2014-08-21,11767396,Isaiah,"The Hermitage was exactly what we needed. It is an urban escape into a cozy, warm and inviting living space. The room has a door which keads to the garden, which is well kept, my partner and I had tea or coffee every irnign before we explored Seattle. Sadly my partner and I never ran into Ned or Jeanette, we always rose early to explore and stayed out late (The Hermitage has a dial pad entry, a fabulous perk; getting in and out was quick and quiet). However, they were in contact with us via phone and were very accommodating. The neighborhood is excellent, I'm not a big tourist-trap person and enjoy being where the city folk stay and Fremont absolutely provided that.
The cat really liked us and would wait at night for us to pet him. Our stay in Seattle was lovely and we enjoyed seeing your city, especially from the park. "
2525172,18246179,2014-08-24,15146741,Sarah,"The hosts very kindly let my parents stay there when my plans changed, which was really nice.  I did drop by and visit them, and they were happy with the arrangements. They said:
The location couldn't be beat, close to everything in Fremont but quiet, and the backyard area was adorable. The room was clean and cozy. 
"
2525172,18422849,2014-08-26,18830334,Marianne,"The hosts checked in right away to see if our accommodations were comfortable, which they were. They provided microwave and a small fridge at our request. The rooms were spotless, and we so appreciated the coffee maker and fresh ground coffee, a symbol of really being in Seattle. The neighborhood is surprisingly quiet, allowing a very sound sleep.  Since we were gone all day both days, we enjoyed having our own way for coming and leaving. We hesitate to say too much about this wonderful hideaway for fear of competition for dates!!"
2525172,18584848,2014-08-28,10568427,Moritz,We arrived quite late and were welcomed warmly. Even though the room was small it was prefect because we had our own bathroom as well as a little part of the garden where we could have lunch perfectly. The hosts even offered us to use a camping refrigerator and a microwave. The way to the city centre does not take more then 20 minutes by bus.
2525172,18939517,2014-09-03,16268518,Karen,"My boyfriend and I loved the Hermitage, and we were so glad to be staying in this absolutely adorable home and district so close to Seattle.  The transit was nearby and convenient, and we enjoyed a lot of privacy! Plus Beau the Hermitage cat warmed up to us at the very end, and I loved that, as a cat person. We would definitely stay again!"
2525172,19124763,2014-09-07,16613662,Clare & Adam,"This place is a great value if you are looking for a clean place to sleep while you are out and about most of the day. The neighbourhood is really cute and is a bus ride away from downtown Seattle and not too far from Ballard, which also a great neighbourhood with lots of bars, restaurants and shops.
An added bonus is daily visits from Beau, the hermitage cat. What a sweet boy!"
2525172,19517285,2014-09-14,17345738,Ina,"Great bright clean space… nice room with direct access to an outdoor deck where one can sit and have coffee…but the most spectacular part of this space is the beautiful bathroom with soaker tub. Super quiet, easy street parking. A quick walk down the street and you're in the Freemont neighbourhood. Jeannette and Ned have lots of books re sightseeing in the area as well as Seattle that are in the room. It was lovely to have my own microwave and small fridge and lots of privacy. I appreciated J+N checking in with me to see if I needed anything…and they were quick to provide me with an extra blanket when requested. Thanks for a great stay :) "
2525172,20140713,2014-09-24,18323133,Meg,"At the Hermitage, I felt at home. The area welcomed my friend and I cheerfully with it's bright,  natural light and soft yellow walls. The space is a bit cozy for two people, but meets all needs above and beyond. I was especially grateful for the amazing bathroom, the empty closet storage space, and the in-room coffee pot. I enjoyed quiet mornings reading in the private patio garden before I began my hustle-and-bustle day of tourism. Ned & Jeanette are fabulous hosts, paying attention to the smallest details of their guests' needs. They are  easily approachable while giving guests personal space. The location of the a Hermitage is wonderful. Within walking distance to GasWorks Park, the Fremont Troll, the Statue of Lenin, and numerous restaurants & coffee shops. Public transit is less than a 3 minute walk away and is tourist friendly. I highly recommend the Fremont area for a restful escape from the noise of downtown. Truly, I cannot say enough great things about The Hermitage and will jump at the opportunity to visit again! "
2525172,20348382,2014-09-28,20114251,Karen,"Jeanette and Ned made were welcoming and friendly, but also gave me plenty of space and privacy. My room was lovely - very clean, comfortable and charming. The Hermitage is in the heart of Fremont, within walking distance of many fun shops, sites and restaurants. Jeanette and Ned described their place very accurately, and it fully lived up to my expectations. I would definitely stay there again!"
2525172,20847164,2014-10-06,1383215,Allison,"Jeanette and Ned have an immaculate bed and bath with plenty of towels and privacy. The space is cozy, but well furnished. Bed and linens were comfortable. Cat behavior was just as described. :-) Nice location too! We received a warm welcome and prompt responses throughout our stay. We would stay there again."
2525172,21105136,2014-10-11,22058900,Joe,"Very nice part of Fremont (great bus access to everywhere) and a very quiet, well-kept place to stay!"
2525172,21210373,2014-10-13,1156443,Kerstin,"What a great deal! The Hermitage had everything you could ask for plus it's in one of Seattle's most exciting neighbourhoods. A short walk and you're at the lake with an incredible view of downtown Seattle!
Communication was quick and easy, the room and patio great, the bed big and very comfy and the cat friendly and fluffy - I'd recommend it without hesitating!"
2525172,21580921,2014-10-20,19475265,Debbie,"
Everything was great. Great location. Very clean."
2525172,21734734,2014-10-22,22764154,Michael,"Jeanette and Ned were replying super fast to our short-termed request, thanks again for this! The hermitage is as cosy as they describe it and they were very friendly. It is easy to reach their place with public transport and it a nice neighborhood as well!"
2525172,21916302,2014-10-26,22613713,士閔,"屬住宅區，但不遠處即有公車站牌到市區，更開心的是旁邊就是知名的觀光景點-Troll；住宿的房間於一樓與房東們(二樓)完全分開，不會因為作息不同而相互打擾；另外，房間與廁所衛浴都讓人感受到用心，令人覺得舒適。親切房東兩人Jeanette和Ned也花了些時間為我們簡單介紹附近住處附近環境(哪裡有好吃的、可去的景點...等)，連住處的貓都和我們招呼，超可愛的(非常可愛的貓，喜歡貓的人一定會超愛牠)！
總之，很喜歡這幾天待在The Hermitage的感覺，有機會一定會想直接再住這裡一次。"
2525172,22131919,2014-10-30,23088203,Brandy,"I ended up with an unexpected couple of nights in Seattle, Jeanette & Ned were super quick to respond to my request. They were super helpful in helping me navigate the unfamiliar public transport system. The room was super cozy, clean & exactly as described. It was also nice to have my own private bathroom.  I loved the urban garden/meditation area the most! And I feel honored to have been blessed with Beau's presence my last day. ;) Fremont is a fantastically quirky arts area! They offered a few maps & guides to local sites in the room. Ned also informed me of the 'must-sees' in Fremont. A very pleasant experience for my first time using Airbnb! I would stay at The Hermitage again in the future. "
2525172,22230842,2014-11-02,5882405,Alex,Ned and Jeanette made us feel at home and gave us a few tips to get around the neighborhood and places to visit. Communication was great. The place was as it was described. Very private and comfortable and cozy. 
2525172,22608390,2014-11-10,22713790,Mellisa,"My stay at the Hermitage was cozy and private, as promised. The room was perfect for a solo getaway. Loved Beau the cat! 

The location was fantastic with so much in and around Fremont to see, eat, drink and experience. My hosts gave me excellent recommendations on restaurants ahead of time and they were spot on. 

It was also extremely easy to go back and forth from downtown Seattle with multiple bus options. 

A sincere thank you, Jeanette and Ned!"
2525172,22728114,2014-11-12,3903924,Charlie,"You should stay here.

The hosts were very prompt to communicate and clear in answering questions (parking is available, for instance).  Ned made sure that the code for the door lock worked for me and made sure things went well for me.

The location is excellent; The Fremont neighborhood is a great spot with lots to see and eat and do, and just a short bus ride to downtown (bring exact change for the bus fare, though ($2.50), because they don't make change on the bus!).

The space was great.  The fixtures in the bathroom and doorhandles, etc. were very tight and felt great.

I would come back here and recommend that others do, too."
2525172,23360873,2014-11-30,2715842,James,"This B and B suited me extremely well.  The room is small, but it is very attractive, and has many touches, such as bus schedules, pen and notepad, knitted slippers, travel books and so on.  It has a really lovely bathroom and all made for a super retreat.  A chair would have been nice, although I can see that there is no room for one, and although I had a microwave and a fridge outside the room itself, there are minimal kitchen facilities.  The surrounding area is very interesting with all sorts of eating places, quirky attractions and easy bus access to downtown Seattle.  Ned and Jeanette were great hosts."
2525172,23617727,2014-12-06,7647211,Larry,"I appreciated the nicely appointed room and wonderful bathroom (important to me)! I did find parking a challenge, circling the long block twice before finding a spot resulting in a  a difficult walk on slick, poorly lighted streets up stairs or on one night, negotiating a narrow passage between 2 homes. I slipped and fell on slick wet streets.  So, I would caution if you are driving, be prepared for those challenges. My other observation is that the room is directly below the main living space and the noise from guests above and outside the bedroom door as they leave can disrupt attempts to sleep."
2525172,23778359,2014-12-09,20640343,Natalie,"Jeanette and Ned are outstanding hosts. They left detailed instructions how to access the house. The neighborhood is real nice, close to the famous Troll and pretty much everything in Fremont. Easy street parking, with the permit graciously provided by the host for the ""other"" side of the street. The living space is fabulous, with private full bathroom. I didn't care about kitchen/laundry which are not provided, because everything you need is in the room. Even bobby pins that I needed for a while!
Great stay, wonderful hosts!"
2525172,23886539,2014-12-13,20707332,Tracy,"Perfect place for independent traveler, 
Serenity neibougher, and do are Jeanettte and Ned. They have their warm heart there. "
2525172,24803662,2015-01-03,8347902,Ling,"The Hermitage is a perfect spot for my winter retreat!
Lovely host, great location . Even though the bed is a little soft for me but I got a private bathroom."
2525172,25543529,2015-01-19,3262808,Leah,"Great location, very comfortable and quiet room. Exactly what we were looking for/expecting. Also loved the sweet cat! Will definitely stay again. Thank you!"
2525172,25796160,2015-01-26,378717,Devon,"The Hermitage was a great little home away from home in the heart of Seattle's Fremont neighborhood. My wife had stayed here previously but this was my first time and I must say that I was presently surprised by the location. We never saw our hosts while we there but they had the place setup with guide books for Seattle, internet login/password posted on site, clean sheets on the made up bed, and an all around welcoming ambiance. The only snafu we encountered was around a miscommunication with the door code but once that was sorted, we were on our way to rest and relaxation in this charming spot. I highly recommend you stay with Ned and Jeanette at the Hermitage. "
2525172,25966768,2015-01-31,25762199,Kathleen,"I enjoyed my stay at The Hermitage. It is ideally located in the Fremont district where there is abundant public transport, cafes and restaurants. It is a perfect place to begin ones exploration of Seattle. Jeanette and Ned are respectful hosts who provide a private entrance, non-shared clean room with full washroom facilities. I recommend staying at The Hermitage if traveling as a single. (room might be a bit small for 2)"
2525172,26579110,2015-02-15,17219629,Peter & Jenna,"We had a really good stay at ""The Hermitage"". The communication with Jeanette & Ned was perfect! They answered all our questions and gave us good advice for parking. They are great hosts! 

The location is perfect. Very close to the Fremont Restaurant area and about 10 min drive to the city center. A bus stop is in about 5 min walking distance."
2525172,26898622,2015-02-21,21459689,Brian,"My stay at the Hermitage, while marred by a flu bug, was perfect in every other way. Jeanette and Ned have done a fine job of creating a private, clean and comfortable place to stay. I look forward to staying here again!"
2525172,27104232,2015-02-25,27362464,Zoe,"The Hermitage was an ideal place to stay for two nights while my boyfriend and I were scouting for apartments in the Fremont/Ballard area. It was a cozy, welcoming room on the bottom floor, separate enough from the rest of the house to feel like we wouldn't be in anyone's way.  As mentioned, we were looking for apartments, so the location of The Hermitage was unbeatable in terms of bus access. 
We did have a plumbing problem on our first night, which Ned and Jeanette went out of their to get fixed while we were out apartment hunting (greatly appreciated!). I was very impressed with their hospitality, and they even went so far as to offer a partial refund after the plumbing issue. 
We were not really in the room except to sleep, and if you were looking for a room to hang out in, it might be a little small for more than one person, but otherwise great. 
Beau the cat is a beautiful and gracious host as well!"
2525172,27569143,2015-03-08,17345738,Ina,This was my second stay at The Hermitage and like the first time I appreciated the cleanliness and the convenience of the location. Jeanette and Ned are excellent hosts and went out of their way to accomodate and help me with some personal needs. Thank you for a great stay. 
2525172,27851238,2015-03-13,13403337,Dylan,"The Hermitage is a wonderful, quiet, and welcoming place to stay, right in the liveliness of Fremont and a close walk to Wallingford. The entryway affords privacy, and the room is restful.

Though I did not meet with Jeanette and Ned personally, they were kind enough to let me rest a bit past checkout when I woke up on the final day with a migraine. They were kind hosts.

I'd highly recommend this space to anyone interested in visiting Seattle"
2525172,28102144,2015-03-17,28909802,Lea,"I really enjoyed my stay at The Hermitage. I arrived late in the evening and had to get up early every day, so I didn't meet Jeanette and Ned, but everything I needed was provided for. The room was clean and comfortable. The location is fabulous and I enjoyed a few evenings walking around the area and going to the Freemont Brewery after work. When I needed information for logging on to the Internet, Jeanette responded with the information very quickly and I really appreciated her promptness and attention. The bed was comfortable, there was great privacy and the attached bathroom was very nice (loved the towel warmer).   Their adorable sweet kitty cautiously came by to make an assessment of me, but didn't stay long (I was happy to have him/her). Many thianks for a lovely stay in Freemont!"
2525172,28358005,2015-03-22,25775176,Mattson,"The Hermitage was a great place to stay for a busy weekend. It was comfortable and easy to access with all the amenities and in a fantastic location. The lodging is just as described, and the access is beyond convenient. "
2525172,28539650,2015-03-25,28817495,Myrna,Great place to hangout and sleep after visiting with daughter during the day.  Appreciated the cleanliness and comfort of the space.  Would recommend to others!
2525172,28907927,2015-03-31,5041985,Leah,"I had a fabulous stay at the Hermitage, which is very conveniently located in the Fremont part of town.  The room is small but it's clean and cozy and fit the two of us quite nicely. The hosts provided a guest permit parking pass, but I never had too much trouble finding a spot. We would definitely stay here again! Thanks Jeanette and Ned for sharing your lovely home with us!"
2525172,29127200,2015-04-04,3189710,Sarah,"Our experience at the hermitage was perfect.  It's in a great area, it was extremely clean, and we loved the attached bathroom.  Although we never met Jeanette and Ned, they communicated through text and were very welcoming. Beau (the cat) is adorable. If you are bringing a car they have a parking pass available so you can park on the street.  Everything you could need at a great price in a great area. Five stars. :) "
2525172,29538459,2015-04-08,7486349,Orlando And Jennifer,"The Hermitage was a quiet haven for some well-needed escapism. My wife and I had been driving around Washington State for days and yearned for some rest. The Hermitage was cozy and very welcoming, with a private bathroom, shower, and a beautiful patio for reading and morning coffee. I would most definetely stay here again."
2525172,29651869,2015-04-10,20726925,R Michael,The Hermitage is everything Jeanette and Ned say it is and more. It is very clean an well maintained. Mary and I loved everything about this place. If you want to visit the Fremont area the Hermitage is where you will want to stay.. It is a 5 star experience for a very reasonable price.
2525172,29757926,2015-04-12,18999183,Noelle,"The Hermitage is located in a fun, walkable area. The room is extremely clean, and perfect for two people. Jeanette and Ned are flexible, easy to communicate with, and provide you with all you need (from clean towels to even a parking pass)! Have a coffee in the outdoor sitting area as well! Mahalo, Jeanette and Ned!"
2525172,30004999,2015-04-15,14804171,Brian,"Accommodations were great. Would definitely recommend for someone looking for something clean, quiet and within walking distance to the Fremont area."
2525172,30450933,2015-04-22,1225371,Elizabeth,"The Hermitage was a great experience. My travel companion and I loved the space, courtyard, coffee, troll, location, bus access, and visits from Beau the cat. A few of my favorite Fremont-y things included going for a run up Stoney Way, around Green Lake, and over Phinney Ridge. We also got tasty take-out from the PCC co-op and walked it over to the Fremont Brewery more than once. We never met Jeanette & Ned but had no issues and felt very welcome."
2525172,30654360,2015-04-25,13933918,Mike,"The hermitage was the perfect place to end an unforgettable solo drive up the Pacific Northwest. I briefly met with Ned upon arrival, very nice guy. The room is quiet, comfy and clean. Perfect place to unwind after a day of exploring Seattle. Walking distance to some great food and drink. Would definitely stay again. Thank you Ned and Jeanette!"
2525172,30844007,2015-04-27,15914552,Sumit,"It was a very comfortable stay for us. The guest room is isolated from the rest of the house, so it felt pretty independent. All the toiletries were there and everything was neat and clean. We had a car, parking was available and it was a convenient drive from most of the tourist places. Bean was adorable and very curious 3"
2525172,31129987,2015-05-02,4620235,Laura,"This house was in a really great location for exploring Fremont and with easy access to the rest of Seattle. We didn't meet Jeanette or Ned but getting into the house was really simple, and they replied quickly to any messages before and during our stay. The room had everything we needed and we really enjoyed our cup of coffee in the little garden at the back. "
2525172,31474765,2015-05-05,23876068,Joshua,"Jeanette and Ned's place is great.  Awesome location in Freemont right next to the troll.  They provided all the amenities I needed, information on what to see/do in the area, and the private coded entrance is very convenient.  I will definitely stay here again when I return to Seattle.
"
2525172,31795400,2015-05-10,6437984,Gerry,Had a very nice stay at the Hermitage. It is situated quite close to the Buddhist retreat center I was visiting and that was a big plus. The location is quiet facing an alley. The shower worked well and the bathroom was clean and well-taken care of. I would definitely consider the Hermitage for a return visit.
2525172,32446880,2015-05-18,2027763,Tamzin,"I met Jeanette only, she was welcoming and helpful. The space itself is perfect, the location near the Troll in Fremont excellent, and the attention to little details most welcome. Thoughtful touches all over the room. And their cat Beau is a character; visited many times to make sure I knew who was boss. :)  All in all, a great experience! Oh, the place was super clean, and there's a fridge and microwave, along with extra towels, blankets, a sweet sitting area outside a back door, all the goodies you might want to feel comfy and at home (even a beer in the fridge, if that's your thang). If you like to watch TV, there's none there, yet this was not an issue for me. Internet access provided, too! Highly recommended. Thanks! A+ "
2525172,33268184,2015-05-26,1816442,May,Room was cozy and clean. Awesome location in the heart of Fremont. Private bathroom was also clean with all amenities provided. Door code was super convenient for coming and going. 
2525172,33461549,2015-05-28,16643547,Rebecca,"Jeanette & Ned have made their room very cozy, warm and welcoming for their guests! So many perfect touches to make our one night there super relaxing. The extra little space of the garden was also lovely! We enjoyed an afternoon coffee outside. Also, the area is perfectly walk-able to so many great spots!"
2525172,33972593,2015-06-02,33045753,Taylor,We had a great stay at the Hermitage. The place is small but cozy and very clean. Perfect location for exploring Fremont. Jeanette and Ned were friendly and accommodating but very respectful of our space and privacy. I highly recommend this place!
2525172,34032777,2015-06-03,1971733,Caroline,"Jeanette and I had great communication via email; Paul and I were able to access the Hermitage easily at a time that was convenient. We live in Seattle ourselves, and are Airbnb hosts; we'd rented out our own house and needed a nearby place to stay, and the Hermitage was perfect for our needs.  Cozy but spacious, cute, with a nice outdoor patio, a great shower, a cup of coffee, a comfortable bed and close to all of the things we usually take advantage of: the gym, a great super market, and more coffee!  While a micro wave and refrigerator were also provided, for the one night we were there, we didn't make use of them. Would go back for sure..."
2525172,34175773,2015-06-05,32862906,Ellen,"I was not feeling well when I arrived, grappling with a headache, and I decided to go out again for the evening and not try to meet the hosts, but when I returned I got to spend a little time with the cat and then I slept very well, and when I woke up I could enjoy where I was more. It was nice to walk to the Troll in the morning light as I was leaving. I made good use of cafes, the pie place, and the co-op while I was there."
2525172,35258021,2015-06-16,2935758,Alexandria,The Hermitage was exactly what we needed for a quick stay. It was a very convenient location. I thought it was actually nicer than the pictures showed! The back garden is quite nice too.
2525172,35418698,2015-06-18,29183215,Jeremy,"Scheduling my stay with Jeanette & Ned was easy and painless. As I arrived, I had a few questions about parking, and Jeanette was quick to respond, which I really appreciated. The Hermitage is a lovely mini-apartment that's described accurately. They've made it feel welcoming, simple, and personal all at the same time. Though I didn't meet J + N, I knew they'd be available and helpful with any needs I might have. Highly recommended!"
2525172,35862340,2015-06-22,27903491,Lisa,"We arrived early to the city- and reached out to see if we could get into the room and yes, they allowed this. Very nice, clean and warm. Very friendly people - the best place - adorable! Thanks so much."
2525172,35991570,2015-06-23,864636,Johnna,"Our last minute request for a stay at The Hermitage was answered promptly by Jeanette.  Communicating with her was a pleasure, as was meeting her in person.  The room is *very* cozy (as described) for two, but had every single amenity we needed for our overnight stay. The sitting area in the back was a perfect oasis for when I needed to do a bit of work early in the morning. The shade and cool breeze was a welcome respite to the heat wave that was hitting Seattle! My husband (the cat whisperer) loved getting to know Beau, who even managed to make friends with our dog, Bonny. The location was perfect for exploring Fremont - but watch out for the troll! ;-) Thanks, Jeanette for a lovely stay!
"
2525172,36983538,2015-07-03,6425408,Whitney,"Jeannette made us feel welcome when we arrived. We had plans with friends out and about, so we didn't spend too much time at the Hermitage. The room was perfect for our needs, and the location was incredible. Thanks for having us!"
2525172,37122511,2015-07-04,4668102,Elyse,Jeanette and Ned were very responsive and helpful. The room was just what we needed for one night and it was great exploring the awesome neighborhood of Freemont. Loved the bathroom and the wonderful rain head shower . 
2525172,39290725,2015-07-22,34103393,Michael,"This was my first time using airbnb and Jeanette and Ned were very helpful in answering all of my questions and providing suggestions about places to eat in the area.  I didn't spend a lot of time at the Hermitage, but it worked great as a place to stay and was within walking distance of everywhere I wanted to go."
2525172,39781168,2015-07-26,23305444,Arla,Great location. Cozy and comfortable. A good base to explore Seattle.
2525172,40188713,2015-07-28,6685814,Nicole,"Ned and Jeanette were lovely and hospitable. The hermitage was just what we needed for our one night in Seattle - clean, comfortable, and quaint. There is a bar down the street that stays open late so we were able to really enjoy ourselves. We really liked both the Fremont and Ballard neighborhoods which are close by."
2525172,40404069,2015-07-30,7960391,John,"Spotlessly clean, cozy room. Laid back neighborhood with great restaurants nearby."
2525172,40746079,2015-08-02,13308341,Maya,"The Hermitage was a wonderful home base for my exploration of Seattle. The neighborhood is great with close walk to bars and the Troll. I felt safe at night and the room was private, clean, and cozy. Would highly recommend! "
2525172,41507858,2015-08-07,17893228,Tracy,"Had always stayed in downtown Seattle and wanted to branch out, and glad we did! Great little place in Fremont. Very safe at night. The Hermitage was very clean, tidy and charming. Private entrance was great, didn't feel like we were traipsing through anyones home. Took advantage of the local coffee shops and the charming Fremont library just steps away to get some work done. Beau the cat was the sweetest thing and always popped by to make sure we were happy. Also, great little private garden. Would stay here again!"
2525172,41775071,2015-08-09,18649427,Cody,"We had a great stay at the Hermitage. Jeanette & Ned made our arrival easy and convenient. The space is fantastic, and the private patio is an awesome touch. The home is in a great location within walking distance of great restaurants, shops, and of course, the Fremont Troll. For future visits to Seattle, we'll definitely consider the Hermitage again. "
2525172,42170097,2015-08-11,38501780,Audry,"This place was very nice, comfortable and clean.  The room was really close to the bus and close to several nice places to eat. It was the perfect place to stay.  "
2525172,42391419,2015-08-13,908511,Liza,"We enjoyed our experience! The room was honestly the perfect size for what we needed, which was a place for sleeping after a full day of expiring the city. The decor was pleasant, and we both felt comfortable during our stay."
2525172,42826886,2015-08-16,31093286,Thomas & Evy Ann,"We have never tried Airbnb before. But since the hotel prices in Seattle has trippled since last year, we needed to check alternatives this year. After looking around, we found The Hermitage.

It didn't take long for Jeanette and Ned to answer our request, a good start! We got all the info we needed in time, and our questions was quickly answered. We didn't get to meet Jeanette and Ned more than twice during our stay, but they were real nice to us, and we felt welcome there.

The Hermitage was maybe a bit small for us, but that was mainly because we had a lot of stuff with us (four week roadtrip...). The bed was big enough for the both of us, and the bathroom was surprisingly big. Everything was clean, and we really enjoyed staying here.

Beau, the house cat, welcomed us almost every time we got back. We liked that!

Our first experience with Airbnb was smooth and painless! Thank you Jeanette and Ned!"
2525172,43120252,2015-08-17,36369780,Jessica,"The Hermitage was by far one of my favorite aspects of our trip to Seattle. It is cozy, private, and charming. Morning coffee on the private patio was divine. Beau the Hermitage cat did a superb job of greeting us when we arrived and bidding us farewell when we left. A truly magical place that we will not soon forget. I look forward to staying here again!"
2525172,44428717,2015-08-26,29956336,Robyn & Jonathan,"We didn't meet the hosts as they were out of town. We thought the room was a little pokey and cluttered, but were grateful we at least had access to a private courtyard. There was nowhere to place our belongings, we had to pull our suitcase out of the cramped cupboard every day. Being a bed and breakfast, we were surprised we were not given any crockery besides mugs. The bathroom was great, location was fantastic and the place was clean."
2525172,44825951,2015-08-29,3577808,Kevin,"What a great place! It feels more like a full apartment than private room: private bathroom and outdoor area, a separate entrance, and a mini-fridge & microwave for personal use. The room may be a bit tight for two people, though the amenities and neighborhood more than make up for it!

Great stay, highly recommended. "
2525172,45960077,2015-09-07,38653855,Christanne,"The listing was exacting as described. It was perfect for me and being able to come and go without really bothering their common areas. I didn't take advantage of the provided coffee / coffee pot as I had so many coffee places on my places to try, but it was very nice. 

Just very accommodating to allow me to store my bike rental in the hallway, which I didn't end up renting overnight and allowing me the option to stay a little later since I had a late flight. "
2525172,46352476,2015-09-09,17127940,Justin,"This is the second time I've stayed at the Hermitage and it was just as enjoyable as the first. The keypad entry system is wonderful because it allows me to arrive without worrying about interrupting or waking anyone... brilliant! I wish more hosts used these keypads! 

The room is a nice quiet private space, perfect for my needs.

The location is great,  right in the heart of Fremont, walking distance to several bus lines and many great restaurants. I recommend Cafe Turko highly."
2525172,46495710,2015-09-11,38647686,Andy,Lovely place to stay. Very clean and lots of nice touches like the coffee machine. Great to have a quiet garden to rest in as well and easy to explore Fremont and also downtown as well. Recommended
2525172,47247021,2015-09-17,35223246,Beth,"Excellent communication from the host and very clean, comfortable accommodations with lots of nice little extras - great linens!"
2525172,48578589,2015-09-27,22057799,Andrew,The Hermitage was a pleasant place to stay during my weekend in Seattle. The room was perfect for what I needed: a place to sleep at night and a place to keep my things during the day. There were plenty of towels and the bathroom was very nice. Another plus was that it's within walking distance to everything in Fremont!
2525172,49041492,2015-09-30,6828424,Tanvir,Great small room very close to the Fremont Troll with a small outside area to drink your morning coffee.
2525172,49603376,2015-10-05,36538337,Jean,"We arrived early, but Jeanette was there to greet us and showed us around.   The room was clean and ready for us."
2525172,50099393,2015-10-09,44082274,Chloe,是個乾淨溫馨的小房間，附近大眾交通方便，步程距離內也有不少用餐選擇。出發前房東對我們的問題均能迅速回覆，在住宿期間遇到問題也能盡速協助解決。住址晚上不好找。
2525172,50953071,2015-10-16,19128849,Lark,"Jeanette and Ned were great hosts, they gave us plenty of space but were quick to give us maps of the area and recommendations for a place to buy good tea, and a place to rent bicycles.
Fremont is a wonderful neighborhood with plenty of restaurants and bars (and a brewery, and a cidery) within walking distance, as well as beautiful views of Lake Union and beautiful smells from Theo's chocolate factory.
The bedroom was cozy, the bathroom was bright and clean and the highlight of this listing is definitely the postage stamp backyard, where you can sit under an umbrella to protect you from the mizzle and have a cup of coffee on a chilly Seattle morning.
Flexibility about check-in times and a place to keep our luggage before we could officially check in were bonuses.
Plus, the cat came and visited us several times and that's always a bonus."
2525172,52422519,2015-10-29,21819731,Kathy,"Everything was as described.  The unit was easy to locate, with the keypad - no need to disturb the host.  It was private, small, quaint, located perfectly in Fremont, quiet and comfortable. "
2525172,54025720,2015-11-15,10264088,John,"Jeanette is a great host. She handles everything professionally. She is quite affable and has a very good sense of humor. Everything was a breeze - no complaints.

The room is exactly as described. I was impressed by how cozy and clean everything was. She lives in a great neighborhood and even helped me out by lending me a parking pass.

The heated towel rack in the bathroom is amazing! I would definitely stay here again. "
2525172,55727024,2015-12-05,47942103,John,"The location and accommodations were excellent!  The keypad door entry was great since I arrived late at night and preferred not to bother/wake anyone.  The bedroom and bathroom were very tidy and spacious.  The location was exactly what I was looking for on my trip to Seattle; bus stops for transit to downtown and UW were only a block away, Fremont brewing (one of my favorite places to visit in the city) was less than two blocks away, and great eateries in Fremont were just a short walk away.

I also loved the Hermitage cat!  He was very friendly and made me feel right at home."
2525172,56289752,2015-12-11,6460687,Michael,"My stay at The Hermitage was really nice. I did not meet with Jeanette & Ned (I arrived late and did not want to bother them) but everything was very nicely setup and I felt very welcome.

The room is very nice and very quiet. The bed was very comfortable. These two elements from someone sensitive to noise and prone to back problems are two very big plusses.

The location was great. Right next to the Fremont Marina with a nice running/biking path which was really nice for my morning run.
I definitely recommend The Hermitage for anyone visiting Seattle."
2525172,56400418,2015-12-13,49027468,David,"The host was very cordial and the room was clean and neat. In addition, I was able to listen to a concert that Ned had performed over the internet. All and all, it was a great stay"
2525172,57117915,2015-12-22,4186270,Sara,"An absolutely delightful stay - I will be back!! Beau the cat is so dear, the tub SO cozy, and the bed snug. Thank you for opening your home!"
2525172,57259576,2015-12-23,3894602,Caroline,"The Hermitage was perfect!  Easy to get in and out of, great location, and had everything I needed!"
2525172,57430367,2015-12-26,35223246,Beth,"This was my second stay at the Hermitage,and I just love it.   It's very comfortable, immaculately clean, and the hosts go above and beyond to make the time there wonderful.   Beau the cat's visits are always an extra pleasure. "
1147349,4972425,2013-06-04,3849192,Estell,"Jessica's place was just wonderful, just perfect. The location and size perfect for  husband and myself. Parking avail right out front and central to food and great sights. Thank You Jessica for opening your home to us"
1147349,5472511,2013-07-01,7024959,Chris,Jessica's apartment was awesome and so comfy. The space is perfect for a couple and the neighborhood is safe. She left post-it notes on kitchen cabinets making it easy to find kitchen items. My only regret is only staying one night. I hope to stay there again while in Seattle. 
1147349,5829632,2013-07-18,6858995,Lucky,Jessica's place was perfect for my girlfriend and I.  It had everything we needed for our stay and Jessica was considerate enough to label where everything is for you!  The location was perfect for our visit because it was so close to all the places we wanted to go.
1147349,5887078,2013-07-21,6736726,Matthew,"Jessica was great and was completely quick to respond and provide everything she said she would. The place is nice to have to yourself and love that there is free street parking, something that may be harder to find in Seattle!

Pleasure to communicate with and enjoyed the ability to stay a little out of the downtown and traffic, but also be close enough to get to anywhere in the city in a hurry! 

Seattle is now one of my favorite cities as well. Thanks Jessica!"
1147349,5919583,2013-07-22,3622308,Greta,Fantastic place to stay while in Seattle. Cute breakfast place just a couple blocks away. Very clean and had everything we needed. The price was right and we definitely recommend it!
1147349,6011864,2013-07-26,2640196,Clara,"Jessica's place was great for our trip--clean, comfortable, and easy to find. The fact that there's a code instead of a key seems like a minor thing, but made it really easy to get settled, especially since we were driving and hit traffic. The location is nice for most things you'll need--it's close to a park with an arboretum, good food (esp. try Cafe Flora--they have a very reasonable happy hour and good food and drinks), and near buses that go downtown. Overall, a nice stay."
1147349,6079327,2013-07-29,2179111,Erin,"We really enjoyed our stay here. Very easy to navigate - we rode the bus downtown one day, and the next day, we walked the 20 minutes down Madison to the park to enjoy the small shops, delicious restaurants and the beach! The apartment is comfortable and spacious. "
1147349,14229689,2014-06-15,1326812,Richard,Jessica was very helpful. The apartment was clean and comfortable. She left plenty of instructions for everything. Very nice!
1147349,14404566,2014-06-18,15740179,Raelynn,wonderful place! Everything was labeled and ready to go! Excellent location.
1147349,14498702,2014-06-20,9877433,David,"Jessica's spot is a lovely cozy underground-ish nook, really tidy and well laid out, easy to find everything needed.

The neighborhood is calm and hospitable. The arboretum nearby makes for an excellent daytrip.

"
1147349,15063150,2014-07-01,8762967,Marcia,Charming apartment and wonderful neighborhood. We would definitely stay here again.
1147349,15410127,2014-07-08,12554631,Angela,"Jessica's apartment is very cute and clean. It is spacious, easy enough to find and had all the amenities needed for a great stay.  I also appreciated that she left maps and information about Seattle out, as well as had a bathroom well-stocked with towels, toilet paper, a kitchen with coffee, etc. for our use.  It made us feel very welcome!  From the apartment, you can take a bus or drive down Madison to get directly into the city center in a brief amount of time.  Thanks for having us!"
1147349,15830748,2014-07-16,16814909,Stephanie,"Jessica was a great host. Her home is very clean and comfortable. It's also located in a nice neighborhood, situated near food, beverage and transportation. We especially appreciated how available Jessica was in the event we had questions. "
1147349,16275970,2014-07-24,18125609,Chris,"The listing was exactly as described.  It was clean, in a great neighborhood with lots of good restaurants and easy access to public transportation. Jessica was not around but was easy to get in touch with by phone and the code entry worked flawlessly. Having netflix to come back to after a day of sightseeing was a nice perk as well. She had basically every cupboard and closet door labeled so everything I needed was easy to find. I would definitely stay again if I make it back to Seattle."
1147349,16477684,2014-07-28,16837460,Ilian,"Great house, great location. Highly recommended."
1147349,16734296,2014-08-01,7133872,Annika,"I spent 3 beautiful days in Seattle and this cozy apartment was perfect! It is located in a beautiful area and surrounded by cute cafés. It was also wonderful having a bus stop so close, made getting downtown a lot easier than getting a cab. Great place to stay... Would stay again if I have the opportunity!"
3689416,16872521,2014-08-03,17979763,Jon,"My pet and I had a wonderful experience staying with Lauren. The place was very clean and cozy, spa like atmosphere with many amenities. Moreover Lauren was more than a good host and even walked my dog while I was away. I am definitely looking forward to going back!"
3689416,17312697,2014-08-10,9029816,Andrew,"Listing was accurate--neighborhood isn't the best, but I knew that going into it.  It's heavily residential dense within walking distance of Aurora which is like the 82nd Ave. of Seattle (if you're from Portland you'll get my reference).  The home was well kept and clean, and had parking as well.  The host is very nice, and wish I could've chatted with her more but was on the move.  Nice kitchen and has internet."
3689416,17479871,2014-08-12,1786411,Wesley,Lauren is a awesome host and her place is very nice and clean. Highly recommended! 
3689416,17662567,2014-08-15,19838220,Jason,"Lauren was very gracious and accommodating on very short notice.  A peaceful environment (and I didn't even take advantage of the pool or the nearby lake park access).  And a small, friendly pet that adjusts to you quite quickly! Lauren is quite in tune with how to get around the area and is generous with her information.  I most enjoyed the casual chat with her friends where I learned about the hitherto secret world of theater costume production."
3689416,17810960,2014-08-17,13030694,"Makila, Harmony And Emmalua Wind",We thought this place was a private appt untill we arrived and found its her appt and she has a small dog which unfortunately im allergic to dogs so it was too vague for me.   
3689416,18135879,2014-08-22,17908635,Batya,"Lauren was a great host. She was very kind and explained a lot about the city and how to get places. Her great apartment was also wonderful. The bed was comfortorbale, the pool was big, and the apt was very clean. We loved Ellie her dog she is just adorable! We are definitely. Staying here again!"
3689416,20579346,2014-10-01,1599258,David,"Lauren was absolutely fantastic as a hostess. She gave me full run of the house and incredibly inviting. I would stay here again no question. It is conveniently located for driving, biking or bus."
3689416,22428276,2014-11-06,21243501,Алена,"Staying at Lauren's home was great. The house is situated in a good place, it is easy to get downtown by bus. Lauren was kind and considerate, she helped me when I needed. Her dog is really fun! 
The only drawback was a little noise in the room because of vehicles outside. "
3689416,34659595,2015-06-10,33883177,Rohit,"Welcome messages left for us. We didn't struggle at all. We were welcome very nicely by Lauren. Yes, the listing description was accurate. We didn't get much time to interact with Neighborhood. "
3689416,35110709,2015-06-15,23050000,Joseph,"impeccably clean and well appointed. Very convenient for our event, Parking a bit challenging. Good experience"
3689416,35844121,2015-06-22,12651381,Lisa,"I booked Lauren's place for some of my colleagues from out of town so I didn't stay at her place myself and didn't get to meet Lauren in person. But my colleagues had a nice stay and enjoyed some of the amenities of the property.  The space was good for two, but tight for 3. "
3689416,41671656,2015-08-08,10045275,Susan,"Lauren was very organized and welcoming, and the apartment is very nice and clean. Comfortable bed, and plenty of room in closet and dresser drawers to store my things. Little dog was sweet, well behaved and quiet."
3689416,48285719,2015-09-25,35491458,Sabrina,I had a nice stay and really enjoyed the time. The apartment is really nice and clean. I had my own parking lot. Lauren was absolutely great as a hostess and it was a pleasure meeting her. 
479653,1862440,2012-08-01,140896,Jeff,"The house was great, clean and well-kept, with plenty of room for the 4 of us! Patricia was a wonderful host, extremely friendly and accommodating to all of our requests. Great location, easy access to public transportation. Next time I visit Seattle, I would definitely stay again!"
479653,2160470,2012-09-01,2972409,Dan,"My friend and I rented this house for a month while we went apartment hunting downtown.  It was very clean and Pat addressed the few things we mentioned very quickly.  We mentioned that the wireless was difficult to connect to and she immediately bought a range extender that solved the problem.

It has easy access to I-5."
479653,2338629,2012-09-18,1567496,Mitch,"Patricia was a great host!  The house was very comfortable and well-stocked, conveniently located, and perfect "
479653,2418510,2012-09-26,3035568,Lisa,I rented out Patricia's house on Beacon Hill for my family during their visit to Seattle.  The house is very comfortable and in a nice and quiet location.  Patricia was very friendly and even had some juice and snacks for the children.  I would definitely recommend staying here.
479653,2754816,2012-10-29,3841598,Kristen,This sleepy little home in Beacon Hill was great! It was the perfect retreat for the 5 of us after long days of exploring (email hidden)e house is conveniently located a block or two away from the 36 bus (which we took directly downtown) and the location was quiet but not too removed from the city.   Pat and Al were so accommodating and responsive from when we booked the place to our actual stay. They even left us some treats to eat in the morning! I would highly recommend staying with Pat and Al if you're planning a trip to Seattle.
479653,3232304,2013-01-02,348996,Mustafa,Pat and Al were awesome to us. We were 4 adults and 2 toddlers from Vancouver meeting in Seattle for New Years. The Sleepy on Beacon Hill was perfect for our family reunion. The house was very clean and spacious. Its not too far away from downtown (maybe 15 mins by car). It was a little chilly during our stay but Al was prompt enough to come and fix up the heating. We even got some complimentary firewood to use in their lovely fireplace! We would definitely recommend this space to anybody travelling to Seattle.
479653,3427002,2013-01-28,4329242,Hien,"I enjoyed to stay in Pat house for the last 04 weeks. However, the  rental price keep increase  after  each time  that I  change the day of leaving ( 03 times)"
479653,3507373,2013-02-10,725152,Lori,"We rented this lovely home for three of our staff members who work long hours in an intensive residency program. It was conveniently located, immaculate, cozy and such a restful place for them throughout the week. The hosts are wonderfully gracious and responsive to every need. Thank you!!"
479653,3707310,2013-03-06,231508,Barry,"This is a guest house, not anyone's residence, so it has the impersonal, minimally decorated feel of a hotel room. That can be nice - sometimes you just want to stay someplace where you feel like it's effectively your place for the weekend, rather than feeling like a guest in someone else's home.

The beds were comfortable and everything that we used (dishwasher, fridge, etc). worked perfectly. The living room was comfy for us to sit around and chat in. I liked the breakfast nook very much as a spot for morning reading and cereal (although it's only big enough for two). 

Pat and Al's communication was totally excellent; whenever I contacted them through airbnb they got back to me very quickly. We needed to check in a little early on the first day, and Pat and Al were flexible and nice about that.

There were four adults in our group - three slept on beds, one on the living room sofa, which she said was quite comfy - and I believe a couple of our group are planning to contact Pat and Al again for a future stay."
479653,3828683,2013-03-18,5438379,Tony,Pat and Al's house on Beacon hill was wonderful! It is perfectly located minutes from from everything you need to see in Seattle. Pat welcomed us with a bottle of wine and some fixings for a nice salad. Definitely recommended.
479653,3989179,2013-04-01,5582685,Jake,"This was our second time staying in this house, and I'm looking forward to coming back.  Patricia was friendly, helpful and gave us all the information we needed. the house was super clean, and we all appreciated having a comfortable, quiet place to relax after a long day of convention work."
479653,4121163,2013-04-11,5696869,Laurienne,"There were three of us staying at the Seattle Sleepy; my brother, my husband and me.  We had plenty of space, and never felt we were on top of each other.  We cooked dinner in the well stocked kitchen, and made good use of the wifi.  I really appreciated how easy it was to get to various places in Seattle, the ample parking, and the proximity of the Red Apple grocery store.  My brother would have liked having a television, but other than that. It was perfect for us.  Also, Patricia, the owner was very friendly and helpful to us.  We felt like welcome guests."
479653,4412214,2013-05-03,3443933,Zoe,"We very much enjoyed staying at Patricia's place! There was initially a minor issue with the heating system, which was taken care of promptly and without stress. One thing I will say - Patricia is amazing! We asked for a blender on Day 2, on a whim because we wanted to make fresh fruit smoothies from the fruit we bought at Pike's Place Market, and she delivered one within 20 minutes!  Nothing beats that kind of service. Her home is lovely, well cared for, clean, and spacious. This place is also family-friendly, so if you have little ones, this place is A-OK."
479653,4735231,2013-05-22,6229489,Dianne,"We had a wonderful stay in Seattle, and the accomodations at Seattle Sleepy on North Beacon Hill made the trip even better! Patricia and Al were wonderful hosts, and they made sure we had everything we needed in the house. They were always available to help if needed, and answered all our questions promptly. Fantastic communication via e-mail and phone.

During our stay,  we loved the sun room and the light-filled breakfast nook! Our children had a great time playing in the spacious and well-maintained backyard.  There was plenty of space for our family to unpack and relax...and it really felt like our home away from home! The house is very close to all the sites in downtown Seattle, and the Beacon Hill neighborhood is full of wonderful things to see and do. It is a safe, quiet neighborhood, and a great retreat from the busy downtown.  I plan to come back next time I travel to Seattle.  If you are looking for a great place to stay while in the city...you've found it! "
479653,4791564,2013-05-26,5525511,Hwei Ee,We had a very pleasant stay at Patricia's place on Beacon Hill. We initially felt that the house was not warm enough (we come from a tropical country near the equator so we are not used to cooler temperatures). But they were quick to help us warm up the central heating and also unlocked the controls for the heater in case we felt too warm later. Rooms and beds were nice. House was spacious and clean and tidy. Free laundry is really convenient. I'd stay here again.
479653,4868412,2013-05-29,6423079,Vidhya,"Patricia's place was just lovely and perfect for our family get together, the place was very neat, and Pat had taken the extra mile to stock up with essentials and even Mac n cheese when she heard that we have a couple of kids. Pat was very responsive to our requests for adjusting thermostat and hair dryer, which was very sweet of her. The neighborhood was great, calm and pretty close to both airport and Seattle center. The kids loved the connecting pathway from living room to kitchen and bath, and the men loved the den with the recliners. I would recommend this place strongly, Thanks Pat, for your great hospitality :)"
479653,5100400,2013-06-12,6050101,Ryan,We had a great stay in Seattle!  Patricia was attentive and the home was clean and cozy. The location was perfect for traveling to and from downtown. Thanks Patricia!
479653,5273163,2013-06-22,5695274,Ron,"We had a great stay at Patricia's Seattle Sleepy on North Beacon Hill. The house is clean and comfortable. The kitchen is well stocked with dishes and cooking items so that we were able to prepare many of our meals there. We had 5 people staying in the house and we were all very comfortable. Pat is the best kind of host in my opinion, quick to respond to any questions and other than that she left us to ourselves! All of our interactions with her were friendly and helpful. This was my first Airbnb experience and it was a great start. "
479653,5363622,2013-06-26,6225037,Brianna,"Thanks Patricia!
We had a great stay at your home. Thank you for being so comfortable and accommodating our whole family. Patricia was so thoughtful and brought us out a toddler bed for our little girl.  It was a great trip for our friends from Minnesota! The home was clean, well stocked and organized. We loved the easy access to mass transit. The little girls (4 and almost 3) got to ride on the light rail, tram, and street car and thought this was the highlight of their trip! "
479653,5460171,2013-07-01,3848237,Elizabeth,"We had a great stay here.  The house is roomy, sunny, and comfortable, with lots of privacy and a nice backyard, and a great little breakfast nook area.  Pat communicated quickly and clearly on everything, and our stay here was comfy and smooth."
479653,5633848,2013-07-09,5418198,Esther,"
We very much enjoyed our stay. The house was very clean and the garden was well tended. And it is ideally located between the airport and Seattle. Patricia was a wonderful host! She is a warm person, and very quick to respond to any concerns one may have. I would encourage anybody to stay here!"
479653,5703346,2013-07-12,4866879,Stephen,"When booking Patricia's replies were speedy, helpful and efficient. We are a large party which didn't faze Patricia in any way, in fact I would say Patricia went out of her way to accommodate us and make us feel at home. The house was well stocked, with all the necessities and then some. The cookies went down a treat with my children on arrival. There was an information area in the lounge which provided us with invaluable informative information. The house is located in a lovely quiet area, and a short distance into the city. We found a great store on 4th called Red Apple which had all we needed. There are other stores within walking distance from the house. While there, we got a city pass, which we found value for money (4adults 5 children) as it meant, everyone in our party was entertained. You get 2 trips on the space needle ( 1 you have to do after dark), aquarium, argosy cruise, science centre, museum, and choice of zoo or flight museum ). We were there 3 days and it was tough going to fit it all in, so we were fully entertained. If we ever get back to Seattle we would without hesitation book with Patricia again. Many thanks for a lovely stay."
479653,5781500,2013-07-16,5743671,Virginia,"Private, comfortable, homey; feels like you're a real resident of Seattle, not a tourist; close to major thoroughfares, but no traffic noise; private backyard with birdviewing opportunities; loved cooking, laundering, ironing with provided appliances and utensils; strong wifi; Pat and Al we're wonderful, responsive, genuinely concerned that our visit would be enjoyable; we will definitely stay here again, looking forward to our next visit.  Kay and Larry"
479653,5877863,2013-07-20,5366297,Carola,"Een groot huis in een rustige buurt.
De bus downtown stopt op 200 meter afstand, een rit van een half uur.
De light rail is verder weg, je moet dan eerst de bus nemen.

Jammer dat het huis geen tv heeft, wel is er WIFI."
479653,5938078,2013-07-23,2177112,Stefano,"We ate a lot of the macaroni and cheese out of the cupboards. We did not get a chance to grill on the indoor fire pit and that makes me sad. There were lots of towels that is nice. We kept looking for a TV but could not find one. I think if they chopped the tree in front of the house down, it would be a good idea. There were lots of spiders around, but I think it was just spider season. There was ""lots of curls"" hair gel in the bathroom which is my favorite gel. There was also lots of body wash that we could use, but we brought our own. The house is very sturdy, it is made out of bricks. There also was no stereo but I brought my own speakers so we could have music. That made it less awkward. We sang loud and no cops came so that was nice. Nobody touched our cars or stole them, I was worried because it is a big city, but we did not have any problems. I bumped my head on the ceiling in the room in the basement, but I am taller than normal humans, so that probably was just my problem. I had the small people stay in that room. I'm pretty sure the Seattle Sleepy on North Beacon Hill experience cost me more than a hotel would, but it was nice to pretend that I had a house. I felt like a family man. The gas station closest to the house is owned by a grumpy man, and they don't have hot morning coffee there, or much else like fresh food, but they do have some things. It is not an am/pm. You cannot get corn dogs or potato wedges or chicken tenders there. They are not a deli. They are a gas station. They played Christian music inside though, and the grumpy man was humming along so I think he loves Jesus which is good. I wanted to plant something in the indoor garden too, but I also did not have time for that. There were many things that we wanted to do like sit in the front lawn in lawn chairs and wave at people driving by, but we actually were gone all day and only came back to sleep pretty late at night. I am afraid we did not get the full experience, but that is also my problem. There is also a table outside with an umbrella that we sat under to protect us from harmful UV rays of the morning sun. We could have had hamburgers there but we did not have time for that. There was plenty hot water to shower in, I do not like to shower in cold water. Even though there is only one bathroom, that is not a problem if you take turns. It is strange to me that the photo has a big tree that is hiding the house. That is funny. "
479653,6066232,2013-07-29,2095569,Matt,"Patricia place was great, it felt like a home( our home) It was easy to get downtown via bus and quick via cab. It was a nice quiet street and allowed for some nice relaxation. Only issue was were weren't there long enough to fully enjoy it. Would love to stay again for longer."
479653,6222815,2013-08-04,7343704,Marisol,Our kids absolutely loved staying in the spacious 3 bedroom house after staying in 2 queen bed rooms during our vacation.  It was great being able to cook breakfast and just relax.  Pat was wonderful.  Very responsive and wanted to make sure we were comfortable or know if we needed anything.  We would definitely stay there again.
479653,6452908,2013-08-13,4623148,Felice,"What a wonderful place to stay in Seattle!. We were here with 5 adults for a wedding in Seattle and stayed 3 nights.  It was easy to get into downtown by car or light rail and an easy ride from the airport. The house with 3 bedrooms ( all with dressers and closet space) easily fit our family.  The house was immaculate and well stocked with dishes, pots and pans, appliances all in excellent condition. The kitchen cabinets were stocked with tea, oil, and lots of instant meals.  We loved eating out in the yard. It felt like a home away from home.  So much better than staying in a hotel!
Patricia lives next door and stopped by to introduce herself and make herself available if we needed anything.
We would recommend this house and hope to stay here in the future.
Thanks, Patricia.
"
479653,6556517,2013-08-17,6721050,Hillary,"Nice home in a quiet area south of Seattle, but be aware that planes going to the airports fly nearby on a constant basis and this can be annoying if the windows are open.  Home was equipped with nearly everything we needed.  Patricia made sure that we had plenty of beds to sleep all of our kids and had everything ready upon our arrival.  She is quick to respond to emails and I know she would have been happy to help us with anything while we were there."
479653,7199576,2013-09-10,8012147,Humberto,"Really nice house, very clean, big rooms, nice living room, great patio I will recommended to my friends "

Overall wonderful experience!

479653,7869983,2013-10-07,7248030,Liz,"We had 6 of us stay at the house. we thought it was perfect. Dog friendly,elderly friendly! We were surprised by the TV. It was funny how I BBQ in the bedroom, but food was great! Coffee pot was broken and she brought one right over to us! Great location for the freeway and downtown! Thank you we would love to stay again!
"
479653,10551116,2014-02-24,9205793,Mark,"Pat and her Beacon hill residence are both perfect. We stayed in Pat's home on our recent trip to Seattle and we couldn't have asked for more. Huge home, well furnished, clean and has the best host possible.
Pat's place has absolutely everything you need for a home away from home.  Will be staying here again and would recommend to anyone! 
This is one of the best on Airbnb"
479653,10717603,2014-03-04,1693519,Shellie,"My family and I had a lovely stay at Pat's Beacon Hill home while in Seattle for my son's wedding.  The house is very comfortable and spacious.  Pat greeted us the first day and was very helpful with recommendations for our shopping needs.  though we had a lot of family members come and go we managed quite well with the one bathroom.  The neighborhood is quiet, charming and convenient to the light rail and stores.  i highly recommend  Pat's Beacon Hill House.  "
479653,11402109,2014-04-01,2734499,Jason,This house is perfectly located close to the freeway. Easy to get to and not too far from the city core. Patricia was a fantastic host. Great communication. She called to check in with us upon arrival. I will definitely keep this listing in my back pocket for future use.
479653,12366626,2014-04-30,11951070,Carney,"This place was perfect for us and our extended family after three weeks on the road in campervans. Although it usually only sleeps 8 Pat was very accommodating and allowed us to fit 14 people in (6 adults and 8 children) and we were still very comfortable. 
The house is spacious with a large yard for kids. It qas easy to get into town to see Seattle and there are plenty of interesting places close by in Columbia City too. And if you don't mind a bit of a walk you can easily get too and from the airport on the light rail for $2.25!
Pat was a very kind and helpful host. I would highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a place to stay in Seattle, especially families. "
479653,13486930,2014-05-28,13856282,Edrick,"Our stay was pleasant, we enjoyed the location, which was near enough downtown city center. Quiet neighbourhood. Beds and bedrooms were comfortable and we were warmly welcomed by Patricia and her husband. However, we were slightly under prepared with toiletries, as we thought it would be adequately stocked. All in all, a good stay. Kitchen is well-stocked and lots of appliances to use."
479653,13952140,2014-06-09,13538729,Gene,"Patricia was very friendly, had a very nice home, and a well-kept yard. It was nice to have a bedroom for each of my family members. The kitchen worked well to get us started on our day. The home is in a nice quiet neighborhood and within 15 – 20 minutes from downtown. I would recommend this place to any group of people visiting Seattle."
479653,14969343,2014-06-30,15022007,Dylan,"We had eight people stay over three nights at the house and everything went very well. The house was large and accommodating, and even though there was only one bathroom we had no issues with making up a schedule. Pat was wonderful and stopped by on our second day there to say hello and make sure everything was going well. The house is also close to quite a few decent restaurants including an awesome karaoke place we went to late Friday night.
We had a large dinner party Saturday night and the kitchen worked perfectly for our needs (we baked a 12 pound ham!) There was someone doing yard work for while we had our dinner party Saturday night which was a bit distracting, but yardwork needs to get done at some point! The place was lovely, close to amenities, and quite comfortable. Would love to stay there again."
479653,15212547,2014-07-05,3974838,Loretta,A wonderful place for a family to stay. We are a family group of 7.  Everyone had a bed.  There was enough space for all.  The kids had so much fun running and playing in the back yard. The kitchen had stainless steel pans and a crock pot.  The washer and dryer was so convenient for us.  There is a costco 3 miles away and a little grocery store 1/5 miles away.  The house worked great for us.  Thank you
479653,16608892,2014-07-30,15527158,Marco,"The house was a great place to stay. It was very clean, spacious and kid-friendly. The house had a very comfortable vibe and was located in a family oriented neighborhood. Overall the experience was very positive and we would definitely stay here again."
479653,20892426,2014-10-07,732256,Linda,"This pretty house is in a quiet, safe and friendly neighborhood. Lots of room to spread out and hang out. It has all the comforts of home plus a large backyard. We had several family parties there with no problem.  
Pat welcomed us with herbs from her garden and a big warm smile. She lives next door and is available when needed without being intrusive or nosy. We like to cook and requested a few additional kitchen items, which she quickly provided without questions.
We particularly enjoyed the Chief Sealth trail a half block away, with walking, pet-walking and biking in two directions through interesting neighborhoods, ending in a Japanese garden at one end and near the waterfront at the other. 
Another big plus for us was access to the main Beacon Hill bus line, #36, which runs every 10 minutes most of the day and into the night. It goes directly past the new metro station, which has access south to the airport and north to downtown Seattle. The #36 bus also goes to the International District, downtown to all the tourist attractions, and  then through the downtown bus tunnel with its connections to northern and southern parts of the city. We left our car in the driveway a lot and took the bus instead...even at night. With freeway I-5 nearly always gagged up, public transport was a huge bonus.  
We'll definitely book here again when we return to Seattle."
479653,21335378,2014-10-15,2696348,Nora,"Patricia was an absolutely wonderful host- welcoming and helpful.  The house exceeded all of my family's expectations.

479653,22297894,2014-11-03,3384736,Amanda,"Patricia is a lovely host. She lives next door so if you need anything, she will be right by to help you out. She even let us stay past our checkout time due to conflicts of our bus schedule.
The house was amazing for our weekend trip. It's stocked with just enough to get you started. (coffee, sugar, even some pasta!) The charming rooms are great and beds are sooooo comfy. We fit 8 people comfortably here. If you wanted to fit more, that's no problem because there is space on the couch.
The only thing to keep in mind is that there is only 1 bathroom. We initially figured this wouldn't be a problem but with 3 girls who take 2 hours to get ready, it's our fault! "
479653,22680576,2014-11-11,22616140,David,Pat was a wonderful host to my friends and I! She came over to make sure that we had everything we needed and very easy to talk with and open. We had a fantastic time staying at her place and look forward to staying there again in the future!

Her house is so cute and clean. The most impressive part of her place is the kitchen. Every thing is so clean and she has even prepared us neccessary seasonings and food. 
I feel so lucky to have such a chance to stay in Patricia's place with my friends. And I will definitely go back to her next time I visit Seattle."

The house was super convenient for our purposes--a nice big space, a short drive from the airport and downtown. It being Seattle in January, we didn't take advantage of the nice back yard, but we definitely would have in warmer months."

15108,4324698,2013-04-28,5408955,Tatiana,"I am absolutely satisfied with Bob's plaсе. First, it is the best location in Seattle. Green lake- it is something amazing!! Its a perfect place for walking, jogging, bicycling , kayaking, taking pictures and every thing!!  There are a lot of cafes , restorans , but at the same time it's very picefull, not crowded place, very  convenient to get downtown and university district. Second, Bob-is great! Hi is  friendly, helpfull and welcoming like host  and  interesting like a person! And his lovely pets are so cute! 
Thank you, Bob! "
15108,5155676,2013-06-15,3364003,Mackenzie,Bob's room was just what I needed. A quiet place to rest and work for a bit before heading to climb Rainier. Bob was welcoming and fun to talk to. He has a lovely backyard with so many cozy places to curl up and read. It was a treat to stay with him! 
15108,5201006,2013-06-17,4377410,Tiffany,We had a quick overnight stay and we had a great time.  Bob was wonderful and we loved the sweet cats! The location to Greenlake was convenient for a morning run and the backyard is fantastic! 
15108,5352889,2013-06-25,6867601,Steve,"Bob is a great host. Comfortable house with nice downstairs bedroom, comfortable bed. Shared bathroom but not a problem to access. Very close to downtown Green Lake restaurants,  Thanks Bob!"
15108,5518324,2013-07-03,7117003,Steve,"Real estate agents say, ""Location location location."" This charming home is, ""Location location location location location location."" Oh, did I mention it is in one of the best, hippest neighborhoods in the Seattle area? Green Lake is a scenic country oasis within the city of Seattle. 

I treated a 19 year-old German student, Jasper, to three nights at Bob's house because my place, and the timing, was impractical. Bob was enjoyable to do business with, albeit by phone, and it felt as though we were old pals. I look forward to meeting him in person. The accommodations were delightful as promised, according to Jasper. I did see the inside, and the yard, and agree. Although I am unfamiliar with the German language, I believe Jasper's ear-to-ear grin at Bob's house spoke volumes. "
15108,5537121,2013-07-04,7218901,Simone,Nice location. You're sharing the bathroom and house with college students. Bed is ultra firm.
15108,5878538,2013-07-20,177084,Francesco,"We had a great time in Seattle at Bob's place. The room is nice and cozy, it was great to meet Bob and he gave us some excellent tips on what to do and see in Seattle. Definitely recommended."
15108,5993299,2013-07-25,2552528,Enrique,"I stayed at Bob's five nights and had a pleasant visit. Bob was friendly and helpful, very easygoing. The house is a bit outside Seattle's center but well connected by buses.The neighborhood is nice with a beautiful lake and park, and restaurants, close by. The room was comfortable enough and I had no problems with the other guests or using the bathroom. It's next to the kitchen and you can hear the conversations, but people were respectful and it was not an issue for me. The hot tub in the yard was wonderful in the evenings. It was a good experience and I would definetely stay at Bob's when I am in Seattle again. "
15108,6281261,2013-08-06,7252438,Ulrike,"Wir waren 12 Tage bei Bob und ,wurden sehr herzlich aufgenommen.
Es war alles so wie beschrieben.Der Garten ist eine Oase der Ruhe,
und man konnte den Wirlpool benutzen oder einfach nur entspannen
Dass wir das Bad teilen mussten war auch kein Problem.Die Katzen genossen ihre Streicheleinheiten,und wenn unsere Zimmertür offen war ,schwupps,lagen sie im Bett! (wenn nicht,kratzten sie an der Tür ),Bob ist ein ausergewöhlicher hilfsbereiter und lieber Gastgeber.Ich habe ihm so gerne zugehört wenn er auf  seinem  Klavier spielte oder singend das Geschirr spülte.Dieses Haus lebt und hat eine positive Energie.Leider spreche ich nur ein wenig Englisch,und doch klappte die Verständigung weil Bob sich sehr große Mühe gab.
Bob ,wenn es wirklich klappt dass wir uns sehen wenn du in Italien bist werde ich bis dahin mein Englisch aufbessern!!!! 
Danke für alles, Es war  schön dich kennenzulernen.

Liebe Grüße auch von Franziska

15108,6337875,2013-08-08,57238,Kristi Anne,"The house was comfortable, and the cats were lovely, but the garden was definitely the highlight. Thanks for being such a nice host, Bob, we'll definitely come down another time soon. :)"
15108,6377834,2013-08-10,7579043,Sara,bob was wonderful. its extremely close to the lake and an easy taxi ride from most things.  def recommend staying with him and his two lovable cats
15108,6440029,2013-08-12,2887430,Trevor,This was my first airbnb experience and i'm a fan.  Big thanks to Bob and for him sharing his nice room in Seattle.  He was very helpful in providing quick advice to local eateries and coffee shops as well as make my stay as comfortable and easy as possible.  If you stay here I advise you to check out Green Lake sunsets- stunning views only a few blocks away!
15108,6481865,2013-08-13,7292355,Michele,"This room was in a great location and the room was clean and comfortable. A surprise bonus was the host Bob, who with his friendliness.generosity and openness made me feel instantly at home. Bob rents out more than one room in the house and I got the impression that it is always buzzing with activity and socializing!  This might not be a first choice for someone looking for quiet, alone time free of pets, but for me, it was a fun experience and I would definitely return! Thanks Bob!"
15108,6691479,2013-08-21,7640733,Eduardo,"Bob was an incredibly chill and fun host. We felt very welcome at Bob's place, almost like family! We joined in on one of his many game nights and had a blast while there. He was very helpful, and also let us his kitchen pretty much every day, as well as his collection of spices and seasoning! 

I highly recommend staying at Bob's place if your passing through Seattle, or staying there longer term for school, etc. "
15108,6782583,2013-08-25,7098109,Jane,Bob was a gracious host whose location was ideal for me.  His other house members equally nice and sharing.  This was a fine entree back into Seattle after 7 years away.
15108,8109789,2013-10-16,890695,Tom,"Bob's place is a true community.  Besides the others rooming in the house, many of Bob's friends stop by for an evening  of pleasant talk and board games.  One can join in around the kitchen table or retreat to one's room without feeling pressured to participate.  Bob is an extraordinary raconteur as well as working actor, songster and piano player.  He is full of energy and skill.  The house is situated just a block from Green Lake which I am told is the busiest park in Washington.  Walking, jogging, or wheeling around the lake is a favorite form of exercise for what seems like the majority of north Seattle.  I stayed at Bob's for a month and a half.  I used the city transit for nearly all my travel and found it to be convenient.  Two major routes stop just a short block away and several others are nearby.  Restaurants, pubs,  Ben and Jerry's ice cream, coffee shops and a couple grocery stores are within walking distance.  Bottom line is I loved my stay and next time I'm in Seattle Bob will be first on my list for lodging."
15108,8748809,2013-11-15,9915895,Septimus,"Staying with Bob was wonderfull! Exceeded all my expectations. Thoroughly enjoyable and very relaxed. The cats are a treat and the hot tub is a dream and Bob will provide great entertainment and conversation. The bed was very comfortable, I didn't want to leave!!! I recommend staying with Bob highly. A home away from home.Thank you Bob, I can't wait to return!!"
15108,11300173,2014-03-29,12025608,Heike,"The five weeks I spent at Bobs in Seattle passed way to fast! When I arrived I had a warm welcome with homemade soup and waffles. The kitchen was well equipped and it was fun to cook there. It was always fun to meet up for chats in the nice common areas with Bob, the other housemates, friends or the two lovely cats. Also the neighbourhood, Greenlake, is a good place if you are motivated to discover places that are not on every tourists schedule, such as Ballard, Wallingford, Ravenna or the University District - all easy accesible by bus.
Go ahead - if you wanna have a good time in Seattle, book a place at Bobs! :-)"
15108,12414291,2014-05-01,14563304,Parikshat,Very warm and welcoming place. No false advertisements  !!  
15108,17264265,2014-08-10,13616694,Volodymyr,"All in all it was an exceptional living experience with Bob! It was a friendly, quaint and welcome atmosphere with an awesome back yard to boot."
15108,17399370,2014-08-11,19176623,Kelsay,"Bob met me at the door, very friendly and welcoming. The room was exactly as the pictures showed, the house was very charming and eclectic. I really want to know how he got that gorgeous grand piano in there!  He had towels laid out, fresh flowers on the nightstand, and played some great piano music I could hear while I was in the shower. :). His cats were so friendly one tried to stow away in my backpack. "
15108,17606809,2014-08-14,8659453,Brian,"Bob was very welcoming and really helped us out by approving our stay at the last minute. We were only in the house for one night, so we spent very little time there. House is in a great location...walking distance to a couple bus stops and Green Lake. A little disappointed with the cleanliness of the house and room (the room smelled like cats and mildew). Also did not realize the house was shared with several other AirBnB guests, giving it a hostel feel. "
15108,17868554,2014-08-18,19011553,Adrian,"Bob was a gracious host, very friendly. We felt welcomed in his home and our needs for quiet time were considered. The house is in a great neighborhood in Seattle and has an awesome back yard. It is a little bit of a funky house and I would recommend coming prepared for that experience. Like most older houses, sound travels well. Any comers here should love cats, because there are two very present male kitties living here. "
15108,17984735,2014-08-19,3738064,Adrien,Bob is friendly and welcoming. The neighborhood is cool. Before booking this place make sure your not annoyed by cat smell. 
15108,18685637,2014-08-30,6741943,Dana,Bobs place was in a great location. Close to Green Lake on a quite beautiful street!
15108,19766648,2014-09-18,872909,Thea,We had a lovely time at Bob's house met his two nice cats! Bob is a fantastic nice host en we like to come back next year.
15108,20660427,2014-10-03,21200830,Juan,"The house is great. Good location, near the beautiful Green Lake Park and close to bus stops. Bob is an amazing host, very friendly and willing to go out of his way to help you. The bed is very nice, the bathroom clean, the kitchen fully equipped. I honestly wish I could have stayed more time."
15108,21189557,2014-10-12,5644003,Christine,"Bob was very kind and accommodating in letting me stay at his home on last minute's notice, though we really didn't get the chance to meet.  The bed was comfy, and the neighborhood was very quiet for being so close to the bustle of Green Lake--walking distance to shops, restaurants and the local health food store.  Lovely kitties, too!"
15108,29287529,2015-04-06,28233589,Jonathan,"Very pleasant stay. He respected the fact that I was there for school and therefore didn't have much social time, but always invited me to join him and others in playing board games, etc. He was also very helpful in suggesting directions to places where I needed to go as well as having a genuine interest in what I was studying."
15108,33379182,2015-05-27,28468250,Debora,"Bob is amazing host, he is very friendly and made us feel at home. The room is cozy and we love it! And Bob is a wonderful singer !! I hope we can watch him in another concert."
15108,42658046,2015-08-15,27107346,Tejal,"The room/ house was everything that it promised to be. A block away from buses to downtown, the supermarket, etc. A block away from Green Lake where I spent many memorable evenings. Bob is very friendly and welcoming. I cooked quite a bit in the kitchen and he very graciously let me use spices/pots/containers etc. The hot tub in the backyard and Pollux, Bob's cat, were a bonus! I grew up scared of cats but I got quite attached to Pollux by the end of my stay. I had a lot of fun conversations with Bob whenever we overlapped in the kitchen. I'd highly recommend the house to anyone looking to stay in a picturesque neighborhood while being close to downtown."
15108,45144156,2015-08-31,11453615,Jeff,"I stayed in one of the upstairs bedrooms for 6 months, and have visited twice since moving out of the state.  Overall, I had a great experience living here.  Bob is a wonderful host and friend.  Will stay in touch for a long time, I'm sure.  He was very reasonable and understanding with everyone living in his home.  

The house is only 2 blocks from Green Lake and I always felt safe walking nearby.  It's a quiet area with no real noise pollution, like police sirens or thumping bass.  The jacuzzi and garden were great to relax in.  On-street parking was never, ever an issue, and there was plenty to do and see within walking distance.  The nearest bus lines run on Wallingford Ave, only a block away. You can go to U District or  or downtown without having to transfer.  I commuted to Redmond every day by bus and never felt like it was an epic journey.  

Would definitely recommend and will probably return if I come back to town again.
"
15108,48715283,2015-09-28,5741939,David,"Bob is absolutely fantastic.  With late night conversations in the kitchen, boisterous game nights, morning singing and songwriting sessions, and an overall 'what's mine is yours attitude', he makes you feel as if you belonged at his house all along.

Pollox the cat is reserved, but loves rough attention when he's looking for it.  The house is incredibly eclectic and lived-in, and Bob has a habit of collecting memorabilia.

You'll be missing out terribly if all you're looking for is a clean and tidy place to crash."
15108,52845073,2015-11-02,9246967,Mike,Bob's house in Green Lake makes for a great home in Seattle.  The room was exactly as described and Bob went out of his way to make me feel at home.  Highly recommend.
15108,53566511,2015-11-09,15760095,Joseph,"Bob was a friendly and gracious host who communicates efficiently and effectively - he is mature and strikes an excellent balance between giving you your space but also being there if you need him. He is also an excellent source of information about the city's transportation system and anything different, from a tourists perspective, about Seattle. Don't hesitate to book his clean, quaint and well maintained (and sign posted) private room! Pollux the cat is a wonderful companion too! Highly recommended....."
15108,54716158,2015-11-23,9376752,Diane,"We chose Bob's house because of its excellent location near Green Lake. We decided not to stay when we saw that the room was small and dark, next to the shared kitchen and bathroom. There were more people staying in the house than we expected, making the small, over-furnished space claustrophobic. Handwritten signs everywhere and odor of cat box contributed to the unpleasant feel of the house. The advertised hot tub was without water and clearly hadn't been used in a while."
4378803,23914501,2014-12-14,22627068,Chrysta,"The cottage was fantastic and exactly as described.  I had a fantastic stay and wanted for nothing.  The cottage is a block away from one of the best Thai restaurants in the area, which makes cooking in the fantastic, remodeled kitchen completely unnecessary!  There is a great TV and a comfortable couch in the living room, which makes for comfortable, lazy Sundays.  "
4378803,25051161,2015-01-05,3176331,Mary,"Our stay at Patrick's was great. The cottage looks just like the pictures. The neighborhood is great. Quiet but walking distance to shops, grocery stores, trader joes, coffee shops, etc. Everything you need. The decor and remodel is all tastefully done. We would stay again for sure! "
4378803,25910065,2015-01-29,19395815,Caralyn,"I had a wonderful stay at Patrick's cottage. It looks just like the pictures- feels even nicer, thanks to his impressive renovations. The space is at once charming and modern. The beautiful and very functional kitchen occupies nearly half of the living space, and is wide open- great for entertaining or keeping eyes on kids. It is also fully stocked with high end appliances and had lots of dry goods and condiments and spices available.

The location is great as well, and just as reported in the profile. Walk to all kinds of great stuff. I took the rapid line bus to and from work downtown every day with ease. It only takes about 15-20 minutes and they come very often.

As it was winter, the front room was chilly, being mostly antique glass, but  lovely nonetheless!

As a host, Patrick was terrific. The experience was a very private one, but he was always quick to respond to any questions I had, and I knew I could call upon his property manager with any issues that might have come up. But they never did!

It was very clean.

I would absolutely stay there again. "
4378803,26751168,2015-02-18,26074845,Mandy,"This property was awesome! I travelled over 2,000 miles to come to Seattle for the first time and I am very satisfied with my experience! Patrick was a fantastic host and have everything in order for our stay. The property and amenities were great and clean! I would definitely recommend staying here and I would definitely stay again. "
4378803,27937991,2015-03-15,2085149,Simone,"The place was excellent! Clean, safe, easy to get to. Patrick left us an amazing bottle of wine upon our arrival. We didn't need much because everything was laid out beautifully. He made our Seattle trip so special. "
4378803,29850450,2015-04-13,28989045,Harmonie,This was such a gorgeous Cottage! Patrick and his associate made sure I was thoroughly prepared to stay at the house. We were in town for a family wedding and it turned out to be the PERFECT place to be able to have everyone meet and spend some time together. We took the kiddos for walks in the neighborhood and felt completely safe. The upgrades in the house were amazing and I even went home with some ideas for my own home. 
4378803,30301959,2015-04-20,28836902,Charles,"We had a wonderful stay at Patrick's rental! ""Check-in"" was super easy and the house was just like all the great pictures listed. We walked to lots of places and found some nice trails that lead down to the beach. Overall great experience and will definitely stay here again if I return to West Seattle!"
4378803,30780568,2015-04-27,1918135,Michael,"Great place, wonderful location. Walking distance to downtown West Seattle with lots of excellent food and drink options.

The place, though small, feels quite spacious because it's so open. The remodel is excellently done. My one regret is not taking full advantage of the gorgeous kitchen!"
4378803,31185603,2015-05-03,1571098,Khadija,"The house was comfortable and lovely - we had booked extra room for a friend to stay with us one night and its a good thing we didn't come back to the house that night because I'm not sure where she would have slept. There is a sofa in the sun porch but no curtains to draw so it wouldn't have been very private since it is right at the street. BUT besides that, even though somehow either I or airbnb messed up our dates to stay, Winda (Patrick's ""helper"") set it up so I could pay the extra days and not interrupt our visit. I'm not sure why the iPad app doesn't work to well for booking/paying but that is airbnb's glitch...
"
4378803,33075230,2015-05-25,26970702,Brooke,"We couldn't have asked for a better or more perfect place to stay on our honeymoon in West Seattle! We got to meet Patrick on the day we arrived. He and Winda were friendly and helpful with suggestions of things to do in the area. Everything was provided (i.e. linens, paper products, etc.) and the kitchen was stocked with a few necessities and plenty of pans for cooking. We spent some time during the week cooking our meals and enjoying the sunshine on the back deck (furnished with table and chairs). The cottage is right near the main road leading to the bridge that crosses over to downtown. Easy access! It really was the perfect location; it was only 5 minutes from Alki Beach, where we went in the morning for a walk. So beautiful! We had great communication and did not really need anything additional while we were there for a week. I would absolutely recommend this beautiful cottage (and neighborhood) to anyone and would love to stay again when we make another trip out to Seattle. We loved it!! Thank you!!"
4378803,34525261,2015-06-09,28920797,Jaime,"Booking this place and communicating with Patrick and his assistant was a piece of cake. The cottage was perfect for me, my husband and our 5 year old daughter for our weekend getaway in Seattle. Great location near our friends in West Seattle and just the right amount of space. The finishes/furnishings were lovely - Patrick did a great job remodeling/decorating. Especially the kitchen. It was fantastic and we made good use of it. We hope to get the chance to come back soon!"
4378803,34798566,2015-06-12,32686399,Paul,"We were the very first renters of Patrick's downstairs apartment in the hip and relaxed West Seattle neighborhood. I was very impressed throughout the inquiry and booking process with Patrick's rapid, straight-forward, and very proactive approach to communcating in general and in hustling with his remodel making this work out in time for our arrival. It is the kind of customer service approach you would always hope for, both professional and personal.

The property itself was exactly as advertised, and perfect for our needs. The place was immaculate and everything was new. The space is not at all fancy, but has everything needed for a comfortable stay. There is an excellent thai restaurant just down the street along with a microbrewery, and the place is only about 6 blocks away from the main West Seattle drag, which has a number of interesting cafes, bars, and restaurants. 

I couldn't be happier with our experience on all levels, and highly recommend both the place and the fashion in which it is managed.

Thank you for a great start to our trip, Patrick!"
4378803,36167351,2015-06-26,27074822,Linda,"This cottage was awesome. We had 2 adults and 2 kids with plenty of room. The location was so great. Once we got to know the area the first two days, we started to realize how close we were to so many restaurants and the downtown area. We were in walking distance of some restaurants and bars. The accommodations were just as the description stated."
4378803,37736731,2015-07-10,30637851,Christine,"Patrick was a great host.  We had everything we needed for our stay, and the communication was great. The house was very nice and comfortable for our needs.   It's easy to find, easy to park, and within walking distance of a good restaurant.  It's also convenient to grocery and other restaurants.  I highly recommend this home for your stay!"
4378803,45330291,2015-09-01,16499696,Melody,The place was great! It was very clean and cozy. Patrick and his assistants were very communicative the whole time and even put together a cute welcome letter with instructions on how to use things. I would definitely stay here again!
4378803,48727488,2015-09-28,40640232,Cathy,"I loved it.  The kitchen was what I was interested in and it was just as it was described.  I would suggest that Patrick add some BBQ equipment such as a wire brush for cleaning the BBQ grill, tongs, BBQ forks, and maybe a larger table on the deck so we could eat outside on a nice day.  That would be nice .  I brought my own tablecloth to use on the outside table.  All and all it was a wonderful experience and I would rent your place again!  I would like more privacy in the front room.  Maybe you can add pull down shades on the french doors leading out to the front sitting.  At night I felt like I was in a sitting fish bowl.  I liked the pull down shades you had on other windows & wished they were on french doors as well.  I would put the pull down shades behind the sheers so customer can have more privacy in the grand room.   It was a memorable occasion.  P.S.  The cleaning lady was nice but needs to wait until exit time to begin cleaning.  "
4378803,49245098,2015-10-02,36749027,Lea,"Easy access to freeways. Kitchen is big and very functional. Pull out couch wasn't very comfortable according to my mom (it's not a real bed, something to consider if this is an issue for you). Sun room very nice. Nice deep bath. A plus for us since we were doing a lot of running around. Overall, good experience. Nice, private space! We loved having a code entry instead of dealing with a key too!"
6837819,36730457,2015-06-30,36357766,Jacob,Very cute apartment in a perfect location. The apartment was clean and well appointed with nice pillows and a comfy bed. I would stay here again. 
6837819,37387275,2015-07-06,6136797,Adrienne,"The apartment is in a great, beautiful neighborhood, right in the center of it all. There is lots to walk to, and many bus lines to bring you all over the city. A great quiet home base for any exploration of the city. 
Although Tricia was out of town during my stay, she checked in a few times and gave me a local contact should anything major arise. 
This is a great place for a single person or a couple, who are looking to be out and about. You could cook in the kitchen  (the appliances are functional, but old) but probably better suited for people who don't want to eat-in every meal.  "
6837819,46227910,2015-09-08,41282097,Zara,Great little place right in the heart of cap hill. Tricia was very accommodating and allowed us to check in early and check out late. Would definitely recommend this rental if you're thinking to spend a weekend in Seattle. 
2130652,9821276,2014-01-12,892040,Emily,"We had such a perfect stay in Seattle thanks to Luna Farm and this two bedroom treehouse escape.   It was a treat to be so close to all the areas where we were spending time (Capitol Hill, the International District and going to studios in the former Rainier Brewery near Georgetown), without paying for an expensive hotel AND we were able to have our own kitchen and living room.  Cozy and warm (so important in blustery Seattle!), nicely decorated with big, beautiful photos that I think might be Tom's originals. 
 Tom and Gil made sure we had everything we needed, and reminded us we could use the hot tub whenever we wanted.  We never made it there because our trip was so busy, which is a shame, because it looked dreamy. We slept so well in the comfy bed, (there's two but we only needed one), and appreciated being able to do laundry while traveling.  They also have a sweet living room which is where we socialized with friends--there's a roku hooked up to the TV and guests are invited to watch TV using hulu, netflix, amazon prime etc.  
The hosts gave us total privacy, but were also very responsive when I had a question.  This is a terrific place to stay, and we were the first official Air BnB'ers so we want to make sure to get the word out that this is a GREAT option when traveling to Seattle!!   THANK YOU SO MUCH Gil and Tom!!"
2130652,9859341,2014-01-14,274550,Alon,"This place is awesome!  

I stumbled into town after a conference in BC.  Amber was the perfect retreat after a few really hectic days. The place is beautiful, very tastefully designed and super comfortable. It had everything I needed, including a fully equipped kitchen and Netflix on their flat screen. The hot tub is amazing and the energy in the apartment and in Tom and Gil’s yard is tranquil and lovely. Don’t miss out on this gem. I’m totally coming back here next time I’m in town. "
2130652,9870611,2014-01-15,11136323,Yoav,"My wife and I stayed here and had a wonderful experience. The apartment was great. Clean, comfortable, well situated. There were also little details that made the experience even more personalized. They had chocolates for us on the dining room table! On the hall there is a chalkboard where you can leave notes or be creative – stuff like that. We also got to meet our hosts. They were really nice and attentive and made sure we had everything we needed. And then there’s the hot tub! Thanks for a great experience guys!!! "
2130652,9894203,2014-01-17,2971760,Chelsea,"Amber was the perfect place for us on our trip to seattle.  Gil and Tom were fantastic to work with.  Great communication made everything really easy.  The apartment is lovely, clean and very comfortable.  They even had the cupboards stocked with tea and chocolates on the table.  We felt very welcome.  I would definitely stay there again."
2130652,10048629,2014-01-27,1225881,Erin,"The house was lovely, cozy, and perfect for our stay in Seattle!  Tom and Gil were always ready to offer any assistance we might need.  I would tell anyone to use this place and will absolutely use it again!"
2130652,10519727,2014-02-23,2316931,John,"Had a great stay at Gil and Tom's at the end of a west coast tour, a much-needed homey oasis after a week of staying at motels and on friend's couches.  Very convenient location, quite and private, very comfortable beds in appealingly thoroughly red and blue bedrooms...  Only regret is that the weather was juuuust slightly too February-y to try the hot tub!  Although I did take advantage of Gil's massage practice next door, which more than made up for it in terms of mellowing the aches and pains of the road.  Recommended! "
2130652,10598709,2014-02-26,1020130,Reno,Quick business trip to Seattle and found this lovely house in a quiet neighbor. Last minute reservation but Gil and Tom had prepared the room already and the check in could not be easier. All you need in the Unit so I would gladly recommend it. I will definitely come back here as soon I am in Seattle again. Thank you guys. 
2130652,10656854,2014-03-02,11009159,Paul,A cool place and perfect little walk from central Seattle. Great deal from the guys with everything you need in the flat. Thanks again both
2130652,10733244,2014-03-04,2437525,Lisa,Great location with easy door code access. It was cold and rainy outside but warm and inviting inside!
2130652,10934281,2014-03-13,6909592,Scott,Nice quiet neighborhood. Gil and Tom were very accommodating. Very quick communication. Thanks! 
2130652,10968981,2014-03-15,995121,Rose,"A convenient location, centrally located to everything we wanted to do.  The gents were responsive upon check-in and the place represented as shown. Bedrooms were super cozy & comfortable & we had a peaceful sleep!"
2130652,11218622,2014-03-25,11999070,Sheng-Hao,"The place is just awesome!

The apartment was clean, cozy, and well furnished. Highly recommend to those who have short trips in Seattle! Thank Gil and Tom very much!"
2130652,11611558,2014-04-09,11309432,Noel,"We loved the apartment, it was perfect for our visit to Seattle. Large and clean with everything we needed.  Beds seemed super new and extremely comfortable. There was strong wifi, a nice large flat screen with a Roku and even a stereo to play our music. The neighborhood was quiet and close to coffee shops, restaurants and a few watering holes.  Couldn't recommend the apartment more, Gil and Tom are friendly and helpful."
2130652,12000625,2014-04-21,3359934,Greta,"We had a great time at Gil and Tom's place. The  apartment was clean and the location is fantastic!
Towels were provided, and the key code makes check-in so easy.
The kitchen is pretty sparsely outfitted, and the netflix didn't work because someone else was using it, but these are small things. Overall it was a fantastic place, and we will definitely stay there again when we travel to Seattle."
2130652,12115342,2014-04-23,248058,Robert,"This was a terrific airbnb stay!  Definitely one of our best.  Very roomy, and psychically spacious due to thankfully spare decor.  Luscious comfortable beds.  Extremely quiet.  Plenty parking.  Electric carafe for FAST tea water.  Altogether welcoming and easy.  And some of the best BBQ ribs on the West Coast a few blocks away at The Barbeque Pit, E. Cherry and 25th.  When we're in Seattle again we'll come back to Gil and Tom's in a hot minute."
2130652,12335297,2014-04-29,9444005,Josh,Amber is a very warm and welcoming home away from home. Tom and Gil were great hosts and prompt with any communication when needed. Definitely recommend staying here. 
2130652,13102535,2014-05-19,1794139,Ebonie,As pictured; easy & lovely. Do it!
2130652,13479216,2014-05-28,870561,Katrina,"My friends and I had a lovely stay at Gil and Tom's apartment! It had plenty of space for the four of us and was an accommodating place to recharge after a day of exploring. We didn't have a car, but we were able to get around quite easily on foot and by bus. The digital door lock made check-in and check-out a breeze, which was perfect for my group since we didn't all arrive at the same time. The apartment was outfitted with all the amenities we needed and more. I would definitely recommend a stay at Amber when in Seattle!"
2130652,14132193,2014-06-12,2223112,Anthony,"We had a fantastic stay at Tom and Gil's. Though we didn't get to meet our hosts, they were communicative by phone and e-mail as needed. The suite is lovely, with two large bedrooms and a quaint living room and kitchen. We used Lyft to get around the city, but AMBER is in a convenient and central location for getting around virtually anywhere. The check-in process was so simple, and Tom and Gil were able to accommodate our late check-out. Would highly recommend this listing again!"
2130652,14474904,2014-06-20,15271538,Stephen,We really enjoyed our stay at Gil's and Tom's.  Thank you Tom for your restaurant suggestions.  The food at all of the establishments was great.  The Skillet Diner became our go to breakfast spot. Tom also suggested the Ballard Locks.  Really neat.  We love birds.  There were tons of them.  Especially the Great Blue Heron rookery across the way.  We stayed in the upper half of the house.  Nice and clean.  Simply laid out.  It was nice and quiet.  Free parking too.  I would definitely recommend Tom's and Gil's to others.  If we are ever back in Seattle we would definitely try and stay here again.
2130652,14820594,2014-06-27,14847861,Vim,My family and I enjoyed our stay at Gil and Tom's place. A nice place and felt like home! We definitely would go back every time we go to Seattle! Highly recommend this place. I appreciate the hosts for emailing me when they'll be out of town and gave me an alternate to call if I needed anything. Love that I can cook healthy meals for my family. My kids enjoyed netflix and Internet connections. Kept them entertained after long days around the city. Too bad I didn't get to try the massage! Next time;) thanks again!
2130652,15160207,2014-07-03,3416151,Hemant,"Gil & Tom's place was lovely; exactly as described/pictured.  The location is excellent, away from the traffic and noise but very close to downtown Seattle - and there's no need to get on a highway to get there.  The two full bedrooms provided ample space for my wife and I and our daughter (who loved being able to choose between a purple room and a red room!).  The suite was very neat and tidy and accessing it via the code-lock was much more convenient than having to get and return keys.  All in all a spot to be recommended.  The only thing missing was the opportunity to meet our hosts - maybe next time!"
2130652,15615020,2014-07-13,2713214,Rose,"We loved this place. We enjoyed being in a peaceful neighborhood, with friendly faces abounding in Seattle in general. There was a lot of street art everywhere. The beds were super comfy, My partner, our dear friend, and I daydreamed about staying in this home called Amber. And as you may have suspected we had a bit of separation anxiety :-) . I appreciated all that Gil and Tom have done to make our stay comfortable and continue to do to make this place an amazing one. Thank you from the bottom of our hearts. 3 "
2130652,15914420,2014-07-18,5409697,Kahil,"Gil and Tom were great!  Very easy process from beginning to end.  The place was in a nice, central location in a cozy neighborhood.  "
2130652,16017883,2014-07-20,12037021,Lisa,Sparsely furnished but clean and comfortable.
2130652,16197866,2014-07-23,349787,Eric,"We spent three nights in Amber, a very quiet place, beautifully furnished and easily reachable by public transportation. The indications  that Gil and Tom gave us by mail were very clear and the self check in and out was very convenient. 
All in all it was a very good expérience. Moreover Seattle weather was good."
2130652,16776898,2014-08-02,16703018,Dorothy,"Gil and Tom's place was great! It's a clean, well-loved place in a residential area, but it wasn't too far from the things we wanted to do in Seattle. I would definitely recommend this place, and I would definitely stay there again!"
2130652,17037681,2014-08-06,10919568,Eliza,The neighborhood was nice and comfortable. Host kept in touch by texting and email.
2130652,17160013,2014-08-08,17596977,Miguel,Great house in a nice and safe area. Everything was easy although we did  not meet our hosts. I would recommend this place
2130652,17338004,2014-08-11,13667632,Michi,"Stayed here with my husband and my parents. The parking was so easy to find, even though we arrived late at night. Definitely liked the cute little neighbourhood. Getting in and out was really simple with the key code and it was nice not having to worry about losing a key! 
The place was pretty much exactly as we expected from the pictures. The rooms were quite spacious and there was more than enough room for four adults. 
Would definitely stay here again if we find ourselves in Seattle. "
2130652,17558554,2014-08-14,2425279,Kim,Great base to explore Seattle from.
2130652,17773079,2014-08-17,1481031,Tom,"This was a nice, basic apartment (it has everything as advertised) on a quiet residential street - very minimal noise and action on the street.  Depending on the flight paths and time of day, there is some noise from jets taking off and landing.  The apartment was easily accessed with the key pad lock - I really like that type of entrance with a combination because it eliminates the worry about misplacing keys.  Other than the wifi, we did not use any of the digital equipment provided - it all appears to be very up to date and easy to use.  The wifi was very fast.  It was an easy one block walk to the local coffee shop in the morning, which also had a trolley and bus stop.  We were able to either walk or use Uber to get to and from the apartment easily."
2130652,18053058,2014-08-21,1806681,Angela,Apartment is the same as in the descriptions - which is always good. Good neighbourhood coffee houses and eateries. Hosts friendly and helpful.
2130652,18185444,2014-08-23,18170201,Ed,"We really enjoyed our stay at the apartment. It is located in a quiet residential area of Capitol Hill, with easy access to downtown on the #2 bus. Parking on the street was no problem. We arrived a bit early while they were still cleaning, and we appreciated the help with our luggage. The apartment has a small kitchen and dining area with a comfortable living room. Everything was clean and well maintained. We would be happy to stay there again during our next visit to seattle. "
2130652,18525840,2014-08-28,10075247,Alexa,This is a nice place to stay - the beds are very comfortable and the apartment is in a quiet neighbourhood. The digital keypad is a great idea. One not so good point - the bedrooms get very hot in the warm weather. It would be nice to have a few more amenities like and iron and a hairdryer. 
2130652,18870874,2014-09-02,12731361,Natasja,"Gil and Tom made us feel very welcome and accommodated our arrival times. The apartment is in a quiet neighbourhood (although it should be noted it's in the flight path for Seattle airport), is nicely presented and well equipped. We really enjoyed our stay here and would definitely recommend it to others."
2130652,19215971,2014-09-08,19867818,Justin,"The apartment was a great place to stay! Very clean, just as described and the free parking was perfect! Check-in and check-out was incredibly easy. Definitely recommend staying here if you want a great experience in Seattle!"
2130652,19525778,2014-09-14,18906684,Brett,"We only saw the host by accident ,he was friendly courteous and helpful. The description was accurate and the location good."
2130652,19697823,2014-09-16,20700685,Shannon,This experience was great! Excellent home!
2130652,19858381,2014-09-19,14744358,Carina,"Clean, spacious appartement, cozy couch and comfortable bed - nothing to critizise...Check-in/out as easy as it can be. Quiet neighborhood yet close to every kind of nightlife. We did not meet the two hosts, felt really welcome though. "
2130652,19981634,2014-09-21,21333342,Jessica,"My friend Kelly and I were traveling from California and had the pleasure of staying here. It was such a great place! Centrally located and super close to Capital Hill. There were tons of restaurants, shops, bars all within easy walking distance. The house itself was awesome too! We loved the different colored rooms and the backyard and the beds were nice and comfy. I would definitely recommend staying here."
2130652,20091281,2014-09-23,7260664,Ashley,The space was perfect for our needs! Had no issues checking in/out at all! Location was great - we took advantage of the cool morning and had a pleasant walk into downtown. Enjoyed exploring the neighborhood and checking out places like Chuck's Hop Shop and Tuogo Coffee. 
2130652,20422345,2014-09-29,5609049,Kit,"Our booking was easy, and we ""checked in"" simply by using the door code.  The upstairs apartment had plenty of room for the two of us, and the bright red and bright blue bedrooms were fun.   The kitchen was totally adequate, and bright and sunny besides.  We appreciated the Wi-Fi, the extra towels, toaster, and electric teapot.  The whole place is clean and spiffed up.  Love the huge photos on the walls, and the blackboard in the hall.
We were in Seattle for a weekend at Seattle Yoga Arts, and we enjoyed our 20 minute walk though a well lighted neighborhood.  Luna Farm is also a 15 minute walk from Trader Joe's and the Madison Market.  We thoroughly enjoyed being able to leave our car at the Luna Farm and walk."
2130652,20883507,2014-10-06,16719488,William,Jon stayed in contact through email and was very responsive. This duplex apartment was great for the price
2130652,21004085,2014-10-09,292741,Deep,"Perfect for what we required. The house was just as described. We traveled with our 6 month old and another friend. All the rooms were very spacious and clean. We did not use the kitchen all that much for cooking but  all the basics were there if needed. We really enjoyed the entertainment system. The location could not have been better. We travelled by car and parking was not a problem. The house is on a quiet street and we felt very safe walking at night. There are great cafes, bars and restaurants within walking distance. Driving into downtown and to Sea-tac was quick and easy too. We would definitely stay again when in Seattle. "
2130652,21227523,2014-10-13,11919744,Andrew,"The place was just as advertised--clean, spacious, bright, and quiet.  The furniture is a bit out of date and raggedy, but we spent all our days out in the city and didn't hangout in the family room a whole lot, so it wasn't a big deal.

The neighborhood is great--quiet enough for travelers in on business, but close enough to capitol hill, first hill, cherry hill, and the international district for the traveler seeking nightlife and entertainment. 

Great cafe down the block on Union, as well as a great beer shop/taproom.  A pot shop just went in down on 23rd as well (albeit a controversial location next to a church) if you're looking to try the legal market for the first time during your visit. 

The code to the front door was easy, and the kitchen was spacious and great for breakfast in the morning. 

I would recommend this space as a great central location from which to see Seattle in an up-and-coming neighborhood. "
2130652,21681775,2014-10-21,22275956,Melissa,"My husband, son and I enjoyed our stay at Luna Farm. It has a bright, cheery interior and there's plenty of destination information available on the coffee table. We found our way easily to the local restaurants and it was a reasonable yet comfortable walk into downtown Seattle. It was also really easy to find the home and there was no problem with parking either. It was great to see a squirrel run up the tree outside the bedroom too :) .Thanks for a hassle free stay."
2130652,21960082,2014-10-27,11558950,Mayra,"We had a really great time at Luna Farm. The beds were really comfortable, and the house felt cozy in general. The neighborhood was quiet and close to cafes, and just a short UBER trip away from downtown and walking distance from a lot of great restaurants and bars. We didn't meet our hosts, but they were quick to respond to our questions via text. We'd definitely stay here again!"
2130652,22306071,2014-11-03,12604601,David,"The stay was fantastic. The aparment is in a great location, close to the fun on Cap Hill. Apartment was exactly as described. If visiting Seattle again, this will probably be the first place I check."
2130652,23021120,2014-11-20,17057653,Ashley,"Cozy atmosphere. Perfect amount of space for 2-4 people. Great kitchen amenities. Great location-just outside of the loud hustle and bustle of Cap Hill, yet close enough to prevent any inconvenience. 

Loved it here. Would definitely come back! "
2130652,23446283,2014-12-01,12207786,Genevieve,"Really nice place! Perfect for the four of us. The neighborhood was lovely, and was relatively close to downtown. They were accommodating and there if needed. 
Would certainly recommend to friends staying in the Seattle area. "
2130652,24508715,2014-12-29,22869558,Xiaofeng,"The 2 bed-room suite is awesome! It's clean and cozy. I love the kitchen a lot. It has complete set of cooking utensils. The hosts are responsive about the text messages and very helpful. The neighborhood is very quite and I feel quite safe. Very convenient location, closed to all attractions in downtown (10 mins drive at most). Will definitely come back if visit Seattle next time."
2130652,25320988,2015-01-12,1979441,Eric,"This was a great place, lots of room, no hassle to get to, it has a sense of home and is the perfect place for a Seattle get away - definitely a place I will stay in again when I am in the area "
2130652,25392414,2015-01-14,25437919,Geoffrey,"This is an amazing place to stay. The house is beautiful, well-furnished, and located in a great neighborhood not too far from downtown and other cool neighborhoods. Everything is exactly as described on their listing, so we'll definitely recommend Gil & Tom (& Jon)'s place to all our friends. "
2130652,25810778,2015-01-26,2935481,Jill,"We were so happy with our experience at Gil and Tom's place. The description of the place was quite accurate. Instructions were very detailed and helpful. We were all quite comfortable. 

Our situation is a little unique in that we live in Seattle, but needed a place for a few nights while we do some work on our house. This was very convenient for us. I can also say, as someone who lives in the area, that Tom and Gil's house is in an amazing location. Walking distance to bars, co-op grocery, independent cinema, cafes, etc. If you're visiting from out of town, you'll be very happy with this location. "
2130652,25916583,2015-01-29,524198,Dan,"Loved this place -- roomy, cozy, and a great spot! 
"
2130652,25974282,2015-01-31,2935481,Jill,Our stay was just as pleasant as last time. See my earlier review. 
2130652,26486715,2015-02-14,25802217,Nick,We had a great week in Seattle. The house was nicely positioned with just a short 10 minute walk to the Union St area with lots of great bars and restaurants. There's even an old corner store at the end of the road which is now a pub with over 50 beers on tap! The house was easy to find with great communication from the owner and with a key code entry meant we could just go straight in when we arrived. It was a little dated inside but very functional and had exactly what we needed. Fantastic value for the price. Would certainly come back here again!
2130652,26740748,2015-02-18,453622,Luis,This is my second time staying at this property. Stayed over the summer and loved it so much that I decided to come back again. Really great property in a wonderful location. A lot of great places to eat within walking distance and close to what you want to do. The apartment was clean. Jon was great with communication. Would highly recommend this place.
2130652,26962318,2015-02-22,27127593,Ryan,"Wonderful place in a great neighborhood. Beds were comfortable. Everything was clean. If I'm ever back in Seattle, I know where I'm going. "
2130652,27253135,2015-03-01,4956812,Nikki,"Myself, my partner and two friends stayed in this lovely apartment for a week while visiting Seattle. It was definitely spacious and comfortable enough for two couples to stay in. The neighbourhood felt safe and was only a short stroll to the main Capitol Hill area. Jon's communication with us was fantastic – always a speedy reply and so helpful. If we even come back to Seattle, I would not hesitate to stay here again!"
2130652,27793003,2015-03-12,11517267,Musab,"The house is in a reasonable location, a 30-40 minute walk away from downtown.

The beds are comfortable. 

The floors/walls are quite thin - so when there are people being noisy downstairs you can hear everything. 

The parking is on-street, so nothing stops you from parking in this area and simply staying elsewhere (you don't need a car to explore downtown Seattle). "
2130652,27949132,2015-03-15,9349294,Allan,"The flat is lovely, on a quiet street a short walk to all the necessities--good coffee, good food, good beer. All went very smoothly. We would happily return."
2130652,28588262,2015-03-26,29755908,Pam,"What a great stay! 
We've been to Seattle and stayed at hotels downtown before - we nearly starved. Turns out that Seattle is all about the neighborhoods. And Central District is fantastic. We walked a lot. Had lots of good food and coffee. I don't like to eat or have coffee at the same place twice when I'm visiting another city. We had lots of options. 
The house was nice, clean and quiet. Very comfortable. We didn't bother with the buses since we had plans to see a bunch of things all over town. 
The beds were comfy. Plenty of pots, pans, plates etc. The refrigerator was clean (there was a pitcher of cold water waiting for us). 
This was the first time we ever AirBnB'ed. We are looking forward to our next trip already.
"
2130652,28786062,2015-03-30,23666586,Kyle,"This place was great--the neighborhood was beautiful and quiet. It is a short walk to the #2 bus line, which was very convenient. The cherry blossoms all along the street were in full bloom. Inside, there were a great many power outlets (always a plus), and the fridge and kitchen really made spending time there so pleasant and affordable. The other reviewer's positive descriptions were all very accurate!"
2130652,28985016,2015-04-02,9911141,Urs,"We had a great stay at this nice cozy and spacious apartment. Pretty close to downtown, we could easily walk there, and there are busstops nearby. The kitchen was big, the living room comfortable."
2130652,29668412,2015-04-11,7635949,Mj,Luna farm was spacious and comfortable. It has all the amenities one would need. The place is just as pictured. The location is great and close to downtown. Jon was very accommodating to us and replied whenever we needed him. 
2130652,29844093,2015-04-13,3646486,Peter,"The townhouse was in a quiet neighborhood. It was easy to check-in and -out. We asked to check-in earlier because we arrived in Seattle at 10 AM and we were able to check-in at 2:30 PM. It was about a 45 minute walk to the Pike Market Place and 30 minute walk to Chinatown. 
The only downside was the urine/wet towel smell in the bathroom and living room. Not sure if it was because it was an older townhouse or the cleaning crew didn't do their job this time. Also, the kitchen table and one of the chairs were sticky. "
2130652,30543286,2015-04-24,12585787,Kacy,"We had a great time at Luna Farm. We came to Seattle to visit a friend and wanted to avoid a hotel stay. We loved having our own rooms, each with a very comfy bed! We enjoyed the neighborhood very much! Every morning I walked a few blocks to Katy's Corner Cafe for latte's! What a great experience! We are hoping to make it back soon!"
2130652,31032794,2015-05-01,15371009,Ross,"Very nice apartment in a quiet neighborhood.  Quick and easy check in and very secure door.  Very good place to drop your bags and enjoy the city.  A couple of issues:
1.  No screens in the windows so didn't want to open the windows overnight 
2.  Air in apartment smelled stale for a first day or so but that may be due to the lack of window opening
3.  Back yard was very overgrown so we couldn't use the back yard area (if this was not ours to use then that's ok)

All in all wonderful experience and a great little spot.  Thanks again!"
2130652,31906060,2015-05-11,19012488,Karendotsin,It's very convenience. driving time to Pike Place Market takes us 15 mins local driving time. Nice and clean. 
2130652,34881810,2015-06-13,4444175,Jessica,"We arrived on our first night at Luna Farm to an extremely warm apartment. Thinking the AC was broken we reached out to learn that the apartment didn't have AC but only a system that circulates the air. This would have been great to know prior to arrival from our host but we completely understood that the weather was out of their hands but some prior knowledge would have been helpful that the apartment would be hot. The apartment seemed clean but worn down. The fridge had rotting vegetables in it and both beds had on thick comforters during this hot stay (no top sheets). After a first restless night we decided to find a hotel and reached out to Jon. With such quick response, we didn't hear back for on this message for a good 12 hours. "
2130652,35770600,2015-06-22,11921753,Catherine,"A true gem in a great neighborhood! Grateful to our hosts for kindly allowing us to drop off our luggage, leaving us free to explore Seattle. Nearby on Union St is Chuck's Hop Shop - a variety of food trucks throughout the day with amazing eats, which can be enjoyed with a huge variety of local beers. The house itself Felt warm and inviting with thoughtful gestures throughout. Slept soundly in very comfortable beds. Extremely accessible to downtown with bus routes nearby and everyone we met were really friendly and helpful."
2130652,36111749,2015-06-25,34076160,云,"Everything is nice and clean. The bedrooms are beautiful! The neighborhood are quiet. The only thing to notice is that the road in front of the house is quite narrow and full of parked vehicles. Sometime, it might be hard to find a decent parking spot. "
2130652,36944236,2015-07-03,230759,Kevin,"We really enjoyed our time in this apartment.  The beds were comfortable and the television had tons of options.  The kitchen was a nice size and the shower was great too.  Bring your own toiletries.  Also check in and locking up was super easy!

It was unseasonably hot in Seattle and we were uncomfortable at times but they installed air conditioners in the bedrooms the day before we left and that really helped.  The space should be comfortable for the rest of the summer.  

There was good parking and I would recommend having a car in this location. We walked to the Safeway and took the bus to downtown, so we did it without a car, but I would probably rent a car or be prepared for a longish walk to restaurants and nightlife (of course it was in the 90s when I was there so every walk seemed long).

In general this was a great option for those needing more room than a hotel room.  "
2130652,37447960,2015-07-07,3910708,Ramon,"The apartment is located in convenient neighborhood only a few miles away from downtown. It took us 10-15 minutes of driving to get to Pike Place. Unfortunately arriving late in the evening the neighborhood seemed a little sketchy and lots of cops were around which isn't always a great sign. But on the plus side the check-in was very simple, punched in the code and walked in, it was nice not having to worry about carrying a key around. 

Here are some pros and cons for this place:

Pros:
- close to downtown
- quiet neighborhood
- AC in room was great (it was 90+ during our stay)
- easy check-in/out
- TV/sound system/Roku
- comfortable beds

Cons:
- doesn't look like the best neighborhood but we didn't have any issues
- It was hot when we arrived
- windows have no screens, and one was left open so there were mosquitos and moths around the house... took a few hours to get rid of them!
- kitchen could be cleaner, the floor was sticky 
- same for the bathroom, it's a little run down
- no sheets underneath the comforters but they looked clean
- the bedroom light bulb was out

I think overall this is a decent place. The convenient location made up for most of the problems we had. We briefly met Tom and he seems like a great guy. Thanks for hosting us!"
2130652,37654864,2015-07-09,9266292,Rob,"Really enjoyed our stay. It was centrally located for our visit and easy to get to all over Seattle. Jon was very responsive, helpful and hospitable. The place was clean and everything was in working order. The beds were comfortable.  We would stay here again.
"
2130652,38837383,2015-07-19,9668016,Stacey,"Though we never met our hosts - they left a clean and tidy home for us to stay in. Check in and out was simple. Neighborhood, quiet with a few shops and bars within walking distance. Their beds and air conditioning were welcome comfort after a full day of exploring (using some of the reference maps they provided in the living area). 
We did eat once at the apartment and found all we needed (dishes, silverware, filtered water, cookie tray, etc.). 
Great time in Seattle - thanks Luna Farm.

2130652,40427081,2015-07-31,29894600,Ashley,"What a great time we had at Luna farm. Traveling the west coast with my husband, sister and 3 year old son it was the perfect location. We could walk to trader joes for groceries, dinner in Capitol Hill and easy public transport into Seattle and to the gorgeous madora park! The apartment is clean and spacious and the added bonus of Netflix etc was brilliant for keeping peeps entertained while others got ready for the day. Jon was a very attentive host and helped us with everything we needed. Shout out to Katy's coffee shop which is a 3 min walk away, great staff and great coffee! Stay at Luna farm! "
2130652,41070849,2015-08-04,32206044,Matthew,"Our experience was awesome! Place was quiet, centrally located, had everything we needed.  Loved the roku so we could watch Netflix.  the keypad lock was easy to use.  having the ac units in the rooms were great."
2130652,41322961,2015-08-07,21362467,Milena,The apartment was very nice and we enjoyed our stay! Its near to the center and the neighborhood is very quiet and pretty. Also there are some good restaurants near to the apartment.
2130652,42426659,2015-08-13,38160726,Sheela,"I had a great experience staying at Amber for the past couple of days. I only got to meet Jon briefly, but he was very responsive to texts. The apartment was as described, and very clean and well kept, plus they provided wi-fi and Netflix which was nice for when we just wanted to chill after a day of travelling. Overall I'd strongly recommend staying here! "
2130652,42669857,2015-08-15,1658688,Cory,We had a great stay! The blackberry bushes in the back had some of the most sweet and ripe berries I've ever had :) Jon was really responsive as well. Would definitely recommend. 
2130652,43213862,2015-08-18,27422056,Clare,"Lovely spacious apartment in a quiet, residential area. The hosts were very going at keeping in touch before our arrival. Comfortable beds, good internet and Netflix.
The apartment was fairly clean but could do with sprucing up.
Good bus service (we got from the airport via Link/bus in about 40 minutes - fantastic) and we walked into town a couple of times; if you enjoy walking it's not far at all.
Great restaurant recommendations from the guys. 10 minutes walk to Marjorie's and Skillet Diner which are both fantastic. We also went to The Lark which is not far away and was a really special meal out.
Overall, great value."
2130652,44550545,2015-08-27,28838754,Eb,"Luna Farm is just about perfect: it's quiet, well-located, with lots of light and amenities.  We had no problem checking in and coming/going using the keypad lock.  We easily Uber''d our way around a city we'd never visited before.  
I did email the hosts beforehand asking about restaurant recommendations, and didn't hear back (although that didn't slow us down). 
I would recommend Luna Farm for anyone visiting Seattle!"
2130652,45567279,2015-09-04,13959202,Florian,"Très joli appartement, spacieux et ensoleillé. Tout le nécessaire s'y trouve sur place. Je n'ai pas croisé l'hôte, mais il est disponible par message sans soucis.
Je recommande !"
2130652,45778108,2015-09-06,33339257,Alex,"we stayed two nights at AMBER - the place is in a quiet neighborhood and you have the
whole place to yourself. great amenities and clean rooms, very helpful house manager Jon! 
we can fully recommend this place for a stay in Seattle - well suited even for an extended stay!! thanks for the awesome time!"
2130652,48867803,2015-09-29,588190,Jackson & Kayla,"First thing: Jon was fantastic! The dryer was not functioning properly, so Jon was more than accommodating by offering to pick up my clothing after it had been washed to bring to his home and dry. He then dropped the clothing back to me. Saved me a few days of wearing dirty clothing!

The house is in a great location! Very safe neighborhood that is very close to he downtown area and all of the attractions. Very easy to catch public transit, can, Uber from here. Lots of food choices within walking distance.

The house is comfortable; basic, but completely suited our needs. It was clean and the area was safe and quiet. 

We had a great experience staying here :)"
2130652,49587963,2015-10-05,30076943,Emlyn,We had a great stay here. The apartment was comfortable and had everything we needed. It was a great location for walking or getting the bus to downtown and Capitol Hill. It was nice to stay in a quiet neighborhood after being in the city all day.
2130652,53462406,2015-11-09,11053008,Kara,"The beds were clean and very comfortable, and they had lots of kitchen utensils (pots, pans, dishes) available for use.  The addition of the TV with Netflix was really nice too.  The location was ideal within a 6 min walk to buses, and a really cool cinema down the street.  We also really liked Katy's corner cafe.  I was very happy with my stay here and my friends were too.  "
2130652,54848237,2015-11-25,10140120,John,"Great space. We were only there for a few nights, but parking was easy, location was good and the four of us (two couples) had plenty of space to not be tripping over each other. Would definitely stay again. "
2130652,55525020,2015-12-01,19388904,Kent,"Easy check-in, nice place, no problems."
2130652,55670212,2015-12-04,48295650,Alvina,Nice place in Seattle. Close to all the touristy areas and had parking in the back. It was clean and had a kitchen if you felt like cooking.
2130652,55794797,2015-12-06,35732466,Jose,"Right when we walked in there was a giant sign that said welcome and I thought that was pretty cool. Didn't really get to talk much cause I arrived to the house late but they made it real easy to communicate. I was really confused about how the whole check in thing but we communicated through text well so that was cool. Honestly Im not really into writing reviews but this house was cozy and felt like home. It is accurate to how its described on the page. 10/10 cozy home.
The neighborhood is so nice too, it reminded me of some movie type stuff with all the trees and nice homes ! "
2130652,56614474,2015-12-15,6547772,Heather,"The apartment was in a lovely little neighborhood, walking distance to grocery shopping and an awesome little beer shop/bar complete with food truck.  Parking was a breeze (street parking was easy, in addition to the private spaces provided), which was one of the big draws for the property in the first place.  It was quiet, and close enough to the city center (Pike's, Space Needle, etc.) to walk if you're ambitious, or a few minute's drive if you're not.  The Netflix/Hulu/etc. were super convenient.  Jon was very responsive but in no way intrusive.

The beds was to die for; seriously, one of the most comfortable beds I've ever had the fortune of sleeping on.  We slept great!

The other appointments of the apartment were average; somewhat like a student flat.  The couch was serviceable but not comfortable, the bathroom was also serviceable, but not luxurious.  The kitchen could have held a few more cooking implements, and again was adequate, but not great.  There were a few minor maintenance issues (doors not latching, that sort of thing) that while annoying did not ruin our stay.

In all, an adequate property, nicely situated, averagely appointed."
2130652,56773932,2015-12-18,3475941,Ruoxi,"We had a great stay at Luna Farm. The neighborhood is quiet and safe, with lots of good restaurants nearby, and the public transportation is quite convenient. If we have another chance to visit Seattle, Luna Farm will be on the top of our list."
571640,1794492,2012-07-24,2589539,Zaira,"Keith&Cherie were great hosts!Keith picked us up at the busstation and took us to town at night for a tour through the nightlife of Seattle. It was great!Cherie helped us with the laundry, we had it all washed and dryed in the evening, thank u very much!!!It was awesome, clean&uncomplicated, I would recommend to stay there any time!"
571640,1973260,2012-08-13,2376943,Laurie,"Keith was flexible and pleasant to work with, though only through phone and emails.  I never met him -- he wasn't there when we arrived nor up when we arose the next morning.  Room was clean, bed comfortable, but place was in a bit of disrepair.  $80 seemed high for what it was.  "
571640,2087215,2012-08-24,3332493,Eric,"My family and I stayed w/ Keith for 2 nights while we were in Seattle, and had a great experience. Keith went above and beyond the call of being a good host. The rooms were clean and he was very respectful, friendly, and knowledgable about the city and what it had to offer. "
571640,5132838,2013-06-14,3382055,Linden,"Prez was a very kind and charismatic host! We had only stayed there for one night, but all our needs were met and everything went accordingly.
"
571640,9837983,2014-01-13,10856192,Eun Kyeong,"First of all Prez is a nice host.
and the room we were staying in was very warm and comfortable. the kitchen, bathroom and living room was also cool. 
Although the location of the home is quite far from downtown, it's not a big deal. You can find a train station near their home."
571640,9922240,2014-01-19,8619898,Kimberly,"We stayed at Prez & Cherie's for one night this weekend and both of us agree that it was the best AirBnb we've stayed at thus far.  From the moment we entered, Prez was very hospitable, offering us chicken soup and beverages.  He has a shuttle business and offered us a ride downtown, and even picked us up at the end of the night!  We were so grateful for that.  I highly recommend staying here if you're planning a trip to Seattle."
571640,36496686,2015-06-28,28994130,Trevor,"Prez and Cherie were FANTASTIC. 

We ended up in a bind and needed a new place to stay super last minute. We found their listing and even though they were on vacation themselves they helped us out more then I ever thought possible.

We were able to access the place via keypad lock on the front door. The place was spotless and super clean. Downtown was about a 7 dollar uber. Could not have had a better experience!

Would definitely stay with them again and would highly recommend!!

11411,26006,2010-02-13,79429,Tom & Megan,"We really enjoyed our stay. Room was nice & comfortable, french press, xcellent coffee, micro, frig& iron.  Bathroom was in hall, but it didn't seem to infringe on our privacy.  A little xtra noise as houses do have, venilation was a little stuffy but we cracked the window a little. Close to Northgate Mall,cute area, nice little crepe resturant in the area."
11411,29774,2010-03-16,78710,James,"It was an excellent experience.  It’s like staying in a 4 Stars place ran by a buddy – quiet, nice and safe neighborhood, nice coffee, nice soap, satellite TV.  We felt Amy’s hospitality even though she was not there; Janice took great care of us.  The bed we slept in, for the first night, was too soft for our backs; Janice switched us to another room right away.  All smiles.  Hopefully we’ll meet you next time, Amy & Joey. -- James & Vivian, Vancouver, B.C."
11411,35686,2010-04-15,81368,Samantha,"Our experience at Amy and Joey's was perfect. It was an extremely comfortable, beautiful room; it was easy access to the city, and overall a wonderful experience. We felt blessed to find such an amazing place to stay in Seattle. On our next trip out west we wouldn't think of staying anywhere else!

-Samantha & Alex"
11411,39608,2010-05-02,115801,Asad,"EXCELLENT Place to stay! Close to everything. The room and hospitality was 5 star! Will definitely stay again and highly recommended.
very nice and safe neighbourhood!"
11411,45668,2010-05-24,96213,Maria,My room and private bathroom was like a little bit of luxury and Joey was great with information and all round hospitality.  Probably even better if you have a car but there is a bus stop nearby for going downtown. 
11411,49554,2010-06-04,91063,Betsy,"We were so happy with our first experience with Airbnb! The room was spacious, comfortable, clean and pretty! The neighbourhood was gorgeous and felt very homey and safe. My daughter and I walked a short few minutes to the bus and went downtown and to the U district easily. The special extras like coffee, tea, filtered water and getting laundry done were the cherry on top! Thanks to Katie who was great as Joey and Amy had to go out of town. This really is like a wonderful hotel suite and MUCH better than sharing a dorm room with 10 other people for the same price! Highly recommended and thanks for everything!"
11411,59230,2010-06-30,119054,Joy-Alonica,"Staying at Amy & Joey's was a wonderful experience. The place is so clean, accommodating, and serene. They really respect your privacy which I appreciated. I would definitely stay here again!"
11411,76824,2010-08-11,164584,Peni & Danny,"Amy was so nice and promptly answered all questions from the get-go. Joey checked us in and made us feel welcome. The place is beautiful, clean, and comfortable. The plush robes, organic french press coffee, laundry, and hot/cold water dispenser were icing on the cake!

The neighborhood is safe and beautiful in walking distance of coffee shops and restaurants.

We will def stay here again although I think we'll go for the other room because the bed is much comfier. (We snuck a peek.) ;)

Thank you Amy & Joey!"
11411,80762,2010-08-18,177750,Chris,"Amy and Joey are amazingly helpful and made us feel at home in Seattle. With the large, well-decorated, spotless room and little extras like bath robes and amazing tea, they went above and beyond the call of duty."
11411,87743,2010-08-31,153533,Betty,"From first contact to last, Amy and Joey were attentive, helpful, and warm. They left wonderful coffee and tea for me. The room was clean, well-supplied with dishes and cutlery and the bed was comfortable. Since I was hanging with people who live only a mile away, it was a very convenient location for me. Thanks, Amy & Joey. I will definitely stay here again. "
11411,93704,2010-09-09,177675,Susie,Had a splendid stay at Amy and Joey's place. The room was immaculate and the fresh coffee was very welcome after a long journey! The bathroom was beautiful and the towels were super soft. Highly recommeded!
11411,95153,2010-09-12,176408,S,"our hosts were amiable and helpful.  we enjoyed the lodging but the location was too far out of town for us---no car!  we are older, so the steps into the house and the room were a lot and the bus route has been moved blocks over, which added more to our commute time (25 minutes on the bus).

thank goodness for the cloud coffee shop and the piccolino (sp?) restaurant(both on roosevelt), where we ate 3 nights out of three and were super impressed with the food!"
11411,98033,2010-09-16,115072,Lynne,"WE HAD A LOVELY TIME AT JOEY AND AMY'S AND FELT VERY WELCOME.  I HAD A SPECIAL BIRTHDAY AND THEY GAVE ME A BIRTHDAY CARD AND SOME COOKIES WHICH WAS A NICE TOUCH.

THE ROOM AND FACILITIES WERE EXCELLENT - JUST AS YOU SEE IN THE PHOTOGRAPH.  ALTHOUGH WE DIDN'T HAVE A CAR IT WAS EASY TO GET INTO DOWNTOWN SEATTLE BY BUS.

WE WERE DISAPPOINTED NOT TO MEET AMY BUT OTHER THAN THAT WE WOULD CERTAINLY RECOMMEND IT AS A PLACE TO STAY."
11411,102479,2010-09-21,237973,Julia,"Amy and Joey are wonderful.  They took care of us on short notice, and the room was comfortable and spacious.  Amy was kind and absolutely delightful.  She put up with my inability to use the hot water dispenser and supplied us with wonderful French press coffee.  They rate a five plus- I recommend them highly and with much appreciation and gratitude. "
11411,103781,2010-09-24,160409,J R,"Great place to stay.  A little out of town, but very easy to get to.  Quite and the area seems very safe.  Would stay here again next time in Seattle.  Thanks Kids!"
11411,107322,2010-09-28,214353,Nancy,"Tremendous value.  Amy and Joey were great hosts.  The room and bath were spacious and impeccably clean.  I had all the amenities I needed complete with fridge, microwave, hairdryer, shampoo, etc.  They even offered to do laundry if needed.  It was like a hotel (complete with bathrobes even!), but more personable and private.  It was a great home away from home.  I will return again!"
11411,114045,2010-10-08,202675,Billie,My mom & I really enjoyed our stay at Amy & Joey's place. Everything is exceptionally clean & comfortable. Nice quiet neighborhood. We will definitely stay again!
11411,153586,2010-12-14,159921,Amanda,"The room was great, beautiful decor, very clean, and well appointed.  There were little extras at this place I have not found at others.  I had my own private bathroom which was wonderful after a week of travelling.  Amy and Joey did a load of laundry for me which was great but I would have been happy to do it myself.  I only saw Joey when I checked in but he said I could contact he or Amy at any time should I need anything additional.  The property is located a fair distance from downtown but if you know the bus schedule it is easy enough to get into town with a bus stop just a couple of blocks away or it is approximately $25.00 cab fare.  I have received an email within 24 hours following my departure from Amy which I thought was great follow up. I would recommend this property to other prospective travellers.  It was great."
11411,182817,2011-02-15,366761,Mark,"Amy and Joey have a great set-up. The room was gorgeous: tasteful decor, extremely comfortable bed. 

This was my first airBnB experience and I would definitely do it again based on my experience with these guys. I highly recommend you come stay with these guys"
11411,192057,2011-03-04,20733,Olman,"We loved Joey's place.beautiful,clean,quiet residential neighborhood still really close to the city.The room itself was spacious and clean(you should see the house it's amazing:).Had a great experience, definitely will stay again and recommend to our friends."
11411,197469,2011-03-12,427676,Tim,"The house is at a convenient location in a safe, quiet neighborhood.  We appreciated the extra touches such as the convenience of a chilled water dispenser and extra sink in the room, comfortable bed, and tasteful decor.  Joey was a gracious host and we would enjoy staying there again."
11411,334696,2011-06-26,460731,Kathleen,"Joey's place was a perfect location for visiting my friends and relatives in Lake Forest Park.I definitely needed a car to really get around, but realized that ahead of time.

A friend of Joey's let me in, wasn't sure which room was mine. Bathroom is across the hall, not the best setup for me (shared) but nice and clean. Luckily no one had the other room the first two (website hidden) did not work until I finally caught Joey on the third day and he rescued the remote from downstairs. 

I didn't need any tourist info so it was fine to be left alone the first two days. I left early and came back around nine. 

No Amy, only Joey and friend. "
11411,427956,2011-08-08,661471,Don,"Nice, well furnished, quiet, great location.  Had a nice experience staying at Joey's.  Seemed like we were the only ones in the house since we seldom saw or heard anyone else.  Bus stop to downtown Seattle was very close to the house.  Several nice pubs within walking distance.  We'll be back!!"
11411,467474,2011-08-22,970941,Blaine,We stayed at Jess & Joeys place while we were hunting for an apartment in the area. The room was very nice and suited our needs perfectly. I will continue to recommend their house to friends and family looking to visit Seattle.
11411,475204,2011-08-25,790562,Tereza,"Staying at Joey's place was our first airbnb experience and we really enjoyed it. Joey's house is situated in a quiet and safe neighborhood not far from downtown (there's a bus stop located half a minute away and the ride to the heart of Seattle takes about 20 minutes). There is also a Safeway store in a walking distance, which can be reached in approx. 10-15 minutes. We had absolute privacy, the room is spacious, nicely furnished, equipped with a comfortable bed and both the room and the private bathroom are superclean! The pre-arrival communication with Jessica was also smooth and swift. During our stay, we met Joey twice and he was very nice and helpful. We highly recommend this place!"
11411,531069,2011-09-14,958310,Judith,"The room and bath were very clean with plenty of towels and products.
The bed was extra comfortable.
They were kind enough to do a load of wash for us.
Joey and his wife were very nice.
We were very happy their was a bus stop very close."
11411,3893113,2013-03-25,4167607,Dane,"Jess and Joey's place is great: convenient, beautiful, clean and accomodating (Jess offered to provide my parents with their oh-so-necessary morning coffee!).   They're great hosts as well.  If you have sensitivites or allergies to scented products, this would not be a good fit for you, as Joey's (exquisite) salon is on the main floor and has lots of scented products.  This was not an issue for my parents, however, who thoroughly enjoyed their stay!"
11411,4688850,2013-05-20,6225704,Ann,"It was a very nice stay, everything is perfect! Thanks Jess and Joey!and had a nice haircut in the studio !"
11411,5396670,2013-06-28,5667641,Zack And Kaytlin,"A very good stop for us. Professional, accommodating and easy hosts. Over the top ""service"" and room amenities. Great place to stay"
11411,6247790,2013-08-05,1027459,Emmie,"Jess and Joey were wonderfully responsive and helpful hosts! The room we stayed in was clean and peaceful, and their house was in a convenient location. I would consider staying with them again the next time I am in Seattle."
11411,6544859,2013-08-16,3127086,Claudia,"We were only in Seattle a few days and we are so glad that we  stayed with Jess & Joey.  Although they rent out more than one room, we barely heard or saw any one else, and felt we had privacy necessary to feel comfortable.  Their home is in a convenient location and it was easy to get downtown quickly.  They are also just a quick drive away from Green Lake park, which was the perfect location for my morning training runs.  I met Joey briefly before we left and he was super friendly.  I would definitely recommend staying with Jess and Joey when visiting the Seattle."
11411,7003956,2013-09-02,7317455,Shannon,"The private room and private bath was wonderful and didn't feel like a shared living space. Very clean, private, and a great place to stay!! Jess and Joey were very responsive. I would definitely stay here again!"
11411,7173223,2013-09-09,8262313,Frank,A nice first stay in the States after a long travel from Amsterdam. The room is comfortable and so is the bathroom. The bed is amazing! Key was under the mat and we didn t see anyone in the house. It felt like we had the whole space for our own. We went by bus to downtown Seattle using the transportation coupons which allows you to travel 1 time for free. Excellent stay!
11411,7965398,2013-10-10,5939504,Sarah,"I had a very comfortable 6-day stay in Seattle.  Great location close to Victory Heights, Maple Leaf, Northgate, and Lake City neighborhoods.  Easy to find, easy check-in and check-out, comfortable bed, clean room.  The private bath is outside the room (Room 2) and across the hall, but I never saw any of the other guests.  Nice hot shower, but the drain is slow.  WiFi was fast and easy to get connected.  Great hotel alternative!"
11411,9360647,2013-12-23,10336152,Colby,"I enjoyed my short stay at Jess and Joey's home. They were both out of town while I was there so I didn't get a chance to meet them in person, but communication over e-mail was timely and helpful. The room was very nice and I have no complaints. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend their place to a friend. "
11411,9572658,2014-01-02,10552562,Max,"Wow. My stay was wonderful. Jessica and Joey have thought of absolutely everything in terms of making the room completely comfortable and fully equipped. My stay was over a week, and I think I ran into one or two people the whole time, so privacy was as advertised, which was also very nice. Really, I can't say enough nice things. These hosts have their game down. Super friendly and fast in communication. Excellent."
11411,9902683,2014-01-18,10493489,Lleliena,"Jess & Joey are excellent hosts! This B&B is one of the best I have ever been to. The place is clean, warm and cozy modern. The neighborhood is amazing, too! My trip to Seattle was spontaneous and both Jess & Joey were extremely flexible with me...and most important...approachable! I recommend their place 101%! 

"
11411,11372649,2014-03-31,6319221,Chris,"As I arrived very late, I just followed the easy instructions provided by Jess to gain access to my room. The room was in excellent condition, clean and the bed freshly made, and plenty of towels. Jess and Joey also provided shampoo, soap etc. I immediately felt at home and went to bed.
The next morning, I planned to sleep in but was woken up by some music (probably around 9:00), not really loud but enough to wake me. It turns out that Jess and Joey have a hair studio on the floor below, and the music is just part of this.
For the remaining nights, this was no issue at all, as I already left the room before the hair studio opens. Other than this, the room was very quiet. Also, the room comes with a few plates and cutlery, which is cleaned on demand for you. Very nice, if you prefer to eat something light for breakfast before heading out.
Due to my early leaving and late returning, I only encountered Joey once very briefly. 

Overall, I totally enjoyed my stay at Jess & Joey's place. Thank you so much. It couldn't have been any better.

"
11411,12572935,2014-05-05,532574,Hannah,"Good cozy room. Plenty of sunlight throughout the day, though it can get a bit stuffy on warm days. Joey runs a hair salon downstairs, so you might hear some noise during the day, but nothing too serious. Overall, a good place to stay."
11411,14605767,2014-06-23,2084798,Theresa,"We loved staying here!   Very comfortable, clean and spacious.   It was incredibly quite.   I loved the set up-  it is a very large house tucked away in quiet neighborhood.  There is a Salon / Spa on the main floor and several airbnb rooms upstairs above the salon.  Loved it.  Would stay here again in a heartbeat.  Thanks Jess & Joey!  "
11411,18691832,2014-08-30,14179813,Philip,"I stayed 2 days and I really enjoyed staying here, the room was very clean and comfortable. The place is convenient located and with the car I was very quickly downtown. Joey was very friendly and always available for question. 
I definitely recommend staying with Jess and Joey when travelling to Seattle.
"
11411,22358450,2014-11-04,13604350,Lukas,"I really enjoyed my 4 week stay at Jess & Joey's room. The house is situated in a calm and cosy neighborhood. Only 5 minutes by feed is a 7eleven and several bars and restaurants.
A bus station to U District and Downtown is close to the house (only few steps)."
11411,22864258,2014-11-16,7955124,Eric,"Spacious and comfortable room in a neighborhood convenient to Seattle.  I would stay here again.

I was here for chilly week in November.  Even when the temperatures went below freezing the room was very comfortable.  Quality fixtures, furniture, linens and a soothing color scheme made the stay very pleasant.  The place is well run.

My room faced the road - a neighborhood arterial street.  Posted speed is 30 mph, but most cars go faster than this, increasing traffic noise.  As a light sleeper, rush hour traffic noise woke me most mornings.  There are other rooms available at this location, so maybe ask for a room that doesn't face the street if you're a light sleeper like I am.  In perhaps a nod to the traffic noise, the hosts thoughtfully leave a white-noise/nature-sounds machine on the bedside table.  "
11411,36545249,2015-06-29,33456219,Brian,Jess and Joey gave perfect directions to finding the place and instructions for getting in. They were both very welcoming and considerate of us and the room was exactly as described - welcoming and cozy and quick to respond to requests. We both had an amazing time visiting Seattle and would recommend staying here to anyone interested in staying in the area.
11411,37943023,2015-07-12,26880111,Lee Ling,"We a pleasant stay at your place.  The room was clean, quiet and nicely furnished.  The bathroom was spacious and well stocked. We appreciated the spring water cooler downstairs as we could make hot tea and coffee in the morning. We would definitely go back again."
11411,38361271,2015-07-14,15151950,Brandon,"I had a great stay at Jess & Joey's. The room was great, comphy bed and nice TV with cable. The bathroom was very clean and very large. The house seems to be in a safe neighborhood and is super convenient to downtown. Took me 15 minutes with traffic to be in the heart of the city during rush hour. Thanks!"
11411,43070773,2015-08-17,37194539,Melanie,The room we originally requested was booked before us but they wrote to see that they still wanted to host us and offered a different room—for the same price! It was the Sunrise Room. So beautiful! All questions were answered immediately. We could not have felt more at home. 
5205984,36125447,2015-06-25,19187818,Sonali,"We moved to Seattle and needed a temporary home for ten days. This was a great place for us. It was a very reasonable rate given our long stay. The basement space is very large and the bathroom has all the basic amenities. The sink is large enough to handle cleaning dishes. The air bed was surprisingly very comfortable that we are planning to get one for ourselves. The kitchenette is a basic microwave and refrigerator so we did have to buy a rice cooker to make some meals at home. For a shared listing, the place itself is very private. Nick was friendly and polite but didn't bother us unless we had a question for him. The place is quiet and safe. There was enough parking for two cars. "
5205984,37010208,2015-07-03,36822486,Jasmine,"Nic has a great home at a convenient location! Room is spacious, clean and tidy!"
5205984,37522596,2015-07-07,20495501,Alex,"Great bed, basement space and host. Very laid back and gave a lot of privacy."
5205984,49843215,2015-10-06,44355707,Dmitriy,"The room was big and roomy and there was an easy way to get in and out without bothering the host. There were a number of amenities and the room was spotless. The bed was surprisingly comfortable for an air mattress, as were the two couches and the entertainment system was unbeatable."
6076158,32034509,2015-05-12,32162505,Michael,"1st off- a barn in central Seattle??? Had to try it. It is a great space, very private, with a fully functional kitchen, queen bed in the upstairs bedroom, 3/4 bath and great wifi.  Really convenient to downtown and all things central in Seattle.  The bus route info made it even easier to get around.

David's a great communicator and made me feel really welcome. The opportunity to store my luggage at the Bed and Breakfast next door allowed me the freedom to make the most of my last day in town.

Absolutely a 5star experience. Can't wait to get back"
6076158,32274075,2015-05-16,2734499,Jason,"Best Seattle airbnb ever! In the thick of Capitol Hill and dedicated parking are just the start of the amenities. Great space, ultra clean and pristine. I highly recommend this listing! I will stay again. "
6076158,33290598,2015-05-26,32372155,Neil,"The Barn was amazing! Comfortably handled 3 people. Lots of amenities including a full kitchen and coffee among others. Great location. If you need a place to mainly sleep and get ready before heading out this is perfect.

David was a great host. He was very accommodating when our flight was delayed by over 2 hours even with our already late arrival. He also provided a lot of information on local restaurants and attractions. Very friendly and helpful."
6076158,33608599,2015-05-30,10042488,Wyatt,"Barn 11 is unique among the ~10 Airbnbs I've stayed in in Seattle. It's a beautifully renovated little barn on the back of a larger property that fits two guests comfortably. I had a great four night stay, and especially liked the skylight in the bedroom. Also in a convenient location in Capitol Hill. Would stay again and recommend. David was a communicative and easy host."
6076158,33943967,2015-06-02,1915240,Carri,"Had a great weekend at Barn 11. David graciously made sure we had coffee and was available to meet us at check in. The inside of this tiny house is lovely and comfortable. It feels so private you could imagine yourself in a cabin in the woods. The location is great, close to everything, but tucked away in a quiet residential neighborhood. "
6076158,34037138,2015-06-03,13344934,Jess & Tyler,"We had a super lovely but quick stay at Barn 11. David was super quick to respond and greeted us when we pulled in the driveway.  He was very organized with great maps and ideas for where to grab a drink or get a good bite to eat.  The neighborhood is very sweet and reminded us of Portland, OR quite a lot.  The cottage itself was very clean, well appointed and simple. Great hot shower, coffee for the morning and a cozy bed upstairs.  We would chose this little spot any day before finding a hotel room, and advise you to do the same!"
6076158,34652826,2015-06-10,33542791,Mindy,"Our stay at Barn11 was amazing. David made himself available and was very accommodating. We also appreciated the maps of the area with recommendations for local eateries. Every place he recommended was delicious. The place was perfect for our trip. The kitchenette was very convenient and helped cut down on our food costs. Everything we needed was available. The beds were very comfortable with extra bedding stocked if needed. We stayed during a time when the weather got hot, we came home to a cool apt with a portable air conditioner and fans working away. Housekeeping came daily and was much appreciated. The location is in a quiet neighborhood walking distance from downtown and made it so a rental car was not needed. If you haven't figured it out I loved this place and my stay here. If I'm ever back I'll definitely check to see if Barn11 is available. "
6076158,35322299,2015-06-17,34067547,Bernhard,"We had a wonderful stay at the Barn. We were met and shown the premises when we arrived. It was an ideal location with parking right outside the door. Quiet, clean and having everything needed for a pleasant stay. The neighborhood includes great places to eat and shop. Certainly on our list for future trips."
6076158,38341108,2015-07-14,37289482,Andrew,"David got in touch with me the day before our arrival to make sure someone would be at the Barn when we arrived. David met us in the parking lot and graciously offered to help with our luggage. After showing us around the Barn and getting us the kays, David showed us some maps as well as a list of carious restaurants and shops in the area. Super helpful. As far as the place itself. My girlfriend and I couldn't have any happier. Very cozy location with housekeeping that was close to everything we wanted to do and see in Seattle. No taxi we took from the Barn was ever more than $10, and we really liked that is was secluded in its own little area behind The Inn. We will definitely be looking to stay here again when we're in town. Can't say enough about the place."
6076158,45177611,2015-08-31,19739799,Jorge,"I'm tempted to give this a negative review in hopes it would be available for me in the future. This was by far my favorite airbnb stay ever. The place was quaint, gorgeous, the perfect size, in the perfect neighborhood. If I could live there, I would... seriously... if you ever decide to just rent it out, give me a call."
6076158,46550300,2015-09-11,386213,Leilani,"We loved this little barn.  It was perfect and a little bit more secluded from the main house which is what we wanted.  My husband is 6'r so it was a little small for him, but nevertheless, he enjoyed it.  The location was perfect and close to town.  It has many places to eat as well as close to the night life.  The information that David provides upon check in is very helpful as far as places to eat and see.  He was a great host and very friendly.  We loved it and definitely recommend staying here if you need a couples retreat."
6076158,54418467,2015-11-19,461891,Richard,"This is a great little cabin.  Super new and clean feeling with everything you need for a night in the city.  I wouldn't cook there unless you only need a hot plate, as there is only that and no oven.....but with so many great places to eat I think it's wise to leave it out.  We also had access to the kitchen in the main inn next door if needed."
6076158,54883723,2015-11-25,5243743,Dave,"We LOVED this place! My girlfriend and I came to Seattle for 5 days to explore neighborhoods we may want to live in when we move there. We're coming from NYC and used to being able to walk places, but also rented a car and needed to make sure we had a place to park it. Barn 11 was impeccably clean, parking was right in front, and it had everything we needed. Because Barn 11 is part of an inn, they even cleaned the room once a day, which is definitely what I miss about staying in a hotel when we stay in an Air BNB. The location is amazing, perfectly walkable to everything in Capitol Hill and so close to downtown. Just a note though - there is only a hot plate so don't plan to bake any elaborate cakes during your stay. "
6076158,55504877,2015-12-01,6550523,Jeff,"Barn 11 was fantastic for a 4 day weekend. Excellent location and easy parking right next to the barn. Super clean when we arrived and the maid service was very convenient (and unusual for an airbnb, fresh towels are sometimes hard to come by after a few days elsewhere). Comfortable bed and pillows. Lots of cleverly inserted storage throughout (small wood shelves everywhere). Interesting construction gives the place character. Skylight upstairs has a cover (we were worried). Would stay again for sure. Bakery Nouveau is a few blocks away and has awesome croissants and macarons. Easy walk to Safeway as well. We've stayed in 5 or 6 airbnbs in the Seattle area and this was definitely the best."
6076158,57261883,2015-12-23,20976741,Leo,"The ""barn"" and David were absolutely lovely.  My girlfriend and I stayed here for a long weekend and felt welcomed and at home. Would definitely stay here again! Five stars."
2249292,10706872,2014-03-03,2016445,Tarfia,"It was the perfect place for us. We felt comfortable, cozy, and welcome. The rooms were super clean and lovely, and we loved the roaming kitties. "
2249292,12763149,2014-05-10,12779763,Sam,Sasha and Alex are very kind young couples. The private room actually is whole floor under stairs with cozy living room and private bathroom. It's very tide and clean. Sasha had a very good arrangement. 
2249292,13198456,2014-05-21,12513663,Rob & Jen!,"Sasha and Alex's home was exactly as described and we had an extremely comfortable stay there. The bed was super comfy, the bathroom spotless and Sasha kindly let us use her lovely kitchen whenever we wanted - which was also a beautiful part of the house. If you like cats, you'll enjoy staying here as Sasha as 2 super friendly indoor cats that were very sociable and also entertained us well whilst we were in the house.

Madrona is such a beautiful and relaxed area, and we fell in love with the local coffee houses, restaurants and the water is just a 15 minute walk away. We spent quite a lot of our time down there. We walked into (and back from) Seattle centre on one of the days we were there - probably about 45 mins to an hour each way, but the local bus service was just as good and got us into downtown in about 20 minutes. 

We would definitely stay in Madrona, at Sasha and Alex's again for sure! Beautiful home, lots of space and Madrona is just lovely :)
Thanks Sasha and Alex for an amazing stay! "
2249292,13486910,2014-05-28,18540,Alicia,"Lovely hosts.  The place was neat, spotless and comfortable.  The neighborhood is terrific.  Great cafes and restaurants close by.  Good proximity to downtown.   Absolutely recommend!!!"
2249292,13807456,2014-06-04,762877,Tracy,"What a great find! Sasha and Alex are fantastic hosts, providing me with everything I needed, including a warm welcome and an invitation to make myself comfortable in their beautiful home. The house is super cute and spacious and the downstairs area where I stayed was newly renovated and spotless. I was very comfortable and happy staying here and will keep it on my list for when I head back to Seattle!"
2249292,13923776,2014-06-08,13454978,Carla,"Our first Airbnb experience is a fact; we had that in Seattle at Sasha and Alex's house and it was perfect! A great house in a friendly area, appealing design, great shower and nice hosts with good tips! Thanks Sasha and Alex! "
2249292,14207827,2014-06-14,8869277,John,"The home is charming, comfortable and spotless. Exactly as depicted in the photos, if not even nicer in person.  Very comfortable private room with a modern, sleek private bath facility.  The neighborhood is interesting and unique, I enjoyed running to the East, enjoying the great vistas and unique architecture of a uniquely ""Seattle"" neighborhood experience you would never get from a hotel or only experiencing the downtown.

I hope to stay again with my family on a future trip if schedules align with when the whole house is available. "
2249292,14359942,2014-06-17,15690034,Sonya,"If you are looking for a clean, comfortable place to stay Sasha's place is a great choice.  It is located in a great location.  Sasha and her husband were great host.  Answering any questions that we had about Seattle but also giving us our space during our visit.  I cannot say enough good things about this b&b except you will not be disappointed.  "
2249292,14705784,2014-06-24,16294516,Uffel,"We had a wonderfull stay at Sasha's place and we really enjoyed it.
We had a clean and cozy room and they helped us finding places worth seeing in Seattle !
We would stay there again without any doubts !
F&M from GER"
2249292,14767013,2014-06-25,17169551,Audrey,"Beautiful home/bedroom/facilities. These owners provide everything you could need for a comfortable, enjoyable time. The local area is also lovely to hang out in - had a great brunch just down the road!"
2249292,15696052,2014-07-14,26866,Rachel,"My boyfriend and I had a lovely stay with Sasha and Alex.  The neighborhood is wonderful, and the space is clean and comfortable.  We were house-hunting, so didn't interact much with our hosts, but the place felt like the perfect home base.  "
2249292,16253775,2014-07-24,846587,Victoria,"We had a great stay at Sasha's place (we didn't get to meet her as she was away on business, but her husband Alex was there and he's very friendly). Check in and out process was super easy. The home is located in a nice residential neighborhood that's not too far of a drive away from the main touristy spots. Our allocated space in the basement was very nice. My mom took the bedroom while I used the pull-out sofa bed in the neighboring TV room - both were comfy. Our bathroom was very clean. I think the only drawback for some people (not me, though!) might be their 2 highly lovable cats. I loved their cats, but some ppl might not be into them - and while you can shoo the cats away, they sort of go where they want, and that includes the basement area (you can close the door to the bedroom, but if you're on the sofa bed like I was, they will jump up to cuddle :D). Overall, had a great stay and I'd highly recommend this place to anyone."
2249292,16425580,2014-07-27,6067752,Trang,We had a very nice stay at Sasha and Alex's beautiful home. My husband and I live in Seattle and needed a place to stay while our house was being remodeled. Madrona is a beautiful neighborhood and our hosts were wonderful. The private guest suite was clean and spotless. I'd recommend staying at Sasha and Alex's for a true Seattle neighborhood experience.
2249292,16447102,2014-07-27,7158092,Kelli,The reservation was canceled 33 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
2249292,16481594,2014-07-28,17131849,Barb,"I didn't have a personal experience, but the Oregon Duck said it was great!"
2249292,16677147,2014-07-31,2622104,Gary,"Arranging access to the room was very convenient.  The space--actually a suite with a living area and a bathroom in addition to the bedroom-- is brand new, beautifully finished with tasteful high-end carpet, tile, linens, etc.  It's very private and comfortable.  Two very nice cats too, but they are easily avoided if you want.  Nice neighborhood."
2249292,16815797,2014-08-02,17841171,Liren,Sasha is a really nice host. The house is conveniently central located. It is only 5 mins away from the famous fried chicken place. We felt at home when we stayed here.  
2249292,17723390,2014-08-16,10385246,Thomas,"Resonant with other posters, this location and these hosts are spot on. I came in after midnight, and they were proactive with a lockbox, very clear directions, and a hearty welcome. This was a last minute need, and Sasha was gracious to help me out with only two days notice. I saw them several times while I was there, and there was never a push or not-too-subtle hint that I needed to spend time with them. Frankly, it was great to just decompress in the basement on a long couch where I fit just fine! 

The pictures represent exactly what the house looked like. 

The WiFi internet was fast and consistently working. The walk-in shower is glorious - hot and a high nozzle for tall people.

Would totally stay here again. Every morning I got out and walked around the cute neighborhoods - hilly, but wonderful. Even did some yoga on the back deck. "
2249292,19445613,2014-09-12,21053484,Tsara,The listing is completely accurate and the house is adorable. There's tons of space to relax and the cats are really friendly. 
2249292,19974810,2014-09-21,21205193,Margaret,The email exchange before our stay was informative and friendly. We had all the information we needed when we arrived in Seattle. Love the neighborhood and house. Right up our alley. And the extra info that Sasha included about restaurants in the neighborhood was a plus.
2249292,22343581,2014-11-03,22629048,Qi,My wife and I came to Seattle as tourist. This place is excellent! The location is perfect -- not too far away from downtown and with many public transit nearby. Living experience is also very good and comfortable. The house and room is very clean and convenient. As tourist we just want to seek somewhere comfortable to sleep and this place perfectly satisfies all our needs. Hosts are also very friendly and helpful. There are two lovely cats indoors and they really make our stay a wonderful memory :)
2249292,22564400,2014-11-09,16684231,Ashley,"We had a lovely stay with Sasha and Alex.  Their home is located in a lovely neighbourhood easily accessible via transit.  They were lovely, and gave great recommendations for places to go, and eat during our stay.  Their home is lovely with lots of character, and I would not only recommend their home but I would stay here again."
2249292,25241199,2015-01-10,1424567,Chris,Nice and friendly hosts who made the effort to make me feel welcome. I had the whole downstairs to myself (except for the kitties who were also very friendly). Awesome location close to lots of great restaurants.
2249292,26340767,2015-02-09,15974005,Iain,"Sasha and her partner were really nice and the place was great: Quiet, super clean, really comfortable, and with a basically private living room that was great for relaxing after a day exploring Seattle. The neighborhood nearby is really cute and quaint (with great food, a nice wine bar, and a great little ice cream place). It was conveniently located, not far from downtown, and easy to find; instructions were simple and clear, and the recommendations for quiet neighborhood spots added to the trip a lot. Would definitely stay there again, and would recommend it. Also: cute cats!"
2249292,26954574,2015-02-22,27602068,Diana,"Sasha's place was beautiful and the neighborhood is gorgeous! It was easy getting around on the many bus routes that run near the house. Madrona's Hot Spot cafe is a must stop on your adventures! The place was spotless, comfortable, and we slept really well on the comfy bed. It was very private and we appreciated having our own bathroom. Highly recommended!! "
2249292,28218483,2015-03-20,24470863,Patrick,"Sasha is a wonderful host. The Checkin was easy, the place is absolutely awesome. Free Amenities in the bathroom and two lovely cats. There is a huge TV with Netflix. Would stay here again. Thanks for everything."

2249292,28897824,2015-03-31,28948873,Brent,"We stayed 4 nights in Sasha and Alex's home and it was a great decision. The suite in which we stayed was downstairs in the basement level and was very private, and very clean. This was the first time my girlfriend and I were visiting Seattle so we were happy to find that their neighborhood was very nice, quaint, and centrally located. We used public transportation for the first 2 days to get around and found it was very easy and convenient as a bus stop was just down the street. Capitol Hill and Downtown were only 5-10 minutes away. Sasha was also nice enough to provide us a list of local restaurants and attractions to check out and it really gave us a lay of the land and some GREAT meals. Great hospitality and home, and two very friendly cats. We hope to be back!"
2249292,30240164,2015-04-19,1244025,Mike,We had a great time and the guide that the host left for us about Seattle was super helpful. Our flight on our last day was rather late but the host let us leave our luggage at her place which was awesome. Would love to stay here again if I am back visiting Seattle. 
2249292,31078492,2015-05-01,19671995,Mia,"Our stay with Sasha and Alex was great for our stay in Seattle. Gorgeous home and beautifully decorates.
Although this is a private room we had complete privacy downstairs with our own bathroom and sitting area with great TV and access to Netflix. 
The neighbourhood is beautiful and you are just far enough from the city that it is a short 15 min drive or 20-30min bus ride into downtown. Sasha face us great recommendations on places to eat and things to do to ensure we enjoyed our time in Seattle. 
One big bonus for me was there two beautiful cats who are super friendly and great for a cuddle (especially if you are missing yours whilst on vacation).
All in all we had a great stay and will be visiting again.

2249292,33725368,2015-05-31,7190934,Camila,"I went to Seattle for 4 days for a conference. The place was perfect, nice bedroom, internet, etc, as was in the listing.  Sasha´s place is not far away from downtown, actually,  I have walked to and from downtown every day, but also the place is close to bus stops, so it is very accessible.
Sasha was very easy to contact, she gave me information on how to reach the place,  and also some information on what to visit in Seattle. I did not have any problem to find the place.

2249292,34168855,2015-06-05,7134741,Trevor,"This private area is in the basement of Sasha's home.  We had a private room, bathroom, and living area.  We were provided all the amenities we needed, and Sasha was very friendly and helpful with our questions about sites to see in Seattle.  Her house is located in a cool neighborhood, only about a 20-minute drive from downtown.  She has two friendly kitties who hung out with us downstairs (could be an issue if you have allergies).  I would stay with Sasha again if visiting Seattle."
2249292,35316274,2015-06-17,31349340,Lindsay,"Sasha and Alex are a warm and thoughtful, professional young couple.  They responded quickly to our questions while planning our trip.  We were warmly greeted and shown our space.  This is a spacious accommodation with a private entrance.  All amenities were as indicated  and the  space even more inviting than described.
The space and linens were fresh and the bathroom clean.
Sasha and Alex provided excellent information regarding the area, public transportation alternatives and suggestions to enhance our stay in Seattle. They were helpful and available via text to answer questions during our stay.  They have invested a fair amount of time  to provide very useful information for guests to enjoy their stay and begin exploring Seattle immediately.
They have two darling cats that could only be an issue if you have allergies.  It was lovely to have their presence as I missed my own while traveling. We highly recommend this lovely couple as hosts and their accommodations."

2249292,39664962,2015-07-25,37511266,Patricia,"Sasha is a very gracious hostess. The basement accommodations were clean and neat. Some of the pictures posted were of the upstairs. Sasha said we were welcome to use the upstairs kitchen,etc. The bed was comfortable. If you do not have a car there is a bus line not too far away. The Mt.Baker light rail station is closer to three or four miles away. The neighborhood seemed calm. Sasha had some new doors delivered while we were there to make improvements to make the downstairs entrance easier and more private.  We had a good stay and would not hesitate to stay with Sasha again. "
2249292,40534530,2015-07-31,28114353,Kathleen,We had a great time in Seattle!  Conveniently located and comfortable surroundings in a great neighborhood. The space is neat and clean with private bath and washer/dryer. Our hosts were very quiet and courteous. Would recommend it!

The apartment was exceptionally clean and felt very welcoming. The neighbourhood was within walking distance (in some cases a long walk but very doable!) of many of Seattle's attractions and a 5 minute walk from a couple bus stations that provided access to much of the city. In addition to being conveniently located it felt very safe as did the apartment itself.  "

2249292,47313649,2015-09-17,2930634,Jess,"This apartment was a great place to stay. It was so nice, clean and comfortable! I loved the area. It's the perfect walking distance into the little town of Madrona or down to the river. It's also only a short drive to Capitol Hill. It was easy to communicate with Sasha, and she also had a great number of recommendations! I would love to spend another Seattle getaway in this Madrona apartment!"
2249292,47783645,2015-09-21,16476062,Robert,"This is a great place.  My wife and son stayed there for the week while he was moving into his dormitory at Seattle University.

Private.  Spacious.  Clean with easy parking."

2249292,50015933,2015-10-08,1465258,Jonathan,Sasha's place was in a lovely neighborhood outside of much of the hustle and bustle of downtown Seattle.  The apartment had a nice yard out back as well as a relaxing living room and plenty of space!  Sasha made sure was all set from before I even arrived and was very good about communicating.
2249292,50135161,2015-10-09,45613478,Caoimhe,"The place was exactly as nice as we expected! Good coffee, clean, nice neighborhood. Sasha left helpful notes for what to do and where to go. Would definitely stay here again!"

The description is accurate and the pictures show well the apartment as it is. We did not realized that there was no real kitchen when we booked it (nothing to cook aside from a microwave, no table, no chairs) but this is well described in the description, so it was our bad.
The neighborhood is charming and very convenient to drive to every places to visit in Seattle.
Great week-end in this lovely city!
"
2249292,50710392,2015-10-13,26500569,Sukhee,"We had a lovely night in Sasha's mother in law apartment, the space was large, clean, and comfortable as well as easily accessible. There was always street parking for our car and an adorable bakery just a few blocks away where we could walk for breakfast. The bed and pull out couch were comfortable and the sheets & towels were great. We would recommend the space to anyone!"

Very detailed, easy to follow and really helpful to people new to the town. Besides all her place is great, 10m driving from downtown, very residential neighborhood but at the same time walking distance to a couple of cool bars, some businesses and the water.

Overall highly recommended ;)

She was very helpful in providing everything needed and all the information required to feel ready for my visit.  Everything was clean, organized and I had no issues whatsoever with my stay.  Would definitely stay again when the time comes."

She send us a very detailed email includes all information how to find the house, check-in with the coded system, attraction points in the neighborhood etc. The house located at Madrona which is very easy to access Downtown seattle. We had a car but had no problem finding parking spot. The apartment was very spacious there is Netflix if you ever want to watch. We stayed 2 days in the apartment the bathroom was very nice and clean and the apartment have washer and dryer if you need to do laundry. And Sasha was a very good host she send me a message after our 1st day if everything goes ok if we want or need anything. We would definitely stay here again next time in Seattle!

2249292,58017765,2015-12-31,9590220,Norma Jean,"Sasha little den was prefect for our little getaway in Seattle. What sold me was the heated flooring and was it worth it? YES! 
We arrived later than expected, but Sasha was fast at assuring we'd be able to check-in with no issues. Although we spent most of our tine out and about, Sasha's had everything we needed. 

Also enjoyed the beers left in the fridge when we arrived. Thank you very much Sasha! "
2249292,58160481,2016-01-01,49130918,Kristin,"This basement apartment is beautifully decorated, well appointed, and conveniently located near downtown Seattle.  We loved walking to local restaurants and coffee shops, and enjoyed a delicious and decadent dinner at St. Clouds nearby.  Our hosts made sure we had everything we needed, including household amenities, suggestions for entertainment, and a guide to local can't-miss locales.  Strongly recommend!!"
1246769,5283338,2013-06-22,1864688,Art,"Wonderful location by Westlake Metro stop and great value for money. Dirk and Jaq were extremely accommodating. Communication was timely, helpful and very efficient. The place itself was spotless with everything we needed for our 2-night stay. Even though I left my watch behind, Jaq kindly offered to mail it back. And left us umbrellas for the rainy Seattle weather. Would highly recommend they lovely apartment and I would definitely stay here again on my future visits."
1246769,5328922,2013-06-24,6243591,Patte,"The apartment is beautifully appointed and very comfortable. Everything is new and feels luxurious. There is a high quality mattress, the sheets and towels are nice, completely new carpet, kitchen & bathroom. Huge hi-def television. But at the same time, nothing is overdone and the apartment is very contemporary and tasteful. Convenient location for public transportation. And Jaq and Dirk bent over backwards to make our stay comfortable. My best air bnb experience yet!"
1246769,5530154,2013-07-04,5086787,Supriya,"My husband and I had a wonderful stay at Dirk and Jaq's place.  The apartment was clean with tons of fresh towels, utensils, etc.  Dirk met me with the keys when I checked in, and he was also kind enough to obtain a neighborhood guest parking permit for us.  The location is really great as its close to a whole bunch of restaurants, and the neighborhood around the area is also very walkable.  We'd love to stay here again Highly recommend this place!"
1246769,5563199,2013-07-06,1937144,Annie,"Great find.  Simple, sufficient, immaculate.  Dirk and Jaq were accommodating, fitting us in during busy July 4 and working around our last minute request.  The location was a central.  Everything we expected."
1246769,5618769,2013-07-08,7078409,Desika,"Dirk and Jaq's place was the perfect first air bnb experience for us.  Here's what was so awesome:

Location - you couldn't be at a better spot.  Right off of Pike, you're a few minutes from the waterfront/Pike Market, walking distance to all the awesome bars, restaurants, theaters, coffee shops, etc.  You're close enough to I-5 and walking from the light rail.

Place - minimalist, and great furniture/amenities.  Beautiful TV, wonderful memory foam mattress, modern kitchen/appliances.  The place is spectacular if you have kids as well - we brought a toddler, and the place was basically baby-proof already!

People - D&J were wonderful. After knowing we were bringing a kid, they put all the chemicals up high, got some milk for him, and extra towels, etc.  They were incredibly responsive, and flexible with our travel plans.

Price - examine the typical prices at hotels in the area (Westin, Grand Hyatt) and then remember you're getting a FULL 1 bedroom apt. for much less the cost than these hotels, and I'd argue you're getting a nicer place! (I've stayed at the Hilton and Hyatt downtown Seattle for comparison).

The place is outstanding!"
1246769,5789394,2013-07-16,2873885,Amanda,"Dirk and Jaq's apartment was exactly what we needed for our trip to Seattle.  It was in a prime location; we walked almost everywhere.  The apartment itself was newly remodeled and it definitely felt like brand new.  We really did not spend much time in the apartment because we were off doing things but it we felt very much at home there.  The bed was very comfortable and there is a fan mounted to the wall... very nice considering it was pretty warm during our trip.  Although we didn't use the kitchen, it is well-equipped and if we had stayed longer, we could have done all our shopping at the farmers'/fish market and made nice dinners.  The main living space is very comfortable and there is cable tv.  The bathroom/shower were really nice.  There was room for our toiletries and they also had lots of basic toiletries in case we forgot anything.  The hair dryer, curling iron and regular iron were all really handy since we had a wedding to attend.  Dirk was very helpful before and during the trip.  This was our first experience with Airbnb and we couldn't have asked for a better experience!"
1246769,6025403,2013-07-27,6861663,Wendy,My husband and I visited Seattle often.This was our first time staying in a condo instead of hotel. We found it such a pleasant experience. Dirk is an excellent host. He is very kind and courteous. The condo is comfortable and clean. We shall come back in the near future. Thank you.
1246769,6323804,2013-08-08,3683386,Nick,"Dirk and Jaq went out of their way to make my family feel at home in their excellently located condo. They were truly attentive, going above and beyond expectations, from quick responses to questions, putting cleaning supplies out of the kid's reach to surprising us with english muffins, milk and cheese in the refrigerator. 

It's super easy to get to from the airport by rail and the location near Pike Street is hard to beat. It's just a quick walk to Pike's Place Market, Museums and other areas of interest. We never had to rent a car or take a taxi. There are more great restaurants and coffee shops in the area than you'll have time to visit.

You can tell Dirk and Jaq have put a lot of thought into the condo. (Linens and kitchen utensils are right where you would put them.) It feels new, clean and spacious. Our kids quickly fell asleep on the convertible sofa and aerobed each evening and we slept very well on the comfortable bed.

We would stay there again in a heartbeat."
1246769,6422813,2013-08-12,6988914,Dwayne,"Great location and super-hospitable hosts!  They really went the extra-mile to make sure we enjoyed our stay, leaving some food in the fridge and soap in the shower.  The apartment itself is really nice, plenty of space, and feels like new, and, the best part, you're super-close to everything you'd want to go see! "
1246769,6812625,2013-08-26,6368180,Peter,"Stayed at Dirk & Jaq's for a wedding weekend. Shared it with my friend and his girlfriend. Dirk was very easy to get in contact with and checking into the apt was super easy. It was clean and stocked with essentials like bedding, pillows, towels, soap, shampoo, coffee and tea! The location was perfect for our schedule as it was central to downtown and Capitol Hill, so we could walk anywhere. The apartment was exactly what we needed for our stay and I would recommend it to friends! "
1246769,6915948,2013-08-30,6919807,Susan,"Excellent hosts! The apartment was superbly clean and is in an excellent location for exploring downtown and capitol hill.

1246769,7008060,2013-09-03,6824968,Chris,"Overall very impressed with Dirk's and Jaq's place. It is a great size and in a good neighbourhood. It was clean, quiet, and to be honest, much better than any hotel I have stayed in at Seattle. 

The bed and futon are very comfortable. Was very impressed overall and will gladly stay again next year."
1246769,7109723,2013-09-06,1986831,James,"host accepted my reservation with very late notice, which was nice and much appreciated. this place was as pictured, and in a very convenient location; all tourist musts were within about a 20 min walk. at night we took advantage of an app called lyft to get around. internet was a good speed for hd content (700+ kB/sec). the guest parking pass let me keep a great parking spot i nabbed near the buildings entrance. i wouldnt advise parking past 9th/under the bridge as that area looked a bit inhabited--you are in the downtown area after all. my wife and i would stay there again for sure."
1246769,7196228,2013-09-10,793728,Lydia,"Dirk and Jaq's apartment was great! Clean, comfortable, with every amenity you would want and a fantastic location. Walking distance to the market, waterfront and great restaurants, in a safe building. We enjoyed every minute!"
1246769,7254541,2013-09-13,6990213,Sean,"Dirk and Jaq's apartment was everything that we hoped it would be. It is clean and  exactly as it appears in the photos, and is in walking distance to the water front, Pike Street Market, Capitol Hill, Bell Town, the Space Needle,  and many restaurants and bars. Communication with Dirk was very easy and he  really made us feel at home.
 This was my first AirBNB experience and I am very pleased. I definitely recommend Dirk and Jaq's apartment to anyone who's planning on visiting Seattle."
1246769,7368847,2013-09-17,8066287,Alan,"Dirk & Jaq's condo in Seattle was perfect. Great First Hill location, very comfortable and spotless.  Would definitely stay again next time we're in Seattle. "
1246769,7552758,2013-09-24,6445461,Jael,"Perfect location while in town for a show at the Convention Center.  Clean, convenient and comfortable. We appreciated the thoughtful  grocery staples that were  provided!  We'll be back. "

1246769,7791705,2013-10-03,7870525,Vince,"We decided to stay at Dirk & Jaq's apartment for a Seattle vacation. It was our first trip to Seattle and our first time using Airbnb as well. We couldn't be more pleased! 

The well cleaned, 1 bedroom apartment was plenty spacious and minimally, but nicely decorated. The bed and linens were very comfortable, and it's easy to imagine staying there with a child due to the comfortable hide-a-bed in the living room. Pulled out, it also makes for a great place to relax in front of the TV once you've exhausted yourself walking around the city (there's a lot of walking to do!). The kitchen was adequately stocked with eggs, bread, some jam, english muffins, and milk.  

As for the location, it's great as well. You'll have easy walking access to:

- Pike Place Market
- Space Needle and surrounding museums (Chihuly Glass Garden and EMP)
- Convention Center (1 block away)
- Downtown shopping
- More seafood than you'll have time to sample in one trip
- Capitol Hill
- Light rail for easy access to SeaTac
- And Freemont and Ballard (salmon ladder) are easy to get to via bus

We rented a car one day in order to get out to Olympic National Park (highly recommended) but otherwise in no way felt we were lacking without a car.

We didn't get to meet our hosts face-to-face unfortunately but that was due to the timing of our travel schedule, not through lack of interest or effort on their part. They were very attentive and helpful,  responding quickly to text messages during our trip planning and while we were there. All of our questions were answered about the apartment itself and more broadly about vacationing in Seattle. 

We're not sure when we'll get back to Seattle but whenever that is, we'll definitely see if we can stay with Dirk and Jaq again."
1246769,7884123,2013-10-07,7585897,Jarrod,"Dirk & Jaq's apartment is perfectly located - it's very easy to walk around the area and transport is everywhere.

The apartment is perfectly suited to a single or couple travelling, and is in immaculate condition. Extremely comfortable and bright!"

Kitchen was stocked with basics which was great & we used amazon fresh for some additional groceries. Responsive hosts- very pleasant. Would highly recommend and stay again myself."
1246769,8252557,2013-10-22,3045479,Brian,"Dirk & Jaq's place was absolutely great.  The location of their condo is perfect in Seattle right downtown perfect walking distance to pretty much anything in Seattle, and also close to the freeway entrances if you wanted to drive out to the surrounding areas.  Their condo was very updated clean and modern and they also had some general necessities in the refrigerator like milk, water, and soda.  They also left a pint of ice cream in the freezer for us to enjoy which was perfect.  I would definitely recommend to stay here as this is the perfect way to visit Seattle and feel like a local.       "
1246769,8452955,2013-10-31,386103,Amber,"Dirk & Jaq’s condo was in a great spot, conveniently located near the convention center. With the zone 21 parking pass they provided we found a spot about 3 blocks away that we were able to leave our car for the entire 3 days.  Everything we needed/wanted was in walking distance. 

Pros: Unit as pictured, and newly remodeled with a comfortable and modern style. Check-in was very easy, and the hosts are very friendly and helpful. We called Dirk when we made it into town, and he met us at the condo. He had purchased fresh milk, eggs, cheese, english muffins for us at no extra charge, which was a nice touch. The bed was very comfortable, and there was plenty of hot water. The Wi-fi was reliable, and there were several cable channels.  

The cons: The condo was slightly smaller than we expected from the photos, but it was definitely adequate.  The building is older and seems to have very little ventilation, so the hallways had a funny smell (the unit itself didn’t have an odor). The shower head is a little low; it was at eye level for my 6’1’ husband. Also, there are two barstools, but no dining table if you are planning to cook and eat in. 

Overall: It is a good value, and I would definitely return and recommend it to others.

We were able to walk no more than 10 minutes into the heart of downtowns retail district and 10 minutes up to capital hill for wonderful food and spirits (I highly recommend la spiga and oddfellows). Dirk and jaq were both accessible and extraordinarily hospitable. We will definitely book this again for future visits. "
1246769,8835474,2013-11-20,9600553,Miranda,"We stayed three njghts at the apartment of Dirk and Jac. The information we asked we got within 24 hours. Dirk was there when we arrived and showed us everything. We only walked during our stay. Nice clean and central (email hidden)e bed is really good, I Always get backpains, but never did now. I recommend everybody who want to stay in Seattle to stay at Jac and Dirk's place"
1246769,8888184,2013-11-24,3783411,Lien,"Jaq and Dirk has such a lovely place. The apartment is in a convenient place close to downtown. My friends and I walked everywhere since it's in a central location. The apartment is under surveillance at all times. We always felt safe. Thank you, Jaq and Dirk for having us. We had a great birthday trip :) "
1246769,9035344,2013-12-02,4610645,Mary,"The location was perfect, right between Capitol HIll and downtown. The place is cute and just as shown in photos. Very clean and modern. Comfy bed. It's an old building so the plumbing was a little weird, but everything else worked great. The parking pass was awesome. It would have cost us about $100 to park our car at a nearby hotel for 3 nights, but we parked out front for free the whole time and just explored the area on foot. Lots of great restaurants and coffee shops to choose from! Oh, and the wifi was excellent.

Thanks for a great stay!"
1246769,9381564,2013-12-25,5830503,Jess And Fredrik,Dirk and Jaq's place was perfect for our trip! It was a super close walk to downtown and only a few minutes away from Capitol Hill. The bed was incredibly comfy - Dirk and Jaq provided us with everything we needed for a cozy stay in Seattle. We will definitely come back :)
1246769,9805353,2014-01-11,659393,Steven,"Great location, nice host, compatible apartment, perfect trip."
1246769,9855568,2014-01-14,9672177,Judith,Excellent location! Clean and well-equipped condo. Dirk and Jaq have thought of everything! We had a comfortable stay! We definitely recommend staying at Jaq and Dirk's again.
1246769,9928104,2014-01-20,3388105,Carl,"We had a wonderful time at Jaq and Dirk's place!  The location is fantastic...walking distance to everything in downtown Seattle as well as Capital Hill.  They have thought of, and supplied, everything that we needed.  I have to agree with the other reviewers...the bed is VERY comfortable.

Dirk was there to meet us when we arrived and he was a great source of information...he was very friendly and thorough with his orientation of the apartment and the surrounding area.  We could not have asked for more!"
1246769,9993253,2014-01-24,3024053,Kanada,"A perfect place to stay. Great hosts, handy location, very clean and comfortable. "
1246769,10232384,2014-02-08,11266951,Sara,Great stay! I got sick during my trip and was so happy to have a comfortable place to recover.  Dirk & Jaq were very kind and clear in their communications.
1246769,10360897,2014-02-16,10446263,Derek,"This is such a great location! Very central, walking distance to basically everything. Whether you're going shopping, eating, dancing, or seeing some of the historic sights, nothing is more than 10 minutes away. Dirk and Jaq were very accommodating, and the beds are really comfortable. Clean, bright, great price, and relatively quiet for a city apartment -- highly recommended."
1246769,10442661,2014-02-18,4533836,Kris,"Jaq & Dirk's place was great for a weekend on the town. Very modern, clean, and well stocked with basic essentials. They provided a parking pass and very clear instructions about the rental. I would stay here again if I need a place downtown. The bed was really comfortable too!"
1246769,10513818,2014-02-23,1619090,Jordan,"I stayed in Dirk and Jaq's condo while in town for a conference at the convention center, which is, literally, around the corner. The space was as described: modern and light, well-appointed, and with the most comfortable bed I've ever slept in! I would certainly recommend this space to anyone visiting Seattle -- its location is convenient to all Downtown destinations, and there is amazing food in the immediate neighborhood -- and would particularly recommend for anyone attending a conference at the WSCC. This is a wonderful little retreat from the cavernous convention center and is far more relaxing than any hotel could ever be.
Dirk and Jaq are very responsive, and offered detailed information & accurate directions for everything -- from how to check in/out, where to eat, how to get around. I would absolutely recommend them as hosts to anyone traveling to Seattle -- and I hope to be able to stay here again!"
1246769,10673594,2014-03-03,630562,Sara,"We had a great, easy stay at the apartment. Dirk & Jaq provided some last-minute help (to add an extra guest, bring in a table). Seriously right around the corner from the Convention center, so we saved a lot of money by not having to book at the Sheraton. "
1246769,10853409,2014-03-10,932327,Maya,"Dirk & Jaq have a great 1 bedroom condo that is really close to all forms of transportation. We stayed there for 3 night (without a car) and found it so easy to get around on public transportation. The condo itself it amazingly clean and stocked with all of the necessities. Dirk and Jaq are the perfect hosts and are very easy to communicate with during the planning process. 

We will definitely plan on staying here again when we need to head back to the Seattle area. Thank you again for making our Seattle visit awesome! "
1246769,11577720,2014-04-08,1424323,Deborah,"The location was great for me as I was working at the Paramount and could be at work in minutes. The apartment was clean and as pictured, its not very big but it was ok for me on my own. I spent most of my time in the living area, the bed was comfortable. The hosts helped out immediately if I had any problems.
I found it quite expensive for what it was but I had messed up my reservation and was able to stay an extra night at no cost which was very helpful."
1246769,11795620,2014-04-15,10956378,Melissa,"Dirk & Jaq were the utmost helpful hosts. The apartment was very clean and well stocked with miscellaneous items that made our stay more comfortable and convenient. There was a very detailed guidebook in the apartment. They were also very responsive to our needs and easy to get a hold of. 

The apartment was in the PERFECT location. A five minute walk to downtown/pike's place and also right on the edge of Capitol Hill. It is right around the corner from a large central train/bus terminal so we could catch a bus to literally any where in the city. Travelling with a one year old and four year old isn't always the easiest thing to do, but our stay here made it seem as easy as it could have been. Thank you Dirk & Jaq!!"
