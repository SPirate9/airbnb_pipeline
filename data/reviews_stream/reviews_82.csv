Lara had directions inside the loft that described any question we had from, what's the wifi password to how to work the pullout bed! Very quiet neighborhood in a great location near greenlake. We had such a great trip! Thank you Lara for the experience!!"
3852117,35571748,2015-06-20,29122314,Brian,"The cabin was in a wonderful, quiet neighborhood, and was easy to find.  The room was snug and cozy, as described, and had everything we needed for our short stay in Seattle.  Lara was available and responsive if we needed her, and not intrusive when we didn't.  An excellent place for a short term stay in Seattle, or if you are interested in trying out tiny house living.  I'd certainly recommend this as a wonderful, interesting place to stay."
3852117,36433672,2015-06-28,34878460,Billy,"We had a great stay with Lara, who was very accommodating for our travel plans. The cabin was perfect for our time in Seattle and a great deal - I would definitely recommend it to future travelers."
3852117,36527119,2015-06-29,2134715,Christopher,"This was great for a quick night in town. Quaint, simple. Remember that there's no shower here."
3852117,36768908,2015-07-01,29638466,Nick,Our experience at the Zen Hut was awesome. We used it exclusively as a place to sleep after a very long day in the city. Laura was super accommodating and helped us with all kinds of confusion/needs. We would definitely stay again. 
3852117,37373740,2015-07-06,32687918,Mary Frances,Everything was a posted at the Zen Cabin.  Lara was extremely responsive and we had a great time!  It was a plus having the extra room in the backyard.  A perfect visit!
3852117,37608851,2015-07-08,19539726,Eileen,"Our first night in Seattle was wonderful! Lara was very responsive and accommodating - and the zen loft was just perfect for what my husband and I were looking for!
The space is small and very comfortable for one night. The neighborhood is quiet and safe-feeling. We walked all over the place from this location without trouble... Yoga studio, whole foods, cafes. 
Lara is very sweet and a wonderful host, thank you!"
3852117,37720306,2015-07-09,36958075,Kourtney,"Our experience was great! Lara was a great host! Even without getting a chance to meet her, I felt welcomed and at home! The cabin was nice and clean and was perfect for our very short trip. Overall it was a fun, quiet little stay and we had fun! Thank you Lara! :)"
3852117,38993289,2015-07-20,9271799,Jeffrey,"Lara, the host, was easy to reach, and she was available but not at all intrusive. The place is just as described. It is super cute and convenient. I'm pretty tall, 6'2"", and I slept just fine in the upstairs loft. It really is small - even smaller than I thought it would be - but it totally works as a place to sleep, make breakfast, and then launch out of into your busy day in Seattle."
3852117,39508587,2015-07-24,25825980,Rachel,The neighborhood was extremely cute and nearby one of the nicest ends of Seattle. She was very welcoming and really good with communication. She left tea out for us and instructions on how to use various items in the loft. 
3852117,39664848,2015-07-25,3994559,Liz,"Staying that the Zen Cabin was great in terms of location. Lara was also welcoming and helpful. The only downside is the smallness of the space and lack of access to a shower, for the price."
3852117,39772624,2015-07-26,25773168,Lauren,The tiny little loft was good for a pitstop. It was cool to climb the roof and see the beautiful sunset. Pretty good location felt very safe. Could be dusted a bit more but worked for us since it was a pitstop (no shower)
3852117,42213850,2015-08-11,750050,Kate,"I didn't get to actually meet Lara, but she was in touch via phone and helpful before, during, and after our stay. My brother and I arrived late at night, and everything was perfectly set up for us to get straight to bed. I slept in the loft, and he slept on the futon, and we were both quite comfy. It really does feel like a little cabin in the woods, even though it's close to everything in the city! Great overnight stay."
3852117,42442815,2015-08-13,6376179,Masanori,"The host was easy to reach, and the check-in process was smooth. The place is not hard to find, and the loft itself is adequate for 1-2 adults. Unfortunately, we stayed here during a really hot & humid summer (unusual for Seattle), so it became too hot in the loft even with the small fan that is installed in the unit. There are 2 windows atop the loft, which we kept wide open while sleeping at night but there are no screens, so we were attacked by mosquitos in over a dozen places (per person). I would recommend you bring some insect repellent and/or request the host install window screens prior to your arrival if you're visiting during a hot summer like we did."
3852117,42598288,2015-08-14,23473483,Evan,"We arrived a little before 10:00 at night and Lara still made sure to come out to meet us which was really great. Lara had the front steps up to the loft lit up which was super beautiful. The loft was very accurately described; super small but cozy and perfect for a one to two night stay if you are planning ons pending most of your trip out and about. Even though the place was tiny (still accurately described) it was well decorated and homey. We really enjoyed our cozy night there. FYI on google maps it looks as if their place is on the corner lot.... It is NOT the corner lot. We may have trekked in to the neighbors yard a little before realizing our mistake. Totally our bad, make sure to check the house numbers! The only reason we are giving it a 4/5 is because its not a full apartment (no real door to the bathroom, no real worries), but for what this place is its a GREAT place to stay and we wish Lara could be our host with every Airbnb experience! "
3852117,42927919,2015-08-16,12259693,Brian,"Lara's loft was just what we anticipated. Tight quarters sure for three, but the loft and yard were clean, comfortable and functional. We opened the windows and enjoyed the cool evening breeze in this quiet neighborhood.  She recommended a ""screen on the green"" outting, that turned out to be the perfect way to spend the evening.  Cafes, shops and groceries are a 10 minutes away on foot.  Perfect spot for a night or two."
3852117,43110538,2015-08-17,38951201,Sarah,"Staying at the Zen Loft was perfect for our one night stay. Lara made sure to remind us that there wasn't a shower and that was fine with us. The Loft really is tiny and you can see how much potential it has. It will be super fab when it's 100%. But, it's clean, it's in a very safe neighborhood, and Lara was very nice and helpful. I can tell she really loves hosting. Thanks  for the stay!"
3852117,43288270,2015-08-18,30245647,Josh,"The experience was wonderful. The Zen cabin was clean and comfortable. Lara was more than accomodating giving plenty of tips on what to do in town. The location is great also, close to seemingly everything."
3852117,43987625,2015-08-23,39748377,Briana,"The space was cozy & comfortable and was a great stop for one night. For the small time we were able to interact with Lara, she was very friendly and pleasant. It was a unique space to stay in and I'm glad we did!"
3852117,44327268,2015-08-25,39456698,Jan,"Lara is a delight and made us feel comfortable from initial contact.   Communication was very responsive.  The cabin was exactly as described (flexibility & balance are assets when clambering over beds and ladders).  We had a refreshing sleep -- deep and quiet, and awoke to bird song.  Next time we'll bring more things to amuse us, as there's no TV.  We enjoyed the garden, the rooftop view, and Lara's tolerance of our laughter."
3852117,44567326,2015-08-27,16793532,Benjamin,"Lara's Zen Loft was great! The place was cute and quiet. Lara and John were very accommodating, letting us stay late to catch up on sleep since our flight arrived after midnight. Would definitely stay again!"
3852117,44848090,2015-08-29,11733817,Marley,"The zen loft was a cozy little heaven for our one night stay. Equipt with all the essentials, it makes it homey and comfortable. Great location for just being outside downtown Seattle. Would definitely book again!"
3852117,45139797,2015-08-31,11280108,Emmeline,"Very cozy little space, and Lara was very friendly and welcoming in her communication. The small dwelling stayed comfortable and quiet through a very windy rainstorm, and easily slept three. "
3852117,45401757,2015-09-02,3219609,Elizabeth,"Although we didn't get to meet Lara, she was very welcoming and easy to contact before our stay. We weren't in Seattle for very long, but the Zen loft was a great place to rest. It was raining during the night, which made it even cosier. It was a very unique place to stay, which is one of the best things about using air bnb. We got the experience of staying in a 'tiny home' without the full time commitment. It was just a short drive to a lot of things we wanted to do, like go to the Green Lake area and Fremont/Ballard. "
3852117,46001619,2015-09-07,41198981,Anthony,"From the very first email correspondence, I knew staying at the Sweet ""Zen Loft"" Cabin was a great decision. Lara and I exchanged sentiment via email about our families and I felt like I knew her before I even arrived. The reason that my girlfriend and I stayed in Seattle over Labor Day, 2015, was to celebrate our one-year anniversary. We have a eight-week old daughter (my mother watched her for the first two nights), that we were missing, but we also had plans that included Sounder's tickets for Saturday night. Lara offered to watch our little girl for the few hours that we'd be at the game. So, after my mother spent the day with us in Seattle, and dropped off our baby, we knew that we had babysitting arranged by our host. That kind of service will never be replicated by a hotel. Unfortunately, plans didn't work out that way (we were enjoying ourselves down by the waterfront too much and didn't have enough time to make it back to the cabin before the game. The offer was so unexpected, genuine, and nice though that there is no way I wasn't going to mention it. I had planned this amazing four days in Seattle, which included a movie in the park, but we had so much luggage that we couldn't fit blankets in the car. Lara let us borrow four blankets, and they were definitely needed on that cold September night. As for the cabin itself, it was very cozy. The heaters did a great job warming the space, and everything you needed was provided. The room is nice and bright with natural lighting, and there are plenty of interior lights for when the sun goes down. All in all, it was an amazing space with a wonderful host, and Crystal and I will always keep it in mind for future stay-cations!!"
3852117,46253098,2015-09-08,2880352,Leon,"I booked the loft last week for a quick photo shoot. Unfortunately, my model was delayed so I had to move the location. 

Lara was an excellent host. She answered all questions and concerns very, very quickly. This being my first actual Airb&b booking I hope all of my future hosts are as gracious and on top of things. "
3852117,46472436,2015-09-11,35081354,Karen,We had an amazing time here! Lara was very friendly and personable throughout the entirety of our stay and checked in on us to see if we needed anything. I would definitely consider coming back here and recommending her place to friends or family interested in visiting Seattle. Couldn't have asked for a better stay. 
3852117,46675246,2015-09-12,43353969,Martha,"The host was very kind and helpful.
"
3852117,46889547,2015-09-14,38878749,Raina,"Lara made us feel very welcome and was very clear with descriptions and instructions. The neighborhood was great! Very pretty and quiet. The cabin itself is quite small, even smaller than the pictures make it look, but it was cozy and the futon was comfortable. We loved staying there and will probably do so again!"
3852117,47206182,2015-09-16,8069241,Rhombie,"The zen loft is a nice cozy place to stay in Seattle. We arrived with just enough time to make food and rest, small and comfortable."
3852117,47460089,2015-09-19,9211494,Kyla,"Cozy, quaint, and perfect for a night or two passing through. I was there with my husband and a friend, and we are all adults- It was tight. I think this space is perfect for 1 or 2 people, but 3 can fit for a night or two! It's great for the price and has everything you need (besides a shower of course, but that was expected!)"
3852117,48147543,2015-09-23,5324215,Lucinda,Wonderful short stay at the zen cabin! Lara and family were so accommodating about our late arrival and left lights and the heat on for us! Very cozy and comfortable for two! 
3852117,48189181,2015-09-24,9838032,Tiffany,My fiancé & I only stayed one night in Seattle and the Zen loft was perfect! We were very comfortable and had a relaxing stay! For a small space I loved the versatility of the kitchen & enjoyed making coffee with the French press in the morning! If we are ever back in Seattle we would definitely stay again :) 
3852117,48543376,2015-09-27,41562641,Leeann,"This loft was just as serene as I'd imagined! Its tucked away in a nice neighborhood, it has all the amenities you need, and Lara was such a sweet host. I would absolutely stay here again!"
3852117,48885083,2015-09-29,26536229,Christa,"It was really nice to stay at this location - easy to get most anywhere in the city, and nice to come back to this sweet loft and sit on the roof before bed."
3852117,49574965,2015-10-04,43228542,Steffi,Our room was very cool and sooo cozy. We loved it! Besides Lara and her family are such nice people. Very friendly and welcoming. I would definetly recommend this place! Thank's for all :)
3852117,49611465,2015-10-05,24938478,Regina,"Lara was easy to communicate with with and very kind about our delayed arrival. The Zen Loft is cozy and comfy. There was even coffee provided! The tree lights made for a very welcoming tone, as did the easy access. Overall it was quite charming, and I'd recommend this to anyone looking for a unique night away!"
3852117,49820091,2015-10-06,9731875,Michael,The Zen Loft is great! Just what we needed for a quick overnight in Seattle. Plus it's a short walk from all kinds of restaurants and stuff. Would definitely stay here again.
3852117,50688247,2015-10-13,2460020,Mary Jane,"Lara's lovely little place was great! My boyfriend and had a comfortable sleep and enjoyed our night at Lara's. She was very accommodating to our arrival time and easy to get in touch with. We drove, and found Ravenna to be a centralized area allowing us to visit the university district, Ravenna park and both Freemont and Ballard. The ZenLoft was cozy, warm and quaint. A couple of odd finishes, but that's what we liked! 
Definitely recommend this listing for a short visit or passing through Seattle. "
3852117,50897900,2015-10-15,15880952,Daniel,"Second time here, Lara and the space are amazing!"
3852117,51383950,2015-10-19,12432474,Amanda,"Great communication with Lara, who was so helpful and friendly, with great ideas of where to eat etc. and left great instructions of how to find the cabin.  It was a perfect place for a quick stay, in a great neighborhood with easy access to interstate.  Comfortable and cosy with everything one needed.  Would definitely return!"
3852117,51502256,2015-10-20,41666633,Brittany,"Lara, the host, was welcoming, and accommodating to our arrival and departure times.  The place was clean and cozy, just what we needed for our short vacation to Seattle. Lara made sure everything was okay and was easy to communicate with, I wish traveling was always like this! "
3852117,51822369,2015-10-24,8900680,Tony,"Lara was a wonderful host! Very accommodating to our late check-in. We didn't get the opportunity to meet Lara, but the loft had a very nice, personal feel to it with coffee and tea for us to use. The space itself was super cozy, perfect for two or three. Located in a nice, quiet neighborhood which was perfect for an escape from the bustle of Seattle while still super close to everything. We would definitely stay again next time we visit Seattle. Eleven out of ten stars. "
3852117,51873352,2015-10-24,4905127,Toetsie,"I loved the little house in the garden, and it was just what i was looking for: I needed to find a place for just one night, and it was in the right neighborhood of Seattle.. I longed for a little garden, sitting outside, and a good night sleep, and that is what i got! I slept upstairs in the little one persons bed, and that was great! yes, it is up the ladder, and yes, there is no shower, but there is a fine kitchen and you got your little hideout right here! Loved it!"
3852117,52179251,2015-10-26,7586439,Christine,"Lara is a lovely host; flexible and welcoming.  The loft is small and as pictured!  Probably not the place to choose if you have a sensitivity to dust or moisture, as this comes with the territory!"
3852117,52626366,2015-10-31,387679,Tamara,"Loved the sweet little zen loft cabin!  Super sweet, comfy, and tiny!  It was just exactly what I wanted and allowed me to feel very at home and warm in a lovely little space.  Lara was wonderfully nice and communicative.  I highly recommend!"
3852117,53372824,2015-11-08,43215687,Michele,"I was very welcomed. The description was accurate and the neighborhood was very nice, safe."
3852117,53504523,2015-11-09,23954451,Megan,"Not only is this the *cutest* little loft but it has everything you need (without the shower, which we knew going into it). You can tell a lot of thought and careful choice went into making this loft feel homey while maximizing and utilizing the space in the most efficient manner possible. If you are going with more people than just yourself, make sure you love them, because it is close quarters :) Finally, the loft feels private even though you can see Lara's house from the loft, which is comforting in it's own right. Great stay, great host, and would definitely stay here again! "
3852117,54031903,2015-11-15,9373300,Sylvie,"My stay at the Zen Loft was easy, sweet, and thoroughly enjoyable. The space is small but super comfortable and well taken care of, and Lara was incredibly communicative and responsive. Two thumbs up!"
3852117,54737965,2015-11-23,19979331,Donnaah,"The zen Loft is adorable. Everything you need (minus a shower) for a comfy stay. Quiet location. Lara was super responsive in all communications, even checking in half way through our stay to be sure we had everything we needed. Very tempted to return to this sweet little nest in the heart of Seattle."
3852117,55408796,2015-12-01,4275974,Melissa,"The Zen Loft was a perfect place to stay for a short holiday trip. We had family nearby who let us use their shower, but we didn't have to put them out too much because we had somewhere to sleep that was cozy and comfy.  The kitchen is quite well appointed for such a small space.  The beds were very comfortable, and the heaters kept the space warm even on very cold nights.  The fold-out futon does require a small amount of athleticism to re-fold in the morning, but pulling it out from the wall and climbing behind it was the right approach. :)  If there is more than one person staying in the cabin, make sure you have a level of comfort with being in close proximity when the other person is using the toilet (there is a visual barrier)....or with stepping outside at certain times (not so fun in the cold).  Overall, Lara was a great host, I had all the information I needed for a nice stay, and I will definitely book this again in the future!
"
3852117,55543733,2015-12-01,49902830,Tonya,"We arrived very late, and unfortunately did not have a chance to let Lara know. But we found the loft in the dark without problem, and the sidewalk was lit so it was easy to enter. The loft is beautiful, small and cozy and stocked with everything you could need! There is tea and coffee, and all the kitchen facilities of a regular sized house. 

Lara-apologies that we did not get to meet you, but thank you for allowing us to stay in your beautiful loft for the evening. We will remember this place for our next trip to Seattle. Hopefully we will meet you then! :)"
3852117,55811630,2015-12-06,3879676,Stephanie,Cute and sweet little place near nice neighborhoods and good food/drink.
3852117,56623478,2015-12-15,23532329,Colleen,"Lara was very accommodating and was flexible about meeting us at a time that was convenient.  The room is small (as advertised), but the three of us were comfortable.  Nice location in a quiet neighborhood.  We had a very pleasant stay."
9138923,53404976,2015-11-08,14139196,A M,"Wonderful hosts! Very easy to work with. Space was lovely and cozy. Well appointed, very clean and quiet. Guests were beyond pleased. Will most definitely recommend to friends and neighbors!"
9138923,53540884,2015-11-09,9762605,New,"Upon arrival we were warmly received by our hosts and given a short tour of a quaint and charming downstairs apartment.  Despite the fact that it was a basement, it received plenty of natural light via the half-windows which lined the outside walls. The apartment had a great kitchen area and a welcome board with pertinent information such as contact phone numbers and wi-fi passwords.  The bed was comfortable, the shower pressure and water was good, and the towels were soft.  It's also not far from central Ballard.  Although we only stayed for a night, we experienced enough to have no hesitation about booking here in the future."
9138923,53777054,2015-11-12,2921403,Dana,"I've stayed at a lot of Airbnb's, this was one of the best for a well priced well kept ""entire apt."" Take advantage while it's still a bargain, you won't regret it!"
9138923,54817479,2015-11-23,12654507,Daisy,I traveled with my niece and we both love our stay.  We meet Anne when we got there and felt welcomed:) The description of the place is accurate. And it was perfect for us.  I would definitely recommend the place.  
9138923,55576265,2015-12-02,48020929,William,"Ann's place was perfect for our week-long thanksgiving visit.  It's spacious and private, with it's own entrance, cozy and filled with great reading materials.  Communication and organizing arrival was very smooth.  Ann's place is a couple of blocks from a stunning view of the mountains and the sound.  We feel very fortunate to have stayed here.  Thank you Ann!"
9138923,55812769,2015-12-06,36747701,Kris,"Excellent!  Really wonderful apartment as described.  Very clean sheets/linens and living space.

Enjoyed the selection of books.  Interior design features pretty cool.  Comfy Space... 

Anne greeted us and was very kind, fun, positive."
9138923,56331122,2015-12-12,33827971,Paula,"Anne communicated with me regularly, right before I checked in and during my stay.  I was busy with meetings and did not get to meet her, but felt well attended to, regardless. 

The apartment was perfect for my needs.  Cozy, beautiful, plenty of space, and quiet.  The amenities were high quality and I really appreciated the attention to recycling and composting.  The neighborhood is lovely and is within walking distance of downtown Ballard (20 mins).  I parked my car at the house and walked and took the bus everywhere I needed to go for the time I was there. 

I would highly recommend Anne's place. "
9138923,56734997,2015-12-17,5118936,Sue,"We had an awesome stay at Anne and Erik's pad.  Everything was clean and tidy.
Anne and Louie (Cute little guy!) came to introduce themselves early on and checked with us by text after a couple of days to be sure we had everything we needed.  Nice neighborhood.  Quiet. No complaints."
9138923,57332294,2015-12-24,7362895,Allyson,What a fantastic place to stay! Anne was incredibly welcoming and helpful. The unit was immaculate and well stocked with cooking supplies which is SO NICE! Every detail was taken into account from shampoo in the shower to soft duvet covers. I accidentally left my running shoes behind and Anne was so helpful in getting them back to me. I will definitely stay again next time I come to Seattle! 
8016309,45195792,2015-08-31,42338878,Julian,"It is a shared room with a sliding glass door for privacy.  Brett was welcoming, and offered us everything we needed for a comfortable stay.  He keeps his apartment in pristine condition, and his guests happy.  For the price and quality, this is the best option in downtown Seattle.  If I find myself in Seattle again I'll be looking Brett up first thing."
8016309,45443874,2015-09-02,42791686,Lynn,Brett was a nice host and was welcoming.  The location is a 15 minute walk downtown which travelling much easier.  The place was tidy but could be cleaner.   The listing is for a shared room so me and me friend ended up sleeping on the bed.  Brett made us some coffee in the morning which was nice. 
8016309,46320325,2015-09-09,37732507,Jessica,Brett's place was nice and just as described. The capitol hill neighborhood is near several bars and a club and only a 20-30 min walk from attractions such as pike place market and the rest of downtown. Brett was also a great host and gave us several suggesstions of places to visit. 
8016309,46837920,2015-09-13,21537398,Brenner,"My stay with Brett was perfect - he was responsive and flexible given that I was arriving pretty late. He made sure I had everything I needed and felt at home. The apartment itself was very nice, modern & neat. Had a great experience - would highly recommend staying with Brett - you're right in the center of everything."
8016309,47509563,2015-09-19,41774753,Zach,"Brett was very welcoming into his home and made my first Airbnb experience a delight. If I had any questions Brett was willing to answer.  The neighborhood featured many restaurants and cafes a short walk away. Brett also provided a list of them and recommended any  that he liked. Capitol Hill has a great nightlife scene for any who want to partake. Bring good walking shoes and a rain jacket, as walking was the best way to get around Capitol Hill and to downtown. Also a chance of shower are always in the forecast.  The apartment was very nice, with a comfortable bed, featured a secure entry, a view of Seattle University and a rooftop deck. I would stay here again on any of my future visits to Seattle. I recommend this apartment for any young individual or couple looking for the convenience of being close to downtown without the price of staying downtown. "
8016309,48743104,2015-09-28,18335387,Michelle,"Had a nice stay here. Brett was welcoming and the space was tidy. The apartment is located in a nice area within walking distance of Pioneer Square and a short drive away from other downtown areas, touristy and otherwise.  "
8016309,49805456,2015-10-06,43462939,Alexa,"Brett was an amazing host. Very friendly and accommodating. The apartment was very nice and clean (the bed was super comfy!). We were close to all the Seattle sites we wanted to see. If I'm ever in the Seattle area, I would defintely stay again. "
8016309,51383755,2015-10-19,9055429,Stephanie,"Brett's place is in a great location - very easy to get around the city by foot or public transit. The apartment was nice and clean, and Brett was great at pre-trip communication - we had all of the info we needed before our trip. The one thing to note about the space is that Brett sleeps on the couch outside the sliding door, so it might not be the best option for light sleepers. "
8016309,52235051,2015-10-27,44394362,Quintin,"Brett was a very gracious host. He offered us coffee & made banana pancakes!

The location was perfect for us. Just a short walk from E. Pike Street where we spent two nights exploring the nightlife. "
8016309,53080159,2015-11-04,44468118,Courtney,"Super friendly guy, his apartment is right next to Seattle University & was extremely close to everything. Just keep in mind he's a grad student & does study- we found times we had to be extra quiet cause he was studying, but overall great experience staying here! "
8016309,53856233,2015-11-13,48408324,Abby,Great location! Brett helped with transportation ideas and communicated well. He was very welcoming. Very nice place. I enjoyed my stay!
8016309,54243829,2015-11-17,3345395,Zvi (And Sasha),"Brett is s very nice host, the place is very contemporary, centre located and clean. Brett gas a list if suggested restaurants in the area, and they are numerous. The housing complex is amazing, it has a gym, board games in the lobby, etc. It is perfect for a short stay.
However, if you are a light sleeper or a conscientious guest, this might not be the best pick. Brett sleeps on a small couch right outside the partition wall that gives you no privacy sound wise whatsoever. Your schedules might also be different and then either the guests or the host have to do their best to be quiet which is quite impossible in a non-soundproof environment."
8016309,54640206,2015-11-22,48353714,Yong,Awesome place. Awesome host. Would definitely stay here again. 
8016309,54921419,2015-11-25,48724139,Serena,Brett was very responsive and was a great host! The room was very clean and the neighborhood was safe!
8016309,55442201,2015-12-01,48109757,German,For my first Airbnb experience it was legit. Brett was awesome & super responsive. He suggested a few food places on a list and gave us some extra ones while we were there. Honestly loved the area where his place is. I would definitely stay here again if I ever go back to Seattle. Thanks Brett!
8016309,56562930,2015-12-14,50780223,Cloé,"Brett is a nice host, we had a nice stay. Thank you for your welcome ! "
6004165,56007045,2015-12-07,34742392,Carlos,"Sue Ann was very responsive and nice. The place is exactly as described, clean and has a great location (10 minutes away from downtown). I would definitely go back to this place."
6004165,56533500,2015-12-14,49526122,Rebecca,"Sue Ann's hospitality was incredible during my 6 day stay at what I am calling an oasis and garden sanctuary that provided privacy and comfort on my personal retreat! 

Sue Ann responded immediately when I made the booking, with a warm welcome and useful information. I'd planned to arrive efficiently packed, mid-day for a week of seeking holistic medicine not available where I live, as well as solitude prior to taking a bold step in a new direction in my life. Just before my trip we had a death in my family, coupled with a few pressing medical issues and family issues. As it turned out, I needed this retreat more than ever as I arrived, am honored to have to a guest in this beautiful place.  Beautiful touches made me feel like a dignitary. She greeted me, showed me in and about, offered to help with my luggage. Amazing Artful decor and carefully selected products, with an inspirational green focus...the medicinal garden was wonderful, with songbirds of all sorts out my kitchen window. It was not just clean, it was immaculate. From the book selections, the stereo set up, the fine linens with a wool duvet and pillows that made a heavenly bed...botanical scents of soaps and such, gourmet snacks and beverages, earth friendly cleaning supplies, organized closet, cupboards, and recycling set up...I enjoyed every area, more than adrquate for two people for an extended stay. It is very well arranged, from eating or doing business at the table, to reading in the wing chair or meditating on the couch. I even cleared the coffee table to the side for yoga and the turned up the music to dance. I observed every special touch with intrigue, and spent a week of restorative healing in a surprising location, a secluded private home away from home! I want to come through the seasons to see her medicinal garden flourish! My two regrets are that I had more luggage than was practical, so please note her caution in the description that the trek can be challenging. I hope when I book here again I might spend a bit of a visit to get to know Sue Ann. She gave me me the comfort and solitude and privacy I needed, one of my best choices this year was staying here.     I'm certain others will agree Sue Ann goes above and beyond. Perfect for a business trip, a romantic getaway as well. "
6004165,57232980,2015-12-23,49778697,Carl,"Sue Ann was a wonderful host, and the accommodations were exactly as described.  Many small touches made us feel right at home.  She was very helpful with our check-in and any questions we had, but unobtrusive during our stay.  The neighborhood has many fine features nearby, and the local bus route was only 2 minutes away with a straight ride to downtown, the airport, or the college district.  We had a wonderful time and would definitely stay here again.  Our only regret is that we forgot to sign the guestbook!"
5838129,41513335,2015-08-07,36888712,Shaan,Erin was very nice and accommodating. She had a lot of materials available to show us what to do in Seattle and was more than willing to explain anything we were interested in doing during our stay. 
5838129,43313621,2015-08-18,6828087,Josie,"Erin's place was great! It was tucked in a quiet safe neighborhood, not too far from the bus stop, and about 15 mins away from downtown Seattle. The pics are exactly what her place looks like. Erin was extremely friendly and was a great host! She had maps and snacks prepared for us for our arrival, and her house is really clean. She is also great with communication. The check in and check out process was easy. Thanks Erin!"
5838129,44226231,2015-08-24,41501566,Lotta,"I was four days in Seattle. My first time I use  airbnb. After my reservation, accept Erin it quickly. She was immediately ready help me to find her house and anything else, what I want to know. It was easy to find her house. My room with bathroom was very nice und light. It was also very quiet in the house. Every day I meet Erin and I cut ask her anything else. Erin look every day after room and bath, that all was in order. It was very kind stay by Erin. Her house have very good atmosphere."
5838129,44506256,2015-08-26,39949007,Mike,"Erin made me feel welcome. She was a good communicator and quite responsive and was  surely accommodating, giving me directions and suggestions for getting into Seattle for a series of early morning business meetings. She also set me up w/ a laptop table and a iron and ironing board. The description was accurate. The neighborhood was quiet and safe. I parked my car nearby on the street, no problems. Best of all, the place was clean and the room was very nice. "
5838129,45415766,2015-09-02,9244793,Lucie,"Erin's house is just perfect. So clean, and so comfortable. We really felt like at home. She really made us feel that way. She is a great host. I will definitely come again if i am ever again in Seattle. The house is located in west seattle, that is less than 10 minutes from downtown. And you can also walk to many great restaurants or shopping area nearby.
Thank you Erin again for everything ! It was great !"
5838129,45841840,2015-09-06,41654665,Rachael,"Erin was a wonderful and welcoming host.  Her townhouse is beautifully decorated but still cozy.  The neighborhood felt very safe and was adorable.  Easy to get to the highway from there.  Also, let me just say the bed was amazing!  Erin provided great recommendations of things to see and do, and she was a life saver when she cured my headache with her supply of alleve.  Thanks, Erin!! "
5838129,46223334,2015-09-08,34590492,Jessica,"Erin was the sweetest host, making us feel welcomed from the second we arrived in Seattle!!  She did whatever she could to help make the transition to her townhouse smooth and stress-free.  She greeted us at the door, gave us information we needed for our stay and offered suggestions for our sightseeing.  The pictures are truly accurate.  The townhouse is gorgeous!  Erin has great taste in decor and style.   In fact, you don't even feel as if you are at an airbnb...I would compare the accommodations to a boutique hotel!   The house is spacious and spotless.  The bedroom fits two with a spacious walk-in closet where you can hang your clothes.  The private bathroom is next door to the bedroom, extremely clean with big soft towels.  The energy in the house is inviting and calming.  The neighborhood is in a perfect location- just a quick Uber ride to downtown Seattle.  Erin is such a delightful host, I would highly recommend to book your stay with her... I hope some day my boyfriend and I will return!"
5838129,46454145,2015-09-10,24452303,Suzan,"Nice experience, Nice and clean house. Erin is a great host. We kept to ourselves most of the time. The house is in a nice neighbourhood not far from downtown Seattle. "
5838129,46528066,2015-09-11,24583554,Trey,"My experience with Erin was fantastic- top to bottom. She had the room more than ready for me and was willing to help me figure out what to do during my stay. Plus, the location was ideal.  All in all, I'm hoping to stay there again the next time I'm in Seattle. Highly recommended."
5838129,46851339,2015-09-13,32701569,Carlos,"Erin is the perfect host, she made us feel as if we were in home, she has all the information than the tourists need and she is very kind and friendly.

Her place is cozy, very comfortable and clean. It´s better, much more better than a Hotel."
5838129,48260508,2015-09-24,32701569,Carlos,"It was our second time in Erin's house. Everything was perfect, clean, comfortable and near to Downtown. Erin is an excellent host. "
5838129,49700372,2015-10-05,44884208,Elisabeth,"Erin was a welcoming, helpful, and friendly host who made my first Airbnb stay a perfect one. Her home is beautiful, clean, and cozy. The location and neighborhood were ideal for my trip - close to downtown but quiet and relaxing, ample free street parking, and a quick and inexpensive Lyft ride away from downtown. I highly recommend and would definitely stay again."
5838129,49868486,2015-10-06,45699602,Ashley,"Erin's town home was wonderful! The pictures are an exact depiction of the shared living space and your room.  Your room includes a large walk in closet with plenty of space to store luggage and hang your clothes. Your private bathroom is very clean and bright with natural light. The water pressure in the shower is superb! Erin is very helpful with planning and sightseeing if you need any suggestions for things to do or places to eat. I love the West Seattle location of Erin's town home. You are a 5 minute walk from the bus stop. The 21 and C-line take you downtown for $2.50. Uber is ~ $15 to get downtown and to Capitol Hill district. Erin is very welcoming and a great hostess. She will provide you with plenty of privacy, but alternatively is open to a warm cup of tea and chatting about your adventures. Also, I traveled alone for this trip and as a female I felt very safe in Erin's town home. Erin was also very flexible with my early arrival. I plan to stay with Erin again in the future and high recommend her townhome!"
5838129,49955660,2015-10-07,33534122,Eunhee,"Erin's house was even cuter than the pictures posted. The room is on the third floor and you get a private bathroom of yours next to your room. Which I loved! The room however could be a bit for two people. Erin is so nice and she will accommodate to your needs. If you need to stay somewhere close to downtown but don't want to pay the downtown area cost, I highly recommend her place!"
5838129,50245582,2015-10-10,35904360,Christopher,Erin made me great and happy to be staying with her. Erin is awesome. She is a real sweetheart and her place is impeccable.
5838129,51633636,2015-10-22,43465428,Emma,"From the beginning Erin was so welcoming and lovely, and my first impressions of the house were like - wow! The room was super clean and Erin made my bed every day, as well as provided little snacks that she kept refilling (and new water bottles). The place is really close to the bus which takes 10 minutes to get to Downtown Seattle and comes pretty frequently. I LOVED staying at Erin's and also have made a new friend in Seattle. I will be back if I visit the city again :)"
5838129,56379782,2015-12-13,16064630,Kate,Erin was the perfect hostess. I had a well deserved trip to Seattle that much better because of her hospitality and recommendation. 
6118198,31411965,2015-05-04,16637385,Kiniya,"Kellie, Matt and Clover (the dog) were very hospitable and welcoming!! They made our stay in their home very comfortable. This was the first time that I rented a shared space, I must say that staying at Kellie and Matt's felt equivalent to renting a private space. The room and private bathroom were both very clean as well as the home overall. I would definitely stay at this location again! "
6118198,34486723,2015-06-08,18093101,Bruce & Wren,"Kellie and Matt's house is gorgeous!  A lovely, quiet residence in West Seattle near beaches, downtown, and the best French bakery in Seattle.  We loved staying there."
6118198,34825602,2015-06-12,35109574,Frank,"Kellie and Matt's place is a beautiful home in West Seattle, a lovely neighbourhood. They are very welcoming hosts, easy to get along with and quick to respond to my questions. Clover, the dog, is adorable. The room is clean, bright and comfortable, with its own separate bathroom. It certainly met the description. It was great to stay with them -- everything was perfect!"
6118198,35221242,2015-06-16,4835486,Susan,"Kellie and Matt have a beautiful and interesting home with a room and private bathroom that were perfect accommodations.  We enjoyed our hosts, and our stay in their wonderful West Seattle neighborhood. Our son and his family live nearby and we were hoping to find a ""home away from home"" for our visits with them....and WE DID.  We'll be back!!"
6118198,35439704,2015-06-18,10748436,Kenneth R. (Dick),"Wonderful room.  Wonderful and gracious hosts.  Good email, private bath, and most delicious coffee.  Also, Kellie and Matt are young, talented, and entrepreneurial, which made our interactions very stimulating.  "
6118198,35603235,2015-06-20,35097651,Mike,"I pulled up in front of the house and thought ""Okay, this is weird.""  I'd never done the ""Airbnb"" thing.  Staying in a stranger's home???  Well, we'll give it a shot.  I was greeted in the yard by Clover, whom I refer to as the ""sweetest dog in the world"", who initally growled but then grabbed her tennis ball and gestured ""let's play!""     I rang the bell and met Kellie and Matt.  Wonderful people and very welcoming!   We talked about how they got into this and it definitely put me at ease.   The room was airy and comfy (as you can see by the photo).  Plus, they'd set up a little ""guest area"" with a coffee maker, mini-fridge, a couch and even a Nintendo Wii.   They made me feel totally at ease and told me to feel at home and come and go as I want.   I even got my own bathroom with, I must point out, a rare shower head that's taller than me (I'm 6'2"").   My first day there I just explored West Seattle and really enjoyed it.   It's a great neighborhood and it's got a great view of downtown Seattle.   I was there to see a couple of Mariners games and Kellie suggested I take the ""Water Taxi"" to the games, which was awesome.   Took it to both games.    So, I'd have to say that I felt very welcome and enjoyed my first ""airbnb experience"" immensely!   Thanks Kellie and Matt and Clover!  :-D"
6118198,36109688,2015-06-25,33239118,Deb,"Welcoming experience. Very beautiful home, very nice bedroom with a bathroom down the hall. Kelly and Matt were very friendly and helpful"

Georgi"
6118198,37158937,2015-07-05,9562012,Gary,Everything is very clean and as described.  We really liked the place and the neighborhood.  Kellie and Matt are great hosts and gave us good suggestions on where to go and how to explore the area.  Clover is adorable!  
6118198,39404000,2015-07-23,14666449,Maxime,"The house is wonderful and very clean. We met Matt who was super kind and Kellie was available all the time before our coming. The only problem is to reach the house from the airport by public transport. Ortherwise, everything was perfect ! Thank you"
6118198,40361586,2015-07-30,5277678,Linda,Kellie was a terrific host.  The house is dramatically modern and beautiful -- and very clean.  It's is a lovely neighborhood and convenient to a great strip of stores and restaurants.  It's a perfect place to stay in Seattle.
6118198,40935000,2015-08-03,36291514,Tamala,"From the moment our reservation was accepted, Kellie was very prompt and welcoming in her communications.  We had arrived in the middle of the night, so Kellie sure we could check in easily.  When we entered her lovely home in West Seattle, we were struck by the modern and spacious interior.  Our room was comfortable, neat, and spacious.  We had full access to a fully stocked bathroom and lounge area (a stocked refrigerator and full complement of coffee and teas) and entertainment center.  In addition, we were able to use the downstairs kitchen.  The residential neighborhood was a safe, upscale community, in walking distance to California Avenue, which boasted a host of cafes, stores, and cultural spots.    We were thoroughly impressed by our accommodations, thoughtfulness of our host, and the pleasantness and convenience  of the location.  "
6118198,41608288,2015-08-08,33961,Ginny,"Kellie and Matt were warm and welcoming upon our arrival. Staying in a stranger's home can be a little uncomfortable but I felt at home from the first minute. The house is very clean and well decorated. The dog, Clover, is sweet, calm and friendly. I felt like we had all the privacy we would in a detached unit. The location is very convenient for us and I would love to stay there again.
"
6118198,42145284,2015-08-11,36543511,Danielle,"Kellie made us feel very welcome in her home. The room is very true to the details that she has provided on the listing, which was very much appreciated. She provided great suggestions for restaurants in the area and was easy to talk to. The location of her home was perfect to get to downtown Seattle and an easy walk to public transportation, as well as other more local shops and restaurants. It was well worth the price for being so conveniently located to downtown and such a homey place to stay!"

6118198,47673488,2015-09-21,39286998,Timothy,"This was our first Airbnb booking and it was great. My wife and I stayed in Kellie and Matt's house while we were in town for a friends wedding. The house is open and full of natural light. A great example of how comfortable a well designed, modern home can be. The room and bath were clean, quiet and well appointed and the neighborhood reminded us of home with easy access to great restaurants, a grocery, and public transportation. Our drive into the northern part of Seattle took about 25 minutes. We were very comfortable here with their hospitality, helpful tips about the city and the resident canine, Clover, who is as sweet as dogs come."
6118198,49355888,2015-10-03,4691762,Nina,"Kellie and Matt's home was absolutely wonderful! The room and space  is exactly as advertised, and I felt super comfortable in their warm home. Their dog Clover is an absolute sweetheart, and was a delight to get to know. Their home is close to great coffee shops and restaurants, and is the perfect spot for a West Seattle stay! Hope to be back here next time im in town."

6118198,51540827,2015-10-21,43356720,Steve,"Our stay at Kellie and Matt's beautiful home was our first Airbnb experience, and it was a Home Run. We loved the modern ""Green"" home and the wonderful design. Our hosts were very friendly and helpful, and we loved their dogs Teddy and Clover. When, not if we come back to Seattle, we will hopefully be able to stay in Kellie and Matt's awesome home."

Met us upon arrival, handed us the key, and left us detail instructions. Very useful. We will definitely book this listing again. And by the way, she left us wine and flowers. Also, her place smells amazing, like lavender. Great touch!"
7618605,43140412,2015-08-17,40387149,Trevor,"Host made us feel so welcome by offering perfect amenities for our 5-night stay.  So well-organized, clean and all the necessities one would need.  Nicely-decorated and had incredible taste.  "

7618605,55465814,2015-12-01,12845363,Liz,"Mckinzy was very easy to contact and communicate with. The apartment was cute and in a great location - easy walking distance to tons of bars and restaurants (and there was a great list of local recs from the hosts). However, we were a little bummed to arrive and realize there was no closet available and nowhere else to unpack or even put our suitcases (the bed takes up the entire room) - if you're traveling with bigger bags (or more than one suitcase), expect a tight fit. Also don't expect to watch the news - while there was a TV in the apartment, it's not hooked up to any devices (cable, DVD player, etc), so we were a little let down that when we chose to stay in for a night,  hanging out to watch a movie or show wasn't an option for us..."
80188,244891,2011-04-29,534073,Kimberly,"Before I even arrived at Eleanors place I felt very good about the constant contact and massive amounts of information she provided to me. Upon arriving at her home, my friend Erin and I were welcomed warmly with a hug and shown to our lovely private area. Eleanor was more than accommodating for our every need, showing me where I could smoke out of the rain, feeding Tim a yummy biscuits and gravy breakfast, I even forgot my toothbrush and she had one for me!   Eleanors home was beautiful and charming and it was a pleasure staying there. Bruce and Rock were so polite and sweet to everyone as well, which made the whole experience feel very welcoming and peaceful.  If there were anything I could have changed, it would have been that we could have stayed longer! I would recommend and stay again! 
"
80188,258678,2011-05-10,528341,Ethel,"Great experience!!!  On this trip to Seattle we wanted to stay someplace other than U District and still be close to the university's weekend activities and our son.   I was fortunate to find the Olsen's on Airbnb and decided to give it a go.  Our visit was delightful...Eleanor and Bruce helped us so much - a brochure on the local Tulip Festival, traffic and driving suggestions, local churches to attend, places to dine, and even some designer tips for our bathroom redo.  They  were very accomodating and endeavored to make their home feel like our home as well...they invited us to attend their family gathering on Mother's Day.  We thoroughly enjoyed ourselves...visiting with them again would be a pleasure.  

As a side note I would like to say the Airbnb is a great concept.    We loved staying in this quiet residential neighborhood - a wonderful Danish bakery (Larsens) , a fresh seafood store,  a grocery outlet, and a thrift store are close by.  The Nordic Museum is just a few minutes away and was an interesting place to visit.  "
80188,279430,2011-05-24,531915,Rusty,"We had a great time staying at Eleanor's beautiful guest suite.  Eleanor has thought of every detail to make your stay more comfortable.  Eleanor and Bruce are wonderful hosts with an expansive knowledge of the area.  And we were missing our pets - so we enjoyed visiting with their dog and cat, Roc and Scooter."
80188,292195,2011-05-31,625851,Dustin,"I couldn't have imagined a more incredible 2 night stay than the one provided by Eleanor and Bruce. Eleanor met me literally with open arms upon my arrival, her infectious smile making me feel at home instantly. Homemade cookies, an overflowing tray of bath delights to soothe the mind and soul and the gentle sound of tranquil music meeting me at each turn. Her garden was a paradise, large blooms highlighted by beautiful lighting coupled with the sun setting behind the mountains made for a breath taking view. The space provided was perfect! I truly couldn't have asked for more. I was so lucky to have such a wonderful stay with two truly magnificent people in their beautiful home! Thank you Eleanor and Bruce"
80188,298874,2011-06-05,631707,Chris,"Eleanor, 

Dan and Mich were thrilled not only that they found such a great place right in ballard but that you guys treated them so well.  Given, that I was flying these guys in from out of state for business it was important to me they were not only comfortable but that it was convenient.  It worked out perfectly, I don't think the beer in the fridge or the breakfast hurt anything either! ; )  

Thanks so much,

Chris"
80188,316131,2011-06-15,126900,Judy,Eleanor and Bruce were lovely hosts and their accommodations are so comfortable and pleasant. We were out a lot but it was always a pleasure to return to their place. We would happily stay with them again. 
80188,324026,2011-06-20,587513,Susan,"Wonderful stay. Excellent accomations. Gracious & generous hosts. All of our needs were met/exceeded. Would easily choose it again or suggest it to others.

80188,341712,2011-06-28,719741,Kyle & Dot,"Had an awesome time! First time using Airbnb and I must say, this is truly the way to travel! Hosts were awesome. Went over and above our expectations. I definitely recommend staying with Eleanor and Bruce! You'll be glad you did! Thanks for making our stay memorable! We will see you again I'm sure!"
80188,343232,2011-06-29,719741,Kyle & Dot,"We had an awesome time at the Olsen's. If your vacation takes you to the Seattle area, I definitely recommend staying here! Thanks for the great time! We will be back! "
80188,360846,2011-07-08,731361,Roberto,"Eleonor and Bruce were great hosts. Their place is well located and they do everything to make you feel like home, even fresh brew coffee in the morning. Their house is  really comfy and their garden is wonderful. Nice bed and shower, really private. The bus stop is just steps away from their place and you can go direct to downtown. A lot of good restaurants to have breakfast around this area.  I would definitely stay back at their place. "
80188,391237,2011-07-23,473488,Avril,"I was in Seattle for a conference and had a very comfortable and pleasant stay with Eleanor and Bruce.  The guest rooms are spotlessly clean, beautifully decorated, furnished with comfortable bedding and complete privacy.  Although I didn't do any cooking, the kitchen was well appointed for what i needed--coffee, fixing a snack, etc.  Eleanor and Bruce made me feel welcome and were ready and available to help with some around town logistics.  They are truly gracious and accommodating hosts.  I'd stay with them again and recommend this listing to others."
80188,408528,2011-07-31,730914,Kaysha,"We had a wonderful time staying at Eleanor and Bruce's North Beach home. The space is lovingly decorated and designed. The bed is the most comfortable bed, we've slept in for years! Eleanor thoughtfully provided us with stuffed animals and toys for our daughter to play with, which is so wonderful since when you travel, you can't bring enough toys. We would definitely come back again!"
80188,416082,2011-08-02,866376,Loree,"Eleanor and Bruce were warm and welcoming without being intrusive.  Their home as well as our accomodations were beautifully but comfortably appointed.  We enjoyed the calming dog-petting therapy that their dog, Rock, offered after a busy day in the city!  The near-by Ballard area was a treat.

Loree et al (Oregon)"
80188,449719,2011-08-16,740621,Jennifer,"Eleanor has created a beautiful, restful space and we were very comfortable in the accommodations, especially the bed which was great. She and Bruce greeted us enthusiastically and did not seem to mind our passing back and forth through their home office area to get to and from our rooms in the daylight basement. Their laundry area was in our mini-kitchen and Eleanor was very considerate about removing items from the dryer when we arrived back at 10:30 one evening dead tired, even though they weren't yet dry. The off-street parking situation was a little sketchy, since they had a friend staying with them the weekend while we were there so we had to shuffle the cars around a bit but no biggie."
80188,527254,2011-09-13,688494,Rebecca,"My parents stayed with Eleanor and Bruce for nearly 3 weeks whilst visiting Seattle from the UK.
The space was just wonderful as were Eleanor and Bruce. My parents loved staying with such wonderful hosts."
80188,808828,2011-12-27,1110283,Meghan,"Eleanor and Bruce were such wonderful hosts; their home is gorgeous, warm, and well taken care of, and we felt so welcome and secure staying there. Roc (their dog) is a sweetheart and a half, and they were great about helping us soothe our pretty high-nerved puppy, too. We would stay with them again in a heartbeat; I don't think either of us has enjoyed such a good night of sleep away from home in ages."
80188,1070075,2012-04-01,1572600,Jackie,"Eleanor and Bruce are AMAZING hosts.  Their home is warm, inviting, and comfortable… I could go on and on.   From the moment I arrived, Eleanor was gracious and accommodating…. there were even fresh baked cookies!  The guest suite is larger than I anticipated and beautifully decorated.  You can definitely see her interior design background come through in the décor. So far, this was my favorite AirBnb experience!  Without a doubt...I will definitely be staying here again. Thanks Eleanor! :)"
80188,1303009,2012-05-19,1985896,Pranav,"Most wonderful stay in the most beautiful house. Eleanor has decorated the place with such beauty and love that we did not come to know when the stay was over. We are glad that this stay gave us the opportunity to meet such beautiful people and we hope to stay in touch from now on.
"
80188,1324620,2012-05-21,2402746,Annette,"Very fortunately, we chose to stay with Eleanor and Bruce on a last minute trip to Seattle to visit family and friends.  The suite was charming, but even more charming and gracious were our hosts who went out of their way to provide personal extras and assistance. We arrived rather late, at 10:30 at night, and she welcomed us with absolutely lovely plate of freshly baked cookies. In the morning, she also gave us some milk for our coffee (something I greatly appreciated).  She also provided a dog bed for our dog Jingles.  The gardens are lovely and as a dog owner, I really appreciated that it was fenced in. We would definitely stay again and plan to roost in the beautiful backyard larger swaths of time! Thank you Eleanor and Bruce. It was lovely and we look forward to staying with you again."
80188,1388988,2012-05-31,2220316,Dennis,"We feel so fortunate in having found this place, this couple and this city to celebrate my wife's birthday. From California to Seattle for a far too short three days in this home away from home with Eleanor and Bruce as our Hosts adding so much to this memorable time.
A friendship that I suspect will be lasting, a nice part of town, driveway parking, easy access to city busses, a clean, well thought out, well designed, well appointed two bedroom apartment, a heated floor in the bathroom, a cozy kitchen, wireless if needed, a common area and beautiful back yard to share with us, and goodies to greet us--They seem to have thought of everything, and I am certain that you, similar to us, will find Eleanor and Bruce two of the nicest and most accommodating people you have met. We plan to stay there again, and probably again.
   
A Five Star Plus for everything.  Dennis and Nancy.

80188,1466872,2012-06-12,139336,Brenda,"We love staying at Eleanor's place, B R Guest.  Quiet, and so convenient if you want two bedrooms.  Nice to be able to prepare our own food.  The location makes it easy to get to downtown, Pike's Street Market, the Zoo and Greenlake Park, and Fremont.  Eleanor is a wonderful and warm host.  Her cookies are fantastic!

80188,1658455,2012-07-08,386674,Lara,"This was our first AirBnB experience and it started out perfect. Eleanor was very kind. She was leaving for a little vacation with her family when we arrived so we were only able to spend a short time with her. She made sure that our living area was impeccable and that we had all the information needed to get around Seattle. She even invited us to her cabin for a few days. The house is beautiful, charming, and cozy. The living quarters for the guest was equally as beautiful. We felt very at home and very comfortable. I would recommend their place to anyone looking for a Seattle experience.

80188,1798540,2012-07-25,139336,Brenda,"We've stayed at Eleanor and  Bruce's several times now and it's always lovely.  They are warm and gracious hosts.  It's very convenient to have two separate bedrooms when traveling with our teenager.  The neighborhood is quiet and safe and is 10 minutes by car by lighter-trafficked-ways to anywhere you'd like to go, Fremont, Woodland Park, Greenlake, Pike's Street Market, etc.  Parking is free.  This is where we stay when we are in Seattle.  "

The kitchen was well stocked with utensils and the linens were regularly changed. Their backyard is an oasis of beautiful plantings and lights, which makes a wonderful setting for relaxing and reading. There is a great outdoor grill and crab pot as well. I really enjoyed my stay with them and look forward to coming back again in the future. Thank you!"
80188,2267956,2012-09-11,1572600,Jackie,"I absolutely LOVE staying at Bruce & Eleanor's.  This was my second stay with them... and it was just as enjoyable as the last.  They are so personable and kind.  This is definitely  my ""go to"" place to stay whenever I visit Seattle.  Thanks Eleanor! :) "
80188,2334218,2012-09-18,3211932,Carole,"Many thanks to Eleanor for our stay in her guest quarters.  The space was beautifully decorated, clean and quiet.  There were sweet extras; Eleanor left bananas for us!  We were gone most of each day visiting family in the area, but we had a few minutes to chat with Eleanor and get the scoop on what is happening in the area.  Her friendliness puts the cap on the whole experience.  We were delighted with the accommodations and will suggest Eleanor's to other family when they visit. Seattle.  Thanks again!"
80188,2394429,2012-09-24,3371603,Jessie,"The suite was great and so were the hosts. Eleanor had provided a few grocery essentials to make sure we had a little something in the morning before we left the house - just in case we wouldn't be finding a great breakfast spot right away! I would stay there again.
only thing we missed was having a TV in case we wanted to catch a little news or a program in the morning or before bed."
80188,2435184,2012-09-28,2949153,Melanie,"Eleanor was absolutely a great host! She made me feel totally welcome and feel part of her family. The suite was well equipped with the little things I needed, including welcome cookies and a few items for a quick morning breakfast. She helped me to find out how to get places and gave recommendations if she could. She was a fantastic host and has now become a good friend :)
If you are an animal lover, then be prepared to have Rock (their dog) greet you with love!"

80188,3009612,2012-12-02,2269217,Kathy,What a delightful experience. From the moment we met Eleanor we knew we had made the perfect choice. The accommodations are spotlessly clean and beautifully decorated - but what makes BR Guest Suite so special is Eleanor. She is so warm and accommodating but never intrusive. We were hoping to find the perfect spot to stay when (frequently) visiting our new grandbaby boy. We were not disappointed and WILL BE BACK SOON !!! 
80188,5184702,2013-06-17,6361272,Danna,"Very very great place! The room decoration is amazing!  2 nights stay at Eleanor's house was wonderful! The best and most comfortable place I've stayed throughAirBnB! 

"
80188,5228753,2013-06-19,5806781,Ricardo,"We stayed at Eleanor's place with my wife, baby and a friend and we were very comfortable. The place is clean, cosy and well decorated. The garden makes such a difference when you want to spend some time on the sun, bbq along with few beers, relax and stretch your legs. If you have a car it's easy to reach downtown Seattle and Eleanor made everything for us to be as comfortable as we could. We travelled with our baby and Eleanor gave us all we need for the baby to be comfy as well."

Not only was it comfortable and stocked with everything we needed (including plenty of snacks and goodies), it was also beautifully decorated. 

By the time we left (we stayed two weeks), we felt like part of Eleanor and Bruce's family. Anything we needed, they were happy to supply, be it advice about transportation or Tupperware for our picnics. We loved hanging out with them and their sweet cat Scooter and dog Roc, especially at the backyard BBQ they invited us to!

We were sad to say goodbye, but look forward to staying at the Seattle North Beach B R Guest Suite again the next time we visit Seattle!"

They offer kindness, friendship and warmth which we greatly appreciated and found delightful and refreshing. They made us feel very welcome.  Their garden is relaxing and pretty and provides a great area to eat al fresco, which we made good use of.  Roc, their dog, is just gorgeous, you couldn't help but fall in love with him. Would we stay with them again most definitely.  We feel we have made 2 new friends.  Thank you so much Roy, Karen and Kim xxx"

80188,6575812,2013-08-17,8075642,Abi,Fantastic area downstairs in their home. We did not have the opportunity to interact much with our hosts because of our short stay but they were very welcoming and accommodating. The room was great along with all of the extras. We would stay there again if the opportunity arrises. 
80188,7094165,2013-09-06,155040,Prem,"As an independent sort, Eleanor's North Beach suite suited me perfectly.  I was in town to tend to my daughter post-surgery, and needed to come and go as the wind blew me.  The back yard served as an ideal place to entertain old friends under the shady arbor.  Eleanor is a kind and gracious host."
80188,7606046,2013-09-26,8375005,Mari,"We thoroughly enjoyed our 5 day stay at Bruce and Eleanor's lovely

80188,11208035,2014-03-24,2236971,Micheline,We had a wonderful time at Eleanor and Bruce's place. They were away for the weekend but had their daughter meet us at the house making check in a breeze. She recommended some amazing places down the road in Ballard. Our weekend in seattle exploring other neighbourhoods (Esp Ballard) was fantastic. We loved the extras in the house and appreciated the home baked goods ( though due to dietary restrictions we were unable to eat it) but loved the fruit that was offered. Thanks so much guys!

"
80188,13103260,2014-05-19,15105103,Nancy,"Eleanor epitomizes the concept of ""host"" as she made me welcome in numerous ways. Her initial reply was super prompt; she answered all my questions about transportation with links and lists and suggestions, and her many communications  reminded me of my visit. At her ""bnb"" home I was welcomed like a friend and shown all the amenities, which are very nice, from snacks and filtered water to clean accommodations and maps."
80188,13440513,2014-05-27,15287603,Ying,"My first experience with Eleanor on airbnb was great. I felt so lucky to find a place like Eleanor's. It's in a very quiet neighborhood but not far from bus station. The house , the yard, everything, is nice. I fall in love with their place immidtely. My room was very clean, comfy, and homey. It's exactly what I was looking for. I usually don't sleep very well in a strange place, but I slept just fine at Eleanor's house. They have everything ready for the guests. Very thoughtful. There were books, magazines, maps and bus schedules. There were some food, coffee, tea and drinks. I loved their homemade cookies !  It's just like a home, so cozy and relaxing. When I arrived, Eleanor's daughtor Deborah was waiting for me, so was their cat, Scooter. He actually walked me into the house. When I left, Scooter came out the door and sitting on the driveway seeing me off. I was so touched! Everyone was so friendly. Thank you Eleanor, thank you for waiting for me at the first night ，just to give me a welcome hug. Three nights was short, but I did enjoy my stay, and I had a great time in Seattle. I miss their place already. I miss Scooter too. He likes to talk to me :)
PLS: Eleanor was very thoughtful and helpful. She got me all the information that I needed, so it was easily to find my way  to her place. "
80188,15043143,2014-07-01,14763074,Sarah,"I typically am a pretty private person and like to have a separate space without much interference with others but Eleanor and Bruce changed all of that. I couldn't have asked for better hosts! I was warmly welcomed and accommodated in every regard. Their place is perfectly situation away from the hustle and bustle yet transit is an easy walk with access to pretty much anything your heart desires be it the Space Needle, downtown, Ballard locks, etc.There are also a lot of places within an easy walk distance including grocery, drug store, parks, and much more. As an added bonus, the views are simply phenomenal. A short walk and you're by the water with views of the snow-capped Olympics. Safe, quiet, serene. Truly is a gem and well worth it. Oh.... and do try the banana bread! Very good and the perfect treat in the morning or as you head out on an adventure. Those special touches are what make this place above and beyond a typical stay, even a five star hotel. "
80188,16284398,2014-07-24,4307931,Rachel,"Room/amenities are as pictured-very nicely decorated, bright space. Eleanor was a sweet host-  Although she wasn't at the house during my stay she gave me a very detailed walk through and introduction via phone.  This is a great space with a small kitchen, and private bathroom.  Loved the location as it is a very short drive to downtown Ballard for great restaurants, cafes, and shopping. "
80188,16370881,2014-07-26,17271999,Barbara,"Although my friend and I were unfortunately unable to meet Eleanor, as she had to be out of town, her warmth and generosity were very evident in our phone conversations and with the welcoming and very comfortable space she has created.  As our first Airbnb experience, it was an extremely positive one.  The distance from downtown that originally concerned me wasn't an issue at all and I would certainly consider staying in this lovely suite again."
80188,16556460,2014-07-29,16506718,Brandon,"Great hosts, wonderful place!  I put my parents up in Eleanor's guest suite while they were in town visiting, and they loved it.  Worked out perfectly, would definitely recommend."
80188,17053829,2014-08-06,358689,Bonnie,"We thoroughly enjoyed our 3 day stay with Eleanor and Bruce. We were greeted warmly and welcomed with cookies and banana bread. The suite was very comfortable. Although the weather was warm in Seattle, the suite was cooled by the Puget Sound and the constant fan the circulated the air.  There was a delightful breeze circulating through the suite. We enjoyed getting to know them on several occasions. The suite's kitchen/laundry area was beautifully appointed and had everything we needed: coffee maker, toaster, refrigerator and microwave. When we return to Seattle, we hope to return to Eleannor's suite. "
80188,18041330,2014-08-20,802451,Rhonda,"We were met with fresh fruit and cookies, simple instructions and easy communication to get into the space.  The space was very warm, clean and comfortable.  I would definitely stay there again!

If you are using public transportation it´s not really close to downton but there are many bus stops near the house (rapid rides). The Ballard district is not far and it´s a nice place to hang out at night.
Thank you again Eleanor and Bruce, we will recommend your place!
"
80188,18959569,2014-09-03,18475773,Leslie,"My daughter and I thoroughly enjoyed our stay in Eleanor and Bruce's suite. They have obviously put a great deal of thought into designing and furnishing the space, and it is comfortable and impeccably clean. Eleanor and Bruce are also very welcoming hosts. I highly recommend the BR Guest suite as an excellent hotel alternative for Seattle visits."
80188,19222441,2014-09-08,14880015,Vicki,"Eleanor and her husband were so very nice.  They welcomed us and let us put our baggage in their home earlier than the usual check in time which helped us so much.  Everything was even better than the picture and description - you had to be there!!.  Parking space was great, privacy was exceptional into the back yard and our entrance.  There were fresh cookies and fruit out and fruit drink and yogurt in refrigerator.  There were also little extras - popcorn, oatmeal, etc.  The tourist booklets were also handy.  I got up early the next morning and roamed the beautiful garden area.  There is a dog and cat but hardly ever saw them.  Hated not being able to get better acquainted but our time was limited and full.  My brother lives in Seattle so he knew exactly where it was located and said it was fine.  Pretty quiet street.  Everything was absolutely wonderful and if ever in Seattle again - I would love to stay there.  "
80188,20225491,2014-09-26,15716043,Paul,We had a wonderful stay at Eleanor & Bruce's home.  We were welcomed with open arms & made to feel very much at home They are great hosts & we will be back again.
80188,20724238,2014-10-04,4518008,Kayla,I loved staying with Eleanor and Bruce! They have a beautiful home and are very welcoming. It is a great location that is accessible to various bus lines that go downtown. They were helpful and printed out directions for us and had lots of suggestions about things to do in the area. I would definitely recommend it to a friend. Thanks 
80188,20849706,2014-10-06,19518204,Erin,Eleanor greeted us when we arrived -- even with freshly baked cookies! She had thought through so many details and the space to stay was comfortable and a delight after long days at the curling rink.  She made my teammate and I feel very welcome. I would stay there again in a heartbeat. 
80188,21179317,2014-10-12,22170037,Anh-Tu,"Eleanor and Bruce's house is very cozy and a straight shot to downtown. My sister and I loved the two BR set up on a separate lower level, especially the heated bathroom floor. The private driveway was great for the security of our rental car. Roc is adorable and Eleanor is really accommodating. Even with our awkward schedules she had time to chat with us and recommend places to see. The suite is furnished with everything we could need while traveling, including cookies!
Our trip wasn't nearly long enough to see Seattle for the first time. We would definitely love staying with Eleanor and Bruce again."
80188,21665318,2014-10-21,19977993,Kristian,"Stayed 9 days at Eleanors and had a blast. Their place felt like home. Eleanor and her husband Bruce are fantastic hosts. My friend got the cold and they provided honey and lemon. She also printed out bus schedules and made sure we had everything we needed during our stay. 

The location is perfect. Its a quiet safe area but still close to downtown. We had a car but you only need to walk 2 minutes to catch the bus. When we went out to the party scene we used the bus. Its like 30-40 minutes to downtown. 

Thank you Eleanor and Bruce for a fantastic stay. I will definetly come back next time I'm in Seattle. Highly recommended."
80188,22533929,2014-11-09,22218692,Catherine,"What a perfectly comfortable suite was awaiting me at the Olsen's. Eleanor and Bruce were so helpful, and they supplied my kitchen with everything I could have needed. (I especially loved the heated floor in the bath!)  This was my first AirBnB experience, but definitely not my last! When I return to Seattle, I know my suite at the Olsen's will be my first choice."
80188,23233513,2014-11-25,17265322,Jonah,"I did not stay with Eleanor. Had a hotel booking fall through and used insta_book at the very last minute, and not entirely familiar with the process so when I didn't get a confirmation I booked a hotel elsewhere. Eleanor did contact me shortly thereafter, she was very helpful and we sorted it out with airbnb quite easily and quickly. I can't speak for the place because I never saw it, but I am sure she is a great host and will look her up next time I am in Seattle. "
80188,23254350,2014-11-26,3217622,Sarah,"Very nice apartment for me and my mom, comfortable beds, fast wifi.  Eleanor left snacks and showed us around the place, although we were just there for one night.  And, the bathroom floor was heated!  She was very friendly, and the place was in a convenient location and easy to find."
80188,24254155,2014-12-23,9094770,Rui,"Eleanor made a great host, helped a lot. we had a feeling like back home by her. whole place was very clean and we had everthing we need, in Kichen and Bathroom.  "
80188,25081581,2015-01-06,22342976,Alice,"Eleanor and Bruce welcomed us warmly into our private apartment in their home.  The accommodations were excellent, the location near buses.  We'd planned on renting a car, and never needed one.

We've already scheduled our next stay at our new ""Go To"" place in Seattle.  We'll be frequent visitors, as we have family there."
80188,25213120,2015-01-09,25037359,Typhoon,"Our guest had a great trip with Eleanor and Bruce.
They are the best hosts, who made you stay at home and provided many kinds of food for 
the guest including very nice home-made cookies.
We will definitely introduce our guests and friends to drop in this wonderful aprtment.
It is super clean and tidy,which is also very safe and private. 
We appriciate a lot.
Highly recommend."
80188,25509783,2015-01-18,20552585,Yvonne,"Eleanor and Bruce are easy and nice to communicate with couple. They are warm, respective and has such a designed house! We would recommend everyone who'd like to stay at Seattle to live in her house."
80188,26705788,2015-02-17,2675734,Pamela,"Eleanor and Bruce were very hospitable during our 3 night stay over Valentine's weekend. They gave us a tour of their house, researched bus schedules, provided non-fat milk for our morning coffee and cereal, and even provided gardening stakes for transporting the plant we purchased in Seattle. The suite is exactly as described. We used the kitchenette for several meals including a ""gourmet"" Valentine's dinner. The immediate neighborhood is a little sketchy with auto body shops and massage parlors within a few blocks. However, we did not experience any problems and enjoyed dinner in nearby Ballard and coffee in the adjacent Blue Ridge neighborhood (as well as plant shopping at Swanson's nursery which is within walking distance of the Suite). We would return again. Thank you Eleanor & Bruce for a comfortable ""home away from home"" stay!"
80188,27371337,2015-03-02,14250029,Dan,"Best host ever!  I met Eleanor and Bruce when I was moving to the city and looking for a place to live.  Not only did I have a charming home to stay in, but two knowledgeable Seattleites who had a wealth of experience and recommendations.  The place was clean, comfortable, and in a nice neighborhood.  But the best part of it was truly the warmth and welcome of my hosts.  By the time I found a place to live, I had made two new friends who I am looking forward to spending more time with now that I live in the same city. "
80188,27510071,2015-03-06,9685280,Amy,"Incredibly beautiful unique spot, wonderful neighborhood, truly delightful hosts. Easy to communicate with, super sweet & welcoming with all kinds of goodies & extras including fresh cookies! This space is perfect for a quick stay but has everything needed for a longer stay too. Bed is super comfy, neighborhood quiet, safe & easily walkable. Eleanor is very helpful. We were able to have our little dog with us, Eleanor left out water and food bowls for him. We would definitely stay here again and see no reason to ever stay in a hotel with hosts and spots like this one! "
80188,28054845,2015-03-16,5038050,Rich,"One of the best and most memorable AirBnB experiences I have had.

Clean.  Wonderful hosts. Definitely would plan on coming back."
80188,28271809,2015-03-21,3373453,Nora,"Eleanor was very friendly, welcoming, and helpful. The guest space was nicely decorated and furnished, and met our needs well. "
80188,28418556,2015-03-23,28705484,Joey,My stay at Eleanor's home was better than I expected! She was always quick to respond any questions and tried to make our stay as enjoyable as possible. The space was really clean and cozy. Would definitely recommend! 
80188,28733732,2015-03-29,4996897,Darcy,My granddaughters and I enjoyed our time at Eleanor's Airbnb North Beach Seattle retreat.  We were greeted and treated like family and spoiled by all the little touches and extended kindnesses.  I will be looking forward to returning next time I have an occasion to visit Seattle.
80188,29322271,2015-04-06,9621405,Tianmin,This is the best airbnb experience I have ever. The place is so pretty and Eleanor was so kind and nice to us and made us feel at home. We really enjoyed our stay here. 
80188,29928706,2015-04-14,28984330,Steve,"Highest Recommendation!  My husband and I are seasoned travelers, and we are pleased to give Eleanor, our host, the highest recommendation possible. It was a pleasure staying in their beautiful home from the moment of our arrival until our departure. The accommodations, on a separate level, (!) were private, comfortable, and beautiful. Parking off street is a major plus. The location is lovely and convenient. We look forward to staying there in the future!"
80188,30504307,2015-04-23,29177924,Jessica,"My parents stayed with Eleanor to meet their grand daughter. Eleanor was a wonderful hostess! She was very informative but yet also very respectful of their privacy. The unit was very clean and well thought out, she didn't miss a beat.  Not to mention the yard is gorgeous. I would recommend staying with them and will definitely have family stay there in the future."
80188,30799208,2015-04-27,8375005,Mari,We had another delightful stay at Eleanor and Bruce's lovely place.
80188,31882067,2015-05-11,28262916,Daniel,"I needed a place for my mom to stay while she was visiting from out of town, and this unit turned out to be a perfect fit! Eleanor was a great hostess, she was very accommodating and made my mom feel welcome. The unit was very clean and had all the necessities one could need. I would definitely recommend staying here and will likely book it again in the future."
80188,32145816,2015-05-14,32869668,Zachary,"Eleanor and Bruce were fantastic hosts, the accommodations were wonderful and the conversation even better. We had business in Seattle and it was easy to get to the highway. The rooms were comfortable and the shower was heavenly. We keep some pretty weird hours and it was easy to come and go without (hopefully) disturbing our hosts. Would definitely recommend!"
80188,32639090,2015-05-19,10134755,Kelly,"Eleanor and her husband Bruce made us feel so very welcome in their home.  My friend and her 9 month old stayed with me on a business trip and Eleanor was so accommodating, setting up a crib and offering a high chair. It made for easy traveling with a young one.  Their home and yard feel so welcoming thanks to them and our stay was very relaxing.  I will certainly seek this rental out again.  Thank you both for your hospitality."
80188,33297559,2015-05-26,32872967,Clare,"Eleanor and Bruce could not have been better hosts! The location was perfect, the apartment clean and tidy, and the hosts gracious. The apartment was stocked with all the necessities including coffee, yogurt, fruit, iron, washer/dryer, shampoo, beverages-- really anything you might need! To top it off, our dog (who came with us to stay) was treated like a queen, with a gorgeous backyard to play in and Eleanor and Bruce letting her out when we were away sightseeing. Would definitely recommend this spot to anyone and would stay again!  "
80188,33817563,2015-06-01,29912409,Mark,"Comfortable stay with everything you need and most hospitable hosts. It is a long way from the centre of Seattle, about 35 mins by direct bus."
80188,34040681,2015-06-03,2221495,Shane,"The interior design of the guestroom was impressive, the best i have seen so far. The hosts, Eleanor and Bruce were very welcoming, they even gave us a tour of their house which was exceptionally well-decorated, it reminded me of those showroom pieces at interior design conventions. The facilities were more than adequate as well; the beds were comfortable, there was distilled hot/cold water from the kitchen tap, the bathroom tiles were heated. Apart from some generator noise and floorboard creaking noise in the morning, the stay at Eleanor's place was more than pleasant and added a special touch to our trip:)"
80188,34219583,2015-06-06,20785338,Pris,"My mom and I were on a road trip and stayed here for 3 nights. This was our first time here, but we already felt like we were home. Eleanor and Bruce were amazing hosts and made sure we were comfortable and had everything we needed. They have done a great job with their home...everything was clean and fully stocked. There were cookies ready in the kitchen, heated bathroom floors and a washer/dryer...more than we could have asked for and better than a hotel! The location is great too, with easy access to coffeeshops and groceries and if you go south on their street, it'll eventually take you right to Pike Place Market (easy navigation!). We will definitely look to stay here the next time we come to Seattle."
80188,34539608,2015-06-09,28262156,Tim,"My family came to visit me so I booked them a stay at this lovely B&B since I live in a small studio apartment.  The pictures are a perfect representation of the rooms and they are very clean.  I have very high standards of cleanliness, and her place was spotless and perfect! Eleanor is such a sweet, pleasant, and welcoming person; we all had really great conversations with her.  I will certainly be booking this place again when my Mom is in town!  Thank you Eleanor!"
80188,35059403,2015-06-15,22342976,Alice,"Our second stay at this BnB was even better than the first, as we arrived feeling like family!  Eleanor and Bruce are wonderful, welcoming, interesting people and caring hosts.  Their BnB is very well appointed, very comfortable, and their garden is lovely as well. We were comfortable ""doing nothing"" there during our down time.

As we visit Seattle frequently, this is now our second home.  We look forward to our next visit."
80188,35552101,2015-06-20,31100876,Pat,"We received a very warm welcome from Eleanor and Bruce and want to thank them for their hospitality.  We found the location perfect for sightseeing around Seattle.  The Guest Suite is beautifully decorated, clean and very comfortable.  This was my first airbnb experience and it was wonderful- thank you again Eleanor and Bruce! "
80188,35681490,2015-06-21,33658442,Kangqiao,"This is definitely one of the best places I've ever stayed. During my visit to Seattle, I've spent one night in a 4-star hotel and one night in Eleanor's B R Guest Suits, and the experience here is much better, not to mention the price is much cheaper for three of us. The design of the suits by Eleanor is more than superb. The wall pictures decorate the place very well and there are stories behind them. I especially like the sailing ship model which was a first date of issue model back to 1960s.

We arrived pretty late and surprisingly Eleanor and Bruce has prepared cookies and orange juice for us! Wow!

Eleanor is very nice and welcoming. We haven't met Bruce because we got up too late the other morning. Eleanor showed us a lot of interesting stuff and the lovely garden. We had a good conversation and even sang song 'Puff the magic dragon' together. I was born in late 1980s but have been so into songs of 1960s. Those songs will always remind me how time flies and to embrace life everyday.

I would definitely recommend! "
80188,35797889,2015-06-22,15443948,Michaela,Eleanor was a wonderful host. The space was extremely clean and comfortable. My family and I were able to fully relax  after a day out in downtown Seattle. Beautiful design and decor. 
80188,36766750,2015-07-01,2426963,Jean,"The hostess was very helpful, showing us the place, placing food for us and having it in the kitchen.  She showed us how to use the various things that were available to us.  She was helpful, friendly, and kind."
80188,37074342,2015-07-04,35139874,Daniella,"The space was great. Only used one of the two bedrooms in the basement suite but could have even brought a third guest and fit comfortably. The neighborhood is a super nice residential neighborhood, felt safe leaving the rental car parked outside. Although it was very hot weather when we were there (as high as 90's), Eleanor turned on the fan for us and the whole suite was a fantastically cool temperature. Would stay here again!"
80188,37557890,2015-07-08,22628033,Jean,Eleanor sent info on GF restaurants as I am a celiac prior to my visit.  She called from her cabin twice to check on me to see if there was anything we needed.
80188,37693296,2015-07-09,30655131,Jae,"Eleanor was very friendly and the place was very comfortable.  Coffee, fruit and juice was a nice added bonus."
80188,37961247,2015-07-12,7388470,Megan,"Eleanor and Bruce have a wonderful place in Seattle. Their spot was so cozy, quiet, and clean. They were so helpful with recommendations and even entertained our spirited 5 year old while we loaded and unloaded our car. I would definitely stay here again. It was a very convenient neighborhood, especially with a rental car. Thanks for everything Eleanor and Bruce!"
80188,38212663,2015-07-13,31014035,Kiki,The rooms are very clean and tasteful. In the morning we had a nice conversation with Eleanor and learned amazing stories about her. We had a great time and I'd recommend this place.
80188,38584939,2015-07-17,5090843,Julianna,"We had a lovely time! The accommodations were great and the area was very convenient, especially to Ballard, which is a great place for shopping/walking/eating!"
80188,38866691,2015-07-19,35423021,Lisa,My husband and I were in Seattle for only a few days but we really enjoyed our stay! It's a short ride into downtown and has easy access to anywhere in Seattle. The basement apartment is very nice and we had everything we needed. 
80188,39161668,2015-07-21,461890,Cobi,"We had a pleasant stay in Eleanor's house. The location was convenient, the room was nice and clean, and the hosts were so friendly and helpful.  We'll definitely go back for our future Seattle trips. Thank you very much, Eleanor. "
80188,39716443,2015-07-25,626760,Daniel,"You'd think I'd checked into the honeymoon suite at some place at the intersection of the Ritz Carlton and a lovely British cottage. Eleanor and Bruce were exceedingly, naturally friendly. They've outdone themselves on the guest rooms, which are immaculate and thoughtfully supplied with microwave popcorn, cookies, and fruit! I walked to the nearby discount grocery store and made a killer dinner on their grill in their amazing garden!"
80188,40145801,2015-07-28,38171200,Laura,"The B R Guest suite was a great home base during our first trip to Seattle! The location was convenient for exploring downtown, Ballard, Golden Gardens Park, Bellevue, and the Snoqualmie areas. With a rental car, we were able to get around easily and have a free place to park the car overnight. Uber and bus transport were super accessible from B R Guest as well. We loved getting to know Eleanor and Bruce, as we were always greeted with warm conversation and usually fresh baked goods! The space was clean and comfortable for us. We were able to use essentials like a hairdryer and ironing board when getting ready for a wedding. Eleanor and Bruce even went above and beyond and helped us find a good option for lodging when we ended up missing our flight and being stuck in Seattle an additional night (B R Guest was already booked that night). We highly recommend this Airbnb and would definitely visit again!"
80188,40394687,2015-07-30,28123449,Yaming,Eleanor was excellent in communicating all facets of the rental of her house. We would definitely recommend her house as a rental. Hopefully we'll be able to come back next summer.
80188,40474349,2015-07-31,19633074,Chien-Tzen,"Eleanor was wonderful and very attentive. She stocked our room with various snacks, fruits, and freshly baked bookies. The rooms were clean and comfortable. My family and I enjoyed our trip to Seattle very much. Thank you Eleanor for having us!"
80188,41069498,2015-08-04,31851273,Stephanie,"We so enjoyed our stay with Eleanor and Bruce. Their home is well located for catching a bus to downtown or walking to a great little fish restaurant. They were so helpful I giving us suggestions.  We appreciated Eleanor's artistic touches both in the house and in the garden. Especially her little, ripe SunGold tomatoes!
We had 3 adults, which was a bit cramped, but the Seattle weather was perfect and so we were really only there in the evening. 
Thanks Eleanor for all your help.  And for the use of your washer and dryer."
80188,41299563,2015-08-05,20333327,Tara,"What a sweet little space in Seattle!  Eleanor and Bruce were great hosts-- very welcoming, kind, and so helpful.  One word sums up this listing and the hosts:  adorable!  

Thanks, Eleanor and Bruce!!"
80188,41342270,2015-08-07,7946360,Shirish,"Eleanor has a great place. We stayed just the one night and it was very comfortable. I had the opportunity to talk to both her and her husband and what a lovely, amiable couple they are. The home made cookies were outstanding. The location of this place is only a short walking distance to a host of grocery stores and a very nice greek restaurant which Eleanor recommended. All in all a lovely stay, all be it a short one. Would definitely stay again. "
80188,41594768,2015-08-08,32931730,Denise,"My husband and I had a wonderful stay in this welcoming and comfortable home. Eleanor greeted us when we arrived to provide information regarding the housing and amenities. The accommodations were clean and attractively and beautifully furnished. The home was in a quiet neighborhood in a convenient location offering a private outside living area. When in the area in the future, we will seek to stay here again. The recommendations for local attractions or businesses were helpful."
80188,41855371,2015-08-09,11820288,Rozana,Lee loved staying with Eleanor in Seattle. She made us feel very welcome and was flexible from the start. We loved the cosy feel of the space too. We would recommend staying with Eleanor to anyone visiting Seattle. 
80188,42116126,2015-08-11,2402818,Nina,Eleanor was very hospitable and even left homemade cookies and healthy snacks in the refrigerator! The basement apartment was very clean and beautiful. We enjoyed relaxing in the lovely backyard and felt comfortable and welcome.
80188,42316451,2015-08-12,6835554,Jc,"Thanks so much for letting me use the laundry! It was such a cute basement studio! Very comfy bed. And even though I did not interact that much with the hosts (due to my arrival time, etc), they were welcoming! The freshly baked cookies were a nice touch, too."
80188,42585590,2015-08-14,4157947,Gabrielle,"Eleanor was wonderful. The place was impeccable, clean and very cozy - we felt very much at home. I was a little surprised we were charged a fee for my friend's 2 month old baby but other than that, we were very happy with our stay. Guests have access to Bruce and Eleanor's lovely garden where we were able to hang out and eat dinner. Overall great place and host. "
80188,43641778,2015-08-21,37895956,Donna,"We arrived several hours late due to weather-related flight delays and were surprised to find Eleanor at her desk at 11 PM and ready to give us a brief tour of our accommodations. The space was clean, attractive and the bed very comfortable.  The neighborhood is very quiet and close to everything we needed for our stay in Seattle and the day trip we took to see Mount Rainier.  Eleanor stocked the kitchen area with coffee, creamer, oatmeal, yogurt, water, fruit, popcorn, homemade cookies and Seattle guides.  Our space and what we saw of the home and garden gave evidence of our hosts’ design talents and, along with the natural beauty we observed visiting the area, gave spark to our own semi-dormant creativity.  Bruce and Eleanor are interesting and hospitable people.  We recommend considering Seattle North Beach B R Guest Suite for your stay in Seattle."
80188,44407942,2015-08-26,30666329,Simon,"An amazing place to stay.  Lots of privacy, and the host was very friendly.  If you are looking for a great place to stay while in Seattle, this is it.  Clean, easy to find, and tons of space.        "
80188,45367856,2015-09-02,21688249,Jonathan,This was the best AirBNB experience I've ever had. Eleanor & Bruce made us feel completely welcome and went extra lengths to make sure our needs were accommodated for. The space was more than comfortable and far exceeded my expectations.
80188,46126723,2015-09-08,35330295,W C,Eleanor was very welcoming. The listing was accurate and the facilities met all of our needs. We were in Seattle for a family wedding. The rental was centrally located making it easy to drive to all the events for the weekend. The off-street parking was a plus. We would definitely stay here again.
80188,46888258,2015-09-14,2497839,Valerie,Very caring hosts who really go out of their way to make you feel at home.  Very clean and impeccable.  
80188,48034854,2015-09-22,33078773,Elaine,"Eleanor and Bruce are a great host and we spend 3 nice nights at their place. The bedrooms and bathroom are comfortable and pretty! They made some warm cookies for us and put some food and fruits in our rooms. The are a nice couple and always help us to find a way to solve the trouble we met. I highly recommend this place for people looking for a place to stay in Seattle. 
"
80188,48454401,2015-09-26,8515648,Ashish,The listing is quite detailed and accurate. Eleanor gave us a very warm welcome and we had a very good time at this place. Eleanor has put in lot of details to the cozy house which will take you a few hours to figure all out! Worth a experience.
80188,48904883,2015-09-29,8073917,Andrea,"What a lovely place to stay in Seattle! Eleanor and Bruce were outstanding hosts - they answered all my questions prior to arriving and were incredibly friendly and welcoming when we arrived at the property. They were very happy to provide great recommendations for things to see and local restaurants.

The suite is very nice and a perfect size for 2-3 people. Both beds were very comfortable, the kitchen was fully stocked (including very thoughtful breakfast supplies and tea/coffee!), and the bathroom was great. The whole place included very thoughtful details - like decorative towels - that show how considerate the hosts are.

The property is a quick bus ride from the city on the 'Rapid D'; Ballard is even closers and full of yummy bars and restaurants."
80188,50607837,2015-10-12,21580973,Dhira,Elinor was helpful from the moment I imitated contact. Giving advice and prompt communication throughout. Her care and attention is without a doubt something that will bring us back to Seattle.

The location is very quiet, comfortable, and conveniently located in Ballard. I especially enjoyed the heated bathroom floor, and a few sweet treats provided for my arrival. I was visiting alone, but this would also be perfect for 2-3."

需要提醒的是，整栋楼的锅炉在地下室的客厅里，燃烧时噪音很大。其他一切都好。

very good lovely place.
peaceful and comfortable.
Eleanor is very kind,enthusiastic,lovely.
we have a very happy time there.thank you so much."

This was one of their first times renting for airbnb and our experience with the actual place wasn't great. This location is best for those not traveling with a car and who want to explore all that Seattle has to offer. The location is amazing, just a few blocks from Pike Place Market and the Symphony, one block from the light rail station, kitty corner from the art museum, etc. The place is great esp if you plant to spend most of your time out in the city. Note: There is no AC for the summer time and even with the fan provided it was very uncomfortable. "
5563136,27634102,2015-03-08,16530440,Aaron,"Wow, what a great experience. The place was perfect for what we needed. Good location, pretty good parking and wonderful value. I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a clean and comfortable space for a short term stay in Seattle's Capitol Hill area."
5563136,27858318,2015-03-13,7381030,Sybil,"Description  and photos were totally accurate. The host Jonathan was there to meet me exactly as arranged.  He helpfully showed me around, explained how to use everything,  answered questions, and suggested  places to go in the neighborhood. 

 This place is pretty perfect!  On a tree-lined residential street with older wooden homes.  Clean and spotless. Lovely upper floor of two story heritage character  house with windows facing all directions.  Lots of air and light.  Even though you are super-close walking distance to restaurants, bars, shops, etc it is completely quiet at night.  Bedroom faces multiple backyards with trees...Bird song woke me up!  Memory-foam mattress was so very comfy..warm, fluffy quilts. 
   Updated-modern kitchen.  Lovely deep bathtub. 
    Large TV with surround-sound and high-def was great.

    It is an older house, so Air B`B ers should be prepared for not living in a slick, super-modern condo. This has comfort, charm and hominess instead!

  Would look forward to staying there again.

5563136,28231860,2015-03-20,10096294,Carlos,The place is great and the location is amazing. The hosts were extremely helpful.
5563136,28351270,2015-03-22,2652255,Jaspreet,"The description of the listing was accurate and the house was easy to find. Jonathan was out of town so we coordinated key pick-up with a friend of his, which worked out fine. There are lots of good restaurants nearby and it's not a far walk to even more shops on Pike & Pine. To future users, I would recommend having clear communication with Jonathan beforehand regarding exactly where the parking spot is and how to work the entertainment system."
5563136,30451461,2015-04-22,28532542,Brian,"It was a true pleasure to rent from Jonathan. Communication was prompt and the photos and description were very accurate. This great apartment was perfect for our needs as it was spacious, exceptionally clean, and in a perfect Capitol Hill location. I highly recommend Jonathan and his apartment, and hope to be able to rent it again for our next stay in Seattle in a few months."
5563136,30899320,2015-04-28,15855805,Sarah,"We really enjoyed our stay in Jonathan's duplex in Capitol Hill! Jonathan was very good at communicating throughout the process and was there when we arrived to walk us through the apartment and make sure we knew where everything was. He was also flexible with our arrival and departure times, which we really appreciated! The apartment was very, very clean and felt really cozy and homey. They were very thoughtful in leaving us a list of great places to eat and visit in the area. There are a ton of great restaurants, coffee shops and bars in the neighborhood within easy walking distance. I would stay here again in a heartbeat!"
5563136,31136563,2015-05-02,26221457,Meryll,A nice quiet place that is conveniently located to lots of great spots.

5563136,32018901,2015-05-12,32278091,P.J.,"This was the perfect home base for a few nights in Seattle. Convenient to Pike and Pine, 15th Street, and surrounded by the beautiful Capitol Hill neighborhood, everywhere we wanted to go was walkable. Also close to Volunteer Park with amazing city views from the water tower! The space was large and well-appointed, clean, and Jonathan was an attentive and responsive host. "
5563136,33153918,2015-05-25,22326880,Monique,"I had an opportunity to stay at Johnathan's Capitol Hill apartment as my first Airbnb experience. Johnathan was available and provided a prompt response to any of my questions. The apartment is very nice and clean and as another reviewer notes, the pictures are quite accurate. The apartment is also located in a prime area with easy access to great restaurants in Capitol Hill.  I also relied on public transportation during my Seattle visit and this apartment is nearby several bus lines. Overall, my experience was great and I'd recommend Johnathan's apartment to anyone looking for a nice place in a prime location. "
2909809,13157256,2014-05-20,15060009,Jesus,"Katie and her fiancées place was fantastic. My partner and I are major walkers when it comes to exploring new cities and the location of the apartment was great for getting to and from great sites. When there was a need to venture further, car services around town were easily accessible and inexpensive from their local. The neighborhood felt safe which was a huge plus since we stayed out pretty late at many of the nearby bars. Great eating and chilling spots by the apartment topped off a wonderful weekend to a fabulous city. Thanks again Katie for trusting us to spend time in your wonderful pad. "
2909809,13367928,2014-05-26,8953267,Jeremy,Katie was an excellent host and very accommodating to our schedule. We really enjoyed the price point and the location of her apartment. The apartment was cute and really reflected her artsy personality. Everything was in order and communication was cake. Thanks so much for a wonderful Seattle trip!
2909809,14367663,2014-06-17,8464768,Gordon,"Katie was a very gracious host, although we didn't get to meet her.  She has a very comfy apartment in the Capital Hill neighborhood of Seattle that overlooks the Space Needle.  It is a good central location for exploring the Capital Hill area.  

The bed was VERY comfy and her home was well furnished and worked out great for us.  The ONLY downside (and this is completely out of Katie's control) is that parking is difficult to find.  We spent quite a bit of time waiting for someone to leave before we could park.  If you have a small car, scooter or use mass transit...you probably won't have a problem."
2909809,14636522,2014-06-23,16146559,Charis,Katie was an excellent host and very thoughtful/helpful. The flat is very interesting and had everything someone would need.
2909809,15738602,2014-07-14,17946407,Miles,"Katie's apartment is a great place to stay when in Seattle. A seamless transition in and out, with great views of downtown from the living room. Would recommend to anyone. "
2909809,16186332,2014-07-22,18290250,Deborah,Many things to like about this place.  Great location - lots of places to visit on foot and felt safe walking around even as a single woman.  Loved the apartment - so much better than any hotel. Comfey and made you feel at home besides great view.  Best of all was Katie.  She checked in and made sure I had no issues during various points of travel.  Also had great tips on the area and transport from the airport.  
2909809,17885622,2014-08-18,5008075,Justen,Katie was a great host. Her apartment was bright and airy with beautiful views. It's located in a great neighborhood to boot. I would definitely stay there again!
2909809,19970303,2014-09-21,21104851,Michael,"Katie's apartment was fantastic! Grat big bright windows, and centrally located in Capitol Hill. The area felt safe and very walkable. Communication+ checkin/checkout was easy peasy.    There are plenty of great restaurants and bars,   and if youre feeling like walking, the Space Needle or Pike's Place Market are a nice 30 minute walk down hill !  I would definitely love to stay here again next time I visit Seattle."
2909809,27220243,2015-02-28,16672123,Eli,Katie and Trent were really nice. Their apartment is conveniently located close to everything.

It was easy to get into the apartment and it was very cute with a great view. Parking was the only problem! That was of course not Katie's fault! :)"
7391003,39101713,2015-07-20,38521028,Jihye,"The apartment was a nice, clean and perfect place to come back to after a crazy day. The place is just as described and a perfect for 2 people. I stayed there with my sister! We had a great experience with airbnb :)

Andreina is very friendly and easy to connect with. The moment we arrived she immediately made us feel comfortable. And she prepared the brochures about Seattle. It was helpful! 

Thanks!!
"
7391003,39252354,2015-07-21,38848465,Maddi,Hosts were very responsive and flexible. Apartment was very clean and all the windows were awesome. Convenient location to downtown and Capitol Hill. 
7391003,39355985,2015-07-22,38925552,Bradley,"We had such a great experience at the studio! Everything was so clean and tidy, as well as ready for our use. The host met us at the studio (she even met us for a late arrival) and gave us a quick tour and answered all of our questions. She had the space prepared with guidebooks, maps, snacks, and extra bathroom supplies! She went above and beyond to help her guests! The space is great for visiting downtown, but is on a quiet, tree-lined street. We walked to a coffee shop and the waterfront within 10 minutes. This is an awesome space and the host is incredible! We are so appreciative, and if the opportunity arises, we will be back!"
7391003,40387453,2015-07-30,21571385,Roland,"Andreina met me as promised when I arrived and showed me around the apartment. It was perfect for my needs for a one-night stay in Seattle, when the hotels were VERY expensive ($400-$700 a night) anywhere near downtown or Capitol Hill. The apartment was quite comfortable, and I would recommend staying there."
7391003,40516608,2015-07-31,4804623,Cindy,"Awesome host, great location and very well kept studio!"

7391003,41133878,2015-08-04,11722242,Gavin,"My girlfriend and I had a great weekend in Seattle. Andreina was a great host, making sure we were completely set up with everything we needed, with no fuss. The location was fantastic and basically like staying in a hotel room. This is pretty much true as the accommodation is part of an old hotel with plenty of character. All that it felt was missing was a reception and staff! The room was kitted out with an airbed, but it was more comfortable than other mattresses I've slept on in the past. All in all I can't rate this property highly enough, especially in terms of location and price compared to the other options available, prior to booking."
7391003,41658017,2015-08-08,38799131,Asia,Adreina was really knowledgeable on all things Seattle. She helped my sister and I figure out the best method of transportation to use. The place was nice and cozy. She was very hospitable and accommodating. 
7391003,41823013,2015-08-09,38800486,Xin,The apartment is in good location. Overall it's a nice apartment. The host is also very nice to talk with.
7391003,42011454,2015-08-10,23455368,Anne,"This was the best place to stay for our trip to Seattle! The apartment is walking distance to downtown, the stadiums, and also to our favorite restaurant in Capitol Hill. It was also a really great deal! I definitely recommend staying here. "
7391003,42904906,2015-08-16,25611687,Madeline,We had an overall positive experience staying at this studio. Host was punctual and nice and the apartment was clean and in a great location. Only downside was we had to sleep on an air mattress and did not find out until we arrived. I believe that should have been disclosed ahead of time.
7391003,43145592,2015-08-17,94888,Maia,"This studio IS in the best location - we were looking for a place between downtown and Capitol Hill and were delighted to find somewhere that was walking distance to both. It DOES feel like a hotel room, which is not really the vibe I'm looking for with Airbnb. The apartment is sparsely furnished and a bit uncomfortable....there are some kitchen accessories with the price tags still on them. The air mattress is fine to sleep on but hard to sit on -- so the only place to sit in the apartment is two wooden chairs. Andreina was GREAT: super fast communication, met us at the apartment exactly when we wanted to, really easy check-in and check-out."
7391003,43523262,2015-08-20,32692988,Adoree,Andreina made check in & check out really easy for us. Everything felt clean & the location was also great. No wifi though so just be prepared for that. 
7391003,44550455,2015-08-27,8287819,Grace,"From start to finish Andreina and Alex were wonderful hosts. Easy to contact and just genuine, nice people. They went above an beyond our expectations and cannot thank them enough for making our stay so enjoyable and memorable! 

The apartment was fantastic! So quirky and in the perfect location to explore the city!  

We would stay again and recommend highly to anyone going to Seattle!

Thank you guys :-) 

Grace & Ben"
7391003,44935927,2015-08-30,17845034,Owen,"This place exceeded our expectations and is more than adequate for two people. Andreina was very nice and quick to respond. Some other reviews mention an air bed, but lucky for us, Andreina changed it to a comfy regular mattress just before our stay. The location couldn't be more convenient and was either walking distance or a short uber/lyft ride to just about everything. Wifi would've been nice, but most of us have data on our phones anyway and the lack of wifi incentivizes you to stay out and about. Overall, couldn't have asked for a better place for me and my girlfriend's first visit to Seattle! "
7391003,45136756,2015-08-31,23949012,Marta,"Although Andreina was kind with us, the apartment was far away to meet our expectations. Our choice was made relying on the pictures of the appartment, but the reality is that unfortunatelly the apartment is worst than it appears in those photos. 
Actually, it is a really old apartment and the smell of the whole building couldn't be worst (it stinked even after using the air freshener that we had to buy!).
The shower pipes were blocked. 
Also, in Airbnb it is stated that the apartment has TV but it turns out that it doesn’t work as a proper TV, the only available option is to watch the few films that Andreina has over there through DVDs through a PSP. 
We are pretty sure that in the event of a city inspection, the building will not pass the minimum requirements (the elevator is totally unsecure and a bit scaring)!
In conclusion, we would preferred to pay more and staying in a comfortable room! We can't reccomend this appartment at all."
7391003,45586847,2015-09-04,37457289,Mike,Located very centrally on the edge of downtown. A minimalist apartment in an almost Scandinavian way.
7391003,46298271,2015-09-09,35099734,Liz,It was great! Happy with Host flexibility and attentiveness. Great location 
7391003,46742037,2015-09-13,39610000,Amar,Andreina was awesome and her apartment was perfect for a weekend trip. She was extremely accommodating with my odd flight times and provided everything I needed for my trip. Would recommend to everyone!
7391003,47273987,2015-09-17,30492364,Danny Jingyu,Welcoming host. Cozy home in a nice location.
7391003,47702235,2015-09-21,39847137,Stephanie,"Staying at Andreina's was my first time through Airbnb and it was great! 

About the host: She was very quick in responding to my messages and accommondating my requests. She asked that I give her a bit of an advanced notice before check-in, but when I got there a little early, she was available to let me in right away. 

During our first night, we only had a thin blanket and being from Southern California, we were definitely not used to the cold so I requested an additional blanket which she dropped one off soon after. 

About the location: Location was very close to all the tourist areas and downtown. We were able to walk to most of the places that we wanted to visit. 

About the home: It was cozy, clean and comfortable. For a place to stay in downtown while out exploring most of the time, it is perfect since there isn't wifi or tv."
7391003,48105899,2015-09-23,42553361,Chi,"The host was great! She replied quickly to all of my messages and inquiries. She even left me an umbrella when I asked for one because I thought it might rain in Seattle (it didn't).

Pros: 
- Awesome host
- It was a convenient location to get to pretty much anywhere: Pike's Place Market, the waterfront, walkable distance to the Space Needle, Chihuly garden, downtown area, and etc. You don't even need a car, honestly, if those were the sites you wanted to visit.
- Studio itself was pretty spacious for 2, clean & comfy.
- There's a kitchen if you needed to save your food in or make coffee/tea.
- THE BED WAS VERY COMFORTABLE. It's on the smaller queen size, but omg, my friend and I loved the bed. haha
- The room itself was, surprisingly, not that cold even though walking through Seattle during the night was kind of chilly. (Note: We stayed during late Sept, so if I'm not sure if the room will still be like that way in say... Jan/Feb). There's a radiator if the room gets cold, but we never used it.

Cons:
- The elevator going up to the room is old and a little bit scary. It isn't like the modern elevators I'm used to. The building is old, too, but again, the  room itself was very nice!
- No wifi :( But we didn't really need the internet anyway.
- There's no cable TV, so you can't watch football games. lol But there are movies you can watch on the PSP.

Overall, my first airbnb experience was great!"
7391003,48894530,2015-09-29,36200289,Alene,"We had a great experience staying here! Andreina was very responsive throughout the process and was flexible to accommodate our schedule. While the building is old, the apartment itself was clean and comfortable. That said, I do I wish there was Wifi available. The location was great - we were able to walk almost everywhere we wanted to go. "
7391003,50091353,2015-10-09,5926719,Randy,"We only stayed a night, but the location is great! Andreina was very accommodating, considering our late arrival from the airport."
7391003,50309430,2015-10-11,42498305,Sirithra,Perfect location. In the middle of everything. A very nice and accommodating host. The building is a little old and you can hear everything. 
7391003,50649184,2015-10-13,17055441,Cathy,"Our initial thought of this place was that it was really small and a little out of our comfort level, but we really just need a place to sleep. Andreina's husband met us in front to give us the key and showed us the property. He was very nice and gave us some suggestions on what to do in Seattle since this was our first time. 

My husband and I spent two nights there and every morning we are awaken by this really loud and annoying bang, contestant bang, like someone purposely smashed  a monkey ranch onto a metal pole outside the window. It made me more tired and lost a few hours to sleep which we could be out and about.

The location was in walking proximity to many restaurants and local attractions including Pike Place Market which is a big plus. The building is very old with one elevator with no ventilation but that's to be expected of a really old building.   

Overall, I would recommend this place if you don't want to stay in hotels, want to be close to local attractions, and just need an inexpensive place to rest for the night. "
7391003,50863302,2015-10-15,13306270,Melissa,Great location and comfy bed :) 
7391003,51446924,2015-10-20,43136072,Michelle,"Andreina was quick & great in responding to any questions I had. Her studio was in a great location, a few blocks away from Pike Place, also walking distance from the train station (if you're coming from the airport). Good price considering most hotels in the area are twice as much. "
7391003,51637755,2015-10-22,43787292,Wafiqah,Great location. The hosts were very friendly and accommodating! Would absolutely recommend this place to anyone visiting Seattle.
7391003,52333864,2015-10-28,28703854,Phillip,"This was a great find for downtown Seattle. It was a 10 minute walk to downtown and Pike Place, and really well priced. However, the amenities the apartment came with obviously dictate how cheap this place really is. There was no heater, cable TV, wifi, or microwave. There was a PS3 with very limited movie options, so we went out and rented movies to watch at night. Also had to bundle up with extra layers as we were here in Fall and it was cold and rainy. Would I stay there again? Yes. What I was looking for was a place to stay for just a few days to see Seattle. Wouldn't spend much time hanging out here, but for a place to sleep it got the job done (and for cheap.) "
7391003,52985191,2015-11-03,39163102,Adwynna,"The studio is in a fantastic location. We were able to walk everywhere.

It is also in a very, very old building. The elevator was broken the entire time we stayed there, which meant we became intimately acquainted with the moldy stairwells. 

Andreina was not able to be there to show us in, not her fault, the airline had canceled her flight.
We were handed keys and told to head up. The radiator really is noisy. The traffic outside really is noisy, so the listing is totally honest about that. The bathtub could use some caulking and a little attention to mildew. Apart from that, the studio apartment was clean and had just enough amenities to have a glass of wine and eat takeout on the two plates. If you're planning to cook any food this isn't your place. Could use a pair of scissors and a vegetable peeler. Only two sharp knives are pretty basic! 

Our host was very responsive to questions and the studio was totally suitable.
If you are with another person and need space to get away from them there is none. You better like your roommate!

Other hosts will let us know what is local for groceries and really good restaurants. That would've been a nice touch!

Take it for the location. Don't have high expectations of luxury and you are going to be very happy.

"
7391003,54141935,2015-11-16,5884642,Karly,It was wonderful! Cory was outside waiting for us and showed us how the elevator worked and there were granola bars and a neat shower! Very nice. I loved staying in the city!
7391003,54512938,2015-11-21,1500430,Kyla,Andreina was responsive and pleasant! The studio description was accurate and she made herself available to answer questions and show the studio in person.
7391003,54858235,2015-11-25,10201171,Evan,"We came down from Vancouver BC for a Seahawks game and for us location was the most important quality in a place. Andreina's place is steps away from the convention centre and about 10-15 minutes from pike place and aprox. 20 minutes from Century Link field. The neighbourhood is nice around the place. The building isn't in the best shape, the decor and walls are quite dated and some damage. Andreina's place was well kept and clean. Very basic inside but has the essentials you need for you stay. Some more cutlery would have been nice. The radiator took about 3 hours to finally turn on, but did eventually work. Overall the room was in good condition and we were happy with our stay. The price is good and the location is prime, just be sure to temper your expectations when you stay here."
7391003,54998899,2015-11-27,729499,Caleb,"Andrea was very accommodating of our short stay and our late check-in time. Communication was quick and concise and we had a wonderful time staying in her beautiful home. The place was clean, comfortable, and the perfect place to stay, right in the middle of downtown Seattle. My wife and I will definitely be back!"
7391003,55562900,2015-12-02,11274470,Mary,"Loved this darling and charming apartment in the heart of Seattle's most happening neighborhood! I grew up in Seattle and this place reminded me of the apartments I once rented when I was young. I will absolutely rent it again on my next trip to Seattle. Andreina was everything you could want in a host--on time, very quick to answer questions, took care of everything we needed. Thanks so much!"
7391003,55647246,2015-12-03,2333554,Danny,Simple and clean studio right in downtown. Meeting up with Andreina was quick and easy and it all worked out exactly as I needed.
7391003,55754872,2015-12-05,50004716,Don,"Nice old building, everything was as described. The bed was comfortable. Communication was good."

7391003,56165224,2015-12-09,8400865,Sasha,"Andreina was a wonderful host. Was in contact with me on my way there, and was there to greet me with the keys and instructions. She was also available via text/phone for questions, and let me have late check-out. The studio was clean and had modern accessories that made it feel cozy and homey."
7391003,56506284,2015-12-14,23858101,Alexandra,"Andreina was a lovely host. She was right there to greet us when we got there and even helped us out the last day that we were there with an issue we had! I came here to celebrate an anniversary and the location couldn't have been better. We were away from the noise but only a 10 min walk to downtown and Capitol Hill. 
The apartment was clean and a good size for two people. 
I would definitely recommend this place for a weekend stay if you're looking to explore Seattle! "
7391003,57101231,2015-12-21,40883241,Danielle,The apartment was located in downtown Seattle close to the freeway. Furniture was basic and kitchen utilities sparse. Everything was clean and nice linen was provided. Host was on time and welcoming.

1831338,14108848,2014-06-11,1386611,Robyn,"Reena was so friendly and accommodating, really lovely woman to be around. The space was great, comfortable and clean. We felt very welcome and at home. Discovery Park is a 5 minute walk too, and it's a quiet and safe area. "
1831338,15070622,2014-07-01,3985309,Andrew,"What a fantastic location in a fantastic neighborhood.  So quite all the time.  I slept so well every night on the perfectly firm futon.  Reena is such a sweet, sweet lady.  She did everything to make me feel at home.  A week into my stay I came home one night to find fresh flowers in my room.  Thanks so much for a wonderful place to call home for a week."
1831338,15287470,2014-07-06,16535215,Hayden,"Reena was very nice and hospitable! It felt much more like staying with a relative than a stranger. She was very patient even though we ended up having to check in way later than anticipated. She gave plenty of recommendations of places to eat and things to see. 

The neighborhood is beautiful and quiet. It was a fifteen minute commute into downtown. The house is five minutes away from Discovery Park and the neighborhood is loaded with amazing lookout points. I would definitely recommend it to anyone who is looking  for a homey place to stay that isn't disturbed by the hustle and bustle of the city."
1831338,15974744,2014-07-19,15385005,Daniel,Reena was very welcoming and made us feel comfortable upon arrival. She lives in a quiet neighbourhood a 30 minute bus ride away from downtown. The room was very clean and looked exactly like it did in the picture. Our first time using air b n b and it was a good experience. 
1831338,16190151,2014-07-22,1104165,Daniel,"Reena is sweet, quirky and very talkative. We only stayed for one night but the room was great. The neighborhood is very safe and calm, and the beautiful Discovery Park is only a couple blocks away. There's a pizzeria with late-night delivery over in Magnolia (a 30 minute walk), next to a sports bar which is also open relatively late. We arrived late and needed both a walk and a bite to eat so we got a drink at the Magnolia bar and had our food delivered there."
1831338,16945014,2014-08-04,18902013,Cecil,"The host was very friendly and engaging and knew the area well suggesting many fine eateries in the neighborhood. The room was exactly as pictured, bright and airy with plenty of free safe street parking. We had a very good time and some wonderful conversations."
1831338,17719092,2014-08-16,19632676,Kara,Thank you Reena for the hospitality.  
1831338,18839814,2014-09-01,169365,Peter,"This is hard to write, Reena seems like a nice person. There were big problems with this booking.
Biggest problem was bugs.  When we got back Saturday night there were lots of bugs in the bedding, on the bed and on the floor. Reena saw the bugs. I had to ask for clean sheets.  Reena said she would spray the room the next day. I don’t know if she did. On Sunday night when we got back we still had bugs and I woke up on Monday morning with two bugs crawling on me.  I don’t think Reena understood bugs are a big deal. If I am paying $150 per night I expect it to be bug free.
We were offered no discount or compensation for the bugs; we were even charged a “cleaning fee.”  
You can hear the voices from the basement room that is rented out – holes in wall where moulding not completed. 
You must have a car to stay here. The bus is far away, 10 blocks up a very steep hill during the evening, its better during the day.
On a positive note, there is good water pressure and lots of hot water in the shower. 
We have stayed in lots of Airbnb places in Seattle and Hawaii as well as been host to hundreds of people over the last 4 years in our home, so we are not newbies with staying in other people’s houses.  
"
1831338,34387131,2015-06-07,30419792,Courtney,"Reena was exceptionally welcoming and stayed up late to welcome us into her home. We made delicious pizza before turning in for the night and she maintained her generosity throughout her stay. The room was lovely and sunny and the rest of the house was clean. The location is amazing if you want to get out of the downtown area, only minutes to the amazing Discovery Park. 

Reena herself is exceptionally open and is eager to interact and connect with her guests (whether that works for you or not). "
1831338,35342570,2015-06-17,35339279,Ge,"nice place, and Reena is awesome !"
1831338,38087516,2015-07-12,38104582,Bryan,"Reena was exceedingly generous and welcoming.  She made me feel like I was coming home to see an old relative.  The room is exactly as the picture displays, and the bathroom is more than adequate.  The local neighborhood is quiet and scenic."
1831338,38684387,2015-07-17,38692740,Nardia,"Reena's a wonderful host. The room was comfortable and clean. My husband and I had a peaceful night's rest. We went on a relaxing walk with Reena, views of Mount Rainier and the bay. Tried home grown veggies - great tastes. Overall fantastic experience. "
1831338,38806786,2015-07-18,19533159,Erin,"Reena is a very kind person. However, that being said, I did have some issues during my stay with her that I felt compromised my personal safety and the safety of my belongings. Upon my arrival Reena informed me that she did not have a key for me, which can be problematic when you're a guest in someone's house for obvious reasons. She said that the neighborhood was safe and that it was okay to leave the doors unlocked, which isn't exactly solution that made much sense to me. She also said it was likely the last people who stayed with her (the night before) took the key with them because they liked the way it looked. When I asked if she would call the previous guests to see if they had the key, and/or try to retrieve it, she said no because she didn't want to blame them for anything. This made me very uncomfortable. As a woman, traveling alone, I wanted to feel safe in the house where I was staying. Knowing that strangers who very possibly could still be in the area had a key to the house made me feel unsafe. I also didn't feel comfortable leaving my belongings in an unlocked house. Reena eventually made me an extra key that evening, but it didn't make me feel any more safe knowing the other key was still somewhere out there, and at that point the key was of no use to me since it was late and I had no plans to leave the house that night. The next morning I left at 5 AM, sleepless, and with a bad taste in my mouth form the whole experience. I felt like it was more important to her to get the $100 for the room than to take a few hours to change the locks/look into the issue of the missing key. I especially felt more like a dollar sign than a person when I asked for a partial refund through AirB&B and Reena declined to give it to me. A partial refund would have been fair, and the right thing to do, in my opinion. I'm sorry to say that although Reena is a nice person, due to the issues described above the overall experience wasn't great, and certainly wasn't worth $100."
1831338,39684783,2015-07-25,16630203,Kerry,"Reena was exceedingly kind. The bed was comfortable. The neighborhood was quiet and safe. There was an unmade mattress in the living room and no way to secure our things, so unknown guests was a concern that affected our view of the value. Her conversation and sharing were appreciated. "
1831338,39844274,2015-07-26,21987888,Lesley,"Reena is a wonderfully warm person, she greeted us at the door with a big hug and a warm smile. The house is very nice, clean and tidy, with a nice little garden plot out front. It was very easy to find, one bus from downtown. The neighbourhood is beautiful, lots of big old houses, gorgeous gardens and great views of the water. It is a bit far from downtown but we were only there one night so it was OK by us. If staying longer, then get a day pass on the transit system, I think it would be worth it."
1831338,40287311,2015-07-29,16472458,Ayobami,"Reena was a great host. She was extremely welcoming upon first arrival, greeting me with a big hug and a great conversation. I was not able to take her up on her offer for a tour of Discovery Park, but should I be in the area again I would definitely go! I suggest Reena's place for anyone looking for a nice, quaint stay in Seattle.  "

429453,1173942,2012-04-23,17005,Jason,"We really enjoyed our stay at Cam's. The house is incredibly sunny and in a beautiful neighbourhood--- think lush gardens and friendly neighbours...
Although we never got to meet Cam as he was away his room mate filled us in. The porch attached to the bedroom you stay in is a lovely spot for a drink if the weather is sunny. Parking is available on the street. The only thing we did not get was internet access. It was probably on the itinerary but we relied on our Iphone instead of printing all the info out. Nevertheless, this is a great jumping of point if you want to visit Ballard or Fremont on foot."
429453,1227418,2012-05-04,1936096,Willie,"I stayed with Cam for close to 6 weeks while I was in the process of moving to Seattle. This was the best choice I could have made. Not only did I get to stay in a beautiful house with a gorgeous view of my new city, but I made a good friend in Cam. When you stay here, you have walking access to Gas Works Park, which I think is a must-see and all of the restaurants and stores in Fremont right down the street. Don't forget the Fremont Troll. 

The house itself is large, airy, and puts out a very positive vibe that made me feel right at home. I was glad to see the more chill side out Seattle in comparison to downtown, even though you're only a very short bus ride from the city center. Bonus, you'll get to meet Stella the dog, who is pretty awesome. 

Even though I have my own place now, I still miss this place. Highly recommended. "
429453,1332452,2012-05-22,2385626,Steven,"What a delightful experience! Cam was out of town during my visit but he made arriving and staying in his home so simple and straight forward.  I was fortunate to be greeted by another house guest, Vivian, who made me feel quite at home. The house has been remodeled leaving it open and bright.  It was very clean and stylish (check out the photos). The bathroom was clean and I loved the overhead shower in the stand alone stall.  My bedroom was the best, with a very comfortable bed and down comforter.  I also had a beautiful walk-out balcony to sit and enjoy my coffee. I would give Cam's place my highest recommendation and I look forward to the opportunity to be his guest again.   Thanks Cam"
429453,1390014,2012-05-31,1538642,Mark,"Cam's house is extraordinary! A beautiful house in a perfect neighborhood. We especially liked the gorgeous trees outside our sunny deck! The dog Stella was very noisy at first, but actually calms down quite quickly when she hears a familiar voice. We hope to stay for a longer visit next time!"
429453,1524229,2012-06-20,2401837,Sachin,"No doubt one of the best experiences in our many travels to Seattle. Cam is a very hospitable host, laid back and very helpful. His home is exactly as advertised: sunny and very soothing. Great place to just relax and read a book or something and take a stroll around a beautiful neighborhood and close to Fremont as well. We truly appreciated our experience and would go back in a heartbeat."
429453,1719440,2012-07-16,459721,Noah,"Cam's place is fantastic! This is a charming house in a charming neighborhood close to Fremont, the 45th Street shops in Wallingford and Gas Works park, all of which I thoroughly enjoyed. But not nearly as much as his affectionate dog, and the super-comfortable bed! The place wan't clean - it was immaculate, but not so antiseptic that I felt uncomfortable just hanging out in my down time. "
429453,1790384,2012-07-24,1538642,Mark,another great visit
429453,3719948,2013-03-08,4243945,Catherine,"I couldn't imagine having picked a better place to stay during my time in Seattle. I stayed at Cam's for 8 weeks while I was doing a research internship at UW. First, the house is beautiful, comfortable and well located (easy walk to coffee shops, restaurants, grocery stores or beautiful Gas Works Park, easy commute to UW). I really enjoyed my room and its great view, the spacious living room and the kitchen where I could find everything I needed to cook anything I wanted to. 

Most importantly, this place is the home of two charming individuals, Cam (great host) and Stella (very sweet dog). Cam was a very thoughtful and welcoming host, even when away on business trips. He knows everything about Seattle's best, from Bikram yoga studios, museums, parks and music venues to dive bars, restaurants, happy hours and radio shows. He is also the best source of 'Seattle facts', which was awesome for someone like me who was new to the city. He was central to the way I got to love Seattle.

I had a wonderful time at Cam's place, it went by too quickly. I would not want to stay anywhere else for my future visits in Seattle. "
429453,4148125,2013-04-14,5332553,Jessica,"I stayed with Cam for five weeks while I was working from my company's office in Seattle. I really appreciated having Cam's house as a base for my Seattle adventure - not only is it clean and welcoming with all of the amenities anyone could want, but it's also super beautiful home in a great neighborhood. It was also easy to get to other neighborhoods using public transportation. My office is downtown, and it only took 20-30 minutes to get there from Cam's house. 

Cam was really friendly and helpful, and was flexible when I had an unexpected guest and when I had to add an extra night onto my stay. Plus he's fun to chat with!

I would definitely recommend Cam's house to anyone who wants an authentic Seattle experience. 

p.s. Even if you're not a dog person, his dog Stella is the best!"
429453,8474377,2013-11-01,1936096,Willie,Cam's is the best! I love this place...this is my second home and I can't recommend it enough :)
429453,31012029,2015-04-30,5279651,Melissa,Cam's house is incredible and he was an equally incredible host.  The decor is inspiring and the whole place felt like home.  Everything was very clean and there was anything you might need available for use.  He's responsive and has a great info website with directions and help for anything that might come up.  Wallingford is an adorable and quaint neighborhood - a lot to do and still quiet and relaxing.  I loved the porch balconies and the inviting claw foot bathtub.  I can't say enough good things about this place.  I'll definitely be back to stay when I visit.  Thanks Cam for making my last week in Seattle so comfortable.  Cheers!!!
429453,32089406,2015-05-13,4124592,Katie,"Loved staying at Cam's sweet house! It has a calm feel, and everything is crisp and clean, quite as you see in the photos. The bathrooms are really lovely, especially the claw foot tub mmm. The bed was so comfy and with lots of pillows. For us, it was easy to park, use washer and dryer, use the kitchen, Netflix, basically chill out for a bit. It was very easy to do the reservation, check in, and keep in touch with Cam if needed. . .I would have stayed longer if I could! 

We only saw Cam briefly, and he was quite gracious and made us feel very comfortable. Overall, this is a very easy to use house, a lovely experience for me visiting Seattle for the first time. . .lots of reading material on the city and in general. Thanks Cam!"
429453,34322432,2015-06-07,31975967,Peter,"Cam's house was fantastic, quiet and a great place to rest for a long week in Seattle.  Wallingford is the best neighborhood around, too!"
429453,54592345,2015-11-22,44660742,Christine,I highly recommend this place.  This was my first time doing an Airbnb and Cam made it so easy with a very detailed house guide so you know how to use things in the house.  The guide also included places to eat/things to do in the neighborhood and in Seattle.  The house is amazing! The pictures are spot on.  Waking up every morning was a treat with the beautiful orange and yellow colors of the tree outside the window and going on the balcony with a cup of coffee and a view of the city.  Cam is a nice and welcoming guy and he responds quickly to any question you have.  Stella is so cute and friendly!  Parking was easy to find and is very close to the house.  The town is beautiful and very safe.  Everything is within walking distance and the bus is easy to take too.  Pike place market is a short bus ride and is a lot cheaper than driving.  I stayed here for a month and I can't think of anything negative about the place or my experience.  I would definitely book this place again! 
11012,25147,2010-01-31,16613,Kathy,I really enjoyed my stay in Joyce's home! It's a lovely home in a great neighborhood. There a nice balance between hospitality and personal privacy. It was quite comfortable and much more personable than a hotel. I would definitely stay there again in the future!
11012,302865,2011-06-07,613780,Holly,We really enjoyed our stay in Seattle.  Our host Joyce was most helpful in providing ideas and directions in the city.  Her home is conveniently located and we enjoyed our dinners on the patio/backyard.  
11012,469793,2011-08-23,897546,Aki,Our stay at the Orange House was comfortable. Nicely decorated house good for family stay with wonderful location to everywhere. We enjoyed breakfast and dinner at the back yard where there are many flowers and trees.  We like to come back for the next stay. Aki
11012,502364,2011-09-05,880135,Guang Ming,"The Orange House is in a great neighborhood and is convenient to so many of Seattle's attractions. Joyce was a great host - she gave us tips on area eateries and things to do, and also brought us a box of toys for the kids.  On our last morning she enhanced our breakfast with a bowl of blackberries she picked.

Though there is no parking spot, we had zero problems with street parking - a spot was always available right in front of the house no matter the time of day.

An FYI for parents: We stayed with our children (age 3 and age 17 months) and they are pretty mellow, but if you have kids who are into everything, Joyce has a lot of knick-knacks and bureaus full of things that may prove very tempting to little ones. The dining room table is also a high gathering table, so the kids had picnics on towels on the floor for meals - which they highly enjoyed.

We would stay at the Orange House again!
"
11012,749691,2011-11-28,1312247,Patricia,"The Orange House provided a great gathering place for my family's Thanksgiving celebration!  A well equiped kitchen, laundry & plenty of space for out ""feasting"" and family gathering.

Great location for walking about in Wallingford area!"
11012,1455419,2012-06-11,2139493,Colin,"It's hard for me to overstate how much the Orange House improved our visit to Seattle. My wife and I were graduating and also putting up 3 family members and the house easily accommodated everyone between the 3 bedrooms in the main part of the house. If we had anyone else, there were more than enough inflatable/foam mattresses and even an extra cottage (which you have to rent in advance) that has one extra bed.

The location was perfect about 5 blocks south of ""downtown"" Wallingford including Molly Moon's ice cream, the QFC grocery store and Bottleworks—arguably the best beer store in Seattle. It's also about 7 blocks north of Gasworks Park right on Lake Union where you can bask in the fully beauty of Seattle with grass, trees, water and a view of the space needle. Also, Essential Baking has great bread and pastries.

The house itself is gorgeous inside and out. The gardens will make you envious of Joyce's gardening skill and eye for how to lay out statues, stonework and art perfectly in with her plants. The art that decorates her walls is perfectly Seattle and the whole place feels lived-in, but clean and tidy. It's like the best version of you—intellectual, artistic and attentive to detail—kept a whole house in good, clean shape all of the time.

Joyce is amazing, friendly and has lots of tips about what to do around the house. She even went well above and beyond the call of duty by insisting that we come back to take a nap after checkout time. The extra few hours of rest before our flight on the last day make an good trip amazing."
11012,1768238,2012-07-22,802930,Catherine,"My family of 5 adults stayed at the Orange House for 3 nights.  It was great!  The house was absolutely charming - and very comfortable too.  

The location was convenient  to downtown and to the interesting Seattle neighborhoods.  We used the car some, but also took buses which were frequent and easy.

Joyce was a welcoming host.  She offered advice on restaurants, events, walks.  I locked myself out  -- and she immediately and graciously rescued me.   We had a very early airport departure.  She generously vacated her rear parking space so we could have a speedy get away.  

If you want a peaceful, charming retreat in Seattle, this is your house."
11012,1814487,2012-07-27,173011,Deepika,"Joyce made our stay very comfortable. She was very responsive, helpful and extremely caring. The house is very neat, extremely welcoming and close to major highways. I definitely will recommend staying at the orange house if you are in Seattle. "
11012,1967494,2012-08-13,2558507,Rose,"The house was in a great location and walking distance to grocery  store and restaurants with an easy drive to Seattle. 

It was quite obvious that the home was more someones resident and not a rental.  It made us fill uncomfortable that we were in her home while she was out in the cottage in the backyard.  Too many personal effects, clutter.  Bedrooms, bedding older and used.

I would reccomend  only if you planned on being gone most of the time and only needed some place to  sleep and shower."
11012,2013611,2012-08-17,1726209,Thorsten,We had a great time at Joyce's fantastic orange house in Seattle. Would go back any time.
11012,2207084,2012-09-05,249186,Laila,"I had a wonderful stay in the Orange House over the Labour Day long weekend while we went to Bumbershoot.  The location was fantastic - a close walk to the grocery store, and two bus routes, which took us directly to Seattle Center.
The house was just as pictured.  Clean and well equipped, and beautifully decorated.  We used all three bedrooms and the air mattress in the living room, and everyone was comfortable.  My husband and I were lucky enough to have the top suite, which was such a treat!
The hot tub and yard were a huge bonus!  We enjoyed a couple breakfasts in the sunny front patio.
Our only complaint, which was nothing to do with the house, or Joyce, was the barking dogs across the street, which woke us up for an hour or so each early morning.
We would definitely rent this house again, and absolutely recommend it to other travellers."
11012,3508725,2013-02-10,1211723,Christy,"We just returned from a wonderful week-long stay in The Orange House. Joyce was there to greet us when we arrived, and made us feel right at-home. I have a seven-month-old daughter, and Joyce e-mailed me before our arrival offering a portable crib and sheets which I gladly accepted! The less we had to bring on the airplane, the better. We found the knick-knacks around the house charming and fun. The wood burning fireplace was also a plus - we sat around the fire, glass of wine in-hand each evening before bed. Beds were comfy, and kitchen is very well stocked! I highly recommend this house to anyone needing a comfortable and quiet place to stay. We found Wallingford to be a great location - central to everything (downtown Seattle and East side attractions) with wonderful shops and restaurants within walking distance. A safe and charming neighborhood!"
11012,5097764,2013-06-12,5467339,Maria,"We had a wonderful time in this beautiful home for our Uncles 80th Birthday Party.  The front steps made for a beautiful Family Picture  (Joyce, we will be sending you that picture soon) and the well stocked kitchen provided the tools I needed to cook and extensive Cuban Spread and leave Joyce some treats.  We missed our dog so having Cleopatra (Joyce's dog) around brought us much Joy.  Joyce was very helpful with anything we needed...and gave us a great contact to Bedrock Glass...an awesome glass recycling place bought some great tiles now installed in my bathroom which I was in the process of remodeling when I visited.  The house is beautiful, near great restaurants and shops, and the view from the master bedroom is priceless,  We enjoyed our stay very much."
11012,5860042,2013-07-20,5536377,Wendi,"My girlfriends and I had a wonderful stay in Joyce's home. We had the main house and this down stairs apartment. Everyone enjoyed the lovely garden, neighborhood and of course the classic turn of the 
century home. 
Joyce was helpful and welcoming. She made us feel right at home. "
11012,6067066,2013-07-29,1755632,Ellis,"We had a great time at the Orange House. It is in a lovely central part of Seattle in walking distance of Gasworks Park, Wallingford Playfield, the Fremont Troll, and lots of wonderful shops and restaurants. Joyce had guests in the cottage in back of the house who we thoroughly enjoyed meeting. It was like staying at a quaint b and b without the b. "
11012,7032648,2013-09-04,4010983,Jeremy,"Myself and 7 other friends stayed in the orange house over Labor Day weekend, while attending a gaming convention. We had a fantastic time - the house is spacious enough that we were able to get all 8 people accommodated without issue. There are several bus options nearby for getting into town, as well as a supermarket and commercial district with some bars and restaurants. Joyce was very hospitable and gave us tips for local destinations. The house looked just like it was portrayed online, and there were plenty of extra pillows and sheets for all the guests. 

That being said, I would hesitate to recommend this to groups that might be a bit rowdy, or stay up late. We received two warnings about our noise levels while we were in the house: once when we were up playing board games until midnight, and the second when we had come home from bars late. As noted in the house rules, the basement and cottage (both on the same property) are separate from the house, so you may be in close quarters with others who may not have the same late hours. 

All in all, we enjoyed our stay and Joyce has a beautiful, classic home - but for our group, personally, we will probably look for a home with more relaxed noise and late night rules when booking next year."
11012,9050997,2013-12-03,8705713,Kathleen,"The orange house is as listed... centrally located for ease of travel, in a sweet and quiet residential neighborhood. We traveled to Seattle to visit our son who just moved there for his job. It turns out, we hosted Thanksgiving dinner for him and friends who were also new to the Seattle community. It was wonderful to have a fully and well equipped kitchen to prepare our feast. The upstairs master bedroom is spacious and soothing. On the ground level are two bedrooms with quite comfortable beds. There are a variety of sitting areas throughout the home, with artistically eclectic decor that was a delight. There are books everywhere! I loved being able to look at some of them to gather titles that are going on my ""want to read"" list. There is a small apartment below ground level which also rents out, and a cute little cottage in the back yard that rents as well. I've already recommended the Orange House to friends in Central Wisconsin who may be visiting Seattle in Spring of 2014. I like that there are three different types of rentals, all owned by the same person who is a wonderfully kind and generous host. "
11012,12298890,2014-04-28,2393940,Daniel,"This house is just beautiful. The light coming through the windows, the layout, the landscaping, all gorgeous. I stayed there with my family for my brother's wedding and everything was perfect. We were 6 total, four adults and two kids. Plenty of space. Joyce was always accomodating, communicative and helpful. I would stay at the the orange house again in a heartbeat. "
11012,14026670,2014-06-10,13065995,Anna Louise Shalin,"The orange house was perfect for our family gathering. The house was great and the location was perfect. The garden was lovely. 
We walked down to Gas Works Park and then later up to Wallingford for ice cream. Location was outstanding. 
Joyce was very accommodating and she couldn't have been more helpful. I would go back in a heartbeat. Consider yourself lucky if you are able to spend some time in the orange house.

I could not give it a higher recombination. 5 stars out of 5 "
11012,14386154,2014-06-18,11613579,Mark,"We stayed in Joyce Garrity's Orange House for five days during a typically wet Seattle June. What a cozy, wonderful place, full of books, comfortable beds, books, a well appointed kitchen, books, direct TV (five adults watched the Game of Thrones finale in the lovely window and skylight lit upstairs bedroom suite, while the two kids slept downstairs in one of the bedrooms), views of the Space Needle and lots of books. 

We had a sit down dinner for nine, chicken roasted over root vegetables cooked in the gas oven. What a great place. I would return in a heartbeat - if we need a place to stay in Seattle with room for the whole family this will be where we go. Great location for getting around Seattle, close to the U district, Capitol Hill, Queen Anne, Fremont (don't forget to visit the Troll)."
11012,14743188,2014-06-25,15644126,Peggy,"Lovely...just perfect for a family gathering. We 3 sisters and our hubbies plus my 90-year-old mom attended a wedding and were in Seattle for 5 nights. This house is just our home-away-from-home. Joyce had everything, and more, we needed in the house. The multiple living/sitting areas are perfect for us to relax/gather/chat after a long day's activities. The convenient location, the charming neighborhood are all ++. Met with Joyce. She's warm, courteous and thorough, definitely made us feeling welcomed like a long-time-no-see family member. This house will be our #1 choice at our next family gathering."
11012,14911274,2014-06-29,14922149,Bob,"Joyce was wonderful, she went out of her way to make us feel at home in her home. Thank you Joyce for a wonderful stay and would recommend to anyone. "
11012,16058362,2014-07-21,13778787,Trish,"We had a wonderful stay at the Orange House.  It is located in the very charming Seattle neighborhood of Wallingford.  Just a very short walk from The Dern Good Grocery store for smaller grocery items, and five short blocks to great shopping, good eateries, and a larger grocery store.  Loved walking through this very quaint neighborhood, and hated to leave at the 
end of our stay!  Joyce was a lovely host and made us feel very welcome.  While we unfortunately did not get to meet her in person,she communicated with us by phone and text as needed for instructions and to answer any questions we had.  The house accommodated us perfectly.  We
happened to spend a very unseasonably hot week in Seattle, so we had to use the fans that Joyce had available in each bedroom, but the evenings cooled off beautifully and made for comfortable sleeping temperatures.  The beds were comfy with very nice bedding,  showers were nice,
and Joyce even left us a bottle of wine to enjoy, which we unfortunately never got to  because we were out so much.  The view from the master bedroom balcony of the Seattle skyline is stunning, so be sure to check it out first thing in the morning and at night!"
11012,16712546,2014-08-01,4062309,Lidia,"Joyce's house was an excellent place for our group to stay while in Seattle for two weeks. My colleagues and I were taking a course at UW; we stayed in Joyce's home and walked to the campus every day since she lives near the bike/walking path. We gave ourselves about 45 minutes in the morning to get from the house to the campus, with a stop at Irwin's on the way for coffee. Wallingford is a great town, with plenty to do and access just a few blocks away. 

Joyce was a very gracious host, leaving us wine and emergency beers and treats. She seemed to be accessible while we were there - we didn't need much, but we checked in on a few things here and there during our stay and she was prompt with her replies.

The only slight quirks (and I wouldn't say negative, just things about living in a place) are that there are no screens on the windows upstairs. I think this is a common Seattle thing, but I definitely had some bug bites and heard mosquitos at night. (I wouldn't let that stop me from staying there, I would just be more diligent in the humidity as a person who is always eaten alive by bugs.) The trade-off is that the upstairs room is amazing, and you can see the Space Needle, and Rainier on a clear day. And if it's warm enough in Seattle to open windows, you should do it.

The other folks stayed in the downstairs rooms and they loved the place, with the only feedback that you can sometimes hear the people staying in the basement rental below. Pretty minor stuff. 

One thing you don't see in the description is her incredible book collection! I wish I had more time to just hang out there and read, because Joyce has killer taste in books. Also the pre-loaded iPod has great music choices. So many small touches that made our stay great.

For staying in a place for two weeks, it was so nice to be able to have everything you could need there for you. Thank you!"
11012,16883636,2014-08-04,409979,Niki,"My friends and I stayed at the orange house when we were in Seattle for a wedding. We all know the city pretty well but needed a ""home base"" for events in Phinney Ridge, Wallingford, and downtown Seattle. The orange house was perfect. Street parking is ample and it's super easy to get a Lyft or Uber anywhere you need to go. And there are great coffee shops, bars, restaurants, etc within easy walking distance. The house itself is adorable, with lots of character and a wonderful cross-breeze when all the windows are open. The garden is darling but shared with other guests in the cottage. The upstairs is BIGGER than in the photos and there's a fantastic view of the Space Needle. Very comfortable beds, modern fixtures, and easy-to-use instructions about the house, etc. Highly recommended!
"
11012,17334871,2014-08-11,4986762,Kevin,"Thank you for a wonderful stay Joyce! The house was perfect, the location incredible, and your hospitality was terrific. 

The group arrived over the course of the day, and Joyce made sure everything was just right for a stress free arrival. We had a large group and she went above and beyond to make sure everyone had comfortable sleeping arrangements, and plenty of essentials. The house was in beautiful shape, and there was plenty of room for everyone.

Thanks again Joyce. I will recommend your place to all of my friends who come to visit."
11012,17662745,2014-08-15,19841774,Rupali,"We had a great time.  The house reminded me of my house in Stamford.  Only thing was there was dog poop smell at the entrance.
Thanks"
11012,17826690,2014-08-18,15972130,Francesca,"The Orange House is a welcoming solution for those tourists looking for a familiar atmosphere even when on holiday. The house is big, clean and comfortable, with plenty of books, cds, painting and photos scattered throughout the house, making the rooms very charming. Wonderful view on the skyline from the upstairs room. At guests' disposal some city guides and lots of eating out suggestions. The house is situated in a lovely residential neighborhood, with lots of eating out facilities in the surroundings and roughly 40 minutes far from downtown."
11012,18207770,2014-08-23,19307698,Jeremy,"Joyce was very welcoming and her home was perfect! Everything was clean and the house was well supplied with everything we could ask for. The home itself is very comfortable for three people, with two large bedrooms and one beautiful master suite. Also, there is a great selection of music and a wonderful stereo available. We would definitely go back!"
11012,18416146,2014-08-26,17527730,Sherry,"THE URBAN COTTAGE

My 3 adult children, 2 grand children, and I traveled to Seattle to celebrate the marriage of my my oldest son with his bride’s family.  Because we had a 5 month old baby with us it seemed so much easier to have a home rather than hotel rooms for our accommodations.  Oh, how right we were!  This home fit all of our expectations.  Joyce is a wonderful host and made us feel right at home.  She provided all our needs (including a port-a-crib for the baby).  She called us the first evening we arrived to be sure we had found any supplies we needed.

       The cottage had a lovely front patio area where we had morning coffee and looked out across the water to the Space Needle and the gleaming downtown from our hilltop view.  We were able to slow down and visit and even had some visits from friends.

Our beds were comfortable and we slept wonderfully.  The upstairs master suite was perfect for my son’s family with the baby.  They kept expecting Peter Pan to come flying in for a visit through the French doors!

We would all come back for a visit again on our next trip to Seattle."
11012,18869569,2014-09-02,11276784,Lise,We thoroughly enjoyed our stay.  The location was great - the house was perfect for the six of us.
11012,19211105,2014-09-08,18656136,Stephanie,"House was in a great location. Joyce was very easy to work with. ""Check in"" and ""check out was a piece of cake. She had clear instructions in the house. Kitchen had all the supplies we needed plus spices and other necessities that came in handy. Beds were extremely comfortable and everything was laid out for us. Would rent from her again. "
11012,19690799,2014-09-16,1570935,Monica,"The Orange House is quite beautiful, with lots of nooks and crannies throughout and an overall comfortable feel. Everything is well-equipped, beds are comfortable, and outdoor space is beautiful and relaxing. Joyce was very welcoming and stayed in communication as needed without being overbearing. Because of the proximity of the space to both neighbors and other guests, there are lots of rules about being quiet that are perfectly understandable. So the best fit for this listing would be light-footed, early-to-bed types who need a comfortable space. "
11012,20119129,2014-09-23,21300737,Donna,"This was our first experience with Airbnb and it definitely made me a fan.  The Orange House is spacious, comfy and well supplied with everything a visitor could need, and then some.  It is indeed quiet and central.  Joyce met us there when we arrived and showed us everything, graciously inviting us to share her many books, her music, the kitchen, hot tub, etc.  She left us a freshly baked loaf of bread. Two of my sons and I were visiting my other son who lives nearby, so we didn't actually take advantage of all the house has to offer.  We were up and out in the morning and came back just to sleep...and the beds were comfortable.  I would recommend the Orange House to other visitors, with the one caution that you note Joyce's bio which states that she is a dog lover (which means, dog owner).  Those with dog allergies should be aware."
11012,31915667,2015-05-11,28034432,Lumeng,地理位置优越，离市中心15分钟路程；床铺很舒服，屋内设施很齐全，看的出主人很有心思；6+1儿童虽然有点紧凑但也过得去，适合对狗不过敏的旅客。

11012,36372574,2015-06-28,30015757,Julie,"Book your trip to Seattle and pray for rain!!  
Joyce's house is so comfortable, the views so lovely and the books so abundant that you won't want to leave!  But if you do venture out, you'll find the location is great: one street away from a bus stop, and short walks to lots of great restaurants, parks and stores (including grocery and pharmacy).
Thank you, Joyce, for opening your home to us, it was a great part of our trip to Seattle!"
11012,37301331,2015-07-06,8962972,Lisa,"Everything about this house is perfect.  Comfortable beds, plenty of towels, a kitchen that has everything (including a welcome basket of bread, fruit and wine) ... and the books!  Joyce has fantastic taste in books.  

I have stayed in many Airbnbs and this one is my favorite."
11012,38663977,2015-07-17,6167079,Bonnie,"Fabulous house, great location, lovely furnishings and touches."
11012,40711841,2015-08-02,28371982,Talia,"As soon as we pulled up to the orange house we knew we made the right decision.  Joyce’s home is lovely, comfortable and full of charm.  The collection of books cannot be beat and Joyce herself is a wealth of information. We enjoyed walking around the Wallingford neighborhood as well as into Fremont.  Joyce also told us to check out Gas Works Park on Tuesday evening, and it was one of the best things we did while in Seattle.   The location is fantastic whether you choose to drive or take the bus.  In addition to the comfort inside the house, the outside space is also an added bonus.  Sitting on the front porch in the evening was a fantastic way to relax and end the day.  Open up the balcony doors and enjoy the sunset and a great view of the city.  We honestly could not have been happier with our experience.  This was a wonderful home away from home!"
11012,41752002,2015-08-09,20677014,Paige,"Joyce's home was the perfect place for my family to relax and enjoy Seattle (despite the fact that they were helping me move during their stay)! The place is lovely, decorated beautifully, and looks just like the pictures. It was a very comfortable stay, and while I personally did not meet Joyce, my family noted that she was very friendly and helpful!"
11012,42291648,2015-08-12,35544945,Yu,Her house was good but a little crowed. Good location 
11012,43028911,2015-08-17,31542887,Suzanne,"Perfect venue!  The home was cozy, charming with great location.  We had everything we needed and available to us.  Great neighborhood, plenty of parking. The outdoor garden and living space was a wonderful setting. Comfy beds, great views of Seattle and Space Needle.  Host left easy to follow instructions and notes in the house.  Would recommend and stay again. "
11012,44293829,2015-08-25,30490178,Rick,"Joyce 's home made our trip to Seattle a special and wonderful experience. It is a beautiful and cozy oasis in a very busy city. The location is great. We highly recommend it, and miss it already."

11012,55210416,2015-11-29,8291169,Caroline,"Joyce’s house was perfect for what our big family needed.  The house was stocked with everything we could possibly need, from toilet paper to a turkey roaster.  Joyce was extremely accommodating and available if we had any questions.  The house was very clean, the beds were very comfortable, and Joyce generously left us some yummy treats! The location was perfect – you could pretty much walk anywhere you needed to.  It was just a 2 block walk to the Wallingford Playground which was a hit with our 3 year old family member! It’s an old house with hardwood floors, which makes it full of character and very beautiful, but noise does carry quite a bit. We were a little worried about disrupting Joyce as she was staying in the downstairs suite, but she was graciously tolerant of what we can imagine was quite a bit of noise (with 6 adults, a toddler, a dog and a few visitors). We would highly recommend Joyce’s house as a great place to stay in Seattle. "
8571518,52283615,2015-10-27,40516862,Shiyi,"The experience was really great. 
Lihi was a helpful and reachable host. The place was clean, organized and warm. The view was really nice. From the windows and the rooftop, the whole downtown Seattle could be seen. "
8571518,52537480,2015-10-30,23196381,Paul,Lihi's apartment is amazing! Watching the views of downtown and West Seattle as a rainstorm passed through was memorizing.  The building is close to Seattle Center and lots of great restaurants. Lihi was great to work with and was quick to respond to my requests for help. I hope to stay there again soon!
8571518,53541560,2015-11-09,10072215,Veronica,"A perfect place to stay in Seattle! I was totally impressed, everything was as the listing explained and the view was stunning. She was available to answer questions right away and the check in was super easy. We loved our stay there and would recommend to anyone looking for a cool place to stay in Belltown. Thanks Lihi!"

Although I didn't get to meet him, checking in was a breeze and the space was clean and orderly. My husband and I loved the location and beautiful view. The interior was very calming and we appreciated the snarky spelling/grammar poster! The location was convenient--only a couple minutes from downtown Seattle via car. We enjoyed a very comfortable stay and would definitely recommend staying here!"
3418230,16307969,2014-07-25,16239321,Rogier,"Great stay, great view from the porch, great care from our host!"
3418230,18020323,2014-08-20,6152264,Arjan,"As Kyle and Nicole were out of town we were able to rent their living space. Communication with Kyle is perfect. He is very responsive and helpful. We stayed their with our two teenage kids who slept on the two coach sofas in the living room. Not super big but the house is very cosy, well equipped,  great porch, super place to stay . The location is great: easy to access whether you are traveling by car of by public transport. Lively street Broadway on walking distance with good restaurants. The view from the porch is stunning over Lake Union and down town (especially at night). Only wish I could have is that the city of Seattle moves the I5 outside the city for lowering car noise. "
3418230,18893743,2014-09-02,19142727,Maura,"My friend and I had a wonderful stay in this cozy place nestled in the trees! It really is an oasis.  The views are stunning, and the place was very comfortable and clean.  Kyle was very responsive and helpful.  I would love to stay there again someday! "
3418230,22722405,2014-11-12,6401453,Kristine,"Wow, the photos do not do this house justice. It is absolutely stunning, a dream home, with views of the water and sky needle from the lounge and dining room, a beautiful kitchen and breakfast nook, and wonderful lush gardens on the steep hill all around. There were 6 of us, and we had plenty of room, with living space to spare. 

We had the whole house to ourselves, and loved the space so much that we found it difficult to leave to see Seattle proper! The sunsets over the city skyline from the garden just outside, and the restaurants and dining of the nearby Broadway were also a highlight.

Kyle was friendly and incredibly accommodating, and we would highly highly recommend this listing for anyone who wants to have a beautiful and luxurious stay away from home. "
3418230,33829884,2015-06-01,25178205,Eric,"The place is comfortable and spacious, located in a nice area in Capitol Hill. The view from the balcony is incredible. Kyle and his family were out of town during my stay, yet he was always prompt when I needed assistance via text. I would stay again on my next trip to Seattle."
3418230,35099269,2015-06-15,25327634,Jeremy,"Had a wonderful time in Kyle's upper unit. Located close to multiple routes on public transportation, we were able to see everything you would want to see efficiently. Kyle was a joy to communicate with and was very generous in allowing us to drop off our luggage far before the check in time, and even allow us to store our stuff there the last day prior to flying back home. Lastly, the unit itself was fantastic, with a beautiful backyard and amazing view from the front porch which is perfect for some early breakfast tea and relaxation with a view! Would definitely stay again with no reservations!"
3418230,37327518,2015-07-06,3868989,Claire,"Communications are always thorough and friendly. His home is clean, spacious, eco/sustainability focused and was a great fit for our family. The location in trendy Capitol Hill is close to everything - we explored Fremont, Pike Street Market and caught a ferry to Bainbridge Island easily despite Seattle's growing traffic woes. My kiddo enjoyed playing with the toys in the living room, and I felt she was safe in his  kid-proof home. The BBQ/Smoker was clean and easy to use, and the kitchen had everything we needed to prepare meals. The view from the deck is even better than the photos. I absolutely recommend his home, and we are making plans for future visits! "
3418230,38416249,2015-07-15,36097988,Seemanta,"Kyle is an excellent host! He is always responsive, replies within minutes of contacting him. He setup the place very nicely for me and my friends.

The house is at an excellent location, and met all our needs. The house is well maintained, clean and exactly as mentioned in the listing. Actually, scratch that. It was even better than how it looked like in the listing. The view is spectacular and like someone said, the photos on the listing do not do this place enough justice.

We all were highly impressed with Kyle's alacrity and fast response times. There is no doubt that if any of my friends or I are going to be back in Seattle, this place is going to be our first choice!

The kitchen we well maintained. The bathroom was clean. The living space was very well maintained as well.

It really felt like it was our own home. Kyle's house is a gem tucked away in one of the most picturesque locations of Seattle!"
3418230,41933996,2015-08-10,25519095,Justin,"Kyle is a fantastic host. He made us feel very welcome, and was thoroughly helpful both in planning our arrival to the location, as well as things to do around the area. The listing is accurate, and that view is no joke! The neighborhood is quiet and definitely family-friendly. I didn't have a problem getting an Uber or Lyft to pick me up nearby. I would say that it's advisable to walk down the public stairs first, as that leads to the main road. Would definitely recommend Kyle as a host again!"
3418230,45340709,2015-09-01,41094419,Dominique,"The experience was great! He gave us alerts when the whether was bad and knocked out the power. He even left us candles and a flashlight after we said we probably wouldn't be back to the accommodation in time to experience the power outage just in case. He also made sure we had all the toiletries we needed, towels, blankets, and pillows. An Uber ride to the city is only about 10 bucks, so it's a great location as well! 5/5 would stay here again if we came back to Seattle."
6856295,35441370,2015-06-18,30746840,Jack,"Pallavi was the sweetest host! She went out of her way to make me feel welcome. She constantly was in touch at my disposal to make my stay as pleasant as possible. The room was small, but it suited me perfectly. It was in absolute pristine condition and the neighborhood was exactly the same. Very quiet, nice, and it made me feel quitee at home."
6856295,35744303,2015-06-21,13891714,Kashif,"The neighborhood was nice. The room just as it looks, and the hosts were very nice (gave us the key at arrival, which was late in the night and then just let us be).
The location very useful for a tourist looking to go around to see Seattle with public transport not that far.
The room had all the things that could be needed, a TV, internet, fridge, microwave. I liked the overall experience."
6856295,35887257,2015-06-22,455868,Anand,"Pallavi and Sameer were excellent hosts.  They were very accommodating to my young family and even added an extra appliance to the suite when we expressed a need.  They also checked in with us via text multiple times to ensure a comfortable stay.  The suite is cozy and clean, with lots of light, nice fixtures and our own entrance.  We loved how close the room was to the heart of Ballard and enjoyed exploring this cute neighborhood."
6856295,37086140,2015-07-04,29593641,Mary Ann,"What a wonderful experience and place!  And the hosts are the nicest, kindest folks you will meet. 
From the beginning of our correspondence, Pallavi was very responsive and kind. Everything went 100% smooth, from inquiry, check in, the stay, and check out. 
VERY BEAUTIFUL SUITE!!! Perfect!  Located at ground level(not a basement!) of a brand new home. Private entrance, complete privacy, quiet, very safe neighborhood, awesome PRIVATE lanai right off of the suite!!! Such calm and serene energy flows in this space and property.   Pallavi and her husband are very kind and attentive, yet the space and experience is private. If I needed anything, they were a text away. The space is beautiful, cozy, perfect for a couple. 
Downtown Ballard, which is two minute walk, is so fun!  Check out Cupcake Royale and the Golden Beetle. We also walked to the Ballard locks. My husband worked in dr SEATTLE during the week, so the location is perfect for that, ez commute to the heart of Seattle and all the attractions. You gotta check out Fremont and the Flying Apron gluten free bakery!
Thank you for the wonderful stay!!!
We are already booked for our next stay here later in July. "
6856295,37629907,2015-07-08,37683302,Pam,"I had a marvelous stay at this lovely site. The room was as described, clean, comfortable, private, easy to access. Pallavi was incredibly welcoming, available, and flexible. My only sadness was that I eventually had to leave! Highly recommended."
6856295,38173184,2015-07-13,5265887,Pearl,"My boyfriend and I had experienced several delays with our flight so we couldn't make it to our originally scheduled check-in time. Thankfully, Pallavi responded quickly to our update and made sure she would be home upon our newly scheduled arrival. 

Once we got there, we didn't have any problem finding parking near the house (we rented a car via RelayRides). We were pleasantly surprised by a new and modern 2-story apartment building. Pallavi graciously greeted us and led us through a small garden path that wrapped around the outside of the building that took us to the private entrance to the guest room. Right outside of the guest room was a charming private back patio that Pallavi said we could use whenever we liked.  

Pallavi had thoughtfully furnished the room with everything we would need for a comfortable stay. The room itself was the perfect size for just the two of us. A plush, full-sized bed was neatly made, and the desk on the opposite side of the room had a small tray with an electric kettle, coffee, tea, and light snacks, as well as well as guides and brochures for exploring Seattle. The bathroom had modern fixtures and was SO clean (which is sometimes all you really want to see after a long trip!!). The shower even had a shower gel and shampoo dispenser attached to the wall. It was little details like this that assured us that we were in good hands. After Pallavi finished her quick tour she ensured us that we could contact her at any time in case we needed anything and left to let us settle in.

Pallavi had plenty of recommendations for exploring the neighborhood, and Ballard didn't disappoint. Great cafes, boutiques, restaurants, and landmarks were only a 10-20 minute walk away (depending on how far you wanted to go) and we could easily spend an entire day there. Ballard Market (open 24 hours) was also only a few minutes walk and was a great last-minute stop for fresh produce snacks, and toiletries. 

Pallavi and Samir themselves were thoughtful and kind hosts. They gave us plenty of privacy and we didn't run into them during the day, but Pallavi did invite us to coffee with them if we wanted (we gladly accepted!). It was wonderful getting to know them--if you're looking for good food (or a solid brew) and good conversation, I highly recommend it :). 

All in all, I loved staying here and would give my stay six stars if I could. Thanks so much Pallavi + Samir! Hopefully we'll be back sooner than later :D!"
6856295,40177613,2015-07-28,16513364,Kate & Mark,"We really enjoyed our stay at this place. The suite has a private entrance and gated outdoor patio. It is in ideal Ballard location - walking distance to many restaurants, coffee shops, and the locks. Easy access to biking trails to downtown and Golden Gardens. Easy street parking. The hosts were very welcoming and incredibly nice. Would definitely recommend staying here!"
6856295,40294756,2015-07-29,11872281,Catherine,"This little place is perfect for two people looking to stay in a trendy neighborhood in Seattle. The description was beyond accurate and the amenities were everything a high maintenance girl like me could ask for. The private entrance was perfect and our hosts were fabulous, welcoming, helpful, and sweet. Couldn't have asked for a better place to stay in Seattle!!!"
6856295,40492416,2015-07-31,34234478,Bob,"We had a wonderful stay at Pallavi and Sameer's and actually found out during our visit that we might be making another trip to Seattle soon and were disappointed to see what their place was already booked for that night! Pallavi went out of her way to accommodate our changing arrival time and all communication with her before and during our stay, in messages and in person, was clear and friendly. She also kindly stored our luggage on our departure day. The room was great, with a comfortable bed and luxurious bathroom, screened windows that opened to let in the cool air at night (Seattle broke a heat record on the day we were there, but the room was still perfectly comfortable), and easy street parking right outside the house. We like Ballard a lot, found the location to be perfect, and would definitely recommend Pallavi and Sameer as hosts and their suite as a great place for a comfortable Seattle stay."
6856295,40666910,2015-08-01,7229098,Richard,"The room was very comfortable, quiet and impeccably clean. The hosts were considerate and polite and all communications were very smooth. We thoroughly recommend this as good value for money in a city that is generally expensive."
6856295,41230564,2015-08-05,37173631,Donna,The room was private and very clean.  The bed was comfortable and a modern shower.  The host were very quiet in the morning and nights so as to not disturb you. They were very friendly and willing accommodate whatever your needs were. 
6856295,41976251,2015-08-10,37093501,Josh And Pauline,"We absolutely loved our stay with Pallavi and Sameer. They are very thoughtful, kind, and respectful hosts, and we highly recommend their place to you.

The room and bathroom were impeccably clean, and we were impressed by the modern finishes in the bathroom, as well as the availability of a fridge, microwave, TV, and fan for added comfort. They clearly have made an effort to create a space that is perfect for their guests. We also really appreciated the little touches, such as the snacks, toothbrush holder, and luggage rack. Although we were too busy exploring the Seattle area to enjoy the space, it was really nice that there was a private, outdoor seating area too.

Their place is located in a quiet, safe neighborhood and is an easy stroll to the main, bustling streets of Ballard. We enjoyed the Ballard farmer's market and the many restaurants on Market Street, as well as the convenience of their location to downtown Seattle.

We also greatly valued our communication and interactions with them. They replied promptly to emails, offered ideas of things to do in the area, and checked in with us after our first night to see if there was anything they could do to make our stay better. It was extremely easy to coordinate picking up / dropping off the key. We felt that they respected our privacy but were available if we needed help.

We had an excellent stay and definitely would stay here again!"
6856295,42186348,2015-08-11,25616688,Corinne,It was a lovely place in Ballard. We really enjoyed our stay. The location was perfect. We loved it. The host Pallavi was really nice and helpful.
6856295,42353174,2015-08-12,40794094,Colleen,"Ms. Sharma was professional, flexible and timely.  She was at the location for check in exactly when she stated and provided an expedient check in experience.  This room was very clean, streamlines and the bathroom was impressively spic and span.  If you are a technology ace, there is a big screen and a business desk.  Also, there is a closet to hang your finery and a private back patio.  The door could be left open where an amazing breeze was blowing through during my visit which was very refreshing.  I would stay here again if traveling in the Ballard area.  "
6856295,42915517,2015-08-16,29479544,Christine,"We were very satisfied with our hosts. Pallavi and Sameer were very accommodating throughout the booking process right up until we left. We went with our 16 month old baby and she checked with us several times to see if there was anything she could do to make our stay as comfortable as possible. We appreciated that they moved some room items to make more space, brought extra padding for her bed and helped us with our excessive luggage. I would say that the room size is perfect for a single person or a couple but was a bit tight for our family with an active little girl. That said, it was fine for a night and it depends what you are used to!

The room had a comfortable queen bed with silky bedding, a sparkling and tasteful bathroom and convenient extras like a fridge, microwave, and luggage stand. The outdoor space was nice to have. Everything felt clean and well-cared for.

The ease of checking in and out, coming and going and finding parking was perfect and the neighbourhood was simply the best. We loved finding a nearby yard sale, park, and countless places to eat delicious food.

If you haven't been to this area, I would highly recommend staying in here in Ballard. It's got a great vibe starting with the friendliest hosts."
6856295,43162610,2015-08-17,27319999,Landon,"Was this a hotel? Felt like one but with more charm and personability. In the absolute best neighbourhood and easily walkable from great bars, restaurants and shops."
6856295,43469183,2015-08-19,19544441,Amy,"The photos on Airbnb due not do justice to the space. It is very modern and in a great location. It feels very private and with a dedicated entrance feels very much like a hotel room (in a good way). I travel to Seattle for work and will be staying here repeatedly and will recommend to my work team. Pallavi's communication was excellent and timely and she was very gracious and warm. I appreciated that she had some nice amenities- like coffee, shampoo and a hairdryer available."
6856295,43596321,2015-08-20,550305,Scott,"Pallavi was super communicative and welcoming right from the start. She communicated very promptly and was really flexible with how we could check in and check out. Once we arrived, she made sure we had everything we needed. The room was very quiet and private. Loved the exterior entrance and the private patio. We never heard a peep from the rest of the house while we were there.

What a lovely place to stay. If we need a place in Seattle again, we'll definitely check to see if this room is available."
6856295,43707414,2015-08-21,41418876,Kelsey,"We couldn't have asked for a better experience staying with Pallavi. She worked with us as our arrival time was variable and we wanted to catch a sunset before grabbing the key to the room. The private entrance bedroom and bathroom were wonderful! Ballard (the neighborhood) is one of the nicest in Seattle. Parking was easy on the street, and the house is a very short walk to restaurants and shops. Pallavi also provided great recommendations for breakfast/brunch. We'd stay here again in a heartbeat! "
6856295,43982916,2015-08-23,6147118,Bethany,"Pallavi was great! Their place is really close to Market street, which is great, and the room is gorgeous and perfect. They were so sweet, too. It was our 5th wedding anniversary, and they had chocolate and wine waiting for us. Little touches around the room that were so thoughtful. Thank you guys so much!"
6856295,44459381,2015-08-26,3801796,Jessica,"Pallavi and her husband are wonderful hosts! They even came to rescue us late at night when we were lost and brought us food on arrival. The room is private, clean and comfortable. Highly recommend! "
6856295,44937983,2015-08-30,6452792,Randy,"Pallavi met us upon our arrival, told us where the unit was and send us emails to check that everything was right. The room was spotless and comfortable. Being in walking distance of our son was a major bonus."
6856295,45281071,2015-09-01,6566832,Clément,"Perfect stay. Very convenient location, very short drive from city center. Moreover,  we had an awesome dinner in neighborhood, 5 mn walk. Bedroom was lovely, perfectly clean. Total privacy and freedom to come and go. Pallavi and Sameer were very welcoming and always willing to help. Highly recommended!"
6856295,45955877,2015-09-07,37603446,Ryan,Pallavi was an excellent host and we could not have asked for a better stay for our first Airbnb experience.  Weeks before we arrived Pallavi provided a lot of tips/suggestions for us to do while in Seattle and they were all wonderful and great recommendations to help make our visit a more pleasant experience.  The room was perfect and in great condition when we arrived.  We really liked the private entrance and the bed was super comfortable.  The location was awesome and had easy access to downtown Ballard and public transportation to get you anywhere in the city.  I would highly recommend staying with Pallavi and Sameer to anyone looking for a place in Seattle.
6856295,47725007,2015-09-21,30091560,Elise,Room as expected.  Hosts worked with our schedule for arrival.  
6856295,48153015,2015-09-23,3332083,Nigel,"I stayed for an enjoyable and comfortable 3 nights. It was quiet and as described by the Air BnB site.. 
The welcome from the owner was very warm and she could not have been more helpful. She answered a number of queries about the neighbourhood. 
It was useful to have a microwave and fridge.
I hope to return to the States and Seattle and would hope to stay in this house again.
"
6856295,48369880,2015-09-25,36747701,Kris,"My stay at Pallavi's place was excellent.  It is new and clean.  Pallavi greeted me and showed me the space and was very kind, even pointing out that we were very close, within walking distance to the Ballard Market.

I really liked that it has a private entry as I returned from a night out very late, and left early in the morning.

I really enjoyed my stay and hope to return.

The neighborhood is a wonderful collection of well kept bungalows. I felt comfortable parking my car on the street."
6856295,48697303,2015-09-28,9176848,Bonnie,The host made us feel welcome.  The room was just as advertised and the location was perfect for exploring downtown Ballard.  
6856295,48920825,2015-09-29,9176848,Bonnie,"
Pahlavi was kind and helpful "
6856295,49193514,2015-10-01,45161174,Jennifer,Pallavi was sweet and accommodating! I arrived late at night due to unforseen circumstances and she was still happy to greet me and accommodate me however she could. The place was clean and comfortable. Would definitely stay here again!
6856295,49302007,2015-10-02,4449156,Joel,Fantastic host! I couldn't have asked for a better spot. The private entrance makes this experience so comfortable. Pallavi was very helpful the entire way through the the process. This spot is just up the street from the best spots in Ballard. Thank you so much!
6856295,49415290,2015-10-03,844393,Brenda,Pallavi and her hubby are wonderful. The room and home was immaculate. We put in a request to book their place and they were very kind at accepting our request last minute. Again the room was spectacular and the neighborhood is fantastic. Many great restaurants  and excellent nightlife. Would definitely recommend this wonderful place. 
6856295,49479226,2015-10-04,10103404,Ann,"The neighborhood was very quiet.  The bedroom and bathroom were clean and comfortable.  Although I didn't meet Pallavi, she gave me clear instructions for a self check-in.  It was nice that the bedroom included a microwave, tea kettle and small refrigerator.  There was lots of on-street parking and the neighborhood seemed very safe."
6856295,49855994,2015-10-06,17936577,David,"Simple and easy. The space is extremely well maintained, private, and in a perfect part of town. Would happily stay again and hope too in the future :)"
6856295,50015913,2015-10-08,19544441,Amy,"Second time staying here. Super friendly, super easy, super convenient. Great place. I'll be back again. "
6856295,50294704,2015-10-11,20323325,Christina,"Pallavi went above and beyond the call of duty to help me in advance of a trip to Seattle with my husband. We went for my brother's wedding and needed a steamer for my dress and my husband's suit. When I asked if she had one, I was more than surprised to hear back from Pallavi that she purchased a steamer to have on hand when we got there. It is gestures like this that make staying in an AirBnb so much more meaningful than a hotel. My husband and I were comfortable, able to unwind in between wedding events and able to show up at the wedding wrinkle-free. Pallavi was also extremely flexible with our arrival plans - which were changing frequently ahead of the wedding. Thank you so much for a great stay in Ballard!"
6856295,50717430,2015-10-13,5326801,Jon,Pallavi was an excellent host.  It was very easy to communicate and coordinate with her. They have a beautiful home which is in a great location.
6856295,50890257,2015-10-15,8971068,Casey,"Our stay was absolutely lovely. Pallavi was kind and welcoming, excellent at communication, and gave us recommendations for landmarks and eateries in the locale. The room is quiet and very nice, with a private entrance and small patio outside, and upgraded fixtures inside. Easy access to bus lines made our travels around the city pleasant and simple. We will come here again, thank you!"
6856295,51089126,2015-10-17,10458907,Eugenia,"Pallavi was great! We communicated clearly via text, she greeted me with the key and I was free to come and go from the private entrance/room with my friend whenever. Clean place, very comfortable bed, beautiful modern bathroom, and complimentary teas and snacks provided! She even has a mini fridge, microwave, hot water boiler, paper cups, and an extra comforter if needed. All very convenient.

Only slightly negative thing is location - if you don't mind the very suburban Ballard (a very nice neighborhood) and have a car, it's perfect. My friend and I were trying to explore Seattle with public transportation so it was a bit out of the main action of Seattle. However, there's a bus stop two blocks away walking and restaurants/bars in that area, with the bus taking you to downtown Seattle in 20 minutes or so. 

So in reality, since the bus takes you to downtown Seattle in 20 minutes or so, it's a great location but it FEELS far/removed. Depends on how you see it. 

Besides that, this airbnb was great and Pallavi was a wonderful host. Thank you so much again!"
6856295,51904581,2015-10-25,10041116,Douglas,"Pallavi's spare bedroom was ideal, private separate entrance, a bed, bathroom, desk and a couple chairs, fridge & microwave.  In Ballard you don't need anything else.

Communication and check in/out was easy, even though I kept very weird hours.

I hope to return."
6856295,53028527,2015-11-03,19175953,Jane,I would stay here again! Pallavi was extremely welcoming and made sure we had everything we needed. The room was just as the photos show. It was a lovely quiet spot.  The bed was quite comfortable.  It was a good experience!
6856295,53307913,2015-11-07,47839880,Xiujuan,"We had a wonderful stay in Pallavi's place! We were unable to meet them in person, but Pallavi gave very detailed helpful instructions regarding self check in. The neighborhood is also very clean and safe, within walking distance to Ballard downtown. The amenities are exactly what you see in the pictures. "
6856295,53937472,2015-11-14,42081541,Jann,"Pallavi was a great host and our room was just as described and also very clean and private. Pallavi was informative and enthusiastic about her neighbourhood.  We enjoyed our stay.   The location in proximity to shopping and restaurants was excellent.





"
6856295,54653007,2015-11-22,38518332,Janine,The neighborhood is attractive and a place that I would be very comfortable living in.  Pallavi's home is new and modern and very comfortable.  They have done a great job of providing everything one might need.  Will definitely stay here again.
6856295,56468039,2015-12-13,41090750,Peter,"Me and my wife decided to extend our stay in Ballard at the last minute and needed a place to stay. Pallavi's private room and bath was perfect. Clean, private, updated, easy access.........no negatives whatsoever. This will be at the top of our list next time we're in town."
6856295,58232590,2016-01-01,14061660,Brock,"Great location, new clean & private room. Didn't get to meet our hosts, but they made it very easy for us to get into the room and they were very accommodating.  I would highly recommend a stay here for anyone looking for accommodations in the Ballard area"
8902327,56818248,2015-12-18,1495780,James,"We had a great experience in a fantastic space -- an amazing value at $100 a night. The accommodations are new, modern and very clean. The space was outfit with many convenient accoutrements. We were want for nothing. 

The neighborhood is very safe, very walkable and scenic. It is close to the university district and not far from downtown. View of the water from the apartment is amazing."
8902327,57333693,2015-12-24,18708107,Jessica,"It is nicer than hotels, totally worth it. The window view and cozy rooms... AWESOME!!! Just a 15min walk away from U of Washington, easy access to bus to downtown. Glen and Maggie were quick in responding for any questions. I would definately recommend this place to people who will stay in Seattle."
6272065,33156237,2015-05-25,6981707,DeCarlis,"From the moment I got to Kati's doorstep she was warm and welcoming. She helped me with my belongings. We chatted about good eats and craft beers. She introduced me to her loving cats. The room was extremely clean, and the view to the back deck completed the room's look. Speaking of the room's look, the artwork and subtle touches made it feel like home away from home. Throughout my three night stay Kati was very responsive. 

The location was superb, only a couple of blocks from the 'corridor' in Capital Hill where all the bars and shops are. It's also where I hung out the majority of the time. In the immediate surrounding area there are coffee shops, small convenience stores and a couple of bars.

Overall, I can say my trip to Seattle wouldn't have been the same had I not stayed with Kati. The location was great, the bed was comfortable, the room and bathroom was clean. Everything you'd want out of an airbnb. "
6272065,37169152,2015-07-05,19310537,Meghan,"Kati was fantastic! We hardly ever saw her room mate so can't say too much about him. She was super helpful in recommending places nearby where we could go to eat and for coffee, once she even drove us to the club because she had a rental car that day. Very friendly and welcoming!"
6272065,38385386,2015-07-15,32083167,Shawn,"Kati was extremely welcoming and accommodating, allowing us to check in and out at our pleasure. The room  was just as pictured and described, and kept neat and tidy. Her place is literally right around the corner from several bus stops, which we loved because we flew into Seattle. There was plenty of closet space for which she provided hangars, and also plenty of open drawers for you to put your clothes. We personally didn't use these just because we prefer to live out of our suitcase. My girlfriend loved that a Roku was provided so that we could watch Netflix and relax in bed after being on our feet all day. There was also a small collection of interesting books to read available in the room as well. 

We didn't get to interact with Kati very much, but this was mostly because we were out and about most of the time. However, Kati was always reachable by phone and always answered promptly. The few times that we saw Kati however, she was always friendly and warm. 

Her cats sometimes surprise you and definitely roam around the house, so if you are allergic, this probably won't be the place for you. The cutest one was Molly, who could climb in bed with us and ask for rubs in between chasing her own tail!! 

I'd definitely recommend staying here."
6272065,38854978,2015-07-19,14403689,Kana,"Kati was very quick to respond to any questions I had about our stay. We did not get to explore the Capitol Hill area very much due to a lot of other events going on for us this trip. But from what I hear it is a fun place to go out.  The room was exactly as described, very clean and comfortable.  There is a back patio attached to the room which was nice and let in some cool air into the room.  Parking is free right outside her house. She does have a roommate but we never actually saw him. They have wifi.  Cute cats.  Thanks Kati!"
6272065,41756999,2015-08-09,34549965,Danielle,Kati was very friendly. The place was in a spot close to a lot of bus stop which was nice. Overall a great experience. :)
6272065,42911203,2015-08-16,7393895,Sophie,"Kati's room is clean and the patio is really a big plus for some outside private place.
Kati was nice and very discreet, she made her arrival easy and smooth."
6272065,43577451,2015-08-20,17972319,New,"My experience at Kati's was great.  Her place is easy to get to, the room is cozy and she's a wonderful host.  "
6272065,43977866,2015-08-23,4701205,Michiel,"Kati was a very welcoming and accommodating host. We were arriving late on the first day and that was no problem, she was there to greet us. On the last day Kati let us keep our stuff at the house for a few hours while we explored Seattle. The house is nice and in a quiet neighborhood. It's close to Capitol Hill with great bars and restaurants "
6272065,44624327,2015-08-27,27748965,Cecilia And Bryan,Kati was more than willing to accommodate our last minute booking. The room was clean and comfortable and much appreciated. 
6272065,45735477,2015-09-05,7690746,Jane,Kati was very friendly and her house was quiet and peaceful.  I only spent one night here but Kati was a great host and I felt very welcome.  
6272065,46616080,2015-09-12,39192280,Julieann,"Katie was a great host; very friendly and respectful of our privacy. The room was just as described. We stayed for 4 nights and loved the bed-super comfy. I especially enjoyed having access to the back patio from our room; it was great for morning coffee/reading. Katie has 3 cats who will definitely stop by and say hi if you leave any of the doors open. The ""little cow"" looking one is very friendly and loves to snuggle (Tip: use both hands while petting and you'll have a new bff). The roommate is hardly home; we did see him once and we exchanged good mornings. The best part about staying at Katie's is the location; perfect for experiencing Seattle culture. Bars, restaurants and clubs are all within a mile of the home and just a few miles to downtown. Netflix is available in the room which came in quite handy on nights we felt like turning in early. I highly recommend staying at Katie's if you want a real Seattle experience. "
6272065,48064754,2015-09-23,19591317,Liz,Basic and straightforward; no real common area but good if you just need a place to sleep and shower. Walkable to Cap Hill and right on a bus line. 
1513847,7678427,2013-09-29,6916679,Barbara,"Staying at Joni's house was a wonderful experience!  The house is just perfect....everything we were hoping for and more!  The location is terrific; within an easy walk to many shops and excellent restaurants.  Joni is such a considerate host, providing everything we would need for a comfortable stay....including  comprehensive information on the city and the surrounding area..   The backyard is lovely, the beds are comfortable, and the house is immaculately clean...this is truly a special place to stay!







"
1513847,12304916,2014-04-28,8490833,Ralph,"Joni was always prompt at getting back to us and was unobtrusive and facilitated our stay without a hitch. Her bungalow is charming, clean, in working order and very comfortable. Although we didn't cook this time, the kitchen is well stocked.  The neighborhood is very walkable, with cafes and eateries within 5 minutes ( a pizzeria is within a stone's throw). I will definitely return!"
1513847,18543152,2014-08-28,4726905,Aimee,"Perfect location for a Seattle visit. Home was well equipped, clean and a great size for a family of four!"
1513847,18720871,2014-08-31,2327404,Clayton,"We had a great time in Seattle in no small part thanks to Joni and her beautiful home! The location is amazing - very close to restaurants and shops in Wallingford and Fremont. The home was immaculate with plenty of clean towels, bedding and kitchenware. Joni even had frosty beer mugs ready for us in the freezer! We would love to stay here again the next time we are in Seattle."
1513847,26662967,2015-02-16,27152266,Janet,"Joni responded in minutes and was so pleasant! The house was perfect, just like the pictures only better because you don't see the neighborhood in the pictures. It's a wonderful location in a quaint neighborhood, we walked to restaurants, ran to the waterfront and drove to Gas Works Park. Loved Joni's recommendation for great Thai food and then awesome ice cream on the walk home. Great coffee shops around and short drive to everything we wanted to see.
Thanks and we hope to be back again soon!"
1513847,27081567,2015-02-24,28055872,David,"This was my very first airbnb rental and it was perfect for my parents and I. The craftsmanship and cleanliness of the home was impeccable. The kitchen was a tad small (I am however 6'4""), but with all of the good eats in the neighborhood it was the least of our concerns. We all slept very soundly, my mother said she slept better there than she does in her own bed. I'd give it 5/5 stars. 

Joni was amazing as well. Prompt at returning questions and concerns about the home and neighborhood. When we return to Seattle in the next couple weeks I really hope we can rent the house again."
1513847,28965962,2015-04-01,51493,Mike,"Joni's bungalow is in a great location with convenient access to a higher end grocery store and multiple dining options.

Street parking was easy to find, not directly in front of the house but around the block.

Shower water pressure was good. The shower head was a bit low, so a little uncomfortable for taller people.

Beds were very comfortable. Clean sheets, towels and shampoo/soap were provided. The heater also worked great!

Overall, excellent value for a private home in a safe neighborhood. Joni even had a bottle of wine ready on the island counter to welcome us!"
1513847,29436415,2015-04-07,16925637,Kate,Perfect location in Fremont. Easy check-in/check-out. It was quite comfortable and provided easy access to everything we were hoping to enjoy. 
1513847,32266116,2015-05-16,19653199,Casey,"This was a great house in a walkable location! Everything was clean and stocked - nothing we needed or wanted while we were there. The best Air Bnb house we've stayed in so far. Joni even lent us a pack 'n play so we didn't have to bring our own! We had a question and Joni was quick to respond by text! 

The only con was the fact that it was shared with permanent downstairs tenants. While we had minimal direct contact with them (not super friendly, but not rude either), we could hear most of what they did. Of the 4 nights there, 2 were quiet (only heard them coming and going - the door slamming). The other 2 were louder than we'd like (mainly because we had our toddler with us who goes to bed earleir). 1 night music blared for 3 hours. The tenant lowered it when we asked, but still could hear it. The other night they had a cookout with friends and while they weren't ridiculously loud, you could just hear everything that was going on. Along the same lines, we had a 2 year old, so every time he raised his voice, I felt a little guilty assuming the tenants downstairs could hear him. "
1513847,33156301,2015-05-25,10442163,Simran & Thejasvi,"We had a wonderful stay at Joni's warm and cozy bungalow.  We stayed there with our infant daughter, a friend, and her toddler and we couldn't have been more comfortable.  The home was tidy, comfortable, spacious, and since her downstairs tenants were away for the long weekend, we had the yard to ourselves.  Her place is in a great location (we enjoyed many walks in the neighborhood to do groceries, pick up take out, and try delicious Molly Moon's ice cream) and everything we could have needed was available in the home (pots, pans, utensils, towels, extra blankets, etc.).  Joni was extremely responsive to any questions we had before our visit and even had a binder of helpful resources available in her home.  We'd definitely consider staying here again on a future visit to Seattle.  Thanks Joni!"
1513847,36092788,2015-06-25,27200790,Maggie,"Good location, easy walking to restaurants. This house was very clean as described. Joni was thoughtful and provided a lot of information that we might need. We are willing to stay here again when visiting Seattle next time."
1513847,37279834,2015-07-06,25240091,Beth,"This was our first Airbnb experience and it was a great one! We loved the house and the neighborhood. The downstairs tenants were pleasant and using the driveway was no problem, which was very nice as the on street parking was limited. We learned our way around quickly and found all sorts of wonderful places to eat, playgrounds for our five-year old, and an easy driving route downtown. We did bring in groceries and found the kitchen well stocked with everything from knives to spices. It was a bit of an education process to understand the composting vs recycling vs trash but there were instructions posted. All in all a very enjoyable vacation.  "
1513847,38581584,2015-07-17,1746244,Lori,"Joni's cottage is a peaceful oasis in the city...charming, beautiful, clean, quiet, comfortable, functional and well organized.  Our family of three felt right at home and supported by Joni's clear and friendly communication.  The location is superb - close to Green Lake, Ballard, Fremont, Downtown, parks, and good restaurants.  Highly recommended by the Nakano family."
1513847,40075916,2015-07-28,28406302,Jeffrey,"Very nice home in a great location just north of Seattle. The kitchen was well appointed and equipped. There are a number of interesting restaurants and shops in proximity to the house. The house is tastefully appointed with interesting architectural features.
The couple that were renting the basement apartment were charming.
The location provided relatively easy access to many of the sites in Seattle that we wanted to see."
1513847,47181640,2015-09-16,7205811,Megan,this place is so cute. and it's in walking distance to the adorable fremont neighborhood. i loved it. joni was super communicative and helpful!
1513847,48942049,2015-09-29,27676006,Erin,"Cozy house in a perfect location! Reserved Joni's place for my parents visit to Seattle, and we couldn't have had a better experience. The house was very clean and the street was quiet, yet still relatively close to a selection of restaurants and cafes. My parents thoroughly enjoyed everything about their stay here. Would definitely recommend it to others looking for a relaxing stay in Seattle. "
1513847,49954280,2015-10-07,45518127,Katie,Loved the house! It was clean and well maintained. Joni was always quick to respond. Easy check in and check out.
1513847,51398269,2015-10-19,46485476,Rachel,Our stay at Joni's house was nothing but wonderful. I would recommend it to anyone visiting Seattle. 
1513847,55374337,2015-12-01,25325928,Jen,"This is an adorable craftsman house! We rented it for the holiday to have our parents stay nearby and they loved it. Joni was excellent in helping us get everything set up as well. All in all, a wonderful experience!"
1513847,56713265,2015-12-17,7074133,Gary,"My wife and I found Joni's home to be very clean and inviting. Joni greeted us upon arrival and took the necessary time to show us the house and give us some ideas for dining and entertainment in the area. She was truly interested in making our stay comfortable and enjoyable. Everything in the house was found to be in good working order; TV, Internet, dishwasher, microwave, fireplace, etc. An added plus is the off street parking she has for her guests. The neighborhood was found to be very active, friendly, and safe. An easy walk to Green Lake and public transportation. I'd highly recommend Joni's house to any travelers looking for an experience living in a Seattle neighborhood with easy access to all that Seattle has to offer."
9865846,56968764,2015-12-20,37519402,Joy,"Rachel and her roommate Sarah were both really cool chicks. Rachel kept great communication with me and made our stay so comfortable. We never felt rushed or anything about checking in and out, as they were really accommodating. The apartment was amazing... spacious, cozy, and clean, and in an awesome location. I felt like I was just casually staying over at a good friend's place!
Both Rachel and Sarah offered suggestions as to where to go. I'd never been to Seattle before and wanted to make the most out of my trip, and thanks to their friendliness and suggestions, I ended up experiencing more than I'd hoped for!"
8168476,50781448,2015-10-14,22895759,Katherine,What can I say. Everything was heaven. The bed. The couch. The shower. The kitchen. It's the perfect location. Check in and out was easy and communication was fast! Can't wait to go back!
9568491,55514551,2015-12-01,41158892,Paige,"Erika was an awesome, super friendly host! I had a great time staying here-- the space was just what I needed."
9568491,55868873,2015-12-06,3628918,Rochelle,"Erika is a wonderful hostess! She is very welcoming and accommodating. Cute place in a new building, easy to find & close to downtown yet away from the traffic."
9568491,56682861,2015-12-16,49964426,Jessica,"My friend and I stayed at Erika's for 3 nights and simply loved our experience. Erika was very helpful in suggesting places for us to visit and ways to get around the city, as well as was super friendly and personable. She is great to talk to, but also gave us privacy. We actually didn't see her much since she works in the evenings, so we mostly had the place to ourselves when we came back after a long day of exploring. The apartment is essentially brand new and very modern. Erika keeps her place very clean and we were very happy to find bedding & towels waiting for us. We slept on a queen size air mattress and a leather couch in the living room, which was very comfortable. The location of the apartment was great and we loved checking out the cool coffee shops & cafes around. Easy access to bus routes and just a short walk to a cute downtown area. As two girls traveling alone, we felt very safe in that neighborhood, even at night, and had no issues. Exchanging keys was very easy and Erika was super flexible about our check-in/check-out times. Overall my friend & I had an awesome trip to Seattle and Erika's place was the perfect little spot for us. We would stay with her again in a heartbeat and are already considering planning a trip for the summer! Thanks again, Erika!"
9568491,57389904,2015-12-25,41559674,Mayumi,"Erika is so friendly and kind.she always tried to me get comfortable.
The house is also great. Very clean and newly.
I hadn't had any problems during my stay. I'll never forget that I had a gorgeous dinner in the restaurant which she works.  So nice !!
"
2158992,41437763,2015-08-07,1578154,Robert,"I was a single traveller for business and stayed for 2 weeks.

I didn't meet Carola but she was always quick to respond and very helpful. The house was lovely and the pictures are accurate it was very clean and well presented.

The area is as she says in a neighbourhood/family area so was very quiet at night which was good for me as it was a work trip. Ballard's main shops and bars are around a 15-20min walk away or less than 5mins by bus. It was very close to the number 40 bus line which was convenient for getting to Fremont or Downtown.

I didn't see the neighbour who waters the garden once so it was not a problem at all for me. Didn't use the garden much but it looked very nice with room to sit and have a bbq outside.

Was a really good place to stay for my business trip was cheaper than a hotel and having a cooker, washing machine etc. made the two weeks much nicer. 
"
2158992,43653147,2015-08-21,1744605,E.,"Carola was a great host . Awesome place. Spectacularly convenient. Spotlessly clean. The garden in the back of the house is a wonderful place to relax , it was a wonderful stay in such a beautiful and cozy place "
2158992,45991060,2015-09-07,40072493,Aurore & Florent,"We spent 2 fantastic weeks in Carola's home. The place is lovely, clean and in a quiet area. The garden is a very nice place to relax and have dinner, using the BBQ put at disposal. 
We also appreciated Carola's advice regarding the neighborhood and nice places to visit in Seattle.
We highly recommend this home and would be happy to come back in the future for a next visit of the city and its surroundings."
2158992,51538611,2015-10-21,9943784,Courtney,"My husband and I had a wonderful month long stay in Carola's home while making a move to Seattle. Carola was incredibly responsive, helpful and kind. The home is in a lovely quiet neighborhood close to an assortment of parks, shops and restaurants and is an easy drive downtown. Overall, it is a terrific home away from home that we highly recommend! "
8174285,51743421,2015-10-24,15294096,Chris,I really enjoyed my stay in Cam's apartment.  He made me feel very welcome on arrival and had lots of useful hints and tips for things to do in the local area.  I would certainly stay there again.
4716486,45754729,2015-09-05,42874152,Corey,"This was my first time using Airbnb. I was not disappointed. Being it that Judd has no previous reviews, I'm under the assumption that this is his first time hosting. Regardless, Judd provided great service. He picked up my phone calls and was punctual on responses/replies. Left us notes for any concerns that we might have about the home. Would recommend using Judd and his home to book a stay. Very flexible, lenient and down to Earth. "
4716486,50355197,2015-10-11,23395368,Shelley,Cute quirky house - near the beautiful Seward Park. 
4716486,51864424,2015-10-24,23587548,Jen,"Judd was an amazing host! He really cares about the people that stay at the house and it felt very welcoming. The house was charming and it did feel like ""home"". I would stay again if in Seattle, what a gem! "
4716486,53237614,2015-11-06,24674663,Wes,The host canceled this reservation 8 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
4716486,55249722,2015-11-29,1178421,Stephanie,"My husband and I were in town from Portland for the weekend to run the marathon at Seward Park. This little house served our needs perfectly. It is definitely funky and quirky, but it is warm and cozy and a close walk to the lake. Judd was a great host and his instructions for the house were easy to follow. "
4716486,56463064,2015-12-13,34784157,Tara,"We had a great stay here! It is definitely a bit like house sitting for a friend who happens to have an older house (right down to the bathroom door that sometimes locks itself and the interesting tilted floors), and it's a fun space to spend time in. We had fun watching netflix and playing with one of the guitars hanging on the walls (picks provided in a dish on the coffee table) while nibbling on thoughtfully provided candy and watching the dogs snore by our feet. Fun little space!"
4559985,25044557,2015-01-05,24740388,Lance,"This house was perfect for my fiance and two friends visiting from Oregon. The house/apt is cozy, functional and had all the comforts of home. We enjoyed the proximity to University District, and made for a nice escape from downtown where we've been staying for the past week. Picking a movie from the selection provided was fun (Stranger than Fiction) and the kitchen range-stove was very nice. We would book here again.  "
4559985,25971723,2015-01-31,26154484,Mike,"We were not pleased with our stay here and despite the fact that we have paid for 2 weeks we left after 1 week. The place was well equipped and generally comfortable. However, there was very minimal natural light (the apartment is almost all underground), and had very low ceilings which both contributed to a claustrophobic feeling. The living room did not even have a window. The kitchen was nice and all amenities were of good quality. To enter the apartment you must walk through a garage. The bathroom required a stool in order to be able to access the toilet. The host was not easily accessible (any time we called there was no answer and later she would send a message). Despite the fact that we only stayed for 1 week and paid for two, she would not discuss any refund options and she would not even talk to us on the phone! "
4559985,37828259,2015-07-11,11768882,Burton,"It was a pleasure to stay at Lisa's home! She was always quick and professional when she responded to my queries, which is something the helped me decide when choosing my accommodations. Myself and 3 others spent one night before two of us participated in the Seattle to Portland bike ride over the July 11th weekend. It was the perfect spot for the event as we were simply a few blocks from the start line. To anyone who does book at this home, take the parking instructions seriously. We knew parking was not allowed between 4-6pm but decided to anyways, just for 10 minutes to unload our stuff. When we were getting back into the vehicle, we saw the tow truck coming for us! They are FAST with enforcement. To be clear, this is a city enforcement issue, and has nothing to do with Lisa's booking requirements. If we ever need to stay in the area again, Lisa's home would be at the top of our list. Thanks Lisa!"
4559985,51691592,2015-10-24,33730268,Amornpun,"I really appreciate your house. It's well cared, clean and comfortable. Lisa provided us all necessary things. A location is very easy to travel around Seattle, especially going to UW. It is also near shopping center, market and restaurant.
Many thanks for being a good host & give us a great experience in Seattle."
8327124,54482383,2015-11-20,49087661,Tyler,"House was awesome.  Our expectations were high, and were met or exceeded in every regard.  Many thanks!"
6370655,39813413,2015-07-26,36362982,Chris,"Good location and very nice apartment and complex.  Stayed as a couple with our three-year-old, and while the apartment has two BRs, the master closet was spacious enough to allow us to set up a pack-and-play, making all of us feel even more at ease than had our son slept in the second BR.  Exceptionally convenient walk to Whole Foods, just up Westlake, which was great for outfitting the kitchen with provisions.  Proximity to Nordstrom, monorail and Pike's also great, but also on the edge of a transition neighborhood in one direction.  Nice kitchen w/ electric range; w/d in unit; good table w/ capable wireless router for remote work.  Parking garage available for $15/night.  In sum, a great stay.    "
6370655,41779332,2015-08-09,7615384,Huy,"Little bit of a problem checking in, but the building staff was very helpful in resolving it. Apartment itself was nice and exactly as pictured. Location was very good, about a mile or so from everything. "
8424532,50045185,2015-10-08,5581424,Maria,"The house was in amazing condition, very clean, and extremely spacious. There was 4 of us and we had plenty of space. We basically each had our own bathrooms. Also, we were very close to downtown Seattle, less than a 10 min drive in some cases. Joe was extremely accommodating and worked with us to make sure we had an easy reservation experience. I highly recommend staying here! "
8424532,52509483,2015-10-30,45623183,Sam,Beautiful quiet house. Great kitchen!
9849122,57468463,2015-12-26,50756968,Cyril,Joey and Faviola have been very friendly and nice hosts. They made us feel like at home. The room was exactly as expected. 
9849122,57597550,2015-12-27,27975104,Jason,Joey and Faviola were welcoming hosts. The bedroom was spacious and included a reliable space heater. We were encouraged to use their kitchen which was well-stocked with pots and pans. We very much enjoyed our short stay. 
1416279,13485336,2014-05-28,3925363,Sanchit,"This is a great apartment for 1-2 people who are looking for a good spot to stay in Capitol Hill. The apartment itself is very nicely stocked and decorated, and it has an amazing collection of books and records which means if you're up early/get back late at night there's always something to look forward to at home. It's a short bus ride to the major attractions in Seattle, or if it's nice weather it took me about 30-40 minutes to get to Pike Place and the Space Needle. It's also just around the corner to some good late night eats and drinks in Capitol Hill, including the best brewed coffee I tried in all of Seattle from the Espresso Vivace sidewalk bar, and a really great hot dog stand in front of the club Neighbors. Everything in the apartment was working well, and the host made sure to keep everything spotless and well stocked on our arrival.

If you're looking to visit Seattle and enjoy a more cozy and comfortable stay than your average hotel then this would be my top recommendation!"
1416279,13801704,2014-06-04,6991914,Niladri,"Really great vibe, particularly all the books and records to flick through (wish we had more time for it!). Bonus points for old fashioned clawfoot bathtub.

The location was ace too, walking distance to all the main downtown stuff, but in a very peaceful and characterful neighbourhood. It really made us feel part of the city.

If driving street parking is tough, but there are a number of paid lots nearby.

Cat is a great absentee hostess. Useful written guide, always responsive to our questions and the welcome coffee she left for us was to die for!"
1416279,13988714,2014-06-09,176393,Paul,"Cat was responsive and cordial--keys were easily accessible at the front door, info sheet was provided inside the apt."
1416279,14358987,2014-06-17,1099135,Sarah,"Cats house was a great choice for our Seattle stay.  Perfect for my boyfriend and I - plenty of space (probably more than we needed).  Unique home - probably could have spent our entire vacation looking at the book corner nook and looking at the interesting stickers, signs, posters, and art all over the house.  You can feel that the person that lives there loves their home, and  has made it their own.  

LOCATION LOCATION LOCATION! Shoot. PERFECT. It was our first time in Seattle, and we were not sure quite where to stay.  We were 2 blocks in 2 directions of tons of coffee, food, bars, stores, etc etc.  We walked almost everywhere (and rented bikes too!), and felt like the neighborhood had everything we could have needed.

Cat was very responsive both before, and during the trip.  The home was easy to find, and we had a little trouble getting in, but she was quick to answer my text/email for help.

The only thing I would change is that I wish we had stayed longer!"
1416279,14698151,2014-06-24,15724386,Akiko,"Lovely & spacious apartment with nice sunny windows, only a short walk away from nice shops and park. It was easy and quick communicating with Cat and she left a thorough and helpful guide to the apartment as well as tips on the neighborhood. Would highly recommend!"
1416279,14932568,2014-06-29,6213455,Katie,"Imagine you have a cool, older, punk rock sister who lives in Seattle and you're visiting her. That's how I would sum up my great stay at Cat's! The building is awesomely located and is either a longish walk or short Uber to downtown. Capitol Hill is a really cool neighborhood with lots of bars, restaurants, parks and shops within walking distance. I went for a run around Volunteer Park and had a pretty good breakfast at Arabica. 

The apartment is funky with all kinds of posters, knick knacks and well-loved furniture. I enjoyed the beer in the fridge, listening to records after work, and really liked the claw-foot bathtub.

Cat was a great host, very available via text and made sure I got in ok even though I arrived late. Very laid back but I felt like if I needed anything she'd be there to help me out. 

If you want a unique and (what felt like) authentic Seattle experience, this is a great pick. "
1416279,15425133,2014-07-08,15359918,Rosanna,"Cat's home was everything she advertised it to be -cosy, chilled and interesting. The bed was super comfy and the shower very powerful. She left great recommendations for loads of places all of which were great and made our trip really special. The neighbourhood was fun and lively and a 20 minute walk from Pike Market and the space needle. A great stay, would definitely come again, thanks Cat."
1416279,15680296,2014-07-14,5075917,Michael,"I have nothing but positive things to say about Cat’s place, and we will definitely check back in with her to see if it’s available the next time we’re in Seattle in September.  Communication was great and easy via text, check-in was easy via lock-box, and pretty much everything else was exactly as advertised.  Capitol Hill is the epicenter of everything cool in Seattle, and the apartment is located right in the most perfect part of the neighborhood.  It’s within walking distance to everything but sort of on a quiet side street among lots of other residential buildings.  The building is historic and very well maintained.  The apartment itself is really cool…tons of art, books, records, and an overall unique vibe.  It’s pretty clear that Cat cares about her place, and we instantly felt right at home.  Everything needed was provided – recommendations for bars, cafes, coffee, and other fun things to do; WiFi; good coffee; super comfy bed and couch; and a great shower.  I won’t spend much time here on what’s nearby, since you’ll get all of that on a handy info sheet, but a couple of favorites were Analog Coffee about a block away, Top Pot Doughnuts a few blocks away, Twice Sold Tales used book store (a super favorite), and tons of other places on Broadway.  The absolute best coffee, however, is at Stumptown Coffee on 12th immediately south of Seattle U (15 minute walk).  Speaking of walking, you can walk nearly everywhere from the apartment.  Pike-Pine is maybe 5-10 minutes, downtown is 15 minutes, Seattle U is 15 minutes, and great parks are also within 15 minutes or so.  Up and down Broadway are lots of bars, cafes, restaurants, shops…you’ll have no problem finding good times.  If you’re lucky on timing, you can catch a fun drag/celebrity impersonator show at Julia’s…we stumbled on it, and it was fun!  The last thing I’ll add is that Cat seems to be someone with whom you would definitely want to be friends.  Enjoy this place…it’s fantastic!  "
1416279,16147215,2014-07-22,5815632,Ryan,"Cat was a great host, communicated early and well, with follow-ups to make sure we were ok. 

Cat's place was great. We were there for a music concert and the turntable got some great use after we hit Capitol Hill record shopping. Comfortable bed, great shower and a really nice feel to the place. 

The location is superb, just off Broadway and walking distance to Capitol Hill - downtown isn't that far is you're a walker. "
1416279,16558279,2014-07-29,11728906,Lauren,"I had a wonderful time at Cat's apartment.  She was always reachable and very sweet.  This is apartment is funky, unique and very cool.  Not your normal cookie cutter - very artsy.  My sister stayed with me and absolutely loved it as well.  The location is perfect - right near Broadway - where all the cool restaurants and shops are.  Can't say enough good things!"
1416279,17357844,2014-08-11,17295575,Sara,"Had a great weekend in Seattle! Cat's place was great, convenient and close to everything. Getting in and out was fairly easy and she gives you a very detailed guide on the apartment. "
1416279,18873517,2014-09-02,14080341,Josh,"Cat was a great host. She has a manual listing details on the use of the apartment. She also let me know promptly the lockbox combination and would always email me quickly.

The apartment is in a great part of town. Very quick walk to the heart of Capitol Hill and easy access to nearby bus lines.

The apartment itself is comfortable though interestingly decorated. Not sure I would recommend anyone travelling with a child to stay here though I assume Cat would point that out also. The bathroom is a bit dark and the sink and shower are a bit finicky. The apartment also does not have central air so you're a bit at the mercy of the temperature outside."
1416279,20010579,2014-09-22,5075917,Michael,"This was our second stay at Cat’s place, and I can happily recommend her apartment just as enthusiastically as I did in a previous review back in June (please see that review for details).  Everything about Cat’s apartment is simply perfect:  great location on quiet street right in the middle of Capitol Hill, tons of cool places to grab a bite, lots of interesting shops, great coffee, lots of bars, etc.  I’m pretty sure you’ll find whatever you want or need easily within walking distance.  Even Westlake station is within walking distance  at maybe 15-20 minutes.  As for the apartment itself, it’s a unique gem:  super clean, artsy, interesting décor, tons of books/records to enjoy, quiet building, and a historically cool building as well.  You can’t do better than this anywhere in Capitol Hill in my opinion, and the price is certainly right.  I will always check in with Cat to see if her apartment is available every time we’re planning a visit in the future.  Thanks so much to Cat for another great stay!!!"
1416279,20824638,2014-10-06,19880650,Dmytro,"This was my first airbnb experience and it went just great! 
The main thing about this place is location. I really think this is the best location you can get in Seattle, because it's close to everything (including downtown), it's very walkable and at the same time it's on the quiet street with nice greenery behind the window. There are tons of great inexpensive bars and restaurants within 5 to 10 minutes walking from this place. I literally fell in love with Capitol Hill. The apartments itself are warm and cozy, just as described on pictures.

We didn't meet with Cat, but she left detailed instructions and personal hello letter to me. She also responded to my messages quickly and even helped me to get permanent housing by making a phone call to background check company! Thanks, Cat!"
1416279,27804118,2015-03-12,26604365,Gabrielle,"Cat's is a great place to stay. She is a good host, very accommodating, kind, and easy to communicate with. The apartment is comfortable, interesting, and has everything I needed. The location is really good for getting around the Capitol Hill area. I would definitely recommend it, and will stay again if I get the chance. "
1416279,29498589,2015-04-08,5075917,Michael,"We have stayed at Cat's place on several occasions now, and I simply cannot think of a better lodging option anywhere in the city.  If you are interested in an authentic Seattle neighborhood where you can ""live like a local"" during your visit, then this super clean and nicely situated apartment is a most fantastic find.  Like Capitol Hill itself, Cat's place is a wonderful and thoughtful mix of cool and interesting things.  Very artsy...we love it.  Cat is a warm, thoughtful, and genuine person (and host), and I very much appreciate her kindness in sharing her space.  Highest of recommendations all the way around!!!

"
1416279,32140216,2015-05-14,18674171,Lisa,"We didn't get to meet Cat but liked her anyway! A key left in the lockbox made for an easy check in and out. The apartment was clean, cute and conveniently located in a great neighborhood. Plus, Cat leaves a list of suggestions for places to go and things to do, which is always nice for someone who doesn't know the city. Thanks Cat, it was great!"
1416279,32603892,2015-05-19,7613463,Sarah,"Cat's apartment was just what we needed for our trip to Seattle.  A friend of mine and I stayed for the weekend and Cat made it very easy to check in and out, left detailed notes for checkout and any quarks about the apartment so we didn't need to reach out with any additional questions.  There were plenty of bars, shows and entertainment nearby, so we didn't have to go far to get a good meal or to see the more touristy side of Seattle.  Thanks for sharing your home with us Cat!"
1416279,35123296,2015-06-15,7876478,Allison,"Cat was a great host! My fiance and I loved staying at her place. The  in and out process was super easy, she had easy instructions and great  neighborhood suggestions.  The apartment and location really let you get a true feel of being a local in Seattle.  Everything you need is in walking distance and we had a blast exploring Cap Hill.  Thanks Cat for a truly cool experience.  "
1416279,36558773,2015-06-29,34113526,Marlene,"Cat was great; very efficient, informative and responsive to our questions. Renting from her was easy and low-stress."
1416279,39198979,2015-07-21,4525467,Ron,"It's a cool, clean, and comfortable apartment in a great spot. It had everything we needed and Cat's guide was a big help. Highly recommended!"
1416279,41000138,2015-08-03,1567994,Suzie,"Cat's apartment was in a great location on Capitol Hill. Check in was easy. She also had some coffee and a few thee goodies left for our stay! The bed was comfortable and the apartment had a very unique, cozy feel to it. We didn't interact with Cat while we were in town, but she does have a nice list of suggested restaurants, bars, etc you can visit "
1416279,41970149,2015-08-10,30777435,Will,"Kat was a fantastic host. After my own mistake in not realizing the  check in time, Kat accommodated both letting us drop off our bags in advance and with checking in earlier. Her guidebook was extremely handy in finding local spots to eat at and check out, as well as to walk us through everything about the apartment. She left us a few beers and a delicious mango sorbet which was a great treat on the few hot days during our week long stay. We had one minor issue with the WiFi and she promptly got it fixed. Couldn't have hoped for a better experience, would highly recommend Kat to anyone looking to stay in Seattle."
1416279,44167470,2015-08-24,39534801,Karen,"Cat was a fantastic and warm host!  While I didn’t get to meet her in person, she was highly responsive to messages and made sure someone was available to check me in and give me a tour.  Her place is so charming and exactly as pictured, and it’s in a great location on Capitol Hill near many restaurants and nightlife.  On top of it all, she even left me a local treat to enjoy upon my arrival.  Many thanks to Cat for a wonderful stay in Seattle!"
1416279,44814436,2015-08-29,205285,Andrea,"The apt was lovely, with a true home feel. It is centrally located and perfect for a short visit. "
1416279,45493580,2015-09-03,40435242,Dag,We had a very pleasant stay at Cat's apartment. The apartment have everything needed to make you feel at home as if you were a resident of Capitol Hill. The image that will remain with us for a long time is the green foliage of the tree outside the living room window filtering sunlight into the apartment and providing a sense of being in nature in the middle of the city. Dag and Berit Amalie
1416279,46000330,2015-09-07,40847227,Molina,"It is a nice apartment. We like it. When we met problems, cat will help us to solve it soon. "
1416279,46427721,2015-09-10,4352169,Todd,"Everything was great at Cat's place. Really cozy, bright, cheerful and fun to stay there. She made it really easy, and had the place ready for us a few hours before check-in, so that was nice. Parking was a bear as she describes, but Seattle has plenty of great public transit, so i'll rethink it next time. Enjoyed exploring her picks for food and drink in the area."
5948003,30114093,2015-04-17,31174873,Randy,"This was such a great experience. Nicolas is an incredible host, it felt like staying with an old friend. The best. The room was incredibly quiet and really comfortable, the TV was a nice touch too and great coffee and breakfast in the morning. I wish I could have stayed longer and really taken in the awesome view from the balcony. Thanks for an awesome introduction to Seattle."
5948003,30357113,2015-04-20,31151861,Akarsh,Nicolas and his girlfriend were wonderful hosts and I definitely recommend them to anyone looking at this listing. They know the surrounding area very well and they're flexible with timings.
5948003,30826460,2015-04-27,24739322,Aaron,Great place with a great view! The room was very comfortable and I would definitely recommend it to friends!
5948003,31926516,2015-05-11,31495572,Yan,"The picture of the balcony view is totally an understatement. I was astonished when I see it with my own eyes. It's breath taking. The room is quiet and cozy. The bed is comfortable. Traffic is very convenient. 
Nikolas and his girlfriend are super nice. Good introduction and advises were given for my city tour. It's definitely an experience to remember. If you are visiting Seattle like myself, I would strongly recommend Nicolas's place."
5948003,32149306,2015-05-14,24461623,Fanny," Nicolas is a really nice host! He was very friendly and accomodating.
 The room is cosy, quiet and the bed was very comfortable. 
A biutiful place with a great view of Seatle on the balcony,  near stores, bus lines. You can walking to the downtown along the sea :)
 We recommend him with a great view!

"
5948003,32293694,2015-05-16,11490134,Trinidad,"Nicolas was really helpful with us and our trip and also very friendly. His place is in a very good location, grocery stores and public transportation within a few blocks. His girlfriend was also very friendly! Thanks for everything. "
5948003,32998305,2015-05-24,31349977,Manit Singh,"Nicolas' place was more than homely. I really felt very comfortable there. And Nicolas was a great host and always helped me out with queries about the city. The place is in a really nice location, wonderful view and very peaceful."
5948003,33299205,2015-05-26,17137082,Thuy,"Nicolas is an awesome host, super friendly and helpful. He made me feel at home. The location is close to transportation (D line goes straight to downtown in 10 - 15 mins). The place is what advertised and more (indeed, the apartment is more spacious than it seems in the picture with very nice views from the balcony). I would totally suggest this airbnb to anyone visiting Seattle."
5948003,33702348,2015-05-31,7299785,David,"Nice space, friendly host."
5948003,34020197,2015-06-03,27843635,Keren,"We had a very pleasant experience on our recent visit to Seattle.  The accommodation was as advertised, in a quiet neighborhood with easy access to public transport.  Nicolas and Mozelle were very welcoming, hospitable, informative and interesting to talk to."
5948003,34206304,2015-06-06,31255412,Ian,"Nicolas was a very good host. He was very flexible with arranging check-in / check-out. He also very generously shared meals with me and we had some great conversation. 

The room was very spacious and newly renovated with all the necessary amenities. The location for the place was very convenient for sightseeing various parts of Seattle. "
5948003,35305896,2015-06-17,32261846,Cathy,"Nicolas was a fabulous host! The amenities in the room were well thought out and the room was very comfortable. The view from his balcony is awe inspiring. Nicolas had information available about the area, plus he was prompt in responding to emails and keeping info when I was out and about. He is a wonderful cook and kindly made breakfast for me on my last day. I will recommend to all my friends that they stay here when they are in Seattle!"
5948003,35603371,2015-06-20,562323,Fernando,"Nicolas and was great and very friendly! I stayed with a friend in the room which was very comfortable, spacious and had everything we needed. The neighborhood is very nice and quiet with a great view! Like other have said, there is no bars or restaurants in walking distance, but the bus stop is and downtown is just 20min away on it (Nicolas even provided some orca passes for the bus so we didn't have to buy new ones for our short trip) Just a great place and a great host in Seattle!"
5948003,36022636,2015-06-24,753818,Wesley,"This is a beautiful, quiet spot with the most spectacular view from the private balcony! I was hosting a guest from out of town, and booked this room for her to stay in - she was thrilled! It's a bit far away from any bars or restaurants, so don't expect to walk around the corner to anything nearby (though there is a Whole Foods that fairly easy to walk to), but if you are looking for a delightful place to call ""home"" after a long day in Seattle - this is definitely it. Thanks to Nicolas for his amazing hospitality. My guest felt right at home here."
5948003,36248684,2015-06-26,35891446,Mathew,Nicolas is an amazing host who makes you feel at ease to be in a new place. We had a lot of fun talking to him about our lives and he truly made his home our home. His place is in a very nice area and the apartment/room itself is beautiful. Getting downtown was made very simple and fast by the help Nicolas provided. Recommend to anyone looking to have a pleasant stay in Seattle. 
5948003,36623820,2015-06-29,36531234,Kat,"Nicolas was a great host! This was our first Airbnb experience and it was awesome. His home is exactly as described. Wonderful views of the city and quiet. We were so busy running around and didn't get to experience the pool, our only regret! Thank you Nicolas for being a friendly, helpful, and welcoming host!"
5948003,36821703,2015-07-01,35449197,Lukas,Nicolas is a great host. And his hospitality is above maximum! It was a a perfect stay for me in Seattle. The apartment and the guest room are really comfy. The public transportation (Bus) is really near and it takes around 10 minutes to downtown. Nice!
5948003,37149597,2015-07-05,31243329,Corey,Nicolas was a great host. I was sort of a ghost but that was my plan going in. The room was clean and everything I could possibly need was offered. Thanks for a great experience
5948003,37670867,2015-07-09,35163964,Sukhi,"Nicolas was an amazing host. This was our first Airbnb experience and it was good. His apartment is exactly as described with a wonderful view of the city from balcony and quiet. The place is close to downtown so if you are there just to tour the city. Access to public transportation via D line, makes it easy and fairly cheap to travel. Nicolas offered to cook us breakfast in the morning, which was nice. The room was clean and clean bed sheets and towels were provided. Whole foods is at walk distance. Thank you Nicolas for being a friendly, helpful, and welcoming host!"
5948003,38278920,2015-07-14,33999367,Shouning,"The location is great, easy access to all the places that I was planning to be. The apartment is nice and clean with a exellent view indeed! Free and convinient parking. Host is very helpful and accommodating. The best thing is great Wifi access and even netflex, although i don't have much time to watch TV. I had a pleasant stay."
5948003,38593388,2015-07-17,13497562,Sydney And Damian,"My husband and I decided to return to Seattle to celebrate our anniversary and go on many adventures for the two weeks we would be there.  We needed a comfortable and affordable place to stay.  We found Nicolas' place and fell in love with the description and the photos.  Nicolas was quite accommodating to our needs and we were able to split our stay.  We stayed 3 nights when we first arrived, we went adventuring to the many national parks and amazing sites the Pacific Northwest has to offer, and then returned for the final 3 nights.   When we arrived, Nicolas made sure we very comfortable.  We were absolutely exhausted and actually slept 14 hours!  Nicolas' home is exactly what he advertises:  quiet!  We loved meeting Nicolas and loved exploring our favorite spots for a few days before we took off for the mountains.  Our first morning in Seattle, we awoke, made coffee, and then sat outside on the deck.  What a fabulous way to reconnect with our adopted home city.  You will love the view and you will love Nicolas!  "
5948003,39029148,2015-07-20,35353746,Kent,We had an excellent stay. Nicholas  was a gracious host and made sure we had everything we needed including sharing hi freezer with us. We will be back!
5948003,39249559,2015-07-21,36549964,Kelsey,Great quick stay! Nicolas even provides a bus pass so you don't have to have exact change for the bus
5948003,39273323,2015-07-22,31843441,Fabien,"Chambre propre et fidèle à la description.
Bus à 5 minutes de marche."
5948003,39747016,2015-07-26,13497562,Sydney And Damian,"Nicolas was an absolutely wonderful host!  This is our second Airbnb experience and it was exactly what we had hoped for.  We returned to Seattle to celebrate our anniversary and needed a nice quiet space to rest and sleep between our adventures.  All of the amenities were perfect, from the coffee (and a hot water kettle) to the fan to the soft and comfy bedding.  He provided us with a parking spot, keys to his home so we could come and go as we needed, and we had full use of the kitchen and washer and dryer.  Even though we didn't have time to watch television, there was one in our room complete with Netflix and other movie options.  We weren't able to use the pool, but would have had we not run off on so many adventures.  Nicolas' home is a short walk to the D line bus and the Whole Foods, a short drive or walk to Kerry Park and other Queen Anne shops (Trader Joes, Safeway, etc...).  We felt very comfortable with Nicolas and he accommodated us for every need.  The view from his patio is gorgeous and I will miss it for a long time.  My husband and I hope to move to Seattle someday, but until then, on hopefully frequent visits, we will want to stay with Nicolas.  He is an exceptional host, a wonderful conversationalist, and a very kind man.  "
5948003,40528262,2015-07-31,15645773,Paul,"Nicolas is a wonderful host, showing us how to catch RapidRide D bus and use lyft to get around.  He also provided orca bus cards, tour book and extra pillows for comfort.  On a late evening, when my wife wanted to boil some ramen noodles, Nicolas lit up candle at the balcony with scenic harbor view, a romantic moment during our 5-night stay.  Lastly, Nicolas' airbnb rate is terrific for Seattle area with outrageous hotel rates."
5948003,41073550,2015-08-04,19597748,Chris,"I was in Seattle for a long weekend to go to a wedding and Nicolas's place was perfect. I wasn't at the apartment long enough to get to talk with him much, but he was very welcoming when I first arrived. The room is very comfortable and also right by the front door, so you don't feel like you'll disturb anyone if you're coming in late or leaving early. It was very easy to get downtown on public transportation. Wish I had more time to enjoy the view from the balcony!"
5948003,41980692,2015-08-10,17732692,Mitchel,Nicolas was an extremely good host. He made sure everything was in order as soon as I arrived and the room was very nice with anything you could have wanted.
5948003,42428744,2015-08-13,38523491,Paolo,"Nicolas was a very nice and helpful host. The room was perfect: clean, comfortable and everything was as described. 
Many thanks for having me!!"
5948003,43079151,2015-08-17,30451534,Yifang,"Stayed four nights in Nicolas's place. The place was quite, clean and close to downtown. Wifi worked (website hidden) with Netflix and Amazon Prime was a plus. Nicolas and Nana were a lovely and friendly couple. It's a wonderful stay in Seattle. "
5948003,47648454,2015-09-21,17484001,Kristen,"We stayed with Nicolas for our first month after moving to Seattle, and we are very thankful to have the pleasure of staying with him.  The room and bathroom are in excellent condition, he has very nice cookware, and .  The apartment is a short walk from Whole Foods and easy bus ride to both downtown and Ballard.  That picture from the balcony isn't photoshopped, it provides a truly awesome view of the city.

Nicolaus is super tech savy and extremely environmentally conscious, making his place an interesting (in a good way!) place to stay.  He's constantly looking for ways to improve his guests' experience, and he actually bought a new bed for the guest room while we were there, turning a good sleeping situation into a fantastic one.  We shared several meals (he cooked for us a few times, and we returned the favor) and enjoyed hours of conversation.  He has a great sense of humor, is as exceptionally easy going, and we 100% recommend staying with him!  "
6183330,42340058,2015-08-12,3832615,Lorna,"The cabin was absolutely perfect! We felt so welcomed by Jessica and Jake, and the best surprise of all were the best play friends our two little girls could have.  The backyard had a basketball court, play cabin, hammock, and outside eating area, we pretty much spent most of the afternoons hanging out to watch the kids play. The cabin had everything we needed, a full kitchen to make breakfast and dinner, bathroom with fresh towels, we even had a bottle of wine for the adults  and milk and juice for the kids upon arriving.  Our location was central to everything, 12 minutes to downtown Seattle, and 20-30 minutes as we explored the surrounding towns. Incredibly diverse neighborhood with the best local restaurants. Go for a walk to get coffee, fresh fruits, corn, and snow ones. 
a couple of blocks away is a great park and community garden. Make sure you hit up the recommended places to eat and explore on the host's list! 
Part of me wish I could keep this secret, but it's too cool of a place to not share."
6183330,43141046,2015-08-17,34990838,Peter,"The location is perfect. 5 minutes to anything you want to see in Seattle. And the place is very cute, decorated tastefully and beautifully done. The hosts were wonderful and even allowed us to do our laundry in their garage washer/dryer. Only two small areas for improvement. The second bed in the loft may be difficult to get to for some people as you need to climb a ladder and the clearance in the loft ranges between 2 and 4 feet, so you have to crawl to the bed. the loft is better for kids or for younger adults. My only complaint is that there was no thermostat I could find, so if you stay in the summer or winter months it might get a little hot or cold. We stayed in August and the downstairs was fine, but the loft got a bit toasty. Still, all in all, the price for this location is great. And the hosts are very accommodating--they even left us a bottle of wine and some gift pens for the kids!"
6183330,44007684,2015-08-23,26011984,Rashree,"Jessica was extremely hospitable and very generous with the amenities/treats in the cabin (fresh ground coffee, wine, juice, etc).  The photos are a true representation of the space but the cabin is far more charming in real life.  Absolutely wonderful! The location is ideal for easy access to freeways/city center, trendy neighborhoods, food, shops and more.  I worked in downtown Seattle much of my stay so coming back to a quiet, comfy, and easily accessible place was awesome.  My husband and daughter ended up joining me for the last part of my stay and it suited all of us very well.  I will definitely be back!"
6183330,44694319,2015-08-28,20292013,Peggie,"The log cabin was a perfect space for my short vacation in Seattle and Jessica was a fabulous host. She clearly communicated a wealth of information about the cabin, left a bottle of welcome wine, and provided several excellent recommendations for nearby restaurants, The cabin was very cozy, both the airport and central Seattle were easily accessible by public transportation, and it was close to a beautiful park, several restaurants, and a fantastic produce stand. I hope to be back soon!"
6183330,45140148,2015-08-31,27654974,Igor,The cabin was close to downtown and nicely decorated. Jessica was hospitable and left us a bottle of wine. Thank you Jessica. It might be difficult for tall people to get in and out of the bedroom located on the second floor wich has low ceilings.
6183330,45846073,2015-09-06,31228622,Nick,"Jess' log cabin was exceptional. It was exactly as pictured and full of awesome quirks.  Jessica and her family were super welcoming and offered helpful tips whenever needed.  The cabin came complete with a bottle of wine and a couple of chocolates.  Also included was a helpful guide with nearby restaurants and transportation suggestions. 

A word about the loft.  Im 6ft and couldnt stand up in the loft/bedroom (had to army crawl to the bed essentially), but the space is so unique and comfortable that it was only a minor consideration. If you aren't super mobile or just super tall, you might want to take this into consideration.  Otherwise this place is awesome.  Highly Highly recommend.  "
6183330,46237633,2015-09-08,41518817,Alex,"Really nice apartment, great location for us to get about. Jessica was really understanding after I lost the keys (sorry again) I would recommend anyone to stay here. "
6183330,46914665,2015-09-14,6598679,Owen,"The place was great and Jessica was very
Helpful!! But if you're over 6' tall it may be a problem.  I'm personally 6'6 and couldn't fit upstairs but that's not Jess's problem!  Would definitely encourage people to stay there."
6183330,47992050,2015-09-22,41427019,Craig,"We were very excited to stay here. The house was nice and clean and there was a very helpful list of places in the area we may be interested in. One of the bars on the list had one of the best beers I had on the whole trip!

It was very easy to find and convenient to park and walk to. There was no noise and we were very comfortable. We are very happy with our stay."
6183330,50307756,2015-10-11,35750320,Jerica,The cabin was clean and equipped with a lot of amenities. The fireplace was perfect for the cold! We all loved the binder of nearby places/things to do.
6183330,51123760,2015-10-18,40751616,Danny,"The description was very accurate and the neighborhood was a very nice area of Seattle and close to many things (especially Downtown, the stadiums, and Pike Place Market). Jessica made us feel very welcome and her instructions were thorough and we had no problems with our stay whatsoever. "
6183330,51970041,2015-10-25,31140907,Emily,"This place is adorable. I had a very great stay, and there is nothing that is not provided! The kitchen was full of alliances, they even provided non-toxic shampoo, and the fireplace was a wonderful touch to it all to keep it nice and cozy. "
6183330,52515985,2015-10-30,45929918,Sven,"The ""cabin"" is great.  My wife and son and I had a great time.  There was plenty of room for our little guy to explore and having access to the yard was definitely a bonus.  Everything about the cabin beats staying in a hotel.  Super convenient location to downtown and airport.  Lots of fun exploring the food forest, and local produce market.  Full kitchen and bath.  And a fireplace to cozy up next to after a long day!

We'll definitely be back."
6183330,52736773,2015-11-01,2521861,Lauren,"We had a great time staying at the Log Cabin! There is a great park nearby and an easy walk to a few different neighborhoods to find good food and drink. With Jessica's directions, the cabin was easy to find and the check in/out process was simple. "
6183330,53967353,2015-11-15,39826811,Kevin,"We had a wonderful time staying at Jessica's log cabin. The cabin itself is cozy, comfortable, and is a great location when venturing out in Seattle. The top floor/bedroom/attic is definitely low hanging and a little hard to get around in if you're tall, but it's primarily used for sleeping and is comfortable when it comes to sleep. The appliances and cookware are fantastic, and even though the yard is shared it feels private. If I had a friend visiting Seattle, I'd recommend staying here. "
6183330,55832053,2015-12-06,15738388,David,This was a great little log cabin and Jessica was also in contact with me and she was only a text or a ring away. I got to play with her dog and Kitten. The cabin had all the amenities that you would needed! Thanks for the great clean cabin and I will be back next time im in Seattle!
3793185,17193763,2014-08-08,16757741,Jamison,Ali was a great host.  He was accommodating and flexible given my late arrival.  I had clean linens and a clean bathroom.  He respected my privacy and was quiet.  I would stay there again. 
3793185,17800390,2014-08-17,19171620,Lloyd,"Ali was there to greet me, sweet guy. The apt exceeded my expectations, nice building, very clean, great view, comfortable bed, awesome location can't beat it very central. Odds are I'll book it again soon-!  Thx Ali "
3793185,17973505,2014-08-19,17797757,Jon,"Ali was a very accommodating and hospitable host. He was very communicative throughout our stay with just a short text message away. The place was already very beautiful, and Ali's hospitality made for an overall wonderful stay. I would definitely recommend this place to others. "
3793185,18275350,2014-08-24,19897503,Jocelyn,"Ali's place was great.  Amazing view, even better than the pictures make it look.   The apartment was very clean and comfortable.  Ali was incredibly helpful and made me feel welcome.  Highly recommended.  "
3793185,18569297,2014-08-28,147218,Daniel,"A great, central and safe ocation. Walking distance to major attractions and the waterfront. The building is brand new. The apartment is immaculate and comfortable. Excellent concierge service in the building. We were able to leave and retrieve luggage on our day of departure so we could tour around. "
3793185,18639140,2014-08-29,19690960,Robbie,Ali was great and the apartment was great. Better view and place than expected and everything went smoothly. Within walking distance of almost anything we did in the city. 
3793185,19826627,2014-09-19,3538520,Ran,"I had the pleasure of staying in Ali's apartment for 3 weeks. The apartment is the best you can ask for. The building is super fancy & you have access to all amenities (public areas, gym, etc.). The apartment is  located in a walking distance from both downtown Seattle and Capitol Hill. 

Ali was always available and willing to help with any request and I had full privacy during my stay. Couldn't ask for more... :)"
3793185,20158148,2014-09-24,20901001,Gary,Ali was an excellent host.  Arrangements went smoothly.  He checked in with me upon arrival and oriented me to his neighborhood.  Beautiful new building and clean.  Great view 
3793185,21524415,2014-10-19,1645195,Elizabeth,"It was a wonderful space!  Great views, comfortable and walking distance from the Seattle Center and the Market.   I would stay here again!"
3793185,21856655,2014-10-25,4719234,Lu,"Ali's place is great and centrally located. He was very accommodating in terms of checking in /out times along with flexibility during booking. I would 1000% recommend this place, and if in town, will stay here again.  "
3793185,22549039,2014-11-09,21427738,Berkeley,"Ali was great! He made us feel very at home, and gave us as much/as little space as we wanted. His place is very clean and the location is as central as it gets. "
3793185,24509104,2014-12-29,24957694,David,We had a great  stay at Ali's place.  A beautiful view of the Space Needle from both the living room and the bedroom.  We were able to walk everywhere we wanted to go and there is a Whole Foods store just a couple of blocks away.
3793185,24785718,2015-01-02,24825152,Connie,"Great location, walking distance to all the cool spots in Seattle including downtown, Pike's Place and Space Needle. Lots of great dining options in the area. "
3793185,28226123,2015-03-20,2259758,Catherine & Micki,"Ali's apartment was the perfect place to spend my week while I was visiting Seattle for work. It's conveniently located walking distance to downtown, Pike's Place Market, and shopping. Ali was super easy to communicate with and fast respond. "
3793185,28433517,2015-03-23,16392443,Cristina,"Ali was a wonderful host. He was prompt with replying to messages and was willing to work with our check-in/out times. We actually met him on our last day as we were leaving and he was very polite. We would definitely stay with Ali again! :)

The listing was exactly as pictured and described. The view is fantastic with a direct view of the Space Needle from all windows. The neighborhood was good. There was a bit of construction going on, but we did not have a car to park on the street so it was not a big deal. We walked everywhere in the city. Pike Place, the Space Needle, and all of the museums are nearby."
3793185,28740619,2015-03-29,125427,Yves,"I didn't get to meet Ali in person, but everything was taken care of over the phone and professional manner.

Super easy and laid back checking in and out."
3793185,33576928,2015-05-30,29515743,Meredith,"Ali was super flexible with our check-in and check-out times, which was a huge bonus for us. His place was the perfect size for 1-2 guests and the bathroom was nice and spacious. The view absolutely cannot be beat and the location was perfect for hitting up all the areas we wanted to visit while in Seattle. When things weren't within walking distance, a $7-20 Uber ride was utilized and totally reasonable."
3793185,35084450,2015-06-15,1028195,Michael,Ali's apartment was a perfect fit for my family during the weekend. The location was convenient for our activities around town and the view of the Puget Sound and mountains was a great backdrop.
3793185,35789473,2015-06-22,31292301,Robert,"Ali was very helpful in giving us guidance about parking in the area, and he was very attentive to our texts and calls when we were making arrangements.  The place was perfect for us, and the location is right in the heart of downtown shopping and Pike's Market.  "
3793185,37751793,2015-07-10,2104411,Sarah,Ali was very responsive to our needs. Check in was easy and convenient. The place was exactly as described - clean and organized. I would definitely book again!
3793185,39651543,2015-07-25,7388089,Melissa,"Ali's apartment was in a great location. It was very clean and provided what we needed - a home base while we were out exploring the city. He was also very helpful with recommendations for transportation from the airport as well as restaurant suggestions. He went out of his way to help us store luggage for several hours after check out as well since we had a late flight. Thanks, Ali!"
3793185,40751681,2015-08-02,3725751,Anjali,"Ali was a great host - he was nice, easy to communicate with, and answered our questions promptly. He also suggested we take a train vs. cab to get to his apartment from the airport, which saved us a about 40 bucks. The apartment was clean and comfortable, with a beautiful view of the city and the space needle. It's also in a great location - walkable to all the major attractions in the downtown Seattle. We'd definitely stay here again! "
3793185,41736202,2015-08-09,31037004,Jacob,"Ali's place is very nice and cozy. He was very flexible with check-in and check-out times to suit our needs and was very responsive to our messages. The apartment is in a great location, right between Downtown and the Seattle Center, so walking is always an option."
3793185,43508620,2015-08-20,23671393,Mandy,"We had a pleasant stay, everything was as described and the view from the living room was amazing! "
7843145,52770100,2015-11-01,43494453,Paula,"Our friends and I had a great time. The location of the house was convenient for our Halloween plans. The house was clean and had a great setup, as well as the hot tub being extremely comfortable."
7843145,53699656,2015-11-11,9036366,Sarah,"Carla's home was so comfortable and the hot tub was fantastic. She was available quickly to inquire about booking and sent all the info we needed to make our stay go smoothly. The bed was a dream, I couldn't wait to get into it at night after a super relaxing soak in the hot tub. Very clean home. The neighborhood was close in driving distance to shops and restaurants, and home is on a quiet residential street with other nice homes. "
7843145,55853330,2015-12-06,30178691,Julie,"Carla was very prompt communicating with me and was flexible with our check-out time. Her home was wonderful; clean, great location, safe, warm, comfortable, perfect for our needs.  The hot tub was enticing but unfortunately we weren't able to fit it into our schedule.  I would definiitely stay here again and highly recommend Carla's home. "
7843145,56231861,2015-12-10,20620594,Tara,Carla was very welcoming and was available via text for questions that we had. it was easy to find and easy to get in and overall just an easy and nice (website hidden) was a wonderful stay!
7843145,56955930,2015-12-20,12586729,Katie,Our stay was lovely! It was easy to find and close to everything! I love that it was decorated for the holidays. The listed in exactly as described: beds are comfy and hot tub is nice & toasty. Carla was easy to get a hold of for any questions. I would definitely stay here again. 
3552523,15735388,2014-07-14,17898959,Lary,"Amazing experience! Gene is the consummate host; very knowledgeable about the city, fantastic accomodations with all the bells and whistles. My company paid for most of my stay in Seattle where I moved over to a four star hotel nearby. I preferred Gene's place. Great views, very central, very comfortable. Can't recommend strongly enough! We'll be back. :)"
3552523,15944833,2014-07-18,7745667,Ben,"Gene's place was fantastic! Great location, view and one of the most comfortable beds I've ever slept on. The breakfast was very nice too. And Gene himself is a pro - you can tell he has very high standards and maintains those for his guests as well. Great guy to gab with as well, very sharp. The details provided for his listing were very specific; I appreciated that."
3552523,15993820,2014-07-19,2546189,Terrie,There is no exaggerating how convenient this location is for exploring the Pioneer Square area. It was easy to park right in front and pay for 8 am-10 am parking for the next day for a little more sleep. We got in late and thank Gene for being so accommodating and setting up the room in such a comfy way. The bedroom ceiling fan made air conditioning unnecessary and we slept very well. We fall a little more in love with Seattle after each visit and airbnb hosts like this encourage us to return.
3552523,16038323,2014-07-20,17345223,Sarah,"Truly this is the perfect place to stay if you are coming to see Seattle. The apartment is situated at the top of a steep hill (so bring your tennis shoes!) which results in a fantastic view of the city & the water beyond it. This apartment was really like coming home, and we felt at home.

...and the bed...I would be remiss if I did not mention that it was simply the most comfortable bed I have ever slept in. Which brings up two questions: what is it and where can I get it? Including the head/foot board- I want it all. Seriously. Must. Find."
3552523,16153305,2014-07-22,17873490,Shaila,"Pretty good first time AirBnB experience. The accommodations were as described, nice and clean with a good view. (I suspect this location would be great for folks wanting to see Seahawk or Mariners games.) Gene is very quick with communication, so if you have any questions, he will get back to you in minutes. Parking was easy and there are many options for those who drive. I would stay here again or recommend it to anyone looking for a place in Seattle. "
3552523,16171944,2014-07-22,8495239,Max,"Gene was a fantastic host - he was patient with all my questions before and after we booked the room. The place itself was beautiful with amazing views, clean sheets and pastries! 

Thanks for making my first airbnb experience such a pleasant one!"
3552523,16272329,2014-07-24,18023865,Hugh,"One of the best things was location. It house is within walking distance from a major tram and bus stop which connects to their airport, Greyhound bus station and downtown. Gene was a great host - I arrived earlier in the day into Seattle and was able to leave my bag at the house without any problems. I was given a key and shown the room. Gene even was happy to take me to the airport the next morning. Overall a great stay."
3552523,16369973,2014-07-26,17944658,Jason,"Great apartment and Gene was super nice! He picked us up, gave us lots of tips on the city and the location was fantastic. Thank you Gene!"
3552523,16578217,2014-07-29,17995180,Annet,"Vooraf een goed contact per mail. Goede beschrijving gekregen hoe van het vliegveld naar het adres te komen. De lightrail heeft een halte dichtbij het adres, maar 2-3 bloks lopen."
3552523,16632895,2014-07-30,4088399,Undisclosed,"Everything was accurate. Beautiful room, with a gorgeous view. Apart from the noise of the city, everything was perfect."
3552523,19507263,2014-09-13,16120653,Viktoria,The reservation was canceled 15 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
3552523,19577342,2014-09-14,6743125,Stephanie,"What a great location! Beautiful, clean apartment in a lovely building just 4 blocks from King Street Station. Gene was so easy to work with. I will absolutely try to stay here again!"
3552523,19663322,2014-09-15,15771651,Azadeh,"I got there late and left early in the morning, so I didn't experience living there much but it was very clean both bedroom and bathroom!
Everything looked like photoes.
Gene was out of the country but she was very helpful and responsive when I had problem in booking the place although she was in different time zone.
As she was away she put me in contact with her assistant there and she was also very responsive and everything was according to instructions."
3552523,19777702,2014-09-18,1209497,Laura,Loved the room and the rest of the apartment. The windows in our bedroom provided a wonderful view of downtown and the harbor. The apartment was very comfortable and everything was sparkly clean!  Dex was out of the country but his friendly associate helped with everything we needed.  Would love to stay here again.
3552523,19825497,2014-09-19,146122,Jiuyu,"We didn't have the chance to meet Gene, but the communication with him was fast and easy. He kindly allowed us to drop our bags early before the check-in time. The site manager who helped us check in was friendly and helpful too. The location is convenient - within 20 minutes walk to Pike Place and downtown. However, if you have several luggages (as we did), the walk from the rail station to the house uphill can be strenuous. "
3552523,20342440,2014-09-28,19411756,Krystal,"I loved this place! I would stay again! Amazing location, very cute/cozy. This was my first experiences with air bnb and I was anxious about it all. Genes place was perfect, the directions and communication couldn't have been easier! I had such an amazing experience I'll probably never use another hotel again! Thanks Gene for leaving such a great impression! Kiea was great with assisting everything as well! "
3552523,22379940,2014-11-04,22257874,Brenton,"Gene and his Chez DEX location were both amazing. He and his ""staff"" were very accommodating and the actual apartment was very clean and had a great view. "
3552523,22540568,2014-11-09,22593045,Steven,"My girlfriend and I had a wonderful stay here at Gene's place. It was my first time using airBnB, and although I wasn't able to meet Gene, he was always available to answer any questions or concerns. He also introduced us to his property manager, which helped us check in. The place was clean and organized, and comes with your own private room and bath. The windows offer a great morning/night view of Downtown and the waterfront. It was conveniently located near downtown and other districts with Uber costing less than $10 to get anywhere. We also rented bikes from the nearby Pronto Bike Exchange, which has stations positioned all over Seattle. I only wish we could have stayed longer!"
3552523,22673466,2014-11-11,22030598,Filip,Amazing place right next to Columbia Tower with a beautiful views to Seattle Port and first skyscrapers. All the places in downtown Seattle are in walking distance. The entire place is truly beautiful with all you need with an amazing bed too. We didn't meet Gene in person but still the communication was easy and quick with very very well organised access to the building. You're not gonna regret!
3552523,23020214,2014-11-20,23587563,Sara,Great view! Awesome apartment! Comfy bed! Clean and tidy! Super location! Highly recommended! Will be back! 
3552523,23228873,2014-11-25,17383436,Heather,My fault! Thought I had filter on entire home. Was a bit surprised I had rented a room and another party had reserved second bedroom! shared living room and kitchen. My husband was not amused by my mistake. Otherwise clean. Parking was easy enough.
3552523,23342603,2014-11-29,13446842,Tobias,"Everything as expected. Nice flat, clean, perfect location. "
3552523,23465092,2014-12-01,21875305,Ian,"This is a nice place to live in Seattle. Have a good view in the private/living room. And the apartment is pretty clean and warm. I feel very relax to use my lap-top in the living room. If you ask me ""wanna to  have a reservation @here again?"", the answer is absolutely YES. "
3552523,23522448,2014-12-03,21322406,Jasmine,Spectacular location with amazing city and ocean views. Thoroughly enjoyed our Seattle trip in this comfortable home.
3552523,23603549,2014-12-06,16113697,Zachary,"Can't say enough how the place worked out for me. Like everyone else said, it's centrally-located, clean and has a great view. Gene allowed for a late check-in since I had a late flight and his assistant was helpful. I could go on about the great bed, bedding and Amazon tv if you're a big tv watcher.  I actually plan to make another reservation request if the room is available in the next month.  Highly recommended."
3552523,23649325,2014-12-07,21478731,Michael,Great location within walking distance of all of downtown. Clean and comfortable. The apartment also has a really nice view.
3552523,24289326,2014-12-24,6242434,Christian,This place is great. You have everything you need (coffee!) in the living room and the bed is fantastic. You have a great view of the city without leaving the bed :-)
3552523,24377042,2014-12-27,24234857,Kerissa,"Chez Dex was great. Easy arrival, site manager and Gene were very accommodating. Perfect location, lovely apartment. Couldn't have asked for a better stay. Will definitely be staying here next time we're in Seattle. Highly reccomend!"
3552523,24626947,2014-12-31,20133919,Kelsey,Great
3552523,24658677,2015-01-01,17266019,Robin,This was a lovely apartment near downtown Seattle. It was easy for us to walk to the LINK station to get to the airport on our way home and to walk around town. It was easy to check in and was a comfortable place to stay. 
3552523,24903883,2015-01-03,25404647,Deanna,This was great. Just what we needed to see Seattle. Walking distance from everything you need downtown with a great view. 
3552523,25202092,2015-01-09,22771411,Connor,good place to rest!! very comfortable
3552523,25631162,2015-01-21,2326770,Rita,The room was clean and well located for exploring downtown. The highlight of the apartment is definitely the view!
3552523,26102423,2015-02-03,5003657,Olivia,"My friend and I stayed in the apartment for three nights and overall, it was a great stay! Everything was very clean and the bed was very comfortable. We shared the apartment with two other guests but because we were exploring the city most of the time and really only used the apartment to sleep, we saw them only once so it didn't even feel like we were sharing the apartment! The light link rail was only a 5 minute walk so we used that to get downtown and took a $5 uber ride back to avoid the steep hill. The site manager was also very accommodating with an early check-in and gave us advice on getting around the city."
3552523,26174155,2015-02-05,23779504,Kenny,"Genes spot was immaculate. My girlfriend and I had been going through a whirlwind of confusion after having been turned around at the border. Gene was very helpful and responded quickly. After having an exhausting night and nowhere to stay we finally landed this groovy place with an awesome view. It was exactly what we needed. Very comfortable and clean, a great view and a prime location in the Chinatown/japantown of south Seattle. I highly recommend: it's worth the price and much more. "
3552523,27193619,2015-02-27,764481,Andrew,"What a great stay! Centrally located, comfortable and effortless check-in. We only stayed one night, but Gene was able to allow us to stay with very short notice. I highly recommend his place to anyone staying in Seattle. Thanks, Gene!"
3552523,27533983,2015-03-07,16113697,Zachary,"Second stay at Chez Dex and it was just as good as the first time. Clean, comfortable, walking distance to downtown and transportation, room with a view, and a great host.  Had such a good visit the last that I've already made a reservation for my next stay.  Gene has unique artwork and other touches to add character to Chez Dex."
3552523,27866219,2015-03-13,29176304,Matthew,"Friendly tone, clear sense they've done this a lot, nice place."
3552523,28124959,2015-03-18,26924415,Joe,The apartment was everything that I expected and more. The bed was very comfortable and I was surprised at all of the extras in the apartment. The only thing that I didn't like is that it was hard to find information on the airbnb site. Even so the apartment was great. The best part is the proximity to the light rail. 
3552523,28197916,2015-03-19,29580350,Khai,"Great place, I enjoyed my stay. The view is spectacular and underrated in my opinion. You can see the skyscrapers of downtown Seattle, the Bay and snowcapped mountains of Puget Sound."
3552523,28279166,2015-03-21,29119658,マサヒデ,色々とご迷惑おかけしてしまいました。部屋はとても良く快適でした。街までも近くて、良かったです。ありがとうございました。
3552523,28458484,2015-03-23,27864098,Jennifer,"This was a great place for spur-of-the-moment live music trip from the east side of the mountians. We enjoyed the small balcony, viewing a perfectly timed sunset & bussling streets below. Thanks to everyone involved for their communication & friendliness!"
3552523,28557658,2015-03-26,7570693,Linda,"Gene's Apartment war praktisch gelegen - nahe zu allen Sehenswuerdigkeiten und zum Bahnhof. Sie hatte alles perfekt organisiert und war immer verfuegbar fuer alle Fragen. 
Kleine Abstriche gibt es fuer den leicht muffigen Geruch - etwas, das ich in den USA allerdings auch schon in den besten Hotels erlebt habe. 
Alles in allem eine praktische, guenstige Unterkunft mit bester Organisation. Danke, Gene!"
3552523,29396221,2015-04-07,20335593,Eric,"Great location, very walkable area. Nice room and very comfortable stay."
3552523,29910378,2015-04-14,9913944,Douglas,"The host was always in touch with us every step of the way to ensure that even as people who've never set foot in the city before, we were welcomed, comfortable and able to find the place without an issue. Despite the steep hill, it literally became home for the 5 days that we were there. The place was modern, clean and had whatever we needed for our short stay. Thanks for the amazing experience!"
3552523,30286902,2015-04-20,23438079,Julie,"This apartment was beautiful, well-equipped, and clean, in a good location in the International District. We rented the smaller room - which is quite small - but the common room provided plenty of space for when we were at the apartment. The kitchen had plenty of dishes and cookware and the balcony has a nice view of the mountains and Puget Sound.

The reason I am giving three stars is that our arrival was very stressful. We arrived late - at 11:30pm - which our host said would be no problem, but no one answered the phone to buzz us in when we called. We also tried the other number provided in the arrival instructions and no one answered. We ended up waiting outside for thirty minutes, until midnight, when another resident of the building came home and kindly let us in. 

Only after that did we get a call back from Gene's assistant, who said her phone had not been working. The next morning, Gene got in touch and he did not apologize for what happened. In fact, he suggested that we should have communicated with his assistant when we had arrived at the airport (which he did not say we should do ahead of time when we emailed to ask about our late arrival). We found him to be pretty rude to us, especially given what happened."
3552523,30558128,2015-04-24,6652187,Kaycee,"My fiancé and I had a great stay at Gene's place in Seattle. We arrived late, after midnight, and Gene did make it very clear to contact the property manager early to be sure we'd make it in. She was very friendly, and she even texted us to be sure we made it to Seattle safely that night. Both her and Gene were in contact with us upon our arrival and it was really appreciated, especially after a very long day of traveling. 

The apartment was cute, well furnished, and clean. The room was small, but perfect for us because we were out exploring the city! The bed was very comfortable, too. The bathroom is located right outside the bedroom door, it was clean, had tons of natural light, and the shower was spacious. 

The apartment definitely is in walking distance to everything, and if you need a cab it wasn't more than $10 to get someplace. We didn't meet Gene during our stay, but shared the apartment with a couple from Korea, and they too were wonderful. 

I will note that the hill up to the apartment is no joke! Be prepared for a hike up hill, but the views from the room are worth it. We both felt safe walking to and from the apartment, and even went out to explore the district we stayed in. Seattle was a wonderful city, and the people there were so friendly! We can't wait to go back."
3552523,31192745,2015-05-03,21696518,Joanne,"Good location, very close to train stations, 15-20 min walk to pike place market. Public transportation is very close as well. Nice view."
3552523,31652518,2015-05-08,29564562,Bin,"We had a really an enjoyable 4 days vacation at Gene's lovely apartment which (email hidden) and S Washington St cross, with 3-5 mins walking distance to China Town and Japan town also to King Street Station and union Station. "
3552523,32050670,2015-05-13,27783955,Troy,"Friendly staff, great overall experience in the city given the great view and easy walking to key Seattle locations. "
3552523,32322974,2015-05-17,28069961,Theresa,"No problems what so ever.  Clean apt.   Good & safe neighborhood.
We only wish we had known beforehand that other Airbnb guests would be staying in the apt's 2nd bedroom."
3552523,32506349,2015-05-19,108248,Susan,"Excellent accommodation with a view and good access to the Link train, great for getting to and from the airport.
Good contact with host and site manager helped me sort out my arrival and departure.
I enjoyed the challenge of walking up the hill at the end of a day out. I would come again."
3552523,32814032,2015-05-22,28018740,Alyssa,"Great place to stay, close to many different things in downtown Seattle. Easy access with public transportation, had a great stay. "
3552523,32911917,2015-05-23,3538823,Varada,"The place was clean, cozy and comfortable as described. "
3552523,33074951,2015-05-25,27723710,연실,"It was the great place. The window view is nice. Every stuff is fancy and comfortable. And the host, Gene is kind and good. So i could feel relaxed.
(The hill is little hard TT)"
3552523,33346704,2015-05-26,34205376,Shanelle,"This apartment was beautiful. We had access to the whole kitchen, living room, and our own bathroom. We had the entire place to ourselves.
The view from the balcony was my favorite part, as it perfectly overlooks the ocean straight ahead and the city to your right. We planned to head to pikes place and the sculpture park which were all about a mile away. It truly felt like we were in the heart of the city and living in luxury. "
3552523,33496046,2015-05-29,12342801,Manja,The flat was perfect for us - exactly as described. All was very clean and prepared for our arrival. Thanks!
3552523,33575590,2015-05-30,12007029,Tess,The place was clean & comfortable - exactly as described. Beautiful views of the water and an amazing location! 
3552523,33938731,2015-06-02,33148095,Phil,This apartment is a Sports lovers dream. It is a mere 10 minute walk from both stadiums and all of the local bar culture surrounding the local teams. It could not have been more perfect for me. The room is clean and perfectly appointed.  The flat itself is similarly extremely nice. Some excellent local Japanese and Chinese restaurants within a block or two as well.  Definitely recommended.
3552523,34109436,2015-06-04,8328984,Jan,This was our first ever airBandB experience. The facilities were great. The view was spectacular and the hill was everything that other guests had decided. The neighbourhood was a little confronting but we felt safe. We would definitely stay here again! 
3552523,34404788,2015-06-08,28229701,Crystal,Nice and clean and good location. Perfect for walking everywhere as we did not rent a car . Did not have any major problems . We did get cold on night and would have liked more blankets but other than that great place !!!! We would highly recommend and use again 
3552523,34677857,2015-06-10,35038079,Christina,We had a great stay at the dex! Awesome location close to international district and dt. Easy walking if your not adverse to hills :) would stay again but need a/c if staying in summer months. 
3552523,34862203,2015-06-13,31531243,Briana,"The listing description on this room is spot on. When I first arrived Keia welcomed me with fresh flowers and wished me a happy birthday! It was the sweetest thing. I loved staying in this room. We would leave the window open at night and wake up to an amazing breeze accompanied with a fantastic view of the water. The room was spacious and very clean. The bed was very comfortable. I loved the decor throughout the whole apartment. The bathroom was super clean and I loved the window next to the shower. I was able to look out on the beautiful scenery while getting ready in the morning. We did not spend a lot of time in the living room or kitchen, but both were pretty spacious and super clean. The whole apartment felt very homey and I was happy I was able to come back to it after a long day of exploring Seattle! The apartment sits at the top of a very steep hill, but it helped keep all the extra calories off from all the yummy food we ate all weekend! The apartment is located in Capitol Hill and about a 15-20 minute walk to Pike Place Market. We were able to take an Uber whenever we didn't feel like walking and that usually ranged from $5-10 for wherever we wanted to go. I really can't say enough good things about this room. We will definitely be staying here again whenever we make it back to Seattle. Thanks so much to Gene and Keia who made this experience so amazing!! We loved every minute of our stay in Seattle!"
3552523,35451237,2015-06-19,28513238,Dan,"This place was perfect for my wife and I. The apartment if about a 10 minute walk to Safeco field and a few GREAT Asian restaurants and markets. I would def stay here again. 

Another great thing about Gene's place is the roof patio, great views of the city. 

The only drawback is the amount of homeless people in the area- if that bothers you... they all kept to themselves. "
3552523,35665288,2015-06-21,32395281,Patricia,Close communication and a very welcoming space. 
3552523,36263226,2015-06-27,16113697,Zachary,"Another good stay at Chez Dex and as always, it was great.  The place was clean and the other guests were great. I stayed for a week for this visit and it felt like a 2nd home.  There was some new artwork and I always look forward to seeing what new interesting pieces come in. I hope to visit again soon!"
3552523,36410828,2015-06-28,29557844,Michelle,"Good communication, and the description was spot on. Clean and comfortable."
3552523,36685554,2015-06-30,522121,Cassie,"Mostly clean. This is right next to a huge fire station, so be prepared for loud sirens throughout the night. The Amazon Fire TV was a nice bonus."
3552523,36889968,2015-07-02,29646811,Crystal,"The location of the apartment is so close to lots of conveniences (supermarket, restaurants, transportation) and I'd gladly stay here again, with the one concession to that being that the weather is cooler. There no AC in the apartment which is not generally a problem, except Seattle was in the 80s/90s during my visit. However, there is a ceiling fan in the room and ice in the fridge to help with the heat. Other than the heat, the views from the balcony are great! There's a little table you can sit outside and enjoy the view while having a drink!"
3552523,37056682,2015-07-04,1716330,Sandi,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Chez Dex.  Directions, instructions and correspondence were all very clear and easy to follow and Gene was very responsive .  The apartment, bedroom and bath were exactly as described (bathroom in hallway next to the bedroom).  Very attractive and very clean.  We really appreciated the ceiling fan in the bedroom because Seattle is having abnormally hot weather and most places do not have AC.  So the apartment was quite warm but the bedroom comfortable for sleeping with the fan. We were able to walk everywhere from the apartment (very steep hills reminiscent of San Francisco) and only 20 mins walk from Pikes Place Market. There are - as mentioned by others - quite a few homeless parks very nearby.  We seemed to walk through one no matter which direction we went.  It was never a problem but it's good to be aware. Although there was another airbnb guest also staying at the apartment we never saw or heard her.  You spend a lot of time out when you are in Seattle :)
"
3552523,37507855,2015-07-07,32163728,Liz,"Great location for downtown Seattle. We booked our stay specifically to watch a Mariner's baseball game, and Dex's place is a short 10 minute walk from the stadium. 

Previous reviews are correct - it's a very steep 1.5 block walk uphill to the apartment (taking transit to International Station got us pretty close). Also, some homeless people in the neighbourhood - you wouldn't want to walk around alone at night.

Downtown location, so expect the usual noise (sirens, cars, etc.). We were there in a heatwave so the ceiling fan helped a lot at night.

Fantastic dim sum restaurant at the corner of Jackson and (3rd I think?) - we went every morning for a cheap, fresh breakfast. Lots of pubs and restaurants within walking distance. To get downtown is a slightly longer walk, but we found the transit very easy ($2.25 each way, per person).

We would definitely stay here again if we're coming to Seattle. Comfortable place, great location!"
3552523,37680327,2015-07-09,35950946,Fei,"The room is clean, the location is  convenient and the view is good. "
3552523,37871786,2015-07-11,33836401,Kerilyn,"The apartment was really nice but what really made it for us was the rooftop view! Great location if you don't mind walking the hills and a few homeless people. One thing my boyfriend and I found odd was that the door to the bedroom doesn't lock from the outside. Since the apartment was shared and someone else was staying in the other room we would have felt more  comfortable leaving our stuff in a room only we would have access to. Other than that, we had a great time!"
3552523,38649626,2015-07-17,19239570,Ralph,"I had an enjoyable stay at Chez DEX.  Views from both common living room and bedroom are spectacular.  Location is great for visiting Seattle U.  Gene took the trouble to give me the name of my ""room mates"" and it worked out great sharing the apt. with them.  This room does not have en suite bath but the only other room in the apartment does, so bath is for this room only and felt sufficiently private.  This neighborhood is home to a lot of hospitals and a police substation so sirens are normal in the entire area.  If you don't want sirens you will need to close the window.  I preferred the breeze.  Kitchen is nice and clean, I only had one day so didn't get a chance to use it much.  Great stay."
3552523,39181836,2015-07-21,17659876,Sihyun,This house was so nice and cozy. There were beautiful decoration and nice furnitures. But it was hard to me to go up hill. I am pleased to stay here with beautiful view. 
3552523,41901962,2015-08-09,5851353,Myrtille,"Out stay at Gene's was great, the place is very central, with an amazing view, very clean and quiet. Gene was nice and helpful. I'd totally recommend his place as a base to visit Seattle."
3552523,42491805,2015-08-13,387150,Kristina,"Great info on gene's BNB site, and great apartment. Clean and modern and so close to wonderful Seattle transportation. Took bus 99 from Pier 69 and only had a 2 block walk to apt. In am the walk down hill to the train ($3) was a boon, and only 30 min to the airport. Wish I had more time to explore China Town and Underground Seattle from this part of town. Loved the rooftop at Gene's place and the cold AC that was waiting for me in his cozy apt. Lucky for me the other room was vacant the one night I stayed, but would have been equally glad to meet a fellow traveler.  Check out Panama Hotel (book On the Corner of Bitter and Sweet written about it) which is right near by, and has a wonderful tea/coffee room with delishous squash bread. Built in 1890's. So much history here. "
3552523,43162128,2015-08-17,18723819,Zoe,"Great location to stay with metros, buses and trains nearby. We definitely have easy access to any part of Seattle including the airport! We share kitchen and living room with other airbnbers but Gene is remotely controlling everything around so it's kind a mixture of feelings with helpfulness, mystery and 'big brother's watching u' (not in a bad way) at the same time. Just a few remainders that may be useful for future guests, (a) if anything in the kitchen seems like missing overnight, they were taken good care of in the dish washer, (b) sharing living space with other guests who may arrive in the middle of ur stay (as opposed to sharing with hosts) can be a bit pressuring. It's like in a hostel-state-of-mind, great fun though."
3552523,43317187,2015-08-18,35623810,Prasanth,"This is my second time staying at that place. Honestly, with my regular usage of AirBnB usage in Seattle area, I should say, this the best one out there for me, in all categories like location/cleanliness/comfort/price etc. I'd recommend this to all. You will not be disappointed at all."
3552523,43710759,2015-08-21,33823438,Eli,"Easy to access the place, clean and inviting, exactly as described. Thanks, Gene!"
3552523,47774785,2015-09-21,33516709,Mark,Our stay was brief but everything was as described and very enjoyable. Gene was great at communicating with us and the location in downtown Seattle was super convenient. The condo was very clean and bright and the bed was awesome. We definitely recommend this listing. Thanks 
3552523,48123274,2015-09-23,43823114,冬华,"a marvelous experience.clean,neat.very  good  view  of the window.thanks"
3552523,57389908,2015-12-25,34406022,Max,"I rarely write a review, but Gene's place is incredible. It's very well equipped. It has every cooking utensil you can think about, and many condiments that may be left from previous tenants. It's very clean and the carpet is extremely comfortable. Gene has a very good taste of art and we absolutely love the art works in the rooms. I would highly recommend this place."
3552523,57930302,2015-12-30,49894989,Andy,"Most everything about our stay at Gene's was great, it was very accommodating and comfortable. There is a great view of the water from the living room and a nice view of the Colombia Tower from the bedrooms. Bedrooms have great insulation, and rooms were spacious enough, with very nice furnishings. Beds were comfortable and everything seemed clean. One of my friends that joined on the trip is very picky when it comes to bathrooms, but was very pleased to find out how clean these were. The only complaints I have would be that the bathtubs were a bit slippery and the hot water would stall when more than one person would try to shower at a time. Other than that we loved our stay and would definitely recommend it. Thanks Gene!"
3793406,17890968,2014-08-18,3793350,Lizbeth,"Aaron was a great host, super friendly a great family.  
We stayed here while our house was getting painted, and it all worked great.  The apartment is really spacious, the bathroom although small as described in the posting works well because there is another space with a big sink in between the 2 bedrooms.  
3 blocks away from wholefoods only the best supermarket ever! 
We have a 6 month old and they added a pack n play for us to use, really nice of them to offer that.  
An overall great experience.  "
3793406,37080605,2015-07-04,35607981,Beth,"This was the perfect spot for my brother and I to stay for a quick trip to Seattle for a wedding.  The weather was unusually hot and the basement location was nice and cool.  As other reviewers had noted, the bathroom itself is rather small, but there's a separate dressing room with sink that made it easy for both of us to get ready at the same time.  We appreciated having two separate bedrooms.  The neighborhood was great and the house was easy to find. The only thing the space lacked was a couch, but since we didn't spend much time there, it was fine for us to sit at the kitchen table to relax and figure out our plan each day.  It was just the right space for the two of us.    "
3793406,38937121,2015-07-19,26333734,Allen,"Aaron is a great host, the accommodations were very clean and exactly as described.  We felt right at home.  The bed and linens were very comfortable.  Because it was a ""mother-in-law suite"" we felt like we could come and go without disturbing our hosts, everything was private (including the kitchen and laundry).  The location is excellent and was a great place to experience local living and as a base for exploring the city.  Aaron gave us excellent recommendations for eating and sites to see. "
3793406,39684653,2015-07-25,1383324,Josh,Two thumbs up! It was a wonderful experience. The place is really clean and cozy. The location is perfect. My wife and baby liked it a lot. Highly recommend!
3793406,41774882,2015-08-09,36208064,Charlie,"Staying with Aaron was an absolute pleasure. Starting with my arrival (which ended up being at nearly 1 AM due to a late flight), Aaron was extraordinarily accommodating. The apartment has it's own entrance and plenty of space, and is really well situated to get to the Seattle Center/Key Arena (an easy 10 minute drive). Our stay in Seattle was great and this apartment was perfect!"
3793406,42711720,2015-08-15,36566102,Jen,"The perfect host! Very considerate and accommodating. Clean, quiet place in a nice neighborhood. Ample parking and so convenient to all Seattle has to offer. "
3793406,44298077,2015-08-25,35103096,Lisa,"Unfortunatly, I didn't have the opportunity to meet Aaron and Kate. We were just so busy falling in love with Seattle. The apartment was is a quant neighborhood close to EVERYTHING!  I will actually miss that apartement; it suited me and my adult daughter perfectly."
3793406,45127890,2015-08-31,23917540,Andrew,Aaron was a great host. The space was exactly as described and we were provided with everything we needed. Accessing the apartment was easy and there was plenty of space for the both of us. I definitely recommend this to anyone traveling to Seattle. It's not in the busy downtown area but close enough to get the full experience.
3793406,46740399,2015-09-13,26905317,Aimee,"Aaron was easy to contact when we had a few questions.  The place was clean and in a great location.  The place is on the small side, great for one couple or one couple and a child.  "
3053237,13123664,2014-05-19,5126354,Jeff Stuart ,"Shawn delivered all as promised. Nice place clean comfortable. ( New Sheets ! ) 
Thanks Shawn. 
I recommend this place it's a good location and perfect for a couple getaway. 

Stuart. "
3053237,13702638,2014-06-02,5357058,Laura,This is truly a great place to stay. The cottage is absolutely beautiful and very comfortable and homey. It is a nice walk to downtown Ballard and an easy drive to other fun places.  Shawn was fantastic and ensured our stay was great with maps of the area and bikes to use to get around. I would definitely recommend!!!
3053237,13975017,2014-06-09,11541517,Louis,"This is a wonderful home in a great location. Me and my guest had planned to explore more of the Seattle area, but there was so much going on in Ballard that we spent most of our time there. 
I can honestly say we did not want for anything staying at this cottage. We had everything we needed. There is a beautiful  spacious deck where we enjoyed our meals. The home was comfortable and complete for all our needs. 
The location was ideal. Walking distance to several restaurants, coffee shops and a Trader Joe's. Being a fan of craft beers it was great to have at least three breweries within a 10 minute walk. 
Shawn was a great host. He was accommodating in every way possible. He was available for questions and was very responsive before and during our stay. 
If AirBNB is designed to make it easy for travelers to live like locals then my stay was the perfect example of that experience. If you are going to Seattle, I highly recommend that you stay at this quaint cottage. You will not be disappointed."
3053237,14360024,2014-06-17,9372157,Jeff,"Shawn was the perfect host . This is a very charming cottage with all the modern amenities , it has everything you need , even a washer and dryer !! The bed was comfortable and the place was super clean . If you want to visit Seattle this is a great location , close to everything but quiet and peaceful . Shawn was super responsive to any and all questions . Airbnb was made for places like this.
"
3053237,14493036,2014-06-20,4440899,Nicholas,"Beautiful home, lots of light, close proximity to the restaurants, bars and shopping in downtown Ballard. The house is in wonderful condition and is very well kept and furnished. Relaxing place to come back to. The bikes were a great asset to go exploring the neighborhood!"
3053237,14701804,2014-06-24,7320433,Justine,Shawn was great! Very friendly and responsive to all of my questions. The cottage is beautiful--you can tell that he's a designer. Would definitely recommend!
3053237,14794573,2014-06-26,16509628,Johanna,"This was my first airbnb experience, so I didn't know exactly what to expect, but Shawn was helpful and communicative all along the way which was a big help for a novice like me. 

I arrived and the space was immaculate which is really important to me! The cottage is just as cute as in the photos. Shawn leaves a thorough list of items to help make your stay easier and enjoyable. The neighborhood was quite peaceful, easily accessible to/from the downtown Seattle area (though I think Seattle in general might just be a little hard to navigate your first or second time so make sure you have a map or good directions if driving), and I was able to travel around Ballard by bicycle (another huge plus--thanks to Shawn for making bikes available). 

Ballard is great and has so much going! Lots of coffee shops/restaurants/bars/activities. I didn't have time to explore the bars/restaurants much, but I did get to practice yoga a few times at Kula and had lunch at a tea shop before I took off. Kula is just one of many studios in the area, but I really enjoyed the instructors there. Just outside of the immediate center of town, and still easily biked to, there are the Chittenden Locks; I highly recommend you go! Very beautiful botanic gardens and you can watch as boats enter and leave the locks. Really cool!

One last thing about Ballard: so many amenities! I am from the east, and was pleasantly surprised that both my bank and cell phone provider had branches nearby to Shawn's. My phone was actually on the fritz so I was lucky to have that resource right there to help me out in a bind.

All in all, a really great trip!!"
3053237,15054490,2014-07-01,15546189,Jim,"A stay at Shawn's fishermans cottage was way beyond our expectations. The location was perfect,close to everything, yet away from heavy traffic and noise.
The home is lovely, roomy, and very comfortable. The private ""crows nest"" front deck was enjoyed both mornings and evenings. Shawns response to texts were prompt and considerate.
Shawn has done a beautiful job of making our stay one we will always remember!"
3053237,15402115,2014-07-08,5742193,Stephanie,"Shawn was right on it , responded quickly to our interest in his place and to accepting our rservation, he gave us definite directions on how to get to the cottage and get in...told us of proximity to ourdaughters and advised of bikes and the gasgrill....it was a great place to stay."
3053237,15761658,2014-07-15,15872207,Leslie,"The 1903 Modern Cottage was cute as a button and neat as a pin!  A really nice place to stay - all the comforts of home and it felt very welcoming.  We enjoyed the neighborhood atmosphere, Shawn left us all sorts of information about the area - things to do, places to go. He was in contact whenever we needed him. We would recommend and hope to be back."
3053237,15973835,2014-07-19,6796258,Samidh,"Cool little cottage that's even cuter than in the pictures. Ballard is a fantastic neighborhood and this house is within walking distance of everything. Shawn made my stay painless, with lots of little thoughtful touches like providing maps and even a bicycle pump! Only regret is that I was out enjoying Seattle so much that I didn't get to spend more time at this place!"
3053237,16300438,2014-07-25,6162998,Sharyn,"Shawn's cottage was extremely cozy and comfortable, with wonderful architectural details and decorating. It's obvious a lot of thought was put into making it a home. And it's located near everything we love in the Ballard neighborhood. There were several grocery stores nearby - Trader Joe's, Fred Meyer, a Whole Foods - so we were able to make use of the kitchen space. And to eat on the wonderful patio/deck, when it wasn't raining. But we also enjoyed many meals out at fantastic restaurants nearby."
3053237,16663083,2014-07-31,16441737,Shannon,This was a great home to stay in and Shawn was a very helpful host. He gave bus directions when we needed them and was accommodating with checking in and out. The neighborhood was peaceful and fun but within walking or biking distance to shops and restaurants in both Fremont and Ballard. It was also easy to get to a bus and go downtown. Highly recommended!
3053237,17148703,2014-08-08,15352348,Molly,"Shawn was an excellent host, even getting an iron and ironing board for me when I asked if he had one at the house. He made us feel very welcome, and left a detailed guide to the house and maps to Seattle. "
3053237,17367310,2014-08-11,5943881,Stan,Both Shawn and his place were great.  Had very clear instructions for us and communicated well if we needed something.  Ballard is also great with lots of places to eat/drink.  Highly recommend staying here.  
3053237,17508939,2014-08-13,5927424,Scot,"Wonderful place!  Stylishly decorated, beautiful kitchen, lovely front deck.  Best of all, the house is located minutes from a very cool shopping district with lots of wonderful restaurants and boutiques. "
3053237,17655553,2014-08-15,9826486,Marcus And Jillian,"Shawn was such a gracious host! His place was cozy and comfortable, the perfect home base to explore Seattle. Make sure you use the bikes, we did and the city is so bike friendly! We did not use the kitchen since there were so many great restaurants in the Ballard area, but it looked well equipped. His neighbor was so nice and welcoming also! We enjoyed our stay so much and would stay again when we return to the city! Thanks Shawn :)"
3053237,18061978,2014-08-21,4477713,Yung,"I had a great time.  Shawn's place was very clean and updated. It has full kitchen, comfortable couch, lots of natural lighting, a lot of interesting objects. I enjoyed looking through them.  The washer/dryer was a bonus.  All the spaces were well designed including the tankless water heater.  I especially liked the desk area.  I could just sit there and look out the window.  We enjoyed the deck area, sipping wine and just enjoying the sunset. Very comfortable and inviting place.  Thank you, Shawn."
3053237,18256676,2014-08-24,6214879,Nathan,"Shawn was an absolutely fantastic host.  In addition to having an architecturally interesting, cozy, clean home in a safe neighborhood, Sean is a great guy to boot.  His recommendations for the Ballard neighborhood were spot on, and we enjoyed taking out the bikes he left for us.  

Terrific Airbnb experience, thanks Sean."
3053237,18542711,2014-08-28,4726693,Hannah,"Shawn's place is exactly as described and pictured. The location suited us perfectly. Easy to navigate, and with easy access to downtown Seattle etc. Great to stay in a place with character, which helped it to feel like a home away from home. Shawn was great in recommending local restaurants and things to do, and the whole reservation/trip went very smoothly. Thanks Shawn! "
3053237,18795635,2014-09-01,6639036,Marie,"Very nice little cottage in Ballard, about 15 minute walk to where shops/restaurants/farmer's market are.
It was very clean and tidy when we arrived, and it has everything you need for your stay (including maps of Seattle). 
And it was easy to get in touch with Shawn when we had questions."
3053237,19211972,2014-09-08,19544360,Dena,I found the little house very comfortable. 15 minute walk from Ballard which was ok. The house was clean. I enjoyed using the turntable. I bought some albums to add to the collection. I felt safe.
3053237,19442744,2014-09-12,20916569,Nicole,"It was my first stay using Airbnb, and I must say I thoroughly enjoyed the experience!  Shawn's cottage was so picturesque and even more lovely in person.  He was great communicating during the reservation process and checked in throughout my stay to make sure everything was great!  I truly felt at home and got a different Seattle experience than the typical hotel stay. Loved everything about Shawn's Ballard Cottage & would stay again in a heartbeat!"
3053237,19670657,2014-09-16,16839148,Eleanor,"Thank you so much Shawn! Your home is so clean, beautiful and conveniently located. My mom and I really enjoyed the large outdoor terrace and the open layout inside. Hope to come again soon -- 

Highlights: Beautiful design, great kitchen, massive deck, hints of salt air on the balcony, view of the open sky over Ballard, walkable area, express bus stop two blocks away, great coffee at Java Jahn's... "
3053237,20019279,2014-09-22,8052690,Jeanne,"Shawn's cottage was a great place for us: roomy, very well-designed and decorated, spacious kitchen with everything we needed, comfy bed, and even a laundry room. Shawn was easy to communicate with, and the space was super clean and homey, with lots of personal touches and art. Ballard has a neighborhood feel, with some light industrial/warehouse bits (complete with nano-breweries, taprooms, and a great barbecue - don't miss Bourbon and Bones), and easy access to public transportation (just 20 minutes or so to downtown via bus). Walk up to the Ballard Farmers Market if you're there on a Sunday; it's amazing! Thanks, Shawn - we had a great weekend."
3053237,20247527,2014-09-26,1495755,Rebecca,Already missing this cozy modern cottage in one of my favorite parts of Seattle. The large deck and big windows give you a great feel for the ever changing weather of Seattle and its dramatic sunsets. The space was very clean and the art work was so unique and just a general treat to be surrounded in.  A perfect respite! Also Shawn was very responsive and although we didn't meet in person he was a great host.  Highly recommend this spot! 
3053237,20625428,2014-10-02,2453417,Margie,"Shawn was a great host and his cottage was the perfect home away from home! Shawn kept in touch and provided all of the necessary information for our arrival. The cottage was such a warm and inviting space! It has a fantastic deck, which we took advantage of during the warm fall days. The living space was comfortable and we loved Shawn's design sense. The cottage was an easy walk to the center of Ballard, where there were tons of restaurants, bars and shops. We loved our stay at the cottage - thanks Shawn!"
3053237,21222154,2014-10-13,4900487,Ross,"This house is just as awesome as it looks in the pictures. Its on a nice secluded block yet close to everything. Me and my girlfriend had a great time staying here for a week. Everything was clean and tidy when we showed up, and Shawn is a great host, giving us all the privacy we could hope for. I would most definitely stay here again!"
3053237,21674781,2014-10-21,21537092,Jessica,"Shawn's home was a very cozy spot located near the Burke Trail, Downtown Ballard and more!  We thoroughly enjoyed the location and the home.  The laundry was a great added bonus and the bikes were an amazing addition as well!  Copper the cat (next door neighbors) was on the porch most mornings and was a great host as was Shawn."
3053237,21804139,2014-10-24,3448788,Tom,"The cottage was perfect for my 3 nights in Seattle.  Quiet, clean with everything necessary to make me immediately feel at home.  The gas fireplace was a really nice way to quickly heat the cottage, too.  Location was also great for a nice walk to the restaurants and shops in Ballard and a short drive to Fremont.  

Shawn was an awesome host too, with great communication and very quick with responses.  At one point I thought I'd locked myself out of the cottage and Shawn responded immediately, and even though I didn't b/c the key I had worked both locks Shawn came over anyway to be sure I had no troubles getting back in."
3053237,21988105,2014-10-27,8469031,Caitlin,"Shawn's house was even better than I expected. It was impeccably clean, beautiful, and artistic. The location was good -- just a quick Uber ride from anywhere in the city. Shawn was a fantastic host, helpful and easy to reach. I can't wait to come back soon!"
3053237,22507328,2014-11-08,879485,Nakiesha,"We LOVED our stay at Shawn's cottage. It's so cozy & delightfully decorated... we immediately felt fully at home here! The house is situated in a quiet neighborhood with easy access to coffee shops, restaurants, and everything the charming Ballard & Fremont districts have to offer. This will be my first choice for future Seattle stays. "
3053237,22935783,2014-11-17,11523922,Kate,"We had a great time getting around Seattle by foot from Shawn's place. There are 2 bus lines pretty close to the house, a 24 hour grocery store, and shopping along Ballard Ave and Market is within a mile.  We took the B-G trail over to Queen Anne for brunch one morning, explored the city all day, and came home to this cozy cottage to relax."
3053237,24674091,2015-01-01,8593248,Devon,"Shawn's place was great, he was awesome about recommending local breweries, and ensuring i felt super welcome during my stay. The front porch was perfect to hang out on in the mornings, and the inside was cozy and modern. "
3053237,26308730,2015-02-09,1741465,Kyle,"We had a lovely stay at Shawns cottage.  This little green house is so cosy and had everything we needed.
We arrived late in the evening so didn't get to meet our host but he made it easy for us to gain access.  The house was warm when we got in which was nice as it had been cold all day.
Shawn was very helpful leading up to our stay at his place.  He checked in with us several times to make sure that everything was going according to plan so we never had any worries at all.
The location was great for us.  Street parking was fairly tight as there is not a lot of room between cars when they are parked on either side of the road.  We didn't have any problem finding a space though.
The area around the cottage is a mix of older houses and newer places going up to revitalize the neighbourhood. There were plenty of food options within walking distance.  We took one of Shawn's suggestions for a bbq meal and have no regrets at all because it was delicious and well worth the 10 minute walk.
I would not hesitate to recommend Shawn's place to my friends."
3053237,26579950,2015-02-15,6660762,Elizabeth,"A beautiful little cottage on a quiet street.  The house is nicely decorated and comfortable for a stay.  The kitchen is particularly well stocked with everything you could need for cooking.  The cottage is set up from the street, with a very private deck that was wonderful for sitting in the early spring sun!"
3053237,27109820,2015-02-25,2988066,Erez,"Tremendous quiet and relaxing stay. Great tucked away part of Ballard. Easy to walk or bike to the more populated areas, but I enjoyed being just a bit away from the main drag. Never met Shaun which is too bad because he was great help and a good host from afar. This place was great, coming back soon for sure."
3053237,28372183,2015-03-22,19335800,Annie,"Shawn's home is the perfect basecamp for exploring Seattle--close access to a bustling part of town and public transportation, but private, quiet and cozy. Shawn's excellent sense of style is inspiring and inviting, and we felt at ease immediately. Delicious heat from a gas-powered stove drove away the typical Seattle Spring chill, while a clean and ship-shape kitchen invited us to stay in and cook together. 

Although we didn't get to meet, Shawn's notes were thorough, giving us the guidance to be good guests. We appreciated the privacy and the comfort of a home away from home. "
3053237,28945898,2015-04-01,5568101,Tim And Shana,"Shawn's Cottage in Ballard was perfect for our stay in Seattle. It was super comfortable and private, and his house has so much character; a true gem in this neighborhood.
Shawn is a great host and was very receptive to any questions and info for the house and the neighborhood. I would highly recommend staying at this cottage and exploring all that Ballard has to offer."
3053237,29197942,2015-04-05,8257539,Norah,"I stayed at Shawn's cottage for a weekend getaway with my boyfriend and it was a perfect jumping off point for exploring the city, cycling and eating and drinking our way through Ballard. 

The apartment itself was clean and cozy, extremely quiet and comfortable. The deck was an awesome place to hang out and the neighbor cat was super cool and friendly. The immediate neighborhood is great - quiet, tree lined streets and very accessible to everything we wanted to do in Seattle. If you're coming with bikes, there is great access to miles and miles of bike paths. 

I only met Shawn briefly, but he was also super cool and friendly and he sent plenty of good recommendations prior to our stay. 

In short, if I lived in Seattle, I could see myself living at the cottage. I would not hesitate to stay here on future trips to Seattle. "
3053237,29894198,2015-04-13,10827446,Gabe,"Shawn was an excellent host from start to finish. He was very responsive to my questions in advance of my booking request & subsequent checkin, and he left a detailed & very helpful House Manual on the kitchen counter, along with plenty of travel guide materials to help direct me to the best of everything in Seattle. The property was very comfortable and had all essentials I could ask for.. plenty of space to relax, work, in-unit laundry, full kitchen, etc. All in all it was a five star property and a five star experience!"
3053237,30419690,2015-04-21,25659106,John,"This is only my third Airbnb stay, but it will be hard to top my stay at Shawn's Ballard cottage. I arrived to a pile of information on attractions, restaurants and getting around town which. I got every morning started listening to KEXP (the best radio station in the country) on his stereo. I used his bike to enjoy the sunshine and get to points close by  via the Burke-Gilman trail. I walked to all the shops and restaurants of Ballard Ave or to a D bus stop to take me directly downtown. 

The cottage is very well decorated and makes you feel very comfortable, as does Shawn. He was never bothersome, but always responded. 

Also, the neighbors are really nice and invited me to their BBQ!

Staying here played a big part in my having an incredible visit to Seattle and I would love to stay again some time."
3053237,31365833,2015-05-04,31378400,Pablo M.,"This was one of the first airbnb's my fiance´ and I spent the night in.  And let me tell you, it was great.  There was plenty of room and the patio area in front of the home is prefect for relaxing and having a drink.  Shawn was very accommodating about the check in time, which was great for us as we showed up very late.

The on street parking that was reserved for us was perfect and right in front of the place.  The home comes with a little fire place, which is a really nice touch.  It's set far enough away from the street that it's very quiet at night, which is awesome for getting a good nights rest.

I would definitely stay here again given the chance, and would not hesitate to recommend Shawn and his home to anyone looking for an airbnb."
3053237,32393861,2015-05-17,11093786,Cherie,"Shawn's place is a GREAT home base to explore Seattle.   The place is darling and perfect for two people although you could make it work for four people too.  It was well stocked and equipped with everything we needed and Shawn was super responsive and helpful.   The bikes were a super plus!  
We loved the Ballard neighborhood!  Great food, laid back and the locks are really cool.   It's also adjacent to the happening neighborhood of Fremont.   It's only about a 10 minute drive to downtown seattle too.  Again:  Awesome home base. 
We would definitely stay at this sweet Ballard cottage again!  "
3053237,33266510,2015-05-26,3150235,Kelsey,"We loved the home from the moment we arrived! The location was amazing, and the size of this home was perfect. Shawn went above and beyond answering our questions about the surrounding area. 

This home is located next to Ballard's best breweries and walkable distance to the downtown area. We used the bus system and found it really easy to use. "
3053237,33603463,2015-05-30,32379126,Maria,"The inside of the house was more spacious than the pictures make it out to be. It was very cozy and comfortable, great shower! The neighborhood was close to everything...only a 10min drive to just about everywhere in Seattle.  "
3053237,34082454,2015-06-04,4004459,Katherine,"I had a great stay at Shawn's cottage when I came to Seattle for a week for work.  Check-in was easy and convenient.  Everything was clean and charming, and the location (somewhere around the Ballard/Fremont line) was perfect for my needs.  I never had an issue finding on-street parking.  I especially loved that the kitchen was fully stocked, with one quibble--there was no microwave, which made reheating some leftovers a challenge.  So keep that mind if it's an issue for you.  It's not a dealbreaker for me, I would definitely stay again."
3053237,34310790,2015-06-07,9662033,Patty,"Super cute and clean cottage. Great eclectic artwork everywhere. Well appointed. If you are brewery fan, there is one on every other block. Lots to explore with the bikes that come with the cottage. Shawn was really responsive when I needed him. Cooper the cat next door is an added plus - fat and lovable!"
3053237,34789399,2015-06-12,18844094,Ashley,"Shawn's Ballard cottage was exactly what we were looking for in our mid week visit to Seattle.  Working in the brewing industry, Ballard was the perfect location with something like 11 breweries all within a 5 mile radius.  Shawn answered any and all questions we had in a timely manor and helped us navigate public transportation to get to his home without breaking the bank and taking a cab.  I would 100% recommend his home to anyone looking to stay in a vibrant, positive and beer/food focussed neighborhood in Seattle.  Thanks Shawn!"
3053237,35211887,2015-06-16,5957050,Sarah,We really enjoyed our stay at Shawn's cottage in Ballard!  It was the perfect size for my husband and I. It is in a great location. We were in walking distance to many restaurants and breweries. It was very easy for us to drive to downtown Seattle. We would definitely stay here again!
3053237,35641750,2015-06-21,7251754,Megan,"Shawn gave us great recommendations on where to eat and visit during our stay, and provided maps and local info. Description of home was accurate and neighborhood was cute."
3053237,36013486,2015-06-24,31667871,Andrew,Fabulous place! So close to everything we wanted! Shawn is a great host and very responsive to our requests or questions! Definitely a comeback to and stay kind of place. 
3053237,36692087,2015-06-30,3239701,Christine,Absolutely loved staying at Shawn's cute house in Ballard! It was clean and well appointed. The bikes were an amazing amenity too. I will definitely recommend this place to friends and hope to be back next time we are in Seattle.
3053237,37308380,2015-07-06,29953334,Jason,This cottage provided a very nice base for our long  weekend in Seattle.   It was very clean and comfortable and the location was perfect. There is an awesome brewery just a few minutes walk away and other amenities are easily walkable. I have no hesitation recommending this spot to future guests. 
3053237,37703612,2015-07-09,17944575,Derek,Really nice place in a great location. Shawn responded to all inquiries and messages in a timely fashion. Definitely recommended. 
3053237,38376969,2015-07-15,7963051,Charles,"shawn is a great host he would send us information on events that were happening in the area.    this house is located  right where you need to be.  we will probably be staying here again when we come back up in a year. over all a week well spent.

  oh and watch out for cooper the cat. scared the hell out of me  when he jumped in my lap while i was reading a book. "
3053237,39044277,2015-07-20,12903580,Kathy,"Cute cottage, with artsy vibe. There are a bunch of taphouses in the neighborhood, so a taphouse crawl can be a lot of fun. Very comfortable, super clean and quiet, with plenty of room to relax. "
3053237,39621592,2015-07-25,1110041,Jessica,"My husband, daughter & I loved our stay at Shawn's cottage. The pictures are accurate, the space is clean & uncluttered (but has personality), and Shawn was a friendly & responsive host. My daughter was comfortable on the pull-out sofa. We felt like we had plenty of space, especially with the deck, which is another room with lovely views in good weather. 

There's a nice playground & great coffee just a short walk away. We did end up driving a fair bit, when we needed to go to other parts of Seattle that weren't downtown. Biking wasn't an option with a 3-year-old, but I can imagine using bikes if I'd been alone or with a friend."
3053237,39942363,2015-07-27,34509320,Sunny,"Shawn's Ballard home is such a great place to stay in Seattle. The location couldn't be better, and the house is very cozy and well appointed. We were able to cook a fantastic dinner in the lovely kitchen, and made use of the grill on the deck. We will definitely rent this space again, as we have family living near by, and will recommend it to other visitors as well. Thank you, Shawn!"
3053237,40433116,2015-07-31,8286962,Jonathan,"Shawn's place was an awesome way to experience Seattle for the first time. We enjoyed being a short walk from Ballard, with lots of bars, restaurants and other fun options. His cottage is also a super short walk from at least three micro-breweries and slate coffee bar. The cottage itself was clean, quiet and private. Awesome deck to enjoy your morning coffee. I would definitely stay again! "
3053237,41085453,2015-08-04,6917680,Dollie,The house was beautiful and vey comfortable.  There was so much to do nearby and the neighborhood felt safe and convenient.  The record player was a nice touch!  The front deck was a nice hangout spot. Finding parking on the street was never an issue. I would definitely recommend this place to others and I would love to stay here again.
3053237,41433274,2015-08-07,38512954,Rebecca,"Shawns home was wonderful. Centrally located near many amazing breweries, the neighborhood was peaceful and beautiful. His house is clean, inviting and has array of amenities that made us feel right at home. 
If you get a chance, take a stroll down to Stoup, a local spot with an IPA that'll please even the seasoned beer drinker. 
Thank you Shawn for welcoming us into your home and providing such a cool place to relax after a day's adventure. "
3053237,41590811,2015-08-08,14315837,Blair,"Great city, great neighborhood, great cottage!  Plenty of room for my husband and I.  The cottage is clean but comfy.  Several breweries within walking distance.  I highly recommend taking the bikes that Shawn provides east on the Burke Gilman trail to Gas Works park.  He also provides a lock in case you want to stop somewhere for a bit.  7-11 and Fred Meyer nearby for beer/food.  Golden Gardens park is a quick drive or $10 Uber away - get there early for a fire pit on a nice day.  Downtown Ballard is within walking distance - plenty to do there.  La Carta De Oaxaca is great Mexican food with a salsa bar.  French press and nice outdoor space at the cottage were great bonuses (and Cooper, the super friendly cat next door).  "
3053237,42117732,2015-08-11,25663716,Molly,"Awesome spot! We loved staying here - the location, the decor, the space, all were great. Shawn is a great host, too - he provides yummy local coffee & cream and also gave us tips about events in the neighborhood that he heard about. Would definitely stay here again& highly recommend to others!"
3053237,42398787,2015-08-13,35034510,Becky,"Shawn's house was absolutely incredible. From the fresh coffee to the organic shampoo and conditioner in the shower- he makes his house so welcoming to guests. The neighborhood was great and the ride via Uber into the city was simple.  Parking was a breeze on the street right in front of the house and there was even a friendly cat named Cooper (his neighbor's) that was hanging out with us on the deck. Everything about our stay was great. My husband and I spent two nights at Shawn's house to start our honeymoon trip and it couldn't have been a better experience. We will definitely return to Shawn's house when we return to Seattle. Thanks again, Shawn!"
3053237,43232554,2015-08-18,25012885,Paul,"We thoroughly enjoyed Shawn's home. The bed and couch were comfy, the kitchen was stocked with staples and spices, as well as coffee and fresh cream. The bathroom towels were great. It's a great neighborhood. We biked to the locks and Gas Works Park (we recommend both), as well as several of the breweries in the area. As hilly as Seattle is in general, Ballard is not so. It's very conducive to biking.  Many excellent breweries and restaurants are within walking/biking distance. None of the places we ate or drank at was a disappointment.
   We would surely stay at Shawn's again if we make it back to Seattle."
3053237,43508439,2015-08-20,2031200,Katy,"Shawn's place was fantastic. We love to check out local breweries when we travel, and there were a handful within a few minutes' walk from the cottage -- including one that was only a half-block away. We also enjoyed being able to easily walk to Ballard and Fremont restaurants since we didn't have a car. The place itself was also comfortable and clean, and the front deck was a huge plus!"
3053237,43815010,2015-08-22,14901454,Leia And Dustin,"My husband and I had the nicest stay at Shawn's lovely 1-BR home in Ballard. It was such a comfortable place to come back to after long days exploring Seattle and Ballard. Shawn was super nice and provided us with a free growler of beer, and coffee and organic half and half to start our mornings. The house is about a 15 minute walk from the restaurants in Ballard (less than 5 minute drive) and within STEPS of a few microbreweries in the area. We also used the two vintage bicycles Shawn offers as part of the airbnb and had a blast riding around Ballard and beyond (highly recommend the Burke-Gilman trail). HIGHLY recommend this listing!"
3053237,44779031,2015-08-29,22202502,Donald,"Fully equipped, cozy, and comfortable home away from home. Shawn's place is close to Downtown Ballard and he is an absolute professional. Quick communication and great recommendations.  "
3053237,45669871,2015-09-05,37034404,Tim,Shawn was a fantastic host and was extremely responsive throughout our stay. We had a wonderful stay in his beautifully appointed cottage. It's easy to tell that he is artistic; his home is decorated by many thoughtful touches that made our stay a singular one. The Ballard neighborhood was quaint and friendly and was within a few miles of several small breweries. I can't say enough about what a great experience it was. 
3053237,46164502,2015-09-08,24663009,Tamara,"We had a nice stay at Shawn's. He provided helpful information about the area, which was centrally located to many bars and restaurants. A bit of a drive if you are looking to go downtown but we had a car rental so it was no problem. The place was exactly as pictured. "
3053237,46607868,2015-09-12,4440090,Claire,"What a wonderful place to call home in Seattle! Shawn made sure this home has everything you need and was attentive, supportive, and welcoming. We enjoyed the spacious deck (along with the friendly neighbor cat, Cooper). For a 1 bed/1 bath, the space felt cozy and open, a rare combo. With impeccable attention to detail and plenty of personal charm, this home really felt like a home with enough space for us to really relax, unwind, and settle in. The little office desk looking out to the street on a gorgeous day is the perfect place to get some work done or write a sweet letter. Wish we could have taken the bikes out for a spin; gotta save something for next time! The location cannot be beat if you like friendly walkable neighborhoods within a stone's throw of the big city. We didn't want to leave when the time came but we are so grateful for this first AirBnb experience with Shawn and his charming Craftsman Cottage. "
3053237,46939401,2015-09-14,10768345,Tim,"Such an awesome spot - not only is the place super welcoming, it has a great location & is one of the most eccletic AirBNB's we've ever stayed in. My wife even said ""this is the coolest AirBNB ever!"" - and we've stayed at plenty AirBNB's! Great vibe, decor & record collection to match - would absolutely stay here again, without hesitation!"
3053237,47396267,2015-09-18,38127496,Jon,"Shawn emailed instructions on where the key would be and ""checking in"" was seamless and simple. Shawn left a nice note and the house rules on the counter and the coffee and French presses were tantalizing obvious - no hunt to find them (or anything else). Fresh, organic cream for my coffee awaited me in the refrigerator.

He also left me to myself. I appreciated that very much. I called him once with a question, and he called me once. Perfect.

I love Ballard and Fremont. I lived in each and always consider them  cities in their own right, separate from Seattle (as they once were). Much has changed, but the funky eccentricities of Fremont remain, and it and Ballard are more vibrant and alive than ever. Shawn's home is perfectly located, very near the ""border"" between the two. Shawn provides a great list of the eateries, and of other places of interest.

Getting to and from downtown is a snap (when you visit, be sure to cross the Fremont Bridge, my absolute favorite of the many bridges in Seattle - I used it everyday ""commuting"" from Shawn's house. 

Fremont and Ballard both are still ""working"" areas. That and the population density might cause some to expect it would be noisy and unpleasantly overcrowded. Neither is the case. Shawn's home is a quiet, peaceful and serene retreat. An occasional boat horn or whistle was pretty much all the ""noise"" I heard - the Ship Canal is not that far away. The sounds were enjoyable. The home was a welcome refuge for me each evening.

Cooper finally came over. He is the friendliest cat I've ever met. After a few minutes of petting, he vaulted into my lap and started grooming my chin. Thus we sat, enjoying the quiet evening. He added to the serenity I felt at the little house.

Shawn's home is much like Fremont and Ballard, I think. Art work that is a little edgy and a little eccentric -  among the elements I always liked about the area. Yet his reminders of his best friend showed me a different side of Shawn and they warmed my heart.

I would be happy to stay at Shawn's home again. The outside stairs can be a little tough for those, who like me have some mobility issues.

I loved the place this little house.

3053237,48290300,2015-09-25,14084743,Tim,Perfect spot in Ballard. Walking distance to great breweries and restaurants. The cottage was great. Shawn was a perfect host. Highly recommended if you are looking to check out a cool neighborhood. 
3053237,48684070,2015-09-28,34546851,Ryan,"Shawn was great, a really nice guy who made us feel very welcome. We loved the fresh flowers and friendly note when we arrived. The cottage is beautiful, we enjoyed relaxing on the deck and the bed is super comfy. The guitar was a great touch too! We had a lot of fun. We rode the bikes up the street to a great little espresso shop named Slate. The entire experience was perfect."
3053237,49882241,2015-10-07,38391077,Maureen,This was a great house in a fun neighborhood. Stores and brewers within walking distance. Loved sitting on the deck and just relaxing.  Shawn left us coffee which was a nice touch. Highly recommend this house if you are in Seattle and don't want the noise of downtown
3053237,50540640,2015-10-12,1007057,Crystal,Shawn's place was cozy and comfortable.  It had everything we needed for a great stay.  Shawn is a thoughtful and accommodating host.  I love petting Cooper the cat in the deck too!  Would definitely return!
3053237,51168670,2015-10-18,44742308,Jonathan,Shawn was extremely hospitable and responded to any queries we had in a very timely fashion.  A very cool house in a super fun area.  This cottage provides great access to the wonders of Seattle.  Highly recommend this spot!
3053237,52210564,2015-10-27,36175434,Nicole,"Thanks, Shawn, for the wonderful stay! Your cottage was the perfect place to unwind after a long day of sightseeing. It was exactly as described and we found a ton of great things to do within walking distance. The special delivery of local beer was really awesome. We'll definitely be looking for your house the next time we plan a trip to Seattle! "
3053237,52512198,2015-10-30,28678885,John,Great little house in a fun part of town. Shawn's got a very comfy and clean spot. I hope to go back when I have more time (and better weather) to hang out and enjoy a beer on the deck. Shawn's a nice guy and super easy to deal with. 
3053237,53691729,2015-11-11,597045,Jason,"
Great apartment, plenty of room, and cozy. Plenty of cooking tools and basic supplies if you want to make use of the kitchen. Love the fireplace in the living room! Porch looked amazing to enjoy during warmer weather, but was a bit cold and grey this time of year. "
3053237,54556380,2015-11-21,878914,Kendall,"Shawn's place is great.  The cottage is lovely, I love the modern design  elements and all the space to spread out.  This was the perfect place for a stay in the Ballard area.  Parking was super easy in the neighborhood and the location is close to lots of restaurants and such.  I just wish I had more time to take advantage of the lovely kitchen and to hang out in the sunny living room there!"
3053237,55202077,2015-11-29,26632754,Addie,"Upon our arrival to Shawn's cottage he made sure to be in close contact with all the appropriate info for our check in and stay. We checked in easily and loved the cozy vibes and stylish decor of the cottage. We immediately felt right at home and could not have asked for a better Airbnb experience! The cottage is also located close to great restaurants, shopping, and breweries. Will definitely stay here again when we head back to the PNW. Thanks Shawn :)"
3053237,55596702,2015-12-02,15442208,Michael,"Perfectly located, super clean, great aesthetics to the home. Really can't say enough good stuff about our experience staying here. We walked around te neighborhood every day and Shawn's house was the perfect jumping off point.

Also, big bonus having s great casual book selection on hand. The Washington Ski/Snowboard Backcountry guide definitely made me want to move to the PNW very soon."
92835,280616,2011-05-25,512460,Shaun,Charming character apartment in great location to the city.  Had a wonderful relaxed time.  Host was very helpful with any questions we had and quick to respond.  We would thoroughly recommend this accommodation.
92835,299711,2011-06-06,513442,Travis,"Lauren was very helpful and the place was clean.  She was available by phone when we had questions while we were there. The place was in a convient location and close to everything.  The only down side was parking.  It is $8 for two hours, but there is a parking lot that is around $10 for the whole day across the freeway.  The bed was super comfortable and there is a nice breeze that comes in off the water.  "
92835,313774,2011-06-14,26398,Stephanie,we stayed at the apartment last summer before we went on our cruise. it's a really cute and cozy apartment. really good location and bus stop is right across the street. the kitchen is fully equipped with cookwares and all. we really enjoyed out trip and Lauren was a very good host. 
92835,329695,2011-06-23,377611,Jim & Shari,"Lauren was easy to contact and very helpful in providing directions to her apartment. This made arriving in a foreign city when tired much easier. The apartment is very comfortable and well located with easy access to Pike Place Market, Downtown Seattle, and public transport. The only downside is that there is a fair bit of external noise from a freeway nearby and constant drone from air conditioning units in a building opposite. "
92835,345362,2011-07-01,504660,Emily And Tim,"I absolutely recommend this apartment/condo.  It was affordable, in a safe neighborhood, & a fantastic location.  The building is a bit older- but everything worked well & was clean-this is a great find for the price.  Lauren, the owner was easy to work with- accomodating, flexible & friendly.  I would stay here again.  Thanks, Lauren!
"
92835,356115,2011-07-06,426160,Vera,"It's been awhile since we stayed at Lauren's lovely apartment and I have been quite tardy in posting my review but I think it shows just how memorable and wonderful our stay was that I am still thinking about our time at her place now!. The location was just grand for walking around downtown and over to Pike's Market. The apartment is well kept and provides you with all the comforts of home. Thanks again, Lauren!"
92835,376346,2011-07-16,739778,Jen,"Lauren's apartment was great for us!  It's in a perfect location and was just right for two people.  
There were lots of windows that made for a wonderful breeze throughout.  I will say that with a few windows open, the road noise from below can be kind of loud, but that didn't really bother us.  
The bed was super comfortable and the whole apartment was really clean and tidy.  
Having a kitchen was a great benefit during our trip and thankfully Lauren has all the necessary utensils, dishes, pots and pans available to use.  
Nice building, best location, quiet neighbors, perfect apartment!  
We'd stay here again in a heartbeat.
"
92835,382580,2011-07-19,580781,Hannah,"Such a wonderful experience fom A to Z!  From the reservation process to checkout Lauren was accessible and readily available for all questions.  Her home is in a central location downtown I could not have imagined better.  Very cozy abode, extremely tidy, comfortable and immaculate.   She also left great notes, there were maps and guide pamphlets so we felt well equipped and we love walking so we walked everywhere exploring downtown and several nearby neughborhoods.  Loved Seattle.  Will come back.  Thank you Lauren we thoroughly enjoyed ourselves.  "
92835,394986,2011-07-25,693866,Bronwen,"Lauren is fantastic - - super nice, helpful, communicative, and flexible. And her apartment is amazing - - chic, spacious, comfortable, and perfectly located in downtown Seattle. I would recommend her to anyone and can't wait to come back to Seattle!"
92835,414757,2011-08-02,746014,Ethan,Lauren's crib was excellent. Close to both downtown and the light rail to the airport. Loved it!
92835,420651,2011-08-04,656654,Ashley,The host canceled my reservation 22 days before arrival.
92835,431993,2011-08-09,532323,John,"The location of this apartment is exactly as described – ten minutes walk from Pike’s Place Market and city centre amenities. Although the building is old the accommodation is fine, with a comfy bed TV WiFi and kitchen facilities. Just one thing to note – noise sensitive guests may find the traffic noise on the freeway and the relentless drone of the air conditioning in the office block nearby a bit of a problem.
Lauren was the perfect hostess with a friendly personal welcome, lots of local info and was available for advice at the end of a phone when needed.
"
92835,449791,2011-08-16,759758,Stephanie,"Wonderful little apartment that is close to everything a first time visitor would want to see and visit - the ferry terminal, Pike Place, bus/train/trolley lines, 1st ave shops and restaurants, etc. Plus, Lauren made sure her apartment was super clean and welcoming for us. We would happily stay here on our next visit to Seattle. "
92835,468492,2011-08-23,513879,Camilo,"The apartment has a great location and it is well equipped. Better than a boring plain hotel. Also, Lauren is a great host and very helpful."
92835,479109,2011-08-27,915025,John,Lauren & Seattle were awesome!  The place exceeded expectations especially in relation to its location.  We walked everywhere very easily.  It really felt like we were in the heart of Seattle.  Lauren was very nice and helpful.  She really took great care of us.  Highly recommend Lauren and her awesome apartment.
92835,505951,2011-09-06,338440,Kale,"I went to visit Seattle for the first time with my Fiance who is from there.  We booked our stay with Lauren, this was our first time using airBNB so we had our concerns.  Our worries were quickly squandered and we had a great stay.  Lauren met us when we first arrived and gave us the keys and a grand tour of the apartment and town.  She was very hospitable and the place was cozy and in a great location.  I had groceries delivered by Safeway before we arrived and Lauren was there to receive them and put the all away and in the fridge.  I would highly recommend her apartment for anyone visiting Seattle.  Thanks for everything Lauren."
92835,542225,2011-09-18,924255,Paulina,"We arrived on Thursday evening to a cozy little studio. The host, Lauren Foster had left almost everything in her room to our convenience, with much more amenities than you would except from a hotel at double the price. Everything was as advertised and better - from the speedy internet to the battery of extra towels that Lauren had left us. The room itself is perfect for two, and the location is only a few blocks away from major bus stops and the downtown area in general. Great food and shopping locations are within walking distance. We could not have asked for any more, and would recommend Lauren's cozy little studio to anyone looking to stay in Seattle!

Lauren went above and beyond as a host. As we departed Seattle, we took the Link train to the airport. We realized about two stops away from the airport that we had left a backpack at the station we departed from. Luckily, we knew ONE local in Seattle who happened to be around. If it wasn't for Lauren and her kind heart, we would've never gotten our stuff back. She not only helped us out by going to the station to retrieve our lost belongings, but also shipped it to us the next day. Thank you so much for your hospitality. People just aren't that friendly where we are from! I couldn't believe it. :) "
92835,561074,2011-09-23,733579,Nancy,"Lauren is awesome host, very friendly and sweet!!  Her place is clean and comfortable. Great location for the price - walking distance to everything in downtown. "
92835,581356,2011-09-29,1027822,Matthew,Great apartment in a funky (in a good way) building.  Immediately adjacent to I-5 on the second floor so noise from the freeway takes some getting used to.
92835,597818,2011-10-04,499411,Ana,"This apartment was perfect for me and my two girlfriends. It's not only decorated beautifully, it is also in a great location to public transit stops and downtown shopping. It's about 3 blocks up from a great waffle place called Sweet Iron Waffle that's a must try! And despite its proximity to the 5 freeway, being a light sleeper, I had no problem falling asleep. Another great thing (there are many) was the cabs lined up out front at all hours! Made going out late at night super easy. This place felt like I had come home. And Lauren was so accomodating and made the check-in/check-out process a breeze. If I visit Seattle again, I'm definitely staying here. "
92835,606782,2011-10-07,1200244,Richard,"My wife and I was hoping to get a feel of the metro life of Seattle in this vacation. We were lucky to have come across Lauren's apartment; its central location, vintage building and lovely decor has all quickly made us feel like residents of this city instead of just tourists. Above all, Lauren was a perfect host, welcoming us on a rainy night with cheerfulness, considerate preparations and generous amenities. Thanks Lauren!"
92835,618939,2011-10-11,1093862,David,"Lauren's apartment was comfortable and very charming.  We loved our stay there.  Its location is good, and it's very convenient to go any place in downtown Seattle. The place was clean and surprisingly spacious for a small place.  Lauren was very friendly and she was very welcoming when we came in.  We felt safe during our stay.  We loved our very first airbnb experience through Lauren's apartment!"
92835,631650,2011-10-16,987818,Sharon,"The place was in the perfect location. We had a 1 year old boy too and it was so easy to take him in the stroller and go anywhere. Great space, the place was great and we would definitely stay again.!"
92835,652544,2011-10-22,1218847,Jd,"Lauren is a very warm, welcoming, communicative host who makes herself readily available for any questions or concerns. She could not have been more accommodating.

Her apartment is beautiful and nicely furnished and we enjoyed using the kitchen, television and wi-fi. The location was perfect for what we wanted: something within walking distance of several neighborhoods (easy access to Capitol Hill, Downtown, Belletown and the International District). It was also a short walk downhill to many bus lines.

To make it clear, we had nothing to complain about. However, if you're looking for something that has sites and restaurants and amenities right around the corner, you might be disappointed. Most things are 10 minutes away. Also, if you're bothered by ambient noise (which we were not) you may find it hard to sleep as the I-5 freeway is right out the window. But we had no problem sleeping and forgot about the freeway pretty quickly.

Overall though it was a positive stay. Thanks for everything Lauren!"
92835,656877,2011-10-24,616870,Marcy,"Had a great stay an Lauren's apartment.   She has a very cozy place and was well supplied.  We will be sure to use her place again when we come back to Seattle.  We especially like how close it is to downtown shopping, Safeco and Century Link.   The light link to the airport is easy to get to and Pike Street makes shopping for fresh veggies and Fish.   Thanks for being a great hostess.   Marcy and Kuray"
92835,686131,2011-11-02,547424,George,"I was in town for a humanitarian technology conference that was being held at the hotel right next door to Lauren's place.  Not only was it 1/3rd the cost of the hotel, but it was an awesome, cozy, well decorated place that was the perfect getaway from the hustle and bustle.  Lauren was super friendly and really helpful.  She even offered to help me find fun halloween parties in the area.  If I'm ever back in the area I'd love the opportunity to stay there again."
92835,699217,2011-11-07,1114774,Brandon,Great apartment in a great location! My wife and I were able to walk everywhere we wanted to go. Queen Anne to Capitol Hill to Pioneer Square. Great food and great fun!
92835,785839,2011-12-14,1465783,Kyle,"Place was great, good safe spot close to the city. Had everything we needed. "
92835,790954,2011-12-18,345349,Erik,"Excellent location, host and accommodations - just as we anticipated. Very open and bright apartment. Check out the Hideout bar on First Hill, just east of the apartment a few blocks! Overall - fantastic stay. Lauren is a great host."
92835,812953,2011-12-29,283535,Samantha,"Lauren's place was great - good sized, conveniently located, super clean... had a French press!  A ten minute walk to everything you need - downtown, train...  Comfy bed, taxis outside at literally all hours of the day.  This was really a great deal, considering it's next door to a hotel charging three times the rates."
92835,823030,2012-01-02,1361645,Pamelinda,"Lauren was a gracious hosts, who literally bent over backwards to make our stay a pleasant one. The apartment was comfy and decorated nicely.  We definitely recommend this place to anyone who likes to be in the center of culture and entertainment. Can't wait to go back. Thank you again Lauren! We had an amazing time. "
92835,854044,2012-01-10,1102387,Travis,"Very nice and conveniently located. True it's a bit loud, but earplugs solve that."
92835,862431,2012-01-14,836033,Angela,"I booked Lauren's place for a colleague of mine, and as before Lauren is a wonderful host! She is ever helpful in coordinating booking, answering any questions for your stay, and makes checking out a breeze. Her place truly is in a great central location, and very cozy. Thanks again Lauren! "
92835,867652,2012-01-17,1469032,Sarah,"We had a great stay at Lauren's apartment. She is friendly and helpful (we were wimps against the Seattle cold and needed an extra blanket -- Lauren to the rescue!). The apartment is cute, clean, and in such a good location. Definitely would recommend her place to others, and would stay here again. Thank you so much!"
92835,887091,2012-01-28,1274529,Devin,"Laurens apartment is great.  Its clean and cozy and the bed is super comfortable.  Its also very centrally located in downtown Seattle so its easy to get to just about anything.

Two things to note about the place:

1. The apartment building is right next to Interstate 5 so you can hear the traffic noise.  If you need perfect silence to sleep then this place probably isn't for you.  It doesn't bother me.

2. Since the apartment is downtown there is obviously a lot of light, even at night.  There are no black out curtains (that I saw) so if you need absolute dark to sleep than this place probably isn't for you.  Again, it did not bother me."
92835,904800,2012-02-06,1618976,Lisa,"Lauren was extremely accommodating - meeting me in the middle of a week day of the day to drop of the keys. Her place was super clean, and indeed charming. Definitely a great place to stay while in Seattle. "
92835,913103,2012-02-11,1374875,Dominique,"Lauren's apartment is the cutest little apartment in Seattle! It has the PERFECT location, the most comfortable bed that I have ever slept in and  so much character! Lauren was great, she was friendly, welcoming and was easily contactable if we needed anything. I wouldn't recommend walking from Union Station to her apartment if you have alot of luggage, but I can highly recommend staying in her beautiful apartment! I will definitely stay there again if I am back in Seattle!"
92835,933370,2012-02-20,1649592,Carrie,"Adorable apartment!  Great location.  Lauren was a great host and very accommodating.  If I'm ever in the area again, I'll check her schedule first!"
92835,958303,2012-02-28,1794770,Rhea,"Fantastic stay. Lauren was great from reservation to departure. She got me setup, the place was as-described and super cute. It was located well for where I needed to get to and even better, the hotel next door always had a cab ready to go if I had a further distance to travel. Bed was super comfy. Wifi worked great. I'd definitely stay here again. Affordable, gracious host, and comfortable stay away from home. "
92835,975048,2012-03-06,1516109,Wade,The apartment is very very easy to get to as it's centrally located to all kinds of cool places.  The highway is a bit loud but honestly it was just white noise to us.  The building is old and has its own creaking and cracking sounds anyways.  The apartment is a great basic needs environment for a few day stay.  Lauren has made sure its fresh and inviting.  The shower is a bit awkward but has plenty of warm water.  The best part of our stay was how fast Lauren would text back if we had any silly question.  Oh thanks for the wine too!!!
92835,987491,2012-03-11,1845620,Lara,"A lovely little find in the heart of Seattle. This was our first Air bnb experience, and Lauren made it a great one.. Lots of reading materials left in the apartment so we could learn about the city and Lauren gave us all the help we needed in planning for our trip and once we had arrived, and she was happy for us to call in emergencies!  (sorry about that! :))The apartment is certainly charming as described- Excellent location to explore the city with the number 12 'free' bus that drops you off just outside! Thank you!
"
92835,1031703,2012-03-22,1562743,Sandra,"Lauren was great and the place is just like the photographs.

Thank you Lauren!"
92835,1049908,2012-03-27,1302287,Fritz,"I stayed in the apartment during the last weekend of the month of March, and was lucky to have amazing sunny weather!

The apartment was at a great location, in terms of how close it is to downtown, and all Seattle has to offer. However, some might not enjoy the closeness of the freeway. The apartment is just a short walk from the Library, several amazing restaurants, pubs and bars, and the train to the airport. Pike street is just 3-4 blocks north. 

Lauren was very nice and accommodating. She answered my texts and emails very promptly, and suggested some great places to check out while I was in town. She also lives very close, which is nice in case you need to get a hold of her. I will definitely stay there during my next visit to Seattle!
"
92835,1063190,2012-03-31,1489135,Rosti,"Extremely helpful host! Older building, while not an issue for us, could be for others. Fantastic location! One of the best restaurants in Seattle within a couple of blocks!"
92835,1071972,2012-04-02,679438,Julie,"We loved our stay at Lauren's apartment in Seattle. It was perfect for our weekend getaway, and so easy to get around downtown. The space itself was great for the two of us, comfortable, and easy for us to make meals when we pleased. The books and maps available were a great help as well. 

Lauren was a fabulous host, who answered all of our questions, and we were so grateful when she waited for us to arrive, despite our train arriving much later than expected on a Friday night. Thank you!
We've definitely found a great reason to return to Seattle for more escapes.
"
92835,1093864,2012-04-07,159584,Sean,"We had a great time in Seattle and really liked Lauren and her place. It was roomy and clean with an excellent downtown location.  I think the apartments proximity to I-5 actually helped us sleep better with the white noise of cars buzzing by.  You could even see Puget Sound distantly from one of the windows I think..

Anyways, If you're looking for a good place to stay in the downtown Seattle area we would highly recommend Lauren's apartment.  "
92835,1130501,2012-04-15,399949,Mark,Great location - really close to major attractions and easy access to public transport. It was great to have a 'home away from home' and Lauren was great. Very communicative and always ready to help. To be recommended! Thank you Lauren!
92835,1148022,2012-04-18,1504828,Joyce,"Our stay in Seattle was wonderful, and we appreciated Lauren's warm hospitality.  The location was perfect for the sightseeing we wanted to do downtown, and everything was just as pictured.  Thanks again, Lauren!
"
92835,1180524,2012-04-25,2100800,Natalya,Such a great place to stay. Very cozy apartment with everything you need In there. Lauren is very nice attentive person willing to help you and answer your questions as many times as you need. Her suggested ferry ride to BainBridge island was awesome. I would suggest to rent apt from Lauren.   Thank you Laaren!
92835,1201273,2012-04-30,1683538,Am,"We stayed for a conference. Perfect location, easy walk downtown and to public transportation. Great accommodations! "
92835,1225432,2012-05-04,1854127,Tim,"Had a fantastic time in Seattle, Lauren was very welcoming and helpful. This apartment was very central, only around 5 mins walk to Pike Place Market. I would definitely recommend this apartment."
92835,1247071,2012-05-08,2020502,Sharon,"Lauren's apartment was a really cozy home away from home. Walking distance to everything in the city. Lauren is super cool. She has lot's of great restaurant opinions and she was flexible with our check-out time. There is a constant hum of the interstate outside (as you'll notice on the map, it is close) but have no fear,  it was quickly white noise. My partner and I slept like babies!"
92835,1265140,2012-05-12,1597147,Lerian,"Lauren was super friendly and helpful on our arrival. She had lots of information available on the apartment and she oriented us on the public transportation system. The apartment had a great layout, natural light and airflow. The bed was super comfortable and the living area was spacious enough for both of us.

Our only problem was the bathroom. From the beginning Lauren told us that the last guests broke the toilet cover, so we had to be extra careful putting our stuff in the organizer available so it wouldn't end up inside the toilet. First it sounded kind of funny, but it was a real pain when we didn't have anywhere to put our stuff. My solution: all our stuff stayed in ziploc bags even while using them, or out in the kitchen counters. 

The other thing was the bathtub, problem that we texted Lauren about at the end of our stay and she had knowledge about. The bathtub, while cute, was super slippery. I guess the past guests also dropped something on it. My husband tried to clean it with some products we found in the apartment, but it wasn't enough. Lauren responded us that the house cleaner mentioned it before us... 

So, at the end! Just hope the previous guests are considerate and clean and you'll have an awesome time!!! BTW we stayed on the second week of May, so if you stayed on the first one... It seems you had a blast!"
92835,1291700,2012-05-16,2286769,Francoise,"Truly a charming apartment. Lauren is a wonderful host; very welcoming and helpful. 

The apartment has lots of natural light and is kept clean. Keep in mind that it is close to Interstate 5 so it is a little noisy. "
92835,1339008,2012-05-24,79001,Javier,"Lauren's great apartment is in a terrific location.  I was able to attend my conference, walk to most everything, and catch buses to everything else.  Taxi people, the hotel next door makes catching a cab simple, not an easy feat in Seattle.  Lauren talked to me about the places to go to around the downtown area and had some great advice about wineries worth visiting in the Yakima/Prosser area.  A super host.

Potential guests, there is no reason not to stay here."
92835,1424572,2012-06-06,274378,Michael,"Lauren met us after a very long journey and she was so friendly and helpful, wonderful start to our stay in Seattle.  The apartment was like a time warp, very old, but full of charm.  It had all the comforts and was homey.  It felt like we were house guests, not tourists staying in a self contained apartment.

The location is amazing, so central to all the areas we wanted to see, walking distances to everything.  

Only glitch was taxi driver from airport, who refused to acknowledge the apartment was in the hotel areas of the city and would not give us the set prive, but used a meter.  No big deal, but annoying, hope fellow travellers have better taxi experience but enjoy the comforts of Lauren's apartment also."
92835,1448295,2012-06-10,625130,Colleen,"Lauren's apartment is every bit as charming and stylish as Lauren herself. It's also clean, comfortable, and ideally situated for enjoying a great stay in Seattle. The high ceilings and big windows let in plenty of light (which is nice, seeing as it's, you know, *Seattle*), the couch and bed are comfy and snug, the building is secure and has character. I'd absolutely stay here again!"
92835,1478349,2012-06-14,1984466,Jeanne,"Great location, and Lauren is extremely helpful. I stayed 4 nights in June and felt right at home.  Thanks Lauren!"
92835,1527991,2012-06-21,2020957,Michael,"This was the second time my wife and I came to Seattle.  We stayed in Belltown the first time and wanted to stay somewhere new.  It was a great location, and Lauren was a great host.  Gave excellent suggestions on places to go and things to see and also tried to give you ways to walk to different places to minimize walking up hill.  The apartment was great and made you feel right at home.  "
92835,1564500,2012-06-26,333430,Jared,"Lauren was a terrific host and we had a great time staying at her apartment.  The location was awesome...really accessible to just about everything downtown.  The apartment itself is adjacent to a highway, which definitely adds some 'ambient' noise. This wasn't a problem for me at all.  Her apartment is well appointed, with nice furniture and design touches.  Despite the niceness of her apartment, though, the building itself is a bit run down. The apartment definitely met our needs well though, as we spent most of our days out and about. We looked forward to coming back and watching tv/relaxing after a long day of adventuring.  "
92835,1682624,2012-07-11,2297213,Rachel,"We had a great stay at Lauren's place.  The apartment is really cute and clean.  There is noise from the highway, but it sounds like background, white noise, kinda like an air conditioner (a quiet one).  I can be a light sleeper when it comes to noise and I left the living room window open with no problems sleeping. 
Lauren also leave three towels which was awesome because us ladies need an extra one for our hair.  
Lauren was awesome and got back to me about everything I asked.  She also has Seattle guide books in the apartment, which was really handy.
The only caution I would give is that the apartment is at the top of a hill in the downtown area, so if you are out of shape (or you are thinking about walking with your luggage to the apartment from the monorail) this may suck for you.  Otherwise, had a great first stay at an airbnb property."
92835,1899407,2012-08-06,2463604,Sunana,"This place was ideal for our purposes.  We needed a place to stay near the port before leaving for an Alaska cruise and it was right next to the hotel where the other 16 members of our party stayed but was about 60% of the cost of the hotel.

Lauren is very nice, communicated well, was thoughtful and had great suggestions about places to get a drink or a bite in the area.  The apartment itself is clean and looks just as it does in the pictures.  One thing the pictures don't tell however, is that it is a bit noisy.  I didn't actually mind this, but because it was unseasonably hot when we visited Seattle, all the windows had to remain open and it was a bit like standing next to a freeway the whole time.  So if you must have serene quiet when you sleep, this may not be ideal for you.

It is very convenient to downtown, however be prepared to shell out for parking unless you're lucky enough to stay there on a Sunday and score a public spot right outside of the building.  Parking in Seattle in this sector is a whopping $4.00 an hour from 8am till 8pm Mon- Sat.  That was a bit inconvenient, but nothing Lauren didn't warn us of, so we appreciated that.  The building is a big old and creaky and the lobby smells a little musty, but that's what you get in old historic buildings.  Her place was well appointed and clean, though it does have a clawfoot tub, which for old folks may be a challenge to get in and out of.  Overall, we enjoyed our stay there and have no regrets.  "
92835,1980963,2012-08-14,1125344,Karen,"Lauren's apartment was exactly what I needed during a long weekend in Seattle; tidy, comfortable and super cute decor. The central location is ideal. I was happy there was a taxi stand right in front of the building servicing the Renaissance Hotel next door, really convenient since finding a cab in this city can be challenging at times, especially during off hours.
The only surprise was for me was constant highway noise - Interstate 5 is very close by. I put in some earplugs and was able to sleep just fine!"
92835,2036174,2012-08-20,1469174,Gary,Laurens apartment was situated in an amazing location for getting around Seattle on foot.  Lauren was a wealth of information on the sites of Seattle and very patient when giving us directions around town.  The apartment was spacious and clean and very comfortable.  The only slight drawback was the noise of the nearby freeway.  But we managed to sleep soundly so was not a great problem.  Thanks Lauren for a wonderful stay.
92835,2078173,2012-08-23,190892,Barbara,"Great convenient location in the heart of the city.. Apt was nicely decorated and clawfoot tub especially appreciated. There is some street noise, but I didn't mind, I'm used to living in cities.  bed was comfortable. Lauren was responsive and thoughtful. "
92835,2087460,2012-08-25,1262522,Marie,"Had a lovely stay at Lauren's place. The apartment feels very personal and homely. The wifi worked well. And had the best sleep ever on that soft bed. Lauren was very welcoming and helpful but in no way intrusive - we only saw her once! The location of the apartment was ideal for our needs, though it's at the top of a very steep hill. If you get lazy or tired there's always a line of cabs just outside the apartment block. Would highly recommend a stay here. Cheers Lauren"
92835,2131323,2012-08-28,3355667,Kristin,"This cozy apartment is in the middle of downtown Seattle in a ""vintage"" building tucked amidst hotels and very near the new Seattle Public Library. It is directly across from I-5, so there was quite a bit of road noise, but after a while you just tune it out. The bed was comfy, the kitchen and bath were immaculate. Lauren helped work out picking up a key at an odd hour - thank you, Lauren! All in all, it was a lovely place."
92835,2212604,2012-09-06,1572515,Candi,"We were first time visitors to Seattle and staying in Lauren's apt. was a PERFECT fit to our big city experience.  It is an extremely charming 1900 century apt complex in the middle of downtown, within walking distance to all the major tourist attractions (except the Zoo).  The studio apt. clean and so cute with a cheerful urban feeling to it.  There is even a view of Puget Sound from one of the living room windows on a sunny day and a stunning view of Mt. Raineer from Madison St. if the fog is lifted.  The local traffic and nearby Freeway did add some noise, but truely, it hummed me to sleep at night.  Lauren greeted us with friendliness when we arrived and made sure we had everything we needed.  She wants you to have the best experience possible.  Thank you again Lauren for allowing us to stay in your cozy apt!  We are already planning our next trip."
92835,2236720,2012-09-09,2423980,Denis,"My wife and I enjoyed a very pleasant stay at Lauren's apartment in Seattle . The apartment was very neat and tidy, spacious and had  pretty much everything that we required. It was well located to the sights of Seattle and the commercial centre and getting around on the free bus service , which literally stopped outside her apartment , made our stay even more enjoyable - Lauren was a gracious and warm host and provided us with all the information we needed to see the city in the 3 days we had with her. Lauren thought of everything - she provided us with an excellent supply of brochures and a bookshelf of good qualities books on Seattle and other interesting reading material. We enjoyed our stay with Lauren and would repeat the experience should we be in Seattle again. Lauren was also kind enough to post on a pair of glasses that we left in the apartment . Denis & Angela - melbourne Australia "
92835,2266522,2012-09-11,3395415,Noah,"Lauren was incredibly accommodating as my fiance went ahead to Seattle. She was able to check in fairly late with no hassle and when I had the opportunity to join up, we were easily able to book an extra night. I hope we get the chance to stay at Lauren's great apartment again. It's very centrally located. A great place to stay if you want to be downtown. Though you are right next to the freeway, it never seemed obtrusive. "
92835,2295128,2012-09-14,3529474,Ryan,"Great place, perfect location, very friendly.  Highly recommended."
92835,2295506,2012-09-14,3395415,Noah,"Lauren was very accommodating even when my fiance had to check in later than expected. After staying their two nights, my fiance easily added an extra night and I came up to Seattle to join her. Lauren's apartment is in a great location if you want to be downtown. I highly recommend it. The apartment is adjacent to the freeway, but it's not that noticeable with the windows closed. If you're looking for a change of pace from the average hotel, Lauren's place should be at the top of your list. Once your trip is over, it's easy access to the freeway to get out of Seattle."
92835,2307755,2012-09-17,3160165,Brian,"Lauren's flat is a great place for a city break. It is very very central, easy walking distance to anything in the downtown area. As a tourist or a business visitor, it would be pretty great. 

It is located along the edge of the freeway, so there is traffic noise. The nice thing is that it is consistent/constant, so it becomes a bit like white noise in the background. 

The set-up of the flat is nice - while the bedroom doesn't have a door there is a definite sense of separation from the main living area. There's not a desk or a dining table, but the arrangement is really pleasant. "
92835,2332762,2012-09-18,1689998,Brian,"Lauren was flexible, helpful, and pleasant.  The apartment was as advertised. Great overall experience.  "
92835,2353304,2012-09-20,3106312,Nicole,I had such a wonderful time staying at Lauren's place. Her apartment was in the perfect location and was quite homey and comfortable. Lauren was very accommodating and helpful. I couldn't have asked for a more pleasant experience. I will definitely stay there again the next time I'm in Seattle!
92835,2388895,2012-09-24,2597924,Martin,"Great place to stay if you want to experience downtown-Seattle! 
Lauren was a very friendly and supportive host.

"
92835,2462287,2012-10-01,2701462,Stuart,"Lauren was very helpful by email after we had booked and was there to meet us when we arrived. There werea number of brochures etc about the region to assist us.

The apartment is adjacent to the freeway and easy to find and is reasonably close to the Pike St Market, major shops, and Chinatown.

We live in a city centre so the the noise of the freeway and the carpark exhaust fan nearby was not a problem to us, but it may disturb some. 

The apartment was clean and the bed was very comfortable.

There were however three aspects of the apartment which disappointed us.

One was that we felt as if we had been called in at short notice to house-sit. There were lots of partly cosumed items in the frig and the  host's coats were on the coat rack, her suitecases were under the bed and her medicines were in the bathroom cabinet. 

Another was the lack of some basic items. Kitchen utensils were sparse; for drinking there was one wineglass and some non-matching tumblers, and we had to buy a toaster. There was no dining table or chais so we ate at the coffee table or standing at the kitchen bench.

Thirdly the bathroom was off the kitchen which is not ideal, and the showere was over a freestanding bath with curtains on all sides and consequently very little room for showering.

Overall the apartment was reasonable, but not great."
92835,2511171,2012-10-05,2941516,Kim,"We really enjoyed our stay in Lauren's apartment.  The location is fabulous.  We were able to walk to most of the things we wanted to do and when we did need to catch a taxi there were always plenty right in front of the apartment.  Lauren was great and the apartment was really clean.  I noticed that some other reviewers mentioned noise, but that wasn't a problem for us at all.  We found out during the first night that the heat didn't work, but Lauren was kind enough to track down some space heaters for us so our stay was very comfortable.  I'd definitely  recommend staying here.  The location can't be beat and we really enjoyed having a full kitchen. "
92835,2556377,2012-10-09,2898295,Megan,"My first airbnb experience was great! Lauren's apartment was in a fantastic location--close to the downtown attractions, a block away from multiple bus lines, and there's a cab stand in front of the building. The apartment was comfortable and had everything we needed. Lauren was a great host as well. She's very personable and responsive and gave great recommendations during our stay. She made sure we had everything we needed and the process for checking in and out was very convenient and quick. There is a little bit of noise from the highway by the building, but it didn't bother us because we're used to a little city noise. 

Special thanks to Lauren for a fun first visit to Seattle! Hope to be back soon :) "
92835,2596877,2012-10-13,2179253,Zachary,Great apartment and location.
92835,2609864,2012-10-14,3828379,Nealy,"Wow! My first experience with Airbnb was perfect! Lauren responded to my request to stay in her adorable apartment in minutes and she was there to help us get to the place from traveling through heavy traffic and tricky parking. She was so friendly and accommodating! I would stay again in a heartbeat! Thanks Lauren
Nealy and Fenix"
92835,2661777,2012-10-20,3261588,Kylin,"Just got home from Seattle and had a great time.  The apartment was just what we were looking for.  It was very centrally located and walking distance to many things, including Pike's market, the international district, and the sports arenas. At first we thought is was in a questinable area but actually it is right next store to a very highend hotel which made getting a taxi very easy.  It is close to a very busy highway, but the noise wasn't a problem at all.  The apartment is at the top of a very steep hill so we worked off all the calories that we accumulated sampling at Pikes market.  The bed is amazingly comfortable.  We used the Link Rail system to get there from the airport it only cost  $ 2.75 each, much cheaper than about $30 for a taxi.  Lauren clued us into that and it worked well. If you have heavy suit cases you may want to grab a Taxi from the Link station to Lauren's place because it is several blocks straight up!  Lauren was very helpful when we needed additional towels.  She was always available via phone or Text.  There is no counter space in the bathroom so bring a toiletry bag that you can hang from the back of the door and you won't have any problems.  There is a very nice drug store just one block down and you can even use the escalator in the amazing library(make sure you check it out)  to make your climb back to the apartment a little easier.  Also Lauren recommended the restaurant  named Purple it is only a couple blocks walk and was great!  Thanks Lauren for everything.   Kylin"
92835,2682274,2012-10-22,3583887,Leif,"This was our first booking with airbnb, and based on our experience, we look forward to using this valuable resource on future trips.  

We really enjoyed the central location and Lauren's hospitality, especilaity her flexibility with our flight arrival time.  The second floor apartment is perfect for the active explorer.  We walked to Seattle Art Museum, Aquarium,  Pike's Market, and had a lovely picnic in the nearby Freeway Park with yummy sandwiches and european sodas from from the nearby George's Deli.

 The apartment is well lit and we enjoyed the vintage building and decor with the great ventilation the windows provided- especially while cooking.  The antique clawfoot tub is nice for a relaxing deep hot soak after a day in the city.   The kitchen is well equipped for a nice blackened Alaskan King Salmon dinner after foraging for ingredients at Pike's Market The new City Target and Kress Supermarket are also walkable as well as some nice pubs and fine dining.  Kress has a nice selection of prepared foods and  local produce at reasonable prices.  We took the train from the airport and were happy without a car.  This is a very walk friendly city with easy to use public transport.  We also took the bus to the Flight Museum- another must see.   I would also recommend Fran's chocolates downtown for a nice steaming cup of hot chocolate using single origin Venezuelan chocolate made to order with local organic stamed milk. Easy to take a break at Fran's on the way to the museum or Pike's.  Britt's pickles adjacent to Pike's Market is also a gem - live culture kim chee and pickles the old fashioned way. We liked the extra hot and ginger flavors.  On a different visit- dont miss the black licorice ice cream across the way from Britt's. 

 Indeed, Seattle is a foodlover's paradise and Lauren's place is a sure bet for a home base that will help you to stay fit while walking off all the indulgences. We would be delighted to return.  

Enjoy your stay!"
92835,2786400,2012-11-02,3202112,Judy,"Lovely apartment close to the City Centre including the rail system and light rail to Seattle (Seatac) Airport. Everything provided including a very comfortable bed.
A very friendly and hospitable host who went out of her way to make us welcome."
92835,2799319,2012-11-04,1564828,Hagen,"Quaint apartment, ideal central location in Seattle. Lauren was really helpful with getting us settled. The apartment was ideal for our short stay, although its location close to the main road network made for noisy nights. If you are looking for a good nights sleep bring ear plugs, because the constant humm of the loud traffic (all hours) made sleeping difficult. The apartment is in an older style complex, which at a guess its between 50-70 years old...so its looking a bit tired. Laurens place had all the stuff we needed, for example being able to walk down to Pikes Market and grab some delicious fresh seafood and groceries and then come back to the apartment was perfect. Tip for first time visitors to Seattle, if you plan to walk to Laurens from the public transport and have luggage, then be warned the up hill hikes can be exhausting. All in all Lauren's place was ideal for our needs, the photos (while not misleading), dont quite show the place's age and wear n tear. If you are looking for a comfortable place that is really close to the city at a great price (gets b+ for value for $) then choose Laurens!"
92835,2831511,2012-11-07,3931627,Macy,"Lauren was promptly responsive in advance of our booking, providing a lot of helpful info. And she stayed in contact and was readily available prior to and during our stay, which was awesome. The location, price and privacy were the real benefits.

The 4-star hotel next to the apartment booked rooms starting at $220/night, so this was a great bargain. And the concierge there was super helpful. The downside was trying to find affordable parking nearby. 

This space is great for a homebase if you're on the run and don't require a great deal of comfort or cleanliness. The bed and sofa were less than comfortable, and there is no dining table or space to eat, other than the sofa/coffee table. The small bathroom has no counter space, nor a full mirror, and there is a weird shower curtain setup for the claw foot tub.  Due to the central location, there is constant noise from the freeways. This building is 100+ years old, so expect the cracks and grit that comes with the history.

I would recommend this space to singles on the go, but not to couples seeking a comfortable retreat or to girly girls like me who need an adequate bathroom space and spotlessness. 
"
92835,2846896,2012-11-09,579582,Scott,"Lauren has a great apartment that is in a convenient location in Seattle. Many local attractions are walking distance from her apartment, which is nice. And, you can expect a nice workout from walking around due to the hills of Seattle :-) Lauren had great communications as a host. Checkin was easy and the apartment itself is a spacious 1 bdr space."
92835,2861588,2012-11-12,2862125,Jen,"We loved our stay in Seattle.  The apartment was located in the downtown area, perfect for getting around without a car. Lauren was great about answering all of our questions, both before we arrived and after.  We thoroughly enjoyed our stay.  As others have mentioned,it is close to a highway so you need to expect highway noise.  Also, there is a lot of light that comes through the blinds at night. That being said, we found the apartment to be just what we were looking for.  Lauren is a gracious host and a delight to work with when making arrangements.  We will definitely stay here again when visiting Seattle."
92835,3004971,2012-12-01,4250692,Walker,"I really liked the apartment. It is the kind of unit in the kind of building that I would choose to live in. Lauren went above and beyond for me this trip. She was really incredibly helpful, available and accommodating.
Thank you!"
92835,3013039,2012-12-03,3792992,Matt,"Lauren was very nice, helpful, and knowledgable. The apt was clean and well appointed, excellent location in the city. We spent the weekend here and only used public transportation one time and were still able to see so much of the city. Recommended. "
92835,3041115,2012-12-08,1314857,John,"Had a very really good stay at Lauren's place.  Nice charming old apartment building.  Convenient location to Links rail, tourist sites and food.  As mentioned by lot of reviewers, bit noisy so bring your earplugs if you are a light sleeper and eye mask as not much cover from the curtains.

Advice to travelers:  If you have a lot of luggage, suggestion is to take private transportation or to store it at the airport as this place is around 4 blocks uphill from Pioneer Square Link station.  Recommend Underground Tour if you like historical sites and interested in Seattle's history.  Also Elliot's Oyster Bar for USD0.75-1.75 each oysters from 3-6pm!
"
92835,3051515,2012-12-09,528601,Kim,"I had a great time staying at Lauren's place. It was completely immaculate and cozy! It was so easy to get everywhere I needed to be because it is in such a great location! And Lauren was super accommodating because I needed to check in early and she was very quick to respond whenever I had any questions. I will DEFINITELY contact Lauren the next time I plan to head back up to Seattle!
I highly recommend Lauren's place.
"
92835,3080103,2012-12-12,3106312,Nicole,"Lauren's place is absolutely perfect and I will continue to stay there every time I'm in Seattle. It's a great size, in a great location, and Lauren is flexible with my needs. Such a great find on airbnb. "
92835,3097743,2012-12-16,1568953,Brighton,Lauren is the BEST! Beautiful apartment and great hospitality. 
92835,3441417,2013-01-30,1933965,Kelly,"This was my first experience with airbnb and I really enjoyed it. Lauren was fantastic-makes you feel very welcome. The location is perfect. It's even super close to a drug store and a Y. If you're a member in another state, this Y honors that and you use it for free! The building and area felt safe, the apt. was warm and water was hot! There was even beer in the fridge! There are definitely some tough hills getting here from the train station but it's good exercise if you're up for it. The traffic is a constant like other reviewers have said but I wasn't bothered by it. I'd definitely recommend staying here on your next trip to Seattle."
92835,3488541,2013-02-06,4685060,Anna,"Lauren was a very nice host and we had a lovely chat when arriving late. she is very flexible with checking in and out. the apartment is as shown on the pictures, the only downside is that is really noisy due to the indeed very central location. Since this was our first time in Seattle, we didn't know better but we would probably stay in another neigborhood the next time where it is a bit more quiet and more going on. 
however the place is a great deal. "
92835,3533461,2013-02-13,1587882,Phil,"I had an amazing 5 days at Lauren's place. Lauren was very communicative, she was there to meet me upon arrival and was such a lovely host. 

The room is exactly as in the  photos; clean..well presented and smart. The location for me was perfect too - very central.

i noticed a few people reviewing didn't like being so close to he main road - but it was not a problem for me I had a great sleep each night. However I do live in a city so perhaps I'm used to the sound of traffic.

Overall i would highly recommend Lauren's place. And the price is amazing."
92835,3582243,2013-02-19,3481613,Eden,"We had a great time staying at this apartment. It is very charming and perfect for a couple to base out of in Seattle. The high ceilings make it feel spacious. The location is great and within waking distance of everything needed. It is near the freeway so there is highway noise at night but normal for a city apartment. We didn't have any problems sleeping. Lauren is awesome - super friendly, accommodating and very responsive. Will definitely stay here again!"
92835,3627078,2013-02-26,1604593,Gabriela,"Lauren was really friendly and accommodating and the place is in a great location of the city making visiting quite a breeze. It was enjoyable to stay here! Place was small and perfect for what we wanted, at night it was chilly but the space heaters did their job!"
92835,3648559,2013-02-27,4996035,Jeff,"Lauren was an amazing host for our short stay in Seattle.  She was very responsive and extremely easy to communicate with.  She went out of her way to make sure we were comfortable during our stay.  

The images of her place are very accurate, and it was very clean and tidy when we got there.   We really enjoyed the layout and the amount of space we had.  It was nice being able to buy a few things at the convenience store a couple blocks down and being able to store it in the fridge while we were there.  Her place seems very safe and secure, as it is on the 2nd floor and her building requires a keycode to enter the lobby.  

Her place is also a great launchpad into the city.  There are bus stops all around her apartment that take you anywhere you'll need to go.  There are also taxis waiting nearby (because of an adjacent hotel), so direct access to a specific location is very easy. 

I could not recommend Lauren and her place enough.  We will definitely be back next time we are in Seattle!"
92835,3686199,2013-03-04,679438,Julie,"This was our second time staying at Lauren's apartment and it won't be our last. We love it here, it's comfortable and close to many things in the downtown core."
92835,3848865,2013-03-20,5345162,Lutz,"Lauren was a great host and very accommodating. This was my first Airbnb experience, and she made it a great one.  Definitely would recommend her place to others, and would stay here again. Thank you so much!"
92835,3930969,2013-03-28,2904137,Elizabeth,"Lauren is great and was quite flexible about meeting our schedule to get us the key.  She told us places to go nearby and seemed in general like a wonderful person.  The place is right on a major roadway though so it was loud in the apartment.  I had trouble sleeping the one night we stayed because the cars and trucks on Interstate 5 kept me up.  Falling sleep is generally not a problem for me at night, so if you are a light sleeper this might not be a good spot for you.  Good location thought and close to a lot of places to visit & eat."
92835,3999661,2013-04-02,5034691,Olivea,"We were somewhat disappointed by Lauren's apartment. It is in a very central location, six avenues up from Pike Place. it is accessible via the light link, where you get off at the university street station and walk up a few avenues. However, it is across from a highway so it does get really loud. Lauren is a lovely host, providing us with instructions as to the use of the apartment. The apartment is also next to the Renaissance Hotel, so you can use their concierge services for suggestions around Seattle. What we found most upsetting was the apartment itself. Based on past reviews, we assumed it would be in a cleaner state. The wood floors were sticky, paint chips off the wall, the refrigerator is full of expired products, and the mattress is lopsided where one side has much more cushioning than the other. Also, the mattress frame creaks really loudly any time you sit on it. The apartment building itself also has a mild dingy feel, despite the presence of a pass code to the building and the use of an elevator. The space is also really cold as there is no thermostat that you can control, so you are reliant on space heaters. There were minor gaps in the window so cold air is let in, and my husband had to try and fix it with plastic wrap. The front of the microwave was really oily, and the shelving above the toilet in the bathroom is very wobbly, so any time you put anything on it the shelf will shift back and forth. The bottom of the shower curtains is also really dirty, as it touches your feet while you shower. Overall, we are happy with Lauren's hospitality, but her space is not as charming as she had advertised. "
92835,4045032,2013-04-05,5456101,Kit,"This is a nice location apartment, good for city walk to Seattle Library, Art Museum, Pike Market and Waterfront.  Seattle Center is easy access by taking Monorail. We have good stay there."
92835,4071881,2013-04-08,3710330,Jonathan,"Lauren's place is refreshing.  So comfortable.  It is a cozy place to come home to after a day of galavanting about, or a relaxing place to bunker up in to wait out poor weather.  Lauren had great communication, was flexible, & offered great tips & suggestions about Seattle.  We were lucky to stay there & would recommend anyone else to stay if they have the opportunity.  "
92835,4191570,2013-04-17,3504846,Katie,"Lauren was very easy to communicate with and met us outside the building which made things very easy. Yes, the apartment is next to a major roadway, but every review says that so if you go in prepared, it's a great place to stay. Transport is very convenient. Make sure you have quarters for the laundry. There is no change machine down there! Be warned, the apartment sits on top of a hill, so if you anticipate walking everywhere, be prepared for that! Great location though. "
92835,4300571,2013-04-26,695992,Adam,"This apartment was exactly what I was looking for in Seattle! Great location downtown, and Lauren was really easy to collaborate with to get me settled. Overall awesome experience, and I'd definitely stay here again next time I'm in town,"
92835,4402090,2013-05-03,4812847,Helena,"We enjoyed our stay at Lauren's . Her place is exactly like in the pictures. It was very cozy. We chose to spend more time resting in her apartment than going out to (website hidden) was really relaxing .  we appreciated her fixing the place up to make it look nice and warm.

We had no problems with regards to the ""highway noise"" that her previous guests complained about.. We came prepared with earplugs but never got to use it. Her bed was really comfy. We slept really well.

She was also really sweet in providing extra heaters for us ( without us asking)as she was worried about us not being used to the cold coz we come from a tropical climate. 

Lauren was always quick to answer our emails during our stay. She's really nice and she pleasantly answered all my random questions prior to our stay. "
92835,4454216,2013-05-06,5752008,Steven,"It was my first time in Seattle and after spending a few days there I can confidently Lauren's apartment is ideally located to everything you want to do in Seattle. The apartment is clean, spacious, and well-kept. 

Lauren is extremely responsive and attentive. Will definitely be back at Lauren's next time I'm in Seattle!"
92835,4566041,2013-05-13,3187260,Bobbie And Pat,"Lauren was very responsive to all our questions prior to arrival,met us within minutes of our arrival and got as well situated.  The room was as described, in an older building, clean cozy apartment that was very centrally located.  Parking was a little bit of a challenge especially on Friday but we were able to find parking thanks to Lauren's suggestions.  We really enjoyed our time there.   "
92835,4719803,2013-05-21,698521,Alex,"Amazing place to stay - very central and easy access to the highway!!

Lauren is an amazing hostess! Dropped off extra towels for us and very accommodating to some of our special requests as well!

Thanks again Lauren, will definitely be back next time we're in Seattle!"
92835,4771336,2013-05-25,225035,Drew,"I absolutely loved The Dover, I mean... I just loved it! It was everything I was dreaming of and much more! Catching up with Lauren after a long 12 years was great, too.  If you don't come to Canada you owe me $20. Oh Lauren...I miss you already. 
Lauren's apartment was grand! Beautiful old building, wonderful original hardwood floors, cute little kitchen but more than enough room to prepare yummy meals. A very clean bath with everything you need to doll yourself up. Oh Lauren...how did you know? The Dover was very central. Walking distance to the train station if that's the way you're arriving. Also very close to the freeway if this is your point of entrance...not to worry though, it doesn't make a difference when it's time to go to beddie bye. The Dover is also walking distance to Pike Place Public Market (A MUST), along with the original Starbucks, restaurants and grocery stores. Any questions or concerns you may have, Miss Foster is only a text message away. Seriously...she's in my top 5 now.
Can't wait to come back to Seattle. BFF, Lauren...one love."
92835,4887025,2013-05-31,5018879,Joanna,"A nice little space that's very close to downtown. We didn't get to meet Lauren, but she did make herself very accessible by text & phone, we never felt neglected! "
92835,4906040,2013-06-01,6109752,Sarah,"Lauren was great! She was flexible with our late flight, left refreshments for us in the refrigerator, and was very helpful. Her place was nice, clean, and close to attractions. I would definitely stay with her again. "
92835,4962851,2013-06-04,2926637,Sonya,"Lauren's place is in a great location, and she is an awesome host! She met us there, and gave us a lot of good tips like times when spots are less busy, places to eat, local hangouts, and how to get around Seattle. We really appreciated her hospitality!"
92835,5043048,2013-06-09,6603152,Michael,"Lauren was an exceptional host and the location and setting were perfect for all we wished to see in a short stay.  Great value, great location.  Mike and Judy Macfarlane"
92835,5225412,2013-06-19,5299659,Chris,"Lauren and her apartment are great!  Really nice place and location where you can walk pretty much anywhere you would want to go in Seattle.  Really easy to deal with, and all communication was very straight forward and super friendly.  Thank you!"
92835,5275099,2013-06-22,1221569,Solange,"Lauren's apartment was wonderful and close to all the places you want to be.  
Lauren was a great host offering suggestions for my stay in Seattle.  
I'd gladly stay again in her apt!!!"
92835,5391456,2013-06-28,3946240,Kathryn,"Laurens apartment was so much fun! Being right in the heart of the city made it easy for us to, walk to Safeco Field to watch the baseball, walk to the Seattle Centre to be total tourists for the day, and also find a local pizza joint and wine store where we could chill like ""locals"" for the night.

Lauren was a fantastic host - she even went to the bank to fetch us quarters for the laundry. Lauren has a very artistic flair to her furnishings….I loved her hipster apartment!

We would for sure stay again and again!"
92835,5672603,2013-07-11,5368726,Jenn,"Lauren made our stay in Seattle fantastic! The apartment is exactly as pictured, clean and in a great location. Would definitely recommend and stay again!"
92835,5748790,2013-07-15,5642090,David,"We never got to meet Lauren she was busy and so were we. But everything was where she said it would be and she replied to my questions. She was helpful with information on the best stop to use and route to get to the Apt. from the light rail line. The place was as pictured and had lot of travel guides and helpful information.   There was even beer in the fridge which was very much appreciated since we got in late.  This central location is good and our experience was also good. One thing summer visitors should note is there does not seem to be any AC in this Apt.  This wasn't an issue for us during our stay and I believe that Seattle rarely gets above the mid 80s but the week prior to our visit it did hit the 90s for several days and we couldn't help but think that this could have been a bummer. That kind of heat combined with fact that the Apt. Bldg. is situated next to the freeway could mean some tough noisy stuffy nights for sleeping with the windows open.  The amount of freeway noise coming from through the single pane windows even when they are closed was something we are not use to and frankly I'm surprised others haven't mentioned it. Finally if you plan to cook and eat in there is no dining table to eat at.  This probably is Nit- picking since we never did eat in but potential guests might want to take note of these things. As I said our experience was very good and I would stay there again because of the central location. Here are some notes about Seattle:  If you plan to walk, downtown Seattle has very steep hills. As far as the best places to eat, drink, buy food and package goods my advise is travel away from the water.  For example if you want to get breakfast and return to the Apt I would suggest you head east on Madison across the freeway to the The Corner Cafe it's at Madison and 10th I think.  The walk is up hill but it's not steep.  This a hospital area and is seems safe especially during the day.  If you head further east and north you will find a very Bohemian area adjacent to Seattle University where there are many more locals than tourists. This is the area where the First hill neighborhood and Capital hill neighborhoods meet this roughly at at 12th and Pike."
92835,5881463,2013-07-21,5507053,Kelly,The apartment was great! We even cooked some of our meals there during our week stay. Lauren was very helpful and easy to work with. My husband and I would definitely recommend her and her apartment to anyone staying in Seattle. 
92835,5969208,2013-07-24,6820460,Willem,"We had a good time in Lauren's appartment, that is truly perfectly located in the middle of all Seattle's attractions, if you don't mind a bit of noise from the freeway. Lauren is very easy to communicate with. The laundry room was just what we needed at this moment in our travels."
92835,6099686,2013-07-30,4942048,Chloe,"Lauren was a fantastic host.  She communicated well with us prior to our arrival and greeted us with a smile when we got there.  Lauren was happy to give us lots of information about Seattle and seemed happy to be available to questions throughout our stay.

The apartment was wonderfully sized and well presented.  Though a little dated and 'well used' in parts it was clean and provided us with all of the things that we needed.

The apartment is located at the top of one of Seattle's wonderfully steep hills but overall is very well located and helps to work off all of the cities amazing hot dogs!

A wonderful stay and an apartment that is worth recommending.  "
92835,6170374,2013-08-02,6041543,Sarah,Lauren's studio apartment was in a great location to get around the city.  Lauren was reliable and friendly.  The apartment had everything we needed.  I would stay there again when in Seattle.  The only suggestion to future guests would be to be aware that the apartment is adjacent to the fwy so it is a little bit noisy.
92835,6298370,2013-08-07,1397318,Kyle,"Fantastic location for a Seattle tourist.  Very walkable to many sights.  It also has access to lots of public transportation, and is only a few blocks from the last stop of the light rail from the airport.  We didn't rent a car, but parking in this neighborhood might be tricky.
Lauren was very accomodating.  The apartment was a great size and very nicely furnished.  I'd recommend this place and Lauren to anyone looking for a great central spot in Seattle."
92835,6415447,2013-08-12,5542477,Leisha And Corey,"My partner and I stayed at Lauren's place in early August 2013 and loved it! It was just like having our own little apartment in Seattle! Easy to get to everywhere we needed to go! Close to markets, cabs, trains and easy to walk everywhere! Lauren was great, she answered any of our questions and made check in really easy! We loved the way the place looked and felt, it had a great vibe. It is on a main road but that didn't bother us, despite the fact I am a very light sleeper I didn't have a problem sleeping! We loved our time at Lauren's and wished it was our own place haha! 
Next time we come to Seattle we will stay with Lauren again! 
Thank you! 
Leisha and Corey :) "
92835,6502715,2013-08-14,8047994,Ashley,"We had a great time at Lauren's place.  She was super helpful in meeting up with us and giving us some great dinner recommendations.  The apartment was very cute, clean, and well kept up, just like the pictures showed.  "
92835,6512330,2013-08-15,3628075,Kate,"We had a short but great stay at Lauren's apartment. She was kind to wait up late for us to arrive , since our train did not get in until after 10:30pm. The apartment was clean and comfortable, with many charming decorative touches. Lauren was also very accommodating about letting us check out late. I wish we had been able to enjoy it longer! Thanks, Lauren!
"
92835,6595650,2013-08-18,4815770,Ravi,Lauren was awesome! She was very accommodating when I was arriving later than expected in Seattle and was very welcoming when I finally arrived. Her place is great and feels very homey while also being right in the city. She lives in a great area to walk around in. I would definitely come back and stay again. 
92835,6890747,2013-08-29,1965727,Tracey,Lauren was super accommodating and the location was perfect.We're city people so we didn't notice the car noises people were talking about.  Apartment is nice and open and located right next to a hotel so there were always cabs - although we were able to walk most place (even up and down the big hills).  Lauren was available to help answer a couple questions and even let us store our luggage for a bit as we took advantage of a later day flight back to LA. Our stay was for 4 nights in late August (a great time to visit Seattle).  Thanks Lauren - hope to be back in that city soon!
92835,6959128,2013-09-01,7037535,Larry,"Working with Lauren was great, very quick to reply and went above and beyond for us. The place itself was perfect for us, exactly as described/pictured. 

Great location, we basically parked our car in a nearby garage and didn't touch it until we checked out. Had I known, I probably would have returned the car earlier and relied on public transportation to save myself a few bucks (both on the car rental and parking costs, which unfortunately can be expensive for the area).

As others have noted it is quite close to I-5, and there is road noise. This wasn't a problem for us, it is basically a constant ""grey noise"" in the background and actually kind of soothing for sleep. But I guess very light sleepers should look out. Also there is no washer/dryer in the unit, we didn't need it but maybe it was in the basement of the building or something.

If we are ever in Seattle again, we certainly would not hesitate to check if this place was available."
92835,7032502,2013-09-04,5855510,Lynda,We needed a place at the end of our trip to accomodate ferry/plane schedules.  Lauren graciously took us in for a single nights stay.  Please see our previous review for details about the space.  Lauren will go out of her way to make your stay comfortable.
92835,7113526,2013-09-07,6064784,Megan,"Lauren was a fantastic host, she really went above and beyond. Her apartment was very well located and the perfect size for my husband and me. We were able to walk everywhere. Next time I am in Seattle I will stay here again. "
92835,7133165,2013-09-08,5855510,Lynda,"Lauren and her very cute, clean, and very conveniently located apartment were a good fit for my husband and myself. Lauren was very hospitable, friendly and eager to help make our trip as nice as possible.  The apartment is in a very old building with exposed pipes, a clawfoot tub, very high ceilings and darling bay windows. Very cute!  It's on a very busy, noisy street corner. As others have stated it is noisy. So bring your earplugs and if you forget, Lauren has them in the medicine cabinet!  We were very happy that Lauren has the place wired with cable TV and WiFi.  There is a full kitchen, and if you must have Starbucks, the Renaisannce Hotel right next door has the full on coffee and treats every morning. The hill is steep, but you can avoid the steep streets (Marion, Madison and Spring especially) by going up Seneca or University from downtown, then go right on 6th to Marion.  So, if you don't need shiney and modern, and enjoy a bit of history stay at Lauren's place at The Dover, a 100 year old building with ton's o' character and a gracious hostess."
92835,7215085,2013-09-11,4022764,Jacqueline,"Lauren was so helpful and very easy to communicate with! The pictures don't do her place justice. It was just what mum and I needed. The location is ideal, step out the front door and there are taxis (hotel right next door), short stroll to the pier and pike place market. A block away from the Columbus Center to get your sky deck views. Plus, it has an elevator, laundry, and wifi, anyone who is traveling will appreciate! 
So much more then a hotel could ever offer.
Lauren was more then accommodating and would not hesitate to recommend this place to anyone!"
92835,7237228,2013-09-13,5595302,Sandra,"Great location, easy walk downtown. Characterful apartment in charming old building. Nearby freeway noise can be a bit obtrusive but earplugs can fix that. Lauren is a charming and helpful host and provided lots of useful information for our (3 day/2 night) visit. We have no hesitation in recommending this apartment."
92835,7596636,2013-09-26,6055879,Liz,"We stayed in Lauren's apartment in Seattle for 12 nights in September 2013. 

The apartment is lovely - plenty of space for two, comfortable, well-maintained and stylish. There are some lovely touches: a good selection of maps and tourist guides, some books, a clothes rail so you're not living out of suitcases. The kitchen was well-equipped and had some provisions already in place (tea, milk, bread, pasta).

The location is great - on the edge of downtown so an easy walk to all the main tourist attractions, the stadiums and the business district. It's also very convenient for heading out into different parts of Seattle, whether on foot or on public transport. We hadn't realised quite how hilly Seattle was though!

Lauren was a joy as a host - really communicative when we made the booking, ready with a great smiling welcome after our journey, an anglophile, and a soccer fan. We got on so well, we ended up watching early morning soccer on TV together :-) Nothing was too much trouble and Lauren was really responsive to any requests we had while we were there.

Other visitors have commented about the noise, and I'm afraid that I have to as well. It was the only thing that was not perfect about our stay. We were at least fore-warned about it. The freeway is very close and the noise is pretty constant - think of the sound of a waterfall (it helps to picture one when you're trying to go to sleep!). Earplugs make all the difference though :-) For those visiting in the winter, the freeway seems quieter when it's been raining....!

If you're a good sleeper - or a night owl - don't be put off by the noise issue. The apartment is so great that it's worth the inconvenience. We'd love to go back to Seattle and, when we'll do, we'll be getting right back in touch with Lauren!"
92835,7641960,2013-09-28,7442077,Brittany,"Lauren was an awesome host. She met us when we got into town and gave us great recommendations on where to go and eat. Her place is in a wonderful location for exploring downtown, the international district and Pike's Place Market. We would definitely stay there again. "
92835,7688691,2013-09-30,616870,Marcy,As always Lauren was a gracious host.   Met us at the door with open arms and hugs.  We love staying with her.   Wish we could get over more often.  
92835,7825230,2013-10-05,432671,Carolyn,Great location & great host!
92835,7942133,2013-10-09,7823954,Chari,"We spent a ""just right"" night at Lauren's place this week.  Only needed lodging for one night, Lauren's was both cost and size-appropriate.  It's neat, clean, has it's own special charm about it.  Lauren was a great and accommodating hostess, meeting us out front, making sure we had all the information we needed for our stopover.  She's a wealth of information about the area.  And, should you require, she made parking available for us - a HUGE plus in this neighborhood.

Be cautioned - Lauren's place is across the street from I-5 (a major highway).  My s/o slept great, me a bit less so until I scrounged a pair of earplugs from the supply in the medicine cabinet.  But other than that,  we couldn't have asked for more and would be more than pleased to stay there again."
92835,7974061,2013-10-10,7862593,Mary,Easy. Clean. Charming. Well organized. Best of...city life.
92835,7985645,2013-10-11,7380049,Audrey,"Great location, close to everything! The apartment was clean and had everything we needed for our short stay. Lauren was incredibly accommodating. We only wish we could have stayed longer!"
92835,8040588,2013-10-14,5035870,Robin,"The apartment was just as described -- pretty decor and good location for my needs. It was easy for me to get to the attractions, and it was an extremely comfortable layout. Lauren met me and made sure I was comfortable. She was a lovely host and offered tons of resources to enjoy my stay.
If you are not used to cities, you might find the noise from the highway a bit much, but to me it was just white noise.  "
92835,8147175,2013-10-18,5240700,Brian,"Lauren's place was great. She was an excellent host. This is best demonstrated by the fact that I never actually met her--instead, my Dad, who arrived before me, met her and accepted and returned the keys. As he is not airBnB or even internet friendly, I had serious concerns about him being able to handle it, but Lauren made it very easy. 
A few have commented on the freeway noise--I actually thought it was a great background of ""white noise"" that helped me sleep better. Also, her bed was comfy!"
92835,8249568,2013-10-22,5601048,Mike,"Lauren's apartment was the perfect spot for mw on my latest trip to Seattle. I had business at the convention center, and it was a quick 5 minute walk from the apartment. It's also a quick 15 minute walk to the King Street train station. And the excellent Seattle library is one block away. The apartment itself is very comfortable, clean, nicely decorated, and has all of the amenities you should need for your stay. Lauren also has a good supply of information on Seattle available in the apartment, like guidebooks and maps. The wifi worked like a charm. Great selection of cable TV channels. I wound up arriving in Seattle earlier than originally planned and Lauren was very accommodating. Overall a great spot to stay in Seattle. I'd love to come back."
92835,8296959,2013-10-24,9041339,Laura,"Lauren was super helpful in our stay. From beginning to end she was very communicative and responsive. Her flat was just what we needed,cosy and clean and central to all the best things about Seattle. With regards to the city traffic noise it was constant white noise in the background but easy to get used to. You don't expect to stay in all day on vacation anyways. Her dinner suggestions were excellent . Thanks again Lauren."
92835,8341651,2013-10-26,4830449,Shelly,"Lauren was gracious and accommodating, we loved our stay!  Her place is the perfect size, very charming decor, and a very comfortable bed!  The highway noise was not as bad as some others have mentioned... it's really just white noise.  Very central, walkable to everything.  It was a blessing to have parking as well.  "
92835,8364846,2013-10-28,7289508,Amy,"Our stay was wonderful. We wanted the unique experience of living like a native of Seattle, rather than doing the usual hotel thing. We loved having an entire apartment to ourselves. We highly recommend booking with AirBnb & especially with Lauren!"
92835,8439543,2013-10-30,9620341,Jasmin,"Lauren was amazing! The place was lovely and a great location! We had a car but we pretty much got everywhere we needed to go just by walking. Was nice having your own ""home"" while visiting a new city. Would definitely stay again. Thanks Lauren!"

92835,8720830,2013-11-13,9692451,Ji Hyeon,Her house was clean and really near the downtown of Seattle. Bed was comfortable. She is kind. I and my friends really love her house. 
92835,8752465,2013-11-16,3554060,Erik,"I definitely recommend this unit in Seattle. Lauren was a great host and was waiting for me outside the building when I pulled up (even though I was late). She also coordinated finding me a parking spot for a reasonable price. The unit is very centrally located, clean and nicely decorated. I had everything I needed and was comfortable and pleased throughout my 3-day stay."
92835,8814303,2013-11-19,8974028,Paul,"From the time I inquired about her place till the day I was leaving Lauren was very accommodating and friendly over text and in person. Her place was amazing. Close to everything, and very cozy! I would stay again!!!"
92835,8968261,2013-11-29,9431378,Michael,Lauren and her place are great.  I got held up at the airport but she waited for me.  The location is great to do anything in the city.  I would stay here again in a heart beat.
92835,9067944,2013-12-04,3490858,Carina,"I had a great time at Lauren's apartment. I didn't get to meet Lauren unfortunately because I arrived on Thanksgiving, but she left me detailed instructions on how to get to and into the apartment and left some snacks for me to ""survive"" the first day. Also, even though she was away, I could reach Lauren during text and e-mail at all times and she was quick to respond to all questions.
The apartment had eveything I needed, great place to come back to after a day exploring. And I loved the bed! :)"
92835,9102863,2013-12-07,9926494,Rick,"Lauren was super accommodating, the apartment very clean and centrally located to just about everything you could want to do. I would definitely stay here again if I head back up to Seattle. "

I screwed up the check in time (somehow 1pm became 11am in my head) and she still met us, gave us the lay of the land and let us stash our stuff in her apartment so we could grab lunch while the cleaning crew finished up our place.  She even loaned us her uber nice air mattress complete with comfy, warm bedding for our stay.  

The apartment building is very secure with keyed outside entry and manned front desk.  It's also located an easy walk to everything you'd want to see in downtown Seattle, bus lines and the monorail/light rail.  The building was just designated as an historic place, so if you're looking for brand spanking new, this is not the spot.  But if you like awesome buildings with gorgeous high ceilings, crown moldings and a ton of character, reserve your spot now!  Comments about the road noise are true, but it didn't bother us - just turns to white noise after a bit.  But there is a nice box of earplugs in the bathroom should you need them!

I look forward to staying again on my next trip to Seattle!  "
92835,9452038,2013-12-29,6095061,Mireille,Lauren was fantastic! The apartment was beautiful and in a great location. Walking distance to many major attractions in Seattle. The space itself was cozy and clean and we had no problems at all. Lauren gave us great recommendations of places to eat and go. Would definitely recommend a stay with Lauren and will do it again on my next trip to Seattle! 
92835,9794041,2014-01-10,3039610,Jarrod,Great location to downtown. Lauren was more than accommodating. Unfortunately we were late getting flying in and Lauren went above and beyond staying up and helping as getting settled in. Look forward to coming back to Seattle again soon. Amazing host.
92835,9889755,2014-01-17,10436687,Jade,"As previous guests have already mentioned, Lauren's place is in a good central location, perfect for getting about to key tourist spots in Seattle. The apt itself was very comfortable, although there were some minor issues regarding accommodations, (i.e. shower was blocked up and would not drain, and there was no toilet paper)  
I would have rated it five stars if not for these issues, as everything else was perfect! Overall pleasant stay, and I would recommend this place to any first time Seattle goers. "
92835,10018012,2014-01-26,11021513,Patrick,Lauren is a wonderful host and this apartment is perfect for a business trip or a visit for fun.
92835,10068580,2014-01-28,2421560,Angie,"Lauren was a GREAT host! She met us at the building and gave us a tour, we chatted about hosting and she gave us some food ideas.  The apartment was close to the Public Market, shopping, and waterfront areas which we enjoyed very much.  We had a wonderful time during our first trip to Seattle and it was wonderful to expand our airbnb family! I would recommend this place and definitely stay here again! Thanks, Lauren!"
92835,10129402,2014-02-02,8233798,Melissa,"PROS: For the price, this apartment was amazing! The hotel next door had rooms for $300 a night. It's about a 15-20 minute walk to the Pike market and a 15-20 minute walk to the Capitol Hill are. The fact that the hotel next door constantly had taxis out front was also a plus. Wi-fi, cable TV and a full kitchen for this price definitely can't be beat. Lauren was nice and down to earth. The apartment was nice and well furnished. 

CONS: Not sure if the apartment was fully cleaned before we started our stay here. Also, it took a little long to get our towels, we got there in the morning but didn't get towels until 10:30 at night. That said, we are aware that this isn't a hotel and that Lauren is probably a busy person. This was our first time using air-bnb so I'm not sure if this is the norm. Also, the radiator leaks, which wasn't too big a deal for us, just an unexpected small pile of water in the morning.

OTHER NOTES: The freeway noise. It didn't bother us at all, but I can see why it would bother other people. It never woke us up in the middle of the night or anything, but if you're a light sleeper it might. We usually like to have some white noise while sleeping so it was perfect. Also, the cable got a little spotty sometimes, but honestly we weren't there to watch TV. 

CONCLUSION: We had a great time and this was a great place and we would definitely stay here again. I would definitely recommend this place."
92835,10246383,2014-02-09,3112508,Mona,"I was in town for a conference and had a great stay at Lauren's pad which was conveniently a few blocks from the convention center.  She was responsive to requests and even left a few elysian brews in the fridge for us *delicious*.  I was there during an unusually cold week so it did get a tad bit chilly for a southerner like me.  But, Lauren dropped off an extra space heater which definitely kept it warm in her apt.  "
92835,10495268,2014-02-22,3474781,Jamie,Lauren's apartment was great. Super clean and had everything I needed for an amazing stay in Seattle. It was in the perfect location to get downtown for work and also close enough to get to capital hill for bars and great restaurants. I saw everything I wanted and Lauren's place made it easy. 
92835,10573872,2014-02-25,1588008,Tania,"My aunt and I came to stay at Lauren's place for three nights in Seattle. The location couldn't be beat and the apartment had everything we needed! Lauren was very responsive and set up the queen size air mattress for me prior to our arrival. It was very comfy to sleep on. It's a lovely character building and the apartment has a clawfoot bathtub and big bay windows. There were a couple of environmental factors that can't be helped - the apartment faces the I-5 so there is traffic all the time, and there are streetlamps right outside so it's bright at night (I always sleep with an eye maks and earplugs and I slept right through every night) - but these wouldn't prevent me from staying there again. Also, it could be a bit chilly (older building, one-pane windows) but there was a space heater there to address this. The towels were fluffy, kitchen well equiped and because of the extensive cable TV network we got to watch the last Downton Abbey on Sunday night! Walking distance to everything downtown - Pioneer Sq., Pike Place Market, shopping district, Seattle Art Museum, etc. I'll be sure to stay there again in the future!"
92835,10675965,2014-03-03,10610738,Jennifer,"Lauren's apartment was a lovely alternative to the many hotels that are very close to the Washington State Convention Center, which was the site of a conference I was attending. It's within walking distance to the conference ctr, to the Market, to the train, as well as so many other great things to experience in Seattle (but, I'm a crazy walker, so take that for what it's worth!) For those who aren't crazy-walkers, right outside the front door of the apartment building is also a line of cabs awaiting fare, should you need one! The apartment building might give some people pause (it's older and a bit run-down from the outside/lobby, and the lobby kinda smells like cats, truth be told), but it is secure, and Lauren's apartment is clean, adorably decorated and has everything you need for a very comfortable stay. I loved to be able to get away fromt the sensory-overload of the conference I was attending and walk back to the apt., just to relax, take a nap, do a bit of reading. Be aware that the freeway is literally right outside the windows, and traffic roars past at all hours of the night—I wasn't bothered, but some might be, if peace and quiet is your thing. Lauren is incrediby accessible, returns messages with lightning speed, and literally means ""Please ask!"" if you need anything at all! I loved staying here—it was my first airbnb experience (and first visit to Seattle!) and it was a wonderfully memorable one! I would definitely stay at Lauren's apartment again, and highly recommend it, for a unique, comfortable Seattle experience!"
92835,10772669,2014-03-06,1635884,Ray,Awesome location really close to everything. Enjoyed my stay and Lauren was really accommodating. Thanks. 
92835,10844989,2014-03-10,7582525,Claire (Ching-Ling),"My bf and I went to Seattle after our Aurora journey. 
We just want a homey place, which really downtown and easy to get around.
And this is it, the charming apartment of Lauren's.
"
92835,10974322,2014-03-16,4725879,Nicole,"Lauren was an excellent host and her apartment was beyond fantastic! She took plenty of time to greet my boyfriend and I to ensure our stay would be everything we were hoping for. Not to mention her apartment is just a short distance away from everything we wanted to see and do. For instance, you can walk to Pike Place Market and the International District, just to name a couple of places, and if you're not into trekking the extremely hilly terrain of Seattle (Lauren's apartment is at the tip top of one of the biggest hills - I learned this the hard way!), you can take the bus (there is a bus stop right in front of the apartment building) or catch a cab (there is a hotel right next door, so there are always cabs available at all hours of the day and night). Plus, the bed is SUPER comfy and the freeway noise that other reviewers have complained about is not a huge issue; it's really not that loud. It actually helped to put my boyfriend and I to sleep! Overall, I would recommend Lauren's place to anyone looking to stay in a safe, well-located, and stylishly decorated apartment."
92835,11052030,2014-03-18,6234973,Claire,"Lauren is so wonderful! She was a great host, was always in communication with me and often asked if she could do anything else to help me. Her apartment is beautiful, clean and centrally located. We would definitely stay with her again!"
92835,11167816,2014-03-24,5187037,Elena,"This apartment is indeed charming and so central; we never needed cabs or transportation anywhere except to sadly return to the airport and leave Seattle.  It is right by the spectacular public library, close to a ferry dock for travel to the nearby islands, and surrounded by great places to drink coffee.  Lauren was an excellent host. The apartment is, however, right next to a large interstate, so depending on your relationship to traffic noise, you might want earplugs for bedtime."
92835,11287177,2014-03-28,13079161,Ben,"Lauren's place was perfect for our 3 day stay in Seattle! Great location to walk around downtown, pikes place, and catch the ferry boats. I would definitely recommend this apartment for anyone looking to have great location for a Seattle stay.,"
92835,11341947,2014-03-31,679438,Julie,"This was our third time staying here and it's our go-to for Seattle visits. Lauren is a fantastic host, always understanding and easy to contact. We love the cozy apartment, and it makes us feel like we're in a home away from home with each trip. 
"
92835,11495335,2014-04-05,5136929,Amelia & David,"David and I loved our stay at Lauren!  Not only is she a wonderful hostess but also her place is amazing for a fun visit in Seattle. Everything is walking distance from it, the apartment is bright and cozy, absolutely fantastic for 2 people!

Thank you for having Lauren!"
92835,11535958,2014-04-07,4736284,Nicole,"Lauren was a great host. The apartment was perfect for the two of us. It was a little loud being next to the highway, but other than that it was great.  Awesome time. Would definitely stay again!"
92835,11726424,2014-04-13,2159611,Philip,"I really enjoyed staying in Lauren's apartment. It was very central, clean and tastefully decorated. You are next to the freeway, but I didn't find that it made a difference to anything - I slept just fine. I'll definitely come back the next time I'm in Seattle."
92835,11742939,2014-04-14,10874285,Jimmy,"Lauren was such a hospitable host. She was timely in her response, answered all our questions and was very accommodating during our stay. Her place is very quaint and a perfect spot to begin your exploration of Seattle. It's a close proximity to the Link, Pioneer Square, and Pike. Make a good decision and stay here."
92835,11892210,2014-04-18,6049107,Lindsay,"Great Location and just what we needed for a short trip to Seattle.  Warning that if you are allergic to cats, I had an allergic reaction just from the hallway...but the apartment was tidy and clean.  Lauren was prompt and helpful in every way...could not have asked for a better host! "
92835,12212842,2014-04-26,13268261,Matt,"The apartment on 6th Avenue and Marion St is well located for those without a car.
Though it is situated on the top of a hill it can be reached by walking up 6th from downtown without too much effort.
There is a nearby taxi ramp 24/7 so transport is not a problem if you are without wheels
The apartment itself is well presented with comfortable furniture and most important of all with a most comfortable bed.
The kitchen is full of supplies left by previous travelers, so make sure you check out this situation as you can save some money by using the foodstuff in the cupboards
The open plan apartment is light and airy and well appointed with lamps.
It is on a corner near a busy road but I had little problems with sleeping
I was a solo traveler but think two people would fit into this place without too much effort
Lauren herself goes out of her way to ensure that all your questions are answered and you couldn't ask for a better landlord .
Would recommend this place without any problems"
92835,12547335,2014-05-05,9205813,Cindi,Lauren was an excellent host! The apartment was exactly as described.  A good tip is to use the resources of the hotel next door.  We printed out our boarding passes and used the shuttle that left from there to airport for $18. They also had a great breakfast and the view from RView lounge was beautiful.
92835,12670618,2014-05-07,5006843,Amber,"From our first communication Lauren was great! Super quick to reply and very accommodating to my specific needs for my stay :) finally upon meeting her I was not disappointed! She's a very gracious and generous host! 

The place was super cute and comfy. Also has a nice location and home feel! I would definitely recommend it!! 

Thanks for all!"
92835,12762187,2014-05-10,3156026,Ashley,Lauren was fantastic and so was her apartment!  We loved our stay in Seattle and her apartment made it that much better.  We would love to come back and stay here again!
92835,12832235,2014-05-12,5884184,Patrick,"Staying at Lauren's apartment was great!  My partner and I were able to make ourselves right at home, and Lauren even gave us some tips about nearby restaurants, sites, etc.  We had dinner at RView next door (Lauren's suggestion), which has an amazing view of the city and excellent food/drinks.  As others have noted, you will hear cars on the highway but there are earplugs provided just in case you need them.  Comfy bed and a really nice apartment.  Easy walk downtown and transportation is a breeze.  Highly recommended!"
92835,12920809,2014-05-14,10705809,Young A,Lauren was such a nice host! She has done everything to make my stay better.  Place is in great location-Walkable to everywhere in downtown. One thing you need to consider is.... Like other guest said since it is near by highway it might be noisy but for me it didn't bother.
92835,13059936,2014-05-19,7580673,Judy,"Lauren is a very hospitable hostess. The apartment is accurately described, perfect position for down town activities, shopping, eating out. Would not hesitate to stay in her apartment again. Light, bright, very well equipped with every day necessities, just like home."
92835,13180662,2014-05-21,5441243,Joe,"We really enjoyed our stay at Lauren's apartment. There was plenty of room and it's really comfortable space. The location was ideal for us as we were new to Seattle and were only there for two nights. So everything we wanted to see was within walking distance. Lauren was a fantastic host. On our arrival she was very welcoming and friendly. She gave us a great insight into Seattle and some top tips for places to visit on a flying visit. 

Overall really happy with our stay and would very highly recommend Lauren's apartment to anyone. A great host and a great apartment. Thanks"
