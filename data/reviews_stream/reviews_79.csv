7636185,56101845,2015-12-08,2762776,Jessica,The cottage was a very nice place to stay. Very cute and cozy and situated close to lots of restaurants. Angela was very nice and made us feel at home. 
7636185,57138067,2015-12-22,31473343,Matt,"This is by far the best experience I have had with this app. I had a great time at Herman and Angela's home. The house was well stocked to accommodate my lifestyle of cooking at home. 

I will assuredly be back. "
7636185,57400713,2015-12-25,20317449,Daryn,"Absolutely loved this cozy cottage. Angela was so welcoming and attentive. If you have any questions or concerns she is available. The cottage itself is comfortable and has anything you could possibly need. Can't recommend this cottage enough. Close to the light rail, a great a cafe, and restaurants. Will definitely be back. "
7636185,57637578,2015-12-28,4546600,Kari,"The Cozy Cottage was just as described and easy to locate. We found Angela and Herman to be pretty laid back and very responsive. 
The wi-fi reception was good and, being even though it was a pretty cold few days outside, we stayed plenty warm and cozy in this cottage. Would happily stay here again and recommend to others. "
3963320,18854904,2014-09-01,2873934,Lily,"JD was an excellent host!!  We really appreciated that he left a detailed letter that covered everything we needed to know.  He gave us information about the apartment (how to work heating/cooling, where the laundry room was) as well as great recommendations for places to go in the area.  His location is absolutely perfect in Fremont!  Steps from all the good commercial things (restaurants, bars, grocery stores, coffee shops) and close to multiple buses that go downtown.  We especially liked passing the Troll on our way to get coffee each morning.  The apartment was spacious and comfortable.  In particular, the shower was awesome, great pressure and plenty of hot water.  Thank you for your hospitality JD, we had a great weekend visit!  We loved enjoying the bottle of wine and chocolate on your balcony."
3963320,22341205,2014-11-03,22663774,Allie,Had an amazing weekend with friends in this comfortable apartment! The location was perfect. Thank you so much JD!
3870937,18157997,2014-08-22,1406740,Shoshana,Wonderful experience. I booked on short notice and Ivan was very responsive. The cottage was beautiful and easy to access. Very comfortable.  Slept great.  Would stay again without a second thought. Thank you Ivan!
3870937,18838590,2014-09-01,3852801,Barbara,"We spent the Labour Day weekend at Ivan's cottage in a lovely residential neighbourhood in Seattle. Ivan was a  great communicator and we had no problem finding his house in NE Seattle. The place is ultra clean and well equipped for a family of four (queen bed in a bedroom and a double pull out couch). Everything is new -- furniture, towels, sheets, quilts, etc. The kitchen is really well stocked. We made breakfasts each morning and saved a lot over cafe food. Downtown Seattle was especially busy this weekend with the PAX conference, Sounders and Mariners games, Bumpershoot and cruise ships.  Ivan's quiet, cosy cottage is very nice to come home to after a busy day in the city."
3870937,19003164,2014-09-04,3135299,Miruna,"We had an awesome stay in Seattle and Ivan's cottage was definitely a part of it. Located in a quiet and charming residential area, the place is spotless clean, cosy and chic inside and has a beautiful terrace where you can enjoy the hilly view and the cutest squirels roaming on the fence every now and then. There's also a driveway where we could park - it's an ideal place if you have a car. Otherwise, an Uber ride downtown is about 17 dollars. We didn't use public transportation, but there are buses around. Ivan was the kindest, most attentive and responsive host one could wish for - we were in contact via email during my stay and he was checking on us and always offerring his assistance if we needed anything. An excellent experience (many thanks, again), highly recommended!"
3870937,19230439,2014-09-08,795576,Olivier,"Nice and plesant place to stay outside Seattle.
Quiet neighbourhood, good amenities. I strongly recommend"
3870937,20292123,2014-09-27,18280104,Mervyn,"The cottage was exactly as the picture.  Ivan was very accommodating, he even agreed to store our luggage before checking in as we took a weekend trip out of Seattle.  The cottage is very comfortable, and the 
location is excellent for families visiting UW.  Additional plus point is the gated parking in front of the cottage."
3870937,20535271,2014-09-30,13119295,Linda,"Ivan's Urban Cottage by the Lake was comfortable, very quiet and well outfitted for my weekend stay.  The pictures do not do it justice.  It is about 10 minutes from the University of Washington and only about 5 minutes from Top Pot Donuts! Right off the Burke Gilman and close to Matthew's Beach. I am always cold when I visit Seattle, so I will also mention that the heating system warmed the cabin up very quickly.  I highly recommend this Airbnb location!"
3870937,21322105,2014-10-14,17691416,Sarah,"I've stayed in 8 rentals in the last few months and Ivan's was the best. It is modern, clean, private, quiet and has everything you could possibly need. The photos don't do it justice. The kitchenette has high-end appliances, the wifi is excellent, and there are French doors on one wall and a sliding door on the other to let in loads of light and air. The small property is fully fenced and has a private driveway. This was the first rental that allowed me to sleep deeply and feel completely at home. Ivan was very accommodating, friendly and respectful. The only drawbacks I could point out are the bed is very firm and the bathroom sink is very tall (I'm only 5', so I washed my face in the kitchen sink :)), but neither of those things was a big deal. Thanks, Ivan!"
3870937,21627919,2014-10-20,22290128,Curtis,"I did not meet Ivan, but he was available through email or text for questions, etc.  The cottage was just as described - very clean and comfortable, and pretty kid friendly.  We found everything we needed was there. The location was good.  Secluded, private feeling setting in a quiet neighborhood with good driving access to UW area, various parks, and everything north of downtown Seattle in general.  Highly recommend. 
"
3870937,22917487,2014-11-17,2408634,Brendan,"Great stay at a great price for the location - so close to lake Washington and Matthews Beach.   Did not see Ivan in person but he would return my text messages/emails instantaneously.  Very clean, comfortable space.  "
3870937,25217369,2015-01-09,14411175,Christopher,"It was a real pleasure staying at Ivan's place. His place was clean and it had all the amenities for a great stay in Seattle. Moreover, it is quick access to downtown, while being situated in a quite neighborhood. Ivan also made sure we were well taken care of. The stay was awesome."
3870937,26118589,2015-02-03,26698545,Laurie,"This was a great, private and quiet in-city stay. Perfect for someone that is looking for a place to stay away from the hustle and bustle. Really close to the water and walking/biking trails. The cottage was great. Loved the full kitchen. We know Seattle well so we didn’t really need any help, but Ivan was very responsive and easy to coordinate with. Very flexible with scheduling too. I booked fairly short notice and asked to check out an hour late. Thanks for making our stay comfortable, Ivan! We’ll definitely stay again if we have the need! "
3870937,26760222,2015-02-18,17971383,Chelda,"The stay at Ivan's cottage was one of the best experiences using air bnb. The location was quiet, the cottage was clean and cozy, and extremely accommodating.  There were 4 of us and we all fit comfortably. Ivan was a terrific host and very responsive to our needs.  I'd choose his place again when returning to Seattle. Loved it!"
3870937,26995453,2015-02-23,19411738,Kathryn,"This little cottage is a perfect in-city get away. The neighborhood is quiet and the cottage is very well appointed and comfortable, with a full kitchen, laundry facilities, and a fantastic bath tub. The host, Ivan, checked in with us when we arrived to make sure we were comfortable and that we had everything we needed. The cottage is located within an easy walk of Matthews Beach Park and the Burke-Gilman Trail and is an easy drive to the U District or really anywhere in Seattle. I would absolutely recommend this cottage as a great getaway spot for any occasion."
3870937,28258599,2015-03-21,17369903,Melanie,"The Urban Cottage by the Lake was an ideal setting for a private, quiet and relaxing stay.  Ivan provided many unexpected kitchen amenities that made preparing my own meals a breeze.  I was unable to figure out how to fully operate the television which I found a bit frustrating but other than that I loved the location, and the pillows on the bed were fabulous.  I rested better there than I do in my own home.  I hope to be invited back when next I travel to the Seattle area."
3870937,28735252,2015-03-29,12813698,Sarah,"This little cottage was a great fit for us.  It was clean and was stocked with the things we needed.  It was nice to have directions provided to the nearby park which is walking distance away.  Also, the property was easy to find.  I would recommend this place for a small family or couple."
3870937,29557316,2015-04-09,19871318,Amber,"The location, private fenced driveway, stocked kitchen, and ultra clean premises was perfect.  We used the grocery store directions and appreciated the great communication both before and during the stay.  The bed was super firm as was the couch.  We would have to bring an egg shell next time.  Our two year old needed a handrail to get down the stairs safely.  We also loved the patio.  Thanks for everything.-A"
3870937,32586667,2015-05-19,14192544,Katie,Ivan was a great host! He politely checked in with us to make sure we arrived okay and that we had everything we needed. The cottage was impeccably clean and comfortable. We really like the location and only being a short walk to Lake Washington and the Burke Gilman trail. We would definitely stay here again and have already recommended it to other friends/family members! Also great to have a washer/dryer.
3870937,34624409,2015-06-10,28927434,Chris,The cottage was just as depicted and made for a great stay in Seattle!  Everything was very clean and the house was well stocked with supplies.  Matthews Beach was just down the road..the neighborhood was very quiet and there was easy access to nearby highways.  Perfect location for our visit with family in Seattle and we have already recommended to other family...thanks Ivan!
3870937,35975429,2015-06-23,11952515,Johannes,"We stayed in Ivan's cottage for 4 nights and we had a very nice experience. The size of the cottage was adequate for a family of 4. Compared to any other properties that I have rented through Airbnb, the cottage was probably the best.

It is located in a safe residential area. You can easily park two cars in the parking lot.

Onsite laundry and the internet were also useful for us. Even though there's no cable, but the TV offers various kinds of programmes.

Overall, I rate this 5/5. "
3870937,36325387,2015-06-27,35920419,Margaret,"I actually live in Ivan's neighborhood and reserved his place for my mom and aunt visiting from out of town.  Ivan was very responsive with information about the place, and texted on check-in day to make sure we had gotten settled.  The cottage itself is just as pictured--thoroughly clean, modern, and cozy.  It had every convenience you could want.  Normally I book my mom and aunt a nice hotel downtown when they come to visit, but they told me they would much prefer to stay at Ivan's again if it is available!  They loved the pleasant, homey environment, and the ability to stretch out and make their own meals.  My kids loved running around outside the cottage and playing on the deck, which they normally don't get to do when they visit their Nana at a hotel.  This location is just a few blocks from Lake Washington and a short drive to downtown.  The neighborhood is safe, good for walking and biking (right off the Burke-Gilman trail), with lots of trees and greenery."
3870937,36607625,2015-06-29,4344335,Rick,Great location and a clean space. Ivan was helpful in making sure everything was good to go and provided all the necessary logistics beforehand. I'd recommend staying here if you want to visit Seattle and not be in the hubub of the city.
3870937,37138412,2015-07-05,28090370,Chance,"This a nice little cottage for a visit. We knew it would be on the small side for us (family of four), but there was still plenty of room. The pictures show exactly what it's like. The area was nice and it was very easy to get around Seattle with this as our home base. Matthew's Beach is just a 5 minute drive away and has a roped swimming area as well as a floating dock and a nice park area. Even in traffic, we were able to get everywhere we needed to go in 30 minutes or less.
We didn't have the opportunity to meet Ivan, but we did communicate many times during the trip. Unfortunately, we were in Seattle during a ""heat wave"" (I'm from Atlanta, so I was skeptical that it would be really hot. The temp outside was fine, bu the temp inside - whew!). This meant that the cottage was super-hot since the sun comes up at 6am and shines on it until 9pm! However, we talked to Ivan and chased down a portable A/C unit which he kindly reimbursed us for before we left. We were really grateful to be able to cool down! As mentioned in other reviews, the bed and couch are very firm. It was great having a full sized washer and dryer since we got to pack less. There are lots of little things in the kitchen that make it easy to cook your meals (like salt! I've stayed a lot of places that didn't have a salt shaker.). We had a great time, thanks so much."
3870937,37774649,2015-07-10,16277568,Daniel,"We had a wonderful time in this heaven of peace. Very well located near the lake, a small and kid friendly beach nearby. We spent 4 days with our two young kids, they loved to play in the garden. The house was very clean , with all the amenities. The neighborhood is gorgeous, plenty of trees, etc. I definitely recommend this house. "
3870937,38063078,2015-07-12,1436910,Kathy,"We loved staying at Ivan's place. It was clean and had everything we needed. Perfect size for a small family.  The location is awesome. Easy walking distance to Mathews beach which also has a playground. The neighborhood is quiet and safe. Parking in the drive is great. The fence was being worked on during part of our visit, so we couldn't park there, but street parking was easy.  Ivan was really hospitable and did everything he could to make sure our stay was pleasant. Communication with him was very easy. We'd definitely stay here again!"
3870937,38824338,2015-07-19,29579973,Edward,"Ivan's place is a perfect little hideaway in a great neighborhood close to Lake Washington, downtown and most of Seattle. It only took us about 15 minutes to get everywhere we wanted to go in the area. "
3870937,39223551,2015-07-21,139336,Brenda,"Ivan's cottage was perfect for us. Just blocks from Matthew Beach on Lake Washington, quiet street, near groceries and gas, and a 50-foot driveway which allowed us to park our camper off the street. Easy access to I-5, so the Fremont District and the ""back way"" to Pike's Market was all simple. Very comfortable house, nice kitchen, portable A/C unit that we could move between the livingroom and bedroom. Liked having laundry facilities. Ivan is fast to respond to e-mail and great to deal with. We will definitely stay there again.
"
3870937,39408105,2015-07-23,36218428,Letty,"Great experience from start to finish. Easy check-in and check-out, clean accommodations and nice location about 15-20 minutes from downtown. Loved having kitchen and washer/dryer. Would highly recommend. Wanted to give 4 1/2 stars but it wasn't an option. Thanks Ivan!!!"
3870937,39760263,2015-07-26,33845618,Dmitry,"I was surprised by how carefully Ivan have prepared the house for his guest. Everything you can think of - in the kitchen, in rooms - was there, ready for use. You just enter the house - and have everything :)"
3870937,40115829,2015-07-28,25315668,Katie,"The cottage was absolutely adorable and perfect for my boyfriend, sister and I. The kitchen was well equipped and it was really convene in having a washer and dryer. As far as location goes, it's just a few blocks (less than a 10 minute walk) from Matthews beach, which offers a gorgeous view of the PNW. Highly recommend. It's only 20 minutes from Ballard and a little further to DT Seattle. Highly recommend! "
3870937,40444401,2015-07-31,31549966,Nick,"Was a great place just outside the city. We were able to cook every meal with the great kitchen and had a great time staying. With a private driveway and easy parking it was easy to leave and comeback whenever we wanted, it also gave us privacy from the main house which was nice. Planning on staying again the next time we go to Seattle!"
3870937,41924455,2015-08-10,30123440,Danielle,"after a long trip on the road, it was so nice for my boyfriend and I to be able to settle in at this cottage for the week. it felt like home away from home - I even caught myself referring to it as such several times throughout our stay! it was spacious, clean, and had all the necessities. parking was easy, and everywhere we needed or wanted to go was within a 10-20 minute drive. we also had absolute privacy throughout the duration of our stay. Ivan was incredibly receptive to questions, and sent helpful information about the area and cottage prior to our arrival. highly recommend!"
3870937,42412772,2015-08-13,14819816,Keith,"This place was perfect for our family. Ivan did a great job of responding to all questions I had about the place and the logistics of ""checking-in"". The beach/park that is within walking distance was perfect for my 3 year old. Place was clean and everything worked great. Thank you Ivan!"
3870937,43499946,2015-08-20,36473620,Vanessa,The Beach Cottage was very clean and close to all the places we wanted to drive to. The Cottage had great privacy. Ivan was extremely easy to communicate with and was helpful. 
3870937,43937774,2015-08-23,25549089,Jennifer,Ivan's cottage was in a very nice and quaint neighborhood. All of the instructions to get in and get into our room were perfectly laid out. The cottage was clean and had several amenities. We didn't meet Ivan but was quick to respond. The cottage is just as pictured and better then anywhere we have ever gone. A+. We will definitely be booking again in the future when we go back to Seattle.
3870937,45930182,2015-09-07,33242472,Carol,"We enjoyed our stay in this cottage.  The cottage was well equipped and attractive.  Ivan was responsive to any questions we had, and proved to ba a kind and accommodating host."
3870937,46871977,2015-09-14,35439421,Daniel,"Cottage was clean and very accommodating. Ivan was also very knowledgeable of the area, and gave great family friendly recommendations. "
3870937,50576157,2015-10-12,5777147,Lance,The accommodations and amenities were great. It was exactly as described. Ivan was very responsive and accommodating. Thank you for that! We found the location to be private and the area to be quiet and very convenient for our needs. We would definitely highly recommend and would stay here again.
143704,341452,2011-06-28,728712,Erin,"We enjoyed our stay at Julie's place. She is kind and helpful. The apartment, below her place is clean, comfortable and very spacious. There is mini-kitchen that is useful for eating in and Julie has provided many necessary kitchen utensils.
The neighborhood is charming and we walked to some of our favorite eateries in town."
143704,357043,2011-07-06,670930,Dallas,"We had a pretty good experience staying here.  Our arrival situation had to be very inconvenient for Julie, but she was most helpful in accomidating.  The location is about 2 miles East of Downtown.  Walking from there is not a problem.  I believe the #2 and #3 bus run a block over on Broadway.  Cost $2.25.  We took a taxi a couple of times to downtown for about $12 a ride.  One day I rode her hybrid bike.  We also packed light and used her washer and dryer.  The neighborhood looked pretty safe.  She had towels in the bathroom.  Everything you would need in the kitchen.  Upon request she brought down a clothes iron.  "
143704,389506,2011-07-22,815962,Rick,"Julie was a great host who went out of her way to ensure that my stay was comfortable.

The apartment itself is great - I really appreciated having my own entrance and complete privacy so I could come and go without worrying that I was being a disturbance. This is the perfect location for someone looking to spend some time in Seattle and not wanting to stay in a hotel. I particularly enjoyed walking from the apartment to downtown - it took about 30 minutes. Taking the bus was incredibly simple and quick as well (10 minute bus ride to get downtown).

I would come back and stay here for sure!"
143704,408779,2011-07-31,715710,Anthony,"Julie's place was extremely clean, comfortable and quiet. She was a very friendly and accommodating host and made sure I had all I needed to be comfortable. I highly recommend this space for short or longer stays. Tip: While the neighborhood is very walkable I do recommend a car if your goals are to see a lot of Seattle, especially the lakefront. For breakfast the Cortona Cafe is a short walk has great coffee and service. Try the fruit waffles!"
143704,479521,2011-08-27,226344,Erin,"I highly reccomend Julie's Guest Apartment!
My husband and I stayed at this lovely apartment for a total of 4 nights with our two children (ages 22 months and 8 months) and it was perfect.
Julie's communication with us was great all through-out the booking and stay. She greeted us upon our arrival, gave us a tour and let us settle in. She had picked fresh flowers for us from her very lovely garden, which she encouraged us to enjoy - and we did! The apartment has plenty of towels, a selection of linens for the bedding and many guides, maps and reading for those wishing to explore the city. Julie's thoughtfulness in anticiapitng what guests may want is very evident and appreciated:)The apartment is located in a quiet neighborhood that is close to bus lines and walking distance to local coffee shops, grocery stores and restaurants. We were able to easily use Julie's apartment as a great homebase to see everything we wanted to in the great city of Seattle. We felt like the apartment was our home. Thank you so much Julie - hope to see you again when we are in Seattle!"
143704,492297,2011-09-01,737615,Beth,"We loved our stay with Julie.  She offers a cozy, private space with lots of nice extras: shampoo/conditioner or a toothbrush/toothpaste in case you forgot, popcorn, easy connection to wireless, fresh flowers on the table, the kitchen was adequately stocked with utensils for cooking and information about local access to transportation.  She is a short bus ride from downtown Seattle in a quiet community.  It was perfect for our needs.  Our son came by to see our space and will recommend her to others coming to visit Seattle.  We will definitely be contacting Julie again when we return to Seattle.  Julie is a gracious host."
143704,505478,2011-09-06,758232,Kamila,"This is a lovely, quiet basement apartment in the host's house. I went to Seattle for a conference and thoroughly enjoyed staying in a residential area instead of a big anonymous conference hotel. The house is a 30-minute walk (or a short bus/car ride) from downtown, which is safe and takes you through some of the streets that make Seattle so famous (live bands and dancing on streets; neighborhood cafes and restaurants; communal gardens on street corners). The apartments is clean, with new furniture, but does not feel hotel-like (has some nice decorations and a feel of home) & you also have access to the back garden. The kitchen is small but fine for fixing a breakfast or a simple dinner; an organic supermarket and Trader Joe's are close by. The host is perfect: always ready to help or give advice but respecting your privacy. I stayed on my own, but the place is perfect for 2 or even 3 people: it is spacious, though not very light - but who wants to stay indoors while in Seattle?! "
143704,514261,2011-09-08,1028876,Leah,"Julie was a great host, quick to respond to messages and very accomodating and flexible to our early arrival.
The guest suite, a lovely, roomy space to unwind in, had all the amenities we needed during our short stay in Seattle - comfy bed, fridge, dishes, laundry - in a quiet, mature neighbourhood.  The back patio & fruit trees were an added bonus that Julie shared with us.  "
143704,536055,2011-09-16,570784,Monte,"Pro - Excellent location, near downtown, Lake Washington, etc. Was very clean and everything in good condition. Julie was very helpful and responsive to questions.

Con - We had been used to over 100 degree days in Texas so were a little cooler than was totally comfortable. The only heat was in the bedroom. Also Julie kept the fan of the central heat system going all of the time (no heat, just the fan) so there was a low level background noise. Not a real problem but it was there."
143704,593689,2011-10-03,1144807,Harold,"Julie was a great host.  She was responsive and answered any questions we had about her place and Seattle.

If you don't know where to go or what to do on your trip to Seattle, there are guides and maps to different activities around town on the dinner table.

There is plenty of space to relax and unwind.  There is a bedroom area and the living area which you typically don't get at a hotel.  Makes you feel like your living like a local.
If you are not used to the cooler weather, there are heaters placed throughout the space and blankets so it wasn't a problem for our stay.

Everything was clean and worked without problems.  The fresh flowers and the little food treat we got was a nice touch.  Thank you.  I would recommend Julie's place to anyone looking for a place to stay in Seattle.  Another extra bonus, free parking.  We stayed at a downtown hotel and paid $30+ a day which I found to be a bit much.  We had a rental car during our stay but public transit is close by, maybe next time we go to Seattle, we'll use that more.  I would recommend Julie's space for anyone looking for a place to stay in Seattle."
143704,626360,2011-10-13,1225906,Alina,Julie was a great host. She gave us very useful tips about places to see and how to go around using public transportation. Her apartment is nicely located and decorated. You have the basic appliances for your needs and there are plenty of grocery stores close by. My friend and I rented a car for the first three days and we went to Mount Rainier and San Juan Island then we spend the rest of our stay discovering Seattle by foot and using public transportation. We had a great time and we fell in love with the city and the people! Would definitely recommend you to stay here 100%. 
143704,683833,2011-11-01,1223139,Kavita & Ali,"I enjoyed Seattle so much more when I realised I could just walk into the city instead of catching the bus. Great location and excellent facilities in the secure, private apartment that Julie has renovated and decorated tastefully. We had lunch together after a lovely walk through a forest by the river and shared stories about our travels. A perfect host and new friend!"
143704,694216,2011-11-05,1284018,Jim,"Very convenient location, especially for our need to be near Swedish Hospital's Cherry Hill Campus. Street parking at Julie's was always available, and the place was quiet for its central city vibe -- even on Halloween! I was happy the housing costs were shared by local charitable organizations. "
143704,711542,2011-11-12,1229388,Susan,"Julie offered the right combination of care and concern for the comfort of my stay AND complete respect for my privacy. Her space is clean and comfortable--exactly as advertised and a fraction of the cost of a hotel with similar amenities.The bed was comfortable and the kitchenette made it possible for me to save money on meals out. There is a ton of closet space. In addition to linens, towels, dishes, and flatware, she provides hangers, extra blankets. and even toothbrushes.  The bathroom was spacious and spotless. The living area was cozy and gave me the space I needed to read and study, which was perfect as I was in Seattle attending a week-long training program. The neighborhood is down to earth and safe. I went running most mornings and felt very comfortable. Plus the cafe a block away (Cafe Cortona, I believe) makes awesome lattes and opens early, 7a. 

This is notthing Julie can control, but Seattle is COLD. Way more than I anticipated and I'm from Boston. Most of the heat in the apartment was from space heaters (they are in every room) and they made it very comfortable. However, if I was to return, I'd bring warmer clothes to sleep in and also slippers cause the floors are cold. Anyway, these are very small things; I would definitely rebook with Julie. "
143704,728214,2011-11-18,1355984,Matt,"Julie was a great host!  The location was perfect and the apartment was cozy and extremely comfortable.

Thanks Julie!"
143704,771653,2011-12-08,1421204,Jennifer,"This was my first time using Airbnb and it was a positive experience.  The space was cute, cozy, comfortable and located in a quiet neighborhood. Julie provided the apartment with everything you would need and much more. The location was close to the $2 bus ride  or just a $8 cab fare to downtown. There is a ton of free parking right in front of her home if you have a car. Also, if you need an airport shuttle ride it costs about $36   from this location. Julie made the transaction for arrival and departure very simple and easy."
143704,782245,2011-12-13,1287039,Diana,"Julie is a wonderful and kind host with a beautiful and cozy little apartment in a very nice part of Seattle with good bus connections to the center of town. The place is clean, well-equipped and extremely cozy; an old house with a nice little yard. As is the case with charming old houses, the plumming is a bit temperamental, though, so be prepared not to flush paper :) We had a great time in wonderful Seattle and great time being guests in this lovable apartment. Highly recommended!
"
143704,791684,2011-12-18,125604,Brenna,"My fiance and I visited Seattle in December 2011, and we had an enjoyable time staying in Julie's quiet guest apartment. The kitchenette was well stocked with teas, the separate entrance made our stay private, and the apartment was located only a short bus ride from the downtown core. Since it was winter, the apartment was a bit on the cool side, but the two electric fireplaces, the heater in the bathroom, and the extra blankets made it nice and comfy. Didn't get to experience the back garden because of the rain, but from the window, it looked nice!"
143704,797782,2011-12-21,442708,Christopher,"Julie was an excellent host. Everything you needed minus a TV was included in the apartment at the time of our stay... but you won't need a TV if you're out and about exploring Seattle! It was very comfortable with plenty of seating in the living area, and a comfortable bed. Plenty of nice space heaters are provided as well if the heat from the central heating is not warm enough for you. Please stay with her, she definitely went above and beyond what the average host provides on airbnb!"
143704,818431,2011-12-31,1509912,Ashish,"Very helpful host, took care of us well!"
143704,855481,2012-01-10,659280,New,"My partner and I had a great time. Very comfortable and spacious, with plenty of dishes, towels, laundry machines and that sort of thing. Very warm and cozy. We also very much liked the location - only a block from Union, it was close to major arteries to downtown, Pike and Pine. We walked downtown each day, and in the evenings we were easy walking distance to good cafes, restaurants, bars and plenty of cinemas, including the Northwest Film Forum. Much more rewarding than staying in the hotel district (and not so far from there that you couldn't reach easily by bus and even by foot). "
143704,863551,2012-01-15,1553485,Mario,"great location, easy to get around,
clean and cozy,
private too;
it looks like the picture !"
143704,880615,2012-01-24,1512010,Victoria,"Julie's guest apartment is beautiful, and she is a wonderful host. Eager to start exploring Seattle, I asked Julie if she would be able to accommodate our early arrival. She was more than happy to accommodate us getting in hours before check-in, and she welcomed us with open arms. The place is a sweet and cozy dwelling. The decor and furniture were artistic and fun. Both my partner and I were excited to return to our temporary Seattle home. The apartment is central and located just about 20 min from just about any and everything you would like to visit. Julie was quick to give us food suggestions and directions. She even had some fun walk guides to explore Seattle. Julie's place has a warm, artsy, fun, and homey vibe. It is perfect for a vacation in the windy, wet, and adventurous city of Seattle.  

I love this place. And I recommend staying with Julie any day. I cannot wait to return to Seattle and stay with at Julie's place."
143704,912199,2012-02-10,206203,Amanda,"Julie's guest apartment is cute, clean, comfortable, quiet, and centrally located. Julie is a pleasant, easy going hostess, provides snacks, and cares about your comfort.  The place is reasonably priced, parking is readily available, and I would highly recommend it as a hotel alternative. "
143704,921604,2012-02-14,652569,Elizabeth,"Julie is a wonderful hostess and her guest apartment is darling. Spacious, clean, and private space in adorable Seattle neighborhood - a 2 minute drive from the hip hubbub of Capitol Hill, with the calm peace of a family neighborhood. Very comfy bed, large bathroom, and adorable ""fireplace"" space heaters in every room. Thanks for a great stay!"
143704,963065,2012-03-01,1458921,Leslie,"Julie was warm and welcoming and flexible about arrival time.  Cozy basement suite with a free laundry.  On street parking available right in front of her house so you don't have to circle the block to find a space.  Very clean with wonderful deck out back with your own access.  Kitchen well equipped for breakfast or lunch, not for a five course supper, but who wants to cook with so many great restaurants in Seattle.  Very nice neighborhood, feels safe.  Bed very comfortable and tons of storage space and a bicycle to tour the area with, plus a great price."
143704,974535,2012-03-06,1217500,Mike,"I'm a local and was in need of  a place for a friend for the weekend, myself being in between places. Julie was most attentive and accomodating. Her place was clean and private, though somewhat cramped- thinking of the couch. Location may best be for the streetsmart  types. I would stay again Mike"
143704,992996,2012-03-12,1268017,Jon,"Julie was an extremely gracious host and her apartment was in a great location, close to downtown, UofW as well as the freeways. It made for a comfortable and relaxing weekend. "
143704,1019173,2012-03-19,979478,Victoria,"What a perfect lil' gem we found! The pictures look exactly what you'll expect. Although, a little chilly a times, space heaters are abundant to use. Good kitchenette to prepare breakfast and a light meal. Cute bathroom and lovely amenities provided. Convenient to downtown Seattle, Capitol Hill & Central District. Clean and well maintained. "
143704,1035816,2012-03-23,1834091,Alex,"This is a really fantastic space in a great location. It's a fully furnished, private apartment, and I dare say it's bigger than the apartment I live in full time! It gave me a great feel for Seattle living, and I fell in love with the city while staying here.

Everything was great, and Julie was a wonderful host as well. I would absolutely recommend staying here. "
143704,1071748,2012-04-02,1737606,Daniel,"The apartment was great! Plenty of room for two of us (my wife & I) with helpful amenities like a sink, microwave, refrigerator, dishes, flatware, etc, as well as printed maps and suggestions for cool things to do/see in the city. The neighborhood is quiet, clean, and super convenient for accessing major bus lines. Or if the weather cooperates, it's a pretty easy walk downtown. 
Julie made the whole process very easy. She was great at communication during the rental, and was sure to ask if we had everything we needed, while still allowing us plenty of privacy. 
Would recommend this place for anyone in search of a cozy, private, centrally-located base in the city!"
143704,1189938,2012-04-28,1511931,Clay,"I'm working on building a house a few blocks north of this apartment. I wanted a trip to convince my girlfriend to move with me by planning an ""if we lived here"" vacation. Foregoing the sterile hotel experience for ten days in a fantastic central Seattle neighborhood within walking distance to grocery stores, restaurants, theaters, book stores, public transportation, etc. This place really was the icing on the cake and couldn't have gone better."
143704,1265609,2012-05-12,195400,Terianne,"This guest apartment in Seattle was so comfortable, accommodating and well located.  We thoroughly enjoyed it. Most of the time we took buses around the city and this was easy to do with bus stops between 2 and 4 blocks from the apartment. It's easy to get a bus and easy to transfer so you can access all of Seattle from this centrally located spot.  If you do have a car, which we did for a few days, there is plenty of free and safe on street parking.  The neighborhood felt safe and walkable even at night and there are cafe's, places to eat and grocery stores all within easy walking distance.  The apartment was large enough for a couple to feel comfortable, but might be a bit small for a family - though the lovely back yard garden extends the living space.  I would have loved an espresso machine in the kitchen, but other than that the kitchen was very usable, mostly for breakfast and quick easy meals, but we even had one dinner meal there. Since we are from Miami we were a bit cold in Seattle but the space heaters really warm the place up comfortably.  There are plenty of blankets and even slippers!  The bed was very comfortable and this is something I am quite picky about!! The hostess was fantastic . .  kind, and accommodating and greeted us with a fresh bouquet of flowers from her gorgeous garden.  She checked with us by email to make sure we were comfortable and had everything we needed, offered help and tips for getting around, provided us with brochures and maps, and gave us attention when we wanted it and respected our privacy too!   This listing really deserves five stars.  This was our first AirB&B rental and we are very pleased!  If you need a centrally located, clean, safe, comfortable and accommodating place to stay - you won't be disappointed."
143704,1297892,2012-05-18,1745230,Leila,"The apartment is conveniently located, clean, and welcoming right down to the fresh flowers our hostess left for us.  We enjoyed a sunny morning on the deck, and had a great stay."
143704,1413512,2012-06-04,2383535,Hayden,"It was a very enjoyable stay! Julie gives you everything you need for your stay, and the apartment is nice. I would recommend staying with Julie!"
143704,1449091,2012-06-10,2220345,Steven,"Julie was a fantastic host! We had an early, but uncertain arrival time, as we were coming off an Alaskan cruise ship, but Julie reassured us that we could store our luggage if the room was not ready, but by the time we got there everything was beautifully prepared and ready for us.  Julie had some very useful information and maps available for us to work out where we were, and we quickly found an incredible little coffee shop literally around the corner from where she lives.  The bus into town is very convenient and reasonable $2.25 with multiple transfers allowed up to 3 hours after you first get on.  We also discovered that if you don't want to ride the bus, this house is a very pleasant 15 minute walk to the Capital Hill cafe, bar and restaurant district.  The surrounding area that the apartment is situated in is a very quiet residential neighbourhood with lush gardens and friendly neighbours who we met at the coffee house.  The apartment is very roomy and has a good layout with all the amenities you need for a short stay, and Julie gave us access to the laundry, which we desperately needed after 3 weeks of travel!!  It's nice to stay in a place where the owner is very committed to making the residence a minimally eco impact house, and Julie has made it easy to maintain the eco standards, and had also provided some beautiful organic body wash.  One morning Julie presented us with a small pot of fresh rhubarb compote that she had just made that morning, it was beautiful! Our one little caution about this apartment would be if you have hip, knee or mobility issues that restrict you from getting close to the ground, as the bed, with a very comfortable mattress, is about 1 foot off the floor - I am quite tall, so it was  a long way down at night and a long way up in the morning - Julie did mention that there is a comfortable sofa bed, so if this was a concern for you, you might want to discuss this with her.  Don't pass this place by if you need a spot to unwind after exploring the fantastic sites of Seattle!"
143704,1482385,2012-06-14,2574612,Annis,"Really like the place, it was an opportunity to live the real Seattle life since we could walk to the neighborhood's coffee shops and a quick walk to see the Washington Lake. Enjoyed staying in the appartment, it was tidy and clean, even if it was a bit cold during the night, the heaters helped a lot! Also loved the fact we could enjoy a bit of sun in the magical garden! Julie is a very nice host and always smiling =). Definately recommended for a getaway!! "
143704,1523212,2012-06-20,465264,Katherine,"Julie was an excellent host! The private apartment was in great condition and Julie makes sure you have everything you need. Even when she wasn't there to greet us when we arrived, she arranged for a friend to meet us who had all the information from Julie. You could tell she cares and took time to make sure we were oriented. She also left helpful maps and guides.  

It is somewhat drafty, yet she ensures you have extra blankets and several space heaters throughout the apartment, as well as provides extra towels and toiletries. The garden was adorable and she checked in with us during our stay once to make sure we had everything we needed. 

The location is wonderful if you're looking to stay outside of downtown and get more of a feel for the suburban surroundings, yet we had no problem walking Downtown or to the arboretum/Lake Washington. Buses were also very available all around the apartment and can get you back and forth to Downtown easily. 

Her recommendations for coffee and food in the neighborhood are also top notch! You have great taste, Julie!

Thank you for a lovely stay! "
143704,1554780,2012-06-25,2180518,Jason,"Julie's apartment was wonderful, and she was extremely helpful and friendly. Everything was clean and comfortable. Julie even provided lots of tourist information, including some walking tour guides for different Seattle neighborhoods that really came in handy. Awesome!"
143704,1718574,2012-07-16,2422457,Kristi,My husband and I stayed in Julie's guest house for 12 days while in between moves. Julie is a great hostess--very attentive and the house is pretty well equipped.  Enjoyed what the area has to offer as well. 
143704,1753333,2012-07-20,2417098,Lani,"Julie's apartment was so spacious, and was more than enough space for the two of us. Although it is not centrally located to the downtown area, it is easily accessible by buses. Julie provided a lot of information about Seattle and the best places to visit in the immediate area around her studio. She was kind enough to accomodate our early arrival and gave us a full tour. Great value!"
143704,1797778,2012-07-25,1735642,Krista,"Good location and spacious lodging for Seattle first-timers.  We appreciated her focus on eco-friendly practices.  It was chilly, we had to run the radiator while we were there.  Everything was clean.  "
143704,1821354,2012-07-28,2843201,Anthony,Very clean accommodations and great location in Seattle city center. Very helpful host.
143704,1858460,2012-08-01,251637,Mhairi,"Loved my stay in Julie's oasis. Cute little apartment, really well equipped and in a lovely neighbourhood  It was really nice to be out of the city. Thought the transpiration to and from town was efficient and regular. Excellent amount of pamphlets and guides provided as well. Top tip - go down to Madrona village, 10 mins walk away, for some cute cafes and restaurants. The lake is not far away either. Thanks Julie!"
143704,1968255,2012-08-13,2698866,Linh,"Julie is an excellent host. She greeted us at our Checkin and gave us tips on what to do.  We recommend this place for a small family (we were 3). There is a park within walking distance and beach access at the Lake Washington nearby. Within 10 min walk were excellent restaurants, cafes and coffee. Also the Captiol Hill area was nearby for great food and night scene. We had a great experience."
143704,1996774,2012-08-15,3152242,Elizabeth England,"We loved staying at Julie's apartment in Seattle!  It's location is a great neighborhood, close to so many things.  The accommodations were wonderful; we were very comfortable.  The bed provided a great rest and Julie is a very kind and generous hostess.  We wholeheartedly recommend this lovely place.

143704,2022524,2012-08-18,2929491,Wheeler,"Julie is an awesome host! The space is great, she was very responsive throughout the process, and even checked to see that I was finding everything OK a couple of hours after I had checked in. Highly recommended. Thanks Julie!"
143704,2037945,2012-08-20,2458544,Michael,This is a peaceful neighborhood and public transit very close. From the airport you can take the light rail to Baker Terminal and catch the the 48 to olive street. From there is 3 short blocks.
143704,2107467,2012-08-27,1303634,Elyse,"We had a fantastic time staying with Julie while we were in Seattle. What a great host with a great space! Even before we arrived, she gave us recommendations for lunch right by the train station. She kept directions for everything very clearly outlined in the apartment, so we really had no questions for her at all. She keeps a list of local restaurants and cafes within walking distance, which was super helpful. (Make sure to check out the Ethiopian restaurant!!!) We loved exploring this diverse neighborhood, and staying here made our trip in Seattle very comfy. Would recommend to eco-conscious travelers. A+"
143704,2158899,2012-09-01,2745319,Leilani,"The accomodation was so amazing.  Julie was absolutely lovely, and helpful in every way.  The location was perfect, and the unit was so comfortable, and felt like home.  I recommend this place to everyone.  Its extremely good value for the cost, and I promise you wont be disappointed.  It's worth it!  I will definitely be back again, it surpassed any of my expectations.  Thank you Julie!"
143704,2270853,2012-09-12,2552948,Hugh,"We had a good time at Julie's place. The place was clean and comfortable for the 3 nights we stayed.  The pictures  on the Airbnb site makes the place look very warm and modern but in reality is not as expected. The bed was very uncomfortable and so low to the floor it felt like sleeping in the floor.  Also, there were too many rules and notes for everything. It you think you are going to cook there forget about it. The location was very convenient, quite and centrally located to downtown Seattle but the neighborhood was not very appealing. Julie was very friendly and she tried to make us feel very comfortable. Thanks Julie I think if you make some changes and get a better bed your place will be just perfect to anybody to say. "
143704,2334214,2012-09-18,3108175,Lynn,"Julie is a gracious host with the most comfortable bed and clean place to stay. Great shower, lovely setting, nice amenities, very quiet, and centrally located. Very worth the money. The size is a little smaller than what the pictures show, some lens distortion,  but very adequate. All in all, I'd book it again."
143704,2353438,2012-09-20,3309637,Derek,"My girlfriend and I loved staying at Julie's basement apartment! It was very clean, cute and comfortable. We only had a short time to visit the city, but this apartment was in a great location, a very easy drive to all the touristy things we wanted to do! Julie was very accommodating and very responsive. A great bang for your buck thats for sure! "
143704,2408423,2012-09-25,1155800,Susan,"We enjoyed our stay in Seattle hosted by Julie.  The apartment is pleasant, sheets and toilets are clean.

We were given lots of privacy and we were practically on our own on the ground level.  

Overall, it has been a pleasant stay."
143704,2477279,2012-10-01,3660514,Danielle,"Julie was a great host and her basement apartment was lovely. It was nice being able to have our own living space as well as a homey feeling and all for a great deal! I absolutely recommend a stay here and look forward to coming back.

The host Julia is warm and helpful. She also provides a bike and helmet, which is very useful in Seattle, though I had my own and didn't use it."
143704,2840060,2012-11-08,3931342,Thorsten And Prudence,"This was a fantastic place to stay, both in terms of quiet space to work and just to get away and relax. Also a nice walk away from some great restaraunts and Lake Washington if you're up for some wandering. Thanks Jule!"
143704,2877439,2012-11-13,3541930,Jim,"Julie's apartment is spacious, clean, quiet and very comfortable.  I especially liked being only two blocks away from bus stops that were on the main east-west and north-south routes.  Very easy to get to the university district (15 minutes by bus) and to the downtown/fish market area (also 15 minutes).  The neighborhood is very mixed, and mostly residential, so don't expect 12 restaurants within a short walk, but it was great for a quiet get away while staying in the city."
143704,2963036,2012-11-26,3076881,Dorothy,"My daughter and I had a wonderful time in Seattle.  A big part of this was our wonderful stay at Julie's.  Our accommodations were clean, quiet,comfortable and in a great location.  Julie checked in with us to make sure we had everything we needed.  She has a list of what is available in the area.  We visited the Cortano coffee shop every morning.  We are already planning our visit next year and would love to stay at Julie's."
143704,3115366,2012-12-18,4208934,Joelle,"I had a wonderful long weekend in Seattle. This apartment was wonderfully comfortable and close to everywhere I needed to go, plus I discovered several cute neighborhoods nearby and went on some great walks, inspired a deck of Seattle walking route cards that Julie provided. Overall, I would recommend this place to friends and hope that I get a chance to come back soon!"
143704,3205529,2013-01-01,918788,Kristen,"Great little apartment in a nice neighbourhood. Easy public transport access to downtown- or a walk, if you're up for it!
Julie was a great host and provided us with lots of info on the hotspots locally and around Seattle!
Recommend dinner at St Cloud Restaurant- it was delicious!!
Good value for money!"
143704,3551072,2013-02-16,4306184,Lindsay,"This was a great place to stay! Quiet, clean, and cozy. Close to the buslines. Would definitely stay here again! "
143704,3760434,2013-03-12,1783184,Judy,"Julie was a great host. The unit was spotless and had ample pillows, sheets and blankets. The bathroom was also supplied with shampoo, conditioner, body wash and a blow dryer which was great because I hadn't brought one. Additionally, the sleep areas had great heaters which in my opinion was a huge plus. She gave us some great recommendations for restaurants in the area, and the unit was supplied with snacks, coffee and tea, as well as some useful kitchen tools including a microwave and dishes. She was overall a great host and I would highly recommend staying at Julie's unit! Thanks Julie! "
143704,3955210,2013-03-30,1676625,Anna,"Julie was great, accommodating, and super friendly. Place was spotless and beautiful. Great area, centrally located, and she made sure to check in during the middle of the visit. Would definitely stay there again. Thanks for everything!"

The apartment has an eco-friendly vibe. The decor and facilities are simple and basic."
143704,4361808,2013-04-30,3719934,Adrienne,"We had a great time staying at Julie's apartment. 
Julie really wants you to enjoy the city as much as she does, which is evident in her helpful notes, maps and advice! It is in a great area- quiet at night and close enough to shops for the daytime. 

The apartment was very comfortable with a fabulous bed! We will definitely stay here again. "

143704,5106410,2013-06-12,6640813,Eric,"Went to Seattle on vacation and came across this humble abode. This was a great place to stay. The rates for all 3 nights was pretty much the cost of one night at a hotel downtown. Best part was that it was really close to so much of the stuff I wanted to do. Within 10 minutes, you have access to all the touristy stuff.(space needle, pike place,etc.)  I would definitely come back should I ever visit Seattle again. Thanks again Julie for all the hospitality!"
143704,5157486,2013-06-16,5369310,Sylas,"My mom stayed at Julie's private guest apartment when she visited for my graduation.  The location was perfectly convenient as I live just a few blocks away from Julie's space.  Julie was out of town for the visit, but made sure that my mom had everything she needed to be comfortable including an alternate contact person should any unforeseen issues arise (none did).  The apartment itself is so cute, warm, comfortable and tidy.  My mom boasted that the bed was the most comfortable she'd slept in away from home.  The neighborhood is lovely, quiet and convenient.  My mom deeply enjoyed her stay.  Thanks, Julie!"
143704,5240453,2013-06-20,4245948,Claudine,"Julie was very welcoming and the apartment was very comfortable. My partner and I came for a conference and found the apartment very convenient, at about a 30min walk from the convention center downtown. Julie was extremely accommodating and flexible, the apartment was clean and functional. The area is also nice, with good cafes and nearby groceries. I highly recommend Julie's place for anyone staying in Seattle."
143704,5313618,2013-06-24,3986860,David,"This is a comfortable, clean converted garage apartment in a nice, interesting neighborhood.  It is a 15 minute bus ride to downtown, during which you meet the less affluent of Seattle.  Interesting and a real neighborhood experience.  The neighborhood is lovely, with pretty, funky gardens and community gardens on the corners. Julie is helpful and efficient and very nice.  We definitely recommend Julie's place--a good value."

143704,5873312,2013-07-20,7367087,Gene,"Great little basement apartment and Julie is a wonderful hostess. At 6'3"" the bed was a little small for me (think it was a full size bed) but other than that a great place stay close to downtown. Julie has a lot of info for shopping, dinning and seeing the city, organic hair care products and a lot of caring touches that made us feel welcome."
143704,5950370,2013-07-23,7099793,Cynthia,Had a great stay! Julie was very nice and helpful. The location is perfect to get to and from the airport and to downtown . Good spot to take a morning jog down to the lake by Madrona Park. This is a great space I would definitely stay here again.
143704,6710099,2013-08-22,7291950,Linda,"We had a great time in Seattle and our stay here was a part of that.  The place was simple but clean and provided the necessities for our stay. The bed was very comfortable but very low to the floor, which could be difficult for seniors or folks with hip or knee trouble.  The neighborhood was lovely and we had a great time exploring the area.  "
143704,6811078,2013-08-26,6601631,Marion,"
Une hôte accueillante, un appartement confortable et très bien situé. De plus, de belles oeuvres d'art sur tous les murs du lieu, c'est rare et très agréable !
Very welcoming host, very well located and confortable appartment. Bonus : great art works in every room, that's rare and precious ! "
143704,7032702,2013-09-04,4366901,Ben,Definitely a good value. Julie is a helpful/friendly host!

143704,8725213,2013-11-13,3948261,Sar,"Julie could not have been more helpful and flexible! I made our reservation only a few hours before we arrived, and then when my flight was delayed, Julie was extremely accommodating. The apt is clean and comfortable for two. There are some great coffee shops and a handful of restaurants within walking distance but the rest of the city is within easy driving distance of the apt. "
143704,8863005,2013-11-22,6568451,Ursula,"Julie was very a friendly hostess and interested in our stay being comfortable. The place is in a nice neighborhood with easy access to downtown and other sites.  Thank you, Julie."
143704,9233131,2013-12-15,6342022,William Steve,Lucky to grab this place. I just moved to Seattle and the location was a great base for exploring the city. Nice. Clean. Quite.
143704,9394954,2013-12-26,1819314,Jody,"Julie's apartment is in a great neighborhood location but still close to downtown, restaurants and coffee shops. It's spacious and well-outfitted--including a kitchenette complete with snacks! We were perfectly comfortable during our stay, and hope to return! (Thanks, Julie, for all you do to make your guests feel at home.) 

In addition, Julie is friendly with great advice for things to do and see--as well as accommodating with check in/check out. Simply a great place to stay!"
143704,10104741,2014-01-31,1586747,Mary,"Han and I had a great time in Seattle. It was wonderful
to be tucked into Julie's cozy apartment. We didn't have
an auto but that didn't matter as the markets were not far
away. Public transportation was easily accessed. But 
don't forget rain gear! 
It was great that she provided snacks, coffee and tea as well.
We would definitely book Julie's place again."
143704,10310458,2014-02-12,11070857,Myles,Julie was an amazing host! A++++ will definitely be staying with her next time we visit Seattle!
143704,10424959,2014-02-18,10962892,Kehinde,"I really appreciate how seriously Julie takes being eco-friendly. All the cleaning products are eco-friendly and top quality. The house is located in the Central District of Seattle within walking distance of Capitol Hill, Madrona and Lake Washington. I got used to staying here very quickly.

Julie is a caring and helpful host. She has tones of info to help you navigate the city and even a bike for you to borrow."
143704,10540130,2014-02-24,2774766,Nancy,Julie is very welcoming and makes sure you are happy and comfortable in her apt.  Very clean and cozy.
143704,10679405,2014-03-03,10957667,Adam,"I was in town for the AWP Conference downtown at the convention center. The space was comfortable and convenient to downtown via a 10-minute drive or a 20-minute bus ride. The bus was about a block and a half away, so I chose that option most often.

The space itself was comfortable and basic -- couch, chairs, table; toaster oven, microwave, mini-fridge; bed, dresser. There were a few more amenities than that -- a washer and dryer, for example, and a backyard patio -- that I didn't have time to use.

Julie met me when I arrived and showed me around the place. She was friendly and helpful through the whole process -- responded promptly when I booked the reservation, was there when I arrived, and emailed check-ins a few times during my stay to make sure I didn't need anything. I felt like if something had gone wrong, she would've taken care of it immediately.

Overall, it was a nice place to stay and I'd stay there again."
143704,10822620,2014-03-09,12364049,Philip,"The apartment is lovely, the location is ideal, and Julie is a sweetheart. I couldn't have asked for a better experience, and will definitely look this place up whenever I'm back in Seattle!"
143704,11080157,2014-03-19,8630600,Kenny,"Julie's city space is private, quiet, and very clean. She touched base with me a couple times to be sure I had everything I needed. I tend to stay near Capitol Hill when I'm working there. Her home was conveniently located. it was the perfect retreat from my busy times there. "
143704,11397920,2014-04-01,918719,Jackie,"Julie's little apartment was fantastic for a long weekend and our first time to Seattle in many years. It's fairly centrally located in a really sweet, quiet residential neighborhood. It's near several bus lines and a short walk to either Capitol Hill or Madrona Center, where you'll find lots of great restaurants, shops etc., and about 30 mins from the airport by car. The apartment itself was very clean, quiet, and Julie leaves lots of helpful notes around the place to help you work appliances, etc. The photos are very accurate, so there were no surprises. Though the rain kept us from enjoying it, the garden also provides a lovely retreat. The bed was comfy and there were plenty of ways to keep cozy if the apartment got a little chilly, which it does (but that's Seattle). The key code entry system was also very easy, and secure (and no worrying about forgetting keys!). Last but not least, Julie was very friendly, helpful and accommodating, especially given our very late arrival. She leaves loads of recommendations for you if you need them, and is available for questions or issues if they come up. We didn't have any, but she is very responsive by text or email. Overall it was very pleasant stay and would recommend it to others, and stay again if the need arises."
143704,11534202,2014-04-07,11073131,Johanna,"Thanks you for being such a nice host and taking good care! We enjoyed our stay at your place a lot, it was cozy, quiet, clean and comfortable as well! We can highly recommend Julies place for a stay in Seattle!"
143704,12118419,2014-04-23,12623713,Simeon,Julie was really awesome!
143704,12290024,2014-04-28,13538342,Eric,"Great spot. Julie was very accommodating. Apartment was well put together, clean, and private. Exactly what I was looking for. "
143704,12508867,2014-05-04,14484280,Michele,"Julie did a great job of making sure I had everything I needed while respecting my space and privacy.   I was very busy during my visit to Seattle,  and she made sure to check in with text messages periodically to ensure I was comfortable.  I could recommend her space to anyone that wanted a safe,  clean, comfortable place to stay.   The garden was a lovely touch,  although I didn't get to spend much time enjoying it.   I think this was a great fit,  and a very positive experience for my first use of Air BNB."
143704,13339878,2014-05-26,11827864,Rich,"As a first-time user of Airbnb, we were a little hesitant about staying in someone else's home. Our stay with Julie, however, was just fantastic--she was so hospitable, friendly and accommodating. The guest room is a converted basement which was a good size for a couple. The space was cozy and clean when we arrived, and though located downstairs from the owner, felt very private. There's no fuss getting in/out and we truly felt like locals while staying there. Julie has it stockpiled with all the essentials: iron, blow dryer, extra towels, blankets, slippers, snacks and coffee. It was our first time visiting Seattle, and we found the neighborhood charming. The neighbors were all really nice, and I spent every morning at Cortona coffee down the street--Joe makes a mean cappuccino. We used public transportation the first few days and were happy to find main bus lines within blocks of Julie's home. As for Julie, she is a delightful host and the exchanges were no-fuss and as I said, very hospitable. I feel like we were a little annoying requesting a fan one day, but Julie offered us one with a smile! Would definitely stay here again. A+"
143704,14338632,2014-06-17,12624121,Cathleen,"We were very comfortable in the tastefully decorated garden level apartment with kitchenette, and also loved the historic, centrally located neighborhood.  The hospitality shown us by our host helped make our trip to Seattle memorable.  Many thanks!"
143704,14917900,2014-06-29,15835741,Charles,"Julie is an awesome host and we had a wonderful time in her apartment.  Easy to park, close to everything and julie is very easy to keep in touch with if there is a problem!  Couldn't be better"
143704,15171323,2014-07-04,13666222,Tony,"Julie is a wonderful host.  The unit is everything as described, located in a very quiet safe neighborhood with easy bus transportation to all the tourist attractions.  Julie has  written down details on almost everything a tourist needs to know, such as taking the bus, restaurants, places of interest.  We loved the unit, private and quint, nicely decorated.  We'll definitely stay there again next time we're in Seattle."
143704,15538636,2014-07-11,16265816,Jenny,"Cute little place to stay, really quiet neighborhood, cafe around the corner had amazing vegan waffles!  Julie was very welcoming and she had plenty of maps to help you get around the city.  Very close to pikes place.  "
143704,15667305,2014-07-14,12113580,Krista,We stayed in Julie's place during a three day stop in Seattle for a road trip. Julie was super helpful and provided us with some insider tips and guides for exploring the city--and not just the touristy parts. The location was also very convenient; we took the bus everyday and barely used the car. 
143704,15869574,2014-07-17,6582750,Rui,"Julie was so nice to us. For our flight was delayed, we arrived a little bit late. Julie showed us her house carefully. She send me email everyday to make sure we have a good time in her house."
143704,16198873,2014-07-23,13905759,Joseph,"Julie was a fantastic host for our stay in Seattle. Very friendly, helpful, with lots of tips to make our visit to the city as enjoyable as possible. The rental is a really nice, cozy space. It's also located very close to a number of bus routes that let us not having to drive in the city at all once we arrived. If we get the chance to go back, I'm sure we will be trying to stay here again."
143704,17014994,2014-08-05,18332663,Katherine,"Julie's space was perfect for a long weekend in Seattle!  She provided us with everything we needed, and was a very hospitable host.  She texted a few times to make sure we had everything we needed and had a binder with maps, restaurant menus, and lists of sites for us to use. 

The basement apartment was a very good size and didn't feel like a basement at all.  The kitchen is small but very well equipped, and the shower had great water pressure."
143704,17428895,2014-08-12,9954058,Mai,"Julie welcomed us as we arrived late in the evening and made time to show us around the apartment.  She had prepared a folder of local attractions, restaurants, and various tips.  Her listing was accurate and the photos represented the space appropriately.  The neighborhood known as the ""Central District"" was literally central to most of the places we went, literally within a mile or two.  The parking is street parking, but we never had an issue finding a spot right in front of the house.  We highly recommend Julie as a host!"
143704,17683100,2014-08-16,37289,Lorenzo,"Julie e' stata velocissima a scriverci quando abbiamo prenotato e in generale la comunicazione con lei e' stata sempre molto semplice. Il quartiere e' molto carino (consigliamo di visitarlo a piedi, ci sono dei bellissimi giardini davanti ad alcune case fatti da membri del quartiere e in generale in tutta la zona si percepisce un forte senso della comunita') ed e' comodo anche per muoversi in citta' se si vogliono prendere i mezzi pubblici. A poca distanza ci sono anche molti ristoranti e locali. Nella cucina di Julie c'e' tutto il necessario per fare colazione, ma se volete farla fuori il cafe cortona, che si trova a solo un isolato, prepara degli ottimi caffe' e cappuccini (e il barista e' gentilissimo, come praticamente tutti gli abitanti di questa fantastica citta'). 
Consigliatissima!   "
143704,18002591,2014-08-20,8044361,Angela,"Julie is an amazing host, helpful and caring and her apartment is cozy and comfortable, well connected to everything. The neighborhood is  genuinely welcoming. Our stay was a real pleasure! We absolutely recommend this host!"

Our host Julie was great, and even accommodated a late check in time. The keyless entry was super convenient. "
143704,18645712,2014-08-30,2135222,Candy,We are two senior citizens. Julie's apartment had a wonderful location for riding the bus. We could even walk to Capitol Hill for dinner. The apartment was exactly as described and very clean. I would definitely recommend Julie's apartment.
143704,18873306,2014-09-02,2351207,Jonah,"Julie was an excellent host.  She greeted us at the apartment and gave us a thorough walkthrough of the apartment.  She also has a book of information containing maps, restaurants, and frequently asked questions.  Julie was very courteous and even checked in with us to see how things were going.  

The place itself is wonderful.  It is conveniently located in the central part of Seattle close to the waterfront and Washington Park.  There is a wonderful coffee shop called Queen Bee a couple of blocks away located across the street from the Safeway.  

We were very satisfied with our stay and will stay with Julie again when we return to Seattle.  "
143704,19035730,2014-09-05,19112874,Kyle,The place was in a great location and Julie was helpful upon our arrival and then left us with the space. It was easier than we thought to get around town from the place. We parked out front with no problem.

143704,19679397,2014-09-16,18839223,Maurine,We arrived earlier than check-in and Julie was able to meet us. Great location! We walked to everything. Julie checked in often to make sure we were doing alright. The bed was super comfy and shower was amazing!  I would recommend Julie's place to friends. 
143704,19872229,2014-09-20,17374459,Julia,"Great experience. Clean, big, bed so comfy was hard to get up in the morning!
Julie was really helpful and waited for us with our late arrival and gave us a tour of the apartment. Also had loads of info on offer about the area and Seattle. Amazing location. Would come back for sure!"
143704,20200758,2014-09-25,20128749,Taryn,"Julie welcomed us on the night of our arrival and accommodated a late night arrival. The location was very close to lots of major attractions and located in a quiet neighborhood. No problem with street parking. The unit was equipped with plenty of blankets, towels, toiletries, heaters and more. We were very comfortable and enjoyed having the private entrance, bathroom, living room and small kitchenette. Julie was very responsive by phone and email, and was very friendly and helpful. "
143704,20414049,2014-09-29,6046507,Julie,"Apartment was as shown.  Julie (host) is very accommodating with requests and helpful. Great to have use of washing machine & dryer. 
Apartment very comfortable and quiet neighbourhood. Access to public transport easy and close. Information avail in apartment. Highlights were Lunch at the Space Needle revolving restaurant (includes observation deck access), Chihuly Garden & Glass & Pike Place Market. Lovely stay in Seattle."
143704,21032765,2014-10-10,3496083,Lisa,"Julie was a great host! She greeted us upon our arrival and showed us the amenities. There was also a very helpful area guidebook with local Recommendations, bus schedules,  etc.  The location was perfect. Walking distance to capitol hill and downtown,  easy access to public transit.  Very quiet and relaxing place to stay. Definitely would stay again! "
143704,21661192,2014-10-21,20769883,Carrie,"My boyfriend and I really enjoyed our stay here! As other reviewers have mentioned, the location was very convenient in terms of transportation; it seemed to be at the center of all major bus lines, and in our travels around the city we never had to make a bus transfer.  We also really appreciated having the kitchenette and a nearby grocery store so that we could prepare some meals in the apartment; that helped us to keep our costs down during the trip. Julie was very friendly to us but also respected our privacy. The next time we come to Seattle, we will definitely consider staying here again!"
143704,22297248,2014-11-03,20908437,Tony,Julie was a great host. The place was definitely cozy and her green book of things to do helped a lot. I'd definitely consider staying here again. 
143704,23842436,2014-12-12,20233493,Audra,"Great communication from the host both before check in and during my stay. The apartment is a snug walk-out basement conversion, and has its own private entrance. The kitchenette is well stocked with dishes, utensils, etc and there's ample storage in the closets and bathroom. I loved that the bedroom has heavy curtains and is nice and dark for sleeping in."
143704,24052450,2014-12-18,12884592,Tiffany,Julie is a fantastic host. She made everything super easy for us and was accommodating with check in and check out time. She checked in on us regularly throughout our stay to ensure that we were comfortable. The space is great as well. Located in a convenient part of town and had everything we needed for our stay. The shampoos and toiletries were a welcome touch as well. I would definitely recommend Julie and her apartment!
143704,24336814,2014-12-26,9120130,Jessica,Julie made both my mom and I feel very welcome in their home. The location was very central and made it very easy to travel to other neighborhoods in Seattle. She provides great resources for you to map out your trip. My only concern was that you could hear people upstairs walking around. I myself am a deep sleeper but this could affect others.
143704,24710888,2015-01-02,21939811,Lori,Julie welcomed us and gave us a quick tour of her place and then left us to our own accord.  It was a private space that met our needs.
143704,25144144,2015-01-07,9407200,Sharon,"Julie's downstairs apartment was very comfortable and spacious.  We had everything we needed.  Great location to reach different Seattle venues.  Neighborhood was quiet and plenty of parking.

"
143704,25291433,2015-01-11,25522063,Nicole,Julie was a great host. She welcomed us and gave us a quick tour of her place and throughout the stay she checked in on us to make sure we were comfortable. The place was definitely cozy and her green folder of things to do and how to get around definitely helped out a lot. I loved that the bedroom has dark curtains and is nice and dark for sleeping in. The location was very central and made it very easy to travel to different parts of Seattle. I would definitely consider staying here again if I came back to visit Seattle. 
143704,25440129,2015-01-16,20907711,Vladyslav,"The apartment is exactly like on pictures. Julie was very welcoming and gave us a nice tour. It has nice decorations and art. The floor got a bit cold sometimes, but there was a heater (some were electric fireplaces) in every room (even bathroom) in addition to the central heater. There was also a washing machine which you can use free for the first load and pretty cheap afterwards. "
143704,25602468,2015-01-20,9173189,Sriyutha,"Julie was a wonderful host! Very welcoming and accommodating, our flight arrived late in the night and she stayed up to greet us.  The house was exactly as described, comfortable and cozy!. It was the perfect size for my sister and I.  Also, the location is perfect.  Not in the middle of downtown but a walk or a few min drive away from anything you could want to do in the city.  We really enjoyed staying in a neighborhood rather than in a more touristy area. We took some of Julie's recommendations for nearby coffeehouses and they were fantastic. We hope to visit again sometime in the future!"
143704,26735704,2015-02-18,22628944,Maeve,"Julie made me feel welcomed. Neighborhood okay. Being in the basement w/furnace was noisy making it difficult for me, a lite sleeper. Sometimes way too hot with all the vents open blowing in hot air. Overall, it was okay.  I'm not accustomed to having someone living above me and I could hear Julie when she was on the phone.
Apt. was clean w/enough amenities."
143704,27143973,2015-02-26,5797703,Jeffrey,"Julie was a great  hostess.  She was flexible and accommodating on our time of arrival, and was there to greet us and show us around the apartment.  She was prompt in replying to messages as well.  

The apartment itself is a half basement in-law type apartment, comfortable for two people. Julie had the kitchen stocked with coffee and snacks, which was a plus.  Also, she had a well-curated collection of brochures and books about Seattle.  In particular, we took advantage of the two walk books.  The nearby stair walk of Madrona was great, and we did another from the stair book as well.

The bed is only a full (perhaps double?) size (not queen) so a little snug for two people.  I don't recall if the listing mentioned that.

The heat is controlled by the thermostat in Julie's part of the house, and she offered to turn it up for us.   One morning, the heat was overwhelming, and we had to message Julie to turn it down (which she did promptly, but we felt a little awkward doing it at 7 in the morning).  There were also four space heaters that we could control ourselves when we got a little chilly.

The apartment is close enough to walk to a few coffee shops, Sam's Moroccan Sandwich shop (great, but not fast), and an Ethiopian restaurant that we didn't have time to try.  Definitely check out Chuck's Hops, a beer store cum bar!  You can also walk over to the Madrona neighborhood for some other food options (the Hi Spot was very good for breakfast).  This isn't a fancy/hi end neighborhood.  More down to earth, with a distinct hippie vibe.

So, all in all, a good experience -- a larger bed and more easily controlled heat would make it near perfect."
143704,28131279,2015-03-18,27220958,Amanda,"Julie was a perfect host! Julie was very clear on her expectations and very friendly. She made herself available when needed and checked in with us over the weekend.  The space is clean, organized, and extremely cozy. The neighborhood is adorable and has everything you need within walking distance. The location is great as it is close to all of the great things Seattle has to offer, yet it is off the beaten path enough that city noise is  not an issue. "
143704,28603659,2015-03-27,26847047,Raechel,"Julie met us upon our arrival and gave us a tour of the space and made us feel very welcome.  There were lots of helpful resources in the apartment including walking tours of different neighbourhoods, a stair walk guide and tips about the local area (cafes, grocery stores, etc).  The space was equipped for all our basic needs and the neighbourhood was centrally located with easy access to all Seattle has to offer.  As a bonus...Julie has a beautiful garden which was coming into bloom during our visit. "
143704,29494753,2015-04-08,15032225,Shaun,"Had a great stay over the long weekend at Julie's place.  There was so much to do in a short period  of time and Julie's place worked out perfect.  We had our car so it was a short drive to the city centre, although there was public transit available with maps which Julie provided as well.  The neighborhood was great as well, Julie had some maps and a guidebook of walking routes around Seattle which we used a couple of times  and was a great way to get to know the city and neighborhood.  There was also a fun pub just down the road which was a nice place to unwind in the evening.  All in all we had a great stay and Julie's place was perfect and in a great location, just out of the hustle and bustle of the downtown area."
143704,30298656,2015-04-20,28591904,Sergiy,"Julie is kind, friendly person. Like at home nice, warm atmosphere, great location. We had all we need to spend a great time in Seattle. Public transportation just a minutes walking distance from the house.  Quiet, safe neighborhood."
143704,31450551,2015-05-05,21785243,Stacy,This space was lovely and perfect for my weekend in Seattle.  It is located by four buses that gives you easy access to the downtown area.  Julie was a very friendly host.  She made sure that she was there to greet us and give us a tour of the space.  After that she gave us our privacy but she made it clear that she was reachable if we had any further questions or needed help with anything.  We had everything we needed and the neighborhood was very nice and quiet.  Would definitely stay here again.
143704,31723329,2015-05-09,19544441,Amy,Julie was very attentive and thorough. She was quite nice and her home was in a very convenient location. 
143704,31933916,2015-05-12,27000655,Pamela,Had a wonderful stay in Seattle. Julie was a gracious host and we were very comfortable. The neighborhood was one we were familiar with having lived in Seattle. I liked that it was quiet and close to a lot of our favorite places. I would definitely stay again on next Seattle trip.
143704,32461354,2015-05-18,2684524,Meleesa,"What a great cozy place to stay while in Seattle! For us, it was perfectly located! We were able to walk to local stores, restaurants and coffee! The walking gave you a nice look at the eclectic Seattle neighborhoods. The size of the little apartment was perfect for the two of us, we felt right at home! We chose to get a rental car, which worked great for what we needed to do, however, the public transit is close by. Mapping out your adventures will help you decide if you need your own car or if using the public transportation would be best for you. We had a great time, it never rained on us! Julie was a sweetheart! She wants you to feel at home and is there for you if needed. She gives you lots of information for things to do. We would definitely go back and stay there again! So, if you're looking for a quiet, private place to enjoy your travels to Seattle, definitely check out Julie's place!"
143704,32742655,2015-05-21,25955120,Pa,The neighborhood was very comfortable and quiet. The nearest grocery store was within walking distance and the bus stops were also easy to understand. Julie was an amazing host. She was able to accommodate us on short notice and we also knew we could easily check in with her if we needed anything. The home was also very comfortable to stay in. It was exactly as pictured on the page.
143704,33257900,2015-05-26,30720645,Jessica,"Julie is such an amzing hostess. She took the time (even though we were running late) to explain the area that we were staying in as well as in relation to all the tourist attractions of Seattle.

The place was exactly what we needed- our ""home away from home"". You get what you see in the pcitures and more. If you would like to do a ""Tourist"" trip then know that an Uber drive took us maybe 5 min. and the most we paid to go to the usual attractions was $10. If you would rather walk you can also do that just expect to get to downtaown in about 30 minnutes (downhill). Ladies- no heels for this trip!

All in all, Julie and her private guest Apartment was the perfect place to stay. I reccomend her space for all. "
143704,33573294,2015-05-30,1527706,Connie,"We could not have found a more comfortable place to stay in Seattle!  Location was convenient to downtown yet in a quiet, friendly neighborhood.  Julie has put a lot of thought into the apartment and likes to know if her guests find anything else missing.  At the same time, she keeps the place very private.  It is exactly as pictured and described, so no surprises either.  We would definitely stay there again!"
143704,34116357,2015-06-05,26793325,Mariana,"Dear Julie, 
We had a wonderful week in Seattle. 
You offer a very cozy, comfortable and clean place. It has everything needed to make us feel like we were home. 
Besides there are lots of facilities in the neighborhood and it is very well located for public transportation services. 
There is also complete privacy. 
Many thanks for receiving us. If we visit Seattle again certainly we will try to stay at your place!
Cheers, Mariana "

Julie was such a nice host and was very flexible allowing us to accommodate our 3 years old toddler that wasn't planned in the initial reservation. The neighborhood is very quiet and easy to access by car or public transport. Absolutely recommend!"

Julie was very welcoming and available to answer any questions but respected our privacy. The area is as described with some excellent restaurants within walking distance (cafe flora, Arayas thai) and with good access to public transport. Would recommend. "

143704,43020140,2015-08-17,25542686,Kiley,"Julie was such a warm and welcoming host. She explained everything so well at check in, and she provides so much helpful information about the area. The apartment was even cozier than pictured. It's the perfect size for two people. The bed was so comfy, the backyard gorgeous, and all of the facilities in good condition. She made herself available if we needed anything. Besides being a wonderful apartment, this place is a great location for exploring Seattle. It's very easy to access downtown and many other neighborhoods from here. We wished we could have stayed a few days longer. "
143704,43750157,2015-08-22,2646681,Julie Lou,"Julie is a wonderful hostess! She made an effort to make us and our 2 kids comfortable by providing toys and books - things that the toddler actually used. (The other is an infant.) Further, the patio was very nice!"
143704,44282161,2015-08-25,13779605,Allan,"The cozy space is in a lovely leafy quiet Seattle neighbourhood but has awesome transport links to get you wherever you need to go.   Parking is right outside and readily available.   Julie has clearly put a lot if time and love into making the space as homely and welcoming as possible and it shows.   The local area has some great cafes, bars and restaurants.   Two thumbs up and 5 stars."
143704,45366251,2015-09-02,22349944,Bonnie,"Very clean, bed is a bit small. Julie is very attentive to any needs, but never intrudes. Very easy to get downtown, just walk two blocks over and there is a nice coffee shop to start the day across from the bus stop. Bus comes every 15 minutes or so and goes straight to the downtown core and pike place. We stayed here while attending a convention at the convention centre and it was very easy to get there and back. "
143704,45661751,2015-09-05,19628818,Elisa,"Perfect apartment, perfect host, perfectly located. Nothing more perfect ! Quiet and cozy. Thank you so much for being so kind Julie, i will definitely recommand"
143704,46264813,2015-09-09,31903166,Anu,"Accommodation as described and in the photos. Location is good, close to the city centre but quiet and peaceful. Situated in a residential neighborhood but there are shops and restaurants nearby, e.g. a Grocery Outlet just a couple of blocks away. Julie was a great host: quick responses and we felt welcome. She gave us good tips and info on the city. Recommended if you prefer a peaceful place to stay."
143704,46601195,2015-09-12,16751766,Emily,"Julie's place was absolutely perfect . The space was just as promised and had just what we needed for a relaxing stay. Julie really takes pride in providing a great experience. She personally walked us through the space when we arrived even though we were late. We had total privacy, but she was always avail via text.  This is a very walkable, charming neighborhood and easily accessible to all popular neighborhoods via uber. We didn't try the bus, but there are four lines to walk to...Julie provided maps.  Would definitely stay again when we return to Seattle. "
143704,47028953,2015-09-15,20401,Jennifer,"Clean, pleasant, easy and readily available parking, was met and host explained every thing, nice location"
143704,47375473,2015-09-18,37179654,Leander,"Perfect location for exploring Seattle! This place is located in Central District and you get almost everywhere in approx. 15-20 minutes. It is really very easy!!
Julie is a great host. She does everything for you enjoying your stay as much as possible! She also has the right balance to ask you for any needs and give you enough privacy.
The place has plenty of space for 2 persons! I can totally recommend staying with Julie."

143704,48377378,2015-09-26,33554301,Peter,"Julie war super nett und zuvorkommend. Sie hat regelmäßig per Airbnb Message nachgefragt ob es uns gut geht und ob sie noch etwas für uns tun kann. In der Unterkunft waren für alles und mehr gesorgt. Auch Flyer von Seattle und Umgebung, ein Laptop, DVDs, Bücher stand bereit. Außerdem gibt es einen Ordner mit FAQs, Karten, Buslinien, nächsten Restaurants, Coffe Shops und Supermärkten.
Julie hat sich sehr viel Mühe gegeben, damit ihre Gäste alles haben was sie brauchen und sich wohl fühlen. Eben ein richtiger Cozyspace :)"
143704,49095162,2015-10-01,33368244,Marjolein,"We hebben genoten van ons verblijf bij Julie!
Ze is een geweldige gastvrouw, we voelden ons heel welkom! Ze nam de tijd om ons rond te leiden bij aankomst en ook tijdens ons verblijf was ze heel behulpzaam en betrokken.
Het appartement is van alle gemakken voorzien en ligt in een leuke wijk, vlakbij bushaltes. "
143704,49759265,2015-10-06,18071798,Dinah,"I really enjoyed my stay at Julie's Airbnb. It is located in a beautiful neighborhood, conveniently located and easily accessible to downtown Seattle. The space was cozy indeed, tastefully decorated, very clean, and private. I was provided everything I could need and more, and the little details (coffee and tea available, toiltetries, etc) were appreciated. Julie was very welcoming of me to the space and communication with her was reliable if needed. "
143704,50102529,2015-10-09,41772550,Echo,Julie is a very nice host and her house was located in a quiet and beautiful neighborhood. It's really convenient to get to everywhere in around 20 minutes. Highly recommended!

143704,51461471,2015-10-20,15033052,Einsrich,"시애틀 다운타운 부근의 주택가에 위치한 줄리의 집은 매우 조용하면서 교통은 편리한 곳에 위치한 곳입니다.
여기에서 대중교통수단을 이용하면 시애틀 주요지역으로 쉽게 이동이 가능한 곳에 위치해 있습니다.

호스트인 Julie씨도 매우 따뜻하고 친절합니다.
한국어(구글 번역기를 활용한) 사용 설명서도 준비해주셔서 체류기간 동안 많은 도움이 되었습니다.

집은 반지하에 있지만 아기자기한 인테리어와 다양한 조명으로 그러한 기분이 전혀 들지 않습니다.  무료 와이파이는 인터넷을 고속으로 이용 가능합니다.
호스트에게 부족한 부분은 얼마든지 요청하면 바로 도움을 받을 수 있지만,
그 어떠한 요청이 있기전에 호스트인 줄리는 방문객의 프라이버시를 위해 어떠한 간섭도 하지 않습니다.

저희가 방문하던날 친절한 julie씨는 신혼여행중인 저희를 환영해주기 위해 스파클링 와인(무알콜)과 와인잔을 준비해주었습니다.

빨래는 세탁실에 세탁기와 건조기를 활용해 매일 처리 가능합니다.

짧은 시애틀 여정에 아쉬움이 많지만, 있는 동안에 매우 편리하고 편안했습니다.

다음에 또 다시 방문하고 싶은 집입니다.

한국인들도 많이 이용하셨습으면 좋겠습니다.(하지만 호스트와 소통을 위해서 약간의 영어능력은 필수입니다.)"
143704,52077069,2015-10-26,23872741,Krista,"Julie was wonderful! She's definitely earned ""super host"" status and continues to work to keep it! She was ready to greet us when we arrived and gave us a brief tour of the apartment (located in the basement of her home). The space was exactly as it appeared in the photos and as described. Julie was quick but thorough in her tour. The bed was very comfortable, and her description mentions that there are heaters if it's cool - it was cool in the evenings and morning since it was October, but there were plenty of blankets to keep us warm. We also loved how environmentally-friendly Julie - and all of Seattle seems to be - and we brought some of those good habits home with us! Overall, an awesome first experience in Seattle!"
143704,52844958,2015-11-02,44034808,Peter,"Julie was an incredible host and made our stay in Seattle very comfortable! Our area always felt private and we never once felt intruded upon. Julie made planning our trip very simple with a multitude of magazines and other resources that were full of great information. She checked in on us once a day to make sure we had everything we needed, and always treated us with extreme kindness. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking to explore Seattle, and we will definitely come back next time we stay in Seattle!"
143704,53486732,2015-11-09,34582989,Kim,"Clean, quiet, warm, safe part of town, easy street parking. Bus lines a couple blocks away, gym and grocery stores close. We would stay here again and send our friends here.

Owner lives upstairs and is very quiet. Julie's information packet left for guests and her walk through are VERY helpful in making sure you go to the best local pool, etc.

She also had a bicycle and local cloth shopping bags for guests to use. This was a great idea for helping us NOT look like tourists carrying money when we went shopping downtown! "
143704,53895958,2015-11-14,46148953,Aaron,"Great place to stay.  Nice location, Julie was a great host, excellent accommodations!  "
143704,54248620,2015-11-17,37609411,Krystle &,"We couldn't have asked for a better experience! As soon as we got to the house, we were greeted with a warm welcome accompanied by a big smile. The tour of the house began with an insightful guide to all of Seattle. Julie shared amazing knowledge on how to get around and about the city; whether it be public transportation, great places to visit, and information about parking. Not to mention, along with an array of guides and books will also help aid with your travel decisions! After giving us a tour of the city, she gave us a brief, yet thorough tour of the house. She showed us where everything was and explained how to use everything in the space in great detail. After the tour of the house, she told us to let her know if there was anything we needed, at all, don't hesitate to ask or let her know. She wasn't kidding! Whatever questions we asked, or anything we needed, she would respond swiftly! Julie also would check in on us once a day to make sure we were as comfortable as can be, which we were. Checking out was a breeze, and she also bid us farewell upon our departure. So, if you are looking for a great place to stay in Seattle, I highly recommend staying here. It is such a beautiful area, and is convenient because it is close to everything. But most importantly, Julie is an amazing host and will make your stay one of the most comfortable and enjoyable experiences! We're definitely returning when we get the chance! "
143704,54970736,2015-11-27,37340984,Sarah,"My husband and I had a fantastic time staying in Julie's cozy Seattle apartment. Julie was extremely warm and welcoming upon our arrival and gave us a quick tour of the apartment, complete with recommendations of things to do and see in the area. The apartment had everything we needed during our stay and was the perfect place to return to after a long day of touring. It's also very centrally located in Seattle, which made it easy for us to get downtown or up to the Fremont/University areas in about 10-15 minutes. I highly recommend staying with Julie in Seattle!"
143704,55516818,2015-12-01,49659129,Fernando,"Julie was phenomenal! Her basement is located in the Central District of Seattle so you're pretty much close to everything. The place was very clean, comfortable and beautiful (the pictures don't lie). Upon arrival she gave us a tour of her place which was very thorough. She had brochures and maps to help us plan our activities. Highly recommend her to anyone and we will definitely book her again!"
143704,56250965,2015-12-11,45398481,Lisa,"Julie was a very gracious host who gave me my privacy and checked in with me each day to make sure I was comfortable. Her place was very clean and equipped with space heaters, snacks, tea, and coffee. I very much enjoyed my stay. "
143704,56680674,2015-12-16,48643666,Julian,"We had a very nice stay at Julie's. Despite a scheduling mishap, Julie was nothing but friendly and made us feel welcome during our check-in. The apartment is cozy and comfortable, even during the heavy weather we were having, and the location was a great launch pad for exploring the city. Plis Julie was very respectful of our space. We would definitely stay here again. Our only regret is forgetting to sign the guest book!"
143704,56844048,2015-12-19,57372,David,L'appartement est dans le sous-sol de la maison et exactement décrit dans la liste.  Le propriétaire Julie était utile et a respecté mon désir de se reposer sans interruption.
143704,57213621,2015-12-23,47513263,Paul,"Julie welcomed my girlfriend and I into her home with open arms.  The listing was as accurate as it can be and the neighborhood was quiet and nice.  She gave us a quick tour about everything in the entire space which was nice as we knew where to go for anything that was on the listing.

Central heating worked wonders as well as the additional room heaters provided by Julie.  The bed was nice and the pillows were comfy.  Wi-fi worked great.

Julie also checked in every day by text just to see how we were doing and if there were any concerns but we didn't have any during our 4 day stay.

If you have a car there's a ton of residential parking but it's definitely like 4-5 minutes from a bus stop that can take you anywhere as the Central District is.. you guessed it, in the middle of Seattle.

Bonus: 
- donates a portion of the proceeds to a non-profit
- gives off a very Seattle vibe by living away from Downtown with little signs and reminders about conserving water, using environmentally friendly chemicals, and composting
- Complimentary tea/coffee/snacks"
143704,57627021,2015-12-28,12586890,Sharon,"Julie was the perfect host. She made us feel very welcomed and provided a welt of knowledge in the form of brochures and other literature. She was always just a text away if we needed her and was quick to reply. The apartment was well kitted out in terms of toiletries and appliances.  The apartment was conveniently located near bus stops for easy access to the city centre and other locations, along with a cheap food store.

Overall staying at Julie's place was a positive experience but I can't give it 5 stars due to certain things personally affecting me and my boyfriend. Others may have no issues with the following:

As we were out of town during Christmas we were relying on wifi to Skype home. We had issues with quality and connectivity. It would often drop connection and then reconnect moments later.
The heating system would activate periodically through out the night, sometimes it would wake us sometimes it wouldn't. If you were a light sleeper I could see it being an problem.
The bed while comfy and cozy was small for two people. 

As I said it was a positive experience and if the above doesn't trouble you then I would highly recommend staying here.

Small and basic rooms in a large house in the U district, its nothing fancy but its great if you just need a dependable place to stay in walking distance of the university."

The neighborhood was great, I love the Udistrict and found it to be the perfect environment to get work done.  I would recommend Melissa to everyone looking for a place in Seattle on Air BnB. "
1534622,19656113,2014-09-15,20537275,Cyprien,"Cute little room. Clean. You have a desk to put a laptop. Bathroom nearby, clean too. You will share it with others roommates but I didn't have any schedule issue. Free laundry in the basement. 
Melissa was nice, she checked everything was fine."

I am a transfer student to the University of Washington and I was looking for a place to live when I first got to town. Melissa's place was a good place to crash after a long day of apartment hunting and running errands. The place is simple, but practical. The Wifi was fast and the sheets were soft, and that's about all I needed. Thanks Melissa!"
1534622,21882284,2014-10-26,763370,Vim,"Room as described. Was under the I I I had the impression that it would be cleaned twice weekly, but it turned out to be every two weeks. House was quite old and squeaky. OK stay over all"
1534622,27265130,2015-03-01,26482179,Matt,"The place was as stated: quiet. Though I did not meet the host until about two weeks after checking is, she was nice and friendly. There were three or four other people staying there; but you wouldn't really know it because they all kept to themselves. As far as the neighborhood goes, it is mellow, no crazy parties like you would hear when closer to the UW campus. Bus lines were close and so were all the essential stores. University Village is about 10 minutes away via walking. "
1534622,28583119,2015-03-26,20992789,Lin,之所以用中文觉得可以推荐给更多的华人朋友。Melissa，是一位很热情的房东。在西雅图期间给了我一些建议！很乐于助人。房间可以满足生活的各种要求！而且其他室友好相处。都来自不同国家！有很多可以谈论的。房子的位置很好靠近UW购物中心！坐bus很方便。距离downtown，大概20多分钟。以后过来还会选择这里。

I would recommend staying at the house.Lovely house and host.
I felt satisfied:)"
1534622,34318689,2015-06-07,32807993,Geunwon,"I had stayed in this room for a month and the room looks same as it is in the photo. I haven't met the host Melissa even once but there was no problem for me. She asked me to wash the beddings before I leave, and it was a little exotic experience to me because it is always the host's job in my home country. I had to unclog the toilet on the date I arrived and the bed was a little uncomfortable for me. Except for these, I really enjoyed my stay here! The location and neighborhood is really, really awesome ; clean, safe, quiet, and convenient. Everything is in a walking distance, plus the transportation is really easy of access. You don't necessarily rent a car to live here. I was satisfied for almost every aspect of this room and I will miss my stay here in U village."

1534622,46290973,2015-09-09,38890991,Federico,"I stayed in this room for 3 days during the Labor Day weekend. The room is quiet and comfortable, as it looks in the pictures. The only thing is that there is not much sunlight because the window is small.
The location is very close to the University and about 10-15 minutes driving to any other place in Seattle. Plenty of street parking too.
There are two bathrooms (shared with the other guests) which were always clean.
I didn't meet Melissa because I was out most of the time, but she wrote to check if everything was fine on the first day. 
Overall I was happy with my stay and the price is very reasonable. I will definitely go there again if I return to Seattle."
1534622,53179081,2015-11-06,44041794,Perry,"The room was just as it was described in the listing. The host was very helpful and quick to respond to any questions that I had.  I enjoyed my stay and would stay here again if I am ever back in the neighborhood.  The room is very close to UW, university village, and the Burke-Gillman trail making everything easy to access.  The neighborhood is nice, quiet, and safe. Nice place to stay for long or short term."
3859882,18834523,2014-09-01,3745845,Trevor,"Joan and Markos were the perfect host! The house itself is super cool, and it's situated right next to Lake Washington. Markos was a great host and made sure that we were comfortable at all times. He is an excellent Sculptor and gardener.  The garden was absolutely beautiful — it was relaxing to wake up and sit outside with a fresh cup of coffee before heading out for the day. Markos often joined us for breakfast and we had some great conversations.

The light rail and bus stations are relatively close to the house. Although, if possible, I would recommend renting a car. It's about a 25 minute walk to the light rail station; the bus stop is much closer. We ended up taking Uber the last two days to save time. Markos was very nice and picked us up from the light rail station  when we arrived (and we arrived around midnight)  and he also drove us to the station one of the days. 

Overall, I would recommend this house. The price is great and they're very accommodating. I only wish we could have stayed longer to see more of the city and enjoy the beautiful location!

Thanks again Joan and Markos!"
3859882,35827998,2015-06-22,34232640,Steve,"Joan and Markos are longtime residents of the area, and were great about sharing their insider knowledge of good places to eat, and things to do and see. They were very warm, accommodating hosts, and made us feel right at home from the moment we arrived. Their spacious, stately home is perched on a hill with an excellent view of Lake Washington from the secluded backyard garden patio. The large room we rented had all the comforts: its own adjoining bathroom, speedy wireless, and a really comfortable bed. This was our first experience with Airbnb so we weren’t sure what to expect. Joan and Markos have certainly set a hospitality standard! It was a pleasure meeting you both and we look forward to staying with you again. Highly recommended!"
3859882,36294494,2015-06-27,3001133,Stefani,"Great private room with large bathroom! With fresh coffees daily :) About a mile from light rail, with a car or lyft it's easy to get to all parts of Seattle! Thanks Joan and Markos! "
3859882,36815494,2015-07-01,35867258,Rick,"I would never hesitate to recommend this place. Joan and Markos are the best host I have ever met. They are easy-going and quite helpful. We spent 4 nights there and I really enjoy staying with them, even more than the city itself. Beautiful yard, lovely puppy,  unforgettable lakeview and clean house. I would say this is absolutely anothet attraction in Seattle you should not miss. Thank you Joan and Markos!"

7748349,42981492,2015-08-16,36570559,Katherine,"Neil was very easy to communicate with. The room was clean and actually bigger than I expected! Easy access to the restroom, and only a 15 minute drive to most Seattle attractions."
7748349,43443438,2015-08-19,22052633,M,Neil was the best! Very accommodating and very easy to communicate with. I highly recommend this airbnb!!
7748349,44726134,2015-08-28,15145266,Ben,"Neil was an amazing Airbnb host.  He was super quick to communicate, very considerate, and frequently went beyond the call of duty to make my stay comfortable.  Without a doubt, the best Airbnb host I've had."
7748349,45425723,2015-09-02,4649617,Genelle,Neil was an awesome host and clearly has been doing this for some time. He had drawers and cupboards marked in common spaces so that everything was easy to find and was very helpful when we had questions about getting around on the bus. He even provided us with loadable bus cards so we didn't have to bother with change for bus fare! The room was also exactly as described and we had no issues with privacy. Overall it was a great experience and we'd be happy to stay with Neil again if we ever find ourselves back in Seattle. 
7748349,46035828,2015-09-07,42327406,Ryan,"Neil was a great host! The room in North Seattle is close to public transit and you can get into the city fast. Neil was very accommodating, the room and bathroom was clean, the vibe was good. As a first airbnb user, I could not think of a better experience. I would definitely recommend Neil and this property for someone looking to have a nice time in Seattle."
7748349,47102212,2015-09-15,43219327,Jeremy,"Good stay, quiet place."
7748349,47825322,2015-09-21,13398360,子矜,"Neil is a perfect host！he is so friendly and helpful. The room I lived was actually much more spacious than I thought. There are pamphlets about traveling tips in Seattle and umbrella and shopping bags for guests, which are so considerate!"
7748349,50945348,2015-10-16,43883559,Nikolai,"Neil is a great and welcoming host and a nice and friendly person.  He gives you a lot of privacy, but he is also fun to talk to. The room is simple as said in the description (small bed, desk, wardrobe and a few chairs), except it is much larger than what I would call a small room.  The house is nice and clean, located in a safe and quiet neighbourhood. A transit center/mall is within walking distance (15min). I stayed at Neil's house for three weeks while visiting the University of Washington (and extended my stay). I highly recommend booking a room at Neil's house."
7748349,52029263,2015-10-25,16598480,Dennis,I never got to meet Neil since my visit to Seattle was quick. But I have to I had a great stay. House and room were nice and clean. Plenty of parking. Good neighborhood. I will definitely be stain there again.
7748349,52942947,2015-11-02,47707906,Travis,This place was great! Neil's instructions on check in were clear and precise. Everything is the kitchen is labeled if you wish to use it. The room was had a computer desk with monitor for use.  The location is in a quite neighborhood and only 15 min drive into the city. When I return to Seattle I will definitely try and stay there again. 
7748349,55420124,2015-12-01,37844083,Jennifer,"I stayed with Neil for a little over a month. He was welcoming and hospitable, always asking me if there was something he could help me with. The room was spacious and comfortable. The house is enormous and there are several little spots to sit and hang out. I would stay with Neil again. He's a great host and a super helpful person. "
7748349,56266992,2015-12-11,37844083,Jennifer,"Neil is an amazing host. He's warm and welcoming, and he is always aware of what a guest might need. I stayed in the small bedroom at his house for over a month, and I always felt safe and comfortable in his home. Great place for a short or long stay. "
7748349,57418610,2015-12-25,50162276,Matt,The host canceled this reservation 10 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
607788,1816238,2012-07-27,3010074,Pablo,"Jacqueline was really fast on her replies (something I really appreciate while doing a booking) and extremely helpful! So thumbs up for her!
"
607788,8144101,2013-10-17,9283314,Michael,"Maggie was very helpful and always quick to respond. She went out of her way to accommodate my dates.  The condo was excellent for my needs.  It is a cozy studio, with a very comfortable Murphy bed.  The staff were very helpful and courteous.  I would definitely recommend."
66611,175291,2011-01-27,326414,Austin,"I enjoyed a rather comfortable and delightful stay in Carol's Wedgwood residence. Quiet and peaceful, it is an ideal place for concentration, meditation, relaxation, and creation. Carol was a most accommodating and genuine hostess. I plan on highly considering this place of stay for future Seattle visits."
66611,349240,2011-07-03,517389,Uli,"The house is located in a great neighbourhood with good bus connections to downtown and the University of Washington. It was very easy to get around on foot and by bus and I had a great time exploring the city and Wedgewood. Carol was very welcoming and helpful when I arrived.  She is interested in getting to know the people staying in her house in an unobtrusive way and we had a number of fun conversations over the kitchen counter. The house has interesting artwork dotted around the place, which gives it a fun and warm atmosphere. I  really enjoyed staying at Carol's and would go back if I need to go to Seattle again."
66611,495184,2011-09-02,841159,Roxanne,"Carol's home is very welcoming and in a great location. I stayed for the month while I was looking for a permanent place to live. It is close to grocery stores, a pharmacy, and a great little crepe cafe. It is a bit far from the UW campus, which is where I was going each day, but close to bus stops:) Overall, it was exactly what I needed and I met some great people while staying here."
66611,537665,2011-09-16,1135065,Ronald,Staying with BB was such a pleasure she was easy to contact.  She help me to get set up and welcomed me into her home.  The room was perfect I had fresh towels a great study area a separate entrance and my own fridge.  If I ever need a place again I would defiantly choose BB’s place again
66611,562311,2011-09-24,988000,Ly,"Study Den room is spacious and comfortable, I had a very good time there. Carol's house is near a bus stop but still very far from Downtown Seattle and UW.
Mrs. carol is a nice, friendly and helpful person.
"
66611,658013,2011-10-24,962602,Margaret,"Carol is the epitome of gracious hospitality and the ideal airbnb host -- kind, helpful, generous and never intrusive. An accomplished artist and fascinating conversationalist, she attracts intelligent, interesting guests who leave better off for having known her. I immensely enjoy staying at the Study Den, which is spacious, comfortable and private. Carol deserves top marks in all categories. I highly recommend staying with her."
66611,1985982,2012-08-14,2086639,Joe,"Staying with Carol (BB) was straightforward and a great deal for what I needed on my 3-day solo trip to Seattle. The study den is a basement room in her house, and met all my needs. 

The neighborhood is a quiet and mellow one, so if you're looking to get away from the hustle bustle this is a great place to stay. I was a short-term stay at just 3 days, visiting my brother who lived in the neighborhood but had a packed house. "
66611,2175722,2012-09-02,3381956,Alysia,"Clean, spacious room with ample closet space. Comfortable bed and linens. Carol was a gracious host and was accommodating for my early check in request as I was in town for social reasons. 

Enjoyed my stay in a very quiet neighborhood."
66611,2256120,2012-09-10,2034862,Kim,"Carol was a great host as this was my first week back in Seattle, I needed that friendly face and warmth to just relax and regroup.  Her home is comfortable with a private entrance and a big room.  She is helpful and engaging and available .  She respects your privacy but has her own wonderful life experiences to share that were wonderful to hear about.  A perfect place close in, easy to park, walking distance to bus, coffee, grocery stores.  "
66611,2373695,2012-09-22,3503147,Tyler,"I stayed in this room for about one week.  The room was very large, and the house was in a nice, quiet neighborhood.  For the price, you can't beat it!"
66611,3343579,2013-01-14,4337303,David,"Pro: Carol is friendly and accommodating. Price is good.
Con: Dirty bathroom, mold around the tub. The so-called 'study den' is really a room in the basement. You can hear people walking around in the floor above you, since the area between the kitchen and the other guest rooms is right over the basement room. The noise is annoying and disturbing and will wake you when you are sleeping. And this will happen several times a night."
66611,4377692,2013-05-01,5435797,Natalia,"Perfect and wonderful stay at Study Den! Really happy I found this room, and my time in Seattle couldnt be better :) Thank you, Carol!"
66611,5107134,2013-06-12,6198111,Steven,Carons place was great! very nice end easy going place to stay. I would recommend it to my friends.
66611,5273791,2013-06-22,2026318,Gaelle,"Another great stay with Carol! Lovely neighbourhood and so quiet, which is great to come back to after spending a busy day in downtown Seattle. "
66611,6629430,2013-08-19,7532925,Hannah,"This was my first experience with Airbnb, and Carol made it an especially pleasant one. She was always very friendly and ready to help with anything I needed. The study den was a comfortable and spacious room, and was very private from the rest of the house. If you're looking for a nice, quiet place to return to after a long day in Seattle, I definitely recommend staying here!"
66611,13257006,2014-05-23,15396337,Chen,"Carol is a nice host providing necessary help. The room I rented was comfortable and neat, and I can get everything I need from the supermarket around the house. I would expect next Airbnb at Carol's at Seattle."
66611,13553712,2014-05-30,15903659,Christopher,"I had a great stay at Carol's place.  Very quiet, calm, and the private entry is great.  She is a very nice person as well.  Highly recommended.  "
66611,20013593,2014-09-22,18785705,明日香,"I stayed Carol's house for a month. She welcomed me warmly, and gave me information what I need. The neighbor has a lot of green and quiet. Artistic and cozy room. It was perfect stay in Seattle! When I visit Seattle next time, I'll stay Carol's house again!"
66611,20580138,2014-10-01,5279919,Phillip,"Carol is a great host and very friendly. The location is good, and the stay is quite affordable. However, I had minor issues which make it not 100%. There were cobwebs in some unwanted places. Also, the bathroom amenities and dishes were in a bit of disarray. "
66611,32543768,2015-05-19,24950835,Patricia,The neighborhood was ideal for my trip.  A quiet and peaceful location.  Carol was kind and considerate as a host.  I chose to sleep in my VW camper van since the weather was lovely and the parking space is tucked in under the canopy of a maple tree.  I found everything that I needed in the well stocked kitchen with plenty of room in the fridge for storage.   
3352685,15597854,2014-07-12,17410139,Jared,Allison was a very friendly and accommodating host. The house and location were excellent. It was easy to get to the bus to downtown and there were several nice parks within walking distance. 
3352685,25301926,2015-01-11,25606759,Carrla,"My husband and I ABSOLUTELY LOVED the ""Treehouse"", and all the comforts Allison had provided. Upon first walking through the door, we automatically knew we had made the right choice as where to spend a cozy, romantic weekend for our anniversary. We honestly never left till it was time to pick up our daughter! Allison even left us a bottle of yummy wine to add to our celebration! We will DEFINITELY go back as soon as possible!"
3352685,27501938,2015-03-06,27182324,James,"Allison was an excellent host. Leading up to our week in Seattle, Allison did a phenomenal job of providing information about Seattle, necessary logistics, and things that we were interested in doing.

Although we did not get a chance to meet Allison in person, she was extremely responsive to all of our needs/asks. The treehouse is the perfect getaway for a couple to experience Seattle. It is a short walking distance from the main streets of Capital Hill, or a quick bus ride on the 49. This treehouse is amazing and especially unique - I have never experienced an Airbnb that had both a piano and a record player! The treehouse was overall cozy - the bed was great and there was a nice fireplace to keep things warm. There is a small kitchen, so making a large meal could be a challenge, but all of the essentials are there. Nonetheless, I would highly recommend experiencing Seattle from this vantage point - it is a trip I will never forget! "
3352685,28029809,2015-03-16,28418165,Brett,We enjoyed our stay in the treehouse! The space was exactly as described. Allison was very accommodating. She was available if we needed anything but she also did not impose. Check in/out was a breeze.
3352685,28195399,2015-03-19,16236749,Bob,Very cool place to stay right in the middle of Seattle. Allison was very helpful. As a bonus the place is only a short drive from some of the best restaurants and nightlife in Seattle. 
3352685,28812035,2015-03-30,22861173,Becca,"The treehouse was just as charming as it seems online.  Allison gave great directions for finding it and was incredibly accommodating in leaving extra pillows and blankets so that we could use the couch for additional sleeping space. It's not quite walkable to the bars and restaurants, but it's only a short Uber ride away, which we utilized with ease. We played records, tinkered on the piano, and enjoyed walking up among the trees! "
3352685,29743814,2015-04-12,14606809,Charley,Everything was great! enjoyed the piano and the record player. Peaceful treehouse with a nice view of the lake!
3352685,30676492,2015-04-26,28422018,Katie,The treehouse was just as described by Allison. It was a perfect place for my husband and I to stay while in Seattle for a couple of days. The neighborhood was very safe and was near the majority of sites we wanted to see while we were in town. 
3352685,31217742,2015-05-03,25827411,Miyoko,"We're from California and stayed the weekend here for our anniversary because it's been my husband's dream to stay in a tree house! It was absolutely adorable, and the location was perfect for our sightseeing plans. There is a full kitchen, so we made breakfasts there while listening to Aretha Franklin on Allison's record player. If you're planning to stay here, just remember it's a tree house so it's a little more rustic than a hotel. However, that's also what makes it so charming!

Allison as a host was very responsive especially during our visit there. "
3352685,34454707,2015-06-08,2984804,Bryan,Allison was an amazing host. Her communication leading up to our arrival was great she answered all our question in a timely manner. This place was in a great location close to everything. There was everything you could ever need in a place. Allison even left a personalized not upon arrival. Can't wait to come back and stay again. 
3258585,14320008,2014-06-16,11788224,Bec,"Andrews place was beautiful! It was in a great location, super easy to get to from the airport - only a short walk to the light rail which goes straight downtown. We didn't actually get to meet Andrew as he was away for the weekend but he was so generous and helpful, the whole experience was such a breeze! Beacon Hill is also an amazing base for exploring Seattle. Would love to stay again some day. Also the bed was amazingly comfy. "
3258585,14497206,2014-06-20,16824893,Philippe,"Andrew was amazing and extremely helpful. He wrote a long list of places to visit for our coastal road trip. House:  Everything was exactly as described. I highly recommend staying at his place. 
Thanks again "
3258585,14534368,2014-06-21,4210181,Emma Lou,"Andrew was a great host and his place was just what we needed after a long day of ferries and driving. We arrived in the early evening and all sat around talking for a few hours at the big wooden table in his kitchen over a glass of wine. We made a little food and then, exhausted, headed straight to bed. 

The bed may have honestly been the most comfortable I've ever slept in. We both slept so well and in the morning, Andrew left fruit (fresh raspberries from the backyard!) and granola out for breakfast on his way to work. Wonderful strong shower head in the bathroom and lovely, spacious, clean place all around. Highly recommended!"
3258585,14661694,2014-06-23,16149397,Gina,"The Hill House was perfect for my weekend stay. The neighborhood is very quiet and I enjoyed several long walks exploring the area. The room was cozy, clean & comfortable -- as is the rest of the house. I also appreciated having a ""home base"" VERY close to the Mountains to Sound/I-90 bike trail as I took the train up from Portland with my bicycle. Andrew was very accommodating and is a great host!"
3258585,14808217,2014-06-26,10573354,Asheya,"Andrew was very accommodating to our last minute request for a place to stay in Seattle, and his place was just perfect for our needs. The room was simple and clean, and the work he has put into the house gives it a modern, cozy charm. We spent the morning at his long, wooden, plank table getting work done remotely (wifi was excellent) while the dog, Dakota, kept us company. Dakota might have actually been the best thing about the place; calm and friendly, she made the place feel very homey. The fresh raspberries in the backyard were a close second! Andrew provided some granola for breakfast, which was a real treat and very helpful. It only took us 15 minutes (maybe even less) to get to our appointment on Lake Union from his house. We look forward to staying with Andrew again!."
3258585,15339170,2014-07-07,16562274,Hanne,"We enjoyed the stay at Andrew's. He's a relaxed guy and pleasant host: social and helpful at the right moment, but also on the background when you need to do your own thing. His dog Dakota is lovely, just a sweet animal. I (Mark, Hanne's husband) have nothing against, but also no connection with, pets, and even I loved the dog.

The house is nice, with a nice porch and back garden (berries!) and well equipped kitchen. We're used to have the kitchen table as main center in our own house, and felt right at home at Andrew's. 

It's located near a light rail (ten minute walk) which gets you to a) Seattle and b) Sea-Tac airport pretty quick and consistently. 

As said, we enjoyed our stay and can recommend staying at Andrew's."
3258585,15498947,2014-07-10,7285571,Guillaume,"The room is large and clean, the house has all what you need to cook and is very close to a lot of bus lines. So if you don't have a car you can get in downtown in less than 20 minutes. 
Andrew is super friendly, and will give you a lot of advices for your trip. 
And if you don't go for all this, at least go for his delicious homemade raspberries jam.
"
3258585,15556324,2014-07-11,10573354,Asheya,"This was the second time we stayed with Andrew and it was great! He was flexible on our arrival time so we got to take a nap before our evening appointment, and we stayed the morning. Andrew is great to talk to, Dakota the dog was a love bug, and we hope he has availability the next time we are in Seattle!"
3258585,15589662,2014-07-12,16784401,Jennifer,Andrew was great and hospitable! He picked us up from the nearest Metro station from the Airport and drove us into Downtown in the morning. We were only staying overnight for a cruise the next morning and he was very accommodating.  Comfortable room and adorable house. He also has a very friendly black lab.
3258585,16034508,2014-07-20,16556507,Ladinu,"This was my first time using airbnb and the experience exceeded expectations. The bed was surprisingly comfortable. It was about 35min walk to downtown Seattle from Andrew's house. On the way down you will see the best view of Seattle.

If I ever visit Seattle in the future, I definitely would stay at this place."
3258585,16410203,2014-07-27,2137655,Amanda,"Andrew is a very generous and accommodating host. We stayed in his house for a couple of weeks while we were looking for a home of our own. Not only is he a nice guy (he gave me a ride to work on my first day!), his house is inviting and beautiful. He lives close to a park, the sports stadiums, major highways, quick buses to downtown, and light rail. Can't really beat it. He also has an adorable dog who is very friendly (she'll be very happy to play fetch with you). Can't recommend Andrew and his place more. "
3258585,16625978,2014-07-30,8599437,Michal,"I haven't met Andrew. Too bad, but I enjoyed staying at his place for two nights. It was a cool experience. He has got realy nice house close to downtown. If you looking for a place in Seattle ...choose Bacon hill house:)"
3258585,16778373,2014-08-02,13582110,Dean,"Andrew's house was very well located. Not too far from downtown or the light rail link station if you don't feel like walking too far.  The bedroom was spacious and comfortable.

Andrew was very welcoming and helped us out with planning our days in Seattle.  We had a great time talking to him about his travels and experiences.  It was very much like staying with an old friend.  "
3258585,16853447,2014-08-03,1028326,Jenny And Alex,"We loved staying with Andrew.  He was EXTREMELY accommodating - picking us up late as the bus stop, and finding a map of the Olympic Penninsula to review our trip plans.  We were there for an extremely short stay but Andrew and Dakota were lovely hosts.  Oh and the house is super cute with a great backyard!"
3258585,17105106,2014-08-07,10696109,John,A great house in a fantastic location. Easy walk to downtown. Totally laid-back host.
3258585,17216577,2014-08-09,12660946,Anthony,"We just stayed one nifht at Andrew's place but we had a very long and nice talk. Andrew is a nice host, very friendly and does whatever he can to get our stay as nice as possible. We recommend him!"
3258585,17625558,2014-08-15,477382,Heather,"The room was perfect! It was clean and big, and Andrew's home is lovely. The location is great, too. We managed to either walk or take the bus everywhere we wanted to go, and it was super easy. Dakota the dog is a well-behaved sweetheart. Thanks so much, Andrew!"
3258585,17869363,2014-08-18,2424638,Krisell,"Staying at Andrew's place was a convenient location not too far from the city and not too far from the airport. It was easy for my husband and I to get around walking and by public transit. If you have a car, everything is within a short drive. The house was clean, the bed was comfy, and the dog friendly. That's all that matters, right? Elements of the home look like West Elm or Apartment Therapy inspired design. Andrew was friendly and easy going. He ended up leaving for the weekend so we had the house to ourselves, a nice plus. We would stay there again. Some quirky history to his home involving Jimi Hendrix, be sure to ask him."
3258585,18066318,2014-08-21,17818720,Estär,"Andrew was a very kind host. The house is just awesome, great to have a relaxed stay in Seattle. 
When we would get up in the morning, Dakota, the dog, was giving a warm welcome (when Andrew was gone). We really enjoyed having her around us in the mornings and evenings. But Andrew made it clear we didn't need to take care of her, so it was nice to just hang with her without obligations.
Andrew seemes like a really relaxed guy, who is really sharing eveything (like food) as long as available. "
3258585,18271952,2014-08-24,1461386,Min,"Andrew was very accommodating, I was very appreciative of that. His place looks like something out of a West Elm catalog, rustic, modern and the works. Dakota (his dog) barks when she first meets you then retreats off, she's super kind and laid back. There's a very calming feel to his home and really enjoyed staying here. Briefly met Andrew in the morning when checking out, super cool guy! Definitely recommend staying here, close to downtown too!"
3258585,18353226,2014-08-25,9376490,Jackie,"Andrew was a great host! We stayed here one evening and had a lovely stay. He was very laid back and easy to talk to, and really flexible with your check in and check out time. His dog, Dakota, was super friendly and loves to be petted. 

Place was clean and the location was in a quiet neighborhood. It was nice to be out of the chaotic main areas of Downtown. The private bedroom was also a good size. Plenty of street parking available. We had a rental car which was convenient to travel around, but you could easily take public transportation. We would stay here again!"
3258585,18429221,2014-08-26,19130465,Lynda,"A wonderful relaxed stay with Andrew he opened his home to us just like a friend would. 
A clean cosy room with a comfy bed.
We had no problems getting to Andrew's place, easy to get downtown."
3258585,18797964,2014-09-01,910094,Jenny,This was the first time my fiancé and I stayed in a private room and we both felt it was a positive experience. Andrew was nice and accommodating. He even gave us a few suggestions of things to do during our stay. His dog Dakota was a sweetheart. 
3258585,18950148,2014-09-03,18795611,Guy,"Staying at Andrew's was awesome. He's a really great guy, very chill, and an excellent host! He made sure we had access to anything we needed, 

The house is fantastic, as well. Beautiful and cozy, plus it's close to several bus stations to you can visit different parts of the city if you don't have a car.
Overall, highly recommended if you're visiting Seattle!"
3258585,19160817,2014-09-07,7137856,Moises,Andrew was very accommodating and easy to work with. His dog makes for a great companion and source of entertainment. 
3258585,19236279,2014-09-08,20337369,Adriana,We enjoyed staying at Andrew's. Since we only stayed 1 night we had limited interaction with Andrew but he was very welcoming when we arrived. It was an easy commute on public transit from the airport. The room was a good size with a really comfy bed. 
3258585,19500274,2014-09-13,9073481,Chris,"Andrew was low-key and welcoming. His place was in a handy location for me since I had a bike with me. Downtown is about 10 minutes away. He has done some remodeling to the house in an aesthetic I really appreciated - simple, and just a little bit stark. I was pretty busy, so I didn't spend much time there, but it was a comfortable place to rest up."
3258585,19632267,2014-09-15,93617,Tim,Worked out fine.
3258585,19986388,2014-09-21,20395315,Kelley,"Andrew was a great host, even though we didn't see much of him at all. He gave us advice on the best way to get to downtown since we were unfamiliar with the city. He provided a clean, comfortable room and opened his whole home to us. We were very grateful for the ability to do laundry and also for the off street parking. I loved eating breakfast on the patio out back and enjoying pears off his pear tree in the backyard. The house is beautiful, charming, and an easy 40m walk into downtown Seattle on a bike trail and through Chinatown. Dakota was a wonderful host too and made us feel very welcome - we played fetch with her out back. I would absolutely stay here again and recommend Andrew's home to anyone looking for a great home base in a quieter neighborhood away from the bustle of the city."
3258585,20209356,2014-09-25,10610098,Fei,"Neighbourhood is nice and quiet, there is street parking. about 15 minutes drive to downtown Seattle. Andrew is very chill and welcoming, so is his dog. The room is clean and spacious, bed comfortable. I cannot fault this place even a little bit. "
3258585,20247420,2014-09-26,18811196,Diana,"Andrew's place is great.  Beautiful, clean and comfortable spot.  We were only there for one night, we exchanged a few words but he was lovely and so was his pup.  The neighborhood was safe and clean.  We would definitely stay there again."
3258585,20353041,2014-09-28,14482637,Rachelle,Very relaxed and easy to be at Andrews place! It is a beautiful place.
3258585,20928477,2014-10-07,10175135,Kaitlyn,"We loved our stay with Andrew.  We stayed in our camper in the driveway with full use of the kitchen and bathroom, and our friend stayed in his spare room.  Andrew was a great host and his house was really clean.  The location was great because we had bikes and could get downtown and to Capitol Hill easily.  We also walked one day which wasn't bad either as we like to walk.  The neighborhood was nice and fairly quiet.  We would definitely stay here again in Seattle!"
3258585,21279064,2014-10-14,16059252,Peter,"Andrew is friendly, helpful, and generous with his home and has even put out items (wine, liquor, cigars, a few beers, coffees) one might not expect to have free access to.  For ME many of these items went unused, so I don't know how readily he would replace them, if you happened to be drinking it up or smoking every night. He has some great fruits, etc... growing in the back yard, Bosc pears, figs, raspberries...
Dakota, his lovely black Lab is ever present and eager (though not desperate)  to share her affections.
The neighborhood seemed fairly quiet, peaceful, except for a jet overhead, now and then.
Though it was only in the mid-50s at night, I (a Florida native) found the room chillier than I like, for sleeping. I did not request any heat, because I actually found myself sweating under the covers provided...
If a private bath, on the same floor as your room is important to you, this is not the place for you... but if 420 issues are more important, Andrew IS 420 friendly. Now that recreational use in WA is legal, I found myself wondering why it hasn't been more advertised. (unless Airbnb policy prohibits it?)"
3258585,21732787,2014-10-22,19302881,Julia,"Andrew is a very cool guy, that house is great and very appropriate. The bedroom is perfect, Andrew is kind and warm person, he gave evidence to us at the station in the morning very early (still thank you). He has so cool dog. The more, it's the breakfast which is included."
3258585,21981459,2014-10-27,88350,Jason,"Andrew and his dog Dakota is one of our favorite host. His place is nice and clean, also its close to everything we wanted to do. If your ever in Seattle I highly recommend checking out his place."
3258585,22265735,2014-11-02,22307631,Andrew,Andrew's house was a great place to stay.  He was very accommodating and hospitable.   The place was spacious and very clean.  We definitley appreciated that.  His dog Dakota was also a pleasure to have around.   She is very friendly and fun to play fetch with.  I would definitely stay there again.  Thanks again Andrew!
3258585,41220277,2015-08-05,6290217,Julia,"We had a several day stay with Andrew. He was very welcome and responsive to the email and texts. He was able to accommodate our late/early arrival and departure. His house has a very pleasant feel to it. His dog is very funny too, she will demand petting."
3258585,41393488,2015-08-07,3310569,Chris,"Andrew's house is in an established neighborhood, with a nice backyard -- great to sit outside during the summer.  Dakota (his black lab) is happy to keep you company in the yard. Good value for the location."
3258585,41630525,2015-08-08,2956620,Simon,"Andrew is a very relaxed and friendly host, who provided clear instructions. The room is large, comfortable and quiet. I'd recommend staying here to anyone. Also, Dakota (dog) is awesome. A+"
3258585,42050927,2015-08-10,40069187,Lauren,"Andrew was extremely prompt in responding to questions and made my checking in very easy.  Dakota, his lovely Lab, was great company.  The backyard is a wonderful place to sip coffee in the morning, and my room was clean and comfortable.  I was a little envious of his compact, space-efficient house and how tidy it was!  I would definitely stay with Andrew again the next time I'm in Seattle if he were taking guests."
3258585,42237465,2015-08-11,12592961,Anne,"Andrew is a super cool guy and a great host! He even picked us up from the bus station. His house is nice and clean, Dakota the dog is super sweet, and the internet is good :) Would gladly recommend a stay at his place. "
3258585,42459429,2015-08-13,40154603,Jenna,"We stayed with Andrew while we were visiting Seattle for a Mariners game and it was the perfect stay. It was a 5 minute cab from the field and close to downtown shopping. His house was very clean and hospitable, and the bed was very very comfy! His dog Dakota was super sweet and was a struggle to not take her with us haha. Andrew was very welcoming and though we didn't see much of him due to opposite schedules, he made his home very available to us. "
3258585,42592550,2015-08-14,40023164,David,"We had a great stay here for our one-night stopover in Seattle. Andrew was very accommodating to our arrival and departure times, letting us check-in when convenient. Being greeted by his awesome dog, Dakota, was a nice bonus. 

While we were there, he was a perfect host - just really chill, felt like just staying at a buddy's house. The room was big and the bed was super comfy. Bathroom was newly renovated and the shower was great.

The neighborhood was cool, but maybe not for everyone. It's definitely on the gentrification upswing, and there isn't a ton around, but it's still pretty central (about a 10-15 minute bus ride to central downtown). I definitely dug all the uniquely-designed 60s and 70s houses in the area, and we found a great Mexican restaurant about a 15 min walk away. 

Overall, we had an enjoyable stay. Andrew was even nice enough to drive us the light rail station to head off the airport. Highly recommended!"
3258585,43069566,2015-08-17,9903516,Tamar,"Our stay was great! Andrew was really accommodating host, even to the point of helping us plan around our 1am arrival flight! The house is clean and tidy, the room is large and the bed is very comfortable. He's a really laid back guy (a virtue he probably picked up from the pup, Dakota) with a lot of helpful advice on travel and things to do around Seattle... We'd definitely stay with him again if we return to Seattle. "
3258585,43443405,2015-08-19,7727129,Cecilia,"Perfect place to stay! My friend and I were on our last night of a week-long Pacific Northwest trip, and sincerely wished we had stayed with Patrick for our previous Seattle nights. 

Patrick was great to communicate with, even as our arrival time changed due to the wait time at the board coming back from Vancouver.

The entire house is clean, wonderfully decorated, and exactly what is shown in the photos. Patrick was a fantastic host, offering us dinner when we got in, and we LOVED hanging out with his dog Dakota! I highly recommend staying here! 

Location is also great if you have a car and want to pop around the city. Bed is super comfortable too. Backyard space is gorgeous!"
3258585,43665942,2015-08-21,1097320,Steven,"Andrew was a great host.  He was home when we arrived so we chatted for about an hour.  Just a really chill, laid back guy.  His dog Dakota is awesome and just as laid back as he is.  The house is really nice, bed is really comfortable, location is close to downtown, and the showerhead is a-mazing.  A+."
3258585,44177887,2015-08-24,36401070,Chloe,"Andrew was great! He made us feel very welcome in his home. The bedroom is very cozy and a good size, and the bed is comfortable! The location was perfect- we didn't have any trouble getting to the places we wanted to explore. Definitely a great host and house! "
3258585,44471191,2015-08-26,39769279,Matt,"Andrew was a great host!  He and Dakota (his sweet black lab) tolerated our unusually late arrival on the first night checking in and provided us with a quiet, clean charming place to call home for our brief stay in the Beacon Hill neighborhood.  It was a great location for exploring the downtown Seattle area by bike with quick access to restaurants, parks, trails, and other attractions.  I would love to come back for a longer stay - and have time to explore more of the Beacon Hill community."
3258585,45383119,2015-09-02,37934316,Miguel,"Andrew was a great host. From the very beginning he replied really quickly all my questions and made the initial process easy. The house is close to downtown, the room was good and the bed was great and comfy. Definitely would recommend to anyone to stay with Andrew and Dakota, his dog."
3258585,45835428,2015-09-06,32976307,Mishari,It was a nice staying. Andrew has a dog and she's very quiet & friendly. The house was pretty cold though.
3258585,45981722,2015-09-07,14141860,Melissa,"Andrew's place was perfect for our needs.  The house is clean,  the bed is comfy and he didn't mind us bringing our dog."
3258585,46641466,2015-09-12,41772216,Jessica,"Andrew has a beautiful, cozy home. His dog Dakaota was a pleasure to have around. She's very sweet! The room has a comfy bed and the bathroom was clean. Andrew's home is close to Downtown Seattle, a quick bus ride or 15-20 minute walk. I would highly recommend this listing. "
3258585,47069339,2015-09-15,17918783,Daisy,Andrew was very cool. We loved his dog Dakota. Cozy room.
3258585,48005876,2015-09-22,42484282,Sarah," The listing for this particular house was on point. It's close enough to everything you need, without the hassle of being in a crowded, loud area. The neighborhood is beautiful, and great food is only a hop, skip and a jump away.
 The house itself is very clean and simple. There is a backyard complete with fruit trees as well as table and chair if you would like to have your morning coffee outside (which was provided by the host, and is delicious, by the way). The bed is insanely comfortable- I fell asleep the minute my head hit the pillow.
 Andrew is a very gracious and generous host. Everything I needed was provided as far as making myself at home. His dog, Dakota, is very friendly and loves to be petted, if you so desire. This was my first Airbnb stay in a city I had never been to before, and I can't stress enough how staying at Andrew's house really made me feel like a part of my surroundings.
 I highly recommend this particular location and host.  Thanks again, Andrew!"
3258585,48783285,2015-09-28,2675775,Leah,"The one-night stay at Andrew's was wonderful! It was in a great location - about an 8 minute walk from the bus into the city (only about a 15 minute ride) and a short distance from the Sound Light Rail to the airport. Although Andrew was out for much of the weekend, we did get to meet him and Dakota before our departure on Sunday and they were the kindest! He even gave us a ride to the Beacon Hill station to get to the airport. We definitely recommend staying here - perfect for a couple or a single traveler!"
3258585,50546190,2015-10-12,45412112,Katie,"Staying at Andrew's was wonderful. I never got the chance to meet him, but my Fiance tells me he's a really cool, laid back kind of guy. The room and bathroom were really clean, and the house was in a neat little neighborhood near a lot of different kinds of Asian food. He was super accommodating when it came to check in/out, and even let us borrow his umbrella. His dog Dakota was a sweetheart. It was a wonderful stay, and we'd love to visit again. :)"
3258585,51348098,2015-10-19,44422162,Audrey,"Staying with Andrew was a great choice! Easy access to public transit or a nice walk through the park. Dakota, his dog, was sooo sweet. Would definitely recommend Andrew's place to anyone looking to visit Seattle! He keeps it clean and is very friendly, on top of having a great literature and art collection. "
3258585,51773460,2015-10-24,16437678,Temo,"Great location by the international district and Beacon Hill. Great restaurants in the area. 

Andrew is very courteous and a down to earth guy. 

The room is nice, the bed and duvet super comfortable. The room is upstairs and the bathroom is downstairs. The bathroom is very nice and the shower is great. 

I hope to stay there again if I'm in the area."
5902452,30925213,2015-04-29,31248080,Osazonamen,The reservation was canceled 44 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
1940787,16984785,2014-08-05,16388888,Tracey And Will,Absolutely loved our stay. Bus line to seattle center right outside our door. Wonderful neighborhood coffee shop down the street. Marnie was always prompt and helpful. Bed was wonderful. Great experience for our first airbnb place. Highly recommend!
1940787,28544124,2015-03-25,19403522,Julian,"The Wallingford neighborhood is a nice section of older homes with plenty of good restaurants, eclectic movie theaters, and coffee shops nearby.  We used Marne's home as a home base for our trips to the Seattle Center and other attractions.  Very nice stay. "
1940787,28672462,2015-03-28,713116,June," Thank you, Marne. The place was located close to Fremont and close to where I needed to be. A few good restaurants, vintage shopping, and a vegan bakery in the area. Marne was very helpful and to place was cozy. "
1940787,32431799,2015-05-17,1462384,Sarah And Alexis,"Delightful host, lovely house, perfect experience. Marne was very warm and enthusiastic in our communication beforehand, including a personal note for our arrival and a thoughtful basket of food and other items. The house is in a terrific location, close to the Wallingford commercial district and several beautiful parks. We were traveling with our toddler, and the benefits of staying in a house where kids live were great, with toys, a changing table, and other basics right on hand. The house is quiet and light-filled, the bed comfy, the kitchen spacious. We'd love to stay here again. "
1940787,37736663,2015-07-10,426731,Jonathan,"We had a great time at Marne's home. We rented upstairs, which is the main part of the house, while Marne and her family were on vacation. 
The neighborhood is fantastic, a few blocks from many shops, restaurants, and parks, and with a view on the Seattle skyline at every cross street (the 4th of July was a great experience, with everyone going out and sitting in the streets to watch the fireworks!). As we were with three little ones, we did appreciate having a car to move around, especially as the area is much more hilly than one can tell on a map. There is a parking slot in front of the house (it was blocked for a couple days during our stay for construction in the street, but even then it was easy to find parking nearby).
Even though Marne was away in a different time zone, she still managed to answer all our questions very quickly and was very helpful. We certainly felt home, and so did our kids as they could play with her daughter's toys. Great experience overall!"
1940787,38257170,2015-07-14,16388888,Tracey And Will,"This is our second stay with Marne And her family and It's like staying with family. Super clean, and wonderful location. Walk a block for coffee or 5 blocks for the commercial neighborhood of Wallingford which boasts shops, restaurants and the most wonderful ice-cream shop.  The bus stop right outside will take you easily to any downtown location. Marne and her family are gracious hosts who make sure any need is taken care of. "
4677524,26257872,2015-02-08,1020646,Jessica,"This charming studio suite was the perfect size and space for our trip to Seattle. It is located in a great stretch of Belltown with easy walking access to all the common tourist sites. Marilyn has appointed the suite with great bedding and towels and a complete kitchen that comes in handy for cooking up those finds from the market. We didn't get around to using the pool or gym, but they looked awesome. I will definitely be back."
4677524,27184401,2015-02-27,1417099,Travis,"The location and building were quite lovely, as was the place itself. I loved that that kitchen had everything I'd need for preparing healthy food while travelling. Bed was super comfy too, and decor was beautiful. Communication was great."
4677524,28571723,2015-03-26,1417099,Travis,"Second time I've stayed at Marilyn's flat- Marilyn is friendly, communicative, and the flat itself is quite nice. Recommended :)"
4677524,28950018,2015-04-01,24329516,Amanda,"I absolutely loved my stay in this condo... to the point that I felt heavy and sad when I left. I came to Seattle for vacation and found an oasis of space and beauty in this studio. I loved the quiet this building offered and the view was incredible. Entry and departure were easy as could be and Marilyn offered much flexibility for my early arrival. I felt so at home in this space and spent almost as much time in it as I did wandering Seattle. I truly needed a space to escape work and the busyness of life and found this to be the perfect spot. I was able to make one meal during my stay and enjoyed how clean the entire space was. The location could not have been better - Pike Place Market is within walking distance, in addition to the Macrina Bakery and Belltown Pub, which I loved. Fantastic experience!"
4677524,29856115,2015-04-13,1571933,Christian,"Very nice apartment, very nice building, very well located (near space needle and pikes market), nice restaurants and bars very near. Would stay again for sure if I go back to Seattle."
4677524,30190452,2015-04-19,25339737,Lynne,She was really great. easy To communicate with and answered right away 
4677524,30730122,2015-04-26,5436444,Suzanne,Check in/out is easy and straightforward. The apartment is a very well-laid out studio that feels more like a one bedroom. Convenient location. 
4677524,31910993,2015-05-11,15020804,Cory,This listing is in the best location of Seattle.  Everything was seamless and arriving and leaving was a breeze.  Would definitely book again.
4677524,32184114,2015-05-15,31434638,Mono,"It was a nice time spending in this suite. The location is really good, convenient to walk to the Space Needle and even Pike Market."
4677524,33264918,2015-05-26,31279382,Peter,The place is really nice. Location is good with great view. Really good for traveler with no car.  
4677524,40085612,2015-07-28,12667669,Tim,"The suite was just as described, and the location was great!

Marilyn was quick to respond to our request and answer any questions.  The unit was in great shape, and had everything we needed for a great few days.  We would stay there again, next time in Seattle."
4677524,40398611,2015-07-30,1692482,Laura,"Very happy with the space. So close to everything we wanted to visit. All the best restaurants are literally within 2 blocks! It's a high end apartment with very cute decor.  Marilyn was very responsive in text msg. Never met her in person, but everything was taken care of before & during the visit. Would recommend this place to anyone who wants to visit Seattle."
4677524,43976307,2015-08-23,26956709,Virginia,"Marilyn's place was perfect for our weekend stay in Seattle. It was easy communicating with her, and she made sure we were able to get settled even after our delayed arrival from a long international flight.  It was late when we arrived, but we were well received. There were 3 of us staying here and her studio place was really clean and very comfortable. It provided us with everything we needed including parking. The location was near the reception of the wedding we were attending, but we noticed how close to so many bars and restaurants it was, so thats a plus as far as location. It was nice that we could see the space needle from where we were. I would recommend her place and we would definitely want to stay there again on our next visit."
4677524,46872507,2015-09-14,3923301,Angela,"We had a little trouble getting into the building, but Marilyn promptly responded and helped us get in. The studio was comfortable and clean when we arrived. Location was great - we spent a lot of time at Pike's Place and the pier. We only used the car when we traveled to the University District, Fremont, the  Space Needle, and the International District. There are lots of great restaurants within walking distance to the apartment. 

Some reviews mentioned that there is a lot of outside noise. Coming from NYC, we found that the noise was not at all bad, excepting the sirens that we heard on average twice in the early mornings. The noise that did bother me a bit, however, was from the person living upstairs who seemed to be stomping around everyday. 

The apartment was a nice respite after exploring Seattle. We took frequent mid-day breaks while staying there. Given the convenient location and comfort of the studio, I would stay here again. 
"
4677524,48684763,2015-09-28,35863012,Robert,"Location, Location, Location . . . Marilyn made us feel at home and the apartment was exactly matched the description.  Marilyn was very accommodating because we were traveling by train to Seattle and the train was late . . . and we communicated that to her and see made sure we were taken care of even though we arrived late in the evening.  The place was really clean, bed was very comfortable and again the location was THE BEST.  It is my hope that when we return to Seattle again this property will be available and Marilyn will allow us to stay here again.  We had a great time in Seattle!"
4677524,49337516,2015-10-03,41416355,Liz,"This place is much better than I imagined. It was located in a great part of the city where it was easy to walk to so many great places. Plus you can see the space needle from the window! Also, the bathroom, which is not in the pictures, was huge and nicely decorated. Marilyn answered my questions prior to our arrival and settling in and checking out were a breeze. I would highly recommend and stay there again."
4677524,50944977,2015-10-16,9998633,Oleg,"Great place to stay. Next to great restaurants and bars. Walk to Pike market or needle.
Would stay again."
4677524,52274684,2015-10-27,46505841,Pooja,Great location! Walkable to space needle and pikes place market. Parking very convenient. Apartment very well decorated with nice personal touches. Very clean. Comfortable for 3 guests. Overall great experience and would stay again. 
4677524,53742504,2015-11-12,4581211,Diane,"Absolutely loved staying at this studio in the heart of downtown...seriously, perfect location if you are new to Seattle! It ended up being close to some of our favorite restaurants and is a short walk to the market. Check in was a breeze. We loved using the kitchen to cook some meals and also utilized the washer/dryer in the unit.  The bed is more comfortable than my own + extra pillows was a nice option. Note that the person upstairs has a lead foot, but nothing major that kept us awake and very little street noise. We had a minor issue with a plumbing piece that came loose that was promptly fixed - be gentle with the toilet handle! We highly recommend this location to a couple or a few friends! "
4677524,53956746,2015-11-15,9649474,Kira,"This was a great ""home base"" for a first-time visit to Seattle. It was so conveniently located. We were able to take a short walk to all of the ""must see"" places for tourists (e.g., Space Needle, market), and on the way, spotted dozens of restaurants, pubs, and coffee shops that we knew we wouldn't get to on this trip but filed away for future reference. We did not cook but saw that the kitchen was well appointed if we'd wanted to have a cozy dinner in the studio.  The bakery on the 1st Ave side of the building is phenomenal. The only recommendation I'd make for future guests is to bring earplugs, as our slumber was disrupted each night by what sounded like stomping on the floor directly above the bed. "
8242212,48117495,2015-09-23,8154866,Laurie,"This quaint, vintage duplex w/vintage furniture,  is a perfect deal for an urban couple or good friends willing to share a bed.  All the essentials are included and felt safe driving as well as walking through the neighborhood; It is a gentrified neighborhood.  We walked downtown, which took about 30"".  
Tiffany was awesome and was prompt w/her replies and open and willing to help out w/anything needed.  we also had the pleasure of meeting her sweet, precocious daughter; what a treat!  We would recommend this for those looking for a safe place to lay your head after a day of exploring the city!
Thanks so much Tiffany for your hospitality.
Laurie and Art from Cali"
8242212,48446098,2015-09-26,7464388,Brad,Everything was perfect.
8242212,48925676,2015-09-29,14614457,Nora,"This is a super cute rental that had everything that we needed for our stay. It is in a great neighbourhood that is within walking distance of downtown and Capitol Hill. The bed was ridiculously comfy, and the placed filled with fun mid-century touches. Tiffany was awesome to deal with. Communication was great and she was flexible with my requests. I'd totally stay here again!"
8242212,49953174,2015-10-07,4715543,Lisa,"Tiffany was wonderful and the place was lovely, just as advertised. Very convenient and close to downtown. "
8242212,50775233,2015-10-14,5559586,Q.,"My friend and I loved our stay at Tiffany's place! The home was cozy and charming with a beautiful midcentury modern aesthetic. The location was perfect: on a quiet street, but only about a 15-minute walk into the heart of Capitol Hill and a plethora of restaurants, shops, etc. Tiffany was a great host; check-in and check-out were easy and she was kind enough to be flexible about our check-out time. Would definitely stay here again next time I'm in Seattle!"
8242212,51091268,2015-10-17,41994462,Carol,We met Tiffany the first day we checked in and we keep updating on the app. The apartment is absolutely the best choice for couple days traveling in Seattle. It is located in peaceful neighborhood but just five minutes drive to anywhere in downtown. Trader Joe's is like a mile away. We used the kitchen and it was awesome. Plenty of supplement and facilities were clean and new. The whole stay felt like at home. Tiffany was smart and communicative. Great experience and we will definitely choose Tiffany's lovely apartment again next time.
8242212,51502945,2015-10-20,619099,David,"Nice place, would stay again."
8242212,57872888,2015-12-30,19336375,Debbi,"Tiffany was marvelous, and I was so busy we never got to meet face to face! She kept us informed, responded to emails quickly and thought of all our needs! She left notes in the apt. and even a treat!"
353110,1080517,2012-04-03,2019171,Allison & Jerry,"Simply a lovely place to stay.  Quite, private, spacious room for both of us.  We were thrilled to have fresh coffee beans, grinder and a french press for that first morning cup.  Close (3 min drive) to Alki for that morning or evening walk/run along the beach.  Only a couple of blocks from 3 markets, movie theater, restaurants, etc. and 5 minutes from the West Seattle junction for all your funky, fun shops.  Looking forward to a return visit!"
353110,1604096,2012-07-01,2086430,Mark,"My girlfriend and I recently moved to Seattle without an apartment  to call our own, so we needed a place to stay while we looked around.  This was the first place we reserved to stay during our apartment hunt.

Eric was a fantastic host.  Immediately friendly and welcoming, offering not only friendly advice about the neighborhood, but also offering any help he could to help us find a place in West Seattle.  I was also fortunate to have met the rest of Eric's family who were very polite and friendly.

The cottage was perfect for the two of us (and our 2yr old cat).  It an absolutely stunning cottage.  Totally comfortable and clean with a private entrance and parking spot, and just an all around pleasure to stay in.  It was near a lot of great restaurants and a very short and scenic drive from Alki beach (5 minutes?).  Fortunately for us apartment hunters, it was only about a 15 - 20 minute drive downtown.

I'd wished we could have stayed far longer, but it was booked up.  I could not possibly recommend this place more, and should we need a place again in West Seattle, this will be our first choice."
353110,1904384,2012-08-06,2886945,Davida,"This is a great place in a great location. They've put a lot of attention into the aesthetics of the unit, as well as adding extras for convenience and comfort (loved the electric kettle. I'm thinking about getting one for myself after enjoying hot tea in moments whenever I wanted). The patio is great. They let us pick fresh raspberries from their garden while we were there. And we were excited to discover a Flicker's nest on top of their house (for those bird lovers out there). The bed is comfortable and the hosts are friendly (greeting us in person upon check in to answer any questions). This place is very light and airy with skylights and many windows. Very close to the touristy Alki Beach, but if you prefer nature more than pizza by the slice, then I recommend that you take the short walk from this place to Schmitz Preserve Park (which in my mind is even better than the more well known Discovery Park). Schmitz Preserve is a 53 acre chunk of old growth forest in the middle of an urban/suburban setting. It's full of hiking trails and streams with lots of little offshoot trails for exploring. Great place to get lost for several hours. I definitely recommend this place."
353110,2563507,2012-10-09,3619132,Trish,"My daughter and I stayed at Eric's place last weekend. It was everything we needed and nothing we didn't. Super comfy, easy to walk to so many restaurants and shops and very close to the beach. It was a great weekend."
353110,3353332,2013-01-15,2505474,Holly,"Eric was so welcoming and easygoing. I was in town for a working weekend retreat with a colleague who lives in the neighborhood. Eric set me up in the cottage, and left me to my own devices with the wifi and my full agenda. Loved being able to make coffee/tea and have snack on hand in the little kitchenette when I needed it. Many thanks! 
"
353110,6433836,2013-08-12,7629920,Blake,"Comfy little cottage, totally great for my wife and I. Everything was clean and tidy and the location was sweet."
353110,7102675,2013-09-06,7083148,Niklaus,We stayed 4 nights in the cottage. It was easy to find with the discription from Eric. The cottage is very comfy for two people. It's very easy to go downtown with the shuttlebus and the watertaxi. Alkibeach is also very close. Many thanks to Eric.
353110,15659995,2014-07-13,17736356,Kathleen,"Our stay at the cottage was great! We booked it pretty last minute, but Eric was very accommodating. The place was very spacious for the two of us and really enjoyed the free Netflix. Would definitely recommend!"

8194164,46107717,2015-09-07,42391966,Josh,"Tony was a great host and was extremely accommodating. The room and his home were exactly as pictured and It didn't take long to feel at home and comfortable there.

 The neighbourhood was extremely safe and quiet, with a short 10 min walk to shops, bars, food etc.. 
After a few weeks of non stop moving and hostels, Tony's was a great place of refuge, Comfy bed and sheets,minimalism and quiet, where I could recalibrate, relax on the lawn, juggle, chat to the neighbours and soak in the sun for a couple of days!"
8194164,51634309,2015-10-22,4149745,David,"Awesome host!!! Excellent home!! Highly recommend! Thank you Tony. 
David Rocky Point NC"
2211594,10897037,2014-03-11,11024136,Chyna,My husband and I had a wonderful time on our stay.  David was very helpful and kind.  The room was clean and his home was beautiful.  It's located in a great neighborhood and just a few steps from all of the essentials.  Would highly recommend and intend to stay again!
2211594,11029741,2014-03-17,12338449,Andrea,"I absolutely enjoyed my stay at David's place! Everything is top of the line. I especially love the towels and the bed. They are really comfortable. The whole place is very modern and decorated tastefully. It's also very clean, which is very important to me. David is very responsive and made the booking and check in process easy. I'd def recommend this place to anyone visiting Seattle."
2211594,11152095,2014-03-23,12100491,Kevin,My girlfriend and I stayed here for spring break and had an excellent time. David was a great host and the location is perfect for anyone looking to visit. I would definitely stay here again and recommend it to friends & family.
2211594,11287523,2014-03-28,13048155,Nora,"David's place is wonderfully accessible to a lot of Seattle, very near to main thoroughfares while still being in a quiet, comfortable residential neighborhood. The room was comfortable, and the use of the excellent kitchen was convenient. David himself was friendly, helpful and a pleasure to deal with. Excellent place to stay to see the city!"
2211594,11419875,2014-04-01,13319990,Colleen,"This was a great place to stay with easy access to everything.  David was extremely informative and easygoing.  Plopping down on the clean, comfy bed after a long day's travel was something I'll never forget :) Thanks again for the great hospitality."
2211594,11565310,2014-04-07,7967455,Zareen,"Davids place was gorgeous! Beautifully decorated and clean, in a prime location in Capitol Hill. He was very friendly, and put post its around the apt so that we would know where things were. Had a perfect weekend in Seattle thanks to him, thanks David!"
2211594,11820005,2014-04-15,14040433,Ian,"Staying with David was my first time using airbnb and the experience was beyond expectations in all regards. The apartment is conveniently located for downtown Seattle, yet quiet at night (great supermarkets and coffee house within one block; many dining options withing a handful of blocks). The place is impeccably clean. David was a very accommodating host who was available to assist at all times and yet was never intrusive. I very much recommend this as an option for anybody visiting Seattle"
2211594,12003634,2014-04-21,6171654,Sebastien,"We stayed here for two nights, mid april.

   David's house is a very nice place, as others have mentioned. It's super clean, well decorated (very modern).
   The room itself is big, with a huge walk-in closet (great if you had packed a ton of clothes :) Nice clean bed. Lots of light. (note: the blinds are a little tricky, just fyi)
   The neighborhood is very quiet, and well located to go both to downtown, but also to other areas (for shopping, parks, etc.)
    Due to coincidence, we bumped into David's partner more often, who was very friendly. As David states on his page, they both seem to have a busy schedule, and are out most of the time.
   Parking wasn't bad. You eventually find a place within a couple of blocks.

On our first night, we noticed sound traveled relatively well in the house. It's just an FYI, if you arrived very late, or needed to wake up very early, to be careful with the noise.  The mattress is also a little softer than what we're use to. It didn't bother me, but my girlfriend has a bad back and had a more difficult time with sleep. 

Overall this is  a good bet. 

tip: it's written on David's page, but in case you skipped it, don't forget your soap and shampoo."
2211594,12284090,2014-04-28,12300619,Tucker,"If you are coming to Seattle this is a great place to stay.  It was clean, well appointed and the location was perfect. The Capitol Hill neighborhood is just a few blocks away.  Lots of restaurants and services close by.  Be sure to stop in at Tougo Coffee.  It's in the next block.  Good coffee and donuts.

David was a great host.  We had a little trouble getting in and he was on it!  Very responsive!  We also appreciated how polished David's instructions for the house were.  Right before your arrival date he will send you everything you need to know in a well written document that is available online.  We didn't get a chance to interact much with David ( the first day in Seattle we walked over 17 miles exploring the city) but I did run into him the night before we left.  He and his girlfriend were both very nice and interesting, wish we could have chatted more.  Overall we had a great stay.  As a heads up to some...this was cool with us because we were on an exploration of the city and didn't spend much time in the room; there is not a TV in the room.  For some this may be an issue but for us we used the wifi and watched Portlandia on our Kindle. With that said our hotel in Portland for the second half of our trip didn't have a TV either and was twice the cost!

Thanks for a great stay David!"
2211594,12857640,2014-05-12,14866578,Isher,"The listing was mainly what we expected. The home and guest room was pleasant, clean, and large enough for two people. The bed is very soft which was slightly uncomfortable, a good stretch in the morning alleviates any uncomfortable. I found the host to be well organized and welcoming. The location was exactly what we were looking for, great area, lots to do, and very walkable. "
2211594,13014497,2014-05-17,11513945,Anna,"Sorry for the late review.... David's place is fantastic and I LOVE IT!! The room is really cozy and the apartment is pretty cool. The whole place is really tidy and the location is relatively convenient. Before we arrived, David sent us a detailed and organised guide, which helps a lot. I will recommend David's place to everyone and I will definitely choose here again when I visit Seattle next time.  "
2211594,13355446,2014-05-26,8661757,Sean,"David's place is a great place to stay while in Seattle.  As for location, it has transit access to most of the city, is right by two grocery stores, and is in a great neighborhood with tons of restaurants/bars/coffee.

As for the place itself, it's spacious and comfortable, and provides for a quiet night's sleep despite being in a busy neighborhood.  There is also a private bathroom, just outside the bedroom.  While we didn't see David much during our stay, he was accommodating and helpful throughout our communications.      

David's place is definitely worth a look! "
2211594,13510307,2014-05-29,13486088,Kate,"We had a great stay at David's. We were coming from 5 days of camping so a real bed and a real shower were fantastic. We really, really loved the neighborhood - Capitol Hill was such a cool area and we took David up on some of his restaurant recs and they did not disappoint (Barrio and La Spiga - both amazing!) Overall a great, short stay."
2211594,13588558,2014-05-31,126654,Ryan,Great spot! Really well-located and spotlessly clean. The bed was insanely soft which may be an issue for some people but we had no issues! 
2211594,13797696,2014-06-04,9005471,Staffan,David was the perfect host. Very helpful and responsive both when we communicated before my visit and during my stay in his apartment. The room and apartment was awesome and the location perfect for me. I will definitely look up this listing if I go back. Highly recommended to anyone visiting Seattle!
2211594,14225439,2014-06-15,12487005,Leslie,"The place was very nice and clean, as it appears. David was a great host, he was well prepared and had given all the information we needed to know before our arrival at his place and even had post its around the house to label where things were for us. His place is nicely located in a quiet neighbourhood, but still close to the down town area. Overall, it was a great place to stay. My one caution though is that the bed is pretty lumpy and some might find it difficult to sleep on. "
2211594,14437949,2014-06-19,7203222,Ben,"David's place is awesome. Very modern 2br townhome with everything you need and walking distance to anywhere. David was great and we crossed paths a few times. He made sure we had our own space and made some solid recommendations. Recommend for an easy, convenient place to relax in Seatte's Capital Hill."
2211594,14614056,2014-06-23,5725903,Nas & Josh,"Very nice apartment in a great location. Lots of buses very close by and places to eat and get a morning coffee. You also get your own full bathroom which is great. I would recommend for your trip to Seattle. 
"
2211594,15051672,2014-07-01,3637149,Emilie,"The house is very well located, we just loved the neibourhood, which is close to everything (restaurants, boutiques, cafes, supermarket, co-op). It's also super easy to walk dowtown.

The room was clean, the bed was very confortable. We had our own bathroom, which is nice and easy to manage.

We had a wonderful time in Seattle, a great city to discover by walk!"
2211594,15202427,2014-07-04,17272235,Tina,David's place was awesome. David is friendly and had a whole list of helpful suggestions for getting around town which was quite easy since his place is very centrally located. The bedroom and bathroom were very clean and the mattress was super comfortable. I would definitely stay there again.
2211594,15450451,2014-07-09,2064098,Jenny,"David has a very nice place, its a very modern spacious condo in a great neighborhood. The available room has a very comfortable bed, and my friend and I had our own bathroom. David also left a section of his fridge for us to use for our groceries which was nice. Capitol Hill is a fantastic place to get the true neighborhood feel of Seattle, there were so many great restaurants and bars within walking distance of the apartment, and there's a Trader Joe's right around the corner. Overall the accommodations were perfect for what we were looking for and at a great price!

One thing to note is that David and his live-in girlfriend, while very nice, were not really interested in talking to us and didn't want to engage in small talk. My friend and I felt a little uncomfortable that we were walking on eggshells in their home. Nonetheless I would still highly recommend their place, as it was very clean and in a great location."
2211594,15591431,2014-07-12,16922974,Kathy,We enjoyed our stay in Capitol Hill. The area was easy to get around and was around several different restaurants and bars. We rented a car and were able to find parking quickly. The room looks just like the pictures show on the website and David left us very detailed instructions the day of arrival. I would recommend people coming to visit Seattle this airbnb. 
2211594,16307141,2014-07-25,17197455,Leo & Vero,"David has a nice place and in a quiet neighborhood, close to public transport and groceries stores. Spacious and clean room and bathroom, although the mattress is on the softer side. Great host and they make sure we have our  space and privacy. Great and pleasant experience for first time airbnb member... Would definitely come back and recommend them!"
2211594,16484944,2014-07-28,17273886,Sarah,"David's home is extremely clean and comfortable ! He left sticky notes on sections of the kitchen that were for our use. David's home is located in a beautiful part of town. It's within walking distance to coffee shops, grocery stores, and public transport. If you're using a car, parking on the street is easy to find. David went beyond our expectations, and for our first airbnb trip he has set the bar pretty high. Thx David ! :)"
2211594,16890750,2014-08-04,5638675,Mary,"This 1BR with private bath met my needs for a one week stay in Capitol Hill. It was very convenient to store/heat up food, use the washer and dryer for laundry, and use dishes. The location was very walkable to bus stations, grocery stores, restaurants, etc. David was very accommodating of my checkin and checkout times, and I liked using the lock system instead of a key. The whole place is very modern, neat, and clean. There was a mobile ac/fan unit in the room, but I didn't bother setting up the ac vent, and just the fan was fine for Seattle in July. There was lots of closet space! Perhaps only room for improvement was that the mattress was too soft for me, and seemed like memory foam?"
2211594,17129908,2014-08-07,3289587,Joe & Kim,Staying with David and Amelia was a wonderful experience.  Everything was as described.  The place is clean and in a great location.  David and Amelia were excellent hosts.  I highly recommend staying with David and Amelia when in Seattle.
2211594,17587601,2014-08-14,19009933,Iris,"The host provided us with good  directions / notes from previous experience so it made our visit easy to navigate. The area has plenty of great eats & things to do. Check out the Speakeasy called  ""Needle and Thread"" for one -- its a hidden bar with professional mixologists. If you want the taste of the outdoors & city, I'd also recommend this location since it's more-or-less an hour from the Great Four Ice Caves and Twin Falls, while walkable distance from the city center and close to the pike place/space needle --the  tourist area of Seattle.  Enjoy your stay in Capitol Hill! "
2211594,17779741,2014-08-17,18876375,Karel,"We enjoyed our Seattle visit.  Thanks for your hospitality.
Karel & Bob"
2211594,18253151,2014-08-24,16835677,Pui,"The place is really nice. It locates in an area where you have many decent dining places and you don't need to worry about how to get somewhere if you don't have a car. Besides the location, David has stick notes in the house to help you get around the house, and he provides a lot tips for travel.
P.S. the cat is really cute. "
2211594,18492640,2014-08-27,159690,Nadim,"The location of this apartment is really great. Capitol Hill has good restaurants, bars and shops. The room looks exactly like the pictures on the listing. You also have a private bathroom. David was kind enough to send us a detailed document of everything we needed to know for our stay. We didn't interact with him or Amelia too much but we had all the privacy we needed. Enjoy Seattle and Capitol Hill!"
2211594,18880522,2014-09-02,2612088,Sally,"The hosts were very nice, helpful and laid back."
2211594,19288003,2014-09-09,20209134,Michael,This was my first AIRBNB experience and David and Amelia made it very easy and enjoyable.  They are great hosts and easy to communicate with.  I would recommend them to anyone seeking a place to stay in this great Seattle neighborhood.
2211594,19561527,2014-09-14,20298235,Nila,"This place is really great, specially the location, basically you can just walk to downtown. The price is great. You don't really need a car if you just stay and want to hang out in downtown. "
2211594,19891522,2014-09-20,2162571,Kenric,"David and Amelia are such nice people. Their flat was impeccable and the room very comfortable (and although as others have mentioned, yes, the bed is soft. But it was not a big deal for me). The bathroom was very modern.

I had been to Seattle before, but they were quick with suggestions on what to do after a plan fell through last minute. The overall neighborhood is extremely walkable (near gyms, cafes, grocery stores, and many restaurants / bars) which made it easy to be spontaneous. And on top of it all they also have a very friendly cat. 

It felt like home in the Northwest with wonderful hosts, so I would definitely recommend them."
2211594,22086428,2014-10-29,4775029,Matt,"David and Emelia were great hosts.  Everything was very clear, and they gave us space to do our own thing.  The room and home are as you see in the photos.  Everything was very clean and orderly.  The location is great for getting around Seattle.  Bus stops nearby and a Trader Joes 2 blocks away.  Overall a pleasant stay and would do it again.  "
2211594,23125576,2014-11-23,23672482,Coilin,"David and Amelia have a very nice place in Capitol Hill. You have your own room and bathroom and they try to make your stay as pleasant as possible.  The document that David creates before you check-in is very helpful and  makes things really easy. Their house is in a great location where you have access to a number of bars and restaurants. This was my first Air BnB experience and so I didn't really know what to expect from my hosts. David and Amelia will answer questions when you have them but they will not actively engage you in conversation. At times it felt weird. However, I had a good experience."
2211594,24571911,2014-12-30,10880969,Tiantian,The place is close to most of the places that a tourist can think of. It also has a bunch of bars/brunch places around. The neighborhood is quite and safe. David and Amelia def have a good taste on interior (email hidden)d the CAT.
2211594,27695078,2015-03-09,12147563,Nicole,"Wonderful space and great people, even offered to share their pizza with us! Very clean, much like the photos. The document for check in makes it very easy. Probably my best air bnb experience!"
2211594,28814534,2015-03-30,6117905,Ali,"David and Amelia are ideal hosts - they were kind and approachable. The room was exactly as shown in the photos and the house is in a very convenient location, about 15 mins by bus to downtown Seattle. All in all, I highly recommend staying in David and Amanda's house."
2211594,30426990,2015-04-21,165574,Jonathan,"We had a most enjoyable and comfortable stay at David and Amelia’s home. The house is located in a trendy neighborhood, close to many bus lines.  It takes about 20 minutes to get to downtown.  At night the neighborhood is quiet and peaceful.  The room is a nice size with a  comfortable bed and block out shades.  The kitchen is fully equipped and convenient for breakfast making or any other meal.  The hosts were super nice and welcoming.  Seattle is a great city and if you stay at David’s home you may never want to leave! "
2211594,30901807,2015-04-28,31025271,Folco,"Très bon logement, tout à fait conforme à la description.
La chambre est spacieuse et comprend une grande penderie, la salle de bain est parfaite et la cuisine équipée de tout ce dont vous pourriez avoir besoin.
David et Amelia nous ont bien accueilli et étaient toujours disponibles pour toutes demandes.
Le quartier est à la fois très calme et très bien situé, transports à proximité tout comme un grand nombre de restaurants et bars où on peut aller à pied.
Très gros avantage, David et Amelia nous ont fourni un guide, qu'ils ont eux même crée, rassemblant quasiment toutes les informations utiles sur le quartier (notamment comment se rendre chez eux depuis l'aéroport) avec une bonne sélection de lieux pour manger ou boire un verre.
Nous recommandons!

2211594,31981214,2015-05-12,31695371,Remi,"David & Amelia's home was adorable and they made me feel right at home!  I stayed with them for 3 nights and thoroughly enjoyed my stay.  They were very hospitable, the bedroom was great (with a huge closet as well as a dresser), and the private bathroom was fantastic as well.  Everything was amazingly clean.  Plus their cat Zeida is very friendly and so much fun to be around!  This was my first airbnb experience and I loved it  :D"
2211594,33604392,2015-05-30,30029762,Cam,"David and Amelia are super lovely and fun. The bedroom and private bathroom are great. The house is perfectly located in a fun and lively neighbourhood, within walking distance from delicious cupcakes and pretzels. Plus, they have the most adorable cat in the world, Zeida. Frankly, what more can you want?!

I loved my stay in Seattle with David and Amelia and so will you! :)  "
2211594,34549130,2015-06-09,7401262,Cristian,david and amelia were inedible hosts...we felt very welcome at their home..the house was great and the neighborhood was the best..everything at walking distance..we loved it and we are very thankful for all their help ..all the best for both of them..thank u both!!!
2211594,34972012,2015-06-14,31161308,Sherry,"David and Amelia gave us an awesome stay for our first trip to Seattle. It's a very nice and cozy house, centrally located that gives easy access in and around the city. Parking isn't super easy at this part of town but we always managed to find a spot after some search. They also have a super cute and curious cat!"
2211594,35421490,2015-06-18,35344570,Melanie,"David and Amelia were fantastic hosts! Their home is exactly as described: modern, neat and clean, and located on a quiet street in Capitol Hill close to many amazing restaurants and bars. We felt very safe and welcome. Thank you for helping to make our first impression of Seattle a great one!"
2211594,35694277,2015-06-21,33968111,Marit,"Amelia and David are both very friendly and easy-going people, and made us really feel welcome and “at home”. Zeida the cat accepted us as well. 

The check-in was stress free, except that the room wasn’t ready when we arrived. There was no problem dropping off our bags tho. The code lock to the front door made it easy to come and go. 

Our room was light and spacious and the bathroom was nice (but could have been better cleaned). We got nice and fresh towels and bed sheets. The kitchen was well equipped, but it was a little inconvenient that we couldn’t use the dishwasher. The apartment is located some km from down town Seattle, but it was easy to take the bus (just a short walk from the apartment to the bus stop). The neighborhood was quiet and felt safe.

All in all, we had a nice stay at their place! Very much recommended.  "
2211594,36039808,2015-06-24,34862468,朝峰,"David and Amelia are very nice. We often came back late at night, maybe they have been sleeping,I think we have interrupt their everyday (website hidden) is our apology to you.But they did not complain.Also,their house is very beautiful and neat.And there are the gas station and supermarket nearby their house, so it is very convenient."
2211594,37167293,2015-07-05,32527879,Marice,"David and Amelia were wonderful hosts. They are both easy to talk to and willing to share recommendations. Their home is clean, comfortable, and conveniently located. An easy walk to Pike Place Market and many downtown attractions, as well as yummy neighborhood restaurants and bars.  

The week we were in Seattle was unusually hot for Seattle standards (80s and 90s). Since high temperatures are rare we learned most homes as well as restaurants and shops don't have A/C. David and Amelia ordered and installed an A/C in our room during our visit.  We really appreciated the extra effort they took to make this upgrade and the room even more comfortable. 

Thank you for sharing your home with us and for making our first visit to Seattle a great experience! "
2211594,38887901,2015-07-19,15521709,Leonard,"We had a lovely stay in Seattle. The room was exactly as described. David and Amelia were fine hosts, though our paths rarely intersected. Zeida the cat even let us hold and pet her. The walk to down town Seattle is a hilly 30 minutes +, but the the bus stop is only a block away."
2211594,39553649,2015-07-24,13932851,Amy,This is a lovely townhome in the fantastic neighborhood of Capitol Hill in Seattle.  David was very welcoming in messages prior to my stay.  I was not at the house that much -- except in the evening -- but when I did see David he was very nice.  The room was as advertised and I enjoyed it: the bed was really comfortable and the bathroom was super clean.  Access to the house was easy via a code e-mailed to me in advance of the stay.
2211594,40203325,2015-07-29,31086930,David,"We very much enjoyed our stay!  The location was terrific with easy access to bus lines and 2 grocery stores within 2 blocks.  The townhouse was comfortable in a nice, quiet neighborhood. Everything was neat and clean. WiFi functioned nicely after we called to get the password. Security was good. We wished there had been a coffeemaker, but otherwise the kitchen was wonderful and well-equipped.  We would definitely stay here again and would recommend it unless a car is needed, since parking appeared scarce."
2211594,42420393,2015-08-13,15187648,Christian,"David and Amelia's place was exactly as described, and a perfect place to stay for anyone visiting Seattle. The house is located in a great spot in Capitol Hill, walking distance from downtown and close to many great restaurants. We enjoyed our stay very much. Highly recommended!"
2211594,45012803,2015-08-30,35324206,Gracie,"Daniel and Amelia were great throughout the stay this past weekend. I booked for my little brothers to visit Seattle for PAX. It was a party of four and the home is spacious enough to accommodate all of them. Distance wise, though PAX was in downtown Seattle, they walk to the convention center from capitol hill and LOVED it. There were a couple of little fixes here and there, but the stay was overall a very pleasant experience. They want to thank you for hosting, David and Amelia!"
2211594,45271972,2015-09-01,37918760,Caitlin,"The home has great space and is definitely in a convenient area that is walkable to most parts of the city!  We enjoyed our time staying in the home, even though we were mainly there just to sleep. David was very accommodating with our request to drop off our bags earlier then the check in time, and was always very quick to respond to any questions we had. 

Do know there are security cameras in the home, one facing the front outdoor entrance, and one in the family room (we did not believe the family room one was on though). We did not know there would be security cameras, which I normally would not have a problem with because I'm all about safety, but there was a confusion on how many people we had staying with us when the renters before us were leaving while we were dropping off our bags. I completely respect their wanting to make sure excess people are not staying in there home, but it made us feel like we were being watched and a little uncomfortable after being questioned from what they saw on camera. I would just possibly let people be aware of the cameras so there's no discomfort. Overall, it was still an accommodating and good experience with the owners, and a nice and clean home to stay at! "
2211594,45527932,2015-09-03,17966129,Adam,Fantastic unit! Location was great but don't count on parking right in front of your unit. It's about a block away from a Trader Joe's and a cheap Uber ride from anywhere in the city. I will definitely be staying here again!
2211594,45795937,2015-09-06,1581364,Daniel,"Great location. Walked to lots of places around Capitol Hill and down to Pike's Place, etc. David and Amelia let us drop off our luggage before the standard check-in so we didn't have to lug it around Seattle. 

Very clean and plenty of space for 2 couples to split. Only ""issues"" were minor (spotty wi-fi, no champagne glasses). No keys - the door has a code - made arrival/check-out even easier. "
2211594,46336326,2015-09-09,3778460,Julia,"David and Amelia's townhouse is wonderful and just as described. The place was quiet, the beds were comfortable, the location fantastic. 

David provided lots of helpful information including restaurant and 'getting around' information and he was quick to answer questions that weren't already covered. 

All in all, it was terrific and I hope its available the next time we're in Seattle. "
2211594,47231178,2015-09-16,18119422,Peter,"David was a great host during my stay, he was very helpful when it came to response time. His home is very beautiful and welcoming I think I would stay here anytime I visit Seattle
"
2211594,47573076,2015-09-20,2549050,Aram (Amee),Owners were responsive. House was beautiful and as described. Area was very convenient.
2211594,48769315,2015-09-28,6394663,Nina,We had a great time staying at David and Amelia's townhouse. It was spacious and comfortable and in a convenient location in the city. The logistics of finding and accessing the house was very straightforward. Thanks for having everything worked out so smoothly for our visit!
2211594,49715174,2015-10-05,44472670,Jimmy,"Great experience. Everything was as exactly described, and perfect for a nice getaway. Only complaint we had, which our host has no control over and is in no way their own fault, is parking is a little tricky as it can take a little while to find street parking. But again, this is not the host's fault at all and even warned about in the description. Next time I need another getaway, will definitely plan on renting again! "
2211594,51338450,2015-10-19,2000648,Sarah,We loved staying in Capitol Hill. David and Amelia's townhouse was a perfect homebase for us. Having a playground and Tuogo coffee (very kid friendly) nearby was a plus. In close proximity to a lot of bus lines. David and Amelia were very attentive and answered texts promptly.
2211594,51865693,2015-10-24,9166035,Dave,"Great neighboorhood, bars/restaurants a short walk away. Easy check in, cool space."
2211594,55581708,2015-12-02,46585425,Glenn,"It was a very nice looking townhouse in a very convenient neighborhood. But I did not like the hosts' responses to questions. I am vegan and could not figure out how to start the stove. David said it should be obvious. What was obvious was that he had never used it. I found the oven on line and you had to open the stove part way, turn the knob to the highest setting and then push it in and hold for 10 seconds. Not obvious. Also the water was barely luke warm and lasted only long enough for one person to shower. Also we were there for over a week and could not use the laundry in the house because someone before had spilled bleach. Why not say don't use bleach. I have told them these things and I hope that it will be better for future guests. "
2211594,56438029,2015-12-13,30875098,Yuriy,"Excellent house, loved the fireplace, great location thank you"
2211594,56758814,2015-12-17,50126645,Shari,We had a wonderful stay the trip was great.  The house was clean. Dave and Amelia were very friendly and very helpful I would love to stay at this place again when visiting Seattle.

Nice kitchen too."
2211594,58379973,2016-01-02,36086525,Ruby,"Our stay here was fantastic. Everything in the place was just as described and it was really nice to feel like we were in a home, but not encrouching on anyone's space. We were able to walk to great places nearby, take busses to other neighborhoods, and find parking for the car without a problem. We took advantage of Trader Joe's and the full kitchen to make many home cooked meals. Thank you for providing such a wonderful place and for checking in to make sure everything was going smoothly. Oh, and the key pad was really convenient. No worries about who had the keys. Thank you very much for a wonderful stay!
"
4170863,20478146,2014-09-29,6876797,Jeff,"The place was beautiful, very well put together. The bathroom (the shower mostly was awesome, after being stuck on a train for two days. Faith was very accommodating, she allowed us to park our bicycles in the garage. She was there to welcome us, and answer any questions. She responded in a very swift manner with any inquiry we had.  "
4170863,21356660,2014-10-15,18833513,Ashley,"Faith was a great host!! Her place is absolutely beautiful and very close to many attractions. I felt very safe and the neighborhood is quiet at night. She left some goodies stocked in the fridge and made sure I had everything i needed for a comfortable stay. She was quick to reply with suggestions for anything I asked. Very comfortable bed and the shower is amazing! I always felt great coming ""home""."
4170863,21897905,2014-10-26,22063221,Alicia,"This was my first AirBnb rental, and it was a fantastic first impression! The apartment was well decorated, clean, and quiet. The shower was amazing and the bed was so cozy. While we did not have an opportunity to meet in person, Faith was extremely accommodating and responsive to messages. She left maps and suggestions and even a few snacks in the fridge! I would highly recommend this spot to anyone looking to stay in the Seattle area."
4170863,22009731,2014-10-27,14815027,Serena,"Faith's mother in law was clean,  private, and in a lovely residential neighborhood of Seattle. Noise from upstairs was audible but minimal, if you are a light sleeper ear plugs might prevent any accidental waking. Bed was comfortable. Faith was easy to communicate with when needed,  but otherwise respected our privacy."
4170863,22274880,2014-11-02,7650677,Justin,"Great place, great host, and they're not kidding about the shower."
8668410,56677578,2015-12-16,23762390,Steven,Jordan was definitely a great host. Although we had some complications due to house upkeeping and he was able to provide us a new location which was just as lovely. Getting into the location was just as simple as booking the vacation home and I will definitely recommend anyone to book any of Jordan's location!
8668410,57349170,2015-12-24,51765665,Yifan,"Thank you for your great apartment these days. We left the room keys, the garage remote and the parking permit at the lobby front desk."
7598743,42465345,2015-08-13,21465671,Nam,"Super responsive to my inquiries.  The quite neighborhood.
It comes with an indoor parking space, which was nice. "
7598743,45749821,2015-09-05,4277695,Steve,"Cindy's place was a perfect home base for Seattle and just what we were looking for. Check-in process was smooth even though we got in fairly late at night from Canada, and having the dedicated parking spot made things much easier. The apartment is really lovely, super clean, and in a great area. We had some delicious Caribbean food just down the street and it was an easy uber to pike place. Cindy was extremely responsive and a great host, I would definitely be keen to stay here again!"
7598743,46095656,2015-09-07,42435186,Derek,"Though I never met Cindy, she seemed very nice and texted a couple times to check in and make sure everything was OK. She was even kind enough to leave towels and tooth brushes for us! The place was clean and very nice with fast internet. Great location for walking to all the popular city spots and the reserved parking spot was a very nice thing to have.  "
7598743,46685802,2015-09-12,296754,Kory,Cindy's place was exactly as described and the neighborhood is right where you want to be to explore the city. She provided very clear instructions and was available for help/advice as needed. Highly recommend this place for anyone looking to explore Seattle!
7598743,47334205,2015-09-17,31247459,Christian,Loved this place! Apartment was perfect and looked exactly like the photos. The location is great! Cindy is quick to communicate and goes above and beyond. My wife and I accidentally left some items behind and she mailed them to us - we are so thankful!
7598743,47595430,2015-09-20,3429992,Abram,Host responded well to a last-minute request.  Never saw her but she was very responsive online and accommodating.  We got to Seattle early and she let us go in before the official check in time.  House is in a good location and seemed safe and the house was nice.
7598743,47849374,2015-09-21,144162,Tang,"Nice place, close to dt seattle. Would stay again."
7598743,47875841,2015-09-21,395877,Adit,"Cindy's place was perfect for my trip. She had everything organized and a very clear key pick-up and drop-off plan. The place is very conveniently located to shops, restaurants, and a nice part of town. 

I highly recommend this place and would definitely stay here again. "
7598743,48153717,2015-09-23,6204497,Nathan,Great location & Cindy was very communicative if we had any questions. Access was easy also! 
7598743,48257651,2015-09-24,4804623,Cindy,"Cindy was super responsive and helpful and a wonderful host! The apartment was perfect - awesome location, and very clean and well appointed. Loved the ease of check in and check out. Highly recommend and hope to stay there again!"
7598743,48456424,2015-09-26,16110187,Valeria,"Had a great experience staying at the apartment! Very convenient to check-in and check-out, very clean and stylish inside and just minutes to downtown! Definitely a great place to stay in Seattle!"
7598743,52756409,2015-11-01,1477886,Mary,"Cindy was pleasant and easy to get in touch with, her instructions on how to check in were simple and the whole process from booking, to checking in, to checking out was very easy.  The apartment is just how it looks in the photos and the location is very convenient. There are lots of bars and restaurants in Capitol Hill that are within a 5-15 minute walk, we were also able to walk to the downtown attractions like Pike Place Market, Belltown, & Pioneer Square.  Alternately there is a bus that goes downtown and its literally around the corner.   This apartment was great alternative to a hotel - we had driven across the country (from NY), so after a week and a half of hotels and motels, it was nice to stretch out in an apartment in a quiet and safe neighborhood.  Additionally, having a parking spot was worth its weight in gold, we parked the car and didn't take it out until we checked out.  If you are renting the apt with the intention to cook meals in the kitchen, check with Cindy first.  We didn't see any pots or pans to cook with, but maybe we didn't look hard enough.  It was a non-issue for us as we did not rent the apartment with the intention to cook (as there are seriously so many great dining options to choose from in Seattle and the local area.) But if that is an important feature for you, check with her first.   As stated before Cindy was on top of every email/text quickly... once I got to the airport I realized I had accidentally taken an umbrella from the apartment.  I emailed Cindy and asked if I should mail it or send money, and she was agreeable to either option, which is great, because it was way easier to send money, than an umbrella!!  "
7598743,53540716,2015-11-09,10549940,Hayley,"Amazing location, Cindy was incredibly organized and accommodating throughout entire process. Great space and lovely amenities. "
7598743,54769641,2015-11-23,21301901,Bora,Great experience in Seattle at Cindy's apartment. Cindy was extremely communicative and organized and place was very clean. 
7598743,56551442,2015-12-14,42950965,Sophia,"The apt is exactly what you see in the picture. It was very nice of Cindy that prepared a set of towel, tooth brush, and two bottles of water for my friend and me.  The apartment is clean and cozy. The location is in a very safe neighborhood. Its my 1st time visit Seattle, and Cindy was really helpful by recommending places to go and app to use for transportation.  We didnt use the kitchen, but there was everything you need to make a nice breakfast :) "
7598743,57174243,2015-12-22,44106447,Alexandria,"Cindy's Apartment made my fiancé and I feel right at home! There were extra towels, and other essentials in case we needed them. There were also enough dishes that we were able to make our own meals. There's also a small convenience store we found right around the corner that had everything we needed grocery wise. It was nice, cozy, and within walking distance of everything! Overall we had a wonderful stay and would definitely recommend it! "
3294243,15343771,2014-07-07,663193,Purdy,"Paula was flexible, responsive, and very accommodating. We didn't get a chance to meet, but she was always available if we needed anything. Paula had a very organized binder with instructions, list of things to do, and tips for the place.

The condo was very clean and comfortable. We were provided with lots of soft towels and comfy sheets for the bed. Although her condo is by a busier road, we never noticed. It felt extremely quiet, and relaxing with a nice view of surrounding area.

The kitchen was well equipped for a chef, toys are available for the little ones, and the 2 bedrooms and 2 bathrooms offers a lot of space. We particularly enjoyed the comfy corner ""nook"" kitchen table - it was a great spot to enjoy the view, feel the breeze on your face, and have your breakfast. We can't wait to stay here again next time we're in Seattle!"
3294243,16104018,2014-07-22,16305687,Sandra,"My experience with Paula was pleasant. She is very organized and available for anything that I needed. She left a book on the counter that gave me ideas for things to do, local grocery stores and local coffee shops. Very helpful. The apartment was exactly as the pictures showed and Ballard is a wonderful town to visit. Great farmers market on Sundays is a must.  My experience was very easy and felt like home.  Paula put towels in each bathroom so I didn't have to go on a hunt for these items. I have non complaints.  "
3294243,17099650,2014-08-07,14701705,Emma,"Paula's description of her condo is spot on, beautiful, comfy and very well equiped with everything you need, especially in the kitchen. But seriously, don't plan on cooking much as there are so many great places to eat close by! The condo is about a 2 min walk from Cafe Besalu which is worth staying here for that reason alone, their pastries will put most Parisan Bakers to shame. Mornings were spent sipping coffee and trying to make out the majestic form of Mt Rainier through the morning mist. Ballard is a great location lots to do close by, or if you are feeling more adventurous bus or drive into downtown. We would gladly stay at Paula's place again on any future trips. Thank you Paula!
"
3294243,17891289,2014-08-18,19261061,Emma,"We were welcomed by our host Paula who was absolutely fantastic! Listing was completely accurate. We only saw Paula for a few minutes to get the key, but she made herself very available to us if we needed anything. Paula had a great binder with local information and recommendations in it which was really helpful. Location is in the heart of Ballard we were able to wake up and walk to grab delicious trendy breakfast knowing that the Sunday market and Golden Gardens park were close by if we wanted to go on an adventure. Apartment was clean and temperature was perfect despite the warm summer day.  Paula--we will be back!!!!! Thank you!!! "
3294243,18311969,2014-08-25,16959699,Helen,"Pictures were exactly as the apartment was. Great location, wonderfully equipped. Home away from home!
Paula was available at all times and even stopped by in person to check if we had everything we needed."
3294243,18633621,2014-08-29,10088275,Ryan,"First off the space is very nice and exactly as it appears in the listing. The location is also very convenient and although it's on a fairly busy street we didn't find the noise to be disruptive. Easy to get downtown by transit and loads of places to eat and drink within walking distance in the Ballard area. We had four people and found the apartment to be spacious and well appointed. We had a few communication breakdowns during confirmation and check-in but Paula was very apologetic and sincere. We didn't get to actually meet face to face but everything was as described. We found it a bit strange that we were charged a cleaning fee but also asked to strip linens from beds, sweep, empty garbages, etc. Not a deal breaker whatsoever, but something to keep in mind. Overall we were satisfied with our stay."
3294243,18794408,2014-09-01,16746118,Alison,"This was our first airbnb experience and we were most satisfied. We found the property’s description and photos accurate. It was well-appointed, very clean with an appealing decor. The bed was comfortable, the kitchen was well-stocked with needed utensils, dishes and appliances. The location’s views were most enjoyable and we spent sunny moments on the small deck, enjoying the city. There were no surprises and the unit filled our needs well.

Paula was very responsive to our inquiry and timely in follow-up as we arranged our stay. Prior to arrival, she provided contact information, directions and information to smooth our travel.  The communication with Paula was excellent before, during and after our visit. 

The location offered plenty of eating options within walking distance. Other attractions were either a short-drive or longer walk, including Market Avenue shops, Farmer’s Market and Ballard Locks. The unit is on a busier street, but when windows were closed, there was very little street noise (open windows offered a lovely cross-breeze). Paula provided a binder with useful information about the area, including some very good recommendations. She was available to answer questions as well.

We would return to the property again and would enthusiastically recommend it to others."
3294243,20144198,2014-09-24,15563271,Karen,"First let me say that the description of this accommodation was on the money.  The place looked just like the photos. The apartment was clean and complete with everything we needed.  We appreciated being provided with information about the area such as restaurants, places to go and transportation.  This apartment worked very well for myself and my husband and I would recommend this place to anyone looking for a place to stay in this area.  Paula provided a very lovely place for us to stay and only sorry we did not get a chance to meet her. As we do plan to return to the area, we would like to stay here again."
3294243,21551726,2014-10-19,18091432,Lia,"Tim and I came to Seattle on a special trip for his birthday. We loved staying at Paula's place in Ballard. It was within walking distance of all the great pubs and restaurants the Ballard neighborhood has to offer. The condo itself is very quiet and we liked the fact that Paula's family live in the building so there was always someone close by if we had any questions. The condo does indeed have a fantastic view of Mount Rainier and downtown Ballard. Though it is very nicely decorated, it is not ""overdone"" so it was very comfortable and we instantly felt right at home. Next time we come to Seattle, we are definitely staying here again if it is not booked!"
3294243,21894737,2014-10-26,163185,Laura,We had a great and easy experience at Paula's. The apartment was very tidy and very comfortable. The location was perfect. Everything in Ballard just a few steps away.  If I return to Seattle I will definitely rent from Paula again. Her apartment was a very good value.
3294243,22025292,2014-10-28,14851793,Michael,Love the apartment and location. 5 minute walk to the Ballard downtown area.
3294243,22204231,2014-11-01,18465216,Nicole,"Thanks so much Paula for the use if your place!  Everything was lovely, including great bedding and towels!  We thoroughly enjoyed our stay."
3294243,22359697,2014-11-04,12816234,Katie,"Host Paula greeted was warmly and made us feel at home! Everything we needed was there...including great neighborhood recommendations! Ballard has easy access to everything, when you don't want to stay in the middle of everything, and quite a few local gems."
3294243,22537710,2014-11-09,22448021,Chris & Laurie,"We were greeted by Paula's mom Laura, as Paula was out of town that weekend. She showed us to the condo and gave us a quick tour giving us everything we needed to know. The unit was just as described. We had a beautiful view of Mt. Rainier. There was plenty of room for the four of us to hang out when we were not running around Seattle. The decorations were in the apartment are wonderful. The beds are comfortable and so is the sofa. We had a great time here. The location was perfect. It is close to downtown Ballard and downtown Seattle. Thanks for making your home available to us!"
3294243,23365014,2014-11-30,9617511,Susan,"We loved our stay at this condo. It is in the wonderful Ballard District, with lots of neat places within walking distance. Our family stayed here for Thanksgiving and everything we needed was in the kitchen to cook a complete traditional Thanksgiving dinner. Paula was excellent at communicating with us, and checked in with us several times during our stay. She is a gracious, kind host and that is reflected in her condo's furnishing and feel. Her condo has nice touches such as a great supply of DVDs, books, and even a piano! We will definitely try to stay here again the next time we visit Seattle."
3294243,26131261,2015-02-04,20954298,Gretchen,"Paula's condo is great!  The space is clean, well-maintained, and enjoyable to be in.  The neighborhood has a ton of great spots for coffee and food.  We had a car and it was really easy to find parking right in front of the condo and get around the city from Ballard. I would definitely recommend this spot to anyone visiting Seattle and would love to come back and stay again."
3294243,26587224,2015-02-16,594216,Natalie,"Paula's place was an absolute dream! The condo was perfect for what we our weekend getaway with our in-laws. 

+ Condo +
The condo itself is well organized and has everything you could possibly need with a fully stocked kitchen, cozy living room, and comfortable beds. We had a little trouble with the heater and Paula's mother was just down the hall and stopped by within minutes to fix the issue. Although we didn't have kids with us, this place would be perfect for a family with small children as well!

+ Location +
It was close to the city and in beautiful Ballard where we could walk to the Sunday farmers market, delicious restaurants, vintage shops, and the Ballard locks, among other attractions. We did have a car which was easy to park at her place and found it very accessible to the rest of the city. 

We'll definitely be back!"
3294243,27625845,2015-03-08,25997835,August,"Just spent three nights in Paula's light and airy apartment in the Ballard district.  The well-equipped kitchen is a big plus, as are the views of Mount Rainier and the Olympics.  Paula was out of town but her mother kindly met us on arrival and gave us tips on the neighborhood.  If you like french pastries, Cafe Besalu down the street is an absolute must! "
3294243,28467623,2015-03-24,26438680,Antoinette,"Paula was a wonderful hostess. The condo was clean and comfortable, and I loved the neighborhood. Parking was easy but we were walking distance from coffee shops, restaurants, and stores. I appreciated that Paula left us a book with recommendations and other information."
3294243,29544313,2015-04-09,25905063,Gail,We received a warm welcome and had a nice tour of the condo before having an opportunity to settle in.  The condo was just as depicted in the photos.  Previous reviews accurately depicted the place.  My husband and I loved the view  and especially enjoyed the mornings and evenings in this inviting condo.
3294243,36939171,2015-07-03,9675226,Amy,"Travelling to Paula's place was easy. With a bus stop right outside it was straightforward to find and get into the apartment. Once checked in, the apartment was very clean and well looked after. Lots of clean towels, a comfy bed, plus a nice light bright living kitchen area - lots of home comforts including an iPod dock made Paula's apartment very homely and great to stay in.

Ballard is also a really fantastic area - the apartment is just a few blocks up from loads of restaurants, bars, shops etc.

We didn't directly meet Paula but she made it clear she was close by if we needed anything. "
3294243,37281235,2015-07-06,26131296,Charlene,Beautiful home with rustic feel.  We could see ourselves living there.  The bed was very comfortable with great sheets.  Paula had a Pack 'n Play crib with clean sheets and blankets available in the second bedroom for the baby.  Elevator was very helpful for bringing up luggage and the baby.  A view of the Seattle skyline is visible in the distance and we could see the 4th of July fireworks from the apartment.  Walking distance to some great restaurants and a supermarket.  Street noise can easily be heard but was not a major problem for us.  There is no microwave if you need it.
3294243,38093925,2015-07-13,26133666,Mike,The  beautiful Ballard condo was everything we could have wanted. Great neighborhood and easy parking. Everything  was within walking distance and we were right on a bus line. The condo was clean and equipped with everything we would need. Paula was a great hostess and available to answer any questions. I would love to stay there again on our next trip to Seattle!
3294243,39262080,2015-07-22,6512530,Amy,Really great apartment with comfy beds and great views. She had so many kitchen supplies! We even made food from one of the recipe books. There was a lot of information about things to do in the Ballard area and Seattle to help us make a really great trip!
3294243,40343180,2015-07-30,16056092,New,We had a really wonderful time at Paula's apartment. Paula was extremely accommodating and we had some wonderful experiences and meals around Ballard and Seattle thanks to her recommendations. The apartment was very conveniently located with bus stops to the downtown area on the doorstep. We really enjoyed exploring the neighbourhood and the apartment had all the comforts and facilities to make our stay relaxing and enjoyable. If you are in the Seattle area we recommend this as a wonderful place to stay.
3294243,45762862,2015-09-06,22775309,Robert,"Paula made us feel right at home. There was Starbucks coffee and tea available and the kitchen was stocked with everything we needed to cook a few meals. Paula left a binder full of info (things to do,restaurants,etc.)
We really thought the location was very convenient to all areas of Seattle and the view was great. Our trip was excellent and would definitely stay here again!!"
3294243,50742730,2015-10-14,35392144,Jessica,"Paula's home is lovely; we stayed for four days and were so happy with our experience! The kitchen/dining/living room area is warm and comfortable - we spent hours hanging out there with our toddler, while he went crazy over the toys Paula generously made available. Paula herself was lovely - available if needed, not around otherwise. Overall I'd highly recommend staying here."
1167507,4926688,2013-06-02,5586069,Charles,"we much enjoyed our stay at Thomas & Leona's, they are a warm and friendly couple, very kind and helpful. Their knowledge and advice helped us  to  navigate, & explore  the city.  The rental was exactly as advertised: clean, warm, cozy  & yet spacious. the bed was very comfortable. The full kitchen and full bath were well supplied, & immaculately clean. The apartment was centrally located, nothing was more than a 25 minute drive away.  The immediate area is  quiet, the traffic, what there was, is minimal. There is a  small  jewel of a neighborhood park close by. We would return here in a heartbeat, and will recommend it highly."
1167507,5103761,2013-06-12,1166240,Nancy,"The basement apartment was comfortable and VERY clean. Leona was kind and helpful with her advice on the area, and then left us on our own to enjoy the place, which we appreciated. 

I will mention that you can hear kid/s running upstairs and the very occasional conversation, but we didn't mind either as they were not too intrusive.

The location is great for exploring (somewhat posh) Queen Anne, and there are two nearby bus-stops for hitting other parts of town. I actually found the walk downtown both doable and enjoyable, but it's not for those unaccustomed to hills. "
1167507,5189488,2013-06-17,2316241,Clarissa,"I reserved this rental for my parents while they visited Seattle. Says my mother: ""The apt. was cozy, comfortable, and very clean.  A great home away from home with everything that you would need.  At check in, Leona was extremely helpful and courteous.  She gave us excellent info about the neighborhood and even included some grocery ads and coupons for the local markets.  I had a couple of questions while we were there.  I texted her and she gave an immediate response.  I would highly recommend this rental."""
1167507,5268914,2013-06-21,2893262,Kat,"The Queen Anne apartment was perfect for our stay in Seattle! Getting to the Seattle Center was a short walk and it was also located to many grocery stores and small coffee shops. The apartment had everything we needed, from a lot of towels to a fully equipped kitchen. It really made us feel like we were living in Seattle rather than just passing by. Thomas and Leona were such gracious hosts and we hope to be back in Seattle soon!"
1167507,5367440,2013-06-26,5925121,Paul,"Great for 2 people - cozy, clean, quiet, well equipped.  If there are more than two in your crew, it could be a bit cramped.  If you are driving, hope  you are comfortable with steep hills ;-)"
1167507,5788307,2013-07-16,6743046,Sharada,This place was nicely decorated. Very clean. Nice neighborhood. They had a two headed shower that felt so wonderful. The bed was comfortable. Very private. The host was very nice.
1167507,6530811,2013-08-16,6337938,Amy,"We had such an amazing holiday with Thomas & Leona. The place was fantastic, extremely clean, and exactly what we were looking for. Queen Anne is the perfect location to explore Seattle, only about 7 minutes walk (with the shortcut) to the Space Needle. Leona was always very accommodating and always offering to help us out. We had the best time here. Will definitely stay again next time we're in Seattle! Thank you!"
1167507,6707151,2013-08-22,6762508,Nathaniel,"We had a perfect vacation at Leona and Thomas' place. The apartment was cozy, welcoming, clean, and tastefully appointed. Ideal for two people, or possibly for a couple with one or two small children. The location is great, in a charming neighborhood within easy walking distance of lots of cafes, restaurants, and attractions. Leona was a fabulous and attentive hostess. We felt lucky to have found this place. Thank you Leona and Thomas!"
1167507,6795249,2013-08-25,8082890,Donna,"Thomas and Leona were terrific hosts! Their ground floor apartment was nicely appointed, quiet and extremely clean. Leona was engaging and very helpful. She even gave tips for getting around. This was our first time using Airbnb, but thanks to our great experience with Thomas and Leona, it won’t be our last. We hope to stay with them again on our next visit to Seattle."
1167507,7160713,2013-09-09,7541516,Tom,"We had a great time in Seattle. The MIL was the perfect home-base for us. We walked most everywhere and then took advantage of the nearby public transportation. Apartment was great, clean and well equipped, and in a nice quiet neighborhood. Not too far from eateries, grocery, drug store etc.,  The walk to city center as directed by Leona had great views of the city. Leona was very helpful and friendly. Queen Ann has a lot of ups and downs but the bus stop at Boston and 4th was an easy walk of only a few blocks (Taylor and Galer is a climb!). No complaints, better than a hotel. Thanks so much to Leona and Thomas!"
1167507,7679238,2013-09-29,8820376,Robert,Greatly enjoyed our stay here. The unit was stylishly decorated and very clean. The kitchen had a good supply of dinner ware and utensils. The hosts provided good information on nearby restaurants. Great location with beautiful view of the city just down the street. The roads leading to the house were surprisingly steep. We had planned to rent bikes and ride to the house. Took the bikes by car instead.
1167507,7858868,2013-10-06,8897258,Carlos,"Clean, tidy and well equipped. The neighbourhood is fantastic but you have to be in good shape or use the public transport if you don't have a car. Great place to stay in Seattle."
1167507,7956737,2013-10-09,5003162,Chuck,We needed to book at the last minute in Seattle and Thomas & Leona stepped right up.  Their apartment is a wonderful place to stay and is in a gorgeous neighborhood.  Leona responded right away to our messages and had everything set for us when we checked in.  We travel to Seattle several times a year and now wish we had known of Thomas & Leona's place before.  
1167507,8139481,2013-10-17,8245278,Nosheen,"We had a lovely time in Seattle, Tom and Leona's apartment looked just like the pictures, and was very clean.  They were very friendly and organized, and quickly replied to any questions we had.  I would only caution that the pull out sofa was not very comfortable. 

The location was close to all the attractions we wanted to go to, we had bought the Seattle City Pass.  We rented a car and were happy we did, there are a lot of hills in the area and it would have been difficult to walk especially with the kids. 

Thanks for having us!"
1167507,8422301,2013-10-29,9579130,Angelina,"Thomas & Leona's Mother-In-Law was clean, quiet, and well-organized, and they were gracious enough to host us last-minute!  The location is excellent. We had a great time exploring the lovely neighborhood and beyond."
1167507,8529827,2013-11-04,9219670,Emily,"Such a wonderful place to stay. Just the right amount of space for a vacation or weekend getaway. Easy access to bus stops and just a short walk from Queen Anne's shops and restaurants, not to mention close to one of the best views of Seattle. Highly recommended!"
1167507,13419543,2014-05-27,2849918,Laura,"I cannot say enough good things about Thomas and Leona's rental. Everything was more than adequate for our needs. Their neighborhood is beautiful, very quiet, and easily accessible to restaurants and bus routes (we took bus 4 most of the time). They gave us great directions for our arrival, and they have a binder prepared with everything we needed as far as bus maps, restaurant suggestions, emergency info, etc. The living room is comfortable and cozy, and the kitchen was well equipped which allowed us to prepare many meals there. The bed is very comfortable with plenty of blankets and pillows. The weather was a little chilly for us Californians, so we took advantage of the heater they provided.  It was a perfect place for us, thank you, Thomas and Leona! "
1167507,14129679,2014-06-12,15373743,Colleen,"Experience was wonderful.  Thomas and Leona were helpful and always responsive via text messaging.  I was in town with family and needed a getaway place...this was absolutely wonderful.  Close proximity to everything.  One of the biggest perks was the parking right in front of the apartment; for those who are not familiar with Seattle and you are driving, parking can be one of your worst nightmares.  The apartment stayed very cool, which is another Seattle element, very few (if any) locations will have AC. 

Overall, wonderful time and wonderful hosts.  It provided me a chance to get away and not be bothered by anyone.  Leona was certainly available via text, but as a true introvert, the lack of intrusion was just what I needed.  I also had the WONDERFUL surprise of coming back to cherries one night.  Thank you so much! "
1167507,14282682,2014-06-16,14940342,Emilie,"We loved this adorable Queen Anne Mother-In-Law!  We were celebrating our son's graduation from Seattle Pacific University and the location of this place was perfect.  Although we wish we had known about this MIL when our son was a freshman, we definitely plan to stay here for any future travel.  The hosts left us a note that we can stay pass check-out time (1:00pm) since nobody was checking in on that day.  We thought that was extra kind of them.  We would highly recommend this rental unit!"
1167507,15593061,2014-07-12,17126844,Karen,"Thomas and Leona were great hosts. The instructions for check in we're very clear and thorough. Their place was so comfortable and cozy. We had everything we needed for our stay! Plenty of towels, fully equipped kitchen so we could make our own meals, and a comfortable bed. I loved the attention to detail. There was a folder with lots of information and interesting facts about the area, as well as brochures about things to do in nearby Fremont. We will definitely be staying here again!"
1167507,15818523,2014-07-16,15153037,Blake,"We had an excellent stay. The location was great, the apartment had everything you would need for a great stay and was very clean. When you consider the location and off street parking included it was a great value.  The hosts were accommodating to late check in and were extremely responsive to any questions or needs we had. Which was really not much as they had everything in place including an ice pack in the freezer to use in your cooler, umbrellas (we lucked out and did not have to use) and great instructions and information on the area.  The Queen Anne neighborhood was great - it has everything you need (restaurants, Grocery, bakery, etc) along with parka with great views (don't miss Kerry Park).  It is also strategically located near Space Needle, Chihuly Glass Garden, Pikes Place Market and Lake Union. "
1167507,16198773,2014-07-23,13812248,Brittany,"We needed a place nearby Key Arena for the weekend and the MIL was perfect for our needs! I primarily dealt with Leona, and she was very available and friendly. Whenever an issue would arise, she was quick to respond and remedy the problem with minimal trouble. The price beat anywhere else nearby and we were all very comfortable and enjoyed our stay thoroughly. If I need a place to stay in Seattle again, this will absolutely be the first place I look. "
1167507,16421617,2014-07-27,5675754,Chris,"We had a great stay at Leona and Thomas' beautiful MIL suite in the gorgeous Queen Anne section of Seattle. We arrived very early in the morning so the keybox approach for entry was perfect. The apartment contained everything we needed for our short stay and we have no problems whatsoever.  We would definitely recommend their place highly and would stay there anytime we could. We loved Seattle.
"
1167507,16616088,2014-07-30,16526411,Mary Liz,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay. The apt. is comfortable and clean and in a GREAT location.  Nice walk, or easy cab ride ($10) to most anywhere in the City ~ not far from downtown.  Just big enough for the 3 of us, my husband and teenage daughter and me. Close to yummy coffee shop and restaurants by taking a nice stroll in the n'hood. Nice and private. Great host can be contacted if / when you need.  The Queen Anne neighborhood charming architecture and fabulous views of the City of Seattle make for a perfect stay.  We would absolutely stay there again!  "
1167507,17498276,2014-08-13,9124996,Eitan,"I booked the Mother-In-Law suite for my father as well as my older aunt and uncle for two weeks when they were visiting Seattle for my wedding. My younger brother also joined them for part of the stay. Thomas and Leona were extremely communicative throughout the booking process and during the stay. They graciously offered to perform a complimentary cleaning midway through the stay, and having laundry facilities was very beneficial as well.

The neighborhood is great, as it was a 5min walk from our wedding venue and there's a Safeway nearby. It's very easy to get downtown for all of the touristy sites, and the parking spot was awesome as they rented a car to get around to destinations slightly out of the city.

I asked my relatives what they thought, and my dad says ""yes we liked the place and we would like to recommend it to others"". My younger brother said ""Although its a little small for 4 people the AirBnB is at a great location with a Safeway not too far away."" (We were definitely aware of the size before we booked.)

They had a great time staying and the location was so convenient. Thanks!"
1167507,17937044,2014-08-19,16792814,Terry,"Enjoyed our stay. It was clean, comfortable, and had plenty of towels and hot water. Location was perfect. Would stay here again. "
1167507,19024056,2014-09-05,5080211,Tram,"This place was perfect for our stay in Seattle. It was very cozy and clean. It is near bus lines 3 & 4 which will take you downtown. Upon (email hidden), Thomas and Leona provided brochures and maps of Seattle and it's many attractions. They provide umbrellas and shopping bags for your stay as well. Also, Thomas and Leona provide a folder which gives you all the information you need to stay at their place (wifi instructions, trash instructions, hot spots near by, grocery stores nearby, restaurants nearby, etc.) There is a parking spot available in the drive way. This location is near VERY steep hills. You will hear footsteps and voices on the floor above you when you stay here. 9/10. Would book again. "
1167507,19530202,2014-09-14,13142011,Marietta,"The description of the MIL apt. is exactly how it was described in AIRBNB.....warm and cozy, quiet and located in a very nice, private neighborhood and only walking distance to the numerous Seattle tourist sites.  The apt. is very clean and it has everything you'll need when you're in a home away from home.  It has a great view of the city and the lake while walking down hill from the apt. to get to the city.  There are plenty of information pamphlets about the area available for the guests which is very helpful for newcomers like us. I would definitely stay here again when I return to Seattle to visit my son.
"
1167507,19836640,2014-09-19,20615682,Jeffrey,"I found the place to be clean and convenient. It's nicely located, as long as you don't mind walking up and down big hills. Very quiet and peaceful. Didn't get a chance to meet my hosts, though they were very gracious and quickly responded to my messages. Would definitely recommend."
1167507,20573177,2014-10-01,8803056,Angela,"My friend and I had such a great stay at Thomas and Leona's lovely home.  Leona was apologetic because there was some construction going on when we arrived, and went above and beyond making up for it by leaving us a sweet note, fruit, vegetables, and a bottle of wine.   That was so unnecessary, as the work being done didn't bother us one bit, but we really appreciated the gesture and definitely made us feel welcome.  The neighborhood was gorgeous...better than we expected...super convenient if you're comfortable taking the bus around (which we were).   We loved it so much, and would definitely stay there again! "
1167507,20878932,2014-10-06,485950,Chris,"Communication ahead of time was great. The space was very clean, furniture was nice. All in all a lovely place to stay. 

Great location, too. Quick walk to the Queen Anne ""village center"" and good connections to the city. "
1167507,24602451,2014-12-31,24127837,Marnie,"Our hosts were very responsive to any questions or concerns we had regarding our stay. Anything we needed was immediately taken care of. The accommodations were very clean, and looked as advertised. The queen bed was comfortable, and there were plenty of additional blankets should those be needed. We appreciated their thoughtful appointments (such as a hairdryer in the bathroom and coffee filters for the coffee maker). I would recommend this to anyone!"
1167507,25824018,2015-01-26,6728086,Daniel,"Thomas and Leona were gracious hosts, starting with the first few minutes after my arrival when the power went out in the neighbourhood! Leona quickly came downstairs to provide me with flashlights and a candle and even offered me to use their kitchen upstairs if I needed to heat anything up (b/c this apartment's kitchen runs on electricity).

The apartment space is great, and basically everything you'd need for a short or long-term stay. Clean, comfortable bed, couches, etc. It's nice. 

The location is also pretty great. Prepare to walk up a couple hills if you're going to or from the nearby restaurants, but there's an endless list of delicious places to eat and drink in Queen Anne and Lower Queen Anne. It's also a relatively easy walk to the Seattle Center (Space Needle). Most days, I'd walk down the hill to wherever I was eating, then take a Lyft back to the apartment for a few bucks because I was lazy.

Extra plus for those with a car: Off-street parking. 

My only nitpick, and this is not a criticism of the apartment at all, just a personal thing that I'd like to make others aware of: This apartment is not for really tall people (after all, it is a basement apartment!). I'm 6'3"" (190cm), and I was nearly grazing my head on the main doorway, ceiling beams, etc. I bonked my head on a light next to the bed when I was getting up from plugging something into the nearby electrical outlet. Also, the foot of the bedframe doesn't allow you to hang your feet off the end, so if you're 6'5"" or taller and don't sleep in the fetal position, you will feel confined. Again, this isn't intended as a slight against the apartment, it's just #tallpeopleproblems. Just want to make people aware in case there are any 7 footers looking to stay here :)"
1167507,28078123,2015-03-17,2161808,Lynda,"I felt immediately welcomed - Leona was there to show me the ropes, and there were even fresh flowers on the table for me.  Nice neighborhood though I usually took Lyft ride back at end of day because the hill was so steep (down was fine - up was rough).  The apartment was clean, comfortable, and quiet. "
1167507,28488330,2015-03-24,19873479,Jasmine,"Tom and Leona were very responsive throughout all of our communications. They made it very easy to check in and check out. The MIL is small, but a good size for a small family. The kitchen wares were a plus and a minus: the pots and pans are really good, but the cooking utensils were not very good--pieces of plastic floated off into our food as we were cooking. They included disposable chopsticks, so we were still able to cook! A lovely and comfortable stay in a beautiful neighborhood. If you get the chance, you should definitely walk around that area!"
1167507,28752265,2015-03-29,25240085,Josh,"The stay in Thomas and Leona's MIL unit was fantastic. My friend and I had an excellent time and we're actually disappointed that we didn't book for a couple more days. The unit had everything you need for a short, mid or longer term stay - comfortable bed, clean bathroom, well-equipped lounge room, and a small but certainly adequate kitchen. The hosts also provide plenty of helpful information about both the unit and Seattle itself. 

The neighbourhood is quiet, safe and a useful base for exploring surrounding areas or downtown Seattle. Queen Anne is quite hilly, but there's always the cheap option of Uber and Lyft if you don't feel like the walk back up the hills after going out to a bar or restaurant. 

We'd both definitely stay again."
1167507,29761278,2015-04-12,5448319,Roger,"If you are staying in Seattle as a tourist, you cannot go wrong with this listing. There is no better location than the wonderful Queen Anne neighborhood. Just walk the length of Bigelow Avenue and you'll see truly beautiful residential  architecture.  

The area has wonderful restaurants within walking distance and is a bus-ride or downhill walk (about 40 min.) to downtown. 

Returning home its a $10 taxi fare.

1167507,32555325,2015-05-19,6809331,Jess,"We really liked this place! Very comfortable, in a beautiful neighborhood, and perfect cozy size for 2 people. "
1167507,33873482,2015-06-01,8053976,Shanan,"The mother in law suite is exactly as you would hope and bigger than you'd expect -- well-appointed, clean, and inviting. It is set on a quiet street with easy access to downtown, Queen Anne, and Capitol Hill. It was a great base for my quick weekend in town. "
1167507,34525431,2015-06-09,29517348,Janis,"Owners communicated and there very responsive.  We were informed by way of a note that there would be neighborhood garage sales on a Saturday that we were staying there and it would be busy.  We strolled through the street that had some garage sales and had a good time.  The unit offers a parking spot, so parking was not a problem.  This was a great bonus!  We loved the Queen Anne neighborhood filled with big, stately homes and mature trees.  We were thankful to have a rental car as we explored downtown Seattle and the surrounding areas and had a short time in which to see a lot.

The kitchen had all the utensils and dishes that we needed for breakfast.  There was a also some oil, sugar, salt and pepper that was very useful to have. The bathroom is on the small side, especially the sink.  The bed is quite comfortable.  It was nice to have a hairdryer in the bathroom.

The unit is super clean and cozy!

We were warned about some creaking stairs and some walking above us, but some nights it was more than we would have liked and it went past 10 pm and early am.

There is another door/window to owner's unit once you enter it. This area is not very private as it is visible both ways."
1167507,35290320,2015-06-17,25741601,Devon,"Thomas and Leona were fantastic hosts. We stayed in the apartment underneath their house and it was the perfect size for 4 friends over 5 days. Thomas and Leona were gracious enough to have given us a ton of information on the neighborhood we were staying in, how to get around Seattle, and Seattle in general. Their home is located in a beautiful area with amazing views of the city. I would definitely recommend staying in this beautiful house during your trip to Seattle. "
1167507,35909826,2015-06-23,28770262,Elizabeth,"Hi! Thank you so much for having my mom stay in your AirBnB. She had a great time and was really happy with having a little kitchen to keep food in. It was a much better experience than being in a generic hotel room, and she really enjoyed it. I appreciate your help in planning her stay, it worked out perfectly!"
1167507,36411106,2015-06-28,33692210,Mark,"hosts were very nice
a lot of nice stores and restaurants within walking distance
neighborhood was very safe"
1167507,37047605,2015-07-04,6678142,Lyndall,"We had a great stay. The flat was clean and suited our purposes well. We are two older women travelling together. We walked to where we needed to be every day and it was great to come 'home' to relax. 

Leona was welcoming and generous. We arrived late on Sunday night and we asked for a cup of milk for tea. She gave us a carton of milk, fruit, eggs so we could have a snack. That made a huge difference given we didn't have a car to shop and had been on a long flight. 

Leona was responsive to every request. And at the same time left us alone to enjoy our stay. It was a little hot and we walked up the steep hill from Queen Anne every day so we asked if there was a fan. Leona said she didn't have one as the flat is cool. We came home to find a new fan waiting for us. They were also happy for us to have a late check out. Very flexible and friendly hosts.

The flat is small (cosy for two as the description says) and was fine for two adult friends. Please do note that the bedroom is separated from the rest of the flat by a curtain, it isn't actually a separate bedroom.  The bed is comfy, and there is a sofa bed which is not so comfy for us as two older women. 

The kitchen has all you need, and importantly there is an excellent shower. 

Thanks Leona and family 

"
1167507,37562700,2015-07-08,31478643,Lisa,The place was great! Exactly as listed. In a very beautiful neighborhood and easy walk to the Seattle Center. Very clean and Leona was a very communicative and responsive hostess. We had a fabulous time in Seattle!
1167507,38253775,2015-07-14,28885022,Maria,"Our visit to Seattle was enhanced by our stay at the Queen Anne Mother-in-Law space.  The space is bright, clean, comfortable and welcoming.  It met our needs perfectly.  The neighborhood is lovely and quiet, good for rest after a day exploring the city.  Tom and Leona are excellent hosts.  Their directions for use of the MIL space were clear and accurate.  They responded to questions quickly and were not at all intrusive.  I highly recommend this Airbnb.
Maria Childress"
1167507,38585527,2015-07-17,29745810,Ashley,"Very nice place, clean and well furnished. Very close to the Space Needle/Seattle Center and not far from the rest of downtown. Plenty of parking on the street, we never had any trouble no matter when we pulled in."
1167507,38999956,2015-07-20,25711651,Jo,"This Airbnb was great! Perfect location for staying in town, We could easily walk to breakfast on Queen Anne Ave. Getting downtown to meet friends was a quick and cheap cab ride. The room had everything we needed with living room, kitchen, and two headed shower. The owners were very nice and emailed us when we parked in the wrong spot so that we didn't get towed. We had an amazing weekend and a great stay."
1167507,40072145,2015-07-28,2318684,John,"Great location, close to bus and downtown . Quiet neighborhood.
Exactly as discribed and pictured. great MIL all the comforts of home. "
1167507,40902767,2015-08-03,32615453,John,We had a great time in Seattle. The apartment  was clean and comfortable. I love the smell of lavender as we walked in. The hosts were friendly and helpful. It was in a  great location in Queen Anne. I would recommend this apartment and would stay here again.
1167507,42107081,2015-08-11,27178540,Genevieve,"We stayed here for The Dota 2 International TI5 and it was SUCH an AWESOME place for the price! We totally lucked out. This is a beautiful home in a gorgeous location, right up on top of the Queen Anne hills, and if you walked a few blocks over in the evening, you get this picture-perfect view of the Seattle skyline, complete with the Space Needle, city lights, and docks.

Tom and Leona were wonderful hosts! They are very organized and left clear and simple instructions all around the room to ensure the place was kept clean and undamaged. For example, I liked the note to take our shoes off while inside the room (which I usually do in my own house) so I felt more peace of mind while walking barefoot around the place, relieved that the floors were clean and dirt-free. 

They kindly provided some nice pamphlets on Seattle sightseeing on the coffee table as well as in the very informative binder where it contained the WiFi login info. The living room and bedroom nook was exactly as the pictures described, and the place was cozy and tidy. I liked the double shower heads, that was really nice! All the essentials were provided: dishes, towels, appliances and cookware... they even had some new bottled waters chilled in the fridge, small shampoo samplers, caramel melts for the pancake mix, and extra blankets. Everything was well maintained, clean and operational. There was a neat convection oven which we used to toast waffles.

The living room area was fairly spacious with two very comfortable couches, plenty of windows for ventilation, and a small electric fan (we used it as it was a particularly hot week!). There were even board games and a cute mini bingo cage, though we had plenty to do while in this beautiful city! The bed was very large and comfortable, and since we were staying around a week, we were allowed access to the laundry.

Tom and Leona were always very friendly and helpful to us whenever we happened to see each other while waiting outside for the Uber. Leona even gave us clear instructions on where to find the ""secret stairs"" that led straight down to the Key Arena--it was very fast and saved us a lot on taking Uber everyday! She also informed us of where the closest convenience stores were located. The whole neighborhood felt very safe and quiet!

Wonderful time, wonderful hosts! I hope we can stay here next year!"
1167507,43069220,2015-08-17,26109637,Sarah,Great location and very clean!
1167507,43751116,2015-08-22,13656293,Andrea,"The apartment was amazing, very comfortable, clean and it had everything I needed (and much more).
The neighborhood was quiet and close to downtown, with plenty of free parking spots on the street.
Leona and Tom was wonderful hosts: everything was perfectly organized, and they have been always very kind and helpful.
When I'll come back to Seattle (a great city), I will definitely choose their place again."
1167507,44533398,2015-08-27,16544197,Bihui,The MIL is in a lovely historical neighborhood. We met Tom when we checked in and he was very helpful in introducing us to the neighbourhood and orienting us. There are great coffee shops and grocery stores near by. The kitchen is fully equipped and we made ourselves breakfast a few mornings. We enjoyed our walk to Kerry park and space needle. Getting to downtown was a short Uber ride. I would definitely stay again if I visit Seattle again.
1167507,45251693,2015-09-01,35319746,Kasey,"My friend and I stayed in this MIL for a few days while taking in the Seattle sights. Space was very clean, comfortable and spacious. Appreciated the fully equipped kitchen. Location is in a quiet neighborhood away from the city bustle – but only 2-3 miles from downtown and the highway. Neighborhood is Upper Queen Anne, so you’re going to drive up a couple of steep hills to reach the house (I’m a Florida girl so that was interesting , ha). But it was easy to find. Hosts were very responsive and accommodating. Highly recommend.   "
1167507,46284743,2015-09-09,23189728,Eric,"Thomas and Leona were extremely welcoming.  Their space had everything laid out and provided all needs for a kitchen, as well as providing information for around the area. They were also quite accommodating of all requests (which were minimal)."
1167507,46639718,2015-09-12,30324583,Clover,"It's a pretty nice stay in a great location to view Seattle on a hill. The room is even better than the photos, really beautiful, clean and cozy. The neighborhood is also one of the best in Seattle. I will definitely come back to have a stay again. A++."
1167507,47157373,2015-09-16,35919150,Erin,"My brother and I enjoyed our stay in the MIL suite. The pictures do not do this place justice-felt roomy enough for two people. The Queen Anne neighborhood has some great options for food and coffee, yet downtown is within minutes. Loved the proximity to Kerry park and all the great views. We didn't want to leave! Will recommend this to anyone visiting Seattle."
1167507,48092435,2015-09-23,41506967,David,"This is a wonderful location and the MIL suite
as well as the grounds are immaculate.  The views from the neighborhood are stunning.  Is was a short, albeit steep, walk to Seattle Center and the restaurants of Queen Anne Blvd.  Leona was kind enough to let us use the dryer when we came home soaked to the skin from a rainy day even though we weren't there the required 7 days.  "
1167507,51059138,2015-10-17,45453592,Kip,"Thomas and Leona have a wonderful apartment in an awesome location! It's in a very quiet and beautiful neighborhood (Queen Anne) and close to everything. I stayed there for two weeks while I was in town and they are fully equipped with kitchen and laundry (for those staying long term) which made my stay as smooth as possible. Street parking was easy any time of day or night.  

They are gracious hosts and I would definitely choose to stay here again. I highly recommend considering this place when visiting Seattle!"
1167507,56294208,2015-12-11,29996984,Denice,The host canceled this reservation 14 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.

She welcomed us warmly.
The room is as described small, but very cozy and the beds are comfortable and clean.
The apartment is centrally located and you feel safe in the neighborhood.
All attractions are within walking distance.
Always again.. And thank's a lot for the nice Host to Heather :)"
6278361,32937990,2015-05-23,17263140,Yuen Mei,Heather is great! Her place is clean and comfortable. The toilet is shared and that's as clean as it can be. The apartment is really nicely decorated and super convenient for everything. Pike place is 3 blocks away and the train station is a mile away. 
6278361,33301077,2015-05-26,22408681,Amber,"Heather was a gracious and wonderful hostess.  She went out of her way to accomodate my arrival and offered great tips on downtown parking.  Despite being located in the heart of downtown, Heather's place is cozy and quiet. "
6278361,34142078,2015-06-05,32721359,Ilin,"Heather was a great hostess. Hospitable, helpful, flexible, and down-to-earth chill. The room is exactly as she describes and the location is simply unbeatable. She recommended so many places for me to visit that I ended up going and liking. The apartment is adorable and perfect for the single lady who needs a hub to explore the City. Bravo and Namaste."
6278361,34644933,2015-06-10,31751257,Lexi,"Heather is awesome! Perfect place to stay and it is super convenient especially when traveling with no car.  Perfect space for solo lady travelers. Heather is very welcoming, sweet, and accommodating. I would definitely recommend staying here, and I would happily stay again! Thanks for everything. "
6278361,35028805,2015-06-14,29297855,Claire And Clay,"A great communicator, Heather met and showed me the workings of this historic brick apartment, showing high regard for my comfort and privacy. It is exciting to foster a new friendship, and talk of travels, languages and culture. Fantastic value for a small shared space and bathroom, in an unsurpassable downtown location. Thank-you for your sweet, quality retreat, Heather, you are a most gracious host."
6278361,35435310,2015-06-18,6721333,Julie,Heather was able tobacco date me on a last minute trip. She responded quickly to help make everything work out smoothly. The place is conveniently located right next to Pike's Place and is a 8 minute walk to the convention center.  There's a lot of history to the place as well and you'll have to ask Heather! 
6278361,35579371,2015-06-20,23955158,Selina,I so glad Heather was my host...She is so hospitality and kindness. 
6278361,36109512,2015-06-25,24346839,Rizza,"Heather was an absolute amazing host. When my cousin and I were all settled in, Heather supplied us with a map of the city, which included where the apartment was located and noted some of the activities and restaurants around the area that we should go to.  Very great communicator and is very flexible with your check in and check out time.  
Building is located in the heart of downtown; walking distance to most tourist attractions and located conveniently next to one of the light rail stations. 
Highly recommend to anyone coming to explore beautiful Seattle. "
6278361,36679359,2015-06-30,3868380,Stacey And George,"Heather was so accommodating. She was incredibly flexible with our arrival time, and gave us great ideas of where to go (ask her about the pasta place!!), supplied us with maps, etc. Really pleasant person and a great place."
6278361,37970247,2015-07-12,11248111,Bryan,"Heather was a wonderful host. She even connected me with her friend on San Jun island, told me where to find the best ears, and took me to her favorite yoga instructors.  Her place couldn't be more ideal. The bed is very comfortable. "
6278361,39752934,2015-07-26,14960597,Rachel,"The ultimate downtown retreat: a truly unique experience at an unbeatable price point. This apartment is smack dab in the middle of everything, but manages to be quiet, cozy, and comfortable. Nestled away on the fourth floor of what used to be the Diller Hotel, Heather and her space are welcoming, relaxed and accommodating. This one deserves an all-caps RECOMMENDED. "
6278361,40290100,2015-07-29,34531210,Lucy,very good location! and the bed is comfortable! Heather is very friendly and beautiful! The only thing is it's hard to park in Seattle! be aware of it! But it's free street parking on Sunday and every night after 8pm. 
6278361,40440007,2015-07-31,1167022,Hannah,"Heather was the perfect host! It was my first time in Seattle and she really made it that little bit more special with restaurant suggestions and unique things to see and do. I really enjoyed my time. Her apartment is right in town. The perfect location- everything is so close. 
Thanks again Heather! Christin"
6278361,41078002,2015-08-04,3381494,Kelly & Kevin,"My friend and I stayed with Heather and we highly recommend this airbnb IF you want to save some money and are okay with staying in a small space. That being said...it was perfect for us! 

Heather covers everything about the unique aspects of her place in the description - no wifi, very cramped living space, bathroom down the hall, etc. 

It was super conveniently located to Pike Place Market and the Light Rail! Heather is so sweet, welcoming, and easy to talk to. We went to bed early one night and she was super quiet/turned off all the lights. 

It was HOT when we went and the apartment was very HOT. We had a fan on us but make sure you bring comfortable sleeping clothes. I slept in a sports bra and it was heavenly! Ear plugs are a must - we could hear the street noise (loud cars) since all the windows were open. Also, bring shower shoes if the idea of showering in a communal bathroom is weird for you. 

For the price - this place is a total winner! The beds were really comfy too. 

Thanks, Heather!!"
6278361,41619062,2015-08-08,36213033,Jin,Heather真的非常好非常好！！！very good！！！我们这四天非常愉快而且很舒服！我们有四件巨大的行李！走的那天大早上Heather帮我们搬下去，一直送到地铁上～真的爱死她了！
6278361,42134946,2015-08-11,26315169,Elizabeth,"Heather provided a central, secure, clean and individual space (separated by a curtain) with a very comfortable mattress.  It was easy to get to and accessible to all the major attractions by foot (the art museum is across the street). The bathroom is down the hall and shared with the other residents on the floor, it remained clean during my stay. I also found Heather to be fun and easygoing and she gave some very nice recommendations for restaurants.  I was quite happy with the living arrangement and I would not hesitate to stay with her again.  "

The bed on the floor was really comfortable and the bathroom was spotless even if shared which is not always a given. Heather seems to be a really sweet person but we just saw each other 5 minutes. Communication was easy and efficient.  I surely would come back if in Seattle..."
6278361,50110632,2015-10-09,6715029,Angela,"Really goood location to everywhere! Clean and cozy，safe and warm apt for girl like me to stay. Heather is so helpful, wonderful，beautiful and details mind so i could have a unforgettable experience in Seattle.  Nice place to visit, nice place to stay:)"

6278361,52209953,2015-10-27,37718425,Janell,"Heather was extremely welcoming and considerate of us as guests. The space was small, but she made it feel large and was very peaceful. we had our own space in the apartment and she also organized getting us the keys since she could not be there to personally welcome us. The welcome letter with the keys, which we picked up, was very detailed and specific. It was everything we needed, and more than we had anticipated"
6278361,52961572,2015-11-03,520671,Kathy,"Heather waited for me to arrive and bring me up to her cute apartment.  The apartment, bed and shared bath were clean and comfortable.  I only saw Heather once but she was available by text if I had any concerns or needs.  The place is in the most amazing area of Seattle - the center of downtown!  If I go back to Seattle I would stay there again!"

6278361,54138212,2015-11-16,46902636,Le,"Firstly I would like to say thank you to Heather for your kindness and hopefully you recieved our 'thank you' card that we left in your table :)
Heather's house is located in a very convenient place near public transport (University street station), just next to Seattle Art Museum and quite close to Pike market (easy and short to walk to the market). So it's an excellent location for us. The place where we slept is a small living room and next to the kitchen but really comfortable. The shared bathroom is also very clean. We only met Heather for short time but she was very nice and helpful to us. Again, I want to say thank Heather for your hot water bottle that you gave me :) I love it actually lol  
So if you want to visit Seattle and need a place to stay near many attractions, Heather's nest is a great option. I strongly recommend it for anyone. "
6278361,54391583,2015-11-19,39223841,Sonia,"Heather is kind and extremely accommodating. She worked with my schedule for when I arrived, and even walked me to the bus station to show me where it was when I needed to get to a dinner. She has great suggestions of what to do downtown. 

Her apartment is nice and clean. The mattress is super comfortable and she has plenty of warm blankets and a heater for when it is cold. 

If you are on a budget, I highly recommend staying here. You can walk to the market, and a bit further, to the city center where the museums and space needle are. She is close to all public transport. "
6278361,55722083,2015-12-05,47071310,Annie,"I had a lovely stay with Heather in her charming, funky building. She made me feel welcome immediately. We didn't hang out much but I felt very comfortable there. She was warm and friendly (and even gave me a hot water bottle for the end of my bed, which was such a sweet gesture). I will definitely look her up again the next time I need a place to stay in Seattle. "
6278361,56684108,2015-12-16,49120844,Carissa,"The space is small but has everything you'll need. She supplies toiletries, slippers, and towels too. Heather was very responsive over messaging and would leave us notes most days. She wasn't around most of our trip so we could have more privacy, which was nice. 

Upon our arrival, she met with us to give us our keys and recommended some places to check out for the rest of the day. The location is very convenient walking distance to many attractions and conveniently located by the bus stop. Overall our stay at Heather's was easy, smooth, and comfortable. Would recommend for budget travelers looking for a good location!"

The apartment is beautiful, the bed is soft. Heather also provide toothbrush and towels! She is an amazing woman, and she gave us many good suggestions! Don't miss her house!"
9091301,52383757,2015-10-28,6251615,Julianne,"My stay with Kathryn and Olivier (and Dixie!) was great. The room was comfortable, clean, and exactly what I needed for a short one-night stay. Kathryn and Olivier were warm, welcoming, and glad to answer any questions I had about the house and area. The location is great. It's close to the main strip of Greenwood area, and close to bus lines that take me downtown. I would recommend this place to anyone who needs a place to stay in Seattle!"
9091301,52950472,2015-11-02,43643990,Soffonias,"The people at the house are kind. The experience was pretty good except for the bedroom had a sliding door without a lock. The room also had a mini dog stench (I'm not a dog person), but was clean. Overall, pretty good. "
9091301,54796378,2015-11-23,15079094,Ian,The room and bathroom were exceptionally clean. Both were a little sparse but had what we needed. Bed is only a full sized but comfortable. Room is on the lower floor which was cold but the room had separate heat which kept the room very cozy. Neighborhood is a bit far walk to coffee or breakfast but it is close to the rapid ride bus straight to downtown. Overall the stay was great and we had a good time. 
9013210,52016898,2015-10-25,3219155,Maria,"This is one of the top AirBnB experiences we've ever had. Richard and Matt have thought of every detail, from the welcome gifts to the well-appointed bathroom to the beautiful interior design of their home. We loved laughing and talking with them and getting to know them, hanging out with the pugs, and sleeping in the super comfortable bed in the guest room. Their home was convenient for us to see family and the city. It was also safe and there was never an issue with parking. Thanks to Richard, Matt, Cowboy, Dora, and Bob the goldfish for a wonderful stay!"
9013210,54449752,2015-11-20,46044047,Calvin,I am glad I picked Richard's place for my five days trip in Seattle. His place is clean/warm and well decorated. Richard also has two friendly dogs that follows me around when I was in the house :). They also allow me to use whatever I need in the kitchen. Would definitely recommend this place.
9013210,54756704,2015-11-23,46044047,Calvin,It was my second visit to Richard's place (Technically same visit as last time). Same good experience :) 
2488228,15373493,2014-07-07,10492476,Rob,One of the best airbnb's I've stayed at. Staying at Johns place felt more like a hotel than a spare bedroom.  John is accommodating and extremely helpful. 
2488228,15518911,2014-07-10,2810494,Lori,"The neighbourhood was great, just a few blocks to coffee shops, bars, restaurants and shops."
2488228,15839726,2014-07-16,3595380,Madeleine,"John was a great host and the space was perfect.  The location is great, and we were able to get all around Seattle. To get to the room, you walk through a shared area, but the room is totally private and John was very friendly. Also, that tub is awesome! My partner and I had a great time, and would definitely recommend!"
2488228,16030202,2014-07-20,12180270,Ian,"John was an excellent host. The room was exactly as shown - perfectly clean, had everything we need, and was nice and private. The bed was large and comfy, and the huge tub in the bathroom was perfect for relaxing after a long day of walking. John was very generous and offered us tea, coffee, and even some of his homebrews! The location of his townhouse is perfect and had easy access to some fantastic cafes, restaurants, and bars. We would definitely stay there again!"
2488228,16264046,2014-07-24,17042840,Casey,"This airbnb far outweighed my expectations! The house and the room were both impeccably clean. The room was very private; it had a shower, bath tub, and walk in closet included in the suite plus there's a washer and dryer in the hall that we had access to. John was very nice and accommodating. He even left out fruit for us and offered up some of his home brew. The location was perfect for us. Capitol Hill is a young, hip area with everything you could ever need. John's place was just a few blocks away from a ton of shops and restaurants. If you're looking to stay in a quite neighborhood near the action definitely pick this spot! "
2488228,16372123,2014-07-26,2070062,Cedric & Lauren,John was accommodating and the place was very nice!
2488228,16493752,2014-07-28,3500418,Sarah,"Our experience with John was great. The space was so meticulously-maintained and the thoughtfulness of John showed in the details--super clean towels and linen; comfortable bed; bright decor. The suite was clean and had a great minimalist feel to it, which was perfect for us. I would definitely recommend that anyone stay with John; Capitol Hill is such a great part of town. Worth all 5 stars. "
2488228,17372183,2014-08-11,18114820,Wes,"John is a wonderful host and the suite is amazing!  It is impeccably clean and the bathroom is very large and well appointed.  The bed was very comfortable.  The location is stellar if you want to be on Capitol Hill and you can walk to great restaurants, bars, and shopping within a few minutes.  We will definitely be back for our next visit to the beautiful city of Seattle!   "
2488228,17846039,2014-08-18,17773178,Harold,"Staying at John's place was fantastic. The location and room itself are both amazing. John is a great host as well, just a really cool guy and very accommodating. An exceptional experience!"
2488228,18013308,2014-08-20,12722386,Sara,"John was extremely welcoming and helpful.  We stayed two nights in the spacious suite (all descriptions are completely accurate) and enjoyed the neighborhood greatly!  We not only walked the nearby Capitol Hill streets, but found it was only a half hour walk to downtown, and felt we had a very expansive experience of the beautiful city of Seattle.  I highly recommend this private, quiet, light-filled space."
2488228,18248752,2014-08-24,17823530,Jeff,"John was great!  Very welcoming upon our arrival.  The accommodations were top notch---  fresh and new, private (we had our own floor within the townhouse with door that locked), bed was comfy and space was nice.   We loved the neighborhood and we walked everywhere even into downtown.     Would stay there again !"
2488228,18548744,2014-08-28,73119,Emily & Matt,"We had a terrific, albeit short, stay at John's. The room totally exceeded our expectations -- so spacious, sunny and immaculately clean! Definitely one of the nicest airbnb's we've stayed at. The private bathroom was such a luxury, with his-and-her sinks, an awesome tub, and pillowy white towels. It actually felt like we were staying at a hotel, except that we had a friendly and helpful host who made sure we were well looked after. John was very understanding when we had to check in late (midnight!) and even left some fresh fruit out for us with a sweet little welcome note. His place is also conveniently located near all the great shops and restaurants in Capitol Hill. We would totally stay here again when we're back in Seattle."
2488228,19032027,2014-09-05,2190685,Ellen,"John was a great host and his place is clean, neat, comfortable and convenient.  We really enjoyed having our own bedroom suite. We were particularly grateful to be able to park in his drive."
2488228,19150768,2014-09-07,277657,Alex,"Excellent place, beautiful and clean.  Host very welcoming and accommodating.  Would stay again"
2488228,19272735,2014-09-09,6380941,Matthew,"To say John is a helpful host is an understatement. From allowing us to check in 4 hours early, letting us do some laundry and his fantastic vegetarian recommendations - and even recommendations for our road trip after we left - staying with John was a pleasure. The room in Johns house is brilliant, very clean and it feels like you are staying in a luxury suite with a great bathroom and comfortable bed. It's a short walk to some great cafés and restaurants and also within walking distance to the sights of Seattle. Thanks John!!"
2488228,19374295,2014-09-11,785597,Mallorie,"Both John and his house were wonderful. He was very on top of communication and getting into the unit was a breeze.  The suite itself was perfect, all of the comforts of a hotel in a tranquil part of town, but still just a few short blocks from all of the action of Capitol Hill.  Coming and going on our own schedule was very easy and we would definitely stay again.  Thanks John!"
2488228,19822257,2014-09-19,2854752,Marquis,"I stayed at John's AirBNB listing for my week long vacation in Seattle.  I couldn't have asked for a better host.  John himself is extremely friendly and full of great recommendations, his place was spotless and well decorated, and the neighborhood (Capitol Hill) is a great place to stay.  Nearby grocery stores, restaurants and coffee shops make it a great central ""hub"" in which to stay.  I can't say enough good things about my experience staying at John's listing.  I look forward to my next trip to Seattle!"
2488228,20012378,2014-09-22,18772684,Giovanni,"John, is a wonderful host! Everything was perfectly laid out and as shown in the description. The room/house was gorgeous and in a fun neighborhood in Seattle."
2488228,20200884,2014-09-25,18354169,Matt,"This was my first AirBnB experience and after staying with John, going to a hotel will be a letdown.  He was in constant communication to make sure I had all the information and resources I needed.  The suite was clean and spacious, and it had all the amenities I could imagine.  A helpful information packet in the suite made everything clear.  He was even flexible with me arriving late due to a work commitment.  My only complaint was that I didn't get to thank him in person because our schedules never lined up.

A note about the location: Capitol Hill is a very cool location - tons of activity, lots of people walking, great cafes, restaurants, and bars, full of trees.  It's a great place to see in Seattle.  Be ready to walk up some hills though!"
2488228,20307917,2014-09-27,20450497,Bradford,John is a great host. Location is well located on Capitol Hill with good eating and shopping near by. Beautiful neighborhood. Very clean and comfortable. 
2488228,20554968,2014-10-01,19174723,Ed,John was friendly and very accommodating and he did make us feel welcome. 
2488228,20697753,2014-10-04,11672605,David,"Super clean, spacious, comfy bed, beautiful, quiet part of town near great Capitol Hill food & culture.  John was friendly & accommodating.  Definitely recommend staying here!"
2488228,20827027,2014-10-06,4607809,Jan,"John is very welcoming and the suite is spacious, clean and light-filled.  I enjoyed my stay here very much and look forward to staying here again."
2488228,21210729,2014-10-13,14658158,Michelle,"We loved the location of John's place, only footsteps away from the hub of Capital Hill yet on a quaint and quiet neighborhood street. John is really easy going and he keeps his place clean and well kept and we felt completely comfortable. We absolutely would want to stay here again. Michelle and Martin"
2488228,21489105,2014-10-18,22298741,Ray,"100% accurate. Host very responsive and accommodating. Great neighborhood. Walk a couple blocks west for many restaurants and shops, walk a couple blocks east (my preference) for many more. A bit of a hike, but I walked everyday to the Pike Market, Seattle Center, REI and downtown. I loved the exercise of walking back up Capitol Hill. "
2488228,22043281,2014-10-28,1925064,Steve,"John was a great host. He's friendly, helpful, and accommodating, and his house is wonderful. The listing and photos are completely accurate, and the suite itself is very good: the bed is real and comfortable, and the bathroom is stellar.

John's place is in a great location in Capitol Hill -- the best neighborhood I encountered in my Seattle adventures. From John's place you can walk 5 minutes east (15th) or west (Broadway) to good coffee and restaurants, or south about 10 minutes to Pike/Pine for more options. It's about a 30 minute walk to downtown/Belltown."
2488228,22112847,2014-10-30,19344966,Karina And Jeff,"John is a fantastic host. He's a super friendly and inviting guy, was very communicative throughout, and his place is even better than pictured. This was a great spot for me to stay during my business trip to Seattle. I would stay here again myself and would recommend to others. "
2488228,22892259,2014-11-17,17558993,Matt,"We were very happy with this space just off of Broadway on Capitol Hill! The 3rd floor suite was spacious, bright, nicely finished and furnished, and had a big bathroom and closet. John was friendly and was very clear in what amenities were made available to guests and what his expectations were, which were exceedingly reasonable. The location is amazing, right within walking distance of anything and everything on the hill, and easy to get around the entire Seattle area on mass transit from here (which is precisely what we did! Just a few minutes to downtown via several frequently-running bus lines.) The queen sized bed was soft without being a back-killer, and the reading nook is a nice touch. John even shared his home-made beer with us, which was very good :)

I'd highly recommend this location to anyone looking to experience Capitol Hill or the Downtown Seattle area. It is significantly more comfortable, more affordable, and more homey than some hotel."
2488228,23188472,2014-11-24,22966561,Sarena,"Our stay at John's place was very comfortable and just as described. The suite was private and  clean, plus the location was in easy walking distance to Pike and Pine St. I would definitely stay here again. "
2488228,23718032,2014-12-08,376637,Flora,"I had a wonderful weekend stay at John's. The guest suite is large, clean, private and quiet. The neighbourhood is lovely and within walking distance of downtown, the Public Market, museums and even the space needle. John is a gracious and very accommodating host (I needed to check in early and then leave at 4am). Highly recommended."
2488228,23967483,2014-12-15,5054322,Alexey,We enjoyed our stay at John's place. The location on the Capitol Hill is unbeatable. John is a wonderful host and made us feel at home. Would come back again next time.
2488228,24064673,2014-12-18,22020573,Xiqin,It's an amazing experience in Seattle. John is really nice and the room is prefect. It's large and clean. I think it's comfortable to live. Both my friend and I love it so much. 
2488228,24255457,2014-12-23,21154950,Nimrod,"Thank you again for a the mazing hospitality.
The house was clean and very homey
we both enjoyed our time there. 

I would like to highly recommended the place and the location.


thank you John

2488228,24526766,2014-12-30,6241556,Emily,"This place was great! The room was private and comfortable, with a big bathtub perfect for cold nights. We also had access to tea and coffee, which was really nice! John was also very personable, and helped us tourists with finding out way around. Overall, a great experience."
2488228,24882749,2015-01-03,3175051,Naynika,"Nice, cozy and private suite in Capitol Hill walking distance from the restaurants on Broadway and a $7-10 Lyft ride from downtown. John was a great host, very respectful and quiet, and we enjoyed meeting him. The suite was private with a cozy reading nook and an excellent, large and very clean bathroom. John offered us some of his home-brewed IPA, which we enjoyed. If you're staying in Capitol Hill, this is a great launch pad. 
One thing to note - parking in this area is scarce without a permit, so make arrangements prior to arriving. "
2488228,25109417,2015-01-06,25116514,Aditya,"This was my first Air BnB experience and I must say the expectations have been set real high. The place is better than what it looks like in the pictures. Really clean and comfy. Extra linens, towels etc....everything that one needs. Moreover very close to downtown. Wandering Goose is the place to get a heavy breakfast nearby. 

John is one of the most interesting people I have met and indeed a great host. A lot of great suggestions from him and very very genuine.

This is the place to stay if you want to be in Seattle and and want to be near to the happening places in the city."
2488228,25206793,2015-01-09,3741681,Daniel,John is a great host. The townhouse is in a vibrant neighborhood and close to downtown. The suite was clean and cozy. 
2488228,25504273,2015-01-18,731115,Tyler,"This was a great week-long stay for my wife and I. The pictures and description for this private room can't quite capture how spacious and cozy it actually is (the bathtub is huge!) John was a great host: gave us great advice on restaurants and bars to try, offered a few weeks worth of clean bedding and towels, and he even offered some of his delicious home-brewed IPA for us to sample. 

The location is great. It's a nice walk to downtown, but if you weren't interested in walking then nearby there is the #8 bus to center Seattle and the #43 to downtown. Within a few minutes walk from John's place you can get to a QFC, dozens of restaurants, bars, and cafes...I even needed to randomly access a T-Mobile store, a FedEx shipping center, and an Office Max and his location happened to be just a 5 minute walk from each. 

Great Host, Great Room, Great Location."
2488228,25655511,2015-01-22,20108514,Nate,"John is a great host and very welcoming. The place is very clean, very organized, comfortable and spacious. John repects your privacy but is also very willing to help and offer advice and what to do in Seattle. The neighbor is quiet and close to public transportation that provides easy access to the city center. We enjoyed our stay and highly recommend this place!"
2488228,25730905,2015-01-24,4145776,Sarah,"John was a great host, easy to contact and quick to respond to any queries. He was friendly and made us feel very welcome in his home. The room and ensuite were great - immaculate and exactly as described. The place is in a residential street so it's quiet when you want to sleep but at the same time you are only footsteps away to transport, restaurants and shopping. I would recommend this place and would definitely stay there again!"
2488228,25815225,2015-01-26,22661237,Carol,We enjoyed our stay at John's house. John welcomed us and showed us around. The room where we stayed was very inviting and clean. The bed was very comfortable and there was a large private bathroom for us. We would definitely stay here again.

2488228,26685379,2015-02-17,24919515,Wendy,"John was such a great host, and the space was so comfortable! We started most of our days with a soak in the fantastic oversized tub, and it was wonderful to be able to crawl into such a comfortable bed when we finished wandering the city for the day. 
I will definitely stay there again next time I'm in Seattle "
2488228,27046011,2015-02-24,18194124,Aimee,"John's house in Capitol Hill is absolutely beautiful. Inviting, warm, and friendly, the place is a perfect sanctuary to unwind after a long day of exploring. Just a few blocks away, bars and restaurants fill the streets making for a fun Friday or Saturday night.

Very much enjoyed our stay and can't wait to come back! "
2488228,27347204,2015-03-02,19615577,Ana,"My stay at John's place was great. His place is conveniently located close to many shops, restaurants and buses, in one of the most vibrant parts of town.

Conveniently located in Capitol Hill, the home is quiet and private.  The big bath tub is a perk after a long day of running around.  I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again.  "
2488228,28479026,2015-03-24,4226906,Connie,"Really fantastic room in a great location. Very quiet but also close to central streets in cap hill. The room was extremely clean and comfortable.

2488228,28663147,2015-03-28,26389025,Theresa,"I could not recommend John more! He was a very gracious, attentive host. Being new to airbnb I was very much hoping my experience would exceed that of a typical hotel, and it did by far. John's house was absolutely gorgeous, comfortable, in a great location and had many amenities ( including laundry!). Staying here definitely enriched my visit to town due to the atmosphere which was provided by such an excellent host! I would definitely stay here again if I was in the area!"
2488228,28788371,2015-03-30,5941019,Kim,"John was warm, welcoming and accommodating - everything you want in a host! The location is ideal - a few blocks off of the busy Broadway corridor for easy access to Vivace Coffee (and more!) but very quiet and neighborhood-like. The suite itself was quite large and clean and comfortable. We had a very late flight the day we checked out, but John allowed us to store our bags during the day, which was much appreciated. I would definitely stay again!"

This was our very first AirBNB experience, and John was an excellent host who anticipated our needs. We arrived in the middle of the night, and he made sure everything was clear and easy for us. His home is clean, comfortable and very accessible for visiting the city. We would definitely stay with John again!"
2488228,29858583,2015-04-13,2763707,Julie,"John's place was just as listed. The location is great, and the layout of his condo makes it very easy to have your own space while there. The bed was comfortable (sometimes a problem for me) and John was very easy to communicate with before arriving. "

It is also very central with easy access to city center and 12th ave, a pleasure to explore for diverse cuisine. I enjoyed every moment of being there. "
2488228,32469215,2015-05-18,14558902,Hank,"John was very accomodating and clear about the arrival protocols and gaining access to the house.

2488228,34352894,2015-06-07,34282783,Robert,"With impressive attention to detail,  John provided a wonderful setting for my son and me as we visited Seattle for four nights. The apartment is a well provisioned two- floor spotless space with one full bathroom with a separate soaking tub and a shower as well as a commode on the other floor. It was great to come back to and relax. My bed was very comfortable and I'm a stickler on that issue.  The lovely neighborhood is 2 blocks from the thriving Broadway area of Capitol Hill.  John had some welcoming fruit  and proudly offered his own bottled brew!  He replenished the Keurig daily and otherwise made himself sparse.  I'd definitely go back and stay there. Very positive!"
2488228,34947572,2015-06-14,30343418,Henriette,John's place was perfect for our trip to Seattle. The neighborhood was quiet but close to the more vibrant parts of Capitol Hill. John was a great host and made us feel welcomed. We will definitely consider coming back for our next visit.
2488228,35567643,2015-06-20,27055911,Malu,"Fue excelente. 
Casa impecable de limpia 
Y el anfitrión excelente
Estuvimos felices
De volver a Seatle regresaríamos con John"
2488228,35824351,2015-06-22,34013601,Steven,"John made sure that we understood directions to his home, and the customary behavior in his place (shoes off, reasonable quiet, etc.) He made sure we were comfortable, arranged for his brother to meet us (John was away for his birthday). We were provided with fruit, little notes of welcome, a feeling of serenity and privacy.

 His guest suite is beautifully appointed, spacious, light and airy.  The neighborhood is quiet, tree lined, tons of gardens and interesting homes nearby. It is about three blocks off Broadway, many great eateries, vibrant night life, easy access to public transit.

He even provided us with a parking spot for $10 a night, a crucial amenity.

 We felt very well treated, and could not have been happier with John's hosting and his place."
2488228,36179453,2015-06-26,31422073,John,"Access and directions were clear and concise. The suite was ready on time, clean and inviting. Complementary fruit, teas, coffee and homemade beer was available each day! Loved the modern bathroom with spacious tub."
2488228,36568341,2015-06-29,34835353,Patrick,"I had an amazing time in Seattle, and a lot of that has to do with the comfort, cleanliness, and location of John's place.  I was initially concerned by the lack of air conditioning, because the hottest June on record coincided with my stay, but my room stayed cool with open windows and fans.  I was able to walk all over town for everything--restaurants, shopping, USPS, you name it.  John is a great host and very accommodating.  I would definitely return!"
2488228,37464628,2015-07-07,26590736,Joanne,"John was very nice.  He greeted us upon arrival, helped us with our bags and made us feel very welcome.  His place is on a tree lined street within walking distance of restaurants and a bus that will take you into the city center within minutes."
2488228,37883101,2015-07-11,33197991,Tara,"John was a fantastic host, and his place in Capitol Hill was an ideal location for walking to great restaurants. We really appreciated how clear John was in all his communications with us. He gave us great advice on restaurants and made us feel very welcome in his home--even let us try his (wonderful) home brewed beer. You couldn't find a better host or place for your stay in Seattle! "
2488228,38127538,2015-07-13,9797118,Elaine,"What a great airbnb experience. John was on hand to greet us. The room is very large, clean and comfortable. Lots of light. Big bathroom with tub. Lots of storage. The house is quiet.  The street is great. The neighborhood is full of restaurants. Vivace coffee is right around the corner on Broadway. John is a delightful person. We would not hesitate to rent from him again."
2488228,38763299,2015-07-18,34326101,Jingming,"Great experience!  Spacious, clean, and quite suite, with a large private bathroom.  Nice furniture and very comfortable bed.  Friendly host.  Convenient location with a lot of good restaurants nearby. "
2488228,39197135,2015-07-21,7661003,Matt,"We had very pleasant 3 night stay.  John is a stellar airbnb host, friendly and communicative, and has really thought of everything in terms of making his guests feel welcome and comfortable.  The room is clean, spacious and quiet as advertised.  Location is a tree-lined residential block with easy walking access to the commercial areas of Capitol Hill and buses to elsewhere.  We parked our car on the street without a problem - we just had to pay close attention to the permit-only signs.  We would definitely return."
2488228,39553852,2015-07-24,38127530,John,"I was a first time AirBnB user and John was the perfect person to have as my first host, he was terrific! I found his place to be exactly as it was described and photographed and  I was perfectly happy to not have a car because his place was so convenient to my activities.  He was most helpful in every way and while our visits were brief i found that we shared similar interests particularly the appreciation of a clean home and healthy cooking for ourselves and others.  He was also helpful in assisting me in gaining a better understanding of the Airbnb sharing system.  I would happily stay with John again and hope he will do the same with me one day.  "
2488228,40095388,2015-07-28,33665546,Scott,"In advance of our visit, our host John communicated with us on several occasions to offer important details ranging from the most economical means of ground transportation to codes for entry and exit. He was very responsive to all of our questions.

Before we arrived, John left fresh organic fruit out for us in a bowl; by the second day, he had made delicious scones that he again left on the counter. There was an umbrella -- always helpful in Seattle -- and plenty of bedding. We enjoyed meeting and chatting with John, en route up and down the stairs from sightseeing.

The master suite in which we stayed was spacious and well-lit, the bed was very comfortable, and there was plenty of seating that included a desk area. The door between the suite and the staircase locks from inside the suite. Sound does travel between the main living floor on the 2nd level, the guest suite on the 3rd level, and the owner's suite on the 4th level -- one hears speaking and walking, but not individual words.

We highly recommend this accommodation."
2488228,40595071,2015-08-01,15493474,Beth,This was a comfortable and clean space. Most everything was in walking distance and we felt welcome and safe. 
2488228,40963571,2015-08-03,37931708,Sarah,"John was a great host and the guest suite was very nice. It was clean, quiet, and spacious, and he provided wifi, iron, shampoo etc. The neighborhood is walkable and friendly.  We were also grateful for the option to park on the driveway. Thank you for a wonderful stay!"
2488228,41599999,2015-08-08,33945099,Gabriela,"John was a great host since the moment I arrived to his house, he is a very nice and kind person. He had everyday fruit and coffee to share with me.
His house is so beautiful, clean and silent. My suite was better than the photos. 
I walked everyday to downtown and all diferent neighborhoods, I love to walk but if you dont there is a lot of choices of transportation a few blocks away. Great neighborhood full of life. 
Thank you John for everything. "
2488228,41956886,2015-08-10,33404770,Jean And Don,"Our host communicated with us about location, directions and time of arrival.  He was most helpful with our luggage to the room.  The entire bnb was very very clean and neat.  The bedroom and bath  were most spacious.  The description was most accurate.  We thoroughly enjoyed our stay."
2488228,42525956,2015-08-14,7633602,Joshua,John was a tubular host. The place is just as pictured and described.  Very chill location with easy access to the city.  No parking issues for us. Definitely would recommend to a homie.
2488228,43267330,2015-08-18,24554283,Ralph,"We very much enjoyed staying with John. The place is very spacious, clean and gives you a lot of privacy. It is very close to Broadway where you'll find some cool bars, restaurants and shops. Downtown is also within walking distance. John welcomed us warmly and gave us very useful tips about the must dos in Seattle. We could leave our rental car at his place which was extremely convenient - thanks!
Stay with John, and you'll have a great time!"
2488228,43824540,2015-08-22,28529767,Oliver,"John was very easy to get a hold of, accommodating, and friendly. The space was very nice, private, and comfortable. We felt at home and loved the neighborhood - it was great being walking distance to all of the fun things to do in Capitol Hill. "
2488228,44433984,2015-08-26,2318839,Jonas,"Lovely, clean and spacious room in a great location near to restaurants and bars. Easy commute to downtown Seattle and other Seattle areas. John was friendly and nice and made us feel welcome. We would definitely recommend this place to friend and family."
2488228,45268319,2015-09-01,36084151,Ronan,"Incredible host! He was more than accommodating and friendly beyond compare. This was my first time using airbnb and anytime I'm staying in Seattle, it will be here. Absolutely perfect host."
2488228,46137548,2015-09-08,37632931,Peter,John gave us excellent instructions for our arrival late in the evening.  Complimentary fruit was waiting for us on the calendar and available throughout our stay.  There were numerous brochures in the suite to help with touring Seattle.
2488228,46771824,2015-09-13,32399829,Maureen,John was a welcoming and friendly host. The accommodation was spacious & spotless. Handy for buses downtown or to walk. Thanks for a lovely stay John.
2488228,47302542,2015-09-17,42607246,Joe,My wife and I had a great experience. It was our first time using airbnb and we will do it again. John was there to welcome us to his house. He had been cooking so it smelled great. His house was spotless and cozy. His house is in a good location. We were able to bike/walk all over the city. We spent a lot of time around Pike's market as it was our first Seattle visit. 
2488228,48029585,2015-09-22,43677263,Roland,"Let's start with the basics.  
Gracious host -- YES
Accommodations -- Perfect!

My wife and I had a great experience staying with John in Seattle.  It was our first ""airbnb"" experience and sure not to be our last.  The accommodations were more than roomy enough for a long weekend and they were obviously well maintained and welcoming.  Access to the building was easy and straightforward.

The location was only a few blocks away from restaurants, public transportation, and nightlife all nestled on a fairly quiet side street.      "
2488228,48242507,2015-09-24,3588570,Maria,"Amazing host!!! He is very accommodating host and very friendly, definitely one of the best airbnb hosts. His place is spacious, clean, and quite. It's located in an amazing area. We had an amazing time in Seattle and next time time I'll visit Seattle I will definitely stay again at his place.  I would highly recommend John to any future Airbnb host.
Thanks for the great experience. "
2488228,48716227,2015-09-28,3417471,Alisa,"John is a very accommodating host. He made it easy to add another guest to the reservation right before my trip and made a point to communicate with me about check in and arrival so he could be there to greet me. He also offered to allow my friend to leave her bags at his place before her flight out so she could enjoy Seattle bag free. It was my first time staying in a place with a host present, which may not be for everyone. It's more like being a houseguest--somewhat more restrictive than being on my own, but still a pleasant experience. Not a big deal, but for example, I would've done laundry when I got home from my friends wedding so I could pack clean clothes for the next leg of my trip, but I worried it would make too much noise. Even so, John is a friendly host, and he's got a great space in a great location!"
2488228,49052065,2015-09-30,44312000,Lisbeth,This was our first time using Airbnb and we are very happy with the choice we made.  John was very welcoming and made us feel comfortable in his lovely home while also being non intrusive.  We had a whole level to ourselves.  It was spotless and tastefully furnished.  John also had coffee and tea (all sorts) on offer and a bowl of fruit we could help ourselves too if we wanted.  The apartment is in a lovely area of Seattle and we were able to walk everywhere from there. We would highly recommend John as a host and the accommodation he offers.
2488228,50455325,2015-10-12,29160317,Jan Glad,"This was our first stay at an AirBnB and it surpassed our expectations as John is such a great host.  John is great with clear and good communication and he is very responsive and thorough. The suite we rented was very private and we had an entire floor for ourselves. The place is fantastic and in a great location with virtually everything in walking distance. We spent most of our time in the Capitol Hill area however downtown is just a short taxi ride or a 20 minute walk away. The  Capitol Hill area is incredible with lots of different kinds of restaurants, great bars and beautiful parks nearby. We recommend John and his place highly."
2488228,51212849,2015-10-18,37746727,Liz,"John was very accommodating and has a lovely home. I enjoyed my stay and would choose this location for future stays in a heartbeat. Location, location,location!"
2488228,51889503,2015-10-25,38054822,Seuljee,It was the most restful and private place I have ever stayed in. The whole house was spotlessly clean and neat. I thoroughly enjoyed the cozy space in the wall. The location is easy to commute to any part of Seattle. John is a very accommodating host and I would definitely stay with him again.
2488228,52360203,2015-10-28,3741681,Daniel,"This is the second time I stayed at John's Capitol Hill suite.  I would definitely recommend staying at John's.

John clearly takes great pride in his efforts to provide a place for guests to stay.  Communication with John is very easy, the room is exceptionally clean, and checking in and out is effortless.  

John's place is in a vibrant Seattle neighborhood close to downtown.  There are many great restaurants, bars, and grocery stores within walking distance.  

You will not be disappointed if you stay here."
2488228,52847917,2015-11-02,6689604,Daniel,"John's apartment is beautiful and the suite is cosy and quiet. It is perfectly private, clean, spacious and thoughtfully appointed. The area is safe, leafy, just so lovely. And John is terrific, a great guy, he has everything under control and is helpful, considerate, and easy to get in touch with. I stayed Downtown earlier in the year and much prefer being on Capitol Hill, I'd definitely stay here again."
2488228,53472747,2015-11-09,5761589,Terrie,"I had an excellent stay at John's home on Capitol Hill.

Communication and information exchange was easy before I arrived. John greeted me at the door and led me upstairs for a tour of his home pointing out where coffee and tea were, a bowl of fruit, filtered water, and cutlery should I need it. He led me up to the guest ""quarters"" which was to be my personal floor in his townhouse. 

It was more spacious than my own home with a large sleeping area with a table and chairs, reading nook, small couch, and good lighting. There was a walk in closet and a spaciaous, clean bathroom with a separate shower and tub as well as two sinks. While I didn't need or use most of the amenities, it was lovely to have them available. 

The bed and pillows were really comfortable. I even asked John where he got the mattress. There were plenty of towels and the shower had shampoo and body wash. There was a hair dryer too. Next visit I'll pack lighter.

The programable lock made coming and going easy. I left my boots at the door as requested. The townhouse is carpted and John provides slippers should you need them. It was all very cozy. 

The location is great as it is in between the shops/grocery stores/bars/restaurants on both Broadway and 15th Ave. There are some beautiful mansions along the way to Volunteer Park or you can walk over to the action on Pike and Pine leading into downtown. I walked and ate and ate and walked and stopped for coffee everywhere. Should you forget your umbrella, John has a spare in the walk in closet.

While I didn't see much of John since I was out enjoying Capitol Hill or doing some work in my room, he was extremely nice whenever we spoke. I felt completely comfortable staying alone there. His home is spotless,  and he obviously takes great pride in being an exemplary Airbnb Host.

I had a great experience staying at John's home."
2488228,53914135,2015-11-14,47864297,Curtis,"John and his suite in Capitol Hill is as advertised and reviewed. I stayed with John for five days and had a great experience. The suite is clean, quiet, and comfy. I slept well through each night. Bonus points for the soaking tub and awesome coffee/tea selections; nice way to start and end each day. Electronic entry and exit made it easy to come and go without keys. Location is perfect too right near the bars and restaurants. I looked forward to the end of my day when I could go back and explore neighborhood. I would stay with John again without hesitation. Thanks for a great experience John. "
2488228,54270540,2015-11-17,45870471,Colette,"It is my greatest Airbnb experience ever. John is a nice and considerate host. The room is super tidy and clean, and there is also a warm and bright kitchen in the house. Also, the house is located near downtown Seattle, so it is great for those with traveling plan."
2488228,54762961,2015-11-23,1925064,Steve,"This is the second time I've stayed at John's place, and it was as great as the first! John is friendly, helpful, and accommodating, and his house is wonderful. The listing and photos are completely accurate, and the suite itself is very good: the bed is real and comfortable, and the bathroom is stellar. John's place is in a great location in Capitol Hill -- one of the best neighborhood I encountered in my Seattle adventures. From John's place you can walk 5 minutes east (15th) or west (Broadway) to good coffee and restaurants, or south about 10 minutes to Pike/Pine for more options.
"
2488228,55565430,2015-12-02,2265689,Ryan,"John was an exceptional host: flexible about check-in and check-out times, well organized, and hospitable. John is a skilled microbrewer, and was kind enough to share a fresh batch of deliciously hoppy porter with us!

The suite itself is lovely: a stone’s throw from all the wonderful coffee shops, bars, bookstores, and restaurants on Capitol Hill. John kept the suite well-heated on an unusually chilly weekend.

If you stay here, you should definitely take advantage of the jetted soaking tub in the suite. Nothing like a long soak after a day of wandering around Seattle!"
2488228,56128993,2015-12-09,14340176,Ian,"I had such a positive experience staying in the Suite in Capital Hill Townhouse. John was a great host who gave helpful tips, shared his own delicious home-brew, and made me feel right at home. The space is large, very well kept, and honestly is even nicer in person than in the (already impressive) photos. You'll enjoy your stay here without doubt. "
2488228,56503069,2015-12-14,48335422,Georgie,"John place was great.  Very much as described.  Super duper clean and tidy.  Quiet in a nice neighborhood quick walking access to Capital Hill fun stuff.  Would definitely stay their again.  Thanks John! And Merry Christmas!
"
2488228,56877929,2015-12-19,49866451,Laura,"I felt incredibly welcomed by John! What a wonderful airbnb experience. The suite is beautiful and better than any hotel I've ever stayed at. He really anticipated any need I may have had, from an iron to a hair dryer. The room had it all! I would highly recommend this suite to others. The bed was also one of the most comfortable beds I've slept on!"
2488228,57254960,2015-12-23,9523191,Jennifer,"It was a true pleasure to be a guest in John's place.  He is a complete joy to meet, very efficient and easy to communicate with. With careful instructions and a personal introduction upon arrival, it was very easy to feel right at home in his beautiful, spacious, clean and quiet home.  I felt restored and rejuvenated as a result of deep sleep and quick walkable neighborhood access to the best coffee I have yet tasted and an awesome selection of unique restaurants.  I hope to come back and stay again."
7805332,44035861,2015-08-23,2527683,Cory,"Sam and Lish have a lovely home and go out of their way to be helpful and friendly. A buddy and I went to a couple bars and restaurants they recommended, which really helped for our first time in Seattle. Would love to stay with them again. 

The space is pretty big -- a full studio, and the kitchen is a nice touch. The people are also great. Sam and Lish made Seattle a welcoming place. "
7805332,45414549,2015-09-02,9877433,David,"Quiet  and spacious studio apartment. Sam was very communicative and helpful during my whole stay. The neighborhood is beautiful; easy to reach madison park for relaxing wanderings, capitol hill, etc. Recommended!"
7805332,46920891,2015-09-14,29186375,Ioannis,"Sam and Lish were great hosts! They kept the flat nice and clean and made sure everything was in order and comfortable for us. Whenever we had a question/query they would answer very promptly. They provided us with useful info and a very nice restaurant list too :) They are super friendly and we enjoyed their company over dinner at a nearby restaurant!

The neighbourhood is nice and quiet, very close to bus lines that connect to Capitol Hill, Downtown and U-District. The flat is indeed very cosy, and comes with everything included: WiFi connection, TV, fully-equipped kitchen and laundry facilities. We definitely recommend it! 
"
7805332,47235966,2015-09-16,44052748,Mariah,"Convenience. Privacy. Space. Sam and Lish have a great place in a quiet neighborhood in a hilly area of Seattle. It's not too far from downtown but also close to the arboretum, university, the Husky stadium and Seattle Children's Hospital, which is ideal for families visiting students, attending games or getting checkups. We had the downstairs all to ourselves with private entrance and fenced off patio area. A downstairs apt can seem dank, but this one has plenty of windows and Sam and Lish have it painted brightly, with both ceiling and lamp lighting. We had plenty of space to unwind, with a comfy bed, couch, work desk, rocking chair and reading nook. The kitchen and laundry room provided extra convenience. It is an older home, so you may notice creaking floors and voices above, but this is probably typical of any airbnb where you share space in one home. I appreciated the coffee and hot water percolator too! Most welcome was a list of favorite dining places in the area. Finally, I would say that Sam and Lish were really accommodating as we could not confirm our rental until late on the day of arrival and they were flexible and understanding. "
7805332,48230725,2015-09-24,44199837,Todd,I arranged for my elderly mother to stay in Sam and Lish's cozy studio while her husband was recovering at Harbourview Medical Center.  Sam was extremely accommodating.  He coordinated closely with me (I live in Portland) and made sure that he was available to cary her bags and made sure she had everything she needed.   It was very reassuring to have Sam upstairs.  My mother said she was very comfortable (bed was great!) and the location was convent to capital hill and the hospital.
7805332,48723826,2015-09-28,1525617,Jessica,"Sam and Lish were fantastic hosts. They had an easy and flexible check-in and out process. The place was clean and they left us a sheet full of great recommendations for parks and food in Seattle. They were also very responsive when I had questions. Overall a great experience, thanks!"
7805332,49343732,2015-10-03,23218213,Jamie,"Sam and Lish are awesome! Though we never met in person, they kept us up to date and were extremely helpful with filling us in on fun things to do in Seattle. Highly recommend their space, cozy and comfy, lots of room, and even have a retro video game clone system to play Nintendo and Super Nintendo games on. I'm (not) sorry if that makes a place enjoyable for me, but I can't help appreciating the little things!"
7805332,49914833,2015-10-07,2961347,Dawn,"Place was even better than described.  Very clean, cute neighborhood, spacious and easy access.  PERFECT!"
7805332,50663889,2015-10-13,19392725,Jaclyn,This place was perfect! The studio has absolutely everything you need. It was super clean and a greats location. There are several yummy restaurants in walking distance and many more just a quick uber ride away. We really enjoyed our stay and hope to be back soon! Highly recommend!!
7805332,51440622,2015-10-20,8531103,Robert,"Our stay at Sam and Lish's studio was perfect.  Although we did not meet our hosts (we were only in the studio in the evenings) the instructions and tips they left were quite helpful.  The only way in which the studio feels like a basement residence is the somewhat low ceiling.  It is mostly above ground with windows providing plenty of light.  The room is quite large, the bed comfortable, with all the necessary amenities."
7805332,52236470,2015-10-27,5402058,Patty,"Corresponding with Sam and Lish was easy. About a week before our arrival date they texted us instructions to gaining access to their apt, and they were spot on. We appreciated their place being ready on 10/23/15 before standard check-in time as we were tired and jet lagged. We stayed there 4 nights and were in Seattle visiting my son. One of them always got back to us within several minutes with answers to our questions. 
The apartment is one large carpetted room with a bathroom, and a tile floored kitchen. We also had access to their washer and dryer which was a big plus. We met Sam the evening before we were leaving. He was friendly and took our suggestions of getting the microwave and toaster fixed really well. He was genuinely interested in making the place comfy and practical for guests.(Fabulous knife set!)  The queen size bed was very comfortable and the sheets were new and soft. Even tho it is a basement, it has plenty of windows and recessed lighting. The space heater worked really well and the eating area was easily big enough for three people. The gas stove was awesome- wish we had one where we live!
Sam and Lish’s place is in a quiet residential area near Lake Washington.  I chose a street level place so we wouldn’t have to walk up a bunch of stairs and a place that was close to my son’s bachelor pad. My husband has health issues that limit his strength and endurance. We wouldn’t recommend this place’s location for another couple like us because we didn’t have a car and it was a 10 minute walk to a bus line and several restaurants, which by the way, were varied in price, type of food and atmosphere. My favorite was a bakery that also did lunches for any hungry visitor:-). I thought we’d be able to walk farther than we did; I just didn’t realize how taxing walking would be for both of us. (We live in a very flat city so it is probably a shorter walk for younger people) 
On the other hand, the huge TV was fabulous, and there were many books provided so the day it rained we were very content to chill and drink this really good herbal tea they provided for their guests. Sam said he would leave more detailed TV remote control instructions, but again, we are not very tech savvy."
7805332,52416480,2015-10-29,21732606,Becca,A great apartment - we could have stayed for a week! Spacious and cosy with everything you could want. Easily accessible and spotlessly clean with fluffy towels and a comfy bed. It was nice to have shampoo and conditioner laid on and we enjoyed watching a movie on the sofa after a long day exploring Seattle. Thanks for having us!
7805332,52717740,2015-11-01,24009537,Cat,The studio was amazing! Very quaint and clean. I would stay here again next time I visit Seattle!
2332949,13078703,2014-05-19,13615682,Ratika,"Dan and Natalia were really great hosts! Very communicative leading up to our stay and also during our stay which we all appreciated. They left us very clear house instructions and guidelines. The house was super clean and inviting. The kitchen was definitely our favorite part! So fun to cook in. We had a girls weekend at their house and it comfortably slept all eight of us.

The listing was exactly as we expected it to be. Spacious and comfortable. Neighborhood was very walkable, close to bus lines.

Overall we had a great time there. Thanks!"
2332949,14277195,2014-06-16,6017127,Krista,"We booked  Dan and Natalia's home for a  college graduation gathering of family from around the country and had a very positive experience.   First, the home's north Capital Hill location was perfect- so close to both the U of W and downtown attractions.  2nd the kitchen was newly renovated and great to cook in, despite our needing Dan's over the phone help to figure out how certain appliances worked, like the faucet!  3rd, there was enough space to sleep 7 and have a separate living and dining room for gathering.  We had some trouble getting all the instructions from Dan at first, but once obtained, all went very well.  Thank you Dan and Natalia"
2332949,14955197,2014-06-30,13750238,Andrea,We booked Dan and Natalia's house for a girls weekend and it was great! It perfectly accommodated all 8 of us and having 3 bathrooms/showers was wonderful as we all know how long girls take to get ready! haha. The place was very clean and the location was excellent. (about a $10-15 cab ride to down town). The park near by was only about a 5 min walk as well. We had some issues with the wifi when we arrived but Dan helped us out right away and got it all sorted out (he was even out of the country!) Thank you so much for letting us stay in your beautiful home! 
2332949,15470739,2014-07-09,11658401,Veronica,"This house was beautiful and in an excellent location.  The hosts were quick to answer any questions. The home has plenty of room for an entire family (there were 6 of us).  Everything was clean and the kitchen was a great joy to cook in.  The keyless door lock was a little finicky and locked us out several times, but after speaking with Dan about some tricks, we never had another issue. The home does not have air conditioning, which normally would not be an issue in seattle, but it just so happened that they were experiencing a heat wave at that time, so the house was a little on the warm side, at least upstairs.  The downstairs was nice and cool.  I would love to stay in this home again if I ever get back to seattle.  "
2332949,17554298,2014-08-14,14317892,Cindy,"This house is well stocked and large. It housed our 8 guests with plenty of room left to wander the house. It's conveniently located in between University District and Downtown, right next to the freeway. Dan was an amazing host, always available to answer any questions. The TVs in this house are large! Great for watching movies with the family. State of the art kitchen appliances. Accommodates families with kids, having a crib and a playroom available.  The neighbors are sweet people, and the neighborhood feels very safe. I would definitely stay here again."
2332949,17820738,2014-08-18,13644420,Allen,"We had a great experience at this house for 3 days over a weekend.  The house is close to the east side of Lake Union, and is in a nice neighborhood.  It is situated with easy access to Interstate 5, so with a car trips are fairly quick going both north and south.  I was worried that there would be a lot of noise from the interstate and busy road right out front, but the house was very quiet.  
The hosts were nice, and when something changed with their plans two weeks before our stay, they still made sure we had a place to stay.  The directions for the house are clear and concise. The house is sparsely decorated, but that worked fine for us. The kitchen and master bedroom and bathroom are really nice. "
2332949,21549254,2014-10-19,5799437,Jessica,"We came to Seattle to celebrate my birthday, and we couldn't have picked a better home. It fit all 8 of us very comfortably, and it was in close proximity to the downtown area. Beautifully decorated and welcoming. It felt like a home away from home. Dan was great to communicate with whenever we had any questions, and he had great tips on where to go around town."
2332949,22656655,2014-11-11,22219297,Dan,"The house was everything we were looking for. Slept 8 of us fine, more than enough space for eating/hanging out. Dan and Natalia were great with any questions we had leading up to the trip and were easy to contact there with a few questions we had. 

House location was a quick Uber ride anywhere we wanted to go, usually about $8 which isn't bad at all. Not a ton in the area in terms of bars and whatnot, but we knew that going into it and having some quiet after a full day of walking around/going out was definitely a big plus. "
2332949,23109472,2014-11-23,13263254,Jesse,"Hosts were very helpful, hospitable, and organized! All details were easily accessible on DropBox and the home was even setup with a welcome basket, which was a thoughtful touch. 

We were visiting Seattle with a larger group and the home accommodated 8 of us well. The kitchen was spacious and very well laid out for our group meals. Beds were comfortable and bathrooms were very nice. 

Location was perfect for our visit - just a 5-minute cab ride to downtown, Capitol Hill, and University of Washington. "
2332949,23297080,2014-11-28,2465479,Lauren,"This was the perfect house for our needs. We live in the area but needed a bigger place to celebrate Thanksgiving with out of town family. The house was clean and well stocked. Kitchen is fantastic, and lots of space. We loved the beds. Dan was great with communication, flexible with check in times and there was a welcome basket waiting for us. I appreciated the full instructions sent to us to help with those little questions, like how to work the shower. (Which is to note that the master bath is FANTASTIC.) Location is great, close to I-5 for quick travel, 5 min to downtown. There is some traffic noise but I found it to be a soothing white noise. Neighborhood was adorable, parks and playgrounds nearby for the kids.  We will definitely keep this house in mind for future similar needs. "
2332949,24591286,2014-12-31,8925166,Stacy,"Dan and Natalia's house was great for a home base during our holiday visit to Seattle. Conveniently located for all of our sightseeing, great kitchen/dining room for meals in, dedicated parking in the back. We needed a fifth sleeping spot, so we put one of the kids on the living room couch. If we had been paying attention, we would have brought a sleeping bag. A few details were different than earlier comments and instructions, and we ran into a couple of issues (ahh, the joys of home ownership), but Dan was readily available to help even though he was out of town. Super clean, and three full baths was a definite plus for five adults and two teenagers. We'd be happy to stay there again. "
2332949,24677474,2015-01-01,10491471,Shawn,My group and I had a wonderful experience at your gorgeous home. Very pleased with the space and amenities. Will be referring others to this place and look forward to renting again. 
2332949,25429802,2015-01-15,11518878,Doug,"Dan and Natalia were wonderful hosts.  We had a last minute trip to Seattle so we booked the house the same day as we were checking in.  Dan was super responsive and made sure that we had everything we needed on short notice.  The house itself was super clean, comfortable and had a bunch of very nice amenities.  I would gladly stay here on all my trips to Seattle!"
2332949,25434712,2015-01-16,89267,Sasha,"January 2015 our family stayed at Dan and Natasha’s beautiful house, but for only for one night, as we were traveling to Leavenworth via Seattle on the way to our son’s wedding. 
There were 7 of us in our group plus a small baby-girl. Prior to our arrival I contacted Dan with the question about a crib. At the time there was no crib at the house, but Dan went out of his way to accommodate our big family and even bought a new pack-n-play for our baby! 
The house is very comfortable, spacey and clean. We found everything in order – a welcoming and warm atmosphere, clean sheets, etc. The house has a big kitchen and a big dining room, and was perfect for our morning breakfast for the entire group.
Everything was very efficient and smooth and comfortable.
I would definitely recommend this house and would stay there again.
Thank you Dan and Natasha for all your hospitality and care!"
2332949,25845314,2015-01-27,24916236,Scott,"A great place in an ideal location. Close to the hwy but amazingly quiet indoors.. The shower and kitchen amenities were very high-end..  Owners were very helpful when we called with a few questions. 

Very comfortable overall. Will happily book here again for our next visit. "
2332949,26090842,2015-02-02,20822654,Gideoon,LOVE THIS PLACE! MUST STATAY!! PERFECT FOR GROUPS!! 
2332949,26824481,2015-02-20,20530669,Brian,"The house was very clean and well furnished with nice furniture and utensils.  Dan made it very easy to enter and exit the home, and was very responsive to both emails and text messages."
2332949,27879293,2015-03-14,9613191,Ashley,"Dan was really great. He was very accommodating, quick to respond to any questions and also extremely helpful. The house and flat were just like the pictures and description. The kitchen is gorgeous! The one thing the house didn't have was a toaster, but it had a nice coffee maker and all other good appliances. We were a group of 8 people and it was perfect for our needs. Beds were comfy and big, and all the furniture was in good shape. I would stay here again and would definitely recommend this as a place to stay in Seattle!"
2332949,28336781,2015-03-22,688075,Terri,"Dan and Natalia's place was perfect for our business trip. We each had   our own bedroom and the living room with its fireplace was great to meet around in the evenings. The kitchen was awesome. Initially I was concerned about the house being so close to the freeway, but was pleasantly surprised by the lack of noise in the house and the beautiful neighborhood. Great for morning walks. I would definitely book this house again for a group our size or a family.  The 2 upstair bedrooms are beautiful; the 2 downstair ones are adequate but just bedrooms and little dark, but for a work trip it all worked out great. Great location with easy access to all the fun places to visit in Seattle. "
2332949,30383493,2015-04-21,650269,Nick,Great neighborhood and great proximity to other neighborhoods.  The bus right outside the house takes you through Capitol Hill and to downtown.   We rented the house to attended a conference at the convention center for several grad students and it worked wonderfully.  If you are traveling in a large group this house will work perfectly.  
2332949,31169680,2015-05-03,210740,Tracey,"The description is spot on. The house is very clean, has all the basics you need, and has comfortable common areas perfect for our group. The location is at the center of all of the major neighborhoods and sights, parking in the back convenient. With any questions, of which there are few as they are well prepared, immediate response. We were welcomed with a basket of snacks and wine. A great stay in a great house. "
2332949,33650431,2015-05-31,881509,Stephen,Dan and Natalia made everything so easy.  Great neighborhood for families traveling with young children.  And they were kind enough to have a bottle of wine waiting for the parents to enjoy once the kids went to sleep.  
2332949,34745799,2015-06-11,35016393,Lauren,"Great house! Dan was quick to respond and made sure we had everything we needed. We're a group of coworkers in town for a work conference, and the house was just as described. Comfortable, clean, and had plenty of room for us to spread out.  Another reviewer mentioned concern about the proximity to the freeway, which I was considering as well -- but it was hardly noticeable. The house is situated in a lovely neighborhood where we enjoyed taking evening walks. We would gladly stay in their home again! "
2332949,35770737,2015-06-22,12125767,Blair,"This is a great house. Clean, well kept and convenient. Everything was well organized for our stay."
2332949,36761398,2015-07-01,27290208,Tony,"Great Seattle location, minutes from downtown, allows you to avoid the interstate traffic.  Great size bedrooms, beautiful master bathroom.  First class kitchen, plenty of room for our family trip with 7 people.  Would definitely stay here again on a trip to Seattle.  Fan was responsive, gave thorough instructions and great local recommendations for the food scene. "
2332949,37135113,2015-07-05,441040,Meg,"Our family had a lovely stay at Dan's and Natalia's home.  The kitchen had excellent equipment and basic spices/glasses/dishes/pots/utensils, so it was very functional.  There were four bedrooms, a laundry room, three bathrooms, all clean and spacious.  In spite of the rather unexpected heatwave we encountered during our stay, the hosts were kind enough to have provided two floor fans, which helped a great deal.  Dan was extremely responsive before and during the trip, giving us tips on the neighborhood and answering all the questions we had about the house -- he even gave us the go-ahead to stay a few hours extra on our last day, as there was no new booking starting that evening.  
The neighborhood itself is lovely: tree-lined and a short drive from all the areas of Seattle we wanted to explore.  Would definitely come back to stay again and we would recommend this home to any friends looking for an AirBNB in Seattle!  "
2332949,40078299,2015-07-28,6591414,Jim,"Great place to stay with a family.   The neighborhood is quiet and there is a lovely park within two blocks.  The  house is close to a freeway which provides easy and quick access to the entire central city area.  The kitchen and master bath have been renovated recently and are a joy to use.  The deck in back and the front porch area provide additional living space.

"
2332949,41729674,2015-08-09,15946913,Kennedy,"Dan was a great host, and his house was well appointed with everything that we need. There was a couple hiccups but they were all resolved with Dan providing great communication and services. Thanks again!"
2332949,42812184,2015-08-16,25243523,Richard,The house was great. Everyone was comfortable. The large common areas made it easy for prepping food and family activities.   Definitely worth looking at again if I have another family even in town 
2332949,43765168,2015-08-22,33112353,Jessica,"The house has plenty of space for our 9 people. Enough rooms, enough bath rooms. We were happy to enjoy the nights in Dan's place. Thanks for the welcome wine that we had it in the first night. 
Dan was very helpful when we had questions. He returned our calls on time. Provided us the good instruction. 
One thing would like to mention was that the password of door. The procesure is a little complicated. It took us a while to open the door. Seems we did not notice there was a '#' required after the numbers.
Generally it was nice experience."
2332949,45061490,2015-08-31,29600825,Eileen,"Our adult family and one 15 mos. grandson stayed at Dan and Natalia's for almost a week, and had a wonderful stay.  The house was roomy and comfortable for our 6 1/2 people.  It was quiet, even though they are by the freeway, and we loved sitting on the deck in the mornings with coffee and in the evenings with a glass of wine.  We were very close to our family's home and so that was an extra pulse for us.  Very quiet neighborhood, and easy access to the freeway and other downtown spots.  Safe environment and warm home.  They even had a pack-in-play for our grandson to use."
2332949,47685588,2015-09-21,39765998,Jenna,"We had a great experience staying at Dan and Natalia's home! The location was excellent, really close to the bus line or close to get around to the main sights of Seattle via Uber. The home was a great size for our group of 7. It was very clean, and they were very welcoming and accommodating. We needed to leave our bags for a few hours after check-out and they were more than willing to help with that. Thanks for a great time!"
2332949,48254282,2015-09-24,30318574,Kareem,Perfect - bottle of wine and snacks waiting for us.
2332949,48682311,2015-09-28,26313462,Dan,Everything was great and as advertised!  Perfect location for our weekend.  Fun kitchen to cook in! Thanks for a great place to say!
2332949,49171866,2015-10-01,17936212,Janet,We enjoyed our stay in Seattle. The location was perfect for our plans.  Beautiful and safe neighborhood. The home was accommodating for our group with a large dining room table and plenty of room in the living area. Close Uber ride to the Mariners game and downtown Seattle. Thank you Dan for your welcoming hospitality.   
2332949,49633668,2015-10-05,34471106,Colleen,"The place is convenient to everything and you can avoid the freeway the whole time.  Lots of room for everyone and three bathrooms.  Kitchen is very nice and well appointed .  Having nice weather a bonus!  Host was very accommodating for extra night.  Thank you so much,  we had a great time."
2332949,51378718,2015-10-19,3605012,Jeff,"Gorgeous house with amazing access to downtown and the university. We went to a Husky game and was surprised how short the walk was. 

House is spacious. Kitchen is beautiful. Highly recommend "
2332949,54632986,2015-11-22,17875693,Lars,"Nice house, nice people. Super easy in and out. I would definitely stay here again!"
808811,7082735,2013-09-05,3178456,Steven,"Spent 3 days at this centrally located unit near Green Lake with easy access by bike and car to the Co-Op, cafes, parks and restaurants I enjoy. Easy to feel right at home in this family home with all the necessities of comfortable, convenient living. "
808811,7386436,2013-09-17,4655531,Stephanie,"Tracey and her family were incredibly gracious and welcoming hosts! They accommodated us on very short notice and Tracey even went out of her way to leave us a list of delicious places to eat and awesome bike rides in the neighborhood. The house is spacious, comfortable, well-decorated and fun! We would absolutely stay here again!"
808811,7712495,2013-09-30,8754991,Stacy,"Tracey and Russell are very, very nice people and very accommodating. It is worth noting that this home is not set up as a vacation rental, it is their full time home. This information would have changed my plans to stay, however as I mentioned I think if you needed anything the hosts would oblige. Thank you for sharing your home. "
808811,8071378,2013-10-14,9285986,Sheri,"Tracie's home was perfectly located for easy access to Green Lake, Freemont, and Ballard neighborhoods.  The home is on a pretty major street, however parking never seemed to be a problem.  As mentioned in other reviews, Tracie and her family live in this home full time, so if you are okay with that, then you'll have a wonderful time!  I particularly appreciated the fun family pictures displayed throughout the home - seems like a fun family indeed!"
808811,8359277,2013-10-27,8085246,Amanda,Tracey's home was very comfortable and in a great location. She had even baked us delicious muffins. Many thanks!
808811,9022990,2013-12-02,9520446,Robert,"Our stay over Thanksgiving was entirely problem-free - the house is comfortable and in a great location, everything works, and everything was clean and in place for our visit.  There were even cookies to munch on for our late evening arrival!  Tracey and family also left a lot of pictorial evidence of themselves in the house - it was fun to look at all the pictures, and to get a sense of the family even though we only met via email! SO: very highly recommended!
-Bob"
808811,9406945,2013-12-27,7658285,Heidi,"We had such a great time! Tracey and Russell were perfect hosts, from the excellent communication prior to our visit, to the homemade muffins awaiting our arrival. We would rent from them again in a heartbeat!"
808811,10719566,2014-03-04,1262190,Feliz & Ben,We loved staying at this house. There is also a neat basement apartment. It was perfect for a bunch of poets who stayed in this house for almost a week. We had an amazing time.
808811,11046496,2014-03-18,11162650,Emily,Very comfortable. Great location. Our 3 year old could not have been happier with all the toys and books. Thank You!
808811,11693353,2014-04-12,6354983,Jared,"It's a pretty amazing place, and I loved staying so close to Green Lake.  "
808811,12952170,2014-05-15,3566609,Ellen,"Great location and the hosts were very welcoming and clear communicators. When we arrived I noticed that the crib had been converted to a toddler bed (which wouldn't work for my 11-month old) and Russel cheerfully and quickly put the side back on the crib for me.  My daughter loved all the toys and there is a large collection of children's books, including plenty of board books.  The front porch and back patio were both wonderful places to relax.

However, we found the place to be dirtier than we wanted with a crawling child.  "
808811,14306735,2014-06-16,15303839,Mark,"I myself didn't stay there, but my relatives did.  This is what one of them said: ""It was a very nice place.  The owners were very nice and came through with everything they said they would.""  The neighborhood is very nice.  I myself also visited the home and it's very pleasant.  "
808811,16705775,2014-08-01,779874,Sarah,"We had a great stay for two weeks at Tracey's place. Our two-year-old loved all of the toys and books, and it was a great location with easy access to the Meridian playground (and farmer's market) as well as the path around Green Lake and the playground there. We felt very comfortable during our stay there and would definitely stay again!"
808811,16986810,2014-08-05,16638637,Lindsay,"The best part about staying here was the location and communication. The house is very near Green Lake and close to several buses. Tracey was easy to communicate with and even let us drop off our bags early. The house had a lot of character and was quirky and comfortable. The kitchen was a bit dirty, with some of the silverware, etc. in the drawers needing a wash before they could be used. We were glad we didn't need to use the place for cooking. It would be a perfect house if you're taking young kids."
808811,17131658,2014-08-07,19174696,Rachel,"Tracy and husband were nice hosts.
We were comfortable overall with our stay. The house looks a bit more upscale in the photo, it's a pretty funky but sweet place. It is near greenlake but actually on a busy street with fast cars. But convenient location. An easy walk to the shops in Wallingford...which was nice. They seem like a really lovely family and were very sweet and had sweet kids toys for preschool aged to play with."
808811,17435038,2014-08-12,6648896,Rick,"We had a great time in Greenlake - the area is amazing; so freiendly, so welcoming and just good fun! We wizzed past Tracey as she was on her way out as we arrived but she still gave us some great local tips. The house was perfect for our stay - many thanks."
808811,18113792,2014-08-22,16705009,Nancy,Great  location. thank you for sharing your home. It was was nice to meet you and your family. So glad you provided coffee!
808811,18345868,2014-08-25,19302367,Bob,Fun interior - Tracey and Russell have done a lot with very little. The house is nice and the location could not be better. We got up in the morning and had nice runs through the park and around the lake. Tracey and Russell went way way out of their way to make us feel welcome and make our stay comfortable.
808811,18626230,2014-08-29,3904755,"Heather, Mike & Eleni","For traveling with children, this house is really nice. Plenty of toys around and a bedroom set up with a crib and twin bed.  We we were welcome to forage from the fresh garden out the front, which was a fun activity for our 2 year old.  Despite being middle floor between tenants above and below, the house is really quiet (basement is sound proofed).  Family friendly."
808811,19018141,2014-09-04,20608692,Stephanie,Very hospitable. Cute place. Great first airbnb experience. Thank you!
808811,19283072,2014-09-09,19202790,Anna,"Tracey was a great host, everything was as she said it would be! It was extremely convenient to have all the baby items! "
808811,19617495,2014-09-15,19007220,Jimmy,"Tracey’s home was perfect for our 5-night stay in Seattle with our 18-month old daughter, mainly because the house is already setup for their own children: high chair, crib, changing table, and plenty of fun toys and books!

The neighborhood was also great: both the Woodland Park Zoo and the Meridian Playground are 10-minute walks, and there are many food and coffee options. We highly recommend the Blue Star Diner and Zoka.

We spent most of our trip visiting friends and walking around Belltown and downtown Seattle - it was very convenient to drive wherever we needed to go (via Aurora Ave N). We rented a small car, so we were able to park directly in front of the house, but larger cars wouldn’t fit, though there were always spots nearby to the house.

Tracey and Russell are welcoming and accommodating hosts. We enjoyed our stay!"
808811,20052218,2014-09-22,21151974,Lorene,"If you're traveling with young children, this place is a no brainer. This is a family home that will be your little one's personal preschool. It's fully equipped with crib and comfy twin bed in the nursery, high chair, TONS of books and toys, and a garden out front to boot. They even had toddler rain boots and a raincoat set out. And a major plus, it's across the street from Greenlake! 

If you're okay with a little walk, you are minutes from Mighty-O (vegan donuts), Tangletown (Elysian brewpub), and Kisaku (arguably the best sushi place in the area---Be adventurous! (email hidden) and have the itamae prepare his favorites). You're also minutes away from Archee McPhee's toy store, the zoo, a bank, many coffee shops, and Walgreens. We rented a car, but between Uber and the bus lines, we didn't even use it (the ""one bus away"" app was invaluable)!

Tracey and her family are thoughtful, excellent hosts and we will definitely be back!
"
808811,20351298,2014-09-28,6459697,Becky,"Very easy communication; fast, informative and clear! I knew exactly how to get in, where to find the key and definitely was made aware that we could make ourselves at home. We booked this as a place for grandparents to stay when they were visiting from Texas for our son's birthday."
808811,20768015,2014-10-05,21194636,Lin,My family had a great time in Tracey' house. We really appreciate Tracey and her husband shared their sweet home with us. They are very nice people and always offer help when we need. I would recommend their house to other family especially those who have kids. There are a lot of nice kids’ books and toys. My daughter and son had a lot of fun.
808811,21292254,2014-10-14,20987560,Barbara,This house is perfect for any visit to Seattle. It is a few blocks walk to a bus which will have you downtown in 20 minuets. It is  within walking distance of many restaurants and parking is always available on the street no matter what time of day. The renters upstairs and preschool down stairs are both surprisingly quiet. It was a great place to stay
808811,24272647,2014-12-24,5611798,Mariena,"We spent four nights at this beautiful older home in Green Lake.  It was prefect for us - a bed for my spouse and I, a futon for my parents, a twin for my son (a race car bed nonetheless) and a crib for the babe.  There were also toys a plenty for the kids, kid bowls and plates, etc.  the same price as a fancy hotel but a much better fit for us.  The only downside was the heating.  Even though there was forced air it was cold (We stayed in December).  There was a space heater in our room but unfortunately none in the kids room.  Our room actually felt warmer at night (must've been the space heater).  Also cool - my son picked us some kale from Tracey's garden and we put it in the pasta we made for dinner :-) "
808811,25303242,2015-01-11,10441719,Alex,Tracey was an excellent hostess. Provided everything we needed and information about the surrounding area. We would definitely book again
808811,26333930,2015-02-09,126306,Christina,"Tracey and Russell's place is fantastic -- comfortable, clean, and inspiring.  We had our three year old son along with us and we couldn't have found a better fit.  The trip was so enjoyable and so easy with wonderful, high-quality toys and general kid friendliness.  Our son adored playing with new toys and exploring the nearby Woodland Park and its many mudholes.  Tracey and Russell checked in with us multiple times before our trip began.  Highly, highly recommend!"
808811,27786239,2015-03-11,2762776,Jessica,A great place to stay! Neat and tidy and centrally located. Loved the proximity to Green Lake. 
808811,28731549,2015-03-29,22616789,Cherami And Scott,"This was our first airbnb, but we are experienced couchsurfers. In hindsight I learned to read all reviews before committing dollars to a home stay... Enough others talk about the uncleanliness of the place, but I didn't read those before I booked.
You may want to request clean sheets for your stay. We had to find and change the bedsheets. We were grateful we brought our own pillows, too. Positives were the house is in a great location and they have a baby/child ready room complete with crib, books and toys."
808811,34936380,2015-06-14,13972289,Gabriela,"Tracey and her husband were very accommodating and made our stay SUPER easy! The house locations is great, right across from a park,nearby cafes, and walking distance to restaurants. This was a wonderful house with excellent hosts!"
808811,37886556,2015-07-11,36094011,Matthew,"Staying  at this home made for a great week of vacation. The location was exactly as described, across the street from a park and with ample, easy street parking. The house was ready for our arrival, with clean sheets and towels, and everything tidy. Transfer of the key was easily arranged, and the hosts checked in with us repeatedly on our arrival date to make sure things were going smoothly. This was an excellent place to stay with a child (we have a 2-year-old) since there were toys around, and a separate room with a crib and changing table. The hosts even loaned us a stroller for the week, since we forgot to bring ours. They checked in a couple times during the week to make sure we had supplies and to take out the trash and recycling, and they answered our rare questions promptly via text message. We were allowed to use the kitchen and washer/dryer, which was helpful and fun during the stay. Overall, we had a very smooth experience in a very nice home where it was easy to settle in and relax."
808811,39196463,2015-07-21,18673964,Andrew,"Although I did not meet Tracey during my stay at her house, the place was amazingly cozy and welcoming. It looks way better in person compare to the pictures. The rooms were spacious and we loved hanging out in the front yard during the day. This was an excellent place to stay in Seattle, the location is great, you can walk to an area for food and drinks, and there is always parking in front.

Both Tracey and Russell were very helpful when we had questions. They also stocked the closet with extra bedsheets and towels, which came in handy since we had a group of 5 people staying at the house.

All in all, I loved the house and would definitely stay again when I come back to Seattle!"
808811,40396990,2015-07-30,113965,Jona,"Great stay at a wonderful, quirky house located close to Greenlake. Tracey was great with our last minute request to stay and while we didn't meet in person, everything was explained over emails and Tracey checked in to make sure we had everything we needed. Our girls loved all the toys and the garden to play in."
808811,41221266,2015-08-05,23619406,Shannon,"This home is a bohemian paradise.  Superior location for a family, easy to access, quaint, albeit a bit unconventional (or perhaps not so by Seattle standards).  This home was clean, with plenty of comfortable sleeping- and a crib for the little one. The kid friendly environment with books and toys was a huge bonus. Read through the amenities before you book and note that this IS someone's home, not a house set up as a rental (i.e BYO toothepaste). We were unprepared for no TV or microwave, but ultimately the latter was a blessing in disguise. (My fault for not reading the amenities section before booking.) The hosts were very easy to communicate with and the neighbors were all very friendly. If you are seeking a very quiet or secluded place, this may not be the right house for you, but it was perfect for our family vacation."
808811,41780392,2015-08-09,9859905,Adele,"The house was exactly as described-- a lovely environment to call temporarily home!  Very clean and in an excellent neighborhood, within easy walking distance from Greenlake and a number of restaurants and stores.  The hosts were clear and communicative in their instructions and we had a wonderful experience."
808811,42877776,2015-08-16,1558554,William,"This was a GREAT airbnb space, really among the best I've stayed at. The house was well-appointed and spacious, the kitchen had all the plates/glasses/etc that you'd need. Loved the living room most of all, especially the wood fireplace, which was perfect since, even in August, our first night in Seattle was awfully chilly!

We never met Tracey, which was just fine – she arranged for everything we needed and we were just able to enjoy the house. The neighborhood is BEAUTIFUL, right on Green Lake. Fantastic neighborhood to take a stroll through. Couldn't recommend this place more highly."
808811,44171661,2015-08-24,446713,Justin,"Nice open floor plan with plenty of room to visit around the big table.  It was easy to find, parking was easy and it was so close to the zoo and the lovely Green Lake! Location was central to everything we did and easy to navigate.  We couldn't believe how quiet it was, considering the amount of traffic on the street.  The changing table made it very accommodating to have an infant in the house. 

Be sure to really push the refrigerator door closed as it doesn't seal well and leaks water.  "
808811,45266139,2015-09-01,36070350,Kara,"A group from my company stayed here while in Seattle for a convention, and they had a wonderful experience! It's such a homey, comfortable, clean space that's very conveniently located in a beautiful part of town. Tracey was a wonderful host! She was very accommodating, and she made sure to check in with us to assure everything went smoothly. Highly recommended! "
808811,45307621,2015-09-01,8652944,Virginia,The host canceled this reservation the day before arrival. This is an automated posting.
808811,46768128,2015-09-13,22890912,Mary,We had a wonderful stay at Tracey's house. The location is great and parking was not a problem. The house and bed arrangements were exactly as described -incredibly comfortable mattresses. We loved the open floor and charming furnishings. We were three adult couples arriving from different places at different times so the easy key access made it very handy for us.  A really good experience!
808811,48661134,2015-09-27,45032962,Claire,We hade a great stay. The location was perfect for us and right near a beautiful park and lake. The house was very clean and well decorated. 
808811,50418871,2015-10-11,34017478,Tracie,"We had a wonderful stay. Tracey was quick to respond and able to accommodate our last minute reservations.

The house was well appointed and comfortable.  The neighborhood is beautiful. We enjoyed the park across the street with our kids and even our dog had a place to roam at the dog park. We walked to restaurants and relaxed between concerts, shopping and other activities. 

Tracey is a thoughtful hostess.
Greenlake is a highly walkable community. We highly recommend and can hardly wait to return."
808811,57346081,2015-12-24,14655014,Beverly,"Tracey was very helpful and responsive to questions about the rental.  The location and house are wonderful, and it was perfect for us as we had our son and his family (a 4 year old and an infant) with us.  The crib and changing table were blessings as they drove up from Portland and didn't have to bring much baby equipment.  They also loved the fun and creative toys.  We loved the place, highly recommend it, and would be glad to stay again.  "
9327585,53731339,2015-11-11,14491003,Vanessa,Great location! Place was clean and comfortable.

9327585,54286033,2015-11-17,13122300,Kristen,The unit was very clean and charming. It had everything we needed and was also very quiet and private. It is within walking distance to all of the shops on Broadway in Capitol Hill as well. The common areas are beautifully decorated. I would definitely recommend staying here!
9327585,54472878,2015-11-20,2160765,Jaime,Our host Eric was fantastic! The room was clean and modern and in a great neighborhood full of good eats and good people! You can't beat the view from the well designed roof top patio. I would highly recommend a stay here!
9327585,54789384,2015-11-23,21637943,Raquel,"Cute, clean, great location. Perfect for the traveler on the go. "
9327585,55069101,2015-11-27,49418355,Ian,"These aPODments are really awesome!! Perfect size for a short get away. I was very comfortable staying here. Great and convenient location, walking distance to a ton of places. Eric was extremely fast responding to my questions and requests. I appreciated the welcoming snacks, was a nice touch. I can't wait to visit Seattle again and will definitely book with Eric again! Thank you!"

9327585,55772461,2015-12-05,904303,Nicholas,The room is immaculate and minimalist.  Nice details like an electric kettle made it easy to get caffeinated and head out for the day.
9327585,55940104,2015-12-07,26168120,Patrick,"A very unique experience!  Very clean room in a fascinating building close to shops and restaurants.   Very specious common areas for hanging out/dining.

Thanks,
Patrick"
9327585,56853690,2015-12-19,31173052,Nathan,"Found the description to be misleading. Said there was a TV but it was in a common area. Washer and dryer broke during the last day and kept eating my coins. There was also sharp wires in the walls next to the bed that scratched and  cut me when I slept. Found it to be expensive for its size and quality, ho
wever the location was good. "
2149219,16304704,2014-07-25,16902935,Melanie,"Staying at St. John's Place was easy, convenient, and the apartment had everything we needed. The apartment is in a great location near lots of bars and restaurants and the place itself is clean and comfortable. Check-in and check-out with Christine was super easy and friendly."
2149219,16546988,2014-07-29,5120637,Patrick,"Great location, clean and comfortable. Christine was very helpful and everything was a breeze!"
2149219,16772933,2014-08-02,2380968,Jamie,"We had a great experience staying here. The apartment was very clean and equipped with everything we needed (towels, toiletries, and kitchen appliances). We got in late but were able to pick up the keys from the bar downstairs, which was very convenient. Apartment was in a great location and Christine was very friendly and helpful when we met her. Would definitely stay here again!"
2149219,18479440,2014-08-27,16476530,Tobias,"I booked this location for four family members (2 couples in their 50's).

The listing was accurate, the location was clean. We had little trouble getting in (locating the right place for key pick-up was a little tricky for the visitors), but communication with the host(s), through texts, was clear, straightforward, and concise.

The stay itself was pleasant, although midway through my family's trip, the hosts needed to access the apartment for repair/plumbing problems in the adjacent apartment - the building is older and needs care, I guess.

All in all a pleasant stay, and a prime location, right at the western end of Capitol Hill (with everything that comes with it)."
2149219,29830658,2015-04-13,25942383,Ashley,PERFECT place to stay! Location was incredible. I would definitely stay here again if we go back to Seattle. Thanks for everything! 
2149219,30392266,2015-04-21,25521266,Kathleen,"Great place to stay! Nice 10 minute walk from the convention center and 20 to Pikes Place Market. Clean and works great for groups of 4. Much preferred over a hotel. Also conveniently across from a grocery store, qfc, and amazing restaurants."
2149219,37965700,2015-07-12,811033,Gillian,"Christine was very quick to respond to any questions or queries. Keys and parking pass were left as promised in the bar downstairs. Apartment was spacious and as pictured in photos. 
As we arrived during quite a hot period it was lovely to have air conditioning in the living room. There was a fan in the bedroom but no air conditioning which made the room a bit stuffy. Easy access to shopping and eating but very noisy until 3 am over the weekend.
"
2149219,38847047,2015-07-19,28700863,Michael,"I couldn't have picked a better location and rental for my recent trip to Seattle.  Checking in was quick and easy and when we walked into the apartment, we were welcomed by the charming decor all the comforts of home.  The apartment was extremely clean, quiet and very comfortable.  I was able to successfully manage relaxing, working and touring.  I highly recommend anyone considering staying in Seattle to stay at this apartment.    "
2149219,42860379,2015-08-16,11503145,Andriy,The St. John's Apartments are a great place to stay in Seattle. Everything went very smooth and easy. 
2149219,43778003,2015-08-22,915965,Kristine,"Because we arrived late, Christine left keys to our (email hidden) downstairs.  We loved our apartment and its location.  Good exercise walking up and down that hill everyday!  

My only criticism would be the lingering dish smell in the hallway of the apartment, apparently from the pervious renter.   I kept thinking it owuld air out and go away but it didn't.  In fairness to Christine, I didn't notify her of this til later in the week. "
2149219,44434674,2015-08-26,1135298,Kerem,"Christine was very email accessible. She responded quickly and made arrival and departure very easy. She was willing to provide suggestions on where to go and things to do. The apartment was nice and spacious. The surrounding neighborhood was very unique. It appears to be up and coming, however there is still a homeless population in the neighborhood. There are plenty of bars and restaurants in the area. The apartment is also walking distance to all other sights in Seattle. Overall, a good stay and would recommend. "
2149219,46131048,2015-09-08,3532892,Chris,"This was our 2nd (email hidden)hn's apartment and it did not disappoint!  It is in an excellent location, and the property itself is very nice.  The unit was very clean and serviceable, and had an excellent instruction book with recommendations for local establishments.  Did not get a chance to meet Christine directly but communication electronically was excellent.  "
2149219,49791666,2015-10-06,8614650,Meara,"Great experience staying at St. John's.  Christine was helpful and responsive via email, and picking up the keys on check-in was very easy and convenient, especially appreciated because we arrived late in the evening.

The apartment was scrupulously clean, the bed and the pull-out couch were both quite comfortable, and the internet was fast.  Plus the location is great!  Very walkable, lots of great places to eat and things to do nearby.  I would stay there again."

1716901,34475916,2015-06-08,33942294,Brad,This was the perfect place for our Seattle weekend. Her welcome packet was really thoughtful and her amenities were very gracious. It was exactly what we were hoping it would be.
1716901,34665660,2015-06-10,34079173,Colleen,Candace's place is lovely. It's in a great location and she really made my boyfriend and I feel at home. Definitely a great place to stay if you're in Seattle! 
1716901,34888107,2015-06-13,15875182,Alex,"Candace was a great host! She responded quickly to every request and question we had. We arrived to an apartment made to feel like home. The apartment was well-situated in the city, and Top Pot is located a couple blocks away for easy coffee and donuts in the morning. I would recommend Candace anyone looking for a comfortable and easy stay in Seattle."
1716901,35226592,2015-06-16,5038843,Jonathan,"Candace's apartment is located in a beautiful part of Seattle, Capitol Hill and within walking distance of Broadway and Pike/Pine where there are amazing restaurants, bars and the essential Elliot Bay Book store. The apartment is clean, tidy, and has excellent facilities. It was all we needed for our trip. Definitely take Candace's recommendations of where to eat in the International District. We had the most wonderful authentic Chinese dinner at Jade Garden."
1716901,39005435,2015-07-20,9247531,David,"Candace was friendly and warm in all her email communications prior to the stay at her cozy home. Upon arrival, my wife and I found things exactly as it was mentioned on AirBNB description. Our 3 night stay in the neighborhood was safe, and sound, and we were not that far from things we wanted to do. A $5-$10 Lyft/Uber ride from most things we wanted to visit, see and do.

This was my 3rd time visiting Seattle and the last two times, I stayed at a hotel. This time, I wanted a trip that was different and more personal with the city that I love. Candace's home allowed me to experience the city at a more personal level, and her maps in her home helped me greatly."
1716901,43915524,2015-08-23,647260,Fusae,"Candace is a really great host! She is easy to comunicate with and give informations about how to go to anywhere in Seattle. The apartment is spacious, have everything you need and is like a home away. The location is really good, in a calm and quiet residencial area. We definitelly recommend Candace place!!!"
1716901,44325888,2015-08-25,19495932,Andras,"Candace' apartment is a very welcoming place, I enjoyed returning there after the end of the day, with a nice and charming ambient.
The bus stops right at the building and takes you to downtown in a few minutes. Also the neighborhood is nice and quiet while just a few blocks away you can find ample of choices for eating out, shopping or just having a few beers.
Candace was quick to respond to any emails and made sure we feel comfortable at her place. She also provided maps and tips of what and where to do."
1716901,49843155,2015-10-06,8185057,Helanah,Great place and wonderful experience! Great amenities and yes you have access to the sauna and jacuzzi and pool daily which is. Awesome! Great location and great experience!

1716901,53087147,2015-11-04,4460223,Shane,I spent almost a week at Candace's place in Capitol Hill and it was nice. The apartment was cozy and homey. I got everything I need. I truly feel home here. There were some problems with wifi on the first night but it got fixed on the second day. Candace is very responsive too. She responded almost immediately. She is that kind of host that you can rely on.    
1716901,54108075,2015-11-16,44549111,Kevin,Perfect!  Candace was wonderful and we loved her apartment.  Very close to lots of shops and restaurants.

1488166,6450595,2013-08-12,4134523,Meg,"Jeremy was an incredibly gracious host. He left detailed instructions tucked just where you might need them, rather than in a three page document and he checked on us beforehand to make sure we had gotten directions to his home. We were so grateful for him accepting a last minute request which provided us with a warm, family atmosphere to relax in with our sons from out of town. The location of Sunset Hill meant that our sons could walk to pick up delicious Italian food and the basement allowed them a place to hang out and play air shuffleboard and ping pong without us hearing once we had retired for the night in the beautiful master suite on the top floor of the house. It was a perfect weekend, capped off with glasses of wine on the front porch while we watched the sunset! "
1488166,7042441,2013-09-04,6214859,Joel,"The house is huge and could probably sleep 12. We were looking for a house rather than a hotel so we didn't feel compelled to go out all the time. Mission accomplished! This really felt like a home.

The host really couldn't have done much better. I didn't feel scared to touch anything. And we were welcomed with a nice note and two bottles of wine. Just in general the notes were helpful for the stuff that is never easy, like the stove or the shower.

"
1488166,7495236,2013-09-22,8784718,Tyler,"Jeremy was an amazing host, and their house was absolutely beautiful. We had shopped around a bit before settling on this home and couldn't be any happier with our decision. The experience here was incredible and we are truly thankful for Jeremy to provide it for us.

In our next venture to Seattle, I would not hesitate to stay here again should it be available. Jeremy helped to render our short vacation a very, very memorable one, and would love to return in the future!"
1488166,8029976,2013-10-13,7570404,Ken,They were gracious and considerate hosts who accommodated our needs and provided us with a great space to conduct our study. Would highly recommend their space!
1488166,13720655,2014-06-02,9817041,Lindsay,I needed a place to stay while my hardwood floors were being redone nearby.  It was a perfect home away from home as I've always admired the space from the outside.  They were great hosts: they even leave helpful notes around the house to get you settled in.  I'd definitely recommend staying here!
1488166,14389599,2014-06-18,6971791,Yuta,"We had a wonderful time staying in Jeremy and Rachael’s beautiful home in Seattle.  We felt completely at home during our entire stay.  The moment we arrived, we loved the unique architectural details in the home.  Jeremy and Rachael have a great design eye; the furnishings are tasteful and elegant, yet comfortable.  As six adults and a few children, we had more than enough space in the house and never felt cramped.  We enjoyed being able to cook our meals in the spacious, well-stocked, high-end kitchen.  Even on a cloudy day, the outstanding panoramic view of Puget Sound was fantastic.  

The location of the home is in a charming residential neighborhood tucked into a quiet corner of Seattle.  Almost everything we wanted to see was a quick 15- or 20-minute car ride away.

We really couldn’t have asked for a more perfect place to stay in Seattle."
1488166,15756917,2014-07-15,14947897,Gail & Tony,"Our five days at Jeremy and Rachael’s home at Sunset Hill in Seattle (Ballard) earn an A+.  It  was just about all it was advertised to be and turned out to be pretty much what we had hoped--but did not expect.   
The accommodations are quite adequate for six adults–-the air mattresses are more like beds than air mattresses.  We could have used another (third)  bathroom but we made do with the two available facilities.  The many steps, at first, were daunting; by the end of the visit we’d become used to them.
Our hosts provided a fine array of dishes, utensils and cooking equipment,  but only French press coffee pots (which are inconvenient for making breakfast coffee for so many people).  We  borrowed an automatic drip pot.
The gas grill cooks Northwest salmon very well.  The kitchen stove is a bit scary.
Some of us missed having a TV and a telephone land line; some of us did not.
Our hosts are generous with provisions and with sharing much of what they have, including food in the fridge and the cupboards.  
The maintenance woman, whom we encountered incidentally, was kind and helpful.  Even though our hosts left us thorough,  written instructions  it helped to communicate with a live person.
All of our guests were pleasantly surprised at the accommodations; they thoroughly enjoyed being there.
The view of the sunsets is  awesome; the front and back yard landscaping are very well maintained.
Over all, our stay at Sunset Hill was very pleasant.
Jeremy and Rachael’s home was our first experience with Airbnb.  We’re likely to use the service again.,
Thank you."
1488166,15980281,2014-07-19,17001757,Annie,"We had a wonderful experience in this home. The house itself was spacious, gorgeous and amazingly well equipped. Jeremy and Rachael were easy to reach and very accommodating (even when they were halfway around the world on vacation!). I would highly recommend this house to anyone looking to stay in a home. Amazing views, quiet neighborhood and not far from a charming row of restaurants and bars on Ballard Ave. 

Bonus: Sonos system house-wide :)"
1488166,16199260,2014-07-23,14009083,Jody,"Our stay on sunset Hill was perfect from start to finish.  Jeremy and Rachael were gracious and helpful every step of the way.  The home is beautiful, exceptionally well-equipped, and was ideally located for our stay.  I could not possibly come up with a negative comment.  We felt truly AT home. "
1488166,16464333,2014-07-28,15428154,Diana,"The house was exactly as we expected - great location in a beautiful area.
We loved staying in Rachael and Jeremy's home.  It was clean and we had everything we could have needed.
"
1488166,17457314,2014-08-12,3720168,Diane,"We had a wonderful time at this beautiful home. Jeremy and Rachael have done so much beyond the usual to make guests' time easy, comfortable and relaxing. In addition to every aspect of the home being gorgeous, they have placed helpful signs in places that allow guests to easily find things. Their generosity with ""provisions"" extended to ""help yourselves to the fridge,"" which is so helpful when traveling. Make sure if you're doing a two-stop vacation, make this home your second, because anything after it will feel like less."
1488166,31490625,2015-05-05,203494,Sandhya,Jeremy and Rachel's house is beautiful! We just rented it for a day for a shoot and we loved it! Its in a great location with an outstanding view and the hosts were very accommodating making sure we had everything to make it a successful day. We hope to see them again!
1488166,35068839,2015-06-15,8614940,Rachael,"The view was incredible - well worth the price!! The house was clean and although it was bit tight with 6 of us, everyone had a place to sleep :) 
Jeremy and Rachael were very friendly and available when needed!"
1488166,35635344,2015-06-21,27129404,Jess,"We absolutely loved staying at Jeremy and Rachael's home! It was perfectly equipped, charming, and welcoming. They were accommodating and helpful from beginning to end.  We couldn't have asked for a better view and location and highly recommend their home.  Everything was perfect! "
1488166,40208581,2015-07-29,4376683,Leigh,Jeremy was so welcoming; making sure every detail was to our liking--including rearranging beds for us!  There were flowers and a bottle of wine awaiting us upon arrival.  The house is lovely and as presented.  The kitchen is wonderful for cooks (which we are) and the downstairs family room was great for gathering.  I give Jeremy many thumbs up as a host.
1488166,43211183,2015-08-18,22572227,Linda,"Our stay in this very comfortable home was absolutely wonderful - our hosts were very gracious and welcoming - with flowers and wine and when we couldn't find a wine opener - Jeremy ordered 2 overnight via Amazon!  The open floor plan, with lots of natural light throughout the home combined with all the amenities made our stay perfect.  We enjoyed stunning sunsets from the living and dining room, not to mention the front deck.  The home was perfect for inviting some of our wedding guests over in the evenings on the deck and in the living/dining room.  Our son lived in Ballard and it is a great place to enjoy dining, shopping, the locks, and access to Golden Gardens.  Within 5 minutes is a great deli/cafe/bakery and organic grocery store with wine and a nice assortment of items.  10 minutes away is Cafe Besalu which has the best French pastries and croissants.  None of us wanted to leave this home and hopefully we can return soon and stay for 2 weeks the next time.  "
1488166,46365080,2015-09-10,29335850,Anita,"Rachael & Jeremy were very thoughtful to leave fresh flowers and their favorite bottle of wine awaiting our arrival.  It was very pleasant welcoming surprise.  The neighborhood is very nice with beautiful views but make sure your vehicles are locked.  Criminals like nice neighborhoods.  

The home was exactly as described on the airbnb website.  

Rachael & Jeremy were kind enough to share their lovely home with our family for a wedding.  We were a family of 5 and had lots a room to maintain our own privacy, not disturbing others.  The gourmet kitchen had professional appliances that served our daughter, a pastry chef, perfectly for completing a wedding cake she brought with her from many miles away and baked the grooms' cake, decorating and completing it there.  Having 2 refrigerators worked well for the various stages of the 2 cakes and holding flowers also for the cake.  The beautiful views of Puget Sound made it difficult to accomplish tasks cause we just couldn't break away.  The home was immaculate and nicely appointed in every area.  The Sonos sound system throughout the home, for the classic music we enjoyed, along with the original wood In the 1927 Craftsman home, brought us back to a different era.  Using airbnb for the first time was perfect for our needs and Rachael & Jeremy were the most gracious hosts.  The many notes throughout was quite helpful by explaining how different systems work.   The airbnb experience and this home was far above our expectations.  It was very relaxing and comfortable.  The home was organized and efficient.  "
1488166,50643360,2015-10-13,20431799,Robert,Jeremy and Rachael are very organized.  Everything is explained well and the house is comfortable and clean and uncluttered.  It is a very beautiful home in a great area of Seattle. 
1488166,55472322,2015-12-01,48781167,William,"We had a wonderful stay at Jeremy and Rachael's beautiful home.  They were very welcoming in their messages to us and left a very nice bottle of red wine waiting for us at arrival.  The location was excellent for us, and the home is very comfortable and had plenty of room for myself, wife, daughter and son-in-law.  It has a wonderful front deck with bay view.  It is very well maintained and furnished very nicely with nice finishes.  The kitchen and dining area is very nice and well equipped, and we loved the commercial range for cooking our Thanksgiving dinner for the four of us plus my son and his wife.  The master bedroom and large downstairs room had wonderful beds, linens, and towels.  The master and main floor bathrooms are very nice.  The house manual has very complete information and it is well organized.  In a word everything worked out perfectly, and we left very happy and satisfied.  This was our first experience using Airbnb and needless to say it was a very good one. "
748526,2981540,2012-11-27,4036135,Michel,"Amy and Milo (her little French Bulldog) were great hosts to us and our dog Libby.  The apartment is newly finished and very well appointed.  We expected lots of takeout while we rented here but ended up cooking most nights in the small, but practical, kitchen (bonus points for soft-close drawers, yay!). 
The bathroom is equally practical with nice finishes, plenty hot water and a shower that I can stand up under which is rare even in most homes.

In short, we had a great stay and I would recommend her and her place to anyone!  Thanks again Amy!"
748526,7787043,2013-10-03,3567820,Jay,The reservation was canceled 12 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
748526,8066406,2013-10-14,5831916,Cathy,The apartment is in great condition and has everything you need for a short stay in Seattle. I'll be back!
748526,9018763,2013-12-02,1120212,Angela,"I stayed at Amy's MIL suite for about 6 weeks when moving to Seattle. The place was clean, modern and easy to call home for a few weeks. It had everything I needed for an extended stay! I did not use public transportation but it was in easy driving distance of all my needs. I definitely recommend staying here if you are needing a place to stay in Seattle."
748526,10599877,2014-02-27,10140880,Stefan,"I had a wonderfull time staying in Amy's appartment. She is a great ladlord and lovley person who helps you to find your way in Seattle. The apartment is very clean and recently renovated and its everything included you need to make your stay comfotable. It's sad i had to leave and i would love to come back again.
Thank you Amy :)"
748526,11011857,2014-03-17,11823932,Helmut,"The apartment is in great condition and has everything you need for a stay in Seattle. Although you need something extra, Amy helps.
The description of the Studio at airbnb is good.
Location in town is nice especially for tours by bus. No own car needed.
We felt fine at Amys."
748526,12161801,2014-04-24,2283218,Jeri,"Amy was very considerate  and responsive. We spent our days walking to Phinney Ridge, Ballard, and even Fremont (a longer trek). It's just a few blocks from coffee, bars, and dinner spots, too. All in all, a super convenient location. 

You'll hear footsteps on the hardwood overhead, but that's to be expected in a garden apartment. "
748526,13254392,2014-05-23,15276154,Steven,"Mother in law studio was located in a very nice location, close to the bus in a residential area.  If my travels take me through Seattle in the future, I would definately want to stay at Amy's again."
748526,13418141,2014-05-27,2129316,Monica,We had a great time at Amy's place! It's very clean and comfortable. It's the perfect place to stay to enjoy the NW side of Seattle and is just a quick bus ride from downtown.
748526,13972965,2014-06-09,15472216,Nancy,"The listing was neat, clean and exactly what we were looking for. The neighborhood was very quiet and it was super easy to get around as the 28 bus comes about every 1/2 hour and takes you right to downtown Seattle and the Fremont district. We never actually met Amy (we were out and about most of the time) but that meant we weren't ever hearing her stomping on floors or anything. 

Just a note about the neighborhood, it's weirdly devoid of connivence or grocery stores within walking distance. Not a huge deal but it was just a bit weird as we had an odd time trying to buy shampoo. If you had a rental car or bike it would be a non-issue. 

There are also tons of great restaurants and other places to go within walking distance. The zoo was a pretty quick walk away and there were tons of restaurants, cafes and bars on the way there. "
748526,14746197,2014-06-25,15815467,Renee,"Amy's mother-in-law quarters was very nice and simple.  The bed was very comfortable, the bathrom was cute and clean.  Great location for our needs.
I would like to mention one thing to be aware of, it is in the basement which means the ceilings are low, very low in one section.  "
748526,15304420,2014-07-07,12835099,Catherine,Amy was an awesome host. Everything we needed for our stay was available. It was easy to check in and out as well. Would highly recommend!
748526,15569290,2014-07-12,8179476,Kimberly,We had an amazing stay at Amy's place. Everything we needed was there - from a small kitchen to a blow dryer. Would definitely stay there again. 
748526,15866861,2014-07-17,15615497,Erin,"This was a lovely studio between the Ballard and Phinney neighborhoods. It was clean, comfortable, and well appointed. Just a couple minute walk to the bus or about a ten minute walk to shops and restaurants. The neighborhood was quiet and friendly.

We really enjoyed our stay."
748526,16010798,2014-07-20,14574575,Chloe,"My partner and I enjoyed our stay in Amy's apartment. It is clean, spacious and has all the necessities for a short stay. The apartment is in a great area with lots of cute shops and great places to eat close by. It took around 30 minutes to get into downtown Seattle by bus. As the apartment is under a house you will hear the activity which is happening in the house above. Something to note is some of the apartment has a low ceiling, so this could be an issue for people who are tall. Wifi was provided however the connection wasn't strong enough for browsing i.e.  things to do whilst in Seattle. Overall, another great Air Bnb experience! Thanks Amy!"
748526,16714340,2014-08-01,1400390,June,"I stayed a week, my husband about 10 days. The place was very clean, with many new features like the bathroom, laundry facilities, carpeting throughout, and kitchen. We have stayed at other, similar basement apartments in this neighborhood, so comparisons are easy and obvious. What I missed:
• When I first sat down on the bed, the bottom slats fell out. I encountered the cleaning lady in the driveway. She had tools in her car. I fixed the bed myself using her tools. It was an Ikea thing that was poorly put together.
• The wi-fi connection was pretty bad. For hours at a time we couldn't connect at all or if so, the connection was very slow. If I had been on a business trip instead of a vacation, I'd have been in trouble with the internet connection. Later, days into our stay, Amy gave us a password for a better connection. Possibly the free and open wi-fi had too many users on it?
• Dining issue: there were no chairs or dining area. We had to eat sitting either in bed, on the floor, standing up, or on a tiny loveseat whose bottom cushion was kinda close to the floor, knees by our chins. A 2-person table and chairs would be nice.
• Bedroom issues: there was a window opposite the bed which had no window covering! Someone could potentially just look in on me as I lay in bed. I put the clothes rack in front of the window and hung a towel as a curtain. :( There was a mirror leaning against the wall and precariously standing on two empty shoe boxes. It fell off its perch. I just left it that way until I packed out. The bed is a double and too small for me: at 6 feet, my feet are over the end. A queen sized would be better. Also, there's only one night stand and lamp. One person can enjoy a lighted bedside, one person cannot.
It seems like this place is just getting going as an Airbnb rental: everything that is finished is very new and quite nice, actually. It's just that there haven't been many (any?) folks staying there and so the kinks haven't been worked out.
• Kitchen issues: There was no coffee pot so we drank instant the whole time we were there. In Seattle, no coffee! There were only two spoons, two forks, two knives, etc. Stir your coffees, put the spoons in the sink and you're out of spoons. Sharp knife was the dullest I've ever encountered in the serrated category. There were not separate bins for kitchen scraps, recycling, and garbage even though Seattle collects these items separately. 
Like I say: the place seems newly fitted out and put together in a rush at the end. I would definitely stay there again if these things I listed were in place. It's a nice, clean, quiet, convenient place near Ballard, Phinney Ridge, and Greenlake in Seattle."
748526,17765507,2014-08-17,16836909,Dave,"The apartment was clean and updated.  Everything was as advertised.  Previous poster mentioned the window opposite the bed had no blinds or covering.  I was surprised by this as well, but ended up moving the cloths rack in front of it and putting a towel on it for privacy.  

It is a basement apartment, so there are some low ceilings and tall individuals (6'+) may need to watch their head in some places.  

I tried using the internet connection that was unsecured but didn't have any luck.  If you need internet access where you are staying, keep this in mind.  The apartment does not specifically advertise having internet access, so you'll be relying on getting access from an unsecured connection from someone in the neighborhood.

Amy was great to work with and very responsive when I had a few questions.  It was my first Airbnb experience and was pretty painless."
748526,20148634,2014-09-24,20231122,Tina,"The Mother in law studio on Cleopatra Place NW, Seattle, WA, was a cozy little studio to stay in...I was in seminar each day, and could take care of my own meals, etc each night. The neighborhood was an older and charming area to see. Afternoon walks included meeting friendly folks walking their darling dogs!"
748526,20796368,2014-10-05,9840962,Sarah,"I loved my short stay at Amy's little bright studio apartment.  I recently moved to Seattle and needed a short term rental before moving into my apartment. She was so accommodating even when I made my reservation very short notice.  Ballard is a great area, too! Close to shops and food and entertainment.  I would definitely stay here again if ever need be!"
748526,21300989,2014-10-14,6762770,Adri,"The apartment was great and just as described! It was in walking distance to the bus and some great restaurants. The area was also very close to Ballard and Fremont. The neighborhood is very cute and we felt very safe. We took public transportation most of the time, but the one day we had a car there was plenty of parking. Even though we only saw Amy once she was very friendly and asked if our accommodations were satisfactory. They totally were! We recommend Amy's place to anyone that wants to enjoy great Seattle restaurants, bars and shops in close proximity without all the traffic and hustle of downtown. "
748526,21767183,2014-10-23,20730287,Michael,"As advertised, very cozy, clean, and comfortable. Amy gave us ask the required information and offered advise about Seattle. Would recommend her place."
748526,26617314,2015-02-16,13387459,Charlie,"This space was perfect for our short stay in Seattle. The place is located in a beautiful neighborhood, but is still super close to a bunch of awesome food and drink. All of the major sights were only a 5 - 10 minute uber ride away including Fremont which is a must. Amy was incredibly hospitable and she keeps this beautiful space immaculate. So much yes. "
748526,28496290,2015-03-24,24165834,中成,"the apartment is cool  and Amy isa good guy , but the bed is no good."
748526,30139999,2015-04-18,25042720,Kim,"Fantastic. The word sums up everything about this property and it's host! Amy was welcoming and went out of her way to make things easy for me that first night (when my east coast flight was extremely delayed). Once in the suite - it was just like her pictures, cozy, comfortable and had everything I needed right there, including easy parking. Amy and I decided to connect and I'm glad that we did - I now have a new friend in my new hometown! I'd recommend this property to anyone looking for a great place to ""live"" while visiting Seattle.  "
748526,30898013,2015-04-28,14275525,Caroline,My in-laws spent 4 nights at Amy's place and loved it! This was their first airbnb experience and now they're hooked. Amy's place was clean and comfortable with nice amenities. The location was great and we'll definitely book with her again. 
748526,32609272,2015-05-19,20411574,Erin,"Amy's place is in a very convenient area and in walking distance to many great bars and restaurants. The place was clean and a good place to crash while exploring Seattle and the Ballard neighborhood. Amy also went above and beyond by providing coffee, sparkling water and bananas for our stay. The bed was comfortable and there was ample pillows and blankets as well as some nice magazines about Seattle on the table. A great place for a great price! "
748526,33606915,2015-05-30,26665583,Dora,We had a pleasant stay. Amy was considerate not to make too much noise in the morning when she gets up as the floor boards are rather noisy
748526,34344537,2015-06-07,11637194,Matt,"Amy was great and the place is very nice and well kept! We stayed for six days before our apartment was available and really enjoyed our time in Ballard. Lovely area! The ceilings are a bit low as others have noted, but there is plenty of space and a nice sections for the bed area, living room, kitchen. Overall, a very wonderful stay and would recommend it and at a very reasonable rate. "
748526,35661051,2015-06-21,31685141,Keith,"A very well-planned and executed build-out of space and appointment of surfaces.  All essentials were covered by the Amy, the location was great, close to mass transit, quant neighborhood restaurants and stores.  Would definitely consider again as well as recommend this unit to family or friends.  "
748526,36546154,2015-06-29,28996817,Afton,"The place was great and just as described!  My mother stayed here while visiting me.  She can be a picky traveler, but had no complaints here. Spacious, nicely outfitted and convenient location to Fremont.  I would encourage my visiting family to stay here, again."
748526,37475239,2015-07-07,26962690,Justine,"Amy was very responsive and prompt so that made us feel comfortable.  We arrived late (around midnight), so having the lockbox available right outside the front door was convenient as well.  Overall, the space met our needs.  The bathroom was newly remodeled and clean, the kitchen was nice, and the space was plenty for two people.  The house was about 15-20 minutes away from downtown Seattle, and there were pockets of nice restaurants/cafes just minutes away so that was nice.  A pleasant experience overall.  There were a few negative points that I think are worth mentioning.  First, the walls are extremely thin, so you’ll hear everything upstairs (Amy walking, microwave, dog walking/playing, dishes, etc.); this can be annoying so be sure to bring ear plugs if you plan to sleep in.  Second, Amy requires that all guests clean up when they leave.  This includes putting all soiled towels by the washing machine, all sheets must be taken off the bed, and all trash must be taken out of the house.  I thought this should be included in the cleaning fee which is pretty steep ($100).  Third, the refrigerator makes a lot of noise, so this can potentially keep you up at night (alongside a small flashing smoke detector above the bed); but if you’re not sensitive to these things, you should be alright.  Besides these things, everything else was fine.  Amy even threw in a free bag of chips and popcorn.  "
748526,37855462,2015-07-11,2190019,Aya,"Convenient location, we had a pleasant stay :) "
748526,39002947,2015-07-20,32524854,Sandra & Jürg,"Amy is very friendly, nice and uncomplicated. She had our stay very good organized."
748526,39922061,2015-07-27,31988042,Brett,"Wonderful place, well kept and comfortable. Amy provided everything we needed, no issues at all. Would stay there again. Just be a little careful if you're exceptionally tall about booking - low ceiling in a few places."
748526,40488864,2015-07-31,800014,Leia,"Amy was a great host. Although we never met in person, she was very easy to communicate with via text. The apartment was just as described. It was updated, clean, private & comfortable. There are now privacy blinds in the windows and the smoke detector does flash at night but it didn't bother us. It is a basement apartment so you will hear the noises from up above (walking & getting ready in the mornings) but nothing that ear plugs can't fix. The place is nicely decorated and feels very secure. There are so many good restaurants nearby in Ballard that we frequented while we stayed here. I would definitely stay here again. "
748526,45235735,2015-09-01,25617432,David,The studio apartment was just as described and Amy made the whole process very easy. We stayed for the month of August and the location was perfect for seeing Seattle.  The neighborhood was quiet with plenty of parking. Many places were in walking distance (we loved the Barking Dog Alehouse around the corner). The bus to Freemont and downtown was close by. 
748526,45964521,2015-09-07,12397236,Kimberly,"Loved staying at Amy's Mother-in-Law Studio. Very convenient and close to many tasty options. So glad we had a fridge to store some of our edibles and relax in between work and running around. Got a peek at her cute little french bulldog Harvey! We would not have known there was a dog living upstairs as it was very peaceful. Thank you so much, Amy!"
748526,50668121,2015-10-13,42479608,Chalanda,"I loved my stay at Amy's place in early October! The apartment was so cute and comfortable, the description and pictures of it were spot on and it was equipped with everything we needed.  The neighborhood was really nice and we loved that there were plenty of places to eat at within a few blocks.  Amy also gave us some great recommendations.  The downtown area was close by so we couldn't have asked for more.  This was my first Airbnb experience and it won't be my last.  Thanks Amy for making it a great one!"
365550,1038264,2012-03-24,1360820,Sabrina,"The Loft is beautiful and centrally located. Even though we only stayed one night I would highly recommend staying at Jaq's and Dirk's place.  They have a guidebook with recommendations on food and coffee. Being a coffee addict, the advice to go to Zeitgeist was on the mark!"
365550,1072872,2012-04-02,294686,Nicole,"I really enjoyed my stay here and would definitely recommend it to others! Dirk & Jaq were very well organised, and provided lots of useful information before I arrived and once I was there (very good list of recommended cafes and restaurants nearby). The space is very clean, private, comfy mattress, plenty of space to work and store belongings, and overall very quiet. It was easy to get to and from the airport, and I was able to walk downtown to the convention centre in about 30 mins, which was perfect."
365550,1090526,2012-04-06,1932051,Alannah,"We really appreciated our stay here. Loft was safe, clean, quiet, and lots of privacy despite other tenants. Everyone we encountered was nice and respectful. We didn't get to meet Jaq or Dirk but they were friendly and accommodating over the phone, even going above and beyond to leave maps & instructions (bus routes were super helpful!) and get the room ready for check-in early for us. Overall, an awesome stay in a perf location. Great place to call home and crash at the end of our long days adventuring and battling downtown parking. So glad we didn't stay at hotel. This was our first airbnb experience. Thanks for making it so easy. We'd love to come back, if they'll have us :)"
365550,1115391,2012-04-12,1926140,Katelyn,"We had a wonderful stay at Jaq and Dirk's art loft. The place was clean, new and comfortable. It was nice being closely located to the downtown core. It was an easy and short 5 min bus ride to the main downtown attractions. The city buses were free in the downtown core from 6am-7pm so that was a plus! (I think this is only until the end of Sept though). Being in the international district, there were some great places to eat. Jaq and Dirk have put together a binder with some suggestions.
I definitely recommend this place! You will love it!"
365550,1139098,2012-04-16,2059479,Jody,"Great location and great space. Dirk and Jaq seem to have thought of everything. I really appreciated the personal touches and welcome book. The space was very clean, modern and comfortable. We had no issues finding free parking. "
365550,1143188,2012-04-17,542548,Shary,"Great location ;-)
Immaculately clean!
Quiet and Restful
Fabulous linens
"
365550,1170711,2012-04-23,1596315,Jonas,"Dirk and Jaq's contemporary art loft #2 is an exceptionally cool and affordable space. The room was very clean and comfortable, as was the shared bathroom and kitchen. The skylight above the bed even let in beautiful morning sunshine. My girlfriend and I happened to meet Dirk outside the building and we had a great conversation about the varying art scenes of Seattle and Vancouver, and we hoped to catch the opening at his gallery. Next time! We will definitely be recommending this space to our friends. This is an exemplary airbnb listing."
365550,1212835,2012-05-01,1833041,Sarah,"Thank you Dirk and Jaq for such a pleasant stay in this very comfy room. Everything was clean, the communication with you easy, your advices and recommendations helpful and great. We loved the arty and creative atmosphere. So, any time again! "
365550,1223396,2012-05-03,81312,Nick&Mini,"Really smart, clean and in a great location. The quirky setup where you share a kitchen and bathroom with people working in the building worked just fine for us too.
Just a few minor things worth noting: 
- The only window in the room is a skylight directly above the bed which has no blind so it gets quite bright early in the morning.
- I was also woken by the heavy doors slamming out in the corridor a couple of times.
To be fair though, both these points may say more about me as a light sleeper! It's a great place and definitely worth the money considering the location."
365550,1235132,2012-05-06,524866,Karolina,It was a very comfortable stay at the art loft. Dirk and Jaq have done a great job with the space and everything was as described. The kitchen and bathroom were both clean and the building was quiet during our weekend stay. I would definitely stay again on my next visit to Seattle!
365550,1263286,2012-05-11,2212496,Charlie,Ideal spot in downtown Seattle. 10 minute walk to Safeco Field. We would stay there again. Very nice.
365550,1272267,2012-05-13,2185768,Leslie,"My husband and I had a wonderful stay at the loft. Dirk and Jaq are very gracious, easygoing hosts. I enjoyed talking with Jaq and playing with their adorable Cocker Spaniel, Ted! Everything you could possibly need is provided, down to the last detail.  I didn't want to leave the bed, ever! The building is clean and quiet. We rarely saw anyone else and never had to wait to use the bathroom. The location is very convenient- only a block away from public transport, but we actually walked almost everywhere. The next time we find ourselves in Seattle, I'd love to stay there again. "
365550,1278513,2012-05-14,59138,Nia,This was a great stay! Very convenient in the free ride zone and a quick under-10 minute walk to Pioneer Square...also walkable to the waterfront and Pike Place Market if you have it in you. The only thing I wish I'd known was to bring an eye mask for sleeping as the bed is right under a skylight and it gets bright in the morning...nice view of the stars at night though! Overall Dirk & Jaq make the whole thing very simple...highly recommended!
365550,1283536,2012-05-15,542548,Shary,Thank you again for sharing your great space!  My husband and I enjoyed our visit to Seattle.  We appreciated being walking distance to Pier 52 and the ferries.  Went to Bainbridge Island with friends for dinner and walked back to the loft.  Awesome!
365550,1308909,2012-05-20,2042753,Jeff,"We loved our stay in Seattle!  The loft itself is comfortable, unique, and very very very well kept.  The location is absolutely phenomenal, with all of downtown as well as Pike's Place a short walk away.  We were there on our honeymoon, and Dirk and Jaq had left some gifts in the room waiting for us to congratulate us.  When we come back to Seattle, we would DEFINITELY like to stay there again.  We loved staying in their studio! "
365550,1319351,2012-05-21,2267155,Nate,"Great place for a weekend. The shared kitchen and bathroom are very clean, the bed awesome, and the hosts very friendly. I recommend taking the ""Bolt Bus"" if you're visiting from Portland, as the fare cost me less than $10 dollars round-trip ($1 each way to be specific) and the bus stop is a block from the front door of Dirk and Jaq's building. Overall, great place to stay for a weekend!"
365550,1371035,2012-05-29,900395,Cathryn,"As hosts, Jaq and Dirk have been wonderful throughout our stay, making sure we had everything we needed and that our room was comfortable for us. Actually, the room looked exactly as it is on these pictures, and we were surprised by how well-lit it is; even though there are no windows, the skylight did much to make such a small space feel warm and cozy, and less depressing. 

I also have to note how wonderfully accommodating they were to my friend who drove all the way from Spokane (about 3+hrs away) to visit us while we were in the city. By the time we finished dinner, it was too late for her to drive alone all the way back. Fortunately, Jaq was understanding enough to let her spend the night with us.

Location-wise, their studio is great! Although it does seem a bit shady when the sun goes down, but we weren't bothered at all walking back from the major bus station in the wee hours of the morning. Our friend had a car, and parking was relatively easy to find for her. You may have to drive a little to find a spot, but compared to LA's parking situation, it isn't all that bad. Also, if you're a big Japanese/Asian food fan, there are so many options around! 

Finally, they have a really cute and friendly dog roaming around their studio. If you have the chance, and Jaq is around, you should take a little peek at their studio to see all the cool things they're creating. A couple of their artwork grace the walls of the room, which adds a nice touch to the space.

Overall, we've been extremely happy with our stay! You'd be hard-pressed to find any better (and wallet-friendly) in Seattle."
365550,1419851,2012-06-05,560646,Edwina,The loft was great. Very clean and perfect for couples or solo travelers looking to stay in Seattle. Highly recommend and would stay there again.
365550,1447717,2012-06-10,1548469,Donna,"Dirk and Jaq were amazing! What a beautiful and clean space. Wonderful place for a person to stay in Seattle. The area is very diverse yet so amazing, so many great places to eat, shop and adventure to! I highly recommend the loft, it was a great experience. "
365550,1470566,2012-06-12,2542145,Sharon,"Everything was great! We don't have one negative thing to say. We'd stay here again in a heartbeat. Great location for us since we were on the Amtrak train. It was in walking distance of a bunch of touristy stuff. We were there on a Sunday and it was pretty dead in the streets surrounding the place, but no matter. The place was extraordinarily clean. And neat as a pin. And talking briefly to Kathy, one of the artists in another portion of the building, as a nice treat too. Thanks so much.
  "
365550,1505007,2012-06-18,2259916,Lealan,I only met Dirk and Jaq briefly but they were very hospitable and resourceful. The loft was in a perfect location to explore the International District of Seattle. Worth the visit. 
365550,1520907,2012-06-19,2650531,Daniel,"My friend and I spent a night at Dirk and Jaq's loft in Seattle. We both thought it was perfect for us. It is conveniently located for walking downtown, it was clean, comfortable and safe. It has high ceilings, a clean bathroom with shampoo supplied, a common area  prepare food with a shared fridge and table and chairs to sit and eat. Dirk showed up a few minutes after we arrived and found a free street parking spot for me 1/2 a block away where I parked for the 2 days I was there. It was perfect for us. "
365550,1540374,2012-06-23,2064889,Paul,Perfect location! Very clean and comfortable. Only wish we could have visited some of the artists and seen their work.
365550,1558172,2012-06-25,2507220,Elaine,"Wow! It was a very clean and well kept place. Sharing the bathroom with the other guest was no problem either. I loved that we had a fridge and other things to share (which is not available in hotels). The price was REALLY good for it's (email hidden)e trains and downtown was really closeby. The bed, as others have mentioned, is comfortable! I was so disappointed to come home to my old mattress. Oh, and the skylight was awesome. Highly recommended!"
365550,1581766,2012-06-28,1805368,Michelle,Perfect location in Chinatown next to all public transportation. Loft was very clean and comfortable. Would definitely stay again.
365550,1600364,2012-07-01,2086587,Malte,"For a visitor who wants to cruise around in seattle  all day the place is quite well. Located near Downtown, you could easyly walk. Everything inside is arranged quite well. 
But  for rainy afternoons its not so perfect, cause the Loft has no window."
365550,1620186,2012-07-03,2249624,Maren Rael,"Great place, comfortable and clean, in a convenient location. Quiet inside the room. A great value."
365550,1628035,2012-07-04,2219093,Fiona & Fook,"The place was just 10 minutes walk from the Seattle Amtrak station yet it is not an a noisy location. The place was situated in a quiet location giving us a good night sleep. Dirk & Jaq's place was designed wonderfully. There is internet, cable TV, clean bathrooms, toiletaries, for guests' use. They had considered everything they wanted themselves if they were travelling guests. The place is easily accessible to downtown areas like Pike Place. Highly recommended."
365550,1636976,2012-07-05,2504929,Marion,"Nice little loft, comfy bed and handy to train station which suited us. Great Japanese cafe accross the street."
365550,1665011,2012-07-09,451269,Zhou,"Great little place, perfect for our short stay in Seattle. Everything was clean and cozy, and the location was very close to the Link and bus lines."
365550,1752530,2012-07-20,2138220,Patrik,"I and my friend stayed at Dirk and Jaq's place for no less than ten nights. The place was great and  convenient. I met Jaq on a few occasions and she was a very kind person and hospitable host (she rapidly replied regarding questions we would have, in my case on how to find specific spots in the city). The place was very neat and the facilities were fresh – the restroom/shower was very clean and the kitchen was good for when you wanted to make yourself some breakfast (not included, but there was no problem in buying stuff and keep in the fridge). Wifi worked flawlessly. The location is also great – it is very close to the International District/Chinatown station, where you'll find connections to other parts of Seattle as well (buses, as well as the light rail which goes to/from SeaTac). 
"
365550,1762931,2012-07-21,2729273,Christa,Dirk and Jaq are easy and quick to communicate and they have a pincode-keybox which makes it easy to arrive any time you want. they recommended a japanese restaurant - maneki - where we actually had the best japanese food on our whole four week trip! maybe a downside: the room has no window alas no fresh air...
365550,1787834,2012-07-24,1750509,Katie,"This is our second time staying at the artists loft (first time in this unit) and just like last time our stay was great. Dirk & Jaq are so friendly and accommodating.  The other artists that are resident in the building are also very nice.  The place is spotless, comfy bed and pillows, etc.

Great stay!"
365550,1838674,2012-07-30,2733138,Erin,"This was a great place to stay.  I'm a fan of a connected bathroom, but that's my issue.  I met Jaq and her cute doggy and they're just amazingly sweet and kind.
Getting used to the skylight above the bed was both cool and a little disconcerting.  This was a great place to stay, quiet and convenient, clean and comfy--super generous.  I hope I'll get a chance to stay again and enjoy even more."
365550,1867359,2012-08-02,2129768,Yvette,"Best air bnb experience yet!! I would absoultely recommend this apartment. Great location. Lovely little room.  Big comfy bed. Great value! The shared bathroom was always free when we needed it and was the best bathroom we're experienced in USA (including hotels). Very clean and well stocked with thoughful supplies. Very close (2mins walk) to train station that took us straight to the airport. Very tasty Japanese restaurant right outside the door. Bring travel eye masks if you want to sleep in later as the skylight is quite bright in the mornings. The hosts were very friendly, let us store our luggage there for the day after we checked out as we had a late flight out. Checking in was a breeze thanks to the lock boxes outside. Thank you verty much!!"
365550,1891104,2012-08-05,2002132,Aurore,"We stayed three nights in the studio and found it wonderful!It was just what we needed to recharge our battery. Super comfy bed, very clean studio. The bathroom and the kitchen contain everything one needs for a short stay! The studio is located minutes away from Int'l District."
365550,1924065,2012-08-08,2716078,Debra,"I had a wonderful stay at the artist loft 2. The room was clean and had the most comfortable bed for my over walked body. I am grateful that Jaq & Dirk allow for one night stays. It was easy to access and always quick return on communications. Within walking distance to downtown attractions, I chose to do all the walking, there is excellent transportation from this location. I left it one star short of perfection only because it was not sound proof. But that would not keep me from booking again, thank you Jaq."
365550,1930920,2012-08-09,1851702,Dustin,Wow Dirk & Jaq have it down!  If Airbnb had the ultimate host award I would be nominating them.  They have everything so well organized making for a stress free wonderful stay.  Great space and great location.  If ever I need a place to stay in Seattle  they will be the first people I contact!  The loft bed was one of the most comfortable beds I have ever slept on in my life...seriously.  Thanks again you guys!
365550,1939876,2012-08-10,2360935,Nik,"
I would definitely book the loft again.

I found the room, kitchen area and bathrooms to be of a very clean and enjoyable style and atmosphere. Even the colors of linen and towels appear to be carefully chosen. The bed was comfortable.

The location was perfect for me as well, within a short distance to central public transport spots and within an area of good and affordable restaurants.

While I have met neither Jaq nor Dirk, communication was especially quick and friendly.

The lack of sound-proofness (activity from the corridors and kitchen area can be heard almost unfiltered) had only little impact on my stay, but means that having a quiet night depends somewhat on the other room's guest. However, the overall impression is extremely positive!"
365550,1954528,2012-08-12,2266060,Saira,"We loved staying at Dirk & Jaq's! The place is on walking distance to all tourist attractions (15 min). 
It's clean and you can use their fridge and wi-fi. We went there on a Friday and Saturday morning the whole place was quiet. The room is in an office building. Overall we enjoyed our stay. It was easy to reach Dirk and Jaq by sending them a message through airbnb. They replied quickly. "
365550,1964218,2012-08-12,3137200,Zahi,"Dirk and Jaq where very accommodating and friendly.  The room and the common areas (kitchen and bathroom) were clean.  They were even responsive late at night. The location is good, and the room was very nice.  I would definitely stay there again and recommend it to friends. 
"
365550,1991565,2012-08-15,1527996,Claudia,Great place to stay in Seattle. Very close to Seattle Downtown (walking distance). Very clean and comfortable. Thanks a lot to you two!
365550,2009166,2012-08-17,2503035,Kim,This was the most amazing room! My husband can't stop talking about it. Right downtown but a comfortable distance from all the hustle of the 'touristy' areas! Beautiful building and wanderfully appointed room. Dirk and Jaq really go the extra mile to make sure everyone is comfortable. They even had a bathrobe in the rooms! It was a really neat little loft with a skylight and a super comfortable bed. Such a neat experience. Totally recommend.
365550,2026364,2012-08-19,744502,Wolfgang,"I stayed 2 times with Jaq +Dirk. These hosts are one of the most gracious, easy -going and generous hosts you""ll ever meet. I was able to check in way earlier than normal both times.They assisted me in figuring out how to get to a far away township by bus. They even accepted a huge bulky delivery for me from Texas and stored it for me weeks before my arrival. The spotles appartment has ample space and is situated in a quiet, friendly neighborhood downtown. Wi -Fi is very fast. The bed and it's matress are very comfy and you get huge, fluffy towels and  a nice bathrobe to use. Everything is close by, I even walked to the Space Needle twice. The port is just minutes away. 
I felt home and taken very well cared of in a wonderful way. I loved our conversations about art and the art -scene .
I look forward to my next stay! THANK YOU JAQ! THANK YOU DIRK!"
365550,2039213,2012-08-20,394882,Jan,We had a good experience at this place.  It was in a good location and was very clean and the kitchen was easy to use.  It was comfortable and a good place to stay.
365550,2052226,2012-08-21,2112249,Lisa,"Very cool little loft which offers everything you need and nice extras. Jaq was lovely and very helpful. It was easy to find the apartment and getting into the downtown area was quick and easy also, There is a great feel to the room even without windows and for someone with arthritis I found climbing in and out of the bed loft no problem at all. Generous supplies in the bathroom and everything was ultra clean. I very much recommend staying at the art loft."
365550,2089892,2012-08-25,2871662,Lauren,"Very nice little place in a great location- walking distance to downtown.  Dirk and Jaq were flexible and, though I never met them, were great hosts."
365550,2101123,2012-08-26,3049860,Beth,This was a great place and was at an ideal location.  The bed was amazingly comfortable too. Everything was clean and inviting.  We would stay there again in a heartbeat!
365550,2146451,2012-08-30,2715867,Richard,"Stayed a couple of nights in the artist loft, was basically as pictured, no unpleasant surprises. Would happily stay there again. Jaq was very responsive with our requests and the key system were the main high lights. Tat's deli around the corner is amazing!"
365550,2190293,2012-09-04,2442424,Matias & Christina,"The loft looked just as advertised, and it was really clean and cozy. The kitchen and bathrooms were close to the room, so it was really convenient. The link rail, as well as a ton of bus stops, are not far from the building so we had no problem getting to and from the downtown areas. The other tenants were respectful and we had a peaceful stay.

It was a fantastic little weekend vacation, would go again!!"
365550,2211349,2012-09-05,1313591,Mike," Seattle is a great city with lots to offer, especially the Arts and Entertainment to choose from. Dirk and Jaq's place was okay. Unfortunately or lucky for us we had a stay at a Downtown hotel the night before, King bed suite, bar,  two 42"" TV's, air conditioning, amazing view.... for a whopping $10 more than the ""art loft"". As for the ""art loft"" the place was clean, bed/pillows really nice,  nothing fancy, no windows or ventilation, pretty cool location to look around. Dirk & Jaq were easy to communicate with and timely.  Maybe just a bit to pricey for what you get, anyways just my opinion!     Mike..... Vancouver, BC   "
365550,2221173,2012-09-07,859878,Calvin,"The location of the loft is incredible - a couple blocks from the Amtrak station in the vibrant International District! Walking to Pike's Public Market through downtown was lovely as well. The room itself was cozy - we liked the loft bed a lot! Plenty of instructions from Dirk and Jaq made it clear that they wanted us to have a fun, hassle-free stay!"
365550,2250143,2012-09-10,2995647,Jessica,Accomodations were perfect - clean and easy access. Bed's were incredibly comfortable. I could have stayed longer. 
365550,2285582,2012-09-14,121846,Catherine,"This was a great location for sightseeing- we were also able to get parking pretty easily (compared to New York). Room was clean and everything was as described. Thanks for the easy stay. 

"
365550,2293069,2012-09-14,408668,Nadia,"Dirk and Jaq's loft is in a central location in Seattle between Pioneer Square and the International District.  Their loft was clean, cozy, and comfortable.  The shared bathroom and kitchen were also very clean.
The neighbourhood is very quiet in the evening, which is great for a peaceful night of sleeping.

The bed was very comfortable, but the steps of the ladder to reach the bed were very narrow and a little precarious.

We loved Maneki, a Japanese restaurant, and Zeitgeist, a coffee shop, that Dirk and Jaq recommended.  Maneki was just around the corner from the loft, and they served incredibly delicious food for a very good price.

All in all, my boyfriend and I thought this was a great loft (at a great price) for our stay in Seattle.

"
365550,2300644,2012-09-17,859878,Calvin,"Dirk and Jaq's Art Loft was our Seattle home-away-from-home while we traveled on our honeymoon. The loft is a really great cozy space. Jaq was very communicative, and actually held onto a book I had finished and left behind as we traveled elsewhere, and then gave it back to me when we stayed in her loft again at the end of our trip. Located in a great neighborhood in the International District of Seattle, with lots of great restaurants within easy walking distance, and a cool Asian grocery store nearby too."
365550,2338990,2012-09-18,3503334,Stephanie,We had a wonderful one night stay at the loft. The room was comfortable and extremely clean. The hosts were friendly and helpful. We would definitely stay here again.
365550,2351455,2012-09-20,2861116,Terry,"Cant think of anything to add the positive reviews already here: very clean, well-located, secure, and interesting.  It`s only a few walkable blocks from the Amtrak station, and a short bus ride to the state and international ferry docks.  Worked for me!"
365550,2418750,2012-09-26,1208264,Jon,A wonderfully simple but serene place to rest a weary head. The location cannot be beat -- steps from the light rail and busses -- and walking distance to all of the popular sights. Jaq was very accommodating and responsive to emails and requests. 
365550,2429384,2012-09-27,3416988,Helen,We didn't get to actually meet Dirk and Jaq the one night we stayed at their place in Seattle but the accommodations were lovely and the information they provided beforehand and within the loft was really helpful. The loft is also in a great location for walking around and we didn't get public transport anywhere (except the monorail back from Seattle Center).
365550,2464014,2012-10-01,3055083,Colleen,"A very well run place that is in a great, central location. Owners are very friendly and easy to deal with. Room was exactly as described and how it looked in the photos. A really good sushi restaurant is right underneath the place in the same building. Would definitely stay here again. "
365550,2560102,2012-10-09,1681795,Patrick,"My friend Jackson and I were visiting Seattle for 4 days/3 nights and we had an awesome experience. The loft is located in the international district within walking distance to delicious restaurants, public transportation, banks, and a large grocery store. My friend and I were able to walk 20 minutes to Pike Place Market which was a gorgeous walk through downtown. 

The loft and the building itself are very well kept and beautiful. We felt very comfortable coming back to our accommodations after a long day of exploring the city. The skylight above the loft where the bed is located provided the room with great natural lighting that was pleasant to wake up to every morning.  The shared common spaces (kitchen and restroom) were well equipped with anything we needed for our stay. 

Overall, we couldn't have asked for a better experience. I would definitely recommend staying here and would love to come back for my next Seattle visit!"
365550,2596213,2012-10-13,3417665,Nikin,"Great hosts, in a great location what more can you ask for.  Love it!!"
365550,2639503,2012-10-17,2357252,Marcelo,We had a Wonderful time  in Seattle. Dirk & Jack's place was just perfect for us because we were travelling by train an the station was really close. The room was clean and the bathroom facilites were great.  I would definitely recommend you their loft.
365550,2653239,2012-10-18,3865658,Stephen,"This is a great space in a great location. It's clean, unique and well appointed. Although I didn't meet Dirk & Jaq in person, communication with them was prompt, helpful and smooth. 

The only slightly cautious note I would make is that this room is beside the communal kitchen. While it's not busy, I'm a light sleeper and was woken up at one point by someone eating after midnight. This is a minor point; I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again.

Finally, if you're driving here—especially a standard—hone those hill starts before you arrive. Especially if you're entering the city by ferry. Perhaps it's because the last time I was in Seattle, I came in by train but man, there are a lot of incredibly steep hills around. Having said that, I managed to score free overnight parking less than 100m from the apt., so no complaints, here."
365550,2694829,2012-10-23,675714,Rebecca,"Amazing value, I had a good experience staying in the artists lofts ... The room was very basic, sparse and clean, as was the bathroom and kitchen. I really liked the location and communication with Jaq and Dirk was smooth and easy."
365550,2723668,2012-10-26,3455118,Noi,"This is a great place to stay! I can actually walk anywhere in the city without using a bus (but with some stops in cafe). And the place was very clean and comfortable, even the shared bathroom was very clean. It looks exactly like the pictures. And there're plenty of things for you to consume in the kitchen. This is really a place for a backpacker."
365550,2751640,2012-10-29,1407685,Kristal,"We enjoyed our stay in the loft space. We traveled by train and arrive only a few blocks away at Kings Station. It's a great location from Downtown and Chinatown, as well as several public transit lines and the light rail. There are plenty of restaurants and shops within a 5 minute walk. The room was a comfortable size and the loft was very sturdy. The bed was extremely comfortable!

One slight downside, The room is right next to the kitchen so you can hear people working their way around the kitchen or going in or out of rooms. It's not much of a problem for deep sleepers, like my boyfriend, but if you can be a light sleeper sometimes, you may want to come prepared with ear plugs or music. 

Even though we never met the hosts in person, they communicated very well. Check-in and entry were smooth and easy.  There was scheduled maintenance work the weekend of our stay but Jaq and Dirk alerted us in advance and had proper alternatives to the water being shut off. Thanks for a comfy stay! We enjoyed our stay in the International District of Seattle!"
365550,2790674,2012-11-03,2291667,Jessie,"Wonderful, calm space in a lively neighborhood. Apartment had excellent amenities, all great quality and like new."
365550,2812626,2012-11-05,2497414,Erin,"Lovely, simple, very clean, easy to find, and helpful flexible hosts. They even allowed us to leave our bags after checking out until our evening flight. 

It is close quarters, so for a stay longer than a weekend I would book elsewhere, but this place was just lovely for our short trip to Seattle."
365550,2848301,2012-11-10,665707,Jaco,"Great place to stay! The location was a short walk to all the necessary sites: waterfront, Pike Place and the Washingtion Convention Center where I was having a conference.  Just as advertised. Really happy with the stay. Highly recommended! "
365550,2859319,2012-11-11,4047588,Terry,"We didn't get a chance to meet Dirk & Jaq due to our busy shopping schedule, but nevertheless, everything we needed to know were written down for us either in the welcome book or stickers around the place. It takes a huge amount of effort and organization to maintain the same level of satisfaction to all travelers. The place looks exactly the same as the pictures and has a great artist's touch in the furniture/decorations. If I were to have any complaints from my one night stay, it might be the combination of the building structure and the downtown location. Although none of it falls in the control of the hosts. Sirens in the nights and noise from doing anything might not be easy for light sleepers like me. Overall, it's still a great place to stay while you are visiting downtown Seattle. "
365550,2892136,2012-11-15,1584705,Sonja,My partner and I enjoyed an excelleny stay at the place. It promised all features and looked exactly as on the picture. One thing to note- the cleanliness and tidy bathroom and sleeping room were impressive. We had never seen a place so tidy. The area easy to commute and close to all sights. The recommended Japanese restaurant offered heavenly food and teh Black cod a must ry. To all: Enjoy! And a big thank you to the hosts for their flexibilty and swift process.
365550,2896488,2012-11-16,841468,Lauren,"My stay was very brief--about 10 hours total. I arrived late in the evening but getting settled in was easy as the place was just as described and everything accessible. And if I was uncertain, there were plenty of post-it notes which was helpful (""Were you just reading my mind?"") and Dirk and Jaq were very clear they were available should I need anything. The place--including hallway and bathrooms--were absolutely clean. The only hiccup I experienced was trying to figure out the key lock in the dark. 

There was a handy book of recommendations on the desk. I ate at the sushi restaurant downstairs which was fantastic and went to the recommended Zeitgeist coffee place a few blocks away which was warm and nostalgic feeling. 

A nice, quiet place to decompress and rest. "
365550,2911778,2012-11-18,3947960,Jane,"I unexpectedly found myself needing a place to stay in Seattle due to a transportation snafu and reserved this loft based on the positive reviews and it's proximity to the area we were. It was very last minute, late in the day and within minutes of booking the space, Jaq had accepted my reservation and responded with detailed information about the place.

The space was really cozy and clean. I loved the loft! The bed and linens were luxurious - truly comfortable. My partner and I were disappointed that we didn't have much time to enjoy the space.. The bathrooms being communal was not an issue at all. There are two bathrooms (one with the shower) and they were both very clean.

I'm so pleased with my airbnb experience and have to say that my stay at this loft was perfect. Thanks again Jaq, you're a life-saver!"
365550,2952701,2012-11-24,4114046,EricZhu,The room was very nice. The location is very accessible to the Link railway to the airport. Within walking distance to the shops in the city.
365550,2977297,2012-11-27,2459890,New,"This space is super cozy and very clean!  It was perfect for our needs as it was very close and central to downtown.  Super easy to walk to pike place market, downtown shopping, great bakeries and coffee shops and Capitol Hill.  Hosts were super helpful and responded to any questions we had.
We stayed 3 nights and never had any issues sharing the bathroom with other occupants.
Noteworthy is that it is not super easy to sleep in as you can hear people in the kitchen (as it's directly outside the room.)  If you're tall and want to stand up in the loft bedroom... you may want to rethink this BnB as there is very little room up there.
It was a great value and we will def' come back to this BnB when we hit Seattle again.
Thanks so much!  "
365550,3012065,2012-12-03,1965438,Jill,Clean accommodations. Conscientious guidance on how to get into the building and recommendations for a pleasant stay. We didn't meet Dirk and Jaq but they seemed like top notch people. Great neighborhood.
365550,3050833,2012-12-09,4029003,Crystal,The space is incredible for the price and location. We had a concert to go go Friday night and had no trouble finding parking near by and then walking further into downtown. It was a short walk to Pike Place in the morning as well.
365550,3056577,2012-12-11,3213744,Kristina,"This was our first airbnb experience and it was wonderful! The apartment is in a great location- only a short walk from the train station. It is also located near Chinatown/Japantown so great for getting food- there are many restaurants nearby. Its also quite easy to walk to many of the sights from here. The apartment is very quiet, clean and has everything you want. Dirk & Jaq have left helpful posti-ts around the place to help you figure everything out. "
365550,3105919,2012-12-17,1359704,Tori,"Fantastic location & nice, simple, clean apartment. Easy communication with Jaq + Dirk. All amenities provided. Had no trouble finding free parking for the whole weekend. "
365550,3204571,2012-12-31,887090,Karl,Very friendly and a nice little studio. Good design. Right near the center of things!
365550,3238519,2013-01-03,565141,Adina & Duncan,Good for short stays and centrally located. Comfortable bed! 
365550,3307813,2013-01-08,3255735,Erika,"Our stay at the art loft was fabulous. We were in Seattle for a conference at the convention center downtown, and the location was very convenient, with easy bus access to the convention center and nearly everywhere else we wanted to go. The space itself was very clean and cozy, with everything you might need on vacation. Since the loft is located in a shared space, there was some noise at odd hours of the night, but nothing a pair of ear plugs can't remedy. There are tons of great restaurants nearby. We never got to meet Dirk & Jaq, but they were quick to respond to all of our messages and to ensure that we had a good stay. Overall, we recommend this space highly, and would come back again!"
365550,3325779,2013-01-11,3866251,Jackie,"Nice hosts, the place was clean and looks just like the picture.  It was fairly quiet, not super busy with people even with the common shared spaces.  Thank you for letting us stay at your place."
365550,3345835,2013-01-14,4271188,Stephen,"Great hosts, excellent accommodations just as advertised. Perfect for my quick trip in and out. Looking forward to a return visit!"
365550,3362611,2013-01-17,4422169,Marie,"What a great place! Check in/out is super convenient and the place itself is very clean, spacious and very thoughtfully equipped (umbrellas and ipod dock, awesome!). You should know that the bed is on the upper level. You can't stand upright there because of the low ceiling - but this didn't bother us the least.
I doubt you will find a better place in downtown Seattle for that price and can wholeheartedly recommend the loft! Bonus: The fantastic sushi place right next door and the one block walk to the light rail & bus station.
"
365550,3425084,2013-01-28,4203935,John,"This was my first stay at an AirBnB and it was awesome. Dirk and Jaq were great about communicating how to do everything from check-in to checkout. The room itself is super clean and very nice. I didn't see another person during my stay, but was at a conference most of my 2 days in Seattle. I highly recommend staying here."
