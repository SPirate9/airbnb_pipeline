6671901,36122083,2015-06-25,27808904,Rex,Great spot!  Close to everything. Would definetly recommend to anyone looking for a place in Seattle!!
6671901,36702559,2015-06-30,30987597,Sini,"The apartment was very nice and clean, and the location is just perfect, within a walking distance to space needle and pike's market! "
6671901,37077304,2015-07-04,2021007,Jenny,"Amy's apartment is in a truly fantastic location. We were able to walk to many close sites like the market, ferris wheel, and several downtown restaurants. The only downfall was that it was very hot in Seattle when we were visiting and the apartment has no air-conditioning and the windows are not easy to open/are right on the street. However, Amy was very hospitable and brought us a fan after our first night for the rest of our stay. Additionally, while the listing states it can accommodate 5 people, it would certainly be much more comfortable for 4 adults. The last bed is a small pull out couch- probably much more suitable for a child. We stayed as 5 adults for a few days and it was a little cramped. Overall, Amy was very responsive and hospitable and we certainly appreciated everything she did to help make our stay as comfortable as possible!"
6671901,37484708,2015-07-07,6057277,Heather,"This is my first negative review. We had booked a two night stay for three people. First of all the ""futon"" bed is actually a foam couch which, when folded out has two foam parts and a hard wood section so your head or feet are on a hard surface. One of us slept on the floor instead. In the morning we had no hot water so at 8 am I contacted Amy and told her we were relocating. I asked that she refund just the second night. I did not argue over cleaning fee or the first night. She contacted me after 11am to say she had hot water at that time so would not provide any type of refund. Yes things can go wrong but a host should work with you to find a reasonable solution. This was not the case with Amy."
6671901,38508876,2015-07-16,25715194,Dustin,"I had a great time in Seattle staying at this apartment. Amy was responsive during my stay, and she definitely wanted to make sure we were comfortable. The location of this apartment is great for exploring the city and is in walking distance to many restaurants, stores, pikes place market, the shore etc. The main downsides of this apartment are that the windows face the street so you can hear peoples conversations as they walk by the building at night and that the apartment is older and could benefit from some renovation. For a few night stay, it is a great location and comfortable enough. We enjoyed Seattle!

Thanks Amy! "
6671901,38733385,2015-07-18,35557907,Roger,Amy was great. Answered all of my questions very promtly & everything ran smoothly. The location was fantastic & the rental was very comfortable. 
6671901,39314221,2015-07-22,4604280,Janne & Tyler,"Great stay at Amy's flat in Seattle!  It was easy to find,  and a great location and value.  Just a few minutes walk from Pike Place market.  Since the apartment is located on street level,  we would recommend bringing ear plugs in the summer months.  While we didn't get to meet Amy, we communicated with her digitally and we would recommend the space to Seattle visitors!"
6671901,41951535,2015-08-10,34954198,Kurt,Couldn't really ask for a better location. Amy's apartment is great and she prepared it nicely for us. If available for next trip to Seattle I would definitely stay again. 
6671901,42874367,2015-08-16,37081004,Nicole,"I stayed here with my friend for a girls weekend trip and it was perfect!! The location was great and the apartment was nice and clean. Amy was very kind and accommodating. Our flight landed well before check-in and Amy let us drop our bags off early, which was extremely helpful. We didn't have any complaints and would definitely stay here again!!"
6671901,45599393,2015-09-04,10776573,Jeremy,"Fantastic location in the heart of Seattle. Just a few blocks walk from Pike's market and other interesting destinations on the water front. Apartment was very clean. Plenty of sleeping accommodations for two adults and two children. It is first floor in the city so if you are not used to that it could be unnerving. But we enjoyed our stay very much, and this was the perfect home base for our adventures."
6671901,45780511,2015-09-06,11928179,James,"We didn't meet Amy in person, but all communication was excellent. The apartment was quite basic and the shower was a bit temperamental but for a couple of nights in an excellent central location it was great.  "
6671901,46485220,2015-09-11,38292679,Abby,We really enjoyed our stay at Amy's downtown condo in Seattle. The location was exactly what we were hoping for- we had great and easy access to all the sights we wanted to visit around town. We easily walked to places such as the market and the ferry station. Amy was very easy to contact and quick to respond with any questions we had. Our flight wasn't leaving until late in the evening so she even worked it out for us to leave our bags at the condo while we explored a bit more. It was such a huge help and greatly appreciated!  I would recommend this place to anyone that really wants to be in the heart of downtown! 
6671901,47041897,2015-09-15,16815481,Greg,"Home was much larger than expected. As the previous reviews said, LOCATION, LOCATION, LOCATION!!!
We had a blast walking to every single attraction that we wanted to see. Thanks Amy!"
6671901,47307180,2015-09-17,43431885,Paul,"Nice property, great location.  The apartment does face the street, and the windows don't seem to be completely sealed, so there is a bit of street noise.  Key pickup/dropoff was simple."
6671901,47644041,2015-09-21,22854271,Stacy,"Comfortable and clean apartment. Great location-very close to downtown, the Pike Place Market, and lots of great restaurants. I felt safe walking back alone after dark, since there are several restaurants nearby. One caveat-the apartment faces the street and is quite noisy, so it might not work for light sleepers. 
Amy was a very accommodating host, I was able to drop off my bags early and check out late. "
6671901,48460648,2015-09-26,3034785,Sam,thank you! great location and easy experience.
6671901,48687281,2015-09-28,2720696,Kathy & David,"Lovely downtown location--the building is historical and quite charming.  Fortunately, we were in a conference all weekend, and other than sleeping and changing clothes, we were out and about.  Overall, we were very disappointed with the amenities  and comfort level of this apartment.  First, there was no hot water available, so a shower or bath was out of the question.  We informed the host, Amy, who responded to us 6 hours later, noting that they have been trying to ""remedy"" this problem for awhile.  As owner of two vacation rentals myself, I found it completely unacceptable to not inform your guests PRIOR to their stay so that we could have made other arrangements.  The bathtub looked to be from the 1930s--it was badly stained and worn to the point where there was no way you would want to step into it (it just doesn't cost that much to refinish a tub like this).  The mattress was of very poor quality, and the bedding was thin and not comfy at all.  If you wanted to just sit and chat, there's also no comfortable chairs.  (The futon/couch was very flimsy and not supportive for sitting.)   The listing did notate that there was internet, but none was available--Amy did leave a note for guests to explain this.  

Also, it may be important to also note that this apartment is VERY noisy, and faces 4th Avenue, just above street level.

"
6671901,49596525,2015-10-05,13029926,Adrienne,"Location was amazing!! We were attending a conference super close by and it was within walking distance of most of the things we wanted to do while in Seattle. I didn't meet Amy but contacted her about the wifi (we couldn't get it show up on our phones) and she was very responsive. The place is clean and was the perfect size for us (4 people). The street noise did wake me up a few times but eventually I was so exhausted nothing could have woken me up! We liked the charm of the older place. Overall, I would definitely stay at Amy's place again!"
6671901,50097817,2015-10-09,43971589,Jason,"The host had clear instructions on how to enter the complex and have access to the keys. The location is perfect since it's a few minutes walk to Pike Place Market and downtown. We also walked to Space Needle/Chihuly Glass Museum and to the pier for the Bainbridge Island. The place is clean and has a comfortable bed and cable tv. Just a FYI, this Airbnb is on the first floor and the walls are thin so you'll hear people talking outside your window. 

My two complaints are the cold water (seems like the hot water ran out?) and the slow internet. I had to depend on my cellular data as a hotspot to access internet more readily. Besides that, I highly recommend this Airbnb to see the main attractions of Seattle since this place is really in the best convenient location."
6671901,51089655,2015-10-17,31251901,Yuji,"The location was great. mid of major travel points.
Room was clean. Host Amy was really friendly."
6671901,51943146,2015-10-25,6979200,Emily,"I stayed with my boyfriend at Amy's apartment during our trip in Seattle. As tourists the area couldn't have been better, it was a 5 min walk to Pike, and a 10 min walk to Capitol Hill. The check in was a breeze, and a huge bonus was a hand written note from Amy with the wifi password. The apartment is spacious, clean, and adorable. I would recommend it 100%. "
6671901,52430867,2015-10-29,28198024,Nicholas,"Great location minutes walk to space needle etc, marketplace anywhere in downtown area.  Great restaurants right adjacent to apartment.  The space was great large area and kitchen all worked great for cooking meals. Awesome fold away table.  Lots of blankets and pillows and towels provided.  The host had awesome toys there for our kids that provided hours of entertainment.   Unfortunately the hot water wasn't existent in the mornings and was only Luke warm at night.  Also the Internet did not work as advertised.  The wifi router seemed to be located in an adjacent apartment that was too far away for a reliable connection.  The apartment also could have been a bit cleaner.  In all though a great experience thanks Amy!"
6671901,52858460,2015-11-02,42494005,Lillian,"The location of Amy's place is perfect for exploring Seattle attractions - it's within a few blocks of Pike Place Market and walking distance of the Space Needle, Pacific Science Center, EMP Museum, etc!
Communicating with her also went very smoothly, and the place was clean and spacious."
6671901,53490880,2015-11-09,39855943,Erin,"Our hostess was very accommodating and allowed us to store our bags in the apartment after checkout since we weren't flying out until late. The location was fantastic - centrally located and easy to walk to a lot of popular places. However, we experienced a few issues. The water took a full 15-20 minutes to heat up, and my towel had holes in it. The wifi worked our first night, but we weren't able to get on it after that. Finally, the pipes made a lot of noise in the early morning, which made it difficult to sleep. All that said, it was cheaper than any of the hotels in the area, so we were able to use the extra money to enjoy Seattle."
6671901,54244042,2015-11-17,16887261,Paul,"Great location, walking distance to most spots in Seattle.  Lots of good eating choices nearby.  "
6671901,54864663,2015-11-25,11975581,James,Convenient location downtown with the essentials for a fun getaway. Responsive and attentive host. Will be back!
1778989,10411274,2014-02-17,12133538,Sarah,"A very nice apartment.  Convenient location.  We stayed in the guest room, it was comfortable and clean.  Riani was a good host, communicative and friendly. "
1778989,10539012,2014-02-24,11430539,Shanelle,"Riani and Charlie were amazing hosts! This was our first Airbnb experience and we quite enjoyed it. Our arrival into Seattle and into the apartment went seamlessly.  Riani was very welcoming and accomodating. We would definately consider staying there when we come back to Seattle, if it is available! Charming, tidy home in a beautiful building. The spare room is spacious with a large ensuite bathroom. I know many people have concerns about renting just a room in a house but our stay felt like home, and we had a private space to hang out.  Recommended for sure :) - The Canadians "
1778989,10661268,2014-03-02,11726756,Carlos,"Riani is super-friendly and made everything easy. The room was clean, comfy and full of personality, and the attached bathroom gave me ideas of how I want to redo my own. Next time I head to Seattle I will check to see if this room is available before I look anywhere else."
1778989,11153125,2014-03-23,9606639,Yingqiao,"Me and my friend spent our spring break in Riani's place, which is an amazing experience. Riani is so nice and interesting. She has a good taste of music and painting. Her house looks exactly like what the pictures show, beautiful, clean, and cozy. The location is also very convenience. There are gas station, subway, and grocery store around. You can walk to downtown and save the parking fee. Plus, Riani has the cutest dog ever, Charlie! Anyway, great host and great place. We are really glad we choose here."
1778989,11477986,2014-04-04,115631,Blake,"Riani's place looks as good as it does in the pictures... and in some ways even better. The bedroom has an en suite bathroom—such a luxury for a guest room!

Riani was extremely accommodating and made check-in/check-out a breeze.

Note that her dog truly is as large and friendly as she says, so you should be ready for some hairy dog snuggles. Fortunately I was, so Charlie was quite a bonus for me!

Riani is very courteous to mention in her listing that there is city noise, but I didn't hear a thing! The guest room windows faces to the back parking area so it's as close to silent as you can get. That said, the radiator is a classic old one that makes clinking noises, so follow good travel practice and bring ear plugs in case you're extra sensitive.

There's a Zipcar lot just 2 blocks from her place so you can easily get around Seattle.

Overall, highly recommend!"
1778989,11940602,2014-04-19,991530,Mike,Beautiful home in a very convenient area. Riani went above and beyond. She's a great host and a wonderful person and her dog Charlie is absolutely adorable. 
1778989,12542735,2014-05-05,12175054,Alisa,"Riani is a wonderful host.she is very kind,even drove me to the train station in that cold wet morning.and she has really good  taste in interior design,the place is so much better than photos.This was my first Airbnb experience,it was all great,I miss seattle! but sorry for I made a mistake for the check-in time."
1778989,12601465,2014-05-05,5089719,Edith,The reservation was canceled 87 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
1778989,13278396,2014-05-24,12518251,Jason,"Riani is a great, friendly host. Easy to communicate with. The apartment is in a very handy location. She even dropped me off at the light rail station. Thanks Riani!"
1778989,13352114,2014-05-26,4360832,Amanda,"Riani is awesome! She was a great host that suggested some great restaurants and bars that we would of never knew about if it wasn't for the local inside info. She has a great place near everything! Her dog Charlie is the sweetest dog ever, and greets you right when you come in. My boyfriend and I had a great time in Seattle, I would definitely stay with her again. "
1778989,13630798,2014-06-01,15720471,Gabe,"Riani was a great host and her ""puppy"" Charlie is a sweetheart too. The room was nice and quiet and the private bathroom was clean. I would definitely stay with her again."
1778989,13919693,2014-06-08,12830067,Vivian,Riani was a wonderful host! Her adorable dog Charlie was the perfect roommate for our short stay there and we were terribly sad to leave. The room was quiet and clean and the private bathroom was extremely convenient. It's a beautiful apartment in a charming neighborhood. I loved my experience and would definitely stay with Riani again!
1778989,14961456,2014-06-30,12973278,Jake,The location is well situated. You are a short walk to either downtown or capital hill. Riani is really sweet and makes you feel comfortable at her place. I would come back.
1778989,15273242,2014-07-06,37458,Kristine,"Staying at Riani's apt. has been my best airbnb experience thus far. Echoing what other guests have written, she has great interior design taste and it's clear she wants her home to be a haven for her and those staying in the space. She was extremely welcoming and knowledgeable and it was especially helpful that she was always available for questions. The room is a good size, bed is extremely comfortable and bathroom is has an ample amount of space. It is centrally located, less then a ten min. walk to Capitol Hill and about a twenty min. walk down to the Public Market. Another major perk is it's about a five min. walk from a great yoga studio; Live, Love, Flow. Sadly, Charly (her adorable Bernese) was not there at that time so hopefully I can meet her next time I'm in Seattle :)
"
1778989,15375388,2014-07-07,11675778,Brad,"What a beautiful apartment! Riani made the arrival stress-free and parking wasn't an issue (free after six and on Sundays). In a nice neighborhood that was a quick, pleasant and downhill walk to downtown. Thanks Riani, this bnb was a steal "
1778989,16284354,2014-07-24,13672859,Kira,"Riani's place was perfect for what we needed for a 1 day stay in Seattle. We found the room and private bathroom to be comfortable and well-decorated. Riani was extremely quick to respond to any questions we had and she went out of her way to accomodate special requests. Riani's dog Charlie is extremely sweet, friendly and very well-behaved. "
1778989,16466719,2014-07-28,2385959,Ash,"Riani was super friendly and made us feel welcome.  The night we arrived our flight was delayed and not only it wasn't a problem, but she also gave us some food from her fridge for a late dinner!  Charlie girl is one of the friendliest and well trained dogs, loved hanging out with her. We walked to downtown most days, and there was a great cafe and grocery store nearby. We had a great stay with Riani and Charlie."
1778989,17444093,2014-08-12,16910742,Debra,"Riani was a perfect host, easily accessible and comfortable. The location was convenient  for walking and Uber cabs could find us. She responded to text quickly and made the extra effort to make our visit delightful."
1778989,18014405,2014-08-20,9797963,Ling,"We have a great time in this place! Great location, great stay, not to mention there a cute private bathroom in the room, great stay for couple! "

1778989,20064359,2014-09-22,21383105,Michael,Riani was an incredibly gracious and sweet host.  She made sure that I was comfortable and the room was exactly as advertised.  I had the space I needed but also enjoyed discussions with Riani and she had some very good tips on Seattle as well.  I would absolutely rent a room or apartment from Riani again.  
1778989,20391261,2014-09-28,21650888,Raphiel,"We had a wonderful stay in Riani's apartment. It was well decorated and immaculate, the location was great, and the bed was amazing. Also, it was great having a parking pass be included with our stay for such a busy part of the city. These things coupled with great communication from our host made for a perfect trip.

I would recommend this place to anyone.

"
1778989,20537363,2014-09-30,21710043,Stuart,Riani's place was nice. She did a great job communicating prior to arrival and had detailed instructions. It was also in a great location.

What really made our stay was how incredibly accommodating she was. We arrived with only a days notice, and brought along a puppy who had just had surgery and was quite rambunctious compared her beautiful gentle giant, Charlie. Riani was so welcoming the entire time and communicated with us throughout our stay. She invited us to make ourselves at home and it was easy to do so.  On top of all that, the location of her place is hard to match! Our stay went as smoothly as I could imagine."
1778989,25894376,2015-01-28,9491145,Dain And Andrea,"Location, location, location. Honestly, the best thing about this listing is Riani. What a kind, intelligent, thoughtful person. Other things to add: comfortable, firm bed. I was surprised about how quiet it was. I did not hear any ""city"" noises. Charlie is a very well trained dog."
1778989,26939547,2015-02-22,8759543,Ana,"Riani was a great host. I was visiting Seattle on a business trip and stayed in her apartment for 2 weeks. She made it feel like home. Even her dog was great, greeting me when I got home from the office! Those two weeks passed quickly. Next time I'll be visiting Seattle, I'll look for this place again."

1778989,28318184,2015-03-22,15203116,Francesca,I absolutely loved staying with Riani! Her apartment was extraordinarily cozy and interesting to peruse. The bedroom had her beautiful personal touches but still more than enough space to spread out and feel at home. Riani herself is a blast to talk to and hang out with - an absolute perfect hostess who is doing everything right!
1778989,29529881,2015-04-08,29835972,Katie,"What a gem! The room was perfect for our two night stay in Seattle. Riani was a wonderful, active host, considerate, and always available. The location was perfect, quiet and a short walk to all the places we wanted to get to. Loved our stay and would recommend to everyone.  "
1778989,32290469,2015-05-16,2512683,William,"My fiancee and I made a trip to Seattle for a few days and spent the first two nights at Riani's. The location was nicely situated in a quiet neighborhood, away from the crowds, but was still easy to get around to places like downtown and Pike's Place Market (about a 20 min walk). While we didn't have a chance to see or spend too much time with Riani, she was very responsive to all the questions we had. The room was pretty clean and felt very homey, comfortable. The place in general had a very rustic feel to it, with the furnishings and decor, almost like a traveler's time capsule, which is kinda cool. The only downside of the location, not the apartment, is the street parking situation, which Riani did make clear in advance in her listing, but just something to keep in mind if you rent a car. Overall, really good experience and no complaints. "

1778989,35666682,2015-06-21,6461212,Emma,"The apartment was clean and as beautifully decorated as the photos depict. Walking distance to a lot of Seattle attractions. Riani was a lovely, polite and gracious host. She was up for a chat and was an awesome person to get to know!"
1778989,36478852,2015-06-28,8182395,Michelle,"I didn't get to meet Riani during our stay, but we did meet her mom, who was very friendly and welcoming.  Riani also left us a parking pass to use so we could leave our rental car on the street over the weekend.  We loved the unique and interesting decor of the home, and our room was quite comfortable!"
1778989,37152353,2015-07-05,31422050,Yvette,"Great location  - easy walk to town and most places. Quiet at night and the bed was super comfy. Beautiful apartment, very clean and tidy. 

Riani was away but was super quick to reply to our questions anyway and her mum is lovely. Next time hopefully we will get to meet Charlie!"

1778989,42952481,2015-08-16,21382390,Adam,Riani was very nice and welcoming. Her place was perfect for a quick stay. She even let me borrow a steamer to get my wedding clothes ready. 
1778989,43681268,2015-08-21,11389135,Mark,"Riani is awesome. She made me feel very welcome right off the bat, inviting me to join her in her living room to chat as if I were an old friend just returning from a long trip—we actually sat and talked for hours several times! She offered croissants and fresh peaches, even poured me a glass of one of her favorite spirits! She's the ideal host.

The room is great—very cozy (the entire place is quaint and very cute!), and the neighborhood is very nice.

I simply cannot recommend her OR her fine residence more. "

Her place is comfortable and the room is comfortably tucked away for some privacy. The dog is really cute too."
1778989,47298668,2015-09-17,11389135,Mark,"Once again, Riani was an excellent host! Incredibly warm and hospitable, I've made Riani's place my go-to residence when I'm in Seattle. The location is fantastic, the amenities are great—all in all, the perfect Airbnb experience."
1778989,49083984,2015-09-30,16252286,Jon,"Riani was a great host- very friendly, helpful, and accommodating to my erratic schedule over a short stay.  Her apartment is located in an ideal location if your final destination is downtown or Pioneer Square, and there are numerous bus stops a short walk from the front door. "
1778989,49281735,2015-10-02,7966707,Albert,Riana place was very nice and as described in her posting. Easy to find and great location.  I will definitely come back. Thanks Raina!

And Riani herself was warm and welcoming and made our visit feel as if we were visiting a friend. She was available to answer questions, encouraged us to feel at home and use the kitchen and lounge in her living room and made our check in and check outs smooth and stress free. She also gave us great recommendations for veggie restaurants. "
1778989,54950067,2015-11-25,23928876,Bruno,Great location. Very comfortable king size bed with a private bathroom very spacious. Quiet neighborhood and close walk to just about everything in Seattle. I definitely recommend this apartment.

Also the location was awesome, which is close to the Seattle downtown and really convennient for my friend. The room was also nice and comfortmable.
"

Riani's place is extremely comfortable and cozy, not to mention, in a centrally located area that is easy to get around. Would definitely stay here again next time I'm in Seattle! "

A short 15 minute walk to the downtown area. 
Michael and Miranda were amazing hosts offering up places to go to and responded very quickly to texts. Picking me up from the airport was extremely convenient.
The apartment was extremely nice and would strongly recommend it to anyone needing a place in Cap Hill!"
2004931,10393241,2014-02-17,1448173,Tom,"The apartment is just fantastic, You have everything you need and it is just a short walk to downtown Seattle, the location really couldn't be better.

The apartment is fitted out very nicely, with a huge smart TV that was great for watching the Superbowl on. 

All in all i couldn't have asked for more from a place to stay. 

Both Michael and Miranda were on hand right away if i had any questions - I arrived earlier than expected but Miranda was still there to greet me within 5 minutes.

I'll definitely be using this place again next time I'm in town (and hopefully next time will get round to going out for dinner with Michael and Miranda!) 

Thanks again for letting me stay in your wonderful apartment!"
2004931,10693500,2014-03-03,12038000,Sarah,"We had a wonderful stay in Michael and Miranda's place. It is located in the heart of Capitol Hill, near lots of great restaurants and bars, coffee shops and books stores, and the Convention Center was just a ten to fifteen minute walk away. The place itself was really clean and comfortable with a nice balcony, good sized kitchen, and a washing machine. Michael and Miranda were helpful and accommodating without being intrusive, which was perfect. I would definitely stay here again. "
2004931,11487434,2014-04-05,6215412,Seth,"Miranda and Michael were super accommodating and knowing that I had just moved to the area checked in on me as well as providing fantastic food and drink recommendations. The place itself was fantastic, exactly as advertised, and it a perfect location."
2004931,11903393,2014-04-18,1787993,Ian,I loved my stay in this deluxe apartment on Capitol Hill.   It's an amazing location with great furnishing.   Miranda was easy to communicate with and really helped make my stay comfortable.  I'd definitely stay here again!
2004931,12059426,2014-04-22,7546907,Julie,We had a great time on Capitol Hill! The apartment is in a great location. Even though it's on Broadway it was very quiet for sleeping. You can walk to great restaurants and shopping. Miranda was very helpful and thoughtful. The apartment is comfortable and well equipped. I would love to stay there again!
2004931,12283843,2014-04-28,7673969,MeriClaire,This property is fantastic!  Great (email hidden)ry nice accommodations.  Miranda was very helpful and made everything easy on us.  I highly recommend staying here!

Miranda and Michael were both very helpful and accommodating and quickly responded to emails/texts. You could hear some noise from neighboring apartments but it's not an issue. I would strongly recommend this apartment. 
2004931,13664545,2014-06-02,1448173,Tom,"Second time staying in this apartment, and It really can't be beaten for location. I explored the local area a little more this time and you really have everything right on your doorstep. 

As always I knew that anything I needed was just a quick phone call away but the place was set up just fine so I didn't need to bother Miranda and Michael.

If you're looking for somewhere in Seattle, then this is that place - Book it now before someone else does! 

I always know what to expect from booking with Miranda and Michael, It really puts my mind at rest knowing that when I arrive after a long flight everything will be just as expected. 

"
2004931,14225226,2014-06-15,12002519,Carter,"Beautiful apartment. Great place to stay if you are in town for a long weekend. Very good location with lots of security features.

Hosts were always helpful in responding to questions and very accommodating. "
2004931,16704787,2014-08-01,3018728,Nirosha,Mike and Miranda's place was just perfect for my parents... they were right in the heart of Capitol Hill and able to enjoy everything in the surrounding area. 
2004931,17039355,2014-08-06,4017526,Matthew,"Overall we enjoyed our stay at this property.  It is well appointed and central to a number of great restaurants and bars in Cap Hill.  Please note it is located on the third floor and is not air-conditioned.  Therefore if, like us, you stay during a rare stretch of hot weather it can get very stuffy in the apartment, even with the windows open and fans blowing.  Miranda was very responsive to our calls and emails and Bobby provided us a friendly welcome to Seattle when we checked in."
2004931,20409409,2014-09-29,16240062,Crystal,Really nice couple. Great place in a great area. Comfortable and felt like I was a local. 
2004931,20801545,2014-10-05,18254574,Harrison,"My girlfriend and I arrived late at night due to having flown standby, and they were both flexible and gracious in getting us into their unit and making the booking process work for our last minute travel plans. Thanks guys! 

They even invited us to do dinner with them, which we regretfully had to decline because of a pre-planned ferry ride. The ferry ride didn't disappoint, but we were bummed we couldn't make the dinner plans work. Sorry guys! :-(

If I am ever back in Seattle, which I plan to be, this will be where I stay. Mike and Miranda were wonderful hosts! I highly recommend them to anyone looking for a cool spot to stay in a hip and lively neighborhood. "
2004931,21360371,2014-10-15,22116767,Kendall,"Overall, it was a great experience! We felt very welcomed and walking into the apartment felt like home. Miranda was very accommodating and was quick to respond to any of our questions and needs. Location was absolutely perfect too. Everything you could possibly need or want was right close by.  We had a wonderful stay! "
2004931,21636450,2014-10-20,1779604,Damian,"Everything about this apartment was amazing. It has been mentioned several times already, but the location really is fantastic - surrounded by so many great bars, restaurants, shops and even a farmers market across the street on Sundays. There's also easy access to all other areas of Seattle. We biked all over the city and there are protected bike lanes right outside the front door. Miranda is incredibly nice and was kind enough to meet us at the apartment late at night after we arrived from the airport. She made sure we had everything we needed and gave us lots of good recommendations for things to do. The apartment itself is wonderful - beautifully furnished, very clean and has a great balcony to relax on in the afternoons. It also has very fast internet and we were able to use our Netflix account on the huge smart TVs. We'll definitely stay here again next time we visit Seattle in the (hopefully) near future!"
2004931,22349110,2014-11-03,2403288,Alok,"This is my 2nd time staying at one of Miranda's apartments. I'd stayed downtown previously and decided to try cap hill to get a better feel for Seattle. I couldn't have asked for better accommodations.
The apartment was clean and very well-furnished: the kitchen fully loaded with anything/everything, comfortable genuine leather sofas, a 2nd TV in the bedroom, comfortable sheets e.t.c. 

How was the location? Amazing! Perhaps the most central in cap hill. I had a lot of restaurants to choose from. Food was fantastic everywhere I went - quinns, odd fellows, le zinc. Compared to downtown, I enjoyed cap hill a lot more at night. The entire area just seems to come alive. More amenities at night, restaurants, bars, shops are open a lot later. There's even a farmer's market across the street on Sunday. Will definitely come back again and perhaps stay for a week next time! "
2004931,23250747,2014-11-26,20988554,Meredith,"The description was very accurate, and the host was extremely accommodating and welcoming!"
2004931,24072900,2014-12-19,14895927,Brandon,"Great location, amazing view, kind host.  Couldn't ask for more.  The champagne was a nice touch :)"
2004931,24318422,2014-12-25,6430679,Donna,"Really enjoyed the hip location, the useful work desk setup, and the comfortable bed! The apartment has a lot of good sunlight during the day and a lot of ceiling lights and floor lamps for nighttime. A great place with great amenities."
2004931,24734182,2015-01-02,23465607,Jason,"Great apartment in a great location.  Walk to everything including some of the best restaurants in the city.

Check-in and check-out couldn't have been easier.  Instructions were very useful.  

Thanks for the bottle of wine and sparkling cider!"
2004931,26178989,2015-02-06,24774676,Paul,Everything was exactly as advertised.  I stayed there for 5 weeks and it was a perfect home away from home.  I walked everywhere.  Miranda was very responsive to the few questions I had.  The building was quiet and secure.  Plenty of options for food and services all nearby.  I would stay here again.
2004931,27660371,2015-03-09,10646605,Herman,"Mike was a great host and responded promptly to queries. The listing was as advertised and the location was perfect. The neighborhood is fantastic with lots of great bars, restaurants and coffee shops. The bottle of red wine upon arrival was a welcome treat."
2004931,27857057,2015-03-13,10646605,Herman,I enjoyed staying at Eve & Michael's apartment so much I ended up extending my stay. Great location!

2004931,32403418,2015-05-17,7918795,Samee,The apartment was in great condition. We had everything we needed. Eve was helpful in explaining how to get in and out of the secure apartment building. 
2004931,33116948,2015-05-25,18055633,John,"This apartment is fine, but it is expensive considering value received. The location is good, the patio is pleasant, and the furniture is comfortable. The kitchen is sparsely equipped and the bathroom likewise. The host is friendly and communicative. "
2004931,34428405,2015-06-08,23465607,Jason,Great apartment in a great location.  Eve was great with communication and very accommodating with an early check in.
2004931,34960794,2015-06-14,31820478,Nathan,The pace was really clean and nice. Location was great. Only problem was the Wifi never worked. To the owners credit...they were in the phone with Comcast and tried to get it to work....really seemed to be more of a Comcast problem than anything. Great stay and would stay again!
2004931,35432668,2015-06-18,23139571,Kyle,Booking with Eve was so easy and she made the experience an amazing one. She was very accommodating and responsive. We will definitely book with Eve on our next trip to Seattle. Best airbnb experience I ever had.

2004931,36594564,2015-06-29,5008934,Tera,"Beautiful place in an awesome location! Very clean apt and secure building. Close to coffee, food, shopping, Broadway on Capital Hill, and if you're feeling ambitious 20 minute walk to downtown! Would definitely stay here again. Price is very fair!  "

2004931,41271427,2015-08-05,39649723,Ran,"We had a great experience here at this place! Awesome location, only 20 minute walk to pike place market. The amenities in the room are good and most importantly, it's clean. The host Morgan is friendly and responsible! She gave quick responses every time we tried to contact her. In general, we highly recommend this place! "
2004931,42139951,2015-08-11,35738801,Matthew,The unit was clean and hotel-like. Morgan was responsive and welcoming. She did all she could to ensure a 5-star stay. I would recommend.
2004931,43805150,2015-08-22,12560705,Daniel,"Morgan was a great host ~ very thoughtful, considerate, and responsive. I really enjoyed my stay .. its location of the neighborhood was amazing .. so walkable to great food and coffee. Really fun to explore.

The space is super comfortable, with room to spread out. The photos don't do it justice. Really unique views of seattle. Would definitely recommend."
2004931,44266531,2015-08-24,2143830,Michael,Perfect spot!  Super central to everything in Seattle.  Highly recommend.

2004931,46446799,2015-09-10,8821594,Tim,We made a last minute trip to Seattle and found this place. Check-in was easy.  The apt. is in a great location for walking around Seattle.  Parking can be difficult but we found the community college one block away has 24hr parking for $5.00.  The apt. was as pictured and clean.  We would stay here again.
2004931,47085530,2015-09-15,42375991,Margie,"I had a great experience with my first ever Airbnb stay! The apartment was clean and modern just as it appeared in the pictures. The location was great, in capital Hill area of Seattle with lots of interesting restaurants. I've stayed in the city center of Seattle a few times before so this area was a nice change for me. A lot more unique/independent restaurants as opposed to basic chains. It is best if you don't have a car due to parking in the city but there was a public parking garage within a block that was very reasonable. Great place to stay for young or young at heart in a hip area in Seattle. "
2004931,48800979,2015-09-28,815283,Elad,"Overall experience was very positive. Apartment was well located and well equipped with all the amenities as described. Listing photos were of a different apartment with similar characteristics so that wasn't much of a problem.

To improve: 
1) Internet connection was quite slow and reception quality at some parts of the apartment was low. Hosts were very helpful in trying to fix this.
2) TV almost didn't have any channels. Bedroom only had a screen with HDMI cable (good for connecting to my computer if wifi reception was good ;-).

All in all, great alternative to a hotel, both location-wise and convenience."
2004931,49434443,2015-10-04,8875578,Matt,"My girlfriend and I selected this unit for our trip to Seattle. We're very pleased with our experience there. The unit is beautiful, the location is ideal, and Daniela is an excellent host!"

2051658,14557568,2014-06-22,5326024,Peter And Mary,"We checked in at the front desk to pick up our keys and garage remote.  It was great having a parking spot.  That alone is worth about $45/day in downtown Seattle.  

The bldg is in a great location.  We walked one block to Pike Place market every single day.  So much great food there.

The washer and dryer came in handy.  The bathroom was good sized and the balcony was nice though we would rather had the view on the water side vs the  north side.  

Apt is on 7th floor and comes complete with everything you'll need for a week long stay.  Would stay again.  "
2051658,49318520,2015-10-03,34262818,Lori,We dealt with one gentleman from sea to sky rentals who was very kiend on the phone even tgough I never did get to meet due to our delay with arriving.  We picked up the keys in the lobby and followed all instructions given to get in worked out great. Prior to arriving all information was given via email and I felt very confident it would all work out great and it did. 
2051658,51308644,2015-10-19,43732094,Thao,"Wow. I don't even know where to begin. Michelle and her team were beyond amazing. They accommodated to every request I had; from early check-in and checkout to adding a surprise anniversary package last minute. This place was in the perfect location! I couldn't believe how close I was to everything. I was able to wake up every morning and walk around the corner to pikes place for some breakfast! It's also close enough to where you can walk to most of Seattle's main attractions. I would highly recommend staying here if you're looking to stay in the heart of Seattle. If and when I visit Seattle again, I will be staying here. "
3479851,38215960,2015-07-13,15877405,Elizabeth,"Morgan's apartment was charming, and the bed comfy. My daughter slept on the sofa with blankets from the chest by the wall. We didn't use the a/c, but I did use the small bedside fan in the bedroom at night. We boiled water for tea but did no other cooking, and besides the bottle of Washington wine (Thanks!) no food for us in the apt. Bring your own coffee tea sweeteners etc. You are allowed to use the spices and store grocs. in the fridge. Loved the balcony for the sights sounds and fresh air.loved the bakery near apt entrance (Le Fournil), got breakfast there everyday.
Location was good, bus ride downtown(several routes), bus etc transport good here.close to hike and bike across the bridge, also University of Washington campus.
Great stay, highly recommend!"

3479851,44923708,2015-08-30,37892738,Colton,"We had such a wonderful experience! Morgan was friendly and welcoming and kindly answered any and all questions we had,  she even left a written guide for us to consult with about the area. The apartment was perfect! It's minutes from downtown, even while there attending a convention of about 20k people a day we were able to be in Seattle Center in about 15 minutes. The area is nice, we felt safe. The apartment itself is comfortable, beautiful and clean inside. We could not have asked for a better experience. Thank you Morgan! "
3479851,46384166,2015-09-10,38534818,Cameron,"Great hospitality from morgan.

3479851,49009479,2015-09-30,22664344,Rebecca,Morgan was an amazing host and her apartment was great! I kept remarking over and over how I wished I lived in that apartment (and neighborhood). There's a few restaurants nearby and then the University district is just a quick and easy walk away! I would absolutely stay at Morgan's place if I was back in Seattle!
3479851,50109654,2015-10-09,4153917,Katie,"Morgan was readily available to meet me at the apartment, left a bottle of wine, and a lovely place to stay. Clean, well outfitted, great location. Loved the balcony and the sound from city was more white noise than anything else. French pastries and fresh flowers down stairs. Great stay."
3479851,50657968,2015-10-13,17655269,Chris&Jess,"We had an amazing 3 days in Seattle. Morgan's apartment was exactly as pictured, super clean, cozy, and had a lot of personal touches. We drove everywhere, and really liked how close it was to everything - 10 mins away from pretty much anywhere. She gave us a bottle of Washington wine with was very much appreciated, and gave us recommendations as to where to eat and drink. Overall a perfect stay. "
3479851,51123232,2015-10-18,34835929,Melissa,"Morgan's place was even better than expected. She met us when we arrived and gave us a little tour of her apartment and lots of hints on what to do and where to go, how to get there! The apartment is in an awesome neighborhood, we left our car in her designated parking spot without any issue and walked everywhere. It was super clean, great shower and comfy bed! Would definitely stay here again. "

Morgan's apartment was amazing. It was very comfy and cozy which made it feel like home. The location is great and the reserved parking spot is a bonus. I would definitely chose this place again during my next visit.

3479851,55755394,2015-12-05,26881845,Claire,"The apartment was in a great location, very clean and cozy, and morgan even left us a bottle of wine! We were able to walk to a number of restaurants close by, including the places she recommended. Getting around the city from the apartment was so easy! Right next to bus lines and walking distance to a lot of amenities. "
6477225,34492367,2015-06-08,8336715,Jose,Me and my family had an excellent experience on Shawn's place. He was incredibly helpful and available at all times. The place was perfect for our needs and the location is just unbeatable. Would definitely come back!
6477225,35131745,2015-06-15,33160937,Alex,"Shawn's place was perfect for my visit to Seattle. Capitol Hill is great neighborhood with many great restaurants, bars and coffee shops nearby. From his place you could take a quick bus or cab downtown or to any of the other great neighborhoods (Belltown, Ballard, etc). We took advantage of the great weather while we were there and pretty much walked wherever we needed to go. Keep in mind that Seattle is very hilly though, and it's not a typical walk. As a host Shawn has thought of everything, all the way down to providing ear plugs if you're a really light sleeper. When we arrived he was available to make sure everything was taken care of and graciously answered any questions we had. After that the place became our home away from home and wlike definitely stay here again."
6477225,36033049,2015-06-24,12420724,Miriam,"This is a comfortable, well appointed garden apartment.  Despite being in a bustlling urban neighborhood, with a gated entry to a private garden/yard, a private entrance, and the entire apartment to yourself, the space was surprisingly quiet and cozy.  Some noise can be heard from the upstairs neighbors such as footsteps on the floors and stairs above, but it did not disturb us or prevent sleeping well.  The beds were actually quite comfortable and cozy.  Climbing into the one queen bed from the foot as there is no space on either side is a bit of a feat, but once in the bed, it is quite cozy and comfortable and leaves ample space in the room for walking through, suitcases, laundry etc.   Each bedroom had a sizeable closet which was a plus, and a safe for personal belongings was provided.  It's true, light does stream into the one main living/kitchen space making you forget you are in a garden apartment, while the back bedrooms did feel a bit cave like.  Shawn was an excellent host, providing everything neccessary for comfort and offering to assist with any questions or guidance we might need.  His communications were always prompt.  Ceilings are low, there is one spot in the apartment that individuals of 6'3"" would have to duck.   Access to laundry was a real plus, the wireless internet worked excellently, even in the basement and back bedrooms and the entertainment options were very nice.  The private parking space was a huge plus and we would recommend this option for those who have a car in the area.  street parking is really difficult to find.   the neighborhood was walkable, lots of restaurants, a grocery, pharmacy, banks, etc. everything you need within a few blocks.  It is also walkable to downtown.  "
6477225,37064186,2015-07-04,8309614,(email hidden),"This apartment was perfect for our needs.  The kitchen had everything we needed.  We were close to Broadway and the bustle of Capitol Hill.  Shawn was attentive and helpful.  Thanks!
"
6477225,38886043,2015-07-19,8998999,Adi,"We stayed in this apartment 7 nights and felt welcome and comfortable. Shawn is warm and attentive, he took care of everything we needed and was very responsive during the booking process as well as during our stay.
Pros:
- the host is awesome :)
- Location is great. The neighborhood is lively but quiet. Lots of cafes and restaurants in walking distance.
- Very clean, overall well maintained
- Luxurious bedding
- Decent size bedrooms and living space
Cons:
- Footsteps and plumbing in the upstairs apartment are noisy
- Because the apartment is below street level, it can get a bit stuffy. We left the front door open at times to let air in."
6477225,40926583,2015-08-03,35623096,Johann,"Shawn nous a très bien accueilli chez lui. Il a été à notre disposition tout au long de notre séjour en cas de besoin. Le quartier est super avec restaurants, bars, commerces à quelques mètres du logement."
6477225,41946567,2015-08-10,33853992,Daniel,Shawn was a fantastic host who was ready to provide help or suggestions if we needed any. The house itself was great and had everything that we needed.  The location was great within walking distance of lots of cool places.
6477225,43430176,2015-08-19,11912278,Henna,"Loved our stay here! Shawn was a great host. There was a mix-up with the check-in time but he kindly accommodated us. The house was very clean and comfortable, and the location couldn't have been better: quiet, but only two blocks from everywhere we wanted to go. :) Thank you!"
6477225,45493648,2015-09-03,18555870,Mike,Everything here was perfect! The place was spotless and quiet. We had everything we needed within a five minute walk too! Will gladly request again!
6477225,46325388,2015-09-09,10013269,Anja,"This place was fantastic! Great neighborhood, really close to a lot of cool restaurants and shops, but very quiet. You can hear the upstairs neighbors a little bit, walking around mostly, but they're quiet people and there's a big container of earplugs provided in case that keeps you awake at night. It was a wonderful and peaceful haven to return to from my musical festival weekend. 
I loved the keyless entry. No need to worry about who has the keys or have to carry them in your running clothes. "
6477225,55160366,2015-11-28,23788069,Jon,The place was very nice and the pictures are accurate. It was very clean when we arrived as well. And it is located in a very convenient location that's not far from many of downtown Seattle's attractions. It's a great place for anyone staying in Seattle.
6477225,56139811,2015-12-09,40097852,Marco,"Couldn't ask for a better situation. Basement unit, but very cozy; great location, great hosts. "
8517602,48662184,2015-09-27,3062077,Marie,"Jim was an excellent host. We were running late, and he was great about communicating with us and waiting for us to arrive. The house is beautiful and the room was very clean and comfortable. It's in a lovely neighbourhood and Jim had some great local recommendations for brunch. We will definitely be back and highly recommend staying with Jim! "
8517602,49302035,2015-10-02,6182494,Jim,"The bedroom/bathroom/TV room are nice. The house is beautiful and the immediate surroundings are quiet residential with free street parking out front. Then it's only a couple of blocks walking to a load of nice shops, places to eat, etc. and a place to catch the bus downtown - direct/about 20 min. 10 min. on the bus puts you in front of the Space Needle. Host Jim was very helpful and even spotted me my first bus fare! 
"
8517602,49415198,2015-10-03,31975150,Bernard,"This AirBnB was one of the most unique stays we ever had. Jim was such a friendly and carrying host.  He explained everything clearly. 

This place was sparkly clean, SUPER clean, not even dust! we had our own restroom, and a tea room where there is a great view, and a seating to relax and enjoy the peaceful atmosphere. 

The area is very tranquil, but two blocks away is grocery and bars. ideal to spend the night out and just walk back!

three buss lines around the block will talk about 10min or so and your right downtown Seattle! 

I would give this place 10/5 stars, and its definitely worth the money :) "
8517602,49574681,2015-10-04,527969,Luis,"Jim was a gracious and helpful host. His house was comfortable and spotless, and the neighborhood lovely. Jim offered great suggestions for dining and walking. I enjoyed my stay very much"
8517602,50372103,2015-10-11,43228925,Carrie,"Jim was a great host. The house was immaculate. Jim gave me a thorough tour of the living space, it is obvious that a lot of thought has gone in to making the rooms comfortable and welcoming. He was very knowledgeable about the area and available bus routes and restaurants. The reviews and descriptions were accurate. Would absolutely recommend it to others and would use this listing again if I am in the area."
8517602,50584689,2015-10-12,45956812,Patrick,My wife and I were very pleased with the accommodations that Kim provided. His home is very inviting and set in one of Seattle most picturesque neighborhoods very close to downtown. Jim went out of his way to help us understand how to get around and was a great host. I highly recommend staying here - I know I will again.
8517602,50993479,2015-10-16,19450562,Sharon,"We really enjoyed our night at Villa Hill in the charming Queen Anne neighborhood! Jim was a gem of a host and his place was clean, comfortable and quiet! 
A 10 minute walk gets you to the heart of the Queen Anne center with shops, restaurants, coffee shops and house gawking along the way. 
Our daughter attends Seattle Pacific University, so this was a great location for visiting her! 
We may go back!"
8517602,51194387,2015-10-18,45072157,Kimberley,"I had a wonderful experience at Villa Hill.  The property is charming, extremely clean and comfortable.  Jim is the consummate host.  He is very considerate and went out of his way to make sure I had everything I needed to enjoy my stay.  The neighborhood is quiet and residential, but only a short walk to a lively street with cafes, shops, etc.  Highly recommended!"
8517602,51959355,2015-10-25,45795038,Gregg,"Jim was an excellent and extremely accommodating host. He instantly made me feel welcome and provided a thorough walkthrough of the house's details and features. I greatly appreciated his flexibility as he completely meet my needs during check-in and check-out. Jim was accessible and quick to respond to questions, both prior to my trip and during my stay. I felt that he was always available, whether I wanted an additional pillow or needed to know how to get anywhere in Seattle and I appreciated that he checked in on me a number of times to ensure that my stay at Villa Hill was perfect. 

The house was exactly as advertised and was situated in a lovely, safe and quiet neighborhood. There was always plenty of parking on the wide, tree-lined street.

I really can't say enough good things about Jim and his house."
8517602,52371433,2015-10-28,47114130,Edward,"Jim welcomed us at the door and after we settled in, he explained everything in detail. The house is beautifully restored and the room is clean and comfortable. The neighborhood is very nice and close to many eateries. We will return next time if we are in Seattle. "
8517602,52654076,2015-10-31,20695969,Paul,A great place to stay. Host Jim was welcoming and helpful. The room and bathroom were immaculate and comfortable. Easy access to public transportation to downtown Seattle and very good restaurants are a short walk from the house. Definitely would stay here again. 
8517602,53165514,2015-11-05,48109508,Mark,"Everything was as described perfectly for the beautiful home, the wonderful and comfortable bed and the location was beyond our expectations. I think you need to better describe how much of a wonderful, helpful host you are and your talent not only with wood working but your music was greatly enjoyed. Of course, if you let that cat out of the bag you will have to perform more (oops did I just do that?). You have not only made new friends from Utah but you now have a home in Spring City Utah. Come visit us sometime. "
8517602,53364966,2015-11-08,46394046,Shane,First and foremost Jim was exceptional and a perfect host. He met us at the agreed time and was extremely committed to ensuring our stay was perfect. Jim's house is beautifully decorated and accommodating. The best part of our stay was getting to know Jim. He is extremely thoughtful and a very nice man. During our stay he offered to cook us breakfast and was easily reached for any need or question we had during our weekend stay. It was the perfect weekend getaway for my wife and I. The house is situated in a quiet beautiful neighborhood. It is literally a couple blocks from many shops and restaurants. My wife and I could not express the tranquility and refreshing retreat this stay had for us. Jim made this a wonderful experience and would highly recommend him to anyone!
8517602,53722135,2015-11-11,9560911,Beau,"My experience at Jim's was one of my best as an AirBnB'er. His house is charming and full of character, nestled perfectly in one of Seattle's best neighborhoods and very walkable. Jim was a perfect host who thought of everything. Will stay here again without a doubt! "
8517602,53869527,2015-11-13,6182494,Jim,"This was my second time staying with Jim, who is a great host. The location is central, free street parking, great selection of stores nearby, easy bus downtown. Jim's house is beautiful, the accommodations are great, and the price is right! "
8517602,53976475,2015-11-15,45403112,Barb,"Ideal location for me.  Quiet residential neighborhood, close to Seattle Pacific University and several shopping areas.  I was glad to avoid the hotels in more crowded areas of town.  (Ample parallel parking available here, but it's on a hill.)  

Jim was a fantastic host, very thorough in his preparations.  All areas were neat, clean, and creatively decorated!  Very nice accommodations: a private bedroom that can lock from the inside, a private bathroom (very clean!), and a small TV room of my own!  I loved this.  Jim continued to check on me throughout my stay to see if I needed anything, and he recommended a great restaurant for dinner one night.  A very gracious and conscientious host."
8517602,54255290,2015-11-17,46548019,Laura,"Jim was extremely welcoming, a gracious host. His house is a lovely, beautiful craftsman style. We were pleasantly surprised to have a private sitting room in addition to the private bedroom and bath. Great neighborhood. Walking distance to a lot of restaurants, and an easy drive to downtown Seattle. "
8517602,54447305,2015-11-20,35324771,Claudia,"Highly recommend - I was in Seattle for work, and needed a quiet and convenient place to stay. Villa Hill was a lovely and calm place to return to each night after hectic days; mornings were equally peaceful, and included good coffee, fruit and energy bars. This was such a brief and busy trip that I didn't, alas, have time to enjoy the soaking tub, nor the bottle of wine that Jim left for me, but I hope to stay here again. Jim managed to be both unobtrusive and welcoming, and quickly responded to all my questions."
8517602,54993375,2015-11-27,46232018,Nancy,"Our host was delightful, helpful, and thorough.  We came in very late, yet he took time to give us a little tour.  We loved his home with so many unique and international decorations.  The neighborhood was nice and quiet, yet close to quaint shops and restaurants.  We appreciated the thoughtful touches like fresh flowers, heaters in our rooms in case we wanted them warmer, umbrellas, and being able to use the TV room.  Everything was very clean and well-kept.  Our breakfast on Thanksgiving morning was especially nice and we enjoyed visiting with him.  We will definitely stay here again!"
8517602,55236867,2015-11-29,8314279,New,"Jim was a great host. He has a wonderful house to share with guests and enjoys showing off the ongoing remodeling projects. The house is like a museum of things from all the places he has lived.
We also just enjoyed visiting with him and exploring the neighborhood. Seattle can have a pretty big city feel to it and this neighborhood brings that down to a more manageable level. 
Overall, an enjoyable experience that made our stay that much better."
8517602,55792297,2015-12-06,46423714,Maureen,Jim was a wonderful host. Very thorough in his explanation when we arrived. It was so convenient to the wonderful things in Queen Anne. It was very quiet and comfortable. I would definitely return! Thanks Jim :)
8517602,56262385,2015-12-11,12876324,Alan,"Great spot. Fantastic place, clean, eclectic and highly recommended. Great location as well. A+. "
8517602,57000384,2015-12-20,51139009,点,Jim真的太好了！非常热情非常够义气！怕我们找不到特意去bus站接我们，帮我们搬行李，带我们在家里小小的参观，还分享homemade饼干给我们吃！villahill在queen anne区，从pine st坐bus过去大概二十分钟，villahill周围真是不能更美，美国小镇的感觉超级浪漫的说～如果下次再来一定还要住这儿！
8517602,58041516,2015-12-31,22335520,Dezilu,"There is nothing I can suggest to make our stay here more anything. The location, home, hospitality and host are all perfectly excellent. I would definitely rebook with Jim on another visit. Your home is stunning and very comfortable. Thanks for a great experience."
8517602,58188309,2016-01-01,32093617,Ryan,"Jim was very accommodating to our late arrival- even on NYE. Beautiful, clean house with snacks for breakfast! The house is in a great, quiet location, close to trader joes, Safeway and less than 10 minutes from the Seattle Center. We went to Crow restaurant for a nice dinner and loved it. Über takes you to and from this location easily. Great find in Queen Anne!"
134091,486440,2011-08-29,1025672,Caleb,A great place and awesome communication by Joe.  Thanks for having us!
134091,567539,2011-09-25,1166090,Randy,The host canceled my reservation 19 days before arrival.
134091,693900,2011-11-05,1006525,Eric,"This is a phenomenal property & has a great, responsive owner. It's as nice as the photos depict, if not nicer.

I'd recommend a stay without hesitation.
"
134091,819412,2012-01-01,1147058,John,"Clean: The home is well cared for, very tidy and organized.
Comfortable: Many extras that come in handy while your away for home.
Convenient:  Having on site parking was a real bonus. Great grocery store and restaurants near by. Buses to everywhere too. 

We will be renting this home again.

134091,878653,2012-01-23,1577848,Ruben,"Thoroughly enjoyed my stay. Place was better than I expected -- clean, walking distance to eateries, shops, bars, etc. It was extremely easy to communicate with owner. "
134091,1049207,2012-03-27,1448004,Brad,Fantastic place to rent -- one of the best in seattle. As nice as the pictures if not better. Joe was super clear and communicative. Will definitely rent again.
134091,1083318,2012-04-04,381841,Brooke,We loved our stay! Joe was very helpful and friendly. Great location. Beautiful house and gorgeously decorated. Could walk to great restaurants and coffee shops. Will def come back!
134091,1758991,2012-07-21,1863834,Françoise,"great house, located in a nice and quiet area. We especially enjoyed the beautifully equipped kitchen and the convenient setting of the eating space that enabled us to feel relaxed and cook in a pleasant atmosphere. Joe replied quickly and kindly. No wonder I would like to rent again when I come back; "
134091,2026422,2012-08-19,2077276,Mark,"My wife, child (1 year old) and I stayed at this place for about a week during the summer. The location was perfect, close to Seattle University, and within very close walking distance to restaurant, coffee shops, grocery stores and multiple parks. The fact that it came with a reserved, off the street parking space was essential and very handy. The place is accurately depicted in the photos. Lots of modern fixtures and amenities. Mostly it is decorated by Ikea, which keeps it functional and fun. The kitchen is well stocked. I really appreciated the small things like the fact that the coffee pot had filters in the cabinet so I didn't have to buy them. Although there is not a dining room table, we took to eating at the long bistro counter. Joe keeps it in line with Seattle's sustainability focus, by providing an easy way to compost and recycle. He also has one of those moder toilets that flushes two ways ( one way to conserve water). There were two bikes (and helmets and locks) that we could use so that was fun also! The front yard provides a patch of grass that was great to relax on in the evening. This place was super kid/ child friendly! There was a pack and play in the unit and an umbrella stroller. It took me only about 5 minutes to baby proof the house by moving vases up higher, altering locations of lamps and cords. The bathtub is great-- we used it for bathing our child every day. The shower head is heavenly! The place is kept shoes free, which is very helpful when you have a little one like ours that will put dirt/ twigs/ other shoe-tracked-in things in his mouth. The electronics worked great. The fans came in handy, since it was very hot when we were there. The bed in the bedroom was comfortable with lots of great feathery pillows. The only downside was the couch-hide-a-bed in the living room. Like all hide-a-beds, is was a back breaker! Joe opts for the stricter cancellation policy, which is cool. AirBnB/VRBO set this up so the others who are upset, should be mad at the sites, not owner. The upstairs is a vacation rental, and we met 2 different groups that stayed there. They seemed really nice, and the place is really well built that you can't hear them walking around or anything. There is a cool notebook in the place with photos of the original house before it was remodeled which I appreciated looking at. I also really appreciated the Grocery store QFC rewards card on the key chain. It gave us like $20 in discounts. Definitely go to the one on Broadway and not the one on 15th. I also highly recommend getting some coffee and wood fired bagels from the close by restaurant Eltana. Yum! All in all I have to say this is a great place, for a great price! Definitely would stay here..."
134091,2310367,2012-09-17,1220222,Talicia,"WOW, what a great place. Super easy to get in and out - incredibly clean, brand new and it has off street parking. The apartment is BEAUTIFUL and spotless. Joe also was also great at communicating. Its way nicer than a 5 star hotel and incredibly central. 5 minute walk to a bus stop that can take you either downtown or to the Seatlle Centre (Space needle, EMP ect). Also super close to Broadway and the Volunteer park. You can also walk downtown in 15 mins if you like. It's a gorgeous stroll (although a little steep on the way back). The closest place to get a drink or food (or late night snack) is this little hole in the wall called Chungees (like a block away) and let me tell you, it's DELICIOUS. Super great asian food and really inexpensive. Best chili chicken I've ever had, and the service was ACE.  Anyways, we had a great time in Seattle, and Joe's place was more than the icing on the cake. It really is Luxury and Location! "
134091,3957885,2013-03-31,4481073,Amy,"Just as advertised the house is located in a great neighborhood, walking and biking distance to everything. We parked our car in the off-street lot and didn't move it again until we left. The unit is cozy with lots of light, friendly neighbors, and a well instrumented kitchen. Excellent place for an escape."
134091,4385464,2013-05-01,6050253,Will,"We had a wonderful stay at Joe's apartment for 3 days last week.  The place was exactly as advertised, and Joe was very responsive and professional.  The unit itself is spacious, and everything looks exactly like the photos.  The unit is impeccable, with modern furnishings and attention to detail.  The bed is beyond comfortable, the kitchen is huge, and the unit has a lovely 'open-feel' to it.  The living room was a comfortable spot to unwind after a long day.  Also, we used the bikes during one of the days, which was a nice added perk, and a terrific way to see the city.

The location was exactly what we were looking for; a modern space in a trendy part of the city, but also within walking distance to the downtown area and all the attractions.  I would definitely stay here again."
134091,4983617,2013-06-05,6135418,Lisa,"Exceeded expectations! The unit was spacious, modern and clean. It came fully equipped and stocked with everything we needed (including a pack-n-play and stroller for our baby). Great location nears shops, restaurants, groceries and Volunteer Park. 

Joe was very responsive and a terrific host! Can't say enough good things!"
134091,7400567,2013-09-18,8497665,Philomena,"We stayed in one of the 3 units in Joe's lovingly renovated house. It was a perfect location with many neighborhood coffee shops, restaurants, grocery stores and pharmacies. The unit was nicely appointed, clean, neat, and fully equipped. Having a designated parking space was a real plus. We highly recommend it."
134091,7550074,2013-09-24,7482412,Jessica,"We had a great stay in Seattle.  Capitol Hill is a trendy, charming area.  The apartment is conveniently situated near grocery stores and great restaurants.  It's a brief drive from the waterfront.  The apartment itself was spotless and well appointed.  They provide more than other places we've stayed in by way of bath soap, dish soap, sponges, paper towels...  The wi-if worked great.  We have nothing bad to say.  We would definitely stay again."
134091,8631764,2013-11-09,2833533,William,Beautiful 1 br apartment with everything you could want.  Very close to a bunch of restaurants and cafes.  
134091,8703791,2013-11-12,3906917,Jason,Beautiful 1 bd condo that has everything you need. Situated between 15th and broadway in Cap Hill and close proximity to volunteer park and downtown. We had a great time.  Thanks Joe.  
134091,12602841,2014-05-06,9837421,Mya,"We couldn't have asked for more! I booked this space for my Mom, 2 brothers and myself. There was plenty of sleeping room and privacy. We had every amenity that we could ever need; including spices! The furnishings were so stylish and chic. The location is prime so we walked pretty much everywhere! Great communication and overall experience. Thank you so much!"
134091,38229036,2015-07-13,18943921,David,Joe communicated through e-mails and by phone and we felt very welcome in his home.
134091,44147435,2015-08-24,6321210,Alex,"This is the perfect location in Seattle. Steps away from amazing food, Volunteer Park and some of Capitol Hill's treaures. We had four people staying at Joe's place and we loved our stay... it was better than described and pictured. Spacious. Clean. Plenty of linens. Checking into the spot was a breeze and Joe was very helpful while we were booking the stay and accomodating with an early check-in. Great place. Great host."
134091,44800795,2015-08-29,39653487,Ryan,"The house was very nice and the neighborhood was great. The neighborhood was very walkable and having a parking spot in back made it easy to explore the areas further out. The house was very clean and the furniture and appliances all felt very new. There was some loud construction going on across the street, but that should just be a temporary issue.

I would stay here again if I visit Seattle again."
134091,45518996,2015-09-03,17638762,Jay,We had a wonderful stay! Plenty of amenities provided and awesome kitchen! Tourism pamphlets provided on the coffee table too. Thank you! 
134091,47537351,2015-09-20,32908941,Joe,"Clean, well appointed and recently updated condo. Joe was very responsive and I'd stay here again.  There are some condo buildings being built across the street, so there is some noise during the day. Nights are quiet though."
134091,50974673,2015-10-16,3273446,Marc,"Cette maison est sûrement le lieu le plus agréable que j'ai habité avec AirBnB. La cuisine est très complète, le lit très confortable, la décoration élégante et tout est pensé jusqu'au moindre détail. Beaucoup de commerces, de restaurants et de cafés aux alentours. 
Joe a répondu rapidement et efficacement à mes demandes. Je conseille chaudement l'endroit et j'y reviendrai sûrement!"
134091,51764343,2015-10-24,5396184,Trent,"The house was wonderful, the location - perfect.
Staying in Capitol Hill was excellent as we were surrounded by everything we love with all the hip coffee shops and eateries. 
Joe was a great host and the house is very easily set up to let yourself in and make yourself at home.
Would definitely recommend to anyone wanting to visit this beautiful relaxed city. "
134091,53000582,2015-11-03,4498035,Milan,"Immaculately clean, beautiful, well equipped and maintained apartment in an excellent location! We really enjoyed our stay, you would too!"
134091,55608190,2015-12-03,13701359,Thomas,"Bright, clean, well equipped apartment in a great location.  It's very conveniently located and there are numerous restaurants, cafes and grocery stores a short walk away.  Joe was a great host.  He was very responsive to the one minor problem we had and took care of it right away.  We really enjoyed our stay and I would gladly stay there again.  The only thing we didn't like was the noise from the condo construction going on across the street, but that won't last forever.  "
134091,56303354,2015-12-12,1725649,Robert,"We had a great time in Joe's Capitol Hill apartment - quiet, comfortable, well-equipped, in an excellent location near fabulous restaurants and cafes. The off-street parking spot is a real bonus. Joe was super-responsive by email. Everything as advertised. Highly recommend. "

7807087,47074540,2015-09-15,41651406,Janee',"Beautiful, spacious suite - just as pictured and described!  We loved the gorgeous view from the private balcony!  The separate entrance ensured convenience and privacy.  Perfect location in desirable Queen Ann neighborhood. We will definitely come back the next time we visit Seattle!"
7807087,48305003,2015-09-25,41132052,Yijun,房子位置很好 附近也比较安静 适合短住
7807087,48737370,2015-09-28,41110600,Katie,"Great place! Exactly as pictured. Convenient location with parking, quick drive to downtown Seattle and the space needle. Super clean and accomodating!"
7807087,50400507,2015-10-11,20808713,Shayara,"The apartment was just as described, clean and nice. Great location in a nice neighborhood. Sherill was great and respond quickly every time. "
7807087,52158579,2015-10-26,8727602,Katherine,"We very much enjoyed our stay in Sherill's apartment last weekend. The space was clean with cute decorations, and the Chromecast was a nice touch.

Sherill was a great host - very responsive and helpful! I'd definitely recommend to anyone wanting a quieter, more peaceful stay in Seattle while still being within easy driving distance of some of the cooler neighborhoods."
7807087,52934545,2015-11-02,43829166,Felix,"Sherill is a great host! She welcomed me and gave a brief tour  Her apartment was clean and organized with warm touches throughout. It's perfectly located for easy access to the Fremont, Ballard and hwy99 into downtown. It's a quiet place where you have your own private deck to sit on. "
7807087,54281348,2015-11-17,6830036,Aishwarya,"Sherill was a great host! Respected personal space, was available via message almost immediately (irrespective of time). The house was exactly as described and the view from the master bedroom was incredible. The back porch is an extra bonus if you want to watch the city lights at 1:38 AM with a bowl of cereal. The house is in a quiet but incredibly safe neighborhood. 30 minutes away from Kerry Park which gives an incredible view of the Seattle skyline. It's just basically a complete win-win. I was kinda sad I didn't get to see Sherill, but I know it is only a matter of time before I return. :)"
7807087,56061324,2015-12-08,23039628,Stephanie,My friend Rebecca arrived the day before me and was welcomed by Sherill.  Sherill was nice and friendly and recommended nearby places to eat.  The apartment was as described and there was also coffee which was great in the morning! Gary was also very helpful and let my friend use his phone to make some local calls when she realised she had lost her bank card during the stay. :)
7807087,56677988,2015-12-16,33466311,Eugene,"We enjoyed our week long stay at Sherill's apartment! The clean and cozy space was exactly as described - part of the second floor of her home, which included a bedroom with a balcony (and the entrance), living area, full bath and a small den/nook (that has a small bed). There was no kitchen, but that gave us the excuse to get take out or eat out at all the delicious restaurants nearby (Paseo was our favorite spot, get the Caribbean roast!). Sherill was a wonderful and responsive host and she made the extra effort in accommodating us and our little toddler. We had privacy and was never made to feel uncomfortable or unwelcome, especially with our spirited little daughter. We definitely recommend this place, especially if you're looking for a quiet neighborhood with quick access (by car) to the happening locations."
6576006,54188118,2015-11-16,42796223,Rodrigo,"Me and my Girlfriend Spent a weekend at Caitlyn's  and we had a great time, house is cozy and room is comfortable. I would definitely recommend it."
6576006,54335976,2015-11-18,1209361,Brian,Great home and room for a comfortable stay.  Caitlyn provides nice extra touches with her visitor's convenience in mind. Nice bed and quiet neighborhood. 1 block to bus that takes you right downtown. 5-10 min walk to several tasty restaurants. I recommend for sure
6576006,54472323,2015-11-20,15392505,Travis,Good
6576006,54923159,2015-11-25,25892979,Janine,Amazing welcome. Cozy room and bed. Great people!  Convenient to everything and everywhere!  I look forward to becoming a regular!
6576006,55088875,2015-11-27,49384825,Maria,"The prior host canceled last minute on us, due to a power outage in his area. Thanks to Caitlyn and her quick response to messages, our Seattle stay was saved! Katy was there to receive us. She was great and made us feel very comfortable and at home. The details throughout the bedroom (and the greeting on the door) brought a smile to our faces. Bedroom was clean, comfortable and private. Loved the closet with its amenities. And cannot go wrong with bedside coffee maker. "
6576006,55532966,2015-12-01,25892979,Janine,"Excellent Stay. Everything as described and then some! I live out of town and have an office right down the street from their home,  so it's quite convenient for my job.  Comfy bed and great hosts!  I will return soon!  Thanks guys!"
6576006,55675723,2015-12-04,1272938,Jan,"My husband and I stayed two nights at Caitlyn's and we are so pleased with our choice! Caitlyn made our stay extremely uncomplicated, and we adore the 'fairylights' in the room which gave the room a cosy ambience. The amazing espresso machine and a thoughtful basket of amenities are provided too! Right next to the door is the well-equipped bathroom is shared with a family member. Free street parking all around the area. :) The location of the townhouse is perfect for a visit to downtown Seattle, just a quick 10 minute drive to several key sites - absolutely perfect! "
6576006,55748258,2015-12-05,242115,David,"Everything was great during my stay with Caitlyn.  She sent pre-arrival information that was helpful, and gave me bus details which made my short stay in Seattle easier to manage.  The room was very private and comfortable.  I had a nice chat with Caitlyn, and would definitely recommend her home for a stay while in Seattle."
6576006,55829651,2015-12-06,37159883,Leenae,"Caitlyn was absolutely amazing! A couple of days before the trip, she provided very detailed, clear directions on how to get ourselves into their condo. She was fortunately home when we arrived, and welcomed us extremely warmly. 

We needed suggestions on places for dinner, and to go out and thought she'd just provide us with a few names of restaurants in passing but she even out did herself there. She wrote us a list of places to eat, drink and even price ranges. The room we stayed in was cozy and extremely clean. She provides above and beyond what's necessary to make sure her guests are welcome. We would definitely stay with Caitlyn again. Thank you for your hospitality! "
6576006,56200185,2015-12-10,38123625,Yang,"Enjoyed my stay in Caitlyn's house! My friend and I were impressed by how nice and welcoming Caitlyn and her sister are. The little welcome package was so considerate, which included all necessary information, such as transportation, restaurant etc. She even prepared  snacks for us! The house is cozy and only 5 mins away from bus station, which leads to most of place in Seattle. Highly recommend Caitlyn to everyone!"
6576006,57038925,2015-12-21,48535643,Bree,Great time. Stay with them. I stayed there alone and was so relaxed and rested for the time I spent in Seattle. The neighborhood and everything about the house was great. They give you snacks and a giant welcome gift basketand extra stuff if you don't have it. The house had a real welcoming vibe. 
6576006,57389974,2015-12-25,15237158,Wei,"This is a really nice and convenient place, which is equivalent to a mini hotel. There are all kinds of towels Caitlyn prepared for us, plenty of hangers, and a coffee machine in the room. It has everything! Caitlyn also provided really detailed directions as to how to go to her place by public transport. We really enjoyed our stay there. Highly recommend!! :D"
1343805,6960693,2013-09-01,7306505,Matthew,"We loved the house, the location and the city in general. Some trouble with the WiFi but that was the cable provider's fault, not the houseowner's."
783061,2997795,2012-11-30,2704334,Vanessa,"I truly appreciated the opportunity to stay with Lisa.
She opens her home to guests very naturally and makes you feel at ease instantly.
She is such a supportive host.  
During my stay, Lisa generously offered the kind of assistance that was above and beyond what anyone might hope to receive.
More than that, Lisa is easy to talk to, genuinely kind and caring, and generous to a fault.  I felt lucky to find her and you will too."
783061,3109377,2012-12-17,4391220,Ivy,"Lisa is a wonderful hostess.  The house is right near a beautiful lake which is awesome plus.  Her dog is super sweet, and best of all she welcomed me with the most delicious ginger bread.  "
783061,3270487,2013-01-04,4447472,Jingyi,"Lisa is a wonderful host! My mom and I had a great time staying at her place. Even though my mom does not speak English, Lisa is so nice and patient to listen to my mom and help her. We stayed on the main floor where has a super comfy and soft bed. Lisa is also very generous to let us use her kitchen. We felt very lucky that we were staying at Lisa's."
783061,3446789,2013-01-31,890695,Tom,"I stayed here for almost a month.  Lisa is a terrific host.  She keeps herself very busy with exciting sports activities and is happy to share her experiences when she returns.  She is generous and considerate.  For instance, when I came down with a cold she brought home a box of tissues for me.  It's these little things that make for a great stay.  Her home is just a couple blocks from Green Lake, about the best place in Seattle to walk, run, bike, sun bathe and people watch.  The house is between two bus lines so getting around without a car is super easy.   I managed bus only for the month quite easily."
783061,3504400,2013-02-09,1909896,Ben,"I had a wonderful time staying with Lisa. My stay was short, but she was incredibly friendly and welcoming.

I'd do it again!"
783061,3618468,2013-02-26,4270633,Mike,"This is my second time staying with Lisa and both times have been great.  She's a very considerate and friendly host.  Her house is in a really neat part of Seattle, minutes away from a huge park.  I would highly recommend staying here."
783061,3762765,2013-03-12,101445,Sharon/Richard,"Great location and very pleasant host. Sweet, slightly nervous little dog. Very comfortable bed. Was perfect for our needs. Clean, quiet, comfortable."
783061,3982716,2013-04-01,4741212,Frances,"My boyfriend and I had the great pleasure of staying at Lisa's family home for two weeks in March. We appreciated everyone's accommodation of our strange at-home work schedules (which included dining room work sessions and almost daily phone calls), especially from Lexi, Lisa's sweet dog. Small touches I particularly enjoyed included: our lovely welcome letter, organic/vegan/gluten-free snacks galore, the hanging open closet shelf, and dinner with Lisa and her daughter Meg at Lenny's. I came here originally miserable from Seattle's rainy weather and now I miss how sunlight streamed into our cozy red bedroom, first time slack-lining next to Green Lake, and being constantly stalked by cats while walking to Tangletown :)"
783061,4898872,2013-06-01,4709388,Marieke,"I enjoyed every minute of my two-months stay at Lisa's home! Lisa is an extremely friendly person, who is easy to talk to and is very welcoming to any of her guests. Her dog is easy to be around with and she became a dear, four-leg friend. Lisa's home is a delight: light and warm. It is further located in a safe and friendly neighborhood and  has easy access to public transportation (buses). In the future, when I visit Seattle again, I would love to stay at Lisa's again!"
783061,4940270,2013-06-03,3778731,Trevor,"I enjoyed my stay at Lisa's, very good value, beautiful location, Lisa is friendly and helpful and the bed is comfortable."
783061,6144397,2013-08-01,4772373,Mattieu,"There is so much things to say...
How to describe the pleasure we had during our stay, my girlfriend and myself, in Lisa's House... 
The house gives a warm welcome in Green Lake area, which is one of the most beautiful and peaceful place of Seattle, especially in Summer.
She has a very nice son and lovely dog, Lexi, you can't imagine how much time we spent to play with her...
Lisa is very nice, she is talkative, very active (++++), and will make you feel at home. She helped us in many ways.
For a first experience on airbnb, it was perfect. 
Thank you Lisa!"
783061,6792532,2013-08-25,7988323,Leeron,"Lisa was an absolutely wonderful host! As my first experience using AirBnB, I can't imagine a better experience to have had. Although we never quite got up to biking around Seattle (Surprise! Mountains/Hills) Lisa did offer to lend us a bike or two to explore the area, and gave us phenomenal directions on the closest bus/coffeeshop/supermarket, which made our navigation around the city a breeze. A gorgeous house, in a wonderfully pretty and quiet neighborhood, just a few blocks from a small collection of neighborhood hot spots, and one of the few busses in the area that ran almost 24 hours a day. A super convenient area for getting pretty much anywhere you'd like to explore in the city, and also just a few blocks from a lovely walking/biking path  and a park(?) around the beautiful Green Lake. Wonderful housemates who were very polite, and an absolute darling of a dog, who is a little shy at first, but warms up after a biscuit or two. If there is a better place to stay in Seattle, I'll never know, because I will absolutely reserve this place, anytime I find myself back in the area."
783061,6923495,2013-08-30,8207382,James,"My stay at Lisa's place was short but sweet. By the time my short stay of 4 days came to an end, I felt like I was at home. Lisa is very friendly and knowledgeable of the area, so as a new person to Seattle she was very helpful to me. Her son and dog are both very friendly as well. Overall, it was a great experience staying at Lisa's place."
783061,10997240,2014-03-17,480308,Sabina,"I had a fantastic stay at Lisa's. 
Highlights:
1) Sometimes Lisa cooked and let me eat her food
2) Comfy bed
3) Lexi (doggy) Love
4) An Extreme Bathroom Heater (toasty!)
5) Location
6) Flexibility

Lowlights:
1) Occasionally Lexi lets loose an early morning bark (wake up call!)
2) Nothing else, just only having the one item seemed thin

The other reviews detail the specifics pretty well, so I'm going to refer you to those and echo their sentiments.

783061,11799668,2014-04-15,12706498,Bambi,"I was looking for someplace that was relatively close to my daughters apt. and it was! A 5 minute walk to her apartment. It couldn't have been more convenient for me. I was only looking for some place to lay my head at night and shower. From the moment I walked into Lisa's home, I felt very comfortable. Her dog Lexi is a delight.  It was clean and had everything I needed.  I loved how close Lisa is to Green Lake. I would definitely stay again! "
783061,14259495,2014-06-16,8364019,Jen,"This was my first Airbnb stay and it wouldn't have been any better. The main floor bedroom was large and bright, the bed was comfy and warm, and there was a nice desk to get some work done at. Lisa's dog was a delight to have around. Lisa herself was friendly and attentive when needed. The neighborhood was beautiful and I loved being so close to Green Lake! Highly recommend staying here!"
783061,15742861,2014-07-15,10019285,Christina,"Lisa is gracious beyond expectation.  She is very welcoming and her home is comfortably lived in which adds to the relaxed atmosphere.  It has been fun meeting other new people from around the country and the world who have stayed while on vacation, just passing through, or beginning their life in the Seattle area.   The Green Lake neighborhood is beautiful with plenty of outdoor opportunities close by including a 3 mile loop around the lake and a nice park just a few blocks away with tennis, golf, dog park, trails, etc.  "
783061,15868995,2014-07-17,16017182,Sarah,Lisa's house is well located for exploring Seattle. Greenlake is really pretty. We liked visiting Golden Gardens and wish we had had more time to spend in Seattle.  Lexi the dog is really sweet!  Lisa was nice and offered us raspberry pie for breakfast :) 
783061,16547937,2014-07-29,14033134,Hera,"My husband and I had great time during our staying.
Nice neighborhood, nice people, nice dog..
The room is tidy, clean and comfy.
We cook everyday and there is enough space to put my stuff like food,cold beverage.
Lexi(such a good dog) is so  cute and friendly. We love her and already miss her so much.
Lisa is the best host that I have ever met.
We talked a lot cause I had so many questions. She answered all of my questions kindly. I enjoyed the time with her.
Lastly Greenlake is awesome.
It just takes 3mins to get there.
Beautiful place!!!
I highly recommend this wonderful house!!! Don't miss it."
783061,17498925,2014-08-13,12472244,Deb,I had a wonderful stay. Felt right at home. Loved that there were animals. The neighborhood is awesome!  Couldn't ask for a better one.  If you want the Four Seasons this is not for you. Anyone else will enjoy it!  Thank you Lisa for making me feel welcome!
783061,17927401,2014-08-19,14400754,Steve,"My first Airbnb experience and I can't imagine a friendlier, more welcoming host.   Thoughtfulness abounds, like a refrigerator drawer, kitchen shelf, and bathroom drawer designated for personal use.  Kitchen and laundry use were made easy to share by Lisa.  I was a little apprehensive about the shared bathroom, but again Lisa made the coordination easy and I never had the slightest inconvenience.  The room and bed were really comfortable, and the neighborhood and proximity to Green Lake are as good as it gets.  For a HOMEstay experience, this is the place."
783061,18236202,2014-08-24,16043843,Yi-Chen,Lisa的家非常溫馨亦非常舒適，位於Green Lake附近，是一個很安靜、漂亮的社區，所有她的家人都很友善包括她的狗Lexi，她常常在我一打開門的時候嘴巴叼著玩具搖著尾巴看著你，除非你有對她示好，不然她也不隨意的跑過來打擾你，是隻非常可愛的狗唷!!交通部份如果開車是最好不過，我們這次是搭16號公車來回市區，在我認為是還算方便。離UW約1.7英里，(website hidden) Lake附近也有別的公園，還有動物園，可以走上一天，總之我覺得是很棒的地點和房子，如果有機會，我會再來住Lisa的家!
783061,19553316,2014-09-14,8046051,Karen,"We were very happy with our stay experience and location..  Our trip was like visiting a friend in a casual and comfortable home located in a beautiful area of Seattle.  We were thrilled with the location between Freemont, Ballard and Green Lake.  We enjoyed the running path around Green Lake and walking distance to Elysian brewery, in Tangletown for dinner.  Will definitely stay here, again."
783061,20527845,2014-09-30,21413624,Keegan,I had a great week staying at Lisa's home. She is a great host and Lexi the dog is good company. And the bed was very comfortable! Thanks Lisa!!
783061,20860789,2014-10-06,13096262,Naysa,"My actual review is the next one, but in case this is all you read... Lisa is great as is the house.  It's a no-brainer to stay here if you're looking for something comfortable in Seattle."
783061,21106719,2014-10-11,13096262,Naysa,This home is great! Lisa is experienced at hosting and gave an informative and welcoming introduction to the home.  A bonus was her willingness to have my dog stay with her pooch Lexi while I was at work or running errands.  Findley absolutely loved it here!  This house is extremely close to Green lake and the park system.  
783061,21444205,2014-10-17,4138425,Richard,"Lisa's home is wonderful and she is a warm and welcoming host.  There is a shared bath, but seamless in terms of working out sharing arrangements.  The photos and listing are accurate and to be trusted."
783061,21967868,2014-10-27,20073667,Robinson,"Staying in Seattle was great! The bed was comfy, the location was great, and Lisa made me feel at home. It was easy to park right by the house. There's even a shower curtain painted with a giant map of the world."
783061,27195203,2015-02-28,20741723,Eva,"Everything was great and a good experience! Lisa truly knows how to make people feel at home, was always helpful and easy to talk to. The dog Lexi quickly became a new friend, and I learned a lot about geography from the giant map on the shower curtain. The neighborhood is laid-back, bike-friendly, and offers good jogging routes. I can only recommend it!  "
783061,38689783,2015-07-18,26360009,Rachel,Lisa was an excellent host. She answered all my questions and was very friendly and helpful. The house was just what I needed and the experience was great. I would definitely stay there again. 
783061,39322188,2015-07-22,37675697,Lilan,"Great location with an easy walk to Greenlake, which is very pleasant to hang out around. House itself is older but well maintained and clean. Lisa is awesome--very friendly and welcoming without being overbearing. Lexi is a very sweet and mellow canine companion--almost didn't want to leave the house, but plenty to do in the vicinity, so I had to. :)"
783061,39630130,2015-07-25,9355304,Richard,"I wish that I could have been the first to review Lisa's delightful place.  All the other rave reviews have sort of stolen my thunder.  That said, I will ask the question I haven't seen anyone else ask: why doesn't Airbnb give her five stars?  If anyone deserves it, she does.

OK, I'll list the pluses and the minuses.

Pluses:

Great location in a tranquil and pretty North Seattle neighborhood, two blocks from Green Lake and the lovely park surrounding it.  Also, Lisa's place is about three blocks from a really sweet, intimate neighborhood business district, containing in the space of two blocks several excellent restaurants and a grocery store.  The number 16 bus can quickly get you from there to downtown, and also connects to buses to the University district, Bellview, and other parts of Seattle.

A quiet, private room, in a comfortable, unpretentious house.  One where you'll immediately feel at home, as my wife and I did.  The room is adjacent to the bath and well stocked kitchen, with coffee and breakfast fixings available.

Lexi, arguably the world's most adorable dog; a bit shy at first but very affectionate and a true ""love hound"".

A music room with a grand piano and other instruments.

And Lisa herself, friendly, warm and amenable, a gracious host who made us feel truly welcome, right from the start.

Minuses: 

None.  I only wish that we had booked more days with her.  Next time we will.

"
783061,44756266,2015-08-29,29130393,Marcus,"Lisa was great! 
She is a very welcoming, and helpful host."
783061,54695840,2015-11-23,15358006,Tracy,"I'm glad I got to stay in Lisa's beautiful home during my last months in Seattle. Lisa, Lexi, and Tim were wonderful hosts and always made me feel welcome. Her home is within walking distance to QFC, Green Lake, and there are lots of delicious restaurants close by. If you enjoy biking, kayaking, walking, and jogging, I suggest exploring Green Lake. Lisa also let me borrow her awesome bikes and I was able to ride around Green Lake and the Burke-Gilman Trail! When you come to Seattle and are looking for a place to stay, I highly recommend staying with Lisa!"
6941113,37398433,2015-07-06,22098826,Kevin,Host was very accommodating and makes every effort to guarantee a great living experience. Responds promptly to your questions and even asks what he can do for you. A++!
6941113,38630463,2015-07-17,10569227,Liza,"Kaiser & Heather thought of everything! There were snacks and games, a great TV, extra towels and water in the fridge. The sleep number beds were comfortable too. 

Kaiser was easy to reach and accommodating. The neighborhood was centrally located, close to some yummy restaurants and perfect for the convention we were attending. I would definitely stay here again.

Thanks guys!"
6941113,39566963,2015-07-24,20332653,Danny,"Great space, in a fairly central location in Seattle. There was free coffee, air conditioning, and the bed was very comfortable. Would definitely stay here again"
6941113,41804785,2015-08-09,6508806,Chris,"Kaiser was a fantastic host! He was always responsive to messages and easy to talk to.  He gave us tips and toured us on the building. The place was as described. The air conditioning made the place really comfortable. Cable TV, Netflix and internet/wifi (although slow) were all nice to have. It was great for accommodating a family of 6 adults and one child. The area is walking distance to Pike Place Market and shopping district (check (website hidden)). I definitely recommend staying in here if you want to stay in downtown."
6941113,42694131,2015-08-15,18458521,Lihua,This apartment is awesome! The landlord is so nice and provided us with lots of convenience. I will definitely choose this one in the next trip to Seattle.
6941113,45377303,2015-09-02,16350734,Steve,"This unit was awesome. We were right downtown next the convention center which was exactly where we needed to be. Not only was Kaiser  there for the walk through but really ran this with care and appreciation; essentially understanding that we could have stayed anywhere else, but chose to stay in his airbnb.  Because of that attitude, his unit was exceptionally clean, had all the amenities we needed and more, helpful instructions throughout, clean sheets, nice furnishings, you name it.  I would absolutely stay here again."
6941113,45840255,2015-09-06,20488327,Greg,Great host.  Was able to meet us at different time at last minute.  Condo was very clean and comfortable for our family.  It's in a great location right in the heart of Seattle.
6941113,47663240,2015-09-21,6225682,Susan,"This apartment is great.  The location is convenient to downtown but also right next to capitol hill as well.  The unit was clean and as described.  Kaiser was very responsive and helpful.  He accommodated an early check-in which meant we could settle in after a long flight.  The nighttime view of the skyline is fun.  The beds were super comfy.  We were much happier here than in a hotel.  Everyone could keep their own schedule without bothering the others (JET LAG!!)

I will stay here if I have a chance to visit Seattle again."
6941113,48415105,2015-09-26,42293467,Guillermo,"We have had a fantastic vacations in Seattle, the apartament was as we were looking for, very well placed, clean and comfortable."

6941113,51126123,2015-10-18,41037610,Michael,Great apartment.  Ideal for events at the Convention Center.  Would definitely stay there again.
6941113,51486706,2015-10-20,287934,Natalie,"We had a WONDERFUL stay!!  Hosts went out of their way to provide an early check in, met us in person at the property to walk us through everything, and even left me Mimosa makings because they knew we were there to celebrate my bday!!  The apartment is adorable and had all of the amenities we could have needed.  We loved the rooftop deck view and the location was PERFECT.  I would stay here again in a heartbeat."
6941113,52820860,2015-11-02,17309877,Martin,"We were greeted on arrival and shown all the apartment's facilities.  Kaiser and Heather were very responsive and checked up on us part way through the stay to make sure all was OK.

The apartment is amazingly setup with so much entertainment and has all of the amenities we needed - more than we expected.

For us, it was perfectly located as we were in town for a conference at the WSCC - it was less than 5 minutes walk to get there and also only a couple of minutes to Victrola and Starbucks coffee roasters."
6941113,53464427,2015-11-09,11516455,Paul,"Kaiser was extremely accommodating! The apartment was just as promised - recently renovated, comfortable, and located conveniently only steps from the Washington State Convention Center.  "
6941113,55717142,2015-12-05,45393468,Erin,"Kaiser was attentive and his communication was great.  We appreciated the check-in not long after we arrived to be sure things were as we expected.  The apartment was cozy and in a great location.  The parking space was really nice to have as an option.  The proximity to the convention center and downtown couldn't have been better - it was a 2 minute walk up the stairs to the convention center, if that! "
6941113,56277075,2015-12-11,28650619,明_Baipier,十分宽敞的房屋 房主还非常热心的亲手搬来一个充气床垫 以便我们每个人都能独享一张大床 停车位虽然要收费 不过私人车库的感觉还是很赞的 靠近西雅图会议中心的位置交通很便利
6941113,57123766,2015-12-22,43325447,Stephanie,The house was very nice! We were first welcomed to snacks when we walked into the home. There were plenty of towels provided! I came with a group of 7 and everyone slept comfortably. The apartment was very close to pikes place and close to the light rail road. Kaiser responded to all questions quickly and made the directions to find everything really easy! I will definitely recommend this place to my friends and stay here for my future visits! :)  
6941113,58136350,2016-01-01,8714260,Michael,"This is a clean, cosy, extremely convenient place to stay in downtown Seattle.  Kaiser is friendly, helpful, low-key and accessible.  A great place in a great city.  "
6494181,35949040,2015-06-23,34357184,Linda,"Our stay with Rebecca was wonderful! We were met promptly at our desired check-in time and were given a complete tour of the Penthouse and it's amenities. The Penthouse was very clean and homey.  The location was perfect, close to the Convention Center area, restaurants and bars and a nice walk to the Space Needle and Pike Place Market.  This Penthouse was perfect for our stay. Rebecca, and Doug, who checked us in, were helpful and accommodating. I would definitely stay here again. Thanks!"
6494181,39013115,2015-07-20,33688123,Li,"Doug is an amiable person.  We all admire his great personality.  We arrived a little bit early than we expected but he quickly finished his other things and showed up right away.  Doug spent quite some time explaining the entire environment and transportation details.  He walked me through thoroughly the usage of all major facilities in the room as well as in the garage (we even got a free parking lot!) When we had problems with the curtains Doug responded immediately and made our stay a real pleasant one.  The building is conveniently located at East Pike street, next to the Convention Center and just walking distance from major shopping centers such as Nordsdrom and Pacific Place.  Way too many good restaurants and grocery stores around making it really convenient to stay there.  Light rail and Mono-rail are just a few blocks away and will take you to major tourism places like the Space Needle or the fisherman market or the Stadiums.  If you drive, you will find it really easy to merge on I-90 or I-5.  The room is really spacious with a lovely full functional kitchen.  It is big enough to host 4-5 people so perfect for a family on vacation in Seattle."
6494181,39420931,2015-07-23,11996143,Erline,"Our apartment was very comfortable, clean and spaciuos. The neighborhood is great with and easy walk to all the tourist attractions. "
6494181,39761257,2015-07-26,33860929,Bjorn,"Was a great stay at a downtown Seattle penthouse.  Place was very spacious, clean, hosts were excellent to deal with.  Lots within walking distance, including light rail station."
6494181,41210338,2015-08-05,34680330,Courtney,"The location of the condo could not have been more perfect.  Everything that we visited during our stay was within walking distance and very easy to get to.  The condo was a great size and had a in-unit laundry and a rooftop deck that we could use, which really added to the comfort of our stay.  We really appreciated the AC units and the extra fans in the unit, since during our stay the weather was around 90 degrees. Overall, we really enjoyed our trip to Seattle and hope to be back soon! "
6494181,41752128,2015-08-09,7007233,Heidi,"Great place! Fantastic, very walk-able location-- easy access to Pike Place Mkt, the Space Needle, the wonders of Capitol Hill, and Safeco Field. The apartment is nicely furnished and has a nice view of downtown. We all enjoyed our stay and would recommend this apartment for families, couples, a small group of friends, or a long-term work stay."
6494181,43234993,2015-08-18,16922689,Marguerite,"Doug was friendly, had a very well planned orientation for the apartment with good mix of advice on things to do while in Seattle. The place was clean and appeared as expected from the pictures and description. We had a wonderful time exploring the city from this extremely convenient location. "
6494181,45292823,2015-09-01,40401847,Kevin,The apartment was very tidy and clean and were pleasantly greeted by Doug who ran through everything we needed to know. The apartment was exactly as described amd was very convenient for our time at the convention centre. Very glad we found this place and would recommend highly.
6494181,51429025,2015-10-20,7487630,Leah,This place was amazing! We loved the space. The pictures did it justice and its location was so convenient. We were able to walk to several places in the downtown area. Only disappointment was the second bathroom; It was extremely small. We would definitely come back again! 
6494181,52044057,2015-10-26,37302138,Kelly,"The condo was great, very clean and centrally located. Very easy to work with Becki and would definitely stay here again. "
6494181,52835867,2015-11-02,42320281,Megan,Doug was very welcoming upon arrival. Spacious apartment for 6 people for 4 nights. Would stay here again. Had everything we needed. And we were able to walk to almost everything we did. Gorgeous! 
6494181,57631698,2015-12-28,44292733,Frederick,"We loved our stay at this Penthouse Condo.  The location is wonderful and perfectly situated for shopping, sightseeing and close to so many diverse restaurants.  My husband was recovering from hip surgery and the condo was only a mile from the hospital.  The open floor plan was perfect as he was able to easily walk about.  The nicely appointed kitchen, washer & dryer and parking made this Condo the perfect choice.  Next time we stay there,  I hope it will be just for fun! "
8817033,50900779,2015-10-15,43872082,Eric,Casey was very laid back and the accommodations were excellent. The location is within walking distance of a lot of attractions and is nestled away in a nice neighborhood. Would stay again if I'm in the area! 
8817033,51083850,2015-10-17,45309725,Fan,Casey's house is clean and quiet. King size bed is very comfortable and private bathroom is neat. It's a really good experience to stay in his house for one night. 
8817033,51855010,2015-10-24,46956462,Patra,"Casey was an excellent host who was communicative and accessible both before and during our entire stay in Seattle. I had never visited Seattle and he offered up excellent suggestions about places to visit and eat near his apartment. The apartment was neat and clean, and quickly made us feel right at home. The parking was easy and the apartment within walking of downtown. When I return to Seattle, I wouldn't hesitate to stay at Casey's apartment yet again :)"
8817033,52386736,2015-10-28,47212335,Kyle Marie,Casey was a fabulous host. His place is very clean. Bed is really comfortable. He is easy to contact with and very accommodating with free parking. He's so friendly and nice to chat with too. I would definitely come back if in the Capitol Hill/Seattle area again!!
8817033,52773312,2015-11-01,13654430,Yasmina,"We don't meet Casey but he gave us by email all information we need to set up.
The appartment is nice and very useful. It is well located at 20min walks from downtown, with a private parking place. 
The bedroom was clean with a private bathroom. 

"
8817033,53381652,2015-11-08,22065503,Nancy,Great neighborhood. Casey made it super easy to get in. Very comfortable bed. I was able to walk to everything.  Pretty basic- comfortable and not too pricey. I'd stay there again.
8817033,54358760,2015-11-18,49046873,Hadi,"Casey was a friendly and helpful host. 
The house was clean, well equipped and nicely decorated (actually better than what you see in the picture!)
If I travel to Seattle again, I would definitely consider this place as an option."

7069143,37529471,2015-07-07,37284535,Joseph,The place was as described. Amanda also gave me a discount for staying at the place while she was putting in new floors which was much appreciated. I had the 3rd floor which was a bit hot with no AC but I was only there at night to sleep so it wasn't an issue for me. There was some miscommunication with check-in and check-out times but Amanda was very accommodating and it all worked out. 
7069143,37907093,2015-07-11,18971308,Corey,"This was an excellent location to experience Seattle. Fremont is filled with treasures: the Fremont Troll, plenty of delicious coffee shops walking distance, along with great burgers at Uneeda Burger & pizza at Via Tribunali. 
Downtown is walkable, but not for the faint of heart. Bus is an easier option with one shooting you straight to the heart of downtown. 
For the digs: awesome dog (polite & friendly), comfy bed, great bathroom,  and the kitchen set up works well. Even with another two people in another airbnb room and Amanda around---we were able to cook big breakfasts & use the bathrooms easily. 
Highly recommended for a place to stay for a few days and experience Seattle. "
7069143,39420354,2015-07-23,37276107,Cindy,Amanda's place was great. The room was not big but enough for me to stay comfortably for 5 nights. The bathroom was actually awesome. The surrounding neighborhood is quiet and safe. I enjoyed walking down the street to different coffee shops and embraced that gorgeous place! I also rented a car. Parking on the street around the house was free and it wasn't hard to find a spot. Pretty easy to get on the freeway to get to downtown. The overall experience staying at Amanda's house was good. The only minor issue was Wifi connection problem from the 2nd day of my stay. Amanda was not in town to fix the issue so she offered me $50 refund for compensation. I really appreciate that!
7069143,40483827,2015-07-31,37426397,Harold,"Great location ! ...The room and the entire home was clean and comfortable. It is located along bus routes and in a quiet neighborhood. It is centrally located within walking  distances to neighborhood cafes and restaurants. Will definitely consider rent it again!

7069143,41977859,2015-08-10,37189170,Lily,"The room is as cozy as described, very clean and quite. The location of this townhouse is very convenient , only 15 minutis driving to downtown. (bus connections are available also) Parking is free on street and is not hard to find a spot. Best of best, Amanda is very nice, she provided food and drink in frig, which is awsome. Would come again if we come to Seattle in future , and 100 % recommend to you guys! "
7069143,43090603,2015-08-17,14655014,Beverly,"Amanda helped us out by providing the needed information for locating and entering the room since we arrived at 2 AM.  The location is excellent.  The room is very small--as described, but the bed was reasonably comfortable, there is a private bathroom, and it was very clean.  I was surprised that the bed had no top sheet--Amanda explained that this was common in Asian countries and she washes all the bed clothes, including the light quilt. "
7069143,43854556,2015-08-22,19072704,Erich,"Great location, nice clean comfortable bed and bathroom. Would come back next time in Seattle."
7069143,44546203,2015-08-27,34868358,Jaclyn&Mitchell,"Great location, good communication with Amanda, location was great for our stay. Really enjoyed walking the hills on Fremont Ave to all the little shops and restaurants definitely recommend if you visiting seattle and looking for a relaxing atmosphere."
7069143,45091486,2015-08-31,9578546,Alexandra,"Amandas room for us was amazing - bottom floor, right in front of the entrance, en suite bathroom AND a closet, backyard access. All in all great stay. If you can request this bottom floor room I highly suggest you do. We felt like we were in a hotel, no awkward bathroom scheduling. She also allowed us to use her kitchen upstairs though we didnt need to. Great host. "
7069143,46136837,2015-09-08,37737739,Kyle,"Amanda was a pretty chill host.  I stayed with her for a week while I was in between leases.  The check in and check out times didn't work well for me but she willingly accommodated my needs, which made things go much more smoothly during my move than they could have went.  The room was clean, the house was as described, and I had no problems during my stay."
7069143,47374692,2015-09-18,41012405,Jan,"The location was very convenient for transport and the price was reasonable. However, the photos need to be updated as they don't reflect the accommodation. The apartment block is actually behind the one on the photo.  The small courtyard had no table and chairs, or garden, when we were there. The bathroom in the photos is not the one on the ground floor.  Apparently the room was previously a study and is small. The bed would suit a single better than a couple. 
We saw Amanda only briefly as she didn't seem to spend much time at home, which did mean that we had the kitchen and living room to ourselves, but was a bit like camping in an abandoned house. "
7069143,49367627,2015-10-03,3884446,Kate,"Amanda's place was very comfortable, accessible, and in a great neighborhood. It was easy to get in touch with Amanda about any questions I had during my stay. I was out and about a lot, but was welcomed to use the kitchen and laundry. This is a great combination of a private room and bathroom with access to the comforts of home, if you choose. "
7069143,50958496,2015-10-16,45300025,Gretchen,Amanda's room was comfortable and convenient. She was responsive to our questions and need to check in and out at odd times.

7069143,56160386,2015-12-09,10997299,Olia,"The bedroom is small and simple, and had everything I needed: comfortable bed, a good size closet with hangers and a suitcase stand, reading lamp, attached bathroom with great water pressure for the shower.
Good privacy, quiet.  The slider looks out into a small back yard, trees and birds, not right at someone's windows.
I never actually saw Amanda, but she checked in via email to make sure I had what I needed.
Excellent location, a block away from some restaurants and a grocery store, an easy stroll to the heart of Fremont and the canal.   I was concerned about parking but was able to park within a block on all 3 nights that I was there.  
It was perfect for my needs."
7069143,56985290,2015-12-20,28722839,Mitch,"Amanda and her place were great. The bed was really comfortable and the heated floors were a welcome surprise. We both kind of did our own thing and didn't get to talk that much, but I would definitely recommend her place to anyone thinking of staying in the area."

5495802,35556620,2015-06-20,1287880,Bryant,"(email hidden) home away from home...and staying at Adam's Sanctuary only punctuated that sentiment.  The location is perfect...close enough to everything...but just far away for some seclusion away from the hustle of the downtown.  The place was spacious, comfortable, and perfect from my best friend and I where we didn't feel we were in each others space all the time.  Next to the ballgames we attended, the good food we consumed, and the recently opened Rachel's Ginger Beer just steps away that we visited on a daily basis...the memorable part of our trip is the people you meet...and Adam was one of the coolest hosts. We didn't even realize how long we were chatting with him when we arrived (sorry for keeping you from prepping the place for us...haha). I travel quite a bit to (email hidden)d hopefully on my next trip Adam's Sanctuary is will be available =)"
5495802,36101747,2015-06-25,13561257,Bianca,Adam was extremely nice and provided a tour of the place as well as some local area tips. The place was gorgeous and secure. This is in a great location! Would definitely recommend! 
5495802,36667589,2015-06-30,27896865,Sarah,"Adam greeted us right away and showed us to our on site parking. Right away he was giving us the scoop for all the best places to go and to eat while in Seattle/Capitol Hill. Check in was super easy and smooth. 

The Apartment wa clean and comfortable. Netflix in the living room and bedroom! (Thanks Adam!) There were plenty of clean towels and shampoo and soap in the shower, which was great because traveling with tons of mini bottles of soap is annoying. He even had laundry in the apt. to wash the sheets mid way through our stay (it was so hot in Seattle that week). 

It was awesome to be within walking of downtown Seattle as well as a TON of amazing places to eat in Capitol Hill. As well as really close to a nice park with a fountain that was relaxing to sit by. 

Adam was a very nice host! Super chill and easy to work with. "
5495802,37738205,2015-07-10,29862007,Mitchell,"Adam's space was perfect. The apartment was remarkably clean, the bed was extremely comfortable, the neighborhood was excellent, and everything we needed was available. Our flight in was delayed an hour and Adam was very understanding and communicative. The pictures for the listing make the space seem smaller than it is- but there is more than enough room for activities. Next time we're back in Seattle we'll be hitting Adam up for another stay."
5495802,39279703,2015-07-22,29003923,Blair,"Adam met us when we arrived at his apartment, showed us around and gave us some good tips for navigating the city. His place was clean, quiet and pretty much exactly what we were looking for. Great spot, would recommend!"
5495802,40633463,2015-08-01,8201929,Madalyn,"The space was clean, spacious, and  in a great location. The garage parking was a big plus as well.

Adam immediately made me feel at home, had tons of great recommendations, and waited around even though my flight was over an hour late. The apartment was very large, quiet, and comfortable. Great experience!"

It was especially nice to have secure parking."
5495802,45554795,2015-09-04,17208676,James,"Adam was a great host and kept up communication all the way until we received the keys. The apartment is much larger than the pictures show and is in a really convenient part of the city. His place was quiet, clean and has all of the amenities you need to enjoy a long stay. You can walk to downtown in 15-20min's, or get an uber to most other parts for less than $10-15. 

"
5495802,46164850,2015-09-08,33076652,Winnie,"Adam was very knowledgeable about the area and the things to do around the area. We took many of his suggestions and they were great! The place was clean and as described, and is in a quiet neighborhood, perfect for a light sleeper like me. The Chromecast on the bedroom TV was an unexpected delight! Came in handy for the nights we just vegged out a little before going to bed. Adam helped make my first trip to Seattle worth it!"
5495802,47806320,2015-09-21,43372302,Danny,Adam was accommodating and the place is situated in a very ideal neighborhood. 
5495802,49156533,2015-10-01,12058949,Brian,"Location was perfect. Adam was really nice. Lots of space, but the apartment needs some serious updating. Although the place was very well cleaned, the carpets were stained and the apartment was falling apart a bit. "
5495802,49851254,2015-10-06,10589790,Justen,Adam is an awesome host and his place was absolutely perfect. Awesome location.  Very clean. $5-$7 uber ride to anywhere downtown seattle. And within walking distance of plenty of great restaurants. 
5495802,50890727,2015-10-15,42647871,Brian,Easy with great access to some prime Capitol Hill locations. It was very nice to have a kitchen to cook in too!
5495802,51181125,2015-10-18,13305356,Angela & Caleb,"Great location. Just minutes to pretty much anywhere in the city. Many bars and restaurants within walking distance.

Adam was kind and helpful. Very knowledgeable about the area and provided everything we needed for a comfortable stay."
5495802,54246457,2015-11-17,43942201,Derek,"The townhouse was great, Adam was great too. Very friendly, accommodating and gave great recommendations. Location was absolutely perfect. A great stay overall. I recommend this listing!"
5495802,57717313,2015-12-28,25723006,Katya,"Excellent spot, excellent host!"
5175464,26038966,2015-02-01,5519725,Olivia,"This was a great little room to stay in. Although it was a tad bit noisy, the hosts provided a noise canceling machine.

The studio was clean and had everything to cook our own meals. I really appreciated having the little space for the weekend. It's very near the 7 bus line and not far from a train station that goes directly downtown and to the international district. We learned how to get around fairly quickly. 

Loved it and would recommend it to other travelers!"
5175464,29106814,2015-04-04,27562720,Kellie,"Samantha was very helpful and left us a very lovely note upon arrival. The studio was a perfect amount of space for my boyfriend and I. The neighborhood of Columbia City is absolutely adorable and the light rail to downtown and other attractions is very easy to access. There are a bunch of great restaurants, a bakery, and a wonderful coffee shop just a block or two away. I would absolutely recommend this area to anyone."
5175464,29650466,2015-04-10,24273308,Danielle,My husband and I stayed in Samantha's studio for 2 nights. The space is exactly as she described- cozy and sweet! We would definitely stay again if in the Seattle area!
5175464,30901585,2015-04-28,16538196,Caroline,"This studio was the perfect space for a week long stay. Very clean and a great location. The bed was comfy and the bathroom was great! Though we didn't use the kitchen, it was adorable and had everything you could need. I would definitely stay here again for an affordable place to stay in Seattle."
5175464,31228378,2015-05-03,18352150,Melissa,Perfect small studio for two people. Small but had everything we needed for a few days. Would definitely recommend it! 
5175464,32020777,2015-05-12,22820027,Jose Louis,Great place to stay. Great area. Samantha has the studio really clean. Perfect for 2. My bro and I loved it. 
5175464,43905622,2015-08-23,29135799,Javier,"My girlfriend and I rented this space for the summer and were very satisfied. Although the space lacks a living room, it felt big enough for us, especially because it's only a block away from coffee shops when we need more space. We worked downtown and took the Light Rail (a 6-minute walk), and the entire door-to-door commute was only 35 minutes.

The only caution is if you plan to spend much time in upper Seattle (Ballard, Fremont, or the University District), especially late weekend nights, returning to Columbia City takes 1.5 hours because the lack of a straight bus or rail line from North to South. But Downtown to this space takes 40 minutes at most.

Other reviews mention ""noisy neighbors"", which is true because the walls are thin. We didn't have a problem with them though because we normally sleep with ear plugs anyway, but if you don't, you may want to bring them.

I would recommend this room to my friends."
5175464,44445063,2015-08-26,297438,Morgan,"Columbia city is very nice and this apartment was in a good location. However there were some mix ups that were not the hosts fault that began our stay on an off note. Then the other tenants in the building were not terribly mindful of the thin walls. 

Also the space is not friendly to people over 6ft tall. "
5175464,44744274,2015-08-28,42627222,Ed,"My girlfriend and I requested a stay at this studio at the last minute during a trip to Seattle. Samantha was very gracious and got the place ready for us with little notice.

The location of this property is very convenient both for walking to food and entertainment on Rainer Street at night and proximity to the Seattle-Tacoma airport upon arrival or departure. 

The studio itself is small but well laid out. Upon entering the space via the front door you are met with the bedroom. A short hallway ahead of you contains the door to the bathroom and opens into the kitchen. The space is efficient and well laid out. The ceilings are very low in this space so if you are taller than 6' expect to feel a bit cramped. 

As other reveiwers have mentioned, noise is a problem here. The neighbors aren't overly loud but do have animals and play music late into the night. The walls and ceiling do little to block any sound from the surrounding units. Additionally the drain pipes from the units above run down the far wall of the kitchen so when an upstairs neighbor flushes a toilet expect a loud watery swoosh. Samantha provides a white noise machine to help in this respect. My girlfriend and I slept well but we are not particularly light sleepers. 

If your goal for this booking is to have a cozy place to sleep with plenty of value and a great host, Samantha and her studio definitely fit the bill. Should we be in the area again, we will definitely be staying here (with more notice this time Samantha)."
5175464,44929065,2015-08-30,37836229,Cooper,"My girlfriend and I came up for PAX and needed a place to stay for two nights, this place was great, nice and cozy within a nice neighborhood - quick walk down to some restaurants and coffee.

We never got a chance to meet face to face but Samantha was quick to reply to my messages on AirBNB and answered any questions or concerns I had very quickly. I would happily stay here again if I was coming down to Seattle again"
5175464,46346123,2015-09-09,13876067,Quyen,"Samantha gave us detailed instructions via text messages for the checkin. It was very convenient.
The studio apartment was a simple, clean basic place in a good location for us to visit family, right near downtown with plenty of restaurants. The bed was comfortable. The only drawbacks were the refrigerator noise, the noise from the floor above ( you can hear conversation, television like you are in the same room ) and the noise of water crashing down when the upstairs toilet is flushed."
5175464,47398095,2015-09-18,29837115,Marissa,Cute studio. Accommodating with fast response times. Conveniently located.  Highly recommend.
5175464,48039933,2015-09-22,43609277,Shane,"Nice place, clean, close to everything Columbia city and the rail to get downtown. Easy in, easy out, great host. "
5175464,48561399,2015-09-27,41612421,Byron & Tanisha,"Samantha's studio is a great cozy getaway.

It's clean and welcoming. The check in time is super flexible because it's a coded lock box and you don't have to worry about meeting up to exchange keys. We checked in close to 11pm.
Walking through the neighbourhood at night we felt completely safe. It's a suburban. Couldn't see many homeless people around.

The location is amazing. Minutes away from the light rail. It's simple, one line (blue line), no need to worry which train to catch just which direction. It takes you both from/to the airport and into downtown. Only $5 for a day pass (unlimited light rail rides) it also runs every 10min until almost 1am.

There's also an amazing organic food store called PCC!! They sell almost every sort of food you could ever want!! Both hot and cold food. They have a deli, pizza, mexican, self serve food, they have a pay by the pound system which is really fair, you never feel like you're getting ripped off. They also have a whole supermarket attached!!

The only one negative I could think of is the roof is low hanging. I'm 6'2 (189cm) and had to duck under the 2 beams when walking towards the bathroom/kitchen. If you're under 6' you wouldn't need too. Other than that. It's an amazing place :)

We both wish we could've stayed longer in Seattle at Samantha's place. It was truly amazing.
-Byron & Tanisha"
5175464,51944719,2015-10-25,4964293,Jeff,Awesome!  Had a great stay. 
5175464,54171344,2015-11-16,47660392,Angela,"place is ok,
Samantha  is very nice and helpful when I need assistance. "
443942,9575952,2014-01-02,46826,Roxanne,"Beb's space was exactly what I look for when staying in a bigger city - clean, uncluttered apartment with wonderful views in a secure building, easy walking in a great neighborhood, access to public transportation, and a generous host that was flexible with checking in and out.

My boyfriend (now fiancé!) surprised me this trip, and we were both very comfortable. The apartment is listed to sleep 2, and we both fit on the very firm twin futon just fine (same size we use when camping). We didn't do much cooking, but we were able to reheat some food on the stove for a quick snack.

We loved seeing all the art! My fiancé is a photography hobbyist and recognized a photo series almost immediately - he felt it was an honor to have a host that had given him inspiration in his own work.

The price was a little outside our normal travel budget, but really worth every penny to end the day in a place that feels like home and encourages us to enjoy the city instead of flipping on some big screen TV. I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for something above and beyond the local hotels!"
443942,12957659,2014-05-15,8013961,Chris,Beb was very easy to deal with and his place was very clean and just as the photos showed.  The location is ideal and I would definitely recommend this place.
443942,14207088,2014-06-14,1994525,Lisa,"Beb was very easy to communicate with and extremely responsive; his apartment is the perfect location--accessible to anything you need to do in Downtown/Belltown, but also walkable to Capitol Hill (~20 minute walk). Also, you can't beat being just a block away from Top Pot Doughnuts!

The space is clean with lots of windows and artfully decorated with photographs and clippings. His bookshelf is a gem, with some great travel books like 'The World's Most Dangerous Places.' It's the kind of setting that makes you want to think more deeply about whatever you care about and be creative.

It's downtown Seattle, so like anywhere in the area, expect a little bit of street noise and typical apartment neighbor noise (nothing significant to note, you're going to encounter this in any major city). I really liked the specific block area of Beb's place, it felt a bit safer than other parts of Belltown that I've stayed in previously. I'm sure you'll enjoy your stay here!"
443942,14867870,2014-06-28,12152201,David,"Beb's place is exactly as advertised -- simple and in a charming building on a great residential block in Belltown (close to cool bars etc., and not far from the light rail to the airport).  He was easy to communicate with via text.  Internet was down at the time which was unfortunate (though Top Pot nearby has Wifi), but other than that I would recommend. "
443942,15603022,2014-07-12,2833384,Philip,"Beb is a great host.  He took the time out to meet with me and walk through the ins/outs of coming, going and stayin in his place.  His place is clean, safe and comfortable.  It's a small bed, so no slumber party allowed.  It's in an area of town that is close to everything - anything you need is a short walk away."
443942,16741909,2014-08-01,2833384,Philip,"This was my 2nd time staying at Beb's place and everything worked well, again.  The place is clean and chic and artsy and works well for one person who wants to be close by all of the cool stuff in Seattle.  I will stay here again."
443942,17802466,2014-08-17,3586751,Ruben,Beb's place is perfect if you are looking for a central location near Seattle's top attractions.  The convenience was fantastic. He was also very communicative and accommodating as a host. Great experience overall.
443942,18693366,2014-08-30,2441460,Jacob,"Beb's apartment was clean, minimal, and thoughtfully decorated. He was also easy to communicate with via text message (I did not meet him, but his friend let me in.)

Belltown is a great location to be in, and everything I needed was in the neighborhood.

The bed was firm and small, but it served its purpose.

I would stay again in the future!"
443942,18944513,2014-09-03,8502053,Allie,The apartment was very comfortable and in a perfect area. We were able to walk almost everywhere and the building was safe and quiet! 
443942,19483672,2014-09-13,10141105,Yoshihiko,"This apartment is simply decorated and clean. And the surrounding environment is also quiet and safe. So I was able to have a comfortable stay. There was Whole Foods Market just a few blocks away from the apartment, and I could eat fresh and delicious breakfast there. 

Beb cared so much for me and for my flight schedule, so I could smoothly check in and out.

If you wish to have a relaxed stay at downtown of Seattle, then I would definitely recommend you this apartment."
443942,28824729,2015-03-30,7155788,J. Brendan,The apartment is a spartan but well located for exploring downtown Seattle with all the necessary amenities. Beb was out of town but he left helpful instructions and it was a good visit. 
443942,40467572,2015-07-31,466428,Salvador,"Beb's place was a great top floor (1 bedroom) apartment - in a truly great location in the heart of the CBD. 

Beb is clearly a talented artist and has amazing photography all over the apartment. The apartment is very spartan with a single bed (which we had to put on the floor, it was hard but decent enough). The kitchen scenario was equally spartan with enough china and cutlery for 2 people. As long as you're not keen on cooking big meals it's all good and suited our purposes. 

The bathroom is excellent. Just be aware that there is no iron or hairdryer so you'll need to adjust accordingly. 

We really enjoyed our time in Beb's apartment and would certainly recommend it for anyone/everyone else.,. as long as you don't need wifi!
"
443942,42551169,2015-08-14,20976665,Laura,"Great flat ! 
Simple but everything works well (except the wifi). The location is ideal, very close to everything to visit and the neighborhood is full of restaurants and bars. I would definitly come back to bebs appartement if I come back to Seattle !!"
6690388,36591956,2015-06-29,19455410,Zena,I enjoyed my time at the cottage very much! It was super cozy and private and had everything we needed including a good array of books and movies to keep you entertained in the evenings. Having a parking space right out front was very convenient. Diann was so helpful and checked in on our first day via text to make sure we were happy but otherwise let us see to ourselves. My boyfriend left his nalgene on the counter and she graciously offered to mail it back to him!  So kind. I would definitely recommend this space to anyone visiting Seattle. I was worried not having an air conditioner would be problematic as it was a very warm weekend while we were visiting but the cottage got a very nice cool breeze with the windows open and it wasn't an issue at all. Excellent space!
6690388,37680049,2015-07-09,35445357,Almy,"I loved the cozy cottage and the great backyard. Diann provided everything we needed like soap, shampoo, towels and even great coffee beans. The location is central to everything and you even get a private parking space. Highly recommend!"
6690388,39044007,2015-07-20,34643300,Justin,"The cottage was so nice! Diann knew we were coming in late after a day of hiking and told us where we could go to get beer and wine nearby. She made it very easy to arrive late as well, since there is keyless entry we didn't have to bother her at all arriving so late, she simply gave us the entry code by email. And when we arrived, she left us a little note hoping we had a great day of hiking! 

Many places in Seattle don't have air conditioning, but this cottage had a fantastic unit that was perfect for the hot weekend in Seattle! "
6690388,42857945,2015-08-16,30810417,Kim,"I spent almost a month at Diann’s place, and I really enjoyed my stay.  Diann was a great host and was really responsive and helpful.  The cottage was very clean, quiet and well-stocked, and it felt like home.  It was hot several days during my stay, but the air conditioner kept the place cool and comfortable, and it was nice sitting on the patio in the evenings.  The cottage is within walking distance of a bus line to downtown Seattle and is a short drive to shops and restaurants and the Burke-Gilman trail.  I would definitely stay here again.  
"
6690388,45101172,2015-08-31,38304371,Joshua,"My girlfriend and I had a fantastic stay at this pleasant cottage. It was a convenient bus trip from downtown, and its separation allowed us to enjoy comfort and quiet in the evenings. Diann was very welcoming and was very helpful. The cottage was beautiful and had all of the amenities that we needed, and the neighborhood seemed very pleasant. Overall, we had a great vacation!"
6690388,46134695,2015-09-08,37340616,Susan,"Indeed a very cheerfel, quiet cottage.   A very warm and inviting cabin in a neighborhood, but had a feeling of being in a cabin in the woods.  Beautiful landscaping and peaceful, quiet surroundings.  The cabin was very clean, charming and cozy inside, stocked with  essentials and amenities.  I thoroughly enjoyed my stay.  My host was very helpful in helping me plan my trip and was available for any questions if need be.   It was a very nice retreat in a safe neighborhood and I hope to return next year.
Thank you Diann for all your help !!
"
6690388,47172765,2015-09-16,40915472,Cristina,"Great quite place to stay in Seattle, only a 10-15 minute drive to the city center. Diann is helpful and even left her personal iron and iron board for us to use. We also really enjoyed the little back patio. "
6690388,47586817,2015-09-20,43213402,Laurie,"I LOVED STAYING IN THIS COTTAGE!  I actually live in Seattle, and have been experiencing neighborly problems, so I came to this private oasis for several days.  SOO COMFY!  Everything one could need is right there for you!  I have chronic pain and fibromyalgia; I found the pillows, bed, chairs and even carpet to be so delightfully healing!  The outside is adorable.  It is easy and close to get to wherever you may need to in Seattle.  I definitely recommend it, for those interested in an all-in-one home,  for a stay. I hope to have the opportunity to stay here again.  :)"
6690388,48331457,2015-09-25,4382750,Tessirina,"We were a little nervous with our late arrival so we were relieved Diann has such a great plan for key access!  She has hosting down to an intuitive science.  As a fellow Airbnb host, I never thought I would say this but I have Host envy!!  Not only was this cottage as cute as can be, it also has the fresh clean feeling of a brand new hotel.  It’s exactly as described but even better Diann gets AAA score for taking her hosting responsibilities to a new level.  So many wonderful touches made the stay comfortable and the process effortless before, during and after the stay.  She knew what we needed before we had to ask.  Details on the driving instructions, where to park, wifi info, code to the key access, why my phone didn’t charge in the outlet (note to self, flip the switch;) everything.  If you have a question, chances are you have the answer already.  We were perfectly informed and never had to bother Diann for anything!  Will definitely stay here for our next Seattle visit."
6690388,48796708,2015-09-28,210152,Carol,Diann's cottage and communication were both fantastic. My husband and I were completely comfortable in this cute and well-decorated space. Full kitchen and even coffee and tea provided- they definitely thought of everything.
6690388,52286790,2015-10-27,32226689,Ryan,"Great tiny home!   Perfectly comfortable, welcoming and really stylish and charming.  The  was well stocked with everything you could think of and the entire place was incredibly comfortable.   I really enjoyed my stay, it was sublime!"
6690388,52995502,2015-11-03,46316381,Clara,Everything in the description and directions was very accurate. The cottage is super cozy and very well located for us as we were in between Edmonds and Seattle a lot. About a 10 minute drive to Pikes Place Market. Very easy to get in when checking in. My husband and I found it perfect and had a lovely weekend away! 
6690388,53693388,2015-11-11,35603671,Mike And Sara,Just as described.  Great location great host and great value.  Will stay here again if in the Seattle area.  Thanks Diann.
6690388,54135560,2015-11-16,46627093,Kirsten,This little cottage was perfect for a long weekend getaway. My parents and I arrived pretty late but the pass code entrance made this super easy and convenient. Especially since we did not have to share a key!  This was a good amount of space for three people. Any more would have been too crowded. But the three of us fit very comfortably. Diann was extremely accommodating and was available to help with whatever we needed. The neighborhood was awesome. I was able to run and hike on wooded trails between houses. Very cool area overall. I definitely recommend this cottage!
6690388,55123420,2015-11-28,34784157,Tara,"Staying in this cottage was a lovely experience! My parents were very comfortable, and loved the fully stocked kitchen and easy access to everywhere they needed to be while in town. Everything was comfortable, and the host was really sweet and very responsive any time questions came up.

Thank you for a great experience, we'll be calling again!"
6690388,56856385,2015-12-19,47742908,Marilyn,"We felt at home as soon as we walked in the cottage. The neighborhood was quiet just as described in the listing. It felt like a small lake or beach community. We were impressed with the attention to detail provided both the interior and exterior of this cottage. 
Diann and Cathy were  very polite, kind and helpful. As in any relationship communication is key. "
4225225,21997165,2014-10-27,9369643,Denise,"I was looking for just one night in this part of Capitol Hill, visiting my daughter who lives a few blocks away.  Check-in was easy and the hosts were very communicative.  This room was located in the sub-basement of a nicely kept home/inn, and was clean and convenient.  There were 2 shared bathrooms on this lower level of the house;  I didn't end up sharing as there was only one other party staying on this level.  Parking is conveniently located in the back of the property.  There is a breakfast option, but I wasn't clear on that and didn't need it.  The kitchen is locked to guests and as another reviewer has suggested, it would be nice to have hot water available.  Overall, it's a private, clean, quiet and conveniently located space and I would stay here again."
4225225,22573061,2014-11-09,3514472,Mallory,What a great location!  Room was perfect.  Loved the self-check-in option.  Very easy to communicate.  Only had to wait on bathroom briefly.  Can't beat the quality and location for the price.  Will be our first choice for lodging on future trips to Seattle.  
4225225,23340886,2014-11-29,5998111,Dani,"Was a terrific experience, in every way. Beautiful room in a beautiful guesthouse in a wonderful neighborhood. Everything went smoothly and I had a great time. "
4225225,30987205,2015-04-30,1548162,Neil,Beautiful house and neighborhood - so many things to walk and see. Central to anything on the hill. Oksana provided fantastic recommendations - truly an asset to the house!

4225225,32905241,2015-05-23,31539048,Hanqing,It was a pleasant stay. And our room was neat and nice. I love the pic on the wall so much!!! The location is really good and there are several buses to downtown Seattle.
4225225,34364317,2015-06-07,22905261,Renee,We had an amazing trip to Seattle and thoroughly enjoyed staying here.  The location was perfect and the hosts were great in their recommendations on where to go and on how to get there.

4225225,45967364,2015-09-07,9954961,Alicia,I had a pleasant stay at the guesthouse. Great location in Capitol Hill and within walking distance to downtown. The hosts were friendly and the guesthouse was as described.
4225225,50117192,2015-10-09,29515974,Michelle,"I loved staying here! The location was ideal for where I was working and the house was clean and inviting.  I stayed in a downstairs room and it was a little noisy when people would walk above me, but I always travel with earplugs so it wasn't a big deal."
4225225,51360605,2015-10-19,45556149,Yna,Great experience! Place is clean and tidy. My husband and I felt at home for the weekend! The price is also great for the location. Would recommend this place for sure!
4225225,52292217,2015-10-27,47153893,Natalie,"This is one of the most beautiful places I've stayed, and the detailing was outstanding. Although I didn't see much of the hosts (they don't live there) they were very responsive to any questions I had via text or email. 

There were great links into downtown, and some great little coffee shops and yoga studios aroun the corner if that's your thing! 

I'd be glad to stay here again if I ever come back to Seattle. "
5958194,32026723,2015-05-12,29298264,Michael,"I had a great stay in this home.  It was very clean and orderly, fresh towels & linens were ready for me.  Hostess was great for tips on things to do and spots to check in the neighborhood.  They gave me easy-to-follow instructions for public transport, and car2go was readily available around there.  Location is just off the main street in West Seattle and just a short walk from where everything is happening.  I plan on contacting them when I'm next up to Seattle."
5958194,32401773,2015-05-17,29477961,Nicoleta,"I had a really great stay at Elaine's place. She is a lovely host, very friendly and full of local knowledge. Her house is stunning and exactly as it's described and shown in the photos. She has a huge selection of teas! The neighbourhood is really beautiful and close to cute shops and a Trader Joe's. And it's really close to downtown Seattle. It's like a small beach town with a laid-back feel. I would have liked to explore Alki Beach, but I didn't have enough time. I would definitely come back and stay here again! :)"
5958194,33834336,2015-06-01,18622548,Joe,"Great house, perfectly maintained! Pretty much a nice hotel quality stay. Excellent neighborhood. Highly recommended!"
5958194,34379595,2015-06-07,5912086,Laura,"Elaine did an excellent job communicating with me about how to check in and timing. She is so welcoming and easy going, it's a joy to stay with them! Their home is located in West Seattle and walking distance to many restaurants and shops. It's a lovely quiet home in a perfect Seattle Neighborhood. I will definitely stay there again if I can! "
5958194,34581261,2015-06-09,34330468,Sarah,"As an airbnb newbie I was pretty anxious booking, Elaine was amazing even before I arrived, by answering my numerous question which provided with me with the reassurance I needed (was also my first time travelling alone). When I arrived I met Elaine, who showed me around and provided me with a list of everything I would need for my stay. Elaine has an amazing knowledge about Seattle; everything she recommended that I tried was great!! And after a day of sightseeing and wandering around their area it was marvellous coming ""home"" and chatting with Elaine and Andy. I couldn't recommend their home highly enough!! I felt very much at home and hope to return one day and see everything I missed. Thanks again, Sarah X "
5958194,35239140,2015-06-16,30558459,Sabrina,"I never got to meet the owners (ships passing in the night) but they made sure I had everything I need and pastries/fruit for breakfast and left detailed instructions on the area. I used to live not far from here...it's a great location and a beautiful space! 

Can't wait to return in July and hopefully meet you then! "
5958194,35719081,2015-06-21,25245090,Justin,"A fantastic stay. Both hosts were so nice and gave us some awesome travel advice. The house is very modern, beat and tidy and very comfortable. The room and bathroom were great and having wifi also helped. They really went above and beyond for us during our stay and also provided some food for breakfast which was lovely. The best Airbnb experience I've had :) would highly recommend to anybody"
5958194,36683354,2015-06-30,33156745,Karen,"Elaine went the extra mile to make my time at her house pleasant. From sending multiple informative emails beforehand, inquiring about my food preferences and making good things available, to going out to acquire a fan for the room when the heat was breaking records, she was responsive to my needs and questions. "
5958194,37194497,2015-07-05,7962216,Rainstar,"She was in good contact from the start. She received my requests with clear answers and confirmation of her ability to accommodate them.
She was receptive to conversation but not needing it. 
The description is accurate. The home was clean and free of cleaning product or perfumey smells. 
The neighborhood residential, clean, quiet, treed. Good  parking, close to a small district. 
Easy hiway off and on, but far enough to not be noisy. Very mellow in every way. 
A joy. 
"
5958194,38139553,2015-07-13,23906696,Max,Elaine and her husband were very nice to us. The entire house was clean and organized. The house description and photos were accurate. Thank you!

The location is real good, it's close to downtown, it's close to the beach and there is many restaurants nearby. The house is a beautiful modern home with high standard. If you are in seattle this is the place to stay:-)"
5958194,42335537,2015-08-12,40233384,Jane,"Thanks to Elaine for making my inaugural AirBnB experience so smooth and pleasant. We didn't get to chat much, but she communicated well via e-mail both before my arrival and during my stay. 

The room was as advertised, and there was plenty of potential breakfast food available -- more than I have at home! 

The location was great, a few blocks from lots of restaurants and shops and convenient to several buses to downtown. West Seattle's so funky and fun!"
5958194,43676625,2015-08-21,40307075,Ji,"This is my first experience with Airbnb. Elaine made it perfect! She provided me all information I needed even though we didn't get to see each other. See you next time then:)
The area ""the Junction"" is awesome! The public transportation system was surprisingly amazing. There are fancy little shops around and it's very safe walking at night."
5958194,43961780,2015-08-23,28099192,Jonathan,"Had a lovely stay. When I arrived, there was a print out with everything I needed to know about staying there, including directions to where I was going the following morning.

They were going to the airport the same time I was and gave me a ride!"
5958194,44678328,2015-08-28,10017494,Laurence,"i enjoyed staying at Elaine's place. it was clean and modern. i would recommend this place and the host to anyone visiting seattle. 

she was very friendly and gave lots of good tips about the area and  transportation options, it was very helpful for first time seattle visitor like myself.

"
5958194,45102987,2015-08-31,26081347,Maggie,"Elaine was a wonderful host and very welcoming. The house and private room were both very neat and clean. And she went above and beyond to provide a very nice selection of breakfast options for her guests. 

Downtown Seattle was very easily accessible; however, getting to the areas north of downtown was a bit of a trek. But West Seattle was great to explore for a bit, and I wouldn't have had that chance to do that if I wasn't staying in the neighborhood. Thanks for a great first Airbnb experience! "
5958194,45690152,2015-09-05,40430544,Zachary,"Elaine was a great host and made me feel right at home.  Nice new, super-clean home with a nice room upstairs and wi-fi.  Breakfast was provided in the morning (I don't eat breakfast but the bagels and fruit looked good).  This home is in a great location blocks away from the busy central area of West Seattle with many coffee shops, restaurants, bars and other interesting places.  I stayed for three days and nights with zero issues.  I highly recommend this rental for anyone staying in Seattle, you won't be disappointed."

5958194,46924830,2015-09-14,11673574,Rachelle,"Elaine was a great host.  She provided all the necessary information before my arrival, address, door code, etc. And upon arrival, she text me to inform me, if she is out and about, to help myself to anything in the kitchen  - which was beyond what i expected from renting just a room.  Once i arrived, later in the evening, after everyone had fallen fast asleep, Elaine provide a ""welcome"" letter.  The welcome letter, provided information about the area, which is a great neighborhood  in West Seattle, but accessible by walking to the bus, which will take you  to downtown Seattle in mere minutes.  Also, there are great shops around the neighborhood and an amazing park, called Lincoln Park, where you can run, walk or just admire the general splendor of the Olympic Mountains, puget sound and Mt. Rainier.  Alki Beach is also close to Elaine's house.  Alki is a great photo opportunity for visitors, as you can take a photo of the Seattle skyline, which is quite impressive on a sunny day (which i had for two of my three days).  My room at Elaine's place was just as advertised and included towels, shampoo and conditioner, body wash and continental breakfast.  Overall, i felt very lucky to have found such a great Airbnb.  I also had the opportunity to briefly speak with Elaine as she was quite busy with outdoor activities on such beautiful days in Seattle.  Elaine was a very kind and generous host.  You would be lucky to stay at Elaine's place'"
5958194,47642998,2015-09-21,35892268,Devin,I had a great time here! They made me feel very comfortable and answered every question I had. Such a beautiful modern house to stay in. I highly recommend it! 
5958194,48600097,2015-09-27,43979615,Felix,"Elaine and Andy have been welcoming. They had been very accommodating of my check in time, and the info given for getting there was clear. I received a welcoming cheese and fruit platter upon arrival, which was very nice of Elaine (I left some cheese in the fridge and forgot about them, sorry! xp). The neighborhood is nice, safe and quiet. The house is very new, and in general the room was as advertised and within expectation. It takes about ten minutes walk to the Alaska junction and bus stop for the C-line rapid bus. It takes about 15 minutes to downtown, which is reasonable. The bus comes very frequently. In general, I would recommend this place to other travellers to Seattle."
5958194,51207399,2015-10-18,45926250,Dionisia,"I felt very safe in the house, it was clean, and spacious. I would absolutely stay again!

It's very memoriable trip!"
2830174,12324423,2014-04-28,12305253,Reky,"This place is a great deal (beyond expectations!) and Katrina is an amazing host! I booked the room last minute and she was very accommodating. I had a great time hanging out with her. Not only as a host she provided me with ample info about awesome places and activities in Seattle, but also as a person she is very friendly and easy to talk to. Her place is fantastic. Great location, there are so many things to do in the neighborhood and it's very close to downtown. The room is very cozy, clean and well decorated. The bedroom is comfortable too.  It also has a nice view of the city and the mountain! I would come back and stay there again :)"
2830174,12386077,2014-04-30,753061,Kirsty,We had a great stay with Katrina. She was warm and welcoming and made us feel very comfortable in her home. Katrina took the time to talk to us about things to do and see in Seattle and helped us find our way around. We found it easy to get to everything we needed from her place. We would definitely recommend staying here. 
2830174,12510048,2014-05-04,313372,Richard,"We had a blast at Katrina's place and found her to be the perfect, attentive hostess. She made us feel not just welcome, but pampered."
2830174,12582386,2014-05-05,11763359,Allyson,I enjoyed my stay in Katrina's apartment.  It is conveniently located close to downtown Seattle and there was plenty of free parking on the street.  The neighborhood is close to I-5 and is extremely quiet.  Her place is neat and clean.  Katrina is friendly and made me feel at home.  I especially appreciated the basket of toiletries she has out for her guests as I had forgotten my toothbrush.  Thanks again!
2830174,12733345,2014-05-09,3709526,Julie,"Thank you so much for your hospitality Katrina, we spent a great time at your place. We are really glad that we stayed with you and had the opportunity to meet you. If one day we come back we know exactly where we would go ;)."
2830174,13047472,2014-05-18,14910815,Carissa,"I had a lovely stay at Katrina's place. It is near cute cafés, the international district and the bus route into downtown. At the light rail station I loaded an Orca card with $20, so I never had to use cash on the bus. I kept pretty busy with a week-long course at the nearby Pacific Medical building (within walking distance). One night Katrina introduced me to the Olympic Sculpture Park, and we walked by the Sound at sunset and then grabbed dinner. Katrina is sweet, smart, and easygoing. She has great knowledge of the area and lots of travel brochures ready. I would love to stay with her again, and I wish she would visit me!"
2830174,13763256,2014-06-03,5273007,Rhea,Nice stay in Seattle. Very convenient location by public transportation. Thank you Katrina for picking up us!
2830174,13854823,2014-06-06,15266787,Sue,"My cousin and I stayed at this place and we loved it!! It was our first time in Seattle so we explored everywhere and it was really nice to go back to the apartment,  away from the city, to relax. Her place is conveniently located between two bus stops. The room was clean and she even had small Toiletries ready for us to use in case we didn't bring any. There were an abundance of maps and pamplets that were all very useful to us. I'd recommend staying here if you are visiting Seattle!"
2830174,14231738,2014-06-15,14983718,Laura,"My stay in Seattle was greatly enhanced by staying with Katrina. Her space is warm and welcoming, with a lovely balcony on which to enjoy breakfast or a book. The location is quiet but easily accessible, in a beautiful neighborhood and right next door to a large and beautiful community garden. We enjoyed walking around the international district, and Katrina's helpful suggestions about the city made our trip much more exciting. "
2830174,14497802,2014-06-20,6166127,Amy,"I needed to find a place for a short stay in Seattle, and Katrina's apartment was perfect! It is a peaceful, cozy space in a nice neighborhood and the apartment itself was spotless - I felt right at home. Katrina was very friendly and welcoming, and her suggestions for how I might spend my time in the city made for an excellent day! It is easy to reach the apartment by public transportation both from the airport and downtown. I'd definitely stay here again!"
2830174,15580012,2014-07-12,6733809,Susan,"Lovely host! We really appreciated Katrina's friendliness and flexibility as we coordinated our stay in Seattle! 
Great and reliable correspondences, and all-around very welcoming. :) "
2830174,16205111,2014-07-23,15648304,Anna,"Katrina was a generous, thoughtful, and knowledgable host, and her apartment was very clean and inviting.

We felt very comfortable and at home in Katrina's place, and can't wait for our next trip!"
2830174,16624879,2014-07-30,15885314,William,"Katrina was a very caring host and came to pick us up from the light rail station. She was very helpful in driving and showing us around the various place we needed to go in the morning to fix a sim card, good eats, etc.

I would stay there again anytime!"
2830174,16792826,2014-08-02,17927806,Anthony,"Katrina's Seattle launchpad was the perfect place for a mid-week start to a long weekend in the Pacific Northwest. The apartment is a quick bus ride from the light rail station and has a few great coffee shops and bakeries nearby. The apartment itself is perfect and exactly how it was described in the listing. I had a private bedroom and access to the shared bathroom and kitchen throughout the day and there is a balcony with a table and chairs that has a fantastic view of Beacon Hill and downtown Seattle. It was the perfect place to enjoy a banh mi sandwich from one of the many Vietnamese restaurants that also dot Katrina's neighborhood.

As for the host, Katrina was most gracious in helping me get my trip started and sharing bus and ferry schedules as well as helping me navigate an early morning run to check out the Blue Angels who were in town for Seafair weekend. I will definitely be back."
2830174,17512873,2014-08-13,7941417,Ayla,Katrina was extremely helpful in planning our trip and continued to help with directions and transportation around the city. She even picked us up from dinner on our first night in town and drove us downtown so we would make it to the theatre on time for a show! Our room was clean and welcoming including a cute basket of travel essentials and maps. The shared spaces were very clean and Katrina generously shared coffee and her kitchen highlights of Seattle. It was a great stay with an awesome host and we highly recommend the Seattle Launchpad!
2830174,18626659,2014-08-29,7598434,Kathleen,"Katrina was an incredible host! Her place was very centrally located and she was a great resource for all Seattle has to offer. Thank you, Katrina!!"

Every morning I was able to do my stretches in front of the big window, while watching hummingbirds, drinking coffee and listening to NPR. PERFECT way to start a day!"
2830174,27516780,2015-03-06,12393648,Brian,"Katrina was a very friendly and welcoming host and was very accommodating to my late arrival. Her apartment is both well decorated and cozy and was the perfect place for me to stay during a business trip to Seattle. There is a bus stop less than a 10 minute walk away where I caught a bus to downtown, a trip that lasted only 15 minutes or so. I certainly recommend staying with Katrina and hope to do so again myself in the future."
2830174,27730321,2015-03-10,27701334,Nicole,"Staying at Katrina's place was fabulous! She provided me with great recommendations regarding the city, and even had a basket of maps and city info in the room. The room itself was very clean and comfortable and had a basket full of toiletries Incase we forgot anything.  The deck has an amazing view with a cute bistro table to sit at and enjoy the l beautiful sunshine we had during our stay.  The  neighborhood feels really safe, is quiet and was close to a bus stop making getting around really easy. I'll definitely be staying here again when I'm back in Seattle.  Our host was more than accommodating. She def had a gift for hosting others. She made me feel like a friend from day one,  but not in a way that Someone might be uncomfortable with.  I had a windfall first experience using airBNB "
2830174,27972015,2015-03-15,3180013,Grace,"Katrina was wonderfully flexible and attentive with our needs. The space was cozy, and Katrina's hospitality made it that much better. Thanks so much!!"
2830174,31730857,2015-05-09,31517059,Martin,I arrived slightly later than planned - 10pm rather than 9pm. Katrina actually picked me up from the train station which was far more than I expected. Thanks! The location is really nice and Katrina made me feel really welcome.
2830174,34320768,2015-06-07,9726228,Don,The space is clean and comfortable. I'd recommend it to anyone looking for a nice place to stay. Katrina is a wonderful host. She made me and the family I was visiting feel welcome and comfortable. 
2830174,34677186,2015-06-10,33637193,Julia,"Me and my boyfriend stayed at Katrina's for one night during our trip to Seattle. Katrina was lovely, and made sure we felt at home. She offered us plenty of advice for touristy stuff to do around the city, and even wrote down some must-sees on a note for us to bring. Katrina was very flexible and asked if we wanted coffee in the morning, at what time we wanted to shower, and so on. The only downside was that the bed was a bit too hard and lumpy for me. It wouldn't be a deal breaker for us though, and would definitely stay at Katrina's again. We loved the area too! "
2830174,36204518,2015-06-26,34012316,Bobby,"This was our first AirBNB experience and it was amazing.  Katrina is an all star.  She was in constant communication with us, before and during our visit.  She was very welcoming, kind, and generous.  Her home is easy to locate, great distance from the convention center and all the touristy places.  Uber was less than $9 each way.  She has everything ready to go.  She had coffee in the morning.  She let us eat some PBJ.  She treated us like family.  She treated us with such great Love, I am so thankful.  If all airbnb-ers are like this. I'm sold.  One moment that really stuck out: most places don't have AC.  It was hotter than normal during the time we were there, but Katrina has one fan.  She graciously let us borrow it, while we were sleeping.  A very selfless person.  Would stay again, any time.  Thanks for being the greatest host.  "
2830174,36302248,2015-06-27,34346353,Lauren,"This place was great! My boyfriend and I were staying for three nights and this was the perfect (first) AirBnB experience. So glad we chose Katrina. She was extremely welcoming, friendly, and went above and beyond to give us help around the city. Her home had toiletries ready for us, maps to find our way, closet space, and even free morning coffee!!!! Seattle weather was amazing for us Texans and we were able to spend a few minutes one evening on her patio with the great view! So peaceful. Can not thank her enough for welcoming us!! Recommending to a few of our friends visiting Seattle soon! "
2830174,46627852,2015-09-12,41843510,Alena,"This worked perfectly for me and was an enjoyable place to stay :-) 

I drove to Seattle for a conference and was able to park my car without a problem. I walked the mile to the conference in the morning, when it was very pleasant, then used uber to get back after dark. This kept me from having to worry about parking.

Katrina and her apartment made me feel comfortable and welcome. The balcony was a nice place to have breakfast in the morning. It is a quiet area and Katrina has set up an entire basket full of essentials you might need.

Although it was not a problem for me, the mattress is a futon, and water pressure isn't great. Did not take away from my fabulous stay"
7266662,40967752,2015-08-03,35225360,Angela,Scott and Paulina provided a great place to stay. We felt comfortable and had everything we needed for our 4 night stay. It was easy to get to and from downtown Seattle from their home. A great alternative to staying in the City.
7266662,41477104,2015-08-07,6441854,Natalia,"Scott's place was a picturesque looking bungalow in a pleasant neighborhood. Scott and his wife were friendly hosts who gave recommendations on directions and food. 
Their dogs were friendly too! I'd stay here again."
7266662,42452163,2015-08-13,5614294,Alexandra,"I had a great time at Scott and Paulina's place. I stayed there for a week in August and felt right at home! Pete and Milo are wonderful, playful dogs and the room I had was very clean, convenient and discrete with a large bathroom all to myself. Scott and Paulina were very discrete and provided thoughtful suggestions regarding things to do and see around Seattle. I'd definitely recommend them or stay there again when I'm in Seattle."
7266662,43259357,2015-08-18,36617625,Jennifer,"Scott and Paulina were lovely hosts. We stayed for 5 days and they made us feel more than welcome! Bedroom has lots of natural light, with a comfortable bed and linens. Bathroom is perfectly appointed-- both are very clean.

Their two dogs- Peat and Milo are a great addition to your stay. They are so friendly and happy to receive attention!

A wonderful place to stay- quiet, close to downtown (we took Uber & Lyft back and fourth) great restaurants, coffee shops, shopping & all the attractions-- a great alternative to staying at a hotel. We would love to stay again and would absolutely recommend to others! "
7266662,43847183,2015-08-22,8030997,Sara,"Scott's place near Capitol Hill was great.  It's easy to get downtown or to the University by bus.  Also it was very close to Seattle U.   

The house and bedroom were very comfortable and spotless.  We only ran into the hosts once or twice while we were there over two nights, and they were always friendly and helpful with directions.  I'd definitely recommend it!"
7266662,44316238,2015-08-25,20237896,Tracy,"Scott and Paulina were awesome hosts. Their home was very close to all the places we wanted to visit (pike place market, safeco, downtown, etc) and was very comfortable. Their dogs were adorable and their house has a ton of historical character. Would highly recommend for anyone who wants to be centrally located!"
7266662,45388315,2015-09-02,8425076,Mitchell,"We had an excellent stay with Scott and Paulina. They were available and helpful even during their work week. Neighborhood is walkable to several restaurants, cafes, and parks. We rented a car where they had ample parking options (but their house is well connected to public transit). House and room were very true to pictures and very well kept (ie clean, well decorated, and comfy).
Truly they attended to all the details to make it a nice stay- offering several maps of the area and other helpful info, good storage space and extra blankets in the dresser, the toilet paper was even folded over as in a hotel. They also had nice amenities in the room including a coat rack and a power strip. 
Would recommend staying with them!"
7266662,46144428,2015-09-08,38574390,Doug,"really enjoyed my stay with Scott, his wife and their 2 big and friendly dogs.  Even though no  one was home at my arrival, we'd made arrangements ahead of time  and all was good.  The room was fine and spacious with a comfortable bed.  access down the  hall to the  bathroom.  Nice, quite neighborhood -- I did a lot of walking and catching buses that run close by - excellent transit system in Seattle.  I felt totally  safe all the time.  The  hosts were very  helpful as needed and not intrusive at all.  While I  did not use  the kitchen, it was available.
i'd stay  here again and would recommend to friends or family."

7266662,48293003,2015-09-25,12323725,Geoff,"Scott was a great host. Communication was good, the house was clean, and the room/bed was comfortable. And the location was central and convenient."

This studio was exactly as described and pictured.  Charlie and Jesse were there to greet me when I arrived and gave me a tour of the home and how to work all the appliances and washer/dryer – which included detergent and dryer sheets! They provided me with my own code for the door and stocked the room with treats.  All the cooking amenities and spices were stocked which was a huge bonus because I love to cook!  You can’t go wrong with a Keurig coffee in the morning either!  The studio is in a very quiet neighborhood, and the patio area is secluded and completely private. 
The walk to Columbia City and the light rail was easy and I got downtown to Seattle easily.  On the way back home, PCC was right there so I stocked up on dinner and grilled on the bbq.  Charlie recommended seeing a show at the Royal Room which was awesome! 
Great place to stay and I would definitely stay again when I get back to Seattle!  I plan to bring my girlfriend back for one of their Seahawk weekend packages at the end of the year!"
7263506,52555748,2015-10-30,47482889,Diane,"I had to stay in Seattle for business and was pleasantly surprised to walk into this unit and feel like I never left home. Far from a stuffy hotel room and not just a sofa to crash on in someone's living room; I got an entire apartment all to myself! Yes please.

Jesse and Charlie (Edwin) were so warm and welcoming and I never felt like I was invading their home. Both friendly and genuine, I got a tour of the space, and felt like I was welcomed into the 'family' all the while was left alone to 100% privacy.  Apparently the space from previously rented out but recently converted just for Air BnB and I have to say as an Interior Designer, they did an awesome job creating a comfy retreat for travelers. 

I slept like a baby in the new bed and was able to stretch out as there was plenty of places to sit and hang my clothes. There is even a laundry room in the unit. Although it was just me staying there, at one point the three of us were sitting in the living area comfortably proving there is plenty of space for more.

Located in Columbia City, there are restaurants and bars  just down the street with live music and energy. Although I had a car with me, the home is minutes from the rail system which takes you directly to the airport and all around Seattle so you could save a fortune in Uber and Taxi rides. I recommend this spot to anyone traveling business or pleasure and wanting to save cash for their adventures instead of spending it all on expenses!

7263506,53099319,2015-11-04,47712709,Casey,"This was a great place to stay - easy to find, clean and quiet. Charlie and Jesse were great hosts. They greeted me when I arrived, offered a tour of the studio and great ideas about what to do in Columbia City. They asked if I had any food allergies or dietary restrictions and provided a basic continental breakfast. The photos of the studio were spot on and I would stay here again."
7263506,54349201,2015-11-18,48729009,Jeannette,"What a fantastic experience! My husband and I desperately needed a place for his very nice, but also very particular parents to stay during their recent visit to Seattle. We live in Seattle's Columbia City neighborhood and were hoping to find something that was not only close to us, but also near all of the cute shops and restaurants that line this historic neighborhood's 'main street.' Charlie and Jesse's private mother-in-law studio was exactly what we were looking for! This studio is absolutely charming with so many thoughtful details and amenities that greatly impressed my in-laws- the immaculate and well decorated space, the kitchen, fireplace, washer and dryer, and last but not least the amazing breakfast delivered on the weekend. Charlie and Jesse were the perfect hosts- friendly, communicative and thoughtful. I will definitely have my family stay here again and would recommend this spot to anyone.   "
7263506,55088760,2015-11-27,49379425,Susan & Todd,"We recently traveled across the state to take up the offer from Charlie & Jesse for the Seahawk Weekend Package. After the long drive, we were pleasantly surprised at how easy it was to find the house, just off I-90.  Tucked away in a quiet neighborhood , this B&B is a real gem.  We even had our own reserved off street parking spot! Charlie & Jesse met us at the gate and helped us get settled in.  We decided to dine in after a recommendation from Jesse for a nearby Thai Restaurant.  Wow was that good!  We spent the rest of the evening enjoying ourselves in this cozy getaway. Although we never had a chance to use it, they've even provided a washer/dryer in the room.  The next morning we had fresh coffee and goodies from a well stocked pantry.  They seem to have thought of everything someone might need.  Game Time! We walked 15 minutes to the light rail, and off to the stadium we went. We literally got off across from the gate to our seats! For us, the seats were the best in the house! And the Seahawks WON!!! Getting back was just as easy . This was when we truly enjoyed the layout and amenities of this well thought-out B&B. We had everything we needed to make ourselves feel at home.  We'll be back!  Go Seahawks!  And Thank You Charlie and Jesse for your kind hospitality!
"
7263506,56734356,2015-12-17,49438340,Scott,This was my first experience using Airbnb and I was completely impressed. Charlie met me at the property and was very attentive and made feel at home even after I made him rush home because my day ended quicker than I planned. I would definitely stay here again.
9294683,53803229,2015-11-12,43134218,Courtney,Matt did an excellent job making himself available and making sure our stay was as comfortable as possible. The unit is great and really nice inside. It felt like a hotel. The view from the roof is truly amazing. And the location could not be any better. Literally perfect. Would defiantly recommend to anyone looking for a great Seattle experience.
9294683,53870596,2015-11-13,15449573,Morgan,"Such a great place to stay in Seattle!! Very central location. Right next to Pike Place market. We walked up to the space needle as well. Endless amount of restaurants to walk to and easy walk to the shopping district. Also, the rooftop was AMAZING! The ferris wheel was right out front. Definitely going to stay here again!!"
9294683,54365181,2015-11-18,15449573,Morgan,"Excellent place to stay. Went to a follow-up meeting downtown, then went shopping, and walked the entire time. Washer and dryer in the apartment and a wine cooler! Highly recommended! "
9294683,54495157,2015-11-20,28230940,Aj,"AMAZING!!!
This is probably the best place to stay in downtown Seattle. Very clean apartment with a great shower. The location could not be better! Endless amount of restaurants to walk to. We walked to the Space Needle and stop at 3 different restaurants along the way. The Pikes Place Market is right next door. And the rooftop has the same view as the 5 Star - Four Seasons Luxury Hotel!"
9294683,56510983,2015-12-14,48891856,Charles,"Matt and Dan are great. My wife and I had a great time during our stay. They were very accommodating as we arrived in the city earlier than expected and made the place available to us on short notice. Place was very clean and a great location with a roof top deck view of the water. Would highly recommend this as a great, warm, cozy place to get a reprieve from the sporadic rain and what seemed to be constant cold (from so cal, not use to this ind of weather). Want to reiterate a great location, right across the street from the four seasons."
9294683,56741824,2015-12-17,28062669,Geoffrey,"Great apartment, great location, great experience.  I would stay at Matt & Dan's place again in a heartbeat."
9294683,56825303,2015-12-18,51272481,Jason,"Apartment was very well kept. It felt like I walked into a hotel. If you're planning on staying in Seattle for a couple of days then this is the place. Not even a 2 minute walk from Pike Market, the price is a steal for the location. Great job guys! Thank you!"
9294683,56945868,2015-12-20,3241676,Keith,"Awesome experience all around!  From booking until check out, Matt and Dan made the process as smooth as possible and we're super flexible.  On top of that, the apartment was incredible. Everything you could need was available, the rooftop provided some incredible views of the city along the waterfront, and the location was prefect.  Just step out the door and you are in Pike's Place Market in addition to easy walking distance to Belltown and Capital Hill.
Next time I'm in there area, I will definitely book with Matt and Dan again!

Thanks Fellas!

Keith "
9294683,57180019,2015-12-22,8246449,Jackie,"All those other reviews saying this place is perfect? Here's another one. We only stayed one night, but will definitely bookmark this place for future stays. As locals, born and raised in Seattle, we found the location probably couldn't be more perfect. The apartment is super clean and cozy. The only non- awesome thing is parking, but everything else is on point. Thanks guys!!"
9294683,57237449,2015-12-23,33523272,Tylo,"The apartment was amazingly close to Pike Place and downtown Seattle. It was a nice modern and clean room and we both loved the room and felt comfortable staying there. The location of the place honestly could not have been beaten for the price it was listed, strongly recommend. "
9294683,57340491,2015-12-24,19510340,Sharla,Very good location for a lean and cozy apartment! Matt and Dan were fast to respond. Highly recommend. 
9294683,57554171,2015-12-27,34979224,Brian,"Awesome Awesome place to stay!    It is right next to the market place, very convenient and everything you need is around the apartment walking distance. 
Everything was clean and neat inside and if you need anything or any question Matt is always available to answer which was nice.   
Thank you"
9294683,57794091,2015-12-29,35509019,Tracy,"Get location to all the sights you'd wanna see in Seattle. Short walk to mall area which provided a monorail to the Space Needle. Literally one block away from Pike Place Market. 

Great communication, the condo was very clean, & perfect size for someone on the go exploring the city. Great view from roof top. Matt & Dan were great hosts. "
9294683,58062474,2015-12-31,9999172,Max,Real nice place in real nice part of town. Pretty much feels like a hotel yet still prob much cheaper then 4 seasons next door. Great location central to everything. 
5968862,36296107,2015-06-27,28997393,Laurie,"A bag of coffee beans and cream in the frig, a bottle of wine, and a list necessary housekeeping instructions made us feel welcome and immediately at home. The house is extremely clean with lovely decor, comfortable furnishings and beds, and a well-stocked kitchen. The listing description is extremely accurate - the home is definitely a ""charming craftsman"".  We especially enjoyed the beautiful backyard outdoor space, a huge flatscreen TV, and a Sonos sound system. My husband and I were traveling with another couple and the house provided both privacy and plenty of room for the 4 of us.

The neighborhood itself is quiet with friendly neighbors and ample parking. Ballard is a great community, near enough to easily access downtown Seattle, but providing it's own delightful main street shops, restaurants and activities as well.  

Anne and Casey are  thoughtful hosts that truly desire their guests to enjoy their home as if it was their own. Upon request, Anne provided excellent suggestions for restaurants and site-seeing ideas that catered to our preferences and made our visit to Seattle super fun and stress free.  "
1856253,8616632,2013-11-08,874122,Rob,"Carol was a great host. She provided everything I needed for a comfortable stay. The bedroom and bed where right next to the bathroom, but the distracting noise was minimal. The location was great with buses going downtown and the U district. The house has a great view overlooking the neighborhood. Her dog, Watson, has very affectionate once you got to now him. I would definitely recommend staying at Carol's house."
1856253,10896642,2014-03-11,12815857,Rachel,"Carol is a lovely host. Her home is incredibly charming, and it's in a sweet neighborhood within walking distance to Golden Gardens. Recommended!"

1856253,12230733,2014-04-26,2140761,Chantal,"Carol's home was filled with incredible mid-century elements and inviting light. She was a lovely host-- so warm and friendly, and gave a ton of great advice for traveling in the area. I will definitely go back to stay with Carol when I'm in Seattle again. Also love the neighborhood surrounding her house and it's proximity to the incredible Golden Gardens beach."
1856253,13170723,2014-05-20,3193556,Giorgio,"Carol has been a wonderful host, taking her time to show me around the city a bit and her input made my stay a very special one, I feel I got a small hook on the city even if I was there for just a couple of days.
The house is really very nice and very originally decorated.
The location is in a quiet area a stroll from a park / beach, and a few good cafes around, plus Ballard and downtown Seattle are just a few minutes away by car.

Overall a great place to stay, highly recommended!"

She was friendly and very knowledgeable about Ballard and Seattle, and her suggestions for activities really made my Seattle experience as fantastic as it could be. The room was comfortable and clean, her home is gorgeous, and I could not have asked for a better first airbnb experience. Many thanks =)"

1856253,19112573,2014-09-06,965702,Lisa,"Carol is a great, laid back host. I had a wonderful short stay with her in Seattle. Great Ballard restaurants and shopping are just a short drive or bike away from the house, and you can walk to the beach. Great location and value!! Thanks Carol!"
1856253,19452494,2014-09-12,56724,Erik,Carol was a very nice host! Accommodated me at the very last second! Definitely recommended to the airbnb community!

I have never imagined such a wonderful  time I could have. 
Carol is a tolerant, creative, and attractive person. 
Honestly I was a little bit tired of my staying in Seattle, 
but it was totally healed by beautiful time with her.
Thank you so much, Carol. "

This was my second stay at an Airbnb, and the experience just got better at Carol's place.  Cute room, comfy bed and nice people, couldn't ask for more.  Hope to stay there again next time I visit Ballard."
1856253,21646246,2014-10-20,351043,Wesley,"Carol was great. Welcoming and accommodating. The room was cozy and comfortable, and the bathroom wonderfully luxurious. The neighborhood is quiet and pretty, and I was able to walk to the more happening part of lower Ballard in about 20-25 minutes. A lovely walk too! Oh and Watson the dog is small but mighty and cute. Highly recommended."
1856253,27238265,2015-02-28,1528522,Laura,My experience staying with Carol was wonderful! The room was comfortable spacious and I felt like I had my own space. Carol was warm and welcoming. I would surely stay here again!
1856253,27806981,2015-03-12,9796846,Stacee,"Staying at Carol's place couldn't have been lovelier. She greeted me at the door, showed me where everything was, and then left me to nap and prepare for a work function later that night in the nearby Ballard neighborhood. The room was exactly as shown in the photographs -- clean, comfortable, quiet and right next to a fabulous little bathroom, that looks to have been recently renovated. The twin bed was really, really comfortable and piled high with warm, fluffy blankets. I would stay at Carol's house again in a heartbeat. Such a colorful, cool little place -- complete with a welcoming, laid-back, friendly host."
1856253,28673009,2015-03-28,1528522,Laura,Great repeat visit to this peaceful room. I have nothing bad to say. Would definitely book again!
1856253,29716181,2015-04-11,20994213,Karen,I thoroughly enjoyed my stay with Carol and Watson the dog. :) Not only is her home artistic & inspiring but she is the hostess with the most-ess. She had cookies my last day and even though I was stuffed from dinner the house smelled lovely. I felt very welcome & relaxed. The room is quiet & comfortable. Never heard a peep from her awesome dog Watson. (He's a total schloopy) I slept like a log after a long day of seeing friends & family all day in town.  The neighborhood is the best in Ballard. Highly recommended!
1856253,30705128,2015-04-26,599746,Lise,I love the relaxed atmosphere and whimsical feel of Carols home. In particular I appreciate the ease with which I could come and go. Thank you

The space was perfect with a spring breeze and the bed was so comfortable I didn't want to get up in the morning! A wonderful place to rest your head while in the Seattle area--with the most gracious of hosts. Thank you for a wonderful stay!"
1856253,34368837,2015-06-07,31857281,Angela,I had a very peaceful time at carol's home. Very nice location. I went to the beach everyday and got my workout fix from the stairs and a jog with a view of the water. I took a class at Swedish hospital in Ballard and it was a very fast drive to and from. There was always nearby parking at her place too. Carol was very nice and so was her son and pup!
1856253,35610805,2015-06-20,9131706,Leo,I had a pleasant stay at Carols house. It was close to everything and the beach was super close. I would stay there again. 
1856253,36725678,2015-06-30,35595339,Cathy," I liked the location near Golden Gardens.  The room was very comfortable for a multiple night stay. A great location with close bus lines, a nearby beach  and easy to get into Seattle or nearby Ballard. I would stay here again."
1856253,45895275,2015-09-06,24172591,Meredith,Carol was really flexible with my arrival time and the room is just like the picture.
1856253,46834225,2015-09-13,43740592,Clara,"Carol was friendly, inviting and easy-going. She greeted me when I arrived and had a folder that included transportation routes and maps of personally recommended sights and restaurants in the area. Communicating with her before my arrival was easy and she responds quickly.

The description of the room is spot-on and the pictures are accurate. There was even a personal coffee pot in the room and complimentary coffees. Carol's house is also full of eclectic and whimsical details that combine beautifully into a charming and cozy home. Modern vintage feel indeed.

The neighborhood of Ballard is beautiful and less than a mile from the shores of the Puget Sound. I had a simply wonderful time walking around and suggest checking out the nearby Golden Gardens Park and Sunset Hill Park if you have the time, especially on a clear day. I would definitely stay here again if I am ever back in this area of Portland!"
1856253,47024444,2015-09-14,10979834,Teressa,"Carol was very accommodating, as some of my travel plans got mixed up I had to find somewhere to stay relatively last minute. Everything was very clean and nice, good location!"
1856253,51228302,2015-10-18,44034421,Christy,"This was my first airbnb experience and it was fantastic. Carol was super accommodating with my checkin/checkout times because of the timing of my flights.  She also made suggestions for places to go and navigating the city, which was incredibly helpful. The house was warm and welcoming and I slept great.  I would totally stay here again when I come to town. "
1856253,53309655,2015-11-07,2995234,Constance,"I was grateful when Carol agreed to host me for a few nights with just a few days in advance of my request. I love the Ballard area of Seattle, and her home looked welcoming. Indeed, it was, and she made me feel instantly at home. I reluctantly left my cozy bed early each morning for work, but it was among life's singular pleasures to return each night to the home's portal: a wooden door beneath an arched trellis, illuminated by twinkling faerie lights. Then it was back to that fabulous bedstead into which I snuggled for a night's good rest. Not before reading a chapter or two by the lamp light perched in just the right place. Wonderful details that made my travel a source of refreshment. Many thanks to Carol, her son, and her pup. "
5078129,26553553,2015-02-15,1794375,Ben And Kirsten,"We had a wonderful stay in Seattle. They've really gone above and beyond to make this airbnb a homey comfortable space.There was plenty of space for the four of us, and the neighborhood is well located for travelers. The wine and chocolate for Valentines Day was especially thoughtful!"
5078129,27608610,2015-03-08,27946118,Sarah,"Home away from home!  Spacious, super cozy and very clean!  Amy and her family were so incredibly hospitable.  From the thoughtful treats to a perfectly stocked supply of everything...we would stay here again in a heartbeat!  Located perfectly for our mapped out weekend of all Seattle's best!  Walking distance to other great shops and restaurants too.  The little things make a huge difference, and Amy's personal touch throughout her place is spectacular."
5078129,27958896,2015-03-15,21747505,Lorra,"This spot was perfect for our 1 night getaway.  The bedroom was set up as kind of a studio, and it was quite large. We had everything we needed, and it was clean and cozy."
5078129,28470114,2015-03-24,26710242,Nicholas,"Our flight was late and Amy was nice enough to allow us to check in and arrive at their place way past their check in time. My friends and I were traveling from LA on a red-eye flight and we really appreciated them staying up to greet us at the door. Her husband showed us around the accommodations and my first thought was that it was very cozy and inviting! The area is very clean and look exactly like the photos on the listing. Everything from towels and even soap were provided, and much appreciated. We were all surprised at how cozy it was in the basement, especially with Seattle being a fairly colder climate than what we were used to. The  neighborhood is a bit far from the city, yet with just a 30minute bus ride, it was not too much of a hassle. The neighborhood is quiet, with close proximity to a town with a number of great restaurants to eat at, such as Ramen, Thai, and a homemade ice cream shop! Amy was a great host in coordinating when we would be arriving and as well checking out. I also appreciated when Amy notified me about a cardigan my friend left behind and mailed it to us immediately! "
5078129,28663972,2015-03-28,28641562,Clover,We enjoyed be near Wallingford and Green Lake.  It is a great place for a family to stay.
5078129,28899662,2015-03-31,29297451,Josh,Amy was a very friendly and a forgiving host. Thank you for the great stay. We hope we werent bad visitors.
5078129,29471842,2015-04-07,30508189,Mark,"We really enjoyed our stay at this location.  Amy was a wonderful host.  The place met our expectations.  The location itself was fantastic - close to the places we were visiting (UW, SPU, and Freemont).  Our son enjoyed walking over to and jogging around Green Lake. Parking was very accessible and although we were at the intersection of two busy streets the place was pretty quiet inside. "
5078129,29568465,2015-04-09,26144917,Jacky,"This is an AMAZING listing in the city of Seattle.  A short 5 minute drive from UW, ~10 minutes to Downtown, and close to a few freeways, you're definitely in a great location with Amy's place.  The suite/den is spacious and very comfortably fit my 3 siblings and I.  We have been hotel hopping throughout the week and thought our stay here at Amy's was the best of them all.  The amenities provided are very thoughtful and truly made us feel at home.  The next time we're back in Seattle, we're most likely coming back to this spot.  You won't be disappointed!"
5078129,30035417,2015-04-16,28664250,Jasmin,"We felt so comfortable at Amy's place. The studio was just beautiful. We didn't expect to have so much luxury and were very sad when we had to leave again, as we loved this place so much. The location is just a short walk to the bus stations to downtown. Also the amazing Green Lake is only a few blocks away, we went jogging there in the morning and enjoyed it very much. In addition Amy was a very nice host and even allowed us to check-out late.
We definitely would stay there again and highly recommend this place! You won't regret it. "
5078129,30229044,2015-04-19,261798,Anne,"Great spot to have as a home base while visiting Seattle! Bed was really comfy, layout was spacious enough for 2 adults, 2 big kids and a baby, and location was really convenient for getting around town. Our host, Amy, was welcoming and left some nice treats for us and our kids, and was otherwise unobtrusive. Only (super slight) inconvenience was that the TV/movie set up is in the only room where there is space to set up the crib, so relaxing with a movie after baby goes to sleep might not be an option for people in that situation. Also, if you like to sleep with a window cracked open, it's on a busy street so street noise may be a thing to consider.  "

5078129,30789333,2015-04-27,24882622,Sean,"Probably the best AirBnb experience I've had so far. The apartment is set up for full, comfortable, livability. Very clean. Very homey. Great library if you're a baseball fan (many other good choices, too). And the neighborhood is one of my favorites in the Seattle area. Make sure you indulge in Mighty-O's doughnuts just up the hill a few blocks, or stop in to Lenny's for an impressively portioned mug of cheap beer. All in all very highly recommend. Did I mention the bottle of wine and local chocolate bar waiting for you? "
5078129,31636600,2015-05-08,28782231,Jenna,"Amy was very friendly and welcoming. She greeted us warmly and showed us exactly where everything was. The apt was fully equipped with everything we needed. Washer/dryer, full kitchen with dishes and cookware, WiFi, plenty of pillows and blankets, and the BEST touch - a terrifically detailed book of all the local grocery stores (in order of distance), public transit, sights to see, maps of the area, and general FAQs. What a thoughtful and awesome host! There was plenty of parking in the area. Apt was very clean and comfortable. We even had a bottle of wine and chocolate waiting for us when we arrive, and then the next day she offered us homemade muffins! I just can't say enough about how amazing this host was. Highly recommend this B&B!"
5078129,32189016,2015-05-15,31539545,Johanna,"We had a great time at Amys apartment. It is perfect for a family with small children. There were even toys & books for our little boy, which made him feel at home right away. Everything was very clean and as described. Thanks Amy also for sharing the very tasty carrot muffins with us! We'd love to stay with you again, if we come back to Seattle. "
5078129,32838631,2015-05-22,27493611,Haruna,"Highly recommended. Amy is friendly and helpful. 
We were traveling with our 3 years old girl and 11 months boy, and the place is suitable for family and kids. They arranged some toys and a portable crib for our children while we were staying there. Moreover, it is very close to the zoo and the big playground around a beautiful lake.
The suite is comfortable, clean, well equipped and convenient. We can easily access to the downtown, Seattle center and freeway."
5078129,33084491,2015-05-25,3345309,Lindsey,"Amy and her family are wonderful! The little suite/apartment is exactly what you see online and was a wonderful, cozy base for our adventures. It's well-stocked (toiletries in the shower, tons of linens, pillows, blankets, extra tooth brushes, cooking supplies, etc.) and has tons of DVDs for a relaxing night in. Amy left us a bottle of wine and a bar of chocolate on check-in, which was such a sweet touch! The neighborhood is great and their house is an easy walk to beautiful Green Lake, or into the Wallingford neighborhood, which has some great cafes and restaurants. I would highly recommend this place and would gladly stay here again! "
5078129,33389147,2015-05-27,30303776,Claudia,It was a wonderful time. Everything was very clean and just the way we expected. Amy is an excellent host. Thanks Amy!
5078129,34204949,2015-06-06,31004585,Barbara,"My family and I stayed with Amy the first week of June and had a wonderful visit in the Wallingford/Green Lake communities of Seattle.  The accommodations and amenities were just as expected and the kitchen in our space was perfect morning breakfast.  We loved being able to walk to Green Lake and access the walking trail around the lake and the Himalayan restaurant nearby was excellent.  Will definitely be back in September if space is available.  Thanks so much, Amy!"
5078129,34739339,2015-06-11,225872,Susan,"Quiet, comfortable, and well-situated, this apartment was unusual for the small thoughtful touches: special treats for both adults and kids (toys, bottle of wine, etc). Amy and her family were so welcoming and charming, we were sorry to leave!"
5078129,34839611,2015-06-12,26240920,Jason,Great place to stay! Caters to family. Lovely experience.

The location and setting is perfect for a small group of friends to have fun inside and explore Seattle as well. Being able to walk to green lake in 10 mins is an absolute bonus. The place was very clean and well equipped for everyone. My friends couldn't stop praising it, definitely recommend staying here!"
5078129,37038342,2015-07-04,29276158,Nicola,"We had a fantastic stay here ! It was the perfect location to explore Seattle , we got the bus in one day and walked in the other . Ideal for families as there is a lot of space and beds for children . The hosts were wonderful , very helpful and left us wine /chocolate / candy for the children on our arrival , which was much appreciated ! "
5078129,38370401,2015-07-15,28372607,Jennifer,Amy was a wonderful host - extremely organized and thoughtful with her space. The house itself is a perfect location to experience different aspects of the Seattle area. 
5078129,39150305,2015-07-21,6703902,Christy,"We stayed in this great apartment with our 2 children. The location is very convenient, just a few minutes to fabulous Green Lake and the Wallingford neighborhood which has many restaurants and shops. The apartment was very tidy. The bed was comfortable. The host was very helpful and prompt to reply to questions. We tried the Thai restaurant recommended by the host and it was very good. Thank you Amy."

There were lots of books for adults and kids.  Amy even left a few toys for our little ones.  They were a friendly family.   We were within walking distance to many restaurants, stores, and beautiful Green Lake Park.   "

5078129,42778540,2015-08-15,40836900,Melanie,We felt very welcome.  I felt more like I was visiting family rather than coming as a visitor.  The accommodations were very comfortable.   I occasionally had to compete for a parking spot when we arrived later in the day. 
5078129,43359021,2015-08-19,12121397,Kelly,"Amy was a terrific host. She left age-appropriate toys for my kids to play with and was very helpful.

Walking distance to the lake and a few restaurants. Also she was accommodating to let us stay a bit past check out with the kids with stomach bugs. My son left his teddy bear behind and Amy was so nice to mail it back to us. He was so happy to be reunited with his bear! 
"
5078129,47679414,2015-09-21,26793271,Nerissa,"Amy was great at communicating before our stay with questions about the place and during for advice on places we were planning to visit. The den was very clean and had everything we needed including a pack n play we had used for our 6 month old as well as toys that he could play with as well. The bed and futon were comfortable and the sofa bed was adequate. We definitely could hear footsteps from above, but since bedtime upstairs was 8p, we were able to get our little ones to bed at a decent time as well. Kitchen was stocked with coffee which was definitely needed. The Green Lake area was nice and great for runners and also convenient to the 5 and 99 freeways. And although parking was around the corner, it wasn't too much of a hassle. Overall we were very comfortable and enjoyed our stay. "
5078129,49872840,2015-10-07,28521534,Ashley,"Our first AirBnB experience and it couldn't have been better! Amy and Drew were wonderful hosts, and the suite was very welcoming and comfortable. Our family had a fantastic vacation and enjoyed having such a cozy space to relax at in between our adventures. The neighborhood is lovely, with so many great shops, restaurants, and attractions close by, and getting into the city was no problem at all. If you're looking for a spot that offers a chance to explore all Seattle has to offer, this is it!"
5078129,50599255,2015-10-12,3577243,Mary,"Our stay at Amy and Drew's house was wonderful!  The house is large, clean, and very well appointed.

5078129,56922926,2015-12-20,47338492,Lillian,"We had a great experience with Amy as our host! The listing description was all accurate and the location was within prime walking distance of everything that we needed. Communication with Amy was constant and we were able to arrange sleeping arrangements pre-arrival, which was super helpful as our train was delayed and we ended up coming in at 4 AM. Thank you for making our time in Seattle pleasant and comfortable!"
7828509,50385582,2015-10-11,45662883,Bevis,"The room I stayed in Matthew's place is cozy, comfortable and convenience! It's just several stops from the airport by taking the Link Light Rail and also several stops to Seattle city center. Very easy to get to and go around even though not staying in the city center. There are also two cats in the apartment. And I just can't stop my love to them cause they are way too cute! Bakery, atm and grocery store are available just 5 mins walking. Though I didn't see Matthew much, he's nice and care-taking during and before my arrival to ensure me having a smooth check-in and stay. So thanks for the accommodation, I had a great time in Seattle and will recommend others to stay there."

6655233,35255563,2015-06-16,9234534,Harshal,"I could barely interact with Shana because I used to be busy with work and then crash after I returned, but her room mate explained me everything when I moved in. It is a nice big house, the room is clean and comfortable as well. The neighborhood is brilliant, a 10 min walk to GreenLake, which is a happening place with lots of restaurants and bars. I enjoyed my brief stay, and would recommend others to stay with Shana. "
6655233,35706996,2015-06-21,12361167,Rebecca,"Shanas listing is just as described, we loved the breezy top floor bedroom in beautiful greenlake. There's a charming little desk, the bed is comfortable, and the neighborhood is quiet at night. There's also a cafe and nice pub a few blocks away, and the lake is walking distance.  Thanks for hosting us, Shana!"
6655233,35988923,2015-06-23,36224217,Richard,Great location. It was in a great neighborhood we bars close and only $12 Uber ride to the city.  We had a great stay. 
6655233,36432909,2015-06-28,35217855,Andrea,"The bed in the teal room was very comfortable. Shana was friendly and also respectful of privacy. The location was very very convenient for the University of Washington.
I had a relaxing and enjoyable stay."
6655233,37998556,2015-07-12,31975967,Peter,"A lovely home in a great location near lots of things in Tangletown and on 65th Street - Shana is a terrific host as well.  It was a hot week but the room stayed cool, which was really appreciated.  Very good for my week-long stay in Seattle."
6655233,38675634,2015-07-17,34943179,Matt,"I really enjoyed my stay in the Teal Room. Great house in a great location.

6655233,39069782,2015-07-20,37173418,Charles,"The room was amazing! I didn't have a chance to meet Sheena, however her boyfriend was very personable and welcoming. The room was amazing and I had easy access to the apartment. It was definitely an airy place and the smell of the fresh air every morning made the Seattle experience so much better. "
6655233,39646203,2015-07-25,484966,Eliana,"Great room in a cute neighborhood.  Shana, was great when I needed help or had questions.  Next time I come to Seattle, would definitely stay again. "
6655233,39830124,2015-07-26,38033199,David,"Though I never got a chance to interact with Shana personally the Teal room was great. Very clean and neat sunroof to watch the rain fall over. Getting around Seattle from the listing was really easy and there's plenty of parking in the neighborhood.

6655233,43973286,2015-08-23,27956230,Luciane,"Shana was out of town visiting family, but Jesse was very welcoming and kind to me and my sister for our short stay! He made sure to let us know to feel welcome, and we loved spending some time with their beautiful cat! 
The room itself was spacious and clean and the beds were very comfortable. We had some trouble with the windows, but it didn't bother us very much.
My sister, who has chronic pain, had some trouble with the stairs, but only slightly more than usual. The neighborhood and general area is very nice. We walked ten minutes and found a coffee shop to have breakfast before catching the bus downtown. Overall, I wish I could've stayed longer and would definitely recommend this place!"
6655233,45132921,2015-08-31,20091932,Cobin,Great place to stay! Thanks Shana!

6475289,36470588,2015-06-28,12166052,Mary Ann,"This place was stunning! Stayed here for a weekend and loved it. Everything from the inside of the house to their backyard deck was amazing. Fully equipped with all the supplies/utensils we needed to enjoy our cooking. Craig was a great host and reassured us that if we needed anything, we could easily reach him. The wine bottle we were greeted with was a great touch, too. "
6475289,36835216,2015-07-01,22392513,Frith,Gorgeous place overlooking Lake Washington. Beautifully renovated. Close to Seattle but far enough away to be relaxing. A short walk down through the bush to the lake. Nice and cool in the heat of summer. Hosts very accommodating. We recommend this spot!
6475289,37019834,2015-07-03,16961575,Dave,"We had an incredible experience staying at John and Craig's beautiful ome. They responded to my query immediately and were direct and very efficient in getting the booking completed upon short notice. A real life-saver. 
The lodgings are absolutely incredible. Recently renovated, with modern finishes -- comfortable, spacious and private. We enjoyed the bottle of wine that they left waiting for us while taking in the sunset on the deck overlooking Lake Washington and Mount Rainier. 
If you're looking for an amazing place to stay in Seattle, in a beautiful neighborhood, with gracious and friendly hosts -- this is it. Thanks Craig and John!"
6475289,37252888,2015-07-05,37070871,Jo Ann,"Craig and John went above and beyond.  The space was everything as described and more.  What a beautiful view!  I particularly enjoyed the deck for coffee in the mornings and wine in the evenings.  The flowers outside were so pretty I had to touch one to see if it was real.  The flat was impeccable in every way, including an electric fireplace for mood lighting.  Even though Seattle is experiencing an unseasonably warm summer, this flat is protected well enough that it was always comfortable.  Oh, and the place smelled incredibly good.  What absolute perfect hosts you are!  Thank you for opening your home to us."
6475289,38629395,2015-07-17,36463842,John,"This property was just as shown on the Airbnb site.  The apartment was totally updated, sparkling clean, and super comfortable.  The rooms are of good size.  The bedroom had lots of closet space and a nice chest of draws.  The bed had a very nice mattress and the sheets were crisp and clean.  The living room was bright and airy with a good size TV and comfortable furniture.  The kitchen is all updated with full size appliances and all the utensils you will ever need.  The deck is amazing and the view of Lake Washington spectacular.  You can't find a better place to relax with a glass of  wine at the end of the day then this deck.  Oh yes, the WiFi was great!
We were here for 12 days and the owners gave us our privacy but at the same time were very attentive.  They are avid gardeners and often we had fresh flower arrangments delivered to us.  When we saw the owners they would always ask us if we needed anything or if there was anything they could do for us.  They were very good hosts.
It is easy to get to downtown from this place.  We rented a car while in Seattle and took it downtown the first day.  After paying $24 for parking, at the suggestion of our hosts, we tried the bus.  It was super easy and nearly as fast.  We never took the car again.  With the downloaded app. you know the route and the time of pickup at each stop.
This apt is about 3 or4 blocks above Lake Washington Blvd.  In the mornings I would walk down and jog the blvd. then climb up and I mean up some stairs and go through Leschi Park to get back to the apt.  It was a great workout and a beautiful route.
All in all you will love this place.  My only worry is that it will become so popular I won't be able to book it the next time I'm in Seattle."
6475289,39060853,2015-07-20,36993349,Patrick,"Very welcoming hosts
Accurate listing "
6475289,39427591,2015-07-23,37743270,Christine,Wow - this was our first experience with Airbnb and it set the bar VERY high.  The experience was smooth from the beginning.  Our hosts were organized and sent us out detailed information before our trip which was very helpful.  The location was gorgeous and the unit we stayed in was impeccable and decorated beautifully.  The owners had thought of everything we might want or need to make our stay pleasant and fun.  They also checked in continuously to see if we needed or wanted anything additional.  Our experience could not have been better and we will return to visit this amazing place again!   HIGHLY recommend this for a wonderful vacation in Seattle.
6475289,39792349,2015-07-26,36128577,Raymond,"This was my first ever Airbnb experience and after staying at Craig and Johns place I will definitely use the service again.  

Craig was professional, polite and easily accessible if there was any questions or concerns that I had.  This was really important since we had a few delays at the airport and a change of schedule getting to the rental at the orignal planned time.  Craig was very accomodating and patient to this change.

The pictures of the place dont do justice.  The views are really nice...even with our not so good weather.  Its the type of view where you want to wake up in the morning and just lounge out on the deck with your cup of joe and gaze out for a bit.  

Inside the place was very clean and welcoming.  There was a lot of ammenities that were easily accessible and even when we needed something that wasnt available Craig was able to help with where we could find it.  

The area was nice and quiet during our stay and at night my friends and I chilled out on the deck looking out at the view and having a few drinks

All in all Im so glad that i was abke to have this rental as my first Airbnb experience and when Im in Seattle again I will definitely look up this place again!

Thanks Craig and John for hosting us!"
6475289,40358825,2015-07-30,10608481,Kayla,"We had a wonderful stay at Craig and John's! As a family of four it was such a nice quiet retreat from the hustle of downtown. There was plenty of space for all four of us to fit comfortably and was complete with everything that you might need while staying there. The space itself is in the lower level of the host's home, but it felt very private with a nice sized deck to enjoy the view of Lake Washington, which is such a gorgeous site at all hours. I was worried it might feel a bit like a basement, but that wasn't the case at all. There were  loads of windows and it felt very light, airy and clean. We explored the trails right next door and were so happy that we did, it leads down to the lake. We would happily stay here again, can't recommend it enough!"
6475289,41383110,2015-08-07,35926352,Sho,"The property is absolutely beautiful overseeing Lake Washington and the owners were very courteous and polite. location is close enough to downtown, yet far enough to enjoy the quiet neighborhood of Seattle. "
6475289,41968724,2015-08-10,36470938,Dee,"This was the first experience with Airbnb for me and my two teenagers, and it was fabulous.  Craig met us when we arrived and was very helpful with suggestions for restaurants and for tips on navigating the local bus system.  We parked the car and used the bus for our entire trip.  The unit was furnished beautifully, with everything we could possibly need.  The view from the deck is breathtaking.  We were fortunate to have clear weather and a view of Mount Rainier for a couple of days.  The gardens are gorgeous, and we loved the fresh flowers placed throughout the unit.  Highly recommended!"
6475289,42407407,2015-08-13,20692352,Donna,"My husband and I loved this place!  Craig and John have done a wonderful job updating/decorating the space.  Spotlessly clean and modern and very comfortable bedding (a big plus for me :)).  But the best part is the view from the deck - wow!  

The location in the quiet neighborhood is wonderful and very convenient to going downtown to the Pike Place Market/Ballparks etc.  

Hosts allowed us our privacy, but were quick to answer any questions that we had.  

Highly recommend this rental."
6475289,44535020,2015-08-27,32490298,Jenine,"As I write this, I am sitting on the deck with the sun coming up over Lake Washington and Mt Rainier in full view.   Not a bad way to start the day.  

John and Craig were excellent hosts!   The apartment, view, etc exceeded our expectations.   We have been here for two weeks and are very sad to be leaving this wonderful neighborhood.   The apartment was spotless and had all of the amenities we needed.  The bed was comfy and bathroom was fully stocked with all we needed for our stay.  

We took the bus several times to our offices downtown, which was a block away and took 15 minutes.  Extremely easy.   We also rented a car for the weekends and easily found parking next to the house with no issue at all.    The ability to walk to the Leschi Market, Daniels Broiler and other restaurants was so convenient and a great way to enjoy the beautiful weather.   

Lastly, we loved the deck and sitting out having coffee in the morning and wine in the evening, enjoying the amazing view.  Thanks so much Craig and John for a great two weeks!"
6475289,45121993,2015-08-31,39714356,Sean,"The place was amazing. Great view, nice deck, well furnished. Only ran into Craig once and he was very accommodating. Couldn't recommend it more!"
6475289,45793364,2015-09-06,38040965,Lisa,"We stayed in Craig & John’s flat for the weekend when visiting Seattle for a family wedding. Being so busy preparing for the weekend, it took a weight off that the owners are so thorough. They proactively provided all the information to coordinate check in, stay instructions, and were even kind enough to let us know (without me asking) that the home would be available for an early check in that day. 
For my husband and I, having an enjoyable trip away from home, heavily relies on the accommodations cleanliness, privacy, and whether we have a comfortable night’s sleep. Upon arrival we found the modern one bedroom to be immaculate, appearing and smelling very clean. Fresh flowers from the garden placed inside made for a warm welcome as did a nice bottle of wine.  
Privacy being so high on our list, I contemplated how this rental would feel with the owners upstairs. I’m happy to say we found the Craig and John (who were home that weekend) were very respectful and my concerns were a non-issue; we felt like we had the entire property to ourselves the entire time.
I would describe Craig and John as discretely attentive. The spaces are also divided and configured nicely, allowing occupants their own private view, deck and entrance. When seeing the view in the evening, I commented to my husband that the online pictures just do not do it justice! The glow of the city across Lake Washington was stunning. We slept sound as the bed was very comfortable, made with quality linens that were soft and smelled clean (again with the clean...I know).
Accounting for every detail, and going beyond what most accommodations offer definitely stands out to us with this home. The thoughtful extras such as the wine, fresh cut flowers, Keurig coffee, lovely scented hand and body wash, left us feeling pampered and sets this home apart from others. I would absolutely recommend it and stay again. 
"
6475289,46207566,2015-09-08,52296,Josh,This is by far one of the best AirBNB experiences I've had. Craig and John are great hosts and their location is fantastic. It is just steps from the bus line to take you downtown and a short walk from great restaurants in Leschi. If you're looking for a great escape in Seattle but want to experience a more authentically local life this is a wonderful choice.
6475289,47159112,2015-09-16,13343079,Shanna,"The house and location are amazing.  We were lucky to have several good days so the view from the deck was beyond belief.  Not only that, the apartment itself is lovely with very nice touches.  There were four of us for a week and it was the perfect size for all of us.  When I come back to Seattle, I will definitely stay here again.  John and Craig were very kind and they were always available with questions and checked in on us regularly."
6475289,47815422,2015-09-21,30081579,Joshua,"Everything was as described, there was a personalized greeting card on the table welcoming us, and the house was immaculately clean. It was exactly what was described and the views were amazing. Very close to Pikes Market and central to pretty much everything you would want to do in Seattle. I have already recommended this place to all my friends. "
6475289,48202682,2015-09-24,28635497,Mak,"The neighborhood is a lovely residential with forests and parks for children close by. It is easy to find parking on the street.  The flat was recently renovated and very clean, with fresh flowers, a spacious bath and great views from the sitting room and bedroom. Kitchen was very well outfitted and a washer/dryer a plus."
6475289,48552753,2015-09-27,22796168,Kimberly,"
We felt welcome. The communication was excellent and the apartment was simply lovely with a stunning view.The garden was an added pleasure."
6475289,49392652,2015-10-03,8072678,Veronica,"What makes this better than a 5 star resort ? Everything ! The cute curb cottage feel in the front combined with a beautiful garden of various ground cover, wild flowers and really cool miniature lollipop pines( not the actual name) but they add to the charm of the home. The in law suite below was sleek, modern but still had that home feel. When you see the home , the garden , and the in law suite you know Craig and John have really put love , sweat, and hard work to make this place awesome. I've left the view till last as it's the highlight. The deck sits at a perfect angle to enjoy lake Washington and the city just in the distance. It starts off hazy in the morning hard to recognize any city in the distance as the hours go by this charming city comes into clear view. This home has the view and the location. Small speciality grocery stores , excellent restaurants and more.  "
6475289,49627565,2015-10-05,41820945,Sophie,It's my first time to use air b&b.  I am sure I will use it later.  The house is so nice.  The deck has such a beautiful view.  My family enjoyed it a lot.  
6475289,49934228,2015-10-07,19606189,Tammee,"Stay for the view and the incredible warmth and generosity of hosts Craig and John. We thoroughly enjoyed the beautiful view easily accessed from the bedroom and deck! Breathtaking. Upon arrival, Craig and John were extremely flexible on check-in time and gave me a personal tour of the place so that I knew how everything worked in the rental unit, which was greatly appreciated. The airbnb is walking distance from bus lines 14 and 8 which takes you downtown or to the Capitol Hill neighborhood easily. We were able to utilize convenient public transit during our entire stay. Great for a couple who might want to have a drink or two at home before a night or dinner out on the town. Margarita glasses and umbrellas included :)"
6475289,50077626,2015-10-09,28515492,Amelia,"The apartment was lovely and the view from the deck was amazing.  The Keurig coffeemaker in the kitchen and choice of coffees was a very nice touch.
Craig and John even went ""over and above"" by providing a wonderful cushiony mattress topper for the futon when I indicated that I was unsure about sleeping comfortably on it.  For the record - it was a great night's sleep."
6475289,50550024,2015-10-12,3138201,Sharon,"We had a great time at Craig & John's place. So comfortable & beautiful that it was hard to leave. The view was everything that had been described; it was a very memorable morning watching the sun come up over Rainier. This place was everything we were looking for: quiet neighborhood, easy access, private and very much like home. "
6475289,53044700,2015-11-04,26563549,Terri,"Craig & John are friendly, accommodating & gracious hosts. The apt is super comfortable, well-maintained, clean & super accessorized. The view overlooking Lake Washington is spectacular!  The neighborhood is quiet with easy access to all things Seattle. We definitely will be planning future visits to this cozy apartment!"
6475289,53398148,2015-11-08,39477108,Kylan,"Such a beautiful and clean place to stay. Craig and John are really friendly and are super accommodating! This unit has a beautiful view of the lake. Only a 10-15 minute ride to Pike Place. Easy parking on the streets as well. Would stay here again the next time I am in Seattle! :)

"
6475289,53828104,2015-11-13,5131002,Lauren,"Everything about our stay was wonderful! The apartment was clean, modern and as described. The view was stunning! We could have sat on the deck all day and night just looking at the mountains over the water. John and Craig were very easy to work with and even left us a lovely bottle of wine in the fridge. "
6475289,54201808,2015-11-16,43696528,Brionna,"Wow. What an incredible property! Completely renovated full living room, kitchen, bedroom and bathroom, plus a full patio with a gorgeous view of the water and downtown Bellevue (exactly like the pictures). Felt like a luxury hotel stay! The host greeted us upon arrival and provided a tour, as well as a welcome bottle of wine and handwritten note. There is also an informative packet about the property and tourist attraction pamphlets in the main space. I was very appreciate of the washer/dryer with detergent, and the umbrellas. Gorgeous garden and very clean space. I would return! Also, there's a cute local block with a market and brunch spots, and Leschi Park is nearby and cute to drive through. "
6475289,54386643,2015-11-19,206203,Amanda,John and Craig are wonderful hosts and cared greatly about my comfort. Their house is really lovely and the apartment looks even nicer than in the photos. It has great views of Lake Washington from the bedroom and the living area and a well-equipped kitchen. One does somewhat hear each other through the ceilng/floor but after meeting them I did not mind as it felt like a family situation. Otherwise it was very quiet and I slept well. Great place to stay! I highly recommend it.
6475289,55212648,2015-11-29,28753334,Catherine,"My parents stayed here for almost two weeks and they really enjoyed it.  Perfect amount of space, very nicely renovated, light and airy feeling, and great views.  They said the queen bed was super comfortable too.  Craig was a very gracious host, easy to interact with, and checked in on them frequently.  He was super helpful and quick to respond when any question arose.  I'm sure they would love to stay here again when they return to Seattle to visit."
6475289,56128666,2015-12-09,218696,Laura,"Super easy to work with Craig and John. The unit is all brand new, very spacious with a wonderful view. I would definitely stay here again"
6475289,56404591,2015-12-13,994491,Josh,"We loved staying at Craig & John's place! The unit was was very clean, modern and comfortable. There was a nice bottle of wine as well as coffee & cream for us to enjoy. The location was great with a beautiful view of the lake from the private patio out back. We would absolutely consider staying here again on future trips to Seattle!"

I will rebook here when I visit Seatel next time，trust me！"
4557204,24335622,2014-12-26,16882088,Katie Gray,"My closest girlfriends and I were looking for a house in the city to spend Christmas all together with our husbands--there were four couples total. When we found Beth's place we were sold! The price was right, the location was amazing, and the house was so lovely.

Beth was so great about communicating with me before the trip. She was also very reachable the day of when we had a teeny issue with the alarm system. She also left little instructional notes around the home which were very helpful.

This is definitely a vacation home for those inclined to cook! The kitchen is decked out with excellent knives, utensils, pots and pans, etc. It also has a lovely 6-burner gas stove and two stacked ovens. It was perfect for preparing large meals for the group. 

Our group also so enjoyed the in-home theater. The room is comfortable, the sound is wonderful, and the projector is perfect for the big screen experience.

Beth's home is truly a perfect vacation spot! It's a great mix of cozy and luxurious. 

"
4557204,28794263,2015-03-30,27558406,David,"Can't say enough good things about Beth and her wonderful home. She provided excellent communication leading up to the trip and left little notes all over the home with instructions for everything. Beth even left us some candy in the kitchen!

The pictures were very accurate showing the bedrooms and common area. The house was kept clean and provided more than enough space for my friends and I.

Location is near a bus route which worked out well. Uber/Lyft have a hard time locating the house, but it's not a big deal, as you can direct them to the gas station a minute away.

Would highly recommend Beth and her home to future guests and I would rent the house again too."
4557204,32960802,2015-05-24,26867692,Renee,"Beth was an amazing host and made our weekend away a warm and memorable experience. We were thrilled with the house and it exceeded our expectations based on the description in the listing. The beds were super comfy and the house was well kept and spacious. There were also warm notes posted throughout the house that provided tips on how to use appliances, etc. The location also amazing - great, quiet neighborhood with lots of greenery and coffee shops within walking distance. Capitol Hill and downtown Seattle were short drives away. Would recommend for future stays in Seattle. "
4557204,38829640,2015-07-19,12773339,Emily,"The house was beautiful, spacious and exceeded our expectations. Beth was a wonderful hostess.  Our group appreciated all the little details. Would recommend in a heart beat!"
4557204,40708677,2015-08-02,9878893,Anna,"This house couldn't possibly have been more perfect!  It is in a beautiful part of Seattle, close to a park and hidden away in a cul-de-sac.  Upon arrival we were greeted by the Blue Angels flying over (Seafair going on).  Beth was prompt in her replies and very helpful.  The space is gorgeous inside and out; we enjoyed sitting on the back patio enjoying the evening breeze and the lovely jar lanterns in the tree.  It is obvious that this house is lovingly kept, spacious and  beautiful.  Comfortable beds, well-equipped kitchen and a full assortment of entertainment, though we didn't take advantage of the home theater, being in town for our daughter/sister's wedding.  It was wonderful having our whole family in one place; made it easier to coordinate trips, shopping, and last minute wedding preparations.
We are definitely keeping this place in mind for future visits to Seattle!  "
4557204,55094142,2015-11-28,17085349,Karen,"Beth could not have been more helpful in preparing us for our trip to Seattle. I asked a lot of questions and she answered them all to my complete satisfaction. The house, in a wonderful neighborhood, was the perfect place for our family to gather over the Thanksgiving week. It was easy to make ourselves feel at home with its comfortable furnishings, a kitchen with every utensil you'd ever need, a great theater, a lovely backyard and perfect proximity to beautiful Arboretum Park. We've been to Seattle many times as our kids live there, but have always stayed in a hotel. After this wondeful experience, a hotel room will never live up to this special place. This was my first experience with Airbnb and the bar has been set high by Beth! "
6327662,41807207,2015-08-09,38158998,Michael,"This is just as it is described, a very cute little bungalow. Tori was the best host anyone could ask for. We were greeted to our surprise with fresh scones and coffee, as well as milk for the coffee. The space was perfect for our time in Seattle. The bed was comfortable and there was plenty of room for our air mattress, it was well lit and had good air flow once you got the windows opened up. I absolutely loved my stay at Tori's place. I said to her while I was leaving ""that if Airbnb is always like this, I don't ever want to stay in a hotel again,"" and I mean it. This was just a wonderful experience and I hope that all the rest of my stays are just as nice as this was! I have a feeling its going to be difficult to book this place next year. "
6327662,53805243,2015-11-13,4588548,Julie,"Loved our time at Tori's place. Perfect spot to see beautiful Seattle but then get away from the hustle and bustle. She was such a wonderful host, easy to get ahold of and great recommendations on where to go. Would highly recommend her spot! "
5277900,30305311,2015-04-20,29071669,Arianna,"Liz's Airbnb is a MUST STAY if you are visiting the Seattle area. The place has amazing views, is clean, and welcoming for any visitor! The location was prime, it was far enough away from downtown to not hear the city noise, but was close enough that you could take public transit to any part of the city. There is a beautiful balcony that looks out onto the water where it was perfect for catching some Seattle sun (yes it does happen!). I would also highly recommend this Airbnb to travelers with children as well! Very kid (and kid at heart) friendly! Definitely stay here, you won't regret it! "
5277900,33236148,2015-05-26,11758948,Jamai,"The pictures didn't do Liz's place justice. It was one of the best places I have ever had the pleasure of staying in. The place was clean and had an older charm (that I love) with modern furniture.  When I needed the code for the TV, Liz was very responsive. She also left a guide and list of restaurants and coffee shops in the neighborhood. We did rent a car as downtown isn't walking distance, but there was plenty of parking.  There are quite a few stairs, but it helped me with my fitbit steps. I would definitely recommend Liz's place and have it on my list of places in Seattle to stay."
5277900,35637563,2015-06-21,1829206,Gary,"Thank you Liz for making us feel welcome, we found a perfect place in Seattle. "
5277900,36170172,2015-06-26,29048705,Carmen,"Liz was a great host with great communication. The house is lovely, clean and has a lot of charm inside and out!!! We loved the view, how close it was to everything and we didn't have any trouble finding street parking at all. Consider this house I f you're looking for a quiet neighborhood that is close to downtown Seattle. "
5277900,37146348,2015-07-05,7309198,Joanna,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay, including the delicious chocolates  Liz left, the clean, comfortable home which was just as described, the stunning views of Bellevue, and Lake Washington, a quick walk down the hill.  Thank you for helping to make our Seattle vacation so enjoyable!"
5277900,37644644,2015-07-09,744657,Yorgos,"The house we found was exactly as described, even though the killer views over Lake Washington and the skyline of downtown Bellevue are really beyond describing. Unfortunately we did not meet Liz, but communication with her was very good (even when we asked questions that were already addressed in the 'house manual' (doh!). Location is perfect, both for exploring the city and its wider environment. Parking was never a problem and getting to the freeway easy. "
5277900,38107386,2015-07-13,30443831,Burt,"The house was really great.  This was our first time renting through Airbnb and we could not have had a better experience.   There was a beautiful view from the second story deck, everything was clean and comfortable.   The neighborhood was quiet and no more than 10 to 15 minutes to anywhere we went in downtown Seattle by car.  Bus lines stopped just a short walk away.  We would have spent a lot more money if we had stayed in a hotel.

Our host was great, she kept us informed and made the whole process very easy.  If we come back to Seattle we will definitely look to stay at the same location.  Thanks for making our visit to Seattle that much more enjoyable."
5277900,43048769,2015-08-17,35168288,Karen,"Lovely home that certainly shows pride of ownership!  Open, airy, and nicely furnished.  Central location, in quiet neighborhood with beautiful view of Lake Washington and Bellevue across the lake.  My first booking with Airbnb and Liz certainly made the process easy.  Would definitely stay here again if my travels bring me back to Seattle. "
5277900,46151123,2015-09-08,28278044,Dragan,"Extremely easy to get to the house from the airport. When we arrived the house was perfectly clean, very spacious with a beautiful  of the lake.  A bottle of wine and chocolates greeted us. Parking is on the street and driving time is 10 minutes to down town or about 45 minutes walking.  Very easy to get to down town since the streets are numbered from 30 th to 1.  The house was exactly as described and I would stay here again if I had a chance."
4869458,29075384,2015-04-03,3910662,Prem,"Haotin was very welcoming and accommodating. He even gave me a welcome packet complete with needs to know around town and a Starbucks gift card. The listing was better than described. The neighborhood had a neat little community garden, a beaver creek and a super mall that had everything."
4869458,29866530,2015-04-13,29952162,Jeff,"The host is great. He made me feel at home right away.  The location is very convinient, less than 10 minutes walk to Northgate Transit Center, where there are buses going to all areas in Seattle/Bellevue area. There is mall, restaurant with in walking distance.  I ended up didn't need a car the whole time I was there.  The host and I I ran a couple of times to show me various parts of the town, which was very nice.  I would definitely stay again."
4869458,30261902,2015-04-19,31218225,Katy,"It was a very nice stay. The house is beautiful, I found lovely, fluffy blankets on the couch for me to use and stayed nice and warm at night and the bathroom is nice and spacious. I never got to meet Haotian because of conflicting work schedules, but we texted many times and he was very nice and hospitable and even left laundry soap for me to use when I had inquired about the washer and dryer. I am very happy with the experience I had and highly recommend this place to others. 

Also, the location is great if you're either traveling on foot or by car! Northgate Transit Center is just a couple of blocks away and you can get anywhere in the city from there. There's a beautiful hiking trail that goes along Piper's Creek on the same block as the house also, I definitely recommend walking that on one of these beautiful days we've been having lately. "
4869458,31487324,2015-05-05,32051317,Guangye,Haotian is an amazingly nice guy. The couch is amazingly comfortable! It's an amazing experience.
4869458,32001119,2015-05-12,32235450,Haobo,It is a very nice place to live. The host is pretty friendly and helpful during the stay. The location is suitable for a visitor. I would recommend you to stay here if you ask me.
4869458,36278686,2015-06-27,29832066,Shenghan,Very comfortable place. Haotian is so helpful and outgoing. I even become friends with Haotian's friends.
4869458,37730281,2015-07-10,28093305,Tehya,Haotian was a perfect host.  He went as far as installing a new ceiling fan for me during the heat wave that we had the two weeks I was in Seattle.  I loved the location and the hospitality that he and his family extended to me.  I will be back next summer for sure!
4869458,41491932,2015-08-07,31797842,Derek,Haotian was a friendly host. He provided me a lot useful information about Seattle. The house was easy to fined and very cleaning and neat. 
4869458,41845221,2015-08-09,39044209,Khoop,"I stayed at Haotain's place for 2 nights. The place locates in decent neighborhood. Easily transport from/to the airport by light rail and bus no. 41. Near the shopping mall, coffee shops, and restaurants. I was provided the passcode for the door prior to the arrival date, which is very convenient when the owner is away. I'm supposed to sleep on the couch but got upgraded to the bed in one of his bedrooms. The place has everything you need - Wifi, kitchen, cable TV. Overall, this place is convenient and affordable."
4869458,43290428,2015-08-18,24500436,Yichao,"Great host, clean and comfy couch, close to transit. I'd definitely recommend it to others."
4869458,49493831,2015-10-04,16186162,Daniel,Very quiet and great for the price and great location with many things to do in the area
4869458,53550667,2015-11-09,377584,Cheri,"Haotian was a wonderful host during my visit to Seattle. He was very responsive to my messages upon my arrival and was attentive to my needs, providing a bath towel and clothing iron upon request. He was generous, too, in allowing me to park my car in one of his driveway. He provided me a complimentary upgrade from his couch to the entire bottom floor (including a full kitchen) of his home for me to use. Though the place was quite cold on arrival, the heating system worked perfectly and provided a warm, comfortable place to sleep at night."
4869458,56325976,2015-12-12,49785915,Joshua,I felt very welcomed and had nothing but positive interactions. The couch was indeed large and comfortable. I would have no hesitation staying with Haotian the next time I am in Seattle. 
3206305,14142202,2014-06-12,5245185,Chris,"Dana and Jack responded very quickly to my request on what amounted to be a very busy day in the Seattle area for Airbnb and traditional hotels. They were flexible and provided me with multiple options for picking up the keys on what was a hectic day for me during a short 24-hour visit. When I met them at the house, they couldn't have been nicer - and the words 'as advertised' don't begin to appropriately sum up the experience! It truly is a garden oasis, and you get an incredible view whether lounging outside on one of the many pieces of comfortable outdoor furniture or inside looking out large windows at the picturesque environment. 

The apartment itself had everything you could possible need. I loved the organic soaps, ample supply of bath towels, and even some freshly ground coffee for the extra touch. The living room had more kinds of entertainment than I ever could have hoped to use in the few short hours I spent here - but I will definitely be hoping for availability on my next trip when I may get to spend more time in this relaxing environment.

Location-wise, you are secluded from the city center, but even during rush hour in the evening and morning it took only about 20 minutes to get door-to-door with my office downtown. Also, a 10-minute car ride will get you to beautiful Alki Beach, where I trekked for an evening walk along the sound at sunset.

Even the wifi is strong enough that you cna take your laptop out to the patio, if you must email, and do so in peace and solitude.

Really enjoyed this stay (and bonus for me that I'm told I was their first guest!) - they knocked it out of the park with this place! Would stay again for sure."
3206305,14216329,2014-06-14,2773866,Rene,My interaction with Dana and Jack was brief but lovely. They seem to be great people that are running a fantastic little airbnb suite in their back yard. The suite was immaculate and the bed was very comfortable. The space is peaceful and tranquil. You'd never know that it's within a city....I had a fantastic sleep there. 
3206305,14754807,2014-06-25,11278755,Justin,"Great (and very safe) accommodations! This place was wonderful. Living Room, Kitchen, Bath and Bedroom. All the comforts of home! If I would have known all of the items that would have been available to us I would have packed less. Seriously. Gas stove, full sized fridge, hair dryer, shampoo, conditioner, towels, shaving gel, wow! This place was like staying at my house on vacation.

Jack and Dana were fabulous! They gave us great restaurant recommendations and were super friendly. We even hung out with them by the fire one night. It was fun guys!

Among my favorite restaurants were Pearls Tea and Coffee (great coffee and quick breakfast), Bakery Nouveau (go here, we did, 2 or 3 times), Elliot Bay Brewery and Pub (awesome beer and burgers), Bar del Corso (amazing pizza and desert), and The Walrus and the Carpenter (holy wow yum tasting menu, a must visit, we went with our 7 month old and she did great!).

This location is also great. It feels like you're out of the city completely, but downtown and restaurants are super close. Very nice."
3206305,14894766,2014-06-28,5672047,Dipul,"Unfortunately, I didn't get to meet Dana, Jack or Nolan, but the communication was fantastic and they had everything ready for me.  This place was exactly what it should be, quiet, tranquil but close enough to the city to enjoy it. 

I would definitely stay here again if I'm ever in the area!
"
3206305,14994906,2014-06-30,428327,Jennifer,"Our stay with Dana, Jack, and Nolan was great!  The space was lovely and clean, with a very comfortable bed and nice bedding, and they have an amazing back yard.  Everything we needed for morning coffee was provided, and there were nice toiletries stocked.

Communication was excellent -- they were very friendly and responsive.  If we find ourselves in need of a place to stay in West Seattle, we will not hesitate to book again.  Overall, it was a really good experience.  Thanks!"
3206305,15341347,2014-07-07,2212105,Maelle,"We couldn't have asked for better hosts! Dana and Jack were always helpful and friendly and even let us borrow their BBQ! We loved our stay in our cosy granny flat, the listing was exactly as described. The house was in a fairly good location, pretty close to two bus stops that get you into the city in about 10-15 mins. The public transport in Seattle was fairly difficult for us to navigate so next time we'd rent a car. Overall, we loved staying with Jack and Dana. We'll definitely be back if we head to Seattle again."
3206305,15594470,2014-07-12,16107920,Jiangtao,我们在这里度过了愉快的假日，房间很独立，有自己的私人空间，非常干净和舒适，厨房和卫生间用品一应俱全，小花园很漂亮。他们非常好客，热情地为我们介绍西雅图的景点和美食，我们相处得很愉快，很高兴遇见他们。
3206305,15776931,2014-07-15,17016674,Shayla,"Garden Oasis is truly what this place is! My parents came to Seattle for a visit and this was right down the street from my apartment. Couldn't have asked for a better location. Short bus ride to the downtown area and two main bus lines run one block from here. Such a beautiful garden/patio area with great hosts! Such friendly and nice people. The apartment was very clean, comfortable and had everything just perfect. Defiantly would recommend staying here!"
3206305,16137285,2014-07-22,17468586,Andy,"We planned to check in early, Dana and Jack did their outermost to make it possible. We came much later (after midnight) that we planned, but they are still very friendly in their responses. All information are clear, so we could find the key quickly.

As we stay only for one night, we did not see and experience much at the apartment. But I was glad, we made this reservation."
3206305,16479020,2014-07-28,17015556,Lisa,"Dana and Jack were very welcoming and helpful.  They were always quick to respond to questions and to offer suggestions when asked.  They even brought a plate of fresh cherries to the room when we arrived! Their place was very clean and well-equipped. The ""Garden Oasis"" was accurately described-- I wish I had more time to spend just hanging out in the gardens!
I would highly recommend Dana and Jack's place to any one visiting the area.  West Seattle is very accessible with interesting shops and restaurants. Going into downtown Seattle is not bad, but if traveling during rush hour, allow a bit more time.  I would definitely return to the Greenbelt Garden Oasis!"
3206305,17055634,2014-08-06,15529024,Erin,"I feel like we hit the jackpot with our first airbnb experience! Dana, Jack and Nolan were very welcoming and made us feel right at home, I don't think we'll ever use a hotel again. Greenbelt Garden Oasis was just that, it felt secluded from the city but was still a perfect location for us. They responded quickly and were always available to any questions. It was a quick drive to many of the destinations we  planned in and around Seattle. Our family of three had plenty of space and more amenities then we could fit in to our stay. Our hosts gave us many suggestions of local food, beer and activities. Not only were  the accommodations awesome but so were the host, it was nice to get a chance to talk with Dana and Jack and spend a few evenings enjoying the garden and even a fire in their outdoor fire place. The kitchen is fully equipped with just about every utensil you would need to make a dinner.  Overall, it was an awesome experience; we hope a return trip to Seattle will include a stay Greenbelt Garden Oasis!"
3206305,17138660,2014-08-07,16105531,Laura,"Wow!  A beautiful garden and lovely hosts.  They accommodated our special needs and were very patient with my lack of technology skills throughout the process. 
Jack and Dana made themselves available for questions when we arrived and the apartment was full of games/books/dvds for entertainment.  We were on a quick trip so there was no time to take advantage of all they had to offer.  
This is a special place made extra special with attention to detail and kindness."
3206305,17165622,2014-08-08,12854191,Shauna,"Our stay at Dana and Jack's place was fantastic. Our visit was brief but was comfortable, easy to coordinate and largely enjoyable. The garden is beautiful; full of fresh herbs and veges, the cats are super friendly and the apartment itself is clean and spacious. We only met Dana briefly but she was lovely and easy to communicate with the whole time. I'd definitely recommend a stay at Dana and Jack's."
3206305,18310976,2014-08-25,15885543,Drew,"We had a fantastic time staying at this spot.  The hosts made us feel right at home immediately and it was exactly as described.  From the gorgeous large back yard to the great location that is minutes drive from great restaurants, alki beach and a nice park.  Highly recommend this location."
3206305,18548005,2014-08-28,16676123,John,"We were over the moon with the location and the property was just as descried on the web site. Dana and Jack were really nice and friendly and provided us with lots of local knowledge on where to visit and the best places to eat.

We had a great stay, and can highly recommend this location  "
3206305,18887125,2014-09-02,18257827,Miranda,"In our travels we have experienced many different types of accommodations, and our stay in West Seattle with Dana and Jack truly stands out as one of the most enjoyable and relaxing.  The Airbnb description was accurate, the place was everything we expected it to be and much more.  Dana was a perfect host; very accommodating, extremely responsive, thoughtful and generous, but she also gave us ample privacy.  The backyard was lovely and picturesque. We stayed on Labor Day and the garden was full of basil, tomatoes, peppers, beans, cucumbers, strawberries and many beautiful flowers.  It felt very secluded from the road and we appreciated starting our days with breakfast at various spots throughout the garden, which is directly outside the apartment door.  The apartment itself had everything we wanted.  It was quiet and VERY clean , we both slept great and did not want for anything.  The location also provides easy access to downtown Seattle with a car and, although we never quite got around to it, there are buses nearby.  We found grocery shopping and dining options to be a short drive away (and Dana offers many great suggestions for various spots to try).  Although we did not have much chance to meet Jack, Dana was fascinating and truly a kind and wonderful person.  Needless to say, I highly recommend this spot.  "
3206305,19130385,2014-09-07,1279372,Surinder,"Wonderful hosts. We had a great stay. The house was perfect - had everything we needed, was clean, quiet and nicely laid out. The garden was amazing too. Thanks so much for a great intro to Seattle. Also loved the West Seattle neighborhood."
3206305,19302852,2014-09-09,6342868,Ambar,We really enjoyed our stay with Jack and Dana. At first we weren't sure what to expect seeing as how this was our first time using air BandB but they made us feel comfortable throughout our stay. The apartment beautifully decorated. The kitchen had all the cooking utensils you may need.  The garden was  my favorite. It's a beautiful setting to eat breakfast or finish off your day with a glass of wine. She also left a list of restaurant and bar recommendations which was very useful. They also made themselves available as needed. Another important factor for us was that it was just a short drive to downtown Seattle. I would definitely recommend this for anyone looking to stay in Seattle without staying in the hectic downtown area. 
3206305,19497394,2014-09-13,21016960,Steven,We were warmly greeted by our hosts.  They were very gracious and welcoming.  The proximity to the city was amazing.  Three minutes over the West Seattle bridge and we were downtown.  The stadiums were right there as well.  We couldn't have been happier.
3206305,19633333,2014-09-15,20739497,Vincent,"Wow! we had a great time a Dana and Jack place! Everything was as described.  We enjoyed having a nice evening in the garden (Charcoal BBQ, Fire , music!).   Good communication , fast answers,  and super friendly.  We will recommend to our friends... Merci!"
3206305,19977426,2014-09-21,1784121,Arnold,"It really is an Oasis, and Dana, Jack and Nolan (when around), made us feel part of the family, while leaving our privacy. Close to everything in Seattle (if you dont mind 5-20 minute drives), this serene place is perfect to just stay in the whole day and enjoy the quiet surroundings and beautifully kept garden. It was one of the highlight stays of our trip, not least due to the hosts. Would definitely come back!"
3206305,20094008,2014-09-23,19647677,Zack,Our experiance was amazing we booked this place for the night of our wedding it was great! They even spread rose pedals down the stairs for me upon request it was clean had fresh towels and everything would highly recommend this place! !
3206305,20470738,2014-09-29,591900,Rosanne,Absolutely wonderful experience. The space and the hosts could not have been better. It is airbnb experiences like this that make it so great. Thanks Dana and Jack!
3206305,20740216,2014-10-05,17016674,Shayla,This is the 2nd time I've booked Dana and Jacks apartment. It's great! Couldn't ask for a better experience or people have as a host. I will be using this place again in the future! The garden is so beautiful all year round.
3206305,21728718,2014-10-22,7651051,Alexandra,"We loved our stay in Dana, Jack and Nolan's apartment! The place was very cozy and their garden oasis is lovely. They left fresh ground coffee, tea, creamer, shampoo, etc. for us, and Dana was very responsive and easy to reach. We would definitely stay here again!"
3206305,22663501,2014-11-11,11773168,Tina,"The apartment is wonderful. Three of us stayed there for a girls weekend in Seattle. Make sure you take Uber or have a rental car of some sort. We had beautiful weather so we could walk, but I think if you were there during rain you would probably not want to walk to the bus. 

Dana and her family were absolutely wonderful! Highly recommend "
3206305,23370353,2014-11-30,441009,Heather,"We had a great stay at Dana and Jack's guesthouse. Super comfortable and well-appointed, and we were able to easily do some of our Thanksgiving prep in the kitchen. "
3206305,24561950,2014-12-30,11075003,Kerrie,"We had a wonderful stay. Everything was clean and comfortable. We hope to stay with Dana, Jack, and Nolan again next time we go to Seattle."
3206305,25558961,2015-01-19,11637799,Juliane,"This was the perfect place - plenty of room, nice and private, and well-equipped with all the ammenities needed (kitchen, bath, tv, cable, games!). I felt very welcome and had all the information I needed on arrival - as well as a nice packet left by my hosts on the area (restaurants and stores). The apartment was quiet and clean, and I would stay here again in a second :)"
3206305,26665392,2015-02-16,5063079,Mark,Wonderful rental! Absolutely everything we were needed and hoped for. Great location. Clean. Very helpful and warm hosts that made our stay a complete pleasure. Will definitely look to stay here again. 
3206305,27039643,2015-02-23,15312155,Shea,"This was a great stay.  Dana was prompt in responding and made some great recommendations for dining/places to visit in the area.  The apt itself was everything I could have asked for. A very cool space, clean, and a good location.  The garden and backyard were especially unique.  My only regret is I wish I could have stayed longer!"
3206305,27671254,2015-03-09,428327,Jennifer,"This was our second stay with Dana, Jack, and Nolan.  It was great!  The apartment is well furnished, with a full kitchen and very comfortable bed, and there is a beautiful back yard.  Checking in and out was a breeze, and they are always very responsive.  We will for sure book again any time we are looking to stay in West Seattle.  Thank you!"
3206305,28050629,2015-03-16,12453005,William,"Great stay! Exactly as described. We were made to feel welcome and the back yard is beautiful.
The location is convenient to West Seattle and downtown. 
The fresh eggs when we got there were a nice added touch. 
We'll definitely be back!"
3206305,28429280,2015-03-23,7242265,Annika,"
They have a really cute place and if it was not raining we would have definitely enjoyed an outdoors fire. The organic eggs and oatmeal were a nice touch! The bedroom and living room/kitchen are in separate spaces (upstairs and downstairs) but there is no door between them, which can be nice if you have a child you are putting to bed early. We had a little bit of a misunderstanding during our stay, regarding a broken toilet seat. We had not done anything out of the ordinary with the seat, but learned that it had broken during out stay. The communication with the hosts regarding the broken toilet seat was very professional and everything was sorted out. My husband also left his shaving kit and they were really good about sending it to us. This place is close to a lot of sights. This is a great place to stay and would recommend to anyone visiting Seattle."
3206305,30214723,2015-04-19,27071145,Kevin," I cannot say enough good things about Dana and Jack and their accommodations and them as people.

I stayed with them for an extended period  of time/few weeks,  until I found a place to live in Seattle as I relocated for a new job.    They are truly awesome people,  so friendly,  and the place was cozy, comfortable, private, and they were so responsive to any questions I had  or whatever came up.  I really love their backyard garden oasis, so nice to wake up to or just hang out in, and of course they have two awesome cats who are just are total love bugs, Lizzie and Token.

 I don't want to ramble on too much, as there is of course a limitation on the number of words you can type, but I highly recommend Dana and Jack and their place to anyone who may be lucky enough to come across it if it is  available for a stay.    You will not regret it and I don't think you will be left wanting for much of anything either.

Thank you so very much Dana and Jack, I truly enjoyed myself and am happy to of made new friends as well. "
3206305,33293794,2015-05-26,14097671,Zhenni,The neighborhood is nice and quiet. I love the garden and the house very much. The place is clean and is exactly what Dana described online. I would recommend this place if you travel to seattle! 
3206305,34150935,2015-06-05,9151880,Gabriel,Really friendly host and a nice little guesthouse. Liked that we were easily able to get in/out privately.
3206305,35103970,2015-06-15,4909309,Nick,"Great apartment! My mom and I had a great time staying here. Everything was just as pictured and described, including the backyard which was super nice and very pretty.  Definitely recommend."
3206305,35320299,2015-06-17,33845936,Shiyang,"The apartment was located on a hill, the scenery is perfect. And we like the organic coffee and eggs a lot. "
3206305,35459800,2015-06-19,27864098,Jennifer,"Thank you three for your kind hospitality! Your place was a great introduction to the NW for especially my Texan cousin, definitely set the tone for a laid back adventure!"
3206305,36022516,2015-06-24,25823414,Patrick,Dana and the gang were fantastic. Very welcoming and even left coffee and fresh eggs in the fridge for us!! We extremely enjoied our stay and the listing was extremely accurate in every way. I would definitely go back on my next visit to Seattle!
3206305,37460665,2015-07-07,32033120,Zheng,"CONS: 
The hosts were very offensive, we completely felt unsafe. 
- they shouted at us when issue happen instead of sit down and discuss how to resolve. 
- they entered the guest's room without notice.  I challenged them why they do this, they said this is their house.   They take 'messy' private pictures.  They don't respect privacy. 
- they kept messaging us not doing this and that, They are monitoring us. 
- 1 day before we leave, they msg us ' you need to clean the apartment today'.  It looks like they want to drive us out. 

We can't afford monitor the 4 years old kid all the times, we told the host we have a kid and they didn't provide a kid-freiend environment.  We paid $200 for the broken window, although there is no prove that my kid broke it.  

The air mattress didn't work at all when we arrived, and I end up slept on the Sofa which was not suitable for a man and very closed to the noisy refigerator, and almost didn't sleep.  

In general I'm really scared by the hosts.  We want Service, privacy, and safety these basic things, but we got nothing. 

The windows sheding is weak, the Sun wake you up at 5am. 
The noise is a bit loud.  We constantly heard steam-whistle and planes even at nights. The hosts asked us to use an air fan to mitigate the noise. 

PROS:
- the garden is beautiful
- the kitchen is very useful and well equipped. 
- close to the airport. 
"
3206305,37869346,2015-07-11,2841690,Jim,"The descriptive ""Garden Oasis in the City"" could not be more apropos. A definite respite from the hustle and bustle of Seattle and its parking hassles, the super convenient location in West Seattle is beautiful, restful and well placed. Beside the wonderful hosts, you may also spot butterflies, bees, and hummingbirds, plus a couple of cats. Speaking of those hosts, Dana, Jack & Nolan are most gracious and hospitable. Besides helping us use/discover Uber, offering her secret parking place for the Mariners game, and printing our boarding pass after we had to change a reservation, Dana has created a sublime paradise in the backyard, which must be seen to be appreciated. If we are ever fortunate to return to Seattle, we know where we'll be staying. "
3206305,38496941,2015-07-16,31038529,Jessica,"Jack and Dana were very accommodating to me and my friends on our visit to Seattle. The apartment was very cute and clean. It had everything we needed, including lots of info on things to do in the city. We really enjoyed our stay here :)"
3206305,39542475,2015-07-24,37839951,Allison,"My husband and I were hoping to find a quiet oasis to spend a few nights exploring Seattle and away from the hustle and bustle of home. We DEFINITELY found it here! Dana and Jack greeted us when we arrived and comfortably let us know that we were free to utilize their luxurious garden! There was a fully furnished kitchen, fresh eggs in the fridge, and an incredibly cozy bed in the bedroom. Our choice to stay at the West Seattle Greenbelt Garden Oasis, as opposed to a hotel in Seattle, was the best decision we made for our 5-year anniversary trip! We could not have been happier with our experience! Thank you Dana and Jack! :) "
3206305,39762059,2015-07-26,18591849,Tom,"This is a fantastic option in Seattle that we would highly recommend.  Everything exactly as advertised, and delivered flawlessly.  We couldn't have been any more pleased."
3206305,40118507,2015-07-28,24561848,Yumeng,"Dana was very flexible with our check-in time and accommodated our need as fast as she can. The garden is so pretty, esp when its sunny in Seattle."
3206305,40385864,2015-07-30,39086170,Katie,"Dana's guest home was absolutely beautiful, and we really appreciated that the kitchen was stocked so that we could make breakfast!  Everything was extremely clean and well organized, and the garden was beautiful.  Dana was very friendly and accommodating.  I hope to stay here again whenever I revisit Seattle!"
3206305,41337684,2015-08-07,6968068,Lisa,"The listing was just as described . Check in and check out was super easy. Also, we appreciated the complimentary coffee, eggs, and brews in the refrigerator as it was very thoughtful of the hosts to do so. I would say the listing is probably best suited for two people as opposed to three, but its very do-able in a pinch. "
3206305,42035570,2015-08-10,5371183,Jessica,"This perfect little apartment is tucked away behind Dana and Jack's home, accessible via a path that goes around the house and edges their beautiful garden.  The friend who I stayed here with and I had a super busy Seattle weekend and having a space that was quiet and we knew we wouldn't be bothering anyone by coming and going was absolutely ideal.  

The space is perfect for two people.  We didn't spend too much hanging out time there because we had so much going on.  But when we were there we were so comfortable and felt like we could treat it as our very own space.  The split level made it easier for us to get ready in the mornings without being in each others way.  

Towels, cream, coffee, tea and a million other things were provided if needed.  We were so thankful for such thoughtful and easygoing hosts.  The car we rented had tricky headlights and I had left them on and Jack came over to let us know and introduced himself.  AND, my friend accidentally forgot her earrings and Dana was kind enough to get in touch with me and mail them up to Alaska for us.  

Our Seattle weekend was made perfect very much thanks to this great, easy space.  I would (and will) recommend it to anyone looking for a perfect space for a Seattle weekend for two."
3206305,42858095,2015-08-16,14298501,Alyssa,"After the craziness of wedding planning, I knew my husband and I would want a relaxing, cozy, and welcoming environment for our honeymoon in Seattle. When we came across Dana's listing, we were thrilled. 

The price was just right, the location was perfect (the best spot to come home to after a day in the city), and Dana and her family seemed very inviting.

When we arrived, they had left champagne and fresh blackberries and cherries in the fridge for us, and there was beautiful bouquet of flowers on the table. The kitchen was equipped with all the basics plus a little more, and I can't tell you how nice it was knowing that eggs, oatmeal, and coffee would be available for us in the morning. 

We enjoyed our stay a LOT. Dana is quick with responses and is the type of host who will go the extra mile to make you comfortable. The privacy was also nice, but I made sure to meet her before leaving and it was a pleasure. They really have a knack for this process, and we would stay here again in a heartbeat!"
3206305,43720237,2015-08-21,33075630,Jennifer,"Easy to get to from the airport (with a car), clean private apartment in a beautiful garden. It was a pleasant and convenient stay with welcoming hosts! Thank you for having me!"
3206305,44051578,2015-08-23,16285476,Lee,Our stay here was very nice. It was clean and well stocked especially if you are interested in using the kitchen. They were thoughtful in the information they left for us about great local places and the garden view was nice. I would recommend this place.
3206305,44558567,2015-08-27,3424501,Balu,"This was my first experience using airbnb and was extremely pleased with my stay with Dana and Jack.  They are such gracious hosts with an eye for every little detail that makes you feel at home.

The bed is extremely comfortable and the kitchen is well stocked that you can cook all your meals in a day!  You also get to enjoy a rare perk of picking fresh vegetables and herbs from Dana's well maintained garden!!

The stay was so pleasant and comfortable that from now on, my every visit to Seattle will find me requesting to stay at their place!!"
3206305,45519677,2015-09-03,3355312,Ashley,"This was the loveliest of little getaways in West Seattle. The place has all the necessities for a comfortable stay and Dana takes extra special care of her guests by providing eggs, teas, and cream. She and Jack were great hosts: communication was quick, directions on how to get into the house were easy, and Dana even lets you eat from her garden! 

Being in West Seattle for work, this place was the perfect location and I would definitely stay again if given the chance!  "
3206305,46906324,2015-09-14,3959092,Heather,Jack and Dana were fantastic hosts.  The apartment was perfect with everything you could possibly need and the yard was beautiful.  Jack even helped us jump our car when the battery died.  Really great ABnB experience!
3206305,48951102,2015-09-29,19012820,Dustin,"What a great place to stay! Dana, Jack, and Nolan are very nice. The house is very peaceful and quiet, and exactly what we needed for a relaxing vacation.  I would absolutely stay there again. "
3206305,49027582,2015-09-30,14752295,Kelly,"Small but very cute.  Would have preferred a little more seclusion but the owners were very friendly and respected our privacy.  We were at the tail end of our trip so we were looking to just relax and the apartment worked out just great.

Beautiful yard!  Lizzie was also very sweet and friendly.  Would definitely recommend if you're looking to get away from the city. "
888967,3965845,2013-03-31,5467361,Quynh,"Eco-friendly has never been so stylish or more comfortable! One look at this house and you can see that being environmentally conscious does not mean you have to give up on style or comfort. The Zero-Energy House is designed to reduce wasteful energy consumption while at the same time create a warm and inviting (not to mention healthy) living environment. From the light-filled spaces to the cleverly designed toilets, this home is a true delight - a perfect reflection of its owners Eric and his wife Alex (and don't forget Beatrice the puppy), who are just the most wonderful and welcoming hosts! Not only are they passionate about sharing their home and building green, but we also came to find we had quite a lot of other interests in common - food, travel, outreach, etc. I dare you to leave this house without feeling inspired! "
888967,4259877,2013-04-22,5762130,Drew,"It was great meeting Eric, although we didn't meet until we were just checking out. Unfortunately we didn't get to meet his wife or their awesome puppy (he showed us a picture) who was totally quiet all night.

The house is amazing. Brand new, clean and very interesting in all of the creative ideas that they used to save energy and materials. We definitely left trying to figure out what we can incorporate into our own home.

We will absolutely consider staying with Eric the next time we go up to Seattle!

I fell in love with this place from the moment I walked in.  The house is very spacious, bright, and beautifully designed.  The bedroom was exceptionally large, clean and private, and had it's own bathroom, which featured a water-saving sink connected to an eco-toilet.  Eric and his lovely wife were fabulous hosts, very accomodating, and easy to talk to.  I loved the location and the neighbourhood, it's quiet and close to everything.  I would definitely recommend this place to anybody looking for affordable, eco-friendly, and inspired accomodations!"

888967,4575919,2013-05-13,2649364,Nancy,"great location and a great place to stay in Ballard!  Eric and Alex have a super ecco home and it is worth staying there just to get the good karma of living net zero and the health benefits of their conscious design.  Plus the house is very clean and the furnishings are new!  Easy to park your bio-diesel VW or zip-car, but there is no problem if you still own an SUV.  We will stay with Eric and Alex again and we might just stop by to charge our cell phones when the grid goes kaput.

I loved learning about their Zero-Energy House.  Eric was quite responsive and friendly over text and e-mail, though we missed meeting him in person."
888967,5229286,2013-06-19,6202393,Xiaowen,"What a lovely home in Ballard!  We enjoyed the clean spacious accommodations, the quiet neighborhood, and the proximity to all the places we wanted to go.  I wish we had more time to visit with Alex and Eric about the zero energy features of their lovely home - but we had a lot of family to visit.  :-)

Our highest recommendations for this Spacious Room!"
888967,5412828,2013-06-29,269783,Jorge Royan,"Our stay at Alex and Eric's was delightful. They are a young, creative and absolutely kind couple, and their house is spacious, modern and refreshing. 
The neighborhood is very quiet, and our stay quite pleasant. 
I have to add that while I was there I got a heavy cold, and was coughing all our stay. Not only they did make any comment on my pounding cough, but also while there, they offered my wife the use of the 3rd bedroom so she could sleep without suffering my coughs, with no comments or demands. I thank you guys for that."
888967,5714727,2013-07-13,4005050,Kevin,"Staying at Eric and Alex's Zero-Energy House was a tremendous experience. The house itself is beautiful. The photographs do in fact do the house a certain amount of justice but nothing quite compares to actually being in the house. There was a tremendous amount of thought and design acuity put into the making of the house and it was just a pleasure to stay in it. Not to mention, it was supremely clean and just felt incredibly new overall. So it seems obvious that my girlfriend and I were quite satisfied with the bedroom in which we stayed. Lots of closet space and drawer space, and lots of space in general. The windows afforded a nice cool breeze at all times and real nice sheets of fresh natural lighting. And again, supremely clean. The location is tremendous as well. The neighborhood itself is quiet and safe. I didn't rent a car so I didn't really pay attention to whether or not there were any parking restrictions but I really cannot imagine there being much difficulty in finding parking. As for the house's proximity to things to do; my girlfriend was vending at a art/crafts show at Seattle Center and there was a bus stop two blocks away from the house where we picked up a bus that took us to Seattle Center in less than 15 minutes (and once you get to Seattle Center, you can walk, bike, or catch another bus quite easily to other parts of the city like Belltown, Pikes Place Market, the sports venues, South Lake Union, Capitol Hill, etc.). Not to mention, for eating and dining, there are just loads of restaurants and bars within completely reasonable walking distance from the house (5-10 min walks). And finally, coordinating the check-in and check-out with Eric was simple and effortless. Even though we didn't cross paths too frequently, I have no reservations in saying that Eric and Alex are nice, personable people and tremendous AirBnB hosts without a doubt."
888967,5789409,2013-07-16,4005050,Kevin,"(I stayed at Eric and Alex's Zero-Energy House for two days and then a day later, for another two days. To help better visualize: I stayed there, Wednesday and Thursday, then found a place to stay in Capitol Hill for Friday, and then returned to the Zero-Energy House for Saturday and Sunday and checked out Monday. So I posted two reviews of Eric and Alex's Zero-Energy House because technically I stayed there on two separate occasions however, for all intents and purposes, my stay on Wednesday and Thursday did not deviate in quality (SUPER HIGH QUALITY might I add) from my stay on Saturday and Sunday; therefore I wrote the same review (see below) for both of my stays just because it felt like one singular experience. Just wanted to post a clarification just in case this review appears twice under the reviews for Eric and Alex's Zero-Energy House. Anyway, the short version is the Zero-Energy House is the best place I've stayed in via AirBnB.).

888967,7525454,2013-09-23,8633255,Cristal,"Eric and Alex were great hosts! Their home is beautiful and our accommodations were very nice. The room was clean, spacious and private. We really enjoyed learning about their sustainable lifestyle, and found it inspiring. It also made us feel right at home to be greeted by their sweet pup! The location was wonderful, close to bus stops and of course the wonderful Ballard area. This was our first time using Airbnb, and it couldn't have gone more smoothly. Eric was very easy to communicate with and responded promptly. I would highly recommend staying at the Zero-Energy House while in Seattle, I know we will keep them in mind for our next trip! "
888967,7653579,2013-09-28,6638957,Cara,"Eric's place was lovely - quiet, clean, and walking distance to everything we needed plus easy parking for Seattle. Although we didn't get to meet he or Alex, he kept in great touch to make sure everything went smoothly."
888967,7719992,2013-09-30,4204300,Jessica,We were in town for a friend's wedding and staying here worked out perfectly. The house and room were lovely. The bed was really comfortable and Eric was very responsive setting up our reservation. I liked all the neat eco-features of the house especially the hand wash toilet. I need one of those.
888967,7793366,2013-10-03,3375611,Henrike,"We´ve had a short but wonderful time in this truly special place in Seattle. Eric and Alex are great hosts, especially Alex´s cookies are delicious!"

Thanks Alex and Eric :)

888967,9965257,2014-01-21,10239938,Lucinda,"This is a lovely and convenient place to stay in Seattle.  The accommodations are simple, clean, quiet and bright and the host is welcoming and pleasant to deal with. It is in the very fun and funky neighborhood of Ballard; easy to travel to and from the airport and downtown.  I spent part of my time as a tourist and part of it visiting nearby friends, so I wasn't at the house except to sleep and shower. Still, it was a place I know I would have been comfortable in if I needed it to use it as more of a home base. I highly recommend this rental."
888967,11780913,2014-04-14,14056945,Geoff,"Great hosts, great house, great dog. We have been home for a week and are still telling people about our first airbnb experience. They pointed us in the perfect direction for sunset and dinner, and invited us out to their friends band cd release party. Great Great Great. If you going to Seattle you want to stay here and you want to be close to Ballard. "
888967,12935583,2014-05-14,13449667,Karen,"We were thrilled with our stay. Eric and Alex are super helpful, friendly and responsive, and their house is lovely. The room is bright, spacious and comfortable, and we enjoyed learning about the interesting process they went through to build such a green space. "
888967,13214800,2014-05-22,2458289,Emily And Adam,"Eric and Alex were lovely and great in making us feel at home. Their house is very clean and they put so much care into building a very special home. 
We were grateful for their accommodating our little dog and his quirks, and we highly recommend them as hosts!"
888967,14274612,2014-06-16,7891674,Dara,"What a wonderful house, great neighborhood, and fantastic hosts. Couldn't be better. Absolutely perfect. Thank you so much, Eric and Alex! Highly recommended! Will definitely try to stay there again in the future! "
888967,14625455,2014-06-23,1971733,Caroline,"We had a great time staying at Eric and Alex's zero energy home.  We were on a ""stay-cation"" and really appreciated their generosity, friendliness and overall flexible nature!  Our room and the house itself were comfortable and the neighborhood is a nice one: easy going, and walking distance (or by bus) to Ballard and Phinney Ridge, stores, restaurants, movies etc.   We'd highly recommend staying with them!"
888967,15043605,2014-07-01,3211932,Carole,"I felt welcomed by Eric and Alex.  I would head in or out, meet up with them and touch base or chat briefly.  They were very friendly.  The house was lovely, and my room & bathroom were very comfortable.  Both the house and the neighborhood were quiet.  The neighborhood is residential and within walking distance of bus lines, downtown Ballard and plenty of trendy restaurants.  I would open the windows at night and enjoy the cool night air.  Perfect for sleeping.  To top it off the house is a model in conservation that was thrilling to hear about.  Finally the location was perfect for me since I wanted something near the Ballard area.  "
888967,16063659,2014-07-21,3993420,Jack,"Staying in Alex and Eric's environmental house was such a treat. The room we stayed in was awesome and so much bigger than we imagined from the photos and the welcome we received was the perfect start to our time in Seattle. Not only is their house incredible in terms of how it works, but it is also wonderful inside and we wished we could have stayed for longer. 
Check in and check out could not have been easier and they were very easy to communicate with. Their recommendations were absolutely spot on and we really enjoyed meeting them and getting to know them and Beatrice, their loveable dog who we wanted to take home with us."
888967,16343004,2014-07-26,5621619,Andrea,"We had a great time at Erics beautiful Zero-Energy House, we would stay there again and we can recommend it without any hesitation. Eric and Alex gave us a warm welcome including a tasty glass of wine and a lot of tips, but left us also a lot of privacy throughout our stay. Their house is not just super clever planned and built but very tasteful furnished and decorated with friendly and warm atmosphere. Everything was tidy and clean, the room is bright and spacious, the bathroom is beautiful and was sparkling clean. Ballard is a great and peaceful neighborhood with beautiful little cafes and bus stops in close walking distance. And then of course there was Beatrice, the cute and super friendly dog, we could cuddle when we got up in the morning. Our stay could not have been better in any kind, thanks a lot Alex and Eric for a great airbnb experience! "
888967,17332307,2014-08-11,12629384,Therese,We felt very welcomed in Eric's house. It looks like on the photos and it had everything we needed. Eric and Alex created a very quiet and peaceful atmosphere. We felt right at home! Great neighborhood and convenient for us.
888967,17769160,2014-08-17,17478994,Justin,"Eric was very welcoming. We didn't spend much time in the house and didn't get a chance to see much of Alex, but Eric was very friendly and we had a great experience. Bea is a wonderful dog. The house is very well-insulated and the quietude helped us sleep well at night. The entire house is comfortable, simple, clean, and clutter-free, though everything you would need as a traveller is accounted for. We enjoyed learning about the home and eco-friendly building practices. The immediate neighborhood is fairly quiet and it's very convenient for public transportation. Love Seattle. We're very happy we stayed here."
888967,18066761,2014-08-21,16910402,Judy,"Alex and Eric set the GOLD standard as Airbnb hosts.  Their thoughtfully designed home is welcoming, restful, comfortable…and spotlessly clean.  It’s a joy to be in the space they’ve created!  They are located in a great walking/running/biking neighborhood, with convenient access to just about any place in the city you might want to visit.  I loved having the chance to briefly get to know them, and their sweet, lovable dog Bea.  I highly recommend a stay in their home."
888967,18883265,2014-09-02,17743378,Simon,"Though we did not have the pleasure of meeting Eric and his wife Alex during our stay at their Zero-Energy House, they were perfect absentee hosts.  Communication leading up to our visit was seamless and we found that everything was as advertise upon arrival.  Though the privacy of an empty house was nice, I would have loved to meet our hosts based on shared interests that were uncovered during pre-stay emails.  
The house is beautiful and the room was ideal for our needs.  Since the ""green"" concept of the accommodations is in line with my fiancée and my personal lifestyles, we felt the house was a perfect fit for us.  The neighborhood is the primary reason we stumbled across the listing and as we thought, the location was ideal.  Ballard has everything we were looking for, but it is also ideally situated for exploring the rest of Seattle.  I truly can't imagine a better place to call home for a few days.  "
888967,19075294,2014-09-06,2910853,Mariel And Jason,"We only briefly met Alex, but our interactions with Eric were very welcoming and helpful. We stayed at the house on the last night of a two week trip so we were pretty tired, but Eric helped us figure out where to eat and how to explore the neighborhood. The space was beautiful, immaculate and comfortable. We lacked for nothing."
888967,19206290,2014-09-08,16237245,Wendi,"Eric's home is absolutely beautiful.  He has taken the Airbnb experience to the next level.  On arrival we were greeted by Eric (and his adorable dog, Beatrice) and he made us both feel very welcome.  He had a list of local recommendations, which was really helpful to us.  The suite has been decorated since this picture was taken and now has a dresser and a bookshelf.  It's a rather spacious room, and the bed is wonderful.  We enjoyed having the whole upstairs to ourselves.  We would whole-heartedly recommend this listing and will be coming back ourselves the next time we visit Seattle."
888967,19552783,2014-09-14,8595001,Jay,I had a great experience at Eric's home. Eric and Sam were very accommodating and helped us with our questions and recommended places for us to go.  Overall it was a great experience!
888967,19914503,2014-09-20,3901175,David,"Eric and Alex are very welcoming hosts, able to accommodate us at the last minute. Their net-zero-energy house is both beautiful and inspiring. The bedroom is very comfy, and the neighborhood is very quiet (but close to cool restaurants). Their dog, Beatrice, is a love!"
888967,20033277,2014-09-22,5020060,Todd,Eric and Alex (and Bea) were phenomenal hosts and made our trip to Seattle fantastic.  Their home is absolutely gorgeous and inspiring (with what I think are some of the coolest toilets I've ever seen).  We loved everything about the neighborhood and our brief time there...it's quite a seductive city!  
888967,23153883,2014-11-24,130500,Marna,"Our stay was very comfortable, fascinating, and easy.  It's location near Phinney Ridge and Ballard was exactly where we wanted to be.  Loved experiencing a zero energy home and will look forward to learning more about our hosts' experience in creating their unique home the next time we're in the neighborhood."
888967,24208583,2014-12-22,11356868,Esther,"This is a lovely quite and cozy room in a very nice part of Seattle. The room was very spacious and comfortable on the top floor, which feels very private and it has its own bathroom just outside the room. It is as nice as it looks in the listing. Eric and Alex are a lovely and very chilled couple and very welcoming. It was my first experience of Airbnb in North America and I highly recommend it! Beatriz, their lovely dog was also very easy going and lovely to have around. Thanks Eric and Alex!"
888967,24625623,2014-12-31,25143940,Johanna,"This was our first airbnb experience and we couldn't have asked for a better place! Eric and Alex are very welcoming and their dog Beatrice is just lovely. The neighborhood is great (we loved the Ballard Farmers Market) and the house was just amazing - spacious, clean and beautiful interior design with all those details.  We highly recommend to experience this zero energy house!"
888967,24793016,2015-01-02,7336703,Liz,"A last minute decision to celebrate NYE with Ballard friends meant I had to rush to find a place to stay. I came upon a zero-energy house listing down the road from where we wanted to be. I contacted Eric and he quickly replied back with a confirmation. Although I didn’t get a chance to meet Eric, he maintained communication with me until we arrived (from Canada) and met his lovely wife Alex and their playful dog Beatrice. We were immediately made to feel welcomed and settled into our very clean and comfortable room. There are no surprises here and although I feel I will only be repeating what has been said before by others, it’s worth saying again. The house is as described. A “green” home designed to conserve energy and leave a very light footprint. This was the first time I had experienced using a grey water basin and was thrilled by its efficiency. Radiant flooring downstairs means my feet are warm by the time we headed upstairs to the beautifully reclaimed wood floors. A warm, bright and big bedroom with strong comfortable bed with a luxurious comforter that kept us warm and cozy throughout the night. The washroom is two steps outside the bedroom door and has all the amenities you need. A relaxed and tranquil environment in a sweet neighbourhood--can't wait to go back. Thank you for the great hospitality!"
888967,25116689,2015-01-06,25437483,Javier,"Eric's place was really warm and welcoming. He wasn't home when I arrived, but he made it seamless to get into the home, which was both clean and had everything I needed to get settled in. 

He also has an incredible library of hundreds of books with some really cool titles. I ultimately left town earlier than expected, but Eric was really accommodating in adjusting my initial reservation. "
888967,25298125,2015-01-11,8905156,Ally,Eric was great. The place was perfectly located. Nice and clean. We'll definitely be back. 
888967,25388830,2015-01-14,791723,Barbara,"this home is in a quiet, very walkable neighborhood in northwest Seattle.  I did not have much chance to interact with the hosts as I left early.  I loved their sweet dog, Bea who saw me off early in the morning on my drive back to Vancouver."
888967,26130804,2015-02-04,20346031,Sarah,"Eric's Zero-energy home is spacious, comfortable, and extremely clean.  Eric and Alex were gracious and considerate hosts.  I highly recommend this listing, and hope to return! "
888967,26198195,2015-02-06,27013816,Paul,"Eric and Alex were gracious hosts, they made us feel right at home.  Everything was very clean and they made it easy to get into the house.  Their dog Bea was really sweet and welcomed us right in.  The house is in walking distance of downtown Ballard with some great bars and restaurants. I would recommend their house to anyone looking to stay in Seattle."
888967,26742781,2015-02-18,22022357,Ganive,"Eric and Alex have a beautiful home with some very neat energy-efficient and environmentally friendly modifications.  Although they were out of town on a trip upon our arrival, Eric made all of the necessary arrangements for us to easily get into the house and settle in.  The house is in a great location, short walking distance to downtown Ballard which has tons of wonderful restaurants/shops.  The house itself is very clean and spacious with a lot of natural light.  I definitely recommend this listing and will be sure to stay here again during future Seattle visits."
888967,27347414,2015-03-02,26867464,Chris,The listing and pictures accurately describe the home and room/bath.  The neighborhood is quiet yet located 1 block from a bus line and a 15 minute walk to downtown Ballard.
888967,27677075,2015-03-09,26643087,Heather,"An interesting and comfortable space.  Eric, Alex and Beatrice were all friendly, laid back hosts, and gave good suggestions for exploring the area.  I enjoyed learning about their home and future similar projects.  The experience, location and space were a perfect fit for my needs. Thank-you!"
888967,28231489,2015-03-20,29124370,Eunice,"As first-time airbnb users, my boyfriend and I were lucky to have stayed at Eric and Alex's place. It was very spacious and clean. Also, with all the modern amenities that were available, we were surprised by how there was no difference between traditional and zero-energy house. We had a great time staying at their house in Ballard and it made us re-think about traditional way of using energy. "
888967,28404554,2015-03-23,130500,Marna,"This was a return visit for us which speaks to our high satisfaction with this home.  Added to our enjoyment this time was meeting Eric, Alex, and Beatrice. We felt very comfortable, had a fun visit and will gladly anticipate requesting staying here for future trips."
888967,28828544,2015-03-30,21467612,Patty & Jim,"Eric and Alex were wonderful hosts. We enjoyed sharing clean living experiences.  Access to the house was easy, Eric and Alex were not home when we arrived, but we met up when Miechelle and I returned from walking to dinner. Their dog Bea was really sweet and friendly.   The house is airy, bright and clean.  I would recommend their house to anyone looking to stay in Seattle."
888967,31435705,2015-05-05,28630788,Gabriella,"Eric and Alex were great hosts! We loved staying in their zero-energy home! They provided us with all the essentials (shampoo, soap, towels, a comfy bed, maps/books, etc.) and they had wifi and a very lovable dog, Beatrice. The listing was very accurate, the house had a great design, and there was an info sheet provided with places to eat and FAQs about the house and area. The neighborhood had lots of great shops and places to eat as well. If you wanted to venture out to another part of the city, there were multiple bus stops close by and it was quite easy to get around also. Overall, we had a great time in Seattle and enjoyed staying in this Airbnb!"
888967,31976084,2015-05-12,130500,Marna,"Back again for a third time. We felt welcome, comfortable and at ease in returning to a familiar place and people. Thank you!"

888967,32828702,2015-05-22,25931143,Cary,Everything was great!  Hosts were welcoming and helpful.  We would have loved to stay longer and enjoyed the extensive library.  Staying in a zero energy house was truly inspiring.

888967,41960338,2015-08-10,426577,Gene,"Eric was a fantastic host! It was very easy to coordinate our check-in and he was responsive to any questions we had. The AirBNB is probably the nicest house I've ever stayed at, with a great selection of books to browse and a friendly dog. The house is in a nice neighborhood not too far of a walk from the commercial area in Ballard. Eric's house guide came with a comprehensive list of businesses to check out in the neighborhood. We had a great stay - and would do it again!"
888967,43854330,2015-08-22,11738110,Paula,"Eric and Alex have a beautiful, peaceful, very clean home. They were very communicative before our arrival, so we knew exactly what to expect, and what was expected of us as guests. Eric greeted us upon our late evening arrival, and then left us to ourselves.

The neighborhood was very quiet throughout our stay, we woke to almost complete silence! Eric was available for any questions, and we had a nice chat about the home (very interesting!) and their next project.

I would highly recommend this home for a stay in Seattle."
888967,44121229,2015-08-24,17477014,Kyle,"We were greeted by Alex, who let us in and gave us a quick overview of their beautiful home and city. She was very nice and provided us a great deal of knowledge about the city of Ballard. Their house was extremely unique and really made for a neat place to stay. Would love to stay here again!"

888967,45262331,2015-09-01,5871106,Ray,"Our stay at Eric and Alex's home was very nice. A clean, comfortable room and bathroom awaited us in this contemporary home. Eric was very kind to us and interested in our stay in Seattle. Key box made arrival very easy and convenient.  

Great experience - highly recommend! "
888967,46456879,2015-09-10,38976322,Taylor,"Eric and Alex were absolutely incredible hosts! They were responsive, considerate and caring during my stay at their beautiful home. It was a pleasure to stay there and it certainly won't be the last time I visit!"
888967,46896274,2015-09-14,39609477,Rosalie,"We had a very comfortable stay in Ballard at Eric and Alex's home. The house is beautiful and Eric, Alex and Bea the dog were very welcoming. There were nice shops and restaurants within walking distance from the house and a bus stop just at the end of the street to get into the city centre easily. We would certainly stay here again if/when we return to Seattle. Thanks for having us and for the tasty oatcakes!"
888967,47715811,2015-09-21,14557409,Jordan,"Staying at Eric's place in Ballard was great. It's a very nice, comfortable, and super cool house! The location is pretty walkable too, which was really nice. We wish we had been able to spend more time with Eric and Alex, but we would love to stay again next time we are in town, and we would definitely recommend staying with them to anybody visiting Seattle. "
888967,49085904,2015-09-30,45277645,Corrine,I know I was extremely lucky having such a positive experience for my first Airbnb stay. Eric and Alex were so gracious and their new home is very nice - loved the energy efficient designs! The accommodations were perfect for my needs - private bathroom and bedroom - and the location was close enough to downtown but also offered some great shops and restaurants in close proximity. Their dog Beatrice was quite the charmer too! I will definitely be back with my husband on our next weekend getaway to Seattle!
888967,49327628,2015-10-03,40216652,Mark,"We loved this place and the neighborhood. The house was peaceful, quiet, and super-clean with a great, friendly pet dog who seemed suspiciously guilty at all times. Eric and Alex were excellent welcoming hosts who made us feel at home.  Their restaurant recommendations were top-notch.   Would definitely recommend!"
888967,49657502,2015-10-05,32170522,Andrew,"Although my partner and I weren't in the house a majority of the time, we appreciated the small notes Eric and Alex left for us when they were gone.

It was a very welcoming, clean and beautiful house. All the amenities mentioned on the listing were there and their neighbor were very friendly and approachable.

Their house had a pretty central location in Seattle and there were alot of great restaurants/cafes in the area. I would highly recommend this place for anyone visiting the Seattle area.

Thank you Eric and Alex for a phenomenal Airbnb experience :)!"
888967,52801435,2015-11-01,47674620,Luke,"The room and home were clean and very nice. 

I would recommend this to a friend."
888967,55406709,2015-12-01,34273763,Aparna,"My stay at this place was great. Eric responded in a timely manner to all my queries. The place itself was clean, well-maintained and in an excellent location in Seattle. Eric was also helpful in letting us know where to go and what to do. His wife was kind enough to share her food she cooked with us too! Overall, it was an awesome place to stay. I'm definitely coming back here the next time I visit Seattle. "
7627794,42055534,2015-08-10,40171050,Johnny,"First off, I want to mention that it was both the host and my first time using airbnb. Ian was very welcoming and answered his texts promptly. Instruction and pictures were provided on how to get to the location. The pictures you see do not capture the true magic of the loft. My party consisted of 4 and the loft had plenty of room for all. The decor was contemporary and the location of the place is right in the heart of Seattle. There is easy access to wherever you need to go. Upon arrival, there was coffee and a bottle of wine which was nice. The location also has a large projector for movies at night and a patio area that is perfect for looking into the lake and bbqing. Will definitely book again for our next trip to Seattle."
7627794,43825704,2015-08-22,40212535,Jack,Best place ever and I am a diamond member with Hilton. I almost want write a bad review so it is available when I want to rent again. Ian and Min were fantastic hosts. 5+ stars
7627794,45400542,2015-09-02,2663715,Zharoff,"This airbnb is the best I've ever stayed in. I almost don't want to write a good review, because I want to be able to stay there again- but it's too good to not share. 

The location in the harbor is quiet and serene, while being conveniently minutes away from downtown. Taking a bus is easy, and parking is also easy if you have a car.

The kitchen is well-equipped, and the bed is better than my own at home. The deck has a small hot tub that was perfect for cool Seattle evenings and harbor viewing. There is also a fantastic set-up inside with a projector and movies/netflix. 

Overall impression: This is a dream-flat, and I want to build a place exactly like it. You should definitely stay here.

Extra bonus: Ian and Min left a bottle of local wine and a lovely card to greet me. I couldn't have felt more welcome!

387078,4839876,2013-05-28,5751001,Ben,Great apartment in a great neighborhood. The host was very accommodating and quick to respond. Just 2 blocks from Analog Coffee.
387078,5000488,2013-06-06,6544223,Jill,"Easy check-in, great place, clean and convenient!"
387078,7032658,2013-09-04,5974523,Rhomel,We had a great time at this location and Autumn was a very helpful host. There was a lot of room for all four of us to move around and not get in each other's way. The bed was comfortable and easy to sleep in and the various chairs in the living room allowed us to sit where ever we wanted whenever we wanted to. Highly recommended.
387078,8996606,2013-12-01,9095296,Farooq,"We had a great experience! This was our first visit to Seattle, and we were particularly worried about finding a place that was kid-friendly yet still in a fun neighborhood, central to a lot of things. This was perfect. 

First, it's a very nice, clean, well-managed place. The place is just furnished and stocked very nicely. Think high end hotel. Not only are there the usual plates, glasses, pans, pots, etc., there are also kids cups, plates, and utensils, which is a very nice touch. 

Second, the location is phenomenal. You really can't ask for better as a tourist. Capitol Hill itself is a great neighborhood. Lots of walkable restaurants. With kids, it was great to have Volunteer Park at walking distance. We made lots of use of that. Pike Place Market was a bit of a further walk, but we did actually walk there. And Autumn, the property manager, is great--very responsive and down to earth. We had one minor issue that was taken care of very promptly so if anything it makes me more likely to stay here. "
387078,9402399,2013-12-27,9051609,Armando,"Autumn was pleasant, cooperative and extremely knowledgeable, which was a great benefit to us as we were new comers to Seattle.
All I can say is this is the place we will stay on our next visit."
387078,9806157,2014-01-11,9072684,Jean,"We had a great stay..! Convenient location. Nice Clean cozy apartment..! Analog coffee was close, Glo's cafe for breakfast.. Mmmm..  There was no Nintendo Wii as described but the place more than provided everything you could need for a pleasant stay in Capitol Hill... I'd recommend it ;)"
387078,10504337,2014-02-22,11127578,Jose,Great location. Nice decoration and easy experience!
387078,10570495,2014-02-25,1753109,Jessica,"A clean, spacious, and comfortable apartment in a great location. You wont find a better host. Autumn was flexible with our travel hours, quick to communicate, and made great recommendations. I would absolutely stay there again!!"
387078,11041387,2014-03-17,11210231,Samantha,Beautiful apartment in a good location. Downtown is not on the doorstep but in easy walking distance. There are many good places to eat & drink close by. We had a great weekend here! 
387078,11508975,2014-04-06,3135269,Marlene,"We had a great stay in Seattle. It was a good location from where we could walk almost anywhere. Autumn was a great host, she recommended us places and restaurants, (Glo's was the perfect breakfastjoint!) which was a good place to start at. The bed was really comfy (!). We didn't use everything in the apartment (ate out etc) but I figure you had almost everything you have at home if you wan't to spend less money eating out everyday (the QFC 5 minutes away was also a perfect located). All over a good experience."

387078,13894469,2014-06-07,4920751,Benjamin,This is a great place to stay.   Wonderful location and very comfortable.
387078,15697085,2014-07-14,16542176,Bernadette,"Thanks Amber and Lori for an amazing stay. The location and apartment was perfect for our 4 day mini-vacay. The apartment was very clean and very accessible to the rest of Seattle. We can't wait to come back again :) 
"
387078,15974500,2014-07-19,14314819,Theresa,"This was my first AirBnB experience and it was better than expected. Highlights are below, but overall I would absolutely recommend this listing (especially if you are new to AirBnb). I gave it a 5 because I was completely satisfied after being a little hesitant to do an AirBnb, but as this was my first stay, I don't have much to compare it to.

Positives:
-Seamless/easy check in
-Clean (specifically the sheets smelled great and it was apparent that they were freshly laundered. Oddly enough, the bed was my biggest concern with an AirBnB as I was afraid it wouldn't have the same treatment as hotel sanitation. exceeded expectations)
-Very comfortable bed
-A welcome tray was laid out for our arrival and included a book with recommendations of things to do, wine bottle opener, complimentary snacks, wine glasses, and list of wifi access and other rental needs.
-Great location (we walked everywhere)

Negatives (BUT NOT DEAL BREAKERS!! just as FYI's):
-Air conditioner is a window unit and only in the living room. bedroom has a fan and was perfectly fine for me. My boyfriend, however, was a bit warm. We also had two abnormally hot Seattle days.
-We were unable to use the bathroom faucet as it was broken. To Autumn's defense, we did not ask for it to be fixed during our stay, but instead just used the kitchen sink for bathroom faucet needs.
-Sunlight in apartment was not as bright as the pictures portray, (wondering if it's because the construction is blocking a lot of it). 
-The green apples on the kitchen table are FAKE! Both my boyfriend and I were duped on separate occasions. They even have bruises on them like real apples! I'm not even mad, I'm impressed."
387078,17141400,2014-08-08,8354280,Andy,"The apartment was equipped with everything we needed and was very clean upon arrival. The newly designed interior was very nice as well. One note: the big windows on the front of the apartments face west, which causes the place to heat up quiet a bit in the afternoon. Fortunately the air conditioning fights hard against this, so you'll be happy you have it.

There was construction on the building next door that started each morning at 7:30. It would have been nice to be notified of this beforehand, even though there was nothing the property manager could do. Nevertheless, early mornings weren't too big of an issue since Top Pot was just a 3 minute walk away. 

You really couldn't ask for a better location: plenty of coffee, food, and entertainment options within a 5 - 30 minute walk in any direction. We did rent a car to leave the Capitol Hill and Downtown area, and to take a day trip to Friday Harbor. 

Seattle is a great city, and this apartment certainly helped us unwind after enjoying all it has to offer. "
387078,18145785,2014-08-22,19796138,Shane,"Autumn was great& helpful host!  She met me there as soon as i arrived to give me all the access i needed as well as a review of the space & guidelines.  i really enjoyed the space & the neighborhood location made it even better. i enjoyed the laid back neighborhood, close to many stores and a vibrant street.  definitely a great stay."
387078,18589968,2014-08-28,2290510,Alexandra,"Autumn was a great host! She was very friendly and accommodating, and communicated well with me throughout the stay! The apartment itself was very nice. Totally renovated and very spacious. I stayed by myself, but it would be perfect for a couple! There was a bottle of wine in the fridge and snacks left. They also had a book with directions and things to do in the area. I would definitely recommend staying here! Great experience."
387078,19357393,2014-09-11,5863998,Robert F.,"My partner and I were in Seattle to be married and wanted a convenient location with access to cool sights, great restaurants and bars.  Our condo on Summit Avenue did not disappoint.  Everything was fresh and clean and the fully equipped kitchen was very nice. Autumn made check-in quite easy and gave lots of good recommendations.  Would stay here again.....I highly recommend this condo!"
387078,20620223,2014-10-02,374596,Sarah,Host was incredibly warm and professional. Apartment was exactly as photographed / described and immaculately clean. Perfect location. 
387078,20815941,2014-10-06,17379328,Cameron,Excellent space. Fantastic location. Highly recommended 
387078,21768925,2014-10-23,12988945,Andrew,"This is an awesome listing. Autumn was responsive and attentive when contacted prior to the trip. On check in she was friendly and helpful. The listing itself is great, all the amenities you could conceivably want. It was clean, comfortable, and homey.  There are great shops in the area, and accessibility to the city is fantastic.  There is construction going on next door. It wasn't an issue for me as I was gone a lot during the day, I was made aware of this prior to my booking so I appreciated that as well. All in all, a great listing, I will be back. "
387078,22118772,2014-10-30,18513730,Michael,"My stay at Autumn's place on Capital Hill was just perfect.  Autumn met me at check in to go over the logistics, but everything was so well laid out that it was easy.  The apt. is modern, clean, well lit and has all the amenities one would hope to find in a hotel.  Located right in the heart of the Capital Hill neighborhood, with shops & cafes within a few blocks, I could not have asked for more."
387078,23798908,2014-12-10,56737,Alan,"The listing description was accurate, in a good residential location overlooking the city of Seattle (west side of the building), near Broadway, with lots of excellent places to eat, and a busy Starbucks down the street.  (the Space Needle view was blocked by another building across the street).  We were able to get two parking places.

The interior was exactly as advertised; bed was very good and couch bed acceptable.  Nice, new.  We had to move from one unit to another during our stay and they were comparable.

The only downside is that we didn't know there was a building under construction right next door.  We were gone to work every day, leaving early and returning late, so it didn't bother us, but beware, the construction noises start early.  You should check on the status of this if you plan to be there during the day."
387078,24941528,2015-01-04,2642321,Tian,"It's a nice place to stay in Capital Hill. The apartment is super close to core area in Capital Hill. Within a walkable distance, you can visit Broadway, downtown.
The listing itself is accurate. I really like the interior design.
However, there is one thing worth mentioning.  As mentioned by Alan, the construction site right next to the apartment is really causing lots of noise during the workdays..."
387078,25254545,2015-01-10,5798694,Thomas,"Great place.  Warm and clean. 
Great location.  Central to almost everything. Easy transportation everywhere. 
Great hosts. Very attentive. Offered places to go. Will definitely stay here again. "
387078,25675581,2015-01-22,4849321,Tom,Great neighborhood and great apartment.  Autumn did everything to make the check in process and stay enjoyable.  Great apartment.
387078,26427310,2015-02-12,26654902,Joanna,"Autumn and Robyn were both super helpful and friendly. The apartment is exactly as pictured. The kitchen was fully stocked with utensils, pots, pans, bake ware, etc. There was even a spice rack, umbrella and an HDMI cable! They really did think of everything! This place was perfect for my two-week stay.

Just a note though that this is not an elevator building and this particular unit is located on the third floor. 

It's a great location and very close to great restaurants. "
387078,26604214,2015-02-16,13207783,Megan,"My boyfriend and I spent 4 wonderful days at this property and loved it!

387078,31523621,2015-05-06,26555864,Robert,"The purpose of our trip was to visit family living in the Capitol Hill area of Seattle. The apartment was very comfortable and contemporary. Nicely furnished. Plenty of drawer and closet space. Kitchen was fully-equipped... including the coffee and also some refreshments (thank-you Autumn!).  The Capitol Hill street where the apartment is located is primarily residential /apartments; yet, it was an easy walk to stores, restaurants and bus stop(s). For most in-town exploring, we were fine without a car. (Did a lot of walking, and bus-ing. Cab fare from airport is about $50.00.) Autumn met us on our arrival, welcomed us, and made us feel ""at home.""   "
387078,32058307,2015-05-13,29640131,Chris,Place is in a great location. Went to Seattle with three friends and the space fit us comfortably.

Felt very well welcomed and enjoyed our time in this part of Seattle!"
387078,34225940,2015-06-06,33250081,Doug And Michelle,"When we first arrived Autumn was stuck in traffic so she gave us the directions to get into the apartment and we had no problems.  When she did arrive later that evening, she gave us some great ideas on what to see in Seattle.  We took several of her ideas and had a wonderful time.  The apartment was just as seen and described on the airbnb website.  We loved the amenities and the apartment worked great for our family of 4 with the kids sleeping on the pullout blowup bed in the sofa.  The neighborhood was very nice.  We were 4 blocks from the QFC which had pretty much anything you could ever want and it was open 24/7.  While it was about a 25-30 minute walk to the Space Needle and Seattle Center it was definitely doable and we enjoyed the walk.  There were also many different restaurants on Broadway near the QFC for when we didn't want to eat in downtown Seattle.  We rented a car at the airport but ended up using taxis and Uber most of the time to save on parking and fighting the traffic.  Most fares for going downtown were very reasonable.  We would definitely stay here again."
387078,37540917,2015-07-07,9797207,John,The space was clean and stylish and had everything I needed. I will definitely be back next time I'm through Seattle!
387078,38363426,2015-07-14,4317503,Eva,"My husband and I had to book a last minute 1 night stay while in seattle. Autumn was super responsive and ararnged the stay within just a few hours notice. We were met by someone with the keys who was also friendly explaining anything we had questions about. The condo was in a great location. We were able to walk everywhere. The condo was just like it looks in the pictures, very clean, spacious and comfortable. We only had 1 night however if you are wanting to explore Seattle by foot and get a taste of Capitol Hill this is a perfect place! Thank you!"
387078,40472346,2015-07-31,34371194,Nicole,Apartment was great-exactly as described on the site!  Apartment Manager Rueben was friendly and efficient and was able to check us in and get us keys when we arrived. Location was central.  Had a great stay in Seattle.
387078,41732311,2015-08-09,17049362,Ellen,"We absolutely LOVED staying in this wonderful unit. The photos posted are 100% accurate, the folks managing the rental unit were helpful, responsive and attentive to us and they were very clear in regards to the rules and regulations of the property. We ended up staying for over a week and enjoyed every moment. One thing to note is that the walk to downtown is honestly a trek! There's a monster hill to undertake on the way back, so we ended up using the bus system and also Lyft quite a bit. Broadway St is so close and is honestly my favorite part of Seattle! "

We were celebrating my sister's bday and he left a note saying happy birthday with a bottle of Prosecco! Needless to say, we had a wonderful stay. Thank you Jared. "
6797786,37907964,2015-07-11,37155189,Jonathan,"I am very, very pleased with my stay at this lovely little house in Seattle!  I was coming to town for a wedding of two very dear friends, and I knew I would be very busy and I would need a cozy place to relax at the end of each day.  This place was perfect!  The neighborhood is very clean and quiet and charming.  I immediately got a kick out of the retro vibe inside, especially the 'Brady Bunch' kitchen!  Looking closer, some of that mid-century furniture is really beautiful.  Everything was clean, comfy and functional.  The kitchen was well stocked for almost any need, the bathroom was big and bright, my bed was very soft and I slept really well.  I especially enjoyed the patio, having coffee outside on some beautiful mornings.  I also really liked that I didn't feel like I was intruding on someone's space, this place was just ready to be my home for a few days.  I was totally comfortable.  Jared was a great host, even though we never met face-to-face.  He was still immediately available the few times we needed to communicate.  This was my first airbnb experience, and I am very impressed.  This home was a wonderful place to stay, and completely surpassed my expectations.  I would recommend a stay here for any traveler!  Thanks Jared!"
6797786,38753111,2015-07-18,36659780,Bruce,Jared was a great host and made us feel welcomed. Any questions we had were quickly answered by text or email.
6797786,39062493,2015-07-20,14934885,Thomas,"Jared's house was great.  It's location close to downtown and the international district were a great help to us tourists going between the districts.  Jared's home was well stocked, clean, and easy to navigate.  5 stars."
6797786,39795177,2015-07-26,15347981,Tana,"The place so cute! It's. Complete through back to the 80's. It's a nice rancher style layout, with the awesome deck off the kitchen. There was everything you need! The beds were comfy, and there was more than enough room. Thank you! "
6797786,40282594,2015-07-29,30471907,Deborah,"the house was great
close to downtown and everything our family needed
we found a close by park to watch the sunsets
our first Airbnb and it won't be our last"
6797786,40652144,2015-08-01,9619019,Aneetha,Our stay was pleasant as the house had all the needed amenities. Very clean and well equipped. Quiet and nice neighborhood. Easily reachable to the downtown area. We would love to stay again if we are visiting Seattle.
6797786,41966025,2015-08-10,35269856,Johnie  Le,"7night at this place , felt great , i thought there will be not enough blanket and towels , but after told jared , he prepared enough towels and blanket and pillows . A+ home stay"
6797786,42630001,2015-08-14,41047741,Chris,"Our stay at this house was our first experience with AirBnB and it was a good one.  We will be back to both the house and the service.  The home is exactly as advertised, in a quiet residential neighborhood but convenient to both downtown as well as some of the more entertaining neighborhoods north of the locks.  The hosts have taken a relatively modest mid-century home, added a bit of pizzazz, ensured comfort and security and otherwise provided a very positive experience from the initial reservation through check-in until check-out.  We were very pleased.  "
6797786,44658125,2015-08-28,36572184,紫晴,"The house is good, every place in the house is clean, facility is good, host is very nice, he help me many time."
6797786,45012769,2015-08-30,22968489,Marie Elena,This was a great house. Loved the 70's vibe. It was clean and comfortable. I had one of my best nights of sleep there. It was very easy to get into downtown Seattle and it was in a nice neighborhood. We only used the kitchen for drinking water so I can't speak to its usability but there were some staples available that we were welcome to use if needed.  I would stay again. 
5981343,32874354,2015-05-22,76741,Andy,"Naima went out of her way to make me feel right at home. It was a great experience staying at her flat. It's location is truly excellent. It was a wonderful place to wake up, and stumble into the early-morning version of Pike Place (too many delicious things to eat, great coffee, great cafes, etc). And at night, the roof-top patio was fabulous. During the day, this was a great location for me to swing by as needed from my downtown activities. I was actually there on business, while my colleagues stayed at the Marriott, and I have not regrets. I'd love to go back to Naima's next time. Cheers"
5981343,33183937,2015-05-25,23466566,Star,"Wonderful view. Good location: close to Pike Market, 3-minute walk to water front. Also walking distance to monorail station for Seattle Center. Convenient & quiet."
5981343,34507500,2015-06-08,8754184,Mao,Best hostess ever! Naima was super accomodating and let me check in when I arrived early morning.  She went out of her way to create a list of things to do since it was my first time in Seattle and also trusted her cat to stay with me while she was away for the weekend.  Her place was exactly the way she described it and the perfect location right next door to Pike's Market with an amazing view of the Great Wheel.  Walking distance to all the best restaurants and attactions.  I highly recommend her place.  I hope it'll be available again on my next trip to Seattle.   
5981343,34756250,2015-06-11,34876089,Jon,1st time ever using Airbnb and if this is normal than I'm all about it :-).  Naima was very prompt in getting me anything and everything I needed.  I was there on Business and everything was downtown so the location was AWESOME!  Wish I could have spent a little more time there as the area is the best but I was out and about with customers the whole time.  Regardless Naima made sure I even had a good sleep which was really nice.  Gold member at too many hotels to list and this was a way different and great experience.
5981343,35012067,2015-06-14,33144872,Tim,This was a great location especially if you are a tourist- Pike place market is a 3-minute walk. The apartment was clean and just as pictured. The host was friendly easily accessible and kept I touch just make sure we had everything we needed.I would stay here again.
5981343,35166710,2015-06-15,12847044,DaBee,"Wonderful location, Cozy house for staying in Seattle!!"
5981343,35348438,2015-06-17,11995152,Lorena,"Sweet like condo in a fantastic location. We only stayed one night, but we would stay here again. We didn't get to meet Naima, but she was readily available by phone and text. The door code entry system is a little confusing but we got it all worked out and everything was great."
5981343,35499091,2015-06-19,22168122,Mark,Naima was very nice and went out of her way to make sure the key was there for my late arrival.  The apartment is very comfortable and within walking distance to everywhere I needed to be and it's practically in Pike's Place Market.  I would stay there again - it's a great apartment.
5981343,35702749,2015-06-21,12762383,Krista,The location can't be beat! Super close to Pike's Place and the Waterfront; walking distance to Seattle Center and Safeco Fields. Naima is very attentive and even gives suggestions on things to do. Her place is very clean and can easily accommodate 2-3 people.
5981343,36128591,2015-06-25,573210,Jason,"Naima and her place are are awesome. Communication with Naima was a breeze. She was responsive, polite, and flexible with our arrangements to stay. Her place is perfectly located with easy access to Pikes and other downtown favorites.  The condo itself is cozy and very comfortable. I have a bad neck and often times travel with a contour pillow for support. I forgot to bring my pillow this time around, but I was pleasantly surprised that she had one of her own!  This was my second Air BnB experience in Seattle and I will definitely love to stay at Naima's place again. You can't go wrong here. Book now!"
5981343,36425075,2015-06-28,34882187,Patty,"Absolutely loved Naima's place! She was so responsive and very welcoming. Instructions to get in were easy to follow and clear. Her place was also very clean - very important to me! By the end of the trip, my friends and I wanted to be real friends with her - cool paintings and very cozy home (: 

Can't forget about the view - it can't get any better than this place! I woke up to a sunrise of the pier and the ferris wheel. Super convenient location! Can't say enough good things about Naima's place - this one is a winner. "
5981343,37269361,2015-07-05,10586283,Liz,"We had a wonderful time at Naima's place! The apartment is clean, comfortable, and in the best location. You can't beat the rooftop deck, it was great to be out there during the summer night. Naima is the perfect host, we never had any problems getting in contact with her, and she was able to help us with everything we asked. We even had an incident in the house, which I felt terrible about, but Naima was great! She was very understanding, and did her best to problem solve. Overall, this is a great place to stay and an even better host!"
5981343,37770764,2015-07-10,13386386,Wendy,"The location of this apartment is unbeatable! We walked everywhere - Pike Place Market is literally out the back door and the view is very nice. Public transportation is readily available to all areas of the city. Our teenager was comfortable sleeping in the living room. Naima is a great hostess - she is attentive, responsive, and everything was exactly as advertised. We all agree that Naima's place will be our #1 choice for a return visit to Seattle."
5981343,38159781,2015-07-13,35332314,Jared,Great location! Naima was very helpful and always available!
5981343,39304267,2015-07-22,34401214,Kathy,"Wonderful location, nice apartment. Naima was very accommodating with our earlier than expected arrival and helpful with suggestions on places to visit. Pike Place Market is right out the back and up Post Alley. It is close to the freeway so you do hear the highway noise but it really didn't make a difference in our satisfaction of the location, the place and hostess. Highly recommended! Also loved that we bought fresh fish, pasta, vegetables, fruit and bread and prepared it there - we get tired of eating out. "
5981343,39555931,2015-07-24,957394,James,"Great place and great location. Lots of fun! 

Thank you Naima. "
5981343,39781788,2015-07-26,8641688,Pam,"Naimi's apartment was absolutely perfect for our stay. It is located next to the Pike's Place Market and a 15 minute walk to the stadium. The apartment was clean, comfortable and safe. 

We would stay here again in a heartbeat and would recommend it to anyone who wants to be located downtown with quick access to the market, restaurants and other attractions. 

Thanks again Naima!"
5981343,40159159,2015-07-28,29759952,Julia,"Naima has a beautiful, clean apartment in a great area of Seattle. Less than a 5 minute walk to Pike Place market. 
Naima was very easy to communicate with - in terms of any questions regarding her home or suggestions for seattle sights. 
Would definitely recommend using Naima if you visit seattle!!!"
5981343,41166175,2015-08-04,4143229,Brent,I was passing thru Seattle and needed a place just for one night. Naima's place was perfect. The location is ideal if you're looking to see all the sights Seattle has to offer.  The bed was comfortable and the place was clean. The rooftop deck was nice as well and had a great view. Naima was very accommodating and made sure everything was right for our stay. She was very easy to communicate with and check-in was easy. I would definitely stay there again next time I'm in town.
5981343,42285797,2015-08-12,37240647,Thomasin,"Very welcome, greeted us with a lovely note, stocked refrigerator and fresh flowers, all above and beyond our expectations, even a little toy for our baby girl! "
5981343,42479914,2015-08-13,40783607,Kim,"Naima was a great host, giving us ideas of what to see and where to eat!   Her place has a perfect location with beautiful views from her balcony and the rooftop lounging area.  It was easy to walk to all the places we wanted to see while in Seattle.  I hope to stay here again when I come back to visit Seattle.  "
5981343,42915155,2015-08-16,5783460,Shailaja,It was such a pleasant experience staying at Naima's apartment. Naima is such a warm and welcoming person and extremely generous. The apartment had everything that we needed. All details were taken care of. It's so close to everything which made it very convenient. We will definitely consider this place again on our next visit! Thanks Naima!
5981343,43315124,2015-08-18,25473103,Deborah,Naima was a wonderful host. She was very accommodating and her place was beautiful! She always checked up to see if there was anything else we needed or to see if everything was okay. She really takes the time to make sure her guests are comfortable. It was a wonderful stay and would definitely recommend to people who are looking for a nice place to stay that is very conveniently located near pike place. 
5981343,43975655,2015-08-23,16882806,Joanna,Naima's place was absolutely perfect for our stay! It was so close to pike's place and the waterfront so we were able to walk everywhere. I really liked that we were able to park our car safely in a garage and didn't have to worry about it at all. Naima was extremely accommodating and super friendly. If I ever come back to Seattle I would love to stay here again!!
5981343,45273641,2015-09-01,26077149,Lisa,"We stayed here while in town for PAX, and Naima's home is beautiful, lovely and very comfortable! Check in was really easy and there was lots of helpful notes around with extra information where needed. It's handily within walking distance of the convention center, so was great to wander back to and relax after a grueling day of booth-work. Would stay again!"
5981343,45689835,2015-09-05,34953564,Jason,"What a great location!  A quick and easy walk to Pike Place Market - perfect for our needs.  Naima was great at communicating and made every effort to make sure our stay was as pleasant as possible.  The apartment was clean and had everything we required.  We had a rental car, so having free parking nearby was a HUGE plus!  There is a freeway nearby, but the noise wasn't too bad and got to the point where we didn't even notice it.  The trade-off for the location's convenience more than made up for it.  We would definitely consider staying here again!"
5981343,46308670,2015-09-09,10277700,Jason,"Perfect location, great view over the water, very comfortable, clean and tidy, fast & free wifi. Excellent communication from Naima. All the towels you could ever need! Definitely recommend!"
5981343,46569298,2015-09-11,6290399,Mike,Naima allowed us to book last minutes and was extremely flexible and responsive.  Her apartment is in a great location and is really cozy.  I would definitely stay here again.
5981343,46744453,2015-09-13,40803232,Michael,Our stay here was great! The location is close to many Seattle sights and the ferry terminal. The condo was well equipped and had many helpful signs around the place. Naima was very responsive to any questions we had. I would recommend this place!
5981343,48157654,2015-09-23,661952,Steve,"Host was fantastic - 5 star.  Very welcoming, explained everything easily

Apartment was spacious, bright, and large.  

Location was ideal, downtown so easy access to everything.

Only downside - bedroom had a little too much light coming in from outside at night, so you should bring an eyemask unless you are a deep sleeper, and right now there is a lot of construction in this part of downtown as well (although you do not hear the traffic noise from the bedroom because it is placed far from the street side of the apartment)"
5981343,48540527,2015-09-27,25578215,Rachel,Lovely apartment with an ideal location right next to Pike Place Market.  Would definitely stay here again!
5981343,48958500,2015-09-29,3160504,Grace,"The location of this apartment is amazing. This cannot be understated. If you're headed to downtown Seattle, this is the place. The apartment itself is very nice. Well appointed kitchen and Naima has a LOT of little extras lurking throughout (mobile phone chargers, soap, snacks, etc.). The place was clean and cozy. I will be coming back here again, can't really give a strong endorsement than that!!"
5981343,49133650,2015-10-01,30856611,Sally,"The apartment was in an excellent location, near many popular sites. The rooftop deck provided a view of the harbor.  Communications with Naima were good."
5981343,49503781,2015-10-04,6792386,Cassandra,"Great place!  Super clean, great views, wonderful location.  Naima went out of her way to accommodate us, she's a great host and I would definitely recommend her place."
5981343,49725643,2015-10-05,3179610,Dwayne,"Naima made sure everything was taken care of and getting into the apartment and getting parked was straightforward. The apartment is in a great location near the waterfront and Pike Place Market. The rooftop patio is a great place to watch a sunset, and the apartment is well appointed. It's a great place to experience Seattle from!  "
5981343,49856363,2015-10-06,24869820,James,Everything was perfect.  Naima was very accommodating and the apartment was well organized and clean.  I would definitely stay here again!
5981343,49918078,2015-10-07,12010744,Stella,"Nice home, fantastic location!"
5981343,52179721,2015-10-26,47060331,Dave,"Naima was  great.  We added a day to our original booking and she got it changed for us online when we couldn't figure it out.  She communicated with us very promptly, made sure everything was ok and even sent us a list of things to be sure to do and see close by.  The location is excellent, we parked the car and never needed it.  From the apartment you can walk in 5 minutes to the Wheel at the waterfront (that you can see from the balcony, window or roof of apartment) or 2 minutes out the back door, past the gum wall  and you are in the middle of Pike Place Market- watching them toss fish.  The Apartment was clean, neat and stocked with basics that you might need.   We would absolutely do this again."
5981343,53237059,2015-11-06,48248450,Silvana,"The place was clean and well decorated. She gave clear instructions that were easy to follow and checked in later that evening to make sure everything was going great. She had a full mini bar that I fell in love with :) I had issues finding the parking garage even though she had sent me a map, but besides that it was a great experience and the view from her 
place was amazing!"
5981343,53446645,2015-11-08,13242190,Amber,Great apartment. So close to everything. Ultimate convenience. Thank you for a great rest- we will be back.
5981343,54653977,2015-11-22,43177056,Bethany,"Naima's place was perfect for us! It was clean, and comfortable, and the condo was easy to find and perfect location! She was so helpful in getting us in, and finding parking. We would definitely stay here again! "
5981343,55252284,2015-11-29,12565585,Thatcher,Great place. Close to everything. Comfy bed. 
5981343,55874424,2015-12-06,24171533,Tess,"The apartment was great! It has one bedroom, and then one couch is a pullout and there is a mattress in the living room. We fit 6 people comfortably.  "
5981343,56287465,2015-12-11,18839703,Christine,"I am SO GLAD we stayed at Naima's apt!  I mean....it's in the perfect location!!  Literally right by the Pike Place Market....you can walk everywhere.  Her instructions to get into the unit was easy....getting to/from the parking garage was easy.  Everything was easy breezy.  

The unit was comfortable and very clean.  Great view from the balcony.  She left plenty of towels and toiletries.  Kitchen was clean and had everything you could possibly need.  There's a washer/dryer if you need it.  The rooftop deck looking out at the Sound and the view of the Wheel was AMAZING!  

Construction on the main road so it was a little noisy but the bedroom is on the other side facing the courtyard so once you close the door, it's quieter.  I need complete silence to sleep and I had no issues at all.  My only problem was the lighting from the courtyard came through the blinds and I struggled a tad with that. ..but I need total darkness so I just used an eyemask.  

If/When we go back to Seattle and we want to stay downtown....I will for sure book Naima's unit again.  You really won't go wrong with this one.  She's super responsive too!  We're picky.....and we would stay here again.    :)"
5981343,56468104,2015-12-13,51171934,Tyloosier,She was very helpful and accommodating. Highly recommended 
5981343,57162779,2015-12-22,4089501,Sangwoo,"Naima was a great host. She was very responsive and recommended amazing places to visit and restaurants to my family (1St time Seattle visitors). The location was awesome. Its literally near everything. If you dont wanna drive, then uber will cost you about 5 to 8 bucks to all the major locations nearby. I definitely recommend this place to any first time Seattle visitors. "
5981343,57568914,2015-12-27,5125089,Jule,"Our host was an excellent communicator.  She responded quickly to our emails and provided detailed instructions for accessing the apartment and parking space.  The place itself was extremely clean and comfortable, and the location was do die for.  We wouldn't hesitate to go back -- preferably when the weather improves!"
5981343,57738893,2015-12-28,15114475,Mark,"Very pleasant well-appointed cozy apartment next to Pike Place Market with view of Seattle Ferris Wheel. Parking in garage half block away was a nice amenity. Easy walking distance to all of downtown activities. All communication with Naima was electronic, but she was very easy to contact, and was responsive to all our needs! Great location for a weekend getaway in Seattle!"
7151107,39823100,2015-07-26,37778927,Laura,"What a beautiful home in a delightful neighborhood!  We were very pleased with the rental; it was immaculately clean and very well equipped.  We were able to walk to restaurants and grocery stores, run to Green Lake park, and it was a quick inexpensive Uber to get down to Pike's Place.  Hannah was very responsive, always answering emails within 10-20 minutes.  Great experience."
7151107,42096819,2015-08-10,10721452,Ken,"Hannah was an excellent host and made us feel very welcome, especially considering we were a very last-minute reservation.  She was extremely responsive to our inquiries and requests.

The house was beautiful and we had a great time!"
7151107,44027137,2015-08-23,5260984,Drushti,"Hannah was an incredible host! She was very responsive, kind, and genuine. She made our experience great and the whole process was super easy. She even left us a welcome gift AND sent an extremely thorough email about logistics and nearby recommendations for everything. Hannah was very accommodating and communication was very easy. She's a very friendly person! 
The house is amazing in every way - we had 6 guests stay and every person loved it. It was comfortable, equipped, and beautiful. The area was safe and friendly, its about 15 minutes from the Space Needle (North Downtown Seattle). 
I have only great things to say about Hannah and this accommodation. I would highly recommend this to anyone!  "
7151107,46057141,2015-09-07,32133189,Tangerine,"Hannah was an amazing host and her home is absolutely beautiful! The entire home was spotless and exactly as described. The photos are extremely accurate and we were very comfortable during our stay! Hanna went above and beyond as a host and made us feel extremely welcome from the moment we walked in the door.

Not only is the home beautiful, but it is situated in a great neighborhood with several restaurants and cafes within walking distance. Hannah also gave us great recommendations for places to go site seeing throughout the city as well.

We couldn't have asked for a better experience and host! We feel so lucky that Hannah was willing to open up her home to us. Highly recommended!! We would definitely stay here again and again:)"

Everything was provided for a clean and comfortable stay . The large veranda looks out on a green area. Location is close enough to downtown Seattle but in a quiet residential neighborhood.
West Seattle has Alki beach and Seattle Chinese Garden nearby.
Marcell is a kind and gracious host 

"
3993960,19761933,2014-09-17,21304027,Nikki,"The most gracious hosts ever! Warm and very hospitable. Marcell and Judy are an easygoing couple who are both fun to talk with. They were available to help when needed, but did not hover unnecessarily - the perfect hosts for my husband and I. About the space itself: refreshing, homey, and has personality; you know it was put together by an artist, which we really liked. Also, the internet connection was excellent, which was crucial to us, being that we needed it for work.
Bonus: It was pretty cool that the home is right by an entrance of the West Duwamish hiking trail. "
3993960,19894346,2014-09-20,20811071,Guy,"The listing of the description was very accurate. I spent a lot of time downtown for business so I can't really comment too much on the neighborhood. That being said Marcelle did a great job of making me feel at home and answering all my questions--how to get downtown, places to eat, etc. And then he gave me the privacy to relax and enjoy the room. I stayed in a remarkably clean place and there were even nice little touches like organic granola and cereal left in the kitchen for me. I would DEFINITELY stay here again. "
3993960,20444125,2014-09-29,731365,Yvette,"Everything in the listing was very accurate. Great residential neighborhood, and fantastic space with a separate private entry. Very close to the nearby beaches with great views of the infamous Seattle skyline!

Marcell was the absolute BEST host anyone can ask for. Very easy to communicate with, and accommodated our 10pm late arrival with no problem. Would not hesitate to stay at his place if I happen to be in Seattle again, as long as he would have me!"
3993960,20634478,2014-10-02,2722652,David,Marcell was a welcoming and friendly host; he showed me around when I arrived and then left me alone to get settled.
3993960,20842759,2014-10-06,9350983,Robbie,"We had a great stay at Marcell's rental. Plenty of amenities and plenty of privacy. We didn't have any problems during our stay. It was a good location because it was out of downtown Seattle where it was nice and quiet (and quiet at night, which we appreciate). It was close to the airport and close to downtown so we appreciated that. Then again, we had a rental car, so we can't give any input on public transportation from Marcell's pad. Marcell was very helpful and made sure we had everything we needed. True to the description, there were two types of granola/cereal and almond milk and soy milk. This totally saved us on our first morning there. Thanks for the great stay Marcell!"
3993960,21517696,2014-10-19,12138871,Alexandria,staying at marcells  place was great for us. the house was comfy and had everything we needed. marcell gave us tips of places nearby to check out and left us our space when we wanted it. the house is close to some stores and a coffee shop and a park. we walked or rode the bus everywhere while we stayed here. this is a great pick if you're looking for somewhere low maintenance and quiet to stay in west seattle. 
3993960,21790121,2014-10-24,4847519,Mandy,"I had a great 5 night stay at Green on the Green. Marcell was easy to communicate with, available when needed, but I had complete privacy.
The space was exactly as described and the bed was super comfy. I would definitely stay there again! 
"
3993960,22241056,2014-11-02,21499308,Cindy,"The place is exactly like how the pictures are. I had a great time at Marcell's place, he's a cool friendly guy. Gave us a tour and overview of his place. His place gave a homey feel and it had everything you needed such as shampoo, soap, towels, cereal, almond milk, kitchenware, heater, DVD player, everything. Enjoyed the private balcony overlooking the trees. The location is also very close to seattle downtown, only 10 minutes away which was very convenient. I would stay here again next time I'm in seattle."
3993960,22593555,2014-11-10,15393098,Michael,"My gf and I had an amazing time at Marcell's place. His place is very welcoming, and we especially liked the comfy bed and private balcony. The neighborhood is exactly what we wanted...quiet, cute residential area, that is a short bus ride away from downtown Seattle and any other place you would want to visit. Marcell himself is a great host, nice, accommodating, and a pleasure to talk to. Next time I'm in the area I will for sure stay at his place! "
3993960,23302681,2014-11-28,23480821,Paula,Marcell was a very gracious host I would highly recommend his apartment. Very clean and private deck out back. Very close to my daughters house so it work very well for us.
3993960,25681073,2015-01-23,4847519,Mandy,"Marcell and his lady Judy go above and beyond! This is my second time staying here. My stay was for three weeks for work. The place is clean, comfortable, and I slept like a baby. It's filled with all the essentials you need and I felt right at home. It's in a great location in West Seattle and conveniently just off the West Seattle bridge. Marcell was just a text away but I had complete privacy.  They are so warm and friendly while staying very professional. They have it all dialed in! I'll be back for sure! "
3993960,26035731,2015-02-01,23674158,Gary,Marcell met me when I arrived and showed me around the apartment.  The place is quite comfortable and the kitchen is equipped to cook for and feed a family of twelve.   The wireless is great.   
3993960,27175393,2015-02-27,4847519,Mandy,Another fabulous stay with Marcell and Judy! They have it down to a science and operate like a well oiled machine. I always feel so welcome and they're just a call away. I love that I have complete privacy and the space is super clean. I definitely recommend staying here! 
3993960,27839047,2015-03-13,11428863,Jim,"I needed a place to stay for a couple of weeks while I looked for an apartment after moving to Seattle from the east coast. The location was perfect for me since I needed quick access to downtown for work.

Marcell was incredibly accommodating and made sure I had everything I needed for my extended stay. I had to leave a day earlier than I had planned due to scheduling conflicts with movers and he refunded me within a day after I checked out. 

The house itself felt very cozy. Excellent view from the balcony. Very comfortable bed. I couldn't have asked for more. I would definitely recommend Marcell's place to anyone."
3993960,28352109,2015-03-22,20232125,Vivian,I was pleased with marcell and his apartment. It was clean and perfect for two people. Everything was provided to us and I was comfortable staying there. I would definitely come back if I am ever in seattle. 
3993960,28608590,2015-03-27,4847519,Mandy,"I love staying here! Always clean, comfortable and just perfect! "
3993960,29830478,2015-04-13,27952603,Tim,We stayed 2 days and.nights in Marcells house. Marcell is very helpful and friendly. He gave us tips about seattle. The house was tidy up and very clean. We felt like at home. All in all it was very great and we can recommended it.
3993960,30888135,2015-04-28,19813161,Rebecca,"Marcell was a wonderful host and made sure we had everything we needed in the house. The house was beautiful, clean, comfortable, and private - it was everything I could want in an airbnb rental. It was one of the best experiences I've had with airbnb and I would highly recommend. Thank you, Marcell!"
3993960,53611304,2015-11-10,9410971,Marion,"Marcel was right in the driveway as soon as we drove up.  (His immediate pre-trip email response to my questions/driving directions were 'bang on' & made it easy to find his location for someone not familiar with the Seattle area to 'rest easy').  The upper suite was awesome for my girlfriend and I, an easy commute downhill to my training location.  Even though I had done research beforehand, Marcel was exceptionally helpful in locating/giving clear directions to great shopping, walking areas in West Seattle.  My girlfriend enjoyed shopping & walking in the West Seattle areas, as well as enjoying just 'chilling' in the comfortable suite, while I attended my training days.  I would definitely recommend this quiet getaway location to others seeking a close vicinity to, but not in downtown Seattle. "
3626162,18327417,2014-08-25,14118370,Katie,"Elizabeth's pad was quaint and cozy. They are so close to everything we needed: grocery stores, pharmacies, parks, restaurants, and even bars. A couple days, we ventured a mile to Green lake and mighty-o donuts (right next to Tangletown brewery). The price at this location is great! Also, we have a 1 year-old and Elizabeth graciously let us borrow a pack n play crib, toys, VHS tapes, and a high chair. It was such a relaxing trip. We will definitely book again. Thanks! "
3626162,18947347,2014-09-03,18555870,Mike,"Awesome place, very quiet, welcoming hosts, would rate 6 if we could. 

Will definitely try to book this again next time we are in town!"
3626162,19282196,2014-09-09,2772327,Nick,"Elizabeth was a great host for my friend and I.  The basement apartment was roomy and comfortable and didn't fail to meet it's description.  We had a great trip and really appreciated having a well outfitted place to stay in a great neighborhood!  The VHS player and VHS movies were a fun trip down memory lane, too!  Scan lines!  Good DVD collection too."
3626162,19604324,2014-09-15,19066779,Michelle,"We had an absolutely wonderful time staying at this property.  Everything was exactly as pictured and we felt that Elizabeth went out of her way to make our stay as comfortable as possible.  The location was also amazing and close to all of the major attractions and the neighborhood is immensely walkable with great dining/shopping locations throughout.

If we are lucky enough to get back to Seattle again, we wouldn't hesitate to book this location again!"
3626162,22035160,2014-10-28,5894986,Brian,"The apartment was exactly as described. Clean, quiet and in a great neighborhood. Elizabeth was a great host. We would have liked to spend more time with her, but, life is busy. Maybe next time?"
3626162,22791743,2014-11-15,5989503,Kathleen R,"The Apartment was clean, spacious and well supplied for some one on vacation.  There were many games, books and videos for the guests to use.  It is very convenient to buses and restaurants and is on a quiet residential street."
3626162,22991123,2014-11-19,2607672,Piyush,The house was great and felt like home. Elizabeth was really sweet host and had set up the house for us. The house is as described accurately and would recommend the home to all seattle travelers. Good location as it is near to downtown too. 
3626162,23379874,2014-11-30,12671237,Jane,"The neighborhood is a family neighborhood, safe and friendly. Elizabeth  is helpful and warm.  The apartment is clean, and the bathroom has a Pegasus sink!"
3626162,25316049,2015-01-12,15945137,Dave,"Elizabeth's place is excellent!

I recently relocated to Seattle and decided to use AirBnB to spend a couple months living in different neighborhoods while looking for a permanent place.

The apartment is exactly as described and the pictures are very accurate. It is a very comfortable and warm feeling place. It felt like coming home after a long day at work. The kitchen is wonderful, it is fully furnished and has a gas stove. I was able to easily make christmas dinner for my girlfriend and I. It comes with nice quality pots and pans and everything you need as a cook. There is also access to a washer & dryer which was very nice.

Elizabeth says she prefers longer-term renter. It's a perfect place for a professional in town temporarily, say a guest lecturer at UW or someone relocating to Seattle for work.

She was very upfront about the fact that she has two small children and the noise from upstairs might be excessive. It honestly was not that bad and didn't start until midmorning. As someone who is an early riser this never was an issue.  

I would highly recommend a stay here!"
3626162,25398481,2015-01-14,15945137,Dave,"Since I extended my stay I guess I get two reviews. Since I already commented on how wonderful the apartment was. I'll mention the neighborhood.

It's in a very easy to navigate walkable neighborhood. Grocery store is maybe four blocks away. Forty-fifth street is a little more than a block and is a long stretch of a walkable street with many very good restaurants. There's an Afghani place that's great and a number of Japanese noodle bowl places that are also very good. Uptown Espresso is less than two blocks away and makes great espresso (I only drink espresso so I can't vouch for the lattes.)

About six or eight blocks south you are at Gas Works Park on the Northern side of Lake Union. Also it's only about a twenty minute walk to Downtown Fremont (maybe 30 depending on your pace).

Bus access is very good with dependable routes within just a few blocks in all directions."
3626162,26098176,2015-02-03,8657275,Ramona,We felt very comfortable with our stay with Elizabeth! It was a perfect setting and we appreciated the parking availability. The rooms were comfortable and clean.  We appreciate the concerns for recycle in the kitchen! 
3626162,26464940,2015-02-13,24600723,Michael,"The basement is warm and clean, we felt very comfortable in home and out on the quite street. Elizabeth is hospitable and generous. Since we extended our stay and the next guest is going to check in, which made us going to be homeless. Then Elizabeth let us living in their room for two more nights  and lend us a lot of things to let us begin our new life in Seattle."
3626162,27276226,2015-03-01,20380367,Sara,Elizabeth's place was perfect for my needs.  Close to my new grandbaby!  On-street parking and laundry were plusses.  I manages to lose my key plus lock myself out - both of which Elizabeth and her husband remedied without complaint.  I would/will stay here again.
3626162,28878008,2015-03-31,27643429,Phyllis,"I came to Seattle for a much-needed rest and truly found it at Wallingford Haven.  The apartment is spacious, cosy and warm, fully furnished with everything one could possibly need for an enjoyable stay. Elizabeth and her family were very friendly yet gave me all the privacy I needed.  I love this place and will come again often!  "
3626162,30947594,2015-04-29,29663670,Fahad,"My Stay at Elizabeths place was excellent. The place is spacious, clean, cozy, well furnished and just as advertised. It is a quite neighborhood but easily accessible to downtown. My folks visited me from India and they spent the first few days here, Elizabeth and family were really friendly and made my family feel at home during there first few days in US. I would definitely stay at this place again"
3626162,31984707,2015-05-12,26405720,Xiaoyi,Elizabeth一家人真是非常好，非常友善的一家人，她家地理位置各方面都非常舒服。我像回到自己家一样。
3626162,32699679,2015-05-20,31515618,Steve,"Elizabeth was very friendly and welcoming and the place was as described. It's in a great neighbourhood and our 17 month old son loved all the toys that were in the yard and in the place. We were able to walk to parks and the zoo and there were plenty of restaurants nearby. If you have kids, this is a great place to stay."
3626162,33921910,2015-06-02,11131187,Jeff,"Cozy, clean apartment in a wonderful walk-able location close to shops, restaurants and grocery store. Elizabeth and husband were a delightful hosts with two charming children. Very private space as our base to explore Seattle. Full kitchen was a plus."
3626162,34323427,2015-06-07,890682,Debra,"The little house is adorable. Great neighborhood--walking distance from good bars and restaurants. Really well-appointed. Very clean. The kitchen has everything you need. Elizabeth and her family are delightful. Sure, the kids run around a bit in the morning--but it's no worse than any apartment where you have an upstairs neighbor. I'd definitely stay here again!"
3626162,34778059,2015-06-12,25139617,Gary,Our stay at the Wallington Haven was terrific.  Everything was as described in the listing.  We met Elizabeth upon arrival and she made us feel welcome.  We had no issues or problems during our stay.  Thanks Elizabeth.
3626162,35455375,2015-06-19,7812183,Kevin,We had a great stay!  Wonderful place in a wonderful neighborhood.  Elizabeth and family are very friendly and welcoming.  We'd love to go  back for another stay!
3626162,35661549,2015-06-21,3178735,Chris,"My family wished we had more than a few days to spend at Elizabeth's comfy apartment. The place is as described; between the great book and game selection, the full kitchen, the comfy furniture, and the great restaurants nearby, it was the perfect haven for us."
3626162,36115844,2015-06-25,2027223,James R,"After several telephone calls with Host, we felt comfortable renting apartment. Our arrival was after midnight which darkness created a different problem. We had a little trouble finding address, but nice neighbor helped us locate apartment. Once inside everything was found as described. Host had informed us She would be out of town until our last day,and we would meet up then. Rooms were large with full kitchen, nice living room , and bedroom in the back. Bathroom was spacious with plenty of room. We met Host and her family on 3rd day. Was invited to dinner but had to graciously refuse as we had plans for the evening. We had a nice visit with our Nephew and his family and even attended  Seattle vs Kansas City Baseball Game. This Apartment provided us with the perfect location to see the City of Seattle and Visit with our Nephew. "
3626162,36690110,2015-06-30,17012626,Jenny,"Absolutely loved this apartment! I stayed there for three nights with my parents, and they couldn't stop raving about what a great place (and deal!) it was.

Key points:
+ very spacious, comfortable, and homey, with everything you could possibly need
+ close to the university area, but in a quieter residential neighborhood
+ nice and cool—no A/C necessary, even when the temperature was over 90º
+ although I didn't get a chance to meet Elizabeth in person, it was easy to communicate with her, and she was flexible in accommodating our late-night arrival
+ much cheaper than hotels in the downtown area

Overall, a wonderful stay. We would definitely look into staying here again if we're in Seattle in the future!"
3626162,41308757,2015-08-07,26454510,Pernilla,"Elizabeth and her lovely family was very welcoming and  made our stay to a wonderful time. We stayed for almost six weeks and had a great time. The description of the house was perfect, and it was clean and comfortable. We liked the opportunity to have a full kitchen. The location was perfect for us: walking distance to University of Washington, to Gas Works Park and to Green lake, and easy to take the bus to downtown, to the Monorail or the Ferries. It was also easy to park on the street. The garden was great for our children to play in and for us to relax in. We would like to stay here again! "
3626162,43068312,2015-08-17,37083442,Priyanka,"Elizabeth's private apartment was spacious and homey. We loved staying in her apartment, and her family was very welcoming! She left plenty of guidebooks and information around that made our stay in Seattle perfect. Thanks, Elizabeth! Hopefully, we'll get to stay at your place again in the future!"
3626162,43573297,2015-08-20,5027607,Britten,"We were greeted upon arrival by Elizabeth and her darling children, who showed us around the space and gave tips for enjoying the neighborhood. This was a great apartment, with everything we needed and in an ideal location- easy to get to everywhere we wanted to go. We mostly used it as home base while we explored Seattle, so were gone most of the days. The apartment is very homey and full of personal touches- tons of books, movies, games. The weather was quite warm while we were there, but since it's a bottom floor apartment it stayed nice and cool and we got a great breeze through the open windows. The bed was unbelievably comfortable."
3626162,45372585,2015-09-02,21999734,Tyson,This was a great place for my friends and I to stay. It was much larger then the photos made it seem. Elizabeth wad very friendly and helpful with all the questions we had. Location worked out really great by being able to walk to both food and public transportation. I would definitely stay here again.
3626162,47694518,2015-09-21,2686485,Sibu,"The Wallingford haven was a tremendous place to stay. I recommend it without any hesitation!!

I was in town with two colleagues for a conference at UWashington, which is a relaxing 20 minute walk from Elizabeth's place. The house was a perfect place to relax, with comfortable beds, nice sofas, a full kitchen, a nice shower, lots of books to read, etc. It was big enough for a small family, which meant it was much larger than we needed, but we enjoyed it! I couldn't say enough good things about the place. It's exactly as described, and more. 

Planning to stay here again when I come back to Seattle!"
3626162,50671314,2015-10-13,43576682,Zheng,"The room is very big and clean, with two cozy queen-size beds which can actually easily host 4 people. Many many tools in the kitchen, no need to worry, because anything needed can be found. Elizabeth made the guest area kind of separated from their living area, which provides privacy. Wallingford is a quiet but amazing neighborhood - 2 minutes walk to Domino's, 5 minutes to QFC, Drugstore, Japanese restaurant, Dick's drive-in and so much more. Bus 44 goes directly into UW campus, even if it's only about 25 minutes walk. "
3626162,51338036,2015-10-19,8104622,Nicole,"My family so enjoyed staying at Elizabeth's place in Wallingford. As per a few of the other reviews here, the space is actually much larger than it appears in pictures. With five of us hanging out during the day, we had plenty of space and were amply comfortable. The kitchen was well-stocked with pots & pans & everything else for making meals. My husband and I slept well in the cozy private bedroom, and our son slept great out in the shared living space. Hot showers. Lots of natural light. Easy access to wifi in the house. A number of great VHS tapes to watch. :) We had a wonderful time. Thanks so much, Elizabeth. This is a great spot for our family. We will be back! "
3626162,54506237,2015-11-21,16467685,Seth,"Elizabeth's apartment suite was lovely. The bed is very comfortable and the pictures don't do the space justice. It really opens up when you step in. Natural light does get in plentiful as well, as it is a walkout basement. Convenient to many restaurants and activities on 45th. I recommend Westward just down Sunnyside toward the Lake. Great spot for dinner and drinks. Would stay here again, lovely home!"
3626162,58138366,2016-01-01,46885504,형선,"Elizabeth is awsome host and her husband and childs are kind. She trys to accomodate us and respects our privacy. I and my boyfriend stayed more than a month. In the house, there is everything you need such as plate, spoons and coffee and tea. We had a great time staying this beautiful house. I think this house is the best house near this neighborhood. Thank you for your hosting."
6337492,32633184,2015-05-19,31976658,John,"We were in Seattle for the weekend to participate in my great friends wedding and Katelynn's apartment made everything that much more special. Thank you Katelynn for hosting us in your home. We had a great experience, private apartment, walking distance to everything (including my friend's wedding location!), cozy and comfortable. Katelynn was great to work with and communicated everything clearly and timely. She is kind and thoughtful (The ""In case you forgot something!"" Assortment of extra toothpaste, shampoo toothbrushes etc was a great touch!), we really appreciate and enjoyed our stay. "
6337492,32937526,2015-05-23,33518590,Erin,"A great little apartment that fit the needs of my stay perfectly. Had an excellent overnight stay, and the host was readily available over email to answer any questions we had. "
6337492,33036911,2015-05-24,10537511,Trish,"Katelynn was a great host. Very helpful and quick at answering questions. The space was clean and quiet. We love the Ballard area and her place was in a very convenient location to walk to stores, restaurants and the farmer's market! Also a short drive to University Village, Downtown, Capital Hill etc. Thanks Katelynn!"
6337492,33198865,2015-05-25,31948175,Grace And Franck,"Katelynn was very responsive via Airbnb and text with our last minute reservation for Memorial Day weekend. Being that it was last minute we were back to back with a previous reservation and there wasn't time for her to do an inspection or cleanup after the previous airbnbers, so it wasn't a spick-and-span kind of arrangement. Sheets and towels were in the dryer so they were cleaned already, we just had to put them on the bed ourselves. The place was tidy, although visibly not entirely clean being that someone had just stayed there the night before. The neighborhood feels safe and cozy and in walking distance to the very entertaining Ballard streets and parking was a breeze. Since we were the last to stay in the apartment, we did our best to tidy things that may have been left behind by others before us that we didn't use, like cleaned laundry. It's a great neighborhood and place to stay, although we would have preferred it a bit cleaner and better prepared before our arrival, but for the length of time and short notice it was great for the price. "
6337492,50188203,2015-10-10,42552199,Sepand,She was very communicative.  Everything was set up just as she said and It was a great experience. 
6908161,38313722,2015-07-14,19841690,Leslie,"This was my first experience with Airbnb and it was perfect. Sasha was kind and very welcoming and accommodating. She is a great host. Her home was lovely, comfortable, and clean. The neighborhood was great! The home is in walking distance of shopping, restaurants, coffee shops, etc. I would recommend this Airbnb to anyone and I would stay here again."
6908161,39579060,2015-07-24,39076744,Erin,"We had a wonderful stay in Sasha's apartment. We were 4 adults, and used both bedrooms and the pullout couch. Everyone was very comfortable. The space is quite large and full of natural light. The kitchen has all the utensils you need and we prepared several meals there. The neighborhood is really fun, with many shops and restaurants just a few blocks away. We would definitely stay again."
6908161,39961306,2015-07-27,28373229,Paul,"Great character house in a wonderfully vibrant part of Seattle. The house was in immaculate shape and Sasha leaves some nice complimentary foods and bathroom goodies to make it feel like home from home. I took the sofa bed, and I'm pleased to say it was super comfy! "
6908161,40649669,2015-08-01,19351352,Anthony,"Sasha waited up for me and my friend despite the fact that we arrived at a rather late ~10:30pm.  She showed us around the place when we got there and was very prompt and reachable by messages throughout the trip. 

The place was very spacious and very nice to stay at.  The beds were comfortable and having access to both laundry and a parking space was extremely nice to have.  The neighborhood itself was residential and quiet but it is just a short walk from some nice bars and restaurants in Capitol Hill which was very nice to have access too."
6908161,41619308,2015-08-08,15491651,Sterling,Very friendly and accommodating! Loved the extra attention!
6908161,42864623,2015-08-16,18023793,Jenna,"The apartment, the neighborhood, everything was perfect!  We would stay here again without a doubt! "
6908161,43816636,2015-08-22,37043849,Kim,Sasha's house was exactly what we needed. I would stay here again!
6908161,45390633,2015-09-02,8276071,Lisy,"Sasha greeted us upon arrival and her home was very comfortable. The area was really close to shops, restaurants and bars! All the things you need."
6908161,46720860,2015-09-13,12431945,Linda,"We had a very nice stay at Sacha's apartment on Capitol Hill. The neighborhood is beautiful and very walkable.  The apartment is just as advertised, and the hostess was very accommodating.  We found everything we needed and look forward to staying there again."
299817,5727151,2013-07-14,5403155,Ann,"This house was adequate for our needs which were a base (from the UK) to spend time with our son and his family who live nearby. 
From the description given of the property it is obviously a much loved family home so we find it hard to criticise it. We do feel   though that their description is a little generous and biased and we would not probably have described it as they have.
It is relatively inexpensive, in a nice area,  no problem with street parking and Anna was very pleasant and friendly in all of our dealings with her. "
299817,6420049,2013-08-12,1778365,Erika,"Great little house on the back side of Cap Hill! Perfect amount of space for an extended stay for my little one & myself (and then my husband later in the trip). We stayed there for about 3 weeks & were wishing we could have stayed the entire summer. Anna was very accommodating with any questions / requests & even delivered a box of the most beautiful organic produce I've ever seen! Great place, cool kinda quirky/arty decor, softest quilt on the master bed I've ever slept under & great location with easy access to everything! Make sure to check out the beautiful hand painted Peter Rabbit bed. Adorable! Thanks Anna, for a wonderful stay in your lovely wee house 3"

2297917,10415049,2014-02-17,9808694,Alec,"This place was really beautiful, in a good part of town. I really love the neiborhood. It was super easy to get to and close by great restaurants and shops. The apartment was very clean and relaxing. My girlfriend loved the built in daybed right next to the fireplace. And with the rain coming down outside, I couldn't have asked for a more cozy place. The updated bathroom wth jacuzzi tub was super nice, too. And Donna was a wonderful host, accomodating us last minute. Thank you, Donna. We'll definitely be staying with you again. "
2297917,10706742,2014-03-03,2050268,Christine,"The place is warm, inviting, clean and beautifully designed. Has Great lights, windows, fun art, and is pretty darn peaceful. Lots of folliage and trails nearby, and the neighborhood is pretty and safe. Plan on staying there again :)) 
PS I forgot to mention the great bathroom and tub..."
2297917,11069035,2014-03-18,6501231,Lois,"Donna's place was just what I was looking for: charming, cozy, and private. I felt immediately at home. Beautifully decorated, comfortable furnished.   Though I had various plans for much my stay. I would have happily just spent all of my time in the apartment.Took a long walk on my last morning in Carkeek Park. It was just beautiful. A perfect ending to my private retreat."
2297917,12198123,2014-04-25,14060128,Christin,"Great place! Nice, comfortable and private! Would stay again!!"

2297917,13727219,2014-06-02,1212520,Jeremy And Rachael,"Donna was a kind, communicative, and helpful host.  The retreat is colorful, artistic, spacious, light-filled, has wonderful radiant floors, a gas fireplace with reading nook, and is very quiet.  Overall, it's a fantastic space for 1-2 travelers!
  
A few thoughts that might help you make a decision about staying here:
--Great comfortable space. Quiet, and still close to Seattle and Ballard.  Having a car will be helpful.
--There was no stove or oven; Donna says one is being installed soon.
--There was quite a bit of dust. The place was by no means dirty (we had clean sheets, towels, etc.)  just more dusty than expected.
--The bed is full sized and is fairly soft/springy.  My wife and I rolled into each other/the middle throughout the night.
--There are no blinds curtains and thus, a lot of light comes-in early in the morning.  

Overall, it's a GREAT SPACE and once there is an oven/stove, and maybe a larger, newer bed, we'd be back and would recommend our out of town guests stay here.  Thanks Donna!"
2297917,14134480,2014-06-12,12702974,Dave,"My experience here was amazing! Donna is super nice and meeting up to get the key was easy. The neighborhood is very nice with the park right next to the house. Ballard (the best neighborhood in Seattle) is just a couple minutes down the hill. The apartment has a nice queen bed and a very nice jetted tub. The kitchen has a full fridge, oven stove and is great for making meals. "
2297917,14176832,2014-06-13,16639227,Phoebe,"I had a very nice experience at the Carkeek Retreat. The apartment was so beautiful and cute, very well maintained, cleaned and supplied. Looks exactly as it does in pictures, if not better! Donna was very quick to respond to my request and quick to set up despite my last minute travel plans, which was very much appreciated. I can't wait to stay again!"
2297917,14395723,2014-06-18,14816861,Polly,Liked the neighborhood. 
2297917,14847816,2014-06-27,15132151,Zhenpeng,The place is awesome! My wife and I had a really great time there! :D
2297917,15639692,2014-07-13,438422,Karen,"Donna was welcoming and kind, she is also an amazing artist, designer and architect. The apartment was warm and inviting, the beds comfy, the wifi fast and the bathroom heavenly. Just a few steps away is one of the most amazing parks I have ever seen, teeming with flora and fauna.  Everything you need is there, 5 short blocks away is Briarwood? Ave, a convenient  thoroughfare to downtown, Fremont and an easy busline. We had a great time, made a great friend and would highly recommend this beautiful person and apartment."
2297917,15788527,2014-07-15,14363614,Abbey,"A really clean and comfortable place where we could smell the ocean! Everything is new and the photos are spot on. A kitchen with all the required gadgets and a lovely shower, what more could you ask for?"
2297917,15842047,2014-07-16,9041639,Hannah,"Beautiful space! Bright and clean, and was easy to find. Carkeek park is gorgeous. Thanks again Donna! "
2297917,16305133,2014-07-25,16602246,Balz,"My wife and myself stayed there with our two kids (4-years and 4 month's old). Donna (as informed beforehand) wasn't there when we arrived. Everything was very well organized and we felt at home from the very first second. This flat is really cozy and we suddenly fell in love with it. Donna is a really nice person. She's around when you need here and she leaves you as well on your own.
Super flat with children too!!
Location is only 30' from downtown and nice to relax in a quiet environment after a long day in town.
"
2297917,16589113,2014-07-29,10573354,Asheya,"Carkeek Retreat was a restful, beautiful space. The bathroom is gorgeous! The two beds easily accommodated myself, my partner and his parents for our one night stay. We appreciated the kitchen and being able to cook in the morning. Donna was great, and we appreciated her letting us stay a bit later in the morning. Definitely recommend this place!"
2297917,16637808,2014-07-30,8993560,Salman,"Donna was very quick to help and made us feel very welcome in her wonderful home. We were very comfortable, and had everything we needed to cook and have a restful stay. The way the house is designed and decorated is beautiful. If we come back to Seattle, this is where we will be staying!"
2297917,17193582,2014-08-08,19587847,Stephanie,Would really recommend this place! It's cozy charm and awesome jetted bathtub made it hard to leave. It's close to a grocery store which is nice if you want to stay at home and cook. And there is a stove top in the kitchen. It's a nice neighborhood too. 
2297917,17230778,2014-08-09,18259105,Crystal,"We showed up pretty late at night due to dinner reservations and travel. We loved the space. It was absolutely perfect for the four of us. The home was clean, and very well stocked. There was anything you could need and more. We did not see Donna, though I would not say that is a bad thing. It was very private and a great quiet place to spend the night. "
2297917,17442782,2014-08-12,16785318,John And Jane,"Donna is a very friendly and welcoming host.   Her 'Carkeek Retreat' in Seattle is clean and comfortable.  She has designed it with lots of well placed windows to maximize natural light.   As a result, it is very bright throughout the house.  It is located in a quiet neighborhood.  From the Carkeek Retreat, you can walk less than five minutes and be on a trail in the beautiful Carkeek Park on your way to the Puget Sound -- or -- you can walk less than five minutes to public transportation to get around in Seattle.  We highly recommend Donna's Carkeek Retreat to anyone visiting Seattle and we hope to stay there again in the future.   "
2297917,17543591,2014-08-13,8013961,Chris,Donna's retreat was a very comfortable and carefully designed and finished space.  It is spacious and a very nice space to be in.  Donna was very flexible and responsive while making arrangements.  The internet is fast and reliable and the bed is very comfortable.  I highly recommend this space. 
2297917,18267059,2014-08-24,17742586,Changsu,"The Donna's house where I stayed is really perfect place. It was my first trip to Seattle with my fiancé. We definitely satisfied the place because it was filled with valuable things such as beautiful work of art, decoration, and so on. Host, Donna is very warm and kind person to us. She kept our private time while we were enjoying her house. Thank you so much Donna! I want to stay your place again in nearly future.
"
2297917,19303090,2014-09-09,20946911,Soren,"This was the first time I have used AirBnB - and it was a great experience. Renting the Carkeek Retreat for my dad (who was visiting from Germany) was easy, and Donna was extremely helpful. The place is beautiful and the location is great: you can easily walk down to one of Seattle's most beautiful parks."
2297917,20048558,2014-09-22,19525775,Natalie,"A quiet cozy retreat with extra touches like warm bathroom tiles, beautiful windows, books, and puzzles. This was a great place to come back to spend the evening relaxing. I enjoyed the trail through the woods to the ocean to watch the sunset. Donna was a gracious host -"
2297917,20442810,2014-09-29,6336023,James,"Donna's place exceeded expectations. The place has it's own place to park, which in Seattle is a real luxury. The bathroom was amazing with a  shower/tub/jacuzzi and heated floor. While we didn't use the kitchen except for coffee it had all the amenities. There was plenty of closet space to hang up clothes which is rare. And the wifi connection worked better than in any hotel I've stayed previously. You know it is a great place if the only complaint is the tiny bathroom sink! 
Most importantly for us, it was private. While Donna offered to give us any help and offered to suggest things to do, once we checked in we were left on our own.  Though the apartment is connected to the house, I was pleased and surprised that I didn't heard any noise from them except when they were outside. I admit that we were in Seattle in early fall, so I can't speak to the heating system but we were able to open windows and get wonderful cross breezes without the rain coming in. 
The location is perfect for us as we have a son who lives in Ballard, so this was more convenient and certainly nicer than any hotels we have stayed in the past. And Ballard has lots to offer - great restaurants and parks to name two - so you don't have to spend your time in downtown Seattle.
I definitely will choose her place next time I visit! It really was great!"
2297917,20773666,2014-10-05,21428691,Anne,"Donna made me most welcome. She just popped in for a few minutes, welcomed me, and showed me how everything worked, and then left me alone to enjoy my stay, which is exactly how I wanted it to be. This 'home away from home' was very comfortable. The bed was great, there were full kitchen facilities and the neighbourhood was quiet. The Jacuzzi style deep bath tub was amazing...great for tired driving muscles. After I checked out in the morning, I went for a great ramble in Carkeek park, just a few blocks down the hill. I would totally recommend this place.
"
2297917,21326424,2014-10-14,22353352,Martin,"Donna was a great host and everything was perfect.  All the pictures and previous reviews are accurate and we were very satisfied with our stay.  We decided to continue the tradition of leaving a beer in the fridge for the next guests.

Thanks for being such a great host, we had a great time exploring Seattle."
2297917,27094858,2015-02-25,2315832,Abbie,"What a beautiful, serene home away from home Donna provides at the Carkeek Retreat! We stayed with Donna for a month while we were househunting after relocating to Seattle for a new job. The space was just as pictured, and everything we needed. Donna is a kind and friendly host who will respond quickly to any question and give you all your privacy. On the night we arrived, worn out from our move, she even brought us a pot of soup from the batch she had just made!  

The location is splendid for walking (the Carkeek Park trails entry is at the end of the street! you can walk to the grocery store through the wooded park!), biking, busing, and for driving around town. The reserved off-street parking space is a big bonus. 

Note that none of the windows have curtains, and the door to the bathroom is glass with privacy film on the center 1/3, so you may feel a bit ""exposed"" when you first get there. The space is arranged, however, to give you total privacy in terms of who can see in (we quickly adapted). The Retreat is light-filled, quiet and very restful.

Our own laundry machines were another bonus, and also the espresso machine and the high-end electric coffee grinder. You have everything in the kitchen you need (unless you need a dishwasher, which of course we didn't). Donna obviously put a lot of intelligence into the design of this space, as well as an artistic sense that offers her guests a heightened comfort. Ask her about her gardens! She is doing some really fun things there.

In our first week we had problems with the wi-fi dropping connections, but Donna provided us a key to the closet where the router lives (which she deliberately placed in a closet with an external door for her guests) so that we could reset it if needed. The wi-fi settled down, and was strong and reliable for the rest of our stay.

Many thanks to Donna for providing such a haven for our migration to Seattle!"
2297917,37220881,2015-07-05,74659,Juan And Kathy,"We had a lovely time at the Carkeek Retreat.  It was exactly as described, and overall was very bright and comfortable.  It was easy to check in and out.  The location was great, as we were visiting family in Phinney Ridge.  It is very quiet in the area and we slept soundly with the windows open each night.  We would highly recommend."
2297917,40729156,2015-08-02,22829367,Татьяна,"Целый месяц я с двумя внуками проживала в Сиэтле у Донны. Это был прекрасный месяц. Апартаменты полностью совпадают с фото. Рядом с домом находится прекрасный парк, и мы ежедневно гуляли в нем с детьми. Донна - прекрасная доброжелательная хозяйка, которая старается сделать дом уютным, а пребывание в нем комфортным. Я была тронута ее заботой обо мне и моих внуках. 
Нас очень устраивало месторасположение дома. Улица тихая, спокойная, на ней мало движущихся машин. Мы арендовали машину и было место для ее парковки.
Донна, нам очень понравилось гостить у вас. Большое вам спасибо. "
2297917,41016447,2015-08-03,30997894,Kendal,Carkeek retreat was a wonderful place to stay. We were spending the night in Seattle and we couldn't have asked for a better place. The home was in a great location within 10 minutes from all of our destinations. All of the rooms were clean and it was exactly (if not better than) what we expected from the pictures. 
2297917,41952551,2015-08-10,34117771,Bob,Donna was there to greet the car pulling up. The space was as described. Nice details. 
2297917,42332248,2015-08-12,13739651,Luke,"Thanks to Donna for letting us stay at your lovely place!  Everything was clean and bright and cozy just as advertised.  Instructions were clear, and we had a marvellous time.  We would definitely stay again!"
2297917,42744026,2015-08-15,20673132,Emily,"What a joy to visit Donna's lovely retreat.  The space is even more beautiful than in the photos, comfortable, welcoming with beautiful art.  The architecture was delightful, incorporating natural light while maintaining privacy in each room.  In the morning, we could smell the ocean and the breeze was incredible.  We found the drive into downtown convenient and uncomplicated.  The nearby park offers walking trails and beach (this home is the last residential street before the park).  Donna was there when we had questions or we wouldn't have known she was there.  She was kind and well versed in the Seattle culture, offering detailed information about what was featured at the Seattle Art Museum and many local attractions.  I wanted to book for the following week to extend but she is already booked... for obvious reasons.  I would stay again without hesitation and I am a bit of an OCD germaphobe... clean, tidy space, great books, nice shower/giant tub, comfortable beds and an Organic market very nearby with a wonderful deli.  I highly recommend this space.
"
2297917,43055317,2015-08-17,21936588,Parker,"The retreat is incredibly cozy and warm. The bright colors are a delight, and the location is wonderfully peaceful.  We were so delighted with our stay and Donna's hospitality."
2297917,44406271,2015-08-26,30555957,Chael,"We spent a week in Seattle visiting family and the location of Donna's house allowed us to have our own space yet have great access to everyone.  The house worked perfectly for us and the proximity to Carkeek Park was a double bonus.  Donna is super nice, and was available if we needed her.   

The house is great for families -- our daughter (5) had plenty of things to do, and when we need to run around the playground at Carkeek was only 5 minutes away."
