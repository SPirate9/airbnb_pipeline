The location was awesome too-madrona has cute restaurants and peaceful walking area. Lisa was very welcoming and understanding to our guests and thoughtful!  Price was great too!"
2584354,36683571,2015-06-30,32266380,Connie,"Great place! Close to everything, very clean and tidy. Would definitely recommend Lisa!"
2584354,37778156,2015-07-10,13111038,Jimmy,"Great place , well located , Lisa was away but made it very simple to get in and the apartment is very cozy.Thanks Lisa for the stay!"
2584354,41764875,2015-08-09,7900524,Sarah,"Such a great experience. The house is adorable, comfortable and homey. The house was clean and immaculate. It was perfect for our family! There's a TV with computer hook ups, washing machine, and full kitchen. We felt truly at home. "
2584354,43500337,2015-08-20,33123838,Michelle,"Lisa has a beautiful cozy apartment 9 minutes away from downtown Seattle.  It was a great location that felt safe, and had easy parking.  "
2584354,44121199,2015-08-24,34237614,Katie,Lisa communicated well in advance to make us feel welcome.  We found the home in a nice quiet neighborhood with easy driving access to many areas of Seattle.  The home was indeed cozy and comfortable -- just right for us.  We slept well and were able to prepare a few meals in the kitchen.  Thank you Lisa!
2584354,44915387,2015-08-30,8518700,Sue,"Lisa's place is cozy, clean, spacious and well equipped. It met our expectation.  The tomato plants outside was an extra touch.

The space was decorated so well and every need was thought of. It was a wonderful escape at the end of our travels each day and felt like spa retreat with nice linens and high end finishes throughout. Though we didn't find ourselves having much time for tv, we like the convenience of having it available should we have felt inclined to watch something. We're so grateful to have stayed with Misty and hope we can stay with her again. "
9110730,53549585,2015-11-09,26173210,Katalin,"The place is exactly as it's described and Misty provided us with all sorts of information, also helped if we had questions. It was a great experience. :)"
9110730,53863430,2015-11-13,48540661,Natalee,"Our experience was amazing. The suite was exactly as advertised.  The tub  was decadent, and the bed was incredibly comfortable.  Everything was clean and tidy.  Misty was available if needed, but we were left alone to our own devices.  I hope to return in the future. Two enthusiastic thumbs up!"
9110730,54453236,2015-11-20,20336537,Marshall,"We absolutely loved the space! The claw foot tub is a great touch.  The shower fixtures were great too. Super clean and comfortable. The pictures don't show that there is another room that is essentially a walk in closet, where you can put your luggage and hang your clothes and coats, which kept things organized and out of the way. Location is a great jumping off point for the whole area, but far away enough for peace and quiet at night. Misty texted us with a welcome and address as soon as our plane landed and was available to answer questions.  Perfect private space; modern, clean and comfortable.  We would stay again in a heartbeat.  Thanks again!"
9110730,56788185,2015-12-18,48012223,Stephanie,"What a delightful stay.  I came from Denver to Seattle in early October and had a long commute from my brother's house while our house was being finalized in mid December.  I realized I needed to stay in Seattle to be closer to work before our move.  I am very lucky that I found Misty's place as it was absolutely perfect.  Charming, cozy, super clean, comfy and spacious.  Plus the location is terrific within a safe and quiet neighborhood that is close to great little shops and dining options.  

I stayed for almost 3 weeks, at her place, while my husband was in Denver packing up things for his trek to Seattle to meet up with me.  It was hard being away from him however having such a nice place to come home to after work made it much better.  

I would highly recommend this location to visitors or people looking to move to Seattle.  The location is also simple to find  and an easy drive to downtown and near other hot spots within the Emerald City.  

Misty has wonderful taste in her décor and some nice amenities to her little getaway including: tranquil bedroom that is spacious, big closet, gorgeous bathroom with claw foot tub, warm and cheerful living/den area with Keurig, mini fridge, microwave and washer dryer.  

Her place is awesome as is Misty.  A wonderful hostess.

3562617,19147896,2014-09-07,19187515,Joe,"Jennifer was a warm and welcoming host. The room was very convenient to where I was going in Seattle. The room faces the street, but I had no difficulties with noise disturbing my sleep. Thank you Jennifer!!!"
3562617,19835585,2014-09-19,20554743,Greg,"Jennifer was very friendly and accommodating.  The room was small with a bed and side tables only, but I had use of a closet area and most of the apartment and kitchen. The lower Queen Anne location right near City Center was key for me.  A great deal for the price. There was traffic noise during the day, earplugs or closing the window worked fine; noise was minimal during sleep hours. I was able to eat most breakfast and lunch there and I'm sure a hotel and most meals out would have been 3 times what I spent. Jennifer and I didn't see each other much once she met me at my check-in.  I found her very communicative and responsive. "
3562617,19955486,2014-09-21,17150790,Rachel,"Jennifer and I were not actually able to meet during my 2 night stay, but she  had the key hidden outside for me to access on the first night. 

The neighborhood was great walking distance to the Space Needle and the artistic venues in the area. I stayed very little in the apartment other than sleeping. The bathroom and shower were smaller than I expected, but just enough to do what you need. Everything was kept tidy and organized. "
3562617,20351084,2014-09-28,284775,Mike,"Jen was a great host.  We did not see her much, but there was great communication before and during our stay.
The apartment was cosy, and what an awesome location.  We walked all over the City.  Parking was also excellent; we found a place within a block on two days. 
The view is great too. "
3562617,20868522,2014-10-06,21790564,Ricky,"It was our first visit in Seattle. Jennifer was an amazing host. She's very accommodating and was in constant communication with us since our application was approved by her. Her place is cozy with a great view of the Space Needle. I sat in the living room and stared at that awesome structure every night we were there. The bedroom is just the right size for two people. It's close to Kerry Park and very accessible by bus. Jennifer was easy to talk to and really spent time talking to us about the city and her personal experience living in lovely (email hidden)xt time my girlfriend and I are in town, we surely will stay at Ms. Jennifer Moore's place. :)"
3562617,21450112,2014-10-17,21448260,Stacie,"Jennifer was great, and her apartment was in a great location. But if you don't like the smell of incense it may be too much for you and parking can be somewhat difficult for it is all parallel parking. We had to park blocks away due to the immense amount of cars. Be sure to read the signs about where you can can't park or else you'll be towed. She provided us with tea and even a little tolietrity basket in case we forgot something. We didn't see her the two days we stayed because we out and about enjoying and exploring Seattle but I'm sure she's a lovely person. Would def reccomend her and staying with her. "
3562617,21542471,2014-10-19,11637950,Sarah,"Jennifer was great. The house was as expected, it's an apartment with two rooms. There is a breathtaking view of the city and the Puget Sound from her dining room table. The neighborhood is great, the apartment is up from an area with shops, restaurants, the Key Arena, and walking distance to the Space Needle. Jennifer was easy to get in touch with, and when my boyfriend left his tablet at her house, she sent it the next day through FedEx to us. "
3562617,21733960,2014-10-22,21872256,Josh,"Easy going host, simple accommodation, comfy bed and generous common area. It was like staying at a friend's place. "
3562617,22035058,2014-10-28,6071511,Holly,"The place looks just like the pictures! Yes, the view is that amazing. Such a great location. Easy to walk or bus anywhere. Jennifer was great and made us feel right at home. "
3562617,22538652,2014-11-09,14115954,Bonnie,"This place is very close to space needle. About 15-20 minutes walking to Seattle Center. Commute is a bit inconvenient as monorail is a bit far. Taking bus is a better choice. Apt condition is ok. But with the price under $100, what can you ask for?"
3562617,23075405,2014-11-22,6761946,Corinna,"Jennifer has a very warm and welcoming home environment! All of her instruments inspired me to start playing something! 

It's very close to the space needle. And has a cozy space heater for a cold rainy day. "
3562617,23450085,2014-12-01,15988061,Gao,Very convenient location for anyone who wants to explore Space Needle or Chihuly museum. Very friendly host.
3562617,23604702,2014-12-06,23790233,Jason,"We were in town for a wedding, and we were lucky enough to find Jennifer's listing only 2 blocks away from the event, which was perfect.   Jennifer was very polite and the apartment very tidy (we were in and out for the wedding, so we didn't get a chance to talk much).  However, the apartment smelled very, very heavily of musky incense...so if that bothers you I would find a different spot.  Finding parking can be an adventure, but that's Seattle overall.  Would recommend with some cautions for the guests (see below).

Pros:
- Polite host
- Jennifer provided toiletries in case you were out/forgot something
- Clean and tidy apartment
- Great view/location
- Lots of instruments! I wished I had enough time to jam a bit with the host.

Cons:
- There were two pillows on the bed, but one was some sort of odd meditation pillow with a hole in it...so only one pillow for two guests?
- The incense smell.  There was no way to purify the air in our room, and it was so strong it gave one of us a headache. There is nothing in the listing that mentions this, so be wary.
- Sheets wouldn't stay on the bed (even after we got up and remade the whole thing twice)...but the bed itself was pretty comfy."
3562617,25406439,2015-01-15,22722650,Doug,"I stayed at Jennifer's place for almost two weeks. She was very welcoming and the location couldn't be better (as well as the view of the Space Needle and the Puget Sound). There is a bus stop literally right outside of the apartment, and several other ones that take you all over the city not too far away. All in all, a great experience!"
3562617,26766629,2015-02-18,27189889,Kepa,"Bed and room was clean and placed away past common area, so it was really quiet. I mostly didn't see the host because of the very early hours I kept due to work. This was no problem because communication with Jennifer via text was easy and what I needed was placed out for me ahead of time. When I did see the host I got some really nice tea! Neighborhood was a 6 minute walk, downhill, to Seattle Center. I recommend the listing, it was everything I wanted."
3562617,27478913,2015-03-05,28317989,Stephen,"Very friendly, home comfortable, tidy, clean etc."
3562617,28286507,2015-03-21,29412798,Brandon,"This was my first Airbnb experience, and Jennifer made me feel more than welcome. I was visiting Seattle on a whirlwind two day trip to watch my team play in the NCAA tournament being held at Key Arena. Jennifer's apartment is extremely close to Seattle Center, with the Space Needle, EMP Museum and Union Lake all easily within walking distance.

Jennifer was very flexible with my late evening arrival from the airport, and other than the initial meeting, our schedules didn't cross for the rest of my visit.

The room itself is on the smaller side, but comfortable. The views of the Space Needle and Puget Sound are just as the photographs show. The bed I believe was a double, so while I fit comfortably, putting a second adult in might be a little tight.

Overall, I had a great experience and would definitely stay again if I find the excuse to visit Seattle again."
3562617,28781197,2015-03-30,26020316,Laura,"Jennifer was a good host - she is very kind, checked in with us frequently, and responded quickly to messages. We didn't cross paths much but when we did she was very calm and friendly. The apartment is really lovely and we had everything we needed. Thanks for letting us stay!"
3562617,29141242,2015-04-04,30075802,Francois,"The flat is really nice and charming and the location in Queen Anne is lovely, full of nice bars and restaurants. Plus it's just a few blocks away from downtown.

Jennifer was a great host, helped me to find her place, went for a drink with me and always checked if everything was OK. She kept saying ""spread out"", so I would feel comfortable using the whole flat. Best Airbnb Experience so far. Will definitely contact her again when I come back to Seattle.

Thank you Jennifer for the great experience! 
"
3562617,29819821,2015-04-13,6999534,Daniel,"Jennifer was very kind and welcoming and made sure I had what I needed. She even made me tea when I arrived! Her place is in a great location, close to the Seattle Center and right across the street from a bus stop. I like this neighborhood because it has great eating and grocery options, and is quiet and relaxing. Oh, and the view of both the Space Needle and Puget Sound from the room is fantastic!"
3562617,30251706,2015-04-19,787630,Hillary,"Jennifer was a great host, she made me feel very welcome in her spacious and central Seattle apartment with gorgeous views of the water. Her listing was spot on and the neighborhood was within walking distance from the EMP museum, where I was headed for a conference, as well as bunches of restaurants, bars and a grocery store, if you’d rather grab food in less expensive way.

If you’re in Seattle and need a place to stay, Jennifer’s place is a perfect option. Also, if you’re a bit of a hippie, she’s got all the accouterment for that lifestyle as well so I felt right at home next to the Jimi Hendrix poster and her carton of stevia. =) "
3562617,32528926,2015-05-19,30792115,Theo,"We hebben Jennifer 2 keer gezien en verder per telefoon gesproken. Slaapkamer vonden we wat te klein voor 2 volwassenen met 2 koffers. Keuken was niet zoals we gedacht hadden en hebben we dan ook niet gebruikt, behalve dan voor koffie en thee. Afstand tov centrum is te lopen, maar kan ook met de bus. Parkeren is lastig maar we vonden een gratis parkeerplek een blok achter Jennifer. Voor ons zal het bij een keer blijven."
3562617,32897852,2015-05-23,102367,Susan,"I never actually met Jennifer, but her communication and availability by phone was excellent. The apartment was basic, and airy with lots of windows. The location of the airy apartment was great for visiting the Seattle Center where I was headed. Buses were very convenient from downtown, dropping me off in front of the apartment. "
3562617,34123205,2015-06-05,29631811,Esteniolla,"I had a lovely time at Jennifer's place in Queen Anne.  It was not high-end (and I did not care for that), but it was comfortable and clean. Jennifer was a relaxed and warm host to me throughout my stay and was easy to reach via phone. I had my own room with a towel, shampoo & conditioner and the kitchen had pots and pans out for me to use. My favorite part about this space is its convenient location. During my stay, I did not have to travel far (never more than half an hour walking and much less driving or by bus; the number 13 bus stop is right in front of the apartment) to go to the Queen Anne Farmers Market on Thursdays, Pike Place Market, the Space Needle and pathways along the water that led to Sculpture Park and downtown Seattle. If you do not like walking up or down steep hills, this may not be the place for you. The apartment is located on the hill. However, I found the walk enjoyable and it was always a good pre-workout to the Seattle Gym (a ten-minute walk uphill before the Trader Joes) where I received a free week-long membership as part of the gym's deal to new customers. So, if you are only staying a week, you can go to the gym or attend scheduled workouts (spinning, Zumba, core work, etc) for free! In all, I highly recommend Jennifer's apartment to other people interested in staying in the Queen Anne area."
3562617,34463591,2015-06-08,33047581,Courtney,Host was very amiable and greeted us right at the bus stop in front of her place. The bedroom window had the view of the space needle just like she mentioned but the floors in the bedroom were kind of dusty. My only suggestion would be to leave a broom so the guest can sweep inside of their bedroom. This would also save you time by not having to clean as much. Thanks overall for the stay! It was exactly how you described it!
3562617,34780812,2015-06-12,29326634,Maria,Jennifer was very friendly and accommodating. The neighborhood was very close to a main bus station and not far from the downtown area. the apartment has a nice view of the space needle. She gave accurate instructions for how to find and get into the apartment.
3562617,37611568,2015-07-08,2612919,Blake,"Very laid back apartment, full use of kitchen. Full size bed. Shared bathroom but didn't feel full, includes towels. Jennifer is accommodating to your needs. Great location near supermarket, public transport, and restaurants. Also close to bike share station and shoreline which made it easy to get downtown.  Not fancy but very comfortable. "
1772119,9477098,2013-12-30,10455370,Naoto,"Our stay at Melissa’s and Abil’s was amazing. Not only because of the location but mostly because of their amazing hosting-skills. The two women are very interesting to get to know and I can recommend anyone to go there and enjoy their lively and unique personalities.

Their house is in a secure and calm neighborhood yet close enough to downtown to walk the distance if wanted. Busses run downtown as well. Restaurants and bars are close by. Their house has a bunch of beautifully furnished rooms. Additionally they offer 2 community “lounges” and a nice dining room. All very clean and very pretty.

The reception was very warm. From the first moment on we felt welcomed in the house and the 2 hosts are very lovely. They gave very well-researched recommendations of where to eat, go out and what to visit (in fact they told us they tried out lots of places around their house in order to give good recommendations). We could address every question we had to them and they tried to make everything possible for us to have a pleasant stay.

They made us self-made muffins (Melissa is a chef) and some fruit along with coffee for breakfast (complimentary) and when we didn’t know how to get to the Boeing-factory in Everett they helped us out by asking a friend to drive us there. We were so surprised to see how much they care about their guests. 

Over the stay there was amazing and we were sad that we had to leave after 2 nights. If we ever come back to Seattle, we for sure know where we want to stay."
1772119,9776552,2014-01-09,10700704,Derrick,"I loved my extended stay with Melissa and Abil in their cozy home. I was plugged right into the heart of Seattle, with great suggestions every day for things to do, places to see, and food to eat. Every night I'd sleep in a comfy bed and every morning I woke up to a plate of fresh fruit, a delicious home-baked treat, and fresh-brewed coffee. They are both amazing people that are fun to hang around with and attract cool, interesting people -- important for me, since I was here for work and have few friends in Seattle. In short, I cannot recommend this place highly enough...you will just have to check it out for yourself to believe me!"
1772119,9958361,2014-01-21,10948226,Judianne,"My stay with Melissa and Abil was better than expected.  Their home is warm and comfortable and very clean with lovely charming furnishings in a sweet Seattle neighborhood.  They know their city well and are able to guide the visitor to key eateries, museums, events and transportation.  All my needs were more than met:  yummy breakfasts (Melissa made a special effort to get  my favorite tea), lovely room and bathroom (nice clawfoot tub), engaging conversation.  There are two sitting rooms and a dining room for visiting or resting and other larger bedrooms if you have a big group and want to lodge together.
Melissa and Abil are delightful caring hosts and I would highly recommend staying with them.
 "
1772119,10662010,2014-03-02,11787256,Donna,"Oh my god, I can’t say enough about Melissa’s Bed, Bath and Baked Goods! It was truly like home away from home, only better, since I didn’t have to do any of the work to make it perfectly comfortable—well, more than comfortable. Melissa and Abil were like family (without any of the family history) while we were there for 17 days. Every morning we awakened to delicious coffee, fresh fruit and a surprise breakfast baked good—each day, a new flavor! Melissa and Abil were both friendly and very respectful of our privacy, offering help and recommendations whenever requested. And their information about the area was invaluable.  
Staying in the cozy loft with a shared bathroom, we found the bed comfortable and the room tiny but totally able to accommodate our belongings for a 17-day stay. The b&b has 2 hangout rooms, a parlor, where we did our morning yoga routines every day, and a sitting room, so the compactness of the loft room was no hamper to our comfort. 
I would recommend Melissa’s Bed, Bath and Baked Goods to anyone visiting Seattle.
 
"
1772119,11375122,2014-03-31,5952632,Deborah,"A delight of my trip to Seattle was staying in this amazingly beautiful, pristinely restored Victorian just minutes from downtown. The front parlor was as lovely and inviting as my hosts with whom I shared breakfasts and dinner on Saturday evening.  Melissa was very accommodating to my dietary needs and baked delicious muffins served with fresh fruit.  I would definitely stay here again!"
1772119,11552513,2014-04-07,5244395,Crystal,"I had a more than wonderful time staying with Melissa and Abil at their beyond adorable bed & breakfast!  Melissa provides fresh baked pastries and a fruit plate every morning--it was fantastic!  I was moving to Seattle for a new job and stayed with them for a week before I transitioned to my permanent residence.  During which Melissa and Abil were super friendly hosts. Breakfast aside, they did their own thing, and you did your's, but they were always available to chat or answer questions. They were very knowledgeable about the Seattle area and provided a lot of very useful information.  I really enjoyed my stay here and could not have wished for a better introduction to Seattle! :D"
1772119,12319935,2014-04-28,2904576,Gregory,"Melissa and Abil run the most fantastic, cozy bnb. They put just as much care into their tastefully renovated and decorated 1903 home as they do into hosting their guests. Every morning I was treated to a plate of fresh fruit, home made pastries (from a professional chef, no less!) and as much coffee as I could drink. Their recommendations for places to eat, drink and sight see around the neighborhood lived up to the standard, and they were loads of fun to spend time with. Easily my best AirBnb experience so far.

This place is a true gem!"
1772119,12474618,2014-05-03,14350140,Jean,"It took us a couple of days to start writing this review, because we just didn't know where to begin. We got an awesome warm reception from our hostesses Melissa and Abil, starting with a refreshing beer (we'd had a long drive back from hiking on the Olympic Peninsula) and a fun tour of the guesthouse. Then we sat out on the lawn in the back, met the cat, and admired the work done on the house and garden. Our loft bed was comfortable in a nicely decorated room, and everything in the house is super clean. Breakfast, fruit plate and homemade muffins, was delicious. Abil and Melissa gave us lots of useful information and recommendations for our stay in Seattle. On our second evening, we joined our hostesses and some of their friends for an amazing dessert -- Melissa's cooking and Abil's beer expertise in tandem. After another wonderful breakfast it was time for us to tear ourselves away and continue our WA state experience at Mt. Rainier, but it was hard to leave. We could have stayed for weeks and enjoyed the easy living, intelligent conversation and just plain fun. Thank you again, and we hope you can visit us in Belgium!"
1772119,12637943,2014-05-06,6201562,Helene,"My stay with Melissa and Abil was simply wonderful. The Loft room was small but perfect for one person, I could work on my laptop on the little desk, no problem. The place was immaculate, the house is so charming. But most importantly, Melissa and Abil were perfect hosts, we had wonderful conversations, they gave me great recommendations. Their breakfasts were lovely. Centrally located with easy access to public transportation. I will definitely be staying again with them on my next trip to Seattle! It's a haven! "
1772119,13087191,2014-05-19,14077302,Joel,"Excellent experience staying with Abil and Melissa! 

The house itself is brilliant - a 1903 that has been immaculately done up. The room itself is as depicted and very, very comfortable. The common areas - my word - those are totally kick-ass. The reading room and parlor are both really plush and I spent quite a bit of time curled up there, and the kitchen and dining room are where Melissa does her magic. She's a professional chef and it definitely shows in those delicious baked goods. Oh, and there's complimentary beer in the fridge, cause Abil is a professional microbrewer. The entire house is also decorated with the most interesting of art and posters. Take note though! Some of them aren't quite PG13 so take note if you're bringing minors.

Now, as good as the house is, the hosts are even better. Abil is the coolest, Melissa the sweetest, and both the friendliest. Hung out with them, beer in hand and smore in the other in their beautiful garden and on the front porch, and those were evenings that I will not soon forget.

As hosts, they were also incredibly responsive and they tended to every request, no matter how big or small, that I had for them, both pre-trip and during my stay.

Top marks!

"
1772119,13355900,2014-05-26,12460306,Yi,"Melissa and Abil are so great hosts!!! My friend and I spent wonderful three days in their house. The breakfasts were great! You will definitely enjoy the muffins baked by Melissa, who is a professional chef, and fresh fruits everyday. They also offered us a chance to have an insight view of Seattle, which made our trip so unique! The bus near their house can take you to almost every attraction in the city, including Seattle Center, Pike Market, piers, etc. If I am going to Seattle for a second time, I will not hesitate to visit their house again.

It is so lucky to be your guests! =D"
1772119,13512244,2014-05-29,6548413,Jennifer,"This was a great place for my quick trip to Seattle! I didn't spend a lot of time in the room, but it was well equipped. The bed was comfortable and there was room for both of my large suitcases underneath. The bathroom was shared but as there was only one other couple there when I was there it wasn't an issue. The common area were nice and comfortable but I didn't get a chance to spend much time there. Breakfast was wonderful! Fruit plate, homemade muffins, and tea! They even packed me breakfast for the next morning when I had to leave early. Melissa and Abil were very friendly and I enjoyed chatting with them in the evenings. Overall a great stay!"
1772119,13836445,2014-06-05,6441724,Christy,"My stay with Melissa and Abil was brief but wonderful. They are lovely people and gracious hosts. They do a wonderful job of anticipating guests needs like having water in my room when I arrived, and several other nice touches like that. I highly recommend staying with them. Aside from being great hosts and having a beautiful and comfortable home, their home is well located."
1772119,15448957,2014-07-09,13776654,Gretchen,"What a treat to spend time at Melissa and Abil's home. They have an incredible knack of keeping their guests feeling welcome and comfortable. True to their word, Melissa provided us with hot baked goods, fruit and coffee every morning at their lovely dining table. Both Abil and Melissa were excellent conversationalists and were excited to hear our stories about Seattle as well as share some of their own. They are knowledgeable about the area and give great recommendations. I hope to stay with them the next time I visit Seattle and I will be recommending them to family and friends. Thank you!!"
1772119,15823645,2014-07-16,3841294,Rosa,"Nous avons été accueilli et chouchouté par Melissa et Abil comme rarement nous l'avons été à ce jour.  
La maison est très agréable et chaque pièce est décorée avec soin, avec son petit caractère. Chaque détail est soigné. C'est une ancienne maison avec son jardin, magnifiquement restaurée et aux belles finitions.
Petit déjeuné avec gâteaux fait maison et petites attentions au quotidien qui font que l'on se sent bien chez elles. 
La maison est facilement accessible par les transports en communs. 3 lignes passent à proximité et vous déposent à dowton. Capitol Hill est accessible à pied (15mn de balade). Le quartier est résidentiel et très tranquille. 
Difficile de partir de chez elles :-)  "
1772119,16294491,2014-07-25,13221849,Sophie,"We had a wonderful stay in Seattle .

The room: we stayed in the budget room. The bed was certainly big enough for both of us and incredibly comfy. 

The house: beautifully decorated Victorian property with lots of interesting furniture. There's a lounge you can sit in if you tire of Seattle/your room and a lovely garden with chairs. The fresh baked muffins every morning were amazing!

The location: 1 block away from a bus that takes you to downtown in about 15 minutes. Neighbourhood is within an easy walking distance of grocery stores, restaurants and a cool little community theatre called 'Central Cinema' which is worth checking out. 

The hosts: Melissa and Abil are simply awesome. They were welcoming and friendly throughout our stay and we had some fascinating conversations. We couldn't have hoped for a better start to our trip :) 

P.S because the house has a few rooms which are used for air bnb there are always new people to chat to at breakfast which is a bonus. "
1772119,16636349,2014-07-30,12460774,Jessica,Melissa and Able were amazing!! Their house is located just east of downtown Seattle. Every morning we had a pleasant walk from the house all the way to Pikes market. That walk was all downhill. In the evenings we would take the public bus that had a stop just two blocks away! It couldn't have been easier to get around and it was a great location. The house was a nice older home and the amenities were perfect for us. Throw in a great breakfast and two of the nicest people you could stay with and you get a perfect trip! They were extremely accommodating to us and greeted us very late at night/early morning when we got to their house from the airport. Thanks for everything we will deffinitly stay here again when we come back to Seattle!!
1772119,16736093,2014-08-01,18000407,Luise,"Great host to enhance your Seattle experience!
The fresh fruits we had each morning were a perfect start to the day and the baked good that came with it was to die for. Melissa and Abil were rich of knowledge and made it easier for us to navigate the city. Their hints helped us to get the most out of our time in seattle.
To top it off their back yard was the perfect place to relax, sip a beer and recount the sights of the day.
Many thanks!"
1772119,17675170,2014-08-16,15276296,Emeric,"Emeric and I stayed 2 weeks in this lovely house so we think we are highly qualified to comment Abil and Melissa's hospitality.
The house is very close (less than 5 minutes walking) to a bus station going directly downtown (15 minutes). It is a beautiful and safe area of Seattle (many gardens, cutes houses...) and yet 
very convenient for every type of activities (sight seeing, jogging, commuting...). Our bedroom was clean and so was the bathroom. The whole maintenance, the wifi and other material aspects, 
was perfectly taken into account everyday. But what's really superior to anywhere else is the humane factor. Abil and Melissa are awesome. They take care of you if you need them and let you 
live your life if you prefer. They truly found the perfect balance between being friendly and being ""professional"". You will also have a wonderful and healthy breakfast as Melissa will
cook nice muffins every morning (at 8:30am they are still warm^^) and bring it close to your plate of fruits and cup of tea/coffe with a nice smile. We really enjoyed our stay 
in their house and we recommend it to you. Don't miss the opportunity ! You will have no regrets! Also, Abil and Melissa were able to provide many useful information, either for tourists or for
foreigners like us coming from France to settle in Seattle. We left the place being happy to discover our own apartment in Seattle, but at the same time it was so sad to let Abil and Melissa's
home that we felt became ours, somehow. But it's consolaty to know we'll hang out together "
1772119,18233521,2014-08-24,5445603,Jose,The best Airbnb accommodation we have been to so far.
1772119,18523490,2014-08-28,9792228,Joris,Melissa and Abil are wonderful hosts! They know many good places in Seattle. The breakfast is amazing with the home made muffins and other treats. The house offers good spots to relax(with a nice Pike beer) and is nicely decorated in their own vintage style. The room was nice and clean as were the other facilities. We loved staying with Melissa and Abil who are funny and enthousiastic people. They made us feel very welcome. Recommanded to anyone to stay! I would definately go back.
1772119,18789902,2014-09-01,16160488,James,"Amazing place, very cozy indeed. Hosts were very friendly and helpful. 
The place is super convenient too. There's quite a few good bars and a fantastic fried chicken place within 5-10 min walk. Only takes about 25 min to walk to the interesting areas downtown too which is super nice. 

Loved the atmosphere."
1772119,19170592,2014-09-07,20473916,Lindsay,"Melissa and Abil are awesome! They made us feel welcomed from the moment we arrived. They are fantastic hosts: so warm, funny, and helpful.

The home is stunning, and the room was clean and inviting. Though we had the smallest room in the house, we comfortably fit everything into the space.

Melissa bakes the most amazing muffins and Abil creates a beautiful fruit spread each morning. It was fantastic to have such a tasty, healthy meal to start the day. Breakfast also offered the opportunity to meet others who were staying, which was helpful when discussing things to do and see. 

Additionally, there is a large table with all sorts of maps and helpful guides for getting around Seattle, and Melissa and Abil are more than happy to offer helpful suggestions.

We loved our experience so much that we were very sad to leave. We will return on our next journey to Seattle!"
1772119,19733795,2014-09-17,19587898,Jason,Melissa made me feel extremely welcome at the house. The room was exactly as described and was ideal for a single traveler who needs a place to stay. Breakfast each morning was a huge time saver and benefit - the beer in the fridge was awesome as well. I wish I had more time to hang around the house and explore the neighborhood. 
1772119,19876975,2014-09-20,26875,Andrew,"Seattle was a great place to end our long journey, and we couldn't have picked a more suitable airbnb for our stay. Melissa and Abel are THE consummate hosts. So helpful, so funny, so lovely to get to know, both of them. You can really tell they love having a bed and breakfast because it just shows, in everything they do. So much thought has been put into the details that made our stay exceptional. The house is beautifully appointed with vintage flair, and the bedroom (while budget priced!) was extremely comfortable for two. Once you hear the history of the house and how much work was put into it and the yard, you'll appreciate it even more. It was fun chatting with other guests in the morning while enjoying Melissa's delicious baked goods, and while not a standard thing, we really appreciated the surprise invite to enjoy a dinner with Melissa and Abel in the kitchen. It's a grand house, in an AMAZING LOCATION. We were able to walk everywhere of interest with only once needing to take transit home (which is super easy as well). Who knew Seattle had so many hills? ...if you can get a walking map with Seattle's topography (they must make it!), you'll be an even smarter pedestrian. Visiting Seattle again is a must, as is staying with these lovely folk. Highly recommended!!"
1772119,20260566,2014-09-26,398672,Jenny,"After a long day of hectic travel, lost luggage, and confusing itineraries, I walked into Melissa and Abel's home and felt immediately better. I had sent them the wrong arrival time by accident, and not only did they welcome me with open arms, but made me laugh and relax. So appreciated.

Plus, fresh baked muffins and fruit in the morning? Such a special, special home!"
1772119,20518028,2014-09-30,6932093,Erin,"Wow! Staying with Melissa and Abil was next level amazing. They are awesome - and I'd recommend staying at their place. Their beautiful home is warm, welcoming and for me, a solo queer travelling, felt like a temporary home along the way. Their bed and breakfast has all the comforts of home - including an amazing bath, which I'd have totally used had I had more time. The location is central and I walked everywhere. Melissa's cooking is ridiculously great - and they take great pains to make sure things are local, ethical and can cater to picky vegans like me. I was so excited and inspired by all the vegan things Mel made especially for me. Dining in the mornings at their table was a real treat - and if you're lucky you might get to fine with some other amazing travellers - as I did. Two sweet German sailors! Diet restrictions ? You won't have to worry! Melissa and Abil are really friendly, welcoming and full of great tips for things to do in the city that they love - especially around beer and cooking!! I took Abil's brewery tour and it was one of the best things I did in Seattle. Stay here - it's totally an experience in itself.

The only reason to possibly be sleepless here is if you are trying to get to all of the wonderful places Melissa and Abil recommend or if you are having late night brownies and stout with the girls. This lovely house is located within walking distance of so many activities, restaurants and sites, that a car is virtually unnecessary.
Upon walking into this wonderfully appointed home, you just feel enveloped with love and comfort. And to seal that comfort, you are greeted with fresh-baked, warm parties every morning.
My stay here was so special, that I feel I have gained two new friends.
Were I a wordsmith, this review would be able to convey my true feelings. Do not miss the opportunity to stay with Abil and Melissa - your life will be richer for it."
1772119,24311956,2014-12-25,24613026,鹏,"The hosts, Abil and Mellissa, are very kind and warm heart! As we are first time come to Seattle, both of them gave me precious advices. The rooms are great, nice decorated and clean. And it's quiet as well. Very morning we ate breakfirst which cooked by Mellissa, delicious and sufficient. By the way, Abil's beers are owesome!! I miss it too much! At last, we would like to give our sinere appreciation to both Abil and Mellissa. The experience stayed in your house was wonderful, thank you and best wishes to you!"
1772119,26718794,2015-02-17,5848695,Jorge Luis,"Staying at Melissa's (and Abil's) place is by far one of the best experiences I've had in Airbnb. The place is a huge, beautiful, and spotless house with many rooms, each one with its own personality. The room is cozy indeed. Big enough to fit two people with some pieces of luggage.

The neighborhood is cool and diverse, as the city itself. Very quiet but still active. You can easily find places to eat late at night and get a good drink, all within walking distance.

Finally, Melissa and Abil. I think with 112 excellent reviews so far there's no doubt they're fantastic hosts. They're also interesting and funny people, always very helpful and warm including Courtney, their assistant. Don't miss Melissa's muffins and always follow their recommendations for restaurants and bars.

No doubt I'll go back to #bedbakedandbeyond"
1772119,27725774,2015-03-10,27328880,David,"I had a great experience staying with Melissa and Abil. The house was charming, quaint, positive, and everything that I hoped that it would be. For me, the best part of the bed baked and beyond experience was getting to know these two lovely ladies. They are great people, easy to warm up to, easy to talk to. I loved all the hospitality that was shown to me. 

Great location, great home, great people--I will be coming back, hopefully sometime soon :)  "

If i will go to Seattle  next time i will chose their house again and i will recommend to my friends chose their house.
1772119,31241952,2015-05-03,2968264,Chenxia,"This was definitely one of the highlights of our trip! Melissa and Abil have put together a beautiful and welcoming bed&breakfast together, and it was a really lovely place to call home for a couple of days. (And the home-made muffins and beautiful fruit plate for breakfast each morning - fucking amazing!)
Highly recommend - it's a wonderfully relaxing place to start your day, as well as a cozy place to come back to at the end of your evening.
I really enjoyed how friendly and cheerful Melissa and Abil are - they really make you feel welcome, and it was like staying with friends :)"

The room was comfortable,  breakfast was amazing,  lots of insider tips that made our seattle experience! The bus round the corner also took us straight to downtown.  Definelty stay here!"

Stay here!!You never wanted to visit Seattle?-Think it over,just so you can stay here!!!Melissa,Abil (and Courtney) are the nicest people!Their house is super clean,super cute and feels like a home away from home!They are very helpful concerning everything!They serve  home made Muffins( every morning you will wake up and wonder what kind of delicious Muffin you get today), fruit and good coffee for breakfast !Also their house is in walking distance from everything great in Seattle!Don't muss you chance to stay at their wonderful home!!"
1772119,33410936,2015-05-27,3026587,Lorenzo,"I spent 4 days in Melissa and Abil's house during a business trip to Seattle. The experience has been great! The house is really really nice, clean and well located. The city downtown can be easily reached by bus or on foot and it is plenty of really good places to eat near the house. Melissa and Abil are amazing! They pamper you with fresh biologic fruit and home-baked muffins every day, they help you in every way possible during your stay and they always have great stories to share with you. For the first two days I stayed in the budget loft and I have to say that the room is great with a really comfortable bed. The shared bathroom never created issues, since the owners never ""overbook"" the house.
So if you have to spend time in Seattle I really suggest to stay at Abile and Mellissa's."
1772119,34397734,2015-06-08,12312145,Ellie,"Melissa, Abil and Courtney were the ultimate hosts! From the incredible muffins and fruit plate in the morning, the good strong pot of British tea, to the complimentary beers and the relaxed and friendly atmosphere, we had an amazing time at their guesthouse. They gave us brilliant advice and tips for the city, helped us get orientated and made us feel at home. The house itself is beautiful and has everything you could need, plus a lot more and we sat outside in the warm evening sun in their incredible garden. If we were to visit Seattle again, we'd rebook with them in an instant! Thank you all so much! You are why Airbnb was invented and I'm so glad we got to stay and meet you!"
1772119,34747977,2015-06-11,31660570,Maria,"Melissa and Abil's beautiful home is the one place to stay in Seattle. It is conveniently located in a safe neighborhood that is just one bus ride away from Seattle Center. However, what made this Cherry Hill BnB special was the hospitality Melissa and Abil offered from the moment of reservation until the end of our stay. They are wonderfully welcoming and friendly, and their assistant, Courtney, is just as nice. I cannot imagine better hosts!

Also, Melissa's spiced pear muffins are to die for!"
1772119,35290734,2015-06-17,19587898,Jason,"This was my second time at Cherry Hill and it was just as awesome as the first. Melissa  and Abil are fun, welcoming, and gracious hosts. They serve breakfast (and beer) which provides an extreme value for your money. The surrounding neighborhood gives a great Seattle experience and is just a short bus rider or uber from downtown. I will always stay here when visiting Seattle."
1772119,36117423,2015-06-25,31156338,Marco,"Hard to find the right words. Melissa and Abil were just wonderful hosts. To be there felt just like visiting friends and leaving their place was kind of hard. Imaging sitting in a lovely garden, having a beer together, making jokes and having really good conversations at the same time. This is what most likely will happen when you decide to stay at their place. The house is awesome, lots of space in two living rooms, very clean rooms and bathrooms (there are two), every room is so nicely decorated with cool old furniture: all is very, very cozy. 
The neighborhood seemed extremely save to us and you can easily walk to downtown, but there are also cool bars around. One last advice: Listen to Abils and Melissa tips! All recommendations for eating or drinking turned out to be superb locations. 
Thanx again you two, we won´t forget!"
1772119,36318438,2015-06-27,34863349,Jasmine,Melissa and Abil were awesome hosts!  We had so much fun talking to them and just hanging out.  They and their assistant Courtney were full of awesome recommendations.  The house is gorgeous too and has a ton of history.  Would highly recommend!
1772119,36799492,2015-07-01,13099899,Lorilee,Our stay with Melissa and Abil was fantastic! They were very welcoming and even accommodated our late arrival.

They helped me bring in my bags, gave me the grand tour, and made it clear from the beginning of my stay that I was to make myself right at home in their space. The free microbrews in the fridge and the fantastic homemade muffins for breakfast certainly didn't hurt! Overall, the B&B is a fantastic place to stay - quiet, comfortable, and beautifully decorated. And you couldn't ask for two nicer or more genuine hosts!"
1772119,38288172,2015-07-14,34872007,Megan,"Melissa and Abil made us feel very welcome from beginning to end. We had delicious breakfast every morning and they provided many conveniences such as fresh towels, forgotten bathroom products, a ton of tips about the city, and even provided beer from Pikes Brewing Co. The house was a short 20 min walk away from the city and a 5 min walk away from a neighborhood bar/restaurant.  Thank you so much for having us, I strongly recommend this place to anyone looking for a great price when traveling to seattle! "
1772119,39501342,2015-07-24,34459723,Marco,"My stay was wonderful, I only wish I had been able to spend more time there! Abil and Melissa were charming, courteous, and made my stay a pleasant and comfortable one. The neighborhood was cute, historical, and close to downtown. Their home is spacious and well-decorated - you can spend an hour in any one of the many living/dining/social rooms observing the decorations, trinkets, and memorabilia of various sorts and never run out of new things to look at or think about. 

The garden outside was lush and full of nature, and provided a relaxing spot to take a break from a busy day of touristing. The upstairs bathroom was huge and had an classic charm about it - this may sound crazy, but I almost wish I had taken a picture of the classic claw-foot tub. The whole premises were kept spotless and well-organized at all times, to the highest of professional standards. 

I walked into the center of the city a few times, but the bus is just a short walk, as were a few nice, budget-friendly restaurants. Uber averaged maybe $5-7 when I used it. Oh, last but certainly not least, I think the delicious baked goods should be more than enough reason to stay here and never leave. If I could give 6 stars, I would. "

They made us feel welcome from beginning to the end and were always happy to give us advice. We loved our cozy room with a bunk bed, the wonderful backyard, the cute cat and the delicious breakfasts! The neighborhood was beautiful and quiet, in walking distance to both Pine Place Market and City Center with two busses running right in next to the house in addition to that. Highly recommendable!!!"

They were also very nice for meeting us, even tho we arrived at 3am. Their place also is one of the best place we have ever stayed in through Airbnb. The room we stayed in was so cool and bright, just like the pictures. Their house is just fabulous! Also, the breakfast! Melissa's cooking was superb! And we greatly appreciate Abil for the plate of fruits she prepared every morning. They truly thought about everything and truly care about their guests. "

Both Melissa and Abel were absolutely wonderful! Their uniqueness and lively personality made our stay so fantastic. They both gave us a lot of valuable information on everything we needed to do and see in Seattle. Very informative hosts.  They would always check in with us to talk to us about what we saw. Our room was clean, comfortable and cozy. Furthermore, breakfast was amazing with home made muffins and fresh fruit. Such a lovely environment. 

If my wife and I lived in Seattle we would totally hang out with them on the weekends.

1772119,44910930,2015-08-30,34497386,Davit,"If you want to FEEL Seattle come to this Place!

Unfortunately we only spend two nights but fell in love with Melissa and Abil, the wonderful Cherry Hill, El Gato (the cat) and the beautiful vibe of Seattle right away.

Of course the location is great and you can reach every part of the city easily. But the most amazing thing was meeting wonderful people like our hosts. We loved their warm and welcoming lifestyle and the breakfast is one of a kind with fresh fruits and delicious fresh baked muffins every Morning.

We can't recommend this place enough - it's just the best experience!"

They really went the extra mile to make guests feel comfortable! The loft room and house were simply beautiful. Breakfast in the morning was amazing. Plus, El Gato the cat is the sweetest/cutest cat ever. I will definitely try to book with them again if I am ever in the area. Thank you!!"
1772119,45801020,2015-09-06,8265001,Peter,"On a whirlwind trip to Seattle, Abil and Melissa were an oasis of comfort. They are delightful company and attentive hosts who are consummate pros at what they do. 
There was a clean room and bed, coffee with handmade muffins in the AM, any neighborhood info you needed, and El Gato, their kind old cat.
This air b&b listing is more than highly recommended and we hope to be back soon and for a longer stay."
1772119,46719197,2015-09-13,5538007,Caylie,"There is a good reason why these ladies are Superhosts! They are immediately welcoming and inviting into their beautiful home. They offer the most detailed food and drink suggestions, help with your itinerary and directions. This place is immaculately kept, from the inside out, and shared spaces are maintained daily. 
Not enough words can describe how awesome and fun Melissa, Abil and Courtney are! They have such a great system going- the dynamic between them is so fun and their guests are the forefront of every decision they make. The location is close to Pike and Pine street, two very cool streets for amazing food, bars, shops, and a short bus trip to downtown.
The other guests staying we're cool, and the interactions were enjoyable and relaxing. Each of them were respectful with noise and space.
Being a solo female traveller Melissa, Abil and Courtney were so lovely and including in dinner plans and random chats. The breakfast muffins and fruit plate were an absolute treat to wake up to each morning!
No other Airbnb hosts will look after you like these three, ensuring they create the BEST Seattle experience for you.
THANKS SO MUCH!!!  "
1772119,47242425,2015-09-17,8956956,Tony,"Absolutely amazing! Wouldn't change a thing! Melissa and Abil were great hosts and just all around cool people! The house is a wonderfully cared for home full of charm and very welcoming. I stayed in the smallest of the rooms (loft room) because I was traveling alone and on a budget. What a great value! I expected the room to have a tiny uncomfortable loft bed but it was actually a nicer mattress than I have at home. Every morning I was greeted to delicious baked goods, fruit and coffee which was just perfect for starting a day full of walking around Seattle. They were very knowledgeable about the city and happy to list their favorite spots. Found several cool breweries, dispensaries and restaurants that I wouldn't have tried except for their suggestions. Next time I'm in Seattle I just hope they have an opening! Perfect!"
1772119,48724520,2015-09-28,7017584,Emma,"My stay with Melissa and Abil could not have been more perfect. Their home is bright, cozy, and welcoming, with fresh cut flowers adorning the dining room table and a personalized welcome message in the kitchen. Though the room is small, they make excellent use of the space and the bed is extremely comfortable! The daily muffins and fruit were absolutely delicious, and they kindly helped me plan my whirlwind weekend. Thank you for making my trip so wonderful :)"
1772119,49331741,2015-10-03,3368644,Sabrina,"Melissa e Abil sono due persone meravigliose...ci hanno fatto stare a nostro agio sin dal nostro arrivo...con l'aiuto di Courtney (loro assistente) ci hanno dato tutte le informazioni necessarie x muoverci a Seattle....e che dire della residenza: semplicemente incantevole...anche la nostra stanza: piccola ma più che sufficiente x una coppia....d'altronde ci devi solo dormire...ci sono altre stupende stanze dove potersi rilassare...
Altra sorpresa sono i muffin preparati al mattino a colazione...ogni giorno un gusto diverso...buonissimi!!! E x chi ama la birra ce n'è a volontà nel frigorifero a disposizione degli ospiti...
Che dire altro...grazie a Abil Melissa e Courtney"
1772119,49681644,2015-10-05,15687744,Jake,"Abil was a great host! She took time to orient us to the neighborhood and recommended various restaurants and attractions for us to see. The loft was great; comfy bed and pillows! The house has a lot of character and would highly recommend staying here! We were provided some complimentary craft brews during our stay as well as coffee, muffins and fruit every morning. "
1772119,50047808,2015-10-08,15707785,Lea," can recommend this stay in any ways, its perfect.

We loved it to stay with Melissa, Abil, Courtney and El Gato. 
They are the best host we ever met. 
The house was super clean, cozy and just beautiful. The arrangement of the house is amazing.
Furthermore the breakfast especially the muffins are awesome…
We re really sad to leave today and we would definitely stay longer or come back to drink a beer /wine with you. Thank you these 3 amazing and special days in Seattle."
1772119,51192531,2015-10-18,10837976,Marwin & Carolyn,"Carolyn and I's experience with Melissa and Abil's home was very warm and welcoming. The house itself was a delight to see and I recommend to be very aware of all the details around the house as there is many to see! (: Very clean and tidy, delicious breakfast(recommended), best coffeecake i've had! Carolyn was very happy Melissa accommodated for her gluten-free request and we wish we brought some of her baking back home. Melissa was helpful throughout our adventure and we love her thrift sale that we now have an item as a memory. Wonderful hosts and carolyn and I hope to visit Seattle again in the near future! "
1772119,51736065,2015-10-24,39402176,Kelsey,"What an absolute pleasure this leg of my trip was! I would recommend staying here to anyone & everyone I know. Melissa, Abil, & Courtney are so welcoming and friendly. Every morning they had suggestions of what to go see & do in Seattle and had plenty of helpful insights for the parts of my trip I already had planned out. The daily muffins, fruit, & coffee were an absolute treat. They truly care about their guests & make an effort to engage with them and help them feel welcome. Don't hesitate - book with them! "
1772119,52118989,2015-10-26,45809041,Julie,"Melissa & Abil were great hosts! Very welcoming and helpful with sightseeing suggestions. Melissa's breakfast baked goods were delicious. The bath towels were incredibly soft - not sure how they do this, but I was presently surprised. The location of their historic home was perfect for getting to downtown - whether walking or taking an $8-10 Uber ride. There are also great local places to visit within a 10 minute walk. I would love to visit Seattle again and stay with Melissa and Abil."
1772119,52964161,2015-11-03,19424755,Nathalie,"We couldn't have asked for a better place to stay in Seattle than Bed, Baked, and Beyond. Being my boyfriend and I's first AirBNB experience we weren't sure what to expect but Melissa and Abil exceeded our expectations. They were very warm and friendly, always had a good story to tell, and spent nearly half an hour helping us plan an amazing day which we certainly couldn't have come up without their help. Beyond that their house is a stunning 100+ year old time capsule from the early days of the city and sits within walking distance of any tourist destinations you may want to visit and many great restaurants and bars are only blocks away. Beyond that they took into account my dietary restrictions when planning a delicious complimentary breakfast and have great local craft beers for you to enjoy on the house. Great experience, thanks so much for the good times!"
1772119,53746095,2015-11-12,15587240,Pearce,"A really comfortable bed, waking up refreshed and relaxed, to a suddenly sunny Seattle! Heading downstairs, (past the well cared for writing desk covered in tourist info pamphlets), to the smell of freshly baked muffins with locally sourced fruit. The bnb is situationally located and easy walking distance (and really cheap Uber) from the International District, Trader Joes, Food Cooperative, and all sorts of shopping options on Pike and 15th. Even discounts at other local shops if mentioning the business. 

It was really an honour to stay here, I kept looking and saying to myself 'Is this really happening?' Is this house/room really this gorgeous? The backyard garden (even though done for the season) is still beautiful.

At times, the hosts and their amazing assistant made me feel more at home than in all my other travels! 

Perfectly clean without being sterile, a really well stocked bathroom with plenty of comforting toiletries that travellers wouldn't normally bring with them, such as epsom salts for soaking, for us flatland dwellers foolishly walking up those hills from downtown. The house and local area kept opening up to these amazing moments and conversations. I even recommend locals to stay here for Staycations!"
1772119,54869633,2015-11-25,21453566,Miya,"Abil and Melissa are so nice to me, and the place is great. I will recommend my every friend who wants to visit Seattle to stay with them!"
1772119,55199667,2015-11-29,6911497,Susan,"The best B&B experience I have ever had! I felt welcomed and comfortable from the moment I entered. The cozy loft was cozy, indeed, and I thoroughly enjoyed many fascinating conversations with my host and other guests. Wonderfully delicious and healthy breakfasts and within 3 blocks of my family's residence, while easy access to mass transit or healthy walks to interesting aspects of the neighborhood and beyond. I definitely hope to return. Most appreciated the care with which the hosts schedule bookings. Not interested in the biggest bucks but the best experience for their guests!"
4922836,28355342,2015-03-22,9310866,Yanet,"Andrew's place was great and beautiful; very spacious. Andrew was such a great and helpful host, my husband and I had a great time staying at his place. We recommend staying at Andrew's place. He gives you your privacy. If we return to Seattle, we will most definitely be back to Andrew's place. His place is also very conveniently located to the Link light rail station which made it easy to get around in Seattle."
4922836,29475672,2015-04-07,18304438,Lynda,"My boyfriend and I had a wonderful experience staying with Andrew. His apartment is beautiful, spacious, clean, and exactly as pictured. It is conveniently located next to the train, which made it easy to get to and from the airport. As a host, Andrew replied to all messages very quickly, made accommodations for our check-in and check-out times,  and was very generous in making our stay feel comfortable - he even stocked the fridge with fresh produce for breakfast and snacks for us! We only interacted a couple of times due to our schedule differences, but he was friendly and gave us privacy. We definitely recommend his place to all and would love to stay there again if we are ever in the area!"
4922836,31667099,2015-05-08,30039568,Juan,"Andrew and his private room was what I was looking for. Andrew provided a pleasant and clean living quarters where I would be more than glad to return again. 
Andrew provided me with privacy and also time to communicate with him on the surrounding areas here in Seattle.
Andrew's neighborhood was near to everything to provide for any requirements that you would need. It was also close to downtown Seattle and where I had to be on business. 
Thanks for the great stay Andrew."
4922836,32092864,2015-05-13,25315597,Anna,"My husband and I had a great stay in Andrew's home. The room was just as described. We had a lot of privacy, the bed was very comfortable and the en suite bathroom had a great shower head!!

Andrew was a generous host. He had breakfast items available for us in the kitchen and his home was spacious and clean. The location is excellent, conveniently located next to the Light rail that takes you straight into downtown. This will save you a lot of time and money as parking in the city can get expensive. 

Thank you Andrew for hosting us in your home. We had a great stay! "
4922836,32269702,2015-05-16,31995909,Holger,"Wir hatten einen schönen Aufenthalt in Andrew's Haus. Das Zimmer entsprach der Beschreibung und war sauber. Das Haus liegt in einem schönen Wohnumfeld. Die Lage ist gut, um Seattle zu erkunden. Es ist nur ein kurzer Weg zu Stadtbahnhaltestelle und eine kurze Fahrt in die Innenstadt."
4922836,32907303,2015-05-23,11879735,Patricia,Listing was as described. Bathroom was clean. Convenient location to bus and about a 10 minute walk to light rail that goes to downtown Seattle. 
4922836,33801151,2015-06-01,4253380,Julia,"We had a great stay at Andrew's house. He was very kind, always answered promptly to my messages and he was very helpful even when we arrived very late from the airport. 
The house and the neighborhood are very pleasant and comfortable and as the link light rail station is about 10 min by foot it's the perfect base to explore Seattle. "
4922836,34232321,2015-06-06,20336878,Shi Yu,The house is very clean. The location is good and not far from the SEA airport. Everything looks very new. The host is very nice. When we have problem to ask him， he will response immediately.
4922836,34872476,2015-06-13,32869413,Chris,"My wife and I stayed at Andrew's home for a week, and both of us can say that it was a great experience.  Andrew's home was conveniently located in Seattle, making travel time easy and the experience worthwhile.  Andrew was extremely accommodating with check-in/check-out times, and offered much knowledge about the city and what to do in it.   He was also very friendly, and respectful of privacy.  His space was just what we needed as we had access to the kitchen, washing machine/dryer, and own personal bathroom in the room. "
4922836,35144109,2015-06-15,34678077,Guadalupe,"This was our first time booking through Air BnB and Andrew definitely made it a great experience. His place was super clean and the neighborhood was very calm and easy to find. He was very accommodating and gave us a lot of advice in terms of events that were going on around us. Definitely recommend for future bookings. Oh and can't forget about that kitchen, very on point."
4922836,35557934,2015-06-20,31984455,Lawrence,"This was our first time using AirBNB and the experience was great.  Andrew was very flexible with check in and out time as well as making himself available for questions or info on Seattle.   The neighborhood was in a safe location, close to the train and the bus stations which made traveling Seattle easy.  The house was very clean and accommodating.  The bed was almost to comfortable, smile.  We suggest Andrew get a coffee maker, but even then, Starbucks is only a 15 minute stroll through quant neighborhoods.  If we ever get to Seattle, we will certainly see if Andrew has any vacncy.  Thanks Andrew for a great experience."
4922836,36045540,2015-06-24,35257617,Gerrimae,"Andrew's home was very nice and modern. My boyfriend and I enjoyed our stay very much. Even though we were not able to meet Andrew due to our different schedules, he was a great host. It was very easy to communicate via text and phone and he was lenient when we had to cut our stay short. Thanks for your great hospitality (: We will definitely consider staying in your home again in the future. 

"
4922836,36251225,2015-06-26,6563761,Beckie  & David,"Andrew's place was an excellent location to see Seattle.  The accommodations were great with our private bath.  We were even able to wash with no problems.  Although we used our car, it is also very convenient to public transportation.  I'm just sorry we never got to meet Andrew, but we communicated through text with no problems at all. "
4922836,36556802,2015-06-29,34237825,Christopher,Andrew was very welcoming and a gracious host! He left us berries from the farmers market and a fully stocked fridge! Great location close to the Sodo district. 
4922836,37064230,2015-07-04,34071164,Christian,"Andrew was very accommodating and communicative through every stage of our stay.  The house was just as described, clean and comfortable.   Close to the link station, easy trip to downtown.  Andrew had great suggestions and advice for all things Seattle.  Would certainly book again when returning! "
4922836,37330170,2015-07-06,1901002,Christine,"We did not get to know Andrew but he had perfectly arranged our stay at his place in advance. The house and guest room is very tidy. Downtown Seattle is easily reachable by light rail.
It was a very pleasant stay and we definitely recommend staying at  Andrew’s place.
"
4922836,37856178,2015-07-11,22160886,Patti,"andrew's place was very nice, quiet, convenient to light link rail to downtown and airport. Very reasonable in price. I would definitely recommend."
4922836,38399559,2015-07-15,30857816,Avnish,"This was a great house, and exactly as described. It was within 10 minutes of the light rail, which made it very easy to go downtown or the airport. Columbia City itself has a nice downtown area if you wanted to spend the evening within walking distance. The room was a bit small, but clean and had a comfy bed. The en-suite bathroom was very nice, and the shower had great water pressure. Andrew was friendly and made us feel welcome. "
4922836,38707925,2015-07-18,31548265,Barry,"Had a great stay at Andrew's place. Very contemporary and clean. Conveniently located between the airport and downtown, the light rail is a great option for getting around. Although I did not meet Andrew until the end of my stay, he was very communicative and responsive both before and during my visit. Thanks for a great accommodation!"
4922836,39055645,2015-07-20,1936882,Kurt,"We enjoyed our stay at Andrew's house.  The room was very clean and comfortable.  We only got a chance to chat with Andrew for a couple of minutes, but he was very nice.  Checking in and out was easy. Location is great.  We would be happy to stay at Andrew's place again!"
4922836,39757523,2015-07-26,33512681,Mejdi,"Andrew made us feel very welcome to his new, clean, and comfortable home. The area was great and felt safe, many great restaurants in the area as well. A lot of parking for those who will be renting a car like we did. Overall a very satisfying experience."
4922836,40797374,2015-08-02,9178357,Brian,"Andrew was an exceptional host and his place was clean and well located.  It was easy to drive to both downtown Seattle and the airport.  He answered all my questions very promptly and he generously offered us extra watermelon that he had.  Instructions for guests were posted on the door, which made things easy for everyone.  I highly recommend staying at Andrew's!"
4922836,42834061,2015-08-16,32232412,Tiffany,"Andrew's place was our first Airbnb experience, and he set the bar high. Superb location, extremely clean home, comfortable bed and pillows, parking 20 feet from front door always available, safe neighborhood. Andrew told us about a cool little strip of restaurants and shops within walking distance (about 1 mile) from his house that we would not have known about if he had not made us aware of them.  I felt the price was a bargain for what we got. "
4922836,43336595,2015-08-18,10798922,Edward,"Everything was just as described and pictured. Our schedules never crossed paths so we never met, but there was everything I needed there. I found some good spots to eat close by and had a comfortable home to relax and unwind at at the end of the day."
4922836,43862691,2015-08-22,41514600,Filippo,"Stanza pulita e comoda con bagno privato. Casa posizionata in un quartiere 100% residenziale, tranquillo, non centrale ma ben collegato: in 20-25 minuti si arriva in centro o all'aereoporto grazie al light rail link. Tirando le somme vale il prezzo pagato, anche visti i costi improponibili di alberghi e motel, e siamo stati soddisfatti dell'accoglienza ricevuta. Andrew ci ha anche offerto la cena, peccato che si tenga molto leggero!"
4922836,44205058,2015-08-24,40969434,Christopher,"Andrew provided everything he said he would! The neighborhood is comfortable and the room is within walking distance of public transit. Although he was often busy and out of the home, we were left wanting nothing. "
4922836,48878828,2015-09-29,31490127,Matt,"Andrew was an superb host. His place was very clean and tidy and it was great having a private bathroom as it lent the space a nice blend of a well appointed hotel room, with all of the warmth of a private home. The small park area just outside the front door was a pleasant surprise as well.

With the lightrail lines being so close it was extraordinarily easy to get around - to get right into the heart of downtown only requires a short 5 minute walk to the nearest station and around 16 minutes to get downtown from there.

I would definitely recommend Andrew's place for anyone needing an excellent base to explore everything that the Seattle Metro area has to offer, but would enjoy a place to come back and relax at the end of the day."
4922836,49924711,2015-10-07,34390207,D J,"Andrew was the perfect host! The accommodations were all that I had hoped both in terms of amenities and location. The check-in/out process was seamless, and Andrew was easily accessible via mobile for any questions I had. A great stay!"
4922836,50515187,2015-10-12,42423416,Patrick,"Andrew's place was perfect for us! The community was quiet and beautiful, and he provided every amenity we could have wanted. We almost didn't want to leave after settling in, but when we finally did we found that downtown Seattle was just a short, pleasant drive away.

We rented a car and drove everywhere, but there is a lot of public transportation nearby (metro station just a few blocks away) that could have made things even easier.

I'm happy to give my highest possible recommendation to anyone planning to visit Seattle!"
4922836,50799536,2015-10-14,45661754,Daniel,"Andrew was responsive and accommodating, letting me stow my bike in his garage. The room is comfortable and the apartment is in a nice neighborhood, nearly adjacent to the light rail and within easy distance of good places to eat and drink."
4922836,51817147,2015-10-24,46507674,Hannah,"Andrew was a great host and had an awesome home. It was very modern and in a great neighborhood. We stayed for a week and had plenty of time to check out the area. Staying for that long gave us plenty of time to get comfortable, and Andrew made it super easy for us. We had everything we needed."
4922836,56155184,2015-12-09,12680766,Vivien,"This is the most amazing house I have ever stayed  with Airbnb. The house is modern-designed,  specious,clean,neat and tidy. The area is quiet and nice. Andrew is such a wonderful host, if u need anything, he is always there. We really enjoyed our stay here and recommend yo you guys."
7695195,43547028,2015-08-20,39126271,Lucie,"Martin was a very welcoming host! He left us with an informative document on the house rules and fun things to do in the area. We really appreciated the cheese and chocolate plate he left us! The Capitol Hill area is great- his place is located a short walk from a lovely park and upbeat neighbourhood. Something to note is that the wifi was not accessible after 10 pm. In sum, his place was very clean and quiet and Martin was great at responding to our messages. Would definitely recommend staying here!"
7695195,45405788,2015-09-02,5186387,Danielle,"Martin is a great communicator. He went above and beyond to help accommodate us when our original airbnb canceled. His apartment is pristine; very clean and welcoming, plus it is in a fantastic location. I would totally recommend staying here."
7695195,47888183,2015-09-21,5719795,Sara,"Martin's apartment was perfect!! Just what we were looking for, super spacious, fantastic for a couple, great location, close to little restaurants and cute shops, which Martin kindly recommends us ;) We had a lovely stay, he was also super communicative with us, and it make the hole experience really good! We definitely would love to come back to his apartment, next time in Seattle!! Thanks for everything, it was a pleasure!"
219532,1303186,2012-05-19,2068941,Tony,"A fantastic little home in a fantastic location!  The Fun Home turned out to be ideal for 3 of us travelling on business. With it's fantastic outdoor spaces - deck, grill, sink, fridge, and HOT TUB - it was a marvelous place to unwind after a day of business meetings. Very convenient, the home is easy walking distance to Hales Ales, Brouwers, and all of the great little spots Fremont has to offer. Right on bus lines, very easy to get to Seattle Center, Lake Union, and even downtown, while still offering a cozy haven at the end of the day. Can't wait to go back!"
219532,1615709,2012-07-02,2703433,Daniela,Beautiful home and wonderful hosts. :D a pleasure to have stayed in Seattle.
219532,1678292,2012-07-10,2701967,Philine,"Dear Rose and Glen,
we really enjoyed staying in your nice house in Fremont/Seattle. After two and a half weeks ""roadshow"" from California to Seatte, we loved to relax the last six days of our trip in your ""fun home"". On 4th of July we just walked to the beautiful firework around the corner from your home. We loved to sit in the the hot tub watching the stars. And we enjoyed using your barbecue equipment.
We will come back...
Philine and family (Germany)"
219532,1910476,2012-08-07,1407277,Ruth,"We had a greattime. house is located in a great area, and was clean. The only complaint is that the bath tub up stairs is hard to get in and out of, and hard to bath kids in. Over all the house is great. The outside area is wonderful. thanks for a great trip."
219532,1970067,2012-08-13,2859770,Michael,"This house was delightful with tasteful decor inside and lush gardens outside.  The location was great, especially accessing restaurants and shopping in both Freemont and Ballard.  We really enjoyed dinners on the back deck.  We would gladly stay here again."
219532,5292834,2013-06-23,6038502,Esther,"Rose & Glen's home was clean, well-equipped and served as a home away from home for us. The outdoor BBQ was great for dinner cooking and the kitchen had everything we needed. Rose and Glen were speedy in their responses and very helpful - they got us a cot for our baby, and also accommodated our earlier check-in time. Great hosts and home! "
219532,5523819,2013-07-04,5992751,Patricia,"This home is indeed a fun home in the outskirts of Funky Fremont.  It's actually centrally located between Fremont and Ballard.  Easy walking to both through the neighborhoods. The walks provide great  exercise and spectacular views.  The house provides a relaxing atmosphere with multiple sitting spots (i.e. front porch glider, back deck, and two hidden adirondack chairs drenched in morning's light).  Basically two bedrooms and full bath upstairs and bedroom and 1/2 bath downstairs.  Plenty of storage and two shelves by front door to stow shoes.  If there had to be a complaint, the only one would be the traffic noise since the house is right off of Leary Way.  But you don't really notice too much unless you are sleeping on the back deck - which I did and loved and did not mind the early morning wake-up call since on vacation and plenty to do.  The house is ""hidden"" so lots of privacy and no noise from two neighbors in close proximity.  I would definitely recommend this house and hope to visit again.  It is a casual and comfortable accommodation.  Walkable location to restaurants and stores and bus line 40 on Leary Way will get you to/from Link for airport travel.  A bike would be a plus for getting around but there are a couple of Zip Car pick-up spots within walking distance if you want to venture to Rainier or take other excursions.  Enjoy!"
219532,5570030,2013-07-06,587020,Dan,"We had a lovely stay in this property. We were five adults and one toddler and there was plenty of space for all of us. The deck was excellent for us to gather on in the evening and wind down from our day of sightseeing. I stayed on the fold-out futon which was quite comfortable. 

Rose and Glen also gave us lots of local knowledge including how to get in & out of the city and where to go. Highly recommended! "
219532,6177092,2013-08-02,7155036,Matt,"Excellent accommodation. We were totally comfortable and Glen and Rose were great hosts. The neighborhood has plenty to do, see, and eat. Easy bus service to downtown, Seatle center etc kept the car in the driveway all week. Will stay here next time.  "
219532,6344278,2013-08-09,102901,Ben,"Although we never actually met Rose and Glen, our late night arrival and five day stay went very smoothly. They were always available by phone, but the place was set up some well that their assistance was not needed in anyway. They did leave a message the first morning of our stay recommending that we visit the Fremont Market which we did.

Along with being a cozy house in funky Fremont, it is quite private. You enter up a long driveway and the back deck is surrounded by bamboo and a side garden. 

The house is nicely decorated and has all that you need. My wife and I and our ten-month old stayed upstairs and my dad stayed in the basement bedroom. We all had plenty of space.

Oh, and the water pressure in the shower easily worked out all the travel kinks. And any lingering tension he jacuzzi on the deck pretty much melted.

The house is walking distance to many restaurants and the Burke Gilman Trail along the canal.

Good place. Good hosts. We'd stay there again. Recommended.
"
219532,6825505,2013-08-26,7977009,Karen,"Had a great time at Rose and Glen's house in Fremont - it was exactly where we needed to be and had all the comforts of home!  The hot tub was exactly what the doctor ordered after some hiking at Mt. Rainier and the outdoor space couldn't beat!

We never got to meet Rose and Glen in person, but they were excellent hosts - responsive to any questions we had!"
219532,7201100,2013-09-10,5101555,William,"We loved the place! The home was in spectacular condition and had everything we needed. We found it to be much larger than we thought it would be too!

The hot tub is a fantastic plus and we spend almost all our time on that huge deck. We will try to go again soon. "
219532,13329642,2014-05-25,3372230,Jeremy,"A great little home. It worked out perfectly. The house was comfortable, clean, and well equipped. The hosts have clearly taken the time to set the place up for a great airbnb experience. Nothing left to be desired. I just wish I'd had more time to enjoy the deck and grounds."
219532,13975551,2014-06-09,14814430,Alexander,"This was our first experience with AirBnB, and it was a very positive one. Glenn was very accommodating of us, and was kind enough to come by a couple if hours before the check-in time to meet us.

We travelled with two kids, aged two and six, and the place worked out very well. Enough space to use as a base camp and for everyone to have their own room. We were also an easy walk to a playground and also close to a number of restaurants without being in the thick of the Fremont nightlife.

We travelled without a cat, and this place worked out well for us. It is one block away from two frequent service bus lines and a short walk from a grocery store. There is also a very convenient biking/walking path, for those who bring their bikes.

In summary, great place, great host, highly recommended."
219532,14387064,2014-06-18,2503399,Kandice,Rose and Glen were excellent hosts and have a wonderful house.  The house is just as described.  We had 6 adults on our trip and fit perfectly.  This Fremont house is in a perfect area for sight-seeing around Seattle.  It was easily within walking distance to many major sights or within a quick cab ride to the downtown/Capitol Hill area.  Fremont itself is a great neighborhood...so much to see and do there!
219532,14684528,2014-06-24,13976991,Yarry,"Our family quite enjoyed Glen and Rose's Fun Funky Home in Fremont Seattle!  When we arrived the house was in excellent order, the beds made, and the overall home had a welcoming, lived-in-but-well-cared-for feel to it.  I was travelling with my wife, my two daughters, and my wife's mother.  There was plenty of room for all of us, between the two bedrooms and the fold out hide-a-bed in the office area.

The house is a little hard to find, in that its behind another house, which was not evident from the picture.  Trust your map application though, you can find it!  It is on the edge of Fremont, but an easy 5 minuter walk to downtown.  We came for the Fremont Fair, and this house was the perfect launch point to enjoy the festivities.

Overall, I would whole heartedly recommend Glen and Rose's hospitality to anyone without reservation.  Glen personally came and welcomed us to the house, walking through things with us and giving us a little history of the neighborhood and what not.  I found him to be a very engaging, fun host."
219532,15047505,2014-07-01,15647184,Barb,"We loved the house. Flowers were beautiful. Rose and Glenn were very responsive when there was a problem with dishwasher. The hot tub was super fantastic. Our only concern was not realizing the height for getting into bathtub as one of our group had some disabilities and could not use the tub. Other than that, it was a great home away from home. "
219532,15531215,2014-07-11,2200431,Debra,"Our experience with the host was efficient.  The home was just as described, met our needs, and was quite conveniently located.  I'm used to a little more details being provided by the host like how to operate various things around the house, house rules, etc. so as a guest we don't screw anything up unintentionally.
Other than that we had a great time in Fremont and I would request Rose & Glen's home again but probably for a smaller number of people :)
Thanks!!"
219532,15686247,2014-07-14,748418,Jared & Katie,"We wanted a place that was near Ballard, but easy enough to get downtown without too much hassle... and we found it. Glen and Rose were great. Easy to communicate with, flexible with timing (our arrival time was dependent on rush-hour traffic), and available just in case we needed them. We had a great stay! "
219532,15925159,2014-07-18,436773,Sonya,"The house was very clean and nicely updated.  It was the perfect size for our family of two adults and two teens.  We enjoyed dining and hanging out on the deck and used the hot tub every day.  The neighborhood has lots of great restaurants (loved Cafe Turko), breweries (Fremont Brewing), and coffeehouses.  The famous Burke-Gilman bike trail is only two blocks away, and downtown Seattle is easily accessible by bus.   The only unhappy surprise was considerable traffic noise from Leary Street.  You can't hear it inside but will definitely notice on the deck and in the backyard. However we would gladly stay here again- the traffic noise was minor compared with all the other aspects of our enjoyable stay.  "
219532,16771608,2014-08-02,1291376,Mahina,"Rose & Glen were great hosts.  Thanks for letting us stay in your home!

Great location, comfortable home.  Altogether a great experience and would stay at their home again next time in Seattle.

"
219532,16980366,2014-08-05,15752901,Susan,Rose and Glenn are helpful responsive and terrific hosts. 
219532,17259515,2014-08-10,11820573,Paul,"We arrived after about sixteen hours in transit and Glen was at the property to greet and show us around which was much appreciated. This old house has a lot of character and has clearly been a labour of love for Glen and Rose. It would rate as  'well loved' in UK parlance.The property is well equipped. There is a large deck at the back and a hot tub, which we made full use of. In terms of location, the Burke-Gilman trail is a few minutes walk and you can use this as an alternative route into Fremont, the main route being Leary Way, a busy four lane road which the deck partly overlooks. Consequently there is road noise during working hours but inside the house you don't hear it at all. Fremont is only ten minutes walk and buses 28 or 40 stop on Leary Way taking you downtown in 20-25 minutes. Probably the only change we would make is a visitor information pack about basic domestic appliances and local travel/restaurants but most people will work things out pretty easily. A tip for UK families with teens, the USA licensing laws prevent sale of alcohol to under 21s and this rules out meals at many establishments. Norm's Diner along Leary is an option. If you visit the Locks we liked Bitteroot a small bar in Ballard where again under 21s can dine with parents enjoying a beer. Overall we enjoyed our four days stay. Thanks again."
219532,17707150,2014-08-16,18980977,Jonathan,"We really enjoyed this place.  It was nice, clean, and private.  Rose and Glen were very welcoming and informative.  It is really convenient to have recycling at the house.  The hot tub worked just fine.  We liked the coffee shop across the way that we could walk to.  We would stay here again if we had the chance and would recommend to our friends.  "
219532,18398150,2014-08-26,14792609,Diane,"Rose & Glen's house is wonderful.  It was exactly as advertised - charming and fun.  Our five adults were very comfortable and happy there for 10 days.  The large and secluded deck is the perfect hang-out spot.  The location is prime:  walking distance to all the cool stuff Fremont has to offer and with easy access to downtown, UW, and highways that take you to beautiful hiking and other outdoor activities all around the area.  I'm really glad we chose Rose and Glen's house."
219532,20157596,2014-09-24,1763789,David,"The place was everything we hoped for, great location  near Fremont and Ballard, the hosts were great very helpful came to meet us a little early as we needed to get to an appointment soon after arriving.  "
219532,20436148,2014-09-29,20629607,Evan,"Great house, everything we had hoped for.  Rose and Glen were very helpful and responsive. Neighborhood is excellent and shops and restaurants are walking distance from the house.   I would definitely stay in one of their properties again. "
219532,22144248,2014-10-31,21377707,Lis,"We rented this house for a month while we were looking for a house to buy.  The hosts are super friendly and met with us on our first day to show us how to use all of the appliances and stuff.  The house itself is cute with a big queen bedroom in the basement, a queen bedroom on the first floor, and an office / full bedroom on the first floor.  The kitchen is super well stocked with equipment.  They even had a cupcake pan so we could make cupcakes for my sons birthday!  The outdoor grill area and deck is awesome when it is not raining.  It is a very close walk to lots of restaurants, bars, and shops.  The only annoying thing is that the house is located off of a steep driveway.  It takes some practice to back down it confidently.  But if you are totally freaked out by that there is a lot of street parking.  And being off of the street makes the house quieter, so we really didn't mind.  One of our favorite things about the house is that they have a great picture of the house from the early 1900s when it was sitting all by itself.  It makes you feel like you are tied into Seattle history.  We would definitely recommend this house to our friends or rent it again ourselves!"
219532,26636458,2015-02-16,27134704,Jason,"Great location. Walking distance to the heart of Fremont. (Runners/Walkers be sure and check out the Burke Gillman trail.) 

The house is comfy with a nice covered deck and an outdoor kitchen. And we really enjoyed having the hot tub to soak in each day after exploring Seattle. "
219532,34552449,2015-06-09,2756180,Clint,It was a great location near downtown Seattle and our family who live in the Fremont district. The host greeted us upon arrival and was very friendly.
219532,35066579,2015-06-15,28295186,Carmi,"The hosts, Rose and Glen were very responsive.  The neighborhood was great.  It was nice to be able to park our car in the driveway.  Loved sitting out on the patio best of all.  Beds were comfortable.  Easy walk to downtown Fremont.  We would stay there again."
219532,35990613,2015-06-23,1676759,Jaime,"wonderful! the house was beautiful and relaxing, and the location was perfect. Glen & Rose was accommodating and friendly. Highly recommended place to stay! We really enjoyed it."
219532,37318011,2015-07-06,29815127,Dianna,"I stayed in Rose and Glen's house for a week with my husband, 2 young children and my parents. The house was plenty big enough for us all and the outside deck was perfect for BBQs and relaxing evenings. Rose and Glen were very welcoming and quick to respond to our questions. They gave us helpful advice on the area and how best to enjoy the 4th July fireworks. It was a short walk to shops and restaurants of Fremont and there was a handy bus stop to take us downtown. Overall we really enjoyed our stay here and would recommend it."
219532,38260601,2015-07-14,30834334,Amy,"This was my first airbnb experience, and it was wonderful. The house was adorable, and the location was great. Lots of great restaurants in walking distance. I didn't want to leave!"
219532,38524776,2015-07-16,35821266,Negla,Rose and glen were the perfect hosts. They were easy to reach and very helpful. The neighborhood was great and the listing was described perfectly! 
219532,39007424,2015-07-20,29706449,Jennifer,"My family and I stayed at Rose & Glen's Fremont home, and we had a wonderful experience. The home looked exactly as shown online. It was clean, roomy for 5 adults, and well equipped. It's in a great, safe  location with many restaurants nearby. The drive to the city was about 10 min. We would definitely stay in their home again!"
219532,39925495,2015-07-27,5362149,Emily,We loved our stay in Rose and Glen's beautiful home! The location is perfect and we spent lots of evenings on the patio. Our hosts were very easy to reach whenever we had questions. We hope to be back!
219532,42516297,2015-08-14,32008004,Patrick,Glen and Rose were awesome! They knew all about the Fremont and Seattle area (and its history) and gave us some good tips on places to visit. The home was nice and clean when we arrived. The back porch was a great place to relax!
219532,44916515,2015-08-30,10112656,Rachael,"rose and glen were incredible hosts. we absolutely loved their charming home in Fremont. the beds were cozy and the neighborhood had a lot of fun spots for coffee, food, etc. "
219532,45938155,2015-09-07,2055422,Nathan,Rose & Glen's house in Fremont was great! The house was just what me and my five friends needed while travelling. It was centrally located and had plenty of space for our short stay. The patio was also great for relaxing in our down time!
219532,48733616,2015-09-28,2085433,Ted,"Great spot in one of the funkiest and fun neighborhoods in Seattle!  Glen and Rose were very easy to deal with and everything was ""as advertised"".  All restaurants, pubs, and coffee shops were a very close walking distance away, and would recommend Roxy's for breakfast.  We'd definitely stay here again, it was much more fun than a boring old hotel!  Thanks again Rose & Glen, hopefully we can make it down to one of your places in Costa Rica sometime...  "
7074024,45090883,2015-08-31,36859061,Joe,Daniel is a fantastic host and the roommates at the house are very welcoming.  The location ended up being perfect for me as it made UW and local parks extremely accessible by walking or bus...   Big thanks to Daniel for all the suggestions for cool stuff to do!  I highly recommend the house to anyone else looking to experience Seattle.
7074024,48718061,2015-09-28,26875897,Ruth,"Daniel was a very friendly host who always had suggestions on what to do and see in Seattle that week. The house was located in a beautiful suburban neighborhood, close to bus routes and a 10 minute walk to get groceries. The room was spacious and well-lit with easy access to the bathroom and kitchen. One downside would be the noise level due to creaking stairs and doors closing, etc. Would not be a great fit for light. Overall, nice room, very friendly roommates, and great location."
7074024,55396665,2015-12-01,16546222,Tim,"I had a great time at this house. The host was very awesome and even helped me with my bags as I moved into my private room. He showed me around the house and even told me the spots to hit up while I was there. He also showed me some of other room mates,  who were also really awesome! The house and the room were clean and the wireless internet was very fast. The host will also send me messages on the weekend on the cool events that are happening around town. He was definitely the coolest host that I've stayed with."
7074024,56282532,2015-12-11,6933505,Colton,"Great host! He was super helpful and checked in with me often. The room was great! Everything I needed and in a prime location. 

Definitely worth it! "
8119192,45544738,2015-09-03,39637466,Ford,"Missy and John were really great people and had a gorgeous downstairs private suite, with our own bedroom and bathroom. We stayed for two nights and they gave us privacy when we wanted but I also had awesome conversations with both of them! They offered to give me tips on where to eat and what to check out. The house was in a great location very close to Ballard. I highly recommend staying there! "
8119192,46964818,2015-09-14,32633539,Rafael,"Spacious, clean, and welcoming environment. Melissa is a fantastic host that makes you feel at home. Close access to buses, shops, and restaurants. "
8119192,47209998,2015-09-16,18999479,Stumptown,"We loved this place! Plenty spacious and Melissa was so great with giving us different things to do in the city and making sure that we were absolutely enamored with our stay. I have nothing but good things to say about this place, but if you are over 6'4"", then the roof is a little low."
8119192,51033631,2015-10-17,43228631,Rico,"Melissa and John were excellent hosts! My family and I moved to Seattle a month ago to search for an apartment in the long term and found this gem in the middle of Greenwood. We stayed one month at John and Melissa's place and greatly enjoyed our time there! 

The neighborhood is quiet, safe, family-friendly and close to a lot of parks and some restaurants (make sure to stop by Chuck's Hop Shop which is only a few blocks away!). It's also a great location to further explore Seattle. Bus #28 brings you directly to Seattle downtown and the Space Needle (via Ballard and Queen Anne Hill). It runs frequently and only takes about 20 minutes to get to downtown. Another bus line a few blocks south (#48) goes to the University of Washington and Capitol Hill. 

The room has its own private entrance, is very clean, spacious and filled with light (which is important in Seattle with its sometimes gloomy weather during fall and winter). Bed and sofa are very comfortable; you have WiFi in the room. Microwave, coffeemaker and dishes are new and everything looks very clean.  

Most importantly, you will enjoy the great hospitality of Melissa and John (who live upstairs) -- they were very welcoming, accommodating and supportive and gave us a lot of helpful suggestions regarding the neighborhood and living in Seattle. Again, we had an excellent time and loved this place! Many thanks!"
8119192,51243358,2015-10-18,46542556,Mallory,"Melissa has a wonderful place, and was extremely accommodating.  The separate entrance is a great feature to the space, we did not have to bother the family upstairs. The bed is comfortable and the space was large enough for myself and 3 friends. There is a nice refrigerator, microwave and dishes for us to eat with, as well as a table and chairs. 
Melissa is a very kind person and was willing to help us out if we needed anything during our stay, I wish we could have stayed longer! "
8119192,52271042,2015-10-27,28593213,Mark,"Melissa was very friendly and welcoming. She communicated with us quickly and effectively beforehand, so everything went really well. The bed was comfortable, the heat adjustable, and the wifi straightforward. We had no problem finding on-street parking immediately outside. We will recommend this place to others and would stay here again."

3344977,15656239,2014-07-13,17675218,Sean,"The room was exactly as advertised.  It was very clean and well taken care of.  Alex and Wei (hope I'm spelling that right) were great hosts and really left it up to me how much I interacted with them.  They gave me a key and the room has it's own entrance so there's as much privacy as you need.  They were more than willing to help me out with any requests like places I could eat.  There's a great QFC 24 hr grocery store about 3 minutes walking distance and great shops around on market st.  On the way out, I left very early 5AM, but even so Alex made sure to be up to see me out.  Very friendly and welcoming hosts! I would definitely consider staying here again if I end up back out in Seattle."
3344977,15789001,2014-07-15,12164118,Jennifer,"We had a great stay here. Alex and Wei were very inviting hosts. The room and bathroom were very clean. The room felt very private since it had its own entrance and was quite separate from the rest of the home. We also enjoyed the proximity to Ballard restaurants, shops and bars. Thanks so much! "
3344977,16309805,2014-07-25,17131608,Matthew,This place was great. Nice and quiet. Easy for parking. The private access to the room was a real advantage. I highly recommend the hosts and the room.

3344977,16646072,2014-07-30,18990955,Tom,"This was a great stay for me.  The room was private with its own entrance.  The room was clean, it is exactly what you see online.  Soap and shampoo were provided in the bathroom.  Two bottles of drinking water were also in the room for guest.  I had to park my rental car over night in an unrestricted street parking.  Overall, the area seem to be safe  which also have a 24-hours supermarket and Starbucks coffee within walking distance.  The host was very friendly.  I wasn't sure if she was just happened to be out front when I arrived, or if she wanted to help me find the house.  It made me feel quite welcome went she greeted me in front of her home.  I'd reserve this room again if I'm ever in the area."
3344977,16739064,2014-08-01,18168584,Molly,"It was a nice space with a private entrance, and personal bathroom. The place was located north of downtown, with a convenient bus route to downtown nearby. It was about a 40 min bus ride to downtown, but less than 5 mins away from Fremount and Ballard. There is a great Puerto Rican restaurant called La Isla and a french bakery Cafe Besalu within walking distance. "
3344977,16913676,2014-08-04,9123366,Joy,The room was exactly as described and depicted. Immaculate and well-appointed. Alex was very accessible and Wei was most welcoming. I highly recommend their airBnB!

Highly recommended for short staying in Seattle."
3344977,17850498,2014-08-18,4872264,Susan,"I was most welcomed by Wei and shown my room, etc. I love the private entry and private bath. This room was in a perfect location for the event I was attending. I had everything I needed: comfy bed, desk, chair, etc just as you see in the picture. The only contact I had with the hosts was at my arrival, but I was able to easily contact them if I needed to. I can't wait to stay here on my next visit to Seattle."
3344977,18418219,2014-08-26,6212376,Isabel,"Though we didn't meet Alex, Wei was very welcoming and considerate. Everything we needed was already included in the room (blow dryer, shampoo, towels, water, hangers etc). The room itself is very private, with a side entrance and private washroom with shower. The bed was big and comfortable. Everything was spotlessly clean! The best stay we've had with an Airbnb host so far. We'd love to stay here again."
3344977,19340680,2014-09-10,3742049,Warren,"This stay exceeded our expectations.  Alex and his wife were very nice, and welcomed us warmly.  They have smartly sectioned off the lower bedroom and bathroom and it really feels like you have a nice space to yourself with plenty of privacy.   The location is also excellent, you are just steps away from all of the awesome things in downtown Ballard.  Stay here, you won't be disappointed!"
3344977,19626933,2014-09-15,3857778,Justin,Hosts were great and the room was just as advertised.  I would not hesitate to rent their room in the future should I be going back to SEattle

Their room is exactly like it is shown in the pictures and it has it's own private entrance which makes it easy to come and go as we pleased.  The location could not be beat, it is located a quick walk away from the main drag in Ballard.  Lots of bars and restaurants in the area.  Alex and Wie were both friendly and made sure that we had everything needed for our stay.  We definitely recommend anyone to stay at their home."
3344977,21152032,2014-10-12,2778675,Mark,"We stayed at Alex's place for 2 nights in October to attend a wedding nearby. It is an incredibly convenient location, practically a 2 min walk to all the shops, restaurants, and cafes in downtown Ballard, but still located on a quiet side street. If you don't feel like renting a car, there is also a lot of cheap public transportation nearby (by bus, it's about 30 mins to downtown Seattle, and about 90 mins to airport). Even for a whole weekend, we felt there was so much to do and see in Ballard that we mever left the area!

The room was cozy and comfy, we had our own bathroom, and everything was clean and simple. Alex was very friendly and courteous. We would highly recommend this place for anyone traveling to Seattle!"

The separate entrance was a plus.  Coordination w/ Alex was quick and easy.  His wife welcomed me upon my arrival and gave me keys and a quick tour.  After that, I was on my own.  Will definitely do a repeat should the occasion present itself. "

A great place to stay for sure.

She gave me an overview of the room and after that I did not see them. It was a very comfortable, private and close to everything in Ballard. I was able to walk to the grocery store and to breakfast close by each morning. I did not have the chance to meet Alex in-person, but he was in communication with me to set up the arrangements and was very helpful. The bedroom and bathroom were extremely clean and like new. I especially liked the private entrance to the room because it allowed me to come and go on my own time without disturbing them. I would certainly love to stay there again if I am ever in the area!"
3344977,27226102,2015-02-28,26739386,Kathie,"Very nice, very clean and comfortable place. Excellent location,  can walk everywhere."
3344977,28417397,2015-03-23,8466667,Dimitri,I stayed at Alex's place for 3 days and I had a great time. Street parking was available at anytime of the day within 2 min walking distance. Alex was available and made my stay more comfortable. The place was very quiet and having your own private entrance was practical. I would recommend staying at Alex and you are only 5 min away from the active part of the Ballard. 
3344977,28587958,2015-03-26,29292407,Kimo,"Accurate listing, very private and nice, helpful hosts.  "
3344977,29522741,2015-04-08,6642216,Michael,"Great place in Ballard! Super clean, private and very very walkable. 3-4 blocks from some of the best restaurants the area has to offer. Wei was very nice and welcoming when I came to pick up the key. The space was comfy and the bathroom is private which is great (just outside the bedroom in a small hallway). Will definitely stay again on my next trip to the area!"
3344977,29785451,2015-04-12,2687597,Marie-Liesse,"The house is extremely well located within minutes of Market Street and Ballard Street where all the restaurants/shops are. Ballard is a beautiful part of Seattle.
Good value for money for sure, everything was very clean. Coffee and tea in the room definitely a nice touch!
Would definitely stay there again."
3344977,30213204,2015-04-19,29223875,Angela,"Wow! The location was just wondeful. Perfect for our trip. We had a lot to see and Alex's place was ideal for a spot to regroup.

The bed was comfortable and clean. I loved the kitty tray t stress the location. Perfect."
3344977,30536969,2015-04-23,29292407,Kimo,"Another great stay at Alex's - very private, convenient and comfortable.  Exactly as desired and nice hosts as well."
3344977,30633043,2015-04-25,6148127,Deborah,"Alex & Wei's private room in the ground floor of their Ballard condo is as pictured - clean, well-appointed, and stylish. We were greeted by Wei who was very welcoming and made sure we had everything we needed.  The bed is extremely comfortable and the location is perfect--a quick walk to the best of Ballard eateries. Would definitely stay again!"
3344977,31853311,2015-05-10,10474670,Dan,"If you're interested in checking out Ballard and the rest of Seattle, stay with Alex! This private room is nicely separated from the rest of the home and made for a great stay. Alex has fantastic communication and made check in super easy. With the private entrance it felt like we had the place to ourselves! The only amenity ""missing"" was a mini fridge - but of course that is just personal preference. The location is PRIME and very close to Ballard shops and night life. You can even bike to the beach easily.  "
3344977,35964677,2015-06-23,27420509,Imee,"Had a lovely and comfortable stay at Alex and Wei's place! Alex replied to messages promptly. Met his wife, Wei, during check-in. Wei made check-in easy and showed us the space. Room and bathroom were clean and spacious. This was our first Airbnb experience and it was wonderful! My fiancé and I will actually be back for a second night this week after a short visit to Vancouver. "
3344977,36216244,2015-06-26,27420509,Imee,Our second stay at Alex's was great. We had the opportunity to check out the immediate area this time around - their place is within walking distance to many restaurants! Would recommend staying here! 
3344977,36410787,2015-06-28,34066411,Haksoo,"Just spent only one night. The private room was clean and very functional.  With coffee maker, we felt like in the hotel room.  The private room entrance is segregated so we don't have to worry about when we come in and go out.
The neighbor is quite and very close to many different stores (including Starbucks), all within in 4-8 minutes walking distance.
The host was very kind."
3344977,36738546,2015-06-30,36557476,Lily,"I was really pleased with this choice.  The room was separate from the house, giving you a little privacy.  The bed and bathroom was nice and clean and I felt really comfortable.  And it is not too far from downtown Seattle.  I would definitely recommend this place."
3344977,37866544,2015-07-11,6002233,Rebecca,"Very accurate description - no problems at all getting the keys, good communication throughout and wonderfully comfortable, clean room with private bathroom.
If I am in the area again, I wouldn't hesitate to book this place.  It's well located to DT Ballard and buses to DT Seattle, the hosts have left good local and regional maps in the room, plus a Seattle To Do guide.
Quiet, peaceful and a pleasure to come back to after a lovely day out in the city...it's a good size space and one doesn't feel cramped.
Internet access is easy - and there's a coffee machine plus microwave should you need it, with a large 24 hr supermarket a mere minutes away."
3344977,38241069,2015-07-13,29213635,Lydia,Everything was great and well organized. The neighborhood is pretty nice!
3344977,38838959,2015-07-19,12758636,Kimberly,"We just arrive home from our stay  in this private room just walking distance from Ballard. It is a perfect location and quiet and lovely. Our accommodations were spotless. Our hostess greeted us upon arrival, showed us around, assured us if we needed anything, to just ask.  We had coffee and microwave and mini-fridge in the room; crisp clean towels and great bath products in our private bath. And we had our own private entrance! She even showed us the best way to walk to/from the wedding we were attending. And a GREAT grocery store 1/2 block way for anything we needed!
It was a great place to stay and in my opinion, even better than represented! Thank you for a terrific overnight in Ballard, Seattle, WA!!
"
3344977,39405044,2015-07-23,36095382,Eric,Great experience. The room was clean and comfortable. We really appreciated the privacy of the room and the private bathroom. Thanks!
3344977,39943613,2015-07-27,6805310,Monica,This place was amazing! The location is very close to downtown Ballard. The mini fridge and microwave were very useful especially as there was a QFC close by. Everything was super clean and we felt very comfortable there. Would definitely stay there again!
3344977,41212090,2015-08-05,34994429,Emily,"We had such a lovely time in Seattle! Our stay at Alex's was perfect. She was very welcoming and accommodating (I arrived late due to a long hike and she was very understanding). The room was setup with guests in mind. Bathroom was spacious with new fixtures. It was very clean, and had all of the amenities that are listed. Honestly couldn't offer any suggestions as to how they could improve the room, bravo! 
Ballard is a nice neighborhood. It feels very safe and this place is in walking distance to Market where all the action happens. If we come back to Seattle we will absolutely be staying here again!"
3344977,41625789,2015-08-08,7754975,Sander,"Clean, basic room with great coffee for in the morning. Easy side acces to airbnb room and indoor acces to the bathroom. Friendly host who showed us everything in the house on arrival."
3344977,42257401,2015-08-12,32427780,Jack,"The room was nice and clean. The setting was quiet and the location was fantastic. The host was nice upon arrival, but was inflexible before arrival. If you offer to rent your space you should be flexible for a late arrival. Was given an ultimatum to stay out in the streets with luggage if I could not arrive by 4pm because they had plans. Was told I could only return after 9pm. I changed travel plans to arrive by 4pm and the host didn't leave until 5 pm. I was irritated with the inflexibility, but otherwise the place was nice."
3344977,42870493,2015-08-16,19071236,Shih-Hsuan,"Thanks Alex and Wan Ju for the host! We stayed in their place for three nights and it was such a great experience, above and beyond our expectations. The room was so clean and we got independent entrance and bathroom. And the house was sitting in a very convenient but quiet neighborhood. Alex and Wan Ju were so nice, hosting us like friends and made us feel very comfortable. We would definitely stay here again when next time visiting Seattle!"
3344977,43936120,2015-08-23,19192225,Stacy,"Very comfortable, clean, and quiet! The location is great,  easy to walk to many locations in Ballard."
3344977,45124195,2015-08-31,1099291,David,"This was our first Airbnb experience, and it was great. The room was very clean. The bed was comfortable. The wifi was solid. The water pressure in the shower was excellent. The bathroom was clean, and the towels were great. There was good shampoo and soap in the bathroom for us. There was ample closet space. We also really appreciated the maps and guides/pamphlets to the local area. "
3344977,45554066,2015-09-04,17261854,Sandra,"Very clean, organized and comfortable.  Location in a great neighborhood, convenient to restaurants and shops.  Great place for our one night stay over in Seattle.  "
3344977,46165131,2015-09-08,25715208,Daniel,"Staying at Alex's sweet home is definitely one of the highlights of my trip to Seattle. Alex & Wei are very considerate: The room is super clean and has everything I need for a short trip (Fridge, Microwave, Coffee machine, fast wifi & etc). They are very responsive too. Every time I sent them a message, they replied very quickly. 
The area is very safe and convenient - There are tons of street parking places and many choices of food. 
This is my first time using Airbnb and I was a little bit hesitant before, but not anymore! Thanks guys and hopefully I could stay at your place the next time I visit Seattle.
P.S. They could also speak Mandarin, so feel free to speak in Mandarin if you prefer."
3344977,46900290,2015-09-14,35908831,Chelsea,"This was my very first experience with Airbnb, and Alex and Wei made it better than I could have imagined. Their home is conveniently located near TONS of restaurants/bars/stores in Ballard; we were able to walk almost everywhere we wanted to go. And yet, the neighborhood is not busy and very quiet!

The room and bathroom is extremely clean and private. Our bed was very comfortable. There is a mini refrigerator available, desk space, a Keurig with coffee and utensils provided. They left us plenty of information about the Seattle area regarding things to do. Wei let us know to text them if we needed anything, and provided us with a key for our own private entrance when we arrived.

I will not hesitate to stay with Alex and Wei when I return to this area. It was more pleasant and simpler than staying at a hotel, and Alex and Wei are accommodating hosts. Thank you both, and thanks Airbnb! "
3344977,47647325,2015-09-21,37097166,Carree,"This was my first time using Airbnb and I was very pleased with the experience. The room was perfect for what I needed and the neighborhood had a lot to offer for restaurants, shopping, and more.

The room was clean and offered privacy both in sleeping and bathroom accommodations.

I was scheduled to arrive late anyway and then my flight was delayed. I informed Alex early in the day about my flight and he was very understanding and said he would stay up until I arrived. If I ever need to stay in Seattle again I wouldn't have any second thoughts about staying here."
3344977,48701703,2015-09-28,20625258,Krystal,"Loved this place! The place comes with its own private entrance, spacious room, and private bathroom. The room was nice and clean and there was pretty much everything we needed there! One big thing was, they even have a heater for you for the night time when it gets cold. That was awesome. The location is conveniently located to a market and some other stores as well. Defs would recommend this place and would come back here to stay if I'm ever visiting Seattle again!"
3344977,49534672,2015-10-04,219429,Halli,"Alex's suite in Seattle's Ballard neighbourhood is simple, clean and very private.  For any queries, Alex was super responsive via text. The suite itself is literally steps from so many restaurants, pubs, and even a pie bar (it's exactly what you'd imagine - we had dinner there one night!)  A super fun neighbourhood, and the #40 bus is also only a block away which goes through Fremont all the way to downtown quite quickly.

We loved staying in the neighbourhood and had a very seamless stay in Alex's suite. If you're planning to stay here, know that you will have a private place to call home for the duration of your stay with exactly what you need but not much more."
3344977,50604053,2015-10-12,2860736,Jonah,"Alex was a fantastic and accommodating host and a really nice guy.  This location could not be better--a very safe and quiet neighborhood with readily available parking, and a short walk to some of the best restaurants and sights in town.  Incredibly clean and well equipped room.  Could not have had a better experience."
3344977,51883523,2015-10-25,8958256,Brian,"This was the perfect location in Ballard. Clean, quiet, everything as advertised!"
3678718,17732232,2014-08-16,18270648,Janna,We had such a great time staying at this air bnb. The spot was perfect! It really is in the heart of Ballard. It was very easy to find and the hosts were very helpful. Lots of room and a giant kitchen to cook in. We couldn't have asked for anything better. 
3678718,17907499,2014-08-18,19927366,Rob,"Great location in the heart of Ballard. Very private, parking was easy. It's a unique space in the basement of a beautiful old building. Quirky decorations from the 70's, a selection of books and games to entertain you and wifi. Host was friendly and easy to work with. It was a little dark and musty but that's to be expected for a Seattle basement, we had a great time."
3678718,18038600,2014-08-20,10732530,Sarah Jo,"We had a lovely time staying at Odd Lodging in Ballard. The space is clean and comfortable, and has a quirky vintage vibe. Location can't be beat, and Sandy was extremely friendly and quick to respond with any questions. I would absolutely book again, thanks for a fantastic stay! "
3678718,18360811,2014-08-25,2089291,Ryan,"Nora and Odd Lodging made staying with them super easy! Check in and check out were coordinated directly with us. The lodging was very comfortable. Super quite off the alley. Short cab ride to down town. The Ballard neighborhood has many great restaurants and bars. Kayaking Puget Sound, and the locks are a short walk down the road. Cool cafes near by as well. Thanks for letting us stay with you guys!"
3678718,18503785,2014-08-27,20244372,Anthony,"Clean, cozy and quiet. Great neighborhood. Exactly what we were looking for."
3678718,18601378,2014-08-28,2530401,John,"We had a great stay in a great neighborhood. Nora was very helpful.  It is an unorthodox venue, but worked very well for us.  The only changes I would make: Provide coffee and soap."
3678718,18905129,2014-09-02,2949508,Aiko,"Great location in a great neighborhood. It has a fully equipped kitchen, so you can cook a small meal if you get tired of eating out. Nora was quick and helpful in responding to all queries. Would have been good if the internet signal was stronger, but otherwise, our stay was super comfortable! Thanks for having us guys!"
3678718,19093066,2014-09-06,19875750,Michael,We had a wonderful stay. Great location. We were able to walk to so many great restaurants. Downtown was just a short bus ride away. We would definitely stay again. 
3678718,19429935,2014-09-12,20536334,Celine,"The Odd Lodging was a great place to stay! Perfect location, very close to public transit (which was good, since we had no car). Plenty of space and a cool vibe. We loved exploring Ballard and the rest of the city. The kitchen was fully equipped and the hosts very friendly, helpful, and knowledgeable. Overall a great experience!"
3678718,19566101,2014-09-14,20958012,Kate,"The Ballard Odd Fellows Lodge, our host Martha, and the Ballard neighborhood were wonderful!  This was a great place to stay - we loved being right in the heart of Ballard, within easy walking distance to a lot of cool stuff (a great brunch spot, the locks, cafes, breweries).  We could not believe how large the apartment was for the price.  Martha was so welcoming and accommodating; she even gave us a tour of the Odd Fellows building and shared some of the history.  Staying at the Odd Fellows Lodge was a great part of our trip to Seattle and we'll look it up again the next time we are there! 
"
3678718,19959746,2014-09-21,10211958,Daniel,"Really loved staying at Odd Lodging!  Such a nice little apartment, charming and unique with all the amenities you'd want in a private studio (though really even more than a studio since the kitchen and bedroom are pretty much their own rooms too!) Not to mention you're right in the middle of a great neighborhood with lots of fun shops, bars, and restaurants.

Martha was incredibly helpful and responsive to any questions we had.  A real pleasure and highly recommended! "
3678718,20471593,2014-09-29,9185705,Tod,"Definitely worth it  The apartment is clean and welcoming. Remember, it's the old caretaker's spot in the back of an Odd Fellows Lodge, not a Hilton. So you need to be someone who appreciates quirky local history to get the most out of this place. But, if you don't, you will like the kitchen and the fact that you're a three minute walk from a fantastic market. 
> Host was super friendly, attended to everything. 
> Again, this is an 'odd' place, best-suited to those who prefer urban adventure to packaged experiences. If you love Dwell Magazine, you should probably consider an artsy little loft instead. But if you like vinyl records (there's a shop attached) and spaces that have an authentic patina, you'll love it here.
> Would I stay here again? You bet. Absolutely. "
3678718,21145282,2014-10-12,19161148,Robert,"This was my first experience with airbnb, and this was a great place to stay.  It was clean, and had everything you need for a comfortable stay.  If you're looking for simple and comfy, this is the place.  The Ballard area is filled with restaurants and bars.  I didn't really use the kitchen, but everything is there if you want to cook your own meals.  There's a Safeway two blocks away, and a Whole Foods a short bus ride away on the D line."
3678718,21363815,2014-10-15,12161959,Sarah,This place was super cute and located in a great neighborhood! Great restaurants and bars nearby and really nice to come back in the evenings to a place with such privacy! Very welcoming hosts... We look forward to staying here again.
3678718,21629066,2014-10-20,7376623,Connie,"The Odd Lodging was so convenient to everything in Ballard. Nora was great! Very accommodating, she walked me through directions from the airport and met me when I arrived in Ballard. Lodging is laid back, if you are looking for a Hilton with room service, this probably isn't the place for you. The apartment was clean and stocked with everything you might need. There is convenient parking in the rear of the building for $5.00 a day. I loved the location on Market St. and will definitely consider staying there again when I return to Ballard.

"
3678718,21784482,2014-10-24,1469929,Laura,"The Oddfellows Lodge apartment is in the perfect spot for everything. Close to bars and restaurants, easy to hop on public transit. 

The space itself, though on a lower level, is homey and more welcoming than I expected from the pics. Comfy bed, lots of room for stuff and for lounging around. The entry is around the back and has a secure gate.

Communications were super easy and friendly. All in all, a great stay! Thanks!"
3678718,22604707,2014-11-10,2568179,Sarah,"We really enjoyed our stay. The apartment was very cozy even in chilly Nov. We were so glad we chose  to stay in Ballard. It's a great neighborhood with so many restaurants, bars, coffee shops and cute shops we were never bored. "
3678718,22876825,2014-11-16,18777703,Liana,We loved the charming one bedroom apartment on the first floor of the Ballard Odd Fellows Lodge! The location is amazing - steps to tons of bars and restaurants as well as transit access. The kitchen is fully stocked with any tool you need to make a feast. The outdoor hallway was mostly private and a nice area to hang out in as well. We will definitely stay there next time we're in Seattle!
3678718,23338474,2014-11-29,6532581,Finbar,This was perfect spot for me. Everything was clean and fucntional and the place is a bit bigger than the photos suggest. It has a full kitchen if you want to cook but being so close to lots of Ballard's delicious restuarants I didn't bother much. Nora was very easy to communicate with and she gave me a tour of the Lodge on arriving. An interesting building.
3678718,23579658,2014-12-05,23591783,Charles,"The room was located in a good area and our host was very friendly and gave us a tour of the lodge. The room had all the basics except coffee, the water was hot, and the internet was fast. The street parking was close and free after 6pm and there are coffee shops and bars nearby. The window coverings were see-through though, so it was not as private as I would have liked. If you're shy you'll want to change in the bathroom and if you want to get romantic, this is not the place for you. There were events being hosted upstairs, but we were forewarned of this and none ran later than 10pm."
3678718,23665111,2014-12-07,24348310,James,"It's a great place to stay; Good location, lots of privacy, and good value for an apartment-like space."
3678718,24271623,2014-12-24,4550247,Sheri & Eric,"The Odd Fellows Apartment was great! It is located within walking distance to every place we wanted to go-restaurants, retail stores, grocery store, movie theater, and coffee shops. We felt that the apartment was very private despite other reviewers that mentioned the shear curtains. There are no other tenants in the building, however there are occasional meetings/gatherings upstairs. There was plenty of free street parking and the pay parking lot is located outside the entrance to the apartment ($5/day). We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and will definitely stay here again! "
3678718,24652794,2015-01-01,14248514,Tyler,"Fantastic accommodations. Great location near downtown Ballard. Extremely quiet and spacious, coupled with a great price. One of the best airbnbs I've ever stayed at..would stay here again in a heartbeat. "
3678718,25324846,2015-01-12,17367728,Morgan,"Odd and amazing! This little nest was perfect for our trip! The kitchen is well stocked, the furniture was beautiful, eclectic and very comfortable, and the space allowed for entertaining our friends. The lodge is beautiful and a gem in Ballard. We will be back!"
3678718,25781389,2015-01-25,26565443,Scott,"Description is very accurate, great little spot to spread out in the heart of Ballard.  Would absolutely stay here again."
3678718,25967771,2015-01-31,15187859,ChrisTiana,"This is an amazing space, and it's in the middle of everything. The soaking tub is to die for, and I was appreciative of how stocked the kitchen was. Of course, it's always good to find a green friendly space in Seattle. The only con is that the lodge can be a little noisy. There was a night that they were banging around way past midnight. But the coziness of the space made up for it for sure. A+"
3678718,26698031,2015-02-17,8860931,Jonathan,"Our host let us in with open arms. Odd Lodge has such an amazing history to it and fun style that dates all the back to 1906, and we first walked in we got the grand tour of the entire building and a pitcher of homemade kombucha. 
Ballard is the place to be. Our room was walking distance for so many bars, breweries, restaurants, shops, etc. If you want to go across town the bus stop is about a block away. Would 100% stay here again and recommend it to everyone!    "
3678718,26956363,2015-02-22,22464021,Haylee,This place was fantastic! My boyfriend and I thoroughly enjoyed our stay in the private little abode. The apartment is within walking distance of plenty of things to do around town and made us truly fall in love with Seattle. We will be back again!
3678718,27283672,2015-03-01,9271454,Molly,"We loved the Odd Lodging at the Odd Fellows Lodge in Ballard! Such a cute apartment and with plenty of desk space for the work that always needs to be done even on vacation. We didn't get to use the kitchen because Ballard has so many wonderful cafes, pubs, and coffee houses, but we plan to come back and stay for longer visits in the future and it is great that it has a fully stocked kitchen. Just a stop at TJs and dinner is served. Loved the great selection in the bookshelves. If it rains next visit, I will be curled up with a book on the comfy couch."
3678718,27725404,2015-03-10,17644167,Alexander,"If you are visiting Seattle, specifically Ballard, The Odd Fellows Lodging is an absolute dream. Nora was incredible sweet, accommodating and quick to respond to any texts we sent her. We are pretty private, so we had minimal interaction with anyone at the lodge, which we appreciate, however, it seemed Nora would be happy to be more involved should we have needed. 
The apartment is super cute and vintage-y vibe, which was exactly our style. There is a pretty private entrance in the back through a locked gate. It was left for us super clean with all we could need. The kitchen is fully stocked with tools, should you wish to cook there, and the bathroom had fresh towels and toiletries. THE BED IS THE MOST COMFORTABLE THING WE HAVE EVER SLEPT ON. It was hard to get out of it sometimes! Some people mention the see-through curtains which I don't think were an issue or that see-through at all. 
The best part about this apartment is it's location. It is perfectly placed in Ballard by all the incredible bars and restaurants of Market and Ballard Ave. We walked everywhere with ease. There is a bus stop right by it though, if you prefer that. 
We will absolutely be back in the summer to stay with the Odd Fellows. I can not recommend this place enough.
"
3678718,27864035,2015-03-13,2734499,Jason,Warm welcome. Great space. Fantastic location. Clean! Secure! Good wifi! I will stay again and highly recommend. 
3678718,27958990,2015-03-15,16479026,Mary,"We had a good experience staying at Odd Lodging. I briefly met our host but primarily communicated with her through text messages. She quickly responded to my questions and requests. We were very happy with both her hospitality and sense to respect our privacy. 

The room itself was cute. It is tucked away in the back alley behind a store front, and is just below ground level (there are windows that are at ground level). Everything was clean when we arrived and the space had a nice, homey feel. 

Ballard was a nice neighborhood to stay in. There are many bars are restaurants on the main street, and the Odd Lodging is only about 5 minutes away from a bus stop that will take you right downtown (to most tourist spots). We happened to have a car, but you could easily get around the city without one.

The only downside of our stay at the Odd Lodging was that the actual lodge hosted a party above the room we were staying one night. Our host advised us of the party before we arrived, and we didn't think it would be a problem since we were planning to go bar-hopping that night anyways. Unfortunately, by boyfriend came down with the stomach flu that afternoon so we were stuck listening to loud music and shaking floors until well past midnight. I don't blame our host for this bad experience at all...she definitely gave us fair warning of the party. However,  anyone looking to stay here should be aware that this may not be the best place for peace and quiet. "
3678718,28408272,2015-03-23,4807388,Stephen,"The place was great! Nora gave us a tour of the building and was very welcoming. This looks like it will be my ""go-to"" place to say in Seattle!"
3678718,28591964,2015-03-26,2781248,Tyler,"This place was a great find! The apartment is clean, comfy and right in the middle of Ballard, which made it incredibly easy to get anywhere. I will gladly stay here again when I'm back in Seattle."
3678718,28668747,2015-03-28,17350612,L Kevin,The Odd Fellows lodge is a perfect location for exploring Ballard and the surrounding metropolitan Seattle area. It met our needs and then some. Highly recommended!
3678718,28893754,2015-03-31,20825200,Tracy,"We used to live in Seattle, so we were excited to come for a visit and stay in the thriving, vibrant Ballard neighborhood. The apartment is artistic, fun, inviting and very comfortable! It was great to have a full kitchen and living room seperated from the from the bedroom. The host included everything needed to prepare meals (although we ate out mostly, and had a devine Pagliacci pizza delivered). There were extra toiletries available to borrow in the bathroom (but we brought everything we needed). We even slept great on the comfortable bed which isn't always the case when we travel since we love our Tempurpedic bed at home. It just felt so cozy and peaceful! The entry is from the alley 1/2 block off Market street, but we felt safe as there is a locking gate/fence to access the breezeway to the apartment. If you are looking for affordable lodging in a really cool ""walk-to-everything"" neighborhood of Seattle, this is perfect!"
3678718,29918624,2015-04-14,20890951,Marci,Great place!  Walked to Ballard st. Place was very clean and convenient!! 
3678718,30706374,2015-04-26,28686804,William,We had a great time during our trip to Seattle. And the Odd Fellows Lodge felt like home right away. A perfect space for 2 friends to come back to after taking advantage of all of the things the Pacific Northwest has to offer. Nora was as friendly as she was helpful. And Ballard was the area to see! Will definitely be back! 
3678718,30967510,2015-04-29,11171388,Christina,"My partner and I had a blast on our Seattle ""staycation"" with the Odd Fellows! Great communication and quick response made this last minute trip just perfect... we even added an addition day and it was so awesome!
The room was perfect, clean, bright, welcoming, and just all in all perfect for a getaway in the city! 
I would book again in a heart beat! I've already told many friends about the awesome getaway hidden below the coolest lodge in Ballard!"
3678718,31251592,2015-05-03,6015563,Steve,The apartment at the Odd Fellows Hall is great.  It is tucked away in a quiet location but right in the heart of downtown Ballard. We were able to walk everywhere on our trip easily.  The apartment itself is spacious and clean.  We would happily stay again on future trips 
3678718,32325789,2015-05-17,26975803,David And Melissa,We felt welcomed even before we arrived. The apartment was perfect as was the area. We have visited Seattle several times and wanted to stay and explore places outside of the downtown area. The Odd Fellows Lodge and Ballard were just what we were looking for.  
3678718,32848351,2015-05-22,32847623,Jennifer,"We had a great stay at Ballard Odd Lodging! We stayed Wed-Fri and had no trouble with nearby street parking. Close to restaurants, bars, great coffee (Bauhaus), and walking distance to places to see great shows (Tractor, Sunset Tavern). "
3678718,32998341,2015-05-24,6689933,Gabrielle & Kyle,"We had a wonderful stay at the Odd Lodging. The neighborhood was great, the accomodations were spacious and our host was helpful. Highly recommended."
3678718,33313172,2015-05-26,24770680,Melissa,"Great visit! Everything about it was easy - the checkin, the location just a few blocks from everything we wanted to do. It was clean and very quiet and private. The perfect stay!"
3678718,33910108,2015-06-02,423893,Pauline,"We had a great stay here! Super cute, clean place, right in the heart of Ballard. Would definitely stay again :)"
3678718,34178666,2015-06-05,34773885,Marla,"We loved staying in this apartment! It was so nicely kept, clean, and had a really nice feel. I felt kind of sad to leave! Great location close to awesome pubs, restaurants, and shops. I would stay there again in a heart beat!:)"
3678718,34416502,2015-06-08,9331435,Charles,A very unique space. We were very comfortable and had a great time at the Odd Fellows Lodge. Would definitely stay again.
3678718,35368353,2015-06-18,27763657,Andrew,"Great quite residence! We really enjoyed our stay,  we were able to walk wherever to get where we wanted to be.  Any questions we had,  the answer was simply a text away!"
3678718,35579899,2015-06-20,33783927,Jennifer,"This place was top notch. We were gobsmacked by the size of it--bedroom, living room, kitchen and bathroom. Lots of space to spread out and get comfy. The location was great--so close to lots of interesting places to drink and eat, including a wonderful coffee shop and an amazing whiskey bar. And just a short drive from downtown. It honestly couldn't have been more perfect for our brief stay in Seattle, and it made us wish we were staying longer."
3678718,35891323,2015-06-22,2537569,Rosana & Andy,"The Odd Lodging was awesome! It's location in the heart of Ballard is unbelievable. Communication was easy, and they were super-accomodating. We had a flight out of Seattle late on our check-out day. Since the didn't have guests coming in that day, they let us keep our things there a few extra hours. The place is spacious, comfortable, and the outdoor hallway/nook is a great place to hang out. We would definitely stay there again if we make it back to Seattle!"
3678718,36197804,2015-06-26,33919416,Patrick,"Ballard Odd Fellows was a great place to stay while in Seattle. The location is perfect, as Ballard is a beautiful and historic neighborhood close to the harbor that offers excellent options for food and drink and access to multiple bus lines that bring a visitor to all parts of Seattle, including multiple express bus lines to downtown Seattle and the train station should you be traveling via the rail. The apartment is great, exactly as it appears in the pictures. We were more impressed by the size of the apartment and the amenities in the kitchen that allowed us to cook a couple of meals in the apartment. The place was very clean and the furniture and decor was welcoming and comfortable. Also,they have a nice assortment of puzzles and games should you want a break from exploring the city. Nora and Sandy, the main contacts for Ballard Odd Fellows, were responsive in providing the check-in procedure and giving us assistance with regards to where to park our car — we were able to find free street parking just one block north of the apartment. This is an excellent place to stay in Seattle. It's close to Fremont and other great Seattle neighborhoods, with easy access to the waterfront via biking and walking trails and regular buses to downtown Seattle. "
3678718,36970674,2015-07-03,21772987,Luke,"It was very comfortable, clean and inviting. A Stellar home away from home!"
3678718,37296789,2015-07-06,20825200,Tracy,"This was our 2nd visit (and hopefully the 2nd of many, many more visits). We think of this sweet quiet apartment as our Ballard Oasis. Between the multitude of parties and events to attend, it is a treat to retire in the comfortable space and chill out. We love the fact that we can walk to so many restaurants and bars! Thank you again and can't wait to be back soon! Tracy and 
Bob"
3678718,37601483,2015-07-08,30045522,Alex,"The Odd Fellows Lodge had everything we needed for a couple days in Seattle. Comfortable, spacious apartment. Good location. Easy check in and out. Would definitely visit again."
3678718,38414849,2015-07-15,34942873,Kristian,We loved our stay in Ballard at the Odd Fellows Lodge. The apartment was just as described and the hosts were quick to respond and very accommodating. I would highly recommend this apartment for anyone wanting a great place to stay in Ballard with a very easy bus commute to downtown Seattle. 
3678718,38605207,2015-07-17,19431870,Laura,"The Odd Fellows was a great little gem. Situated a stones throw from all the great bars and restaurants, including access to buses in every direction (especially handy is the express bus to downtown), it was a perfect location. 

The apartment is huge! As well as the comfortable bed, it has a well stocked kitchen and lounge area - a totally spacious stay. 

Nora was lovely and friendly in her communications. Besides an early miscommunication hitch and some initial confusion, the stay at Odd Fellows is totally recommended!"
3678718,39167655,2015-07-21,32801259,Joshua,"This place was great! 

We arrived really lately, some time after midnight due to my phones navigation taking me 3 hours the wrong way, I know I know, my own fault. Anyway they were able to arrange me a key at that late hour which I am incredibly grateful. We spent very little time in the place as there is so much to do around it. The bed was extremely comfortable and the shower was an awesome claw foot tub with a shower head added.

They were able to explain parking to me, and answered more than one annoying question I had. I couldn't have asked for anything better. "
3678718,39609977,2015-07-25,5311956,Anna,"We had a great time in Seattle and a wonderful stay at the Odd Lodging. Next to the bedroom (with a very comfy bed), there was also a full kitchen and a living room with some provided boardgames and books. Everything was nicely decorated, clean and we felt very safe. It's a nice neighbourhood with many cafes, restaurants and shops and the bus connections to Downtown are good (about 15min to the Pike Market).
Even when we had an emergency (the apartment lock malfunctioned at 1am), our hosts reacted swiftly, organized a locksmith and even gave us a beer and a tour through their lodge to kill time. They made an otherwise unpleasant experience very interesting, which is highly appreciated. 
Great hosts and a great apartment, we would definitely recommend!"
3678718,39936706,2015-07-27,24980934,Ryan,"The Odd Lodging apartment was quaint & cute, clean, and simple. The apartment was very easy to find, and the self check-in/ check-out was nice. The team of hosts at Odd Lodging were helpful and responsive when messaging for how to enter/ exit, and anything we needed.

The apartment was simple, bedroom, living/ dining room, kitchen and bathroom. The living/ dining room was a nice little space to sit and relax, and play a game of cards (cards, and a few games were found in the apartment). My girlfriend and I stayed only two days, but I found the apartment was plenty spacious, minus the bathroom was quite small. The secure gate leading to the apartment was nice too, that area was very welcoming and nice to leave dirty shoes (not wanting to dirty the apartment) from our hiking outside of Seattle.

The area of the apartment was great, with a Walgreens a block away for any last minute items needed, and lots of great bars and restaurants within a 10 minute walk. Also, if in Ballard on a Sunday, the Ballard Farmer's Market was easy and fun to walk to and around."
3678718,40323577,2015-07-30,1213567,Nathan,"The Odd Fellows' space is quite nice. Accessible location in Ballard. While not in a bad neighborhood, the combination of the late-night 7/11 crowd across the street and the alley access to the apartment can make for an uncomfortable walk, safety-wise."
3678718,40770935,2015-08-02,36723011,Alissa,"Host was so easy to communicate with -  from leading up to our stay, to day of coordination, to wrapping up time at Odd Lodging, it was seamless.  The location is so ideal, you can walk right to the heart of Ballard and you are close enough to the Ballard Bridge as well as access to 99 to get Queen Anne and downtown.  Would highly recommend."
3678718,42520023,2015-08-14,15344389,Lara,Great location and very spacious with lots of good places to eat and drink nearby. We enjoyed seeing live music in a couple of different venues in Ballard. If we come to Seattle again we'd definitely stay here! 
3678718,43947763,2015-08-23,11509232,Doug,"For the price and location this place is a steal.  Easy check in, place was clean, it is fully stocked with anything you could need, its a good size, and there is a organic donut place across the street.  It is in a commercial district which actually made it very quiet at night.  There is a ton of things to walk to.  We found street parking to be pretty easy, and the lot was cheap also.  It is a basement apt so it was a little on the dark side but not bad.  We were out and about a lot so really just a place to sleep.  The shower was a bit old but it did work and have hot water.  The bed was a bit hard - a $50 memory foam pad would go a long way to making it more comfortable.  Overall based on location and price I would recommend it."
3678718,44690387,2015-08-28,6268769,Milla,"The apartment was spacious and had everything that we needed. The neighborhood is nice with many small restaurants and shops. However, be careful not to leave anything in your car when parking in the Ballard area. Our car was broken into on the last day and all our luggage got stolen, since we were just about to leave to the airport."
3678718,45090933,2015-08-31,6963617,Sara,"Great location, spacious apartment! We'd definitely stay there again!"
3678718,46314720,2015-09-09,28374093,Samantha,We had a wonderful stay! The apartment is located in an awesome area of Ballard with lots of restaurants and shops nearby. It's only a short ride to other neighborhoods in Seattle as well which  made things very convenient for us. The apartment itself was really nice and clean and looked exactly as pictured. The host Nora was also easy to reach and very accommodating. We would definitely recommend choosing this for your stay! Thank you! 
3678718,48075844,2015-09-23,1028333,Mary,"Great lodging in a fun, convenient area.

We stayed at Odd Lodging for 5 nights while we were in Seattle and it made a great home base. The place is located on a hot stretch of Ballard, within walking distance to many great restaurants, bars, and breweries. It's also right off of two bus lines with a store nearby selling passes.

The place itself was great; plenty large for two people. The bed was comfortable and it was stocked with books and games should you have some free time to kill. There's a full kitchen with everything you might need to eat in and menus on the outside pinboard should you want to venture out. The place was immaculate.

I interacted with Nora dung my stay and she was very friendly and helpful. Even warning us when there were significant traffic delays expected."
3678718,48688592,2015-09-28,4384322,Scott,"The location is great and the accommodations get the job done. There is so much within walking distance. The hosts were very accessible and helpful. The kitchen is well stocked but you may want to bring some spices and such if you want to cook. FYI, It can be a little dark and musty and the alley can attract some loiterers. But definitely would stay there again."
3678718,49294332,2015-10-02,2734499,Jason,"This is a the best Ballard gem. Very homey feeling, comfy bed, clean space, and very secure. Easy to find with good free asking options. Close to some of Seattle's hottest restaurant. Good communication with the host always. This is the second time I've booked this space and will most definitely book again. Thank you to the IOOF all your support of my growing business."
3678718,50256265,2015-10-10,46017680,Finn,"The host was fantastic and was easy to communicate and work with. The place was cool,clean and fun. A great urban hideaway in Ballard."
3678718,50616441,2015-10-13,2054333,Brian,"Great place to stay in the heart of ballard for an unbeatable price. Place feels very homey considering it is essentially the basement of their building accessed by the alleyway. Big metal gate makes the place feel real secure. Space heaters were provided, which were useful. "
3678718,50980152,2015-10-16,2293774,Mel,"Odd Lodging was fantastic on many levels, before I begin to describe our stay, I would like to let anyone who plans on renting this place  that it is right in the heart of everything going on in Ballard.  It is awesome! You can walk anywhere, bars, restaurants, yoga, shopping, coffee and there is a great bike rental place called Dutch Bike (I think) and ride around instead of walking.

So...the place looked exactly like the photos and it seems like kind of a weird place because its behind a commercial building (strip mall-ish) and you have to unlock a chain link gate to get in, however, once inside you will find yourself in mid-century heaven:)  This place is so stinking cute, with great colors and a very bohemian ""Mad Men"" like feeling.  The bed was incredibly comfortable and they have a perfect little vanity next to it to get ready and head into Seattle for some more fun. The kitchen is so sweet, kind of wished that there were 40's-50's style appliances but nonetheless it was fantastic.  They have dishes, towels, paper towels etc...handy.

They were always available to me, they made it incredibly easy for me to get the key and we were in quite late the first night.  They got back to me quickly if I had any questions regarding parking or something to do with the apartment.

The one thing I would say could be a little better is the parking situation.  There really isn't anywhere to park that you can park overnight and for free.  We had to change our parking spot a bunch of times and that kind of got old, but in no way took away from how great this place is to stay.

So....in other words, we loved it.  It is funky, clean, cool and the energy felt very warm.  "
3678718,51356964,2015-10-19,19230390,Ashley,It was very clean and inviting. Wonderful location close to food and night life. Would definitely come back!
3678718,52180128,2015-10-26,5067651,Caroline,"Oddfellows was super easy - great location for Ballard/Fremont exploring. Good bed and good amount of space to relax in. Pro tip - Mighty O donuts just opened nearby, I'd never had a vegan donut but they are delicious!"
3678718,53246716,2015-11-07,8534830,Jared,"Great experience staying at the ""Odd Lodging"". The apartment is comfortable and very conveniently located. Super easy communication."
3678718,54513713,2015-11-21,46498868,Aaron,Loved this little place! Clean and comfortable. Amazing location!
3678718,55235102,2015-11-29,8402577,Steven,The odd lodging was charming and the host was very responsive.  The location in Ballard was awesome.
3678718,55666799,2015-12-04,47779108,Jimmy,The house was perfect!  I felt really comfortable staying here.  Ballard is a really beautiful place and I would definitely consider staying here again in a future visit to Seattle. 
3678718,56786033,2015-12-18,36893281,Brett,"Great apartment in a great neighborhood. The hosts communicated well, nice amenities. Easy to walk to a grocery store and numerous restaurants. If you're around on a Sunday check out the Ballard Farmer's Market!"
529090,3993465,2013-04-01,5683611,Ian,"Right where I needed to be! Only a few blocks from Pikes Place and the water, I was close enough to easily visit friends in north and west seattle. Unfortunately, I only briefly met Alice as I was partying my face off all weekend. However, I was able to take advantage of the great rooftop one afternoon and coffee with honey in the morning was a nice bonus. "
529090,4037843,2013-04-04,1587215,Pete,"Stay was super. She was a gracious host who is clearly invested in your experience. Lots of local food knowledge, easy access, and flexible. Highly recommended. :)"
529090,4071489,2013-04-07,5785563,Deborah,"In the middle of it all, and two blocks closer to the water as a buffer from the fun night life and busy buslines on 2nd/3rd ave, glad I booked here! Great location, cool modern building with +++ amenities, cheerful immaculate apartment.  Fresh coffee and fruit from the charming host were very nice perks!  I had a great time staying here and will re-book for sure.  Thank you Alice and I love Seattle!"
529090,4238292,2013-04-21,1980128,Caspar,"Staying with Alice was wonderful: she's dependable, caring, helpful, very clean and easy to talk to! Borrowing her bike was a godsent, everything is quite close and a bike is just so much faster than bussing. The building comes with lots of perks; I especially enjoyed the gym, and even though the weather was a bit cold, I had a swim and soak in the outdoor pool and hot tub. When I was there, there was no internet in the appartment yet. There's a computer lounge in the neighboring building where I spent a lot of time working, but I understood that wifi will be installed at Alice's appartment any day now!"
529090,4262418,2013-04-22,5189067,Julia,"Alice was very nice, she met me outside as I had trouble finding the apartment.  Though to be honest, I get lost everywhere I go! I was able to park my rental car there, which is a bonus.  The apartment was nice and is located in a great area, I was able to walk everywhere. "
529090,4355264,2013-04-29,880366,Peter,"During my recent visit to see the Rembrandt Exhibition at the Seattle Art Museum, I stayed at Alice's lovely downtown apartment and had the most remarkable time. The unit has everything one would need during a stay in Seattle - the bed was comfy, the unit clean and modern, parking was in a secure underground lot within the building, and groceries, lattes, wine, shoppes, and nightlife are literally steps away. Most of the downtown hotels charge $40 or more PER DAY for parking, so her facility is a real economical treasure for that alone. The car never left the building during my stay as everything was really that close!  Pikes Market, the Art Gallery, Shopping, Theaters, the Space Needle, the Sports Arenas, Pioneer Square, and transit. 

Alice is the most gracious and considerate hostess one could imagine staying with. I can't say enough kind things to repay her for all the wonderful hospitality she provided that made my stay as memorable as it was. I'd not stay anywhere else if I were going to Seattle!"
529090,4463677,2013-05-06,6111569,DeeAnn,"Alice was very efficient and organized, as well as kind and flexible! A great host and a beautiful, convenient and comfortable spot in downtown Seattle. I was most appreciative to have found her listing!"
529090,4551976,2013-05-12,5682576,Will,"Room works, bathroom and shower works, location works.  Alice was out for much of the week, so we didn't run into each other much.  She was friendly and happy to recommend food and transportation options.  I did not try the hot tub or the lounge, as I was there for work and just wanted to come home and sleep most days.

Minor gripes: It would have been helpful if Alice had been home when I first arrived to see me in and show me around the place -- as it was, she gave me the wrong code to get into the building and I spent several minutes on the phone with her, trying different numbers.  

The wireless router is a little flaky, and would disappear every few hours.  Not sure what was up with that.  Not a big deal as cellphone reception is excellent.

Also, the kettle's in the bathroom.  That one caught me a couple of times."
529090,4636869,2013-05-17,5657858,Debbie,"We stayed with Alice in her home for one night in mid-May 2013.  Alice could not have been a more gracious hostess!  She was very welcoming and was willing to help us find our way in Seattle with suggestions and tips for our day in the Emerald City.  Alice’s home was located in a perfect location.  It was within walking distance to Pike’s Market, the ferry terminal, and public transportation.  The bedroom we stayed in had a comfortable bed and plenty of room for our suitcases – even room to play a game of cribbage!  Alice left us morning coffee, but our airport driver was early, so we could not partake in her kind cups if java.  If we are lucky to be able to visit Seattle again, we would not hesitate to stay with Alice.  Alice  gets high marks from the Larsen’s of Franklin, Wisconsin."
529090,4669808,2013-05-19,5386700,Allen,"Alice was a great host!  She was very thoughtful about providing us with all the details of getting in and around her apartment.  It was great getting some inside advice on where to eat and go out in Seattle.  Thanks, Alice!"
529090,4990771,2013-06-05,6531092,Sarah,"Alice hosted me in her charming apartment on VERY short notice. She was so helpful, I really couldn't have lucked out any better. The bedroom was clean and the bed was very comfortable. It was a perfect way to end a long vacation in the PNW. Her place is within walking distance to many of the great attractions in Seattle. I would highly recommend staying with Alice and I would host her in my home anytime."
529090,5130194,2013-06-14,293651,Jerad,Was in Seattle to attend a conference. Alice's place was fantastic. Only complaint was the consistency of the internet connection but that only plagued me on the first day. Very close to the Bell Harbor Convention Center. I had access to the gym and a parking spot if I had needed it. Her place is a close walk to a nice running path which I visited each morning.
529090,5343585,2013-06-25,6240701,Bret,"Great location, friendly host and we really enjoyed our stay in Seattle. We needed a location that was close to both the Seattle Center and Pike's Market and this fit the bill perfectly. We stayed in the summer of 2013 and took advantage of the nice weather to sit out on the rooftop deck. We tried the hot tub but never were able to get it to heat up. Didn't use the WiFi but it was available. The room was clean and nice and towels were provided. 

Though we didn't cross paths with our host too often, she made sure we had what we needed and was pretty easygoing. We had use of the kitchen (fridge, microwave, oven, pots & pans, etc) if we had needed it. "
529090,5390271,2013-06-27,87953,Ellis,"Alice is a lovely host and her place is perfect for my brief work visit to Seattle. Location is right smack in Belltown, surrounded by great bar/restaurants. The rooftop deck is huge and comfortable. Will definitely stay here again. Thank you Alice!"
529090,5561416,2013-07-06,6572631,Fabienne,"I stayed at Alice's place for only one night on 4th of July. Alice is a very good host and I enjoved talking to her very much. Unfortunately, we didn't spend much time together due to my tight travel plans. But I would be happy to stay at her place any time again. The apartment is perfectly located and very clean. I recommend a walk down at the waterfront in the morning and breakfast at the Pike Market."
529090,5734496,2013-07-14,5810814,Melissa,Thanks for hosting us Alice and for your hospitality.  Alice is one sweet gal and her place was just as described and as seen in the pictures. Happy to have shared places to eat/see in Seattle!
529090,5911624,2013-07-22,1002005,Argelia,This place is amazing! Just a five minute walk to Pike Place. Alice was very charming and gracious and made me feel at home. Her home is immaculate and a great place to recharge. The building has wonderful amenities... check out the rooftop! There is a corner market across the street and also the Bang Bang cafe which has great breakfast and lunch options. The location is perfect to explore Seattle. I rarely used public transportation as it was so easy to walk to all the attractions. I loved heading to the market in the early mornings to watch the vendors set up. The proximity of Alice's home made it easy to do this without having to wait around for a bus. I can't wait to return to Seattle and hopefully Alice's home will be available. 
529090,6010015,2013-07-26,7275402,Lucinda,"I really enjoyed my stay in Seattle (what a great city). Alice was very welcoming and gracious enough to agree to host me despite my arriving at a late hour (made even later by a delayed flight). The description is accurate, it's a lovely apartment in a fascinating area and I would definitely stay here again. "
529090,6274930,2013-08-06,6281369,Jessica,Alice was a joy to stay with. We had the pleasure of meeting her and her place was very clean and had an amazing location.
529090,6459954,2013-08-13,6932024,Jonathan,"Alice was an excellent host and her place was wonderful.  It was a very close walk to downtown Seattle.  Alice was happy to answer any questions I had.  She was also very accommodating when it came to ""checking in"" the first day.

I would recommed Alice's place to anyone visiting Seattle."
529090,6592687,2013-08-18,7557439,Linda,"Alice was very nice and accommodating to my boyfriend and I. She allowed us to cook in the apartment and leave our bags for the day while sightseeing the day we were to ""check out"" since our flight was at 11:30 pm. She gave us excellent recommendations around Seattle too. The location of her place doesn't get any better and at an unbeatable price! I would recommend staying here to any one person or couple! THANKS ALICE!"
529090,6789161,2013-08-25,7472748,Benedikt,"Alice is a lovely host, her apartment is clean and in cool neighborhood with many good cafes, restaurants and bars. Her tips where to eat and get coffee were great. It's easy to walk to downtown and it's close to the waterfront. I really enjoyed the stay at Alice's place.
"
529090,6923095,2013-08-30,7760204,Christopher,This was our first airbnb stay and we enjoyed the experience thanks to Alice and her great hospitality. She gave us great tips on what to do and where to visit and points of interest in the city. Highly recommended. Thx Alice!!!
529090,7720357,2013-09-30,5370530,Alejandro,Alice is an exceptional host. I really enjoyed Seattle which is a  great city and I hope to visit it again. Thanks 
529090,8096420,2013-10-15,8928382,Janna,"Alice was a wonderful host. The room was pleasant while the bed was very comfortable. Alice was very easy to be contacted whenever I had questions.  She was also very flexible with my checkout time, seeing as I had a late flight out of Seattle. Her apartment was in a great location, close to downtown and just a few blocks from the waterfront. Would love to stay again on my next trip out to Seattle!"
529090,8828121,2013-11-19,3493652,Peter,"Alice is a very charming, accommodating host and her food and attraction recommendations were spot on. The apartment itself is very clean and easily accessible by transit, but I didn’t need to use it as the major attractions are easily walkable, including Pike’s Place Market, the Space Needle and the ferry terminal. Lots of pubs nearby and most have generous happy hours. For some reason I couldn’t get the wifi to work on my laptop, but via ethernet the internet was very fast and solid. Grateful that she allowed me to have a late checkout because of my red-eye flight so I could see more of this great city. Cheers!  "
529090,8921900,2013-11-25,10138670,Jacob,Alice was a wonderful host accommodating a late evening check in. Provided great directions and recommendations while offering a clean and quaint living area. Look forward to the next visit.
529090,9095343,2013-12-06,9172433,Amber,"I had really nice 4 days stay at Alice's flat. Alice is a wonderful host, very nice, kind and helpful!  I was also impressed with Alice's quick response time. As for the room itself, it was amazingly spacious and absolutely clean.  Because it was winter in Seattle, very cold out side, but the flat was very warm! 
Alice showed all the great places to visit when the first day I arrived, and answered all my questions patiently everyday.
The apartment building looks very elegant. The location is great, several mins to Pike market, 12-15 mins to Seattle center.  Very convenient transportation and safe area. 
I am a very very light sleep person, so I feel it is a little bit noisy outside. But I still had good sleep there. 
Alice also shared her nice cooking with me, and prepared cute candies for my flight. Thank you so much!
Hope we can meet in the future, and I can see the glass bridge one day :)
"
529090,9123497,2013-12-08,10419475,Ivan,"Alice was great, very helpful and accommodating to me with a outstanding flat located perfectly to fill all my needs. Alice was very courteous and extremely quite, I couldn't  tell if she was there. I would definitely stay in her flat again!
Ivan"
529090,9482473,2013-12-30,5677984,Marcello,"The apartment was really amazing, I enjoyed my stay so much, even if so short time. I loved the fireplace in the living room. Pictures don't really do enough justice to the place. The room was comfortable and with plenty of space. Location is quite central, I walked from there to all the places I managed to find time to visit. Also plenty of restaurants and bars in the neighborhood.

Alice was awesome, taking care of all little details to make my stay there memorable. She is a lovely girl, really nice to talk to.
If I really have to find a defect, is that I booked only 2 days in Seattle. So much to see, so little time. I would definitely try to stay there again on a next visit to Seattle."
529090,9840704,2014-01-13,10965483,Anna,Alice's apartment is perfectly located for exploring Seattle and likewise Alice was the perfect host. Would recommend.
529090,9916503,2014-01-19,2481273,Joe,"Alice was an excellent, friendly host and the room was mega comfortable. Everything was exactly as indicated on the listing. I was in town for a conference at the convention center and had no trouble walking there and back every day. Overall, A++ would stay again."
529090,10015530,2014-01-25,6289334,Alfredo,"Alice was a great host, she's very kind and nice. "
529090,10188328,2014-02-04,11586575,David,"Great, easy to find modern apartment with a super comfy bed and reliable wifi in a building stacked with facilities (even has a computer room for residents that I used to print off my tickets for the next leg of my trip).

Excellent location, I walked everywhere - leisurely 10 mins to Pike Market in one direction, the same to the Needle in the other. Lots of eating and drinking options on the doorstep too. And if you get to catch a film (sorry, movie) at The Big Picture up one block then you should -they even deliver drinks to your seat midway through.

Although Alice and my paths didn't cross much she was lovely, very welcoming and available by text for any queries.

Perfect first Airbnb experience. Thanks Alice!"
529090,10325352,2014-02-13,10811073,Ying(Ada),"I had great time at Alice's (website hidden) was warm all the time.location is the perfect,close to everywhere.Alice and her boyfriend were nice and warm.will stay there on my next visit:)"
529090,10603848,2014-02-27,8881543,Linda,"Nice room in a nice apartment, Alice is a nice lady. The apartment and the building are quiet except for traffic noise, her rental bedroom is on the second floor, above the street. Great location, about a four block walk from Pike Place Market, and just a few more blocks uphill to downtown. Alice is a sweetheart, always friendly and helpful. 
A big weight room, a pool, and a rooftop deck where on a nice day, you can see the Olympic Mountains and Mt. Ranier. Gotta love Seattle. "
529090,11011136,2014-03-17,12099332,Jessica,Great location in Downtown Seattle! Only took between 5 to 15 minute walk to see all the main attractions in Downtown. The train station and bus station was a close walk too. The room was clean with great lighting. The shared bathroom was clean too. Alice provides fresh linens and soft towels. The apartment was very charming and a pleasant place to stay. Alice is very sweet and tried a couple restaurants she recommended which I loved! If I ever come back to visit Seattle I would definitely stay here again!
529090,11165072,2014-03-23,3157621,James,"My stay here was great.  I was here for 2 nights for work and I can say that it was ideal.  Alice was very welcoming and room/apartment was spotless and I found the bed extremely comfortable.  The apartment is a 5minute walk from the ferry which was particularly useful for me and there are tons of coffee shops around the area as well as the famous Pike Market only a 10minute walk away.

Will definitely stay here again! Thanks Alice!"
529090,11380524,2014-03-31,5593192,Rita,"It is a safe place to stay in downtown Seattle, and the host is nice. "
529090,11980486,2014-04-20,5644768,Sophia,Great location. Walkable to everything we wanted to see. Clean. Quick response from Alice. Would recommend!
529090,12258222,2014-04-27,14341908,Sara,I had a great experience. It was the perfect location in Belltown and Alice is a fantastic host. 
529090,12322098,2014-04-28,14606809,Charley,"Alice was very pleasant and easy to communicate with. Her apartment is very clean, and in a great location in Belltown. Checking in was very easy. I was able to easily walk all over downtown from her apartment. The bed was very comfortable and the bedroom had a nice view over the street below. Overall my stay was fantastic! Thank you, Alice!"
529090,13059742,2014-05-19,14650255,Stacey,The reservation was canceled 3 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
529090,13157903,2014-05-20,15098135,Samuel,"The location was excellent, as was the host. Note that the bed is very soft - some people like that and some people don't, so you will need to decide if this is a plus or a minus for you."
529090,13768264,2014-06-03,15492477,Melanie,"We loved staying with Alice. The room was lovely and everything very clean. 
The Location is Perfect. You have everything in walking distance and there's a great Place for breakfast right across the street.
Alice was very friendly and Even though the flat was quite small, we didnt get in eachothers way at all.
The Building is amazing, with a roof terrace, a Pool and even a hot tub."
529090,13935454,2014-06-08,2359525,Martin,"Alice was the most lovely host! She was very communicative, great to spend time with, gave me some brilliant tips and all-round just an easy and genuine person to spend time with!

The apartment was great as well. There was plenty of space and the room was comfortable, I felt right at home from the start. Furthermore the gym and pool were a real bonus as I was here on a work visit and it was great to have that facility available. Probably best of all was the location, moments away from the Bay and Sculpture Park, which are beautiful and with a tonne of nice cafes and restaurants very nearby in Belltown as well. 

All in all, a great visit - thank you Alice!!"
529090,14198335,2014-06-14,15901411,Laura,Alice is great! The place is convenient and easy to find - and she makes you feel like you are staying with an old friend.
529090,14528322,2014-06-21,4968182,Robert,I had a comfortable stay at Alice's place. Pre-arrival communication and checkin was great. The bed is very soft which was great for me but could be an issue if you like firm mattresses. 
529090,14715543,2014-06-24,16735737,Lars,"Alice was a great and very helpful host. The place is very close to everything downtown and the place itself is very nice with a lot of nice details.
There is a lot of noise from the street though and the bed is small for 2 persons.
We enjoyed staying with Alice and are more than happy to recommend this place to others going to Seattle :-)"
529090,15057186,2014-07-01,16356477,Matthew,"Alice was a great host and her posting was very accurate to what the apartment was like once I arrived.  She was extremely helpful and had maps and suggestions available but also was not overwhelming.

I was in town for a wedding downtown and the apartment was extremely convenient for getting around.  Literally a few blocks from the ocean, a short walk to Pike Place Market, Space Needle and many other downtown attractions.

I used the gym and the apartment complex even had a BBQ while I was there (which I didn't have a chance to check out).

I had a great experience staying here and would recommend.  Cheaper, more convenient and I thought very nice and private even compared to staying in a hotel."
529090,15515078,2014-07-10,17612691,Mark,"Alice, the host, was most helpful and welcoming. The neighborhood was great and an easy walk to lots of restaurants, bars, sightseeing...excellent location. The room and the apartment were comfortable and modern. The only drawback was the noise from the street traffic. The second night Alice loaned me a fan, and that completely drowned the noise and made it perfect."
529090,15638369,2014-07-13,5799697,Todd,"This was an excellent choice for me in downtown Seattle. Alice is very communicative, stayed on top of responding to my reservation request and checking in with me in the days before my arrival.
The flat is comfortable, accessible with nice building lounge, pool and rooftop and served my purposes (I was one person attending a conference in Seattle for 3 days).
It is close and walkable to all of downtown Seattle, many tourist sites, a running path along the waterfront as well as restaurants. 
I highly recommend this site and Alice."
529090,15968919,2014-07-19,7055294,Brian,Great stay. Fantastic apartment and excellent host. 
529090,16746290,2014-08-01,18171292,Mary,My friend and I flew to Seattle to see the Beyoncé concert. Alice's apartment is in the best location in downtown! We were so close to pikes Place market and about a 10 minute walk from everywhere.
529090,18417316,2014-08-26,7915631,Yutong,"Alice is a great host! really helpful and kind. Try her recommendations, she knows a lot about those tasty restaurants! The house is located in a wonderful location, nice  neighborhood."
529090,18727011,2014-08-31,18242397,Sophia,"Alice was a fantastic hostess and essentially acted as my concierge while I was in town for the first time from the East Coast! She was very kind and helpful with suggestions or phone numbers and maps whenever I had a question, and I really appreciated how clean and orderly the room provided and the bathroom were.  The apartment is also in a fantastic location, and the building is very secure.  Belltown itself is a great area for eating/drinking out, plus it is a quick walk to all the best Seattle attractions, from the Needle and EMP museum, to Pike Pl Market and Pioneer Square, and to Capitol Hill.  I would caution that if you are overly sensitive to noise, you may need headphones to sleep as the room is only a couple of floors up from the street, but it's not too bad when the windows are closed.  Check-in and check-out were both very easy and Alice even provided a map to the building so that I knew where all the amenities were (the gym is awesome, btw, but you may not even need it with all the walking you'll want to do!).  

All-in-all a great experience, and if I ever return to Seattle, I would 100% stay with Alice again and I will recommend her place to anyone I know headed out that way! "
529090,18881441,2014-09-02,4376731,Kim,"Alice was a great host! She was always very responsive and gave great suggestions. The room was exactly what we expected, clean and tidy. View from rooftop was beautiful and location was ideal. Close enough to most points of interest without being right in the midst of it. "
529090,19069085,2014-09-06,14882312,Brendan,"Alice is a greet host, communicates well, provides you with information on the area and really makes you feel welcome. The flat was as described very clean and tidy. It is located in a great spot easy walking distance to Pikes Markets, downtown, the space needle and many other attractions. It's a shame I was only there for one night. "
529090,19220769,2014-09-08,17230294,Sergey,"Alice was an excellent hostess. She greeted us when we arrived but we did not see her after that, as she really gave us privacy. The bathroom, although shared, is adjacent to the guest room, so can be entered privately. Alice gave us food recommendations which were spot on. The location is excellent, close to everything. The biggest downside for us was the rather loud traffic noise when the window is slightly open, which I needed for air at night -- but if you don't require an open window in order to sleep then the double pane should keep most of the noise out. Make sure to check out the roof deck!"
529090,19392135,2014-09-11,1466681,Florence,"A pleasent apartment and Alice is an attenative host. I like the location -close to water front, Seattle Center, and best of all the high-energy 1st Av with several great place to eat and drink."

529090,20673102,2014-10-03,21792386,Alexia,"Great location, especially as a single female traveller I wanted to feel safe, I really could not fault the location.  Alice is a lovely host and this is a lovely apartment. I thoroughly enjoyed my stay here. Highly recommended."
529090,21788017,2014-10-24,3035312,Alexandre,"My stay at Alice's apartment was great. Close to the Bell Conference center as well as Pike Place Market, it was very convenient. The place was very clean and my room comfortable. I didn't get to use them, but the gym, pool and hot tub seemed pretty neat too.

Alice was a treat. She was very reactive through mail, made me feel at home, and gave me the most incredible tips on restaurants and bars in the city.

A great stay!"
529090,22042081,2014-10-28,22464692,Jenny,"Didn't meet Alice until the second day of the visit, but I'm so glad that I did, she was so refreshingly happy and cheerful and easy to get along with.  Communications for arrival were very clear.  All aspects of the accommodation were absolutely clean and comfortable.
The location for a city stay could not have been better, easy walking distance to Seattle Center and Pike Place areas.  I came by car, but it wasn't necessary, public transport works fine to/from the airport and around the city.  The apartment block has many facilities that I didn't get chance to explore, too many things to do, too little time!"
529090,22281966,2014-11-02,20552585,Yvonne,Alice is nice to communicate with. The location is 10mins walk to the pike market. Really recommend! Would love to stay again.
529090,22598094,2014-11-10,720542,Antonio,"Alice was a wonderful host. She was very responsive to our texts, and her home felt incredibly warm! The place was also very private for a shared room.

She was also kind enough to let us keep our bags at her place on the last day while we were traveling. That really made a big difference for our weekend trip.

Thanks again Alice!"
529090,23273553,2014-11-27,23377406,Thibault,I spend two nights in Seattle. I enjoyed staying at Alice place! She made me feel welcome and was helpful to find nice spots. The appartment is really confortable. It is close to downtown and easily reachable. I would definitively recommend it! Thanks for the stay!  
529090,24063731,2014-12-18,22608752,Kyle,"Incredible location. Lots of great stuff to do within just a few blocks. Alice was a great host and had plenty of great suggestions about things to do and see around the city. Nice large room with a cozy bed. Since it is right on the street, you do get some Street traffic noise, but it's to be expected. Overall, I had a great experience."
529090,25215907,2015-01-09,813118,Richard,"Alice's place is perfect for a visit to Seattle.   Great location for the Seattle sites, breakfast across the street at Bang Bang, and a nice place with a great bed.   Will definitely stay again."

529090,25520992,2015-01-18,19194119,Don,This was my second stay Alice's flat and hope to stay there again when I go back to Seattle. The bedroom and bathroom are spotless and Alice is very accommodating. She loaned me an umbrella a day when the rain was coming down in buckets.
529090,25619674,2015-01-20,26116294,Liza,"Alice was an amazing host! She was so accommodating with her late check-in and check-out hours. 

My sister and I stayed there, as an alternative to one of the larger hotels.

Her apartment was located in the perfect spot--we loved being able to walk around and explore the Belltown area, which has so many unique, local restaurants and shops.

Alice had great suggestions about places to go, and the apartment itself was perfect; clean and comfortable!"
529090,26679135,2015-02-17,7991655,Helena,"Alice was very sweet about writing ahead and making sure I knew how to connect with her when I arrived - and took it completely in stride that my arrival time would have to be somewhat flexible since I had no idea what traffic was going to be like.  The flat was tidy and with a number of nice touches to make me feel welcome.  Fabulous location and lovely cozy bed.  Would stay again.
    "
529090,28256845,2015-03-21,1390215,Zhiqi,"Alice is very nice. The bed in my bedroom is really comfortable. I enjoyed the stay. And the location is also perfect, walking distance to everywhere you need to go."
529090,28824001,2015-03-30,9117042,Baard,"Stayed two nights at Alice's place.
All communication went smoothly, check-in works fine even if Alice was at work when I arrived.
The apartment is like it looks on the photos. The bathroom is shared with the host. A bit surprising; I had the impression from the profile that the bedroom would come with it's own bathroom. But sharing wasn't a problem for me.
Be aware that the bedroom is on 2nd floor facing a very busy street with quite heavy traffic; so if you're sensitive to noise, this might not be the place. (I had earplugs, so was able to sleep fine with the window shut...)
The bed is comfortable for 1 person, although a bit on the soft side. 
Alice is friendly and hospitable, and if you ask she can give some info about the city. She also provided a map and some tourist brochures. 
All in all a good place to stay, but I think - compared to other airbnb offerings in Seattle - that it is a bit overpriced compared to what you get.
Best regards
Baard"
529090,29927557,2015-04-14,28390623,Jim,"Really enjoyed my stay at Alice's apartment in Seattle. I arrived later than expected, had to change my arrival plans a number of times but Alice made it easy for me to get into the apartment and get settled in.
It is a very cosy apartment in a block of flats and has everything you would need, the bedroom is very spacious and comfortable. 
The whole building is very well looked after and has loads of amenities (as listed). 
Great location to explore Seattle too, the Space Needle and famous markets only a few blocks away.
I had a few texts from Alice over the weekend asking if everything was OK and to give her a call if anything was wrong, great customer service!
Would definitely recommend a stay here again the next time I visit Seattle. "
529090,30331034,2015-04-20,15910780,Jennifer,Alice is a wonderful host! She was very helpful in giving us information about the area and was so sweet in making sure our stay was comfortable.  What a wonderful weekend and visit.  Will definitely come stay again!
529090,30646935,2015-04-25,17618980,Rupayan,"Visited Seattle on an office trip during April (phone number hidden). Decided to try airbnb as most downtown hotels were booked out and also because I wanted to try a new experience. Overall I had a very comfortable stay at Alice's. The apt is located in a wonderful neighbourhood, close to the bay, Pike Place Market and great restaurants. 

Room is simple, cosy and very clean. The bathroom is shared with the host, however this was not a problem for me as Alice was out most of the time. 

Alice herself is a conscientious host and she responded promptly to emails and msgs. She provided guest towels, soap and a small tube of what I think was a Brazilian brand of moisturising creme."
529090,30902427,2015-04-28,30679373,Jonathan,"Alice was an awesome host. Had recommendations and everything ready, step by step. Great location!!! You're walking distance to the space needle, emp museum( a must see), pike market and five minute bus ride to safeco park. "
529090,31468756,2015-05-05,26152898,Bethan,"Alice was away and so left instructions with regard to how to get in to her building. It was easy enough but Alice was contactable if I had any problems. I didn't meet Alice in person so I can't comment on her as a host. However, the guest room and bathroom were both clean and nicely laid out, with cute guest towels. Within the building, the guest room is on the side of Western Avenue so you do need ear plugs if you are a light sleeper. Also the bed is very soft so that may be an issue for anyone with back problems who needs a harder surface to sleep on. The location is really good for anyone who wants to base themselves downtown (as I did). However, I think it's best value for money if you are travelling as a couple rather than as a single traveller. "
529090,31688399,2015-05-08,32611160,Brandon,The reservation was canceled the day before arrival. This is an automated posting.
529090,32562461,2015-05-19,23229974,Lujun,Alice is a wonderful host. She was really flexible about our arrival time and always made sure we had everything we needed. The location is perfect. My friend and I were able to walk to nice restaurants in Belltown and to space needle. The apartment is clean and comfortable. My friend and I really enjoyed our stay and I would definitely consider staying at Alice's again.
529090,33661726,2015-05-31,29522810,Maura,"Alice's apartment was really comfortable, especially the bed! The apartment is in an ideal location and within a short walk from Pike Place Market, the Seattle Space Needle and downtown Seattle, to name a just a few places! Alice was really helpful giving me instructions to find her apartment and how to leave myself in and out. She also responded to my messages promptly. The apartment also has access to a hot tub which I, unfortunately, did not have a chance to try during my short and busy trip. The apartment was within a nice building which seemed very safe. I would definitely recommend this flat if you want to stay close to the centre of Seattle!"
529090,34522686,2015-06-09,4710083,Christina,"The location is great for exploring the city. We walked nearly everywhere we wanted to go, and ubers were easy to catch if we had to venture farther. The apartment is small, but the bed was comfortable and bathroom very clean. Alice was easily available when needed and very helpful and attentive whenever we had a question. "
529090,34944773,2015-06-14,5546691,AnnMargret,"We had a great stay at Alice's place! Although I never met her, she made sure we were comfortable & had everything we needed. The room is spacious & the whole apartment was spotless. We would love to stay here again when we return to Seattle! Thanks Alice!"
529090,36687987,2015-06-30,33868821,Lydia,"Very good location. 10 mins walk to pike market. Also close to water front.Clean and tidy room. Alice was very nice and prepared a lot for us.But a little bit noisy and can barely open the window. Being extremely hot week in Seattle. No AC in the room, but the fan helped a lot. Pleasant and good experience in Alice's flat. "
529090,37315630,2015-07-06,25149814,Bethany,"Alice was super helpful and easy to work with, even though we weren't able to meet her. The room and bathroom is large, and Alice left us fresh water for our late arrival. So sweet! Central location, great for all Seattle has to offer!"
529090,37777850,2015-07-10,27448724,Tiffany,The host canceled this reservation the day before arrival. This is an automated posting.
529090,38779040,2015-07-18,20586019,Claire,Enjoyed my stay immensely. Room was great and bed was very comfy. Great location. Within walking distance of food and entertainment. This place was exactly what I was looking for. 
529090,39956376,2015-07-27,32973329,Erin,"I stayed here for a few days at the end of July. The description as well as other reviews are accurate.  I was there in between heat waves so the weather was wonderful, but I can see how it could get a bit warm in the room. Opening the window helps but it faces a busy street. I didn't get a chance to meet Alice, but she was very responsive and I did meet her sister and mom, who was staying there, and they were both very nice. The location was excellent - I was able to walk to most places of interest within 20 minutes. The last day I was there we had a rental car, and it was easy to find parking nearby. Bus stops are right there as well, though I never took public transportation. Since it is so close to tourist hotspots, be sure to check event schedules ahead of time. We got caught in parade traffic.   "
529090,40775636,2015-08-02,4107102,Tak,"I stayed 2 nights. She was a great host. This time I had no chance to see her, but his mother took care of me.
The room was located in a quite convenient area, good view of the port, many cool cafes and bars around, but relatively silent place. I could enjoy Seattle stay with their warm support."
529090,42391806,2015-08-13,4723965,Matt,"Alice was away but her mom greeted me, gave me the keys, etc.  She was extremely nice and very helpful!  The location is also very close to the Pike street market and many good restaurants, which was very convenient."
529090,44158085,2015-08-24,51368,Lauryn,My stay at Alice's flat in Belltown was great! I was in town for a conference in downtown Seattle so the location could not have been more convenient; I frequently walked to my meetings and explored the area on-foot. I had complete privacy in the bedroom and never had any issues sharing the bathroom. The apartment is pretty simple and straightforward and everything was spotless.  I was very comfortable and happy staying at Alice's.
529090,47071744,2015-09-15,41313044,Jessica,"Great location, cozy yet comfortable.  Alice was so helpful! She went above and beyond to help me when my traveling partner left her passport at home and had to overnight it to Alice's apartment.  "
20928,34338491,2015-06-07,33771514,Corey,"My stay at Brad and Liz's was exactly what I was looking for. Both Brad and Liz were very friendly and welcoming. The space was very comfortable with a cozy bed with nice linen, a small table and kitchenette and even a couch. It was all very comfortable. I only wish I had more time to enjoy the lovely gardens out back! "
20928,34753607,2015-06-11,14481081,Sam,"My girlfriend and I stayed 3 nights in Brad & Liz's new basement studio and had all the space and accommodations we needed throughout. There is super easy access to food and transit. I don't want to suggest this space was only adequate - If you grant Airbnb the status of being a radical, modern way of redistributing human access to resources, Brad & Liz are at the top of that evolutionary food chain. If their availability calendar ever overlaps with the need for a place to stay in Seattle, don't hesitate."
20928,34971766,2015-06-14,32710190,Theresa,"Love the convenient location to Ballard/Freemont and more.  Both Brad & Liz made us feel very comfortable, as if we were good friends!

The actual basement ""apt."" was very clean, tidy & updated decor`.  The use of the garden area was a special treat as the weather was fabulous!  

We will be back Brad & Liz!  "
20928,35475344,2015-06-19,24169159,Pam,We did not meet Brad and Liz as they were out of town. They made arrangements though for a friend to welcome us and be available during our stay. The one thing I would add to the current listing is that the entry to the basement guest room is down a steep set of stairs that would be difficult for anyone having mobility issues.
20928,35822706,2015-06-22,18772897,Kristi,"Brad and Liz's place was great! The location is beautiful and right by some very cool places to visit. I definitely recommend the Ballard Locks and the Ballard Sunday Farmer's Market. The basement ""apt"" had everything we needed. Access to a fridge and microwave is so helpful. And the gardens are lovely! We knew we were in good hands!"
20928,37094309,2015-07-04,9689563,Erin,"Great place to stay!  Although our hosts were out of town, it was no problem getting in and around.  Had several options left in case we did need anything.  Great room with everything we needed, great location near to transit.  Well-maintained home and beautiful yard!  "
20928,37657965,2015-07-09,33591593,Chelsea,"Brad and Liz were amazing Airbnb hosts.  They are very knowledgeable and friendly -- we loved chatting with them when running into each other.  They know the area very well and are wonderful people all-around.

Their house in Ballard was warm, welcoming, and felt just like home -- the basement room (which did not at all feel like a basement) was nice and cold during the recent heat wave.  They provided everything we could have possibly needed and then some. The bed was super comfortable and the kitchenette/dining area was extremely convenient. (Oh, and they have the two sweetest kitties hanging around the yard!)

The neighborhood is safe and interesting, too -- we loved it.  There's lots of cute shops and restaurants/bars nearby, as well as a variety of more nature-y things to do (Ballard Locks, Golden Gardens, etc).  We miss Ballard already!"
20928,38296995,2015-07-14,35625238,Elaine,"Liz and Brad welcomed us by chatting and explaining all about the place where we would call home for the next five days.  The apartment was clean, comfortable and more than adequate for our home away from home.  Even the coffee was good (good coffee with a french press maker) and we are picky!  The sitting are in the back yard is beautiful, whimsical, full of all kinds of flowers.  Brad and Liz are always busy working on something creative and industrious.  We really liked staying here for five days.  It was great place to spring from.  The neighborhood is fun too with lots going on and great eating places."
20928,38612887,2015-07-17,3415722,Ashley,"Absolutely wonderful space to stay in! Location was perfect, an easy walk to many nice cafes including Cafe Besalu. Sheets on the bed are super soft. Kitchenette has all the necessities: cups, flatware, cutting board, teapot, electric kettle, and mini fridge. Brad and Liz are excellent hosts, we felt very welcome. They gave us great recommendations for new places to check out in Ballard. It was very easy to access public transportation from this location too when we needed to head downtown or catch the bus up to Mount Vernon. We will definitely miss Jasper the cat and the lovely garden. "
20928,38868755,2015-07-19,10263396,Daniel,Listing description is accurate. We were very comfortable and Brad and Liz live in a great neighborhood -- in a quiet are that is walking distance to the main commercial strip and the Locks.
20928,39515183,2015-07-24,33698562,Justin,"Brad contacted us before check in to make sure everything was good and to make sure that they would be around when we were expecting to arrive.  Brad and Liz seemed eager to meet us, and Liz showed us all around the beautiful garden and our room.  While she showed us around she was giving us lots of great information of Seattle and Ballard, while answering any question only a local would know.  The home has lots of great character and we even got to try our first fig from their tree.  It was truly a pleasure to stay on their property.  "
20928,40456910,2015-07-31,2049232,Jeremy,"Brad & Liz are wonderful easygoing and interesting hosts. Their home including the place you'll be staying is very comfortable and clean. The area of Ballard is gorgeous and it's an easy public transport connection to Downtown. Stay here, and like me, you will fall in love with Seattle"
20928,41090267,2015-08-04,53598,Shalev,Very kind and helpful couple. Great and very comfortable space in a beautiful house and garden.   Great Neighborhood too. Would love to be back there.
20928,42262665,2015-08-12,31347830,Patricia,"Liz and Brad are just great hosts, and provided a welcoming atmosphere the moment we arrived for our week long stay.  The two resident cats, Jasper and Lily, are just so sweet and friendly. This was our first experience with Airbnb, and we couldn't be happier.  We walked through a delightful rose garden full of colorful flowering plants as we walked to and from our entrance, and this provided such a good atmosphere. 

 The quiet  location was perfect as  it was an easy walk to the Chittenden Locks, and picturesque downtown Ballard with all the great eating places and Farmer's Market on Sunday. Golden Gardens Beach is a short drive with a great walking trail. We took the #40 bus to downtown Seattle, so it was very convenient  for many reasons including ample parking.

 The bed was very comfortable with soft sheets.  In fact, I'm missing the bed!!!   The kitchenette had beautiful new cabinets, and the entire space is very light and airy due to large windows even though it is in the basement.  

Also, it was fun to spend a little time at the hosts' joint birthday party in the rose garden with their delightful friends. It was a good feeling to be included.   I am missing the Seattle area, and look forward to a return trip one day, and a chance to enjoy the Victorian home once more."
20928,42695476,2015-08-15,36574405,Michelle,"That was a great first stay at an airbnb. Brad and Liz accommodated our late arrival time with no difficulty, the place was just as advertised, and we had plenty of space. The bed was comfy- super soft sheets! We had a chance to visit with our hosts and they are fantastic people. I would absolutely stay here again. I'm allergic to cats (they have cats in the house) so I discussed that with Brad beforehand. He was quick to respond and answered all of my questions. My allergies did not bother me at all here. Overall, great visit. Thanks!"
20928,43625974,2015-08-21,35566349,Saulo,"Brad and Liz were great, the room was clean, and in a great location.  Would definitely stay here again. Again, great hosts."
20928,43929993,2015-08-23,21853004,Chris,"Brad and Liz were great. They were very welcoming and gave us some great tips about the area!
The space was very nice & comfortable and very close to a lot of great shopping and. Dining.
We wouldn't hesitate to stay again!"
20928,44420025,2015-08-26,24754397,Martin,"This is a very nice private bit of the house and we really enjoyed our stay here. Brad and Liz are super friendly and it was lovely to chat to them. I would highly recommend staying here! Also, Ballard is a lovely area... plenty of shops, cafes and restaurants."
20928,44773867,2015-08-29,36353920,Beth And Chris,"We had a great stay at Brad and Liz's beautiful house. The apartment was very clean and spacious with everything we needed including a beautiful garden. brad was available very late to let us  in, show us around and give us pointers on where to go in the neighborhood. We were walking distance to all of the bars, restaurants and shops in Ballard and had a great time exploring the area and relaxing in the garden. Would definitely stay here again!"
20928,45092551,2015-08-31,534510,Rick,This was an excellent place to stay in the beautiful neighborhood. The people were great and caring of us. The outside garden in the cats were great. Jacuzzi was fantastic as was the bed.  They should install a motion detector for the stairs going down to apartment.  If you forget to turn the light on at noon and come home at midnight it's dark.  Definately will return. 
20928,45411052,2015-09-02,32765808,Kyle,Great space in a great neighborhood. Easy street parking. Very welcoming hosts! An absolutely charming house!
20928,45783579,2015-09-06,9039827,Hari,"Everything as described, very cute and cozy space, essentially an entire unit as opposed to a rented room. Brad and Liz were very hospitable and made my trip a great experience. Thanks! "
20928,46389130,2015-09-10,13242948,Leslie,"Brad and Liz were great hosts, very pleasant and kind.The space was very clean, with coffee, tea and a mini fridge and kitchenette available for use. They also left maps of Seattle and info about things to do which was a great touch. The private entry was convenient for when we stayed out a little later. And lastly, the location was perfect! "
20928,46601697,2015-09-12,33060999,Lisa R,Brad and Liz were very responsive from the beginning. They were flexible when our arrival times changed. The apartment was great and matches the description accurately.   The property was beautiful and the neighborhood was convenient and walkable.  I would definitely stay there again.
20928,47041271,2015-09-15,37013415,Jürgen,"Obwohl das Zimmer im Untergeschoß nicht der Beschreibung entsprach (Cottage), empfanden wir es sogar besser. Liz empfing uns sehr freundlich und wies uns in alle Dinge, die zu beachten sind, ein. Da unser Sohn in Ballard wohnt waren wir nur zum Schlafen da. 
Brad konnten wir erst bei beim Checkout sehen, da er verreist war. Es fand aber ein sehr herzliches Gespräch mit ihm statt, woraus zu  schließen ist, das er ein genauso prima Gastgeber wie Liz ist. Wir können die Unterkunft mit besten Eindrücken weiter empfehlen. "
20928,47643082,2015-09-21,36585568,Lauren,"When we arrived, Brad showed us around the room/bathroom where we would be sleeping and getting ready, and then he sat down with us and chatted about what kinds of things there were to do around the area. He was extremely friendly and made great suggestions as to where to eat, what venues to check out, etc. He and Liz live in a beautiful residential neighborhood within walking area of breakfast places, nightlife, the bus system, and even the beach. We always felt safe walking back late at night and really loved the area. "
20928,48756966,2015-09-28,6868257,Jed,Great basement studio with everything you need for a few days or a week. Close enough to Ballard shops and restaurants and adequate public transport to the rest of Seattle.  
20928,49268346,2015-10-02,25362124,Paul,"Great experience - Brad was a super nice guy and everything was there as promised. Very easy to get in and out of the house, didn't have to disturb them either which was nice. Would stay again!"
20928,49638067,2015-10-05,41810339,Amy,"Brad and Liz have a wonderful home! The space they rent is beautiful and well maintained - the Internet is speedy, the bed is comfy, and the neighborhood is quiet but near lots of lovely restaurants. They were kind and welcoming hosts, and I'd recommend them with 100% enthusiasm :) thank you both for having us! "
20928,49887988,2015-10-07,30712134,Laura,"Brad and Liz's home is comfortable and situated in a really fun part of Ballard. Brad gave us a brief orientation to the neighborhood when we arrived which was really helpful. While we spent minimal time in the Alchemist's Den, it was a nice, quiet outpost to explore Ballard and the rest of Seattle from for a couple of days. Thanks Brad and Liz!"
20928,50122356,2015-10-09,490001,Alan,"Beautiful lower-level space in Brad and Liz's home, situated in a really cool city neighborhood. Brad was easily reached via cell and very warm and welcoming upon my arrival.  The place is equipped nicely with a very comfortable futon bed and sweet leather couch.  Nicely appointed bathroom is outside the actual space.  The garden outside is gorgeous and the two resident cats are very sweet and friendly. The location (Ballard) is very chill and features a lot of interesting places to hang out, as do the adjacent areas.  

This was my first experience renting a place like this and as far as I'm concerned, it was absolutely a home run in every way for me.  Next time I'm planning a Seattle trip, I will be checking these folks' availability first.   Thanks Brad and Liz.  "
20928,50494440,2015-10-12,5680874,Annie,"Brad and Liz were very welcoming and easy to talk to. If you love books, you should be in heaven as there are books everywhere! The pictures are accurate, the location is awesome! Thank you!"
20928,51288816,2015-10-19,33871325,ChrisAnn,"Brad and Liz were very welcoming and fun to talk with. My husband and I had a pleasant and relaxed stay.  We enjoyed the cats and the yard and the quiet neighborhood. The room was comfortable and as described, but the room is directly under the livingroom so you will hear a bit of upstairs activity.  We made good use of the kitchenette and wifi. The deep bath was a plus. We were out and about mostly; it was easy to walk to restaurants and the Locks from their charming home.   Thanks Brad and Liz."
20928,51574748,2015-10-21,20352924,Ron,"Great space. Great people! 
Highly Recommended!"
20928,51818522,2015-10-24,1303780,Andrew,"Very nice place to stay in a very good neighborhood. Clean and set up nicely with plenty of room new furnishings. Of course you are staying in someone's home in a private area, so you will hear normal family sounds in the main part of the house. Cats are a plus! Large comfortable room, bed is excellent. Garden level so its a great place to sleep in late!"
20928,53342006,2015-11-08,38727375,Marissa,"The room we stayed in was perfect for myself and my husband. We had lots of privacy however, felt comfortable asking Brad for anything we needed and he was accessible. The neighborhood was awesome and located in walking distance to downtown Ballard, which was so cute! I highly recommend staying here if you can, we had a wonderful experience. "
20928,53862287,2015-11-13,8950611,Wayne,"Brad and Liz welcomed me directly. They were very warm and deeply fascinating. I had to put in effort not to monopolize Brad's time. The neighborhood was perfect for my needs and, while I didn't get to walk around as much as I would have liked, the area has a lot within easy walking distance. Their daylight basement was also comfy, cozy, and perfect for my needs."
20928,54487248,2015-11-20,19737881,Lindsey,"Very accommodating hosts, cute unique space with all the essentials. Was exactly what I needed. The location is an easy to walk to buses to get downtown and very close to some beautiful parks! The only things to note: the shower is a bit non traditional and took some getting used to. It's not a completely private separate space, but the hosts were respectful and it was not a problem. I enjoyed my time here and would recommend it. "
20928,55102098,2015-11-28,8231634,Margaret,"My parter and I stayed with Brad and Liz over the Thanksgiving holiday and enjoyed the space very much.  Our hosts were friendly and welcoming and the neighbourhood is quite lovely and close to all Ballard has to offer, which is quite a bit.  The bed was comfortable as described...and I am not a futon fan.   All this and just three blocks from the people we were visiting!  Changes?  Just one:  Unscented, 'green' laundry products.  Otherwise -full marks!"
20928,55670694,2015-12-04,7927105,Lance,"Upon arrival, I was warmly welcomed by Brad! He guided me through everything I'd need to know for my visit and made me feel very comfortable.

The space was everything I needed (and more) during my week long business trip in Seattle. The various amenities in Ballard were within walking distance, and Brad had very helpful recommendations for great food and coffee.

I would absolutely stay here in the future and can't wait to visit Seattle again."
20928,55864373,2015-12-06,50226680,Andrew,Brad and Liz were wonderful hosts.  Spoke briefly with Brad the first day and from there was on my own.  Beautiful house in a great area.  Easy to get to bars and restaurants in Ballard as well as a short ride to Fremont.  Would definitely recommend to anyone looking to explore those areas and the rest of Seattle.
20928,56760599,2015-12-17,48895136,Heather,Brad and Liz were great host and the Alchemist's Den was lovely.
20928,56960769,2015-12-20,48013385,Daniel,"Great folks,  cool accommodations, and friendly cat.  Brad and Liz provide a winning Seattle experience in the hip Ballard neighborhood.   Excellent stay!"
20928,57271928,2015-12-23,7485789,Julian,"Pretty luxurious...warm, spacious, basically feels like your own apartment minus a stove. Very personable hosts as well."
5607404,37739481,2015-07-10,29688376,Ty,"The condo was very nice and clean. We comfortably slept 6 people and had plenty of space.  The condo was exactly as described.

Khrystyna was a great hostess, very responsive and accommodating.

We enjoyed our stay and look forward to our return!"
5607404,40888758,2015-08-03,29181976,Marshall,The 2 BR Townhouse was nice. There was a problem with parking as described. The parking in the covered area as too steep and the front needs work in order for the front end of the car not to scrap the broken pavement. Also the house was clean but the coffee maker had coffee grounds that had been left and were molded. Also the vent fan in the upstairs bathroom was not used because when on it smelled like something was burning. The host was communicative and did respond when had trouble with parking but there was not enough parking on the street. Also there was washcloths left in the washing machine the we had the dry them because there were not enough washcloths in the bathroom. I do feel like the host put a lot of work into renovating the townhouse and there were a lot of great finishes as described. The picture of the front of the townhouse looked different then actually what was there. The bushes out front were over the sidewalk and needed to be cut back if you were to go in the front door. Even though I have mentioned a lot of items the home was close to everything and was quite. I would consider staying there again but I do think there are a few items as mentioned that needs to be worked on. Thank you for letting us use your home.
5607404,41358293,2015-08-07,34686476,Jason,"We had a very good experience here, and would visit again.

Her place was nice, clean, and well appointed with dishes and silverware. It was as advertised. The location is also convenient -- near shopping and a very small  skateboard park.

Khrystyna was friendly and responsive to our emails and texts, plus she even contacted afterwards to see if we had left a shirt there (it wasn't ours, but it was nice to know that she was diligent in following up with her guests).

Thank you Khrystyna."
5607404,48560693,2015-09-27,15734567,Heather,"We had a girls weekend in Seattle and had an amazing time. Beds were extremely comfortable, sheets were soft and towels were comfortable. Everything as described. Host communicated well and answered questions quickly. Nice neighborhood and easy to find. Close to everything we wanted to do!! Will definitely be coming back to stay again!!!"
5607404,57285065,2015-12-24,43026274,Mark,"We stayed at Khrystyna's place Dec 22-24.  She decorated the home with Christmas lights and other Christmas items that made it feel homey and comfortable.  It was our first experience using airbnb, so we were a little unsure of what to expect - though the bar is now set very high.  The home was quaint and comfortable.  Although we tried to limit our electronics during the Christmas season, the house was fully capable with high speed internet and television in case we wanted to use it - though the main area was where we lounged each evening playing cards around the table.  The host was equally great.  She was prompt with all our questions and made the experience great.  I would highly recommend this place."
5236979,26723288,2015-02-17,27622333,James,"We really enjoyed our stay in West Seattle!

Sha'ari was an excellent host; friendly, attentive, informative, and respectful of privacy. The Garden Cottage was cozy and immaculate. 
The dogs were incredibly adorable (and I'm a cat person). 

I'm very thankful that our first airbnb experience was so positive :)

5236979,27380613,2015-03-02,221796,Laila,"What a lovely experience!  Sha'Ari (pronounced Shari) is a delightful & responsive host.  The room is cute, and more spacious than it looks, with a sweet little couch and plenty of room for your things.  Everything is well-designed and super clean.  The dogs are energetic and fun.  Delridge neighborhood is maybe just a 5-10 minute drive from the fun shops on California, or the beach at Alki.  There's tons of green space in walking distance, with parks, a trail, Camp Long, a climbing rock and more.  We'd definitely like to stay again."
5236979,28037180,2015-03-16,13325386,Elizabeth,"Sha'Ari made my husband and I feel very welcomed with a sweet note, chocolates on our pillows, and a bottle of sparkling grape juice.  We had access to a kitchenette within the room, a clean bathroom, and had no trouble coming and going as well pleased.  Sha'Ari was extremely kind to us and we would recommend her home to our friends for sure."
5236979,30319747,2015-04-20,29872429,Brenda,"A terrrifc place to stay.  Sha'Ari has a wonderful home and is an excellent host.  The location is perfect, close to downtown, easy access by car as well as public transportation.  Highly recommend."
5236979,32385738,2015-05-17,32135109,Steven,My daughter and I stayed with Sha'Ari when visiting family in Seattle.  She was a gracious and delightful host with two wonderful dogs.  The Garden Cottage was comfortable and very welcome.  She went out of her way to make sure that we had a successful and happy visit.
5236979,34145930,2015-06-05,13747658,Kristin,"Sha'ari was a kind and conscientious host, and her dogs are sweet and were rarely in the shared space. The house is a very short walk to several bus stops going downtown, which was awesome, and close to a great café called Pearl's. Sha'ari surprised us with Northwest Blend apple cider and was very willing to give tips for the area. We had a pleasant experience here!"
5236979,35217015,2015-06-16,31754459,Anna,"I thoroughly enjoyed my 5 day stay at the cottage. The bedroom and private bath were exactly as pictured and had everything I needed. Due to time constraints, I wasn't able to enjoy the beautiful gardens, but I will the next time! The location was quiet and very convenient and most of all, I loved the dogs! I highly recommend booking with Sha'Ari.  She was a great hostess."
5236979,35558781,2015-06-20,28417917,Echo,"Sha'Ari is very coming. She even prepared snacks, drinks, and yogurt for us! The room is really stylish and comfortable. We got to use the bedroom and the living room - enough space for me and my parents. Her two dogs are adorable :)"
5236979,36674683,2015-06-30,3201125,Kia,"This is a lovely, comfortable, eclectically-furnished space, and Sha'Ari was an extremely accommodating host. She went out of her way to make sure we were taken care of, and was friendly and available without being intrusive. Due to the somewhat quirky bathroom access, the space is not totally private, but it all works and we were very happy to have found such a special place to stay. Highly recommended.
"
5236979,37459728,2015-07-07,31942704,Inseon,"This was the perfect accommodation for us in Seattle.  We wanted to spend two full days in the city touring, including the July 4 fireworks at the waterfront.  Since Sha'Ari's guest quarters are separated from the rest of the house, we were able to return (quietly) late in the evening without a fuss.  Sha'Ari met us on arrival and introduced the house and the procedures to us in a clear and congenial manner and kept in touch with us on a daily basis.  Her two dogs are very friendly and well behaved.  Before our arrival, she even sent an email asking whether we would prefer to have A/C in our room since Seattle had been unusually hot for a few week. Her house is close to the city and easy to find.  We will look to stay there again the next time we're in Seattle. "
5236979,37803559,2015-07-10,37275787,Renee,"Sha'Ari was warm and welcoming! She responded quickly to emails with directions and suggestions for bus lines. Her house was just as described and a very comfortable respite after a long day. The bedroom was very comfortable and inviting and the living room was also available for extra seating.  
Sha'Ari had thought about the needs of travelers and provided granola bars and yogurt as well as cold water and a coffee maker.  I fell in love with her dogs, who were very friendly but not intrusive.  Getting to the house was easy with Uber, but the bus stop was very near.  I walked to Pearl's right around the corner and brought back a delicious salmon crepe to eat outside in the cool evening air.      
While Sha'Ari was available, I did not see her again after she welcomed me to the house.  The house plan allows for a feeling of privacy, yet I know she was available for anything I might have needed.   I enjoyed my stay at Sha'Ari's and would definitely consider staying there again on a visit to Seattle.  

"
5236979,38742814,2015-07-18,36231732,Arleen,"We had a lovely stay at this Garden Cottage.  Sha'Ari is delightful, friendly and helpful. (The dogs are just as friendly) She not only accommodated our arrival schedule but she also helped us navigate the Seattle traffic.  Best of all, she turned us onto a new pizza place that is now my favorite.  Sorry Pagliacci's.  

The suite is set up in a way that is private.  Though you do have to cross the adjoining kitchen to get to it, we never ran into Sha'Ari.  We had the place to ourselves.  It was even nice to just sit on the front porch steps and watch the sun go down.  I highly recommend this cottage."
5236979,39177755,2015-07-21,28782478,Laurie,"Sha'Ari is delightful!  We had one of those ""the world is so small"" connections as soon as I booked my reservation.  She was kind and welcoming to us and our 11 year old son who spent some time loving on her two dogs.  The room was comfortable for three and offered all the personal touches to make the stay nice.  She even got to AC going for us because it was over 90 degrees while we were there.  Her location is great yet quiet with easy access to neighborhood restaurants and beach. You can even walk down the street and watch a club soccer match.  "
5236979,39943254,2015-07-27,33783678,Sam,"Sha'ari messaged us right around our arrival in town to check our trip had been safe and to make sure we knew where we were going. The suite is clean with a relaxed atmosphere. There were some nice extra touches such as chocolates on arrival, and high-quality hair and bodywash products in the shower. The price and location combination is not to be beaten! Would definitely stay again."
5236979,40372141,2015-07-30,38474400,Roger,"The space is very nice and super clean. The dogs were sweet and easy going. We barely saw our host, as we were out enjoying the town so much. Neighborhood and house quiet and peaceful. Recommended to all."
5236979,41091400,2015-08-04,20285675,Jonell,I stayed at Sha'Ari's with two of my friends and our stay was great! We didn't see much of her but she was very easy to get a hold of when we needed her. Her two dogs are so friendly and welcoming! Overall our stay was wonderful. Thank you Sha'Ari!!
5236979,42133793,2015-08-11,23466879,Joel,Sha'Ari and her two big dogs were a gracious and sweet hosting trio! Her place is lovely—and the neighborhood is cool old West Seattle. I can't wait to get back up here to stay here again!
5236979,43195490,2015-08-17,25811226,Laura,"Although we did not meet Sha'Ari in person, she made us feel very welcome in her house. There were granola bars, yogurts, grapes, purified water and chocolates waiting for us next to the hand-written welcome sign. Sha'Ari has made a very useful map with all kind of information about the neighborhood and downtown! The place was very clean and looked really nice. Although her dogs are big and sometimes in the kitchen (you cannot use the kitchen unless you make arrangements with Sha'Ari, but you have an own fridge and microwave!), they are very sweet and quiet. They just look at you and that is it. Sha'Ari checked by text if we needed anything on the day after arrival and contacted us when we were leaving. We loved staying in her place, which is very easy to get by from the airport and from downtown with public transport (bus).  One more extra tip: use the airbnb app for the wifi password."
5236979,43577530,2015-08-20,38761740,Annabel,"I had a wonderful stay at Sha'Ari's lovely, cozy Garden Cottage in Seattle.  She greeted me upon arrival and showed me around the super cute - and comfortable suite.  I felt safe - welcome and she even provided coffee and yogurt for breakfast - so sweet.  Sha'Ari was a great communicato before and during my stay - and I had everything I needed for a wonderful visit to the Seattle area.  I definitely will try to stay again when I'm in the area!"
5236979,44125863,2015-08-24,28945137,Melissa,Had a wonderful stay at Sha'Ari's cottage.   Sha'Ari was so easy to communicate with and had lots of suggestions. Her dogs are very mellow and super sweet. The location is great and I never had a problem finding parking right out front.  Would definitely recommend and stay again. 
5236979,45245133,2015-09-01,33298239,Lou,"Sha'Ari was wonderful and checked in on us regularly to make sure we were comfortable and making our way around safely. The dogs were dolls and quite impish. We were surprised to find a wonderful supply of granola bars, yogurts, fresh plums, filtered water, teas and coffee waiting for us. Great stay!"
5236979,46129488,2015-09-08,35101856,Phyllis,"The stay was a lovely as the home. Also the area was just as pictured quiet and chill. We got there pretty late, but the set up to greet us along with the little notes made us feel welcome. Shar you were so informative about where to go we would definitely stay at the cottage again. Oh and the pups were adorable and lovable!"
5236979,46583045,2015-09-12,35510732,Susie,"We enjoyed our stay and felt very welcome! The info was very accurate, the location quite convenient for us and the dogs were very friendly.  We had a nice chat with Sha'Ari and she met our needs quickly and graciously. It's a charming property!"
5236979,47180576,2015-09-16,23074156,Leo,"Location is convenient and clean, very close to a park as well!"
5236979,47475260,2015-09-19,19097578,Kellie & Andrew,"What a lovely stay we had!!! Sha'Ari was wonderful and very welcoming (as well as her lovely dogs) the room was clean and the bed was really comfy!!! Easy to get to downtown and had a few little gems of restaurants close by. Sha'Ari was so helpful and really went the extra mile. She even let us leave our baggage after check out as we had a late flight. Definitely visit here, we hope to stay again soon :) "
5236979,48078337,2015-09-23,39613727,Kay Ann,"My stay with Sha'Ari was wonderful! She met me when I got there and was very friendly and welcoming. Her house was in a cute neighborhood not far from downtown, only a short bus ride away. She provided information on good places to eat and things to see, including a fabulous breakfast place right around the corner. The suite was amazing: comfortable and beautifully decorated, with plenty of space to hang out. The bed was extremely comfortable as well. I never wanted to leave! Her 2 dogs were also very laid back and sweet, and I loved playing with them. This was my first Airbnb experience and it vastly exceeded all my expectations. I would wholeheartedly recommended staying with Sha'Ari and will definitely do so again if I ever find myself back in Seattle!"
5236979,48706856,2015-09-28,29833965,Susan,I enjoyed staying at Sha'Ari's house.  The bed was very comfortable.  Her dogs were wonderful.  Sha'Ari gave me great ideas for restaurants and attractions in Seattle.
5236979,49622624,2015-10-05,41637784,Claudia,"Sha'Ari was a fantastic host! She and her adorable doggies were home to greet my partner and I when we arrived in Seattle. The space is clean, comfortable, and adorable! She gave us our space while also being attentive. Would definitely stay here again! 5 Stars!"
5236979,50624195,2015-10-13,34377143,Susan,"Sha'Ari  was there to let me in, give me a tour and  introduce me to the two puppies, who were wonderful and sweet. Then she let me explore. Anytime I needed anything, I could text from anywhere in Seattle and she got back to me with answers or help. She had a lovely guide book with a listing of places to see, things to do and a couple recommended places to pick up supplies or grab a cup of coffee. Couldn't be better. "
5236979,53341103,2015-11-08,44506975,Leah,"The cottage is beautiful, as is the sitting area in the garden. The location was conveniently close to downtown and consistently had parking. Sha'Ari was a lovely host. She provided everything we could have possibly needed, and more. 

Words cannot describe the level adorableness achieved by the dogs."
5236979,54371655,2015-11-19,32780419,Remi,"The posting was pretty spot on! The bus ride literally took 10 min into Downtown Seattle (with rush hour traffic). Sha'Ari was a perfect host with much recommendations. She checked in from time to time and also gave the needed privacy. My week stay here was just perfect. Sabu and Mikah were a joy, they also greeted me when I came back for a few (website hidden) This was my first AIRBNB booking, thanks for everything again Sha'Ari!"
5236979,55101049,2015-11-28,21234893,Emily,Sha'ari was a wonderful host and her dogs were so friendly and sweet. The bed was very comfortable with plenty of blankets. Sha'ari was kind enough to even provide snacks and coffee. The bedroom and bathroom are exactly as described. The location is convenient to the Alki beach boardwalk and downtown Seattle. I would definitely stay here again!
5236979,55534280,2015-12-01,2591044,Paul,"Just what I needed--quiet, solitude, and an understanding host. Sha'Ari welcomed me with open arms (including her sweet doggies) and the vibe of the house was chill. The location was great with easy access to freeways, local stores, and proximity to downtown.

Thanks again for a wonderful stay :)"
5236979,56019927,2015-12-08,34443822,Miguel Angel,"todo muy  bien, una excelente  ubicación, unos perros muy lindos y ella muy atenta. La  casa  es  muy bonita vale mucho la pena.

sus perros  son hermosos :)

"
5236979,56311290,2015-12-12,48260401,Tianren,Sha'Ari is a very cool and passionate host and so are her two dogs. She left me with private space just as what I want. We arranged the first meet before I arrived. The room and decorations are perfect and I have a totally private living room to enjoy free time. Free parking is on the outside of the house. 10 Mounties to downtown without commuting traffic.
5236979,57015550,2015-12-21,45010160,Tana,My stay with Sha'Ari was rejuvenating. She and her lovely dogs welcomed me warmly and made me feel comfortable and at home from the start.  Her place has a positive and peaceful energy.  I took full advantage of her Sound Healing option which was divine! I will definitely be returning.
189156,506930,2011-09-06,940883,Jason,"Harriet is an awesome host.  She kept us informed and communicated with us regularly before and during our stay.  cool location and pretty view of the water right out the windows.  

we spent a lot of time downtown and found that a car was necessary to get back and forth although there is a water taxi close by if you want to walk to transit to get there.  West seattle also had some nice streets to walk down and some good food.   

Thanks again!"
189156,524401,2011-09-12,272239,Tim & Kelly,We enjoyed our stay very much! Very nice unit. Enjoyed the large physical space & the closet to get our stuff out of the way. Took the ferry over to Seattle one day. Use your GPS to make travel to & from Seattle easier. You do need a car to get around. Our full sized truck made parking tight but we managed it! Easy squeasy for any size smaller! Really enjoyed the bread! Thanks Harriet!! Hope to use your place again! 
189156,572803,2011-09-26,1199965,Christie,"My weekend at Harriets charming apartment was a God send.  The place was very clean, with an awesome view of the sound.  Harriet was very helpful in planning my events for my weekend.  It was so quiet and relaxing I hated to go home.  West Seattle was an adventure in itself, one that I enjoyed immensely.  The Terrible Beauty Pub was a delight and had great food at a reasonable price.   Thank you Harriet for sharing your home with me.  I will definitely be back!!!"
189156,630844,2011-10-16,893492,Peter,"That was a great stay in a really spacious apartment. It is clean, has a separate entrance and a gorgeous view over the Puget Sound and the Olympic Mountains. The parking space right in front of the house was very much appreciated. 
Check it out, you won't miss anything."
189156,653426,2011-10-22,1284018,Jim,"Harriet is a gracious host. Her studio apt. is very light, cozy and relaxing, with an outstanding view of Puget Sound and the Olympic Mts. The sunsets are amazing! West Seattle has several fine restaurants -- and I bought my all-time favorite pair of flip-flops in a little shoe store there."
189156,660673,2011-10-24,1298035,Ben,This is a very comfortable and beautiful apartment in a great neighborhood. Everything was very clean and well-kept and the bed was quite comfortable. Harriet was very communicative and helpful and everything went perfectly. Very highly recommended!
189156,682359,2011-11-01,1292145,Marlene,"Had a special friend come for a visit  from the Midwest & wanted to share the beautiful Pacific Northwest with him. Harriet's place was so wonderful & cozy, we almost felt like we were living there instead of just 'borrowing' for the week! Very reasonable and very private & host was available, but not intrusive. Can't wait to have another excuse for a 'stay-cation' and stay at Harriet's place!"
189156,703861,2011-11-08,394073,Lucy,Harriet's apt was great. she is very accommodating host. the place was clean and she provide many information about Seattle for us. The apt is well located on the hill. you see nice view of the lake and mountain and yet not so far from the city. There is 24 hours supermarket near by you can get almost anything.  We enjoyed our time here. You will have a wonderful time if you choose this place. 
189156,735036,2011-11-21,1374413,Tom,"Comfortable apartment with a great view of the water from the patio.
It is in a great location for bus service into downtown Seattle
Close to West Seattle & Alki area with lots to do
"
189156,768400,2011-12-06,1335659,Deana,"This is a beautiful, new, immaculate studio with an incredible view of the Puget Sound. My daughter and I had to come to Seattle for me to handle some business and Harriet's place was perfect. We walked down to a great park on the water one day and West Seattle was perfect for shopping and close enough in to UW that it was only a 15-20 min drive. Very nice, fully equipped accommodations. I recommend this place highly. Thanks, Harriet. I think we may be back!!"
189156,772395,2011-12-08,740091,Connie,The studio is very spacious.  The living area and dining area is large and the closet is almost like another small room.  It's newly renovated and extremely cozy like a real home.  Harriet is extremely nice and responsive.  She answers all your questions.  I will be staying a little longer. :)
189156,871911,2012-01-19,740091,Connie,"Harriet's studio was so comfortable and cozy, I decided to extend my stay another month.  The space is open and has a home-like feel.  I always looked forward to coming back at the end of the day, to relax peacefully with views of the sky and water.  The private entrance allows you to come and go as you please,    I truly enjoyed my stay and thank you Harriet so much for allowing me to experience your beautiful studio.  I highly recommend.  Harriet is reliable and communicative.  I hope to have the opportunity to stay there again!!"
189156,892900,2012-01-30,1649912,Zoe,Great great ime and lovely place. Harriet stayed up to welcome us in spite of our late arrival.
189156,915805,2012-02-12,386454,Richard,"Harriet's apartment is located in a lovely neighborhood in West Seattle, with great views of the water and mountains.  Communicating with Harriet was easy and she was available to meet and give us an overivew of the apartment.  The large studio apartment is behind the garage, and was furnished with everything we needed.  A nice touch was the bagels & coffee.  We spent two nights at the apartment and did not have a chance to use public transportation like the buses or the water taxis.  It is a pretty easy drive to the freeway to get you to downtown Seattle or to the airport.  We would definitely stay here again."
189156,956824,2012-02-28,1507635,Mikaela,"My stay at Harriet's was great.  Everything I needed was right there, and I had an amazing view of the sound.  Harriet was very accommodating, although I didn't need much since she had it all waiting.  Would definitely stay here again."
189156,1083368,2012-04-04,1142709,Maureen,"The apartment is exactly as pictured.  It is so quiet, no street sounds and no noise, it was perfect sleeping for us.  Another big plus is it is a very private little apartment with your own little parking place.  It was very close to the people we were visiting in West Seattle and we were delighted to have found Harriet.  The big closet allows for a nice place to keep your belongings keeping your space nice and tidy.  If the fireplace was working (it currently sets off the smoke detector) I would have given it 5 stars!"
189156,1210226,2012-05-01,2007437,Vaquero,"Harriet's place is beautiful, peaceful, and inspiring! And Harriet is quite attending as a host. Her apartment was a wonderful home port for our explorations of the Puget Sound. We highly recommend it."
189156,1264234,2012-05-11,133161,Mindy,"I stayed at Harriet's on my first visit to Seattle. The studio is located in a safe, quiet neighborhood in west Seattle. It was a short drive to downtown, but far enough to get away from the fast paced and busy downtown area after long days of touring around. The studio was very spacious and well stocked (hairdryer, plates, microwave, etc.). Harriet was very hospitable and flexible in accommodating my late arrival. I would stay here again!"
189156,1293294,2012-05-17,1736796,Sara,Wonderful stay at Harriet's beautiful immaculate studio apartment.  The view is spectacular and the patio is inviting. Harriet was very helpful and the location for us was perfect. Thanks Harriet!!
189156,1588183,2012-06-29,888763,Sara,We had a wonderful stay at Harriet's. The apartment was great and Harriet herself was a sweetheart! Beautiful views and lots of closet space and Harriet provided anything we could've needed. We loved having the opportunity to explore West Seattle and downtown Seattle was just a bus or water taxi ride away. We came without a car and while it probably would've been more convenient to have one - we were able to walk or take the bus everywhere we needed to go. And the walk through Harriet's West Seattle neighborhood was just lovely. Beautiful views of the Puget Sound and there's even a friendly neighborhood cat that will accompany you part of the way (Hi Sassy!). I can't wait to visit Seattle again and would definitely stay at Harriet's in the future!
189156,1673089,2012-07-09,2874002,Pam,The reservation was canceled 24 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
189156,1695499,2012-07-13,2153727,Jenna,"This is a great space and location for a Seattle visit. The rooms were spacious with plenty of places to store luggage and personal items. The peekaboo view of Puget Sound from the patio was a nice plus. Harriet was a good host, greeting us upon our arrival and then giving us privacy to come and go as we pleased.  "
189156,1723011,2012-07-16,2764511,John,"Situated just north of stunning Washington Park and the south end of the Alkai beach area less than a block from the sound puts this hillside small apartment in easy access to all of west Seattle.  The main shopping area along California street is a five minute drive away.  The Vashon ferry is less than a mile to the south.  The apartment is small but more than adequate for two people and the view of the entire sound and Olympic mountains is nothing less than stunning.  Sunsets are worth the wait.  It is also one of the most quiet, tranquil places we have ever stayed, with little noise other than the birds and waves.  We shall return."
189156,1851620,2012-07-31,2580709,Lee,This studio was perfect for our studio stay. We loved the quiet area and beautiful views!
189156,1949553,2012-08-11,1389821,Franka,"Harriet was a great host, very considering of the needs of our 14months old. We loved to live close by Lincoln Park (a 20 minutes walk to the South) and the Elliott Bay Brewing Brewpub on California (another 20 minutes walk, this time to the North). 
The studio is very sunny, with an open floor plan, and features a walk-in closet. The outdoor deck is a plus, and we could even barbecue. We loved our stay!"
189156,2026304,2012-08-19,1997826,Rachel,I really enjoyed staying at Harriet's studio.  It was very comfortable and spacious and the location was fantastic - very close to Alki beach and a 20 minute drive to Downtown.  Harriet was friendly and welcoming and I would definitely stay here again.
189156,2131945,2012-08-29,1858675,Andy,"It was nice, quiet, and comfortable - just what we were looking for. Also, I highly recommend going to Bakery Nouveau to start off your mornings!"
189156,2190925,2012-09-04,2646653,Ben,"We came to Seattle and stayed for 5 days. The apartment is in a great location, clean and tidy and the host is great. We loved staying here!"
189156,2306363,2012-09-17,3168786,Bonnie,"Wonderfully cozy with a great sunset view from the deck. Harriet was very nice and welcoming. Private and well appointed. Great location as everything is so close yet a very quiet neighborhood. This place is one of our new favorites, we will be back."
189156,2456603,2012-09-30,1425308,Jason,"We are not city people, so Seattle was a bit overwhelming for us when we drove into town after being in the wilderness for several days, but how lucky that we had Harriet's studio to retire to in the evenings (actually, we retired in the afternoons because it was so peaceful). The West Seattle location was quiet, calm, and had a perfect view over the sound to the Olympic mountains, which we enjoyed from the patio. The studio had everything we needed and was clean, bright and comfortable. "
189156,2623144,2012-10-15,3575740,Rey,"This is definetely a relaxing spot!  It's on a very nice and quiet street, the view is awesome and the nearby park is a plus!
I know where to stay next time I come back to west seattle. :)"
189156,2661921,2012-10-20,3167519,Nick,We enjoyed our stay with Harriet.  The private room and great view of Puget Sound made a great base for our visit to Seattle.  The place was very clean and quite big.  We would definitely stay with Harriet again. 
189156,2703450,2012-10-24,1777771,Ed,"Very professional, responsible, clean and nice person. Could not ask for more. Love the apartment, the view and specifically cleanliness. Thank you!!"
189156,2742310,2012-10-28,3923694,Mick,"This was my first experience with airbnb, and it was delightful.  Harriet's place is located in a beautiful part of Seattle, and the view from the studio is magnificent (the Sound is visible from the windows and a deck outside).  The location is quiet, removed from busy streets, yet only two miles away from some great restaurants and bars.  My wife and I had no issues finding the place using the Apple Maps app.  The bed is comfy, WiFi is a nice touch, and there is parking directly outside (although for no more than one car).  Harriet was very pleasant and gave us some good pointers on places to eat.    "
189156,2824540,2012-11-07,3550356,Jeanette,"This was the perfect place for our vacation.  We had the bottom studio apartment with it's own access.  The apartment has a beautiful view of  the sound.   When the weather is nice you could sit on the patio and have a nice cup of coffee or adult beverage and see Bainbridge, Vashone, and I think it is Blake Island.

The studio was modern and very clean.  
We would definitely return to rent this studio."
189156,2867993,2012-11-12,3868463,Phillip,"A nice comfortable studio with more than adequate room.  The water view is a definite plus.  Will probably recommend it to visiting relatives.
"
189156,2888902,2012-11-15,2063656,Beth,"Harriet was very helpful, and her place was perfect for my stay. She was available by text message and let me borrow her iron. The place is comfy and the neighborhood around gave me an authentic West Seattle experience."
189156,3450352,2013-02-01,3225221,Thomas,"Staying in Harriets Studio in West Seattle was great. I spent a rather long 2 1/2 months there with my girlfriend and we felt quite comfortable. Harriet was a very nice host that respected our privacy and was always helpful if needed.
It is a very quiet place and has a great view on the water. 

The only downside was a very uncomfortable bed. It was literally almost falling apart with screws coming out everywhere and making a lot of noise when you lay down.  

All in all it was a nice experience and I would stay there again. 
"
189156,3539541,2013-02-14,4612940,Jill,"When we first arrived to the neighborhood where Harriet lives, we were blown away by all of the beautiful houses and the view of Puget Sound. When we got to Harriet's house, we were giddy with excitement to see the view of the sound (although it is winter and you can see more through the trees). The lodging was perfect for our vacation. We felt like we had a comfy place to come home to each day. It was nice not to have to fight downtown Seattle traffic each day and to explore West Seattle. We have a lot of respect for how Harriet values recycling and composting.

No regrets on our first AirBNB stay and we would definitely return to this place."
189156,3910572,2013-03-26,3008927,Stanley,"It is a nice roomy studio with a fantastic view.  Harriet is very nice and the location is great for taking walks, ten minutes from a park that abuts Ouget Sound."
189156,3968156,2013-03-31,2256481,Andrew,"Cozy, quiet apartment in beautiful West Seattle. Amazing view of the Puget Sound at sunset. "
189156,4202659,2013-04-18,4885006,Eilish,"I would highly recommend staying at this lovely place.  It was sweet, in lovely quiet location, and setup for the level of serenity I wished for during this short trip.  I hope to return! :-)"
189156,4970284,2013-06-04,6370078,Loretta,"We stayed with Harriet last weekend and it was a peaceful, quiet place to stay.  The apartment is just the right size and clean.  It was a nice respite from being in downtown Seattle every day."
189156,5088204,2013-06-11,6504176,Thanh,We stayed here during a short trip to Seattle and it was a very pleasant experience.  Harriet responded to my inquiries very quickly prior to booking.  She's very accommodating and made sure we were comfortable and had everything we needed upon arrival.  The studio apt has a nice view of Puget Sound with a cute garden. Highly recommended!
189156,5249554,2013-06-20,2488757,Noelle,"Such a lovely apartment. We had a gorgeous view of the sound and was lucky to enjoy the beautiful weather during our stay.  West Seattle may be a few bus stops from downtown, however the main junction on California is adorable :)  Harriet's studio provided exactly what we wanted throughout our getaway!"
189156,6123863,2013-07-31,3841902,Fred & Julia,"What a wonderful little place. My hubby and I absolutely loooved it. Harriet even left us some flowers and champagne to celebrate our new marriage. so thoughtful!! The apartment has everything we needed, a nice warm bed, clean linen, dishes, tv and books. We definitely want to come back. "
189156,6340549,2013-08-09,5997909,Kristina-Anna,"Harriet is ever so friendly and nice. She was unbelievably helpful and her accommodation is really cosy on a rainy day.
I would clearly chose her venue again."

189156,6455981,2013-08-13,2622066,Andrea,"Harriet's place is in a great location for West Seattle, Alki and the Fauntleroy Ferry.  It is a large studio with room to store suitcases out of the way and hang up clothes.  The kitchen was well equipped.  There were comfortable chairs for reading and the outside deck and view are wonderful. It is  an uphill walk to eating establishments, grocery, etc., so more convenient to have a car available or bike.Lincoln Park is a short walk (flat) and a lovely park to play in the water, hunt for stone and watch the ferries.  We are frequent Seattle visitors, but Harriet was available if needed and has many guides available for any new visitors.  We would definitely recommend this place"
189156,6805103,2013-08-26,5839576,Christine,"Harriet and her place were perfect. Because of an injury during our vacation, we inquired whether the place was free of stairs. Harriet not only assured us that it was, but she also helped us out in extra little ways, which we appreciated. And then she gave us complete privacy.

We loved the sunny deck with its view of the Sound, with plenty of chairs for entertaining guests during the day. The bed was comfortable, the kitchen was bright, and we had all we needed. "
189156,7011328,2013-09-03,6597480,Shane,Ok stay. Not as clean as we would have liked. Host was very nice and helpful though. Had a beautiful view.
189156,7245453,2013-09-13,937196,Ruthanne,Harriet's place was perfect!  The location was great.  It was in a nice quiet neighborhood but with in short distance to good food and the water.  The view was also really nice.  The studio was clean and beautifully lit with natural light.  We would definitely stay here again.  Harriet is a very nice and interesting person; she's really easy to talk to.  She was always available when we had questions or needed directions.  Thumbs up!
189156,7937540,2013-10-08,1649187,Adam,"This apartment was wonderful.  It is quiet and right on the water with an great view.  it is spacious, clean, and the bed is crazy comfortable.  There is a separate entrance so you really feel as though you are staying in your own apartment with all the privacy that comes with it.  Harriet is very nice and seems to really care about your overall experience.  It is also located near California street which has a bunch of places to eat and drink. "
189156,7993317,2013-10-11,9169047,Josh,"Place had a nice view. Bed was a really soft futon. Apartment could of been a lot cleaner. Overall not impressed. Air b&b is a pain to use. Much prefer VRBO and flipkey.

Josh"
189156,8068286,2013-10-14,9232659,Alicia,"Exactly what we wanted.  A private space that felt like we were locals, a great view and a nice-sized bed.  Harriet was very welcoming.  She gave us a quick tour of the space, handed us our keys and then left us to enjoy our space.  The apartment is spacious and has a big kitchen area with a two-burner range, microwave, refrigerator, pots/pans, utensils and dishware.  Cable tv and wireless is also available.  We'd definitely stay again."
189156,10921865,2014-03-13,9530051,Brian,"I had a longer stay than usual at Harriet's place, a couple months, and it was so amazing and peaceful. Harriet was very responsive and an excellent host.  The entrance is private, it really is an apartment. The view is breathtaking. And it is very clean. The queen size bed is super comfortable. Thanks for the wonderful stay."
189156,13809095,2014-06-04,9389405,Carol And Tom,The reservation was canceled 67 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
189156,16006289,2014-07-20,1815298,Whitney,"Harriet was most accommodating and helpful concerning our stay. She offered assistance in several ways and was receptive to requests that helped us have a very relaxing time. The neighborhood was quiet, the apartment was comfortable and we particularly enjoyed the proximity to the water, to ferries and to downtown Seattle. We even found West Seattle to be really fun! We shopped for groceries and cooked several meals at the apartment with no problem. We had everything we needed to spends our days out exploring and our late evenings watching the sun set from the garden patio. "
189156,16297511,2014-07-25,15972197,Meaghan,"We stayed at Harriet's apartment at the end of July and had a wonderful experience. Harriet was quick to respond to our inquiries and answer any questions we had. The apartment is cute and well-equipped - it was nice to be able to cook some meals while we were visiting Seattle. It is in a convenient location in West Seattle, which has its own little downtown area and a park close by, but is still a quick drive to Seattle. Would definitely stay again! "
189156,17288675,2014-08-10,17595932,Michael,"This was a great spot for us to come home to after our long days out in Seattle or hiking in the Cascades.   How great to have breakfast on the patio overlooking the Puget Sound!   Everything in the apartment was just right, and Harriet was helpful in giving us some tips about the area, and what was going on in the city while we were there.
"
189156,17521436,2014-08-13,6428332,Phyllis,"Harriet was a great host.  When she learned of our later arrival because of a delayed plane, she wrote to us and asked if there was any food/drink that we would like to have waiting for us.  It was there when we arrived.  

Harriet's place was clean, neat, well-appointed, and the bed was very comfortable.  The views from our private deck were just as pictured and it was wonderful having coffee overlooking the Sound.

On our first night, Harriet directed us to a variety of restaurants just a few minutes from her home; on the way, the views of the Sound were breathtaking, and the restaurant we went to (Cactus) had great Tex-Mex cuisine.  The sunset view from there was spectacular.

We loved being out of the hustle and bustle of the city and the water taxi taking us from West Seattle to Seattle was close and convenient.  On our ride home in the dark, we were treated to a lightening show above the city.  

We'd stay with Harriet again, and definitely in the area in which she lives.
"
189156,17789075,2014-08-17,3119086,Brandon,"This was a wonderful airbnb experience all-around! Harriet was a fantastic host, quickly responding to my availability request and other questions in order to arrange my arrival and departure. The apt was very clean, quiet, and comfortable. Comfortable bed. The space was plenty big for one person and would be great for a couple or possibly even a small family (1 or 2 kids) as well. The closet area has plenty of room, pretty much is another room, to set-up a pack-and-play or two. The location was also a plus with a nice view out over the water in a quiet neighborhood. Very peaceful. Wish I had more time during my visit to enjoy the neighborhood. I had a car and getting to SoDo each morning took about 15-20 minutes. I will definitely check to see if this place is available next time I have to be in Seattle for work. "
189156,18001182,2014-08-20,12833458,Sean,Harriet was a wonderful host and we had a great time while staying with her. Very accommodating and responsive. The room was very nice and well-stocked and the view from the patio is gorgeous. Thanks for everything.
189156,18209717,2014-08-23,7100313,Wenming,We spent three nights at Harriet's space. It is cozy and just as described. The location is perfect and the view is so beautiful! It was a pity that we were in the national parks during the day and missed the sunset from this place. Harriet is very helpful and accommodating. She educated us on the market and food in the area. She also has a smartTV in the room for us to use Netflix. It was a great stay and we would definitely love to stay with her if we visit Seattle again.
189156,20567532,2014-10-01,20740026,James,"Charming accommodations and patio with a beautiful view of Puget Sound.  Harriet is a gracious and available host.  Not luxurious , but 5 stars for the price."
189156,20976238,2014-10-08,1775328,Cindy,Thank you Harriet for letting us stay in your beautiful home. Great location for us. Away from the noise of the city but close enough to get to the Space Needle in under 20 minutes (no traffic for us). The room was exactly as described. Thanks again! Dan and Cindy  October 2014
189156,21240960,2014-10-13,21876546,Kenneth,"Lovely view, quiet, comfortable."
189156,21608686,2014-10-20,4910215,Brad,Awesome view. Awesome experience.
189156,22717974,2014-11-12,15525118,New,"Harriet is a great hostess, with a wonderful place to boot, which served well as a home base during a job interview and area exploration trip. Admittedly, we were a bit spoiled by atypical Seattle winter weather, but the views were fantastic, the bed was extremely comfortable and everything was as quiet as could be. Then, as an unexpected plus, West Seattle is a walking-distance haven with great shops, great people and a great farmers' market. I did hit my head on a light, but that was due to a 6'5"" moment of trail mix gluttony--shouldn't be a problem for 99% of people and nothing was broken. Thank you Harriet, we'll be in touch if we need more short term lodging in WA!"
189156,23445070,2014-12-01,14022097,Carey,"Harriet was welcoming and accommodating.  The unit functioned very well for us with a private entrance.  I loved sitting at the small kitchen table and looking at the bright blue sky and newly fallen snow on the Olympic Mountains in the distance the day after Thanksgiving.  Because our son lives a few blocks away, we are hoping to come back."
189156,24530618,2014-12-30,9269338,Holly,"Our Christmas stay at Harriet's was delightful!  We were met within minutes of our arrival.  Everything was as described on the website or even better!  The studio is very private and quiet.  The location is perfect for us as our daughter lives in West Seattle and we plan on being repeat occupants. 

We enjoyed shopping in the fun shops and had many delicious meals in the many varied restaurants in West Seattle.

Harriet's apartment is very well stocked, we wanted for nothing!  The bed is very comfortable, the apartment very clean and spacious and the view is to die for. "
189156,25109719,2015-01-06,9897404,Steve,Harriet's place was most wonderful. It's a great deal for locating so close to the beach and parks. The deck was perfect for the view.  
189156,25841100,2015-01-27,23942988,Fred,"This is a wonderfully serene and comfortable unit. The view -- even in January -- is lovely, and the room is spacious. Calling it a ""room"" is unfair. This place has one very large living/sleeping/kitchen/dining area spread across the breadth of the house, plus a sizable bath and a huge walk-in closet. Not to mention a patio and deck! Harriet provided us with a warn welcome, very clear and understandable instructions and tips, and then she got out of our way and left us with privacy. 

This was out very first airbnb experience, and it will not be our last!"
189156,26380020,2015-02-10,26263178,Lisa,Harriet was a wonderful host and her place was exactly what I needed - a bit of peace and quiet. Harriet even kindly drove me to the supermarket when I arrived to get me set up for the 3 days. Really lovely area with plenty of shops and restaurants to visit if necessary - became addicted to the French Bakery! Thank you Harriet
189156,26701267,2015-02-17,14572243,Stephanie,"Just got back from Harriet's beautiful little studio and already wanting to go back. It has great views peeking out to the Puget Sound, so much so that it almost makes you want to stay put the entire time. A great spot to if you want to just stay put and cozy up to a great view or if you want a home base to venture out into the neighborhood from. Lots of great access to parks and the ferry (!) which goes to Vashon and Southworth. I'd recommend parking your car close to the ferry port and just walking onto the ferry (which offers food and beer/wine). Plenty of restaurants and little shops on California ave, about a mile away. Harriet was a great host, readily available and left me to do my thing, which is exactly what I wanted. Great place to stay, I will most definitely be coming back :) "
189156,30019308,2015-04-16,27445339,Tim,"Lovely place to stay for our first month in the USA! Fantastic views as have been mentioned lots. 

Harriet was very helpful & the studio is the bottom floor of her house but still very private. 

Thanks for the pleasant stay :)"
189156,30418222,2015-04-21,1747375,Andrianna Nix,The studio was wonderful. Very clean and comfortable. The view is amazing. The pictures dont do it justice. Harriett was very friendly and helpful. I would gladly stay here again.
189156,30614758,2015-04-25,3313947,Stephen+Nicole,Harriet was a great hostess. She was very friendly and her communication was superb. Her space was well situated for us on a very quite street with a gorgeous view. Plenty of amenities within a few minutes drive of the apt. The apartment was clean and well outfitted with everything needed to feel at home. The kitchen was well supplied. There were plenty of clean towels in the bathroom. Harriet also accommodated our 1.5 year old with a crib and high chair which made our lives much easier. The apartment is in the back and lower level below the rest of the house. The entrance was in the back which made it feel pretty private. 
189156,31381096,2015-05-04,3051894,Suchit,"I stayed with Harriet for one week. Her place is absolutely fantastic, and she is a wonderful host. The pictures and description are accurate as she has described, Harriet is as available as you need her to be, and the view from the porch/balcony is just amazing.

We have a five month old baby with us, so the pack and play was also very helpful! The neighborhood is quiet and residential and generally needs a car to get around (as does most of Seattle), but is ten minutes from the urban part of West Seattle, and 20 min from downtown Seattle.

Would definitely stay here again!!"
189156,31960796,2015-05-12,30696171,Ulla,Harriet was very accommodating to our specific needs and was very responsive and supportive of any last minute plan adjustments or communication needs. Harriet greeted us nicely at the check-in and provided a great walk-through the apartment. The apartment has a great view and was pleasant to stay at. Thank you Harriet!
189156,33705759,2015-05-31,32856153,Lynn,"The listing was exactly as explained and pictured.  It was in a very nice neighborhood and had an extraordinary view of the water and mountains.  It was very clean, comfortable, and quiet.  I would rent it again."
189156,34954796,2015-06-14,19460688,Joan,"Harriet welcomed us and gave us a tour of the studio.  She offered information about the area and was very welcoming. Due to a bit of miscommunication, she was concerned about our arrival.  We felt welcomed and comfortable.  

The spotless studio is situated around the back of the property and has a lovely deck with patio table, chairs and umbrella offering view of the water and the beautiful mountains.  There is also a covered deck with a grill. The studio is well equipped with kitchen supplies. We were grateful for the number of towels that were available. It has a great walk-in closet which allows you to unpack and keep the suitcases out from underfoot. There is a small but comfortable seating area and a nice sunny kitchen with small table and chairs. 

It was a perfect spot for us to visit our son and his family in West Seattle.  The neighborhood was quiet and near plenty of restaurants, grocery store and coffee shops.  

We would certainly recommend it and hope to return.
"
189156,36544326,2015-06-29,32261132,Charlotte,"I am sorry to say we only briefly met Harriet.  She was out of town all but one day of our stay.  We enjoyed the lovely location of this property and were VERY glad to have the parking spot supplied!!  
It was very warm while we were there, but the apartment is located on the ground floor as a walk-out unit and it stays pretty cool.
"
189156,37467026,2015-07-07,1737320,Dan,Harriet went out of her way to make us feel welcome.  The space was very nice and filled our needs.  The neighborhood was very quiet (except on the evening of July 4 when it was noisy all over the country)  We particularly enjoyed breakfast outside with a view of the sound.  
189156,37976336,2015-07-12,33466294,Dena,"My husband and I had a wonderful stay at Harriet's apartment. There was plenty of space, comforts of home, and a breathtaking view. The neighborhood was accessible to shops, restaurants and beaches via a short drive or walk. It is also very easy to travel to downtown Seattle via car or water taxi. We tend to be independent, but when we did want assistance with tourism advice, Harriet was very accessible and happy to oblige. I would highly recommend this space! We can't wait to go back. "
189156,39026353,2015-07-20,29956383,Jim,"Easy going directions and flexible. Harriet was welcoming without intruding. Very quiet neighborhood and gorgeous view of the sound and Olympic mountains. Clean and comfortable space, very private. Could not have been better. "
189156,39419488,2015-07-23,37150616,Julie,"Great location with wonderful view.  The house is in a quiet, residential neighborhood and a close drive to central West Seattle.  Harriet checked in with me after I arrived and again when I left.  Studio was comfortable with a thoughtfully stocked kitchen and bathroom - lots of towels.  The private outside space is great - deck overlooking Puget Sound."
189156,39701373,2015-07-25,38694768,Cordo,"We chose Harriet's studio because the location was close to friends we were visiting.  The view from the deck behind the apartment was amazing!  The apartment was clean and pleasant with good light.  The only downside to the experience was checking in.  Due to a miscommunication, we were unable to gain access to the apartment our first night.  Harriet made amends by refunding all costs but the airbnb service fee and the cleaning fee.  We spent one night instead of two in this lovely space."
189156,39945147,2015-07-27,18973991,Silaja,We had a great time at Harriet's place. She was very easy to contact and had a pack and play set up for our son when we got there. The place is small but very cozy and has all necessary amenities. It's lovely to use the deck out front and enjoy the gorgeous water view. It's probably one of the best in town! It was quiet and peaceful and I would highly recommend the house.
189156,41069270,2015-08-04,8073768,Annabelle,"This was a charming studio with gorgeous views of the water.  We had everything we needed to make ourselves feel at home, including all the necessities for the baby (pack n play and high chair and a sink perfect for a bath).  our host was very welcoming and gracious and made sure we had everything we needed.  The neighborhood is safe and friendly.  We had a parking spot, which was very convenient.  The bed was very comfortable and everything was very clean."
189156,41445650,2015-08-07,25600275,Danielle`,"We had a lovely stay at Harriet's place. Check in was easy and convenient. We didn't actually meet Harriet although she was available to answer any questions we needed. The place is just a short drive/ cab ride to downtown Seattle. Far enough away to be peaceful and relaxing. Beautiful views, and West Seattle was just a short walk away. Great place, I would highly recommend it! "
189156,42073895,2015-08-10,40504972,Lisa,Everything was as expected. It was nice to be in proximity to Alki Beach. We would recommend to friends.
189156,43538461,2015-08-20,11920373,Allison,"It was a great stay at Harriet's studio. The area was very nice; it was quiet and relaxing. The apartment was cozy, relaxing and had everything we needed. The view outside was gorgeous and I highly recommend this place."
189156,43858178,2015-08-22,680997,Sid,"Harriet has a really cute place w/ very comfy bed! I never slept so good! Her place is everything it says it is. Thanx, Harriet!"
189156,44428655,2015-08-26,3069697,Patricia,"Although this unit was in a very nice part of town the unit did not meet the expectations from the description.  Harriet was abrupt to us when we first drove up and it did not get better from there.  The unit is actually under the house, which cannot be seen from the pictures.  There were many spiders, some two inches in size and the yard was not maintained, not comfortable for use, and full of many many spiders in the unkept bushes.  The view was only peek-a-boo due to the overgrown bushes and trees blocking the view.  The kitchen as another problem as we had hoped to cook and bought food.  But when we so much as used the toaster the fire alarm went off.  No burning of the toast, just toast.  Harriet came charging into our room, no knocking and even though we told her it was just the toaster she kept banging the door against a small table trying to barge her way in.  We left the unit very clean and I even cleaned the basement window with the used washcloths which leaked dirt onto the window sill.  Harriet then complained about the dirty wash cloth to Airbnb to charge us $6 to replace them.  The stay at the unit was not as described.  It was very rustic in the accommodations and although there is a kitchen it cannot be used due to the very sensitive fire alarm.  We were not made to feel welcome, we had to deal with many issues regarding the unit, and in the end Harriet complained to Airbnb about dirty washcloths and want to charge us.  I would not recommend this unit at this price unless you are looking to stay under a house with spiders and no kitchen.  Harriet was a terrible host."
189156,46263547,2015-09-09,30837970,Drew,"Harriet's place was a great time and provided everything we needed. Clean, cozy and comfortable. Harriet was a good host who greeted us and gave us a quick run through and she was always responsive to our questions. The location is great for getting out to see the great nature around Seattle, downtown is a short taxi and getting around west Seattle is generally easy. Overall a great value for a nice place."
189156,47264459,2015-09-17,40162704,Laurie,"We arrived at Harriet's very late so she stopped by the following afternoon to welcome us.  Harriet is a lovely person and my husband and I enjoyed meeting her.

Her  rental was as described by Harriet.  It was a lovely place for the two of us.  There is a nice covered front patio and a deck.  Views of Puget Sound.  I enjoyed having my morning coffee and evening wine on the patio or deck.  The neighborhood was fun with lots of different diners, bakeries and shops.  The most beautiful spot was Lincoln Park, lots of trees, walking paths and beach access.  I would recommend Harriet's place to anyone who wants to hang out somewhere quiet and relax."
189156,47516589,2015-09-19,16532365,Melyssa,"Our stay in Harriet's studio was fantastic. Harriet made sure that we had everything we needed and we definitely did! The bed was very comfy, the residence looked like it had recently been updated, and the view outside was nothing short of magical. You will likely need to rent a car if you stay here, but her home wasn't far from the city center (about 15 minutes), which I greatly preferred, as we got to see the lush greenery just outside of town. We'll definitely stay here again the next time we're in Seattle! :)"
189156,48885110,2015-09-29,39962384,Emma,"Harriet was very welcoming and quick to respond to all questions I had prior to check-in. She popped down to say hello and welcome us and then we were left to enjoy our time. 

The apartment was exactly as described/shown in the photos, very clean and comfortable for a studio.  Two people fit perfect and it would also be a great place for one. 

The neighborhood is very quiet and peaceful. The wooden deck area has amazing views with a small table and chairs. If you are planning to sit outside, I would suggest moving the chairs closer to the studio when you are not using them to prevent birds from pooping on them.

There is parking for one average sized car and a storage room for bags/cases etc which is nice when you are in a studio and need  the room. 
The bathroom is big with a shower, toilet and sink, there is a heat lamp and extractor fan. The kitchen has a small table and chairs and a large refrigerator, small stove top and plenty of appliances to cook. 
The studio has large windows which provide plenty of light and good blinds for privacy, not that you need it as no-one is passing by.

I would definitely recommend the apartment to anymore wishing to stay in Seattle who is looking for a clean, comfortable, quaint countryside environment with a breath-taking view! 
Harriet was an amazing host!
Thank you!"
189156,49401015,2015-10-03,40543069,Kathi,"Harriet couldn't have been a more gracious and wonderful host. :-)
Everything as described was spot on; her place was tranquil, spotless and charming. Bed was super comfy, coffee and real cream provided too. Wish we could have stayed longer. Harriet even provided us with back packs so we could explore Lincoln Park.   (I highly recommend). I could not believe how quiet it is there. Awesome view of Puget Sound. It was truly a little slice of heaven. Thank you Harriet. "
189156,50379663,2015-10-11,45600524,Angela,"Amazing home in a great locatin with a fabulous view.  Harriet's apartment is lovely.  It was clean and tastefully decorated.  A real home away from home.  Harriet is a fantastic host.  She welcomed us as we drove up and gave us a tour.  If you're looking for a private retreat in location close to restaurants, transportation, and coffee shops, this is it.  You won't be disappointed!"
189156,51497054,2015-10-20,11803109,Patrick,Great spot in West Seattle. Clean and roomy.  Need had a comfortable memory foam mattress. Harriet is very friendly and helpful. I would recommend this place. 
189156,52282194,2015-10-27,22281579,Gina,Lovely room! Everything is convenient. The bed is super comfortable!
189156,52685132,2015-11-01,341248,Laura,"Yes, this is a sweet studio. The location was perfect for me; close to my son's house and close to Lincoln Park. Great views of the water, and a very comfortable bed. I hope to return. Thank you, Harriet!"
189156,55931753,2015-12-07,6501231,Lois,I did not meet Harriet but spoke briefly with her on the phone. Her studio was in the ideal licTion for an event I was attending. It was nicely equipped and comfortable. I spent little time there but enjoyed the time I did spend there. Would recommend.
189156,57753738,2015-12-29,9269338,Holly,"This was our second stay at Harriet's Studio and she was there to greet us and make us feel welcome.  The beautiful location is ideal for us when we visit our daughter who lives just minutes away in West Seattle.

The apartment is welcoming and light with large windows letting in nice natural light.

We enjoyed our second stay as much as the first, and will hope to return again."
3245876,15013200,2014-06-30,17224270,Stephanie,"My stay at Libby's apartment was great! She was a very friendly, warm, and accommodating host. She was consciencious and provided all of the things that we needed and more (i.e., towels, coffee, fresh local cherries, snacks). The room was just what we needed: roomy, private (it's down the hallway from the main part of her apartment), and had an attached quarter-bathroom which was great for getting ready for the day with more privacy. The location was great as well, we could walk to the Space Needle (where we could catch the monorail to the light rail), to the Rapid Ride bus station, and were easily able to get Lyft rides near the apartment as well. Overall, it was great, Libby went out of her way to help us find her place, make sure we were comfortable, and to offer helpful information and options for things to do in the area. If you're looking for an easy and welcoming airbnb, Libby would be your best bet! PS: The room is fun and quirky :) (i.e., fun artwork, etc!).  "
3245876,17641827,2014-08-15,18994984,Jade,"Libby was an amazing host; she provided everything for us including maps, snacks, and water. The location was beautiful and in close walking to distance to restaurants, attractions, and downtown. "
3245876,17954711,2014-08-19,7634248,Mariam,My husband and I stayed at Libby's apartment for a weekend in Seattle and had a great time! Awesome location in a park! Libby even offered great recommendations and directions for her favorite restaurants.  
3245876,18566035,2014-08-28,19014614,Christian,"This was my first airbnb experience, loved the room and the area. The host did a great job of making me feel welcome and had some beverages and snacks set up for my to enjoy. Overall I would definitely suggest her to anyone looking for a convient and nice place to stay while in Seattle."
3245876,18992414,2014-09-04,10195401,Phoebe,"I'm not sure they'll let me use as many words as I need to describe how awesome Libby is and how great her place was but I'll try! First of all the guest bed was one of the most comfortable beds I've ever slept on! Having my own room, sink, and kitchenette made it all even better! Libby was such a gracious and attentive host - not to mention just an all around cool person. The mini fridge in the room was stocked with a wide variety of beverages (including an adorable pitcher of cucumber water) and she even left oatmeal, fruit, breakfast bars, and coffee for the morning (some of the best coffee in Seattle!). The washer and dryer for the apartment is right outside of her front door which was a godsend after staying for a week with a tiny suitcase. The balcony off of her apartment was cozy and had kickass views of the water. And speaking of water the water pressure in the shower was amaaaazzinng. Yes, there are some very cute and friendly cats around but knowing that going in helped me prepare (I have allergies but love kitties! If you have allergies too just be aware that youre booking a place that has cats). Also they will completely stay out of the guest room if you keep your door closed. Libby goes far and beyond to clean up after them too. I was hesitant to book this since sometimes things can be difficult with a shared space but with the way the apartment is set up, how busy Libby is, and how aware she is of what her guests might need to be comfortable I never ever felt like I didn't have my own space or privacy. When I did need advice on what to do and where to go she had a lot of great recommendations and advice that I was very thankful for later. Also on a different note if you look at the location on a map it can seem confusing since its in the park but its not as confusing as it looks! The apartment is a quick walk to Seattle Center and a very fun monorail ride away from downtown. The buses around Seattle Center seem to be able to take you almost anywhere else in Seattle you want to go. (I made it there from Capitol Hill in 15 mins!) Also if you book with Libby make sure you hang out at the Streamline Tavern and grab a bite at Tup Tim Thai - another quick walk away (5 mins). I hope I covered everything! Seattle would not have been the same for me if I hadnt booked this place!"
3245876,19061751,2014-09-05,4419972,Damon,"Libby is highly recommended as a host, she has gone to great effort to make your room very comfortable and private. She even left snacks, drinks and a beer in the fridge! We really appreciated the information pack for the city and though we didn't spend any time with her she was very easy to communicate with and always got back to us promptly. The location is great, a 10 minute walk to the Space needle and monorail. We also loved Denzel the cat though Tori Spelling is a diva and was too important to hang out with us ;-) !"
3245876,19389611,2014-09-11,6528323,Natalie,"Libby was a very accommodating host- she stayed up late waiting for me to check-in because of a delayed flight and graciously let me store my bag for longer than I thought I would need to on the day of check-out.  I also really appreciate that she provided very complete directions on how everything works and what thing are/aren't important to her. It's great to have all those thing spelled out with clarity from the beginning. She's also really prompt when responding to texts and airbnb messages. 

The apartment is in a great location, with easy bus access to downtown (it's also walking distance if you're into exploring on foot, as I am). I had everything I needed while on Seattle and would happily stay at Libby's place next time I'm in town. "
3245876,19555956,2014-09-14,16262964,Jeremy,"This was my first Airbnb experience and it was great. 

I stayed here while searching for an apartment in Queen Anne. It was the perfect spot and room. Location is terrific. It is just on the edge of lower Queen Anne and a few minutes walk from great bars, restaurants and coffee shops. It is easy to get to from the airport via the light rail and bus. No need to get a car. 

Libby is a great and considerate host. There is a mini fridge in the room stock with liquid refreshments. A small kitchenette with glasses and mugs, dishes, a sink and a tiny toaster oven and coffee maker that I did not get to try.

The room has a ton of storage, decorated with fun art and posters and very comfortable. Privacy? Yes!

The view is amazing, see the cover image for the listing.

She has two cats that are very friendly and lovable. I made quick friends with Denzel and he kept me company on my last night. 

If I weren't moving here I would stay here again whenever I was visiting Seattle."
3245876,19844627,2014-09-19,11220168,Christina,"Libby was an awesome host.  She was always quick to respond, super friendly, and flexible about checking in and out.

The room is really cute, spacious, and private.  The bed is comfy and the vanity and sink area in the room was perfect for getting ready in the mornings.  Libby provided all kinds of treats in the little fridge which was really sweet.  You can't beat the location-the park is nice (as is the neighborhood) and I really like walking so I did a lot of Seattle sightseeing on foot from her place.

Bonus: the cats are really cute and Denzel likes to hang out.  Even though I'm allergic, I felt totally fine during my stay. 

I would definitely stay here again in the future. Thanks again, Libby!!"
3245876,19989210,2014-09-21,9224118,Liv,"Libby is a fantastic host! Extremely welcoming and took time to explain the house, surrounding area and some of her favourite parts of Seattle. Despite only staying for 2 nights, I was made to feel at home, especially given the presence of her two gorgeous cats.

The room is very spacious, well laid out and comes with a separate sink, fridge (stocked with local beer!) & food preparation area, so it is easy to keep your privacy, if needed. The balcony view is to die for....and will probably want to make you move to Seattle :)"
3245876,20211444,2014-09-25,15829369,Azi,the listing description was accurate. 
3245876,20452428,2014-09-29,21138470,Phil,"Wonderful location, cozy room and a warm and engaging Libby who works to make you welcome. I had a very nice stay, the kind i hope for from Abnb."
3245876,20980037,2014-10-08,2773399,Jay,Libby was an excellent host and her room was super comfortable and  close to many great bars restaurants in Lower Queen Anne . Highly recommend a stay here.
3245876,21182439,2014-10-12,21428711,Annette,"Libby was kind and willing to let me check in at the wee hours of the night. She provided a private nice space with mini refrig, snacks, coffee, sink, with a shared bathroom with her. The locale is quiet and right on the a park. "
3245876,21453661,2014-10-17,22550221,Shelagh,"Libby was the perfect host - she was so welcoming and helpful (especially patient when I couldn't find her place at first!) and went out of her way to recommend places to go. The flat is lovely, with an amazing balcony and view - and the cats were just lovely too! Thank you, was lovely to meet you!"
3245876,21730066,2014-10-22,12393648,Brian,"Libby made the process of checking in to her place very easy. She has a wonderful apartment that is only a couple of minutes walk from a bus stop that will get you into downtown Seattle in 15 minutes. For someone who is looking for a quiet, private room, Libby's guest room is ideal as it's separated from the rest of her apartment into its own area with a small kitchen and refrigerator. Queen Anne is a fun neighborhood to explore with lots of good restaurants and bars within walking distance of Libby's place. I certainly recommend staying with her."
3245876,22407958,2014-11-05,21760229,Nikita,"Large quite room with all necessary staff. Downtown is 30 min walking. Space Needle 15 min. Shops and restaurants are located in the neighborhood.
Libby was very helpful and kind to me."
3245876,23045846,2014-11-21,23181256,Rusty & Julie,"We were greeted at the street and treated to a nicely decorated room in a unique part of Seattle for a full eight nights.  A refrigerator was stocked with fresh cucumber water upon arrival, and tea, coffee and snacks were provided.  Shower water had ample pressure and temperature.  The bed was amazingly comfortable.  Of the two cats that populated the household, we only interacted with the more gregarious and vocal one, Denzel.  I think he had a crush on us!"
3245876,23305654,2014-11-28,23753277,Jorge,"Todo perfecto. Precio razonable y buena ubicación, relativamente cerca de la aguja y el centro. El barrio es muy elegante y tranquilo. Además, hay restaurantes y bares de buen nivel muy cerca.
Libby fue muy informativa, especialmente sobre cómo llegar a su departamento. El cuarto tiene todo lo que necesitas y está muy bien decorado. Se respeta la privacidad y nadie te molestará. Aunque el baño es compartido con Libby, nunca me vi en la necesidad de esperar que se desocupe, asi que no es un problema. La ducha funciona a la perfección.
 También disfruté mucho de sus gatos, que son muy cariñosos y amigables."
3245876,23921229,2014-12-14,20022601,Dalton,Libby met me almost exactly at the appointed time to lead me through the park to her apartment. The room was perfect for my needs since I was mostly in town to hang out with friends in the Belltown area. Libby was unfortunately right in the middle of finals so our schedules did not line up for the most part but we still had a couple of great conversations. One of the cats was definitely claiming ownership of the bed in the guest room and was almost always laying on it when I'd come back in so fair warning to those bothered by cats. I tended to enjoy the company. Thank you Libby for being a great host.
3245876,24343765,2014-12-26,905781,Joshua,"Libby was an exceptional host. I've booked many Airbnb rentals, and have never had such a delightful experience. When we arrived, she met us on the street (the entrance to her apartment can be tricky to find the first time) and gave us a thorough tour of the place. The guest room was very private and comfortable, and the view from the living room was spectacular. We ended up having Xmas Eve dinner with her and her boyfriend, as well as drinks at the local bar. Both were a delightful experience. She also made us latkes and fresh coffee the next morning! (I'm not pointing this out so that you'll except meals and whatnot, just to illustrate that Libby is a very generous and friendly host!) All in all, we had a wonderful trip, and would highly recommend Libby's place (both for location and hospitality)."
3245876,24733606,2015-01-02,19794754,Bonnie,"Libby was a wonderful host.  She accommodated all our needs and was very helpful and patient when we had difficulty finding the place which ended up being what make it so fun and unique.  The bed is comfortable and the view amazing. And the cats are friendly.  We highly recommend staying with Libby.
"
3245876,25248560,2015-01-10,17972480,Peter,Fantastic experience from start to finish.  Cute side room with semi private entrance.  Libby gave a great intro to the city including a salutation to her two cute cats.  Great location in Queen Anne with easy bus access to downtown and ballard areas.  Awesome!
3245876,25675471,2015-01-22,5727118,Benjamin,I arrived pretty late and at an awkward time for Libby however she was extremely helpful and had her boyfriend come and help me out which was going really out of the way and extremely helpful! The place is really awesome and has amazing views! Loved stayed there!
3245876,26664410,2015-02-16,5390072,Zoe,"Libby is a responsible person and her sweet room and herself really impressed me for my fantastic Seattle trip. I came there kind of late schedule and Libby is so patient. I would recommend to everyone this quiet, clean and romantic room. : ) Thank you Libby. "
3245876,26794727,2015-02-19,26406878,Yuka,"She was helpful even when I arrived at the meeting place 30 min later than we scheduled and even though she was busy. 
I wish there were a TV in the room, because as a guest we are only allowed to stay in our room or use bathroom which with the cad litter box which I found very unsanitary and nasty and there was no entertainment.
The little sink that was there with the room was not tat clean, there was a spiderweb hanging from the ceiling, all the snacks/drinks by or in the fridge seemed OLD, it was nasty.
Location wise its not as bad, but I wouldn't stay there again, she puts up the pictures like its for us to enjoy but I could not enjoy it at all."
3245876,27749224,2015-03-10,28636440,Una,"The apartment 

The apartment is absolutely lovely. Clean, neat, artsy, quite, safe. In a park but not too far away from anything. 10-15 mins walk to seattle center and 30 mins walk to downtown. Within 15 mins walk, there's plenty of restaurants, bars, and markets. There is bus stations close-by too.  I was surprised of how good her place is for the price that she offered. It is def a ggood deal! 

Ps.libby has two cats~ They are really nice! Just love me too much.. Lol 

About the host 

Libby is absolutely one of the best hosts I have ever met. Nice, warm, legit, super helpful and give you enough privacy/respect. I hang out with her and her bf for Sunday brunch. She drove around the neighborhood and showed me the farmer's market! Also, she drove me to the bus station after the brunch! She has a really good taste, which you will totally agree with me once you see her apartment!
 
I had a really good time in seattle. I will def choose Libby again if I ever going back to Seattle~! 

Una"
3245876,28148951,2015-03-18,28883377,Ken,Libby was a great host;  the room was very clean and inviting. Having the sink in the room was a plus.  
3245876,28502057,2015-03-24,29516264,Austin,"Simple and nice, a very good experience. A short walk from the Space Needle and Key Arena and many local restaurants; good thing also was the 24 hour grocery store; great for food in a pinch when restaurants are closed. Decent neighborhood, pretty safe overall. Room was just right and fairly priced, clean, tastefully furnished, and accommodating - lots of pillows! (The water pressure on the shower is great too btw) The location is pretty cool, close to a nice park; the place is tucked away from the road, meaning the room was private and quiet, not a lot of loud noises, etc. Libby was congenial and friendly, great with quick communication and easy to speak with. The cats were great, very friendly and welcoming, but also reserved and gave you your space and didn't intrude. 

Before choosing Libby's place I glanced through some reviews. I did notice the one that was not happy, but I considered it to be an outlier. After staying at Libby's place, it is definitely an outlier. It's AirBnb, the opportunity to stay in someone's house that is nice, but not run by a hotel staff; fancy entertainment, room service, pool, work out room, continental breakfast, etc, are all things that make a hotel more expensive, which, I think, is the point of AirBnb, to avoid those costs, but still get a nice place. If you're very picky, then you'll likely be staying in a hotel or a very expensive AirBnb.

Libby's place is exactly what you're looking for if you want something reasonably priced for a nice stay in a simply quiet and convenient location. On my list for a go to Seattle AirBnb location."
3245876,28627000,2015-03-27,18639052,Lindsay,"I didn't meet Libby in person but she was great at communicating and making sure my arrival was easy!  Her boyfriend was there to meet me and helped me find the place and feel comfortable.  The location was fantastic - not only was it very private and safe feeling, it had an amazing view, was very close to downtown, right next to a park, and in a great neighborhood within walking distance to some nice restaurants.  The room was very comfortable and overall, I really enjoyed my stay there! I would definitely stay there again in the future. "
3245876,29931184,2015-04-14,11791867,Michael & Angela,"We had a wonderful stay at Libby’s. This was our first time staying in a private bedroom/shared space and we found it to be comfortable with the right amount of privacy. Everything was as advertised from the layout and décor down to the amenities and yummy treats (yes, the coffee truly is Four Seasons quality!). We loved the location. The park neighborhood had gorgeous views and many neighborhood shops and eats; Libby gave us some great recommendations. It was a quiet retreat from downtown Seattle and Seattle Center, which were super easy to get to by foot/bus/Uber. Libby was very easy to communicate with and we loved getting to know her and her cats."
3245876,30246873,2015-04-19,30080091,Jude,"Libby was a great host and pointed me to all the great spots in the neighborhood. She also helped me get started with the ORCA system which was very helpful. 
The room was true to the photos posted online. It's in a very beautiful quiet neighborhood while being a 10 minute bus ride from downtown. 
Libby had provided some snacks and drinks in the room which I was grateful for.  Her cats were great too and I'm not even a cat person. 
A+++ would stay again. "
3245876,30814380,2015-04-27,5406659,Kimberly,"Libby's place was a great home for my weekend exploring Queen Anne. We were both out of the house a lot so did not have much interaction after the initial greeting, but Libby was very welcoming and had many suggestions for neighborhood favorites. It's a short walk to Seattle Center as well as top of the hill bars and restaurants. Her two cats are very sweet and super cuddly, if you're in the mood for that, otherwise just shut the door. Their litter box is in the shared bathroom, but it was kept pretty clean while I was there. The bedroom and vanity area are very comfortable and well stocked. There is no tv but fast wireless for streaming as well as a nice little selection of books in your room. I had a great stay!"
3245876,31279294,2015-05-03,15622430,Denise,Libby was a great host & super friendly! She's made a great private space to rest in an Excellent part of townn not to mention the furry friends! 
3245876,32203701,2015-05-15,32524707,Daniela Tathiana,"My staying at Libby's beautiful place was perfect! It was my first week in Seattle, and it was really nice and important for me to be in contact with a good person as Libby, who give me directions and shared nice conversations. And with Denzel and Tori, her cute and friendly cats!
The bedroom and everything was exactly as described, and the neighborhood is very great, close to Seattle Center and served by several bus lines.
I definitely recommend Libby's place: being there was a wonderful experience.
"
3245876,33120557,2015-05-25,4620471,Lisa,"Libby was a great host. She met us at the entrance to the park near her place to show us the path to her place. 
The room was clean and well equipped with a comfy bed, a small table and 2 chairs, plenty of closet place, a small fridge and microwave, a coffee maker/toaster oven and some ground coffee as well as a sink.
Some nice snacks, too!
The shared bathroom, though it gave me flashbacks to grad school days, was fine. Clean, easy access. The cat box in the bathroom was cleared regularly, though people who are not comfortable with cats probably don't want to stay here.
Libby has a folder with maps and info about the neighborhood, which someone who is not familiar with Seattle would find helpful, I imagine.
It was a little bit of a walk to Seattle Center, though that is our mistake for not checking the location carefully before we booked. "
3245876,34334834,2015-06-07,21488786,Daniel,Libby did a great job welcoming me to her home. She gave a tour of where I was to stay at and did a little overview of the rules of the house. I wasn't there much during my stay  but I enjoyed the space and privacy of the room. Its location is quite nearby to the Seattle Center and downtown.  Its a great place to stay at and my favorite part of it was that you get to walk out into a park in the mornings. 
3245876,34717265,2015-06-11,18623704,Michael,"A well appointed room in a nice part of Seattle. Welcoming and no-hassle host (and cats). Thanks, Libby!"
3245876,34943594,2015-06-14,20125500,Dianna,"Libby was an awesome host with a ton of great recommendations. She took the time to show me around the neighborhood on my first day in Seattle, and even got lunch and drinks with me at some cute spots in Queen Anne. The room was exactly as described in the posting, and conveniently located just a short walk away from Seattle Center. I'd highly recommend Libby's place to anyone looking for a quieter location (it's located in the park - how cool is that?) with easy access to some of Seattle's best attractions."
3245876,35404297,2015-06-18,34235726,Juan Manuel,It was a near perfect experience. Libby is the most friendly person in Seattle. The neighborhood is really nice and quiet and the apartment has an extraordinary view. A very clean and tidy place. I highly recommend this place. 
3245876,35525304,2015-06-19,35898145,Brian,The room was very comfortable and private. I wanted for naught. Libby had prepared the room very nicely. 
3245876,35833953,2015-06-22,2192172,Roger,"From the get go, Libby was very helpful, from ensuring I understood the living situation (e.g. presence of her cat and a shared bathroom), to offering to meet me at the park entrance to find her place, to checkout (where to put the key and additional $25 for my girlfriend's stay the last night).  

While there is no private bathroom, having a mini kitchenette was certainly helpful.  You can jump out of the shower and finish getting ready in your private unit.  A minor ""upgrade"" would be a radio/alarm in the room.  Importantly, is a comfortable double bed.

Location is in a beautiful park and within walking distance of a great breakfast/brunch place, Toulouse.   "
3245876,35987520,2015-06-23,26732719,Kevin,Libby was an excellent host! She is very friendly and gave us great recommendations for places to eat. Our flight was late and she was very flexible with accommodating that. Everything was clean and tidy. 
3245876,36511400,2015-06-29,16641976,Christa,"Libby was very nice and welcoming.  The apartment is inside Kinnear park, sort of hidden in the trees.  It's got a gorgeous view of the water, and it's a very quiet and peaceful environment. It's walking distance from a bunch of restaurants and shops in Lower Queen Anne... The listing is pretty accurate.  There are two friendly cats, so if you are allergic, that may be something to consider.  There is no a/c, which is pretty typical for Seattle.  We happened to come during a bizarre heat wave, but our room stayed fairly cool for most of the day.  Only took off one star because the furnishings were pretty cheap quality... Ex: every time I tried to open the curtains, the rod fell down.  The pillows/mattress/towels were pretty clearly low-end Target or Ikea purchases.  Not the most comfy, no frills, but they got the job done.  Overall a good place to stay--Libby was awesome, and you really can't beat the location. :)"
3245876,36927804,2015-07-02,36980217,Taylor,"In a quiet area of Seattle, the room is spacious and stayed cool in this heatwave. It's within walking distance of great restaurants and even popular attractions as in the Space Needle. "
3245876,37588242,2015-07-08,35666177,Michelle,"Libby was an amazing host. The room was really spacious, and it was nice to have our own sink, microwave and mini-fridge. 
Plus, her two adorable cats were very friendly. 
The neighborhood was safe and quiet. It was in a very convenient location - I walked to most places around the city and there were a couple of buses a couple blocks away. "
3245876,37823050,2015-07-10,3797460,Dirk,Everything was perfect. I changed plans so I was in urgent need for a two night stay at Seattle. Libby is a lovely host and with a very nice apartment and prepared everything! I definitely recommend to stay there!
3245876,37936731,2015-07-11,2921411,Nick,"Libby was amazing!  Her place was perfectly located right by the science center, within walking distance of some very fun places.  She recommended great places for us to go and even went to the bar with us that night.  She's smart, generous, and fun to talk to, despite being weeks away from taking the Bar Exam.

The apartment was just as described and very comfortable.  Everything was clean and cozy.  I would definitely stay here again.

I'm giving this 5 stars, because the apartment was comfortable, the location was great, and the host was awesome."
3245876,38188582,2015-07-13,11393701,Iman,Libby was an excellent host.  Her home so inviting and she makes it easy for any guest who is visiting Seattle for the first time to find there bearings and suggest great places nearby!
3245876,38417223,2015-07-15,594134,Natalie,"Libby was a fantastic host! She is very friendly, helpful and accommodating. She even went out of her way to make adjustments for a minor incident that wasn't even her fault, which was greatly appreciated. Her cats Tori Spelling and Denzel are also pretty awesome. The view and the location of her apartment were perfect - I would definitely stay here again anytime!"
3245876,38573118,2015-07-16,38455048,Misha,"Libby is AWESOME!! First off it was my first time using airbnb and it was great I had a nice room that was set off to the other side of the house, very clean, and Libby was super welcoming. View was amazing as well. Cute neighborhood up on the mountain and was also clean and I felt safe. She recommended some places to to eat and drink and also to run since I am a huge runner. If your going to Seattle enjoy a stay at Libbys place :)"
3245876,38779202,2015-07-18,37946140,Qian,"Staying in Libby's house is my very first airbnb experience, which I would say it's the awesome one. I really like the room she prepared for guests, bed is so comfortable, everywhere is so clean and cozy, informations are all prepared. I finished all the offered coffee, it's so good that you gotta definitely try that! The cats are so adorable and I don't think Tori is a shy girl cause she almost stayed the whole night with me and we had some pretty good interactions. This is the 2nd time I visited Seattle, and I will definitely stay here again when the next visiting in the future."
3245876,40600910,2015-08-01,29954968,Harriet,"I really enjoyed my two week stay with Libby.  The room was lovely and clean and the little room with a sink in the corner of the room was ideal.  There is also a fridge (stocked by Libby) and a microwave which makes the room perfect for any length of stay.  Libby did so much to make me feel welcome, including inviting me out for dinner and drinks on my first night, and was always cleaning the bathroom to make sure it stayed clean.  She was also great at being in contact, even though I stayed during the time when she sat the bar exam.  She was a great host.  The location of the apartment is ideal and within walking distance of the space needle.  Thanks Libby!"
3245876,40833074,2015-08-02,39282628,Daniel,Libby was very personable and a very gracious host. Going to local nightlife spots and around the town was fun and enjoyable. Fantastic experience. Thanks again!
3245876,40976649,2015-08-03,38463028,Emily,Libby was awesome some events occurred on way to getting to her house and she was so kind to come and pick us up! When we got to her apartment it was exactly as we thought and she had an incredible view of the water! The neighborhood was easy to get around and close to the main attractions outside of downtown also had easy access to downtown.
3245876,41730570,2015-08-09,30106857,Daniel,"Libby is a kind and gracious host. She provides a clean, well-kept, and keenly furnished home, and is very smart when it comes to Seattle and getting around the area - speaking broadly, she is very helpful and accommodating for those who are new to the area. If guidance isn't something that you need, she is also very kind to provide guests with ample privacy.

If you are to stay in Queen Anne, look no further. Libby's property is tucked away in a quiet corner of Kinnear Park which is certainly calm but is no great distance from anything that you may want to do in Seattle. Your time spent there, like mine, will have the balance everyone hopes for when travelling."
3245876,42431404,2015-08-13,38510663,Mike,"I really had the good time in Libby's place! The room was huge, clean, great location and cute cats. They were coming to the bed to sleep and it is so comfortable.
Waking to Space Needle so easy. I took the picture everyday.
She created the handmade guide book and it was very helpful!"
3245876,43059263,2015-08-17,18105668,Christa,Libby was a fantastic host! The room had everything I needed & the place is located in a great area. The private sink/small kitchen area was a definite plus!
3245876,43322634,2015-08-18,41152957,Greg,Libby was awesome. She was friendly and bent over backwards for me. When there was a slight problem with parking she parked her car out on the street and let me take her place. Very pleasant and engaging. A joy to be around. The room was clean and just what I expected. Loved it. I will return over and over again. 
3245876,44325167,2015-08-25,7436419,Aaron,Great location on park.  I loved the Betty Bowen lookout park.  Queen Anne is one of my favorite neighborhoods in the country.
3245876,45284218,2015-09-01,39759510,Elyse,"Libby was an amazing host!  I had a busy trip, but her home was a wonderful place to come back to at the end of the day.  She was warm, welcoming, and accommodating.  And her cats are adorable!!  Next time I'm in Seattle, I'm definitely going to stay here!"
3245876,45646695,2015-09-04,27408260,Sanjay,"Libby's apartment was great. She has set up the space very well and made it welcoming, including some snacks and coffee as well as local recommendations for activities. The apartment was in a great location, with Seattle City Center within walking distance. The bedroom was clean and comfortable and I appreciated the artwork as well, made it very personable."
3245876,46385071,2015-09-10,29195993,Whitney,"Staying at Libby's was great! Loved the warm eclectic aesthetic, the location, the view and her two adorable kitties :) Libby was awesome! Very helpful and responsive to any questions I had. I would stay here again. "
3245876,46920424,2015-09-14,41099781,Dorothy,"A charming location for our first Air BNB experience. Libby was really sweet and accommodating, even though we had an evening flight and arrived at her place kind of late. Location is handy for local shops, bus routes and restaurants and we were able to sight see just fine without renting a car.  We would definitely highly recommend this place to others. "
3245876,47236026,2015-09-16,44212134,Andrew,Libby was a wonderful host!  She was incredibly accommodating and made my stay work on very short notice.  Thanks!
3245876,47538522,2015-09-20,8442084,C,"From beginning to end, Libby was a fantastic host. She lives by a lovely park (bring your tennis racquets if you have them!) and came out to greet me upon arrival. She is clearly very experienced with hosting, having provided a manual to her place and the city, and providing a bunch of amenities such as snacks and dishes in the room. The room itself is nice and private, separated from the rest of the apartment. She has an amazing view of Puget Sound. It was easy to walk to the bus stop from her place, and it was a short walk to the trails by the sound and Kerry Park, which provides an amazing view of the Space Needle and downtown w/ Mt. Rainier in the back. Thankfully we didn't have to use the umbrella she provided! But basically Libby thought of everything in making this a comfortable experience."
3245876,48135535,2015-09-23,29520502,Amy,Libby is a fabulous host along with her cute cats.  The location is ideal.  All the extra details in the room made me feel at home.  I would definitely stay with her again!!
3245876,48587328,2015-09-27,43634929,Debbie,"I stayed with Libby in Lower Queen Anne which happened to be a fabulous location.  Within an easy/quick 15 min walk to Seattle Center (where space needle and numerous other points of interest are located).
The neighborhood was upscale and I felt safe walking around by myself at dark.
Libby is an awesome host!!!  she made me feel welcome immediately before i even got there, by texting prior to my arrival.  the room accommodations were perfect.  the bed was cozy - you had your own mini frig/microwave and goodie basket.
Libby's suggestions on great places to eat and coffee shops etc were spot on.  she was very helpful in showing me apps available  for the public transit system and uber.
all in all it was a fantastic trip and i will definitely be back to Seattle - too much to see in 5 days and I will stay will Libby again.
did i mention her apartment has harbor views ???? Lovely !!!
Debbie - Cleveland"
3245876,49645254,2015-10-05,29638832,Brandon,"Libby's place was great for my mother and I. We came in for a few days due to work interviews for myself. If you're looking for a place that's very close to the city, walking distance of the Space Needle and Pike place this is it! The post was spot on, great place to stay. We loved her cats. And if I come back to Seattle I will be staying here again."
3245876,49852634,2015-10-06,6972472,Paul,"What a great place to stay! Libby has a funky awesome pad, which made for a perfect spot to base my stay in Lower Queen Anne. Easy walking distance to local eateries, bars, etc. Libby did an excellent job coordinating with me, as I was running late checking in. She made it seamless, and it was fun to meet up with her for a drink to get acquainted. Her place is quiet and comfortable, and offers a very comfortable bed, private half bath, and mini-fridge stocked with goodies. The living room has floor to ceiling windows & the slider opens to a deck that looks out to Elliott Bay, so you can sit out & watch ferries & check out the night lights & stars."
3245876,50382955,2015-10-11,41675974,Brita,Libby was an amazing host. The room was clean and homey and packed with so many amenities. And the cats were so friendly and sweet. I would 100% stay here again and recommend to friends. 
3245876,50679701,2015-10-13,42073316,Shannon,Libby was a wonderful host. She did everything and then some to make the space cozy and convenient. The space was clean and well stocked with snacks and COFFEE! I would stay with Libby again in a heartbeat. The location was great and the view from her balcony was beautiful. Thanks Libby for helping me fall in love with Seattle!
3245876,50997969,2015-10-16,46473591,Juan,"Libby is a great person. I really felt like home in her house: her cats were adorable and the room was clean, roomy and private. Her place is close to everything and you can reach any tourist attractions just for $5-10 using uber."
3245876,51396449,2015-10-19,14746194,Jenny,"I was only in Seattle for a long weekend but found that Libby's place was in a great location to see the city. It's a few blocks away from Kerry Park which has a beautiful view of Seattle. She was very informative upon arrival of the house rules. Her cats are friendly, one of which will try to sneak into your room so just close the door if you don't want him around. The shower and toilet aren't connected to the room, but is right outside in the hallways and didn't have any issues! Would recommend Libby to host your stay in Seattle!"
3245876,51980840,2015-10-25,1805401,Tracy,"Libby has the sweetest little spot right off a park lane with a gorgeous view. My private room was clean and comfortable. Libby is a welcoming and generous host who leaves little goodies for her guests, even an umbrella for rainy days!We took her up on a couple of restaurant recommendations which proved to be great. I wasn't around much during my visit but had I been, I'm sure Libby would have made me feel even more at home than she already had. I will be sure to pass the word to other friends wanting to visit Seattle."
3245876,52298952,2015-10-27,1333318,Harry,"LIbby was a warm and charming host and provided lots of useful information about the Lower Queen Anne neighborhood.  Her building is located down a path inside Kinnear Park adjacent to quaint 1920s and 1930s brick apartment buildings.   The setup was simple, but  perfect, for my three day exploration of the city.  Very quiet environment and I slept better here than I have in a long while.  Would definitely stay here again."
3245876,52778613,2015-11-01,32910241,Jen,"Libby was most welcoming and helpful with finding parking when I first arrived. She even helped me find a place to lock up my bike! The room was clean and well supplied with tea and snacks, which I most appreciated. 
She made an excellent suggestion for a place to get dinner within walking distance and handily supplied a list of great other walking-distance restaurants in her guest book.
Thank you Libby for a great stay!"
3245876,53851936,2015-11-13,48280254,Jacquie,"Libby instantly made me feel welcomed when I first met her, and her cat Denzel :) She was a great host and provided some good recommendations near the apartment. She was very straightforward on the rules of her apartment, which weren't hard to follow at all. The location was a little hidden, but definitely a little hidden gem in Lower Queen Anne. It was close enough to be able to explore Seattle, but also be away from the crowds. Thoroughly enjoyed my stay here. Thanks Libby!"
3245876,54222967,2015-11-16,3240820,Ian,Libby was very thorough and accurate in her descriptions.
3245876,54650785,2015-11-22,23790063,Fabiola,"I really liked the room at Libby's place. The place is nice, about 30 min walking to Needle space. "
3245876,55750194,2015-12-05,16968633,Maxim,"This was a very nice place to stay. The room is really inviting, and the area around with the park is relaxing. And, it's not far from the Queen Anne restaurants and pubs. Libby was a great and welcoming host. The provided description is accurate. And, the profile photo of the room at airbnb is the view from her balcony!"
3245876,56638701,2015-12-15,41866379,Siyu,"My experience in Seattle was great. The house is really clean and Libby is really really nice. She gives me a lot of advice and she is very responsive and helped me out with my questions! On the last day of my stay, we chatted till midnight. I was impressed and inspired by Libby's experience and courage! I'll definitely choose to live here next time when I visit Seattle!"
3245876,57332164,2015-12-24,50931270,Caesar,"First of all, Libby was a very good host from the get go and her cats included :).  She thoroughly explained everything I needed to know the first time I got there and made me feel welcomed to her place. The description of the listing was very accurate, I was actually shock how big the room was. Overall, staying at Libby's place allowed me to enjoy Seattle even more. I would definitely stay there again next time I go to Seattle! "
3245876,58415770,2016-01-02,18772042,Gabriel,"Our stay at Libby's was great. The room had a lot of good amenities like a microwave, mini fridge and toaster. She also provided towels. It was well organized and had a lot of guides and info on Seattle. 

The view from the terrace is cool except it was too cold to actually use it, but in the summer it should be great. 

The location was ideal. Just a 20 minute walk to the space needle and 30 minutes to downtown. "
6687939,35159514,2015-06-15,4965339,Jarrett,"Listing is accurate.  This is a standard high-end 1 br apt in a tower, very compact and efficient.  Short walk to both downtown and Capitol Hill.  There's also access to a spectacular roof deck area with what look like event facilities.  "
6687939,35847824,2015-06-22,35075019,Jennifer,We had a great experience!  Loved the space and the view. I was surprised that we never heard any neighbors. 
6687939,35992849,2015-06-23,2262075,Adam,"This host and the unit were fantastic.  The apartment was decorated very nicely and was also very comfortable.  There are beautiful views of the city and the water from both the living room and the bedroom.  The building is also very nice.  It felt like I was staying in a 5 star hotel. 

The host was very friendly and easy to deal with.  Check in and check out were pain free. 

Highly Recommended!"
6687939,36068917,2015-06-24,2974125,Jennifer,"Michelle was very communicative and accommodating, even meeting me late at night when my plane was delayed.  Everything was perfect. The apartment is unlike many airbnbs in that it isn't occupied so it's quite spare and clean, more like a hotel room with a kitchen.  The view from the apartment is amazing. "
6687939,36210553,2015-06-26,16226624,Nikkolas,"Michelle was such a wonderful and friendly host. She was very accommodating and did what she could to make my stay as seamless and enjoyable as possible. She quickly responded to any questions that I had as well. 

The apartment more than met my expectations. The views from the apartment, as well as the ones from the rooftop were fantastic. The furniture was really comfortable as well. My favorite part was definitely the bed. I felt like I was floating on air and was completely refreshed after a few hours of rest. The apartment was conveniently near a lot of the downtown locations, which inspired me to walk around and enjoy the sights. I definitely recommend this listing and intend to come back."
6687939,36579761,2015-06-29,35308619,Mary,We had a wonderful stay! The apartment is perfectly located and suited our needs well. We were able to walk everywhere and were close to all of the excitement of downtown Seattle living. Michelle was a great host. We hope to be guests again. Thanks airbnb and Michelle for a great first experience using airbnb!
6687939,36895605,2015-07-02,11247060,David,"I loved this place!  Tim was a great host...on time and easy to deal with.  The apartment looked just like it was described in the post and you couldn't ask for a better location in Seattle.  It looked and smelled new and was nicely decorated.  The view is amazing!  There is also a shared roof deck on the 40th floor that is SO cool...flat screen tvs, kitchen, pool table, and views that rival the Space Needle.  Everything in the apartment was very modern and the bed was extremely soft and comfortable.  I would highly recommend this apartment  "
6687939,37233969,2015-07-05,6118632,Eric,Michelle and Tim were very accommodating and flexible with the check in time. The apartment was very clean and the views are amazing. Location is close to everything and easy to get to public transit.

Not only is it beautifully designed and comfortable - but the location can't be beat - super easy walk to Nordstrom, Pike's Place market and the heart of it all! The total icing on the cake is the extreme hospitality of Michele - making accommodations when our travel was at odd hours - handy with advice, suggestions and responsible as can be! This is literally as good as AirBnB gets!!! "

6687939,40608744,2015-08-01,30672476,Heather,Michelle was there to greet us and show us around- the place was impeccably clean and felt like a designer had graced the decor.  The view was amazing and it was very well stocked with fun snacks and things u would need for your stay.  We were able to even do a load of laundry.  This apt is about a 10 minute walk to pike place and around all the well know shopping stores.  Parking is right across on a side street.  We had a short visit but would definitely stay here again if ever in Seattle!
6687939,40926050,2015-08-03,34369775,Jessie,"Michelle greeted us at the condo on time, and was extremely friendly and informative. The condo was exactly as described, and was actually bigger than we expected. The elevators were interesting, but efficient- made us feel very safe. The location was perfect- in between Pike Market and Capitol Hill. Made the ease of walking around the entire city simple and enjoyable. We had a great stay and are thankful for Michelle's great hospitality!"

6687939,45375876,2015-09-02,36129629,Howard,"Michelle was really great at following up about check in and encouraging me about knowing and accessing the amenities of the building. She left me a card when I checked in, and she had bottles of wine for us.  She was really nice to us and was a great host.  The apartment and building were amazing, really clean and neat when we arrived, with extra linens.  The bed was luxuriously comfortable, and the view was great.  Overall, I couldn't have asked for a better stay and experience.  "

Michelle had added a lot of little personal touches which made us feel more at home. Michelle was very responsive throughout the process. Overall we can't say more great things and highly recommend this place. 
6687939,46306558,2015-09-09,41187228,Terry,"Host meet us as agreed w/ no issues.  The condo was all it was suppose to be; great location, very clean and comfortable with views of Seattle.  We loved the bed and living area.  Kitchen came w/ all we needed - we did not use it as the location is central to lots of wonderful restaurants. We used the gym several times; wonderful!  Best quality - the location is central to Seattle and allowed us to move around the city easily.  "
6687939,46752458,2015-09-13,22775645,Chirag,"I have to say this was quite an amazing place to stay.  Starting with booking this location, Michelle was extremely helpful and thorough with her information and instructions.  Michelle then coordinated her schedule to fit mine in order to meet me at the apartment.  She took the time to show me the apartment and the rest of the amenities of the building.  She left a welcome bottle of wine as well.  The place was immaculately clean and modern.  The view was incredible and the location was in the heart of downtown about a 1 minute walk to the convention center.  The next day and every day thereafter she would text or call to make sure that everything was to my satisfaction and if I needed anything.  She made the checkout process effortless.  There is no doubt that if/when I return to Seattle, I will not hesitate to stay at this or any location that she would host.  Michelle, thanks for everything."
6687939,47730616,2015-09-21,24056436,Carlos,"A beautiful, contemporary apartment. Michelle was incredibly helpful from the moment of booking until the last day of our stay. She allowed us a late check-out due to a late flight. The apartment is everything described in the listing. We were in town for a friend's wedding and everyone knew the building and commented how popular the place was. The living room had a lovely view of the city and the bedroom was quite comfortable. The washer and dryer came in handy at the end of the trip and the WiFi worked great. We used Uber to get around, but rented a car for a day trip to Mt. Rainier. There is no parking in the building, but several car rental places are in walking distance. The apartment's location was great. You can easily walk to restaurants, bars and shopping malls. I'd definitely recommend anyone to stay here. "
6687939,48346012,2015-09-25,35162192,Roshan,"Beautiful, clean apartment in a great location with a gorgeous view. Nice kitchen, clean bathroom with rainfall shower head and a gym/rooftop access in the building. Check in was easy and Michelle reached out halfway though my stay to make sure I was comfortable. It was perfect for my needs!"
6687939,48894156,2015-09-29,36646390,Michael,"Michelle is very easy to work with. Her communication was awesome and the property is exactly as described. The apartment is great; it has an excellent view and is in an excellent location! The furnishings are designer quality and the bed is very comfy.  Thank you, Michelle."

6687939,50551328,2015-10-12,22924278,Morten,I really enjoyed my stay in Michelle's apartment. Perfect location and modern with all amenities needed to make you feel at home. Michelle also very attentive and responded quickly. Truly a 5 star experience. 
6687939,51149562,2015-10-18,29597281,Shilpa,Michelle's apartment was great and just what we were looking for! It was neat and clean and has beautiful views of the bay!

2493658,12258743,2014-04-27,14422928,Phuong,"We enjoyed our stay at the this place. It was a nice, roomy apartment in a quiet neighborhood.  All the appliances and furnitures are new, and the floor in the bathroom is heated. It's within walking distance to some parks with an amazing view of downtown Seattle. Off street parking was a bonus. "
2493658,14361517,2014-06-17,2671471,Peter,It was all good! Beautiful unit and convenient location! We would highly recommend this one.
2493658,15747953,2014-07-15,2242330,Scott,We really enjoyed our stay on Queen Anne!  The apartment was bright and spacious as advertised and our interactions with Andrea and her manager Greg were helpful and timely. We'd stay here again. 
2493658,16021305,2014-07-20,6011102,Nikki,"This spot is a gem! The apartment is clean, well-appointed, and in a beautiful, convenient location. All the amenities you could need -- extra blankets, towels, kitchen utensils, etc. -- were thoughtfully tucked away and easy to find. 

Andrea was out of town but kept in touch with us as our reservation drew near, and Greg, her property manager, was close at hand and dropped by to check in. 

I can't recommend this listing enough and will be booking again in the future."
2493658,18020144,2014-08-20,13140897,Maya,"All of my family enjoyed Andrea's apartment a lot! The place is clean and spacy for my 2-yo to run around, and the neighborhood is safe and very nice. 

Andrea was very attentive to our needs and so welcoming. I just let her know some stuff would be nice to have and to my surprise the property manager had them delivered the very next morning.

The property manager Greg was helpful too. It was raining when we first got there and he found two loaner umbrellas for us. 

Thank you Andrea for making our stay one of the highlights in our Seattle trip, and my mom was so impressed with this experience that she wants to start finding places on airbnb and travel on her own :)"
2493658,18877397,2014-09-02,4611219,Kara,"This is a great apartment in Queen Anne! Andrea and Greg are extremely welcoming and communicative. The location was nice, there are lots of cute restaurants, bars, and shops nearby.  We stayed here as two couples and the apartment is perfectly laid out for 4. The pull out couch in the living room is really comfortable and there is a large closet in the living room as well, so it was easy to turn this room into a private bedroom (if you wished). The bathroom, kitchen, and dining room are all in between the living room & bedroom so there was a lot of privacy, even for the couple sleeping in the living room. There are even two separate entrances, one near each room. It was really ideal for sharing. Everything in the apartment is new and clean. There are lots of blankets, towels, toilet paper, dishes...everything you'd need! They even left some nice coffee for us for the morning. There is a bus near the apartment that goes into Seattle downtown making it easy to get around. I'd definitely recommend this apartment!"
2493658,19934093,2014-09-21,18880787,Richard,The neighborhood and location was amazing.  Just a short walk to the most gorgeous sunset point and the great area of upper Queen Anne in Seattle.  It is also only 10 houses from one of the top 10 bakeries in the US!  The apartment is exactly as portrayed on airbnb - it is immaculate and bright and airy!  Andrea is the kindest host who sincerely wants her renters to enjoy and have a positive experience.  She is so accessible and responsive to any and all needs.  Her property manager is also first rate.
2493658,20837468,2014-10-06,17447279,Mateusz,"I was moving to Seattle with my wife and two kids (9yo and 10mo) and was looking for a temporary apartment, and I couldn't have found better! Even not stated, the apartment was perfect for our toddler - everything was out of her range and there was no way she could hurt herself.

When we arrived the apartment was very clean and everything was ready for our coming. All the appliances were working properly and we didn't have problem with anything - we had no opportunity to check how good Greg was.

The neighborhood turned out to be very calm and quiet, so if you need a good sleep that's a place for you. Also, the beds were very comfortable and our jetlag ended very fast. Oh, and the internet was working like a charm - quite handy when you're in new city and trying to get yourself around or contact your family on the other side of the planet.

The apartment is in a wonderful, very walkable location. It's not far from Ken's Market, Macrina Bakery (you should definitely check that out), the bus stop with routes to Seattle Downtown are just behind the corner. Within 10 minutes walk range is Queen Anne Avenue, where you will find probably all you need SafeWay and Trader Joe's, lots of cafes, Bartell, restaurants etc.

When you're looking for a stay in Seattle, look no further!"
2493658,21389037,2014-10-16,13765199,Jonas,"Nice appartment in a safe neighborhood. The house has very thin walls, you can hear everyone else in the house, all the other appartments.
Andrea was very responsive, all worked well. Thank you!"
2493658,22163749,2014-10-31,22770154,Noel,"A great little apartment in a great area of Seattle.

We (2 adults and 2 young children) stayed here for a week. The apartment was ideal for us. It's situated in a quiet residential neighbourhood, but there are plenty of amenities nearby.  A bus stop, bakery, and small supermarket were just around the corner. A few blocks away was the main street of Queen Anne, which has two larger supermarkets, restaurants, quirky little shops, and more. Downtown Seattle was only 15 mins away on the bus.

The kitchen was very well equipped for a holiday property, which is handy as our youngest son is allergic to dairy and eggs. With the bedroom and the sofa bed at opposite ends of the house we could put the kids into one of the beds and have the rest of the house to ourselves in the evenings. There is access to a washer and dryer in the basement below, which was useful with two messy boys.

Andrea was very prompt in replying to our questions, and very helpful with suggestions of things to see and do in Seattle.

All up I definitely recommend staying here. The only situation I could see wanting somewhere else would be for those who like the nightlife, who might want to stay closer to Downtown."
2493658,23973777,2014-12-15,24066725,Evelyn,"The apartment was cute and cozy, and Andrea was so welcoming and informative! Would definitely stay here again "
2493658,24480307,2014-12-29,21231851,James F.,"A beautiful and wonderfully appointed""Airy and Bright"" Queen Anne apartment by every measure, down to the heated bathroom floor.  Host Andrea Ravenet's communication is timely and precise.  Entry was effortless and our stay could not have been more comfortable and relaxing.   Can't wait for next trip to Seattle, as we certainly hope to enjoy this lovely home again.  "
2493658,24777069,2015-01-02,16225635,Paul,"The apartment was fantastic, and very well located near eating places, convenience shops like Safeway etc. Andrea wasn't there, but remotely she made everything easy, from checking in, to recommending eating places to checking out. Will certainly recommend her apartment to anyone with family looking to visit Seattle!"
2493658,36649979,2015-06-30,17517798,Antonelle,"As I was planning a 6-month stay in Seattle for work, I stumbled upon this listing and knew right away that it was the place for me. If you’re looking for a tranquil space for both work and relaxation that is in a safe and picturesque neighborhood incredibly accessible to downtown, look no further than Andrea’s unit! 

While the listing description was incredibly thorough--and impressively accurate!--here are a few more details that might be handy to know:

1) The unit is directly above the washer/dryer, but the sounds from the machines cannot be heard from the bedroom (some noise can be heard from them in the dining area, but it is usually only for a few minutes).

2) The unit shares the kitchen wall with the neighboring unit--sometimes cabinet opening and closing can be heard from next door.

3) The heaters are incredible--powerful, clean, and SILENT. 

4) Washer and dryer are totally free, and the cabinets in the basement were always well-stocked with detergent and fabric softener.

5) Wifi was plenty fast for my needs and service / signal was never an issue. 

Lastly, as has been mentioned multiple times in the reviews, both Andrea and Greg (the property manager) were so welcoming, responsive, and accommodating. I was uncomfortable with having bare windows in the living room, and Andrea and Greg had the blinds sized and ordered within a day. Whenever a lightbulb went out or there was a minor issue in the unit, Greg was always available and addressed the issue within a day or two. They were both a complete pleasure to interact with, and my stay in this unit over the last 6 months was equally wonderful!"
2493658,42165057,2015-08-11,2402094,Mary,"Andrea's Queen Apartment surpassed our expectations! She provided us with much helpful information before our arrival, and we were happy to arrive and find a spotlessly clean and comfortable to spend several days while we explored Seattle. The apartment had everything we needed, and its location was great. It is an easy walk to the Queen Anne shopping street, with its restaurants, coffee shops, stores, and markets, as well as convenient to Seattle Center, Belltown, Downtown, and Lake Union.  Andrea was very accommodating to our request for a late checkout, since no one was coming in on the day we left, and that was a huge help for us. We'd definitely stay here again on a return trip!"
2493658,43017610,2015-08-17,11455751,Anneliese,"Andreas's apartment is just like it looks in the pictures or maybe even a bit nicer! Check in and Check out was very flexible for us and super easy and the location is perfect for anyone looking to discover Seattle (by bus or on foot) and live in a beautiful and quiet neighbourhood in the meantime. There were four of us, so two slept on the sleep sofa in the living room, and that also was perfectly comfortable. A plus also was the excellent wifi connection, so if anyone is looking to work while staying in Seattle, that definitely would be a plus.
Andrea was a great host who left countless Tips on where to go, what to see and where to eat for her guests as well as a detailed guide to the apartment. She also was always available for any questions we had and took great care of us - an all-round fantastic host!"
2493658,43711637,2015-08-21,8656255,Katherine,We stayed with our two young daughters for four nights. Everything was lovely: clean and tidy. We loved walking the neighborhood and visiting the nearby bakery. Thank you!
2493658,44331611,2015-08-25,16989592,Nina,"We had a wonderful stay at Andrea's place.  Andrea was professional, warm and extremely prompt with all correspondence.  The apartment is comfortable, with a very well-appointed kitchen.  An added plus for families: the bedroom is far from the living room; we could socialize without disturbing our little one.  

This was our first time in the Queen Anne neighborhood, and we loved it (quiet and pretty with an amazing bakery around the corner).   We'll definitely be returning."
2493658,45260613,2015-09-01,6016603,Debra,"This lower level apartment in a two-story quadruplex Is crisp, clean, modern, and spacious.  There were a handful of retail/restaurant concerns around the corner, including an extensively well-stocked mom and pop grocery store.  The main drag on Queen Anne with a larger variety of storefronts and restaurants is 14 flat blocks from the house.  The BNB is in a neighborhood that has a more  residential than urban atmosphere.  A beautiful, distant view of Puget Sound is a two block walk away from the house."
2493658,45841714,2015-09-06,41373344,Mike,"We loved this place, great location close enough to downtown but in a quiet really cool neighborhood.  Andrea was great with communication.  Apartment was very clean and well stocked with the necessities. "
2493658,46619934,2015-09-12,3780420,Gretchen,"Andrea and Greg were an amazing team. Although we did not meet physically, the support they provided digitally and logistically was impeccable. Our arrangements at this accommodation have been one of the best experience with Airbnb thus far. We had a great time at this listing."
2493658,47323926,2015-09-17,40195025,Beverly,"This was the coolest place I have ever stayed!!   It was close and in walking distance to everything.  It was clean and open, welcoming and airy!!  Andrea was wonderful to work with and I felt completely at home here.  We never wanted to leave.  We took walks in the neighborhood every day and found so many new and interesting things to explore.  I walked to the Space Needle, it's about 1.5 miles, but the views are spectacular!!  I would absolutely recommend staying here!!"
2493658,49165240,2015-10-01,44512444,Joseph,"We rented Andrea's lovely apartment for a new hire for our company. We had to find a location at the last minute and Andrea was very accommodating. Our new employee has had nothing but positive things to say about his experience. The thorough email of information about the neighborhood and city was extremely helpful.

We needed to add an extra night to our stay at the last minute. Thankfully Andrea had availability and was able to quickly extend our stay.

Overall, a fantastic experience from start to finish. Thanks Andrea!"
2493658,49842409,2015-10-06,45030904,BostenKody,"Andrea was prompt, communication clear. The home was clean, open space, family friendly, shampoo/conditioner/soap/laundrydetergent included, close parking, comfy bed. Close to macrina bakery, trader joes, mexican eatery, gas station.  10min away from  lake union/space needle/etc, friendly safe quiet gorgeous neighborhood. Andrea sends u links on what to do or see in seattle (very helpful advice!!!) i would stay here again."
2493658,50135444,2015-10-09,21323362,Eric,"Everything was good, instructions very clear and caretaker readily available by cell.  Coffee was in the kitchen along with a french press."

2493658,53384504,2015-11-08,13466871,Rachel,"Andrea was great and very helpful--answered all our questions. The unit  is in amazing part of Queen Anne. We walked to dinner, Trader Joes, a drugstore, a bakery...you can't beat the location. The unit is in excellent condition. It is very clean and has everything that you would need. We had a wonderful stay!

2493658,54657223,2015-11-22,44017483,Lisa,"Andrea's apartment was even better than the pictures described.  Very clean and comfortable with everything needed to make us feel at home.  It was very convenient to walk to local grocery stores and restaurants/coffee shops.  Also easy access to buses and very commutable by car.  The apartment provided laundry, a well-stocked kitchen (salad spinner was a plus), toiletries, cozy towels and blankets, (even laundry detergent and paper products which was very helpful) and it was quite spacious.  We loved it and will definitely return!"
2493658,55102497,2015-11-28,43197770,Kathleen,"Andrea provided all the information we could possibly want and was very thorough in covering information about the apartment and the neighborhood.  We loved the location since it was close to where we needed to be and convenient to good food, coffee and services.  The apartment was very comfortable and well heated (this mattered since it was very cold outside once the sun was gone - yes, we had beautiful sunny days!  Kitchen nicely equipped and it was especially great to have good coffee an a french press.  I fully expect that we will stay here again."
2493658,55379926,2015-12-01,45487489,Linda,Had a wonderful stay!  Close to shopping and located in a cute neighborhood.  Apartment was clean and well furnished. Great communication from owner before and after. Enjoyed our stay immensely.  
2493658,56969289,2015-12-20,1917621,Brian,"We had a lovely, three night stay at Andrea's apartment in charming Queen Anne.  While the weather outside was dreary, we enjoyed our stay and felt like it gave us a sense of the neighborhood.  We especially loved the Macrina bakery around the corner, which we frequented each morning.  While we never met Andrea or the building manager, she was incredibly communicative and promptly responded to all inquiries.  "
8310576,49566175,2015-10-04,45464854,Monica,This place was amazing! This was he first time we had used airbnb and Justin and Anna were so friendly and the room was perfect. We had a great time and the location is perfect for catching a game or as a home base around Seattle! Thanks so much both of you for the excellent time!
8310576,50143075,2015-10-09,18275052,Khashi,"Justin and Ana were the ideal hosts! They truly made me feel extremely welcomed and comfortable in my stay. All around just genuinely nice people that also had great recommendations on what to do and see in the city. The place itself is awesome, clean and very close to everything. The amenities were awesome and Ana is an amazing cook. All in all I truly enjoyed my stay here and would definitely recommend them and this place for anyone traveling into the Seattle area!"

8310576,50882182,2015-10-15,22579625,Barry,"Justin and his wife are a great couple and were great hosts. 
Their hospitality extended way beyond our expectations and we were made to feel very welcome. 
Their advice on where to eat and drink was spot on. Also their local knowledge was really helpful to us.
If like us you have a few days to kill in Seattle and want to spend it in a beautiful location in a great part of town then I heartily recommend a stay with these guys!"
8310576,51641510,2015-10-22,13047643,Trina,"I enjoyed the quiet, serene environment. My host made non-fail arrangements to meet my needs. There was an internal bike rake within the property that was very secure & suited my needs. Being that this location is 3 blocks from Kings Station, I recommend it to anyone traveling on Amtrak."
8310576,52348028,2015-10-28,7536138,New,"My wife and I had a fantastic experience with Justin and this listing.  Justin showed genuine concern for our comfort and satisfaction, and the apartment itself is really terrific. Highly recommend!"

8310576,54448179,2015-11-20,235774,Corey,"Beautiful flat, super nice people.  I mistakenly thought I was renting the whole apartment when it was only the private room in a shared apt.  Nonetheless, they were very kind people to share a place with with.  Had a great time in Pioneer Square."
6764646,38298465,2015-07-14,26379512,Sheila,"The home was spacious, nicely furnished with plenty of natural light and fresh air. We enjoyed cooking in the kitchen and kicking back in the living room or on the rear patio. The host was very accessible and accommodating answering questions immediately. The location was ideal as it was within walking distance of a great Co-op food market, restaurants, diverse food and drink options, parks and more. A bonus was that the street was very quiet and that both of the bedrooms had large comfortable beds. And, Dracula, the mascot kitty was lovely welcoming us home whenever we returned. "
6764646,39033583,2015-07-20,29692126,Paige,"Brian made our arrival very easy even when I didn't have the ability to check my Airbnb app to see his last message it was easy to get a hold of him. The place was clean, tidy and comfortable. Our little roomie Dracula was the sweetest and reminded me of my own cat back home and even came and slept with me one night which is great when you're missing your own pets. I could have easily stayed in Seattle longer and not having wifi and television was really refreshing. We were also super close to some really great areas so finding great food was never difficult. "
6764646,42137418,2015-08-11,35241121,Cora,"Loved the apartment, close to a lot of good restaurants. Dracula the cat was a sweet heart. I'm not an animal person and I loved her. Would recommend. "
6764646,45382511,2015-09-02,8691533,Tanya,"Lots of space, great vibe and very comfortable. Unfortunately I didn't get to meet Dracula (his cat), but maybe next time I'll be luckier! It was the perfect place for three of us to crash after long days in Seattle."
7226013,37931720,2015-07-11,2528417,Henriette,"We had a great time in Angels apartment. It was exactly as described,  comfortable and clean. Angel is a lovely person, welcomed us and gave us tips and recommendations for the area. The location was conveniently located near the E-line that takes you downtown in only 15 minutes. There's also many places to eat and discover just a walk away! I can recommend her space to anyone visiting Seattle! "
7226013,38077742,2015-07-12,12367521,Kiara,"Angel's place is located easy walking distance from lots of dining and drinking options on 45th street.

The room was as shown in the pictures and quite cozy. There is a good and fast bus connection to central Seattle just around the corner. We would recommend Angels and Evans place!
"
7226013,38785369,2015-07-18,36383363,Simon,Angel was very helpful and welcoming and the room was clean and suitable for our needs.

7226013,39862411,2015-07-26,38703971,Savanna,We had a lovely stay with Angel and Evan. Angel was very helpful with every aspect of our stay and was able to provide some food suggestions as well. The location was absolutely perfect for catching the bus. Odin was super cute and friendly.  Communication was excellent which we really loved . We would stay here again in the future. 
7226013,40287721,2015-07-29,8984969,Jeannette,"We really enjoyed this stay the hosts Angel and Evan are extremely friendly and made us feel at home. Angels home made granola is amazing. The dog Odin is a great fella, he will allow you to fuss him but he doesn't jump up or beg for food.
The room is clean and large, the house is close to the E line and other bus routes.
Would go back here in a second."
7226013,41135501,2015-08-04,38878192,Joanne,"Angel was a great host! The place was clean and nice and she really made us feel at home. The open, inviting feeling was much appreciated! We also loved the little extras that showed that she really thought about her guests- travel brochures, maps, small toiletries. Awesome, would totally recommend for anyone looking to stay in a cool neighborhood in Seattle that wants a laid back and nice experience!"
7226013,41429554,2015-08-07,353372,Adarsh,"Angel was very helpful and communicative from the beginning - she made sure to give us directions to help avoid traffic when we had to get to Eastlake - she also told us about local restaurants and things to do around the neighborhood (I recommend checking out the Gasworks park nearby)

"
7226013,42957915,2015-08-16,10088078,Julie,"Angel était très disponible pour répondre aux questions, la chambre était agréable et propre. Bon séjour"
7226013,43174946,2015-08-17,25607660,Katy,"Angels house is in a fantastic neighbourhood, just a walk away from a beautiful lake and about a 15minute bus ride from central Seattle. 

When we arrived she provided us with plenty of leaflets and gave us directions to where we wanted to go and  tips.

3783162,17536387,2014-08-13,17555132,Jaime,"I would first like to start off by saying Tom responded quickly to all my emails, and kept me posted to any updates on any information I needed to know prior and during my stay.  After 3 different attempts to rent a home and them falling threw because of scams I was really nervous about this being the real deal.  When we pulled up to the home we were very happy with the beautiful neighborhood that is 2 quick blocks away from grocery store, restaurants and shopping.  When entering the home it just got better.  It was clean and beautiful.  The pictures on the site don't even come close to showing the true beauty of this home.  It was perfect for our party with 2 beautiful rooms upstairs that had comfortable bedding and a gorgeous bath with nice soft towels.  Then downstairs was a finished carpeted basement with a bath and sitting area.  We had several meals on the patio table outback enjoying the perfect weather we were blessed with during out stay.  It's so close to so many different things.  A beautiful Zoo, The Ballard Fish Ladder, The Fremont Troll, and a quick very easy 10 min drive to downtown  This home will be our go to when we are visiting Seattle with hopes that it won't be booked already.  Thanks Tom for letting us stay in your home.  By far one of my favorite vacations to date."
3783162,17595535,2014-08-14,6789947,Ernest,"We enjoyed a nice quiet, relaxing stay at Tom's listing. He found the neighborhood very walkable and only three blocks away from 45th St. which had lots of shops, grocery stores and restaurants. When we asked for a dinner suggestion they offered up some lovely alternatives and we selected one that did not disappoint us. We found the whole house to be in wonderfully clean condition with all the recent renovations quite evident. Accommodations for six would not be a problem considering the two queen beds upstairs and the other queen bed in the basement. We received a warm greeting and felt comfortable knowing the run down of the house before the keys were handed over. Tom is a warm and friendly host. I recommend this place as a good listing for a larger group that wants to be out of the noise and hustle and bustle of downtown yet within 10 to 15 minutes drive from there."
3783162,17802568,2014-08-17,12296587,Quinn,"My family (five adults) stayed at Tom's when in town for a Seahawks game. I can't speak highly enough about his house. It was in immaculate condition. I especially liked the lower level with the lounge. We decided not to stay downtown as we wanted a bit of space and I'm glad we did. There's loads of room here and that's without us having the chance to enjoy the garden. The area was perfect for us. A quiet street, close to restaurants and bars of the university area and a short bus or taxi to downtown. Getting access with the keysafe was a cinch. 
Tom was a fantastic host. Very warm, quick with a reply and lots of welcome advice. Thanks for the beers mate. They were delicious."
3783162,18032515,2014-08-20,19387215,Nga,"Tom left lengthy and detailed instructions to make our stay as pleasant as possible.  Check in was smooth, easy and seamless.  The house itself is beyond what we imagined and is in a great neighborhood, perfect for families with young children.  I felt like I was staying in Pleasantville. 

When I had questions, Tom's turnaround time to respond was super quick, within a couple of hours.  This was my first airbnb experience and it definitely was a great one!"
3783162,18433009,2014-08-26,3407106,Rebecca,"Tom was great, as was the house.  Excellent location, catching buses was super easy, and good food nearby (we enjoyed Tilth).  Cute shops near by (sock store, paper store, cupcake store) as well and street parking was super easy. 

House had lots of light, a cute back patio, plenty of space for four adults, and  comfortable beds.  The couch & TV setup was nice.

The house was perfect."
3783162,18671823,2014-08-30,19446147,Brian,The house was fantastic!!! Group of us were in town for a wedding and couldn't have picked a better house! We had an incredible time! Would rent the house again!! 
3783162,18820334,2014-09-01,13008147,John,Contact with Tom and Paul was easy and they provided the information I need for our group to stay at their home. The house was as listed and worked out well for our time at Bumbershoot. The location was great and we enjoyed walking the Wallingford business district.
3783162,19089210,2014-09-06,18887822,Tracy,"The house was beautiful, clean, safe, and as advertised. We knew we wanted more of a neighborhood than in the heart of busy/noisy downtown and this fit the bill. We liked being close to the park for our toddler. One thing to note is that the stairs going down to the basement (that has the third bedroom and second bathroom) are very steep. Tom was very responsive to all of my emails.  I would stay here again."
3783162,19177395,2014-09-07,20899212,Krista,"Tom's house is absolutely gorgeous! It is very clean, well decorated, and located in a beautiful, quiet neighborhood. If I wasn't visiting for a wedding, I would have loved to just hang out in the house and watch a game on the enormous television! Tom was an excellent host who truly cares about his guests comfort, and does an excellent job of maintaining an immaculate house. I highly recommend this Airbnb to anyone visiting Seattle."

The place was perfectly neat and even better than the pictures.
The neighborhood is quiet and safe but just a couple blocks away from all the services, bus stops and parks. He provided all the info we needed via email and was always nice and friendly.
100% recommended. 
Thanks a lot.
"
3783162,20041501,2014-09-22,20655708,Kevin,"Tom and his house were fantastic. Tom was very responsive to my questions and accommodated our every need. We loved the neighborhood because it is in a nice neighborhood, with a quick walk to some local restaurants, and also a quick drive to many of the cool neighborhoods Seattle has to offer, like Ballard and Capital Hill. Only 10-15 mins from downtown, too. The house itself is large and fit the 7 of us guys easily. I would definitely recommend this house to friends and would stay here again in a heartbeat."

We will definitely consider coming back to the house on our next trip to Seattle and recommend  it to our friends."
3783162,20851044,2014-10-06,3263443,Dareen,"My family and I had a wonderful stay at Tom's house for a week. The house is located in the quiet and safe Wallingford neighbourhood, where parking is available on the street. Due to Tom's excellent, elegant taste and his complete attention to detail you feel immediately welcome and like ""being home away from home"". It was super clean, neat and spacious. From the beddings to the kitchenware and the awesome big TV screen.. it exceeded my expectations. The location was perfect too.
Tom was really helpful and made sure we had everything we needed. Without a doubt I would recommend his place and we will be staying here again on our next visit."

The neighborhood is nice and quiet.  We also enjoyed walking to the lake.  The supermarket and farmacy are all within walking distance.  I will definitely recommend this house to anyone who wants to visit Seattle in the future.
3783162,30784977,2015-04-27,12999549,Connie,"Tom provided a wonderful space!  We came to Seattle from Minnesota to see the wonderful spring flowers and we were not disappointed.  This house is beautifully decorated, with great light in the large living room and different flowers outside each window.  What a treat to enjoy locally brewed coffee in the morning (Thanks Tom for providing this)!   Best of all, a jacuzzi tub with jets to come home to after a 3 hour hike up Tiger Mountain!  For the less adventurous, there is an amazing bakery/coffee shop two blocks away tucked into the residential neighborhood.  You can also walk to  a well-stocked grocery store and a number of wonderful ethnic restaurants.  The directions were clear and Tom a answered all e mails promptly.  We thank him for sharing this space."
3783162,31193543,2015-05-03,23917755,Susan,"I highly recommend the lovely 3 bedroom bungalow. The house is beautiful and was perfect for our group.  It was very clean and had everything we needed and the location was an easy commute to downtown. The neighborhood is very nice and has great restaurants, playground, a grocery and Gas Works Park within in an easy drive or walk. Tom sent the information in a timely fashion and all was set up very nicely. We did not have any problems so did not need to contact him during our stay."

3783162,31943369,2015-05-12,20420695,Wendy,"Two couples and I shared Tom's amazing home over a weekend in early May 2015.  We loved the neighborhood, ease of walking to the water and tons of nearby restaurants and shops.  The house is large and very comfortable.  We lounged in the backyard and enjoyed sipping coffee in the living room - perfect for our large group!  We truly enjoyed our stay and found the price reasonable for all of the amenities offered.  Would highly recommend!"
3783162,32187581,2015-05-15,30998461,Cecily,Beautiful house in a great neighborhood. We really enjoyed our stay at Tom's house. The house provided everything we needed and more. We would definitely stay here again!

The neighborhood was a nice family neighborhood that was close to downtown. Great restaurants near by. "
3783162,32728651,2015-05-20,33431956,Lizzie,"Tom's house was exactly what we needed. We were in Seattle visiting a sick family member at UWMC and this location was perfect for us - less than 10 mins from the hospital. Tom was also kindly allowed us to bring our dog even though he is a high-shed breed. The house is gorgeous with very nice updates in the kitchens and bathrooms. There is no AC so it got a little warm, but the fans help a lot. We will definitely stay again!"
3783162,33081535,2015-05-25,28878730,Pamela,The house was wonderful and perfectly located for exploring Seattle with my family!

3783162,33608883,2015-05-30,8855312,Katie,We stayed at Tom's for a girls' night and it was the perfect location. Such a clean house with a great layout and in a central location for the Seattleites. A+ experience

3783162,36090772,2015-06-25,12695220,Karen,"Our stay in Tom's place was fantastic. His house is beautifully decorated and quiet. The beds are very comfortable and there was plenty of room for our family to spread out and have space. It is walking distance to grocery stores, shops, and bus stops that can take you anywhere in the city. Fainting Goat Gelato was a favorite of ours!
Tom was very responsive to our questions and got back to us right away. It was a great experience!"

3783162,41315311,2015-08-07,29001411,Kathleen,"My family stayed only one night, but we all wished we could stay for a week.  The house was beautiful and comfortable; the neighborhood was family-friendly, walkable, cute, and in a great location.  I have a daughter living close by, and if our family comes next year, we would probably go back to the same house.   "
3783162,41727084,2015-08-09,28348172,Elisa,"The house was fabulous! The pictures online were a very good representation of what we found when we got there. It's in a wonderful neighborhood, very walkable to 45th that has lots of shops, restaurants and things to do. There was plenty of space for the 7 of us staying there. Beds were comfortable and everyone commented on how nice the house was kept. We had a wonderful time staying there."

3783162,44293740,2015-08-25,25328089,Alicia,I emailed with two different people but they were both helpful and responsive. Would definitely recommend as the description for the listing was very accurate. 
6239907,33325123,2015-05-26,20335491,Julie,"Seriously, the best Airbnb experience ever. They were very understanding about the late schedule for my dance event from the get go. The bed is comfortable and the large private bathroom feels like a luxury. Lots of counter space, and good lighting for makeup. They let me borrow a book from their shelf for the weekend and I was welcomed to make tea and even got to sample homemade treats. They are friendly and warm, really exceptional people. The place is close into Broadway without being in the middle of the fray, an easy daytime walk or a $4 Uber ride. I am completely happy with this awesome experience!"
6239907,33850425,2015-06-01,25773296,Saean,"Staying at Max and Anse's place was probably to best experience during our time in Seattle! They were very cute and extremely generous host. They were also friendly to my mom despite the fact that she didn't speak much English. They still try to communicate with her and welcome us like a family :). Besides the perfect hosts, the room was very spacious and clean. And the house was in a really convenient location in downtown (close to Pike place market, Ferry terminal, airport, etc) Not to forget, we definitely loved their adorable dog Stitch! We were sad to leave him behind. If we were to go back to Seattle someday, we would love to stay at their place again! Thank you so much :D"
6239907,34337388,2015-06-07,25723150,Muhuan,"Best airbnb experience ever! Max and Anse are great hosts! Very accommodating and welcoming! We love the dog Stitch!!! Location is great, walk distance to Pike place market, chinatown etc. It is a little bit pitty that we don't get a chance to have brunch together, hope we have chance next time!~"
6239907,34725307,2015-06-11,30166517,Stephen,"This is a really wonderful place to stay. The room is clean and neat and comes with its own equally well-kept bathroom. The location is in walking distance of all of Seattle's downtown sights, many restaurants and too many coffee cafes to count including the only Starbucks Reserve Roastery in the world. 
But our favorite part was getting to know Max and Anse. They are friendly, gracious, generous and a little exotic. They love Seattle and they enjoy guests - it makes for a great visit. Not to mention their dog Stitch who is a big puppy with a big heart. 
We're already planning next year's visit. "
6239907,34893140,2015-06-13,24345716,Patrick,"Fantastic stay in Seattle!  Max and Anse are super friendly, and so is their awesome pup, Stitch.  The apartment is very accommodating and clean, and includes a nice bathroom for visitors.  Hosts offered great suggestions for surrounding coffee shops, etc.  Very close access to downtown area.   I you're planning on having a car in the area, be sure to make yourself aware of the parking restrictions (very easy parking, but there are some).  Overall fantastic stay in the city!  "
6239907,35403271,2015-06-18,18298058,Alan,"Max and Anse's place is fantastic and located in the perfect place for exploring the city. It was very easy getting around using public transit and there's a zipcar spot nearby if you need to go further. They were awesome hosts, very welcoming and friendly. Both of them were full of great suggestions for places to visit and especially places to eat! I definitely want to stay here again if I'm ever in Seattle again."
6239907,35572693,2015-06-20,9681361,Kelsey,"We really enjoyed our stay with Max. He was very welcoming, our room was great, the location was absolutely perfect, and their dog Stitch was such a sweetheart!!"
6239907,36034629,2015-06-24,1581292,Debbie,Max made us feel very welcome in his Seattle apartment.

Stitch made us feel right at home and became our vacation dog, he's such a sweetheart. Besides the excellent hosts, the location is great, and the apartment is clean. I would definitely stay there again next time I'm in Seattle!! "
6239907,38280901,2015-07-14,34204390,Molly,"Max and Anse were very kind and accommodating. The apartment and room matched the description, along with their adorable dog! They offered my Mother and I coffee and tea and suggested several local restaurants and Seattle attractions. 

For the future, a clearer description of the area and the hills would be beneficial knowledge for travelers! Otherwise, so nice to have met both Max and Anse during my first trip with airbnb! "
6239907,38720185,2015-07-18,34210630,Emily,"This was our first time in Seattle and max and Anse were the PERFECT people to stay with. They are full of stories, recommendations, and kindness.

They were so welcoming, accommodating and extremely friendly.  Their beautiful condo was well kept, and the room we stayed in was clean, cozy and comfortable.  The location is PERFECT. They are not lying when they say that they are blocks away from EVERYTHING. If you like walking, the location is perfect. We did find the neighborhood quiet and safe as well.  ALSO - WE ABSOLUTELY ADORED THEIR DOG STITCH!! He was such a sweetheart, and absolutely loved being around us. As dog lovers, we did not mind at all.  We let him come into our room and hang out with us, too.  They recommended some great things for us to  do since it was our first time in Seattle, and if I can pass the recommendations along, you must have brunch at Bacco (1st/Pine Street). Such a great restaurant. Max and Anse, thank you so much for everything.  You two made our first airbnb experience lovely, and we will totally recommend your place to anyone! :) Hope to see you both and stitch soon again! "

6239907,42847542,2015-08-16,34691813,Brianne,"Max and Anse were wonderful to stay with.  Very welcoming and friendly, almost as friendly as Stitch (their dog).  Anse gave us lots of ideas and suggestions!  I would highly suggest applying to Car2Go before your trip and then being able to use that to get around.  Their place is a wonderful location, but at the top of a huge hill that at the end of the night is quite daunting."
6239907,43226503,2015-08-18,33466794,Katelyn,"Max and Anse were very good at communicating before the trip and gave us easy directions on how to locate their home and access their place. We arrived late on our first night and they welcomed us with open arms and even invited us to hang out with them and their friends. We had a blast playing guitar hero and munching on snacks! 

The bedroom was very clean and you have a private bathroom to use which has amazing water pressure. Both hosts were helpful at recommending places to eat and visit and their recommendations did not let us down. I wish we could have stayed longer as we truly felt like friends here. I would definitely recommend staying at their place!"
6239907,43922023,2015-08-23,21450091,Kyle,Both hosts were very welcoming. We actually got there earlier than anticipated and Max responded very quickly.  Location was great. 8 blocks from the water. An easy walk. Both Max and Anse had great suggestions for things to see and do. There were a number of local restaurants close to the apartment.  
6239907,44543193,2015-08-27,37837046,Robert,"Max and Anse have such a lovely home and location in Seattle!!!  They were very welcoming to my girlfriend and I who were in town for vacation.  Max and Anse were super accommodating during check in and check out.  The apartment is clean, modern, and has a private bathroom.  The First Hill neighborhood is the perfect location for any traveler to Seattle.  Pike's Market, Capitol Hill, and Downtown are all walkable.  If we go back to Seattle, which we plan to do, we will be sure to book with them!

Max and Anse have a dog named Stitch.  He is such a sweet heart!!!  He'll make you feel like your at home with his friendly demeanor.  Stitch will relieve stress from any weary traveler."
6239907,45246290,2015-09-01,16371859,Olivier,"My stay was perfect, they are lovely people not to mention the dog, your best friend forever! No hesitation to book here, definitely would come back"
6239907,45640373,2015-09-04,28971107,Brent,I had a great experience staying with Max and Anse for 2 nights while in Seattle recently. They were easy to communicate with and were quite accommodating (even though my request to stay with them was very much last-minute). The description on Airbnb is accurate and the room/bed is nice and in good condition. The location was perfect and it was great having a private bathroom (which was very clean) during my stay.  Anse (and their awesome dog!) was home to greet me upon arrival and she was full of helpful tips and suggestions for things to do. I will not hesitate to book this room with Max and Anse again if I'm ever back in Seattle!!
6239907,46489824,2015-09-11,31141678,Man Yui,"It is a perfect stay in Max and Anse's home! They are very very friendly, the location is convenient though a bit uphill walking. And i love their doggie, super cute and lovely!!!! I wud definitely stay in their house again when i visit seattle!!"
6239907,46714239,2015-09-13,37618017,Paul,"Anse was extremely helpful and a great host. We did not spend much time in the room, but the location was excellent. Definitely recommend this spot!

Stitch (their dog) was also very welcoming. "
6239907,47149532,2015-09-16,23299491,Amanda,"Max and Anse were fantastic! We arrived in town early and they let us drop our luggage off first thing in the morning so we could explore the city. The room was exactly as listed and was very clean. They were both very welcoming and gave us a ton of suggestions of what to see and do.  We highly recommend staying here! Oh and the dog, stitch, is super sweet and friendly."
6239907,47647496,2015-09-21,4141582,Joao Jorge,"Max and Anse are a very welcoming and charming couple. Their warmth and their shared impressions, as inhabitants, about the city and life in Seattle really enriched my first visit there.
Their dog, Stichy, is very friendly and funny.
Their appartment is very pleasant. The room and private bathroom were perfect and very comfortable. 
The location, on the top of First Hill, is very convenient as it is at a walking distance to many different places like Pionner Square, Pike Place Market, Downtown or Capitol Hill.
"
6239907,48387134,2015-09-26,3168009,Frank,"Nicely located and  very comfortable.  Our schedule didn't mesh very well with Max's and Anse's, but the moments they did line up allowed us to find that they are very warm personable people. Their dog Stitch is such a sweetie.  He looks big and scary but is just a big marshmallow that likes to have his tummy rubbed.  

parking is typical of Seattle, but if you know this and accept it, no problems.  We never had to park more that two blocks away, and that was when the museum across the street had an event.  We waited until the event ended an moved the car to right outside the window to our room.    "
6239907,48685195,2015-09-28,32298737,Andy,"Max and Anse were incredibly easy hosts to work with.  Every time I had a question, they answered it.  They allowed me to drop my bag off early while I transitioned from one place to another. Both were super friendly and easy to talk with but also give you privacy if needed. The bed is very comfortable and bathroom is large with excellent shower pressure and plenty of toiletries.  I was a bit hesitant to book a private room, but they made the experience very comfortable.  Don't hesitate to book their place.  The neighborhood is much more quiet than being directly downtown.  Stitch is just as friendly as everyone says he is.  He loves to be petted and spend time with you, but will also stay away if you need him to."
6239907,49350257,2015-10-03,43133820,Talha,"Max & Anse are very sweet hosts. They made sure we were able to get into the apartment smoothly when they weren't there and they provided us with many suggestions on places to go. They were flexible and accommodating through the check-out process. They live in an area that is close to everything in the city, and the neighborhood is very safe."
6239907,50302183,2015-10-11,16113697,Zachary,"Can't say enough about the hosts, Max and Anse. I didn't get a chance to meet Anse, but Max was very accommodating with my late check in and welcoming. Their place was very clean and the bed was super comfortable. I would definitely stay again if I have the opportunity to on my next visit. Also, their place is near to a Link station and downtown, but quiet, which are all huge plusses. Highly recommended."
6239907,50786719,2015-10-14,27870316,Krisna,"This the perfect place to stay in Seattle. The location is in walking distance to all the attractions and a short drive away with Uber or Lyft to other attractions if you want to give your feet a rest. The room and bathroom are clean and as advertised. Max and Anse were great hosts. They were very friendly and accommodating during my stay. Overall my stay was in Seattle was great. Thanks Max and Anse!

One tip- be careful of the hike up the hill on Cherry St. Just take an uber or lyft - it'll be really cheap."
6239907,51133458,2015-10-18,32129015,Emily,"We had a fantastic time at Max and Anse's place. It's convenient to the city to walk if you'd like, or take Lyft or Uber, cars only take a few minutes to arrive. We had a bit of a hard time getting in initially (I didn't know how to work the buzzer), but both Max and Anse were apologetic and very helpful. They gave us great recommendations on places to see and eat. Our daughter was a little scared of their dog, Stitch, at first, but Anse was so kind to keep him under control and make the experience pleasant. The bedroom and bathroom were clean."
6239907,52056006,2015-10-26,41498760,Jesse,"This being my first experience with Airbnb, Max and Anse did an incredible job at making me feel welcome.  From the moment I stepped into their apartment I was privy to any imaginable experience I could have wanted from Seattle. I've never had sushi - they knew a great place, I wanted to see some sights - they suggested a ferry ride to Bainbridge, Wanted some good seafood of course - they had a laundry list of places to visit, and so on and so forth.  Both Max and Anse are equally as knowledgeable as they are kind.

The room houses a large and soft bed, perfect for regular alarmless mornings during your stay.  Great room for couples but flying solo on my trip to Seattle I had a great nights rest as well.  They also have a tower fan, as well as numerous cover options like a simple quilt or singular sheet.  (Having a tower fan and quilt is an easy way to win me over since I overheat easily while sleeping, don't worry if you're a cold sleeper, they have plenty choices to keep you warm as well).

Of course I can't go the whole review without mentioning the famous Stitch, the house dog.  The best way to describe Stitch is to borrow from a previous review, he is simply a large marshmallow who seems determined to become your friend.  I adore dogs so this is certainly a major positive to my stay with Max and Anse.  If you're not big on dogs but can't ignore how great everything else is do not worry, if need be Stitch can also learn to give you space.

Overall, by the end of my week long stay with Max and Anse I simply felt like an old friend and hated to go after hitting it off so well with their whole family.  I cannot recommend them enough and implore you to stay with them because I would do it again in a heartbeat.  

Also you get your own bathroom, so that's pretty awesome."
6239907,52695513,2015-11-01,7445150,Richard & Ann,"This was a perfect Airbnb. I very much enjoyed talking with both Max and Anse, who were warm and friendly but not intrusive. Their place was clean, comfortable, and quiet. I appreciated the amenities, especially the natural bath products and the excellent coffee. Stitch the dog is big but very friendly. I hope I have an opportunity to stay there again.

It's close to downtown, but be aware that if you're walking, it's up a relatively steep hill from there. Or you can take a bus then walk a few easy blocks."
6239907,53140176,2015-11-05,23383812,Brad,Max and Anse were great. Very welcoming. Stitch (their dog) was also super friendly. Very helpful with tips and places to visit in Seattle.
6239907,53501681,2015-11-09,32724362,John,"I had the most amazing time in Seattle! Max and Anse were great hosts and really made me feel at home. I am looking forward to visiting again, and wouldn't hesitate to stay with them again. "
6239907,53694868,2015-11-11,46399845,Robert,"Max and Anse were amazing hosts. Their room was clean and comfortable, and the location was perfect!"
6239907,53835823,2015-11-13,195119,Michelle,"We stayed two nights in Max and Anse's apartment. The space is exactly as described- the bedroom is very nice and the bed is comfortable. There is plenty of space in the closet to hang up your coats and clothes if you like. The bathroom is quite spacious and all the fixtures worked perfectly. Both the bedroom and bathroom were very clean and uncluttered. Max and Anse were both very gracious, friendly and welcoming- we never felt like outsiders staying in their place. Stitch the dog is pretty big and energetic but is super friendly and loves all the attention you can give him. The location of the apartment is very close to the Pioneer Square MetroLink/bus station for access to the airport and around town. We enjoyed our brief stay here very much.

6239907,54100029,2015-11-16,28833975,Makara & Jen,"Max & Anse were absolutely delightful! Not only is there home beautiful & cozy, it's in a perfect location! Their dog is the sweetest thing. Their home exudes comfort and a welcoming atmosphere. We felt right at home and truly enjoyed our stay. We will be looking them up the next time we visit beautiful Seattle! "
6239907,54481291,2015-11-20,11639711,Adrian,"Stayed with Max and Anse for 3 nights. The room and private bathroom is comfortable, a good size and clean. Max and Anse were friendly and offered advice about Seattle and answered any questions I had. I didn't get a chance to socialise with them much but they were still very welcoming. Also very helpful with my late checkout time to suit my travel needs. Their place is fairly well located to Capitol Hill and Downtown. Maybe a 15min pleasant  walk to most places, or a cheap taxi/uber ride anywhere. They have a pet dog who lives in the apartment with them, he wasn't too much of a bother at all, but just consider this if you do not like dogs or feel uncomfortable with them around. Thanks Max and Anse. "
6239907,54734255,2015-11-23,12680924,Lori,"My husband and I stayed with Max and Anse (and their adorable dog!) for the weekend and had an absolute wonderful time! Very charming spot with crafty signs noting where the lavatory is, and also your room (the Cherry Room!) 

Both Max and Anse made us feel so at home from the moment we arrived in Seattle. Both offered great suggestions and conversation! We took away not only a great weekend and memorable experience, but new friends as well! 

They're also perfectly located, which made it easy for us to walk everywhere. We were thrilled to be able to explore so much on foot!  Really grateful to have found their home for our getaway!"
6239907,55729135,2015-12-05,10213417,Priscilla,"Experiences like staying with Max and Anse are precisely why I always choose Airbnb for my travels.

The apartment was modern, spacious and clean—perfect for 1-2 people. It's located in the First Hill neighborhood close to the Downtown, Pioneer Square and Capitol Hill neighborhoods. I explored mostly on foot and this was a perfect location to stay in. The room was bright and had a comfortable bed, heater and large closet. Across the hall was my own private bathroom with a hot shower. It was a relief to come home after a long day of exploring and rest here. Max and Anse are right next door and there's also a shared kitchen and living room space. Only heads up is that the apartment is at the top of a pretty steep hill—just for those who were planning to walk.

As hosts, Max and Anse are top-notch. They are incredibly friendly and warm—they really treat you like a friend and it was so fun to chat with them in the evenings. Stitch the medium-sized dog was so cute and welcoming! He is 100% people-friendly. I really hope my path crosses again with Max & Anse. I highly recommend staying with them if you're traveling to Seattle!"
6239907,56042530,2015-12-08,47948503,Daniel,"This place was great!  Max and Anse were super friendly, and made my first Airbnb experience very good.  The bathroom is private, but home made hand soap (which was really nice) was supplied, and the water pressure/heat in the shower was amazing.  The room was very comfortable, and although the temperature was fine, they provided a little space heater which I used once or twice after coming in from the cold, rainy Seattle winter weather.  They have a dog, but he is the most well behaved dog I've ever seen.  Many times I came in and he would just give me a little look, or pop his head in the room, walk around for a minute then leave (even if I petted him).

Max and Anse both had great recommendations about places to go.  Although I didn't have time to check out everything, all their suggestions that I did try were spot on.

If you are looking for just a room to sleep - you can't go wrong here.  However, the experience that I was offered was so much more than that - and it's something you can't get staying at a hotel.  I don't know if my future Airbnb excursions can possibly live up to this one, but I definitely know that I'll never go back to staying in hotels when this is the kind of experience you can get.

When I go back to Seattle again, I hope the room is still open!"
6239907,56429205,2015-12-13,37288628,Angelica,"Max was a wonderful host! (Anse was out of town visiting family, so we unfortunately didn't get to meet) We stayed with Max for a couple of days before heading out to Canada. Max was very accomadating and even gave us great suggestions on places to visit and eat. Their location is great, just minutes away from Pikes Place and Space Needle. Bedroom and bathroom was very clean and looks just like its pictured. Stich is the sweetest dog and loves to cuddle, if you allow him to. 

Parking tip: For those of you driving, there's an older man who owns the 3 story house across the street. Talk to him and he'll let you park on his lot for the whole day (overnight too)- we gave him $13 which is a steal compared to the overpriced parking garages all over Seattle! 

Overall a great experience and will definitely stay with Max and Anse next time we are in Seattle!"
6239907,56594698,2015-12-15,291421,Georgi,"Didn't get a chance to meet Anse, but Max was a great host. We had a great couple of days in Seattle and he was nice enough to help with some tips, as wells give us our privacy. Thanks!"
6239907,56897180,2015-12-19,45368481,Matt,"Max and Anse were fantastic hosts. Their place was amazingly located and very easy to get to from the Link. They were very kind, accommodating, and helpful with suggestions on what to do with my time in Seattle. I would highly recommend staying here. "

I really enjoyed and stayed with warm welcoming. My family all felt like we really visited our own grandparents' house. Room we used was so cozy and my 2-year-old boy also enjoyed and felt like home. In the morning, the view from living room windows was fantastic and beautiful. Of course the weather was great luckily but I think in any season, it will be great. Since the house locates a little bit off from downtown so it was peaceful and quiet. House interior was unique and filled with fun stuffs. We stayed only for a night but next time when we visit Seattle again,  definitely we will choose this place again. "
3488436,27340667,2015-03-02,27044740,Lee Jia,Our host Ruth is very nice and welcoming. I love chatting with her and her husband over coffee and bagels.  There are a lot of interesting decorations in their house and I really love that. The view of Mt Rainier from the living room is superb especially during a sunny day! The bedroom is clean and my friends and I really enjoy staying there! I would love to stay at this place again when I visit Seattle next time!
3488436,27806207,2015-03-12,26678765,Jamie,"Ruth was a wonderful host in Seattle for the week! The room was well prepared and had everything we needed. We are very grateful that we could use the full kitchen and use some space in the fridge for groceries. Their house is outside of the main downtown area, but there were lots of transit options for us to get around the city anywhere we wanted to go very easily and for reasonable prices. The whole time we felt free to come and go from the house, and enjoyed the times we spent chatting with Ruth and Mark about exploring Seattle and just getting to know them. We hope to cross paths again sometime. Thanks Ruth!!"
3488436,28769429,2015-03-29,30078984,Chris,Thanks to Ruth and Mark for making their room available to stay in. It was clean and tidy and we enjoyed our stay there. Thanks.

The house itself is spacious and cosy, with many amenities available for use. Ruth and Mark themselves were great people, going beyond just being airbnb hosts to personally freeing up time to take us around the city (together, we found really great ice cream!) I would definitely recommend anyone going to Seattle to stay at their place. Great price and beautiful location too. "

We felt like we were at ""grandma's house"", although we didn't use the common living spaces it was clear that we would be welcome to do so from the start. The room was cozy and nicely decorated.  
The house is located closely to the bus station and only a short mile walk to the train! That made getting into the city very easy and convenient.
They offered their help without thinking twice. Highly recommend staying with them during your visit to Seattle! "

3488436,53116096,2015-11-05,40127334,Yuxin,sorry to use Chinese to write the comment for easier to be understood by Chinese people.  Ruth 的家像是那种美剧里传统的美国人住的房子。一共有三层包括地下室。我们住在被他们改装成客房的地下室里。但是他家的房子很温馨，也很大。有独立的卫生间。我们三个人住的很舒服。也不潮，我爸妈住也完全没觉得不舒服。Ruth夫妇还在工作，他们走的很早，我们每天回来的又很晚。但每次Ruth都还没睡觉，会简单交谈几句，没看到过她先生。可能睡的比较早。她不是那种让你感觉超级热情的，但我觉得也没什么不好。她家附近很安全，反正我这几天晚上走路回家觉得街上没什么人。有一趟公交车可以直达pike street 那里。加上走路等车什么的要一个小时。去机场还是挺近的。从他家可以看到华盛顿湖，有时间真该在她家附近转转。如果你有车就更方便了。性价比还可以。当然还是住在市里比较方便啦。

The bathroom is quite large and pleasant.  There is a
large separate closet with plenty of space for hanging
up clothes.  There is a small refrigerator that we used. 
E-mail communication with Ruth was prompt and clear.
We would definitely stay there again!"

Ruth's place was wonderfully located and decorated in such a homely and cool way. Everything worked out perfectly and Ruth was such a great host being able to cater to any question I had. I would definitely stay there again and would love to explore more of Sesttle."
3488436,55160332,2015-11-28,20785470,Li,"I loved the place, it was cozy and in a nice location with free street parking. Ruth was very friendly and even lent us her gloves when we went to the mountains!"

and welcoming and went out of their way to make us feel
comfortable.  E-mail communication with Ruth was prompt
and clear. We would definitely stay there again!"

9492873,56833142,2015-12-18,1155128,Lawrence,"Matthew was an amazing host, very quick to respond to my questions and accommodate any needs I had. His place was very clean and cozy, with an amazing view of Lake Union. I am fairly new to staying at Airbnb's and this was one of my favorites by far. With a comfortable bed and couch, Netflix and view like that I couldn't ask for more!"
202260,477545,2011-08-26,994876,Meline,Kerry was great. She made herself available for any needs we had. The neighborhood was awesome. quiet and peaceful. We were able to walk to so many nice areas that a car wasnt even required. Thank you Kerry!  Vin and Tanya
202260,508109,2011-09-06,1012190,Alejandro,"Kerry was very polite and gave us respect and privacy. The place was very clean and was like staying in a hotel, but more homely. I would suggest this place to anyone."
202260,514377,2011-09-08,675460,Michelle,"Our stay at Kerry's place was fantastic! The place was super cute and inviting. The place is actually bigger than it appears in the pictures. 
The bed was one of the most comfortable we'd ever slept in. Lots of great amenities, all of which were used and greatly appreciated :) 
 "
202260,529139,2011-09-13,914118,Yorgo,"I had an exquisite time in the apartment. The neighborhood is idyllic, the house is cute and modern, the flat itself is well-structured and quite big, with one of the best beds I've slept in - ever. The furniture is pretty much brand new too, with a tasteful touch to it. The only downside would have to be the fact that the apartment doesn't get much natural light, but the garden makes up for it! Kerry is a fantastic host too..."
202260,572813,2011-09-26,969135,Catherine,"This is a spacious and extremely clean apartment with a very comfortable bed. We enjoyed meeting Kerry—a conscientious and well-informed host who provides guests with a packet of useful visitor information including restaurant recommendations, directions, etc"

202260,594708,2011-10-03,1197883,He,"Kerry has a very clean, warm, stylish large one bedroom which is a couple of kms from the I5.  Thus her apartment is quiet.  No noises from upstairs either.  Very private & introduced by Kerry who is an excellent host who gages her guests fatigue & enthusiasm levels adeptly & responds accordingly.  She is well versed with facilities in the area & helped us out with our questions. We also appreciated the 4 eggs that Kerry  had in the fridge for us."
202260,652428,2011-10-22,443616,Melinda,"Kerry was an excellent host.  The king bed was really comfortable, and the location was great."
202260,668551,2011-10-27,447047,Stephen,"Kerry's basement apartment is very roomy, comfortable, clean, and a good value.  We also enjoyed the surrounding neighborhood, even though we only spent a limited amount of time there in the mornings before leaving for our activities in the city.  Be sure to drive east to the top of the hill to get great views of the Cascades and Mount Rainier to the east and south.    "
202260,673588,2011-10-29,1275065,Jeffrey,"Kerry's hospitality was great. She was very accommodating to our special needs for this trip and very helpful. She suggested a very nice restaurant we enjoyed. The room was comfortable, and quiet. We slept well and had a very nice time."

202260,726589,2011-11-17,1329978,Bill,This is a very quiet and comfortable space in a lovely neighborhood. Convenient to everything north of downtown Seattle. Excellent food shopping within easy walking distance. Lots of fun local restaurants in several small business districts a few minutes away. King-sized bed was a real plus.  Washer-dryer for longer stays is a great convenience.
202260,734678,2011-11-21,1359832,Amy,"My first venture into the airbnb universe proved comfortable and convenient at Kerry's elegant and roomy apartment in Seattle. Nestled in a neatly-kept neighborhood, this stylish and practical place has everything to ensure your stay will pass with ease, warmth and a lux yet cozy place to lay your head at night. Kerry is a gracious host who provides a top-of-class accommodation. Well worth it and I wouldn't hesitate to book again. "
202260,746648,2011-11-27,1336316,Amy,"We really enjoyed our stay at Kerry's apartment.  The high points: much cleaner and homier than any hotel room; the art and personal design touches are wonderful; gas fireplace that makes it cozy; an extensive library to peruse and dive in to if you have the time.  Overall, we regretted only having a night to stay, and will definitely book again at Kerry's home in the cute residential neighborhood by the U district. "
202260,753510,2011-11-29,1343498,Logan,"The space was clean, quiet, and warm. The host was pleasant and helpful. We found everything we needed in the kitchen and had a really great time! "

202260,819099,2011-12-31,1514009,Sharelle,"We had a great stay here. The apartment is the basement suite of a cute house in Capitol Hill. The neighbourhood is very interesting, and Kerry gave us some excellent tips for exploring. There is a full kitchen which we didn't end up using. The bedroom is well furnished and has a cozy fireplace. There isn't much a of living room, but the bedroom has a little sitting area near the TV. Great spot for two people to stay in Seattle."
202260,852831,2012-01-09,1269053,Sam,"Kerry has a nice quiet basement apartment with a separate entry on a quiet street in View Ridge. The apartment is large and clean, and we were quite happy with the stay. The big bed and fireplace are a plus!"
202260,865388,2012-01-16,1390364,Anna,"We had a wonderful stay at Kerry's.  The place is a perfect size for 2 people, and it had everything we needed, including tasty tea.  Kerry even set out some word games for us because she saw that I liked them on my profile.  Kerry has great taste and some lovely things, and the neighborhood is pretty with a great market down the street.  We would stay again."
202260,926612,2012-02-17,1581651,Karen,"This was a very comfortable and clean apartment.  The neighborhood was very nice and the location convenient to stores, walking and parks.  At night I could cozy up in bed and turn on the gas fireplace.  Very nice."
202260,974051,2012-03-06,1827623,Daniel,"Wow! What a home away from home. All that you could possibly need for a cozy weekend (or longer) in Seattle. Kerry met us shortly after we arrived and showed us around the apartment.She let us know how she could be reached in case of emergency and recommended some fun things to do in the area.

Location was in a nice, quiet, residential area that was close to a great organic grocery store and not far from some good restaurants and the U-District.The apartment was uniquely decorated, and the bed was amazingly comfortable. The kitchen had all that you may need to make a nice meal, and the WIFI and Wii were both great additions. We also really enjoyed the small collection of movies and many great books to offer. In general, it was everything we needed, and we will definitely be back on our next trip to Seattle. "
202260,1003102,2012-03-15,1789252,Gerhard,Our 6 nite stay was very comfortable.  Access to the bus system was great and the location was convenient for groceries etc.  The wireless network to the internet was easy to set up and worked flawlessly.
202260,1015021,2012-03-18,469925,Hilary,"Beautifully appointed basement suite in safe, quiet neighbourhood was the perfect home away from home during my friend's visit.  The bed is huge and comfy, the fireplace cozy, and the kitchen stocked and enormous.  The apartment is attached to the house but Kerry gave us plenty of privacy.   Overall a very delightful stay."
202260,1188708,2012-04-27,2021750,Jess,"Kerry's apartment was the first time my partner and I have used Airbnb, and she made such a good impression we're sure to use it again for our next trip out of town. Her place was cozy, clean, and peaceful. We especially loved the fireplace (it was a typical drizzly trip to Seattle), and the charming decor!"
202260,1204215,2012-04-30,1024523,Denise & Kevin,Kevin and I were very impressed and pleased with our hostess and lodgings.  Our stay was very comfortable and relaxing.  The apartment is clean and spacious with a full kitchen and a very comfortable bed. The communication was exceptional and we appreciated Kerry's flexibility with our late arrival time.
202260,1234359,2012-05-06,568675,Melanie,"Kerry provides an ideal place to stay with ease to grocery stores, and walking.  Her apartment is in a lovely area, is spacious and very clean.  She outlines in a very complete guide book all there is to do in Seattle, rules of the house and also provides wonderful books, magazines, viewing materials.  She has a lovely back yard, private entrance, spacious accommodation where you can relax in quiet and comfort.  I enjoyed my stay very much and would hope to stay again when visiting Seattle."
202260,1267261,2012-05-12,1312012,Ryan,"We had a great stay in Kerry's suite. It's a beautiful basement apartment with an amazing library and fireplace in the bedroom. 

The design details in the suite made us feel like we were staying at a boutique hotel: Dwell Studio sheets + duvet, Red Dot's ""Real Good Chairs"", cool painted concrete floors, heated tile in the bathroom and cozy slippers.

We'll definitely come back again when we're in Seattle."
202260,1291156,2012-05-16,2230731,Diane,"Immaculate and spacious private apt. with such very thoughtful attention to details.  Location is ideal for NE Seattle- near bike path, natural food stores, University Village shopping, UW, yet a quiet, residential neighborhood with ease of walking and parking.  Great yoga studio nearby. Kerry is a very gracious host and I would absolutely return here.  Loved such thoughtful touches as motion sensor, soft lighting along the path to your apt.  Spacious, sunny backyard extra treat.  Thanks, Kerry!"
202260,1349670,2012-05-26,1598796,Julian,"We had a really good time in Seattle. Besides the weather we experienced the city is great. And Kerry as a host is just amazing. she had so many indoor / outdoor suggestionss that we couldn't do all of them. She even provided us with travel suggestions towards sunnyier places because the weather was too rainy, even for Seattle standards.

If you stay in Seattle, stay with Kerry!!"
202260,1385699,2012-05-30,1764054,Jaimie,"This was a wonderful place to stay - the apartment was well appointed, had all necessary ammenities, and was very tastefully decorated.  Clearly the owner is an artist.  It is outside the main downtown but not by too much - getting most places never took more than 15 or 20 minutes.

Was truly a wonderful weekend in Seattle.  Thanks!"
202260,1540626,2012-06-23,2189624,Mary,"I stayed here while researching at the UW and writing; I found it a really comfortable place to work and relax. The neighborhood is charming with great walking and biking trails nearby. I enjoyed the two organic/gourmet markets a short walk from the apartment. I made the short drive up to Magnuson Park several times and definitely recommend that. Kerry's biggest strength as a host is her attention to detail. The apartment is very well kept and has great furnishings, from the bedding to the books. With all the rain we had, having laundry easily available was also very helpful. I definitely recommend staying here. "
202260,1866647,2012-08-02,1826432,John,"Kerry was a welcoming and gracious host, and her apartment was a good location for our stay."
202260,2157351,2012-09-01,2299867,William,"Very nice basement apartment near the University District and close to Children's Hospital, the bike trail, and buses to downtown.  Very Clean.  Very comfortable bed.  We enjoyed our one month stay here.  We recommend it as a place to stay in Seattle."
202260,2192201,2012-09-04,2880877,Cierra,My husband and I stayed here for over labor day weekend and we had a great experience. The apartment was perfect. It has a great location and is located in a wonderful neighborhood. We would definitely stay here again as well as highly recommend it to others. 
202260,2271030,2012-09-12,594768,Anne,"Spacious apartment with full kitchen and own entrance suited me.  Kerry is kind and accommodating.  Although I missed having a TV, I learned to use Hulu on my laptop.  I loved the quiet for reading and relaxing between visits with my relatives.  Having PCC within walking distance was a perk, as were the slippers Kerry provided    . Thanks!"
202260,2326183,2012-09-17,2547639,Aurelie,"I stayed at Kerry's with a friend during 3 days, and honestly we would have stayed more time if it was possible. The apartment was wonderful, peaceful, and really clean. We also enjoyed the neighborhood, people were so nice to us. Kerry left everything we needed (maps, things to cook, games, wii...) And we couldn't expect more. 
I already know where I'm gonna go if someday I get back to Seattle. 

Thanks again Kerry, and I really look forward to see you again.

Aurelie

202260,2330465,2012-09-17,36273,Dylan,"On cleanliness I would describe it as pristine.  It's clear that she invested some money to make this place look nice: new furniture, modern heating system, lots of lights and light paint to make a basement apartment  feel nice, etc."
202260,2425498,2012-09-26,49809,Ari,"Peaceful garden level apartment in Seattle. Very nicely decorated. Kerry must be a designer who has spent some time in Japan, because she's got impeccable taste and there's a lot of cool Japanese and Japanese inspired stuff & art in the apartment. She was also very understanding and accepting of our need to leave a little later than usual (and even a bit later than we had requested) due to being new parents. "
202260,2464530,2012-10-01,3127203,Sara,"A wonderful flat with a warm host! Kerry is pleasant to work with, flexible, and offers a great place to stay in this Seattle residential area. I chose this apartment because the photos showcase a clean, design-minded flat, which is well-priced. It definitely lives up to the photos;  wonderfully clean with noticeable detail throughout, the apartment is original and makes for a truly relaxing stay. It was also a pleasure getting to know Kerry - she was helpful with our visit and great to chat with on many fronts. With a full kitchen, electric fireplace, and fantastic King-size bed, Kerry's apt is serene and peaceful. (And Daisy is an added bonus!) I would recommend the apartment to anyone looking for a clean, well-priced and well-decorated, quiet 1-BR in the area.  Thank you Kerry....see you soon!"
202260,2566835,2012-10-09,3593441,Rotem,"Kerry's apartment was amazing - so cozy, feels just like home. Everything was right in its place, we couldn't ask for anything more. It's clear that she put a lot of thought designing the place to make her guests feel comfortable. Kerry herself was a lovely hostess, she directed us to all of Seattle's attractions and was always available on phone/email. We would definitely love to stay there again! "
202260,2615553,2012-10-15,1429853,Idona,The apartment was spotless and cozy.  Kerry had turned on the fireplace to take the chill off before we arrived and had set some slippers out for our use.  She had a binder in the apartment with all the needed information and suggested restaurants and activities in the local area.  She was a great host and we look forward to staying with her again!  Thanks Kerry!
202260,2679287,2012-10-22,3300410,Brian,"Great location, close to bus lines and in walking distance to great supermarkets.

Great unit, well kept, internet is sold!  I hope to stay again on my next visit to Seattle!"
202260,2726790,2012-10-26,1178421,Stephanie,"My family and I stayed at Kerry's apartment on a last minute trip to Seattle. We were pleasantly surprised at how well thought out the layout and setting of this quaint little apartment is. From wooden toys for our little ones to comfortable furnishings and even shampoo and conditioner, this apartment had everything that we needed. Thank you Kerry for being a gracious and accommodating host."
202260,2850615,2012-11-10,3096935,Bryn,"I had a phenomenal time staying at Kerry's apartment. The place is incredible! So comfortable and really beautifully appointed. Kerry was very nice and accommodating! My only regret is that I only got to stay for one night! My favorite features of the apartment are the incredible gas fireplace in the bedroom (so cozy!), the very nice bathroom, beautiful location, and amazingly comfortable bed! It is so obvious that Kerry takes great pride in providing a wonderful place! I'd love to stay here again!"
202260,2879881,2012-11-13,3931951,Carlyn,"What a wonderful apartment-spotlessly clean, conveniently located, and perfectly private. We appreciated having PCC so close, and getting around town using public transportation/cabs was easy. Kerry is a gracious host, who has taken the time to make this space into something special. King sized bed, cozy fireplace, interesting art, comfy bedding, plenty of books - perfect. We will definitely be back. "
202260,2917667,2012-11-19,3977263,Karen,"I heard about Airbnb when friends of my daughter and son-in-law stayed at Kerry's basement apartment on a recent visit.  Everything about the place including the grounds is neat and well-kept.  Motion-sensors for nighttime lights was nice for those of us with ""older"" eyes.   Location was the primary reason for choosing this place so we were within walking distance of our kids/grandkids.  The gas fireplace provided enough heat; the washer/dryer were nice to have and having recycling baskets is always appreciated.  My only complaint is that we were unable to access WiFi and that may have more to do with updating our MAC than anything else.  "
202260,3342304,2013-01-14,4019659,Colin,"My wife, 13-month-old daughter, and I stayed at Kerry's apartment for six weeks.  The apartment was very clean and very nicely decorated.  Kerry was exceptionally accommodating - she installed a fireplace screen prior to our arrival so that our daughter couldn't touch the fireplace in the bedroom.  She also followed up with us several times during our stay to insure that everything was to our liking.  The king-side bed was very comfortable and had high-quality linens.  The apartment is in a lovely, quiet neighborhood, close to several grocery stores and the U Village shopping center.  Plenty of street parking is available.  Unlike a previous commenter, we had zero problems with wifi - it was fast and always available."
202260,3410500,2013-01-25,4374217,Nancy,Kerry's apartment is comfortable lovely and well located.  We enjoyed our stay very much..the bed is really comfortable and the linens are luxurious..thanks Kerry
202260,3475081,2013-02-04,1611487,Sara,"Kerry's place was clean and cozy.  My boyfriend and I enjoyed staying here, especially the fireplace! Kerry was flexible with check-in time, which was much appreciated with our busy weekend. "
202260,4061651,2013-04-07,4859210,Erika,"My husband and I enjoyed our multi-week stay in Kerry's apartment.  Best features: the bedroom fireplace, spacious kitchen, heated bathroom floor, comfortable bed (king-size), and great location.  Both the Metropolitan Market and PCC are only a few blocks away (we especially enjoyed grocery shopping at PCC), and the Yummy Cafe (near Metropolitan Market) serves excellent Chinese food with no MSG.

Kerry is highly professional and respected our privacy, yet checked in frequently in the first few weeks to make sure we were comfortable and to address any questions."
202260,4249976,2013-04-22,5508236,Maggie,"I have only good things to say about my stay. The apartment was very clean and cozy, and Kerry was a very helpful and considerate host. I was only in Seattle for a few days, but this would be a great option for longer stays as well--full kitchen, washer/dryer, close to several bus lines to get around the city easily. "
202260,4418343,2013-05-04,1619148,Deane,"This was the second time my wife and I stayed with Kerry, and the first time was for approximately two and a half months.  We have also scheduled a third stay, to commence next week.  So that should indicate we like her apartment very much!

A couple notes of advice regarding use of the appliances:

The on-demand gas water heater has a minimum flow rate of 0.6 gpm.  That means in order to get consistent hot water, you have to have a faucet on fairly high, especially if the temperature you are seeking is merely warm and not hot.  This is a non-issue for the shower, since the water is always going to be on that high, but it can be helpful to know for washing dishes in the kitchen, especially if you're used to a hot water tank which can support an arbitrarily low flow rate.

The clothes washer also took us a while to figure out.  It's a very nice front-loading washer, and gets clothes noticeably cleaner than the top-loader we're used to.  But it stopped during the ""rinse and spin"" cycle a number of times, flashing an error.  At first I assumed we had overloaded it, or that it wasn't draining properly.  But Kerry called in a repair technician, who said it was probably unbalanced during the spin cycle, caused by loading items which have dissimilar mass when soaking wet.  The solution is to load similar items only, such as all towels, or all cotton articles, or all nylon/polyester articles.  That worked for us, and of course similar items finish in the dryer at the same rate as well.

Here are a couple other great features that are not immediately obvious from the listing:

The garage is used for storage and not parking, so Kerry has reserved a parking spot for her guests on the street right in front of the driveway (blocking the driveway).  Also, due to the very close location of the next-door neighbor's driveway, even if you arrive home late a night, parallel parking on the street in front of the house is very easy, even for a large car.

There is a clean and well-maintained community park a block away, with large grassy areas, a playground, a swingset, and 2 good tennis courts.

Enjoy!"
202260,4536860,2013-05-11,5300420,Mathew,"The apartment was super clean and very comfortable. There was a small issue prior to my arrival that didn't effect my plans or stay in anyway, but nonetheless Kerry was very communicative and welcoming. I only wish I'd stayed longer."
202260,4639846,2013-05-17,1619148,Deane,"This is the third time my wife and I stayed with Kerry, and we'll certainly be back again!  I have heralded the myriad benefits of her apartment previously, so let me just add that the clothes washer is much easier to use than we'd thought.  Just set it to ""Express Wash"".  The clothes get clean quickly, and there were no issues for us with the ""rinse and spin"" cycle.

It was Kerry who figured out the solution, and even let us use her own personal washing machine until she solved it.  Thank you, Kerry!"
202260,4695241,2013-05-20,6375534,Susanne,"My husband and I stayed at Kerry's place for 2 nights in May, 2013 and had a very relaxing time. The place is spacious, tastefully decorated, very clean and offers everything you need to be comfortable including a wide array of books, an excellent selection of organic teas, comfy slippers,a nice garden and peace and quiet. This is the downstairs of a house and even though it is well lid throughout, for a longer stay I personally would need more natural light. We enjoyed staying in a residential area with a beautiful neighborhood for walking, great stores, markets and restaurants and with a good bus connection to downtown. This way we got to know 2 sides of Seattle; busy downtown with all its cultural offerings and an interesting neighborhood where you get to see how people live and what they do in their everyday lives.
Kerry was very helpful in answering any questions and making sure that our stay was problem free and enjoyable. I would recommend this place to my friends."
202260,4778454,2013-05-25,6295146,Carl And Liz,"Basically - wow.  This place was amazing and exceeded our every expectation.  It was our first time doing air b and b and now we are fans for life, largely because of this experience!  This apartment was perfect for a couple - has all of its own amenities and is just like living in a private and beautiful apartment.   Kerry was very pleasant, punctual, and had left a very beautiful and organized manual of the details of the house, recycling, good restaurants and activities in the area, grocery stores, etc.  The apartment was so nicely decorated that my boyfriend and I took pictures and left inspired to remodel our own apartment.  We slept so much because we could not get out of the amazingly comfortable bed.  As an extra little perk, the apartment had a book collection that could only really be described as any English major's fantasy.  There is also netflix and a wii :-)  Two great grocery stores within walking distance, very easy drive into downtown (or a walk if you're feeling active).  Public transportation very close by.  Bike paths. Street parking. Sigh!  In sort we had an amazing and were loathe to leave.  We'd go back in a heartbeat next time we're in Seattle!  Highly recommend. "
202260,4840509,2013-05-28,3247774,Lynna,"The next time I plan a trip to Seattle, I would like to stay at Kerry's again. Kerry was a great host. She gave good suggestions and was responsive and accommodating. The apartment was so clean and comfortable. Although we weren't home most of the day, we definitely looked forward to coming back to the king size bed. If you have a car, most places you're supposed to visit in Seattle is easily accessible. Thanks, Kerry!"
202260,4882423,2013-05-30,324524,Ka,"Kerry was a wonderful host! She was very helpful and punctual with getting us settled in the apartment. Her apartment was amazing! Such well-coodinated and aesthetic decorations in a beautiful spacious apartment. The apartment is equipped with anything you might want and I really wished it was my own to stay for long :) Very comfortable bed and sheets, nice sofa to relax on in the bedroom and living room. Dining table, fully equipped kitchen and refrigerator. Very cute fireplace that keeps you warm. Nice slippers to walk around.. Books, Wii, DVD player.. It is a wonderful set up! The only thing I must say is that it is a little inconvenient without a car to get around. The bus stops are about 5 blocks away, and there are three buses that get you to UW campus. But it didn't stop my boyfriend and I from getting around anyway. Thank you for the wonderful time! Also, the apartment is in the basement, so if you have problems moving up small flights of stairs, perhaps let Kerry know and she might let you in through the front door :)"
202260,4928983,2013-06-02,6513850,Kim,"We had a most excellent stay at Kerry's pad! Comfortable and homey with good sleeps in that cozy bed. There was good wi-fi connection and I was able to make potato salad with the kitchen stuffs! All the rumors are true...this is a quiet and fantastic place to be while you are in the Seattle area. Very conveniently located near UW and just a walk away from the grocery. We will most certainly stay again should we find ourselves in the area. Kerry was an outstanding host: helpful, kind and communicative. If you get a chance, STAY HERE!!!"
202260,5603066,2013-07-08,6333880,Tammy,"Kerry was an excellent hostess. She was there to great me and took the time to show me around her beautiful apartment. Kerry provided everything needed for a comfortable stay. The kitchen was equipped with coffee, tea, spices, and even ice already made. The bathroom contained wonderfully natural shampoo, conditioner, and body wash. The bedroom contained a very comfortable king size bed, sofa, fireplace, and a varied selection of reading material. I would highly recommend anyone seeking a stay in Seattle, consider staying with Kerry."
202260,6154401,2013-08-01,6291003,Alex,"Kerry's Seattle apartment was the first airbnb experience for my wife and I, and needless to say, we were thoroughly impressed. The apartment is really cozy, welcoming, and super comfortable. 

Unfortunately, we were only in Seattle for three days and couldn't take advantage of the incredibly well-equipped kitchen. The washer/dryer, though, were easy to operate and were a great resource. 

We would definitely stay at Kerry's apartment the next time we travel out to Seattle. "
202260,7198542,2013-09-10,3412466,Katherine,"The apartment was spacious, clean, and comfortable, and Kerry was great. She helped us find our way around Seattle and suggested a couple cool activities."
202260,7583033,2013-09-25,8346433,Judy,The space and Kerry herself were charming! The living area was very clean and comfortable with several amenities. The backyard was lush and inviting. Kerry was quiet and helpful with my families plans.
202260,8168003,2013-10-19,8288548,Lauri,I had a very extended stay while completing some nursing continuing education in the area and it was fantastic. The apt is clean and spacious. It is located just 3 blocks from busses that will take you to the university area or downtown. The markets in the area are within walking distance. Though the Metropolitan has a better prepared food section. The water in the shower is always hot and the gas fireplace in the bedroom is cozy. Kerry has great ideas of things to do and was wonderful about giving suggestions. Would stay again in a heart beat. 
202260,8264633,2013-10-22,594768,Anne,"This apartment is a comfortable home away from home.  The warming fireplace in the bedroom was welcome.  I also appreciated the complete kitchen, since I cook my own meals.   Kerry is a gentle host, who eased my difficulties getting everything into the apartment, and also respected my need for alone time.  I'd be happy to stay here again."
202260,8383338,2013-10-28,798416,Amelia,"I rented this place for a friend. Kerry was very gracious, helpful, and accommodating."
202260,8563210,2013-11-05,7870515,Raul,"Uneventful.... This is a basement apartment with a huge kitchen, which we didn't have any use for and a crowded bedroom.... Tiny windows in the bedroom.... "
202260,8993803,2013-12-01,2264554,Roger,"Kerry and her place was great and exactly as expected.  We got in late and she left the key for us which was very convenient.  Kerry was super nice and the next day showed us around and gave us all the information we needed to know.  Being that there are very few hotel options in the area and Kerry's house was perfect for us.  We'll definitely book with her again and have recommended her place to our family for the next time we're all in town.  

Thanks again Kerry!

P.S. Seattle can be hilly and if you're a runner like us you'll really appreciate the flat running trail 0.2 miles from her home.  Right behind the Met which also has free cheese samples!!"
202260,9112635,2013-12-08,7071091,Corina,"My husband stayed and Kerry's place for several weeks.  He enjoyed it very much!  Very clean, cozy and a great location.  Kerry is also a wonderful host.   "
202260,9253940,2013-12-16,10383080,Mateo,"Kerry is a very nice and warm host. Her place is very clean and comfortable. LOVE the gas fire place - creates a wonderful environment and heats the room nicely! Parking is a bit tight and the house number is difficult to see after dark. Over all, it is a great place to stay in Seattle!
I'd stay there again!
"
202260,9452138,2013-12-29,328119,Janise,"Kerry is not only a warm and considerate host, but she also has wonderful taste, as evidenced by her beautiful apartment and her fantastic recommendations for places to eat and visit. Her apartment had everything we needed for our stay in Seattle, and it was a perfect landing place for two people over the holiday season--10 - 15 minutes away from downtown, Capitol Hill and Ballard by car and a walk to University village and trails. Highly recommended to anyone looking for a place to land in Seattle!"
202260,9572678,2014-01-02,9540464,Karen,"This space is cozy, charming and well decorated and Kerry is a fabulous host!  A highlight for us was the fireplace facing the bed in the bedroom - So delightful!  Overall this was a great stay, and in the future when visiting Seattle we'd love to book with Kerry again!"
202260,9844663,2014-01-13,5424560,Maggie,"We loved our stay at Kerry's quiet and elegantly furnished apartment.
We appreciated the private entrance, the thoughtfully equipped kitchen (everything was top quality) and the beautifully appointed bedroom. 
Her home is in a quiet residential neighborhood close to a fabulous food coop.
Kerry was an exceedingly thoughtful host with lots of great recommendations for dining, galleries and book stores (our passion).  We have already recommended her apartment to friends looking for a  Seattle getaway. "
202260,10062752,2014-01-28,8187160,Kirstin,"Kerry was a lovely, welcoming, and gracious host. Her apartment was exactly as advertised. The location was convenient. The fireplace in the bedroom made the space super cosy! I had a wonderful stay, and will definitely look to stay again if I am back in Seattle. "
202260,10628929,2014-02-28,4871955,Christian,"Kerry met us when we checked in and made sure that we were ok. She is very welcoming and helpful. 

The apartment was spotless and had everything that we would possibly need for our stay.

The location was very convenient, but I recommend that you have a car. That will help you move around a bit faster.

You can walk to the local market for groceries and deli food. There are also a couple of very nice parks within 5-10 min walk of the apartment. Great for families!!!

All in all a great stay, and we would definitely recommend this to our friends.

Thanks Kerry.

202260,10725879,2014-03-04,4702211,Nancy,"Kerry's place was exceptionally clear and nicely decorated.  It would be a great place for an extended stay.  We enjoyed the neighborhood - the great markets and the Burke-Gilman trail.  Kerry was a helpful, gracious host.  Highly recommended.
"
202260,10794222,2014-03-08,11166641,Cathy,"My first AirBnB experience was superb, thanks to Kerry.  Her apartment was delightful and perfect for my needs.  House instructions were clear and her caring touches were evident throughout.  Her gracious hospitality and professionalism ensures a perfect stay every time. I look forward to renting again.  "
202260,11196412,2014-03-24,12697808,Michelle,"Kerry is an amazing host.  She was very accommodating while booking her place (she helped out with the kinks and was very patient with me) and during our stay. When we arrived, she gave us a tour of the apartment and provided suggestions regarding activities to do in the area. She lives by an organic market, PCC, which is really nice if you wanted to do a night in. The kitchen is small but functional,  like the rest of the aparment. The bathroom was nice; the heated floor tiles were an added bonus. Our favorite part of the apartment was the fire place in the room (the bed is King sized and comfy so when we were at the apartment we stayed in the room) gave the place a home-like feel. Overall, the aparment was what we expected. My friend and I were in Seattle for the weekend to check out UW and to get away from LA for a bit so we were in and out a lot. Once we settled in, Kerry didn't bother us and we were able to reach her easily via text and email. I suggest going through the binder with the house rules; it lays everything out for you which was nice. I would definitely stay at her place again when I go back to Seattle. She made my first Air b&b experience worthwhile and I will be recommending the community to others.  I love the personal feel of Air b&b plus the price is cheaper than a hotel & way more comfortable."
202260,11368493,2014-03-31,4181830,Annie,"Kerry's quiet apartment was just (email hidden) a lovely neighborhood, away from the hustle and bustle and traffic, but an easy quick trip to downtown. It was clean, and had a well-equipped kitchen. Kerry greeted us, made sure we had what we needed, provided a notebook with clear instructions and suggestions for our stay. A really excellent natural foods grocery in walking distance was a plus! "
202260,11501781,2014-04-05,13710406,Clare,"I couldn't have found better quarters anywhere for location, price, and amenities!
Kerry was most accommodating with this first-time user of Airbnb. The quiet location offered the best king bed I've ever slept on. Lovely large kitchen with room to move about. I can easily see why it is so frequently booked. "
202260,12530939,2014-05-05,4002406,Hans,Kerry's apartment was a great place to stay in. Kerry was very helpful and always available to answer any question. The neighborhood is quiet and very pretty in the spring for sure.  
202260,12695336,2014-05-08,11166641,Cathy,Another delightful and restful getaway at Kerry's quiet apartment.  It was a delight to see all the spring colors in the yard.  Quickly becoming my favorite place to stay when visiting Seattle.
202260,12950739,2014-05-15,14058530,Rita,"Kerry's place was perfect for my husband and I. This well appointed apartment was close to everything. We liked the location because we could avoid the freeway jams. We were more than comfortable in the fabulous king size bed. The gas fireplace in the bedroom created a cozy retreat. 
Kerry's convenient kitchen had everything we needed to cook our meals. The entire apartment was like home away from home. 
We appreciated Kerry's style. She was there when we needed her and she was kind and helpful. We will stay there again. Two thumbs up."
202260,13476344,2014-05-28,525040,Justine & Elijah,"We had the most amazing time staying at Kerry's place in Seattle. She really has thought of everything to make your stay comfortable and stress free. Kerry went above and beyond assisting us with questions and queries during our trip, from calling ahead at restaurants to assisting us with finding transport to the airport. The unit is well equipped for short or longer stays. The bed is extremely comfortable and the gas fireplace makes it so cosy on those cooler Seattle nights. We highly recommend!"
202260,14428673,2014-06-19,13848996,Bonnie,"My first foray into airbnb could not have been better. I was lucky to have chosen Kerry's lovely and comfortable apt. She was extremely nice,from the very beginning of my booking the apt.- helpful and offered information regarding the area. I loved her apt.- so beautifully appointed, every possible comfort considered, an extremely comfortable bed with fireplace in bedroom, heated tile floor in modern bathroom, very clean and well designed throughout. Even delicious coffee left for me, in the spacious and well outfitted kitchen.The setting is perfect, beautiful garden outside your door. And a parking space dedicated to you.The apt. is located in a very safe and quiet residential neighborhood. I did rent a car and found many places for shopping and dining not far away. I'm originally from Seattle. It felt like a home away from home for me. I loved it! And I'll be back! Thanks Kerry! :-)  It could not have been better!"
202260,14781985,2014-06-26,11429117,Jacqueline,"Kerry and her wonderful apartment were one of the highlights about our trip to Seattle. The previous reviews have mentioned some of the main perks, such as  the great location (beautiful, *quiet!* neighborhood, walking distance to a grocery store), the spacious apartment (equipped with everything we needed), and of course how accommodating and helpful Kerry herself is. We particularly appreciated the little booklet she had in the apartment that laid out information about the apartment and also pointed out places to go around the neighborhood for food, fun, and scenic views. It was great being able to use the washer and dryer too - this place would be just as perfect for a longer stay as it was for our short trip.

If we come back to Seattle in the near future, we would absolutely stay here again! "
202260,15056328,2014-07-01,655750,Moe,"Kerry was great! I live in Seattle but wanted an inexpensive place to stay while my boyfriend was visiting from out of state. Kerry's was perfect. I can tell how much thought she put into everything. There are tons of informational brochures and magazines of Seattle, a binder of clear and well-written house rules and other Seattle info, awesome selection of DVDs (Studio Ghibli!), Wii games, utensils, plates, tea, coffee, pots, pans, etc. I'm a clean freak and my boyfriend is in the hospitality industry, and we were both impressed with the cleanliness and amenities she provided. "
202260,15395282,2014-07-08,14387274,Karen,"This was indeed a quiet place to stay in a very nice neighborhood.  The place was well appointed, tho basic, had everything I needed to be comfortable and to cook good meals.  The grocery was nearby but not close enough to walk for the odd item.  The heating system was inventive and very efficient and kept the place cozy when it was cooler.  Loved the fire place.  The yard was very large and inviting as the weather was great this last week.  Only took us 10-15 mins to get everywhere we wanted to go by car unless we hit rush hr.  The road between this place and our son in Montlake was one of the major (email hidden)., going by the football stadium and the university.  This place would really be great for someone needing to stay near the U, would not need to deal with so much traffic.  Very restful, private and comfie.  It really was a get-away for us.  Thank you Kerry"
202260,18615164,2014-08-29,4406363,Penny,"Kerry is a warm, welcoming and thoughtful hostess. If we needed anything, Kerry went out of her way to provide it.The home was in an ideal location for us--quiet, pretty neighborhood that is close to wonderful shopping and major arterials. Not the best for public transportation but great with a car. If you are looking for city center, this is not the place for you. The apt. Is already immaculate and Kerry kept it that way for us. The only real drawback if you are staying for an extended period as we did, is that it is truly underground with little or no natural light. But there is a spot in the back yard for sitting and reading or knitting or whatever. We picnicked out there more than once for dinner. Moreover, the temp was constant and ideal as a result of the location. The bed and pillows are WONDERFUL and the rooms quite large. We were very comfortable during our stay. We already find ourselves emailing Kerry so we obviously consider her a friend. Kerry also let us have an extra guest for a few days when my sister came to see my new grandchild, providing extra bedding for a couch that worked just fine. I really appreciated that."
202260,18789761,2014-09-01,15555744,Stephanie,Absolutely wonderful place to stay. Kerry was very welcoming and walked through the apartment with us to detail all of the amenities and answer any questions we had. The apartment was perfect for us. We had everything we could have ever needed. It was a lovely place to stay for a long weekend in Seattle.
202260,19001005,2014-09-04,18735226,Aditee,Kerry and her place are both just wonderful! Kerry was very quick in responding to my questions before and during our stay and made it all very easy. She is really organized and has a house manual that details all the necessary information. She has taken great care in decorating the place and it was just perfect for us! We loved everything about our stay here especially that she had motion sensitive lights all the way to the entrance of the apartment which is in the basement and around her house. These lights were really helpful when we came in after dark one night. We loved everything about Kerry's place!
202260,19049524,2014-09-05,7723390,Sylvia,"Kerry's place was all and more than it promised: it was indeed in a quiet neighborhood, impeccably clean, and very comfortable. The kitchen is huge and would certainly have been useful to us had we been able to stay more than one night, but we had to head out the very next day to Victoria. As we arrived late at night, we didn't see Kerry until the next day, but we were greeted with a lovely card welcoming us, and we had a very pleasant chat with our hostess the next morning. The yard is fenced in, spacious, and has wonderfully tall trees--an oasis in the midst of a big city. I would definitely stay here again."
