3791920,22400061,2014-11-05,21637664,Amanda,"This basement apartment was exactly as described and pictured. It's even more beautiful in person with the modern and well maintained decor. Jen & Dave have really included so many touches to make it feel like you are in an upscale, yet cozy hotel, such as the kegerator, comfy couch with huge projector screen for netflix, hulu plus, gaming systems, etc., board games, books, snacks/tea/coffee/brita pitcher, and a guide to the area with recommendations for bars, restaurants, and activities. 

Not only that, but Jen & Dave were very accommodating hosts. Jen made herself available to any needs we had while we were there, and they were even so kind to give us an anniversary gift. 

The location for us was perfect. I was afraid that we would be too far from downtown at first, but since it was only a 10 minute drive from Downtown, it was perfect. Staying in Wallingford was a great way to get a feel for the local neighboorhoods as well as escape from the busyness of downtown at the end of the day. It's a cute and quiet neighborhood, and it served as a good launch point for us as we visited Fremont, Capitol Hill, Ballard, and Downtown. Parking is available on the side streets, and we never had a problem finding a place to park. 

Jen & Dave's house is located on a busier street, so there is some street noise that you can hear in the basement apartment bedroom. Since the apartment is located in the basement, you will occasionally hear the hosts above - walking, muffled talking, etc (just as described in the listing). This didn't bother us since we loved the place too much to care, but some people may want to hear it from a guest's perspective. 

All in all, we loved this place. We hope to stay here again in the future if we're back in the area, and we'll recommend it to friends and family looking for a place to stay in the area. "
3791920,23569418,2014-12-05,8771224,Francesca,"Jen's place is awesome!

We had a great time."
3791920,23755866,2014-12-09,23308901,Camille,"We had a wonderful stay! We were so pleasantly surprised at how nice this basement apartment was. We have young children, so it was great to be able to put them to sleep in the bedroom, then go hang out in the living room. Netflix, video games, board games, and books (not to mention being so close to Seattle sites) - there was never a dull moment ! Our only regret: not booking this place the previous time we've stayed in Seattle."
3791920,23842167,2014-12-12,21457234,Corinne,Jen was an awesome host.  She had great communication and went out of her way to help me.  The apartment was exactly as described and had everything that we needed and more.  I would highly recommend this great apartment to anyone looking to stay in the Seattle area!!   
3791920,24134593,2014-12-21,5343429,Derek,"Jen's listing was perfect for my stay in Seattle.  Conveniently located, great amenities, and Jen's attention to detail in her listing makes your stay all the more easy. Everything was clearly labeled and had easy instructions.  I highly recommend staying here, especially if you want to watch your shows/movies on her giant projector entertainment system. So bring your favorite Blu-Ray and sit back and relax on that giant couch. "
3791920,25310603,2015-01-12,1371893,Clara,"We had a great stay at Jen’s apartment! Apartment looks just like the pictures posted. It was nice to have all the great amenities mentioned-electric skillet, fridge, microwave, toaster, full screen projector, with Netflix and Hulu, beautiful stone tub/shower, etc. Apartment was conveniently located in a safe, family friendly neighborhood; Uber/cab rides to downtown Seattle were only 10-15 min. The bedroom does face a busy street but we were able to sleep soundly on the memory foam bed.  Overall, we were very pleased with Jen’s listing and hope to visit Seattle again."
3791920,25436944,2015-01-16,24356815,Dylan,"The listing was exactly what I needed. Close to UW Medical
Center, easily accessible and a great place to stay. Dave and Jen laid out all the instructions clearly. It is a very comfortable place to stay with a beautiful bathroom, bedroom and living area (with a keg and Netflix!). If I'm ever in Seattle again, I would definitely stay here! "
3791920,25470332,2015-01-17,19072887,Dave,"My stay was wonderful. The space is very comfortable and quiet. Lots of entertainment options. Plenty of space, stylish, and lots of info about the neighborhood. I enjoyed my stay very much."
3791920,25628052,2015-01-21,9359673,Michelle,"Jen and Dave's place made our stay in Seattle awesome! Their place is just like the pictures and listing, but even better. We were impressed by how they were able to transform a spacious basement into a cozy living area with a separate bedroom, modern bathroom, dining area, and home theater (our favorite part of the place). The aero bed was also very comfortable to sleep on. Despite the rainy weather on certain days, we were able to keep ourselves entertained thanks to the various amenities available and they even provided us with some friendly traveling tips and recommendations. We relied on public transportation our entire trip, but there are bus stops within walking distance and the overall neighborhood seemed safe. I highly suggest Jen and Dave's place if you're looking for a spot to stay in Seattle!"
3791920,25680284,2015-01-23,24024672,Elizabeth,Dave and Jen's place made our stay in Seattle wonderful! All of their directions and suggestions were thorough and made it easy for us to settle in. The apartment has everything you could need in order to make you feel right at home. I definitely recommend staying here on your next trip to Seattle! 
3791920,26154180,2015-02-05,24805344,Jayme,"My friends and I stayed here while on our way to portland. I saw the pictures online and wasn't sure if it would be the same since pictures can be deceiving.  We arrived around 6:00pm we walked in with the instructions given. We were so surprised how cute and comfortable it was. We immediately wanted to stay and play all the board games. We were shocked how well stalked it was. It had everything from coffee beans to a grinder to snacks to enjoy. Only two of us enjoyed the kegerator, that was pretty neat to me. There were four of us and the 1 bedroom apartment was perfect. We all wanted to stay longer and we all wanted the rent out the apartment. We were really pleased with our stay and the hospitality. We will def be coming back again. Thank you so much. "
3791920,26201002,2015-02-06,26502565,Tyler,"Really appreciated our time here. Everything was clean, organized and as advertised. Loved the big couch where my girlfriend and I watched a Netflix movie. The noise wasn't as bad as we had thought it would be on a major street. For the price and features, you can't beat this. You can easily tell our hosts paid attention to detail and it really made our first AirBnB experience an awesome one. Would highly recommend and we may be back!"
3791920,26292126,2015-02-09,21709380,Alyce,"Jen and David made us feel welcome. We arrived early and jen let us know coffee places close by we could go to and emailed shortly after (45mins) to say place was ready.
The place is beautiful spacious made to feel at home with everything u could think u would need. 
You can hear noise of footssteps above but jen and dave wrote that to expect (website hidden) flicks is a HUGE bonus ! 
Would recommend here to anyone! "
3791920,26491023,2015-02-14,26327974,Andrew,"Jen's house is a perfect location for exploring Seattle. The place was super private, comfy and well decorated and there's beer on tap. "
3791920,26673479,2015-02-17,20275781,Laurie,We had an amazing time in Seattle and staying at this great location played a huge part in that.  The location was perfect - near our kids - and it was very a comfortable space.  We loved all the games and the projection tv.  A couple of our son's friend came by each night and we thoroughly enjoyed the space...the kegerator played a huge part in that!  I hope they left enough $$ to cover what we drank!  We will definitely recommend this destination...our son and his girlfriend we even talking about a stay-cation!  Thanks so very much!
3791920,26838106,2015-02-20,9372135,Celia,The apartment was perfect for our needs during our recent visit with nearby grandchildren!  It is thoughtfully designed and conveniently located. The bed was so comfortable... Almost like home! We will definitely look forward to staying here again!
3791920,27276306,2015-03-01,18549252,Jessie,This place is awesome :) very chic and clean! Jen was super accommodating and we felt like we were home :) thank you guys!
3791920,27381297,2015-03-02,14939199,Sean,"Both Jen and the basement apartment were fantastic. Jen was quick to communicate, incredibly accommodating of our last minute reservation request and the apartment was phenomenal. We truly couldn't have asked for more - a comfortable mingling space, complete with a projector and all the Netflix and Hulu you can handle. Nothing was overlooked and Jen was an exceptional hostess.

If I am EVER in Seattle again and need to be put up for a night, Jen will be the first person I contact! "
3791920,27612541,2015-03-08,28346332,Mary,"Jen was very accommodating and welcoming.  She had sent me e-mail directions but I was unable to access electronically and she provided the necessary information over the phone.  The apartment was as depicted in the photos and we were very pleased.  The neighborhood was great and on-street parking was available.  We had a little trouble with the inflatable extra bed, but it was our error and Jen and her husband came to our rescue promptly!

Since the house was on a busy street, there was traffic noise that didn't bother us but may be a concern to very light sleepers.  Overall, a great experience!   "
3791920,27720695,2015-03-10,26807659,Mark,"We were greeted by Jen when we arrived. Everything was neat and clean and well supplied. The location was convenient to downtown, Fremont, University, etc. Overall a great weekend and this space was very comfortable and a great value. "
3791920,27807838,2015-03-12,5066460,Levi,We loved Jen's place. It felt very private and had a modern and cool feel. The Wallingford neighborhood is so neat and a fast drive to downtown Seattle. Jen really thought of everything in this place. Exceeded expectations. Thanks Jen!
3791920,27846708,2015-03-13,28258591,Mihir,Great host! Such a spacious and comfortable place and very private! Would recommend to any friends or family!
3791920,28467304,2015-03-24,7748377,Stephanie,"Great place to stay, close enough to downtown Seattle to drive (about 10 min) but also isolated enough in the Wallingford area to be able to walk to nearby neighborhoods like Fremont and Univ. of Washington. 

We didn't see Jen or Dave much (once each) but it was totally fine with us! We knew that if anything came up we would be able to call them for help. The basement was awesome and had everything we needed; towels, kitchenette utensils, etc. Great stay overall! If we ever come back here we'll definitely look into staying here again! "
3791920,28700774,2015-03-29,24049999,Patrice,ABSOLUTELY LOVED Jens place! :) very cozy and exactly as described. When we needed anything Jen and Dave were available to help! The apartment looked as described and we felt welcomed. Would definitely stay here again! Highly recommended! :)
3791920,29179770,2015-04-05,14613066,Kerry,"The basement apartment was perfect for our girls weekend away. We just wish we had more days to play all the fun board games and wonderful books in the place! We had all we needed and more! The street outside is a little busy and you can hear traffic from the bedroom, but it wasn't really a problem for us.  We'd love to come back!"
3791920,29613924,2015-04-10,13751778,Wayne,"My girlfriend and I absolutely loved our stay in Seattle, and Jen's place played a big role in that!  Her place is clean, spacious, comfortable, and relaxing.  It is everything the space is advertised to be and more!    We especially appreciated the fully stocked bathroom.  Street parking was never an issue. Would definitely recommend, and stay here again."
3791920,30302493,2015-04-20,28877851,Tyler,"This place is perfect! And the hospitality was even better.  We arrived in town a little early and we were able to get to the apt before check in, we appreciate that SO much!!!  This place has all the accommodations one needs for a stay in Seattle.  The location is great as well.   Just a short walk from 45th where you have a collection of great eateries and bars and a couple blocks from the bus route to take right into downtown.  There is a 7/11 just a block down for your late night cravings and a laundry mat even closer. The neighborhood is beautiful as well! Thank you again for letting us stay at your perfect apt.  Much thanks, Tyler and Loren "
3791920,30519216,2015-04-23,13536472,Declan,Jen was so accommodating and her apartment is very relaxing. Had a great time there - perfect location too! 
3791920,30641752,2015-04-25,31296937,Kathleen,"
Great one bedroom basement apartment close to public transportation.  Very friendly and welcoming."
3791920,30933931,2015-04-29,1316156,Jason,"This basement apartment was great, it had everything we needed and then some. Great amount of space and very comfortable. Jen & David were very responsive to our communication and even provided us with an extra HDMI cable so we can use their projector to watch some videos!"
3791920,31578255,2015-05-07,29128646,Melissa,"My lady and I had a perfect time at Jen and Dave's place. The basement suite looked exactly as it was pictured and described. The bed was comfortable. It was easy to access Netflix/ Hulu using their PS4 and projection system. They provide detailed instructions to work these items which help if you are not technology savvy. (I am not!!)

They are located in a beautiful neighborhood right down the street from great restaurants and public transportation. We found it very easy to get around Seattle using the bus system and Lyft. There is also a great deal to do within walking distance.

We will definitely try to stay here again the next time we make it to Seattle."
3791920,31904343,2015-05-11,17091619,Jayant,The apartment was perfect - cozy and stocked with everything one needs. It's also in a location that gives you easy access to the main highways. Definitely recommend it!
3791920,32503986,2015-05-19,28210322,Joyce,"We stayed here for a long weekend while visiting my daughter, son-in-law, and one year old grandson for his first birthday party. It was convenient to be so close for the big event. This modern comfortable apartment was perfect for us. Even though it is on a busy street, it was quiet and the bed was especially comfortable. We spent most of the time at my daughter's home, and one night we relaxed here, had a beer from the kegerator, and watched a movie on the large screen video which was different than a regular TV. The apartment was like it was described on Airbnb. Although we never got to meet the hosts,  we thank them  for a pleasant stay."
3791920,33667429,2015-05-31,30149162,David,"The listing that you see is very accurate! The pictures that Jen has posted online is exactly how the apartment is. There are all sorts of board games and video games, if you are into that sort of thing, just a very home like experience! Kitchen has fridge, microwave, nice bar area, beer on tap if you want which we didn't use, popcorn with air popper. I had a few challenges with the gaming device so we could play a Red box movie that we rented at the 7-Eleven a block down the street, but Jen emailed me back promptly with an answer to my questions. Jen has very detailed instructions on how to operate the projection system. There are no live TV stations to watch, only Hula and Netflix, but hey, we are there for vacation! If you want something to eat you walk a few blocks towards Wallingford area. We found a very nice restaurant named Mejari Fushion Sushi, 1924 N 45th Street, that not only has sushi but AWESOME breakfasts, very nice salads, and if you visit, see if our FAVORITE waitress, Gloria is working and ask for her! They also have the best coffee ever, our opinion though! A bus line that takes you downtown is available only a few blocks away and you need $2.50, exact change, for a one way trip. (Download the ""Transit"" app on your phone also). This was a huge help for us to get around Seattle and helps you know where a bus pick up and drop off point is. Thank God for the young man downtown that told us about this app!  Bedroom is on the end of the house that faces the street so when you go to bed you can hear the traffic but it really is not bad! We definitely would come back here again! "
3791920,34223896,2015-06-06,33165294,Andrew,The place was what we needed. It fit 3 people very comfortably. Great location outside of the city. Definitely would stay here again. 
3791920,34932280,2015-06-14,26791050,Tom,"Staying with Jen and Dave was awesome!!  A very fun apartment with a big screen, overhead projector and Neflix to watch movies.  Keg of beer in the kegarator.  The kitchen had coffee and coffeemaker, well as popcorn and a hot air popcorn maker to use.  A very comfortable bed and a great bathroom with towels laid out for us to use!  On one night we came home with pizzas to cook, forgetting that there was not an oven in the apartment.  But Dave and Jen took the pizzas and cooked them for us upstairs in their house!!  Great hosts!!  When we come to Seattle again to see our daughter, we will definitely stay with Dave and Jen again!"
3791920,35651146,2015-06-21,30880041,Morgan,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at this cozy Seattle apartment! The hosts were quick to answer questions and extremely hospitable, leaving us tons of ideas and resources to explore the city. The neighborhood is the most gorgeous, quaint little area with tons of access to parks and other Seattle sights. I have already referred Jen's apartment to friends who will be visiting the area in the future--it was better than we expected. Overall, we were more than pleased with our accommodations!"
3791920,37558646,2015-07-08,3050753,Madeleine,"Jen is a great host! She send me the info to the apartment a few days before my arrival,and kept me up to date during my stay. The basement apartment is modern and spacious a little dark but cozy.. very well stocked with games and books and a big screen to watch Netflix etc. on..
"
3791920,38579751,2015-07-17,25225863,Yvonne,"We absolutely enjoyed our time in Seattle and a large part was due to our wonderful basement apartment. The space is conveniently located to bus routes, making public transit accessible and a great way to get around the city. The apartment is just as it appears and was perfect for a family of 4, especially when traveling with teenagers. We enjoyed playing games and watching movies on the projection screen. Jen was more than accessible and so helpful. She answered my questions before and during and it was like having our own, personal tour guide.   The area of Wallingford is safe charming and there is a lot to do within walking distance."
3791920,39147462,2015-07-21,28806225,Beth,"The cutest little 1-bedroom apartment in Seattle!  Wow, the photos and description didn't do this place justice.  The remodeling and decorating were on pointe.  We really loved our stay at Jen and Dave's basement apartment.  So much so, we opted to stay in and watch movies on the huge projector TV in the evening as opposed to going out.  We appreciated the guidebook they provided too and had breakfast at The Dish (wonderful!).  We will most certainly return to rent here again.  Thank you Jen and Dave for your wonderful hospitality!!"
3791920,41725349,2015-08-09,4623759,F,"Jen and Dave's place was a lovely base for exploring Seattle.  It is about a mile walk from the north of the campus of the University of Washington, and about two miles from the south of campus, and close to downtown, Ballard, Green Lake, Fremont, and the excellent restaurants and ice cream places of Wallingford.  Buses can take you anywhere, and with an ORCA card we were able to explore beautiful Seattle.   The basement apartment is cozy and welcoming. The hosts were in constant contact.  For example, when their toaster wasn't working, Dave went out and bought a new toaster for us, and also bought for the apartment an excellent book on walking routes in Seattle, since Jen knew that we were interested in walking a lot."
3791920,42276795,2015-08-12,35172126,Lindsay,"Jen and Dave's basement suite was a lovely place to stay during our trip to Seattle! It's a great size - lots of space for three people! We really enjoyed the selection of board games and the keg tap in the fridge is a nice touch. We had fun exploring the neighborhoods nearby; we especially loved our night out at Mkt, a nice restaurant within walking distance. The road outside the suite is a little noisy, but overall we really enjoyed our stay!"
3791920,43538242,2015-08-20,19809278,Katrina,"This modern style apartment was amazing! It looks absolutely stunning in person! It's more than enough room for 2 people , cozy & very informative in every way! From Jen's detailed message on how to enter, from the tech guide inside, to the signs on the walls. There was no need for any additional urgent questions since it was greatly laid out for us upon our arrival! It's in a great location in a beautiful neighborhood. There were times we didn't want to leave the house, it was so cozy!

The only areas of improvement would be investing in a stove as well as putting more of an emphasis on there not being a stove. More warning about what to expect as far as their noise level since they live above the basement; the noises can be startling especially on your first night/day not knowing what to expect. An even more detailed tech guide of all the electronics not just the PS4. Lastly more emphasis on where the wifi password is located because it could easily be missed if a guest isn't paying that much attention to detail. These areas of improvements are only minor and wouldn't steer me away from returning again! I'll definitely be back the next time I visit Seattle! "
3791920,43795109,2015-08-22,14486150,Anthony,Amazing place! We arrived around 1:30 AM from a late arriving flight and it was extremely easy to enter the separate apartment. It was nice not to have to disrupt the host in the late evening hours. Very close to public transportation and the neighborhood is great! Will defiantly book again on our next trip!
3791920,44111728,2015-08-24,28806225,Beth,"Jen hosted my daughter and her husband.  They are going through a very difficult personal time right now and needed a get-away.  My daughter and her husband felt the apartment was hip and fun - it was just the break they needed from what is happening right now.   Jen, again, thank you for your lovely hospitality.  It is appreciated!"
3791920,44651893,2015-08-28,34784249,Peter,"We loved staying at Jen & Dave's apartment. They were excellent hosts, promptly answered all the questions and addressed all of our requests. The apartment was very clean and comfortable and in a great location. Restaurants and supermarket are walking distance, a great playground for kids is only a block away. Would definitely recommend this place!"
3791920,45242487,2015-09-01,15582277,Steven,"Loved the house and location! Jen was an excellent host. She was accommodating and friendly, and we felt we had privacy. Very comfortable bed! 

"
3791920,47053693,2015-09-15,39546848,Jonathan,"The host was easy, friendly and quick to communicate with. The listing was just as expected. The neighborhood was nice, and along a busy street."
3791920,48674947,2015-09-28,31343103,Maricela,"My girlfriend and I had an awesome 11-night stay, and a great first Airbnb experience. The place was just as described, very welcoming and comfortable. Yes, there was some noise from street traffic and from the hosts living upstairs, but nothing to really mar the coziness and convenience of the place. The location was perfect for us to easily get both downtown and to the UW campus, and it was nice to have a whole place (as opposed to one hotel bedroom) to come back to and chill after a busy day. Jen and Dave were great hosts, and Jen checked in a few times to make sure we had everything we needed. We appreciated the attentiveness and couldn't have been much happier with our stay."
3791920,49445003,2015-10-04,40305192,Cynthia,"Jen's apartment was wonderful, and certainly made my first experience with Airbnb a great one! I can't stress enough how cozy the apartment was, really great if you want to stay in for the night! Although located on a busy street, it was a great starting point for exploring the city! My friends had no trouble getting around, whether is was driving around or taking public transportation. If you're planning to visit Seattle, I highly recommend staying here!"
3791920,49770786,2015-10-06,5066460,Levi,This was our 2nd time staying at Jen's place and we still love it. The location is nice and relaxing.  It felt like home staying here again. Definitely a top pick for Seattle!
3791920,52509321,2015-10-30,45640779,Cindy,"AMAZING! 
My boyfriend and I had the wonderful opportunity to stay with Jen for to celebrate our anniversary were he proposed to me! while there Jen made it a little more extra special by giving us there favorite bottle of wine which was delicious!we didn't get a chance to personally meet them but Jen was SUPER HELPFUL! She responded immediately back to any questions that we had. Definitely check out her recommendations cants go wrong there, the apt is true to the posting when you first walk in there is a very nice and laid back ambiance to the place. The bed was Soo comfortable! The key entrance was a very cool way of coming and going without having to worry about a key card or keys getting lost. True when you first arrived you can definitely hear the pitter patter of tiny feets running around above you. But we didn't stay very long in the apt and it wasn't annoying we actually thought it was very cute! we were mainly out exploring! If your ever in Seattle for a few days I highly recommend purchasing a city pass well worth the money! And staying with Jen, they were always either a short bus ride or walking distance to everything! 
While we were there on our second night we opted to stay in an enjoyed the amazing theatre set up in the apt! Wish we had one back home :(  all of the electronics were easy to use thanks to Jens little instruction manual that came with pictures for those who are kinesthetic learners like me ;) all in all we had a very memorable stay! Will diffinately recommend them to all my friends and they will Permanently be a yearly visit in our books for a very very long time!"
3791920,53979781,2015-11-15,18901458,Robin,"Location was central and parking was stress free (a definite plus!).  Place is modern and roomy, and we felt very relaxed there.  Bed was very comfortable and the place had everything we needed.  We had an issue getting in the 2nd night ... Jen was very responsive and texted she'd be home in 10 minutes, but we were able to resolve it over text (thanks, Jen!).  There was some street noise, but the white noise didn't bother us.  Would definitely stay again!  "
3791920,54371252,2015-11-19,9997206,Gina,We had a great time at Jen's place! It was so comfy and convenient. Jen's instructions on how to find and get into the space were very easy to understand. Parking is abundant and literally t bother us since we had to get up early as well. I love Seattle and would def stay with Jen again!
3791920,55558725,2015-12-02,8410500,Jennifer,"We stayed at Jen and Dave's place during our holiday visit. It was a a comfortable apartment for my husband, our 1 year old and me: it was huge! It had the amenities we needed, we ate out most of the time so the kitchenette worked for us, and who can argue a keg in the fridge! We were able to have some friends visit and there was plenty of space. There was some street noise in the bedroom, but that didn't bother us because we like a little bit of noise. I could see the bed being too firm for some, but it was so cozy under the sheets. You can, however, hear the noise from above floors; a difference we could tell when we realized they had been gone for the weekend, and returned a couple of days before we left. 

I'm originally from Seattle, so I was familiar with the area. The location is really great, there is a laundry mat and 7-11 about a block away, and a few blocks south is 45th where all the food and coffee is! It was the perfect location for our needs. They also had some guides that I thought were awesome for those who weren't familiar with Seattle. 

There is also plenty of street parking, which was no problem for our car rental. 

I would definitely recommend this apartment for your future visit to Seattle! "
3791920,56715689,2015-12-17,42945071,Jacque,"Really nice apartment in a great location. Easy access to I-5, great access to downtown on 99. Apartment was clean and we enjoyed the books and games that were available. Lots of hot water, which was great after a cold day sightseeing. We had a rental car and had no trouble finding street parking on Eastern. Only issue was that it got pretty noisy about 7:00 each morning. However, we wouldn't hesitate to stay here again on our next trip to Seattle. Thanks for making our first Airbnb stay so nice!"
6452801,33640237,2015-05-31,187456,Aks,The host canceled this reservation 38 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
6452801,36411376,2015-06-28,22291678,Mitch,This stay was great!  Joe was incredibly friendly and had some great recommendations on what to check out nearby.   The attention to detail and little touches throughout were excellent.  Lots of trendy bars and restaurants within walking distance.  A $10 Uber ride gets you to Century Link and/or downtown.  Will definitely be back if we need a space in the area.  Thanks Joe!
6452801,39410804,2015-07-23,36570938,Janice,Joe was a very gracious host. He is very friendly and accessible. The unit was great and the chickens were fun! Location is great. Plenty of room. 
6452801,39622798,2015-07-25,8568863,Andy,"Joe was great at welcoming us and chatting with us during our stay. The space is lovely, with every amenity one could imagine--even popcorn! The bathroom, bedrooms and common spaces are terrific. Outside space is wonderful as well. It is a quiet block, but it is a very short walk to the heart of the Capitol Hill neighborhood. They do offer parking for an additional $10/night--if you have a car, I would suggest reserving this space."
6452801,41211283,2015-08-05,6938945,Barbara,This was a comfortable and cozy place to stay.  The hosts were incredibly friendly and helpful and the location is amazing.
6452801,41368057,2015-08-07,16219455,Michael,"Joe and Ronniemae provided everything we could have asked for before we needed it; everything from essentials to superfluous items were labeled and conveniently placed inside of drawers and easily located. The room was clean, inviting, and very comfortable. The listing had the feel of a hotel, while retaining the ""at home"" feel. 

As far as the location, Capitol Hill was amazing. Restaurants, entertainment, and public space were easily accessible and within walking distance. Uber was almost always available, and for the few times it wasn't, bicycle rental stations were littered throughout the city. I would highly recommend this listing! Just know walking daily was a workout!  "
6452801,41752477,2015-08-09,33993847,Ted,Wonderful visit to Seattle.  Our host waited up for us and greeted us as our taxi arrived.  The rooms were well appointed and very comfortable and clean! Great location in the Capital Hill area.  Would definitely recommend this host!
6452801,41944426,2015-08-10,33765137,Shirley,We arrived way early but Joe and Ronnimae took in our luggage and held it while we went and saw the sights of Seattle. They even carried our 6 suitcases down the stairs to our rooms. The rooms were comfortable and nicely decorated and we were left skittles (my husband loves sweets.)  Now for Joe and Ronnimae. We were greeted with smiles and sent on our way with hugs. If we ever return to Seattle we will definitely stay here again. 
6452801,42152606,2015-08-11,10108519,Celia,"What a charming place!  Joe greeted us and from the very start, was friendly and informative. The space is clean, cozy, quiet,  and delightfully appointed with many thoughtful amenities and treats. The beds are excellent with very soft sheets. We slept well and the nearby chickens awoke at a reasonable hour (no rooster).The location is fabulous if you like a lovely walking neighborhood and plenty of choices for eating and drinking.  My friend and I would most definitely return. "
6452801,42679266,2015-08-15,5527309,Dmitry,"We stayed for 2 nights in Ronnimae's apartment and it was the perfect base from which to explore Seattle. Capitol Hill seemed like an interesting and lively neighborhood, while the apartment was also within walking distance of the city center and Pike Place Market. Ronnimae kindly accommodated our rather late arrival time, which was nice, and everything in the apartment is labelled, making it very easy to find everything even if you're only staying for a night or two. "
6452801,43965402,2015-08-23,38601355,Alli,It was a great location within walking distance of food and drink. The hosts left a basket in each room with some amenities which was delightful!
6452801,46898796,2015-09-14,9483885,Stuart,"We had a lovely brief stop here. Joe was a hugely friendly host giving us plenty of good info. The neighbourhood was lively with some great taquerias. The flat itself was cosy with comfortable beds, strong coffee and a good shower. A really nice base to enjoy Seattle. Hope we can stay longer next time."
6452801,47445779,2015-09-18,17781989,Lydia,Great funky apartment in the heart of Seattle's coolest neighbourhood. Joe was a great host and provided some cool tips on places to eat and drink in the area.
6452801,48518139,2015-09-27,17558565,Elizabeth,Great location near lots of cool stuff but not noisy. Hosts were very nice.  Loved having the chickens right outside our window.
6452801,49283010,2015-10-02,1526411,Graham,"Joe's place was in a great location and we had a perfect night stayover at his place. We were able to walk downtown (Pike Place, we dawdled and took our time) and back. The listing is better than described, Skittles are a nice touch, and we all felt very comfortable."
6452801,49428653,2015-10-04,4961909,Adam,"Joe was a fantastic host: friendly, flexible, helpful and laid-back. The basement suite in their beautiful old home is nicely renovated and was the perfect base for our weekend getaway. Capitol Hill is a lively and eclectic neighbourhood full of independent stores, bars and restaurants. If you're a dog person be sure to introduce yourself to George, Joe and Ronnimae's friendly St Bernard."
6452801,51043326,2015-10-17,16524785,Robby,"We had a comfortable stay in a great location. We were able to walk to brunch, the park, and nightlife easily. The apartment was well stocked including board games and a popcorn popper. "
6452801,51903088,2015-10-25,27536029,Kevin,Joe was incredibly welcoming and helpful as we explored Seattle! He made us feel right at home. 
6977095,52220239,2015-10-27,13680626,Glenda,Patrick's place was perfect for our family. We stayed in the upstairs and the downstairs and had plenty of room and privacy. Going between the two spaces was easy with the sidewalk ramp and the access codes were identical. Winda was accessible for our needs and came right out to fix a plumbing problem. Everything was immaculately clean which we appreciated with a crawling baby! Patrick provided a pack & play and all beds were comfortable. The location was excellent to get around in West Seattle and the metro area. We would definitely stay at Patrick's place again! Great house! Great hosts!
6977095,55005108,2015-11-27,11071242,Shireen,Patrick's place was great! The upstairs kitchen area was very spacious & had all new appliances and all the needed supplies to cook meals. The upstairs living room area was comfortable and we were able to watch movies on Netflix. Downstairs was also fully equip and very comfortable. Slept 5 adults comfortably. Winda who helps manage the house was AMAZING. She was very helpful & accommodating. She helped to make our experience in Seattle an amazing one. I would highly recommend this house! 
9908591,56633766,2015-12-15,1776113,Mary,The host canceled this reservation 12 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
9908591,56652302,2015-12-15,21975044,Patrick,Abby was very warm and welcoming host. The space has a convenient independent entrance and had everything I needed including a full kitchen. The space was very clean and well apportioned. It is close to great places in Seattle and yet is on a quite street. I recommend it!
1561256,7049858,2013-09-04,2545889,Jennifer,Betty and her family were excellent hosts. They were extremely friendly and made us feel right at home. Betty provided a delicious breakfast every morning.

1561256,7057517,2013-09-04,8442506,Barbara,"Bettys home is beautiful, clean and comfortable. The room is cozy and quiet with a big bed and a balcony infront. Betty is a wonderful host - She gave me a lot of advices for my further journey and offered an amazing breakfast with fresh fruits, homemade muffins and toasts. I absolutely recommend this place."
1561256,7295587,2013-09-14,5055002,James,"Adequate parking, large home, as said semi-private with privacy honored.  Great experience, very, very good breakfast."
1561256,7539681,2013-09-23,5055002,James,"My mode - arrive late, leave early, allowed very little time for interaction but everything was great.  I would recommend staying with Nina to anybody looking for a place to stay.  The room was nice and private."
1561256,7780954,2013-10-02,8799475,Amanda,"Betty's house is a cute, large house on a dead end street. It's near buses to downtown, Northgate, and U District. The room it's self, is semi-private, just as the listing says. The bathroom is a shared bathroom.

Betty was very helpful and accommodating. She offered to make us weekday breakfast since she was home, and was super flexible with a few dietary restrictions we had. She also provided us a ride a few blocks away to a friend's house so we weren't dragging our large suitcases around town.

She was also super flexible with our arrival timing. We were taking the train from Vancouver, and didn't get there until Midnight. She left the door unlocked with instructions to head to the left, there will be a lamp left on. However, we didn't know we had to go upstairs AND THEN head left, so we accidentally startled her teenage son, who was also very helpful at figuring out where we belong.

Overall, Betty is flexible and accommodating to schedules and diets. The house is clean, just as expected according to the listing, and in a great area. "
1561256,8030160,2013-10-13,3064701,Larry,Betty is a beautiful soul. It was such a privilege to meet her and stay in her home. She made me feel very much at home. The location is pleasantly quiet even though it is near major streets. I enjoyed the walk to and around Green Lake. There are good restaurants within easy walking distance and getting to and from I-5 was very easy. A great value in a warm-hearted family.
1561256,8180731,2013-10-19,1227553,Sarah,I had a pleasant night over and would recommend Betty's airbnb!  Breakfast was excellent!
1561256,8761329,2013-11-16,7579651,Ben,Betty's house was great. I had a fantastic time there. Her house was immaculate and just as described. I enjoyed meeting her and our chats in the  morning over her delicious oatmeal! Will definitely be back! 
1561256,8775429,2013-11-17,4153423,Matt,Betty was a fantastic host and she was always there if my cast/crew needed anything. This place was exactly what I was looking for and the house is warm and inviting. I would recommend this place! Thank you Betty!
1561256,8984586,2013-11-30,1199201,Judy Arielle,Betty provides clean and comfortable accommodations in Seattle. She was easy to communicate with for checking in details and cooked a delicious breakfast including a smoothie made from homemade almond yogurt. Delicious! Thanks much Betty!

1561256,9435947,2013-12-28,60227,Jessica,"Betty is an incredible host! She is definitely one of the best AirBnb host I have met in the past few years. Betty is generous, kind and would go out of her way to make her guests feel comfortable. The bathroom was spotless and bed was so comfortable my friend and I fell asleep instantly every night. Certainly, as all other guests have mentioned, Betty prepares a scrumptious breakfast in the morning. The breakfast kept us going until late afternoon. The location is close to downtown and other attractions. I will not hesitate to go back to Betty's place next time I'm back in Seattle :)"
1561256,9870481,2014-01-15,7075336,Jolie,"I had a lovely time staying with Betty and her family. Although I was only there one night they were extremely warm and welcoming. I had an interview the next morning, and although the room was ""semi-private"" all was quiet after 10pm. They're located in a lovely neighborhood with plenty of parking, very safe feeling. Wonderful experience overall! I would definitely stay there again."
1561256,10099076,2014-01-30,3197056,Jordan,"In a word the experience I had at Betty's house was 'magnificent'.  She is a beautifully spirited person who embodies giving to other people.  The place was as advertised in every sense, in addition the bed was the most comfortable one I've ran across while on airbnb.  Thanks Betty for making my first few days in Seattle as comfortable as possible!  "
1561256,10316782,2014-02-12,280521,Sjors,What can I add to all the previous positive reviews? The first AirBnB I've stayed at which actually provides that which the second B stands for: great breakfast. I also enjoyed the hike with Betty and her friends.
1561256,10458057,2014-02-19,8995430,Mohaned,"My stay at Betty's house was wonderful .. I know that I will not look further when I plan my next visit to Seattle..
Thank Betty for your kindness and generosity :)   "
1561256,12911938,2014-05-13,3929249,Keith,"Betty gave us a wonderful Airbnb experience at her clean, lovely and warm home. She was generous with her time, conversation and offerings and is an interesting and kind person. The house is well-located, convenient and quiet."
1561256,12965007,2014-05-15,10901664,Adam,Betty was amazing! She is so nice and fun. She even walked around Green Lake with me pointing out all the shops. The home was clean and well kept. Breakfast was delicious! Absolutely no issues. I would stay here again!
1561256,13823531,2014-06-05,15180041,Charlotte,"Betty's house is very peaceful and welcoming. It's also located in a great location, close to the Interstate and downtown bus lines but in a quiet neighborhood within walking distance of Green Lake. I recommend it!"
1561256,14807243,2014-06-26,17099058,Nathan Feng,I had a very nice experience at Betty's house. She is a detail-oriented host. She's flexible about check-in and out. I love the brief conversation with her and her son as well as the breakfast she cooked. Thank you Betty!

Simple process for coming and going. I am sorry that I wasn't able to get breakfast because of our hectic schedule, but maybe next time!"
1561256,17082219,2014-08-06,19005678,Jonathan,"Betty arranged to allow me into the house, as I arrived when she was not home. The house is on a beautiful, quiet cul de sac. The semi-private room turned out to be very private, as I was out for most of the day and no one even used the adjoining living room while I was there. Betty's breakfast was really above and beyond the call of duty. Thank you so much!"
1561256,17254453,2014-08-09,15102362,Luis,I absolutely felt 100% welcomed. The listing was very accurate and I really enjoyed the neighborhood because the residency was very close to the Downtown Seattle and University of Washington!
1561256,17317968,2014-08-10,19306790,Lauren,We only spent 1 night at Bettys house but she made us feel very welcome and helped us find a restaurant in the area! The breakfast was great and I would recommend staying at her home! There is a little patio off the side of the sleeping area that is really nice!
1561256,17648788,2014-08-15,19385425,Jim,"Great location and we felt very welcome by Betty and her son.  The bed was nice. We were not there a lot but felt at home when we were. 

One word of caution if you are not a morning person or can't sleep when it is light the almost private room can be quite bright early in the morning (summer months). It was not a problem for us as we were up and gone early most days.

If my daughter stays where she is at I will for sure stay with Betty again. "
1561256,18563375,2014-08-28,18440244,Mike,Betty has been wonderful. We stayed over for 5 days and she made breakfast for us every morning. Every breakfasts were different and made using healthier choice. She also introduced us to wheat-grass shots and how we can make it ourselves. The house is clean and homely. 
1561256,18808834,2014-09-01,18659542,Kevin,"The description was very accurate; it's a nice house in a very clean, safe, quiet neighborhood just a few minutes north of downtown Seattle. Betty was extremely accommodating and made sure we had everything we would need. She had no issue with us returning late in the night after the Bumbershoot festival or a beach trip. Her homemade breakfast was a very inviting touch. This was a great (first) AirBNB experience."
1561256,19167177,2014-09-07,18381567,Tobias,It was a really nice stay. The room is nice and the breakfast was amazing. Definitely recommended

We did not see her very much but when we did she was always welcoming and helpful with tips of getting around the city. The room was really cozy and the bed was comfortable. The neighborhood was quiet. I recommend a stay with Betty and her son. 
1561256,20036775,2014-09-22,4130472,Valerie,"My stay at Betty was delightful. She is a great host, made me feel comfortable, making sure I had what I needed. Delicious breakfast in the morning, beautiful house, description is totally accurate, she was respectful of my privacy and willing to communicate. The neighborhood is great, feel safe at night, lot of buses for downtown, very close to Green lake. Five stars ! "
1561256,20383558,2014-09-28,15373777,Lianzhi,"       Betty 人很好，她和她的儿子Franky都很友善。虽然是合住房间，但是一切都很安静、自如。
       早餐食物很健康，Betty是营养健康专家，她懂得食物的合理搭配。
       卫生间干净、整洁，洗衣机、干衣机很好用。
      总之，给我们的印象很好。"
1561256,20726271,2014-10-04,12909120,Ayobami,"The house was great, exactly as advertised and pretty charming. The little details like glittering rocks arranged on the stairs or the boss cat (Felix) make the place feel homely. And Betty's breakfasts are DA bomb. In conclusion, my stay was marvelous, and  I'd repeat again in a heartbeat."
1561256,21057606,2014-10-10,18565566,Caroline,"Betty was my first experience to stay private. I felt comfortable and well from the beginning because Betty is very friendly and helpful. I loved her food, it was very good and healthy! She also took her time to talk with me. I had a great stay and would definitely choose Betty again. "

1561256,21553627,2014-10-19,22335958,David,"Fantastic, fantastic place to be. I stayed with Betty during my first trip to Seattle, and I enjoyed every second of it. What was amazing was that, from the moment I walked in, I felt like I was at a home away from home. That's a huge testament to Betty and the environment she creates. If you want to be social, great! Betty and her family are incredibly easy to talk to. If you want to be left alone, that's great too-- they do a wonderful job of respecting privacy. The ""Almost Private"" part of this listing is an understatement. 

Again, great experience. Highly recommend for anyone looking for a place to stay. "
1561256,21817579,2014-10-24,13667548,Candace,"Thank you Betty for such a warm and welcoming home in Seattle.  I appreciate that you allowed for my Golden Doodle to stay too:)

Betty was away on a trip but was very kind to have provided us with sausage, bacon and eggs and a huge kitchen to prepare our breakfast. No problem with parking our car. Enjoyed our stay and would recommend this place to our friends. Thanks, Betty!"
1561256,28551744,2015-03-25,27367615,Tiina,"Betty was so nice to accept my request on short notice, and she communicated fast, answering all my questions about the area. She was so relaxed about my check-in time, even though I kept taking side trips (to explore more of Seattle area) delaying my arrival.

When I arrived, Betty showed me the room, and it was perfect! I loved the little touches, plus the french doors, fresh air, and an awesome deck with a view of the darling neighborhood. Betty showed me how easy it was to walk around and get to shops, restaurants and Fred Meyers!

In the morning, I had my first taste of Chia porridge - delicious! - and fresh wheat grass juice! Betty was an attentive hostess, but I was also able to have my privacy and enjoy the calm, gray, rainy weather  of Seattle (that I love!) from a mini-oasis. A great way to end my vacation.
"
1561256,28691803,2015-03-28,28841343,Jeff,"Betty was an excellent host. She balanced the professional and personal. She was accommodating and inviting much the way air B and B envisioned. Betty's son Frankie mirrored his mother's hospitality. 
"
1561256,31808307,2015-05-10,1392115,Robert,Our third stay at this outstanding airbnb location.  This must be one of the best in Seattle.  We are always greeted warmly.  Breakfasts were absolutely spectacular!   A+   Host is flexible and considerate of her guests.
1561256,32650179,2015-05-19,1243363,Daniel,"Even more beautiful and welcoming than this lovely home, are the wonderful hosts Betty and Franky. I am so grateful for being able to stay at Betty's place. Their home is beautiful, clean, and full of natural light. Betty's home is in nestled in a great neighborhood that is close to the highway. Her home is also close a challenging disc golf course, Green Lake, and great yoga studios. Every morning you'll be served a delicious home cooked meal. You'll be glad that you chose to stay here.  "
1561256,33204450,2015-05-25,33840418,Briana,"I give her 5-Stars! Amazing time here. Me and my boyfriend have been looking for a permanent place to live, and decided to book with Betty until we found one. Her home was lovely and the breakfast she cooked for us in the morning was exceptional! I definitely miss this place and I would HIGLY recommend you to book with her! You won't regret it :) Very clean, nice neighborhood and close to many fun things! Book now! :) "
1561256,34361844,2015-06-07,7242811,Peter,"This was a very pleasant, sunny, clean room. Betty was very kind and helpful, and even tidied up my room one day! I wish my schedule would have allowed me to partake of her famous breakfasts during my brief stay ..."
1561256,34819324,2015-06-12,2402240,Steve,"Betty's place was convenient and comfortable for our stay in Seattle. We didn't get to meet her because she was out of town, but judging by her quick and helpful responses to our questions, I'm sure she's an excellent host in person!"
1561256,35400549,2015-06-18,33128043,Elton,"My parents lived at Betty's Home. It was their first time in Seattle. Betty's home is just breathtaking, everything in order and found. In fact my parents wished they could live here forever. Connectivity to places in Seattle are also close by with easy access to grocery stores for purchases. I highly recommend Betty's home for any future visitor to Seattle more particularly first time visitors. "
1561256,35699698,2015-06-21,34613098,Jia,"Betty and her son are very nice people, betty is good at cooking. we live there for three days, and have good time there. The house is clean and is near bus station and it's conveniently to go to the Mecy's and the lake area. Seattle  is a beatiful place and we hope to get there next time. Wish a good luck to Betty and her son! Hoping you come to China!"
1561256,36157948,2015-06-25,18008032,Adam,Betty was very friendly and welcoming.  We had a great stay.  
1561256,36467164,2015-06-28,43583,Carina,Betty was a wonderful welcoming host and accomodated to every wish. She served delicious breakfast and was super friendly. The room was nice and clean in a quiet neighborhood. It just took 15 minutes to get to the city center. We really enjoyed our stay with Betty in Seattle! Thank you :)
1561256,38141292,2015-07-13,23674158,Gary,Quiet neighborhood and by car close to everything I needed.  I indeed had a sunny room with my own deck.  All way perfect.  Betty is the perfect hostess. 
1561256,39984754,2015-07-27,36000642,Ariel,"This is my first time of Airbnb as well as The US trip. I feel so lucky that I have reserved Betty's house, which is clean,quite, making me feel like home. Betty is a pretty kind and considerate lady. She asks me to have breakfast together and gives me many kind suggestions for my trip. The days here will be my warmest memory in Seattle. I wish I could live here again when I come to this city  next time!"
1561256,40676780,2015-08-01,36000642,Ariel,Betty is so nice and hospitable. It's a nice experience living here. 
1561256,41636908,2015-08-08,6532581,Finbar,"I had a great stay at Betty's large, clean and inviting home. The room with it's private upstairs deck was very nice. Breakfast every morning was always good, and welcomed."
1561256,42322263,2015-08-12,3306459,Rohit,The place was great. Betty was really helpful. There was a balcony which is a really good place to work or relax. The bed (futon) is very comfortable. The neighbourhood is quiet.  The breakfast Betty cooked for us were amazing. There is the E-line bus 10 min walk away. It is a fast and convenient way to get to downtown.  
1561256,44310411,2015-08-25,15606071,Harry,"My wife and I just spent 2 weeks in Betty's lovely home while visiting our son, daughter in law and grandchildren. She is a great host and wonderful cook as well. You will not find a better home cooked breakfast anywhere! (7 days per week). The listing and pictures provided could not be more on point. We have spent time at several other AirBnB locations in the past and Betty's place is at the top of the list. Good location near Green Lake, bus lines, Univ of Washington and convenient to downtown. Hopefully we can stay with Betty and her son for future visits. Harry & Bobbye"
1561256,44829770,2015-08-29,24233606,Jill M,"This is my second stay in Betty's home. Betty is warm & gracious. She accommodated my allergy concerns successfully with a different delicious breakfast daily. (I am celiac) The location is convenient to family I visited as well as a short walk to the Urban Bakery for Coffee, a walk on the Greenlake Trail, shopping and a short drive to the zoo. Both rooms are very nice but when it's available, I do prefer the bed to the futon.  Jill"
340706,994697,2012-03-13,1443725,Moritz,We really enjoyed our stay! The aparment is really really nice and has lots of details that makes you feel very comfortable. The conection to downtown is fast and easy. And David and his son were great host:) Highly recommended!
340706,1028412,2012-03-21,236915,Rebecca,"Great stay in Seattle at David and Nancy's charming apartment.
We will be staying with them again on our next trip."
340706,1056320,2012-03-28,1572600,Jackie,"Wow. I can't say enough good things about David's Wallingford apartment.  As described, it is indeed charming... and delightful.  You can tell a lot of thought went into the design and decor of the space. The pictures don't do it justice.  This would be my first pick... hands down... the next time I'm in the Seattle area.  It was the perfect getaway. David and his family were very warm and welcoming.  I'll definitely be back.  Thanks David!"
340706,1060031,2012-03-29,554615,Abigael,"We loved our stay in Wallingford! The apartment was very nicely furnished. Particularly, the kitchen had all the equipment one would need to make good food. It seemed like it was put together by someone who actually cooks. We really appreciated the attention to all the little details that make a space charming. Wallingford is a very walkable neighborhood and the apartment is perfectly located to take advantage of all that the area has to offer. My only regret is that we weren't there longer to enjoy it!"
340706,1168898,2012-04-23,1980562,Thomas,"THIS IS A GREAT PLACE IN AN INTERESTING A CLOSE-IN NEIGHBORHOOD. WILL DEFINITELY RECOMMEND IT TO FOLKS!
"
340706,1231706,2012-05-05,565239,Anton,"The place was great. Nice amount of space, great decor and atmosphere, and close to fremont, ballard, wallingford, pretty much everywhere you need to go. The kids can be a tiny bit noisy running around upstairs as you are in the basement, but overall, a great place to stay."
340706,1266898,2012-05-12,2121083,Laura,"We had a great stay at Davids apartment. It is a bright, clean, well layed out space with plenty of room for our family of 3. The location was close to parks and amenities. We would love to have a chance to stay there again on our next visit to beautiful Seattle."
340706,1344563,2012-05-25,1846945,Alvin,"My girlfriend and I stayed at David's for 2 Weeks and have no complaints. The location was great!! Walking distance to gasworks, 5 min drive into Fremont, a bus stop away to downtown, and short drive to greenlake.

The living space was clean and large enough for the both of us and our four legged friend (family dog - Koshee) the kitchen was fully stocked which allowed us to enjoy home cooked dinner as well as baked goods. 

I would definitely stay w David and his family again. They were great host and even offered me a ride to the bus stop when they saw me walking one morning.

"
340706,1381407,2012-05-30,1866109,Serica,Family was very nice!!  I loved the apartment.  It was exactly what it said it would be.  I was super happy with our stay and it was kind of hard to leave.  If I ever do get a chance to visit Seattle soon I know I will be checking availability here first!!!
340706,1409993,2012-06-04,2038335,Lisa,"The apartment was lovely, bright and perfect for our 4 day trip to (email hidden)e proximity to many of Seattle's attractions was convenient and the neightborhood was lovely.  We were also granted use of the homes large deck with a nice view of the Seattle sky line.   If has a full kitchen which helped save money by being able to cook rather than eat out all of the time.  Apple TV and WIFi was also available.  Great place!"
340706,1431848,2012-06-07,2067575,Daryn,"Staying at David's place was probably the best part of our trip to Seattle. It gave us a place to hang out and to call ""home"" while being away from home. 

My husband and I loved the kitchen because it was so ready for real home-cooking (and cleaning too!). David was very generous in letting us use everything in the kitchen.

My cousin and friend stayed in the room with the real bed and they really enjoyed that. My husband and I on the other hand took the sofa bed. It was a good size for the two of us but it was a bit soft.

The TV was awesome as it came ready with HDMI cable so in goes my laptop and we could be enjoying youtube videos right in the living room. The lighting was really good too. Sometimes you get that dark, dim feeling in a basement but thanks to the windows and great lighting design, I never felt that. It was a bit colder than usual when we stayed there and we're glad that we had access to the thermostat right on our floor.

We appreciated that David gave us our own private space and he stayed in touch by email and was quick to reply my questions. Some other reviews did mention about the occasional rumble from the floor above - true that but we were all sound sleepers. My husband was also happy that Cloud the cat didn't have access to our floor.

Parking was never an issue on the street and the Wallingford neighbourhood was just as charming as the apartment! There're drugstores, grocery stores, sushi place, gelato shops, all around - never a dull moment!

This is a definite come-back-worthy spot - thanks to David and his family for making it available!"
340706,1490330,2012-06-16,1960417,Hana,"We really enjoyed staying at David's place while we were visiting Seattle for 3 nights. It's very nicely decorated and the house, as well as the street are lovely (there were so many beautiful flowers while we visited). Everything was clean and comfy and we did actually utilize the very well appointed kitchen. There were also toiletries to use in the bathroom as well as laundry detergent and the sheets were all obviously clean. We fit three comfortably, but bear in mind the other bed is a sofa bed so take that for what it's worth... It's near UW and the neighborhood is very nice and lively, with lots of nice shops and restaurants. If you want, you can walk to get coffee, etc., with lots of pretty flowers and houses to look at along the way. It's also a very short drive into downtown, really not a big deal. If you want to kind of have a more ""real"" experience in Seattle, especially if you've done the hotel thing too many times, this would be a great place to stay. "
340706,1505005,2012-06-18,2269740,Rachel,"Wow, this basement apartment is a great deal. If you have things to do in this part of Seattle, I would highly recommend staying here. I was here with my husband, my mom, and my sister. We have family in Seattle, but they don't have the space to accommodate us. We were so glad we ended up in David's air bnb! The apartment is in a great neighborhood, and it's a short walk to the center of Wallingford with plenty of great restaurants and stores. However, the apartment itself is full of everything you could need for a short or longer stay. It has a fully equipped kitchen stocked with all-organic spices, oils, and other pantry staples, and although we were not in town long enough to need to make real meals, I almost wished we could just so I could use the kitchen! In any case, it was great to be able to have some cereal and tea in the morning before heading out. It was a bit inconvenient having 4 people in the space--mainly because there is a single bathroom--but 2 people would be very comfortable in the apartment. The value of this apartment--compared to hotels or nearby traditional B&Bs--is hard to beat. The apartment has a separate entry, so if you're more of the reserved type, less interaction with the hosts could be a plus! In our case, it would have been great to meet David just to say thanks for providing this great apartment, but our schedules just didn't coincide during the short time we were there. However, it is very likely that we will stay here again next time we visit family. "
340706,1528149,2012-06-21,2042366,Andrew,"David and his family were warm and generous! And, their home's location, in proximity to all Seattle has to offer, cannot be beat!

Because my wife and I (and our 20mth old son) were flying from the East coast of Canada to Seattle, we asked David if his apartment had some needed items (ie, a highchair and pack n' play) to make the trip easier on us ... He didn't, but made a special attempt to attain them for us prior to our arrival ... This is not only great service, but stands as a testament to the Saxen Family's character!

In a heartbeat, we would refer others to this home away from home!"
340706,1759171,2012-07-21,1858209,Ilene,"This was our first time using Airbnb so we did not know what to expect.
David's hospitality was superb.  Anytime we had any questions or needed something he responded quickly.  The place was well stocked and cared for.  

I highly recommend staying here.  Great location and great neighborhood within walking distance to many places and a short  drive to downtown.

We hope to return in the future."
340706,1990659,2012-08-15,1972899,April,"I found the place for my parents who were visiting Seattle for 26 days! First, David is an awesome host, very gentle, caring, easy to contact, easy to communicate, etc. Second, it's in the perfect neighborhood. My parents walked to Green lake or Burke-Gilman Trail every morning. QFC is only 10 min away on foot. The place itself is very neat and everything is well prepared for guests. We really loved the choice staying in the Charming Wallingford Apartment! "
340706,2070723,2012-08-23,1971971,Natalie,"David was a wonderful host. All though him and his family were away at the time of our stay, they made sure we had everything we needed for our stay. His place was clean and neat, it has everything you need and more!. We are a family with young children and David shared a wonderful list of things to do with kids around Seattle with us that kept us busy and was a great resource for us. David's place is quite central, so everything felt close by and everything was quite easy to get to.
Thank you for your hospitality!"
340706,2176223,2012-09-03,1670936,Paul,"We enjoyed our 8-night stay.  The basement apartment was comfortable, good location, good bed, and the unit was well-(website hidden) was OK, though probably not on cable.  David was very cordial.  Paul & B,J."
340706,2259516,2012-09-11,1634549,Peter+Cecilia,"David was very nice and welcoming. He explained about the appartment and had even prepared a detailed manual about where to find everything. It has everything you could be looking for even for a longer stay (including washing machine and dryer). The place was very clean and confortable and cosy. 

Also the neighbourhood is very nice and easy to get to.

We had a great stay at the place!"
340706,2847857,2012-11-10,781439,Ex,"We've stayed in David's house for two months and had a great time. It's very clean and cosy place. I'd recommend it to anyone. Thanks, David!"
340706,3013611,2012-12-03,3892016,Pam,"Myself and two girlfriends stayed at David's Wallingford Apartment for the weekend while attending classes in the area.  The accommodations were very comfortable, spacious and well-organized - we appreciated  the full kitchen with all the basic necessities.  We had a minor problem with the fridge and David came down and looked after it as soon as we notified him.  The house is in a beautiful charming older neighbourhood, close to restaurants and shops.  If you like to walk and look at beautiful character homes and gardens, this is the place!  We are planning on staying again when we come back in February."
340706,3153380,2012-12-25,764793,Ric,Great host and an awesome apartment.  We will definitely stay here again when we come back to Seattle.  
340706,3187139,2012-12-30,2207450,Peter,My son and his little family stayed at David's place and  had a very comfortable stay.  He kindly provided a oak and play and high chair. For their 7 month old.   .Location was very good and many good walking areas.  Would recommend to friends
340706,4308500,2013-04-27,2894736,Stephan,"Had a great 2.5 month stay in David and Nancy's basement apartment. The apartment was very well equipped and the few minor issues that popped up were corrected asap. The apartment is very well-separated and secured from the main living upstairs, but our hosts were very accessible any time we needed something.

The apartment is very clean and tidy and has everything you would need, even for an extended stay (washer and dryer!). Excellent kitchen if you like to prepare your own meals. Although a basement apartment, it still has plenty of light and air and we didn't feel cramped at all. Sometimes a daytime/early-evening rumble from their (great,respectful) kids on the floor above, but nothing that ever bothered us. The ceilings are pretty low, so very tall guests could feel a little cramped.

The Wallingford location is fantastic, with more than easy access to buses and bike trails. A short walk to local neighborhood groceries and many restaurants. Super views of Lake Union and downtown from both the street/sidewalk and the large shared deck. Spent several months here commuting to U-District and Bellevue, WA via bike/bus/walk and didn't miss having a car at all.

Overall, highly recommended for short or long stays."
340706,5447971,2013-07-01,5256241,Christine,We were quite happy with David's Wallingford apartment.  The location is great and the apartment is comfortable. The kitchen is very well equipped which makes this apartment ideal for an extended stay.  We would definitely stay here again.  Chris and Jim
340706,6144141,2013-08-01,3293706,Dennis,"David and his family were wonderful hosts.  The apartment is stocked with everything you need.  The location is great and we found it easy to utilize public transportation to go downtown or various parts of Seattle.  You are also in walking distance of Wallingford, Fremont, U of W districts.  Gas Works Park and Green Lake are also nearby and fun to explore. It is only six blocks to 45th Street where there is a nice shopping area with a QFC grocery store, restaurants, bars, ice creams stores, movie theaters, etc."
340706,6778972,2013-08-25,6575586,Walter,David and partner were great in planning our trip - and all went perfectly when there!!
340706,6869296,2013-08-28,2148373,Thurston,A wonderfully designed little apartment in a great neighborhood! We enjoyed our stay.
340706,7032948,2013-09-04,4312756,Jose Pablo,"Great place, super clean, easy to get to and from using public trasportation.

Loved that all the cleaning products in the house where biodegradable and/or organic, loved that they had a compost bin, loved the tomatoes in the back yard and the chickens and the neigborgs grapes (*cof*cof*yes I took a couple, in my defense they were on David's side of the fence)

 The instructions for the washing machine were pretty awesome (I won't give spoilers, you'll see if you rent their place) but it was even more tempting to start pushing all the funky buttons.

We didn't get to meet David but he would always reply to my emails promptly.

Highly recommended.*****"
340706,7246578,2013-09-13,1021598,Charles,The accommodations were excellent and the apartment was clean and well equipped. We enjoyed our stay in David's apartment
340706,7366291,2013-09-17,7765630,Jen,"My parents stayed in the apartment and gave the following review:
""The apartment was great, well organized and nicely decorated.  Having a full kitchen was nice even though we didn't take full advantage of it.  Parking on the street was never a problem and there was a comprehensive info packet regarding the apt and local area.  The only downside was that if you are there on the weekend, one of their sons was pretty noisy running around for extended periods of time.   Hard to take a nap which we desperately needed at the time.  I would still highly recommend David's home, it was overall perfect for us."""
340706,7423588,2013-09-19,4307329,Brian,"Nice basement apartment in a great neighborhood. Hosts were very nice and lent us bicycles one day. Footsteps in the main home upstairs start early, but that's a homey touch, and soundproofing is good.  "
340706,7514167,2013-09-23,6152611,Lisa,"My husband and I stayed in David’s apartment for two nights and wished we could have stayed longer!  The apartment is fantastic and has everything you need, a lovely well equipped kitchen, a very comfortable bed and living area, and plenty of storage space.  The location is also great, we didn't use our car once during our stay, preferring to walk to all the different neighborhoods the area has to offer!  David was a wonderful host, very accommodating and accessible, and we would definitely stay here again! "
340706,7842912,2013-10-05,6199024,Jessica,"Traveling with a two month old baby is a challenge...let alone finding a place to stay. I didn't lock in accommodation for us (two adults and a baby) until the day that we were driving off to Seattle! 

David was really quick to response to my last minute booking. His place has a real bed and a sofa sleeper.  I decided to sleep on the sofa sleeper with the two month old baby and let my mom take the main bedroom. The sofa sleeper was firm hence, it wasn't a problem to sleep with the baby on it.  In fact, we slept in most mornings.  The host has a pack-n-play and high chair but we didn't need to use it.

Parking was really easy.  We parked outside the house every night that we were there.  The only thing that I would point out is that there are a flight of steps to get to the house and when you enter the apartment (in law), it is a short flight of steps down in the apartment.  It is a reason for me to work out carrying the baby in the car seat climbing the stairs but not great for older folks. 

David is a great host and I will recommend his place for the great price and location. Thanks!"
340706,8150257,2013-10-18,8346627,Jim,"David's apartment was fantastic. It was the perfect place to stay with our 1 year old daughter on our trip to Seattle. The place was very nice and very clean and stocked with amenities. Their neighborhood is also wonderful, one block from several buses and a short walk to numerous parks, cafes, etc...

David was also kind enough to lend us a pack n' play and a high chair for our daughter to use. This made our trip so much easier.

If you are coming to Seattle and need a great place to stay this is it!"
340706,8257081,2013-10-22,216539,Capri,"This space was great! Home away from home. You have more amenities than a hotel room offers (full kitchen, utensils, washer/dryer, Apple TV, Netflix, bathroom floor heater) and in a beautiful neighborhood but for a good deal cheaper. The only thing you need to consider is the fact that you are staying downstairs from a family living their day to day life, because you can definitely hear foot steps especially if the kids run around, which can be pretty loud. So just keep that in mind. David was great with communication before and during. We never crossed paths so we didn't officially meet but he was always helpful. We didn't have a car but we made it work with the buses, which was nearby. Just familiarize yourself with king county metro website (trip planner). Seattles food is amazing! Just a side not: book a tour with Savor Seattle Food Tour!!! Highlight of the trip. "
340706,8312769,2013-10-25,4768758,Melanie,"The Wallingford apartment was a wonderfully, clean, convenient and private location, with-in walking distance to stores, eateries etc.  The furnishings were very comfortable, kitchen nicely supplied with cooking utensils and tea.  The location does require climbing up a flight of stairs to the apartment, but is well lit and access into the apartment was very easy.  I enjoyed my stay very much and would rent it again without hesitation."
340706,8416314,2013-10-29,9405184,Scott,"David's home was the perfect spot for our weekend getaway; very clean and organized with all the amenities of a hotel and more. Such a quaint little neighborhood and close to bus stops for downtown, I would highly recommend it!"
340706,8531204,2013-11-04,9272053,Sarah,"My boyfriend and I stayed here for 3 nights and we loved it! The apartment is in a great neighborhood and is close to restaurants, bars, and grocery stores, all very walkable too! The apartment itself is well-equipped, comfortable, and accommodating. I loved the kitchen! My only suggestion would be to bring ear plugs if you like to sleep in. The noise didn't really bother us and was never an issue when we were going to bed, but just note that is a basement apartment, so there is some noise/footsteps coming from above. Would highly recommend this apartment! Will be staying here again in the future. "
340706,8698892,2013-11-12,9603202,Amy,The apartment was lovely with a beautiful view of Seattle in a peaceful neighborhood. It's walking distance to numerous restaurants and bus stops. David was friendly and responded quickly. We'd be happy to stay here again. 
340706,8732214,2013-11-14,8371110,Rich,"I had a wonderful stay at David's apartment.  It is a large space with generous amenities.   David has a clever combination lock system for maintaining security of the unit which is easy to use.  
The full kitchen was more than I needed, and the multiple thermostats controlling the heaters allowed comfort in all rooms.
I was only in the unit for about 4 hours of ""awake time"" over my 2 day stay, but I was very relaxed the entire time.   
I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again if the occasion arises."
340706,8841810,2013-11-20,790453,Tracy,"This is a spacious apartment in the heart, I mean, heart of Wallingford - one of the most walkable (restaurants, bars, movies, pharmacy, grocery) neighborhoods in all of Seattle. Very nicely furnished, warm and welcoming. David responded really quickly and was super friendly and easy to deal with. We give David and this cute spacious apartment five stars. "
340706,8879873,2013-11-23,3872760,Tony,Great deal.. Beats any hotel pricing in the seat and has all the amenities of a home. Private key code entry way on side of home. Plenty of privacy.. Would stay again
340706,11123612,2014-03-22,13391779,Suzanne,The reservation was canceled 62 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
340706,14462361,2014-06-20,5989503,Kathleen R,My experience with David was fine.  Everything was as it was advertised.  The neighborhood was quiet and beautiful.
340706,14594501,2014-06-23,11663288,Chris,"We absolutely loved this apt!  Location is amazing, walking distance to restaurants/shops (and we aren't usually walkers....)  The space was very well finished, comfortable bed, tons of light from windows even though in the basement.  We will recommend and would definitely stay there again."
340706,14830412,2014-06-27,5215714,Nasya,"My partner and I absolutely loved staying at this apartment!  It was spacious, tidy and modernly (but warmly) outfitted, and very well accommodated (e.g., washer-dryer unit; fully equipped kitchen).  The location was also great, as there were buses, stores and great views of the city all within walking distance. I would definitely stay here again!"
340706,16699980,2014-08-01,6753914,Jeffrey,We had a wonderful time at David's place. The apartment was very nice and very light for a basement apartment. Everything was ready to go when we checked in and David was very responsive and helpful throughout our stay. We stayed for a month with our young son and had a great time in the neighborhood walking up to 45th and down to Gas Works park for the 4th of July. We definitely would go back. 
340706,17059144,2014-08-06,17779248,Ben,"Great place, great location.  Apartment has everything you need and nothing you don't.  Close to transportation, a few blocks to a truly fantastic bike trail.  Although David happened to be out of town during our stay, he made sure we were well taken care of.  We enjoyed our stay immensely.   Thanks again."
340706,17365777,2014-08-11,17783555,John,"This could not have been a better choice for our stay in Seattle!!! The location is ideal, just southwest of the university and northeast of Queen Anne, you can easily get within several parts of the city and have access equally to the 99 and the 5.  The apartment was very tidy, warm and inviting, cozy, and was very well lit for a basement. LOTS of natural light pouring in! Full bedroom, living room, kitchen, laundry, everything you could need in a rental and nothing I didn't. I would highly recommend David & Nancy to anyone looking for a fun stay in Seattle. The ease of the whole experience was in no small part to the hosts. They made this completely seamless and worry free!"
340706,18301868,2014-08-25,1990053,Dean,"Wonderful stay.  Hosts were very organized and informative.  Great neighborhood.  Very relaxed.   Apartment is extremely clean, well furnished, modern and comfortable.   Lots of amenities -- washer dryer, children's high chair and pack and play, books, television with netflix and apple tv........   There are some steps up to the front of the house and then steps down into the apartment for those who are elderly or avoid stairs."
340706,18623823,2014-08-29,18018739,Grace,"The location is great; very close to downtown but tucked away in the quiet suburbs.  

Street parking was no problem and we were able to park right in front each night. There is also a washer and dryer which was great so we didn't come home with dirty laundry. All in all, it was a wonderful stay and truly felt like ""home"" with the amenities, comfort, and privacy. Thank you!"
340706,19072212,2014-09-06,16401283,Faith,"We loved our stay in the Charming Wallingford Apartment! Everything was exactly as presented from the pictures - clean, cozy and practical. The location was quiet yet close enough to the interstate making it easy to get around as well as a great central location walkable to many different amenities. David made himself completely available to us if we needed anything, but gave us complete privacy. We would definitely stay there again!"
340706,19518417,2014-09-14,6780617,Hannah,"Awesome place to stay. Close to everything Seattle has to offer. Wonderful neighborhood to walk in and explore. A fantastic Bakery around the corner and a park down the street (Gas Works Park) great for running and watching the sunrise over the Seattle Skyline. The apartment had everything we needed. Great kitchen, living space. The only word of advice for anyone staying here, you are very aware you are staying in someones basement (noise from upstairs) but since we were not there except at night, it did not bother us at all. Great place, would definitely stay there again!"
340706,20179864,2014-09-25,2883450,Garry,"David was a wonderful host and the accommodations were very clean, comfortable and exactly as listed.  We got into Seattle very late at night and David made it very easy for us to get access to his place with a security code and not having to disturb anyone late at night.  The location is very convenient with easy access to the freeway and very short trip to downtown.  We had everything we needed to make our stay comfortable, and cozy.  We were not disappointed and would stay again if available.  "
340706,20330605,2014-09-28,1592768,Lindsay,"This was easy and convenient. We were in town for some friends wedding and wanted to make a long weekend if it. We love Seattle but had yet been to the Walljngford area, which is also where the wedding was. While we enjoyed some of our favorite places in the surrounding area, we also fell in love with Wallingford.
The apartment is comfortable and we had all we needed and more!"
340706,20704440,2014-10-04,9187764,David,"Great house, great location!   We always found parking which is almost impossible a few blocks away the house. Great hosts!! A few blocks away from Freemont's Brewery.  I'll definitely stay there again!"
340706,21871591,2014-10-26,15151080,Tim,"Great neighbourhood, great host, even better place! This was a great experience! The pictures don't do it justice, doesn't show the great new couch! Green, and clean! Would definitely stay here again!
Thanks David"
340706,22070563,2014-10-29,6511810,Kim,"We were easily able to connect with our host through email. David sent an access code to use to enter the unit as we never met face to face. The apartment was very roomy and had a lot of natural light from its many windows. It did not feel like a basement! We were very comfortable. Everything felt so fresh and new! 
The neighborhood was wonderful and felt very safe. Street parking was easy, and we enjoyed walking to Irwyn's coffee house around the corner for morning bagels.
We will definitely stay here again!"
340706,24130739,2014-12-21,16916768,Matt,"I spent seven weeks staying in David's apartment without issues or complaints.  The apartment is immaculately maintained and well stocked for cooks and readers, and the neighborhood is very pleasant.    David and his family were courteous and didn't intrude.  I would absolutely stay again given the chance.  "
340706,25802884,2015-01-26,15878560,Alison,"This is a great little apartment for a long or short-term stay; it had everything we needed to feel comfortable and in such a great area of Seattle.  The price was reasonable, we would easily stay here again!"
340706,26061700,2015-02-02,8937121,Jim,"The lovely apartment was just as pictured.  It is in a nice neighborhood with plenty of walkability and shops nearby.  The kitchen is well appointed and the furnishings throughout are new, comfortable and tasteful.  Three of us stayed comfortably here and would definitely visit again.  "
340706,26191931,2015-02-06,5200857,Besim,"David was very attentive, and quick to communicate (both prior to arrival, and during). He anticipated needs prior to my arrival (which was very helpful, including arrival time).
He was always polite and respectful.
The flat was also wonderful and as advertised, clean, very close to metro to get to downtown. Wallingford had many restaurants and shops worth seeing, and Fremont and University City nearby.
Cozy during the rain, too. "
340706,26262436,2015-02-08,7556074,Jessie,"This Wallingford suite is charming! We had a fantastic stay in this lovely neighbourhood. The suite is accurately described by David. It is really clean, furnished nicely, fully equipped kitchen, washer/dryer and lots of great books to read. This would be a fantastic place for short or long term stay. Also walking distance to some great restaurants, shops both in Wallingford and Freemont. No problem parking on the street and it’s free, instead of $30-$60 a night in downtown Seattle. Check in was efficient and David was attentive to any questions we had. You can even borrow some bikes to take advantage of the trail that runs along the water with fantastic views of the city and to some tasty breweries!  I would definitely stay here again."
340706,27285105,2015-03-01,27711563,Katy,"David and Nancy were very nice. I met them outside while they were playing with their boys- were super accommodating getting me set up with a bike for the morning! The apartment was very comfy and exactly what I needed for the weekend! Neighborhood is perfect, safe, and so convenient to UW, Wallingford shops and restaurants, and the Burke Gilman trail. "
340706,27645243,2015-03-09,6041543,Sarah,"The basement apartment was clean, comfortable, roomy and had everything we needed. The towels were particularly fluffy. I would stay again. It would be a great place to stay for a longer time. "
340706,27881662,2015-03-14,13446721,Heather,Super cute and clean little hide away.  Very close UofW and downtown.  We would totally stay here again.
340706,28127687,2015-03-18,2232356,Mark,"Great apartment, perfect location in Wallingford. Walking distance to a million restaurants, bars, etc in Wallingford, Fremont, and near UW.  David was a great host and very helpful. Apt was spacious for two, but you could do four using the fold out bed. Lots of books, plenty of cooking equipment."
340706,28466829,2015-03-24,18891463,Eric,"We enjoyed staying at David's place in Wallingford. 

The pictures offered are quite accurate as representations of what the space looks like. 

David himself was very punctual in responding to emails and letting us know where things were, how to access the apartment, and what materials would be inside. 

Great host, great apartment, and terrific neighborhood!"
340706,29040338,2015-04-03,11664155,Dianne,"""Charming Wallingford Apartment"" is indeed charming.  The apartment is extremely comfortable, clean and well...charming.  The location is convenient to all busses. A great grocery store is very close and laundry can be done on site.  Irwin's is a fantastic coffee shop a two minute walk away. Gas Works Park in at the end of the street. David is kind, professional, and willing to do more than his part to ensure a lovely visit.   It is a wonderful place to stay. Highly, completely endorsed. "
340706,29286791,2015-04-06,13646102,Ellen,"My son and his dad went to visit my daughter at UW and the location was perfect.  They loved the place and mentioned the architectural features and the books in particular.  And the kitchen was a big hit too, they enjoyed making Easter dinner there.  Would definetely stay there again.

Ellen"
340706,29962574,2015-04-15,22728640,Kristen,"My family and I really enjoyed staying here.  The property was exactly as described, David was a great communicator and very helpful if we needed anything.  When we arrived the booklet provided, was very informative which assisted us accessing local shops/restaurants/sights.  David and his wife left us a porta-cot (for our son), high chair and linen for the cot - which was unexpected and very appreciated! 

The neighbourhood was lovely, peaceful, easy to get to downtown Seattle and local shops. We enjoyed walking around the streets and getting a coffee around the corner. 

Comfortable bed, heating when needed, everything was lovely. 

We would recommend anyone wanting to stay here. 

Thanks David and family for making our first trip to Seattle a pleasant one! :)"
340706,30200506,2015-04-19,2816894,Katie,The accommodations were perfect for our visit. Super location for our trip to tour the University of Washington. We fell in love with the city and neighborhood. The noise level did get disturbing but David responded quickly and amended the situation immediately. Just note: there are three young boys living right above you. 
340706,30664487,2015-04-26,26430044,Alexandre,"Super logement, great place, exactly as we were looking for !
Merci !"
340706,32120247,2015-05-14,2762776,Jessica,"David's apartment was a lovely place to stay. It is spacious, well appointed, and very neat and organized. With proximity to the UW, Fremont, the Burke-Gilman trail, and the restaurants and shops in Wallingford it is ideally situated. Highly recommended!"
340706,32326244,2015-05-17,3432849,Amanda,"The studio's kitchen is very well organized and well stocked with everything could need. The neighborhood is serene and within close proximity of awesome food, an easy bus ride DT and UW. Just be aware--you are in a family home with 3 boys--it will not be quiet. We didn't mind as we were out most of the day and it was fairly quiet at night. The bed is a little hard and the pillows flat, so I wouldn't recommend this for anyone with a bad back like myself (I had surgery 5 months ago.) Other than being a bit stiff, I was fine to walk around the next morning. Great location!"
340706,32750772,2015-05-21,29648457,Gian,"The place was just as described. Very clean, nice kitchen and amenities in a great neighborhood."
340706,33228787,2015-05-26,20170824,Diane,Wonderful neighbor. Great for walking. David (host) responded quickly to any questions I had.
340706,33642491,2015-05-31,23999582,Leanne,What a great area to stay in.  Grocery shop and restaurants nearby and only a short bus ride into downtown Seattle.  Gasworks park is only a short stroll away.  The apartment was exactly as described and very well kitted out.  I was told the sofa bed also was comfortable.
340706,34291873,2015-06-07,1126594,Betsy,"We thoroughly enjoyed out stay at David's apartment. It was equipped with everything advertised and more, from kitchen equipment, spices, coffee supplies and recycling bins to a good Apple TV service. We liked a keypad system to lock the door. The neighborhood is also perfect: close to the Burke-Gilman trail, the Wallingford business area, freeway access, and easy to get beyond to Fremont or the U. of Washington, but still quiet. We've used Airbnb a number of times, and this was one of our better stays."
340706,34815381,2015-06-12,34769557,Caroline,"David communicated all the details of the apartment before our arrival, the apartment is in a lovely quiet neighborhood which was a few minutes walk to the park, and shopping area. The Bus stop to downtown is also one block away."
340706,36002438,2015-06-24,28964691,Mike,"the unit was just like described and great for a 4 or fewer people (2 on a sleepr sofa) who need a private bathroom and kitchen and washer/dryer units.  Unit was stocked well fro all your needs.  great location for visits to Fremont, Gasworks Park, or U District neighborhoods.  Hosts David and Nancy were very friendly! Highly recommended!"
340706,42653328,2015-08-15,29009789,Paquita,"had a wonderful experience. A cool garden-level apartment during a hot summer. Great hosts, very considerate. The use of a bike was a huge plus. Wonderful neighborhood. I would definitely stay here again."
340706,44300295,2015-08-25,17968286,Alice,"My husband and I came to Seattle for the first time to visit our son who was here for the summer.
This was also our first airbnb experience. The stay at Dave’s place was everything we had hoped it would be. Dave’s airbnb is exactly as it is represented in context and pictures. It was clean, well lit, comfortable and convenient. The kitchen was very well stocked with quality pans, dishes, sharp knives, spices, teas, and everything you would need to fix your own meals. A quaint and delicious neighborhood coffee shop (Irwins) was just around the corner. Dave’s place was one block from the bus route, 4-5 blocks from downtown Wallingford with a great grocery (QFC), gelato shop (Fainting Goat) and restaurants. We even discovered the best foreign auto mechanic (Pacific Rim Automotive) 4 blocks away to fix our son’s car. We could see downtown Seattle from the deck and walk to Gas Works Park for an even better view. Dave offered bikes, helmets and locks, but after seeing the hills we might have to ride up to get home, thought better of it. It was a short hop to Fremont, Ballard and UW. Some reviewers mentioned noise from Dave’s busy family upstairs. We never were bothered by footsteps, vocal noise, TV or music from above. The whole neighborhood was exceptionally quiet. We also never had to search for a place to park, however we could have gone almost anywhere from Dave’s without a car. I really felt at home here. One of my favorite parts of the stay was being able to take my scraps to a compost bin or to feed the beautiful chickens housed in the back yard instead of throwing it all in the garbage to be hauled off to some landfill. We will be back someday and we would be very disappointed if we couldn’t stay here.
"
340706,45075501,2015-08-31,12867025,Stuart,"Classic 1 bedroom basement apartment with private entrance. On street parking with good availability. Vintage Ikea decor, good kitchen and comfortable and clean. Very personable host introduced the setting upon arrival. Downtown location near U of Wash. Can get around without using I-5."
340706,45561713,2015-09-04,29222933,Erin,"We spent 2 nights here and it was a perfect space for us (2 adults and 2 kids). The apartment was very clean, well lit and well stocked with everything from laundry detergent to spices.  We really appreciated the great collection of books, especially the children's books;  after a week of traveling our kids were ready for some new bedtime stories.  David was very easy to communicate with and  having a code for the lock made getting in hassle free. Location was great for getting around the city and checking out local sites. There was a great playground up the street that the kids enjoyed and, as others mentioned, Gas Works park is right down the street and not to be missed.   

Wish we could have stayed longer!"
340706,47186785,2015-09-16,6381508,Patrick,"The apartment is in a residential area not far from the University of Seattle. It is nicely furnished and clean. 

David was an excellent host. He provided me with a bike that I could use during my stay. I would love to stay here again during future Seattle travel! 

"
340706,47395557,2015-09-18,42800374,James,"We had only a short stay here, and we were sorry it couldn't be longer.  This is a comfortable suite, and we appreciated the walkability to eating, shopping and attractions in the Wallingford, Fremont and Green Lake neighborhoods.  We're a small family, and this was perfect for us."
340706,49522897,2015-10-04,3662113,Alex,As pictured and described. David was very accommodating and had great communication. The location was good with lots of amenities within walking distance. Clean and spacious with good light for a partially below grade unit. If you are very tall the ceilings might feel a tad low. Did not find the unit noisy. Would definitely stay again.
340706,50982246,2015-10-16,5658985,Michael,We had a great stay at David's apartment. Check in was flawless. The accommodations were as advertised and the location was convenient.
340706,51751215,2015-10-24,9902870,Greta,"My mom and I stayed with David for the duration of our week long vacation in Seattle.  We could not have had a better experience.  The apartment is beautiful, well maintained, true to the pictures, and made us feel right at home.  Despite it being a basement apartment, we were able to enjoy quite a bit of natural light in the living room portion of the apartment.  We loved the neighborhood, it was a quick 10 minute drive to downtown, but still felt peaceful, safe, and somewhat removed from the city (nice for morning/evening walks and bike rides).  We loved exploring the nearby business and the close vicinity to Gasworks Park (which has the best view of the skyline!) and a great waterfront bike path.  David also was able to provide us with bikes to borrow for the week which was wonderful and saved us from having to rent them.   He was a great host and was able to answer all of our questions (which weren't many thanks to his very helpful and detailed welcome packet).  Check in and check out could not have been easier.  Overall we had an amazing stay and wished we didn't have to leave! "
340706,53821740,2015-11-13,12128757,Christopher,"David was easy to work with and the place was perfect for our 2 week stay. The inclusion of spices, oils, etc for cooking were very much appreciated. I would highly recommend."
340706,54124527,2015-11-16,8871521,Serina,"The space was spotless, cozy and welcoming. The neighborhood is really cute and charming. David is quick to respond to any questions, and my boyfriend and I loved our stay here."
340706,54551449,2015-11-21,35925515,Halloran,"I had a very nice stay at David's while I was in Seattle for work. The apartment is very cute, exactly as pictured. David was great about communicating and check in/out was extremely easy. Wallingford is a great location with grocery stores and great food nearby in Fremont. Parking at the house is ample and free. "
340706,55757153,2015-12-05,5621919,Shanna,"David's basement apartment was very comfortable and well furnished. Everything you needed from extra linens, towels, to kitchen appliances and cookware - you are covered! There is even a washer/dryer available in the apartment. Its location in the Wallingford area is fantastic - very centrally located and close to great restaurants and things to do. I would absolutely stay here again!  "
340706,56066895,2015-12-08,15157739,Kelly,My brother and I had an awesome time at David's. It really felt like home.  He really thought about everything. The kitchen was well equipped and came in handy for breakfast.  The space was great with lots of lighting.  I would definitely stay here again. 
340706,56533687,2015-12-14,2830624,Bill,David was thoughtful and provided good information in advance of our trip.  Locating the apartment and accessing the unit was easy.  This apartment is in a nice Seattle neighborhood and street parking was easy and available.
1602488,7764441,2013-10-01,1872896,John,"Wanted to make sure that I wrote a review for these two wonderful hosts to let any other AirBnB users who are visiting Seattle that this is an A+.  We did have an advantage of having a car this trip but location still is central to bus lines and popular Fremont district.  Probably 10 min drive/busride to downtown with traffic.  The comfort, cleanness, privacy and amenities were all that one would hope for! Not to mention the homemade muffins in the morning and cookies at night made it feel like you were at a friend's or family's house. Enjoy!"
1602488,7866356,2013-10-06,4061986,April,Finding Sara's house was easy.  Parking available right out front.  The rooms were nicely appointed and very clean.  It was the perfect arrangement for my friend and I (who drove from the San Juan Islands) to go out on the town and have a great night.  We will be sure to use Sara's home again.
1602488,7939025,2013-10-08,1134168,Vicki,"We enjoyed a lovely visit with Sara, she is a warm and friendly host. Our room was clean, quiet, private, and spacious. The bed was extra comfortable with very nice linens-love that!   Our stay was brief and we wish we could have chatted longer.  We hope we can stay again in the future.  "
1602488,8067739,2013-10-14,9173442,Jenny,"My friend and me had an incredible trip in Seattle and Sara's place. They provided 2 bedrooms and a private bathroom, which are clean and comfortable. Moreover, It's easy to go to downtown by bus. Sara is so nice, she even cooked muffin for us, very delicious. Thank you Sara!"
1602488,8314274,2013-10-25,5316589,Sophie,"Hi.  Sara provides the perfect location and comfort in her Queen Anne lovely home.  The rooms are nicely decorated and the private bath is a nice touch after hiking the surrounding hills.  Centrally located between the fun and funky neighbourhoods of Queen Anne and Fremont, you are within walking distance to great restaurants, pubs, shops and interesting landmarks.  I highly recommend Sara's home if you are passing through Seattle and prefer to avoid the hustle and bustle of the downtown scene.  Thank-you"
1602488,8361202,2013-10-27,9587016,Sina,"The stay at Saras House was awesome. Very clean and a lot of space. The neighbourhood is nice - very close to the sights and the interstate. During the day you don't need a car - you can drive to Downtown in around 15 - 20 Minutes with public transportation. A ticket is between 2.25 (Off-Peak) and 2.50 $ (Peak).
If you want to go to a club or something in the evening a car is very useful ;) You are in Capitol Hill in around 10 - 15 Minutes with a car.
We definitely would/will stay at Saras House again :)"
1602488,8400996,2013-10-28,9333544,Michael,"I cannot say enough good things about our stay. Sara and Jonathan are amazing hosts, and even better people.  Plain and simple. 

They were very warm and welcoming, and we hung out and talked with them because they are super cool.  Helped us plan out our one night in Seattle with great suggestions that were within walking distance.

The basement is completely private with TWO rooms with a bed in each, and a very nice bathroom with a HUGE shower.  Also a big couch and flatscreen TV.  They also have an amazing dog named Emma. 

I HIGHLY RECOMMEND staying at the Queen Anne home if you like nice people and a good value.  JUST DO IT!!!!

"
1602488,8530944,2013-11-04,72521,Jen,"I brought my partner and her godmother up to Seattle to see an Opera.   We wanted to find a place with private bedrooms that was reasonably priced.   Sara's place offers a great deal of privacy, a private bath with a huge tub and great water pressure.  

The best part about our stay was meeting Emma.  She was such a gem.  We really enjoyed her hanging out with us before we headed out to the opera.

We were less than 15 minutes from the Opera House and maybe 5-10 minutes from restaurants.   

We hope to stay again especially since we have season tickets."
1602488,8981348,2013-11-30,9517953,Bijan,"Sara is a wonderful host and, was very (website hidden) the darts were really fun."
1602488,9301851,2013-12-19,1378954,Samantha,Great house.  I didn't have the pleasure of meeting Sara or Carsten but their home was cozy and their dog was very sweet.
1602488,9369738,2013-12-24,2539117,Graham And Vicki,Nice private area in a good neighbourhood of Seattle
1602488,9485215,2013-12-30,7029926,Rod,Carsten and Sara are very kind and cool people.  We had a nice stay.  There are funky and trendy shops and restaurants just a 5 or 10 min. walk away.  It is a comfortable space downstairs with large bedrooms and comfortable beds. 
1602488,10413996,2014-02-17,9730009,Tatiana,"Sara and Cartsen are awesome hosts! They are both very friendly with a very beautiful and quiet dog named Emma. The house is located very close to downtown, with nearby restaurants and a unique neighborhood. We rented out the downstairs rooms and it felt like an entire house to ourselves. I would definitely stay with them again!"
1602488,10445566,2014-02-18,8963446,Brian,"Sara and Carsten were great hosts!  The home is in an excellent location and is very nicely appointed.  We had plenty of room and privacy, and communication and check-in/out were a breeze.  I will likely be using their place again!  "
1602488,10668219,2014-03-02,12399025,Eve,"Sara and Carsten made it really easy for us to stay in their cute Queen Anne house for our conference week in Seattle. The two-bedroom basement space was perfect for three of us - nice bathroom, easy outside access, nice sized rooms and living area where we could hang out together. We only saw a flash of our hosts - they were gone and we were gone and our paths rarely crossed. Next time!"
1602488,10825728,2014-03-09,9967541,Chris,Sara was great!  She was very easy to talk to and her gorgeous collie was so calm and fun to pet. There is a lot of room downstairs and our party of five never felt cramped at all.
1602488,10953821,2014-03-15,10521781,Jacky,"So let me start all of this by stating that I made this 2-night reservation with Sara as a birthday gift for my niece, whom I'm trying to encourage to travel more. So I didn't actually stay here. My review will be based on 1) my communication with Sara and 2) my niece's impressions.
While accommodating of the unique circumstance of the reservation, Sara was a little difficult to get in touch with. I contacted her via airbnb, sent her an email, sent her a text, called and left a message - all before finally reaching her (she did not return my call; I called her). 
As for the stay, my niece mentioned that the hosts had a party while they stayed there. I'm not sure what constitutes a party, but they could hear the music and it seemed unprofessional to her. She says that Sara was nice but ""didn't really provide a lot of guidelines"". The place was clean but the shower was stopped up and they weren't sure if they could wash clothes. All in all, ""it was a place to sleep"", which I suppose is all she needed since the goal is to see the city."
1602488,11087126,2014-03-19,4499920,David,"Very nice, clean home in a cute neighborhood. Fremont is a very easy walk away too, just across the canal. Sara and Carsten were very friendly and made our quick stay comfortable and easy. "
1602488,11494385,2014-04-05,10837212,Jacob & Brighid,"Sara & Carsten's place was amazing! They live in a great area of Seattle. We stayed in the basement, and there was plenty of space to sleep 4 people more than comfortably. Sara was extremely proactive in making sure that checking in at their place occurred at a great time for our schedule and was not a huge headache. We highly recommend this place if you are looking to stay near Seattle, but not directly downtown. "
1602488,11750080,2014-04-14,3606059,Peter,"The house was very comfortable and had a lot of room. The hosts were not there and they left a key for us. It worked out fine, although our kids were hoping to meet their dog. "
1602488,12133218,2014-04-23,13964833,Maria,"My sister and I had a very pleasant stay at Sara and Carsten's place.  Sara communicated very timely regarding our reservation.  It was clean, the beds were quite comfortable, and Sara and Carsten were very nice to interact with.  When we discovered the outlets weren't working in our rooms, Carsten promptly addressed it by replacing the fuse.  Their dog Emma is very sweet too.  It is a nice neighborhood and is an easy walk to cafe's and restaurants in Fremont."
1602488,12282518,2014-04-28,12876249,Shaun,Had a great time. Very easy check in and great communication.Would stay again and will tell others. Thank you Sara and Carsten. 
1602488,12352803,2014-04-29,1148725,Kallin,"Sara and Carsten's basement apartment was great! Super spacious, with two great rooms plus a living room with a great entertainment center. Their dog was incredibly sweet too."
1602488,12554216,2014-05-05,13746120,Scott,"Myself, my best friend, and our respective girlfriends made the trip out to Seattle to see our friend get married and used it as an opportunity to explore Airbnb. 

This location could not have been more excellent, and neither could our host (singular host, Sara was out of town that weekend). The house was clean, spacious, comfortable, and in a fantastic location for exploring the city. And Carsten was a great host offering on-point dinner advice and some really good friendly conversation. 

Having this as my first Airbnb experience was a joy. I'll definitely be repeating the process. Even right here, if I get the opportunity again!"
1602488,12890814,2014-05-13,2395362,Céline,"Notre séjour chez Sara et Carsten a vraiment été super sympa! le logement est tres agréable et spacieux, les lits tres confortables!
 Nos hôtes ont été tres chaleureux et disponibles, nous avons passé de bon moments à discuter, partagé un verre et le français de Sara est trés bon! 
Emma a fait la joie de notre fils!
Nous recommandons leur logement qui est tres bien situé avec le bus et des commerces à proximité mais le calme et la verdure tout autour.
Nous recommandons sans hesiter leur logement et retournerons chez eux si nous devons retourner à Seattle!
"
1602488,13021779,2014-05-17,11235913,Janet,"This is  a great house in a terrific location in Seattle.  Sara and Carsten are a lovely young couple who were great hosts, as was their beautiful collie, Emma!  There are two spacious bedrooms on the ""garden"" level as well as a large living space.  You can walk right out into the backyard.  The beds are comfortable and bathroom was clean.  I would definitely stay here again!  "
1602488,13243257,2014-05-23,13269361,Keidra,"My visit was very nice. Sara was welcoming and answered all my questions. When there was something she did not know she was helpful by pointing me in the right direction.  The accommodations were warm, spacious, private, and well kept. The location was great because it was a short bus ride from almost anything. My hosts did provide bus schedules which were very helpful. Their dog Emma was friendly and sweet. If I go back to Seattle I would love to stay with them again."
1602488,13741361,2014-06-03,13814644,Esther,Friendly hosts with a sweet dog and a clean home in a great neighborhood.  Couldn't ask for more.  We had a great experience and would definitely consider coming back when we return to Seattle!
1602488,13844853,2014-06-06,13497326,Tingting,"Sara and Carsten are very nice. Their rooms are clean. We had lots of luggage, but the space was enough for all of it. Taxi between downtown and the house was 15 dollar. The bus stop was 5 min. walk. We think staying in their place is much better than in an average hotel. It was a pleasant stay! "
1602488,13952928,2014-06-09,13602455,Dawn,Great experience.  The rooms were comfortable and the bathtub is pretty awesome!  Stayed with our two young children and appreciated the neighborhood location within walking distance to cafes and shops and just a quick hop to downtown Seattle.  Sara and Carsten were super.  Highly recommend.
1602488,14159559,2014-06-13,7621849,Melissa,"Sara and Carsten were great hosts and able to answer all of our questions. The house is in an excellent location: close to popular restaurants in Fremont, a lovely walk from the city center, and easy access to the Burke Gilman bike trail. We had a great stay and would definitely recommend this home.  "
1602488,14195947,2014-06-14,15686870,Pamela,"Sarah and Emma-the-beautiful-dog were lovely, congenial and welcoming.

The bed was very comfy, and spa tub a treat! Location was perfect, only a block from the graduation event I attended. Sweet neighborhood."
1602488,14340166,2014-06-17,941365,Jennifer,"We really enjoyed our stay at Sara and Carsten's downstairs rooms. Although Sara was away during this time, she was quick in answering our questions via text, and we got to meet Carsten who was very helpful. The 2 rooms were perfect for me and my hubby and my sister and her hubby.  Loved the comfy sofa and the big screen tv. We were close to everything, and we really liked the easy access to the trendy Fremont area.  They also had available lots of maps, directions and pamphlets on things to do. Will definitely come back on our next visit! "
1602488,15253019,2014-07-06,12865893,Jianqiu,"It was such a quiet neighborhood yet still close to Fremont, which is a very vibrant little town. They made this place a perfect one to live in. Sara and Carsten has been very hospitable and welcoming. "
1602488,15452357,2014-07-09,15663049,Martin,Very friendly and accommodating hosts. Lovely neighbourhood. Close to everywhere. Check out Fremont if you are in Seattle. 
1602488,15754079,2014-07-15,14718897,Kenneth,"Sara and Carsten couldn't have made us feel more welcome. 

Their gracious home is well located and beautifully appointed. "
1602488,16615528,2014-07-30,15555278,Susan,"We arrived very late because of plane troubles, but Sara and Carsten left a key for us.  Rooms were clean and nice.  Emma the dog was a wonderful hostess.  We were welcome to use the coffeepot, microwave and dishes.  If we return to Seattle, we will definitely hope to stay here again.  This sure beat a motel!  Thank you."
1602488,16790120,2014-08-02,17893167,Mary,"This house worked perfectly for our late arrival and early departure the next day.  The hosts were very accomodating and easy to contact.  We loved all the space and the beds were really comfortable.  The house was clean, modern, and roomy.  Great shower too!"
1602488,16906948,2014-08-04,7230095,Lael,"Terrific accommodations and experience at Sara and Carsten's house!  Beds were comfortable, bathroom nice.  Emma the collie unbelievably sweet and welcoming. Great location!  We will stay here if we visit Seattle again!"
1602488,17050368,2014-08-06,12879360,Kirsten,"Sara and Carston's house was warm and welcoming. The downstairs area where the bedrooms were located was a good hang out place. Everything was clean and tidy and our hosts were very responsive when we had questions, even though they weren't there. The house was conveniently located between Queen Anne and Fremont, so we were able to walk a lot of places very easily. The hills are great exercise!! We would come again!"
1602488,17344591,2014-08-11,986557,Simon,"Lovely house in a super-convenient location.  The rental suite is an easy-access (walk-out) basement apartment.  Ideal if you need a couple of rooms for parents w/kids.

Sara was a great hostess and responded very quickly to all messages such that the entire booking and stay was totally smooth and glitch-free. 

Thank you Sara and Carsten."
1602488,17623782,2014-08-15,17210182,Joanne,"A lovely home in a lovely neighbourhood. We were out and about most of the time on a busy agenda with friends, so saw very little of Sara and Carsten but the accommodation is elegant, clean and comfortable."
1602488,19203548,2014-09-08,18763247,Lauren,"My friend and I had a lovely time staying at Sara and Carsten's charming Queen Anne home. It was a very cozy, clean, and comfortable stay. The rooms were very spacious yet private, and the location was in a quaint little neighborhood within walking distance of the Fremont area. We didn't get to meet Sara and Carsten, but Annie was a wonderful hostess in their stead. She even offered us a ride on our first night there! The overall experience was warm, friendly, and accommodating. I would definitely recommend this place!"
1602488,19428302,2014-09-12,2798907,Ryan,"Great little place to stay! Although it's a shared house, we had complete privacy. Three if us stayed, and had plenty of room to spread out, and no need to share beds. Nice tv/couch area, complete with mini fridge. Good bathroom and shower. Carsten was really friendly (didn't get to meet Sara).

Neighborhood was great. Safe, and a short walk to Fremont, with a drive thru coffee shop 3 blocks away.

I would definitely recommend staying here, especially for the price."
1602488,19500210,2014-09-13,984753,Lindsay,"We didn't have the pleasure of meeting our lovely hosts but the stay was everything we could've hoped for. The house was very nice, in a great location. The rooms were extremely comfortable. They were very communicative and helpful via text even though we didn't meet in person. Emma, their wonderful dog is alone worth the price of admission. Would definitely recommend. "
1602488,19779953,2014-09-18,18591137,Shervy,"It's a quiet place with a good environment neighborhood. Surprisingly, the house is so comfy and lovely! We loved it so much! I love their rooms decorations and it's just make me miss home so much as I have been leaving home for more than 4 months! Neverthelss, I will suggest to take cab instead of taking public transport (bus)  as it's kinda inconvenient for us to take public transport and walk to the house -because we have big luggages -we need to carry the big luggages along. Overall, it's a good place good location and lovely home for us. This is our first time experience with airbnb,and we had a very good experience from Sara and Carsten! Definitely will come back again and looking forward more good experiences from airbnb :) 
Ps: I was so amazed by their Dog-Emma. She is just sooooooooo cute and nice to us! She probably is the only big dog I m not afraid to approach. "
1602488,19890328,2014-09-20,1524791,James,"Sara and Carsten were great hosts.  We had everything we needed for a great night stay there. The bed was very comfortable. The neighborhood was perfect, a short walk from restaurants and bars in Fremont. Would try to stay again if I go to Seattle again!"
1602488,19979378,2014-09-21,15426512,Hannah,"Sara greeted us at the door and was super friendly. She showed us to the suite and made sure we were comfortable and answered all our questions before leaving us to settle in. The neighbourhood and home were quaint and quiet - the suite was exactly like it was described in the photos/description! Super convenient and close to a lot of different attractions. Even though there was a pipe/water problem in our room, Sara and Carsten dealt with it as quickly as they could and even offered a refund for any inconvenience. I would definitely recommend people to stay here! Also, they have an adorable and friendly dog named Emma(:"
1602488,20207625,2014-09-25,20778722,Susan,"Sara made us feel very welcome in her home. She made sure we had everything we needed and was fun to talk to. We arrived in the evening and left early the next morning. Their dog Emma was a great host, too! The house was just as I expected. It was nice having a private space to ourselves. It was our first Airbnb experience and I would definitely do it again."
1602488,20247913,2014-09-26,20974504,Amy,"Sara and Carsten weren't home when we needed to check in so they left a key for us and made it super easy to get in. We instantly felt at home as Emma, their sweet dog, greeted us. The listing was exactly what we got, it was great! The neighborhood was perfect and within a walking distance of SPU and other great destinations. "
1602488,20889261,2014-10-06,3958535,Jeff,Friendly host in a very comfy home. Would stay there again
1602488,21893871,2014-10-26,4234665,Cialin,"The house was exactly as Sara and Carsten described in the listing.  It's beautiful, well maintained, and was a clean and pleasant place to stay.  We did meet Sara and Carsten briefly, and they were gracious hosts.  The house is very close to bus and bike routes, and not very far from downtown."
1602488,22222729,2014-11-01,3614303,Amélie,Very nice home and nice peoples
1602488,22620575,2014-11-10,5777134,Katrina,"We loved staying at Sara and Carstens house! It is located in a beautiful neighborhood and was an awesome alternative to staying in a hotel. Their beds were comfortable and warm. Just what we needed. Their house is very close to bus line 40- which took us downtown to the space needle, pike market, and centurylink field. We took cabs back to their house and thy ranged from $10-17. Not bad at all. Thanks for the stay guys!!!"
1602488,22689278,2014-11-11,23502865,Kristin,"Sara and Carsten were very gracious and helpful hosts. They communicated in a timely manner and made excellent suggestions for parking, restaurants, and sightseeing. The space was perfect for the three of us – it was clean, spacious, and the bed I slept in was incredibly comfortable. Sarah was kind enough to wake me up when she noticed I had left the lights on in my car. I was so grateful!  We loved the quiet Queen Anne neighborhood and would highly recommend this location and these hosts. "
1602488,23663124,2014-12-07,23864863,Kevin,"Sara & Carsten are the best hosts I've ever met. Their house is nice, comfortable and warm, with the great view of Seattle. Parking is convenient in its neighborhood. Highly recommend this location."
1602488,24448691,2014-12-28,9224627,Jim,"This was a wonderful facility for our group.  Three adults (parents and one other) and a child.  Two large bedrooms, large family room sort of area and private bath.  Carsten me us (9:30 pm) and got us setup, plus answered a few questions we had on getting around.  Both Sara and Carsten were available for a few more questions in the morning.  Great stay and highly recommended."
1602488,25296231,2015-01-11,9506743,Erin,"Sara & Carsten's house is beautiful and spacious. It's conveniently located on the outskirts of Queen Anne and a very short walk to Fremont, arguably our favorite Seattle neighborhood. Though they could have more clearly communicated the circumstances regarding check-in (mainly timing), they were very responsive and their home was a lovely place to stay for our night in the city. We especially enjoy the tempurpedic bed- we've never slept better!"
1602488,25401344,2015-01-14,38157,Annie,"We booked relatively last minute and Sara and Carsten quickly accepted our reservation. We weren't sure of our check-in time and they were super easy going about our arrival time, which ended up being late. The space is mostly as described, although not quite as clean and uncluttered as the photos, but as long as you're not a neat freak, it's great. As other guests have said, the beds are comfortable. Upon arrival, Sara let me intrude on the kitchen (upstairs in their space).  Emma (the dog) is sweet and gentle and made me want to take her home.  The street they live on is quite steep, which I mention for anyone who may have mobility issues. "
1602488,25612422,2015-01-20,24366348,Victor,"Sara & Carsten's place was very nice and in a great location! We had no trouble finding place to eat within walking distance (it's a hop & skip away from the Fremont town area). We didn't get much of a chance to talk with Sara or Carsten but Emma (their dog) is a sweetheart.
-Vic & Jen"
1602488,26606717,2015-02-16,26024622,Jennifer,"This was my first time using airbnb and Sara and Carsten's place was great! Despite an initial mishap with check-in, we were able to get settled in quickly. Their dog, Emma, is such a sweetheart and always greeted us with a wagging tail. The rooms/living area were very spacious and fit four of us comfortably. The house was never too cold or too hot despite Seattle's brisk weather. We rented a car and parking was never an issue. Ubering/lyft from downtown after drinks was always under $15. Great location and great price! Would definitely stay here again and recommend it to anyone!
Thanks again Sara and Carsten!"
1602488,26996779,2015-02-23,9723805,Bracy,"I was not present upon check-in and had limited interaction with Carsten, but we were very comfortable in the basement area.  Both rooms were quite clean and uncluttered.  My girlfriend checked in and because of this, I didn't get the scoop on the house, but we finally figured out that using the  back door and walking around the side to get to the street was the best method.  Prior to this, we walked up the stairs to exit the front door.  This seemed to be a bit intrusive and I didn't feel good about that, but displeasure was never expressed by our host.  Sara was out of town while we were there.  Beds are comfortable and there is plenty of room to spread out.  I rented a car, so we didn't need to find the bus stop.  Parking was not plentiful, but we were able to always find a place.  I'd like to stay here again."
1602488,27145347,2015-02-26,18067928,Beth,This is a great location and price for someone who wants a private space near downtown/Queen Anne/Ballard/Fremont.  Having access to two rooms for just one price would be great for people traveling together.
1602488,27190567,2015-02-27,5945212,Debbie,"This was my first AIRBNB experience and i loved it.  Carsten (and Emma, the very sweet dog) met us at the door, the house was easy to find, we got parking RIGHT across the street.  (i corresponded with sara and she was very helpful, answering all my pesky questions, but we never met her. maybe next time.)  we had all downstairs to ourselves, it met our needs in every way.  the basement was renovated so it was beautiful, the bed EXTREMELY comfy, the bathroom lovely (i'll have to remember to bring my shampoo/conditioner next time) :).  carsten met us in the 1 hr time we were arriving, showed us around, oh! they even let me make coffee in their coffee maker since i forgot my coffee cone.  everything was super convenient and so close to SPU  and i will definitely stay there again.  two thumbs up, i would recommend to anyone.  (one airbnb review mentioned the steep steps leading to the basement, i concur, one should be cautious and the hill the house is on is steep also - not a problem for us, but perhaps for elderly or not super fit people, that would be a problem) But! not for us, i'm used to hills.  :)  can't wait to visit again."
1602488,27896600,2015-03-14,16012066,Keri,"The 2 private rooms in Queen Anne were as described. Sara was a lovely host, very accommodating and easy to talk to.  The bedrooms & bathroom were good sized, and the living area was also fairly spacious. "
1602488,28010602,2015-03-16,27341179,Zhangxian,"We love the place very much, our rooms are located in the lower deck of the house and have a lot of privacy. Carsten is a nice guy, he doesn't talk too much, but offered us a lot of help! "
1602488,28276484,2015-03-21,16098667,Lisa,"We really enjoyed our stay in Sara and Carsten's charming home! The location is great for accessing many different areas of Seattle. The 2 private rooms are very quiet and spacious with very comfortable beds. Communication with Sara was excellent and she went above and beyond by offering to help us receive a delivery from UPS. And, of course, Emma is the icing on the cake!"
1602488,28562090,2015-03-26,27334059,Hana,Great stay.  Good location.  Nice living room area and 2 bedrooms and big bathroom. Good doggie. But slight Ant problem
1602488,28710249,2015-03-29,27369276,Faith,"The place was nice and cozy! Everything was tidy, and their dog, Emma, was the sweetest and calmest dog I have ever met!"
1602488,28977595,2015-04-01,24828659,Sabine,The reservation was canceled 121 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
1602488,29124485,2015-04-04,21192476,Michele,"We were only there for a night but would definitely stay there again when we visit Seattle. It was a great home, comfortable beds, in a nice close in location.  Sara and ( Emma the sweet collie) meet us on arrival and got us settled. thank you and hope to see you again"
1602488,29318436,2015-04-06,27965484,Annie,"We arrived mid afternoon. Carsten showed us around, he's friendly but doesn't say much. We weren't given many instructions other than how to get in, where our rooms were and how to operate the TV. They left right after we arrived. The place was comfy, but not the cleanest. The location was fantastic though and the neighborhood is wonderful. This is a good place to stay, just a little awkward because of the shared house. There's not much privacy for either party since you have to walk through their house to get out. "
1602488,29491860,2015-04-08,17372351,Kelly,Great spot! Very clean and hosts were super friendly. 
1602488,29601520,2015-04-10,26608132,Ronana,"It was our first time in Seattle and luckily we found Sara and Carsten's house to stay. Sara is a  great host , the house and the room is very cozy. Sara is a kind and neat , she prepared the shampoo and conditioner, bathroom towels and wifi . Highly recommend this cozy house if you decide to come visit Seattle!"
1602488,29743333,2015-04-12,28296365,Christine,"This home is awesome! Sara was extremely friendly, and helped us get settled right away. Emma is one of the best dogs ever! Clean house, very comfy beds, beautiful neighborhood in a very convenient location!"
1602488,30228893,2015-04-19,3641957,Wendy,"Our short stay at Sara and Carsten's place was seamless. Their lovely home was easy to find, and very comfortable. Sara and Carsten were out of town, but communication was easy and quick. "
1602488,30309715,2015-04-20,29248444,David,"Fantastic location, rooms, and hosts.  Very nicely remodeled/finished with historic look.  Would definitely stay here again.  Close to waterway bike paths giving safe city-wide access, Seattle Pacific college, and many attractions."
1602488,30676075,2015-04-26,3783443,Kelly,Absolutely loved our stay in Seattle with Sara and Carsten! The downstairs rooms were very spacious and the couch was so comfortable. Their dog Emma was super sweet and never barked or even came downstairs. Great neighborhood with plenty of shops and restaurants just a few miles from Kerry Park (beautiful view of the skyline!) and a couple miles into downtown Seattle. Would definitely return! 
1602488,30846097,2015-04-27,3360317,Amanda,"This was a lovely place! I stayed there with three friends and while we weren't there long -- came in late and left early-ish the next morning -- I would definitely stay there again. The rooms were spacious, the bed was super comfortable, and the hosts were responsive and very nice. A great find!"
1602488,31279819,2015-05-03,32374158,Ally,"This is a difficult review to write. The accommodations were nice. Cute home. Great neighborhood. Nice bedrooms with good firm mattresses. This was our first time ever using AirBnB, so we were a bit nervous. We also apparently had our first stay coincide with a family emergency for Sara and Carsten.  They were not home when we arrived at 6 pm. They did text us to let us know where to find the key. Their dog Emma was super sweet, but she became quite anxious during the night when Sara and Carsten never returned home. Emma whimpered and paced and scratched at the door as the night progressed. We tried to call and text the hosts repeatedly, but we never heard back from them. We got very little sleep and left when the sun came up. We did alert a neighbor that Emma's owners never came home and that we were concerned that something might have happened. Sara did follow up with us and apologize the next evening. They refunded us our money and explained that they had a family emergency. I will say that Sara and AirBnB worked hard to resolve everything after we left, but I can't give it more than one star given that I got a total of maybe 2 hours of asleep."

1602488,32347244,2015-05-17,4205427,Kathy,Hosts were really welcoming and respectful!  Place was clean and we were able to use the lower floor which felt like a private area to ourselves.
1602488,32647290,2015-05-19,24880066,Anna,"We really enjoyed out stay at Carsten and Sara's place. The photos are  accurate and really represent their home. The house is beautiful and well taken care of, the rooms are perfect size and clean. Their dog, Emma, is charming and very friendly.  They have a nice back yard and a cozy rec room with a very comfy couch and a mini fridge (which was very convenient, we didn't think we'd need it, but it's nice that it's there to use). The neighborhood is quiet and very close to downtown (~10min drive). I'd definitely recommend this place and would come back when we go to Seattle again. "
1602488,32754887,2015-05-21,29434800,Margot,"Had a great time here. The rooms were exactly as described and it was lovely and spacious. 
Sara was very helpful giving us great tips on what to do and see in the area. The neighbourhood has lots of cute shops and restaurants just a short walk away. 
We had a great stay and definitely recommend this listing. Emma the dog is also so wonderful. "

1602488,33374448,2015-05-27,23315441,Quinn,Sara and Carsten were awesome. They had a beautiful location and were extremely friendly. The location was had all that we needed and more!
1602488,33659295,2015-05-31,2612767,Greg,"Beautiful house in a great, quiet neighborhood, walking distance to tons of great things, and only a $10 Lyft/Uber to pretty much anywhere you'd want to go for an awesome time in Seattle. The downstairs area was really nice with big rooms and large bathroom - it was perfect for my buddy and I, but would also be solid for two couples or maybe even more. Overall it was a fantastic space.

Sara and Carsten were friendly folks that allowed us to feel at home away from home. Super chill people with great communication throughout the process. Their dog Emma was equally nice. No complaints + highly recommended!"
1602488,33767446,2015-06-01,9217518,Sandra,"Sara and Carsten's home is awesome! The bedrooms are spacious, comfortable beds, and clean. The shower/tub is amazing as well. I love their house and neighborhood in general. Wish we could have stayed longer."
1602488,34181665,2015-06-05,34395554,Trevor,"Very nicely furnished basement in a character Seattle neighbourhood. The beds were comfortable, and the hosts seemed very kind (although we only crossed paths once throughout the stay). Would stay here again in a heartbeat!"
1602488,34214336,2015-06-06,32013578,Hildamaria & Danny,Sara was wonderful and very welcoming. My husband and I had to drop off our luggage early in the morning prior to check in. Sara was kind enough to accommodate us with this. The neighborhood was lovely! There were lots of restaurants and shops within walking distance. A positive experience.
1602488,36314863,2015-06-27,22954275,Sabine & Veit,"Such a nice place, I booked it right away for another night..."

1602488,37139124,2015-07-05,20892076,Ornella,"I was here with my family for the 4th of July weekend. Saras home is beautiful and well located, very close to the freemont bridge where you can walk to restaurants and coffee shops. Both beds were very comfortable and very clean, and even with the heat wave that weekend, we had a fan in each room that kept us cool. Also, the bathroom has some otc medicine (very convenient) and ear plugs ( if the noise from upstairs bothers you). Sara was very helpful and sweet, a great hostess all around, definitely recommend!"
1602488,37839778,2015-07-11,26590093,Kia,Sara and Carsten were very welcoming and kind. They made sure we got settled and answered all questions. The location was perfect and we walked to shops and eat everyday! 
1602488,38594960,2015-07-17,32300027,Shelby,"We did not stay in Seattle very long,
so we didn't see Sara much. But, she was very welcoming from the start! We got into town a little earlier than expected, and she had the rooms ready for us :) The downstairs is a good size and the house is in a beautiful, quiet area, very close to all the great things Seattle has to offer. We only had one small issue, but Sara was easy to get in touch with, and she responded quickly. Overall, a great place for our short visit :)"
1602488,38854400,2015-07-19,34535885,Jennifer,"Sara was able to accommodate our request to  drop off our bags early, which was really helpful.  Bedrooms were spacious and shared space was nice.  It was lovely to be so close to downtown. Worked out perfectly for our group of four. "
1602488,41944941,2015-08-10,33279819,Emily,"Another lovely visit to Seattle. This was my second stay with Sara & Carsten. The first time was with my fiancé and friends, this time I brought my mother. The house is in a great location and after a day in the city we were happy to retreat to the quieter Fremont area. Had dinner at a fantastic seafood restaurant, Ponti, recommend by Sara. It was less then 5 minute walk from their house. Then we walked over the bridge and toured around the cute area. Looking forward to the next visit and testing out more restaurants and shops near their place. "
1602488,43377866,2015-08-19,24734629,Charmaine And John,This was a great place to stay! Perfect for my husband  and I and our adult children! Sara was friendly and helpful and we had plenty of privacy here. It's in a great neighborhood and is clean and comfortable.  You can't go wrong staying here!
1602488,43571024,2015-08-20,20112083,Erica,"We had a really good time, I would highly recommend this place to anyone who wants to get a feel for what it might be like to really live on Seattle. The neighborhood was perfect, great location, the house is adorable. You enter through the front door but stay downstairs, it was very spacious and clean. "
1602488,43692154,2015-08-21,20015329,Bethany,Beautiful home in a great location. Sara and Carson were friendly and accommodating. We arrived late in the evening and left the next morning. Bedrooms and facilities were clean and inviting. Highly recommend! 
1602488,44097423,2015-08-24,6459832,Peter,"My host was not in town while we there. However, we kept in contact and had no problem getting into the house. Everything we needed was readily available. It is a great neighbourhood and you can walk to Freemont and Upper Queen Anne. Also, easy to get downtown by car. "
1602488,44617748,2015-08-27,1142514,Logan,"Sara and Carsten's beautiful house was welcoming, comfortable, and perfectly accessible. Positioned just far off to be an easy retreat while remaining close enough to get to all of Seattle, this was a lucky find!"
1602488,44893871,2015-08-30,2054333,Brian,"Sara and Carsten have a wonderful home and are friendly hosts. Carsten was able to accommodate an 11:30pm check-in, which was most appreciated. The space itself is a beautiful 2 bedroom/1 bath basement with comfortable beds and a huge shower/bathtub. Their house is only 3 blocks from Fremont and a quick bus/uber ride from downtown Seattle (we were in town for PAX and it only took us about 15 minutes to get to the convention center via uber). I would definitely stay with them again."
1602488,45127738,2015-08-31,12624129,Michelle,"This was a wonderful Airbnb! Sara and Carsten were very friendly and accommodating. Their house was cozy, clean and spacious. They live in a really nice neighborhood with great restaurants in walking distance. I also really loved their dog, Emma. Emma is very cute and sweet. The overall experience was a home away from home :)"
1602488,45556108,2015-09-04,29243182,Aaron,"Sara and Carsten were great hosts.  We didn't have much interaction since we were spending a lot of time out and about and were only there for 1 night.  That being said their house was great, and worked perfectly for us.  The proximity to the Fremont neighborhood was great!"
1602488,46170852,2015-09-08,40885576,Adam,"Sarah was very welcoming upon our arrival, as well as Emma, their dog. The accommodations were as expected and was located in a nice neighborhood. Sarah even let us borrow a hair dryer when my wife forgot hers. The home's location was convenient to the central part of the city. "
1602488,46636253,2015-09-12,42512233,Stephen,Very nice place and people.
1602488,47066339,2015-09-15,32993779,Julie,"Beautiful home to experience our first Airbnb adventure.  Sara was warm and welcoming and was willing to explain how to catch the bus stop to downtown and how to walk to Fremont.  The house was clean and in a quiet neighborhood which was perfect for sleeping after a busy day.  Their dog was very sweet and well behaved and was the first one to greet us at the door!

Communication prior to arrival was prompt and clear, and everything with using the keys went as described.

A great first experience using Airbnb! Thank you Sara and Carsten for the lovely accommodations!"
1602488,47499059,2015-09-19,22958694,Chris,Everything was great! Very cute and clean.
1602488,48347464,2015-09-25,42221833,Connie,"Sara and Carsten's place was just perfect for my trip. The location was just blocks from where I needed to be and a lovely walk to many restaurants and coffee shops. It was very clean, well organized, and had easy access. Sara and Carsten were friendly but not intrusive. Great first time Airbnb experience. "
1602488,48734805,2015-09-28,41785716,Hui,The host is very kind and house well-appointed. Always keep quiet when entering and leaving because our host is living upstairs.
1602488,50293963,2015-10-11,21725223,Xiaodan,large place and friendly host
1602488,51371057,2015-10-19,5956765,Chris,"We had a great stay with Sara and Carsten. The rooms are located on the basement floor of the house, which made it very private and comfortable. Huge rooms, recreational room, and bathroom. We even had a few minutes to enjoy their poker table one evening. 

The location was great as well. Walkable to Fremont and even Ballard. (it took 30 minutes but we did it). Public transportation is close for those without a car. 

We would love to stay here again the next time we pass through Seattle. Sara made us feel at home and was very responsive. "
1602488,52455825,2015-10-29,567541,Laura,This place was very comfy and very convenient for us.  Both bedrooms are good-sized and we both slept very well.
1602488,52678237,2015-11-01,18103158,Daryll,Sara and Carsten were great. We were a bit late pulling into town due to traffic/US border crossing but that was no problem. We got some great recommendations on places to eat. House was ideally located for checking out Queen Anne/Fremont. 
1602488,53734429,2015-11-11,1356444,Jacqueline,"Sara and Carsten's place was very pretty. It was comfortable and private, as it was in the basement in its own contained area. The one issue we had was that the heater was very loud when it kicked in throughout the night. It seemed to be louder in one room than the other. Overall, it was a good value in a convenient location."
1602488,53994558,2015-11-15,46593920,Anthelia,Sara and Carsten made us feel welcome. It was a fun weekend for us and I'm sure an interesting weekend for them as well. 
1715582,8035462,2013-10-13,9333064,Shelaswau,"Younghee is an amazing hostess and her home is absolutely beautiful.  The house is incredibly clean and beautiful.  The room is large and spacious with a separate small study area nd desk.  And the bed is amazing, best sleep I've had in years.  I really hated to have to wake up.  Younghee has plenty of towels and toiletries to share.  Younghee shares common areas of the house.  I wish I'd had more time to just sit and relax in her tranquil sun  room and admire her beautiful assortment of plants.
Younghee herself is an absolutely beautiful person.  We had great conversation in the evening over tea and over coffee in the morning.  I would definitely recommend staying here.  I know I will if I have the opportunity again!"
1715582,8108675,2013-10-15,3219496,Tsipy,"We asked April to stay at her house very last minute. She responded very quickly and was very accommodating: she worked hard to take great care of us even though we only needed a place to stay for the night (e.g. Offering us use of her coffee machine and teas, and making us coffee in the morning even!). The house was cozy and warm, and the bed was comfortable! The only minor downside is that Boise travels quite well inside the house- otherwise a very warm and welcoming stay in a very convenient location. Would come again!"
1715582,8157549,2013-10-18,8812256,Ann,"Younghee Lee's home was warm and inviting. It was very clean. The bed was comfortable, and my room had a beautiful view of Seattle. Younghee Lee was a gracious hostess, making sure I was comfortable. I would return to this home again!"

1715582,8234163,2013-10-21,9271360,Khalil,"I was so happy to have Younghee as my host. I could never expect such a great hospitality ever. Just be ready to get much more than what you look into getting. She is down to earth, sincere and welcoming. She made sure I was doing ok. Today I am happy to know I have found myself a great friend in Seattle. The house and the neighborhood is awesome too. I couldn't get enough of it. I already miss it. "
1715582,8466640,2013-11-01,8812256,Ann,"This was my second stay at Younghee Lee's beautiful home. Once again, I found her to be a most gracious hostess, with a warm, comfortable personality. Younghee Lee provides  a very well-kept home that makes a stay in Seattle feel like home away from home! "
1715582,8720516,2013-11-13,6511941,Jason,"The hostess is a generous, kind classy lady. She has a very comfortable room for guests that is well furnished and has a handy bathroom right next door. Had some great conversations with her about gardening and traveling, and her husband is a great host as well."
1715582,8753608,2013-11-16,6457901,Carey,"Younghee went out of her way to make me feel comfortable and welcome in her lovely home   I found Younghee to be delightful company. Her generosity and her concern for my well being was greatly appreciated   The accommodations were immaculate with a long deep bathtub, great for a relaxing soak. There were plenty of warm slippers waiting for guests by the front door of this shoeless home. The bed was supremely comfortabl and the bedroom spacious with lots of daylight.  The hosts were very quiet and considerate not to disturb their guest after we retired. Wallingford is a quiet, safe and interesting neighborhood. I am looking forward to returning to this great Airbnb. "
1715582,9279499,2013-12-17,747256,Mohsen,"My wife and I stayed at Younghee's place for two nights, and we had a very pleasant experience. Younghee is extremely friendly and welcoming, we spent a fair amount of time during our short stay chatting with her about many different things, we also had the pleasure to taste her great cooking and baking. Younghee's place was also very nice, cozy, and extremely clean. Our room was quite spacious, and had a nice view of downtown Seattle. The neighbourhood around the house is also very nice with many restaurants. We would love to stay again at Younghee's place when we visit Seattle again, and we strongly recommend her place to Airbnb travellers."
1715582,9295073,2013-12-19,6425031,Mike,"My stay was everything I could have asked for and more! Younghee is an incredibly kind and friendly person. She went out of her way to make me feel welcome, baking me cookies and even giving me a ride to my interview in the morning. Her home is beautiful and spotless. Without a doubt, I would book with Younghee again. I'm lucky to have met her. 

"
1715582,15319701,2014-07-07,2500089,Kateland,"Younghee was the perfect host, we had some trouble with traffic when we arrived and didn't get to the house till really late but she was so lovely about it all and stayed up to let us in and still showed us round. In the morning she was super helpful with finding bus times etc for us to get out and about as well as making us tea and sharing fruits with us from her garden. The house is lovely, and the room is a great size with a really comfy bed and a great view over Seattle from the window. If ever in Seattle again, we would be sure to stay with Younghee again."
1715582,15581392,2014-07-12,16080071,Luis,"Younghee made me feel quite comfortable, the same as being at my own place. I found a spacious, clear and clean room, with complete privacy. Description of the room and house was absolutely accurate. The house was at a walking distance from the beautiful university of Washington, and 20 minutes by bus to reach downtown. Neighborhood is calm, and close to a supermarket and some bars and restaurants. Younghee was also very helpful in providing cues to explore a number of points in Seattle. She loves a good chatting. It was a great stay!"
1715582,15817529,2014-07-16,9897559,Irene,"Younghee & Peter, were very hospitable.  Peter meet me when I arrived & carried my bag upstairs.  My room was extremely clean and fresh, as was the bathroom. Literature, brochures and bus schedules were nicely laid out on the dresser in my room.  Due to the cool weather, windows could be opened to receive fresh air.  Their garden was beautiful and Younghee shared many of her tips on organic vegetable growing and cooking. Immediately upon my arrival, Younghee showed me where everything was located in the house, offering coffee or tea for mornings.  She also, took time out of her schedule to show and drive me to the Chittenden Locks and drove around the Fremont community showing me all the points of interest.  One morning Younghee took me to a popular park filled with walkers, runners, swimmers and fishermen. At the end of the day when I would arrive back, I was always greeted by  Younghee or Peter, asking what adventures I had that day. On may last evening with them, Younghee prepared a wonderful meal for  the three of us to share.  At the end of my stay, I felt like I had made new friends!"
1715582,15951199,2014-07-19,12021997,Daniel,"Younghee was an incredible host to me and my wife during our stay in Seattle. She and her husband were generous and kind, and their home is so unbelievably charming. It will be safe to say that we now consider her a friend more than a host whose home we once stayed at. 

I hope that future guests appreciate how much she wants to make her guests feel comfortable while they're there and return their respect for her time and home. "
1715582,16104556,2014-07-22,515492,Felixa,"Younghee was most welcoming and took care of us any minute we were at her gorgeous house. Our stay was too short to take advantage of everything, but we could easily have hung out on the patio for hours. The room is spacious, very clean, and has a stunning view. The neighborhood is charming and calm, but close to great restaurants on 45th street and a short drive to downtown. Highly recommended! "
1715582,16294170,2014-07-25,6642602,Timothy,"Younghee was a great host and very friendly. She made sure we felt at home, even making breakfast for us a couple mornings. And she was excited to tell us about Seattle and give us insight into places to visit. 
Her home is very beautiful and comfortable, and access to the kitchen was very convenient. It was a great place to stay in a quiet neighborhood that was only a few blocks away from shops and restaurants, and a short drive from downtown. Would love to stay here again."
1715582,16481524,2014-07-28,17170323,Silja,"The room was very clean and classy and also the bathroom. Yonghee was nice and eager to help with bus schedules and sightseeing, she even made us coffee in the morning and croissants! Downtown is easy to get to by bus and other places worth to visit are within walking distance. "
1715582,16668343,2014-07-31,2777414,Suna,"Younghee was an wonderful host. She has heart of gold and charming personality. Her house was beautifully kept and is in a great and convenient location. There are lots of restaurants walking distance and bus stops are nearby her house. Younghee made me a breakfast and her garden she tales care of is amazing. I miss her and our talk, time spend together. Thank you, Younghee! Hope we keep in touch and I get to see you again! 

"
1715582,17087616,2014-08-07,6375111,Merry,"My week in Seattle turned into a wonderful experience with zero hassles because of Younghee Lee! From day one, she provided information, maps, good advice and a very warm welcome. I really appreciated her morning coffee and company.  Whatever she was cooking on any day was shared and I really need to mention that Younghee's cooking is a work of art! I was in town for a wedding and had a very busy schedule the first 4 days, but this visit was like staying at an old friend's home who was happy to have your company. I slept well, ate well and enjoyed staying in a home that was clean, beautiful and peaceful."
1715582,17744075,2014-08-17,14766700,Ann,"My  host was very friendly and very helpful.  She provided maps, a hat, an umbrella and wonderful cups of tea.  She gave good advice about things to do in the Seattle area.  The room was clean and attractive.  The neighborhood was nice and was in a central location with easy bus service.   I would highly recommend staying with Younghee.  I would love to go back there again."
1715582,18060351,2014-08-21,17091654,Jinyong,"너무 행복하게 지낸 시애틀이었습니다. 지금은 디트로이트에 있는데, 시애틀에서 살고싶은 느낌이 계속 생각납니다. 주인 아주머니도 너무 친절하셔서 너무 편하게 2박3일동안 시애틀에서 지낸 것 같습니다. 감사합니다 ~
이곳은 한국인보다는 유럽인이 많이 온다고 하셔서, 다른 한국인들이 이곳을 이용하시면 친구도 사귀고 정말 좋을 것 같습니다. 자연과의 여행을 하는 느낌이 아직도 기억에 납니다. 다운타운까지는 그렇게 멀지도 않고, 시애틀은 너무 안전해서 밤에 혼자 돌아다녀도 위험하지는 않았습니다. 다음에 꼭 시애틀에 온다면 이곳을 또 방문할 예정입니다. 
I  had a special experience.  So I have left a good memory in Seattle. Thank you very much."
1715582,18528784,2014-08-28,16463031,Denis,"A great experience! Younghee and Peter are beautiful persons, taking great care of their guests, you cna learn a lot from them (in particular, Younghee is a great gardener and cook; she also an experienced mycologist). The room was large, everything is convenient in this beautful house and the garden is superb. The area is quite green and quiet. There are many shops, restaurants and bars just 2 blocks away, with buses stops to downtown. Thank you so much Younghee!"
1715582,18791903,2014-09-01,16562952,Katharina,"I had a really nice stay at Younghee's place. I felt a little bit like being at home, even it was only for two nights and two nice breakfasts with freshly brewed coffee and croissants. A perfect stay!"
1715582,22943554,2014-11-18,19150616,Linda,"I stayed here for eight nights and had a very comfortable and easy experience. Younghee is delightful, very friendly and welcoming. She allowed me to use the kitchen and so was able to make my own breakfast and a couple of evening meals. I was able to do my washing and ironing mid week which is a great help when travelling. She is a great cook and she regularly offered me food and (email hidden)e location is ideal for walking to many cafes, bars and shops as well as catching buses to just about anywhere around Seattle. "
1715582,23263409,2014-11-27,19580468,Kate,"Younghee's house is beautifully restored, extremely comfortable, and well-placed, especially for visits to UW. Wallingford is a really lively neighborhood - great for walking.  We arrived late and Younghee was on hand to help us settle in and get oriented. She was a great source of local information and even loaned me a coat one day! Great visit which we hope to repeat."

4518474,25817376,2015-01-26,8882763,Genie,"Our stay was perfect.  Amy showed us all of the ins and outs of the private apartment and left us a list of area restaurants.  The location is quiet but close to Fremont, and everything as was described before hand. The deck and view are awesome."
4518474,25983722,2015-01-31,19487660,Bron,"Amy was kind enough to accept my brother and I at short notice, and then agreed to host my brother and his friend instead when my flight was delayed. Although I didn't get to stay here myself, my brother  enjoyed his stay. He told me it was large, airy, clean and well stocked. He loved the large deck with mountain views. Amy gave them a list of helpful suggestion including restaurants and directions. He loved it and said Amy was delightful- he would definitely recommend this place."
4518474,26507598,2015-02-14,6311018,Kyle,"Awesome stay and an absolutely gorgeous view, hopefully we can make another trip to Seattle in the future purely for a hammock in the morning."
4518474,27032138,2015-02-23,14063122,Blanca,"The space was perfect, a great location for folks that are to Seattle. All their amenities were wonderful and unexpected, the fruit and bread were much appreciated. The privacy and tranquility of their cozy studio gave us the opportunity to relax while being able to enjoy what the neighboring communities had to offer. 

The sofa bed was comfortable and perfect for a couple. We enjoyed the view their back porch had to offer at all times of the day!"
4518474,27438691,2015-03-04,1918225,Kerry,"My last night of this trip was spent here, in Amy's in law studio below their house. It is even better than the pictures show!!! The couch turns into a super comfy bed, its charming, cosy, and beautiful :)
Amy was a fantastic host. Very kind and easy to work with. I was able to walk around the Fremont area with ease from her place, and it was an easy bus ride into Ballard too. I highly recommend staying in her adorable sweet space...I will be back next time I'm in Seattle!!!"
4518474,27700333,2015-03-09,4006775,Shameem,"We stayed at Amy's place for one lovely night. The weather was gorgeous, the porch, welcoming and delightful.  Amy was welcoming and helpful and the space was just as promised.  A special find in Seattle indeed."
4518474,28101818,2015-03-17,28890523,Elissa,"What a perfect, cozy place! It was right in the heart of Fremont, with do much to do and see within walking distance or a short drive."
4518474,28536585,2015-03-25,6139280,Terri,"We had a wonderful time staying in Amy's house! Her place was adorable and had all the amenities we needed. Amy was extremely helpful and eager to answer all questions. Unfortunately the poor weather prevented us from utilizing the beautiful back porch like we would have liked, but we would love to come back in the summer to try again! "
4518474,28592120,2015-03-26,1268013,Corey,"This place was great! Charming, close to both Ballard and Fremont, and also includes an amazing deck. Amy was a great host - she took my reservation on short notice and had a nice spread waiting for me. This is a great place for people looking to explore the neighborhoods north of Lake Union. I'd absolutely stay there again."
4518474,28742159,2015-03-29,88723,Lydia,"Great location. Cozy studio, nice bedding, very clean and yummy snacks. "
4518474,28804508,2015-03-30,1330971,Corinne,"We had a lovely stay at Amy's studio. We found everything we needed (and more -- coffee and delicious cinnamon bread!) The studio is spacious, comfortable, private and an easy walk to transit and to downtown Fremont. Amy was a friendly and very helpful host. No hesitation in recommending this place. We'd love to return."
4518474,28914967,2015-03-31,19640814,Laura,"The description was accurate.  The trip was a sad occasion for me, so I did not really take advantage of the space much, but I was happy with the accommodations - very clean with many little nice touches.  Lovely deck to relax on.  Thanks."
4518474,30593494,2015-04-24,30478458,Steven,"What a lovely location, and very gracious host!   Amy just made everything easy, parking, internet and even bread!!  It felt like home, and since we are local, made it all more special.   We would not hesitate to stay again - thank you for making this so easy.
"
4518474,31416818,2015-05-04,9699560,Jeremy,"Great place, lovely back yard and porch setting. Only draw back is the pull out couch, could be more comfy. "
4518474,31984059,2015-05-12,5006723,Kelly,"My husband and I had a great stay here! Very nice apartment, clean and well-equipped. The pull out bed was super comfy and we loved enjoying the deck that overlooks a beautiful garden. Amy was a great host and had everything ready for us and was available if we needed something. The location is great, very convenient if you have a car, you can be downtown in 15 min or so. Lots of good restaurants nearby and the neighborhood is beautiful. Thanks again for everything!"
4518474,32215959,2015-05-15,28004287,Jane,"Amy was wonderful - greeted me at the door, gave me a tour of the adorable apartment, was warm and friendly, and left me to my night. I felt safe and I knew she was there if I needed her, but utterly private. 

Heck, even if we hadn't met I would know how much she cares about her guests by the things she left there for us: gorgeous snacks and breakfast foods, lovely fluffy towels and high quality linens, an xBox and a great sound system, and just plain gorgeous decor. Everything looked as good as the pictures - even better, really, because it was all so soft and comfy. 

I loved my time there and will definitely go back. Thanks, Amy!"
4518474,32582353,2015-05-19,28832572,Patrick,"Amy and John made us feel very welcomed - showing us around the studio when we arrived and having an amazing numbered map and list of restaurants, cafes, bars, etc of the Fremont area.  Could've have asked for a nicer experience.  Fresh wildflowers on the deck, fruits and breakfast nutroll in the kitchen, and other goodies throughout were an amazing touch.   Fremont is a great little neighborhood too!

Everything we expected and more - hammock on the deck, clawfoot tub, full kitchen, remote-controlled fireplace and tv/soundbar!  So thankful for finding this spot!"
4518474,33170869,2015-05-25,2350124,Gabe,"We loved the place. The description was spot on. Being on a bottom floor of a home, we had no issues with noise. The pets were not an issue. The cinnamon bread...mmm...that was a delicious morning treat! We loved the location and the neighborhood. We would recommend this place to any of our friends or family. Thank you four your hospitality."
4518474,34229366,2015-06-06,33571304,Kristin,"The listing was as fantastic as described! Not only was Amy's studio spacious, cozy, and well-stocked with places to sit and relax, it had tons of natural light and a great view! The fireplace gave us the ability to regulate the temperature easily and kept us warm when we needed it. The back porch was amazing and I wish the weather had been a little warmer so we could have taken more advantage of it! Amy provided us with instructions for our stay (such as WiFi password, contact information, etc) and even welcomed us with local treats, coffee, tea, snacks, and even fresh fruit. There were toiletries (though we had our own) and tons of big fluffy towels.
The location was fantastic--I have family three blocks from Amy which is really why her place peaked our interest initially--but there is a ton to do in Fremont.  We were within walking distance of at least 2 coffee shops, several bars, a brewery or two, and tons of restaurants. Although Fremont (like a lot of Seattle) is extremely hilly, we were happy to find Amy's place was less than half-way up the large hill in that neighborhood! Tons of parking if you have a car. If you don't then there are several bus lines near by and we spotted several Car2Go vehicles every day within a few blocks. 

When we booked it, my partner had some reservations about sleeping on a pull-out sofa but we ended up being very comfortable and had no trouble sleeping and woke up feeling well-rested.  I do, however, come from a family of picky sleepers so I would caution those who may have back issues and/or prefer sleeping on a very firm or some sort of memory-foam mattress that you may not love sleeping on the pull-out sofa. I will say, Amy has done a lot to make it as comfortable as possible so if you don't require specialized sleeping arrangements then this is definitely the place for you!

I would absolutely book at Amy's the next time I'm in Seattle! She is a wonderful host with a beautiful rental!"
4518474,35080403,2015-06-15,22252525,Josina,This was the prefect location for my parents visiting (our too small apartment). Amy was responsive and helpful and the studio is well appointed with a wonderful deck and view.
4518474,35573732,2015-06-20,33785861,Jennifer,"Amy was very welcoming and flexible with our late arrival, which was even later due to a delayed flight. She communicated well prior to our arrival. She made herself available for any questions we had during our stay, but was also unobtrusive. Two great hosting qualities. :) 

The house is beautiful and in a wonderful suburban feeling neighborhood of Seattle. We enjoyed napping and spending time on their large, comfortable porch. There are many restaurants, bars, sites within walking distance. Recommendations and a map were provided by the host. It was very thoughtful. 

The cinnamon roll bread that was provided, may have been my favorite part. It was devoured within two days. It's fantastic! thank you, Amy for a great first AirBnB experience. "
4518474,35772633,2015-06-22,10344955,Sarita,"The absolute worse thing about staying at Amy's place is I did not book extra nights. But even if I had,  it still would have been hard to leave this classy spot. Ultimately it's what every Airbnb experience should be. All of the preceeding great host reviews are accurate.  You can't buy peace, nor can you explain it. However once experienced, you appreciate that you are genuinely there. Its the peace of being at a very nice, safe, clean, private, inviting...home!"
4518474,38428809,2015-07-15,12273147,Lindsey,"Amy was an incredible communicator, fantastic host and you will not be disappointed if you rent this spot in Fremont. It's clean, accessible to shops/coffee/food and the back porch is amazing. We had a wonderful stay and I will definitely be renting this place again the next time I'm in town. :)"
4518474,38940350,2015-07-19,3046396,Yvette,Great space! Loved the view. 
4518474,39331775,2015-07-22,34319539,Ben,"Amy's apartment was perfect for our all-too-short stay in Seattle.   The pictures don't do the space justice--it was clean, comfortable and charming.  We enjoyed the delicious freshly ground coffee and cinnamon bread on the sunny patio in the mornings. The location was safe and convenient for exploring the great Fremont neighborhood on foot.  Amy was a wonderful host; she let us know that she was reachable if we needed anything, but the apartment itself was completely private.  Amy has a lot of knowledge of the neighborhood and was a pleasure to talk to.  We would love to come back next time we're in Seattle!"
4518474,39666905,2015-07-25,1003591,John,"We were extremely happy to have stayed at Amy’s house. The lower level of her home became our home for three days. The very charming apartment had a spacious living room, bedroom, large kitchen and bathroom. Also, there was a lovely deck which housed a table with 4 chairs, couch, swing and hammock. The views from the deck were simply breathtakingly beautiful and the apartment was functional and extremely neat and clean. We had a fantastic time in Seattle and largely due to the great accommodations. Amy provided everything we needed from plenty of towels to snacks and much more. If we travel to Seattle again, we will definitely stay at Amy’s beautiful home again!
 "
4518474,39740941,2015-07-26,30797640,Rob And Gretchen,The neighborhood was lovely and quiet. Amy worked with us to meet us for check in and show us the place. The place was just as the listing showed it. Spacious and clean and inviting.
4518474,40775218,2015-08-02,2996014,Jaclyn,"I booked Amy's apartment for a recent work trip and it was a wonderful decision. The place was just as pictured. The back porch was lovely and there was plenty of room to share with my boyfriend who also accompanied me on the trip. Amy was a great host -- got the key to me easily, made sure my Amazon package was in a safe place, welcomed us with a delicious sweet cinnamon bread. The parking situation was perfect, as there was always a close spot. I would definitely rebook! "
4518474,41630413,2015-08-08,37187767,Beth,"Amy's place was spacious and very comfortable. The location is fantastic for exploring the many shops and restaurants in Freemont and Ballard and is also within walking distance of a bus stop that goes to downtown Seattle. There is also plenty of parking on the street.

Amy was very easy to communicate with and made sure we had everything we needed. She even left snacks and breakfast food for us in the kitchen."
4518474,41794474,2015-08-09,37510339,Sally,We enjoyed the Fremont area.  Our host had some nice recommendations for dinner within walking distance.  Apartment was well equipped and quiet.  An affordable alternative to the downtown hotels.
4518474,42544343,2015-08-14,31619008,Paula,"What a fantastic first Air BnB experience! Amy was friendly and easily reachable before  our visit, answering all my first-timer questions. She greeted us onsite to give us a brief tour of the place and to give us the key. The apartment itself was ideal for two adults and a child, and is bigger than it looks in the picture.  I loved the claw foot bathtub and we will miss drinking our morning coffee on the covered back deck with a view of her lovely, terraced backyard. The neighborhood is quirky and interesting with easy access to the city and lots of dining places in walkable proximity (if you're not opposed to walking up Seattle's big  hills). All the kitchen essentials were at our fingertips and Amy even provided snacks and the makings for a quick spaghetti dinner after a very long day trip (and late arrival back home) to Olympic National Park. My only regret is  that we weren't able to stay longer! "
4518474,42915368,2015-08-16,2630867,Susan,We loved the apartment at Amy's! It is a cozy space that makes you feel right at home.  Beautiful views into her garden and out over the area of Fremont down to the water from the deck.  We highly recommend a stay here.  You'll feel like part of the neighborhood!
4518474,43306816,2015-08-18,19856121,Mildred,"Clean, comfortable, nicely stocked and appointed,  great terrace,  thoughtful touches and kind, informative and helpful host."
4518474,43838159,2015-08-22,40735021,Justin,"Perfect AirBNB experience at Amy's Fremont Apartment. Amy had great communication and was very accommodating. The location was outstanding for me as I could easily walk to Ballard and Fremont to check out all the shops, restaurants, and bars without having to worry about parking or driving. The apartment was clean, quiet, and had all the comforts of home. Would definitely recommend and would gladly stay here again. "
4518474,44320052,2015-08-25,3608908,Charles,"My wife and 23-year-old daughter stayed at Amy's flat  and had a great time. Amy was extremely accommodating.  Due to a late flight and dinner  reservations made long in advance, we couldn't get to the flat until midnight.  She made it easy for us to get settled and get a good night's sleep after an exhausting day.  She left some useful provisions for the next morning, too.  The apartment is comfortable and cozy, exactly as advertised.  It's in fantastic neighborhood, close to lots of great restaurants and bars in the Fremont district, and accessible via car to many other parts of Seattle.  The best thing about it, for us, was the large and inviting deck, where we  went back with our kids and had a wonderful evening.  We were visiting our son, who spent the summer in Seattle on an internship, and it was great to have a nice, private space where we could relax and catch up with him.  Ii would definitely stay there again."
4518474,46168080,2015-09-08,32275443,Karthik,Amy was a very nice host. She was warm and showed us around the place when we reached and was very helpful to any questions we had. The house very well located close to Downtown Seattle. The view from the patio was spectacular. We had a very nice experience overall.
4518474,46960066,2015-09-14,10439578,Stephanie,"We had a wonderful time in Seattle, thanks in large part to our great Air B and B.  The weather was perfect for enjoying the great deck.  We spent our first night wandering around the very cute and quirky neighborhood and ate at a wonderful Thai restaurant.  Amy went out of her way to provide lots of great recommendations and maps to help us get around, and there were delicious apples and other snacks awaiting us in the kitchen."
4518474,47836582,2015-09-21,32400579,Karen,Cozy home from home. The apartment is bigger than it looks but has a family feel. Loved the deck space. Well situated for exploring the Fremont/ Ballard area and an uber taxi is cheap enough to get to Downtown. Highly recommended and would love to stay again! Thanks Amy and John!
4518474,48030312,2015-09-22,43449090,Michelle,"Communications from the host was prompt and I appreciate that.
We enjoyed our stay the place was quiet and we felt welcome. It was clean and comfortable. Would like to stay here again.
Thanks Michelle P
"
4518474,48904265,2015-09-29,1592785,Onyia,"Amy answered my e-mails quickly and friendly, wasn't home when we stayed but had family or friends upstairs.  It didn't bother us but you can hear people talking and walking above you, but they were quiet by 11 pm.  The porch was wonderful with a hammock my friend took a nap in one afternoon and we ate a candlelit dinner while watching the sunset on the porch as well.  The living room is very cozy, and fell in love the the fireplace.  The living room was spacious enough to do yoga in front of the fire every morning, and they even had little massage balls!  Amy left us yummy cinnamon bread and soda's which was very thoughtful, and there was butter and spices which was helpful.  In the bedroom there was a reading nook with a fabulous collection.  The bed was functional, and the bathroom could have been cleaner but had instant hot water and the best towels.  This place was wonderful and enjoyed the quiet residential neighborhood while able to walk for drinks and food.

Thank you!"
4518474,49475144,2015-10-04,21490928,Erin,Very happy with our stay - we were so grateful for the fruit and snacks available to us since we got in late and weren't staying long enough to get to a grocery store. Cute space and nice view. Very peaceful area of Fremont. Would stay here again!
4518474,51335228,2015-10-19,20657549,Dale,"Great neighborhood, interesting walking to the ship canal and Fremont Sunday Market.  Very private, covered deck with hammocks, table and chairs, and a string of miniature lantern lights.  Plenty of room for our family of three adults inside and out.

Kitchen had everything we needed for simple breakfasts including coffee, fruit, and a loaf of Dave's Bread.  Media center included large screen TV, XBox and Chromecast for full connectivity.  There were old-fashioned games and books around too.  Fun!

House was probably built in the 1920's and has had minimal updates; it even has the old push-button light switches (charming) and no outlets in the bathroom (not so charming). There is however, a full-length mirror near the sweet breakfast table with an outlet nearby for shaving or hair drying.  

Hosts Amy and John were very responsive and helpful.  "
4518474,55254895,2015-11-29,48487419,Martin,"Excellent Airbnb accommodations, as per other reviewers.  Not spotlessly clean, but a few cobwebs in places that are out of the way and otherwise easily overlooked really isn't an issue.  More than made up for with clean and welcoming kitchen (unopened 1/2 + 1/2, coffee, granola bars, fruit, etc), thick and luxurious towels, etc.  Super location in quiet neighborhood and a responsive and easy to work with host.  Living room is inviting, but bathroom definitely is not and is very small.  Although clawtooth tub is charming, it is awkward to get into, find a place for your soap, etc.  Not a big deal, but just realize that is part of the deal with this otherwise excellent accommodations.  I'd stay here again."
1651324,8709702,2013-11-12,9839582,Bryant,"I believe that my girlfriend and I were the first guests that Ross had stay through AirBnB, and our stay was nothing short of amazing.

In terms of hospitality Ross gets an A+. His charming apartment was absolutely spotless. His place was decorated nicely with great artwork all throughout. I had mentioned prior to arriving that we were visiting Seattle with little-to-no agenda, besides some romantic adventures, nice dining, and just wandering the city, and when we arrived he had set us up with some awesome city maps, a cute hand-written welcome note and all (with some impressive illustrations on it! Go Ross!). He has a sweet mountain bike that was also offered for us to use, but we never took him up on the offer.

Ross insisted that at any point we needed recommendations, advice, directions, etc that we just give him a ring, which I did. He otherwise left us to enjoy ourselves. Him and his girlfriend were super nice, and to be honest, had we not been on such a romantic agenda I would have surely gave them a ring to grab a bite or drink with us. Next time Ross!

The location of the apartment was perfect for our stay. It's very centrally located in downtown, so we were able to walk pretty much everywhere we went for our weekend in Seattle. There are a couple hills surrounding his apartment building, which was no problem for us even when we arrived with our suitcases, but worth noting. We appreciated walking off some of the amazing meals we had, in fact.

We loved the accommodations so much that my girlfriend and I want to come visit seattle again, and if/when we do, we'll be sure to stay here again (providing it's not all booked up, this is a good one).

Our visit to Seattle was in November, but Apparently AirBNB policy is that reviews have to be written within a month of your stay, and I made the big mistake of completely forgetting to do this within that window. I was so shattered to have missed the opportunity to give Ross and his place the glowing review that he absolutely deserved, that I reached out to AirBNB customer service to make an exception for us. Thats how great it was. Stay here."
1651324,9193627,2013-12-12,2453733,Joe,"My mom came into town for the birth of our first child and we picked Ross' flat to have her stay and he made it so easy and wonderful for her. There was fresh fruit from the market waiting for her and his place was clean, organized, spacious and full of natural light and windows. 

I was fairly busy with the birth as one could imagine, but Ross was a great host for her and was even flexible with her dates to let her extend the reservation an extra two day. The whole process was easy and painless.

The loft is fantastic. The place is huge. There's a nice kitchen and bathroom, and two large connected rooms for the bedroom and living room. As I mentioned there are tons of windows so the loft gets lots of light, and has great views of First Hill and South Seattle. Hardwood floors throughout the loft make the place really homey. My mom even said that if she were to move here this loft would be a great place to live. 

The loft is perfectly situated, and easy to access. 5 blocks from a light rail station if you're coming from the airport. Once you're there it's just 6 blocks away is the Seattle Art Museum. From there you're only four blocks away from Pike Place Market and all that has to offer. Of course it's nice and close to Swedish Medical too, if you happen to be having a baby too!

Overall this stay couldn't have been better, both Ross and the Flat were absolutely great. "
1651324,9710666,2014-01-06,10085606,Kelly,"An amazing experience! Ross has a nice spacious apartment with all of the amenities needed for travelers (including a great tub!). The building is located in a central location that is easily accessible and makes getting around the city a breeze.

Ross was a great host. He was very flexible and offered great recommendations and suggestions for places to eat and things to do that are a little more ""off the beaten path"" in Seattle. Well worth checking out!"
1651324,9937617,2014-01-20,1196432,Kendra,"Ross was such a lovely host. He really went the extra mile to make us feel at home and to guide us in his city. He had a couple beers in the fridge and the radio tuned in to the best station, which made our arrival magical.
Although we had a wonderful time I felt a little misled about the location of the apartment. It is right beside the freeway, which is great for getting around, just a little disappointing if you aren't prepared for it. I'm sure this is no fault of Ross's as the airBnB site says the correct address, but shows a different location on the map. Again, not a big deal if you know about it before hand. It really is a great location for getting around and seeing the city. It is also right beside a hotel, so you just have to walk outside to grab one of many taxis waiting at the hotel.
The bed and water pressure are a little soft, but the feeling of being at home out weighs any slight negatives.
Thanks again to Ross for hosting us. We had a wonderful time.
Must do's- Bar Sajor for the most delicious dinner, Zig Zags for a throw back cocktail and Sitka & Spruce for the most inspiring market experience.

 
"
1651324,10364286,2014-02-16,6289161,Christina,"I stayed in Ross' flat for a few nights and had a great time.  The space is beautiful and exactly as pictured. Ross left us brochures to sights around town and a copy of a newspaper with events. He gave us great re commendations for places to see , and we had a great trip. The bed is one of the most comfortable I've ever slept in, the kitchen is fantastic, the claw bath is outstanding. There is a huge amount of natural lighting and the building itself is a work of art. It is centrally located and we ended up walking anywhere we wanted to go easily from the flat. Next time I go to Seattle I wouldn't even consider staying elsewhere. I've already re commended this place to friends, and I would for you as well. Thanks so much Ross! "
1651324,10549581,2014-02-24,613664,Brett,"Ross' place was a perfect home base for our weekend in Seattle. The apartment is spacious, very clean, and nicely decorated (a nice bonus!). The location is hyper convenient, especially for getting to/from the airport and taking cabs (a hotel next door provides a nice taxi line right out the door). 

Ross was a fantastic host! He made himself very available if we needed anything, left us plenty of guides and ideas for what to do, and had the apartment well stocked with necessities for the weekend. 

I should note that the apartment is very close to the freeway, and it's very audible inside. However, it's an even white noise, and we ended up loving it for sleeping!

All in all the place was great and worked perfect for us. Definitely recommended!
"
1651324,10674436,2014-03-03,3457142,Andrea,My husband and I had a very comfortable stay in Ross's loft. It is very nice and conveniently located. We had a delayed flight but Ross stayed in phone contact with me and made if easy to get in although we were late. I would stay there again!
1651324,10963047,2014-03-15,10622684,Matt,"Had a great stay here. Ross put a lot of attention to detail in making this a comfortable place to stay, right down to a hand-written note, since he couldn't meet us in person. He also made himself very accessible, in case we had any questions about places to go, dinner recommendations, etc. The building is older, so it's easy to hear some outside noise, but the view is pretty amazing, and the apartment is very charming. Would definitely stay here again!"
1651324,11146950,2014-03-23,6834395,Mary,"I stayed at Ross's flat on a recent three-day trip to Seattle that was social visit, part job search. For my purposes, the location in the downtown business district could not be beat. Coordinating my arrival with Ross was a breeze, and his place was just as pictured."
1651324,11656677,2014-04-11,8927184,Danielle,"Ross' apartment is very spacious, clean and in a great location!!  It was perfect for my husband and I to relax in after our long international flight.  Ross was very flexible on our time to meet (our flight was 5 hours late!) and left us with brochures of things to do around the city along with many recommendations of restaurants.  I would DEFINITELY recommend Ross and his apartment for your next stay in Seattle.  We'll be back!"
1651324,12294780,2014-04-28,1766550,Lien,"The apartment was in the perfect location for everything that I wanted to do on my first trip to Seattle.  It was in a older building so there is definitely some character, but the bright, airy space was great for me.  I didn't mind the freeway noise because it was more like white noise and I slept great.  Ross was a great host and gave us recommendations on where to go, eat and explore.  Street parking was easy (but expensive) so we found a great affordable lot nearby.  I would definitely come back and stay here again."
1651324,13563210,2014-05-31,11526829,Lisa,"Our time in Seattle was great!  The apartment is located centrally to so many things - we walked almost everywhere, and took a cab the other times for a small fee.  Ross is a gracious host who really takes the time to make your stay the best it can be.  He answered our questions regarding the area and provided maps/magazines/etc. about Seattle, as well.  This apartment is a great alternative to the expensive hotels in the same area."
1651324,13905741,2014-06-08,254898,Paul,"Easy, prompt communication & easy check-in/check-out.  Really great space with tons of windows/natural light/fresh air. Ross is very accommodating and it was great to stay somewhere other than a hotel that actually has its own character. Place was very clean.  Definitely miss wi-fi after a few days (but I knew this wasn't included when I made the reservation)."
1651324,15395829,2014-07-08,13359903,Barbara,"Ross was out of town when we arrived but made sure to put us in touch with his dad, so we had no problems getting into the apartment. The space was clean and filled with lovely natural light, and we were delighted with the location. Our only complaint was the amount of freeway noise. Since it was relatively warm outside, we slept with the windows open and it was a bit of an adjustment to have constant loud white noise in the background. But otherwise it was a terrific place to base out of during our time in Seattle. we walked almost everywhere we wanted to go!"
1651324,15906641,2014-07-18,14167094,Don,"Staying with Ross was great.  He was out of town, but his girlfriend was super helpful and friendly. Checking in/out was easy and smooth. The place was cute and roomy, and well located for the conference center and as a jump point to the whole city. The 5 window view of the freeway was a little less than the advertized Puget Sound, but the constant buzz from the city it provided was more disconcerting. But we didn't spend a lot of time at home anyway. Everything else about our stay was GREAT, accept for trying to sleep with the windows open as it was the hottest week on record and the constant sound of the freeway. But some ear plugs helped. I would possibly stay at Ross' again as the flat was nice."
1651324,16246699,2014-07-24,10032383,William,"We stayed at Ross's apt for four nights.  Perfect location and price.  We walked to Pike Market, waterfront, Mariners game, Space Needle, etc.  Coming home is a bit of a climb but no problem.  Yes, there is a quite an I-5 highway right out the window, no denying it, but we also had no problem with that.  Apt was very clean and comfortable.  We never actually met Ross but communication was easy and arrangements worked perfectly.  We would definitely stay again and could easily recommend it.  Thanks Ross!"
1651324,16573918,2014-07-29,16328313,Stephanie,"The listing was almost perfect for what we wanted, which was: a place to crash at night, a home base in the afternoon and a table/kitchen for breakfast in the morning. Ross had a really amazing supply of tea, a nice room and a huge amount of books and magazines for us to flip through.

We did happen to stay during the height of summer, which meant that the beautiful big windows (even though they had blinds) let too much light in in the morning for us to sleep in.

The lack of wifi might also be an issue for some, but we were fine without it."
1651324,17040737,2014-08-06,14634487,Tanya,"Ross was great to work with. He was very flexible with our timing and made things easy for getting in at a convenient time for us. He also was kind enough to provide an air mattress and sheets for our daughter. The unit is spacious and we loved the old architecture. It was hot the day we arrived and there is no a/c, but it worked out for us because we didn't come home from sight seeing until late. We had to have all the windows open due to heat, which made it very loud inside the unit due to proximity to the highway. It was much louder than I'd anticipated, but amazingly it didn't bother us at all. It was so constant that it was almost like ocean waves while we slept, although trying to talk with each other in the morning was difficult unless we within close proximity to one another. I would stay here again. The price was good and the location to everything was great. Easy walking distance to everything. Don't bring a car though, as parking is extremely difficult and extremely expensive."
1651324,17264155,2014-08-10,776725,Kyle,Everything with Ross went superb. He was responsive and very gracious with his space. The location in downtown Seattle is ideal. It's easy to catch an Uber or cab to get anywhere you need to. Ross gave us some great advice about the places to see and where to eat. I'd stay at Ross's place again!
1651324,18394656,2014-08-26,1586711,Cj,"Our flight was delayed coming in, so we didn't meet Ross when we arrived, though walking into the spacious apartment felt like home almost immediately. The fan was on with a window left slightly open which gave the room a very fresh feeling. This combined with the very pleasant mood lighting made my wife & I feel very relaxed and welcomed.

Ross dropped by the next day to make sure we had settled in, and to ask if we needed anything. Told him we loved the place and were happy to meet him in person.

The neighborhood was nice to walk around and fairly close to the majority of downtown. Plenty of attractions, restaurants, and activities to see & do in a very close area.

Even though the building is near a freeway, the windows are thick enough to block out most of the noise, which made sleeping very easy. I would suggest leaving a few windows open during the day if you plan on staying during the summer, as the building tends to get warm throughout the day.

Overall this was the perfect spot for us, and Ross is amazing!"
1651324,19408103,2014-09-12,5757143,Jazmyn,"The place was clean and spacious. It was close to the work event I needed to go to. Very nice and accommodating host to work with my schedule. Freeway is right outside of the window, so might be loud for those who are not used to the noise. Parking was easy (and free) over night on Marion Street. "
1651324,20422675,2014-09-29,19587018,Alexandra,This apartment is in an amazing location in the middle of everything! It's so easy to navigate the buses/trains and to arrive quickly from the airport. The apartment itself is spacious and inviting. It was a great place to settle in for a few days and explore the city. 
1651324,23695944,2014-12-08,23374163,Brent,Great Apt.  was right downtown in the financial district.  Easy walking to Pike Place and many other bar restaurants.  I had rented a car but did not need to use it at all.  I was even able to walk to my business meetings during the week.  Very clean apt and great amenities.  I would highly recommend Ross's apt to anyone staying in Seattle.
1651324,23992187,2014-12-16,12366224,Mark,"Ross was quick with communications, all was clear upon arrival.  Location was good, a 10-15 walk to the waterfront or the other way to Capitol Hill or $5 uber/taxi.

Nice little studio apt overlooking a freeway and nearby buildings.  Older building, comfy bed.   No tv or internet, but I was able to pick up a Comcast signal, and the nearby hotel has a $15/day option.

I would stay again, now worries at all."
1651324,25355654,2015-01-13,20902973,Annie,"Ross was a wonderfully accommodating, kind, and responsive host! "
1651324,25722253,2015-01-24,22918152,Ashley,"Ross is great. The apartment is nice and was clean and well-prepared for my arrival. Our communication leading up to the visit was great, and the experience overall was very smooth. 

Only drawback of this place, from my perspective, is the noise level. The building is right on the highway, so if quiet is important to you, this might not be the best fit.  That said, it's very close to downtown, so you can walk everywhere. A nice benefit."
1651324,26327601,2015-02-09,23790542,Jordan,"Ross was great.  Made it easy to get in and out of the apartment and we felt very comfortable there.  Place was a beautiful vintage apartment in a great spot downtown.  Easy to get to and catch cabs to/from (there's a cab stand right outside the building).  You can walk to the Market/Belltown/Capitol Hill areas.  

Only draw back would be the noise...it's right by the highway so there is a lot of white noise.  Not a big deal for us being used to ""city-noise"".  But if you're a particularly light sleeper that might be a concern.  That said, I'd definitely recommend to a friend and would stay here again.  Thanks Ross!"
1651324,26677261,2015-02-17,13127168,Robb,"Ross was very flexible with when we arrived and when we departed, something no hotel would ever offer, which allowed us to spend time enjoying our last day in Seattle without lugging our luggage around before our evening flight home.

The apartment was in a great location. It was a short (though uphill) walk from the light rail station that we took from the airport. Pike Place Market was less than a mile away, and the space needle was within 2 miles, though we cheated and used the monorail to save the entire walk. We were able to go the entire weekend visiting everything we wanted to by only using the light rail, the monorail, and minimal walking.

My wife and I were able to cook ourselves a nice Valentine's Day dinner in the apartment. We got a Mac and Cheese kit from Beecher's Cheese at Pike Place and a few other odds and ends from various places there.

I also enjoyed the bathtub. Being 6' 4"", there are few tubs that allow you to fit comfortably!

My only complaint about the place was that it was a bit noisy from the traffic outside. Though I'm used to living in a quiet suburb and not a downtown area!"
1651324,28012798,2015-03-16,27583053,Carolyn,"This AirBnb was exactly as the pictured showed.  It was a spacious flat, with lots of light which was great and clean. Convenient location to many buses, the seatac rail link and transportation tunnel. There is even a hotel next door, so there are always taxi waiting for your service.  One must note that this AirBnB is right next to the main highway going through town. There is lots of ambient highway noise. Also, the thermostat is centrally located in the building, so you don't have controls to turn the temperature down ( in our case the heat.)  "
1651324,28346666,2015-03-22,29063410,Bowen,"Love the apt! And Ross was so nice and flexible on everything we asked. Thanks a lot bringing us extra blanket with the nice ribbon and my name on that. And the artwork in the apt are amazing. Also thanks a lot for those travel tips on the table, great resource.

"
1651324,28601473,2015-03-27,11382515,Kierstyn,"First off, communication with Ross was straightforward and reliable! We had a wonderful several days at Ross' apartment! It was in a great location in Seattle. We were able to walk to the downtown in just 10 minutes. The only issue with the location could be the highway noise. However, we like falling asleep to white noise so it wasn't a problem for us. The apartment was very much as advertised. It was spacious and homey. I even had a chance to read some of the books Ross had around! I would certainly recommend Ross' apartment. "
1651324,29064525,2015-04-03,29522456,Cory,Ross was a really great host available to offer suggestions of things to do in the area and readily available to answer any questions that out of towers may have.
1651324,29921119,2015-04-14,27666020,Dan Dan,"Ross was away when I stayed at his place, but he was very helpful over the phone and email. His space/flat is as amazing as the photo, if not better. I especially enjoys the Asian touch in the apartment, as well as the bike that hangs at the ceiling, such a cultural jam between the two cultures. 

The view in the morning and at night are breathe taking, you would feel very zen with the air that comes in the window. I started my days in Ross apartment with yoga every morning. True relax way to start a day in your vacation.

Ross's apartment are walking distance from tourist favorite (Pike Market, Starbucks reserved and waterfront, etc), transportation (bus, metro and cabs), restaurants and groceries.

I am very happy with my experiences I had with Ross and would recommend anyone need a space downtown to choose Ross's apartment to be so. 

As i took a few pictures of Ross's apartment, here is the link to them.   (website hidden)"
1651324,30491897,2015-04-23,25846770,Lauren,"I didn't like the apartment. The main light in the living area and the one small bathroom light were burnt out when I arrived, making the bathroom basically unusable. The bedroom area windows looked directly out onto the interstate and I found the noise deafening. The windows were open (I assume for a breeze because there did not appear to be any A/C controls in the apartment. I was unable to sleep due to noise and heat and moved to a hotel."
1651324,31929707,2015-05-12,24224145,Christina,"I really enjoyed my Seattle stay. The apartment was great, and the description, spot on. Welcome packet was very informative and even though Ross was out of town checkin/out were very easy. Had an awesome 2 week stay!"
1651324,32149756,2015-05-14,6132501,Dan,"The listing was accurate. The place is spacious, the decor is super cool. The street noise was pretty impressive, but I feel asleep easy. Comfy bed, plenty of space to make meals, lay out your things, etc."
1651324,32679510,2015-05-20,28347917,Chrislie,"This space was amazing and just as advertised. Ross was available to answer any questions prior as well. CLEAN. Large area, close to everything. I noticed many people complained about the noise off the freeway.  Its white noise and not that bad.  Maybe they havent heard of earplugs or perhaps they live in places that are solitary but staying here is all part of the Seattle experience and it was quite lovely. would recommend to anyone!"
1651324,32958540,2015-05-24,26707440,Michael,Ross kept in great communication - he dealt with all timing issues and was always available. Appreciated his responsiveness.
1651324,33654946,2015-05-31,4678579,Kara,"Ross's apartment is lovely, as advertised. Beautiful hardwood floors, a ton of windows, spacious kitchen, comfortable bed and good pillows (a rarity in AirBnBs for some reason!) and an awesome claw-foot tub! Ross himself was very responsive when I had several minor issues and was helpful and responsible. Although Ross himself doesn't have Internet, I was able to get on Xfinity Wifi from somewhere nearby and pay for a day pass - it wasn't strong enough to stream video but I could do email and use the Internet. Obviously you can't count on that, but that was my experience (May 2015).

As other reviewers and the listing note, it is on a highway so there is constant background noise. I didn't find the noise disturbing at all, but if you're used to sleeping in a quiet country home it might not be the best place for you. I would also recommend bringing an eye mask if you like to sleep late as it gets quite bright even with the shades drawn. The building is up a large hill from the water, so be aware of that if you have physical limitations - but Uber is super cheap in Seattle and there's a hotel right next door so there are always cabs. Finally, the building lobby is a bit run-down and often had various odd smells, so I wouldn't recommend this if you're going to be entertaining important clients or something. 

Overall though the apartment itself was lovely and a nice play to stay for a few days!"
1651324,33948044,2015-06-02,1034552,Kate,"Although I didn't personally meet Ross, he was very helpful and clear with directions and how to get to the apartment.  The apartment itself is very clean, airy, and bright! Great central location (15 min walk to Pike Place; 35 to Space Needle).  It is right on the highway, so if you're looking for a very quiet place, I wouldn't suggest it.  However, the apartment is greatly equipped! We were able to grind and brew fresh coffee as well as make a full breakfast for ourselves!  Cheers!

Kate "
1651324,35036466,2015-06-14,1777973,Mary,"Ross's apartment was warm and welcoming, and a perfect place for me to crash after long days of meetings. Although I never got to meet him in person, he was responsive and available the whole time I was there. As he mentions, there isn't any wifi available in the apt, but the cell reception is great, so it's not that much of a problem. There aren't many places to just sit and relax other than the kitchen chairs & one chair in the bedroom, so don't plan on spending a large portion of your day here, but with as much as there is to do in Seattle, you shouldn't anyway! ;) If you stay during the summer or a hot spell, be aware that though there's a nice cross-breeze when the windows are open, the noise from the freeway makes things rather loud. With the windows closed, however, it cuts down on the noise quite a bit! Thanks again for sharing your home with me, Ross! I'll definitely keep you in mind the next time I'm in town."
1651324,35337787,2015-06-17,4934719,Matthew,"Ross was very communicative and helpful getting into the apartment. The building is old and interesting and is very much as described.  The apartment itself was very neat and clean, a big plus. He had a nice note waiting for us and even a bottle of wine to help us celebrate our honeymoon. The freeway noise is for real, but since he had described it already we were not surprised. A thoughtful host. "
1651324,35528200,2015-06-19,3780143,Rob,"Ross and Lauren accommodated me at last minute and made me feel very welcome, meeting me in person to hand over the key and introduce themselves. 

The home was clean and comfortable and matched to description and photos.

I'd definitely stay here again.

Thanks so much!"
1651324,35711954,2015-06-21,19100613,Jason,Thoroughly enjoyed staying in their apartment. It's centrally located and a convenient walk/Uber ride to any of the main sites in Seattle. We would definitely stay in their place again!
1651324,36315569,2015-06-27,9729960,Ji Won,Overall I had a great experience staying at this apt. Ross was so welcoming and helpful. The aptartment was amazing just as advertised and the location was perfect to settle in for a few days and explore the city! I would definately stay this apt again if I have a chance to visit Seattle later! 
1651324,37411730,2015-07-06,31227686,Susan,This was a great experience! The apartment was cute and conveniently (email hidden)d Ross was VERY easy to coordinate with! Would recommend to friends for sure!  
1651324,37803609,2015-07-10,5412820,Steven Jianfei,"The overall experience was great! The apartment is close to everything (Space Needle, Pike Market etc). We arrived around 8pm and the check-on was very smooth. There were plenty of street parking spots (free between 8pm-8am) nearby. The room was bright and organized. If you close the window at night then the I-5 freeway noise will not really be a problem. It would be great if there is wifi and AC in the room. "
1651324,38584477,2015-07-17,18288316,Jerald,We greatly enjoyed our stay in this beautiful space. We rented a car but it was unnecessary as we walked everywhere we wanted to go! Great time!
1651324,39040051,2015-07-20,6415781,Ryan,This place was great! Ross was extremely thorough.
1651324,39909305,2015-07-27,29760699,Mark,"Ross and Lauren promptly answered any questions I had prior to the trip. The place was exactly as described. Clean, quaint and comfortable. Perfect location close to downtown. We could walk every where quite easily. Would definitely stay here again. 
Thanks Ross and Lauren. "
1651324,40366137,2015-07-30,37100928,Kelly,"My mom and I visited Seattle for 3 days and 2 nights. It was a lovely place that had  unique character and was very memorable. Ross and Lauren's apartment was about 8 blocks away from the sites and any public transportation route needed to go anywhere further which made it easy to not have a car. I did not have a problem with the noise but if you are a light sleeper, I would maybe bring earplugs since they live right next to the freeway. We went when it was really warm out but they had screens so we could open the windows and 2 fans to keep the air moving in the abnormal Seattle heat!"
1651324,40810824,2015-08-02,38395017,Candice,"The place itself was easy to find, very clean and convenient! It was a bit hot without any AC but i think it was unusually hot for seattle when we were visiting! It was a noisy if you had to leave windows open. Really appreciated the late check out which was a great perk! "
1651324,41049233,2015-08-03,16054009,Natasha,"Ross and Lauren were fantastic. Quick replies allowed us to book at the last minute and Ross even met us on the street since we were lost! It was great to have a place to rest, and make a nourishing meal. The space is really inspiring and beautiful.  We had fun with just the radio, books(loved the AdBusters magazines too!) and (email hidden)so, the location is right beside the public library and a few blocks from the art gallery. I must also mention the amazing bath...one word: luxurious.  As for the sleeping, I appreciated the fans given our hot summer and missed my eye mask that I left at home(there are blinds, but it's central in downtown, so there's lots of light pollution.)  We are looking forward to coming back the next time we pass through Seattle!"
1651324,42270876,2015-08-12,575519,Lauren,Great location right in the middle of the city. Perfect space for 2 people. Would definitely stay there again!
1651324,43352116,2015-08-19,29879265,Shaina,"We had a great time in Seattle and staying at Ross's place. Ross was very accommodating to our late arrival and very late departure. The apartment was very clean and Ross answered back right away when we had trouble finding the key. The apartment was in a great location walking distance to pike place and the monorail. Also, Ross left great suggestions for places to go to/eat at. Over all it was an awesome experience. 

Thanks!
Shaina"
1651324,44129059,2015-08-24,22736790,May,"Ross and Lauren have a wonderful home.  The place was very clean, spacious, and bright.  I had never been to Seattle before so it was so fantastic to see the guide brochures and tips they laid out on the dining room table.  I ended up buying earplugs because of the noise from the freeway.  But I knew to anticipate that since it was in the other ratings and in the description of the apartment.  The location was great and very convenient to various sights.  "
1651324,44424195,2015-08-26,23126054,Desiree,"Our stay at this Artistic Flat truly couldn't have been better! Ross was very accommodating and the love he has put into the decor or the place is welcoming and beautiful! There were many great recommendations left behind and they even left a local paper for me to find things happening around town. The bed was super comfortable and personally, Ryan and I enjoyed having the windows up listening to the cars pass as we fell asleep. Ross and Lauren thank you for your hospitality and providing the perfect launch pad for our Seattle adventures! "
1651324,44924065,2015-08-30,124829,Isabel And Mike,"Very convenient to all Seattle has to offer, Ross is super friendly and helpful! "
1651324,45278271,2015-09-01,36126185,Misael,Thoroughly enjoyed staying in their apartment. It's centrally located and a convenient walk/Uber ride to any of the main sites in Seattle. We would definitely stay in their place again!
1651324,45444032,2015-09-02,8013961,Chris,"This place is a gem downtown.  The bed is comfortable, and the check-in process was super easy.  The space has a little freeway noise but the views and the quality of the space more than outweigh that."
1651324,45645383,2015-09-04,39690949,Amanda,"Ross was super accomodating, and has great insights into local happs. A good place to land if you're wanting to stay near downtown and get advice from a local. "
1651324,45794278,2015-09-06,6931562,Joel,"Ross and Lauren's apartment was in a great location! We were able to walk to almost everything we wanted to see. Very nice space and perfect for two people. Although we weren't able to meet Ross and Lauren, coordinating the check in and check out went very smoothly."
1651324,46148112,2015-09-08,21943360,Jonathan,"Great host, Ross was super helpful and responsive. The apartment is quirky, filled with art, and feels home-y. The highway noise is seriously for real, but if you like white noise, its not a deal breaker. Parking was a bit of a challenge, but its downtown and was to be expected. I was surprised how hilly the area was, lots of steep walks (or maybe I'm really out of shape). All in all, this is a good, walkable location to all the downtown attractions. "
1651324,46320208,2015-09-09,12418070,Sara,"Ross and Lauren's place was classy and cozy, perfect for our last night in Seattle. They thought of every detail to make us comfortable, from chilled water to candles to great local recommendations. We enjoyed walking down to Pioneer Square and the waterfront, just a few blocks away. We'd love to stay again!"
1651324,46722829,2015-09-13,35099197,Katie,"We had a great time in Seattle staying in the apartment!  It was a really great location, very easy to walk to everything!!  Very open and lots of natural light!  It made a great home base for our Seattle adventures!  There were lots of suggestions for things to do and ferry schedules for the time frame we were there which was very considerate! "
1651324,47286376,2015-09-17,9313213,Gil,Nice spacious apartment.

1651324,48767825,2015-09-28,15695508,Brandon & Athena,It was a quick weekend get away and The Dover was a perfect place to have stayed. We appreciated not having internet or tv in the place. Setup was comfortable. Having screens for the windows was nice.  Overall great experience.
1651324,49248890,2015-10-02,11820645,Michael,I had a great time staying here! Great location and cozy place to stay
1651324,50409782,2015-10-11,21462871,Ericka,We enjoyed our stay here at the loft the location was central to most of the places we wanted to visit so that was nice! The only bad part was the parking but I guess that's what we get for wanting to stay in the city! 
1651324,50736005,2015-10-13,45775482,Kristofer,Historic building with a ton of character. We had a great time in this clean and well located apartment with a great view of the sunrise. Would definitely stay here again. 
1651324,50963317,2015-10-16,4006824,Ezra,"The listing description was certainly accurate. The location is great and extremely well connected to downtown. I was able to walk around very comfortably. The property has a cozy vibe and despite the road being close (as is the case in most major cities), there is no real sound once you close the windows and I slept wonderfully each night. 
I loved the small details like the chilled water, the list of suggestions etc. Thanks to Ross & Lauren!"
1651324,51465855,2015-10-20,17307385,Lynsie,Was in a grate location! Easy to check in. Ross made the stay simple with notes of places close by and things to do. His place a neat and clean and a perfect set up for 2 people!! 
1651324,52148975,2015-10-26,5057475,Adam,"Ross and Lauren's place is a beautiful Seattle apartment, if you are looking to stay downtown it's great. I didn't get to make it up to Ballard or Fremont because of my work.. But it's well situated... One thing that was tricky, and my own thing was they don't gave data access or wifi, which I totally understand and support( but being from Canada I had to use roaming data plans which gets costly... The realities of a digital world) so if you are out of country plan ahead for that... Car2go and google maps.... Otherwise access was easy, communication clear and the space was clean and personable."
1651324,52372650,2015-10-28,11334159,Dawn,This is a beautiful old building in a great location. The space was comfortable with lots of character. The provided coffee was excellent. I fell in love with the claw foot tub. I highly enjoyed the eclectic art on the walls and the array of book choices for every mood. Ross was a kind an accommodating host and we enjoyed our short stay immensely. 
1651324,52705079,2015-11-01,6785724,Sean,"The location here is great for those visiting downtown and beyond. The place is nice and the hosts left lots of great tips on restaurants and things. My only criticism is no wireless. That's maybe not a problem for those on vacation but for work travel, that's a bit of a challenge. Others talk about the noise of I-5 and it's true; however, it's more like white noise than anything. I'd rent this place again but 4 stars because there's no wireless. "
1651324,53071960,2015-11-04,5959001,Christian,Anytime I reached out to Lauren she was always available and ready to help when we needed it. She was very accommodating and friendly.
1651324,53210060,2015-11-06,47505615,Jamie,Absolutely beautiful place . Loved it ! Ross and Lauren were also very helpful with their tips . Great experience and perfect location . 
1651324,53907108,2015-11-14,10778520,Samantha,Ross and Lauren's place was great! Very nice and clean. The neighbourhood was great and they left a list of cool things to do and places to check out. Would definitely recommend.
1651324,54261664,2015-11-17,47101805,Tyler,"The flat was great! Better than expected and perfect for two people. Easy and flexible check in and out. We liked the fact that there was no tv or Internet. Tons of windows with great lighting. There is noise from the  freeway, but not so bad that it was an issue...music drowns that easily. Great location! Everywhere we wanted to go downtown we walked. Would love to stay here again if we ever come back to Seattle."
1651324,54491120,2015-11-20,14037806,Marilyn,"Nice place.  Old fashioned bathroom but adequate.  Just up the hill from the library, Pikes Market, etc.  Street noise was like white noise to us.  Kind of an exciting few at the nighttime highway.  Hosts were swell.  Interested in being helpful but no real help was needed.  It would be nice if they could post a parking map with their pictures.  Went around the block a view too many times looking for a proper lot."
1651324,54902454,2015-11-25,27504638,Meredith,"The apartment was exactly as described! Very convenient to downtown, quaint little apartment with quirky features but very comfortable. It is situated on a major highway so light sleepers may have some difficulty but otherwise I highly recommend it!"
1651324,54961417,2015-11-25,49651446,Jonah,Ross and Lauren were extremely friendly and hospitable. The apartment is just as lovely in person as it is in the pictures. Situated in a great location within walking distance from Pioneer Square. Would stay again!
1651324,55705558,2015-12-04,28844587,Eric,Great location. Very metro. I thought I was in Jerry Seinfeld's apartment. 
1651324,55741435,2015-12-05,36292908,Aubrey,"Great experience! Condo was exactly as described, hosts made the check in/out very easy. Condo was very close to downtown spots. LOVED the list of suggested food/drink/things to do!"
1651324,56090711,2015-12-08,28623482,Claude,"Although the apartment building is older, the apartment is nicely redone and clean, well stocked (even with a bicycle), and right smack downtown.  It does sit right over an interstate, so there is a constant hum.  Ross and Lauren have an eclectic taste in art and books.  The communication was excellent, non-intrusive due to texting and email.  I would stay here again."
1651324,56666871,2015-12-16,21155552,Nancy,"Staying at Ross's place made my Seattle's trip ten times better! It was exactly what it was described as on Airbnb. The place was super cozy, though it rained it was very warm inside. For sure my boyfriend & I are going to come back here when we visit Seattle! "

8072920,49817082,2015-10-06,40325311,Hollie,"Jodi-Ann's place was great! Totally like the pictures, cute little studio. Jodi-Ann was out of town, however she had great friends that I was able to communicate arrival times with to let us in and show us the place. Jodi-Ann had left written info of the neighborhood, parking, transportation etc. that were extremely helpful. "
8072920,57568960,2015-12-27,18912592,Brooke,Jodi-Ann apartment was absolutely perfect. Charming quiet zen. I felt right at home and was able to relax and decompress. She's a great host very informative organized and made every part of my stay an ease. Highly recommend for anyone looking for a neat place which lends itself to sole great R*R. 
4951079,36297789,2015-06-27,26968544,Akida,"I enjoyed my stay at Siri's residence. Overall I had a great experience, and felt very welcomed. The family respected my privacy and allowed me to set the tone for how much I wanted to interact. The space itself is just like the pictures and well cared for. The kitchen, lounge area and bathroom are shared space with other potential renters. I don't think that was clear to me when I originally looked at the room. It's a good idea to ask if anyone else will be occupying the space while you are there. I had no problem with sharing the space, my roommates were friendly and respectful. The location is close to several bus routes as described, but it is a decent distance from downtown. You have to take a 30 min bus ride if you plan to travel to the U-district or downtown. I would recommend staying at Siri's airbnb and I would consider staying there again for future trips. However, I would advise you to speak with Siri first and discuss the schedule of her family and the other possible renters in advance. At times there can be a lot going on so you should be fully prepared for that ahead of time. 
"
7651653,53595912,2015-11-10,4121608,Jill,"Brooke's condo is a great place for exploring Seattle. The home is modern, well organized and has everything you need for a short, or long-term stay.  The bed is super comfy and I slept better here than many of my own apartments!  The neighborhood has a few great restaurants within walking distance or a quick drive (or steep climb!) up to Queen Anne. You're also in easy walking distance of much of downtown and South Lake Union. Would highly recommend Brooke's place. She is also extremely responsive if you need anything.   "
182716,422382,2011-08-05,891013,Marylou,"I had a delightful overnight stay with Barbara and her husband.  The room was most comfortable and it was pleasure to be able to sit on the patio next to their lovely pond and beautiful landscaping.  I enjoyed getting acquainted with Barbara and her husband and was delighted with the excellent breakfast provided.

Marylou N."
182716,427174,2011-08-07,915080,Sandy,Our stay was perfect.  We had all the privacy we wanted.  The room was comfortable and the breakfast Barb set out each morning had just the right amount of variety and she always set a beautiful breakfast table.  The patio was perfect for coffee in the early morning.  We would sit out each morning listen to the waterfall and watch the Koi and the three legged turtle.
182716,441841,2011-08-13,846261,Tim,"Great, friendly hosts!  The room was great, there is a huge selection of breakfast foods and the location is perfect for getting into town quickly and easily.  Would stay again in a heartbeat!"
182716,458065,2011-08-19,857885,Dae Won,"Barbara was a great hostess. We came in late, but she accommodated us without a problem.  The room and the garden was beautiful.  Easy access to public transportation.  "
182716,478869,2011-08-27,773506,Sid,"Wow! Barbara and Steve offered friendly hospitality together with a clean and peaceful environment.  Flexible and relaxed, they made us feel like part of the family but offered plenty of privacy as well.  When we came stumbling along their street from the bus stop on the first night, after a long hard day of travel, Steve came down to meet us and see if we needed help with our bags.  That level of consideration and kindness continued throughout our week-long stay.  We enjoyed quiet mornings with coffee by the pond in the backyard, watching birds.  We were free to come and go through our own personal entrance.  

Also, the neighborhood was very convenient and good for walking, with easy transportation to downtown or anywhere we needed to go.

We would recommend Steve and Barb to anyone -- whether you are traveling for business or pleasure, their home is a peaceful retreat for an excellent price."
182716,490523,2011-08-31,902954,Tena,"A darling place, run like a B & B.  Barbara had some lovely touches, and wrote notes, making me feel welcome.  It is suited  to 1 person.  Home-made muffins, tarts, good coffee, fresh flowers."
182716,499083,2011-09-03,1093934,Lisa,"If you want comfort, beauty and wonderful hosts, stay with Barb and Steve.

This is the true Seattle experience combining the good things in life - art, nature and some really great hospitality.  "

182716,627593,2011-10-14,968214,Heidi,Barb and Steve are wonderful people and made our stay in Seattle much more enjoyable with their kindness.  We were in town for our daughters wedding and traveling with our dog.  Both Steve and Barb took the stress out of having to kennel the dog while at the wedding.  Barb even took him to a near-by dog park and jogged with him. They went out of their way to accommodate our dietary needs.  We were very comfortable in their house.
182716,680234,2011-11-01,1216625,Stephanie,"My husband and I had a wonderful stay with Barbara at her beautiful home.  Our room was clean, private, and really comfortable.

Most wonderful hosts - very helpful to me when my flights had been cancelled and gave me their laptops mobiles phones etc to sort out my problem. Room was perfect and very homely - loved every part of my time with them. Would highly recommend them - fab shower fab bfasts overall just wonderful. This was my first experience with airbnb and I am more than happy to say it was the best experience ever - close to buses and overall everything was just fabulous - thank you barb n steve - it was great.

We stayed for a full week and had use of the kitchen for breakfast, laundry, and our own entrance, which was great."
182716,1313752,2012-05-21,1721084,Sarah,"Quiet, comfortable room with separate entrance.   Didn't see much of them but hosts Barbara and husband Steve were easy to talk to and overall it was a welcoming environment.  I would definitely stay with them again. "
182716,1457607,2012-06-11,2343183,Joan-Anne,A 5 plus plus plus experience. The patio was great w Kois & turtle Bactus(sp??) were a plus as well.  What a wonderful peaceful sound to fall asleep to!!  My Hostess & Host were very endearing. They made my overnight stay of 6 nights a dream.  Please stay here.
182716,1536019,2012-06-22,2466831,Vikram,"I stayed here for three nights in 2012, and the stay was very pleasant and enjoyable.

182716,1628820,2012-07-04,2401918,Mariam,"This was our first experience with airbnb and had no idea what to expect. steve and Barb made this a fabulous stay. We had our own key and entry so we could come and go as we please. They truly made us feel at home with allowing us to use their kitchen and home. They left us nice Breakfast with fruit, cereal, boiled eggs, PP&J, coffee, and more. Barb even cut us up fresh fruit and put it in containers with our names on them when she found out we're going hiking.

We absolutely recommend Barb and Steve if you dont mind sharing the bathroom. This was not an issue for us. The house was so neat, organized, and clean.
"
182716,1681907,2012-07-11,504231,Tracy,We had a great stay with Barb and Steve in their lovely home in the heart of Wallingford. They were very welcoming and made us feel right at home. We were a little nervous about sharing a bathroom but it really was never a problem. They have a lovely back patio with a beautiful garden and koi pond where we enjoyed our coffee and breakfast each morning. It is a great location to explore North Seattle and is very close to downtown Seattle as well. We enjoyed walking to this funky gelato shop called The Fainting Goat in nearby Wallingford and were super close to several good restaurants. We would definately stay there again! 
182716,1931676,2012-08-09,2237038,Aimee,"We recently had the pleasure of staying here in Seattle and cannot say enough wonderful things about our hosts!  We were located just close enough to the city and our friends to make getting around incredibly simple.  The accommodations were clean and comfortable along with a lovely selection of breakfast items.  They even inquired regarding our food preferences and made ""our"" coffee for us every morning.  We would highly recommend this as a place to stay in Seattle should you be looking for a comfortable, beautiful, inviting place to stay!  We also loved the turtle!!"

At the same time, they were very helpful if we had questions about anything, needed anything, or just wanted advice or recommendations.  Barb was also very communicative in advance of the trip in order to help us plan.  As for the house itself, we enjoyed the private entrance due to the beautiful garden just outside, as well as the lovely Koi Pond.  Parking on the street outside was very convenient, and they provided a number of basic breakfast amenities for our convenience like fresh coffee, yogurt, fruit, etc., even offering to pick up our favorites!  Finally, my wife says this may have been the most comfortable bed she's ever slept in :)   Thanks Barb and Steve!"
182716,2674341,2012-10-21,3789702,Scott,"Barb and Steve have a beutiful house very convieniently located just north of Seattle. My girlfriend and I had a fantastic time staying with them.

Thank you for a great stay!"
182716,2780713,2012-11-01,3394915,Jean,"Trust me, you want to stay here.   Barb and Steve have obviously been doing this for a while now, and they've perfected the host role.  They are both very friendly and ready to help with practical issues like busses or the location of nearby coffee houses.  The house is immaculate, the guest room is perfectly appointed (empty dresser drawers, a place for your suitcase, a page with all your possible questions already answered...), and the neighborhood is just charming.  The house is easy to reach by public transportation, and there's plenty of room for parking.  As an experienced traveler, I'm highly recommending this accomodation as an excellent value.  They could easily be charging more."
182716,3523503,2013-02-11,3395140,Monica,"My stay with Barbara was exactly what I was needing for my stay.  Having my own entrance was very convenient and her husband Steve kindly let me put my bike in the garage and they offered lots of great options for breakfast which I was not expecting.  The bed was hugely comfy and the house quiet so yes, all in all I would recommend a stay. Cheers!"
182716,3918786,2013-03-27,2525712,Jennifer,Barb and Steve are wonderful hosts.  They are welcoming and friendly and their home is warm and peaceful with lots of natural light and tasteful decor.  The room is comfortable and has its own entry to the back--feels safe and private. The location is wonderful as well--Wallingford is a walkable neighborhood that is close to parks and the zoo as well as great neighborhood restaurants and cafes. A great place to stay!  
182716,4522944,2013-05-10,6120181,Suzanne And Craig,"Excellent stay with Barbara and Steve.  Room was very quiet, bed was comfortable and there was plenty of parking.  The turtle and fish are a great touch as was watching the local squirrel steal birdfood while eating a light breakfast in the lovely nook that over looks the back yard.  "
182716,5205906,2013-06-18,5551665,James,"Barb is wonderful host and we felt very at home at her place. Barb provided some lovely simple break fast items and was enthusiastic about getting anything we need for our stay.

The room was clean and bright, Barb even put fresh peonies in our room for us to enjoy. There is a small Koi pond with a turtle and koi, it was nice having the door open at night and listening to the water. 

I would definitely recommend anyone to stay with Barb and Steve, they are lovely!"
182716,5827076,2013-07-18,6643311,Ming,"Me and my wife enjoyed a lot for the past 8 days in Seattle and a big part of the enjoyment should be credited to Barbara's warm hospitality and hosting during those days we stay in her place. 

Barbara and Steve created a very comfortable environment for us that makes us feel just like staying at home. Barbara provided very good breakfast for us as well. The house is neat with a wonderful garden filled with colorful flowers where we relax ourselves after coming back everyday. Its location is convenient to take the public transportation and close to many major spots. If you don't mind walking you can just go there on food since the neighborhood is also fantastic and very quite. I enjoyed walking around and say hello to people I came across. "
182716,5943535,2013-07-23,5815632,Ryan,"This was my first Airbnb experience and I can't fault a thing. Barbara and Steve are amazing people and so accommodating. They made us feel very welcome. They laid on a breakfast each morning with fresh fruits, yogurt, bread etc and we could also take it for lunch.

The room is great, with its own private entrance out into the garden - perfect spot for eating your breakfast.

The location was for us perfect as we attended a festival at the Chapel Performance Space which is literally 2 minutes away. Within 5 minutes walk each side you have lots of very nice neighborhood bars and restaurants. 

Thank you Barbara and Steve - it was perfect!"
182716,6070055,2013-07-29,6457901,Carey,"I thoroughly enjoyed my stay with Barb & Steve. They made me feel welcome and were very generous with breakfast. Barb asks food preferences prior to arrival and the had everything I needed to start the day out with healthful breakfast. The  house was charming and immaculate. The koi pond outside the guest room provided a soothing background sound and the beautifully landscaped patio provided a soothing place to enjoy solitude or friends during my stay. Watching the koi, large goldfish and Butcus the 3 legged, 27 yr old turtle was a delight.  
The house is small so if the intimacy of sharing a small space with the owners is uncomfortable for you, this is not the lodgings with the best fit. If you are a light sleeper, the sounds of the owner opening and closing doors in the late night hours could be problematic. 
While the guest room is small, there is plenty of space to lay out and store belongs making it easy to put the suitcase away and feel at home. There are plenty of blankets of varying weight to chose from and Barb fou d a pillow for me that suited my preference.
I would stay with the Parnells again because they are so kind, accommodating,  and generous and the neighborhood and their home has so much appeal  "
182716,6300314,2013-08-07,5663289,Diana,"Barb and Steve were amazingly gracious hosts. They are such lovely people and we really enjoyed meeting them. In addition the room was immaculate, well decorated, and bright. It opened to a beautiful patio. The breakfast was also very good and had healthy options. Would highly recommend staying with them!   "
182716,7664577,2013-09-29,5791078,Andre,"It was my first experience with Airbnb and I couldn't have asked for more. Great hosts, perfect accommodation and amenities working exactly as announced. The room with private entrance is ideal and allowed me to come and go without disturbing my hosts.

I had easy access to public transport to everywhere, but sometimes I chose walking rather than catching a bus just to see all the beauty around the neighborhood.

I enjoyed spending some time sitting around the pond. It's impossible not to relax listening to the water or just watching the fishes and the little turtle. As I used to say to Barbara, ""What a wonderful piece of paradise.""

As a foreigner in a different culture you have to learn how to adapt, but Barbara and Steve were extremely kind and understanding during this process, providing me with a lot of information about 
the house, neighborhood and very useful tips regarding Seattle. More than my hosts, they were my friends. I'm eternally greatful for that.
I highly recommend staying Barbara's room to any traveller. "
182716,13726066,2014-06-02,13497742,Jeff,"I had a wonderful stay in this charming place.

Barbara is a bright and conscientious host; friendly and engaging, but completely respectful of privacy.  I enjoyed chatting with her.

The room is cozy and airy, with a comfortable bed.  I'm a light sleeper, but slept soundly here.

But the real delight is the back patio with koi pond.  The weather was fantastic during my stay, and it was the perfect place to eat breakfast, catch up on work, and read.  The sound of the waterfall also helped lull me to sleep at night.

The private entrance allowed me to feel completely comfortable coming and going as I pleased.

The location was great, too. The 16 bus is just a short walk away and is a 20 minute ride to downtown.  It's a quiet street, but just blocks away from lots of restaurants, shops, an historic cinema.  

Highly recommended!

"
182716,13999265,2014-06-09,15831481,Christine,"For my first stay with Airbnb, Barb's place has set the bar high.  Barb was a great host, and provided nice details such as:  fresh flowers from the garden; assorted toiletries in case you forget something; and a compendium of Seattle travel info, maps, & bus schedules.  The pillow-top mattress, linens, and bath towels were high quality and comfortable.  The koi pond and back patio are a highlight as you can fall asleep listening to the water or close the slider and hear nothing.  The neighborhood was also quiet and beautiful - walkable to Tangletown, Green Lake, Wallingford CBD, and bus lines to take you to downtown, Ballard, & U-district.  Thank you, Barb, for a very nice stay!"
182716,14105483,2014-06-11,14476166,Mackie,"My daughter and I stayed with Barb while waiting for my son and daughter-in-laws baby to arrive.  It was so wonderful to walk into the peaceful and welcoming garden.  Everything in the house was beautifully set up and comfortable and Barb's kitchen was well supplied with lots of breakfast makings.
The location was an easy 5 minute drive from UW.  I was surprised at how close it was.  Barb was very fast and efficient with every communication and such a thoughtful host."
182716,14212904,2014-06-14,10757521,Joe,"What a jewel of a find for the Seattle area, where I travel often to visit my son at UW!  The accommodations were better than my wildest expectations, with the room directly accessible and with view of the backyard koi pond.  Staying with Barb has been one of the most tranquil experiences, a respite from the busy hob knowing of the city.  I can spend a whole day doing nothing but sit in her back yard by the pond!  Barb herself is a super host and incredible person.  Certainly, Barb's will be my first choice the next time I am in Seattle.  Hands down!"
182716,14305004,2014-06-16,13233376,Alan,"Barbara is a gracious host with a lovely home in a charming 1920s Seattle neighborhood close to UW. The room looks out on a beautiful backyard through a patio door which also provides private, keyed access. The shared bathroom is bright, and the shared kitchen is stocked with everything needed for coffee and a quick breakfast. Highly recommended."
182716,14635083,2014-06-23,15686524,Kathleen,"Barbara was a great host.  The house was very nice and clean.  The neighborhood was quiet, and very close to a lot of fun places.  We really enjoyed our stay and our trip to Seattle."
182716,14839409,2014-06-27,3012372,John,"Barbara met me on the walk in front of her home after I made a short walk from the bus stop.  She oriented me to her neat and very clean house, and I was off to the ballpark.  Returning that night, I had a private entry to the bedroom for a good sleep in a quiet neighborhood.  Each morning, the coffee pot was ready to be turned on.  While the coffee was brewing, I put together a breakfast of fresh fruit, cereal, muffin and yogurt.  Then, after a great in-tub shower, I was off for another day.  Thanks Barbara for a great place to stay."
182716,15144382,2014-07-03,5002780,Doug,Barbara was a fantastic hostess and really made me feel at home. Having a private entrance is really nice so you don't feel like you're disturbing the residents if you come home late. The house is lovely and quiet and the location is great. I will not hesitate to stay with her again and will certainly recommend to my friends and family that they consider staying there if they visit Seattle.
182716,15596660,2014-07-12,17343080,Aimee,"Barb was a wonderful host. She made me feel welcome from he moment I stepped through the door. Her home is charming, immaculate and decorated with wonderful style. Coffee was always set up for the next morning, and there were plenty of healthy choices for breakfast each morning.
The absolute best part of the place is the koi pond in the private patio. It was a peaceful place to relax and recharge, and I could have spent all day there. The neighborhood is a great location for exploring, and convenient to both the U. District, the Zoo, Greenlake and downtown. This was my first stay at an Airbnb, and I think I hit the jackpot. "
182716,15827695,2014-07-16,16234750,Barbara,"From  the moment we walked into Barbara's house, my daughter and I felt comfortable and welcomed. The house is just charming, and perfectly located in a picture perfect community.  Barbara had Rainier cherries sitting on the nightstand upon our arrival, which was very thoughtful, exemplifying the type of hostess she is.
She was always willing to help us with any questions we had about the city.
We enjoyed the wonderful smoothies she made for us, as well as the other breakfast items she keeps in the kitchen for guests. And yes, her coffee is excellent!
The private entrance to our room was really a nice touch, as well as the total relaxation we felt sipping our coffee in the morning by the Koi pond!
We had some wonderful conversations, and both my daughter and I felt like we had known Barbara for a long time.
We hope to have the delightful opportunity to go back and stay at her home again sometime.
We could not have asked for more from an AirBNB host!!
Thank you, Barbara!

182716,18654957,2014-08-30,2562260,Bambang,"My wife and daughter stayed for a week in this place. They really enjoyed it. The house is beautiful and very clean. My wife enjoyed the scenery of the garden from the room a lot. Barbara is a very attentive host who is ready to help, she helped them with Uber also. The neighbourhood has all they need, easy connection to bus, groceries, asian foods etc. "
182716,23270783,2014-11-27,23013137,Anne-Marie,"Barbara's home was warm and inviting, just as Barbara is.  The welcome received lasted throughout my visit, and her personal attention to my needs were definitely appreciated.  The private entrance from the back garden to the guest room made for easy privacy.  Her home is superbly located in  the Wallingford/Seattle area and is easily accessible to all methods of transport."
182716,29696359,2015-04-11,29819245,Catherine,"Barbara was a fabulous and most gracious hostess! I loved the bedroom leading out onto the patio, and the house was beautiful and comfortable. The house was located near main roads, and made getting around Seattle very easy. Barbara has a great sense of humor and is very accommodating to guests and their needs. I was sorry to have to leave, and I most definitely would stay there again and again. I loved it!!!"
182716,30470878,2015-04-22,30829001,Victoria,"Barb communicated with me many times before I came, with details about the house as well as freebies for a food delivery services and taxi services around Seattle.  She also had fresh flowers in my room and asked me which type of milk, yogurt and fruit  I preferred before I arrived!  Very sensitive and kind woman and host and great experience!"
182716,30836977,2015-04-27,31628608,Darleen,Barbara is a prefect hostess. She is always quick to reply with great answers to our questions.  She made her home feel comfortable and we always felt welcome.
182716,31389648,2015-05-04,20082758,Heather,"Barbara was a fantastic host. She anticipated things I didn't even know I might want.  The room was beautiful and had a private entrance with the wonderfully relaxing patio, pond, and fireplace.  I felt like I was truly at a home away from home. I will definitely be staying with her again when heading over to Seattle!"
182716,32691400,2015-05-20,9317506,Sharon,"Barbara was the most gracious hostess, ready to meet and pick me up at the bus stop.  She  prepared a beautiful salad and glass of wine to complete my first-night dinner, and gave me a delightful house/garden tour.  House and garden EXACTLY as pictured, with fabulous waterfall fishpond on ""my"" patio!  Basket full of maps and brochures about Seattle, another basket of toiletries for my use.  Able to do laundry, and come and go as I pleased, but Barbara was available to chatter and offer any needed assistance, including helping to mail my packages home! Unbelievably comfortable ""homecoming"" before I had to head home again!!!  Safe, quiet neighborhood, full of lovely gardens and birdsong.  Easy public transport via SEATAC [LightRail] and Bus #16, which my hostess discovered and sent to me prior to my departure.  Being a senior, the total cost of transport was $2!!!"
182716,33184345,2015-05-25,5138192,Brendan,Barbara had a wonderful home. Very close to the freemont area and not to far from downtown. The backyard is amazing. Say hello to the turtle if you stay.
182716,33594210,2015-05-30,32013578,Hildamaria & Danny,What a great pleasure it was to stay with Barb! She was very kind and helpful. She has a fun personality and we would love to stay with her again. Her home is very clean and cozy. The yard with the pond is very serene and comfortable. This is an exceptional place to stay and Barb is such a great person! We would certainly recommend her to anyone looking for a great Seattle experience.
182716,35928080,2015-06-23,1995640,Colleen,Barbara was super sweet and helpful.  Mornings by the pond were so tranquil -- definitely a highlight for us.  It was also fun to be a quiet part of Seattle that is in walking distance to lots of restaurants.  We really enjoyed it! 
182716,36274128,2015-06-27,5340510,Shaoqun 'Simon',Barb was a very warm and welcoming lady. Really made us feel like home. Adorable garden and most delicious brownies! Thank you!
182716,38115344,2015-07-13,31978358,Peter,"Barbara was an amazing host! She had fresh flowers in vases in our room, the kitchen and outside porch. Her house is super adorable with an eclectic, vintage feel. We loved the waterfall on the patio and the coy fish and turtle.  The backyard is so tranquil. We found ourselves hanging out and reading our books more than expected because we felt so at home. She had fresh fruit, coffee with all the trimmings, granola, oatmeal and other amenities!  When we return to Seattle, we would love to come back!"
182716,39078757,2015-07-20,3942417,Gregg,Barbara's home was a great place to stay. The room with the fountain outside was pleasant and clean. Her communication was great and clear. I would recommend her Airbnb to future travelers
182716,45244195,2015-09-01,33038449,Lee,"Really appreciated Barb's upbeat attitude and flexibility.  She welcomed me and communicated everything I needed to know.  Since I didn't rent a car, it was great for me that I only had to walk a block and a half to the bus stop.  Really enjoyed  the peaceful and friendly atmosphere of surrounding neighborhoods and downtown.  Would definitely rent from Barb again!"
182716,50591751,2015-10-12,26641205,Jade,Barbara was a great host! She had breakfast food as well as spices and herb for us to use to cook. The house was immaculate and the koi pond in the back yard made for a great place to just sit and relax. All in all a great experience. Thank you Barb we would stay again in a heart beat
182716,52174087,2015-10-26,2469109,Lauren,"Barbara was warm, welcoming, and helpful. We stayed with our 15-month-old daughter and Barbara made sure that we had everything we needed for both kiddo and us before she left. Lovely touches including fresh-baked cookies, granola and coffee and fruit, toiletries if needed (our daughter ate all of her grapes - thank you Barbara!) The bed is comfy, the house is lovely and clean and the pond out back is really peaceful. We would absolutely stay here again."
3226793,15076685,2014-07-01,14344432,Brian,"This was my second experience with AirBnB on my trip up the Western Coast of the United States via train. My stay with Ravendar was excellent, we corresponded between eMails and text and coordinated my arrival, which was several hours later than expected. Despite my final arrival time of 3am, Ravendar was there to open the door and let me in :-) The listing was accurate and there were no surprises. Underground Parking was an option for a reasonable fee, which I chose. The residence was on the fourth floor with both elevator and stair access. I found this location to be very convenient to everything I wanted to see. Only blocks away from the Space Needle/Science Center, Music Museum and more! I found myself away from the property most of the time but when I was there, it was pleasant and comfortable."
3226793,17914111,2014-08-18,20016542,Kelsey,"This was my first experience with Airbnb and overall was a good one! I was at a work event 45 minutes away and decided last minute to stay in Seattle for a night and explore. I reached out to Rav on a Wednesday and heard from him the next day that I could have the room for Saturday night. We made arrangements for me to let him know when I was on my way into Seattle, and he overall seemed very friendly and accommodating. 

On Saturday morning he texted me to let me know he had to go out of town unexpectedly but arranged to have a friend meet me with the keys. He was very apologetic that he would not be there to show me around, and his friend was very nice and helpful with information about the Seattle area. Rav came back Sunday afternoon and was nice enough to give me a ride back from Ballard, an area a bit outside of the main downtown. I didn't spend much time with him but he was very friendly and open and willing to share about Seattle and his life. As a female traveling alone I was a little wary about staying in an apartment with a stranger, but Rav is a genuinely nice and friendly person, and I would have been perfectly comfortable if he was at the apartment on Saturday night like planned! 

As for the apartment, it is in a very nice apartment complex on a nice quiet street right in the middle of Downtown, and the Space Needle really is just a couple blocks away! There are also some amazing restaurants within a five minute walk of the place. The room was clean and comfortable, and the bed must have been some sort of memory foam, as it was one of the most comfortable beds I have ever slept on! The bathroom and the kitchen were a bit untidy, but not anything too bad, and as I was only there for sleeping, and was out and wandering around most of the day, it was just perfect. 

Overall would definitely stay here again on another trip to Seattle! "
3226793,18823249,2014-09-01,13578346,Kyle,"The experience was wonderful and the host was really warm and respectful. Location is in a very safe neighborhood and there are a lot of nice restaurants, coffee shops, and other places to visit within walking distance. Space needle is within 5 min walking as well as many other Seattle landmarks. 
"
3226793,20463911,2014-09-29,21459099,JoAn,"I had a great first Airbnb experience with Ravendar. He messaged me before I got in to confirm my arrival, met me downstairs of his place and helped with my bags. He led me straight to my room and showed me where everything I needed was. He even took me to this AMAZING Thai restaurant my first evening which was very nice of Ravendar. I did not expect that, but it was very welcoming and hospitable of him. 

The listing description is very accurate in the location, walk-ability, room size, apartment and amenities. The neighborhood was great with local shops and cafes nearby, VERY walk-able to everything. Even a bike rental spot two blocks down. Very clean and safe area. 

The apartment overall could use a good clean/scrub, but overall, I would stay there again in the future. "
3226793,21493106,2014-10-18,21768957,Paul,"Ravi is a great host, very friendly and helpful. The apartment was comfortable. Private room and private bath. The apartment is small, no dining room table, so the space is tight. There's a fairly good gym within the building. And the location is fantastic - reasonable walking distance to Pike Place Market, and other locations. Great cafe on teh gound floor with good wifi. Easy access to good running trail on the water."
7676574,46753546,2015-09-13,41355725,Michal,"We spent four weeks at Karin's house and it was great. She's a wonderful host: incredibly kind, very helpful and always prompt to address any issues or dispel any doubts. She even gave us a tour around Magnolia and surroundings and provided us with a lot of useful information! The property was very clean, tidy, comfortable and cosy. Our little kids enjoyed playing on deck and we enjoyed few BBQs with spectacular view on majestic Rainier. Magnolia itself is great area - calm, a bit detached yet close to Downtown (Space Needle, EMP Museum etc), Ballard, ZOO and others. I highly recommend this place!"
7676574,49075206,2015-09-30,43547442,Liesl,"My friend and I enjoyed a lovely stay at Karin's.  She is a gracious and attentive host and the space is comfortable, clean, and classy.  I really appreciated Karin's decorating taste, which is both casual and elegant (the squashy sofas are the best!). We came to experience some of the Seattle highlights and greatly enjoyed returning to Karin's quiet neighborhood after spending our days in the bustle of the big city.  It was so nice to have a comfortable living space to hang out in as well as our own bedrooms.   There is no kitchen, but there is a nice eating space with a small refrigerator and microwave, and Karin has stocked the area with dishes, silverware, glasses, etc.  Although we didn't take advantage of them, there is access to a washer and dryer and also a game room with a ping pong table.  Both bedrooms have doors that open out onto a deck.  One bedroom has windows that can be opened, the other bedroom does not, so if you're a must-sleep-with-the-window-open kind of person, be aware of that.  One end of the deck gives you a distant view of downtown Seattle and also a nice view of Mount Rainier floating mistily on the horizon whenever the clouds lift from around it. 

The weather was beautiful during our stay, making it possible for us to use the bus system to get around town.  It's about a 6-minute walk from Karin's to the bus stop.  Important note:  it's hilly in Magnolia (and just about everywhere else), so if you plan to do much walking, be sure to wear appropriate shoes for walking on slopes (Birkenstocks are NOT good on hills!), and if you have problems negotiating stairs or slopes, you'll need door-to-door transportation service.  Also, access to the suite in Karin's place does require the ability to navigate a flight of stairs.  

Karin collected all sorts of publications to assist us with choosing what sights to see (besides the Chihuly Glass and Art Museum, which was our primary destination), and emailed us an extensive list of restaurant recommendations - one of which (Mondello's) we enjoyed so much we went back 3 times!  Karin was quick to respond to any questions or requests for assistance.  Oh, and she has a charming goodwill ambassador in the form of her cat, Maggie.  

This was my friend's and my first experience staying in an Airbnb listing, and we were delighted with Karin's place.  We would definitely stay here again and highly recommend Karin as a host.  

"
7676574,54966205,2015-11-25,49817701,George,"Karin was wonderful and accommodating in every way.  The unit is over 1800 sq ft with space and billiards and a huge flatscreen and (soon) a full kitchen!  the deck has a gorgeous view of the skyline and space needle and Elliott Bay and Mt. Rainier.  The home is a terrific value for a day or a week or a month!

the beds are hotel quality and Karin is the most gracious innkeeper for all five of us.  there is actually room for more.

I will stay here again soon!"
7676574,55179572,2015-11-28,50023078,Richard,"Still fairly new to Airbnb, but do need to let you know that my stay in Magnolia has truly hooked me to the Airbnb experience. Magnolia is a fabulous community just outside Seattle, and we found it warm and inviting. The short car/bus drive downtown (...buses easily accessible) was not a problem. In fact the bus ride really made it part of the total Seattle experience.  In regards to the home/retreat we booked, we found it nothing short of exceptional. Very large bedrooms with comfortable beds, great game room, and a lot of common areas to just sit, relax and enjoy a glass of wine. And we were told that a kitchen is currently being added, which will be a real bonus the next time we stay. House/retreat has a deck that wraps across the entire back with a wonderful view of downtown Seattle. It was actually quite stunning to watch the sun come up across the city in the morning, and then to see the bright lights of the city at night. And as for our host, Karin was as exceptional as the home and city views. A very lovely lady that you can tell loves Seattle almost as much as hosting her guest. Karin's knowledge of Magnolia and Seattle made our travels and stay that much easier. A wonderful Seattle experience that we will highly recommend to our family and friends, and one that we will again be taking soon!"
5061566,27299245,2015-03-01,1491268,Kenny,Sean's an excellent host and took extra care to make sure I had a smooth check in. His apt is literally at the entrance of Seattle Center which is super convenient - a short 8 min walk to the space needle and monorail. The building itself is well maintained and the neighborhood safe. Great place to stay if you're visiting Seattle.
5061566,27609723,2015-03-08,9740042,Morgan,"Sean's apartment is well furnished, central and within walking distance of tons of stuff to do! Sean is a great host and was very responsive and helpful with check-in and check-out. 
Great spot to stay for a quick trip to Seattle."
5061566,27947398,2015-03-15,26081752,Sean,Great location and very responsive host!
5061566,28328607,2015-03-22,8268955,Ryan,"The apartment was perfect.  It's in an excellent location, walking distance to a lot of good entertainment, and really comfy.  It's exactly as it looks in the pictures, and I can't think of one thing that would complete the sentence, ""It would've been a lot better if....""

  Sean was easy to communicate with and made the whole process a breeze.  Definitely well worth the stay!!"
5061566,28718798,2015-03-29,1739683,Marcel,"Sean's apartment is wonderfully convenient, particularly if you are planning to explore downtown Seattle. A 30 minute walk from downtown, the apartment is also a 5 minute walk from the Monorail, which provides a pretty special way of whisking yourself north and south. The apartment itself is large enough for two people to relax and to work. There are fun bars and restaurants nearby, and it is also a short walk to Myrtle Edwards Park and the Olympic Sculpture Park, which are wonderful places to take a run or to stroll. Sean is is easy to communicate with and immediately responsive to texts or phone calls. This is a fun place to stay."
5061566,29837232,2015-04-13,13005141,Derek,Sean was an excellent host. His communication was clear and quick. The apartment was in the perfect location! His Belltown neighborhood apartment was right next to the Space Needle and downtown Seattle was easily accessible via the monorail or a quick 20 minute walk. We would gladly stay here again when visiting Seattle again!
5061566,30509162,2015-04-23,29806917,Josh,"Sean was a great host and was very responsive and helpful with any questions we had. Very friendly and easy to talk to, he was a pleasure to deal with. The apartment was perfect for our stay in Seattle! It was clean, comfortable, and quiet. Literally at the entrance to the Seattle Centre, and from there an easy short ride on the monorail to all sorts of shopping and the Pike place market. Sean and his apartment were a big part in making our stay in Seattle such a great one. We would love to stay there again."
5061566,32939483,2015-05-23,2618435,Reina,Sean's apartment was perfect for our stay in Seattle. It was wonderfully convenient and central to all the attractions in the city. It was only a 5 minute walk to the Space Needle. It is also well furnished and the host was very responsive. We had to book last minute due to a cancellation and he was more than pleased to have us and very accommodating. He was awesome!
2268329,10471495,2014-02-20,12113680,Diba,"We had an awesome time as first time guests of Adam and Caroline. We were first time users of Air Bnb, and our stay was excellent with them. Not only are they wonderful hosts but the room you stay at is extremely spacious and the location is key for anyone on the go. Prime location in Seattle, along with a great room to stay, Adam and Caroline are the most promising hosts for Capitol hill in Seattle."
2268329,11221901,2014-03-25,10932025,Daniel,"Adam and Carol are absolutely great. I had to find a place for me to stay during a full month, knowing that it could be estrange to be a guest for so long, but they made me feel almost as a new roommate since day one. The spot is lovely, the room is confortable and with tons of windows and light, the apartment is brilliant, and the hosts are just wonderful!"
2268329,11841875,2014-04-16,4538731,Francois,"Adam and Caroline are really friendly host. The room is large and is located in a very nice neighborhood, also walking distance to 15th avenue, with lots of nice cafés and restaurants. Thanks a lot for hosting us."
2268329,12501881,2014-05-04,13791223,Sofia,"Adam was a really nice host, very relaxed and welcoming.
The house is big and the room spacious. It is located in a very nice neighbourhood with nice stores and restaurants and where all kinds of stuff are happening. It is also very easy to get the bus to get downtown.
If I return to Seattle I will for sure contact Adam again."
2268329,17938178,2014-08-19,4985124,Christian,"It was the perfect place for my final week in Seattle. Adam & Carol were the perfect hosts. Communication beforehand and throughout could not have been better, I arrived late but they arranged for me to come in. The room was great, bigger than it looks on the pictures, comfy bed. I sleet super well. The area is great, a quiet nice neighborhood but in walking distance to so many great places on the hill. I'll be back to Seattle and I'd stay here again, any time! "
2268329,18641658,2014-08-29,10106252,Brian,"Adam and Caroline were both very welcoming, and the room was bright and comfortable. Definitely would recommend! "
2268329,19598909,2014-09-15,8619149,Soojin,"Adam and Caroline were both quite friendly. Their home is located in a convenient location in Capitol Hill, great for eating, drinking, and strolling around. It was nice to have a desk and chair in the room too. I just wish the futon mattress had been more comfortable. Travellers should be ok with a cat entering their room even when the door is closed."
2268329,19986729,2014-09-21,12350405,Mark,These guys were great hosts.  The room was clean and in an awesome part of town.  Thanks again for great recommendations for food & entertainment!
2268329,21845099,2014-10-25,22259705,Fernando,"Adam was a wonderful host, very accommodating. The listing was accurate, and I had a wonderful time. I'd go back there every time I travel to Seattle."
2268329,21935396,2014-10-26,22935820,Michael,Adam and Caroline are phenomenal hosts. They were welcoming and accommodating. The room was clean and well kept. The location is also perfect for getting around some of the best spots in Seattle. I would definitely recommend staying here if visiting Seattle. 
2268329,25756264,2015-01-25,24701737,Navid,"I was so afraid when I decided to move from California to Seattle BUT Adam and Caroline changed this from the very first day. 

They are the BEST hosts ever who make everything so easy for me. They provided me lots of information about the city and helped me to have the most fun two weeks of my life in Seattle. They took me to different events and I had so much fun hanging out with them and their friends. 

If you are looking forward to knowing an awesome great couple and living in the heart of Capitol Hill that is the place you are looking for."
2268329,27609127,2015-03-08,6181360,Swetha,We stayed at Adams place for a night. It was a very simple and comfortable place . we chose this place for parking and convenience and weren't disappointed !
2268329,28112071,2015-03-17,29191247,Ken,"Adam made sure my first Airbnb experience was a good one. I booked his room last minute and we didn't have trouble at all. He had excellent recommendations for local bars and restaurants and sites to see, and couldn't have been nicer. If I'm in the area again I will definitely see if Adam has his room available!"
2268329,28437254,2015-03-23,29286950,Rachel,"Staying with Adam and Caroline was truly like just staying at a friends house! Their proximity to all the exciting things on Cap Hill was just perfect, and while it's an enjoyable walk if you go all the way to the market or waterfront, the 10 bus line conveniently picks up right at the Safeway by their house and goes right downtown. While in Seattle we were sight-seeing from sun up to late evening most days, so we didn't take full advantage of their lovely home, except for keeping a few food items in the fridge, just the bed to sleep in! Their cat, Kevin, is very sweet and will be curious about you, but we had no problem keeping him out when we shut the door and leaned the chair against it! This listing is great for anyone looking to stay in cap hill and be close to accessible public transit and all the shops and restaurants to enjoy on 15th and Pike/Pine streets. On our first day there was an issue with some lost keys, and we ended up checking in later than expected, but adam and caroline did everything in their power to keep open communication, and ensure we were comfortable while waiting to meet with them. Great hosts! "
2268329,30266892,2015-04-19,21112443,Thomas,"We had an excellent stay at Adam and Caroline place! The apparment was perfect, a few blocks away from the Capitol Hill life and 30 minutes walk from downtown and Seattle center: we never took the bus! Adam and Caroline have been very nice and welcoming, and the room was nice and ready despite our last-minute booking. + bonus for the cute cat Kevin ;)
Thank you!"
2268329,34889654,2015-06-13,17738018,Rebecca,Great stay with Adam and Caroline!  They made us feel very welcome and were flexible with our changing plans.  The apartment is adorably decorated and the room is spacious with lots of natural light and a super comfortable mattress.  The neighborhood is also nice and quiet but close to downtown.
2268329,35155944,2015-06-15,3066256,Michelle,"Caroline was lovely and helpful and the bedroom space is a private space at the back of the house and just as pictured.  The location is perfectly central to everything on Cap Hill.  Bed was comfy and the breeze was nice.   I had no troubles with Adam and Caroline at all - they seemed great and we cohabitated nicely.

I do have to say that the apartment isn't exactly ""clean"" so if you have any issues with that stuff, you might find it uncomfortable. 

Although i have allergies, my biggest issue wasn't with the cat - who was adorable and mostly stayed out of my way - but the sloppiness of the cat litter box in the bathroom.  the box is right across from the toilet and it was overflowing with cat waste.  the smell of cat pee etc was actually quite overwhelming - i got in and out of the bathroom as fast as I could.  The garbage bin was also overflowing. The bathroom in general needs more TLC and a cleaning before guests arrive.

All in all, the place served my purpose for a quick couple of days but not sure I would stay there again.  I know how much trouble I take to clean my place take care to make my guests feel comfortable when I  AirBnB my place and I felt like this fell way below that standard.  (I hate having to slag the place because they seem like nice people but it's all in the name of airbnb honesty and I'm sure it will help them improve for the next guests!)"
2268329,36936075,2015-07-02,13098159,Jessica,The host canceled this reservation 16 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
2268329,39934691,2015-07-27,1984992,Shirley,"I had a great time at Adam and Caroline's house. The location is great, place is clean, they were EXTREMELY welcoming, and Kevin (their cat) is the cutest!"
2268329,43409329,2015-08-19,39690171,Christina,"Adam and Caroline were very nice, their cat was also very friendly! Even though we didn't run into each other much in the apartment, they made sure I had everything I needed! The room was clean and comfortable, the place is very well located, super easy to get around! It's definitely a great place to stay at if you're visiting Seattle!"
2268329,44052261,2015-08-23,575653,David,Adam couldn't meet us but made sure everything was ready for us. Henry (the cat) greeted us at the door and we found our room with no trouble. Everything was clean and just where we expected it. The neighborhood was quiet and a nice short walk from almost everywhere we wanted to wander off to.
2268329,45179714,2015-08-31,41224866,Rachel,"This was my first Airbnb experience but Adam and Caroline definitely made it a positive one! My boyfriend and I were in town for a convention, so we didn't see much of our hosts as we were out so much of the time, but they did a great job of making us feel welcome. It was great being so close to public transportation and the room was very comfortable! Their cat Kevin is also adorable and super friendly."
2268329,49446651,2015-10-04,13331789,Barbara,"I had a great time at Adams and Carolines place. The apartment is in a very nice neighborhood with lots of green, a bit away from downtown Seattle. But as there are lots of buses around, it is easy to get anywhere you want.
Adam and Caroline are very nice hosts, I even had dinner and went for a drink with Caroline and she introduced me to her friends, so I got to know a few local people.
Thanks for hosting me and all the best from Germany, Barbara"
6837338,37207879,2015-07-05,3240803,Samira,"Thank you Emma & Chris for your hospitality!

The place is simply lovely and very clean (that’s extremely important to me). We were greeted by Chris who showed us the apartment and shared a few tips with us about the neighborhood and things to do. They really thought of everything from making sure you had extra blankets, if you were cold, to having a brand new fan in anticipation of the heat wave. Despite the very hot temperature outside, our room was very comfortable. They even left a welcome gift, which coincidentally happened to be my favorite dark chocolate and a bag of local coffee. I was sold when I saw the chocolate, but even more when I saw the terrace which offers a very clear view of Mount Rainier! I could really go on and on about all the great attributes this place offers and how helpful Chris had been, but I’ll just say that we are extremely hard to please and are 100% satisfied with our experience there.

Available in the bedroom was some closet space to hang clothes and even fit our suitcase, which to me was a nice touch, as I don’t like clutter. 

We were in town for a wedding which happened to be in Capitol Hill, so this was the most convenient neighborhood for us and we found out (it was our first time in Seattle) that this is actually a wonderful neighborhood! Great restaurants all walking distance, coffee shops, grocery stores, design boutiques and most importantly a very delicious bakery called Bakery Nouveau.

We rented a car so we could explore outside Seattle and it was easy to park just downstairs which I hear is a luxury in Capitol Hill.  Thanks again Chris and Emma!"
6837338,39786517,2015-07-26,998332,Scott,"A very nice, clean, well-decorated  modern apartment. And great views, as advertised. They were really helpful hosts, providing guidebooks, tips, and even sketching out a map. The location was just a few minutes from several bus routes as well as a Safeway store which was very handy. Great experience all around, including communication. Recommended. "
6837338,41788814,2015-08-09,10438806,Cristal,"Staying in Chris and Emma apartment was perfect for us.  The place has great location, is very clean and comfortable. They're prepared a lot of useful information about the tourist attractions. We totally recommend this place."
6837338,42962520,2015-08-16,2718819,Simon,Emma and Chris are the best hosts we have ever had! The room and the apartment is perfect to explore Seattle. They will provide you with lots of very helpful tips. Especially their interactive google maps helped us exploring the city. The location and the neighborhood is soo nice! We just loved it! Thank you for everything!  
6837338,43990204,2015-08-23,24195263,Nickey,"Emma and Chris are incredibly awesome and hospitable hosts. They took care of our every need and even went beyond what we wanted from our AirBnB hosts. 

Their place is modernly sophisticated, very clean, and beautiful. We hope that all of our hosts can be like them in the future!"
6837338,47751810,2015-09-21,8580598,Carole,"Surement notre meilleur séjour airbnb! Chris et Emma ont été de super hôtes, très chaleureux et accueillants. Leur appartement est très confortable, moderne et propre. La chambre est spacieuse juste à côté de la salle de bain privée. Situé dans un très chouette quartier nous avons passé un super séjour, de plus Chris & Emma ont toujours la bonne adresse à vous conseiller. Nous remercions chaleureusement Chris et Emma."
6837338,49774253,2015-10-06,26711020,Katie,"Had a great stay at Emma and Chris's! The house is lovely and in a perfect location. All of the guidebook tips that we used were great, and Emma and Chris were really organised and great at communicating with us."
6837338,51190210,2015-10-18,608356,Cassandra,"Our hosts were so incredibly welcoming! The space was very easy to find from street. The room was wonderful cozy and so, so, clean and well-lit. Emma and Chris had great local suggestions to give and provided multiple guidebooks and travel resources for Seattle within the Airbnb room. They also gifted us a delicious chocolate bar from a local company. We had the best time during our weekend in Seattle and couldn't have asked for more! The kitties were so adorable!"
6837338,53137520,2015-11-05,37743885,Beth,"Emma and Chris (and their cats) are incredibly gracious hosts! They go out of their way to make guests feel welcome and are incredibly knowledgeable about things to do Seattle. Make sure to check out their guidebook! The local chocolate they provided was a nice touch, as well. I definitely recommend them as hosts."
6837338,53401110,2015-11-08,8538100,Thomas,"Chris and Emma are very welcoming, communicating and will do their best to welcome you and give recommendations.
The apartment is super clean and comfortable, you have your private cocoon and bathroom, it's nice to feel that cosy when you're out of home :)
Also, the apartment is 15min walking from 12th Street, which is full or good bars and restaurants, so it's a very convenient location.
Will definitely stay here again!"
6837338,54184358,2015-11-16,29830874,Gabe,"Chris and Emma where great and their place is awesome! Perfect location and well stocked with everything you would need. Listing and pictures are very accurate. 
My girlfriend and I came to Seattle for a weekend trip and couldn't have picked a better place to stay. We where able to walk everywhere and felt like we where going home at the end of the day! We defiantly hope we can stay with Chis and Emma (and their awesome cats) again! "
6837338,55970851,2015-12-07,6546157,Benjamin,"Such a fantastic location, and a wonderful apartment. Emma and Chris were perfectly accommodating and were a great resource on what to see and do in Seattle.

Everything was as described and there were no issues. I would definitely stay again on my next trip to Seattle."
6956301,37235722,2015-07-05,5139757,Darian,"Jake is absolutely wonderful! He was extremely accommodating for my odd flight times. His apartment was perfect for my boyfriend and I. An absolutely great experience, great apartment, great location and great host. HIGHLY recommend! "
6956301,40631227,2015-08-01,35891535,William,Great place in a quiet neighborhood still in the city of seattle. Would definitely recommend staying here. Jake was super helpful and his place was really nice and comfortable. I would recommend staying here if you're going to seattle.
6956301,42008327,2015-08-10,38718847,Kate,"Jake's apartment was great and I felt at home while staying for a weekend from Chicago. Jake's place sits atop a beautiful hill in Queen Anne and was walking distance to everywhere including cute shops and bars/restaurants. Not too far from Space Needle park and felt safe through our stay.  Cable, full kitchen, lots of space, full length mirrors.  Jake was super accommodating with directions and our emailing back and forth. Thanks again! "
6956301,42305859,2015-08-12,2062404,Paul,"My girlfriend and I were visiting Seattle for a couple days. Jakes place was a perfect fit for us. It's in a great area, very nice. The view @ kerry park was amazing! Jake was a wonderful host, even though we didn't meet in person. He gave us a lot of information on everything; smooth communication. We would stay w/ Jake again and recommend you do also."
6956301,42876546,2015-08-16,37329815,Cassady,"i had a great stay here. the place was very clean and i felt very welcome. Jake was super informative about the place before i got there and was a really nice guy as well. the neighborhood was nice with lots of restaurants and stuff within walking distance, and just a short drive from the seattle center. all in all a good experience and well worth the money."
7662775,41522539,2015-08-07,742560,Brian,"William was responsive and available. The flat is within walking distance to a lot of cool things, but it's on a quiet street, which is nice. I enjoyed it a lot. There was a fan to keep the room cool. Pretty much everything was awesome except for check-in. 

Check-in/key exchange wasn't great given how hard it was to get the keys (in a yard a 1/3rd of a mile away on a dark lot at night, buried in the leaves) and the fact that I was told to leave the flat completely open upon check out with the keys on the dresser. If there was no need for security on check-out, then why was there on check-in? 

William seems very nice and is a new host so I am sure he will work through these kinks. Also, as soon as I called him, he was available, so it wasn't too bad."
7662775,41556554,2015-08-07,2611598,Anthony,"William was extremely helpful, generous and flexible in getting us settled.   The apartment was exactly as advertised--simple, clean, and right in the middle of Fremont's busiest area.  I would recommend this listing to anyone who needs a simple base for a few days while they explore Seattle."
7662775,42073485,2015-08-10,2852653,Carlos,"Bill was a great host, move meeting time without problems, explained the rules and allowed me to check in a little later.
The apartment is very comfortable and the kitchen is well stock, although I didn't use as there are countless restaurants, cafes and stores around the corner.
Very quiet and comfortable, loved it."
7662775,42353873,2015-08-12,3370,Andrew,"Clean (if a little spartan) place, great neighbourhood, great location. William was responsive and helpful. Would definately stay again."
7662775,42790429,2015-08-15,40745245,Nate,"Great location and spot. Clean, comfortable and spacious. Full kitchen and bathroom- all clean! William was there on time and helped ensure we got situated. No complaints for this quite spot in a bumping neighborhood. "
7662775,43339611,2015-08-18,40310010,Jen,"William's place is a perfect home base for exploring Seattle. It's located in a  great neighborhood, in walking distance of lots of great restaurants and breweries.  The place itself is nice and clean- simple but had everything we needed with a lot of space which was nice and refreshing. William had shower stuff available for guests as well as coffee and French press.  Also- the bed was EXTREMELY comfortable. Would definitely stay here again. "
7662775,43724503,2015-08-21,6529239,Rob Tobias,"The welcome from William was not great.  At the last minute he texted to meet somewhere other than the place.  We were already there so, he said he would come over and we waited until he got there.  At that point he gave us the key but did not want to come to the door or show us his place.  I thought it was strange.  We noticed right away that there was no furniture in the living room.  Just bare.  This was not shown on airbnb.   Next we tried to move the bed a little from the wall and the bed frame collapsed.  We had to call him to remove the bed frame and bike that was under the bed.  Again he didn't really want us there while he was there.  That night the fuse blew when I plugged in a cell phone to be charged.  We had to call again to have him tell us where the fuse box was.  The note he has in the apartment says not to tell anyone that we are staying there as an airbnb.  There were a couple of other things that could be improved… including a garbage can in the bathroom and some furniture in living and bedroom. The best thing about the place was that it is located so close to the Freemont area."
7662775,43886639,2015-08-22,8235910,Michael,"Great location! Fremont is wonderful to visit, and this is an ideal location from which to explore on foot.

The apartment was spotless clean and very comfortable. Bill was quick with communication and made the whole process easy.

We would be thrilled to stay here again the next time we visit Fremont. Highly recommended."
7662775,44086323,2015-08-23,29851788,Dave Elizabeth,"Bill was very responsive and punctual.  Apartment was very clean with minimal furniture.  Within easy walking distance of music, drinks, food."
7662775,45046107,2015-08-30,40622904,Paul,"William's place was amazing, as was he. From quick turnaround time to the modern and clean apartment and crazy comfortable bed, this was an A++ experience for our visit to Seattle/Fremont."
7662775,45195754,2015-08-31,14613470,Michelle,"William's place was perfect for a weekend overnighter in Seattle.  The listing description was very accurate, the apartment was clean, and the bed was extremely comfortable!  I appreciated the soaps in the bathroom, and the coffee and cream in the kitchen. The neighbourhood is fantastic - lots of groovy restaurants and second hand shops within walking distance, and the Fremont flea market on Sunday. William was responsive and concerned about our comfort.  Great place!"
7662775,45450650,2015-09-02,20332653,Danny,William was a great host. I requested the apartment last minute and he made sure I received the keys and knew what to do. Would stay again.
7662775,46106505,2015-09-07,4629247,Nathan,William was able to support my request on very short notice (within 4 hours). The place is very clean and in an excellent location. Within walking distance of anything you'd ever need and especially great for the Fremont Sunday market.
7662775,47541290,2015-09-20,22694615,Yousef,"Nice home in a great neighborhood. William's apartment is spacious and clean and within walking distance to some great bars and restaurants in the neighborhood. The apartment also had all of the necessary amenities for a relaxing stay.

Despite a somewhat late check-in William ensured a smooth check-in and seamless check-out process."
7662775,48474922,2015-09-26,6751896,Chris,"William's place was well situated, right in the heart of Fremont. William met me nearby to give me the keys, at a time and place that was convenient to me. Thank you!

One thing to note - the apartment does not have a couch or sitting area - but does have a dining table with chairs. This was more than fine for my purposes, but may not be for others.

The apartment was very clean and tidy. Some amenities were provided in the bathroom."
7662775,50154552,2015-10-09,344647,Cecilia,"Neighborhood was fantastic! We felt safe exploring all the restaurants and shops. The building was also very safe, and we slept incredibly well in the bed. It is a no frills place, but don't let that deter you if all you need is a safe, comfy place to crash while you explore Fremont and the rest of the city."
7662775,50414604,2015-10-11,44118240,Megan,"Williams home was very clean and equipped with nessecary items. We stayed one night so we didn't need much, and it's great for that or for the people who do not like to spend much time lounging around. It was in the perfect area for food, entertainment, and drinks. He was also kind enough to get us in pretty quickly. The cafe that we had to pick up our keys at had some confusion with the key cafe company, however William picked up his phone right away, called the company, and quickly got it sorted. We were overall happy with our expierence. Would recommend. "
4235559,35542691,2015-06-20,6863360,Denise,"The home was freshly cleaned, lots of linens left for us.  The home is gorgeous, fully renovated recently with hardwood throughout.  Kitchen fully equipped and accessible to dining area and living room.  Our family had lots of room to enjoy socializing.  View from rooftop deck was beautiful.  All amenities were extremely nice.  Great property!  Very conveniently located for our exploration of Seattle."
4235559,36032611,2015-06-24,21372769,Chao,It was a professional process. The house was clean and sweet. It was a really wonderful experience!
4235559,37468497,2015-07-07,29758070,Bart,"Teal's place was very nice, clean, and comfortable.  It was located close to Greenlake and very convenient to highway access.  We enjoyed the modern finishes and the cool rooftop patio that we were able watch the fireworks downtown on July 4th.  We enjoyed the soft beds and modern amenities, ie; bathrooms and kitchen.  The neighborhood was quaint and quiet with friendly neighbors.  The off street parking was a real plus.  We would definitely stay here again if visiting Seattle. "
4235559,37976366,2015-07-12,3059368,Jacki,"Teal's home was gorgeous!  Very modern, clean, and spacious.  The rooftop deck was on point.  Well stocked kitchen for cooking and the master bedroom was incredible.  Teal was quick to respond to any questions and was very friendly.  The location is (email hidden) a quaint neighborhood, close to the freeway, and walking distance to the lake.  I would definitely come back and stay here next time I am in Seattle. "
4235559,38483809,2015-07-16,2733519,Sara,What a beautiful home!  The rooftop deck was amazing... perfect for soaking up a sunset and entertaining! The space had everything we needed and was in a great location... urban yet quiet.  We will absolutely come back and stay again!  Thank you for helping make our Seattle trip so wonderful!
4235559,41793736,2015-08-09,24915310,Harry,"Home is beautiful and just as described.
The location was a perfect break from the hectic downtown location we stayed at earlier in our visit.
The 3 days went just too fast. We will consider the home again in the future."
9519968,56761097,2015-12-17,38212593,Huamin,"Do NOT rent this house if you are not the cleanest person of all the people you know. The host will ask you for extra money to clean the house. We are fairly clean people but still had issue. The host was not there when we arrived and was not there when we left. Never showed up. However, after we left, he sent messages to accuse us for damage and dirtiness which he did not see them himself but only heard from the cleaner who can barely write English (the host forwarded the email to us). The email was very hard to understand because the whole email was a bunch of words paled together and barely make any sense. The host accused us with this email as evidence.  Lol
The host denied that the bed has smell but it really does, to a point that I do not want to shower before I sleep in it because I feel it would waste the water that I use to shower. Also, the carpets do not look clean but since the host was not there and we could not point it out, and he used it to accuse us.
The host is also very mean. He said he regret rent his place to someone who does not have review, guess what, it is our first time trying airbnb. If you are new, do not rent this place because the host will have excuse to ask for extra money. Even if you do not care money like us, it may ruin your mood. We gave the host $80 as he wanted it desperately but it ruin our experience with airbnb and we decide not to use airbnb anymore."
9519968,56985328,2015-12-20,51374884,Andres,I had a great time staying in this beautiful home.  Paul made us feel very welcomed and was very accommodating.  The house was very clean and we comfortable. I would be happy to stay here again!
9519968,57169042,2015-12-22,8097305,Martie,Paul and Connie's home is inviting and spacious. The fireplace and the kitchen are the standouts and really defined our stay. Location is wonderful and convenient. Communication with Paul was excellent and clear. 
9519968,58592368,2016-01-03,25871488,Ryoco,Paul provided an amazing house for me and my parents. The house is well heated in the coldest time in Seattle and the mattresses are super comfy. Recommend for family stays.
63308,154822,2010-12-16,299817,Carla,"John and Craig were fantastic hosts and they thought of everything you could possibly need when equipping the studio!  It's a great place with an extremely comfortable bed, was spotless and full of great little touches that made it feel really special.  I would definitely stay here again!  "
63308,157655,2010-12-23,206203,Amanda,"John and Craig's Blue Door Studio is a wonderful little place, clean, convienent to Seattle's sights and a great reasonably priced hotel alternative.  They are also very nice people! I look forward to staying there again."

63308,170989,2011-01-16,217813,Carla,"Fantastic little place to stay in the North Capital Hill Area.
This is a great walking area brimming with Arts and Crafts architecture, the Asian Art  Museum, Parks, Cemetaries, shopping, etc.

John and Craig are friendly and gracious hosts. The miniature stand alone unit is well maintained, clean, comfortable, and homey. I loved it. The bed and sheets were amazing and I slept like a contented baby. Among the notable touches were coffee and the fridge was stocked with milk, juice, and water. I can't say enough - perfect."
63308,172301,2011-01-18,346683,David,"Incredible place! The guesthouse is immaculate, elegant and private. Craig and John are gracious hosts with an eye for quality. The bed linens, towelsand toiletries were top notch, and they also provided a number of thoughtful 'extras' - terrycloth robes, a fridge stocked with a variety of complimentary beverages, as well as two large umbrellas and a folding table for our use. This was our first experience staying in a place through airbnb and it exceeded our expectations!"
63308,174484,2011-01-24,337719,Kerim,"Was very very good. No complaints at all. Would stay again and again, if only I had a reason to be in Seattle so often. "

63308,179085,2011-02-07,6033,Cam,"TERRIFIC!!!
If you are looking for a place to stay in Seattle, THAT'S THE ONE!!
Clean, nice bed, tv, internet, fridge full of drinks, parking spot, garden....and more. Better than an hotel for sure. John and Craig will make you feel at home! They surprised me with a birthday cake... Thanks again guys!"
63308,181869,2011-02-14,111616,Megann,"We got there earlier then expected. John was great about it meeting there to let us in. The studio was perfect for us. Very clean, private and quiet. Thanks for making our stay so enjoyable."

Amanda"
63308,185539,2011-02-21,361832,Courtney,"What a wonderful place John and Craig have! It was absolutely perfect in every way, couldn't hope for anything better. It's clear they take huge pride in their guest studio. Upon arrival, we were greeted by Craig and 2 of the cutest puppies around, he took the time to go through the studio with us, and made us comfortable to ask if there was anything else we needed. There was a great printout of the house rules and things for us to do in the area. The courtyard is darling, the whole experience was exactly what we needed. Amazing!"
63308,187572,2011-02-23,363415,Betty,"Hospitable host with a comfortable, stylish and pristine accommodation for two.  We've stayed four times and will stay again."
63308,188097,2011-02-24,402071,Melania,"We felt like we had gone away to Europe unstead of a one night stay close to home...very private, cozy, and comfortable., and the hosts were warm and welcoming"
63308,190328,2011-02-28,278618,Diana,"John and Craig were superb hosts. The guest studio is a great little place; it's beautifully decorated, comfortable, and quiet. There are some nice little touches like a bathrobe in the closet and milk in the fridge for coffee, plus a detailed printout explaining how to get around the neighborhood. 

This place is also a very good value: you get all the privacy of a hotel room with the personal touch of a B and B, and in a residential neighborhood that's convenient to Capitol Hill, downtown, and the University District. 

I almost hate to add to the rave reviews, and thereby increase the chances that the studio will be booked next time I want to return. But this place (and its hosts) deserve the great reviews. I really enjoyed my stay."
63308,192019,2011-03-04,206203,Amanda,John and Craig's place is a great value even at the spring and summer rates.  It is a cozy and private alternative to hotels.  I highly recomend their studio and them.  I feel at home there.
63308,194725,2011-03-08,393482,Adam & Tiffany,"Our vacation in Seattle was very much enhanced by our stay at John's Studio - it surpassed all expectations.  The unit was very clean, very comfortable, and accessible to the entire city.  Our host, John, was extremely accommodating and very friendly.  My girlfriend and I enjoyed discovering Seattle as ""tourists-in-disguise"" because we felt at home in the community (and not staying at a typical Corporate Inn with zero personality).

Our overall experience was a solid 5-stars and we would highly recommend staying at John's studio."
63308,195615,2011-03-09,206203,Amanda,This is an excellent choice for your Seattle stay!
63308,198382,2011-03-14,376221,Kristin,"The studio was very clean and very convenient.  The bus to UW and to downtown stops only a couple blocks away, and there are some nice places to eat within walking distance.  The studio itself is very comfortable, and the neighborhood is beautiful."
63308,200596,2011-03-16,392983,Jason,"John and Craig were excellent hosts. They went beyond my expectations to accommodate me and make my stay both enjoyable and relaxing.  Their guest studio was exceptionally clean, and they provided extra amenities, which added to the experience. If ever you find yourself trying to decide which Airbnb location to choose, and this one is an option, then book it without hesitation. This was my introduction to finding places through Airbnb, and I'm afraid that the bar has just been set extraordinarily high. "
63308,203645,2011-03-20,309549,Kimberly,"We loved the Guest Studio!!  We flew into Seattle a few hours before normal check-in and were able to settle in early.  It was so nice to be able to leave our bags and start exploring rather than toting our luggage around.  Umbrellas, a coffee pot, towels, and shower supplies were provided, along with a mini fridge that came in handy with all of our Pike Place purchases.  Mom and I agree, the best amenity hands down, was the extremely comfortable bed!!  

John and Craig made this whole experience beyond smooth.  They emailed in advance with tips about the area, gave us inexpensive options on how to get to the house using public transportation, and even shared their favorite coffee shop with us once we arrived.  Our only ""complaint"" was that we were able to use the adorable little garden patio right outside the studio because the weather just wouldn't allow it. 

This was our first airbnb experience and I've been trying to plan my next vacation on the site since we've returned!!"
63308,206924,2011-03-22,443688,Dietrich,Great location and studio duplex. Easy to everything. Great view from the hill. John had everything covered. Next Seattle visit I will be back.
63308,210027,2011-03-27,420753,M Violet,"This place was lovely, perfect, and cozy.  John was available exactly when he said he would be, friendly, and the space was perfectly suited to my needs.  For those seeking a quiet & serene place near the action either on foot, bike, or bus this is a great space for that.  Excellent coffee !! and I appreciated that I was able to have autonomy and let myself in and out without disturbing them - I was out quite a lot and late, so this was a perfect little bungalow for me.  Lovely space, wonderful friendly person, who respects one's need for autonomy but is absolutely available if you have need of anything.

Recommended!!"
63308,212187,2011-03-29,411335,Rebecca,Fantastic place to stay!!!  John and Craig really have done an excellent job of creating a wonderful place to stay in Seattle.  
63308,213661,2011-03-31,206203,Amanda,John's Guest Studio is a wonderful friendly place to stay in the heart of Seattle.  I always enjoy my visits there and highly recommend it.  The place is clean and they provide wonderful touches to make it seem that much more like home.
63308,218922,2011-04-06,378838,Randi,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the ""Blue Door"" Studio. It was cozy, comfortable, convenient, and well-equipped. We truly looked forward to 
going back ""home"" each evening after long days of sight-seeing. As a matter of fact, our only ""complaint"" was that it was so much like home that on the many rainy days we had to drag ourselves out of bed because we didn't want to leave. An all-around great experience. Thanks!"
63308,226902,2011-04-15,206203,Amanda,John's guest studio is always wonderful and John and Craig are excellent hosts.
63308,229157,2011-04-17,487674,Dan,"A lovely studio space with plenty of amenities (coffee, soda, and even robes!).  We're coming back here if we ever need a place to stay in Seattle again.  Thanks, guys."
63308,231643,2011-04-19,425959,Tim And Michael,"My partner and I had a great time at John and Craig's beautiful garden studio.  It was a pleasure to walk into a peaceful courtyard and then into the very clean, well organized and homey space. We felt like we were ""home"".  John and Craig gave us great information about the neighborhood and recommendations for places to see and do. We took full advantage of their perfect location to all the parks, shops and easy access to downtown.  We couldn't have asked for a better weekend retreat. Thanks John and Craig.  It was a joy!"
63308,244974,2011-04-30,329861,Douglas,"john's guesthouse was an quiet and excellent place to stay on capitol hill. john and his partner were friendly, considerate, and very attentive. all in all a five star experience."
63308,249438,2011-05-03,376417,Conrad,"Many thanks to the hosts!  It was exactly what we needed, I needed R&R and quiet, and thankfully I got much of that.  The apartment is comfy, clean and quiet-who could ask for more.  "
63308,272919,2011-05-21,379606,Wieland,"John and Craig are the perfect hosts. They were very helpfull and friendly. We got new towels, fresh sheets, etc. whenever needed and there were beverages in the fridge when we arrived,  they were so kind to refill them every time we were roadtripping. The appartment was great too, very clean and cosy, it was everything we needed. And eventhough there is a shared backyard, there is no privacy issue what so ever. 
I could ramble on about the fantastic neighbourghood and the national parks around Seattle, but you just have to check it out yourself."
63308,275446,2011-05-22,588880,Jonathan,"The Blue Door Studio was a wonderful place to stay, even for one evening. As my dad put it, the place is immaculate and we were very appreciative of the hospitality and flexibility in arrival time of our hosts."
63308,277723,2011-05-23,594269,Sarah,Tight and bright guest studio with thoughtful and kind hosts. Highly recommend this lovely place in a great neighborhood.  
63308,284900,2011-05-28,378116,Linda,"Our stay at John's guest studio was wonderful!  The studio is modern, very clean and beautifully decorated.  It is so convenient to all amenities and we were able to take the 49 bus downtown and to Pike Market.  John and Craig were great hosts, friendly & helpful.  We will hope for warmer weather on our next stay, to enjoy morning coffee on the lovely patio.  Thanks so much, J & C!!  Cheers, the Veritys"
63308,290286,2011-05-31,86078,Beverly & Amy,"John is a gracious host.  His Guest Studio is clean, lovely and exceptionally quiet - even with the windows open, it was completely quiet!  It has a super comfy bed with really nice linens and is in a great location with off-street parking.    We really appreciated all the thought and planning that went into creating such a comfy, cozy place to stay. We will definitely check on availability the next time we visit Seattle!"
63308,297790,2011-06-05,387769,Annaliese,"Perfect! This was our first Airbnb experience and John & Craig made it a great one! Their guest studio was more than we could have hoped for.
They've thought of it all for you (including bath robes and even milk in the mini fridge for your coffee). Quiet and private, we slept very well on the queen bed.  And, the towels... The towels were incredible! Capitol Hill is very diverse and there is plenty to do and eat within walking distance and you can easily get downtown without using the highway (which is also easy to get to).  John & Craig were wonderful hosts and very accomodating to our arrival time.  Thanks for everything guys!"
63308,313290,2011-06-14,353817,Patti,"John was a very nice host and the over all experience was outstanding. The studio was true to the photos and the overall privacy was appreciated. I would stay there again in a heartbeat, Mahalo John!"
63308,318417,2011-06-16,635962,Aki,"We had a fantastic time at John & Craig's, their place is adorable, clean, private and comfortable. We were just disappointed we weren't there longer so we could enjoy the cute courtyard.

Thanks for being such wonderful hosts, and making our trip to Seattle a memorable one!"
63308,321311,2011-06-18,682808,Randy,"It is easy to recommend John's place.Great location,nice space,and most importantly,a comfortable bed.

63308,326027,2011-06-21,455865,Jeremy,"Staying at John and Craig's place was amazing!! It was even nicer than the pictures. Neat and clean, comfy bed, with nice linens, flat screen tv with cable, wireless internet, close bus line.... When we arrived, they let us come early to drop off our luggage, and when we came back, there were refreshments in the refrigerator waiting for us, including soda and milk for our coffee! I think the biggest life saver though was the umbrellas we borrowed :) Who woulda thought it would rain in Seattle :) I would highly recommend this place to friends and family, and look forward to booking a stay again very soon. "
63308,335040,2011-06-26,582029,Meaghan,My bf and I went on a road trip and had a stop over in Seattle! Johns refinised garage in cap hill was so adorable and clean! The neighborhood was amazing for walks and seconds away from the bus! John was quick to answer my calls and available for an early check in
63308,347193,2011-07-02,416989,Michelle,We had a great stay here. Easily accessible to all sightseeing areas. John and Craig made us feel very welcome.
63308,356105,2011-07-06,452856,Tania,"We have just come back from our two night stay at John and Craig's beautiful Seattle studio. We highly recommend this studio to a person or a couple who love to discover a city by foot. The neighborhood is absolutely beautiful and calm. John and Craig were kind, giving us a few ideas for our stay, and yet very discrete. The studio is very well designed and the bed was excellent.  "
63308,363867,2011-07-10,566389,Ryan,"The location of this unit is great. Volunteer park, cafes, downtown all within an easy walk. The unit is awesome. I would stay here again in a heartbeat. "
63308,366594,2011-07-11,304031,Sheila,"The Cap Hill Studio was just what my significant other and I needed!  Super close to all the great restaurants and spots on Capital Hill, as well as super close to the highway.  Having a split level place all to ourselves was great!  

Thanks so much gentleman!"
63308,392280,2011-07-24,424489,Sarah,"A lovely, cosy, clean, quiet, private appartment in a very nice neighbourhood. Craig and  John were always available if needed - but kept a friendly distance so you were not disturbed. They also let me use their laundry facilities which was really helpful. Buses downtown are frequent or you can walk if feeling like a bit of exploring! I would highly recommend this place if you want to escape the 'buzz' of downtown but still be close enough to enjoy it."
63308,397557,2011-07-26,443262,Peter,What an excellent place to stay. Very clean and nicely decorated. When I come back to Seattle this will be the first place I will try to book.
63308,408020,2011-07-31,217813,Carla,"This was my second visit to the wonderful blue door studio and as before it was perfect in every way. It was my husbands first and he was wowed from his first view of the private garden and the studio itself. We will be back. thanks so much to both of you. cheers, carla"
63308,425210,2011-08-07,411886,Bonnie,"The studio is exactly as shown, very clean and comfortable.  John and Craig are wonderful hosts offering great tips on the area, restaurants, etc.  I hope to someday return to Seattle and would welcome the opportunity to stay here again."
63308,431431,2011-08-09,689925,Joel,"John was super friendly and helpful and the Blue Door Guest Studio made for a wonderful stay.  The place is small, but clean, and perfectly located.  A quick bus-ride to downtown, or a nice stroll up to Volunteer Park, the neighborhood is absolutely beautiful.  The complimentary soft drinks were a nice touch."
63308,435982,2011-08-11,105446,Rachel,"We had a very pleasant, thought unfortunately short, stay in this studio.  Every amentiy was provided, including coffee, milk, and orange juice for the essential wake up process.  The neighborhood is lovely and gives a traveler the chance to feel that he/she is off the usual tourist route.  The owners were easy to reach and were helpful with making and adjusting travel arrangements.  I would definitely recommend this rental for a couple or single who wants to be out of the downtown hectic scene."
63308,443024,2011-08-14,506163,Paulina,"I loved loved staying at John and Craig's very very cute studio. The studio looks exactly like it does on the pictures. It was super clean and I loved the complimentary refreshments. It was perfect size for my fiance and I. It was a quick bus ride to downtown seattle. They were very helpful in providing great tips to embrace the neigborhood such as volunteer park and the coffee shop. The walks were amazing, I will definately come back soon :) Thank You!"
63308,454812,2011-08-18,470164,Michael,"This is a little gem of a property, and we were very pleased that we had chosen to stay here.

The delightfully private courtyard, a joy in itself and ideal for a quiet evening drink, led into the beautuifully designed studio, which had everything we needed. It was comfortable for relaxing downstairs and sleeping upstairs.

The location we found to be ideal. Parking the car at the studio let us take the bus to Pike Place Market which was a convenient and an excellent way of exploring downtown Seattle without the problem of parking, and also provided a good starting point for driving out to other parts of Seattle.

John and Craig were excellent hosts, very welcoming and ready with advice and suggestions when we asked. On our last night, in response to our enquiry about dining, they suggested ""Marjorie"", checked there was a table, reserved it and then drove us there, clearly indicating our short walk back to the bus which would get us back to the Studio. What a deligtful experience: good food, fine ambience and a patio from which to watch Seattle walk by!

Staying here was a real pleasure.

63308,460161,2011-08-20,652202,Dean,"Superb accommodations and hosts.  Great neighborhood - stay here, walk around and see for yourself.  We were privileged to visit and can recommend this guest house unreservedly."
63308,468404,2011-08-23,386998,Gary,John and Craig were wonderful hosts. The location was superb for exploring a fascinating neighborhood in North Capitol Hill. The accommodations were terrific and we would highly recommend the studio apartment.
63308,475723,2011-08-26,377476,Janet,"Everything about the studio and its location was perfect! My husband and I found our stay extremely pleasant. Both Craig and John were very helpful providing us with written and verbal ideas and facts about the area. Having a rental car allowed us to quickly drive downtown Seattle and the directions that both John and Craig gave us made travel a breeze. Yes, off street parking was a plus. We hope to use their studio in the future when we travel to the northwest. "
63308,526700,2011-09-13,401391,Cecile,I got this studio for my parents visiting from France and it worked out perfectly. John and Craig are very nice hosts and my parents really enjoyed their stay. Highly recommended!
63308,534753,2011-09-15,1119706,Carolynn,Wonderful place! Parked the car and did a lot of exploring - convenient location and very comfortable! Our hosts were very friendly. Wish we could move in - we didn't want to leave!
63308,538882,2011-09-17,211866,Isabel,"Both my boyfriend and I enjoyed our stay in John and Craigs beautiful studio. The studio was clean and has a comfy bed. It is located in a nice neighborhood, just minutes to many points of interest. Highly recommend. "
63308,541931,2011-09-18,27480,Won,"John's apartment is really lovely! It's in Capitol Hill in a nice neighbourhood. Apartment is clean, save and perfect for a couple. We definitely recommend it!"
63308,549149,2011-09-20,29855,Harlan,"Charming cottage with a sapacious sleeping loft. The rental is separated from the main house with a flower filled court yard.  The hosts were very accomadating when our son and his girl friend showed up unexpectedly from Vancouver and were allowed to stay in the cottage on a fold out couch with sheets, etc. supplied by the hosts.  The cottage wes also clean and well maintained, as well as located in a charming residential neighborhood just north of Volunteer Park.  I would stay here again if returning to Seattle.  Thanks, John and Craig."
63308,588639,2011-10-02,193212,Camilla,"My friend and I stayed at the guest studio for 3 nights and were thoroughly pleased with our stay! The place was neat and comfortable and John and Craig were super friendly and made sure we got settled in alright.
The downtown area was a quick bus ride away and we can highly recommend the food tours around Pike Place Market!"
63308,598807,2011-10-04,1191253,Tara,We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and the Blue Door Guest Studio. John and Craig were very accommodating. They had lost of information regarding the neighborhood. The studio was well kept and the local coffee was a lovely touch.  
63308,613938,2011-10-10,998686,Bradley,Beautiful studio and great hosts. Genuine and helpful during my first trip to Seattle. Amazing area of the city. Definitely left me with a feeling that i could live there. Capitol Hill should not be missed. Thank you John and Craig for the opportunity.
63308,625063,2011-10-13,355522,Dennis,"John's detached studio was an absolute delight, clean and tidy and a short walk to a large restaurant and shopping area.  It was also situated in a lovely suburb where it felt safe to walk around at night. John was also very helpful and friendly and we would thoroughly recommend his studio to anyone."
63308,634050,2011-10-16,1254144,Shamina,"I love the space! John was there to greet me when I arrived to his home in Capital Hill, which is by the way is so beautiful. The area have unique and beautiful landscaping. Capital Hill have a lot of dining options and shopping for anything you're looking for. John was so helpful in giving me so much info on the room, the area and was there when I needed the used of his vaccum cleaner for my space bag. Chris gives me my space which I needed because I had to use the laptop to do my errands. I'll definitely be back next year when I come back to Seattle! I wish I got to meet Chaig. He probadly just so nice so John!"
63308,638508,2011-10-17,1244335,Jean,The studio is quiet and comfortable with complimentary beverages provided. The bed is wonderfully comfortable and inviting. The location is excellent with a bus stop just down the street and a nice cafe just a few minutes down the street. I would absolutely stay here again and recommend it to anyone coming to the area in need of a place to stay.
63308,644347,2011-10-19,557347,Devlen,"Very cute! Wonderful location in Capitol Hill. So many parks and fabulous places to eat nearby. Our hosts were very gracious, amiable,  and knowledgeable. Plenty of privacy and very secure."
63308,694801,2011-11-06,343066,Serena,"This guest studio is in a lovely neighbourhood with oodles of charm. John & Craig welcomed us when we arrived, and were very informative about the studio itself, as well as the area. They provide lots of literature on Seattle, as well as its main attractions. The main commercial hub of Broadway East (lots of nice cafes and restaurants) is about a 25 min walk away - a nice walk as you get to see all of the characterful houses in the area. Alternatively, you can take the 49 bus which takes you there in less than 10 min, and if you stay on, it takes you all the way downtown to Pike Place Market. 

We had a great time in Seattle, made even better thanks to John & Craig's eye for detail - we pretty much had everything we needed!"
63308,710320,2011-11-11,1371627,Randall,"Had a great stay in this well-appointed studio. The location is 
terrific, in a beautiful, historic neighborhood, close to four distinct dining districts, and an easy bus trip downtown."
63308,729740,2011-11-19,347739,Kevin,"This was the best place I've stayed within Airbnb (or VRBO for that matter). John was extremely helpful and hospitable. The apt was detached from the house for full privacy, ultra clean and perfect for a stay in Seattle. It was cozy and comfortable and I would definitely stay here again if I return to Seattle."
63308,732914,2011-11-21,874303,Louise Dolores,"We had a lovely two-night stay this past week. The residential neighborhood is beautiful too and we found a down-home pub, Raonoke, a few blocks away. A good walk to Voluneer Park and the Seattle Asian Art museum, and then to an excellent brunch at Smith on 15th. 

The studio is cozy and a great bargain. The most comfortable sheets we remember sleeping on. John was welcoming and helpful."
63308,748327,2011-11-28,1029952,Sandee,"john and craig have a wonderful studio and they made us feel very welcome.  everything was charming, clean and comfortable, including the bed.  we will stay here again when we return to seattle.
"
63308,765908,2011-12-05,302697,Sheryl,"We stayed one night and absolutely loved it. John was a great host and was very accommodating!  The guest studio was perfect for a night stay, great location, and very comfortable. I love the blue doors! I would highly recommend staying here,"
63308,771781,2011-12-08,600025,Carl,"Our stay was very comfortable and located in an ideal area for exploring the city. John has done a great job of decorating. Thanks for having us we hope to be back.

"
63308,776662,2011-12-11,1377234,Allison,"John and Craig were gracious hosts during our three-night stay at the blue door guest studio.  The studio was exactly as described, and we especially appreciated the extra touches like complimentary beverages and information about the area.  We enjoyed being within walking distance to several shops, restaurants and pubs.  Would stay again."
63308,857982,2012-01-12,1418162,Mark,John and Craig were great hosts.  They were very accommodating when we were delayed in getting to the suite and made us feel very welcome.  The place is great for those that want easy access to Downtown and the University District but prefer not to be stuck in the city.  The suite had everything we needed and was very private.  A great place for a couple to stay and very good value for money. 
63308,872852,2012-01-20,542287,Erin,"The Blue Door Guesthouse is an absolutely perfect base of operations for any Seattle adventure. The studio itself is private, secure, comfortable, has lots of natural light, and a lovely modern ""European Pension"" feel to it.  We were there for a week during the big snowstorm and were just as happy to stay in and relax at our home away from home as to go out! When we venture out, we were able to easily get to friends who lived in various neighborhoods (Eastlake, Wedgwood, UDistric, GreenLake, etc.) from the studio's prime location. It's a great walking neighborhood, with Volunteer Park and Broadway nearby, not to mention great little cafes and coffee shops-- ask John and Craig for their local favorite (somewhat hidden) gems.  We also enjoyed the modern comforts of microwave and min-fridge that allowed us to eat the occasional meal in. John and Craig are delightful hosts and we felt very well taken care of, with lots of privacy, security, beauty, convenience (including precious off-street parking), and home-y-ness. We'd definitely stay there again, and recommend that anyone looking for a great weekend or longer-term stay skip the hotels and head straight for the Blue Door!"
63308,880001,2012-01-23,51598,Christine,"Amazing hospitality! I've always had good experiences with Airbnb hosts, but John and Craig really went above and beyond. They thought of every detail to make my short stay very comfortable. As another review stated, they are perfect hosts. Overall, a wonderful place and I hope to stay again."
63308,894107,2012-01-31,1574911,Hannah,"Absolutely perfect hosts! We had a wonderful time in Seattle and we loved coming home to this snug, clean, comfortable space every day. The studio is light, well equipped (everything we could possibly have needed from robes to cotton buds to pens and paper and even a guidebook) and the bed is amazing. The location is great; quiet and secure and very convenient for bus travel into town (or  to walk - it's all downhill on the way in!). We really appreciated the fridge filled with complimentary beverages and the extra touches of kindness from our hosts. I don't think it's a question of if we'll be back, it's more a question of when . . . can't imagine finding anywhere we'd rather stay."
63308,900927,2012-02-04,436828,Steve And Michael,"Darling tiny separate apartment in a great location, and included parking. Comfy bed, super clean and toasty warm in the cold weather. Wonderful walking neighborhood, cafes, pubs and parks are a joy. Excellent hosts, met us at the appointed time, showed us the details. We'll definitely go back again."
63308,921988,2012-02-14,1164800,Thalia,"John's guest studio is terrific. It's spotlessly clean and comfortable, with a very comfortable queen bed and many amenities (shampoo/conditioner, soap, water/OJ in the fridge, even a hair dryer which I had forgotten at home!). Towels were fluffy and bed linens were very nice. It's spacious, private, and includes a parking spot - making it a wonderful alternative to staying in a local hotel. Highly recommend, and can't wait to come back!"
63308,941376,2012-02-22,1645068,Lijo,The loft was great. We stayed for 4 days. John and Craig were excellent hosts who made the experience smooth. I highly recommend this place if staying in the area.
63308,948458,2012-02-26,1609520,Rachel,"Due to some nasty weather, we arrived a day later than we expected, but when we were finally able to get there, we were very happy.  J and C were wonderful hosts.  The lodging was comfy and clean and we were so thrilled with the little things, .. Fresh ground coffee, milk, orange juice, water and soft drinks.  Beautiful neighborhood with beautiful homes.  Conveniently located.  Highly recommended! "
63308,953350,2012-02-27,500385,Erin,"I can't say much more than what's already been said! The studio was great—cozy and well-kept—and John and Craig were very helpful. They were even able to accommodate last-minute changes to our check-in time, which we appreciated."
63308,976258,2012-03-06,1758251,Deidre,"I absolutely loved staying at John and Craig's ""Guest House""!!!

63308,987994,2012-03-11,1659986,Matthew,"The guys had the perfect balance of friendly and hospitable vs privacy, was hosted by them for 3 days and it was everything that i needed, would definitely stay again :)"
63308,1008066,2012-03-17,42441,Maurice,Randy and I had a wonderful time staying at the guest studio hosted by John and Craig.  They were very accomodating- making our stay very comfortable.  The facilities were clean and up-to-date.   The area was peaceful and quiet which made our trip relaxing.  There are good restaurants and a coffee shop within walking distance.  I definitely recommend staying here to anyone visiting Seattle.  We hope to stay here again in the future!

They were friendly and helped us plan a wonderful 4 days in Seattle. This was our first airbnb and it was great."
63308,1126687,2012-04-14,217813,Carla,"We are return visitors to this really amazing hidden unit which is in a great location close to public transportation, museum, parks, and is a superb walking area. We can not say enough good things about this place and the hosts, John and Craig. They are incredibly gracious and keep a spotless unit. If you have any questions they are quick to respond. Sadly it will be our last as we are moving to Seattle. If you
have happened upon this unit consider yourself fortunate. It really is the best! Carla and Ben"
63308,1138677,2012-04-16,1268013,Corey,"The place is fantastic. It has anything you need, it's got a lot of room, in a great area and John and Craig leave you with orange juice, water and a few sodas to get started. "

63308,1283986,2012-05-15,1420487,Yulia,"Place exactly as described! Although we arrived very late, we were greeted at the door and shown around, and what's more important, never bothered during our stay! Thank you, would definitely recommend to friends."
63308,1290387,2012-05-16,460734,Phil,"Great place and perfect for us, quiet neighboehood and off street parking which I always look for.  Apartment is as shown and described on web site, real comfortable and a nice patio to have a drink and visit with our daughter.  Will definitely stay again on our next trip to Seattle."
63308,1300107,2012-05-18,1729860,Damian,"John and Greg have a beautiful guest studio in a lovely part of Seattle.  The studio is very neat, clean and attractively furnished and sits next to a sweet courtyard garden.  The neighborhood is really beautiful and felt very safe.  As I did not have a car, it was great to be able to easily access public transport to downtown. The local neighborhood is certainly worth seeing with Volunteers Park close by and a great strip of shops, restaurants and cafes etc a nice 5 minute walk away."
63308,1313856,2012-05-21,1747832,Robyn,"John and Craig were very helpful in not only providing fun activities and places to visit or dine in the area, but they also answered any questions we had. This studio is one of the most beautiful places to stay where the atmosphere is calm and welcoming."
63308,1328784,2012-05-22,2120977,Dianah,"This is an upscale guest house with beauitiful decor, top-rate cleanliness, friendly and helpful hosts and a beautiful neighborhood.  I rested fully after a long work week thanks to the yummy bedding, the quiet, and the cozy yet elegant setting.  Many thanks, Craig and John!"
63308,1341839,2012-05-24,546569,Cynthia,"This is a cozy guesthouse with a comfy bed that features very clean and comfortable linens. John is a very conscientious and thoughtful host. He gave us full instructions on how everything works, and then left us to ourselves to enjoy our stay. "
63308,1349436,2012-05-26,1311343,Matt And Elham,"This is a great value.  We didn't get to meet John, but Craig was a great host and he was so generous in offering to take us way out of his way to our port where we departed for our cruise.  We REALLY appreciated that!!  Otherwise, our favorite thing about this place was the killer location!!! It is in such a gorgeous neighborhood right next to the lovely Volunteer Park and delicious Volunteer Park cafe.  We really enjoyed exploring the area and went for a great run one morning. The little studio was a perfect size for the 2 of us and had just what we needed.  "
63308,1358691,2012-05-27,1520468,Toby,This is my first Airbnb experience. My girlfriend and I stayed at John and Craig's studio for one night in Seattle. It's really a great place with a very nice neighborhood. Will definitely try to stay here when next time we are in town. And highly recommend this place to others who travel to Seattle. 
63308,1381285,2012-05-30,1273975,Kim,"My boyfriend and I had a wonderful stay! John and Craig were very accommodating and I can't say enough good things about this place! It was very well kept, clean and located in a great area. They even stocked our fridge with some beverages! I would definitely recommend staying here. "
63308,1417741,2012-06-05,1731596,Bob,"Excellent Host, Excellent Location! 
Craig met us at our scheduled arrival time. The Blue Door Studio is a neat space with sitting area and restroom downstairs and the bedroom upstairs. The studio has everything one could desire, microwave, coffee maker, plates, glasses, wine opener etc..  The ceiling fan kept the rooms nice and cool. The courtyard was wonderful, full of beautiful plants and flowers and a nice table with chairs. We ate breakfast outside twice and dined alfresco one night! We found out that the off street parking space was a big plus as parking in the area was limited. The Capitol Hill neighborhood was quaint and friendly with lot's of nice small pubs and diners. Craig and John provided great suggestions on places to go and see and eat and drink at ! They even went out and got my wife a small birthday cake to help us celebrate her day! Wonderful hosts with a wonderful location. We highly recommend it and will visit again someday ourselves."
63308,1454644,2012-06-11,400363,Susan,"Fabulous location, beautiful neighborhood, charming, helpful hosts, quiet, private and peaceful ientry garden courtyard, studio has an attractive interior decor. Studio is very small and bathroom is not on the same floor as the bedroom. Overall a Good value."
63308,1480761,2012-06-14,2451310,Susan,"I stayed in the Guest Studio - Capitol Hill for three nights. It was quite perfect: great location, off road parking, independant entrance, comfortable surroundings (exactly as it appesrs in the photos), excellent wifi connection. 
I was met by Craig, who gave me a tour of the studio, making me feel very much at home, and was then completely independent. There were great information sheets and a useful collection of guide books & pamflets for my use. 10 mins by car to the downtown, harbor area or an easy 25 min bus ride made the location ideal. There is also the advantage of being in the beautiful Capitol Hill district near to Volunteer Park; lots of opportunities for walking locally. I am hoping to be in the area again nect year & will defintively stay here again. The bed was very comfortable with the finest bed linens giving a luxurious feel to the experience! 
Thank you John & Craig!
"
63308,1528099,2012-06-21,1509231,Edgar,"Fantastic Guest house John & Craig have. I was first greeted by Craig when first arriving. I got there around 7pm which he was more an accommodating with such a later checkin. Craig gave me a tour of the Guest House & had drinks waiting for me in the fridge. That alone made me feel great about booking with them already.  I wasn't aware how close everything was to the location but once I did, I was very happy.   The guest house was very clean when I got there and also the Bed & Sheets, they were to die for! I sometimes didn't want to get out of bed because of how comfy everything was. I will for sure book with them again in the future. Thanks Guys! -edgar-
"
63308,1688256,2012-07-12,401391,Cecile,My parents really enjoyed the guest studio. That was their second experience there and they will probably book it again next time they come in Seattle. They loved the nice and quiet area and thought John and Craig were excellent hosts...
63308,1759741,2012-07-21,2297476,Ashleigh,"I stayed at the studio for 9 nights while taking a course at UW and had a wonderful stay. The studio was compact but very well laid out, the bed was super comfortable, and it was easy to meet up with the hosts to get the key when I first arrived. It was a convenient bus ride/nice walk to the campus and the neighborhood was great. I had a great time exploring the area and would absolutely stay there again if I had the opportunity."
63308,1815814,2012-07-27,2993831,Mick,"Very comfortable place. I was there for one night for a business trip. Everything worked out perfect. The place is clean, spacious and centrally located. I couldn't ask for a better hosts. Would love to go back and stay there again soon."
63308,1856969,2012-08-01,1794842,Karen,Location was great. Very clean and private. John and Craig were very friendly and helpful with all of our questions about the Seattle area. Loved our stay and we would definitely recommend it and will go back if we get the chance. 
63308,1889511,2012-08-05,90432,Lorrie-Ann,"Staying in John and Craig's studio was an A++ experience. Their entire property is gorgeous, well maintained and it was a pleasure to ""come home"" to the lovely, clean and quaint studio. John also graciously accommodated our early arrival. The location is safe, central and totally walkable. Highly recommended. You won't be disappointed. Thank you, John and Craig for a fantastic stay!"
63308,1913945,2012-08-07,1611854,Andy,Awesome private space in a great part of town! Craig was very helpful helped getting us situated at the blue door studio. Bed was comfy and everything was clean and well kept. We had a great time and would recommend highly for a Seattle stay.
63308,1938338,2012-08-10,1918502,Jacqueline,"This was my husband and my first experience using airbnb and we were more than satisfied. John and Craig were excellent hosts. They gave us wonderful recommendations for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, all of which we tried, were excellent and made our experience in Seattle that much more special. The apartment was great as well - clean, with a comfortable bed in a perfect location. We would definitely stay again! "
63308,1952015,2012-08-11,3078132,Heather,Gorgeous courtyard and super sweet cottage with loft. Hosts were warm and friendly. What a wonderful place to stay!
63308,2044978,2012-08-20,1659986,Matthew,"This is the second time Andy and I have stayed with John and Craig, and though it was just a short stay for a weekend getaway, it was exactly what we needed, and was just great. I'm sure we will stay again in the future :)"
63308,2127480,2012-08-28,179396,Lili,"What a wonderful stay we had in Seattle! John and Craig's Guest Studio had everything we needed for our short stay: a VERY comfortable bed with high-quality linens, privacy, quiet for a good night's sleep, and a great location. The suite was stocked with coffee, soda, bottled water, orange juice. In the bathroom we found a fresh soap bar, shampoo and conditioner. We are definitely coming back on future trips to Seattle and recommend it to our friends. 5 stars all around!"
63308,2167912,2012-09-02,1775156,Linda,"Our stay in John’s studio was very nice. It was easy to find and the neighbourhood was beautiful and peaceful. We had a very warm welcome by John, who also took the time to show us the studio and gave us many suggestions for transportation, dining and sightseeing in Seattle.  John also handed out these suggestions (and more), written down on paper which was very useful! We found a great suggestion for a terrific restaurant, within a 5 minute walk.
We were surprised to find the complementary (cold!) drinks in the fridge and also the shampoo, soap and conditioner in the shower. 
We had a great stay during our three nights and felt right at home!
"
63308,2221533,2012-09-07,2916342,Laura,"We had an amazing stay at John and Craigs guest studio in Capitol Hill! The studio was clean and felt very homely! Drinks, coffee and other essentials were already waiting for us in the fridge which helped with a very warm welcoming. Besides, there were tons of information about the area and Seattle in general and it felt like we could have always asked John and Craig for more advise if we needed to. All in all the perfect place for a great stay in Seattle!"
63308,2380040,2012-09-23,3043262,Julia,"This studio apartment was perfect for our visit to Seattle - very clean, comfortable, well outfitted and in an awesome location with easy access to city highlights. The hosts were responsive, informative and kind, and very easy to work with. Everything was as advertised. Would definitely recommend!"
63308,2617764,2012-10-15,3630572,Debra,"My stay at John and Craig's studio was wonderufl in so many ways.  The studio is in great location in North Capitol Hill near parks and transportation but also gives you a place of quiet in their wonderful studio situated within a cute courtyard.  The studio is decorated beautifully, very clean and comfortable bed. (love the linens) John and Craig stock the fridge with just the right things to get you started (enjoyed the Lladro coffee and actaully bought some in Queen Anne)  I truly felt it was like coming home after visiting the city and felt safe and cozy in the second floor sleeping area.  I always felt  that John and Craig were there if I needed them but they also give you your privacy..  They helped me with my internet connection and an added night to stay.  Great communcation on transportation and places to go.  When closing the door to leave, I really felt a sense that I'd miss my own little studio in Seattle.  What a great place and thoughtful hosts.  I wouldn't stay anywhere else.  Pure bliss!  Thank you John and Craig for providing a serene oasis in beautiful Seattle!"
63308,2664773,2012-10-20,3700593,Regina,"Fabulous location and beautiful studio that is very private.  It was great to have the microwave, fridge and coffeepot, as well as 2 levels so that one of us could read while the other watched TV.  The only reason it doesn't bump up to a 5 is that the internet was sometimes sporadic.  I needed that regularly for work, so it was sometimes a challenge when it would fade out when I was in the middle of something."
63308,2674387,2012-10-21,3792914,Daniel,"For my first AirBnB experience it was definitely above and beyond what I expected. John was very hospitable and welcomed us despite a late arrival. The place had everything we could ever need, which included towels and some drinks in the fridge. The location was perfect and easily accessible to downtown. I highly highly recommend anyone planning a trip to Seattle to check this place."
63308,2711214,2012-10-24,1153163,Doug,"John was a wonderful, helpful host, and the Guest Studio was fantastic.  Super clean, private, very comfortable and relaxing.  Loved the luxurious sheets, pillows, bedding and towels.  We had a very restful night.  The neighborhood is very nice, and John provided an extensive guide, as well as specific suggestions when we were interested in finding the best options.  Overall, a delightful stay, and we wouldn't hesitate to book here again.  "
63308,2723940,2012-10-26,3811324,Julie,We had a great stay in the studio apartment with the blue door.  fantastic neighborhood.  The host was great and friendly but also left us to enjoy our stay.  Perfect location and nice accommodations - so much better than a hotel.
63308,2748597,2012-10-29,3696919,Jamie,"This studio was great. Very clean and comfortable. The location is in a beautiful, quiet neighborhood within walking distance of the shops in Capitol Hill, and an easy bus ride anywhere else in the city. John and Craig were wonderful hosts.  The fridge was stocked with drinks, and we definitely used the umbrellas they supplied us with. It is Seattle after all! I would recommend this studio, and would love to stay here again."
63308,2770530,2012-10-31,3707387,Troy,"Craig welcomed us into he and John's great unit.  Lovely setting, neighborhood and more.  Very easy to get to where we needed to be on our visit from there. Charming unit as well.  Thanks so much! We look forward to hopefully staying again there on a visit soon! "
63308,2786228,2012-11-02,1786553,Yvonne,"excellent communication, pictures of this place are accurate, perfect accommodations for two. Great price, nice neighborhood & parking. Hosts were prompt, courteous & very thoughtful. Wouldn't stay anywhere else if we were visiting the Seattle area."
63308,2836737,2012-11-07,254898,Paul,"The studio is a fantastic alternative to a hotel.  Great, walkable neighborhood and a private, quiet space.

John & Craig are great hosts, and maintain an immaculate space (extremely clean and well maintained).  The space was comfortable, warm, and had everything we needed.  I wish we had discovered the space earlier (as we spent the prior night in a hotel - paying more for much less.)

It's a small space but I wouldn't want nor need more - the sleeping/tv area is upstairs and the bath/sitting area is downstairs by the door.  Parking off-street included, this is an excellent value."
63308,2844767,2012-11-09,3888239,Julie,"Fabulous, loved the loft, beautifully put together, bed very comfy and loved the quality sheets and towels.  John easy to talk to, spent 10 mins on giving me touring advice, restaurants, very professional and nice person.

As a single traveller, I felt safe and secure and look forward to my next stay."
63308,2859961,2012-11-11,3526503,Vanessa,"I had a wonderful stay here in North Capitol Hill. The studio was very clean and cozy, just the right amount of space for a short stay in Seattle. Comfortable bed, high quality sheets, lovely patio and good shower pressure. John was quick to come over and show me how to turn on the lamp, one click rather than two :-) 
Definitely would stay here again! "
63308,2877675,2012-11-13,3888239,Julie,"5 star stay.  Craig assisted this time, extremely helpful and kind.  I thoroughly enjoyed my stay felt safe, secure and very comfortable - hope to get back one day - loved it!"
63308,2901986,2012-11-17,298033,Lindsey,"By far the best place I have stayed in using Airbnb!  I knew the Guest Studio was going to be great just from the description on Airbnb, but it exceeded our expectations.  My fiance and I stayed for only 3 days and we wished we could stay longer.  We will definitely be back when we come to Seattle again.  John and Craig are beyond gracious, extremely friendly and are superb hosts.  The studio is extremely clean and utterly comfortable.  The bed is the most comfortable one I've slept in.  The studio is very private, the neighborhood is beautiful and extremely convenient to restaurants/bus stops and the freeway.  Highly, highly recommend."
63308,2916096,2012-11-19,3888239,Julie,"Dealt mostly with Craig, he was very helpful  and easy to get on with.  Loved my loft, felt like home, very cozy, safe and secure - loved it! Hope to get back to Seattle WA again.  Thanks boys great stay!"
63308,2939725,2012-11-22,1403033,Rosalind,"These hosts are very understanding and flexible.   We were forced to change plans at the last minute and received only helpful advice!

In the past we have enjoyed many comfortable days  and nights  here and look forward to getting back again."
63308,3031337,2012-12-05,4003671,Valerie,"It was completely pleasant! 
John & Craig were extremely inviting and patient. The place was CLEAN, cozy and convenient. 
Definitely would recommend my friends to rent from there if they were ever in Seattle ~ it has all you'll need for a comfortable stay.
They made sure that you had fresh towels, some welcome beverages, soft comfortable bed to rest in at the end of an amazing day in town.... etc. 
They explained where to go about and gave suggestions for great little cafes... just wished I had more time! 
We appreciated how once they showed us everything ~ that you are left to wander about town and come back to a private space. It was really safe too! 
Loved it. "
63308,3063917,2012-12-11,4010209,Rachel,"Such a beautiful and cozy space to stay in! This was my first time using Airbnb, and I could not have been happier. Jon and Craig were very welcoming and responsive. The studio is located in a beautiful neighborhood in Seattle and close to a convenient bus stop."
63308,3084136,2012-12-13,4326815,Erik,"Staying at John's Studio was the first Airbnb experience we've had, and it was glorious! If you're in the area, you'd be remiss not to consider this studio.
John was a pleasure to work with, and everything about the studio was clearly communicated. The studio was very comfortable and clean, the courtyard it opens into has it's own locked gate for security, and it's very easy to come and go without bothering anyone. It's obvious they put a lot of thought and care into their property.
The area is fantastic! You can't ask for a better immersion into an unfamiliar city. There were many people out and about walking their dogs, great views of the city (Capitol Hill being hilly, of course), and it's really close to transit (not that you'd ever hear it. It's silent in the studio at night).
I can't say enough about this place."
63308,3113833,2012-12-18,4191128,Joost,"well located and quiet studio close to the center of Seattle which we visited during 3 days in rainy conditions. The sleeping part of the studio on the first floor is cosy and has all what is needed to have a good night sleep, whereas the living/kitchen and bathroom area on the groundfloor are adequate in case one is outdoors most of the time.
Both hosts respect your privacy and -after a brief introduction- leave you to settle down and enjoy everything Seattle has to offer.
A little more personnal approach would not hurt, but it may be difficult where to draw the line.
Neighbourhood itself has not much to offer except a great restaurant/café "" the Kingfisher "" and some nice walks in the surrounding parks.
 Recommended for people who know what to do themselves and want only a nice place to sleep."
63308,3451758,2013-02-01,371848,Peter,"I have booked several units both in the US and Europe. By far, John and Craig were the best hosts ever. Their insight into the community and knowledge of Seattle kickstarted my relocation to the area.

The unit itself was room and had lots of privacy. Having off road parking was a big plus on those days when I needed a car. Anyone would be happy staying there!"
63308,3469365,2013-02-04,4331663,Lucy,"I highly recommend John and Craig's guest studio. It it a lovely studio-- big, clean, cozy and comfortable. It's in a great location-- I highly recommend walking from the house to Volunteer Park and then onto Volunteer Park Cafe. John and Craig were lovely-- I got a comprehensive and helpful tour when I arrived and they provided everything I could need in the cottage. This was my first Air B and B experience and I could not have been happier. Thanks John and Craig for making my time away from home very comfortable and relaxing! "
63308,3502719,2013-02-09,1176292,Helene,"John and Craig have a very nice studio, very conveniently located in North Capitol Hill. They were nice enough to wait for us until 10pm for the check-in, and explained everything about the studio perfectly. We had already been in Seattle so we knew what we were looking for, and the studio was the perfect place to come back and relax for the night. The bed was very comfortable, the Internet reliable, and we had everything we needed inside."
63308,3532559,2013-02-13,4464281,Lorin,"John French's Guest Studio is a CHARM!!! Truthfully, it exceeded our expectations by quite a bit. First, the art deco look of the dwelling is very special, complete with a staircase and railing that gives the split-level small apartment a very classy look. Second, the bed was very comfy. I could go on and on... for instance, the neighborhood is VERY charming and quiet- just what we wanted!

The main ""expectations exceeding"" bits however, were the little details: The small fridge was stocked with sodas, bottled water; there was coffee... and we were encouraged to partake in these (WAY beyond the call of duty, in my opinion). Both my partner and I had our very own bathrobes hanging in the closet (!!). Finally, the unit had a number of extremely informative books on Seattle... this was really great for us, as it was our first (of many, hopefully!) visits to the city.

All in all, two (rather, four, really) thumbs WAY up!!!
"
63308,3959498,2013-03-31,4896354,Robin,"This studio is absolutely fantastic!  It's a wonderful space, perfect for one or two people, and very comfortable.  The location is perfect - Capitol Hill is a great area in itself, and the studio offers a great ""hub"" for all your Seattle experiences.  It's an easy commute to downtown or the U district by car or bus. John and Craig were great hosts, and took the time to give me information about the area and get to know me a little.  They even stocked the fridge with sodas, juice and water.  There was a coffee maker and plenty of coffee, but best of all a great selection of teas available in the studio, which was perfect when I was settling in for the night.  I highly recommend this studio - in fact, I'm already thinking about a return trip!"
63308,4021300,2013-04-03,4974887,Clint,Cozy studio in beautiful neighborhood. We had a great time and would definitely stay again when we visit Seattle. Very nice hosts. 
63308,4095088,2013-04-09,5149713,Michelle,"John and Craig have a super cute studio. Everything was extremely clean when we arrived and they were able to provide us with pretty much everything we needed (water, OJ, sodas, even bathrobes!). The location is also extremely convenient for checking out the town and the neighborhood was both quiet and very upscale. John and Craig also left us some suggestions on places to see in the area and we decided to try the Volunteer Park Cafe and OMG it had the best French Dip I have ever had - thanks for the lovely vacation! "
63308,4126835,2013-04-12,5092570,Odrin,"John and Craig have an incredible studio with a very accessible location. They're such great hosts, too. Craig took a few moments to show us around the studio and then gave us GREAT recommendations for what to do around the city. They're such great people—and since this was my first Airbnb experience I'm grateful that these guys were my first hosts. I look forward to seeing these guys again on our return visit to Seattle."
63308,4182805,2013-04-16,5007209,Melanie,"John and Craig were wonderful hosts. They were responsive in coordinating check-in and check-out. When we arrived, Craig gave us a tour of the place, explaining the ins and outs. They provided us with a warm welcome, but then left us alone. The studio is quiet, clean and tastefully decorated. They definitely pay attention to the details, providing all the necessary amenities, including fresh towels, new soaps, shampoo and conditioner, and a blow dryer; they even had drinks in the refrigerator for us! We had a great stay!"
63308,4372435,2013-05-01,2414198,Lauren,"We stayed at the Blue Door Guest Studio for 3 nights.  It is situated in a beautiful area just a ten minute bus ride to downtown Seattle.  John and Craig greeted us on arrival, despite us getting there outside of the check in times.  They explained the studio to us and provided us with some tea, coffee and bits to keep us going.  They provided us with written information about the area which was very useful and details if we needed them for anything.  Our stay was very pleasant and we would recommend a stay here. "
63308,4416819,2013-05-04,3138465,Anna-Maria,"PERFECT! My friend Alexandra and I stayed with John and Craig for three nights in April/May and we just loved it! We came from Vancouver and went on to L.A. and stayed with many Airbnb-Hosts on the way - all good - but John and Craig - I have to write it again - PERFECT. The Guesthouse is so beautiful and really spacious for two people and the neighboorhood is amazing as well and the Volonteer Park is great for walks and Jogging and just around the corner. There are 2 buslines (the  # 10 and the # 49) going up towards Capitol Hill from Downtown and with stops near to the House. We were early for the check-in and John and Craig couldn't have been nicer - they even drove us to a nearby restaurant so we could have lunch (they recommended the 'Hobvine', and we went there and had the best soup of our lives), while they prepared the guesthouse. Other guests had just checked out and we were really early, thankful to just be able to drop off our luggage, (hadn't jet rented the car...). But the warm welcome with lunch'shuttle' was so much more than what we expected and certainly more than you can ask for... We would recommend that place to anyone going to Seattle!! PERFECT!"
63308,4446810,2013-05-06,1090089,Marlene,"This studio is just as pictured. Craig met me at check in for a personal tour of the studio. This is a well appointed rental & there even was juice, milk for coffee, sodas, bottled water, coffee and tea which was a really nice surprise! The kitchenette has dishes, cups & silverware, too! The bed was comfy, the place is clean & quiet and there was an off street parking spot which is a real find on Capitol Hill. I would stay there again and would recommend this studio without hesitation. Craig and John are great hosts and their dogs are really cute, too!"
63308,4631055,2013-05-16,329420,Anna,"John & Craig's studio is perfect. They are very good with their communication, the studio is quiet, clean and you have your own parking spot!

I definitely recommend their studio & would happily stay again."
63308,4698993,2013-05-21,433382,Barbara,"My stay at the Blue Door guest studio was wonderful. It is just as cute as the photos show, and the bed is so comfortable. The location allowed me to the bus to anywhere in town I wanted to go. It is quiet and you can enter from the side street and not even go past the house. I not only will stay here again when I come back to Seattle, but I'm looking for reasons to return again soon.

There is a small coffee bar about two blocks away, plus an Italian and a pizza restaurant, but I didn't get a chance to try them. If you're looking for breakfast or other restaurants, they're about a 15 minute walk away. 

The North Capitol Hill neighborhood is lovely. Do walk around and look at the homes and the landscaping. Here are two suggestions:

Walk east on Boston St. and stay left where the main road bends right and becomes 15th. Continue around the E Boston Terrace loop and check out the modernist and other homes, and the beautiful views. When you're done, you can continue south on 15th to Volunteer Park and the Seattle Asian Art Museum, or a bit further down 15th to find restaurants and shops.

Next: from the studio, walk west on Boston and south on 10th to E Blaine St. Go down the steps on the east side of 10th and visit Streissguth Gardens. You'll find an entry stone and a small kiosk with pamphlets partway down the stairs. 

If you're relying on public transportation, you can (and should) buy an Orca card. The card costs $5 but the convenience is worth it. If you're coming in from the airport, you can buy one at the Sea-Tac light rail station. Load it with some money and never worry about having exact change for the bus. In town, they're sold at QFC and Safeway grocery stores. Just tap and go, and never worry about having exact change.

If you have a smartphone, download the OneBusAway app and always know where the bus stops are and when the next bus will arrive. Very handy!"
63308,4770465,2013-05-25,5516769,Ian,"We had a wonderful time at John's guest studio in North Capitol Hill, Seattle. John and Craig were perfect hosts - friendly, knowledgeable and very helpful. They provided us with a lot of useful information about Seattle that was supplemented by a range of local guidebooks that had been thoughtfully left in the studio. 

The studio itself is attractively and thoughtfully furnished, well equipped and very comfortable. It is prettily situated within a mature garden where you can sit out and relax. Another bonus is that guests have their own off road parking spot. North Capitol Hill is delightful, neighbourly, well worth an explore and full of great views of Seattle, the Ocean, lakes and mountains.  

We will use the studio again when we return to Seattle and have no hesitation in recommending it.

63308,4832482,2013-05-28,5666531,Marie,"My boyfriend and I spent Memorial Day weekend in Seattle at Craig and John's guest studio. At first, I was a little hesitant since we'd never used AirBnB, but once the process started, we loved it, and we're sure to try again. 
Quick responses from Craig and John, great directions to get to the studio, they waited for us even though we arrived outside of check in hours (we arrive at 11pm and they waited for us!). Additionally, the studio was spotless and absolutely adorable. There is a small refrigerator stocked with soda, water bottles, milk and orange juice and a coffee pot available for coffee lovers. 
The location is great. They live in a very safe and cute part of Seattle. If you're staying here, you must walk around the neighborhood. The houses are beautiful and the view is great. We walked around and there were a lot of restaurants and local stores within a 20 minute walk. There are several bus stops (the closest is about a 7 minute walk) which will take you directly to downtown Seattle in 20 minutes (for $2.25). In addition, there is a small coffee shop and pizza restaurant in front of the nearest bus stop (just in case anyone gets hungry =] )
Although Seattle was a great city, the best part of the trip would definitely have to be the guest studio we stayed at. Very clean, homey, and cute. John and Craig were extremely hospitable and even let us leave our baggage at their house after check out (check out is 11, out flight left at 630.) To top it all off, John and Craig were headed downtown when we arrived to pick up our baggage, and even gave us a lift!
I can’t give higher praise to the guest studio and to John and Craig. I would 110% recommend this studio to ANYONE heading to Seattle or even the Seattle area. Best place to stay in ALL of Seattle. 
This is our first airBnB experience, so now we have extremely high expectations for any future places =]"
63308,4936134,2013-06-03,506163,Paulina,"This is my Second time staying at John and Craig's studio. This is my second time because I LOVED it so much I had to come back. The studio is located in a very safe, quiet and beautiful area just a short bus ride from downtown. The studio itself is super clean and comfortable. We got detailed instructions and John and Craig were just a text/call away in case we had any questions. They are so sweet to leave us juice, milk and coffee every time we have stayed. This time around we discovered a pizza a coffee shop maybe 10 min walking distance. I HIGHLY recommend this place as it easily accessible and just walking around the neighborhood is breathtaking. I hope to stay here again very soon. Thanks so much John and Craig :)"
63308,4989103,2013-06-05,2146793,Nandita,"This was my first time using airbnb and I'm never going back. My boyfriend Pat and I stayed with John and Craig for a brief Seattle getaway. The room is gorgeous, coffee delicious, and location extremely walkable/close to public transport. We got around just fine and I can't imagine staying anywhere else. They were exceptionally nice/helpful hosts, and held our bags past our check out time so we could wander around beautiful Seattle a little longer before leaving the city. Highly recommend!"
63308,5018676,2013-06-08,5387768,Laura,"Thank you to John and Craig for an excellent stay in their lovely apartment.  They were especially hospitable as we arrived outside of the check-in time due to some travel delays,  The apartment is perfectly clean and the bed is very, very comfortable.  Complimentary water / milk / sodas were much appreciated.  The surrounding neighbourhood is perfect, I would highly recommend the Blue Door Studio to anyone."
63308,5047412,2013-06-10,4401385,Kevin,Our stay was wonderful!  The location is very convenient to downtown and I-5.  The studio is perfect for 2 and I loved walking through the neighborhood and drinking coffee in the courtyard.  Thank you John and Craig!
63308,5128981,2013-06-14,5889960,Kerry,"John and Craig were great hosts. The studio was lovely, well resourced and comfortable. The bed was great! The little garden is delightful. The location is also excellent; not far from the Capitol Hill shopping and dining area. The only thing I would warn people about is the street the studio abuts is quite busy with traffic so we needed to sleep with the windows closed. "
63308,5173502,2013-06-17,290977,Sarah & Steve,"We had a fantastic stay at John and Craig's in Seattle. The house is in a beautiful neighborhood, just minutes away from Volunteer Park and beautiful views of Lake Union. The location was excellent and the guest studio was perfect for our little family of 2. We would be so glad to go back again soon!"
63308,5226462,2013-06-19,5658707,Joel,John's place was amazing.  They were friendly and the place was in a perfect walking distance of everything.  The studio was clean and the bed was comfortable.  I would recommend this place to anyone.    
63308,5261457,2013-06-21,2733877,Gaelle,This was our first visit to Seattle and we could not have been happier. The studio was in a beautiful neighborhood and walking distance from shops and restaurants. It was exactly as shown in the photo and it was perfect for my husband and I. The host was friendly and gave clear instructions. They even provided suggestions on what to do in the area. Our adventure was just awesome!
63308,5309269,2013-06-24,5621088,Dennis," When we decided to go to Seattle to visit family we came across John and Craig's place recomended by my daughter and son in law. 
  Our kids live in the upscale neigborhood of Capital Hill where John and Craig also live.
   What was wonderful is they decorated the stuido with so much expression of their passion for making beauty. The inner court yard is a true sight to take in. All of the beauty and  personal feelings of love is shown in the plants they have surrounded themselves with!!
   The exrea touches are so special, Beautiful robes in the closet to pamper you. The Refrigerator stocked with extras like bottled water, cokes and even two Personal Pan Pizza's, fresh milk for your coffee. The microwave came in handy to warm up our leftovers from our dinners the night before. Craig mentioned that John had recovered the couch and furniture such an amazing talent he has.. 
   John and Craig make you feel safe while staying in their guest home.
 
    Having met John and Craig in passing going back and forth, they are so nice and interesting to talk to.

 If you want privacy or they want privacy they won't intrude.on your Seattle trip.
   We will be back to enjoy the beauty of there lovely detached guest home. and the since of Serenity of Capital Hill..

Thanks John & Craig

63308,5540813,2013-07-05,4133156,Mimi,My BF and I happen to be in Seattle during a heatwave that was not common in the area. John & Craig forewarned us that the studio would be a bit warm and even gave us a chance to cancel and would give us a refund if we wanted to check in at a hotel with AC. We decided to give the place a try and ended up staying the entire time. The studio cooled down at night and the ceiling fan and regular fan helped a lot too. John & Craig gave us clear instructions and info on the area the first day and gave us our privacy the rest of our time there. The studio is near a few restaurants and a lovely park that is a must see. We enjoyed our time in Seattle!
63308,5695832,2013-07-12,6807276,Raewyn,"Craig and John were very gracious hosts, they provided us with a lot of useful information that allowed us to travel around Seattle like locals. The apartment was small but well appointed, clean and stylishly decorated. We appreciated the separate access as it allowed us to come and go as we wanted to. We would recommend the accommodation to anyone."
63308,5882341,2013-07-21,5854459,Margaret,A perfect lodging in an ideal location.  The place is pristine and comfortable.  Everything was in tip top shape and the shady garden/patio outside was beautiful to look at and walk through.  I loved the blue violet paint on all the exterior doors and gates. The hosts were kind and friendly.  A+
63308,6099780,2013-07-30,4980847,Brian,What a great location and perfect studio!  Our favorite spot was sitting on the patio in the beautiful garden with our morning coffee.   John and Craig were more than helpful and we look forward to staying here again.
63308,6191078,2013-08-03,1716772,Tristan/Robert,"The guest studio was comfortable, clean, and centrally located. Craig was a great host and we would definitely recommend this Seattle AirBnB!"
63308,6580019,2013-08-18,5455742,Karen,"I stayed at the Guest Studio for 2 weeks, and it was perfect! It is quiet, safe, comfortable and bigger than it looks in the pictures. The location is awesome, a 10 minute walk away from great restaurants, shops and beautiful parks. John and Craig are such kind and generous hosts. They gave me travel tips, drew me a map, and even drove me to a store I needed to get to on the day I arrived! Thanks again for such a great stay! :) "
63308,6841786,2013-08-27,3057194,Scott,"John & Craig's studio was perfect for our week-long trip to Seattle to attend the Ring Cycle. The space itself is fantastic -- well appointed, comfortable, quiet, clean, light and airy. It's cozy, but not at all cramped -- a nice fit for 2 people. And John & Craig couldn't have been nicer -- everything was exactly ""as advertised"" and they were happy to offer suggestions for area outings and restaurants. We would love to stay here again on our next trip to Seattle. For our first airbnb experience, we were completely happy."
63308,7157945,2013-09-09,7156017,Julia,"John  and Craig s guest house was good. It was private, quiet and secure. We liked all the bells and whistles  they had thoughtfully provided! especially coffee."
63308,7299278,2013-09-15,377476,Janet,"Our second stay was excellent! We appreciate the comfort and the location of the Blue Door B&B. With the weather being so nice my husband peacefully sat in the garden area reading while sipping wine! It's a quick drive to Pike Street Market, the expressway, and the airport. In the future we hope return to this pleasant location."
63308,7411275,2013-09-19,433382,Barbara,"This was my second stay at John and Craig's studio. I was here in May and fell in love with it, so I brought my husband back for three days at the end of our Alaska cruise. It felt like coming home. Craig got us all set up and even let me do a load of laundry in their basement. I don't ever want to stay anywhere else when I visit Seattle."
63308,7695936,2013-09-30,5213620,Samantha,"Our stay with John & Craig was perfect. Their sweet cottage-like loft in the back of their house was so super charming and a perfect fit for us two. The two (and their adorable little pups) were very welcoming. We even had coffee, sodas and bottled water in the fridge upon our arrival! The loft has a TV, a heating unit, and strong water pressure in the shower. With our rental car, we were able to get from one little town to the next in no time at all. Their place is also conveniently located to several downtowns, both with fun pubs, delicious places to grab food, and a number of sweet pastry shops. We only got back last night and we are already having withdrawals! Accompanying pictures to come.  "
63308,7849106,2013-10-06,7976877,Clare,"I was in Seattle for a conference. John & Craig's guest studio was such a wonderful, comfortable, cozy place to come back to at the end of a long day.  They were terrific hosts. They provided amazing coffee (as well as water, juice, soda, milk).   Craig gave me easy directions for taking the bus downtown!  I will definitely come back!! "
63308,7942327,2013-10-09,7861129,Ilene,"My daughter and I could not have found a cozier place to stay. It was close enough to her college, yet far enough away for her to feel like she was on vacation. Thanks for helping us have a wonderful time in Seattle."
63308,8005780,2013-10-12,7042866,Celeste,"John and Craig's studio was the perfect spot to begin our vacation. It had every amenity we could want and the studio was beautiful. My boyfriend and I loved the neighborhood it was located in and all of the wonderful suggestions John and Craig gave to us for food and places to see around the neighborhood. They were super nice to us and we loved our stay; we wish we were fortunate enough to live in such a beautiful place. If we came back to Seattle, we wouldn't hesitate to stay here again.

Afterward, they offered us a ride into Capitol Hill strip so we could grab dinner.  Everything is very accessible to the studio and we were able to access everything we needed.  The studio was clean and welcoming and all the added touches didn't go unnoticed.  We were thrilled with the location and the hosts were so kind.  We will definitely be back and hope to stay there again!  Thanks gentlemen!!!

63308,8587110,2013-11-06,184822,Kathryn,Beautiful guest cottage- everything we needed was there.  Beautiful neighborhood too!  Lots of privacy.  Hosts were kind and thoughtful. Couldn't have asked for a better place to stay in Seattle!
63308,8790253,2013-11-18,1583729,Nisha,This is the perfect studio/duplex with everything you could possibly need - perfect for business or personal travel. Very clean and the owners are very nice and helpful. Thanks for a great stay!
63308,8862031,2013-11-22,9279836,Leslie,"I had such a pleasant stay at John and Craig's guest house.
It has high ceilings and lots of windows giving it a light and spacious feeling. The patio and garden are filled with lovely trees and plants.  The bed is great.  The parking space provided is a big plus.
I had previously lived in this Seattle neighborhood and know it to be very safe but the guest house is especially secure and I had no worries about that.  It's very private, behind the main house and very quiet. 
This is a great neighborhood to stay in, residential and close to a great park for walking but also convenient to restaurants, groceries, coffee shops.
John and Craig were so friendly, helpful with directions and recommendations.  The guest house has plenty of heat (I was there in November), windows that open, all conveniences I could need, and plenty of space for my things.  
I would certainly love to stay there on a future trip to Seattle."
63308,8945809,2013-11-27,9520138,Cheryl,"Great value and very comfortable accommodations. The mini fridge was stocked with milk, juice, sodas and water as well as coffee and tea ready for brewing.  Nice, quiet neighborhood convenient to bus and walking distance to shopping and dining.  I would certainly stay here again upon a return trip to Seattle."
63308,8970985,2013-11-29,6818570,Dan,This was an absolutely perfect studio for everything that we needed. John and Craig are excellent hosts and they provided us with a wealth of useful information about Seattle and what to do there. The space was warm and comfortable and was well stocked with every amenity we could ask for. Thanks so much! 
63308,9049145,2013-12-02,2872198,Michelle,"I'll try not to repeat too much of what other guests have already said. This is mine and my boyfriend Tom's 2nd stay at John and Craig's studio, and we enjoyed it very much for all the reasons already mentioned. 

What I like the most is that all the amenities are new (new bar of soap, new small carton of milk, etc. as opposed to a container of milk that's half consumed - which I realize other Airbnb owners sometimes do).

During this stay, I made the mistake of booking one night short. Tom and I were out when we were supposed to have checked out, and instead of being upset, Craig and John were actually quite concerned about us and our whereabouts. It was very sweet and they were very understanding. Luckily we were able to book another night, as they weren't expecting another guest that day.

Great hosts, great studio, great neighborhood - a really great Airbnb stay overall.

63308,9068547,2013-12-04,4391568,Susan,"What a great experience. The studio apt was fabulous, very clean and cozy and its in a very nice neighhborhood. The apt is in a locked gated yard so safety was definetly not an issue. We would for sure recommend John and Craigs place and will rebook with them next time we go to Seattle.
Thanks Guys!!

63308,9114658,2013-12-08,506163,Paulina,"This is our THIRD time staying at John & Craig's beautiful studio. They are great hosts who make you feel right at home. The studio is perfect size for two people. They are always sweet enough to leave treats for us such as milk, juice, soda and water. This is by far the Best Airbnb experience there is. The neighborhood itself it breathtaking and I really enjoy using the public transportation that is readily available just one block away. I hope to visit again very soon."
63308,9170004,2013-12-10,5067772,Amanda,John & Craig's studio is pretty much perfect! It was cozy and clean with everything you might need. It's in a great location - close to everything. There's also a pub and pizza place within walking distance :) Check in/out was a breeze... Thank you!
63308,9252049,2013-12-16,1579605,Bruce,"Comfortable and cozy, even in winter, we enjoyed our week-long stay.  This apartment is connected to a garage, and has it's own entrance through a back yard garden (beautiful, BTW).  Charming and well-located for those exploring inner Seattle, this turned out to be a perfect ""home base"" for use while we house hunted in the area.
The queen bed is a tight fit in the upstairs sleeping loft, but it's cozy, quiet and comfortable.  There's ample room for a week's wardrobe upstairs, and more storage down.  The bathroom is located downstairs.  Dimmers on nearly everything allow you to set the light to your needs.  Temperature control was easy, and the heater kept it warm and cozy even on the coldest days.  While not a problem, it was unusual to have the one sink located in the living area, adjacent to the handy mini-fridge and microwave.  Definitely a tight layout, but it works.  Off-street parking was another plus.
The hosts, Craig and John, made us feel welcomed and were gracious with suggestions for the area.  It was a pleasure to bump into them and chat during the visit, but it was easy to feel like we had a private place with the separate apartment.
I'd absolutely stay here again, and recommend it to friends."
63308,9924586,2014-01-20,9652606,Rachel,"I had a great time staying at this guest studio! It had everything that I needed to do some work and some relaxing while I was in town, including an excellent location, speedy wifi, and nice, clean facilities. I would definitely stay there again and recommend it to my friends as well.

John and Craig were friendly hosts who clearly take pride in their space. It is clear that they have given time and attention to anticipating their guests needs, and they are just nice people to talk to."
63308,10044624,2014-01-27,5310283,Laura,"Perfect place for a couple.  It had everything we needed and more (there were even drinks in the fridge), and our hosts were nothing but generous.  Would love to stay again!"
63308,10147206,2014-02-03,1728804,Helene,Another wonderful stay with John and Craig. This our third visit to their Capitol Hill property. When and if we return to Seattle we'll see you again guys.

And the location is very convenient, very colse to the main scenic spots. Hope to visit them again. In the last day I lived in Seattle, I met a little parking problem. Thank John help me to solve it. He is a very very nice person!"
63308,10253186,2014-02-09,8717842,Athena,Reserving was easy and the apartment was spotless and comfortable! Would stay here again.
63308,10291975,2014-02-11,6342346,Shuchi,"They say location, location, location. We really enjoyed our stay at John and Craig's for a short 2 day visit to Seattle. It was the perfect location for us, close to everything. Few parks within walking distance. The studio had everything we needed, even bath robes (and they are comfy)! Though it is attached to their garage, it is quiet  and we didn't notice them getting in and out of the garage at all. Was easy checking in and checking out, and you get free parking! The only thing was, the heater was a bit tricky as the temperature dial didn't mean anything, you simply had to guess how much heat to turn on and when it gets too warm, just turn it low or when it's too cold, turn it up. Other than that, would definitely go back! John and Craig even had notes and recommendations for local restaurants/coffee shops for us."
63308,10346406,2014-02-15,10925970,Andreina & Byron,"John and Craig's studio is beautiful, very comfortable, clean and well located in a residential area, at walking distance from Capitol Hill. They were both very nice and gave us great information about the city and intersting places to visit. Definately a very good experience and we recommend it!"
63308,10451854,2014-02-19,11457122,Rachel,"I stayed in John and Craig's studio for two nights. While I did not meet john, Craig was so hospitable and kind. The studio is in a safe area that is just a short bus ride away from the busy and fun Capitol Hill area. Though small, the studio had everything we needed. I would recommend staying here!"
63308,10566417,2014-02-25,10978772,Melanie,"We found the guest studio very comfortable and incredibly clean.  John had paid attention to details that made our stay special, like comfy terry robes, some snacks/drinks in the frig, fully outfitted coffee/tea supplies, and bath needs.  There is a lovely private patio area for a summer stay.  The available off street parking is so valuable in Seattle; quite a nice addition to the package.  We definitely will be returning to this studio, and members of our family have already booked a visit also !"
63308,10618170,2014-02-28,2112302,Emma,"I would recommend this studio to anyone visiting Seattle. At first we were worried about being so far from downtown, but the location proved to be one of the best aspects about this place. The studio is quiet, but a short walk from lively shopping and restaurants. We had a lot of fun exploring the neighborhood, which is filled with beautiful houses and breathtaking views of the distant mountains. It was convenient to take busses into downtown, and we felt assured knowing our car was parked in a safe spot while we were out for the day. We will definitely be back!"
63308,10717075,2014-03-04,11281421,Lisa,"My boyfriend and I had a wonderful stay at John and Craig's property. Craig, who welcomed us and got us situated, was very hospitable and friendly, really helping us start our trip off on the right foot. The studio was clean, cozy, and well-stocked with toiletries and beverages, which we really appreciated, as it made us feel right at home.

The location is fantastic--a short walk to the heart of Capitol Hill and an even shorter walk to bus lines that take you straight to downtown. We rented a car for our stay but quickly realized that the area is so safe, beautiful, and close to everything else that a car was unnecessary.

I would absolutely recommend this studio to anyone visiting Seattle!"
63308,10796796,2014-03-08,7750743,Christopher,"Both John and Craig are very warm and welcoming hosts. Even on a mid-week stay, they were more than willing to accept us into their place. And the studio is about as warm and charming as they come. I also can not say enough about location and pricing. Being as close to the park, and Capitol Hill dining scene is what makes the place a total steal. The neighborhood is welcoming, and easy to get in and out of. It is very walkable. And there is easy access to the bus-lines. 
But overall, I must say that having two hosts that want to share their hospitality and grace with you, makes being in a different city much like being at home.

Thank you,
Christopher and Rachel "
63308,10836465,2014-03-10,1640045,Jamie,"John and Craig welcomed my mom and I to their studio with a great tour of the space and fabulous recommendations for close by restaurants.  The studio was amazing, easy to find, and close to the bus line.  We would happily stay there again when back in Seattle!"
63308,10976886,2014-03-16,4957119,Angela,"We had an absolutely wonderful time staying at John and Craig's guest studio in north Capitol Hill!  They were great hosts--met us when we arrived and made sure that we had what we needed, and the studio was a perfect place!  It is very clean, cozy, and allowed us privacy while being in a great location to access different parts of the city.  John and Craig even left coffee/tea/drinks for us as we arrived.  We would definitely recommend it right away!"
63308,11734513,2014-04-14,10551217,Joanne,"I recently spent a month in John & Craig's Seattle guest studio. They were wonderful & gracious hosts. The studio is clean, private, secure and in a lovely neighborhood. I would definitely stay there again if the opportunity arises."
63308,12233655,2014-04-27,2322968,Geoff,"Staying at John and Craig's studio was so fantastic!  Located in a lovely residential neighborhood, access to downtown was simple via bus and it was a short walk to Capitol Hill.  John and Craig were kind enough to stock some staples (coffee, juice, milk, etc) to start off our stay.  The bed was comfortable, towels fluffy, and there were robes for us to use!  We unfortunately didn't get a chance interact with John and Craig all that much because we had an extensive itinerary, but they were quick to say hello when we did see them!  We *highly* recommend staying with John and Craig!  "
63308,12682098,2014-05-08,127825,Steven,"I was lucky enough to stay in Craig and John's Seattle guest house for one week and  I thoroughly enjoyed it.  They were both very gracious and welcoming and it was a pleasure conversing with them and getting worthwhile tips.  The studio was very comfortable and well-appointed.  Nice amenities like coffee and soda were especially appreciated. Also, being close to #49 bus line allowed me to leave rented car parked and zipped downtown in 14 minutes and avoid parking $$! Walking the Capital Hill neighborhood was a particular treat.  "
63308,12930906,2014-05-14,10879737,Sarah,"We loved our stay in the Guest Studio!  The location is fantastic - it was very easy to find, very close to the bus stop to get to Pike Place Market, and we loved exploring the Capital Hill district!  Capital Hill has great food, drinks, and entertainment options so it is a great place to stay. We had a rental car and appreciated having the parking space in their driveway.  We received our own keys and could come and go as we pleased. The studio was extremely clean and well maintained and the bed was very comfortable.  We found the studio very relaxing - it is right off a courtyard so you get to hear the birds chirping and the windows and skylight keep things very bright during the day while maintaining privacy.  Our hosts were very gracious about answering all of my questions via email, coordinating our stay and check in/check out, and gave us great advice.  They even left us some refreshments in the refrigerator and had a hairdryer for me to use.  Thank you again John and Craig - hope to stay with you again in the future!"
63308,13095705,2014-05-19,4007858,Annie,"Staying at the Blue Door Guest Studio was great!  My boyfriend and I were in town to explore Seattle and get away from Portland for a weekend.  We didn't know much about the city or where to go.  This location was perfect as it was close to various cool neighborhoods, a giant park, a great view, and it wasn't a bad walk downtown.   John showed us all of the cool neighborhoods on a map when we first arrived, it was very helpful.  The studio was clean and quiet.  There were beverages in the mini fridge!  Thank you again for letting us stay!"
63308,13811214,2014-06-05,4763914,Robert,"Host met us when we got there and gave a brief tour of the apartment which was just as described. Scrupulously clean, well appointed. They left us some coffee, tea, milk and OJ to get us started."

The had the place clean and stocked with a few starter supplies for me, and provided some helpful information for navigating the area. Would definitely stay here again."
63308,15482353,2014-07-10,12095058,Don,Great place to stay. Very convenient and a wonderful neighborhood. Walk a couple blocks in any direction to see a wonderful view or extravagant houses. Peaceful and private place. Will go back in a heartbeat.  
63308,15586772,2014-07-12,4121242,Harriet,"John and Craig were delightful hosts,  ready to answer any questions we had. The tips they gave us on viewing Seattle made our 2 day trip to Seattle all the more interesting.  The guest house was decorated with impeccable taste,  and we were impressed with how accurate the pictures online matched the actual guesthouse.  The guest house is strategically located within walking distance to the Capital District.  The surrounding neighborhood is filled with beautiful flowers and trees, which provides for nice lazy walks."
63308,15747654,2014-07-15,9667332,Elise And Tyler,"Craig met us and let us into the charming apartment. We enjoyed the space and the area immensely! Cozy and close to the bus.

Craig was most hospitable and welcoming. Unfortunately we didn't meet John.  T he neighborhood was a big plus and great for walks to local restaurants and Volunteer Park. I would highly recommend this studio. Great!!!!

63308,16196990,2014-07-23,12422308,James,What a great Guest Studio!!  Craig and John were excellent hosts.  Their place was exactly as they advertised.  Craig gave us an excellent tour of the place and on top of that recommended local restaurants and points of interest.  It was like being at home. Craig was quick to respond to any questions we had.  I would definitely recommend their place and hope to stay there again on our next trip to Seattle!
63308,16521764,2014-07-28,2631592,Darcy & Anna,"What a great experience with John and Craig. We had a marvellous stay in their detached suite with all amenities ready and waiting for us! We sipped on wine in their courtyard and took our bikes for a spin on the bike paths downtown Seattle. There was private parking available, and a very safe and secure hideaway in a beautiful neighbourhood. 

Thanks again, we'll be back!
Darcy and Anna"
63308,16723715,2014-08-01,13044939,Shanell,"John and Craig were great hosts. Their guest house is set just past their garden. The house looks just like the pictures. Cozy and clean with everything you may need. 
The neighborhood is just as nice. Very quiet tree lined streets. Walking distance to a bunch of cool neighborhoods. We walked to dinner in Capitol Hill and Brunch in the U District. Caught a bus a block away to Fremont and downtown. 
We loved our stay in Seattle and wished we could stay longer!"
63308,16821911,2014-08-03,12939372,Jenny,"Craig and John were really nice and helpful. Both their house and the granny flat were lovely and located in a beautiful suburb. We were provided with water, juice, coke, milk, coffee and tea. Once we worked out how to take the bus to and from downtown it was very convenient to get around."
63308,17147875,2014-08-08,14874976,Ashley,This was a great little place to stay!  It's an incredibly charming space with a beautiful courtyard and one of the most comfortable mattresses I've ever slept on!  John and Craig were great hosts and quick to respond if we needed anything. 
63308,17258066,2014-08-10,11166654,Aaron,Our host made us feel very welcome. We were greeted on time and given a tour. The pictures were accurate and it was a great stay. The neighborhood was really nice and pretty much within walking distance of some great bars and restaraunts. 
63308,17557923,2014-08-14,3946769,Erin,"My spouse and I had an amazing airbnb experience staying at the Capitol Hill studio. John and Craig were super helpful with all questions we had prior to our visit. They both made us feel welcomed by greeting us at arrival and walking us through their space answering all of our questions. They also stocked the mini fridge with some complimentary foods and beverages, which was very thoughtful. They also provided a short and very thorough itinerary of suggested to-do’s in Seattle… I think we hit all of them in just 3 days!  The studio was very clean and comfortable and looked exactly like the pictures on airbnb. The neighborhood was excellent as it felt safe and conveniently located next to a bus stop. We used the public transportation daily and walked around the city which was doable. Overall, we enjoyed our stay in the space and Seattle. We had the opportunity to relax and converse with both John and Craig on their picturesque patio. They are incredibly nice and welcoming people. We would definitely stay here again and recommend it to others who are traveling to Seattle!"
63308,18057007,2014-08-21,12099103,Aaron,"Staying at the Blue Door Guest Studio was excellent. Craig and John were very welcoming and made us feel at home. Craig was very clear with instructions, making check in and check out quite easy. The guest studio itself was exceptional: it was clean, comfortable, and in an awesome neighborhood--Capitol Hill! We will most definitely refer anyone we know traveling to Seattle to stay at the Blue Door. "
63308,18295097,2014-08-25,11663856,Naomi,"This was a wonderful choice for our Seattle visit!   John & Craig provided everything we needed.  The studio, location and sunny weather made it a perfect weekend.  The studio was well furnished and equipped, we were able to take the bus to town on our first evening, enjoy beautiful Volunteer Park and the great Capital Hill neighborhood.   Thanks for everything."
63308,18464221,2014-08-27,12622970,Carly,"It was an all around great experience staying at this suite! We did not meet John, but Craig was very friendly and helpful. They had a great document written up that outlined many of the things we could do; and how to get to the more popular areas. This was great as it was our first time in Seattle. The space was perfect for what we needed, and was exactly what was expected. The neighbourhood was absolutely beautiful, we spent hours just exploring. We are so happy we chose to stay here! "
63308,18524974,2014-08-28,12643861,Lyndsay,"First, let me just say how wonderful this guest studio is, such an adorable space with a gorgeous shared patio! John and Craig were perfect! We checked in and Craig showed us around and let us have our privacy all while knowing that if we needed anything they were only a phone call away! We didn't spend much time in the guest studio since we were out and about downtown most of the day but it is wonderful. I definitely recommend staying with John and Craig! "

It is very comfortable and well set up, and they were extremely welcoming and helpful with lots of excellent suggestions of local eating spots,  tourist activities and even jogging routes!  Would certainly recommend!"
63308,19667002,2014-09-16,14807762,John,"This Seattle studio is located in North Capitol Hill, a very private, quiet, and serene setting within walking distance to area grocery, coffee, and places to shop. The studio is very comfortable with bedroom loft, private bath, and living area.  Relax outside on the patio, or have coffee and breakfast in your private kitchen.  The hosts are thoughtful and provide everything you need to enjoy your visit. We loved this studio! 
The advantages to this studio are endless. The privacy, and cost for an entire studio are well worth it. The bedroom is comfortable, with fans and window access for additional comfort if needed. Television and internet are also provided as well as a little library for your convenience. They provide coffee, teas, water, beverages, fresh towels, and bath essentials.  If you have any additional needs, you may call them at anytime. 
Take a walk along Federal Avenue, and enjoy the views of Seattle, and the beautiful homes and parks in this area. Public transportation is available within minutes.
We will definitely hope this is available for our return visits in the future."
63308,19820841,2014-09-19,5861040,Eleanor,"We had a very short but sweet trip to Seattle, staying in John and Craig's super cute little studio.  It was a great local neighbourhood, but we recommend taking the bus/a cab downtown as we walked far too much and were exhausted as a result!  Craig settled us in with lots of nice personal touches and tips for things to do and we felt right at home.  The apartment was very comfortable and had everything you need for a city break in Seattle.  Definitely recommend!  "
63308,20327965,2014-09-28,661531,Aude,"Very great place to stay and visit the nice Seattle. Craig and John are perfect hosts knowing their city very well. The studio is very comfortable, restful, clean... with a view on beautiful John and Craig's garden. Downtown can easily get reached by public transport and Capitol Hill is a nice green neighbourhood. Highly recommended! "
63308,20500131,2014-09-30,8590925,Ana,"John and Craig's little guesthouse (actually not that little!) was an amazing home base from which to explore Seattle. Just like it is in the description- the neighborhood is quiet but within walking distance to lots of bars and restaurants, as well as several bus lines taking you downtown, right to the heart of the city. Craig gave us lots of good tips for brunch, dinner, love music, and the best ways to get around. They were really quick to respond to all messages and super accommodating- we could not have asked for better hosts, or a more wonderful place to spend our weekend in Seattle. We absolutely recommend the studio to anyone who wants to relax in a quieter neighborhood, while still being close to all of the city's sights!"
63308,20598103,2014-10-02,15564820,Alex,"I really like Craig and their beautiful house. The studio is isolated, very special. Everything are prepared perfectly in the studio. Very convenient and neat. The house's surroundings are safe and very quiet.  And there is a big park next to the house. If you wanna go to downtown , route 49th runs till midnight， which is close to the house in 50 feet or so . I do like this experience through Airbnb.  "
63308,20895530,2014-10-07,2245536,Brian,"John and Craig were wonderful hosts, and their space is a perfect launching pad for discovering Seattle and the surrounding areas. The suite was spotless, comfortable, and full of little touches to make us feel at home (a couple complimentary drinks, welcome notes and maps, etc.)

The neighborhood was surprisingly quiet given its proximity to the bustle of Capitol Hill. Downtown was walkable, and the roads around John and Craig's place were great for getting a quick jog in. Great views of the lakes and a couple top notch coffee shops were within blocks. Everything else was an easy bus ride away. The on-site parking space was crucial, too, especially after long days hiking in the mountains. 

Finally, John and Craig were great about being attentive and helpful but also respectful of our privacy. Couldn't have asked for a better vacation experience. "
63308,21277555,2014-10-14,7862693,Michele,Wonderful location. Excellent hosts. Super clean accommodation. 
63308,21424970,2014-10-17,20241618,Arlene Rodriguez &,"John and Craig were welcoming, friendly and accommodating. The studio was a perfect fit for our stay and well worth the price.  It was clean and has a comfy bed which is always a plus. We had everything we needed.  The location is beautiful and a bus ride away to downtown.  We really enjoyed our stay in Seattle. "
63308,21578085,2014-10-20,17250148,Lisa,"John and Craig made us feel welcome the moment we arrived at the studio. Our welcome letter contained lots of great information about the area, including where to eat, where to shop and where to enjoy everything Seattle had to offer. We also received great advice about how to use the bus to get around town, saving in both money parking and headaches. (You're right on the very-convenient 49 route)

The Studio, itself, is located in a nice, quiet neighborhood and is centrally located. It's perfect for a couple or single who wants a comfortable place to explore the area. 

John and Craig were also kind enough to lend us their iron, which we greatly appreciated."
63308,21705919,2014-10-22,4643846,Gaetan And Lucy,"Beautiful studio, very clean and well located, Capitol Hill district is  quiet and very nice, walkable disatance to Broadway Ave, where you will find all you need to get groceries and nice restaurants, John gave us a very warm welcome, that made us feel at home immediately. You can count on him to give you some good tips about the city. We love small attentions in the fridge. If we ever go back to Seattle, we know where to stay."
63308,21836583,2014-10-25,8396425,Monica,John was very helpful and the loft was perfect for our two night stay. The neighborhood has great restaurants and coffee shop. It's exactly what we wanted. 
63308,21940857,2014-10-27,6155426,Chris,We felt very welcomed by John and Craig when visiting Seattle. There was a very detailed walk through and introduction to the place which was helpful. The neighborhood is fantastic very close to walk to several good restaurants. The Blind Pig was excellent for dinner.
63308,22084476,2014-10-29,7485967,Robert,Perfect location and a brilliant studio. John and Craig are great hosts with a willingness to provide any information needed during the stay. Could not have had a better experience. 
63308,22190982,2014-11-01,21410513,Taylor,Craig made us feel very welcome when we first showed up and was helpful with aquainting us with the studio and recommending things for us to do. The hosts totally gave us our privacy but were always there for us if we needed them. Would love to stay again!
63308,22298828,2014-11-03,10552962,Brandon,Perfect experience! John paid great attention to every detail and we were extremely comfortable. The neighborhood is incredible and not far from some of the best food and drink in seattle. Highly recommended!
63308,23062233,2014-11-22,8722798,Petra,"Our stay at John and Craig's studio was everything we had hoped it would be and was the perfect location to enjoy so many parts of city.  The neighborhood was lovely, the studio very comfortably furnished and we enjoyed the fact that there were so many great options for dining within a short distance.  As runners, having Volunteer Park just up the street was also a plus. Craig gave us a wonderful welcome and provided a quick tour to familiarize us with the studio and the area. We hope to stay again our next trip out."
63308,23202917,2014-11-25,850769,Christian,Craig and John are wonderful people and their place is in just a perfect spot of the city. They showed us the very private guest house in the back of their wonderful garden upon arrival and it was in perfect and clean condition with everything in it you need for a few days. We just stayed for a weekend and really liked the central location (just 10 min downtown or to Space Needle by car). Whenever we come back to Seattle we hope to stay in this place again. Thanks again! 
63308,23422575,2014-12-01,17368763,Cortney,"This cozy and bright studio was home base for my husband and me during the four-day Thanksgiving weekend. It rained and snowed while we were there, but the studio remained warm and dry. The hosts were welcoming and provided coffee, teas, robes (a nice surprise!) shampoo and other amenities. The parking space was also appreciated as parking in Seattle can be scarce. One thing to note is there is a skylight in the studio, so the space will brighten with the rising sun.

We were very pleased with the location. The two-story studio is separate from the main house and in a residential neighborhood, just a few blocks from Volunteer Park and trendy restaurants and shops, and a short drive to Downtown. Our hosts suggested taking the bus to Downtown to avoid parking charges, which can run upwards of $10. We didn't use public transportation on this trip, but will probably do so next time. Craig and John, thank you for your hospitality!"
63308,25600391,2015-01-20,1406031,My Linh,"John and Craig were incredible and friendly hosts!  The place is very clean, heated and well-lit.  Craig went the extra way to show us the studio and its nuances.  Both went to great lengths to make sure we were comfortable and enjoyed our stay.  I was worried that the loft would not be tall enough for my 6-foot boyfriend as most lofts aren't.  But, it turned out that the loft had high ceilings so it worked out well!  The bed was absolutely perfect.  We had been staying at another AirBnB where the bed was too soft.  We finally were able to get a good night's rest on this bed, especially being so sore from snowboarding at Whistler.  I would not hesitate to book this place again!"
63308,25698637,2015-01-23,25108436,John,"John & Craig's studio was perfect for my last minute stay.  I needed to extend my stay in Seattle and they were able to quickly approve my request with the help of another local host. The location is great and it is easy to come and go discreetly. I only regret not having the time to get to know them better during my stay. 
They are also very knowledgable of the area and are willing to offer suggestions for food, coffee and other attractions. 
I would certainly recommend this property to any single or couple looking for a private retreat in a great neighborhood. "
63308,25951189,2015-01-31,173282,Bernard,"lovely flat in quiet neighborhood. John was efficient in giving directions and Craig in showing us round the flat, generously stocked with drinks for us in the fridge. Highly recommended."
63308,26060682,2015-02-02,8033437,Lauren,"What an amazing space! Craig was so sweet to show us around the loft when we arrived, and he made sure that we were comfortable throughout our stay. The location of this airbnb is WONDERFUL because we were able to walk to Capitol Hill for brunch with friends the next morning- and we ended up walking through a beautiful park on our way! You could definitely go for gorgeous walks and runs while staying at this place. The fridge was stocked with refreshments, and coffee in the morning was super nice. The loft itself is more like a second story because the stairs are easy to navigate and the ceiling is tall! The bed was extremely comfortable, too. Thank you, John and Craig, for an amazing weekend in Seattle! :)"
63308,26349600,2015-02-10,2521403,Quynh,"My boyfriend and I decided to take a pre-Valentines Day trip to Seattle as we both have never been there before. We decided to save some money and use AirBnB since we would be staying for 4 nights. Communication prior to our arrival with John and Craig was flawless. They were flexible with our late flight arrival and waited up for us, which we really appreciated! We met Craig and he gave us a tour of our space, fridge loaded with refreshments for us. Overall, we didn't see much of our hosts because they gave us 100% privacy on our couple getaway, but when we did run into Craig, it was a great convo/catch up on how our trip to Seattle had been so far. Craig was really welcoming and the studio was awesome. It felt like our own little apartment and everything touristy that we wanted to do was less than a 10min Uber away! I would definitely recommend for any traveler to stay here."
63308,26737361,2015-02-18,20657639,Scott,"John and Craig,

Thank you for your hospitality during our stay.  The studio was exactly as described, impeccably clean and ready for our stay.  Your home is absolutely gorgeous and we would certainly stay again.

Thanks again.

They have everything stocked in the place to make you comfortable - water , sodas in the fridge , shampoo in the bathroom , wifi , etc ... It's a cozy little space . I would definitely stay here again. "

Their place is conveniently located near the highway and the neighborhood itself had many great bars, restaurants, and small local shops. John and Craig are very easy going and communicated very well. Check-in was a smooth process and they were readily available if you had any questions.  Thank you so much for all your recommendations and the wonderful stay! "
63308,27988126,2015-03-16,798101,Stella,"My husband and I had a wonderful stay! John & Craig are were very friendly and helpful. The space was very lovely and well-kept. We could not have asked for a better location, everything was nearby, and the neighborhood was just so lovely and safe. We would love to stay here again next time we visit Seattle!"
63308,28667649,2015-03-28,28997103,Joe,"John and Craig are both very good hosts and did a great job of making you feel at home. The guest house was very organized, clean and cozy. It worked out great for our short weekend trip to Seattle. The neighborhood is great and nearby public transit connects well into downtown / U District"
63308,28894460,2015-03-31,3949863,Christine,Craig was an extremely welcoming and friendly host. He made our stay in Seattle very comfortable and we would gladly come visit again!
63308,29255312,2015-04-06,5107541,Kate,"The Guest Studio was very comfortable and a great location, great neighborhood! We were in Seattle for a wedding and had events in Capitol Hill, Downtown, the Market, Fremont and in Ballard and this was centrally located. There is a bus stop just a couple of blocks away that was convenient as well. The space was relaxing to come home to at night, it was easy to fall asleep at night - the bed is really comfortable and down comforter was great. The hosts were super helpful and friendly! Thanks for a great stay - love Seattle!"
63308,29810046,2015-04-13,3755462,Larry,"John and Craig were great. They welcomed me, chatted with me, and made sure I was comfortable. The guest house is terrific and exactly as shown on AirBnB.  The neighborhood is awesome and everything was in bloom when I was staying (lucky me). Of course, as others have stated, the location is great.  The public transit was easy to use, however, it is very walkable to downtown. I would stay there again in a heartbeat. Thanks so much guys!"
63308,30029277,2015-04-16,29176635,Lupe,"My sister and I had a lovely stay at John and Craig's place it was nice and cozy. Everywhere we visited while in the city was a good short distance from their place, they provided us with some fresh drinks in the fridge which was very kind of them. Not to mention the bed it was super comfortable that was a plus for me considering I have a bad back. I would definitely consider staying here again on my next visit to Seattle."
63308,30769147,2015-04-27,7128059,Ronald,"John and Craig were great hosts, communication was easy and they were most helpful.  The studio apartment worked well for us and was quite comfortable.  The location is good and close to public transportation. "
63308,31079328,2015-05-01,30852635,Marty,John and Craig have a magnicent place. I wanted something quiet where I could just read. The detached dwelling was perfect. The neighborhood was beautiful. Craig met me on arrival and instructions were easy about what to do. Summer and Fall would be gorgeous here. They have an outside garden area that would be lush and peaceful. 
63308,31189990,2015-05-03,26963352,Jim,"Maisonetteartige Separate Unterkunft , welche sich auf demselben Grundstück befindet wie das Haupthaus der Gastgeber . Sehr großzügig geschnitten und sauber. Sichere, wohlhabende Gegend  ( man kann um 10p.m. Auf der Straße unbesorgt spazieren gehen ) , Spitzen Busverbindung nach downtown (15min) , 20min mit dem Auto zum Airport. Craig ist nett, gut strukturiert und zuvorkommend . Fazit : Top Unterkunft allein oder als Paar  in einer sehr sicheren und schönen Gegend mit super Verkehrsanbindung Nach downtown. eher nicht Kinder geeignet , keine koch Möglichkeit . "
63308,31503990,2015-05-06,20032976,Stefanie,"DEUTSCH:
Sehr freundliche, unkomplizierte und unauffällige Gastgeber. Die Unterkunft liegt mit Capitol Hill in einer sehr schönen Gegend von Seattle in der Nähe des East Broadway. Zum Zentrum fährt ein Bus in 10 Minuten, aber auch zu Fuß kommt man überall bequem hin. Vom und zum Flughafen dauert's etwa eine Stunde. TIPP: Nehmt kein Taxi...kostet wahnsinnige $60. Bahn und Bus in Summe nur $7. Das Zimmer war wie erwartet sauber, ausreichend groß für 2, aber im unteren Bereich etwas kühl trotz Heizlüfter. Das dürfte aber im Sommer kein Problem darstellen. Erwähnenswert sind die Kühlgetränke, die uns zur Verfügung gestellt wurden, die für unsere 3 Nächte ausreichend waren! Top Service! Alles in allem ein gelungener Start unserer Westküstentour...gerne wieder.

ENGLISH:
Very friendly , uncomplicated and unobtrusive hosts. The property is located at Capitol Hill in a very nice area of Seattle near the East Broadway. The center is reached within 10 minutes by bus, but also within walking distance one can go to anywhere in Seattle easily. (we like to walk, which seems unusual in America ;)) And from the airport it takes about an hour. TIP: Don't take a taxi ... insane costs $60. Train and bus in sum only $7. The room was as expected clean, big enough for 2, but at the bottom a little chilly despite heater. But that should be no problem in summer. Worth mentioning are the cooling beverages that have been made available to us, which were adequate for our 3 nights! Top Service! All in all, a good start of our West Coast Tour...See you next time."
63308,31691411,2015-05-09,25641508,Cheryl,"John and Craig were so warm; friendly and made us feel so welcome in their quaint and perfect guest studio.  It was clean and everything and more that you would find in an expensive hotel was there including fluffy white bath robes.  Their knowledge of the area was amazing and they had materials to help with attractions, bus schedules and were available for any questions.  I hope to visit again and stay with them. "
63308,32708823,2015-05-20,11851973,Lindsay,The guest studio was fantastic! Perfect amount of space - the loft layout makes the studio feel very spacious. Very neat and clean and super easy check-in/check-out. Plus the neighborhood is lovely and close enough to walk to the main Capitol Hill area. Thanks John and Craig for a great stay!
63308,33063987,2015-05-25,7412041,Jonathan,"John and Craig's guest studio is lovely and charming.  It is clean, comfortable, well cared-for, the loft-style feels spacious, and John and Craig have thought of all the details, down to providing us with Seattle tourist information pamphlets in the cabinet, beverages in the fridge, and comfy bathrobes in the closet.  They are gracious hosts, easy to communicate with, easy check-in/out, and the studio is in a great location on a quiet street but a close walk to all the activity of Capitol Hill."
63308,33361165,2015-05-27,29171275,Kathy,"This is a cozy little place to stay.  We didn't spend a lot of time there because we were busy with a family wedding, but the location was great and the apartment met our needs.  Most of our communication was with Craig and he was great to work with.  He accommodated our early arrival and let us check in ahead of the designated time.  He was very friendly and gave us all the information we needed. Then we were given our privacy for the duration of our stay. "
63308,33490249,2015-05-29,21014413,Ann,"My sister and I had such a great time staying at the Blue Door Guest Studio. Craig and John were wonderful. Before our visit they quickly responded to our messages. They allowed us to drop off our luggage early, and then when we arrived we were pleasantly surprised to find that we could actually check in early. Craig and John were extremely helpful and informative, and happy to answer any questions we had about making our way around the city. 

The guest house is a gem and the courtyard is inviting. The first floor of the guest house has a lounging area with a sofa, sink, microwave, mini fridge, a bathroom and assorted household items for our use, including a blow dryer. Upstairs is the very comfortable bed. We found it all to be clean and cozy. If you like to sleep late you might want to bring a sleep mask to block the light from the skylight. Or you can appreciate that it wakes you so you don't sleep away your precious time in Seattle! 

Capitol Hill is a lovely neighborhood. It was an easy bus ride to downtown, and a nice walk from the guest house to an area with tons of restaurants to choose from.

We will be recommending this place to our friends and if I get the chance to return to Seattle I would look forward to staying at the Blue Door again."
63308,33899751,2015-06-02,12214781,Kate,"We had a great time in Seattle! John and Craig's place was relaxing, quiet and clean- exactly the type of place you want to come home to after a long day of traveling and/or sightseeing. There is a bus near by but my boyfriend and I were able to walk it to most places, including pike place market (it's about 2.5 miles away, great way to see the city and get some exercise!) Capitol Hill itself is awesome- lots of cool restaurants and Craig gave us a bunch of recommendations that we loved. Two thumbs up for this place! "
63308,34430589,2015-06-08,8586949,Amber,"Great hosts, wonderful accommodations, all so centrally located!  Would definitely recommend and use again!  Five stars!!!"
63308,34747293,2015-06-11,35022802,Patty,John and Craig were wonderful hosts.  They were very responsive and helpful with every question I had. They were highly thoughtful and considerate.  They very clearly were interested in wanting my stay to be comfortable -  which it was.  The space was very clean and quite attractive. The bed was wonderfully comfortable and the location was ideal.  You simply cannot ask for anything more. 
63308,35011998,2015-06-14,4006645,Christopher,"Place is just as pictures indicate - compact, stylish.  Bed is very comfortable.  The place is very ""light"" - with the skylight and the frosted windows in the bedroom the light does come in very early in the summer (like 5am) so if light wakes you up you might bring something.  Great host, on time, place is spotlessly clean.  If you are someone who rents ""entire homes"" on airbnb because you prefer to cook instead of going out do note this place does not have a ""kitchen"" per se, just a microwave and small fridge (as you can see from the pictures).  The courtyard outside the place is wonderful, a great place to eat or work or just relax.  Internet speed not the fastest while I was there but adequate for email, etc. just not so much for streaming.  This area of Capitol Hill is quite beautiful, an easy walk to Volunteer Park - grocery stores and/or restaurants are a much longer walk or bus ride so the place is probably best for those with a car (as I had).  "
63308,35284684,2015-06-17,25523505,Stephen,Craig met us on time and went through all the details about the apartment and provided us a lot of good information about Seattle. 
63308,35462769,2015-06-19,8005600,Tammy,"This guest house was perfect in every way. John and Craig were easy to reach and made my super late arrival smooth and welcoming. The beautiful home included so many thoughtful touches from the stocked mini-refrigerator, the maps, pamphlets and personal notes about their neighborhood and city as well as their personal attention to details like luscious towels and sheets on the oh so comfy bed. Craig was a life-saver via immediate text when I forgot the bus stop closest to the house. This was my first airbnb experience and it could not have been more enjoyable. "
63308,36756210,2015-07-01,6688754,Lisa,"I can't say enough good things about this experience.  The place is absolutely charming and immaculate.  It met all of our needs and then some.  It is located in a lovely neighborhood within a short distance of wonderful restaurants and shops, not to mention it is not far from the water which I find particularly appealing.  Craig met us the first night to show us around, give instructions, and answer questions we had about available coffee houses and eateries nearby. We met John also before they were off on their own vacation.  Although they were not present for a good part of our time there, they made sure that everything was taken care of and assured us that they could easily be reached if need be. All in all we had a splendid time and give it two thumbs.  If one is visiting Seattle I highly recommend considering this little gem.  Thank you both, John and Craig."
63308,37283646,2015-07-06,2519150,Arnaud,"De locatie is prima te vinden in een mooie en rustige buurt van Seattle. Met het openbaar vervoer is het centrum goed te bereiken. We werden zeer gastvrij ontvangen. Het appartement is apart van het woonhuis waardoor je veel privacy hebt en heeft een leuke patio. Met het warme weer dat wij hadden, kwam deze patio goed van pas. John en Craig zijn zeer behulpzaam met adviezen over Seattle. Wat ons betreft een echte aanrader in Seattle."
63308,37560851,2015-07-08,4963583,Lauren,"We truly enjoyed our stay at John and Craig's. We ended our trip with a whirlwind tour of Seattle, and their location was perfect. They were very helpful and informative about the area, bus routes, restaurants, etc. Their home and garden were lovely, and the studio was very comfortable. Thanks again! "
63308,37763454,2015-07-10,27735313,Harald,"Wir hatten zum Start unserer Reise zwei Übernachtungen bei John und Craig gebucht. Der Kontakt war sehr professionell und sympathisch. Der war für die Verhältnisse in Seattle gut. Bei unserer Ankunft haben wir John und Craig und ihre drei lieben Hunde kennengelernt. Die Unterkunft war ein separates Studio mit Loft-Charakter. Alles war sehr sauber und nett eingerichtet. Das Bett war super bequem. Der Kühlschrank war sogar mit Getränken für uns eingerichtet. Und als absolutes Highlight waren die beiden auch noch so nett, uns am ersten Abend zu ihrem Lieblings-Diner zu fahren. Insgesamt super Erfahrung. Immer wieder gerne zu John und Craig!"
63308,39477398,2015-07-24,8686725,Thomas,"This Airbnb was perfect! John and Craig were extremely helpful and brilliant communicating information before the stay, and also during our visit. 

The apartment was a great size for two to share and beautifully decorated. A great location with off-the-street parking making it perfect. 

Would definitely recommend. "
63308,39760148,2015-07-26,33836743,Laura,Craig showed us around when we got in and we spent the next two days enjoying their adorable studio. The place was very cute and just like the pictures. Loved our stay and hope to return!
63308,40070523,2015-07-28,18939983,Andrew,"I have no hesitation in recommending John and Craig's studio. It is ideal for a couple or single person. Capitol Hill is a great location and well served by public transport. John and Craig are both very helpful and friendly. Craig met us when we arrived and explained what we needed to know about the apartment and area. The studio is immaculate, stocked with complementary tea, coffee and soft drinks and a lot of helpful information about the city. We hope to return to Seattle and would definitely stay here again.  "
63308,40706190,2015-08-02,26311848,Matt,"A great city and a perfect base to explore it from! The studio was just perfect and exactly as it is described. John and Craig were very helpful and in addition provided lots of information in the studio about the area. The studio is ideally situated in a beautiful area, with offroad parking and just one block from the bus route. We had a great stay and if we were ever to be so lucky as to return to Seattle we would not hesitate in returning to the studio. "
63308,41579114,2015-08-08,29437774,Joshua,"We thought John and Craig's studio was a terrific base of operations for our 5-day Seattle vacation. Craig greeted us when we arrived, showed us around the studio, and made us feel at home. He was quite gracious, striking the perfect balance between welcoming host and respectful landlord. We felt as if John and Craig were there for us if we needed anything, but allowed us to do our own thing and have our own space.

The studio itself was very comfortable. About the size of a hotel room, split between two levels, it is definitely not huge, and the upstairs area around the bed is limited. So there isn't a ton of storage space, but we thought it was enough.  The neighborhood is lovely, quiet, and a few blocks from Volunteer Park.  It is a bit removed from the commercial center of Capitol Hill -- about a mile's walk to the first set of shops, and another half mile or so to the Pine/Pike corridor. We rented a car for part of our stay, and were able to park it in the lot at the studio which was incredibly convenient. Ubers and public buses were also easily accessible to/from the studio. "
63308,42128725,2015-08-11,5413871,Samir,"We had a comfortable and pleasant stay at John & Craig's guest studio. The studio was cozy, well organized and looks like the pictures. Craig interacted with us before and during our stay and helped us with anything we had questions on. We liked the location and it's proximity to downtown and places to see and visit . Uber was terrific and got us anywhere and everywhere very reasonably from here. We hope to visit Seattle and the guest studio possibly, sometime again. "
63308,43493364,2015-08-20,34537868,Travis,"Craig welcomed us when we arrived in Capital Hill. He was very thorough showing us around, making sure we were comfortable with everything in the studio and very great to talk to. He also had plenty of good recommendations of things to do in the neighborhood and downtown. We would love to stare there again if we're ever in the area. It was very close to anything you might want to do in Seattle either touristy or local. "
63308,44408312,2015-08-26,1278063,Danielle,"We had a great time staying at John and Craig's studio. It was spacious, very comfortable, clean, and located in a great neighborhood. The hosts were exceedingly hospitable, friendly, and very knowledgeable about Seattle. There were so many little touches that made it such a great experience, even down to the gourmet coffee available in the room. I highly recommend this listing! "
63308,44895211,2015-08-30,2994671,Esha,"My husband and I had a great time. The studio was cosy and very cute. John and Craig are really nice and Craig had great recommendations. They were also very responsive. We loved the neighborhood, walking around Volunteer Park,  and checking out all the bars and cafes near by. I highly recommend this place. "
63308,45548887,2015-09-04,4561844,Paul,"Lovely place in a great location. Lots of information regarding things to do in Seattle. Good recommendations about where to eat in Capitol Hill, if you like Pho (Vietnam) go to PhoCyclo on Broadway. We did not drive in Seattle, the bus was a short walk away which took you to the centre of town. A great place to stay"
63308,45767999,2015-09-06,7560546,Suzanne,John and Craig were great hosts. The place was extremely clean and well kept. Parking was so easy. In a great location. They were very accommodating would recommend to anyone staying in Seattle. 
63308,46263762,2015-09-09,122385,Laishan,John and Craig's place was a beautiful apartment and very close to lots of lovely restaurants and cafes around. Great base to explore Seattle! Very safe neighborhood too. My and husband and I enjoyed our stay very much. They were great hosts who accommodated to our early arrival and provided us with a tour of the apartment and gave great recommendations of what to eat around the area. They gave us our privacy but we're readily available if we ever needed anything (which we didn't!).
63308,47258281,2015-09-17,39073291,Samantha,"We only met Craig upon our arrival since we got in later but he was inviting and very helpful on places to eat and see. They provided us coffee, OJ, water, and soda. Craig also told us of a great places to eat in the area and told us everything we needed to know about the space. Overall a wonderful place to stay!"
63308,48380414,2015-09-26,7077835,Denise,"John & Craig were very communicative before I checked my friend in, so we didn't have to struggle to find the contact and location info. Craig met us promptly and was very helpful in orienting her to all the amenities-- drinks and snacks aplenty in the fridge! The studio is very inviting, comfortable, and stylish, and the location is great--near Volunteer Park and cool coffee shops, restaurants, and public transportation. Thanks for your hospitality! Highly recommend this for a couple or a single traveler. "
63308,49422700,2015-10-04,1819847,Chris,"John and Craig's space was perfect. Craig met us when we arrived, went through a thorough tour of the space and answered all of our questions before we asked them. They even provided some drinks and freshly ground coffee for us. The location is also wonderful, fairly quiet and residential, but just minutes from a bus stop and downtown. "
63308,49791795,2015-10-06,2664841,Emily,"Had a wonderful stay at John and Craig's studio! Craig was there to welcome me when I got it, and was very kind and hospitable. The apartment was perfect -- nice, clean, and in a beautiful neighborhood. Walking distance to cool restaurants and coffee shops--and I even walked to the downtown area, which is about a 30 mins walking.  I definitely recommend staying here!  "
63308,50433831,2015-10-12,36292461,Ulrich,"We found John's guest studio exactly the same as it is described on the airbnb website. Everything needed is available - linen, towels, hairdryer, coffeemachine, water-kettle - even some softdrinks, milk, coffee (never to be missed in Seattle), tea are provided to start well into the next morning.

Upon our arrival we got some good hints, how to find the nearby busstop to downtown (5 min walk) and restaurants (15-20 min walk). 
 
It is a very cosy home for a stay, nice view to the garden, really nice and apparently safe neighbourhood Capitol Hill, the must to visit Volunteer Park in near walking distance (20 min) with spectacular views to the Spaceneedle and the waters around Seattle. The guesthouse is really nicely decorated with Pictures on the walls, a funny clown decorated to the handrail, books and maps, bus-plans etc. are provided.

In short - if you are planning to visit Seattle and look for a place to stay without need for nightlife entertainment next door - John's Guest Studio is a perfect choice.

John also provides"
63308,50833833,2015-10-15,38114806,Kaley,"Craig and John's guest house was extremely cozy for our three night stay. Craig was nice enough to walk us through the guest house when we arrived (even though we were a bit early). They gave us coffee, drinks in the fridge, extra blankets, and then gave us total privacy. We were able to check out at 5 am to ensure we made it home at a decent time. We really loved our stay in Seattle and hope to move there in the next few months."
63308,51055523,2015-10-17,32988126,Tomo,"John and Craig were fantastic hosts. They greeted us upon arrival, answered all of our questions about the apartment and the neighborhood, and made us feel 100% welcomed. 

The place itself is charming, clean, and located in a beautiful part of Capitol Hill. 

We had a great time and would stay there again in a heartbeat. "
63308,51641373,2015-10-22,13047643,Trina,This place is wonderful! The bed is so comfortable & the shower is always has hot water. I felt great during my stay. I spelt peacefully. The neighborhood is sweet. Make sure to go to volunteer park in the morning.
63308,51706381,2015-10-24,37634064,Jensen,"We enjoyed every minute while we were in Seattle. Staying at John and Craig's place was the icing on the cake. Upon arrival we were graciously greeted by Craig and got a tour of the place, along with lots of information regarding the city and transportation. The place is in a great location in reference to pikes place, tourist spots, and pubs. Upon leaving, we had a nice chat with John as he was leaving for work. Such a great place to stay! We look forward to coming back someday for a longer stay."
63308,52591480,2015-10-31,12707449,Bruce,"Janet and I enjoyed staying at John and Craig's place. It is set in a quiet leafy and secure area of one of Seattles premier suburbs.

63308,52826047,2015-11-02,41421325,Kandida,"John & Craig's guest studio was perfect! The space itself is welcoming and comfortable. The location is incredible. A bus stop right around the corner, a 10-15 minute walk to Volunteer Park Cafe- which is super cute and has great food! Craig was wonderful- he suggested several great places to eat and visit, and could quickly and graciously give you turn-by-turn directions and fun facts and trivia about the city. We had a fantastic time, and can't wait to go back!"
63308,53112095,2015-11-05,42796053,Mary,"I was welcomed warmly by Craig, ginger and spencer.  Craig walked me through the studio and answered any and all questions I had.  Pamphlets of the Seattle area are provided, as well as local (Capitol Hill) eatery's and attractions.  John takes the time to create a list of things to do for the month that visitors may not know otherwise. 
The studio is beautifully kept and the neighborhood is very safe.  I was their alone and had no concern walking in the area.
I used uber the entire time and never waited more than 5 minutes for my ride and was downtown within 15 minutes.
If I ever go to Seattle again, I will plan it around the availability of John and Craig's studio."
63308,53244193,2015-11-07,15217419,Veronica,Awesome place!! Made everything easy for us to come and go as we pleased. We met Craig and he showed us the place. Very nice guy who answered all of our questions and even has some instructions in the house how to go to the different places in the neighborhood. There a short walk from the bus that we used to take us to pike place and around Capitol Hill. The bed was so comfortable and everything was clean. I'm so glad we stayed here! 
63308,53677164,2015-11-11,21804207,Cynthia,"John and Craig are wonderful hosts.  They welcomed us into their comfortable apartment with warmth and a thorough introduction to the space, the neighborhood and the city.  The apartment was very clean and nicely decorated.  It was well stocked and had most everything one would need to have a comfortable stay.  They added nice extras such a fresh ground coffee, milk, sugar and juice for the morning. We enjoyed the patio which was beautifully lush with trees and plants.  The bed and pillows were quite comfortable and wrapped in beautiful linen and bedding.  We very much enjoyed our stay and will put this spot on our list of places to stay in Seattle.  Thanks guys for a very nice lodging experience in your great city."
63308,53885242,2015-11-14,45103290,William,"John and Craig's place was charming and cozy.

They were very welcoming, giving us a tour and tips on where to eat when we got in late that night. We had plenty of privacy but knew they were available if we had any questions or issues. This part of Capitol Hill was quiet and residential, but just a short ride from all the restaurants. Would highly recommend staying here!"
63308,55719572,2015-12-05,14144533,Martina,"I had a great stay at John and Craig's studio in seattle. A wonderful welcome, coffee, milk and juice in the fridge and organic hair products in the shower.  It's in a gorgeous area of seattle and easy to get to downtown via bus or a lovely long downhill walk to the heart of everything.
If I'm back in seattle, I will definitely stay at the studio!"
63308,55951881,2015-12-07,17620368,Molly Jenna,This was by far the nicest/easiest/cleanest AirB&B experience my husband and I have ever had. We will be suggesting it to our family and friends. 
3270492,15417826,2014-07-08,14256455,Tingting,"Max's place is in the best location ever. 5 mins walk to Melrose street which has a lot of funny restaurants, 7 mins walk to the downtown shopping center. 15 mins to the pike market. You can almost walk to all the place in downtown and also near the bus station and Link. 

The house is clean and cozy, Max is super nice and recommend some nice places in Seattle for us too. Great trip in Seattle. Thanks Max."
3270492,16105977,2014-07-22,16221033,Sam,"Max was a gracious host. The room was as advertised, very clean and a great view in a fairly quiet neighborhood. He was at the apartment upon my arrival. The private bathroom was also very clean. Great location only a couple blocks from Seattle Downtown. I high recommend the room to the people who will come to the Seattle."
3270492,16902790,2014-08-04,6603858,Ps,"Maximillian was a wonderful host. He allowed us to check-in way earlier than the check-in time and was prompt in all queries. We were very fortunate to be able to stay at his wonderful apartment which looks exactly like the picture. After a week-long of cruising, the space is great! Very very centrally located with downtown on the left and a few choice restaurants a short walk on the right. Highly recommended for anyone whether you are on business (convention centre is a stone-throw away) or to the shops (8 - 10 min walk). Pike's Place Market is maybe a 13 min walk away. Thanks Maximiliian for a wonderful stay."
3270492,17445731,2014-08-12,3351431,Victoria,"Max's apartment was in an ideal location. 10 to 15 minute walk to Pike Place market and other beautiful surrounding towns. Max has everything you need; your own bedroom, bath and plenty of shared common areas. Max keeps his bathroom, kitchen and laundry fully stocked. I don't travel with much and he provided everything I needed. I will definitely stay there again!"

3270492,18408598,2014-08-26,4973734,Michael,"Max was a wonderful and gracious host. When I arrived, he greeted me on the street and helped me carry my bags to the room. The accommodations were pleasant, clean and quiet. 

The location can't be beat - 10 minutes' walk to Pike Place Market, and easy access to everything downtown.

Max also suggested an excellent coffee shop, as well as other local spots that I enjoyed. I would not hesitate to recommend Max's place to anyone!"
3270492,18792553,2014-09-01,16689993,Michael,We arrived late on Friday and Max had everything ready for us to settle in. He has a very nice apartment and it was evident he cared about making our experience comfortable. 
3270492,19031284,2014-09-05,3845690,Marion,"Max est un hôte parfait. Trés bon communicant, chaleureux, plein de bon conseil et présent ce qu'il faut. 
Nous nous sommes vraiment bien senti chez lui et l'emplacement de son appartement nous a permis de tout faire à pied!"
3270492,19517957,2014-09-14,534656,Kris,"Max was there to greet us when we arrived.  His home is just as described, and it was lovely having a private room and bath.  We were quite busy on this 4-day trip, so didn't get a lot of time to chat with Max, but he loved hearing about our adventures, and made us feel relaxed and right at home.  The location was perfect for us.  We were on foot primarily, and easily visited numerous sites, and used public transit to get all over, and there are multiple stops right near Max's apartment, which made it super easy.  It was nice to get back and plop onto our comfy bed after all the walking we did each day.  We're grateful Max made his home available to us for this trip - it was perfect (and the weather he ordered up for us was great, too!)"
3270492,20340289,2014-09-28,15612564,Brad And Ila,"Max was great and he was very easy to reach to meet up with.  The apt is beautifully decorated with lots of natural light and the room was spacious and clean. You also have your own bathroom.  Max was very friendly and had coffee, wine, and water readily available to us, which I thought was very considerate.  He also gave us use of his washer and dryer.  The apt is in a great location and accessible to all parts of town.  Max was a wonderful host and I highly recommend his apt for your visit. "
3270492,20687527,2014-10-04,321452,Lawrence,"As an Airbnb host, it's always wonderful to stay with other members of the Airbnb community when I'm traveling. Max has a fantastic apartment with very easy access to downtown and the convention center. Clean and bright, the room is comfortably apportioned and I slept like a dream on the mattress. Max is delightful and very accommodating. I would stay with him again in a heartbeat."
3270492,20990431,2014-10-09,9442736,Peter,"Maximillian was very welcoming and helpful. The location is excellent for easy foot exploration of downtown Seattle. However, there is considerable traffic noise from the nearby I-5 freeway 24 hours a day. The room opens directly into the living room area by way of two opposing sliding doors which have frosted glass panels in them. As a result, if someone were talking in the living room with the lights on, there would be more sound and light penetration into the room at night than if the room had a standard door. (However, this never happened during my two-night stay.) Nevertheless, this lodging is a very good value."
3270492,21237932,2014-10-13,9197727,Killian,Max was very welcoming. The apartment is very nice.  The apartment is in a very good location downtown within walking distance to everything. Highly recommend staying with Max! 
3270492,22110039,2014-10-30,20570591,Michael,"Max was an excellent host and the desecription was on point! Max went out of his to make sure I got there, then left the rest up to me. The accomodations were exactly as posted. 
Max is a great person, very accomodating and made it easy.

The location is very ideal and in the heart of town.

Highly recommend. "
3270492,22361585,2014-11-04,21337684,Dari,"My boyfriend and I were visiting the Seattle area for our anniversay weekend and decided to try out airbnb for the 1st time.  Our experience with Max was great.  He always replied to us promptly prior to our stay and made us felt welcome when we arrived.  The location of the apartment was very convenient and our room was pretty roomy and the private bathroom was a big plus. Max was busy working, so it was almost like we had the whole place to ourselves.  No complaints on our first airbnb experience! "
3270492,22773230,2014-11-14,4935188,Mari,"Maximillian was a great host, his condo was clean and welcoming, and located right off of Pike and 9th Ave. His building is safe, secure, and was quiet for being so close to the city center. Although I didn't spend a lot of time with Maximillian as our schedules varied...in the few exchanges we had he was VERY helpful in offering restaurant recommendations, cultural event tips, and was a delight to talk to about his theatre experience. I'd highly recommend Maximillian's place as a nice place to stay while in Seattle. "
3270492,22979557,2014-11-19,12378355,Will,"Max's place was great - clean, spacious, everything I needed for my short business trip. Max was a great host - communicating really well in advance, welcoming me when I arrived late Sunday evening after a long flight and providing everything I needed."
