6448099,43245717,2015-08-18,36687607,Jake,"Elaine was an excellent host. We rented out the entire house, and we loved it. I had my family along with my parents and we fit in the house very well. Elaine's house was like brand new, we especially enjoyed the open area for the kitchen, dining, and living room.  Great for us to be able to relax and spend time together after a day exploring the city.  The location is also great!  A lot of local restaurants and coffee shops in the neighborhood within walking distance.  It's also just a few short minutes to downtown Seattle.

Elaine is also very hospitable. We were in contact at the time of booking, before arrival, and during my stay when I had questions.  She always responded quickly and had suggestions whenever I asked about things in the local area.  Anyone who rents from Elaine is going to get excellent treatment, and I highly recommend her as a host!"

5029665,27655457,2015-03-09,10396440,Ernie,"Rosemary has one of the nicest properties I have stayed at for a great value.  It was my first time in Seattle, and the property is just a stonesthrow away from great bars and restaurants.  The property itself is spacious, clean, very fast wifi, and has great views of the Greenlake area.  Communication with Rosemary was very easy and responds quickly if you have any questions.  She was even welcomed us with a nice bottle of local red wine.  I highly recommend renting this property for any length of time."
5029665,36694965,2015-06-30,15101358,Carlos,"We had a very nice time at Rosemary's place.  We felt right at home.  The neighborhood was super relaxed, quiet and friendly.  The house allowed space for privacy and focused work as well.  We would definitely go back.  Minor issue, ""act of God"" given the unusual 90 degree weather during our stay, the top bedroom was super hot.  Other than that, we had a great time."
5029665,37579756,2015-07-08,34942048,Lisa,"
This was my first Airbnb rental and it was a total success. The house is perfect. Lovely finishes, perfect location, beautiful view of Green Lake

Rosemary left very detailed instructions about the house and activities in the neighborhood
I would definitley rent the house again"
5029665,40739016,2015-08-02,33765137,Shirley,This home is absolutely beautiful and comfortable (except we happen to be in Seattle during a heat spell and most homes are not equipped with air conditioning) and we were greeted by a bottle of wine and chocolates. The house is in a wonderful neighborhood and if we were ever to move to Seattle this neighborhood would be 1st on our list.  The cost to stay at Rosemary's home was very reasonable and we recommend this BNB. 
1022135,5236371,2013-06-19,288769,Elliott,"Sara is just a superb host with a beautiful house.  Located in North Seattle, with easy access to 5 to go north or  downtown and parts south, a few minutes from Green Lake, a quick ride to Ballard and Fremont, and easy access to Lake Washington, 520 and east. Parking is easy and abundant.  You feel like you are a 10 minute drive from anywhere. 

Sara, who is a charming and fascinating person, has a wonderful open planned house.  The main floor consists of a nice living and dining room and kitchen, elegantly furnished and very warm and inviting.  Everything is clean, thoughtfully arranged, and truly reflects Sara's personality.

The guest bedroom is upstairs and faces west. A wonderful 18 inch thick natural futon on a platform bed is perfect and comforting, with oriental carved night stands. There is overhead, standing and reading lights.  With 10 foot ceilings, and massive windows, you get beautiful natural lighting.  The bathroom is very modern, with a new and modern shower, bathroom and toilet.  The room has a wonderful walk in closet as well.

Sara leaves little keepsakes and positive messages.  Throughout the house are inspirational messages, books, and art.  This is a person who is very insightful and has a great deal to share.  The house is quiet - there is no pressure to socialize and yet you feel like spending time to talk and reflect.  

This is a very special place, owned by a very special person, and serves as a perfect point to venture into Seattle. "
1022135,5816580,2013-07-17,7304536,Xi,"Sara is really a good and friendly host. Her house is very quiet and clean, and also close to the downtown.

I enjoy the days I stayed in Seattle!"
1022135,5935410,2013-07-22,454888,Dal,"Sara was very accommodating - booking us the same day for the weekend. Bathrooms needed cleaning & carpets needed a vacuum. But can't complain due to short notice and special offer. Area is not kid friendly, but her place is :)"
1022135,7164673,2013-09-09,7813664,Kseniya,"Sara was a wonderful host! She is very friendly, fun, and quick to respond to messages.The house was cozy, clean, and full of inspirational notes that brightened my day. I stayed for about a month while I interned in the area and by the end it felt like home. The kitchen was also well-equipped and I had a lot of fun cooking there and sharing stories. 

I was able to get around without a car (there are two buses that stop close to the house that go to Fremont/Downtown Seattle) but I recommend driving at night since it can be a bit of a trip depending on where you're going. 

Thanks Sara! I recommend.

1818768,8361182,2013-10-27,2885037,Chanah,"It was great staying with Daniel and Lizzy! Their place was very comfortable, and they made us feel at home."
1818768,8514298,2013-11-03,9447483,Bo And Shaina,"The location is great, and the hosts were so inviting. Our stay was enjoyable,  and we even cooked some lunch on the second day using Daniel's pans. The bed is a small pad on elevated wood planks, but it did the job. The room is spacious, and we felt comfortable enough to watch a movie in the living room. Thanks for the great stay!"
1818768,8701663,2013-11-12,9671473,Liz (And Jon),"Daniel and Lizzy were excellent hosts! They were very helpful, kind, and respectful. Their apartment is in a great location, we were able to walk around Capitol Hill and to the downtown area. The room was comfortable, and their place had everything we needed. "
1818768,8776111,2013-11-17,3493652,Peter,"Glad I stayed with Daniel and Lizzy during my visit to Seattle. They were very helpful in answering my questions and I enjoyed chatting with both of them. The location can't be beat as it is a 2 minute walk from Safeway, 5 minutes from QFC and 2 minutes to the bus stop to head downtown. It is impossible to go hungry with many restaurants 5-10 minutes away by foot. The bed is a pad mattress but it was very comfortable and everything I needed was provided. Really fast and consistent wifi speeds were the icing on the cake. Can’t go wrong staying here!"
1818768,9202942,2013-12-13,9654025,Valeria,"I spent almost three weeks with Daniel and Lizzy and they always made me feel at home. I can count on them in any situation and we became friends. They are very nice end welcoming. 

The apartment is in a great area of the city, very easy to reach downtown by bus or walking. The room was comfortable and I was also invited to use their kitchen. I strongly recommend to  spend some time in this apartment."
1818768,9283297,2013-12-18,7408923,Mitchell,"Daniel's place was very comfortable and easy to find. The place is also not too far of a walk from downtown, with buses available easily as well. Daniel and his wife Lizzy were friendly and great hosts! Would definitely stay here again sometime. "
1818768,10134047,2014-02-02,10765515,Ben,Daniel and Lizzy were great! They were super easy to get along with and were always able to provide helpful advice or suggestions on where to go. The room itself was perfect for my stay.
1818768,10181515,2014-02-04,4581988,Emily,Daniel and Lizzy were incredibly friendly and accommodating.  We were free to use the kitchen and living area and even got to watch their Netflix/HBO Go one night when we came home early.  The place is very conveniently located - we walked to and from downtown a couple of times (about 25 minutes one way) but also got to explore Capitol Hill which is a great area.  We had a car and were provided with their extra parking pass so didn't need to worry about parking or moving the car at all the entire weekend.  The bed was a bit firm but did the job and the room was spacious with a large closet and its own temperature control.  Thanks so much for having us!
1818768,10496649,2014-02-22,4256099,Jake,Dan and Lizzy were the best people ever. They were super helpful and Dan even parked our car cause we weren't used to seattle parking. I had heaps of funny hanging out and chatting with them. they live in a perfect spot super cool and close to a great burger shop called dicks. (Cheese burgers are only $1.50!!!!!) If I ever come back to seattle I'll be staying with them. One thing I found out about Daniel in our time together is he loves being called DANGA. 
1818768,11128806,2014-03-22,3606808,Julie,I didn't get to chat with Daniel and Lizzy too much as I was out and about most of my time in Cap. Hill however they were extremely pleasant and were fantastic hosts! The room is perfect for someone traveling on their own but would also work just fine for a couple of people. The thing I liked most about staying here was the location! The neighborhood is really quaint but is still walking distance to everything you'd want to see in Capitol Hill with a totally do-able walk to Downtown Seattle. Book this room! 
1818768,11190596,2014-03-24,6357744,Vicky,"This was our first Airbnb experience and it was great!  The location is super convenient, close to the bus, restaurants, bank and market. Daniel and Lizzy were friendly and helpful, would stay here again!"
1818768,11329135,2014-03-30,6662710,Gabriella,"Daniel and Lizzy were fantastic hosts! They are both incredibly friendly, and their apartment is excellently located with easy access to food and transit. Downtown Seattle is only a 40-minute walk away, or you can easily catch a bus to wherever you need to be in Seattle. You really can't beat this location. As for the room itself, the bed is quite firm, but after a day's worth of being a tourist, it does the job. The in-room heating unit was a nice bonus, making for a very pleasant stay. I definitely enjoyed staying with them and would recommend them to anybody looking for a nice quiet place to stay near the young and hip neighborhoods of Seattle."
1818768,12015382,2014-04-21,13752007,Duke,"Daniel and Lizzy were exceptional hosts! We didn't spend a lot of time in the apartment, but what little we did, the couple was helpful and insightful. I thoroughly enjoyed my visit and would definitely recommend/stay there again."

Located right in Capitol Hill with close proximity to great bars and restaurants I definitely recommend the stay with Daniel and Lizzy. Both are really nice and helpful especially for me that just moved to the states from Europe.
Thanks for having me!!!!"
1818768,13478745,2014-05-28,14544476,Lindsey,This was a good first experience with airbnb. Daniel and Lizzy were away most of the time but super polite and easy going and the location was great. Made it all around Seattle without a car and even walked downtown. Would stay again if I'm in the area. Thanks! 
1818768,14359484,2014-06-17,15684991,Suneil,"Daniel and Lizzy were amazing hosts. Not only were they fun to chat with, but they were also very helpful anytime something was needed. The room and apartment overall were very comfortable -- felt right at home. 

Great stay, amazing location, and fantastic people--easily a 5-star rating. "
1818768,14565590,2014-06-22,15610731,Sophia,"Daniel & Lizzy are a nice young polite couple who are welcoming and helpful.  Perfect location in town, happy with my first airbnb experience!"
1818768,14912560,2014-06-29,15157579,Jessica,"What a great stay!!  Daniel and Lizzie are great people and the room is perfect. Good size bed, clean, and very spacious. Location is great, lots of things to do around the area and you can walk everywhere. Definitely staying here next time!!"

The location was AMAZING. We walked to Pikes Place the first day, and took public transit every day thereafter (about 15 minutes). The area is super cute too. "
1818768,15546555,2014-07-11,17039463,Lee,What a great stay at a nice apartment with wonderful hosts. Daniel and Lizzy were exceptionally nice and accommodating. Their place was in great walking distance to all of the cool spots in Capitol Hill and a half hour walk to Pike Place. We would gladly stay here again and recommend it to anyone else.
1818768,15969554,2014-07-19,17107323,Tali,"Daniel and Lizzy are super nice, They are great hosts and are very welcoming. The location is great, a short walk from bars and resturants, and really close to bus stops to go anywhere in the city. "
1818768,16104933,2014-07-22,12376428,Emelie,"We spent a weekend in Seattle and had a great stay in Capitol Hill with Daniel and Lizzy. 
Daniel and Lizzy are a great and friendly couple, easy to talk to and answered any questions we had. 
The area was great, walking distance to pretty much everything. 
The entire weekend was great and if there is any negative pointers, the place could have been cleaned a little more upon arrival. But overall a great stay! 
"
1818768,16227892,2014-07-23,16066228,시현,"I stayed 2 days in Daniel's room with my brother:) Daniel&Lizzy are perfectly friendly and we got super great time in seattle! thanks alot!!
It's available distance to walk to downtown from the house so we usually walk to downtown.(Seattle's bus fee is expensive!!X_X) "
1818768,16413441,2014-07-27,7105987,Sophie,"Our stay was great, the apartment was clean, our hosts were very nice and helpful and the location was perfect ! :)"
1818768,16579404,2014-07-29,8315679,Joe,"Daniel was a great host for my quick trip to Seattle! He was very friendly and had a great knowledge of Seattle and the fun places to check out while I was there. The apartment was clean and comfortable, and the parking pass was a huge help as parking in Seattle can be difficult. "
1818768,18439585,2014-08-26,19272466,Leyla,"My partner and I spent four days with Daniel and Lizzy. They were extremely accommodating, helpful and afforded us plenty of space to go about our business. They both seem pretty old hand at the airbnb game and know just how to play it. Their apartment is perfectly situated in Capitol Hill just a few minutes stroll from the best bars and eateries in Seattle. If you want to see Seattle, stay here. "
1818768,18564709,2014-08-28,19474916,Ian,"Really chill couple with a nice, clean bedroom. Good location and very hospitable. "
1818768,19039097,2014-09-05,19388052,Ted,"Dan and Lizzy were very friendly and laid back and they seemed to genuinely love meeting new travelers. They gave me great food and bar recommendations and helped me make sense of Seattle's enigmatic weather which helped in planning my day out in Bainbridge.  

The room was clean and comfy with ample closet space and an oscillating fan which helped draw in the cool air from outside.  The noise level was about medium.  You can hear neighbors above at times and there's a street and parking lot nearby but it should be fine for all but the lightest of sleepers.

What truly stood out about my stay is the location. Capitol Hill is very hip and trendy and within a few minutes' walk you have access to a beautiful park, countless bars and restaurants, a great bakery, a supermarket, and almost every other kind of shop you could imagine.  The periphery of downtown is about a 20 minute walk and there are several bus lines nearby which can take you just about anywhere.

If having things to do nearby is a priority then I highly recommend booking this!  I would stay again!"
1818768,19377792,2014-09-11,3562197,Nirav,"Daniel and Lizzy were fantastic hosts. They were very flexible about my travel plans, and even invited me to join them and their friends for wine one night. And their place is in a fantastic location. I'd definitely stay with them again."
1818768,20534163,2014-09-30,4635990,Franklin,"We had a great time in Seattle staying with Daniel and Liz. They made us feel super welcome and gave great recommendations for things to do and see around Seattle. The apartment is close to lots of restaurants and bars in the Capitol Hill area and fairly close to downtown (15-20 minute walk).
The room was quiet and clean, the bed comfy, and we'd love to stay there again."
1818768,20871361,2014-10-06,21857291,Katherine,Cozy place in a great neighborhood - walking distance or a bus ride away from everywhere we wanted to go. Daniel and Lizzy were very welcoming too!
1818768,22748379,2014-11-13,12393648,Brian,"Very comfortable room in an ideally located Capitol Hill apartment. I didn't get to spend too much time talking to Daniel, but he was very kind and more than accommodating when I needed to push back my arrival until around 10:30 on a Monday night. The apartment is about a five minute walk from a bus stop where you can catch a bus that will have you downtown in under 10 minutes and it's very close to a number of good bars and restaurants. "
1818768,22972067,2014-11-18,19665983,Claire,"We had a very great time in Seattle staying with Daniel and Lizzy. We've booked just a day before and the organization was quick and perfect. The room is very large in their basement. This apartment is located in Capitol Hill, with a lot of  nice bars and restaurants and from 20 min walk to go to DW (with a starbucks between to grab a coffee).
We were most of the time out of the house, visiting this beautiful city but Daniel and Lizzy are both very nice and cool.

Nous avons passés un super moment chez Daniel et Lizzy. Nous avions réservés juste un jour avant et l'organisation a été rapide et parfaite. La chambre est grande avec leur appartement en sous sol. Cet appartement est situé à Capitol Hill, avec pleins de bars et de restau sympas. Il est situé à 20 min à pied du centre avec un starbucks au milieu pour prendre un café.
Nous étions la plus part du temps hors de la maison pour visiter cette magnifique ville mais Daniel et Lizzy sont super sympa et cool. ;-)"

Was happy to be able to control our own room heater as we weren't used to the cold. Restaurants and coffee shops just three blocks away and it was easy to access via public transportation as described. Thanks for the great stay!"
1818768,26653671,2015-02-16,27486196,Jacob,Daniel and Lizzie are great folks. We didn't cross paths a whole lot during our stay but they were very friendly and welcoming. Their place is very conveniently located right in Capitol Hill and is quiet with minimal street noise. Thanks for having us!

1818768,27056599,2015-02-24,26016278,Roxanne,"Daniel and Lizzy were both very friendly and accommodating. The room was clean and neat.

1818768,28931445,2015-04-01,24788793,Jessi & Chris,"Wir haben im März '15 eine Woche bei Lizzy und Daniel verbracht. Die Beiden sind super freundlich und offen. Bei Fragen, Problemen und Empfehlungen hatten Sie immer ein offenes Ohr. Das Zimmer selbst ist einwandfrei. Außerdem durften wir Küche und Wohnzimmer mit benutzen, sehr praktisch. Die Lage der Wohnung ist für Seattle perfekt. Direkt nebenan befindet sich ein großer Supermarkt.  Das Viertel selbst ist sehr Hip und beherrbergt viele kleine Bars, CoffeeShops, Boutiquen und Restaurants. Keine 2 Gehminuten entfernt befindet sich  die Bushaltestelle nach Downtown. Aber auch zu  Fuss ist z.B. die Space Needle nur ca. 30 min entfernt. 
Wir haben unsere Zeit bei Lizzy und Daniel sehr genossen und können ihre Wohnung und Sie selbst jedem Urlauber empfehlen.

We only met Lizzy briefly, but she seemed lovely. The apartment was in a great neighborhood, and was an ideal home base while we tramped around Seattle. Really enjoyed our time in Seattle... Thanks Daniel and Lizzy!"
1818768,30882214,2015-04-28,7250959,Anastasia,"Daniel was a great and friendly host! He was very accommodating and helpful. The apartment was in a perfect location. It's right in Capitol Hill, which is surrounded by tons of restaurants, bars, stores, etc. and everything was practically walking distance. We didn't get a chance to meet Lizzy, but I'm sure she's wonderful as well! Would definitely consider staying here again if me and my friend were to visit again. "

1818768,48011330,2015-09-22,40711007,Jessica,"We arrived at Daniel and Lizzy's for the last stop on our honeymoon. They were very sweet to leave us a bottle of wine, welcome card, and fresh towels. Daniel walked out to greet us and help us park, which was great since we showed up at around 7:30/8PM and it was dark. They had company over so it was great to meet new people and we were welcomed to join in their board game night. Throughout the visit they were very accommodating with the use of their kitchen. The neighborhood was great to walk around and only a 20-25 minute walk to Pike Place. The bed wasn't as comfortable as we had hoped, but the room was spacious enough and had ample closet space for us to spread out."
1818768,48897410,2015-09-29,41207783,Kathy,"Daniel and Lizzy were warm, welcoming and accommodating. We had an enjoyable stay and everything was as advertised. We really enjoyed the location and would be happy to stay there again!"
1817878,8860938,2013-11-22,9872464,Brian,"This is a well-located and very good value two-bedroom apartment. I am very glad we chose it. It has a dishwasher, a nice washer and dryer, a microwave, wifi, and a big TV (that I never turned on). The furnishings are Ikea level. They do the job.

I needed to find accommodation on short notice near Swedish Hospital. Heberto gave me very quick feedback on availability, and clear directions after he accepted my request. The apartment is professionally managed as far as linens, towels and cleaning between occupants is concerned. It is not a homey, mingle-with-the-owners situation, so keep searching if that is what you want. I just wanted a nice, practical apartment and this is it!

The 3 & 4 bus lines go directly downtown for only $2.25. The restaurant and business district between Pike and Pine and between about 12th and 18th are 20-25 minutes very pleasant walk away. Swedish Hospital (Cherry Hill Campus) is under 10 minutes walk to the north. Seattle University is 10 minutes walk to the northwest. A cab ride downtown takes about 15 minutes and costs a little over $10 plus tip. Parking in the neighborhood is a little tight but was workable, and we were so well-located we barely used our car.

Some memorable swanky restaurants were Poco and Anchovies and Olives. Pettirosso is more homey and reasonably priced and I'd definitely have repeated Pettirosso if I'd stayed longer.

Stumptown, about 15 minutes walk from the apartment, was my coffee go-to. Broadcast is a new and friendly entry that I should have paid more attention to, but it was the opposite direction from the way I was usually headed out the door. The apartment itself has a basic coffee maker that will tide you over between trips out for the really good stuff.

Red Robin -- a Safeway Quality grocery store -- is 10-15 minutes walk to the southeast -- kind of a hike walking with grocery bags -- or a really short drive. The kitchen has all the basics, but as with the furnishings, these are Ikea level. Completely practical and good value and complete, but not stylish or inspiring to use.

Summary: super-glad we made this our home away from home for a week instead of whatever institutional hotel room I might have found for a similar price. This is a great home base. Enjoy Seattle!"
1817878,28610948,2015-03-27,16217103,Andrew,"Herberto's place was absolutely perfect for our stay in Seattle.  The place was extremely comfortable and had everything we needed during our trip, and was quite close to the bus stops that can take you closer to downtown.  Everything was clean with extra towels and blankets for us.  Overall it made our trip to the Pacific Northwest extremely enjoyable."
1817878,33098782,2015-05-25,8953267,Jeremy,"Heberto's place at the Central was incredible. I rented his place for myself and 5 others as we were in town for a music festival. We loved the condo as it had all the amenities we needed: laundry, netflix, clean bathrooms and bedrooms. Heberto was very active in responding to any issues/questions I had regarding the condo. The check in process was super smooth and everything about this stay was great. Thanks so much Heberto."
1817878,45277203,2015-09-01,39086969,Brandon,Very nice clean overall 9/10 good time

3803212,20144470,2014-09-24,6604137,Jessica,"Great space and location! The apartment was comfortable for three guests (four might be pushing it) and looked just like the photos. Minh was super friendly and always available to answer our questions, from the time we booked until our check out. I would definitely recommend his place to anyone visiting Seattle!"
384797,1336619,2012-05-23,1283398,Christine,"This place is adorable and perfectly located, and Chris was a gracious host. We had a lovely stay and will definitely be back!"
384797,1374241,2012-05-29,713940,Lei,"Nice neighbourhood, very clean house and room with large shared kitchen and living room area. "
384797,6814417,2013-08-26,2518131,Marcus,"Chris' place was perfect for our business trip and communication with him was easy. He made sure we had everything we needed and the accommodation was clean, comfortable and as described. Should we ever travel back to Seattle, we will definitely stay here again. Many thanks for everything!"
384797,8046442,2013-10-14,8422370,Leo,"We were a group of 8 guys that travel each year to a new location to re-unite, experience a new city and take in a college football game.  Chris' house was perfect for us.  It is located in a great area for nightlife, walking, coffee and everything we wanted. 

We took a short cab to the U district for the football game on Saturday but walked everywhere else: to Pike Place and the water and back from the house more than once no problem, to the bars and restaurants just around the block, sampled lots of unbelievable espresso within 2-3 blocks and made great use of the whole house including the kitchen with a grocery just 2 blocks away.  

The house was clean, secure and slept all 8 of us just fine with room to spare for at least 2 more.  A caretaker came by to check in and make sure everything was ok.  

Great experience - I'd recommend for any large group of people in town for a fun occasion or reunion.  

Chris was very prompt in communication, sent clear directions to the house, great recommendations about the neighborhood, etc.  "
384797,8786506,2013-11-18,8679522,Kevin,"Went for a bachelor party and had an amazing time.  We ran into Chris one of the nights and he was great!  He gave us tips on bars to go to (in addition to the list already provided in the house) and took some rather funny pictures with us and a coyote we brought home with us.

Would definitely recommend!"
384797,9159474,2013-12-10,2958163,Ben,"Perfect location, cozy clean house, and we enjoyed the hot tub a lot."
384797,9269265,2013-12-17,2689021,John,"Chris's house was the perfect spot to host my friends birthday celebration. Located near shops, restaurants, and nightlife. Everything we wanted to do in Seattle was only a few steps or a couple minutes drive from Chris's house! Couldn't ask for a more perfect location. We had a fairly large group of people and everyone had a bed to sleep on comfortably. Kitchen was fully stocked with all the cooking essentials: pots, pans, knives, forks, plates, cups, shot cups, wine glasses etc. The large table and open seating area was exactly what we needed to get the party started! Will def. book Chris's house again if we ever go back to Seattle!   "
384797,9952963,2014-01-21,6724811,Jessica,Chris was a wonderful host! He was very helpful and responded quickly to all my questions prior to check-in. His place was wonderful and perfect for a large group of people especially for a reunion. I would definitely recommend staying at another one of Chris' listings!
384797,10037894,2014-01-27,6778331,Edwin,"If you are travelling with a big group, you will be hard pressed to find a place as comfortable as this one. The location is convenient to nearby restaurants, bars, and yes, really great coffee. This is not downtown so be prepared to call a Lyft, Sidecar, or Taxi, all of which are very affordable in Seattle so it was never a problem for us. We had a small issue with the door code not working right but Chris was there in less than 10-minutes to help us out! If you are considering this place, you have no need to hesitate. "
384797,11048454,2014-03-18,11550920,Rachel,"My time in the house was amazing! I had 14 of my friends come out to Seattle to celebrate my 30th birthday and this house slept everyone of us comfortably. We had an incredible time and got out a lot, but the house was so amazing, had a hot tub and great seating areas outside that we ended up doing 'family' dinners and leaving the bars early so we could all hang out with each other. Chris was great and super responsive to all my questions both prior to arrival and while we were there...he was even very nice when we were a little noisy, very late, on the night of my 30th which unfortunately was on a Sunday. I would definitely rent from him again and will most certainly use AirBNB again when traveling with groups. Thank you again Chris for making my 30th so memorable! We didn't want to leave!"
384797,11744412,2014-04-14,12421594,Toby,House was in great shape. The group loved it. Chris was great at getting back to me. We had a problem with one of the bathrooms and before I could even report the issue somebody was there to fix it. We were there for a bachelor party and it was the perfect place.
384797,12325298,2014-04-29,9148787,Dan,"We booked this house for a group of co-workers attending a conference in Seattle. It was really the perfect situation for a large group such as ours: many bedrooms/beds, a large common space for relaxing, and located very close to bars and restaurants on Capitol Hill. It's a long walk and a short cab ride to the convention center, but through a really wonderful neighborhood.

Chris and his team were incredibly helpful hosts. They accommodated all of our requests with grace, and Chris even stopped by to check in on us and give us recommendations about the neighborhood.

Overall it was an excellent experience and I would absolutely book this house again."
384797,13947581,2014-06-09,5770818,Trevor,"Chris was a fantastic host. Exceptionally professional and polite. He responded quickly to all inquiries and was very flexible. The space is simply stunning, and the photos don't do it justice. Definitely allows for plenty of space for all occupants, and the hot tub is truly an amazing addition and is absolutely worth it. Would recommend this space to anyone who asked, and would definitely come back!"
384797,17921910,2014-08-19,10760869,Steve,"Personable Owners - available but not intrusive.  Good location for access to Capital Hill, Broadway and nice walk into the city.
Quiet neighborhood.
House has 5 usable bedrooms (2 King, 2 Queen and a twin bunk room) and a few hallway/public spaces locations, but only 2 bathrooms / showers which is tight with a full house.  Kitchen is well set up, outside area is fine, and ladies will love the well lit dressing rm/make up area.  We had a brief problem with hot water but this was quickly addressed, and the house seems well used which a lick of paint would solve."
384797,22027898,2014-10-28,2672927,Karl,"I hosted my Bachelor Party at this location with 12 guys and it was awesome.  The location was fantastic, as we could easily get around town on foot, and the house itself suited us well.  There were plenty of places to sleep as well as a large common area where we could all fit comfortably and hang out, eat, and drink.  The hot tub was real nice, though it gets SUPER hot real fast.  We had plenty of privacy and the place was in great shape when we got there."
384797,23598183,2014-12-06,4478059,Rhys,"Was a great experience. There are some great bars walking distance and the hot tub is brilliant. There were 8 of us there for a work event and everyone had a great time. The owners kept in touch and made sure everything was up to scratch - we were even able to cancel the parking spaces last minute.

Next time work calls us out we know where to go"
384797,26308688,2015-02-09,2077894,Grace,"Place is just as described and great for a large group looking to stay in a central location in Seattle.
Chris is also easy to reach in case you need anything. "
384797,28378944,2015-03-23,22897860,Sam,Amazing place. Everything we wanted and more. Perfect for a large group! Would definitely go back. 
384797,30759497,2015-04-27,26581588,G. A.,"The Pure Space house was a great place for my friends and I to have a long weekend.  It was clean, as advertised, and a pretty cool spot.  The house is in a good neighborhood and around a lot of good places to eat and sight see.  The host was very accommodating and made the process of booking to check out very easy.  Will definitely come back next time we drop by Seattle"
384797,32501313,2015-05-19,3687324,Steven,What a kitchen! We had a massive 5 course feast on Sunday night and the kitchen had all the tools necessary.  I'd definitely stay there again with a large group!
384797,45458374,2015-09-03,23492010,Lindsay,"This place was great!  The house was fully stocked with just about everything you could need.  The kitchen had all cooking utensils and plenty of dishes and silverware.  Each room had it's own fan which was great since it was very hot during our stay!  

The lower level hosted one bedroom, one bathroom,  a large powder room, the kitchen, the living room, and the hot tub.  Through the back, you could access the private back yard complete with outdoor furniture as well as a patio.  There was also a washer/dryer which came in super helpful for keeping clean towels on hand.

On the second level, you can find all of the other bedrooms (one with a sink) and another bathroom.  The second level was very quiet- you could not hear anything from the downstairs nor from the neighbors upstairs.

The neighborhood itself was also quiet even with the windows open all night, and super convenient!  Coffee everywhere!  We stayed for a week and could have picked a new coffee joint every day if we wanted.  The nearby street ""Broadway"" has just about every type of cuisine you could want.   There was also a grocery store (QFC) just two blocks away which was also very convenient.

Anything else, such as the Convention Center, The Space Needle or Pike's Place Market was just a 5-10 minute Uber ride away =)

10 out of 10, we would stay here again!"
7900497,46039815,2015-09-07,42417166,Molly,"My boyfriend and I were looking for a nice, quiet place to spend the weekend with easy access to downtown Seattle and this apartment was perfect! Kathryn was really nice and helpful and we had a wonderful time!"
5067177,42940507,2015-08-16,40147011,Julian,"The house felt just like your standard Ann Arbor building, so I felt right at home. Everything was clean, the instructions were clear, and everything went smoothly even though I never saw any of the hosts (which is fine). Having walked the town, now, I wouldn't mind the distance and staying at Crayola Home, their other property.

They are very kind in leaving food for guests in the fridge, including an Angry Orchard or two. It was just what I needed, late at night. Some instant Thai ramen was available that just about saved me after finally making it home from the bars at 3:00.

The neighborhood is a tiny San Francisco, which probably appeals more to some than to others.

I would happily stay here again, no matter the situation. Can't beat the price and the location."
5067177,43551695,2015-08-20,40555714,Edward," this is a very cute room.  clean and nice organized. and leah is very hospitality. offering us guests a very clean kitchen and living room. there are also some food and drink. nice to share with others. the area is very good.  its very quite at night. i do had some nice sleep. and its two blocks from broadway, u can find good restaurants very easily. over all i like this place. do recommend!"

5067177,47867292,2015-09-21,1830185,Mark,He greeted me immediately when I walked in and offered me food / beverages.  It was 11PM and I asked where I could take a walk to stretch after the long plane ride; he pointed out several great options. 
5067177,49007211,2015-09-30,37000227,James,"comfortable share house style accommodation in a beautiful leafy street. Leah was helpful and friendly, and even left Donuts for the guests! She was happy to talk me through the area and options for bars and restaurants. The other guests were fun and engaging. Would thoroughly recommend staying here if you are looking for affordable accommodation."
5067177,50681971,2015-10-13,44440422,Donald,"Leah could not have been more accommodating and friendly during my stay. She and Michael have definitely done well jn keeping their pad sparkling fresh and clean. Seriously, this place is decked out with all kinds of amenities, even my own personal french press and some of the best coffee beans I've ever known. 
Also, you can't beat a 7 minute bike ride down the hill to get to downtown / S Lake union area!"
5067177,51746951,2015-10-24,11258178,Gill,Great place to stay. 
5067177,54595694,2015-11-22,46020791,Jessie,"I stayed four weeks, and while sharing space was a bit of an adjustment for me it was a good experience.  Leah was very helpful and welcoming, and the location was very convenient to a market, restaurants, shopping, etc.  "
5067177,55834269,2015-12-06,47136956,Aurea,"Esta fue la primera vez que usé Airbnb y la verdad quedé muy contenta! La casa estaba muy bien ubicada, todo estaba muy limpio y gocé de mucha privacidad! El cuarto era muy pequeño pero más que suficiente para lo que necesitaba! La cama era súper confortable y el que junto con la llave hubiera una tarjeta del supermercado cercano me valió buenos descuentos cuando fui de compras! También fue muy agradable encontrar comida disponible en el refrigerador! "
5067177,57349230,2015-12-24,49348121,자연,It was comfortable

4464795,25578456,2015-01-19,19991153,Connie,Jared's place was great and had a nice view. I felt I had privacy even though I am a girl and the place was shared. The apartment was almost modern and clean. 
4464795,30482453,2015-04-22,24532543,Wei,"Jared and his girl friend are really nice! There was a problem with my hotel on that arrival day. I didn't contact him until the timing just before boarding. And his response is very in time. They wait for me till late night. Even though the room is living room, he give me the most privacy space and the room is clean. And location is really good. I am highly recommend you guys if you are gonna travel in Seattle to book here. You can use microwave which helps me a lot, etc. I would like to say this room even better than a hotel! "
4464795,32414599,2015-05-17,17177546,Tej,"Jared was great!  I had to place to myself, so there wasn't any issues with sharing.  I appreciated how flexible he was with check-in/check-out times.  He also gave some good recommendations on nearby restaurants and bars.  The neighborhood is great, and I'd highly recommend it."
4464795,36817889,2015-07-01,17565325,Ivan,"It was a pleasant experience staying at Jared's place :) The location was super convenient with great restaurants, bars, and coffee shops close by. Although the sleeping area was a shared space, I felt I still had my own privacy. Jared was really accommodating and flexible on the arrival/departure time. Also, he was really nice to make your stay as comfortable as possible. Overall with the price I paid, the hospitality from Jared, and the quality of the place, it is definitely worth for your stay. I highly recommend!

Her place has plenty of parking, and is in a great location for both going downtown, or into the university area. She helped me navigate around town, and provided a very clean place. Would definitely recommend her to anyone staying in Seattle. "
5201816,36852128,2015-07-02,26922174,Betty,"Absolutely fabulous place. Marty a very conscientious about emailing and answering requests.

2995996,15454931,2014-07-09,15876379,David,"Ron was a most welcoming and caring host for us during our stay at the Green House.  We were in the main and second floor space and the accommodations were spacious and very comfortable for the four of us.  The kitchen was fully equipped.  Ron was available at any time by phone though we never needed to call him because he had already provided everything we needed.
The neighborhood retail center is literally two blocks away with restaurants and a convenience store.  Two bus routes stop there - one to downtown the other to Seattle Center, i.e. the space needle.  Groceries are only six blocks away, but it is up a long hill, so we would recommend the bus.
"
2995996,15690117,2014-07-14,3201541,Ann,"The Green House on the Corner was perfect for us! Check-in and check-out were really easy, Ron was a great communicator, and the place was very spacious and clean. In the kitchen, everything we possibly could have needed was there for us (of course, with all the amazing restaurants within a few blocks, we didn't really take advantage of the kitchen as much as we could have). Location was ideal - again, several great restaurants nearby and close to a bus line. Ron was extremely kind, checking in on us to make sure we had everything we needed and he even gave us a couple of raspberry plants as we were checking out! All-in-all, a great value and we'd highly recommend it to anyone going to visit Seattle!"
2995996,15939706,2014-07-18,17986536,Amir,"The Green House is great! It was clean and well furnished. It takes 15 minutes to reach downtown, and had great bakeries and restaurants nearby. Very recommended."
2995996,16082155,2014-07-22,591450,Darin 'N Sierra,"Ron is a great host.  He was responsive, easy to communicate with through text. His home was better than expected and I expected it to be nice but it was actually a lot nicer :-))) we were very pleased, overall an excellent experience.  We would definitely stay there again. "
2995996,16374852,2014-07-26,18230039,Christine,Das Haus ist wie auf den Bildern abgebildet. Gute Wohngegend mit mehreren Restaurants in unmittelbaren Umgebung. Eine Buslinie ins Zentrum ist eine Straßenecke entfernt. Der Vermieter John ist sehr nett.
2995996,17272272,2014-08-10,862835,Colleen,"Ron is a great host and very communicative! He got back to me immediately with every question! The house is charming and was perfect for us and our 2 older teenagers. We stayed 2 weeks and it is located in the Madison Valley area which is very beautiful and close to Madison Beach and lots of restaurants and shopping within walking distance! I also highly recommend for the ladies, the nails salon on Madison, and the AFH Hair Salon around the corner. We had a car, but there are buses close by to take you downtown and all over Seattle. But Seattle is hilly, so walking can sometimes be a challenge!
Ron's Green House on the Corner was perfect for us!"
2995996,18473206,2014-08-27,2133040,Emily,"We booked the Green House for our relatives visiting from Italy - they loved it so much they didn't want to leave! It was really comfortable, spacious, had everything they needed, and it's located in one of Seattle's most beautiful neighborhoods, very close to a several convenient bus routes. Ron was a pleasure to work with, and we'll definitely recommend this property to friends and family! "
2995996,18875901,2014-09-02,4811665,Aaron,"Just got home from staying at Ron's house and I am very happy with our experience. We were a party of six and we were able to find space to call our own in this home. The house is really in a great location, and the bus lines that service the area make getting anywhere downtown very easy. We visited the Safeway up the hill, as well as the Trader Joes, so we had access to wonderful food shopping. The house is in a pretty quiet part of town, which I had not expected, so that was very pleasant. Ron contacted me both before and during our stay, just to make sure that we had all that we needed and to answer questions. Overall I felt like I was staying at a family members home who was out of town, but said I could use their place. I would gladly stay there again."
2995996,19109641,2014-09-06,17657505,David,"The green house ticked the boxes for our stay in Seattle. Neat and clean, easy parking, convenient location and a walk to local restraunts & cafes.

Ron was super responsive to our request and to a late evening need during the stay. Thanks Gents!

Although we didn't need it during our stay, the Public Transport options would be easy and convenient from the Green House.

Our recommendation is to walk up the street and have dinner at Bar Cantinetta.  Very friendly team doing good food. Share your way through the small menu a few dishes at a time."
2995996,19276981,2014-09-09,12403246,Tim,"This was my second experience with Airbnb, and Ron made the experience very smooth and easy. Very cute house, in a great location. "
2995996,19634295,2014-09-15,14278656,John,My wife and I stayed with 2 other couples and there was plenty of room for all 6 of us. The house was clean and in a lovely location.  Ron was always prompt when responding to any queries that we had during our stay. We couldn't have asked for a better place or weekend. We would definitely stay here again.  Thank you Ron for a great stay.
2995996,19897843,2014-09-20,20854302,Frances,"Ron was very responsive to my questions during the booking and reservation process.  He gave very sufficient details and instructions that made our stay easy.  The house was clean and ready for us.
This house was in a fantastic location for our trip.  We were close to everyplace we needed to go and the neighborhood is very quaint.
We had 4 adults and a tween staying and there was plenty of room.  The kitchen is fully stocked which made cooking easy and fun.  
When we return to Seattle, we hope to book this home again.  Thanks Ron."
2995996,20158432,2014-09-24,17966129,Adam,"Ron was extremely responsive to any inquiry prior to our arrival and checked in on us after we arrived. Check in was a breeze, keypad entry so no need for keys. The house was in a safe and quiet neighborhood with easy parking right out front. If you are a foodie there are some pretty good restaurants within walking distance and also a Safeway a very short drive away. Very close to public transportation as well. $12 uber ride to century link field.

This house would be great if you plan to explore the city and spend a lot of time out and about. Its not so great if you plan to have a bunch of downtime. We visit Seattle often and this time didn't want to spend one of our days running around town. The lack of cable TV and no TV at all in the common area made for a very dull day with minimal in home entertainment. We also felt, for the price, the furnishings could be a little more updated. The towels were small and very thin, kitchen was dated, weird brown stain on my comforter, etc. Bottom line is: this space would be a great space if you are in town to explore the city and food scene. It was not the right space for us this time."
2995996,20441513,2014-09-29,4041589,Amelia,"Ron's house was lovely to stay at, it was very spacious and in a great location. It was very easy communicating with Ron and I would definitely stay there again in the future. "
2995996,21676825,2014-10-21,7000038,Randy,"Ron's place is FANTASTIC!  It was ready for us on the evening of check-in, and Ron was a perfect host.  Even down to the homegrown arugula he offered us from his garden!  The house was clean and spacious, and was absolutely just right for me, my wife and 2 daughters.  Ron was also great with tips about things to do in the neighborhood, and we were pleasantly surprised to find out it was just a short walk to the sprawling arboretum!  Thanks again, Ron!"
2995996,22225288,2014-11-02,16401384,Karla,"We enjoyed our stay at the Green House in Madison. It was very comfortable, clean, and conveniently located. Plus, our host Ron was a delight to communicate with. Very quick to reply and helpful. Highly recommend this place."
2995996,22768416,2014-11-14,2050686,Chris,"We really enjoyed staying at the Green House.  Ron was very attentive before, during and after in making sure we had everything we needed and the house was in good order.  We actually ended up arriving much later than planned (9pm instead of 1pm) and even in the dark the house was easy to locate (it is indeed green!).  The house was spacious, clean, and comfortable.  Perfect for our short trip to Seattle."
2995996,23523656,2014-12-03,6500226,Joshua,"Overall this was a good experience for my family.  The house was pretty comfortable.  The master suite upstairs was very nice, but the two bedrooms downstairs felt cramped.  It was easy to prepare a number of things for our Thanksgiving dinner in the spacious kitchen.

The house was moderately clean when we arrived - just like a normal house!  Ron was responsive and came by quickly to fix a drain that was clogged.  The electronic keypad entry was very convenient.

Overall this is a nice place to stay and a good value."
2995996,24087126,2014-12-19,24056376,Dhruv,"Ron was extremely considerate and caring. The house was fantastic, Ron occasionally stopped by to restock supplies and was available via phone if needed. 

The house was really close to almost everything I wanted to do in Seattle and there was ample parking around the house.

Would highly recommend staying here if you are visiting Seattle."
2995996,25639787,2015-01-21,5837799,Cerina,"The Green House was a great place to stay. It was super clean, super cozy, and super close to a bunch of cool things in Seattle. Ron went out of his way to make us feel at home, and I highly recommend this home for anyone who is travelling to Seattle."
2995996,26242148,2015-02-08,624825,Susan,All went smoothly and we enjoyed our stay at the green house. The host was great in reaching out before hand and checking in when we arrived. He let us know the information we needed on arrival. This listing was accurate.
2995996,42507999,2015-08-14,1709283,Barbara,Ron is very communicative and accommodating.  We loved his house - the location is terrific (but hilly!) and it was spacious for our family of 4.  Overall very positive experience and I highly recommend his place!
2995996,43123201,2015-08-17,21686521,Edson,"It was an awesome first Airbnb experience! Thank you Ron for being an amazing host!  Next time I visit Seattle, I will definitely stay there again or in the lower apartment.  The house was clean, in perfect location, great view and very cozy.  Felt like home for the 3 days we were there. Hope Ron was as happy with us as we were with him."
2995996,44370671,2015-08-25,41433171,Melissa,We really enjoyed our stay at the greenhouse.  The neighborhood was quiet but still just a short drive to downtown.  The greenhouse had plenty of space for our family.   There were also some great restaurants walking distance. We would definitely stay again in the future.
2995996,45486906,2015-09-03,8901468,Anthony,The house was perfect for us. And the neighborhood was lovely and walkable. Ron was super easy to work with. Highly recommended. 
2995996,46292512,2015-09-09,1176864,Germana,"Il soggiorno alla Green House di Ron e'stato perfetto in tutti gli aspetti: 
dalle informazioni antecedenti il nostro arrivo, all'accoglienza a casa.
La casa era provvista di tutto cio' che si puo' immaginare essere necessario, tutte le attrezzature e la biancheria e gli elettrodomestici funzionanti e in ottime (website hidden) siamo trovati davvero a nostro agio e oramai che abbiamo una certa esperienza di Airbnb, posso dire che non sempre e'stato cosi.
La casa e'ben arredata ( le foto sono molto fedeli) e ha spazi comodi sia in soggiorno che nelle camere che in giardino.Ron si e'sempre dimostrato premuroso e gentile: raccomando vivamente la Green House!"
2995996,47067380,2015-09-15,19659239,Erin,Ron was fantastic! He was great about texting to check in and making sure we had everything we needed. The location was perfect. We enjoyed being able to walk down the street for a cup of coffee in the morning and returning to enjoy it on the front porch!
1594219,7779133,2013-10-02,1785600,Dennis,"Trishann was an amazing host. Bathroom was huge and room is incredibly private. Free access to use the kitchen, washer, and dryer. She went out of her way to make sure that I felt welcome in Seattle. I would definitely recommend Trishann to any friends who visit the area."
1594219,8007984,2013-10-12,7360823,Taleen,Trishann was amazing!!! She was super awesome about check in && check out times!!!! She was super sweet and very welcoming into her home!!! The place was amazing and very spacious!!!! Plus the bus stops were extremely close!!! I had a great stay at Trishann's!!!
1594219,11660142,2014-04-11,6097839,Anu,"We have stayed here five times over the past four months. We have been very impressed with Trishann. She has been very flexible with our scheduling needs, manages her home well, and keeps the rooms very clean. The parking is available in plenty on the side streets and the neighborhood is safe and decent. The area is very accessible and has good driving access to various shopping places, stores and restaurants. The area is not too busy and we recommend this place for your airbnb needs if you visit Seattle for any length of time."
1594219,14168240,2014-06-13,16193465,Candance,"My stay with Trishann was wonderful! This was my solo trip to Seattle (actually to anywhere by myself) and my first time using Airbnb. Trishann made sure I was comfortable at all times... Alone in a new place, of course I had qualms! Trishann was present for entertaining, but not so much that it overwhelming (I'm not always a morning person...or people person). Questions about public transportation, sights, even weather? Trish was available, in person or via cell/text. And she made me feel like I was at home, rather than on vacation, which meant a lot to me. It was nice to come ""home"", kick off your shoes, and tell someone about your day, grab a snack (from your own shelf in the fridge!), and head upstairs to a cozy, comfortable room and relax. Just what I needed. Just a 3-day stay to get away, but I was able to check in/out when I needed and come and go as I pleased. I will definitely stay with Trish again when come back to Seattle. Thank you for the lovely stay! "
1594219,14406282,2014-06-18,3290055,Rodney,"We had a wonderful time at Trish’s house and would happily stay here 
again. Trish was a great host. Our daughter felt so at home and said that 
this was her favourite place she stayed during our holiday. There was ample 
parking just around the corner and it was very convenient for us to get 
downtown and see the tourist sites. We would love to stay here again."
1594219,15356592,2014-07-07,4284290,Ophira,"Trishann is a fantastic host! She communicates extremely well and is very accommodating - we arrived to her place late in the evening and it was not a problem. Her townhome is beautiful. The room is set up like a hotel room when you arrive, with the bright window pictured, all the sheets and towels you need, and sparse but well-appointed decorations. The bathroom you share with guests in the other room is very large and comfortable, and we were lucky enough to have open and warm people staying in the other room when we were there.

The main floor of the house (where we watched a game of the World Cup and a movie with Trish) is also open to you. There's plenty of room in the fridge for your things and the kitchen is very well-equipped. Breakfast options included eggs, cereal, and nut milks, along with coffee (this is Seattle!) and tea. There are several grocery stores a short distance from her place.

There are buses right on her street that straight toward what were our destinations of interest: Fremont, Green Lake, downtown... We had been hoping to stay somewhere more central, but everywhere appealing to us seemed booked on the 4th of July weekend. Despite the crazy foot traffic and the slight distance, it was logistically very easy to get back to Trish's place the night of the 4th of July after seeing the fireworks at Gasworks Park.

Trish herself is a very interesting person with a wide range of life experiences, in terms of where she's lived, what she's studied, what sorts of projects she does for work. She's a great conversationalist.

Highly recommended."
1594219,15720636,2014-07-14,17576418,Darius,"Trisha was perfectly accommodating. Even though I arrived very late (around midnight), she was there at the door and greeted me with a smile which I know wasn’t necessary ;)

The room is clean, new feeling, and the bed is comfortable and fresh. There was enough room to lay several suitcases and spread out clothes.

The area is super close to two bus lines that lead directly into downtown Seattle, about 30 minutes away on the bus. That helped a lot. 

The desk fan in the room definitely helped with the oddly warmer days in Seattle recently, so the temperature in the room (being not he top floor) was only a little above ideal. Overall, a good choice."
1594219,16216440,2014-07-23,1825553,Amanda,"This was our first Airbnb experience and it was great!! Trishann was a fantastic host and made us feel very welcome in her home.  She was very easy to talk to, fun and personable. She was also very responsive in her communication, the place was just as advertised and the bed was super comfy!! I had asked her about street parking when we had inquired about staying at her place and she said there is always parking nearby and she was right. It was always super easy to find a spot close to her place. The room also has really great closet space, it was nice not to have to live out of a suitcase for a week. We would definitely come back here if we are ever in Seattle again! "
1594219,16369837,2014-07-26,4520895,Jennifer,"Thank you for a nice and clean place for us. Trishann was greeting us nicely. My sister and I stayed at Trishann's house for 3 nights . The bed is comfortable. It is also a convenient location, close to Safeway supermarket and Walgreen.  I will recommend it to my friends or families staying in Seattle, thank you Trishann !
"
1594219,16579950,2014-07-29,1806233,Karrie,"Trish was an awesome host! She is caring and accommodating. I was very impressed with how quickly she responded our questions from booking the trip to the end of our stay. The pictures and descriptions on the posting are very accurate! Her townhouse was very well kept. The bathroom and bedroom were clean (the shared bathroom was super spacious, love it!). She gave us plenty of towels. Even though there was no AC, the little fan in the room was powerful enough to keep the bedroom cool during summertime. The neighborhood was quiet and safe. We rented a car but had no problem finding free street parking. The location was also relatively close to all the neighborhoods we wanted to visit (Fremont, Capitol Hill, Downtown, etc.). Thank you, Trish, for having us! :)"
1594219,19933879,2014-09-21,18829429,Bryce,"My friend and I stayed with Trish after moving to Seattle and did not have a place to stay while we transitioned into an apartment. Trish was very friendly, had a wonderful home, and made us feel welcome. There is a bus stop right outside her place which was extremely helpful for getting downtown. We were able to meet other travelers who were staying in her second guest room and even made friends with a couple from Germany!"
1594219,20585113,2014-10-01,21690873,Seth,"Trishann made us feel very comfortable and welcome.  She was totally accommodating and helpful in every way.  Her house is beautiful and comfortable and I highly recommend her as a host.

"
1594219,21433869,2014-10-17,9838235,Ryan,"Excellent two weeks stayed at Trish’s beautiful home. She has created such a tasteful environment to stay while in Seattle and was a very supportive host. Was able to offer us the space to cook dinner each night, relax in the home, provide clean sheets, and suggest resources for around Seattle. She is clearly a Super Host for a reason. She really provided exactly what we needed during our first two weeks in Seattle. It was also lovely chatting with her and watching our first Seahawks game with her and another guest at a local Greenwood pub. Thanks for such a great stay Trish, we really appreciate it!"
1594219,22196942,2014-11-01,21987799,Stiliyan,"We really enjoyed our stay with Trishann. We have to thank her for being a great host and helping our navigate through the city. The location was walking distance from 'Bitter Lake' park, bus stop to Downtown and many stores. She is easy going and always available for questions. Room was very cosily with interesting interior. Thank you for all."
1594219,22797801,2014-11-15,22332944,Jessica,"Trishann is a lovely and thoughtful hostess who made our first Airbnb experience a real delight. The place was great: clean, welcoming, convenient, and we greatly appreciated her hypo-allergenic sheet and towel laundering practices. I would gladly recommend Trishann's place to other travelers, and we plan to return the next time we are in Seattle. "
1594219,26159919,2015-02-05,26082796,Sarah,Having just arrived to Seattle for the first time Trishann made my transition to the city easy and comfortable and the place was extremely welcoming and clean. She provided everything that I needed and really helped me out in navigating the city and showing me around. I would definitely recommend this place thanks for everything! :)
1594219,27458755,2015-03-05,23449166,Rakan,"Trishann was great host, friendly ,very supportive, and really easy to communicate with , the area of the house is amazing and quite, the room is exactly like the picture very clean and comfort, in conclusion it was amazing stay."
1594219,34273781,2015-06-07,21521860,Hannah,Very accommodating. Pleasure to be around. Helpful!
1594219,44470637,2015-08-26,39822534,Soledad,"My parents stayed at Trishanne's place and they loved it! The place was clean, organized and easy to stay at! Thank you Trishanne! "
1594219,45187302,2015-08-31,29973700,Peihao,"Trishann is a awesome host. And the room very clean and cozy, exact same as picture. And her house is super close to the bus stop which is a huge plus to me! "
1594219,48397679,2015-09-26,36669394,Robert,"I had a great time at Trishann's place. I think her place provided a ""home"" type atmosphere which I think was well needed in a time where I spent a month away from home. The place is well kept and clean, and I find the free laundry a nice bonus! Trishann is also helpful and willing to answer any questions you have. "
8104742,57593731,2015-12-27,51616246,Mimi,"Ted was great at communicating with me even throughout my stay. The home is very clean and close to everything.  Loved the modern look, would definitely recommend!"
8104742,58393213,2016-01-02,2407180,Ronnie,"I had a wonderful experience in Ted's home. The house was beautiful, loved the interior and how modern everything was. Ted himself was an awesome host. He helped accommodate to certain circumstances and made sure we had everything we needed! I would definitely recommend staying in this beautiful home if you have the chance."
2686374,11770030,2014-04-14,9836905,Anna Marie,Chris was such a great host! He left the place clean and stocked with lots of nice treats.  Plus he was incredibly responsive to all questions and was always ready with extra advice to make things easy. The place itself is crazy cute with lots of room for everyone. It was a nice surprise to be within wlking distance from so many great shops too. Loved this house completely!
2686374,11849304,2014-04-16,4160015,Reiko,"This 1920's remodeled home was comfortable, adorable and full of character!  We didn't get a chance to sleep in the airstream. :( My 2 friends and I were literally just staying there for 7 hours of shut eye.  Chris was quick to respond to all my questions and was very helpful.  Ballard is such a cute and vibrant town.  The home is on a beautiful residential street.  Our GPS got a little confused finding the home, but that's technology for you. We felt safe and comfortable. To paraphrase: we'll be back. "
2686374,11875925,2014-04-17,1165991,Cyra,Great place.  Loved staying in the airstream. 
2686374,11944164,2014-04-19,5292084,Michael,"An awesome place to stay in Seattle and a true Air BnB experience! Chris's house and airstream are full of character, nice and clean, and there's a full kitchen and comfy beds. Chris was really helpful and super friendly. The area is great - loads of good coffee and groceries, and a real west coast vibe. We thoroughly recommend a stay!"
2686374,12565380,2014-05-05,14209789,Diana,"We stayed three delightful nights. We found a private parking space, a modern well-stocked kitchen (with a big bowl full of treats--thank you!), a cozy living/dining area, excellent beds in the bedrooms, and a full bath with an actual TUB.  Another unexpected plus was the washer/dryer, complete with supplies.  The Ballard neighborhood is eclectic, close to lots of interesting shops and sites.  This house is also only two blocks from a city bus line that goes to downtown Seattle. The WiFi worked fine.
The main apartment is a second floor walk-up in an older home with lots of character. One of the bedrooms is a converted attic space with skylights.  Our last night we had rain on the roof--what a wonderful way to sleep!  We did not use the Airstream, but it looked really cool in there."
2686374,12636311,2014-05-06,14209244,Micah,We had a great stay at this beautiful home! Chris was quick with responding to any questions I had and a pleasure to meet.
2686374,12695356,2014-05-08,13750447,Misi,Amazing time at Chris's home. Love the house and old school it felt. Would love to come back!!! Aloha 
2686374,12763157,2014-05-10,8586712,Linda,It was great. Chris was very responsive and the place worked perfect for our one night stay.
2686374,12842875,2014-05-12,3150575,Juliette,"Fantastic experience. Chris was insanely helpful and everything went exactly as expected. The house is quite old and has some quirks but every single detail has been attended to, the location is outstanding, and the price is perfectly reasonable. Chris has stocked the house with new, fluffy towels - new sheets and everything is perfectly comfortable. I'd stay there again without any hesitation. "
2686374,12901593,2014-05-13,14771232,Gina,"Chris was such an amazing host. I could not be more pleased with our stay.  He provided immediate communication and answered all of our questions fully and detailed so when we walked into the home it was with ease. The home itself is hands down the best airbnb my friends and I have stayed in - Spotless clean, organized, fully stocked, comfortable beds, wonderful decor with fresh cut flowers and everything was labeled for our convenience. Chris had thought up of everything we would ever need for our stay and had it ready for us - even dog poop bags he provided for us! The home has wonderful large windows/skylights which provides a ton of light during the day and creates such a relaxing atmosphere. The loft is a lot of fun and very spacious and comfortable. The shower had great water pressure even better than my own home. Unfortunately, none of our party stayed in the Airstream but we peaked inside and it was awesome, has a heater hook up if needed as well! Wi-Fi was super fast and had great reception. The best part is he left us homemade cookies. You can tell he really prides himself on providing the best service and taking care of his home. I just have to say that Chris went above and beyond our expectations and we wanted to extend our trip because of this listing. Thank you Chris and your family!

 "
2686374,12958215,2014-05-15,2834622,Skye,LOVED staying here! Can't wait to come back. Thank you so much :)
2686374,18166258,2014-08-23,15319651,Pam,Apartment was as listed. Slept all 6 of us comfortably. Within walking distance to about anything you would need.
2686374,18399341,2014-08-26,73119,Emily & Matt,"We had a great stay at Chris' place! The house is spacious, clean and light-filled, and centrally located in Ballard. We were in town for a friend's wedding and it was the ideal home base -- close to the wedding reception venue and to many restaurants and cafés in Ballard. (Our favourite of which was hands down Café Besalu -- amazing croissants and pastries!)

My husband and I had fun staying in the airstream, which despite the unusually hot weather stayed nice and cool in the evening. There was even a space heater in case it got too cold, but we didn't end up needing it. Our only comment is that it was slightly less private than we'd anticipated. There weren't any curtains in the airstream and the backyard faces onto a visible alleyway, which is only separated by a low picket fence. This wasn't a big deal for us since we were two people and the neighbourhood felt safe and quiet, but just thought we'd mention it.

We were five friends and would definitely recommend staying at Chris' if you're a larger group. As the listing describes, there is only one bathroom, but Chris was very gracious and let us use the downstairs bathroom too, as the unit was unoccupied at the time.

Chris was very communicative and friendly, and we wouldn't hesitate to recommend staying at his lovely home in Ballard!"
2686374,18530497,2014-08-28,16711721,Heather,"Loved this beautiful house in such a wonderful neighborhood! It was clean, comfy, and roomy, plus it had everything my family needed along with thoughtful little extras from coffee and snacks to toiletries. Soft, fluffy beds, a fun loft, and the Airstream trailer was more than enough room for my family of five. The central location was clean, safe, and perfect for having fun in Seattle and the whole family loved exploring Ballard. I don't think I could have found two nicer hosts. I plan to stay there every time I need to be in Seattle!"
2686374,18648636,2014-08-30,13360928,Ted,"Great little house in a great little neighborhood (Ballard).  Tons of room for several people.  We didn't even use the airstream for the three of us.  Chris was really friendly and accommodating.  Only difficulty was that there was only one bathroom.  Overall, a happy experience."
2686374,18720879,2014-08-31,3656157,Precious,"We had a fun time staying at this house - it was great for a family. There was enough stuff in the kitchen for me to make coffee and pancakes for breakfast, and each of us got our own sleeping space - bedroom, loft, and living room. The one bathroom was off the bedroom but since we are family that didn't bother me. Unfortunately we chickened out of sleeping in the Airstream- that would have been really cool! Chris was really nice and even offered to set up a pack and play for our son, which we didn't end up needing since we brought our own travel bed. "
2686374,18873158,2014-09-02,12025683,Lyn,"This was my first experience using airbnb and it was great. We were really happy with the space and appreciated all the extra touches (such as fresh baked cookies, water and soda in the fridge) that Chris provided. The location was super convenient - you are just a couple of blocks from transit to downtown and you can also walk to a lot of restaurants and bars in Ballard.

2686374,19015330,2014-09-04,13356644,Joel,The home and hosts were incredible!  From the minute we walked in to the minute we left it felt like home. The small touches like snacks and coffee were great. The beds were amazingly soft and clean and we would have stayed for a week if we could have! Thank you Chris!
2686374,19352271,2014-09-10,8736108,Ali,"We arrived quite late so it was a bit dark but using the flashlight app on the iPhone, we were able to punch the code in to gain access into the home. The interior of the home was similar to that of the airbnb site. However, the airstream looked different late at night and we chose to stay in the home."
2686374,19721294,2014-09-17,11480173,Charles,We emailed and had a friendly chat in person.
2686374,19932313,2014-09-21,17126192,Lindsay,"We had an awesome stay!! We were a little worried about the stairs with our young daughter but there was a door that could be shut and locked which was helpful!! Chris was great to work with from the beginning, he even brought in a co sleeper for my daughter which was very thoughtful. The house is nice and had everything we needed. We would definitely come back if we're ever in the area again. Thanks again!"
2686374,20253036,2014-09-26,1922700,Liza,"Chris was super sweet and really helped us settle in. He gave us lots of advice about the neighborhood, and was always around or available if we had questions. My husband, my dog and I were moving to Seattle and in the process of renting a place so it was a really nice welcoming place to land out the door. Would rent it again in a heart beat. "
2686374,20408324,2014-09-29,1115231,Linda,My husband and daughter traveled to Ballard for my nieces wedding. We came across this property and were interested because of the separate area outside with the airstream. My daughter and boyfriend stayed out there. Which gave us all more room and privacy. Chris our host was very accommodating and went out of his way to make our stay comfortable. We suggested he put in a full length mirror in. He went and bought one and had it for us when returned at the end of the day. The house was located to everything we needed. We really loved the area! Lots of restaurants and shopping close by. Took advantage of the Market a few blocks away on Sunday. It is also located just 10 min. by car to the Pike Place Market and Downtown. We will defiantly stay at Chris's house again when we return to Seattle. 
2686374,20673662,2014-10-03,21276736,Matt,"Although I never had the pleasure of meeting Chris, he went above and beyond to make sure we felt welcome even before we left for our trip to Seattle.  He stocked the house with snacks and bottled water and even baked cookies for us!  His house was lovely and in a beautiful neighborhood. I highly recommend staying at this beautiful home on your next trip to the Seattle area.  Thanks for a wonderful stay, Chris! "
2686374,20821444,2014-10-06,6626393,Janet,"The host was very laid-back, which helped us to feel relaxed.  The yard, dog door, dog bed, food and water bowls worked great for our dog.  The neighborhood was very quiet and peaceful, yet an easy walk to restaurants (highly recommend Kim Chee House on 24th), and to shopping.  The warm cookies were a nice touch, and we also appreciated the coffee, microwave, creamer, sugar, tea, bottled water, shampoo, etc.  There were a lot of nice extras in case we forgot anything.  The key code worked flawlessly.  No one else was staying in the building at the time, so it was quiet and private."
2686374,20978972,2014-10-08,13391525,Cindy,"Chris is terrific! He makes sure the place is neat and tidy before guests come and even left us some freshly baked cookies. You can imagine how happy we were when we checked in.

The place is just as the photos looked. I got really good vibes being in there. All the beds were extremely comfortable, and I love the fully stocked kitchen and bathroom. It really felt like being home away from home.

The location was great too, just several blocks away from Market street. All in all, I had a great experience staying here."
2686374,21054322,2014-10-10,21749957,Nick,Far away enough from downtown Seattle to where you're away from the madness and in the middle of a amazing neighborhood surrounded by water and boats and beauty. The house was immaculate and personal and the hosts even made us cookies and had all the amenities we could ever need! The airstream in the back was adorable and everything was awesome. Wished we could've met them but unfortunately we only stayed in Seattle one night. I would definitely recommend this place and would definitely stay here again in a heartbeat!
2686374,21346400,2014-10-15,1817076,Lois,"Great host, friendly neighbourhood - had an amazing time. Really cute apartment, loved the trailer!"
2686374,21571956,2014-10-19,6276041,Daniel,"Chris was supremely friendly and considerate as a host, very easy to get hold of and went the extra mile to make sure we had everything we needed. The place is a comfortable and quirky combination of house and airstream trailer, which rests in the backyard. Both were great. Would definitely stay here again. Thanks Chris! "
2686374,21863597,2014-10-25,22774238,J Roddy,Great place. Awesome host. We walked to Ballard in less than 5 mins. Super clean and funky. Great place for groups or bands. Easy check in great experience all together!
2686374,21944005,2014-10-27,3404932,Allison,Great place! It has a great old character feel with everything you need.  The location was great.  We could walk everywhere we wanted as Ballard is a great place to check out good food and great beer.  Chris was amazing and contacting me quickly and even sent updates the day off and even the day we left.  There was lots of space and the fenced back yard was great for our dogs.  Will definitely go back there! Thanks Chris!
2686374,22293653,2014-11-03,4731793,Kendall,Chris was great at keeping us posted on when the place would be available and had cookies ready for when we arrived. He left lights on and notes around the house made it easy to know where things were. Easy access to Market St and Ballard farmers market. 
2686374,22421901,2014-11-05,23207737,Jason,"Chris was a great host. We arrived to cookies on the stove and fresh flowers over the sink. All of his instructions were well thought out and easy to understand. The place was nice and cozy, unfortunately we were only there for one night so we didn't have much time to enjoy it. "
2686374,22700431,2014-11-12,6044153,Dayna Ken And Kaya,Chris was very nice when I spoke to him on the phone. Although we never saw him while we were at the property. The property is laid out a little odd. although we were warned in reviews ahead of time. The airstream is quite cold in the winter while the sleeping loft is very hot in the winter because all the heat rises to the top obviously. The location in Ballard is fantastic and we really enjoyed the neighborhood.
2686374,23369133,2014-11-30,22259112,Philip,We love Ballard and being in a central location was the icing on our trip! Chris is a great host. The space our family stayed in was clean and comfortable and everything functioned as it was supposed to. Chris communicated easily with us and even extended a generous Thanksgiving dinner invite.
2686374,23483939,2014-12-01,16048684,Alvin,The place was exactly the same as described. the place is about 20 minutes drive from downtown and the neighbourhood is safe. It's comfortable and I enjoyed my one night stay at his place. I wish I had more time at this apartment! Chris is such a nice man to talk to and will definitely recommend this place to all the people out there. 
2686374,23550056,2014-12-04,2249788,Wayne,We arrived prematurely and unloaded our things. When we returned the unit was delightful. Unfortunately the LOX & shrimp and bacon pie we brought where associated with the previous tenant. There we some problems associated with the bathroom shower so we left early the next day without bathing. We loved the personal freedom offered by Chris who is a great guy.
2686374,23723828,2014-12-08,9544461,Randy,"Chris's place in Ballard was perfect. Close to everything, clean, cozy and comfortable. He even left us some cookies. Will definitely stay again on our next trip to Ballard."
2686374,23939477,2014-12-15,1227867,Noel,"The place was exactly as pictured.  Nice, i liked it.  I was only there for one day and it was just me, so i didn't use the loft or the airstream.  I would definitely stay there again.

Didn't cross paths with Chris, but he was responsive and polite when we did interact.  He sent the combo for the door and I could simply let myself in and out.  Overall great experience."
2686374,24058465,2014-12-18,1783111,Celeste,We enjoyed our stay at Chris's place. He had everything we needed. Only wish we could have stayed longer. 
2686374,24529326,2014-12-30,1841192,Bootsy,Well first is that Ballard is a great area to stay with so much great food. The house is older and a duplex with stairs. The place has all you need and Chris was super great to rent from. We came at Christmas and he had a tree for us and teddy bear for my son and chocolates for us. So nice. Plus it's easy to park. 
2686374,24628791,2014-12-31,15980066,Beth,"Enjoyed one night at the flat; great location for walking to Ballard shops and restaurants.  La Isla for great Puerto Rican dinner, Cafe Besalou for amazing pastries (closed Tues) or Fresh Flours for breakfast. Didn't get around to using spacious kitchen but appreciated large windows & light throughout.  Chris was welcoming and responsive--a fine experience."
2686374,24824087,2015-01-03,22730722,Brian,"Staying at the Ballard house was great! The home itself was one of the highlights of our trip. We weren't able to meet the hosts, but they made sure we were comfortable with every amenity we would need, including snacks, drinks, and toiletries. The home was clean and in a great location—we are looking to move to Seattle and because of this experience are now looking in Ballard. The only downside is there is a lot of sleeping space but only one bathroom, which is attached to a bedroom. If you're going with a group, be aware of that. Other than that, the hosts and home were both perfect. "
2686374,25330118,2015-01-12,4355018,Grace,Chris was an excellent host. He was always available! Thank you Chris for hosting all 6 of us :) the place was warm and cozy. We all loved it :)
2686374,25376705,2015-01-13,14145985,Sean,"One of the best hosts who I never got to meet. There were everything you could possibly imagine, from towels to even razor blades. 
The place was clean and cozy. The host was very communicative, polite and hospitable. 
I would absolutely recommend this place."
2686374,25487708,2015-01-17,4865407,Paul,"Great communication with Chris! He was incredibly responsive and the unit was exactly as described. We didn't get to utilize the Airstream but the next time we stay we will for sure. The little things like beverages, snacks and chocolates awaiting our arrival made this a very pleasant stay. "
2686374,25614001,2015-01-20,179481,Enrico,"The location of the flat is great and I was very glad that I could cook for my boys. We enjoyed the staying.
The only thing was that 2 of the boys had to use a ladder to go to their bed but we took that as a play."
2686374,25841059,2015-01-27,5562303,Leif,"I was in Seattle for a sibling reunion. The flat is a great location within walking distance to Ballard restaurants and bars. Chris is a great host who handles any questions or concerns with an immediate response. 

The flat was clean and the layout with the airstream offered my siblings and I enough privacy not to get on each others nerves. The little extras of chocolates and drinks, and that it was stacked with pretty much everything you could possibly need made it all the more conducive for a wonderful stay. Will definitely book again when I'm back in Seattle!"
2686374,26306924,2015-02-09,25662201,Pam,"Chris was a great host, and even provided some delicious cake for us on our arrival!  The house was as described, and the neighborhood was friendly and felt very safe.  Everything was in good working order, the kitchen had plenty of cooking implements for our needs, and the beds were very comfortable.  This was a lovely place to stay!"
2686374,26512721,2015-02-14,16907912,James,"My girlfriend and I stayed one night here along with our 2 dogs. We had a great experience and would stay again. 

The house and location were great. There is only street parking, but we didn't have a problem finding parking; there was always a spot open in front of the house. The house is very dog friendly with dog beds and bowls laid out. We loved that! It's hard finding dog friendly places, so it was a treat. 

The bathroom is spacious, had plenty of toiletries in case you forgot anything, and the shower has nice water pressure.

We slept in the downstairs bedroom. We peaked at the upstairs bedroom/loft, and it has a TV which is nice, and the bed looked comfy. We didn't see inside the RV so we can't comment on that. 

My suggestion is to bring earplugs because there were a lot of odd noises going on in the house at night. I am not sure if it's the heater or what, but there were little squeaks all night long. With earplugs you will be fine.  

Pros: location, cable TV in all the bedrooms, snacks and water stocked in the house (thanks for the chocolate, too!), dog friendly

Cons: noisy at night
"
2686374,26588679,2015-02-16,23900390,Caitlin,"We had a great stay at the airstream retreat. There were 6 in our group so it was cozy but that made it even more fun. The kitchen was equipped with everything we needed for breakfasts, there were plenty of extra towels and linens, and Chris was kindly always available via text. We also appreciated the location, easy to find and short drive to downtown Seattle. It was a great trip!"
2686374,26726288,2015-02-17,21707899,Abby,The place was exactly as described and was just what we needed. We were 4 adults and two teenagers and had enough room. Loved the airstream. Location of bathroom attached to bedroom reduces privacy but not a problem amongst family. 
2686374,26852982,2015-02-20,5190766,Ryan,"Great stay, clear instructions..would def stay here again :)"
2686374,27191879,2015-02-27,24683111,Ashleigh,I couldn't imagine a better place to stay while visiting Seattle area. Perfect location!! I felt like I was in my own home. Chris showed us around the whole place when we got there. He also had a card and chocolates to welcome us! He even left a dog bed out for my furbaby! The pillows were so cozy and fluffy! The place was very clean and smelt wonderful! I will definitely be staying here again!!!!
2686374,27425564,2015-03-04,18286417,Timothy,Chris's place was perfect - exactly as described.  Great location - walkable to many points of interest.  Chris was available but not intrusive and we enjoyed staying here immensely.  The airstream was nice for a 3rd bedroom.  The loft was a very comfortable sleeping space as well.  We had a great time and will be back!!
2686374,27478615,2015-03-05,5226716,Rick,Absolutely perfect. Chris was there to greet us and made us feel right at home. The house was beautifully furnished and immensely comfortable. Literally hundreds of great restaurants and shops just two blocks away. The Bunkhouse should be on everyone's list when visiting Seattle.
2686374,27591382,2015-03-08,1420142,Rebecca,"Chris was a fantastic host, and the home and airstream were everything we had hoped they would be! Chris was always available and responsive: he checked in to see that we'd arrived, made sure that we were comfortable in the house, etc. The space was clean, comfortable, and stocked with every amenity we could have asked for, and it was all just a short walk from the heart of charming Ballard! "
2686374,27864682,2015-03-13,29121225,Liz,"Great location, room for All and Chris is always available if needed -- though, you shouldnt be needing him because you are smack dab in the middle of everything to do Ballard. When we travel north to seattle we will forever check to see if the ballard bunkhouse is available! "
2686374,27898990,2015-03-14,14810673,Courtney,"Chris was an excellent host.  He responded quickly to my questions and made my visit comfortable and professional.  I booked the property specifically for the Airstream, but fell in love with the house as well.  The neighborhood was quiet and friendly.   I would definitely book this location again. "
2686374,27974096,2015-03-15,21989125,Jonathan,Chris made us feel right at home with a fun and friendly energy that anyone going into a new area looks for. We arrived early and he left us a really kind note later in the day. It was in a beautiful area and super close to downtown Ballard where we had a great dinner only a nice walk away. The airstream was comfy and gave us great rest. waking up with leaves around us and fresh air was sweet. I would recommend the place to anyone coming to enjoy the Seattle area. Thank you Chris! people and places like this are what makes airBnb so cool.
2686374,28113985,2015-03-17,9815401,Shannon,"The upper bunkhouse is great super cute airstream bedroom and lovely upper deck for wine at night. I loved staying here. I slept in the loft bedroom and the bed was wonderful. Thanks for everything Chris!!
"
2686374,28151890,2015-03-18,28923923,Catherine,"Cozy, amenities extensive, pet friendly, clean, a great host(!!!) and a perfect comfy neighborhood. Description is accurate and spot on notes throughout the home make it easy to enjoy every feature (like the loft skylights). We will definitely stay here again. "
2686374,28194470,2015-03-19,20182377,Lori,"Chris was very sweet and friendly.  His response was prompt and he was always upbeat and kind, even when we had to cancel (very sick 18 year old dog).   Just from my dealings with Chris, I wouldn't hesitate to re-book his place...and hopefully have the opportunity to actually enjoy it next time!  "
2686374,28293209,2015-03-21,3041720,Ray,This place was awesome! Every detail was covered and he was super responsive. There were even some nice snacks to use. I'd highly recommend staying here
2686374,28481947,2015-03-24,16122093,Jonathan,"Stayed here for a weekend with my parents and we loved it!  The house was very clean and inviting. Great location because it's close to Market street, but you don't get all the traffic noise.  I stayed in the airstream and slept like a champ.  You have to be a little creative to work around the bathroom location but we knew that going in. All in all, I would stay here again in a heartbeat.  "
2686374,28628471,2015-03-27,29602840,Courtney,Was a great location and perfect for our family and dog!
2686374,28691386,2015-03-28,1537255,Jolie,This is a great upstairs apartment!  Very clean.  Well stocked with linens and cooking supplies.  Fresh flowers added extra charm. Owners were very helpful and communicative via email and text.  We stayed here overnight at the last minute and got a quick response to our request.  
2686374,28782872,2015-03-30,182522,Aliza,"We had a great stay in Ballard at the Bunkhouse.  Chris was a terrific host, very responsive and accommodating throughout the process.  The Bunkhouse is an a very pretty area of Seattle--we took the the bus from 2 blocks away for our Seattle exploring and Ballard's cute streets are a walk away.  The Bunkhouse was clean, well stocked with everything we needed, and comfortable for my family.  We even brought our dog, who loved the backyard and walking in the neighborhood.  We would stay there again for sure!"
2686374,29222200,2015-04-05,29954374,Joe,Everything was great! The space worked out perfectly and I highly recommend this location to anyone. A very comfortable and laid back vibe and Chris was great.
2686374,29857091,2015-04-13,6228633,Jessica,"The host (Chris) was very accommodating and welcoming. The house was very clean and all the facilities we as described on the ad. There was a TV in every room of the house and the washer and dryer did a really good job on some clothes that had been stained accidentally. I loved that the front door had a code to get in so no one had to worry about keys. I stayed in the loft and it was very comfortable, just a little difficult getting back down from. The neighborhood is great, very quiet and close to downtown. Would stay here again. "
2686374,29953708,2015-04-14,259571,Alison,The bunkhouse is one of the best airbnb's we have stayed in.  Chris thinks of all the details that will make any stay more welcoming and comfortable. Communication was easy.  The beds are super comfortable and the apartment was well equipped.  We didn't use the airstream but it looked very cozy.  The house is easy walking distance to all the great restaurants and shops in Ballard and an easy drive to downtown Seattle.  We highly recommend the bunkhouse. 
2686374,30116125,2015-04-17,30293215,George,"This retreat is awesome! My wife and I, along with two friends stayed here and really enjoyed it.

The area, Ballard, is beautiful. We would definitely recommend staying here!   "
2686374,30143963,2015-04-18,29244684,KeSorn,"Chris went above and beyond for us, I asked him if he has rice cooker,  he quickly one for us and even gave us the rice too. He stocked his fridge with water and sodas, on counter had snacks, every details meant that he wants his guests to be happy and we did. The neighborhood is very quiet and safe, we had no problem finding parking right in front of the house. The house is only minutes to everything."
2686374,30299413,2015-04-20,28630232,Bryan,"Chris was quick to respond, always friendly and personable. Couldn't imagine a better host. The place was fun, clean and well located to enjoy all Ballard's charm. "

2686374,31559389,2015-05-06,22214182,Gina,"My family and I had all of the fun at Chris's Ballard bunk house. The location was perfect and the house itself is adorable. I loved sleeping in the airstream and the bed was remarkably comfortable. Chris was a very nice host... Leaving us chocolate and snacks. The loft was cozy and perfect for my two little sisters. Also, allowing pets to stay is a great addition to an already wonderful little spot. Enjoyed my stay-cation with my family. Thanks so much, Chris! "
2686374,31619438,2015-05-07,6118334,Rick,"The Bunkhouse was perfect for our Seattle trip.
Chris is a great host, super welcoming and great communication.
Would like to stay again.

p.s. found a great happy hour / bbq spot down the street at Bitteroot :)"
2686374,31815744,2015-05-10,6844053,Brianna,"Had tickets for a show in Ballard and we totally scored on finding this spot. Chris is a total dream to work with. He pays attention to every detail (snack basket was a huge hit!) and was friendly and thoughtful through every stage of our booking, stay, and departure. Comfy beds and linens, stocked kitchen, and amazing location. Will definitely stay again next time we're back in Ballard."

2686374,32887586,2015-05-23,3178582,Steve,"Chris' behind-the-scenes hospitality shined. His quick response time, the ease of the check in process, a kind note of welcome, the swiss chocolate left for us...all these left an impressionable mark on us. The living space is compact and perfect adequate for smaller groups. The airstream served as a nice treat for us since we had a party of 5. The back deck is a delightful place to watch the evening come (and you can see the space needle from it as well!).

The drive to downtown Seattle took about 15 minutes, and there are wonderful restaurants in the the area (check out ""The Fat Hen"" for breakfast). "
2686374,33064486,2015-05-25,26082927,Chris,"The unit that we rented was as advertised! It was nice, clean, and close to the action in Ballard!  Chris was so nice to leave us a note congratulating us on our wedding day. The airstream trailer was perfect for pictures of my beautiful wife as well. I can't say enough good things about our experience. Thank you, Chris!"
2686374,33557237,2015-05-29,34308807,Luke,Chris was one of our best Airbnb experiences yet! Very informative and beautiful home. Fun little labels throughout the house ensured that we knew where everything was. The loft was a blast and the airstream inspired us to look into building one of our own. Would definitely look to stay at the Ballard retreat again. 
2686374,33636943,2015-05-30,7777164,Nathaniel,Perfect place and location. Wish I could stay longer. I always get nervous about pet-friendly places but this place was super clean and cozy. I'm glad I got to meet Chris because he was awesome too.
2686374,35199813,2015-06-16,2539852,Kathy & Jerry,"Chris is great to work with.  Once you get used to the layout (which he was very upfront about), very cozy.  Clean, comfortable beds, great kitchen, neat little 2nd floor deck.  Very walkable to Ballard restaurants, grocery, etc. of which he left maps & information.  Airstream with history book was great. Nice to have parking. "

2686374,35576883,2015-06-20,6896174,Zoran,"Lovely place and great for a city break. Quirky and unusual, very safe and quiet. We loved attention to detail and emergency supplies of water drinks etc. Thank you so much Chris."

The place was stocked with goodies which is something I didn't expect but a wonderful surprise. 
Chris was timely with his responses and a pleasure to communicate with.
Highly recommend this place to other visitors to the area."
2686374,36136731,2015-06-25,17262342,Kate,Chris was incredibly kind and responsive. The place was clean and perfect for a quick nights stay. 
2686374,36278086,2015-06-27,3630289,Patty,"A unique listing with the Airstream trailer in the yard.  A perfect man cave which my husband used for napping and guitar practice.  Also fun for us both to hang out in to keep an eye on our pups in the yard.  Speaking of which, thank you Chris for allowing our little doggies to stay with us.  It makes our trip much more fun to have the whole ""family"" together. As to the apartment itself - it was just as described.  Very clean, with great attention to detail and  even a note from Chris and goodies in the kitchen to welcome us.  Chris was immediately available and a perfect host.  And it even has parking (tight but works )!  Considering the great Ballard location, available parking, pet friendly, lovely upstairs apartment with man cave and small yard for pups it was really almost an unbelievably good fit for our needs.  Bravo Chris - we hope to return soon!"
2686374,36654095,2015-06-30,27559331,Brent,"Chris was amazing and the house is awesome. We had a great time. 
"
2686374,36844742,2015-07-01,33536614,Hide,"Chris was very accommodating and a great host. He took time to make us feel welcome in his home and was available by phone anytime. The house is full of character and history with a unique bonus of an Airstream trailer in the back yard. The house is equipped very nicely with everything you need. Very nice neighborhood and relatively close to the city centre by car. Thank you for the great experience, Chris! We all enjoyed our stay very much.  "
2686374,36914584,2015-07-02,5379671,Vidar,"Great place - Great location - Great host!

You get to sleep in a vintage Airstream, and it's super cool if you like rustic vintage Airstreams!

But if you really want a polished hotel room this one's not for you.

In the second floor apartment part you get a nice upgraded kitchen, nice bath albeit only accessible through the  bedroom. 

Living room is small but you didn't come here to hang out in the house did you?

All in all a great place only minutes walking distance from Ballard ave. 

And Chris was responsive and forthcoming!

Wish we only had more time to enjoy it and the surrounding neighborhood.  Our flight was delayed so we unfortunately arrived later than planned.  Regardless, the accommodations and location were excellent.  Thanks for the water,  coffee and snacks waiting for us as well! Perfect after our 12 hour day of traveling.  Would love to stay here again and highly recommend it to others. Thanks again!!  "
2686374,37046695,2015-07-04,10263157,Neil,Chris was great! The place was exactly like the pictures! Chris is extremely welcoming and helpful. 
2686374,37268901,2015-07-05,26634309,Lizzie,"Chris's place was awesome! The airstream is sweeeeet, and exactly as advertised.  Seattle is experiencing a historic heat wave, and to ensure we were comfortable, Chris installed AC units and brought a bunch of huge fans to make us more comfortable.   Great host, great place.  "
2686374,37450927,2015-07-07,92542,Jaime,"Our family stayed at Chris' on our way and back from an Alaska cruise. we felt welcome and cared for. His home and its location fit out needs. During that one heat wave day, Chris checked on us, replaced an air-conditioning unit for more cooling power and took us out to the Locks for a fun day and distraction from the heat. We are very thankful"
2686374,37718644,2015-07-09,34691278,Jennifer,"That was my 1st time staying at a Airbnb place. I loved it! The welcoming card and Toblerone were very appreciated. The  bedroom was super clean and everything you need is there.
Love the location, near Market street and Ballard Ave.
I will recommend to stay at this house, Chris was very welcoming.
Thank you, my mom and I had a fantastic time!"
2686374,37837133,2015-07-11,13243229,Nikki,"wow! This turned out to be the perfect place for me and my family. Super huge, with room for two teen boys and mom and dad, a well-stocked kitchen, and a perfect location. We walked to the local parks ( the big one is amazing - we saw immature hawks in the trees, and played for an hour), walked to the bookstore in Ballard, and even walked to the salmon ladders/locks! Thanks to the warm and lovely Chris for greeting us, and giving us great ideas of places to go and eat. We can't wait to come back! "
2686374,38036455,2015-07-12,6628567,Joshua,"The Airstream Retreat, a great place to securely store bikes, was perfect for our Friday night stay prior to departing early Saturday morning as we participated in the 200 mile STP bike ride to Portland.  The location provided an excellent selection of restaurants to choose from for dinner (highly recommend the Italian restaurant, Volterra) and also made for a short ride along the Burke-Gilman bike trail to the start line at the University of Washington.  Chris was a very gracious host making sure we had a place to park our Suburban for the night.  He also left us a very nice welcome card and a bowl for of snacks and goodies.  The Airstream is also pet friendly!  Staying at Chris' place was a breeze."
2686374,38132643,2015-07-13,1394012,Natasha,Great location! We walked everywhere in Ballard. Bedding was clean and pillows were great.  Highly reccomend Staple and Fancy for dinner. I would definetly stay here again!

Thank you Sir.  "
2686374,38613120,2015-07-17,33479299,Chia Chi,Chris is a very thoughtful host . He leaves some beverage and snacks for us . The house is cozy and lovely . We will be back soon .
2686374,39041187,2015-07-20,21019784,Tim,"Great place in great neighborhood, with tons of info about both the house and the area provided by host. Shower is AMAZING. Oh, and free waters, sodas and a Toblerone bar. This place was awesome."
2686374,39227927,2015-07-21,1168271,James,"Chris was fantastic in accommodating our last-minute and quick overnight request. He was incredibly communicative and made himself available to answer any questions we had. Chris went above and beyond to provide recommendations, clear instructions, and a warm and welcoming environment for my family. We loved the location, listing, and overall experience at the Bunkhouse and will definitely keep it on our radar for return visits to Seattle!!"
2686374,39277167,2015-07-22,13069740,Samuel,"Our host definitely made us feel welcome, with a nice personalized note, yummy snacks, helpful orientation to the neighborhood, restaurants and the house, etc.  House was just as advertised.  Beds were comfortable.  Everything worked.  Kitchen was nice (thanks for the coffee!).  No complaints whatsoever."
2686374,39612432,2015-07-25,36955,Silvia,"Chris's place is nice and very well equipped! You literally have everything you need! We did not use the outdoor camper, which provides an  extra bed, but I think it would be a great solution for a larger group! Chris is very responsive and kind! A great place for a reasonable price!"
2686374,40081661,2015-07-28,22377599,Ryan,"The Ballard House is a lovely historic home in the up and coming Ballard district of Seattle. Chris has done a great job working to restore the home and it shows. The unit is clean and well presented with all the amenities you would need.  

Between the loft, fold out bed, and main bedroom ... you can sleep 6 in just the house, plus 2 more in the Airstream retreat which is quaint and functional .. but nice for those that need more private space. There is only 1 bathroom, through the main room, so be sure to plan ahead when getting ready in the morning and evenings if staying with a large group.

The house is located in a great part of town close to grocery, transit, the Locks, museums and the very nice Ballard waterfront district.

Chris is very easy to stay in touch with and answered all of our questions as needed. "
2686374,40284260,2015-07-29,39156989,Greg,Chris provided a wonderful place for our getaway and first time using Airbnb.  I would recommend to anyone anytime for his listing of this property.  Thank you again Chris.
2686374,40499468,2015-07-31,7511408,Demone,"Comfy space. Great area. Chris is a very good host. 
"
2686374,40963735,2015-08-03,37934099,Balaji,"Bunkhouse and Airstream were a great stay experience. Chris has done an excellent job with keeping the entire place clean and well equipped. Very well thought out on anything we might need and taken care of already, very impressed. The small notes around the house were very useful.
The space itself was very comfortable and very home like. My 6 year old loved the loft.
Hats off for personal welcome card, candy and snack. Great place and great host."
2686374,43480261,2015-08-20,23230387,Ashley,"The good:
Well located, upstairs area was clean, well appointed and had all the necessary amenities including welcome snacks, drinks, guidebooks etc.

Chris was quick to fix things when they broke, including fixing the upstairs toilet when it broke

Beds and linens were comfortable and clean

The not-so-good:
The outside air stream was not fitted with a bathroom and kichenette as we had been told by chris it would be. We needed these amenities to be installed as a member of our party primarily uses a wheelchair. Chris did come over and install a toilet once we got there, but we ended up having to find alternative accommodation due to safety concerns. 

That said in the middle of summer, in Seattle, with a group of 6, only 2 of which needing relocation, staying in the accommodation for the other 4 remained the cheapest option so they stayed.

Without the issues with accessibility this place would have been great. In the end though, poor communication and a lack of promised facilities caused a major headache for us. "
2686374,43726000,2015-08-21,18907445,Villy,"We had a Nice time at Chris, everything was well plan an nice. We would certainly like too be there again. "
2686374,43785116,2015-08-22,26128555,Frank,"Although stayed for only one night, I really enjoyed it. Especially the well stocked kitchen with free drinks and even Mac n Cheese! I really appreciated the little stickers throughout the house with instructions. Parking available in the back. Chris was very responsive to our needs. Would stay again!"
2686374,44329822,2015-08-25,39633190,Peter,Great place to stay. Walking distance from 2 great breakfast places we tried. 3 comfortable bed. Chris was a great host. Would stay there again. 
2686374,44608799,2015-08-27,42208299,Zhiqing,"The house is small, but very lovely and sweet ness. Mr. Chris is a careful and kindness man. If you like cooking by yourself, you can do something in kitchen. It is important that the rooms and restroom are very clean. There are 5 people of us to live in the house. It's not good for us that there is just one restroom. It's not convenient for us to use it. If you are older traveller,It's not fit to live the upper level room because of climbing the wood ladder. Even though, I think it's worth to live in the house. It's wonderful trip for my family."
2686374,45067489,2015-08-31,26448821,Vinkie,"Wow! This experience was unbelievable. Chris provided a warm welcome note and stocked up the pantry and fridge with snacks and drinks. Everything was tidy and clean! Wish we could have stayed longer, though I will be visiting again soon! "
2686374,45441656,2015-09-02,41962912,Andrew,"Chris was a great host! He was always available to answer any question and made sure that our stay was comfertable and enjoyable! The accomadtion was excellent and the information regarding the area was extremely helpful! Would recommend to anyone! Great location, first class accommodation! "
2686374,45516894,2015-09-03,24515563,Patrick,"We arrived at the bunkhouse, easily got in using our code, and found a hand-written welcome card and cozy, spacious, adorable accommodations. I loved how Chris labeled instructions around the space (where light switches were, e.g.). There's not only a comfortable bedroom, but a roomy loft, and, as a bonus, an Airstream with a bed and bath. Fabulous! And close to charming Ballard district. "
2686374,45754016,2015-09-05,17578485,Hisato,"A very nice house at suburb Seattle. VERY welcoming. Loved those helpful instruction labels everywhere in the house.
My kids loved the loft space and a bed there, and I enjoyed private stay in the Airstream trailer :D
Would definitely come back. Thank you! "
2686374,46121358,2015-09-08,12457294,Neil,"A group of guys rented this place to stay in town for a wedding. We had a great time and suited our needs perfectly. We appreciated the flexibility and little touches from Chris, like the snacks on the counter. "
2686374,46359455,2015-09-09,43393111,Grégory,"The Bunkhouse was a really great house with all the facilities you may need !
Chris and Jenny are very kind people who do their best to make your stay really great !
Thank you for everything !"
2686374,47041205,2015-09-15,1938959,Janine,"Chris was very welcoming and accommodating host. And what a cozy, perfect little retreat this was! It was very walkable, cute, and had everything we needed for our 4 day stay in Seattle. We had a great time and would definitely recommend the bunkhouse if your travels take you to Seattle."
2686374,47489481,2015-09-19,8387683,Cindy,"We loved it! Listing was exactly as described. We received a nice welcome card and a toblerone. Kitchen is very clean. The bed in the main bedroom is very comfortable. Shower is wonderful with great pressure and nice soft towels. The house is stocked with everything you need and is decorated tastefully. The neighborhood is fabulous with many great shops and restaurants.  We had use of the Airstream, but did not use it so I cannot comment. We went in it and it was very cozy. The Keurig is a life saver and makes great coffee. Wifi great. Two thumbs way up!"
2686374,47753050,2015-09-21,42272767,Judy,"We loved being in the Ballard neighborhood.  Great walking area to wonderful places & fun things to do. The house is fabulous, unique and really warm and friendly.  Chris goes the extra mile to ensure your stay is perfect.  We felt like family.  Chris answered all my questions before hand and was so kind."
2686374,47947624,2015-09-21,25096058,Carolyn,"Chris is super host status!   I had to book the Bunkhouse very last minute and Chris was more than willing to have the apartment ready after my long trip.  The Bunkhouse is even more charming in person.  It is clean, thoughtfully furnished and stalked with goodies to make your stay feel a little like home.  Chris' added details such as a ""History of the Bunkhouse"" book, welcome card, and so many other things truly make this a special place to stay. I would highly recommend Chris and the Bunkhouse!"
2686374,48268860,2015-09-25,4586631,Brad,Thank you for extending your home to our crew! We had fun!
2686374,48593815,2015-09-27,35883284,Maura,"We had a great experience staying in the Bunkhouse! It was clean, cozy, comfortable, easy to find, and fun. The neighborhood was lovely too. We'd definitely stay here again!"
2686374,49162005,2015-10-01,31312955,Eric,"Chris was a great host responding very timely to email and requests, usually within minutes.  He accommodated a last minute change to our itinerary without a problem.  When I told him we needed additional heat in the airstream, he responded with explaining how to warm it up, provided an extra heater, and supplied extra blankets.

The Bunkhouse was accurately described in the Airbnb website, even having a sketch of the place showing all the rooms with size.  It is very close to Ballard's Market St and many restaurants and bars but not so close that you are bothered by any noise or traffic.  The drive downtown was very reasonable.

We had 5 friends in our party but there was plenty of bed space.  The extra bathroom Chris is installing in the trailer will be very helpful for larger groups who require more privacy.  The downstairs residents were not ever noticed making you feel like you had the whole building to yourself.  It was a plus having the electronic key entry so we didn't need to worry about having keys or misplacing them.

We will definitely consider the Bunkhouse when we visit Seattle again "
2686374,49432699,2015-10-04,492837,Scott,Our experience at the bunkhouse was great! Group of 6 of us (three couples) did fine with the space and made use of the airstream. Chris checked in over the course of our stay to make sure we had everything we needed and provided a great breakfast recommendation within walking distance in the neighborhood. I would definitely recommend to others. 
2686374,49798953,2015-10-06,16004868,Julie,"Chris welcomed us with a personal note, contact information in case we needed anything, fun history of his 100 plus year old home, sweet treats for the family and a nice welcome for our four legged companions too. Clean house, nice kitchen and bath, super comfy beds, everyone slept well. Hope to book a stay again in the near future. Who doesn't love an airstream?!"
2686374,49961127,2015-10-07,45771744,Nadine,"We made a last minute booking with Chris for 1 night, he replied promptly even though it was the evening. The house was great, clean and a friendly card to welcome us. There was only 3 of us but the house can easily accommodate 6. It's like a home away from home and I'm sad that we were only there for a short while. We have friends that live in the neighbourhood, Ballard is a great place, and Chris's house is an easy 5 minute walk to the main street where there is an abundance of cafes, shops, cinema and transport.
There was snacks and drinks left for us which was a lovely surprise and much enjoyed by my boys! 
I would recommend this house for it's great host and location, if we had stayed longer I would have tried a night in the airstream.
Thank you Chris xx"
2686374,50135926,2015-10-09,44250565,Jessica,"It was so nice to live in Chris house.The house is cozy and warm.Everywhere feels historical. Chris prepared many food and spices, especially Chinese spices. My friends and I felt like at home. The most important thing is the trailer's dream came true. I'm so impressed."

2686374,51566651,2015-10-21,2653504,Adam,"I had a great stay at the Bunkhouse, it was awesome.  Chris was very accommodating - I loved the clear tips and directions posted throughout the apartment.  Though I didn't use the Airstream in the yard, I could see this as being a great option for families with kids who want a unique adventure.  Can't thank The host enough for a pleasant stay!"
2686374,51682613,2015-10-22,19948253,Akeem,"Great place! Very hospitable host, great location and neighborhood. We were a company of 5 and felt absolutely comfortable. Strongly recommend this place. "
2686374,51866607,2015-10-24,24307203,Nickolas,Ridiculously comfortable accommodations. Bed was like sleeping on a pat of butter. Very homey home and a welcome card was a friendly touch. Lovely set up that I would love to stay at again.
2686374,52087502,2015-10-26,44513805,Rick,Our host made us feel very welcome and the accommodations were as listed.  Great walking distance to downtown Ballard.  Enjoyed our stay and will be going back.

And for the evening it felt like our place. Cozy, comfortable, and would recommend it to everyone. We're forward to staying again in the future."
2686374,52384866,2015-10-28,44686276,Dixon,"We stayed different house of Chris, Chris's houses were nice,one  was  convenient to downtown of  Seattle,the other was easy to back Vancouver.Chris was  easy to conversation.I would look forward  to stay again if I have  chance."
2686374,52557067,2015-10-30,47505080,Brendon,Excellent stay! Was a home away from home on a very busy business trip! Will be booking again in the future.
2686374,52814399,2015-11-02,4672003,Jeremy,"This was definitely the best AirBnB I've stayed at.  It's a fun little space especially with the Airstream in back.  It was the perfect space for my annual reunion of friends that live all over the country.

The Ballard neighborhood is a nice quiet place to stay in Seattle while still being close to a lot of excellent breweries and restaurants.

Although we didn't see Chris, he was extremely communicative and helped us with everything we needed.  He went above and beyond providing recommendations and helpful hints to make our stay the best.  He even recommended an excellent dive bar.

The listing description was very accurate.  I have the bad habit of missing one major detail when I book these things.  I didn't realize that there was only one bathroom when I booked it but it was clearly there.  I seem to do that with every booking.  Thankfully Chris added the wet room to the airstream which helped make up for my oversight.  Like the listing says, definitely make sure your group is comfortable with each other.  If you are, it's no problem.

If I'm ever back in Seattle, I'm definitely going to check to see if Chris has availability first before checking anyone else."
2686374,53232767,2015-11-06,1418637,Jeremy,"Chris' bunkhouse provided us with the perfect retreat close to home while our house was undergoing construction. Very prompt feedback, accommodations just as described, and amenities were great for the two of us plus our dog. Beds were very comfortable and nice to have some snacks available too upon arrival. Highly recommend! "
2686374,53631079,2015-11-10,37625192,Heather,Very welcoming and homey!  Lots of nice touches like cooking supplies and snacks to make your stay easy. Two nice grocery stores within walking distance. We loved mod pizza two blocks away. The house is quirky and very old but we loved it and felt at home. 
2686374,53797914,2015-11-12,26870977,Victoria,"Chris was most pleasant and relaxed.  He responded immediately after I booked and was at the house to greet us.

The home is very old with lots of character!  Loved the snacks, the coffee, even cream in the fridge.  Yes, there was construction going on next door; that crew was friendly too.  It was great to have a little home in Ballard from which to explore.  The Land Yacht; how cool.  Great to have a real plumbed toilet.  Would love to see the shower after it is done!"
2686374,54093789,2015-11-16,41176019,Violet,"Our experience at this location was perfect! It had three different rooms, which added to the experience, that where accommodating to our needs. The airstream was where I stayed and even though it rained and was very cold, Chris had provided a heater for the airstream that made it worth our while. Thanks for letting us into your home! "
2686374,54863290,2015-11-25,6287817,Stephan,"I had a group of 4 people stay here for a long weekend, and it was perfect for our group.  We were able to easily walk to bars nearby and close enough to downtown.  The guy that stayed in the trailer lived it!"

2686374,55092272,2015-11-27,23219854,Anna Sophia,"Chris hat uns spontan für eine dritte Nacht aufnehmen können und wir haben uns wie zu Hause gefühlt. Der Kühlschrank hatte Getränke und es waren Süßigkeiten in der Küche bereit gelegt. Auch der Wohnwagen war gemütlich. Alles war sauber und zur Klarheit beschriftet. Das Heizsystem funktionierte super, was bei Seattles eisigen Temperaturen überlebenswichtig war.

Chris spontaneously accepted us a third night in his apartment and we felt like home. The fridge contained free drinks and there were candies in the kitchen. The airstream was comfortable, too. Everything was clean and there were little captions for no misunderstandings. The heating system did its job, which we absolutely needed in the cold November temperatures of Seattle."
2686374,55448457,2015-12-01,48208259,Spenser,We had a great time at the bunk house! The 6 of us had plenty of space in the cozy house. 
2686374,55865742,2015-12-06,18936867,Orion,This place was stellar. Absolutely top notch. I wish we could have taken a longer holiday. The next time I stay in Seattle this is the first place I'll look to book.

2686374,56355810,2015-12-12,14207615,Steve,We loved this place! The beds were extremely comfortable and the house was well stocked with coffee/drinks/snacks. Will definitely return on future visits to Ballard.
2686374,56549162,2015-12-14,25900858,Adrienne,"Chris was super fast and responsive. We added a couple more guests to our reservation at the last minute and he was completely accommodating. The place was sparkling clean, cute and comfy, and had tons of sleeping spots. The location was awesome. We love the Ballard neighborhood, and Chris' place is right in the center of it. Would stay here again. "
2686374,56894992,2015-12-19,30247256,Kc,Awesome stay and Chris was a fabulous host. Very helpful and communication was as good as I've ever had on air bnb. He was able to help us adjust our reservation and was very prompt. Look forward to staying again.
2686374,57010919,2015-12-21,29756281,Nadine,"House had a lot of character and was stocked with everything we needed! Especially loved the snacks and soda because we were only there for a short time and saved us a trip to the store. Easy communication, overall great quick stay.
"
2686374,57242519,2015-12-23,29736928,Benjamin,"Homey place with a professional twist. That's exactly what I wrote in the guest book. 

Chris was extremely friendly and helpful. He made sure that our check in was smooth and knew where to find the things we needed. He even had a T-shirt with the bunkhouse's logo on it. Switches and cupboard were all labelled with simple instructions so we didn't need to do much guesswork. Plenty of sunlight in the house with the windows. The loft was a nice place if you need more comfort and privacy. The airstream was also fun and comfortable. There's a heater and fan in it that made it warm and cozy even on cold winter nights. The history of the place made it even more interesting. The location is just a short and straightforward drive from downtown Seattle. Plenty of shops nearby. 

In short, simply great experience."
2686374,57694286,2015-12-28,25225703,Josh,The loft and Airstream were perfect for two couples. The location is fantastic...walking distance to all in Ballard. Highly recommend this rental.
2686374,58367755,2016-01-02,50276188,Lani,"We had a great stay. This was our first time using AirB&B and it worked out perfectly. I give the owner, Chris, a lot of credit for making everything go so smoothly. His communication was clear and very organized. The house was great for our needs. The only thing I would mention is that the loft is finished and a great spot but its really meant for young set that can climb up and into the loft. It is not easy to get up there. We had six of us stay and that was a very full house. We used the Airstream which was a great option.  I'd love to have the whole house next time, not just the top floor. Bottom line, great location, good parking, great snacks and drinks provided by owner and comfortable beds. Really a good experience! Thanks Chris!"
8029177,45205915,2015-08-31,42511815,Joseph,"Jonelle was very sweet and accommodating.  We didn't interact much, but that's ok because we were both busy.  The ADU is very, very nice!  It was beautifully appointed and well maintained.  I highly recommend staying with Jonelle if you get a chance!"
8029177,49142265,2015-10-01,2656131,Mike,The place was perfect for our family's needs.  Everything is new and well stocked and a great location to walk out to the bluff or head into the downtown part of Magnolia.  Jonelle was also very responsive when a question came up.  Thanks for a great visit!
8029177,50478733,2015-10-12,43290298,Michel,"Awesome unit in a great neighborhood. Very private. Walking distance to bluffs looking over the sound and trails, nearby shops and restaurants. 
Would stay again when we are in Seattle again!  Excellent find!

"
8029177,51986783,2015-10-25,21268457,Bethany,"This cozy apartment is the perfect location for a laid back Seattle experience. An easy walk into town center where there are many restaurants and cute cafes. A beautiful view and walk along the waterfront,it's of sidewalks for running and discovery park is easily accessed from the location also. The apartment was very clean, well equipped, a super cozy bed and fun kitchen for cooking. If you are traveling as a couple just be aware that we could very clearly hear the family upstairs and if you can hear them then they can hear you. "
3446274,15888227,2014-07-17,17495884,Jeremy,My stay was wonderful. The room was clean and the house is located centrally to everything in Seattle. Would stay there in Seattle again. 
3446274,16146831,2014-07-22,16500297,Matt,"Excellent room in this b&b. Chose the smaller room. Clean, comfortable, and plenty of space. Hosts were fantastic. Most importantly, it was $150-200 cheaper than any 3 star hotel online- and guarantee it is nicer and cleaner than a typical hotel. Sure, breakfast is not included (as to keep the rate low) but if that means saving tons of money I'll take it! Will stay here again and have visitors stay here.  "
3446274,16522195,2014-07-28,15325481,David,The accomodation is situated a bus ride from downtown Seattle in a quiet residential area. The house is large and clean . My room although small was adequate and suited my needs . However it must have been situated under a bathroom as when someone had a shower ( 6 am and 5 am in a morning !) it was very noisy and eliminated any need for an early morning call ! The girls hosting the accomodation were friendly but a curtsey call during my 3 night stay to check everything was ok would have been nice . Shampoo and body wash were provided which was a good touch however basic coffee making facilities ( kettle and coffee sachets ) in the room would have enhanced the stay . I would recommend the accomodation to anyone but not to stay in that room !
3446274,17699225,2014-08-16,18466699,Samir,Great stay and great location!
3446274,18024692,2014-08-20,18915755,Mary,The single room at this B&B was perfect. Everything was clean and the staff was attentive. I got up early and came back late so I didn't use the amenities of a bread and breakfast...specifically the breakfast which kept the price low. The location was awesome. Near lots of shops and dining and near a bus station that takes you straight to downtown and touristy stuff. I'd stay here again for sure.
3446274,18214736,2014-08-23,6550611,Ganesh,"Had a great time at the Inn. The place itself is in a very quiet neighborhood and is a 10min bus ride away from downtown.  I didn't get to interact much with the others, but the little interaction I had with the Host was very pleasant...."
3446274,18885494,2014-09-02,18009813,Chad,"This room is well located, and I loved my time in Seattle. 

It's a good choice for a budget traveler who's looking for the basics--a twin bed in a tiny basement room. It's nicely decorated, but the ceiling is quite low. 

The room is within an easy walk of all the cool Capitol Hill businesses along Pike Street. "
3446274,19247742,2014-09-08,20866605,Frank,"Lovely, quiet room in an established bed & breakfast (though the breakfast is not an included part of the Airbnb price).  Spotless room with bath down the hall, nice waffle-weave robe in the closet.  I arrived late, which was easily accommodated with some text messages.  As shown on the photos, some steps at the front of the house and inside.  Location is great, with a bus line a half-block away.  Street is quiet.  The parlor and porch have tasteful and comfortable seating."
3446274,19426131,2014-09-12,13934500,Elizabeth,"It was a cozy room with very nice staff! There is noise, but nothing out of the ordinary. "
3446274,33302161,2015-05-26,2216803,Jimmy,"This was exactly what I needed and more than I expected, which was great! The area was perfect, good coffee and food nearby and the house was easy to access. Everyone was really prompt if there was a question and I would totally recommend it.

Thanks!"
3446274,35186831,2015-06-15,35088974,Manny,"I had a lovely time staying here.  The staff and owner were kind, professional and extremely helpful.  Although I had sent in my request at the very last minute, Shannon did everything she could to help me book the last place she had available. "
3446274,35862658,2015-06-22,29543411,Taylor,"This was my mother's first Airbnb stay and she loved it here... When we would meet up she wouldn't stop talking about how wonderful her host were, and how cute the house was. Thanks for taking good care of my mom, and she said she would definitely stay here again!"
3446274,36591584,2015-06-29,7675079,Sarah,"This room was so perfect for my stay. Neighborhood is excellent - great location for walking. I was welcomed by a wonderful note upon my arrival and hosts checked in with me during my stay to make sure I had everything I needed. Would definitely stay here again - thank you so much Shannon (& Emma, Anna, Rachel)!"
3446274,40670888,2015-08-01,10848483,Ron,"Very accommodating hosts.  Couldn't get the room I wanted for the whole stay, so they offered to split up my stay between two rooms.  Continental breakfast included muffins/waffles/cinnamon buns/ bagels and croissants and salmon-infused cream cheese that was really something special.  For the minority of my stay, I was in the less expensive room without Air Conditioning, but a fan was available in the closet and it made things tolerable, despite it being an unusually hot day in Seattle.  The view from the balcony rooms (these ones have AC) is charming and eclectic."
3446274,41784207,2015-08-09,36887121,Lane,"This room was perfect for me. It was exactly as described and well-kept. The location was great - only a mile from downtown which allowed me to walk most days. The public transportation options are good - about 20 minutes to downtown, and less than an hour to the airport. The area around the house is a nice, quiet neighborhood but there are lots of restaurants and bars within walking distance.

I had some issues with my flight being delayed, and then canceled to the following day, but they were able to accommodate my fluid arrival time with no hassle. 

The breakfast they offer is very good with healthy and filling options, and I ate there each day. They had tourism brochures and maps on hand and were able to help guests plan their day during breakfast. 

Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed my visit and if I make it back to Seattle I will be looking to stay here again."
3446274,45396147,2015-09-02,1771763,Katie,"This was a cosy single room with a very comfortable bed.  The bathroom was next door.  I would definitely recommend.
Katie"
3446274,48654602,2015-09-27,21534139,Ck,Very clean and quiet place near downtown Seattle. I would definitely recommend this place! 
3446274,49727295,2015-10-05,43691515,Adam,Shannon and Emma were both very friendly and helpful.  The house and room were very clean and well take care of.  The neighborhood was quiet but very close to a bus that could take you anywhere.  I would definitely stay there again.
3446274,53917563,2015-11-14,48003449,Hannah,"My stay at the Inn was extremely pleasant. It was very clean and quiet, and the location is fantastic-- right in north Capitol Hill, close to lots of bars, restaurants, and presumably shopping although I was not interested in shopping. 
Although I never got to meet my hosts due to my late-shifted schedule, they were very gracious in welcoming me electronically, and the place was kept very clean. "
7364146,46205440,2015-09-08,148480,Marisa & Reed,"Sarah's place was delightful. There was a wonderful view downhill toward Lake Union and of downtown. It was very convenient to buses on Aurora Ave -- minutes from downtown. It is a short walk to Stone Way and other Wallingford goodies. The lovely beans Sarah left made the mornings great!

I would definitely stay at Sarah's again. "
7364146,48299451,2015-09-25,11401155,Matthew,"Sarah's place is great. She met me outside and took me upstairs to show me around. Place is better than advertised. By the time the next guest arrives, I'll be it will be even better. (Sarah had moved in when I stayed there, so some artwork had yet to be hung, but it still had a nice charm.) The view is spectacular. I happened to be in Seattle at the right time of year, but Mt. Rainier and the Cascades were in full view nearly every day. There is some street noise as it's on a busy street, but if you close the bedroom window, you're fine. Great place in a great location. Perfect spot for a single person or couple looking to visit Seattle or who are considering moving. "
7364146,50564082,2015-10-12,20782943,Tess,"Sarah was an excellent host. She was very responsive in communication and provided recommended places to visit. Her attention to detail was also appreciated. She knew we were visiting for a conference and left directions for us which were very helpful. The apartment is a short 10 minutes drive to the University of Washington and very close to lots of restaurants and nightlife. Insuite laundry and spacious living area were highlights for us. We didn't get a chance to use the espresso machine but Sarah left beans for us that looked delish. The apartment has everything you need for you and your furry friends should you be traveling with them. I'd recommend this apartment as a home away from home close to shopping, restaurants and activities in Seattle. We saw the small but very funny theatre sports in the U district. A must see. "
7364146,51347431,2015-10-19,37185230,Kelly,My overall experience was amazing! Sarah made it very easy for my husband and I. She was very friendly and allowed us to keep our luggage behind for a few hours. The house was very clean and allowed us to have a very nice trip. 
7364146,54917638,2015-11-25,10749365,Gini,"The unit was as described and was a comfy, convenient place to stay. Sarah was really good about communication and made sure I had all the information I needed. Short distance to great Wallingford restaurants which was an added bonus. I was lucky enough to have a clear day during my visit - the apartment has wonderful views of Mt. Rainier and the Cascades!"
7364146,55240013,2015-11-29,15792437,Loree,"Our visit was very pleasant and positive. This apartment is as described and has a truly gorgeous view. Sarah was welcoming and had the space ready for an early check in on Thanksgiving Day, which we really appreciated. "
1263470,42825542,2015-08-16,13761636,Katie,"My boyfriend and I had the opportunity to stay at Jessica's place for three months. It was a perfect home away from home as were new to the region. She is friendly, accessible and it's easy to sense that Jessica really values bringing people together as a community. 

The apartment itself was newly renovated, spacious and comfortable. I couldn't get in enough time cooking in the awesome kitchen! The garden is beautiful and it was great to have the opportunity to get my hands dirty and participate in maintaining the space.

South Seattle is a special place and Jessica can point you in the right direction of places to eat, connect with others, exercise and adventure. 

Thanks for a great stay and we might be back!"
1263470,43546124,2015-08-20,40337719,Karlie,"Jessica was a sweetheart and a great host. She brought us eggs from her chickens and left us a bottle of wine which was very kind. The listing said there was a washer and dryer in the apartment (which there wasnt) and there was no TV which wasn't too big of a deal, but I would have brought a larger laptop had I been aware of that. "
1263470,44442964,2015-08-26,39183505,William,"Jessica's basement apartment is actually more like the ground floor in that the floor is level with the back yard.

It was comfortable, well furnished, roomy and clean. There was quite a bit of useful breakfast food in the fridge and the fresh, morning eggs from her chickens were an especially nice touch. 

The kitchen is well outfitted with dishes, pots and pans and utensils, excellent for cooking meals in. The bed was very comfortable; the newly redone bathroom was just fine.

Jessica was attentive and her hospitality extended to her deck and back yard next door, including the choice of fresh fruits and vegetables from her garden.

The wi-fi connection worked well and we didn't care, but some people may miss a TV set."
1263470,45378312,2015-09-02,36557778,Christine,"We had a fantastic stay at Jessica's apartment while in Seattle for a convention. She made us feel very welcome, and ensured we had all that we needed. The photos represent the space well. It is a spacious, well-lit apartment, only 10-12 minutes walk from the light rail. The property itself is quite nice, if you are at all interested in urban homesteading, this is the place to visit! I was happy to help with the chickens when I could. Would gladly stay again."
1263470,49206151,2015-10-02,7053439,Virginia,"I have used Airbnb many times prior and have had decent experiences but this will be the first exception.

I did not sleep well during my stay here. I was either woken up by chickens, the creaky floorboards from the upstairs unit, or the strong daylight that seeps in due to the translucent curtains. Even the washer and dryer would wake me up, the machine was very loud and it's right next to the bedroom. The laundry is shared with the unit upstairs. 

The heating doesn't work at the moment and is in the process of being fixed. 

There was a vast amount of spiders in the unit. Since this is a basement, there are crevices in which they can come in from. The spiders are mostly found in the kitchen and bedroom (shelf area) with the occasional appearances in the bathroom. There are also plenty by the door since there is a garden growing outside. Bug spray is highly recommended.

Wifi is very weak and doesn't work in the bedroom, as the router is located in the host's house next door. The host mentioned that she had purchased a repeater to fix it for future guests though. There's also barely any cellular service as well - I had only 1 bar. Stay in the kitchen if you need cellular or data service. I use T-Mobile, so your mileage may vary with different carriers.

The toilet is very weak and gets clogged almost daily. There is a plunger under the sink so get used to that being your new right hand. 

There is no privacy in the bedroom due to the aforementioned curtains. DO NOT change while you're in there because you can be seen from outside the window, especially at night with the lights on. 

Walls are very thin, so don't be surprised to hear the conversations of people living upstairs or the sound of their smartphone vibrating. The floorboards at the upstairs unit seem to be very creaky as I always heard it in the bedroom and kitchen.

The location of the house is in Rainier Valley, specifically the Dunlap neighborhood. It is a 0.6 mile walk to the Othello light rail station, or 0.7 mile walk to Rainier Beach station. The area nearby is a bit rundown and shady. I would recommend driving instead. The light rail is about a 30 minute ride to Westlake station, so it takes about 45 minutes to get there when you include walking. The vicinity is also poorly lit at night so I suggest getting home before dusk if you are traveling by foot.

Participating in housework is expected because it's a solo run urban farm, and there are chickens and a huge garden to attend to. The host calls, texts and touches base nearly everyday to discuss the delegation of chores. I understand that this might appeal to certain people, but if you are the type that values privacy and personal space, I do not recommend staying here at all. "
1263470,55567496,2015-12-02,46492363,Mike,"We really enjoyed having such a big backyard for our toddler to explore. He really enjoyed greeting the chickens in the morning. They were not very loud as we had read in another post. Othello park isn't far which was nice, and the light rail is so convenient. We went to the tree lighting ceremony and walked home from the train. The neighborhood is very quiet. Boeing has a landing strip near by and our little guy loved seeing all the different planes in the sky. Depending who lives upstairs it can be a little loud but we had a sound machine for sleeping and it helped for the most part. It is so easy to get to west Seattle and downtown. I felt like it is a very convenient location. Columbia city was not a far drive and it had some cool shops and restaurants. We would for sure stay here again if we had the chance. "
1348777,6336351,2013-08-08,618221,Austin,Andrew was an amazing host. The place was extremely clean and well maintained. I really enjoyed the stay. Great location with nice transportation system. It was worth every penny. You'd love the stay.
1348777,6475674,2013-08-13,7859191,Alex,"This is a great place to stay. I didn't know the host before booking a place for my trip to Seattle, but I feel like I lucked out with these guys. Andrew and his roommate are very accomodating and friendly, even going out of their way to invite me to come along and hang out with their friends on the weekend that I visited.

The apartment is kept very clean for guests, and there were options available to me for where I would like to sleep. You have access to the roof of the building where there is an incredible view of the city. One thing to consider: You won't fit sleeping on their couch if you're over 5'10! Andrew offers an air mattress as your other sleeping option.

Overall, I had a great time during my trip to Seattle, and a big part of it would be thanks to Andrew's place."
1348777,6650474,2013-08-19,6724040,Andrew,"I really lucked out with this particular AirBnB... I was on a standby flight to Seattle with no real assurances what time/day I would be on the ground, but sure enough I was able to make all of my flights - as soon as I landed I sent my booking request to Andrew and it was accepted within minutes. 

Communication and logistical coordination was great. Pertinent information regarding the complex was revealed upon pur intro and I felt welcomed in his space.

Would recommend. Would definelty stay again. Thanks Andrew!"
1348777,6724621,2013-08-22,4135649,Ashley,Awesome spot in a fantastic location.  Walking distance to everything.  I highly recommend this to future guests.
1348777,6774889,2013-08-24,8333656,Raul,"My background is that I came to Seattle to work at Westlake and I wanted an apartment in Capitol Hill.  When I arrived, I stayed in hotels far away from Capitol Hill and Westlake.   At the time, I was not able to reach the appointments to view apartments in Capitol Hill quickly.  When I arrived at the appointment, an application had already been submitted.  I felt disappointed because even though, I was putting a lot of time apartment hunting, I was not getting any results. 

Then I recognized that in order to be successful, I needed to be the fastest to submit my application, and to be the fastest I needed to be in Capitol Hill. So, I registered and signed up for Airbnb and I sent out a requests and I got positive response from Andrew.  

Andrew was superb host, he reached out to me make sure I was on my way.   Andrew provides an exemplary Airbnb experience, one of the options he has is an air mattress.   Andrew, invited me to see a movie, watch TV or play video games, which I opted out, and then the small chat with his room mate went on to a full memorable conversation.  Later Andrew's roommate offered to show me the amazing view from the roof.    It was dark so the view was missing the mountains but the the lights on the  buildings look incredibly bright and colorful. 

Andrew and his roommate are exceptional at hosting.    They are young, energetic, interesting, smart, knowledgeable, friendly, caring, athletic, fun and professional hosts.     I did not notice anything out of place, they were prepared to host.   They were helpful, they asked if I was comfortable, and even helped me with my next AirBnB move.  When I arrived I was tired and feeling disappointed because of my lack of success at finding an apartment, but the stay with them re-charged me.   For a first Airbnb experience this was excellent."
1348777,6840598,2013-08-26,8310410,Rachel,"This was my first Airbnb experience so I was a little apprehensive but I couldn't have asked for a better experience. Andrew was an awesome host. He welcomed us with beers, which was rad, and then invited us up to the roof to hang out with him and his friends. The view was amazing and he made us feel right at home. Amazing location and parking was surprisingly easy and free! And you could walk to every bar and restaurant imaginable.  The apartment was very nice and clean and the air mattress was the most comfortable one I have ever slept on :) I would definitely recommend staying here. "
1348777,6974222,2013-09-01,1600141,Jake,Andrew has a great place in a great location.  The apartment was clean and neat.  He definitely made me feel at home.  Close to plenty of good places to eat and amazing places to drink.
1348777,7354431,2013-09-16,7461364,Arne,"What a great spot this apartment is at. No car required! I was in town for a wedding on capital hill and I was able to walk from the apartment to the location. The roof terrace is gorgeous and the room with private bathroom great. (mattress is a little soft for my taste) . Absolutely a place where I would come back.
Andrew the vivid and young host is very friendly, most helpful and has great recommendations for restaurants and bar close by. Thanks Andrew and best wishes "
1348777,7823992,2013-10-04,9215462,David,The reservation was canceled 6 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
1348777,8199284,2013-10-20,9294229,Daniel,"I had a really nice stay, my bed was comfortable, the room was really quiet very clean, and the apartment is nice. My hosts were very friendly, although I barely saw them while I was there, due to my work requirements. Andrew even game me a free bus pass. The area is fun and on a major street with shops, cafés and some great food options. Easy access to public transit. I would recommend this spot to my friends. "
1348777,10143135,2014-02-02,1640335,Cynthia,"Andrew's place was central. It was walking distance to restaurants, bars, and shops which was really nice. Tony- his flat mate was very nice and suggested a couple bars to my friend and I. Their apartment was spacious, and fairly clean. The lock was a bit of hassle to learn and operate (automatic door with a plastic key) but Tony had some pretty good patience for us two girls. All in all very accommodating. The only thing that was lacking was toilet paper."
1348777,39587932,2015-07-24,39281495,Richard,"Andrew was great, I booked him super last minute (as in the day before) after things fell through with friends. And even though he was heading out of town, he made sure that I felt taken care of and welcomed. His place was incredible, and in the perfect spot for someone new to the city to walk around and find things to do. 

Any bar or restaurant I could imagine wanting could be found in a 10 minute walk from his apartment.

Andrew and his place definitely helped to facilitate an awesome night in one of the coolest cities I've been to.

"
1348777,41703576,2015-08-08,36581412,Chris,"Andrew was an excellent host. He responded incredibly fast, within the hour I sent the request, despite it being the night before my stay. The apartment was clean and inviting and the location was excellent. It is a short Uber/Lyft away from downtown but there is plenty to do on Capitol Hill, all within walking distance."
1348777,44826051,2015-08-29,16778920,Matt,"My girlfriend and I rented a private room from Andrew for a few nights. Overall set up was great. We had the master bedroom which connected to a private bathroom. Complex is nice and the unit was clean w/ an updated feel. Definitely worth checking out the views from the rooftop deck. Neighborhood has a lot to offer within a short walk. Would definitely stay there again. Was not a problem, but only thing that I thought was a tad odd was that the other bedroom was rented out to another airbnb guest. The host gave us a head's up about that before we arrived though and it worked out just fine."
9370866,55472788,2015-12-01,17663202,Kenny,"Austin was a really gracious host. We came in late but he was really patient in waiting for us even though it was Thanksgiving's Day. 

His apartment was really gorgeous as well. There was a ton of space for us (we had 7). The beds provided were more than comfortable. Everything was clean and prim, we found everything that we needed to make food for ourselves and had a really wonderful stay. 

The location was amazing. It's so close to downtown, literally a 10 minutes drive or less. We had easy access to anything that we needed. 

Oh and did I mention the rooftop view. 

Definitely worth a stay from anyone who's visiting!"
7517684,45808660,2015-09-06,29832252,Jose,"Terry was really prompt to reply to our questions, and quite a friendly host. He gave us great recommendations for places in the city. His flat has amazing views and the location can't be beaten. Room and bathroom were spotless. "
7517684,46396015,2015-09-10,40536190,Kristie,"This apartment was perfect for my friend and I.  We didn't have a car, so the location was ideal for walking everywhere.  The place was clean and had all the things we needed for our stay.  Terry Logan was so easy-going, we felt very comfortable hanging around for our afternoon snacks and drinks in between our adventures.  It was like it was our own place, even when he was there!  The listing details made it all sound so welcoming and we definitely felt that way staying here."
7517684,46621946,2015-09-12,39868854,Clint,"Terry's condo is right next to Pike's Market. You literally go downstairs, and are in the middle of downtown Seattle. We loved the modern open floor plan. Big windows open to the Seattle cityscape. Parking is a challenge, but you expect that in any modern city."
7517684,47365253,2015-09-18,39771250,Hanjing,"We had great experience stay in this place for past 10 days!! First of all, the location is perfect! Easy access with walking distance to the Pick Market, Seattle Art Museum, 5th ave. shopping places etc. Second, the the live condition is as clean as you would expect! The apartment is neat, bright and open. Last but not least, the host - Logan is really considerate and helpful with our needs, which made our trip more enjoyable! I highly recommend you to stay at this place, if you want to experience Seattle city life!"
7517684,47684865,2015-09-21,32146071,Jeff,Terry was a great host and everything couldn't have gone smoother. He was extremely hospitable and courteous. He even let me have some of his Sapporo beers that were in the fridge. The view was also simply breath taking. I would recommend this spot to anyone who's traveling to Seattle! I know I'll be hitting up Terry next time I come to the Emerald City
7517684,48370316,2015-09-25,40079044,Anna,The host canceled this reservation 8 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
7517684,48574053,2015-09-27,43186572,Afshana,Terry was a great host. The apartment was beautiful with a great view and phenomenal location. Host was also very accommodating to early arrival. Would definitely recommend!
7517684,50016608,2015-10-08,297969,Jessica,Gorgeous apartment! Incredible views. Logan was such a great host and made our stay comfortable and fun. Would definitely love to book his place again! 
7517684,50850972,2015-10-15,12959366,Ankita,"Logan has a beautiful apartment in downtown Seattle, very close to pike place market and on the waterfront. It's easy to get everywhere and surrounded by great restaurants and lots of happy hours! Logan was a great host and very accomodating. He was also easy to get in touch with and very friendly. Would definitely stay here again next time I'm in Seattle! "
7517684,52048794,2015-10-26,657450,Lauren,We loved staying at Logan's place for our 3-night stay in Seattle. His apartment was clean and the room was spacious enough to accommodate two guests and our belongings. The building location is extremely convenient and accessible by public transportation from the airport. We also enjoyed the beautiful views of Puget Sound from the high rise. 
7517684,53290830,2015-11-07,27858487,Matt,"Very nice apartment in a convenient location, especially for out-of-towners. Logan was a great host and very welcoming. While you're in Seattle, be sure to try a Seattle-style hot dog with cream cheese and caramelized onions on it!"
7517684,53760854,2015-11-12,33295196,Robert,"Neighborhood and apartment were as described. The host was there to let us in and very helpful and accommodating. Told us we could help ourselves to any food in the kitchen. Very nice location with a short walk to numerous attractions, including Pike Place market, museums, restaurants, and conference venues. "
7517684,56464197,2015-12-13,50697000,Brenda,"If you're ever in Seattle and in need of a place to stay, Logan's got the spot. His space was perfect for a mini vacation, right in the heart of Seattle and walking distance from everything. The location is not the only thing to rave about, the building itself was beautiful and included some great perks. Logan was a lovely host. "
5848330,32929556,2015-05-23,4796930,Brooks,"Heather is a great host- very friendly and helpful! Her place was very clean and comfortable, she laid out fresh towels and set out a stack of her favorite records for us to listen to. The apartment is in a great location and the perfect size for one or two guests. "
5848330,35512521,2015-06-19,33874155,Shane,Heather was great. She took the time to recommend some places to listen to music and was a great host. I really liked staying in Fremont and Heather's place was walking distance to great food/cafes.
5848330,35721185,2015-06-21,35344384,James,Great experience !   Thank you Heather. 
5848330,37161483,2015-07-05,32781544,Dana,"Studio was in a great neighborhood in Fremont, which was close to restaurants, Lake Union, and an easy bus ride to Seattle downtown. It was very clean and a comfortable bed. We would definitely come back to stay here again."
5848330,40680750,2015-08-01,6228309,Emily,"Heather's apartment and cute, clean, and in a great location. Heather was very responsive and I have zero complaints!"
5848330,41268713,2015-08-05,3240599,Izumi,The studio was lovely and comfortable.  Perfect location.  Comfortable and clean.  Would certainly stay there again. 
5848330,42203742,2015-08-11,38288710,Summer,"House was lovely, hostess has excellent taste in records, style, local nightlife, and restaurants.

Super easy to catch multiple bus lines to get around town, and a charming neighborhood to boot. 

The space is perfect for one or two folks. If you like good food, great neighborhood haunts, and a cozy place to tuck in I would highly recommend this spot. "
5848330,42762626,2015-08-15,20119719,Samuel,"The place is exactly as listed, a cute studio near Fremont. It is within easy walking distance of two major bus lines and the Fremont troll. 

Fresh towels, clean sheets and a kitchen well worth the price. The only downside is the area around the house is a little rundown, but it isn't unsafe. "
5848330,45830992,2015-09-06,28497412,Bonnie,"Heather's place was exactly as described and exactly how it looks in photos. So cute and charming and cozy. 

Fantastic location, we walked to everything we needed and wanted to do in the neighborhood (Fremont) and also to convenient buses to go to Ballard and downtown.

We didn't end up needing to ask questions or text for much, but she was responsive and lovely. Overall this was a great experience and I would happily stay there again!"
5848330,46826896,2015-09-13,43635511,Rob,Heather was good to work with.  It is a cute studio in a convenient location.  Only minor con - a bit of road noise.
5848330,51099281,2015-10-17,3399018,Erik,"Heather's place was just what I needed after a long day of apartment hunting. It's a small place with lots of charm. It's walking distance to a lot of good bars and food, street parking is free, and she's got some records you can toss on to pass the time. 

I would definitely rent from Heather again. "
5848330,55310597,2015-11-29,3383761,Inderpreet,"We never met Heather, but she was really great in communicating and making the whole stay great. The studio is clean and perfect. Its off a major street, but parking was easy and you can not hear anything inside the apartment. "
5848330,55830599,2015-12-06,37049182,Mona,"My husband and I had a great time in the Freemont area.  Heather's place was comfortable and perfect for our vacation.  Even though we didn't meet Heather, she did make us feel very welcome and was easy to coordinate with.  It was great being able to bring our small dog along as well!  Overall, a great first Airbnb experience! "
1171574,5027514,2013-06-08,6531938,Wei,It was my first airbnb experience and I happen to be the first guest at Phil and Andrea's. The house is lovely and neighborhood friendly. Phil is very helpful and warm-hearted and keen to offer every help I needed.  I only met Andrea once but he is also very friendly. It was a wonderful experience.
1171574,5303098,2013-06-23,1562565,Marta And  Alfredo," Don't expect a luxury place, if you want this you must be willing to pay too much more. The room is very good for the price. The location is very good because you have public transportation around the corner: 3 bus lines that take you to the main attractions in Seattle, which is important since it is difficult and expensive to rent and park in the city. A plus was the privacy of the room, with its own entrance Also we liked  checking in and out flexibility. The best part is the hosts: very friendly and always ready to help and give good advice.. It was a pleasure to meet and talk with Phil and Andrea."
1171574,5463991,2013-07-01,1905523,Cassie,"Phil was very welcoming and friendly.  The space is clean, quiet and peaceful.  It's close to everything and I'll definitely come again when I'm in Seattle.  Recommended!"
1171574,5535107,2013-07-04,7152643,Amos,"We stayed at Phil's basement for 2 nights. It was overall a good experience. They were really friendly and nice host, even leaving us cakes and pastries. The location is ok, connected to downtown Seattle by bus which takes about 20mins. The room is nice and comfy. "
1171574,5735571,2013-07-14,5919322,Karsten,"That's why we travel via airbnb: In Phil and Andrea we found new friends in one of the most beautiful cities of the world and their house was nothing less than a home far away from home. That location and the hospitality of these hosts are really hard to beat. They also provided us with a wide selection of toiletries in the bathroom and free breakfast-coffee! And if you want to drink a perfect italian espresso or cappucchino, visit Andrea's Caffé Torino. It's the best. We will definitely come back!!!"
1171574,5997433,2013-07-25,6253290,Derek,"Simply put, Phil and Andrea were the perfect hosts. It was extremely easy to book with Phil, and he was generous enough to accommodate some unusual requests since I was staying at his place during a big move. As other reviewers have noted, the little details like the pastries and the coffe/tea that Phil and Andrea attend to really make the place feel like home.

Just a few notes on the area: Madrona is not the most busy neighborhood in Seattle, but it was a nice and quiet place to relax after a long day of touring. I didn't get a chance to try the public transportation, but it was very convenient to drive to and from and park in the neighborhood in case you have a car. Some convenient and tasty places restaurants in Madrona to try are Naam Thai, Ezell's (deliciously fried) Chicken, the Catfish Corner, and Assimba (though any of the Ehtiopian restaurants on Cherry and MLK are probably awesome).

A few last tips: it can get a little chilly but there is a heater in the space (that I never had to use). Make sure you push the key towards the door a little bit when trying to lock/unlock the back door (also, turn away from the door to lock and towards to unlock).  The little corner with all the food and utensils on it works great as a desk if you need one. Nora's wood (right next door on the corner of 29th and E Columbia) is worth a peek. Molly Moon ice cream is delicious (get the salted caramel and the scout mint). Enjoy your time in Seattle in an awesome place!"
1171574,6025517,2013-07-27,3302921,Lauren,"The room was everything we needed and more. Though I did not get a chance to meet Phil face-to-face, he was still an absolutely fantastic host. From the travel brochures in our room to the pastries on our arrival, everything was great! I would definitely stay here again. Close to so many things, walking or by car, and a wonderful neighborhood to boot! Thanks again for hosting us, Phil!"
1171574,6447404,2013-08-12,193275,Ditte,"We never got to meet Phil, but we almost feel like we did. He was very accommodating from the beginning and almost immediately send us all the info we needed and contact info even though he wouldn't be in town. The room fit the purpose and it was nice having our own bathroom. The garden is wonderful and the next door park is cute. The neighborhood is nice and if you don't mind the hills you can walk almost anywhere. Would stay there again, and maybe meet face to face with our friendly hosts.. "
1171574,6565827,2013-08-17,5537031,Conor,Phil and Andrea were friendly and gracious hosts and the room was comfortable. I would stay again when my travels being me back to Seattle. 
1171574,6734163,2013-08-23,7476255,Andre,I enjoyed staying at Phil and Andrea's place. I met only Phil and he was very friendly and accommodating. The room was just as described with warm wood finishes and claw foot tub in bathroom. The place is close to buses that take only 20-30 minutes to get downtown or to connect with rail lines. I enjoyed sitting on the  wood deck at the rear of the house where there is a lot of foliage after a day of being downtown. I also liked exploring the local residential neighborhood which I would not have experienced had I stayed downtown.
1171574,6819073,2013-08-26,7778398,Anton,"Phil's spot was perfect. The accommodations were exactly as described with no surprises. This is a comfortable, simple, clean basement room. We never actually met Phil but he was still a great host and even left some delicious pastries from the cafe that his partner owns. Thank you for a great first Airbnb experience!"
1171574,6918355,2013-08-30,7405833,Roberto,"Beautiful place! 
Phil and Andrea were very welcoming, we even got some bake goodies from Andrea's cafe when we first arrived to their place.
It was great having a little fridge, a water kettle, coffee, tea, etc.
It's located on a quiet neighborhood but you can catch a bus about a block away that will take you into the city centre or some other more busy areas."
1171574,6987284,2013-09-02,7498906,Fabrizio,"This was a perfect choice to visit Seattle. Excellent location with lots of parking space and many buses towards capitol hill, downtown and other parts of town.

Plus, the house was beautiful. You have your own entrance and keys so you have 100% privacy and no hassle in coming in or out anytime you want. The boys were also very very friendly and helped us with whatever problem (we had an issue with an electric charger). "
1171574,7049074,2013-09-04,2841100,Laura,"Highly recommended! If you need a place to Stay in Seattle you can't go wrong with Phil's room. Phil and Andrea live in a beautiful home conveniently located between downtown and a nice beach of the washington lake. We had a car so going around wasn't much of a problem for us, and in any case a couple of blocks from their home there is a small area with restaurants and coffee shops. It was very easy to communicate with them (I talked a lot to Andrea because Phil was out of town) and check in and out was very easy. In the room, which is very private and clean, you will find an A4 with all the information you need and some great tips about what to do and where to eat in the area. If you get the chance to talk to them they will give you even more tips! They really are great hosts! The only tip I have is that if you are terrorized by spider (I know it is silly, but I am), just bring somebody with you that can kill them all off before going to bed! I think this is the only drawback about staying in a comfy wooden room surrounded by trees and nature! "
1171574,7280601,2013-09-14,8225553,Erin,"My partner and I stayed for two nights at Phil & Andrea's for a short vacation in September, 2013.
We are happy to have met with Phil.  We could tell immediately that he is a wonderful person.  Although the guest house is not one of those that provide you with luxurious experience, Phil ensured us that we were more than welcome to ask for anything or help if needed.
The best thing about the guest house is its location and price.  The price is reasonable.  The location is only 5-minute drive to Seattle downtown.  Buses to downtown are nearby.  Cafes and grocery shops are easy to reach in the neighbourhood.  
There is a generous size fridge in the room, and a toaster; however, there is no microwave oven.  But guests are welcome to use theirs in the kitchen upstairs."
1171574,7333409,2013-09-16,1709734,Jake,"great location, super accessible, is as described. totally worth it for the money, would highly suggest staying with Phil (met very briefly) and Andrea (didn't meet). "
1171574,7408718,2013-09-18,8848323,Cameron,"I was in route to Seattle for several meetings and after looking at hotel prices I decided to try Airbnb. I contacted Phil and in less than a hour he responded, 

Getting to his place was fairly easy and when I knocked at the front door he answered. The space is in the basement with a private entrance and full private bathroom. 

It was private, quiet, had everything I needed and the wifi connection was very strong. I enjoyed my stay and wish I had booked it for another day when I had the chance. Close to major highways and not far from downtown it is the perfect area. 

Phil was great. The few times we bumped into one another coming or going the chats were always nice. For this to be my first experience with Airbnb I am glad it was with Phil and his basement space. Next time I am in Seattle I will without doubt be booking with Phil again."
1171574,7611865,2013-09-26,8593528,Maura,Phil was very nice and helpful.  He helped me charge my phone when I lost my charger and lent me an Orca card to get around town on public transit. The room was great too.
1171574,7794322,2013-10-03,8540324,Amanda,"Conveniently located and very kind hosts.  Though, I didn't get to meet them this trip, Phil and Andrea made every effort to make us feel at home and give us resources for our visit in Seattle.  I would definitely stay here on my next trip!"
1171574,8390239,2013-10-28,4462210,Luisa,"Phil's place is fantastic!  Great location, easy to get to Lake Washington.  Lots of street parking!  His home is so lovely, the outside has beautiful gardens, and the inside is cozy and warm.  Perfect for a Seattle get away!  
Thanks! "
1171574,8557032,2013-11-04,9747927,James,"Phil was a very welcoming host to us, and we very much enjoyed our stay in Seattle with him.  I would gladly recommend this cosy apartment as a place to stay.  "
1171574,8629368,2013-11-09,9110697,Mohamed,Pill was a great host and was very helpful during my trip. The location was convenient in order to get around. I will definitely contact Phil again when visiting seattle! 
1171574,8835140,2013-11-20,7978504,Charlo,"Phil's room was a wonderfully cozy place to stay.  I wasn't there in the warmer weather to enjoy the garden, but I can see that they would be pretty.

The bed was very comfortable.  There is a pot for boiling water, and coffee and tea are provided as well as a fridge and a few dishes so that you can easily eat there.  

It is in the basement, but the wood panelling was very cheery and I loved having a separate entrance.  I didn't need tourist assistance because I was visiting my daughter, but it seemed as if they'll help with those things if you need it.  There is good information written up about local restaurants, busses, and grocerty store.

I would definitely go back there again."
1171574,8877828,2013-11-23,10042781,Vincent,This is a nice place. Phil was flexible and quick to respond to questions. The space was clean and comfortable. I would definitely stay here again.
1171574,9074637,2013-12-04,5728335,Raymond,"Ciao al tutti,

The room 'Private Entrance & Central"" was as advertised and more. I left the airport and took the light rail plus one bus and arrived in well under one hour (decided not to rent a car). When I arrived Phil had left instructions on how to enter the location where the key was placed and even left a slice of very tasty pumpkin bread (wished they left a couple more slices). The room and bath room were very clean and I had more than enough heat (I actually had to turn off one of the heaters, and I'm from L.A. lol.) There are three close and very convenient buses that are anywhere from two minutes to seven minutes walk away. My 'Uber' ride from downtown to Phil's place costs $10.00. 
Phil provided an iron and also allowed me to use the washer and dryer. Phil and Andrea made themselves available if needed. The co-host, Andrea owns 'Caffe Torino' at 422 Yale Ave. which has an amazing Sunday brunch, which reminded me of my sisters place in Italy. There is also 'Catfish Corner' a quaint family owned restaurant one block away, which serves some very tasty fried catfish and chicken wings. 
I highly recommend 'Private Entrance & Central' and I will use it again in the future.
"
1171574,9228032,2013-12-15,355418,Kevin L,It was like a little cabin in the middle of Seattle. Close to downtown and very quiet place! I would recommend. Andrea was very nice too!
1171574,9490747,2013-12-31,4619720,Robin,"Great stay!!! Very cozy and warm ... Although Phil was in Mexico , his partner Andrea was very friendly and accommodating ... Highly recommend !!"
1171574,9661149,2014-01-04,6373324,Ashley,"We stayed three nights at Phil and Andreas and it was great. The room is spacious and clean, with everything you need to pull together an easy breakfast, although there is a great bakery right on the corner. Easy buses to anywhere in the city, and amazing ice cream and Thai food a few blocks away. Phil and Andrea are courteous and helpful, but also give you your space. Basically like renting a house/apt but at a great price in a great neighborhood. Stay here, be merry. "
1171574,9730210,2014-01-06,9595910,Kristana,"Phil is a very caring host.  He met me on the street and carried my suitcase to the place.  It is a nice cozy room, all paneled in wood, in an interesting neighborhood."
1171574,9918363,2014-01-19,2261656,Austin,"My stay at this location was great! The private entrance makes you feel like you definitely have your own space, but having Phil and Andrea upstairs is nice if you ever need suggestions.

Phil and Andrea left little notes around the room as instructions on how to use things, and also wrote a page about the history of the house, their background, suggestions for the area, and how to use the shower, amongst other things. I thought it was a great touch that really made me feel comfortable in the space."
1171574,10024868,2014-01-26,5598973,Aarti,Phil's place is so comfortable. It is definitely the perfect place for two people and is within a thirty minute walk of downtown and capitol hill. He is a wonderful host and is so helpful and thoughtful. I highly recommend staying!!
1171574,10164132,2014-02-03,11603713,Susan,"Phil's accommodations were quiet, cozy and very comfortable. The room felt very much like a studio with several cozy seating areas with good lighting.  Nice touches were a fridg, plates & utensils, a tea kettle, tea bags and even special breakfast pastries left for us. The entrance was well lit and easy to get to. We would definitely stay again. 
"
1171574,10315504,2014-02-12,9727115,Richard,Great stay with Phil. Great space and an easy walk to see Seattle. Home is beautiful and Phil was very accommodating.

The location is also amazing, in a nice neighbourhood with a lot of little restaurants and bakeries at walking distance.

Phil is always reachable and really helpful, he has tons of ideas of where you can eat or what you can do!"
1171574,10434307,2014-02-18,11886995,Andrew,"We throughly enjoyed our stay at Phil's house. The place is clean, neat, has all the amenities. The location is very convenient close to downtown Seattle. Phil is a nice guy, very friendly. I would definitely plan on coming back to this location when I come back to Seattle!!! "
1171574,10513830,2014-02-23,10862417,Jenny,Phil (and Andrea) were lovely hosts. It was a real pleasure to share their home in Seattle. The room is a wonderful nook in the city and within walking distance of all that Seattle has to over. Would definitely recommend you staying here. What's more Phil very kindly helped us get to wherever we needed to get to when we left AND he was always there to offer sound advice on what to see and where to go. Get booking air bnbers! 
1171574,10721418,2014-03-04,5294288,Bridget,"The location is beautiful: between a tiny park and a bakery! And the room is really nice. I didn't have much contact with my hosts, but I would definitely stay there again."
1171574,11327898,2014-03-30,7390485,Bryan,"Wow!  How amazing!  Andrea and Phil were so warm and welcoming.  They even left us some pastries from Andrea's cafe - so good!  We loved the design of the place, and we felt safe and warm with all the extra blankets and heaters.  Thanks again for your hospitality, we really loved our stay in Seattle!"
1171574,11522419,2014-04-06,13619644,Christian,"We had a great time staying at Phil's and Andrea's.

We were able to see a lot of Seattle and the surrounding area while we were there as their place is in a great spot! Phil was very helpful and very nice. I would recommend their place wholeheartedly!
1171574,11964776,2014-04-20,13530522,Ariana,Phil and Andrea were amazing hosts!!! This was my first experience using AirBnB and thanks to them i will definitely be using it again! The room was cozy and private and adorable! They thought of everything their guests could need and were very inviting and generous. 
1171574,12246518,2014-04-27,13449705,(email hidden),"It is exactly as described.  It was clean,  convenient to restaurants,  local merchants and parks.  April is unpredictable but the heater was helpful when needed. Great neighborhood for walking!  "
1171574,12360815,2014-04-29,10275781,Patrick,"Phil and Andrea were great and friendly hosts even with our last minute booking. They were extremely easy to communicate with and were available for us to ask questions before and during our entire stay in Seattle. 

The room was perfect - it was clean, well stocked with anything you'll need (Towels/Shampoo/Conditioner/Toothpaste/Tea/Coffee/Water Boiler/Utensils/Plates/Fridge/Wifi/+More!), and provided plenty of privacy. Street parking was also plentiful!

We enjoyed our stay very much and would definitely stay here again."
1171574,12622145,2014-05-06,13733662,Linda,"The location was perfect—just far enough from where I was attending an event to provide walking exercise (except when it rained), and the house is close to a main street so walking alone didn't worry me in the least. As I was leaving early and coming in late the whole time I was there, I was very glad to stay at a place with its own entrance. All I needed was a kettle, mug, and tea bags and all were provided. Comfortable bed, effective heater, excellent notes on how things worked (ie. the bath/shower taps), and fast wifi. All in all, a great place to stay in Seattle.  "
1171574,13345259,2014-05-26,12921471,Stefanie,"Phil and Andrea were wonderful hosts! They were super easy to get in contact with, soo friendly, accessible, and had great suggestions for their neighborhood and for the city (GO TO Hi-Spot Cafe, bistro Turkuaz, Molly Moon's, and the EMP)! They live in a BEAUTIFUL home with a peaceful, private back yard in a gorgeous neighborhood--our strolls up to 34th Avenue were our favorite parts of the trip. The room is beautiful, private, and SO comfy, and the house is just a block away from a downtown bus line (so convenient). Phil and Andrea were kind enough to let us use their washer/dryer, and they let us borrow their ORCA card (so we could save $5 on the purchase of the card itself), which was so helpful. And the treats from Andrea's caffe were delicious!!! We can't rave about this lovely experience enough! Thank you both for a memorable airbnb experience during our first trip to Seattle! If/when we come back, we will stay here again! :)

Stefanie & Bobby

P.S. While you're getting ready in the morning, drink some delicious hot tea and listen to 90.3! It's the best radio/news station ever. "
1171574,13606688,2014-06-01,13571199,Diane,"Where do we even start with this wonderful homestay- first of all, Phil and Andrea were genuinely friendly, knowledgeable, and accommodating hosts. They're attentive yet easy going, and I felt very comfortable asking them a variety of questions. As for the room itself, I couldn't have asked for more because everything we needed was already quipped (fridge, electric kettle, extra blankets, towels, dinnerware, heater, etc). It felt less like a basement and more like a cabin we had to ourselves. It was clean, cozy, roomy, and overall it was the perfect room where we'd look forward to stretching our limbs after a long day of trekking the city. There are helpful notes/instructions posted for appliances and city guides around the room, and the bus stop is only a block away. 

We had such a memorable experience at Phil and Andrea's, and grew very attached to this place! Thank you again for those delicious pastries. I definitely recommend this place to anyone traveling through Seattle :)"
1171574,13832087,2014-06-05,5946065,Brian,"Great little place and nice guys, conveniently close to city but nicely apart. "
1171574,14430282,2014-06-19,711053,Velda,"Phil and Andrea have a beautiful house, and they have done up the basement so nicely! I spent four nights there and felt totally at home - the bed was comfortable,  and I absolutely loved the bathroom. It was clean and the clawfoot tub was an experience. Thank you to Andrea for leaving all those delicious pastries for me, I enjoyed them so much. You had everything you need to get ready for a day out in Seattle (buses were really convenient too, you could get anywhere). Also, Phil was one of the friendliest hosts I've ever met. I would be back in a hurry!"
1171574,14599499,2014-06-23,1819703,Christina,"A relaxing ""cabin"" in a beautiful home, Phil was very accommodating and informative on where to eat, shop and spend our time in Seattle! Thank you so much for the hospitality and for sharing your home with us!"
1171574,14737559,2014-06-25,5085903,Josh,"Our stay at Phil's place in Seattle was great. He made accommodations for us to arrive early which was very kind of him. His house is just up the block from the downtown bus and easily accessible from bike paths. Since guests enter the den through the back, the room is quiet and private. Great stay. "
1171574,14819102,2014-06-27,1308396,Phillip,Phil and Andrea were great host.  Exactly as expected and had a terrific time.  Great location.  Very central to all places I wanted to go see.  One of my best Airbnb experience.
1171574,15039497,2014-07-01,2722676,Patricia,"My daughter and I recently stayed in the room in Phil's home with a private entrance. The room was exactly as advertised. It was in a beautiful old home in a very nice neighborhood. There was a heater if needed, although the temperature was perfect for us without it. He provided coffee, tea, and hot chocolate if you wanted it. He also had soap, shampoo, and conditioner available in the bathroom. The bed was very comfortable and the bath/shower wonderful. Phil was excellent with communication and available whenever we needed him. He was very friendly and hospitable, even sharing baked goods with us a couple of times during our stay. There are several good restaurants close by and wonderful coffee and ice cream shops, as well. I enjoy running in the morning and the location was perfect for this. There are two bus lines a block from the house, which we used every day. I would definitely stay here again on my next visit to Seattle."
1171574,15307495,2014-07-07,10263414,Jonathon,Phil was a perfect host. He left notes for us when we arrived in the middle of the night and was very accommodating on all requests. He had a lot of pointers for the neighborhood and was excellent at communicating with us. Would happily return next time we are in Seattle. 
1171574,15472970,2014-07-09,5699205,Pete,"Room was very nice, and clean. Lots of helpful advice about the city and surrounding areas. Phil was very friendly and helpful. Would definitely stay again! "
1171574,15582603,2014-07-12,12709006,Justin,"Phil and Andrea were great hosts. They accommodated a later check-in and an uncertain check-out time. They greeted us with delicious treats, recommendations for places to go and how to get there, and were genuinely interested in our experience of Seattle. Phil suggested we swim in Lake Washington, which we did and quite enjoyed on a summer day of walking around in the city. Many of his other suggestions were totally on point. We were grateful to have such engaging hosts.

The basement apartment was perfect for our needs. The neighborhood is lovely and full of chickadees, finches, and flowers. We had the pleasure of gracing by bushy lavender upon entering the gate to a private entrance and got to sleep in the most comfortable bed. The apartment includes helpful labels and tips for using amenities. 

We would definitely stay here again. Thanks for making Seattle so welcoming!"
1171574,15664712,2014-07-14,2525255,Natalie,"We stayed at Phil's place in Seattle very recently and had a warm and enjoyable stay in this great city. Phil and Andrea are wonderful, caring and sociable hosts (thanks for the pastries and cherries!) and very knowledgable. We loved Phil's map of their favourite local places (we found a great restaurant  on 34th for our 2-week anniversary :)).

Phil was really helpful about getting us oriented to the area (before and during our stay). It is a safe, green and friendly neighbourhood and easy to get around (especially if like us, you choose the public transit route) both for getting from the airport and then downtown. The buses run until about 12am (we know because we caught just about the last one :))) Late at night and on weekends (especially Sundays) they run at less frequent intervals... however timetables are posted and some stops have the automated indicator boards).

The basement-cottage was just charming, with beautiful touches like the historic clawfoot tub (felt very decadent 1920's ... in a fun way), the lovely lit-up garden, lots of storage space for our stuff, maps and ""get around"" info,, facilities for coffee/tea and making snacks...

We would definitely recommend Phil's place on your Seattle trip!"
1171574,15868174,2014-07-17,15913371,Charlie,"Staying at Phil and Andrea's home was so much more than what we expected. Their place was incredibly cozy and super convenient to many cafe's, restaurants, coffee shops, and parks. It was very clean and offered a lot of privacy. We could not have asked for two better hosts to make our first trip to Seattle relaxed, exciting, and beautiful. Phil and Andrea go above and beyond to make sure your stay is comfortable and fulfilling. The description of their home is exactly as stated in the listing. We would definitely come back to stay here if we are ever visiting in Seattle again and would highly recommend staying here if you can. "
1171574,15952082,2014-07-19,14382982,William,"The room was great - clean, organized and equipped better than we expected! Nice and cool during the unexpected heat wave we found in Seattle. Phil is a gracious host, laid back and made us feel welcome. The location is great – close to anything you need and then some. We were very busy during our visit so didn't really get to interact with our hosts, but they made sure we knew they were always available if we needed anything."
1171574,16249067,2014-07-24,15533837,Ali,"Phil is an excellent host!  He and Andrea are both very kind, hospitable, helpful people (thank you for the delicious pastries)!  We loved returning to this adorable space each night.  The location is perfect and the space is lovely and cozy.  We would definitely stay here again if I ever visit Seattle again."
1171574,16461631,2014-07-28,15228045,John,"Phil and Andrea are old hats at this; they know how to make folks feel welcome and if you need help in navigating Seattle or eating places, etc., they're there to help.  However, what I appreciated most, is they let you be yourselves.  That is, if you want assistance with anything in relation to the apartment, which we didn't since Phil leaves these great notes explaining how everything works, they are right there pronto to address your needs or questions, but, moreover, should you just want to do your own thing, they are unobtrusive in a very cool sort of way. In short, great hosts, great central location, and a great place to sleep!  I would definitely recommend staying here and would revisit again."
1171574,16623106,2014-07-30,12882593,Li,Phil did a great job welcome us when we first arrived. And gave us the insight information of point of interest. The room was wonderful. Overall a great experience! Can't wait to come back to Seattle again! 
1171574,16746358,2014-08-01,11342624,Claire,"Phil is a wonderful host! His place is in a great spot to explore Seattle from (bus stop to downtown just round the corner) and Madrona itself has some lovely cafés and restaurants (and great ice-cream!!). We were made to feel extremely welcome and Phil had lots of top tips for the local area - including taking a dip in Lake Washington which is within easy walking distance. The room was clean, well equipped and comfortable - we would definitely recommend staying here!"
1171574,16821521,2014-08-03,366304,Simon,"One of our best AirBNB experiences. Phil has thought of everything! Comfy bed, blackout blinds, coffee facilities, lovely bath/shower, plenty of local info... I really can't fault the place, and on top of that Phil was super helpful and communicative. Six stars!"
1171574,17100992,2014-08-07,2548468,Michelle,"Phil met us at the door and showed us to the room which was exactly as depicted on the site.  The room was clean and very comfortable and well-located for our needs.  Phil also provided nice touches of fresh fruit from their apple tree, coffee, tea,  hot chocolate and delicious pastries!  He was also willing to provide local information if we had any questions.  I would definitely recommend this listing and we will certainly check back for availability when we next travel to Seattle!"
1171574,17432348,2014-08-12,14594998,Helen,"Place was clean, quiet and private. Phil was available to show us around upon arrival and had fresh apples and pastries for us. Location of place was a bit of a hike to downtown or lake Washington but only because Seattle is very hilly. 34th street is nearby and has cute coffee shops and restaurants. And Kurt Cobain's (last) home was a 20minute walk to see.  Try the bakery around the corner - it's delicious!! All in all - a great experience and would stay there again."
1171574,17617207,2014-08-15,16067110,Sarah,"The room we stayed in was very comfortable.  The mattress was like sleeping on heaven, I need to ask Phil what it is called.  The hosts were super kind and welcoming.  I appreciated the map with cool places to go and the treats from Andrea's cafe.  Anyone looking for a great place to stay in Seattle would be very comfortable here.  "
1171574,17936530,2014-08-19,11524810,Maggie,"I'd highly recommend this location for a stay in Seattle. Phil was extremely communicative; I never had a question about the neighborhood or the room. The room was pretty basic, but we didn't spend much time there. It was comfortable. The house is located about a $7 Uber ride or a 15-minute bus trip from downtown. One night I walked about seven blocks to a great new restaurant: Red Cow. Phil's partner Andrea, who runs a bakery, left us delicious chocolate and almond croissants one morning, too. While we didn't even see our hosts during our short stay, we felt very welcome. "
1171574,18176180,2014-08-23,14213155,Helen,"Phil and Andrea made us very welcome. The accommodation was clean and comfortable with very easy bus access to downtown and other places we wanted to see.
Highly recommended and would stay again. 
If you like authentic Thai food the Lotus near to Phil's is great.  The Ethiopian next to the Lotus also has tasty food.
We didn't get to Andrea's coffee shop but the cakes left for us were delicious.  "
1171574,18318153,2014-08-25,3084535,Clément & Audrey,"The house is conveniently located near 2 buses heading downtown. The room is very neat and private. 
We just had time to say a quick hello to Phil and Andrea. They were very welcoming and considerate (we got pastries from Andrea's cafe). 
We recommend them!"
1171574,18874514,2014-09-02,15075087,Megan,"We had an amazing trip that was made all the better by our 'home' for the week. Phil was incredibly welcoming and helpful, the room was delightful, and we would definitely stay here again next time we are in Seattle! Thanks so much for all your help and hospitality!"
1171574,19075857,2014-09-06,13871278,Karin,"WONDERFUL!!! The listing reflects the room and location very well. Phil was fantastic giving us advice on various things, from parking to nature destinations.  He and Andrea made us feel very welcome, and the room is comfortable and quiet.  Highly recommended!"
1171574,19201467,2014-09-08,18348383,Scott,"What an awesome first AirBNB experience. From before I even arrived, Phil made sure that everything was in place to make me feel right at home. Even thought I was 3k miles away from where I live, I never felt like a stranger. The room is very comfortable, the claw foot bath tub reminded me of the old homes where I grew up, and Phil is such an interesting guy to talk to. This was an absolutely awesome experience, very comfortable place to stay, and overall I can't thank Phil and Andrea enough for being such wonderful hosts. I will be back again!"
1171574,19359223,2014-09-11,671655,Elisabeth,"Phil was there to welcome us and he explained everything thoroughly.
We enjoyed our stay tremendously. The room was quiet and comfortable with all the amenities available and we loved the bed.
We had a great time exploring the city and the neighborhood and loved meeting Andrea at his Italian coffee shop, where we savored the coffee and sweets. What a great surprise to find the delicious pastries in the morning.
We recommend this place very highly.
"
1171574,19478518,2014-09-13,6291062,Ashley,"Phil was an excellent host! He was super friendly and offered us great conversation and wine upon arrival as well as recommendations for local restaurants and sights. He also made homemade poundcake for us that was waiting when we returned from dinner and a treat the second night too! - just a really great experience!

The room was also super tidy and cozy, tea and coffee options were provided for the morning along with a recommendation for a great cafe around the corner. Phil's directions were also really easy to follow since we'd never been to Seattle. The house is very close to a local bus stop making it really easy to travel around the city. I'd 100% recommend the place and would definitely contact them again for future visits."
1171574,19590308,2014-09-15,10812873,Chris,We had a wonderful time at phil and andrea's home! Very welcoming and an amazing place to relax after a long journey. A beautiful room with a very nice bath! We also received useful recommendations for exploring Seattle.
1171574,19784081,2014-09-18,19986620,Isobel,"Phil and Andrea were so accommodating. They were wonderful hosts. Snacks on arrival, beautiful room, private bathroom and private entrance made our stay massively enjoyable."
1171574,20138815,2014-09-24,17897738,Kevin,Everything about the stay was good. We will return. All was as described. Thank you for a pleasant experience.
1171574,20286391,2014-09-27,2806325,Micha,"We loved our place at Phil's and Andrea's. The room was as described and very comfortable. When we arrived Phil was there to meet us and show us everything. Phil left the next day for his own vacation, but Andreas was there if we needed anything. Going to the center was easy, but we are a bit spoiled and didn't want to use public transport so we used Uber. It was $9,- to the center and no fuss with the bus! If we ever go back to Seattle, we definitely stay with Phil and Andrea again!"
1171574,20552103,2014-10-01,17898223,Eun Hye,"Phil provided very prompt replies, with friendly responses that answered all of our questions.  The house was in a great location, neither too far nor too close from downtown. It was also close to buses that carried us to the essential places of Seattle. The room was clean and spaciously cozy! You get to have a private bathroom too, with soap, towels, shampoo/conditioner/body wash, and tissues all ready for your convenience! My friend and I went around late September, and Seattle weather was perfect for most of the days, but at nights the temperature did drop a bit. But no worries! The hosts have provided a heater and if I recall correctly, there was a humidifier as well. Phil and Andrea were excellent on respecting our privacy. Finding their yummy treats hanging on the door was such a delight after a long trip to Mt.Rainier! Overall, the hosts and their room allowed a more enjoyable vacation for us! Thank you Phil and Andrea :)"
1171574,20821322,2014-10-06,3853258,Christine,"We only met Andrea, since Phil was on vacation himself, but both were very kind, never left a question unanswered and helped us a lot. 
The room was very spacious, tidy and clean and it was really cozy. 
We also liked very much the location: Angel's Café is right around the corner for breakfast and there are a lot of nice restaurants within walking distance. We recommend the accomodation to anyone and would stay here again next time we visit Seattle :)"
1171574,21125222,2014-10-12,18354790,Precious Ann,Hands down the best time we had in seattle. The place was great and the public transit made it real easy to get around with ease. In the mornings we went to the bakery at the corner and in the evenings there were so many places nearby for dinner. We enjoyed spending the day traveling around and were happy to celebrate Andrea's second yr anniv. of his business. The food was great!! I am glad we got to have dinner with Andrea when we were there. We hope to come back to stay on our next trip. Definitely our favorite place. 
1171574,21393994,2014-10-16,8385649,Celine,Our stay at Phil's place has been perfect. The room is better than described: full of tips and treats. Phil is a wonderful host and makes everything easy for you. The neighbourhood is nice and quiet. A wonderful place to stay in Seattle.
1171574,21472741,2014-10-18,330828,Tiffany,"Our stay at Phil's was great! We arrived on a rainy afternoon and Phil was home to greet us and show us to the room. He was very friendly and helped with providing some restaurant recommendations. We actually ended up going to one of his top recommendations for a vegetarian place, Cafe Flora. The room had plenty of amenities, including towels and a microwave, kettle and some basic kitchen supplies. We didn't end up using any of the kitchen stuff but it was nice to have the option to heat up food. The room got pretty cold but there was no shortage of heaters! Phil even left us some pastries our first day and they were greatly appreciated in the morning when we woke up. A lovely experience!"
1171574,21669033,2014-10-21,5701236,Kat,My friend Katie and I had an excellent stay at Phil's.  We were given good directions on how to get there and on how to use things like the clawfoot bathtub shower and heater etc.  Both Phil and Andrea were excellent hosts as they provided yummy treats and useful tips on what to do in Seattle depending on the weather.  They were available for questions without interfering with the seclude of the private room/entrance.  I would highly recommend their home to anyone coming to visit Seattle. 
1171574,21839547,2014-10-25,21821708,Alexander,We enjoyed staying here and Phil was a great host. Phil recommended stuff to do in town and gave us some yummy treats from his partner's café. There's great places to eat within a short walk of the house and the neighbourhood was beautiful and quiet. It's about a 30 minute walk into downtown and there's all sorts of stuff to do in the city. Highly recommended listing!
1171574,21957272,2014-10-27,6547734,Jon,"Phil was a great host and it was evident that he has put a lot of time and effort into making sure that each of his guests feel welcomed and comfortable. I really enjoyed my time in Seattle, and this wonderful lodging in a great neighborhood was definitely a contributing factor. Phil was great at corresponding and keeping in touch to make sure that my stay was as pleasant as possible and stress free. "
1171574,22242857,2014-11-02,16901057,Alicia,The room was great and in such a beautiful house. Phil was a great host and was very helpful.
1171574,22388795,2014-11-04,21360545,Cyrena,"My boyfriend and I had a great time staying here! Phil and Andrea have a lovely home in a great location. The space we stayed in was clean, cozy and had all the amenities for our brief stay! After exploring the city we came home to lovely treats from Andrea's bakery which were absolutely delicious and a great surprise. I plan to return to Seattle again and would love to stay here another time . "
1171574,22943478,2014-11-18,17707376,Eve,"Me and Ben stayed in Phil and Andreas place for 2 weeks and it was truly wonderful. These guys are such lovely people and fantastic hosts that made our stay so comfortable. Their place is gorgeous and has everything you need and we can honestly say the bed is one of the comfiest beds we have ever stayed in. The location is fantastic, we didn't need a car at all Seattle is a great city for walking and this place is in walking distance of downtown and Capitol Hill, we actually walked most days but there are buses too all within a 2 min walk from there home. 
It's very private with it's own entrance so you really feel like it's your own little home but Phil and Andrea were always available if we needed anything. If your going to Seattle you'd be a fool to not stay here, if we go back to Seattle (which we definitely will as we've fallen in love with it) we 100% want to stay here again we couldn't fault one thing :). Thanks again guys.
 Eve and Ben"
1171574,23788075,2014-12-10,5987645,Kimberly,"Our stay at Phil and Andrea's home was great! Each night we were greeted with tasty treats at our door steps and the warmth emanating from the heater. 

The place looked exactly like the pictures posted on the site. Aside from the treats, we really enjoyed all the notes throughout the room (how to properly use the shower, kitchenette, etc.).

Thanks again!"
1171574,23962007,2014-12-15,11916964,Carol,"Wow. This room is AWESOME! Looks exactly like the picture. Andrea and Phil did a great job making it feel very homey and cozy. My best friend and I loved staying here. We also appreciated all the little notes they left around for us containing little tips. We felt very safe here. 

We did not get to meet Andrea and Phil personally since were had such a limited time and were always in a rush but we could tell that a lot of thought and effort went into these rooms. A major plus was the private entrance that allowed us to come and go whenever we wanted. One night we came home at 3am so it was nice to know were were not disturbing anyone coming home. 

Seattle was beautiful, I miss it already. Thank you for the delicious cupcakes as well. We can't wait to come back. THANK YOU, AGAIN!!!"
1171574,24118309,2014-12-20,17952261,Serena,"We absolutely loved Phil & Andrea's place! The room was clean, cozy and spacious, and the private entrance made us felt like we were in a ""entire apartment"", definitely a plus if you are looking for a place with convenience and privacy at the same time. The location was very central, we had a car, and everything was within 10 minutes drive. First time in Seattle? Phil & Andrea's place is definitely the place to stay! Highly recommended!! "
1171574,24479880,2014-12-29,23915319,Romain,"Very warm and cozy place, close to different bus stops with good frequency to downtown seattle.
The place was very quiet and clean and the host kind and helpfull.
We had 3 very good nights at Phil's place."
1171574,24600090,2014-12-31,9621455,Sidhaant,"Beautiful little basement bedroom. The house is very conveniently located right next to downtown (20 minute walk) and just a bus ride away. Phil was extremely accommodating and easy to communicate with in spite of his absence due to traveling. The bedroom was warm, ready and spick upon our arrival with a box of pastries as a welcome gift from Phil and his partner. The bedroom has all the basic listed amenities as well as loads of reading material to guide your visit to Seattle. All the instructions were very succinctly labeled around the bedroom. It really is a very comfortable place especially during the harsh windy winters of Seattle and we would definitely hit up the spot at our next visit to Seattle. "
1171574,25079145,2015-01-06,14750394,Aisha,Phils place was absolutely amazing. We were greeted with a welcome sign and often with sweets from Andreas bakery. The room was impeccable and very warm even in the cold Seattle freeze we had. The room was perfectly located just east of Capitol Hill which made seeing Seattle by bus or foot super easy. Very quiet room and neighborhood and ill definitely be back for my next staycation!
1171574,25555619,2015-01-19,25242633,Joanne,"Phil was in touch by email with great directions and cell phone numbers before our flight to Seattle.  He included a list and directions for businesses nearby.   Phil greeted us when we arrived and showed us all the details of where we'd be staying.  The apartment worked out perfectly for us - it is in a quiet neighborhood in a great area of Seattle.  There were little helpful notes and reminders on lamps, heaters, doors, etc., that were very useful.  The apartment was great for us and we'd hope to be able to stay there again the next time we visit Seattle! 
"
1171574,25791341,2015-01-26,6844775,Karina,"We love this place! The accommodations are very comfortable, have lots of character, very practical, and totally private. We got to meet Phil briefly and learn about his love for Seattle, and he and his partner were kind enough to leave delicious treats for us upon our arrival! I'd recommend this place to anyone especially given its convenience in the heart of Seattle."
1171574,26029394,2015-02-01,20979105,William,Amazing space! Great location. Delicious treats from the bakery! All in all it was a wonderful place to collect myself before moving into my new place. Highly recommend and would definitely stray again
1171574,26234144,2015-02-07,4487798,Alex,"Phil was a great host by letting me check in early since I had an AM arrival flight into Seattle. He also pointed me to his favorite breakfast spot, The Hi Spot. The room was like staying in a cabin in the city. The private entrance was also nice since it made it seem like my very own residence in Seattle. Will definitely be coming back again! "
1171574,26396378,2015-02-11,18900700,Nalleli,"The room was extremely cozy and lovely. It had just what we needed!  It was close enough to all the places we needed to go and walked everywhere. There is a delicious bakery around the corner from the house where we walked to every morning for breakfast. 

Phil was very attentive to us during our stay and was available for whatever we needed. 

 Lovely home you have Thanks for being a great host! "
1171574,26471981,2015-02-13,27444016,Kevin,"Even though I didn't get a chance to see the host (I only came back fairly late at night), Phil made me feel very welcome, with hand-written post-it notes scattered around the room that were quite helpful.

Neighborhood was quiet, suburban area. Was about an hour walk from Pike's Place, and actually it was quite nice to walk to downtown instead of taking the bus. The weather was quite good while we were there.

All in all, very satisfied."
1171574,26952676,2015-02-22,27689168,Pj,"My stay with Phil and Andrea was fantastic! I really enjoyed every minute. The room was wonderful, really felt like home. I actually found myself sad leaving. I highly suggest staying with them if you are in the area!"
1171574,27063599,2015-02-24,17530466,Erica,"We had a great time staying with Phil, it was clean and well appointed. We really enjoyed visiting this quaint area of Seattle which we had never been to before. We would definitely stay here again. "
1171574,27349615,2015-03-02,18772897,Kristi,"This was such a cool place to stay! It is located near so many things to do. Phil was a great host. The cookies from Andrea's caffe were so nice and we ended up going to get more! He showed such kindness and great communication. They have everything you could need, from kitchen utensils to bathroom amenities. We would definitely stay there again! Thank you!"
1171574,27655855,2015-03-09,26875127,Kristene,"Phil and Andrea were superb hosts! While my boyfriend and I did not have a chance to meet Phil in person, he perfectly communicated all we needed to know about the check-in process, the location of his home, and was available to answer any and all questions I had previous to showing up via email and text. Andrea welcomed us with a delicious treat from his cafe and suggested Thai for dinner - it was a block away and everything I wanted after a long drive with sore legs.
The room is very cozy and there are helpful notes scattered about regarding heat settings, utensils available, rules for recycling/composting and trash, etc. The entrance is extremely private, which was nice for coming and going throughout the day and night. The location is close to so much - it's a beautiful and quiet neighborhood near many cafes and restaurants, and you can be in downtown Seattle in less than 15 minutes by car. I felt very comfortable here.
This was my first time booking an Airbnb space and I am very happy with my choice and stay. Phil and Andrea, thank you again for welcoming Tyler and I into your home!"
1171574,27898994,2015-03-14,6966702,Sydney & Kellyn,"Felt right at home immediately upon arrival--the Sony was tuned to the world's greatest radio station, KEXP. You will not be disappointed here, the hosts are great and the amenities are exactly as described. Will definitely return to this cozy retreat in Madrona, Seattle's best neighborhood."
1171574,28082478,2015-03-17,14019662,Micaela,"This was my first Airbnb stay, and I have enjoyed every bit of it. The host was extremely informative before our stay (e.g., giving detailed directions, recommendations of local places). The place is just as described. The room was very cozy, with lots of character. Everything was functional and clean. It was listed that pets are not allowed, which is a plus since my travel-mate is allergic. 
Given this is my first Airbnb stay, I can't compare it with others. However, I'd say this is probably the most ideal way to introduce me to Airbnb. Compare to a hotel, there is a lot more personal touch :)

I was very satisfied with my stay, and will highly recommend this particular host (who has several Airbnb listings) to my friends. "
1171574,28214398,2015-03-20,27920042,Monique,"We had a wonderful time in Seattle.  Phil was a perfect host, met us upon our arrival, answered all my questions about the area and had some great tidbits of his own.  The location was very quiet and the bed was very comfy!!  We slept very well considering we were not in our own bed.  We were also able to park our car right out front of the house."
1171574,28316174,2015-03-22,26449145,Evan,"Great place, exactly where we needed it location wise. Everything we needed."
1171574,28481304,2015-03-24,28324346,Matthew,Experience was fantastic. Phil was so informative and courteous to prepare us for our arrival. Heater was on and little notes all around the room helped us get acclimated to the room. Even had a chocolate croissant in the fridge! Thanks Phil! 
1171574,28983196,2015-04-02,23256248,Kristen,"I stayed at Phil's for five nights and had a wonderful time. He and Andrea are so nice and hospitable, and their house is located in a beautiful historic neighborhood. The location ended up being super convenient without a car; it's about a minute's walk from two bus lines that will take you almost anywhere you'd want to go around Seattle. I made it to Ballard, Fremont, UW, Seattle Center, and downtown (as well as the airport) all on public transportation.

The bed was very comfortable (hellooooo memory foam!) and the room warmed up quickly with the space heaters Phil provided. I also loved the little family-owned bakery around the corner...I went there for coffee almost every morning!

One thing to note is that this listing is in a basement, so you can hear the ceiling squeaking and creaking as the owners walk around above you. This was not a huge issue, but I thought my fellow light sleepers out there should be aware.

All in all, I had a wonderful experience at Phil's and would 100% recommend staying here, especially if you are new to Seattle. Between the hospitality, the location, and the value, you can't beat this place. Thanks Phil and Andrea! :)"
1171574,29473563,2015-04-07,30551062,Frans En Floor,A great and very cosy place! Nice a and quit area near downtown. Plenty of dining options in walking distance.
1171574,29509679,2015-04-08,2772734,Shane,"I loved staying here! Phil was so accommodating of some last minute changes, and I couldn't be more grateful. The room itself was just what I was looking, and the neighborhood is fantastic! "

1171574,30603904,2015-04-25,4949081,Jenya,"We had a really great time staying here while in Seattle. The room was just as described and in a great location.

1171574,31512422,2015-05-06,28160213,Jacob,Phil was very hospitable; our needs were always met. The room is charming and the neighborhood was safe. A local bus stop was only one block down for easy access to downtown without driving. Thanks again Phil!

We were a quick drive from everything we wanted to visit in the downtown area. Plenty of street parking. Phil is knowledgable about the city and willing to always make a recommendation. I would highly recommend! "
1171574,31965369,2015-05-12,3760255,Davy,"We loved our stay at Phil's house, especially enjoyed the wonderful garden. Room was spacious and the private bathroom had a wonderful old fashioned claw tub. Phil was very friendly and helpful, and provided us with his favorite spots in lovely Madrona. The house was easy to reach through 3 different buslines coming from downtown. 
Highly recommended!"
1171574,32823152,2015-05-22,7465793,Erich And Maya,The place was clean and conveniently situated near many good restaurants and only a bus away from downtown. 
1171574,33900233,2015-06-02,7045583,Kay,"Phil is a very welcoming host! Apartement as shown, offers lots of privacy due to the seperate entrance/bathroom. Lots of tips (where to go shopping, how to get to city center, what to do) were gladly given. Takes about 15-20min to reach Seattle Center or Downtown with one of the two busses leaving next block."
1171574,34190437,2015-06-06,13460616,Cherie,"Such a great experience. The place is charming, very private&comfy.Minutes to several bus routes. Also easy to just navigate by foot--the neighborhood is very safe and fun.And Phil is such a gracious host. He is kind, helpful, always making sure I was having a good time during my stay. Phil is clearly a person who enjoys life and its a pleasure talking to him. Highly recommend to anyone visiting Seattle.  "
1171574,34526371,2015-06-09,12642565,Oliver,Phil and andrea were great. They welcomed us friendly and gave us some hints for our upcoming activities. The room was clean and towels were provided. They also have a nice backyard to relax. The bakery around the corner of the house was great too. I highly recommand phil and andrea.
1171574,34695740,2015-06-11,28872081,J,"Phil and Andrea were excellent hosts! Phil was excellent at communicating with us through the app, and greeted us upon our arrival. Phil gave great recommendations on local restaurants and activities. Canoeing at UW was one of our favorite parts of our trip, and we would have missed out without Phil. 
They also brought us delicious coffee cakes from a local bakery. 

The room was spacious, clean, and had plenty of rustic charm. We would definitely stay there again!"
1171574,35371217,2015-06-18,12554545,Danielle,"Phil was a wonderful host. He was warm and welcoming upon arrival and provided great suggestions for things to do/places to visit/bus routes, etc. He was available when needed, but also gave us as much privacy as we desired. We didn't have a chance to meet Andrea; however, we did get to enjoy some of her delicious pastries left outside our door :) The place was great too, exactly as described. In addition, there were so many nice things Phil thought to provide...things including the local events paper waiting upon arrival, a cloth bag to use for any shopping trips, speakers for hookup to device, etc. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay here and heartily recommend it to anyone passing through Seattle."
1171574,35566999,2015-06-20,33082891,Jason,A real great introduction to airbnb.  The room is well-furnished and you have all the privacy you need.  Phil has loads of information for guests that is quite useful.  Thanks.
1171574,36502047,2015-06-29,25823421,Satayu,"The host was very kind and helpful. Even before my arrival, I received useful emails and instructions. He was also helpful when it came to answering my questions and concerns.

The room is a basement with an ensuite, but the tub is a bit small for larger and taller people. 

I was concerned about the lack of air conditioning, but the host assured me that it would not be necessary. He was right because the room was nice and cool at night and I had no trouble sleeping.

The host also provided many amenities in the bathroom and in the room as well as instructions on how to use everything. He also had free instant coffee and tea. He has notes stuck everywhere. "
1171574,36763470,2015-07-01,28877184,Katharina,"Dank den Vorabinformationen von Phil hatten wir keine Schwierigkeiten die Unterkunft zu finden. Phil hat uns persönlich sehr zuvorkommend begrüßt. Die selbst gemachten Willkommens-Plätzchen waren sehr lecker. Alle Fragen wurden direkt beantwortet und Sightseeing Tipps gegeben. Die schöne Unterkunft entsprach voll unseren Erwartungen. Das Haus liegt in einem sehr grünen, urigen Wohnviertel. Downtown Seattle kann gut in 35 Min. zu Fuß erreicht werden. Die Gastgeber waren ausgesprochen freundliche und unkompliziert. Wir würden jederzeit wieder kommen."
1171574,37057893,2015-07-04,33296760,Andrea,"Phil made us feel very welcome with his little notes and kind treats.

1171574,38376603,2015-07-15,5521882,Nicole,"Our stay with Phil and Andrea was fantastic! When we arrived, Phil was there to greet us and offer some great suggestions for food and local beer. Our room was spotless, and had all of the amenities we could possibly need. We were in and out of the house a lot over our 2 day stay, so the private entrance was very convenient since we didn't have disturb our hosts at late hours. We were impressed at how spacious the room and it's adjoining bathroom were, and very happy with our stay overall. Andrea even left us some treats from her bakery for breakfast! We felt very welcome in Seattle, and hope to get back some time soon."
1171574,38692279,2015-07-18,15772495,Lander,"Really enjoyed our stay here. Nice cool room, your own bathroom. Phil gave the best tips for the neighbourhood. Close to the lake, but you can also easily take the bus downtown. Recommend!"
1171574,39150718,2015-07-21,29998389,Oliver,"Grosszügiges, sauberes Zimmer mit eigenem Badezimmer und separatem Eingang. Ruhige Umgebung und doch erreicht man das Zentrum in nur 15 - 20 Minuten Busfahrt. Die Bushaltestelle ist nur 2 Minuten vom Haus entfernt. Geeignet für kurze sowie lange Aufenthalte. Sehr freundliche Gastgeber. Man erhält viele Tipps und Informationen. Auf Verlangen haben wir eine sehr genaue Wegbeschreibung vom Flughafen zum B&B erhalten. Im Zimmer waren dann noch weitere Informationen zu Busverbindungen, Ausflugstipps sowie Stadtplänen vorhanden. "
1171574,39528488,2015-07-24,37092003,Trenton,"First time ever using airbnb and what an experience for my first.  Phil is amazing, knowledgable, the area is great.  You can make it to downtown on the number 8 super easy!  The space is nice, relaxing, very private, and this neighborhood was one of my favorites, diverse and close to everything.  I would recommend this place to anyone visiting Seattle!!!"
1171574,39811699,2015-07-26,14566459,Matt,A great little suite located walking distance to Capitol Hill's wonderful shops and restaurants. Phil was very friendly and quickly responded to our messages. Highly recommend.
1171574,40126234,2015-07-28,36178203,Jared,Loved staying here! Picked it since there were so many good reviews and it lived up to ratings. Phil was great as he was very prompt with his messaging and sent a map of nearby restaurants and attractions. There was also fresh pastries for us when we arrived which was awesome! Great location as well as everything was very accessible but still in a smaller neighborhood which was nice. All in all great place to stay.
1171574,40341699,2015-07-30,33926071,John,"We really enjoyed our stay. Everything was as described or better. Phil met us on arrival and all the amenities (wi-fi (which was speedy), refrigerator, etc.) were thoroughly explained. He provided helpful hints on both the immediate neighborhood and downtown Seattle, which was very close. We enjoyed the treats from Andrea's bakery on the morning we left. The neighborhood was great- we loved the neighborhood with all the old Craftsmen houses, including Phil and Andrea's and the fact that it is within walking distance of Lake Washington, where we also spent some time. We unreservedly recommend this for your stay in Seattle as the price is very reasonable, the proximity to downtown is great, and it was nice to explore one of Seattle older neighborhoods."
1171574,41057433,2015-08-04,15577905,John,"Phil,
Thanks for your hospitality. Your place worked really well for us. The privacy and ability to come and go, while still feeling welcome and well provided for were great. Your directions and tips were spot on and really helped us navigate our way around. I will recommend your place  highly to any friends or family  visiting Seattle, and hopefully we can join you again on our next visit since I am now highly invested in Katie and Evan.
We arrived back in Louisville last night. Lots of bikers on the road.
We had a great trip returning along the Oregon Trail. I highly recommend this book by Rinker Buck ""the Oregon Trail:  a New American Journey.""  Thanks again for helping make our visit a wonderful experience.

1171574,41574882,2015-08-08,26116907,Paul,"Phil was a great host who had made every effort to make our stay enjoyable. We only had a short visit so took his advice and ticked off all the activities he suggested - having a great time in the process. Phil's place is perfectly located with downtown and lake Washington within easy reach. 

Would definitely stay again. Be sure to visit Andreas bakery for some tasty treats."
1171574,41929012,2015-08-10,31152755,Joanna,"Phil was great! We loved the location and the room. We had everything we needed with a private entrance, bathroom, mini fridge, and microwave. The bed was more comfortable than it looked and we enjoyed being right next to a woodsy park. "
1171574,42456478,2015-08-13,737957,Kim,Phil's place was a perfect spot for me and my daughter to explore Seattle. With it's separate entrance and amenities we felt like locals. Phil was very nice and helpful and Andrea gave us some delicious pastries. I would definitely stay here again! 
1171574,42825548,2015-08-16,30873930,Jonathan,"Phil's place was perfect: clean, considerate, and quiet. Cute notes left everywhere help guide the guest and feel right at home as one gains a sense of the personality of the host. Location is great, too. The best Airbnb of our trip by far."

1171574,52052187,2015-10-26,35586947,Yvonne,The listing was described perfectly. The space was warm and accommodating. We definitely felt at home. We were able to use public transportation during our stay and really get to see Seattle. Phil was very friendly and was able to answer any questions we had about touring the city.

Their listing was exactly like they said, and I've never had the wonderful pastries available like they provided, at any hotel I've ever stayed.  The neighborhood was most convenient for access to Lake Washington, as well as Downtown and Capitol Hill.  It was a very green area, and a terrific place to stay."
1171574,53229721,2015-11-06,12133535,Myray,"There was a pastry waiting for me on my first night which was delicious. The place was clean and welcoming. Although I never met him in person Phil was easy to communicate with and available over messages. 

The only thing I wasn't expecting was, being in the basement of an old house, I was woken up every morning to the sound of footsteps above me. I don't think there is anything Phil could do about this but would have been good to know going into it. I still think his place is a good value. If you are looking for a clean and private place to stay for a good price this is a great option. "
1171574,53816697,2015-11-13,45337578,Douglas,"Phil and Andrea were awesome hosts! Lots of great advice on what to check out in the area, and the pastries from Andrea's bakery were amazing. Really cool place to stay at, and loved the claw foot tub. Wished we could have stayed longer in Seattle, lots of cool stuff to see in so little time. Thanks for the awesome stay guys, can't wait to be back, loved the neighbourhood and everything!"
1171574,54307961,2015-11-18,38189081,Toni,Huge thank you to Phil and Andrea for their hospitality. I briefly got to chat with both of them. They are delightful and welcoming people.

He provided us with everything we might need (microwave, electric kettle, heater, knife, spoons, forks, plates, cups, etc.) Even a mini fridge! I am so glad I chose this spot! It was easy and quick to get to  downtown from here and I love the fact that it has a private entry. Lovely wood paneling and colorfully decorated room. Hope to come back and visit again!"

The location was fantastic (right by the Space Needle) and an easy monorail trip to the middle of Seattle. There are many great restaurants within easy walking distance of her place and the neighborhood is pretty quiet. Kasia is wonderful and energetic and the location is great so this is definitely the place to stay if your travels take you to Seattle."
7809595,45707491,2015-09-05,40439200,Nick,"Kasia was a phenomenal host! Prior to our stay, she was extremely responsive and was in constant communication with us to ensure that we got into her apartment okay. She welcomed us with a very clean and organized apartment, which matched the description on the site. Her place is SO close to the space needle, and we were able to walk everywhere we wanted to (downtown, Pike Place Market, Space Needle, EMP Museum) with ease. Kasia was very friendly, and we were fortunate to be able to spend time with her and have lunch at the Space Needle with her. I highly recommend Kasia's apartment to anyone visiting Seattle - and I would stay here again in a heartbeat!"
7809595,45868955,2015-09-06,32750118,Amy,"Kasia was very welcoming, made sure I was comfortable, and has a great home."
7809595,46779573,2015-09-13,6155629,Jonathan,"Yes, just as described. Even better: I think actually (if my memory's correct) she said she only offered a mattress on the floor, but she actually provides a very comfortable bed."
7809595,47096171,2015-09-15,42925328,Matthias,"We had a really good stay at Kasias place. She is very welcoming and tries to make your stay as comfortable as it can get. I can highly recommand to stay there. Car parking is some kind of tricky, but within 5min walk you can find a lot for you car (free)."
7809595,47511919,2015-09-19,42625829,Megan,"Everything was great! Kasia was super friendly and accommodating in letting us keep our bags at her place when she had new guests coming the day we left. The apartment itself is really nice and a good location! Close to buses and also walkable to the Space Needle, or even downtown if you're ambitious. "
7809595,47825413,2015-09-21,21408983,Carolyn,Kasia was a wonderful host for me and my boyfriend when we visited Seattle. She was very flexible with our check in/out time. Her place was in a very convenient location to hit up a bunch of the touristy spots. 
7809595,48337708,2015-09-25,44257278,Michela,I had a great time staying here. Kasia is a friendly host and the location is also nice and pretty close to the space needle. I would certainly look to stay here again if I find myself in this city in the future.
7809595,48583019,2015-09-27,3091468,Ada,"Kasia is really great and lovely person. She is so nice, friendly and helpful. Her apartment was a brilliant place to stay- cosy, nice decorated,  in a nice and calm neighbourhood with plenty places to eat and so near to space needle!
"
7809595,48796235,2015-09-28,28137475,Tilek,Kasia is a really nice and a great host who was not just friendly to host you but also to help you explore around 
7809595,49635310,2015-10-05,42625185,Kristin,"Kasia was a lovely host. She was extremely helpful and so welcoming. Her place was easy to find and on the ground floor making it convenient for us to wheel our luggage in. 

This is a great neighborhood to stay in, it's pretty quaint and very pedestrian friendly.  We didn't rent a car and Kasia helped us with directions to get to/from her place. (We bought a city pass) Everything was very nearby and within walking distance. Kasia was so great to chat with and such a sweetheart. She let us use everything in the kitchen and even let us borrow some Tupperware! We would stay here again. 
"
7809595,50495571,2015-10-12,14418833,Maxence,We really liked our at Kasia's apartment. It's a lovely place very close to everything especially the Space Needle and such a nice view on the skyline. It was really convenient and Kasia was really helpful and available when needed. You cannot go wrong by staying at hers.
7809595,51555196,2015-10-21,15980054,Beatrice,"Kasia's place was perfect for my short stay.  The Queen Anne neighborhood was very close and  the variety of restaurants available was incredible.  Kasia's place was super neat and clean.  She was very considerate and quiet when she came home late after work.  Her neighborhood was also quiet and peaceful.

I would recommend Kasia and her place.
"
7809595,52179803,2015-10-26,36646040,Nico,"Kasia is a nice, opened person who made my weekend trip to Seattle perfect. Very clean, tidied up appartment with a nice two beded sleeping room. Communication was very good and fast."
7809595,52455003,2015-10-29,44281316,Mary Sue,"I spent two amazing days in Seattle, largely due to how great Kasia is and also how splendid her place is. The second day was a beautiful sunny Seattle day, which I started first thing in the morning at the Space Needle, located right by Kasia's place, easily swept through all the tourist places to visit (Pikes Place, Pioneer Square, etc.), only to return to the Space Needle at the end of the day. Kasia recommended the ferry to Bainbridge island, which was a blast!
From Kasia's place, you get the whole Seattle skyline, especially if you continue up the hill into the wealthier streets AND immediate access to the city.

The rooms are clean, spacious and decorative.
Kasia is very professional, nice and is a gem host."
7809595,52887097,2015-11-02,46500652,Sam,This was our first experience with airbnb and I have to say it was awesome. Kasia is an excellent host and does a great job communicating and making your stay fun and comfortable. This is a great location. Close to everything but still out enough to enjoy the views of the city. The apartment is very clean and has all you need to enjoy your time in Seattle.  
7809595,53760278,2015-11-12,42650437,Jenny,"What do you expect in Seattle? A cozy and comfortable trip? So Kasia 's house the best place for you to stay. 
is only 10minutes walk to the famous Space Needle and Chihuli glass and garden and music experience museum. Actually you can see the Space needle from your room window. 
There is also a super good market called QFC near by. You can buy everything you want there. 
The house is clean and cozy. And kind of romantic. Kasia decorates with beautiful small things such pictures and flowers. She gave me a purple rose as welcome gift. So sweet! The bedroom has comfortable bed and sofa and a carpet where you can sit on the floor. The electronic heat makes the room warm so you don't need to worry about the winter days. 
The house located in Low Queen Anne this is a quiet and fairy tale world feeling neighborhood with brown yellow re and green trees!!!

I highly recommend Kasia's house for you accommodation in Seattle. She is a sweetheart. I like her and wish her all the best. Thanks Kasia!!"
7809595,54261855,2015-11-17,46763052,Bryan,Great location in walking distance of great food and coffee. Nice house and comfortable bed. Kasia was a great host. 
7809595,54825091,2015-11-23,8177765,Juan,"Kasia´s place has a very good location, walking distance to restaurants, supermarket, Space Needled, Monorail and Pike Market if you want go further.

It didn´t take me long to feel myself very comfortable, since the place is nice and Kasia was kind on guide me with information about the city.
"
7809595,55074322,2015-11-27,48890574,Haidee,"Kasha is super lovely and very hospitable. Great location, everything is within walking proximity. Definitely recommended!"
7809595,55397730,2015-12-01,42320964,Ning,"This is my first time using airbnb and I donˊt know how to express my thanks to Kasia. Sheˊs been so helpful during my trip in Seattle and she helped me solve a troublesome problem caused by a change in my schedule with great patience. I would highly recommend her place to all of you, not only because it is super close(within walkˊs distance) to all the places of interest in Seattle, but also because she is such a nice person. She made sure that we can be comfortable in her house and she herself is really quiet when sheˊs home, most of the time reading on the sofa. She put some beautiful roses in our room, which meant a lot to us after a long dayˊs trip. Thanks again Kasia!!"
7809595,55693467,2015-12-04,29994962,Kelsey,"Kasia is a great hostess, and her home/location was perfect for my stay in Seattle! She provided great suggestions for nearby restaurants and her place is adorned very comfortably. I would definitely recommend, and would stay again!"
7809595,56162900,2015-12-09,49822697,Carla,"Kasia was a great host.  She  was very welcoming.  The room we were in was really nice and had a lot of space.  The closet was empty so it was great for hanging our big jackets after walking in the rain.  The neighborhood is really beautiful.  Definitely less than a 5 min walk to the Space Needle, and a very pleasant 20 min walk to downtown Seattle.  My fiance and I had a very pleasant stay.  The room has its own heater and everything was clean.  Kasia even had fresh flowers in the room.  She was very sweet and easy to talk to.   Thank you Kasia!!!  "
7809595,56322478,2015-12-12,49583649,Kara,"I had a nice stay with Kasha. The apartment is close to key arena and easy to find. The room and the bed were both bigger than I expected.
Kasha was very friendly and helpful. Also was kind enough to find me an extra blanket, as I get cold easily."
7809595,56620518,2015-12-15,37984197,Joyce,"Kasia's place is really convenient, only ~10 mins walk to the Space Needle. There are many nice eateries nearby so it's perfect for our holiday without renting a car. Kasia is super friendly and her place is v clean and comfy - highly recommended to anyone who are planning to visit Seattle!!!"
9216874,53159225,2015-11-05,31157129,Kathleen,"What a great spot! My partner and I loved every moment of our stay here. The pictures don't lie (in fact, they don't do the place justice!) -  the space is clean, modern, and fully updated, but still feels warm and inviting. The on-site parking was such a treat, and allowed us to pull up and settle in right away. We spent the afternoon exploring the shops, bars, and cafes in Capitol Hill - which was an easy walk from the house - and were lucky enough to have clear weather to spend some time enjoying the fenced in backyard. Though we didn't cook while we were there (can't pass up Seattle's restaurant scene!), the kitchen was beautiful and stocked with all the basics (spices, etc) - next time we'll just have to stay longer!

We only communicated remotely, but Meg (a native Seattleite) was responsive and very helpful in all of our communications. She gave us some great recommendations for restaurants nearby, and provided clear walking directions to get downtown.

If you're looking for the best of both worlds - easy access to the bustling heart of Seattle, and a comfortable, quiet home to retreat to - this is the spot for you! We'll be back!"
9216874,55492114,2015-12-01,41152957,Greg,Meg's place is exactly what she stated. Very clean and new and nice. We had a great time and had a great sleep. We loved that it was right in the middle of the city and easy to get around. Would love to come again. 
1815472,9335143,2013-12-22,10138477,Alexandria,"My stay with Darcy was pleasant. The positives of the stay was the full kitchen provided, the location to Pike Place and downtown Seattle, and the security of the apartment overall. The only downside I had with my stay was with the difficultly of getting ahold of Darcy to retrieve the keys and general questions about the apartment. "
1815472,9876309,2014-01-16,7551023,Hannah,"Darcy's apartment is in a very good location, within walking distance to many sites and neighborhoods in Seattle. Darcy was a generous host, and we didn't have any noise complaints with the bar downstairs, though we stayed in the apartment during the week. Overall, a very cute apartment that provided a great jumping-off point for exploring Seattle! "
1815472,9921491,2014-01-19,18091,Sharon,"The room was just what we were looking for, a reasonably priced room in a fun part of Seattle where we could walk to dinner and entertainment. The room was clean and comfortable and had some charm as well. The room is small, barely accommodating the bed ,even with one side against the wall, but we were hardly there enough to care. Darcy and her crew at the restaurant are really nice and helpful. Yes, like others have said, it was noisy, but we were up for a break from country quiet, so that was OK."
1815472,9933672,2014-01-20,10934884,Sarah,Darcy was amazing and so was the room. 
1815472,10079070,2014-01-29,9707191,Don And Jackie,"Everything we needed, and in a great location. Any complaints about the homelessness/ safety should be directed towards the city of Seattle, not this apartment. It is certainly rampant, and not necessarily confined to several areas (think San Francisco/ LA). Wifi was spotty"
1815472,10179740,2014-02-04,11135714,Jenifer,"My boyfriend and I went to Seattle for a show in the international district and to watch the Super Bowl and the location of this place was perfect! Right in pioneer square it was walking distance to a lot of fun places and really awesome bars, in fact right down stairs is the oldest saloon in Seattle, so fun! Darcy the landlady is super helpful and flexible with check in and out times, the internet is pretty spotty so if you're relying on that maybe speak to Darcy first. "
1815472,10507494,2014-02-22,5175012,Lena,"Darcy has flexible check-in and check-out times, which was great and worked amazingly with my hectic schedule. Great central location and easy to access public transportation as well as the train station, but also located on top of a bar and club - the club is very very noisy and you can hear noise from the street very easily so slight warning for those who cannot fall asleep well or wake easily.

Small room in an old building but had all the necessities and had a comfortable one-night stay. Very reasonable, especially when comparing to hotels in the area who seemed to offer way worse accommodations for a much higher asking price! If I need a place to crash in Seattle again, I would definitely come back!"
1815472,11178798,2014-03-24,12007893,Matt,"This is a lovely space.  Unfortunately it's above a bar that closes at 2am on Friday and Saturday, and next door to a nightclub that closes at 2:30am on Friday and Saturday.  Also, the neighbors in the building are loud laughers and TV watchers.  Friday night they were watching TV until 4:30am.  I thought they'd turn it off at some point.  Instead they started a movie at 2 in the morning.  It was the movie Catch Me If You Can.  I could tell because the walls are paper thin and I could hear everything like it was an old-timey radio show.  So if you enjoy sleep and plan on being in Seattle over the weekend, find somewhere else.

When I came back late Saturday night, the keypad to let me in the building was broken--didn't work at all.  Luckily there were still some employees of the bar hanging out inside, and after banging on the door and explaining through hand gestures that I was trying to get upstairs, they were able to call someone to come over and unlock the door.  If they hadn't been there, I might have had to sleep on a park bench, with one of the dozens of homeless people all over this neighborhood.

Don't stay here, unless you go to bed at 4 in the morning.  But at that point, the garbage trucks and leaf blowers outside start up, and the homeless people start yelling at each other, and the seagulls start screaming at each other, and the homeless people scream at the seagulls, and the seagulls scream at the homeless people."
1815472,11401425,2014-04-01,12210446,Zackaryah,"This location was a great place, easy to find and located just a block from the Pioneer Square light link station and walking distance to Pike's Place and most other attractions. Darcy was a great host and everything was great with no problems checking in and helped us with anything we needed, I would definitely stay here again should I go back to Seattle. Neighborhood was also great with everything we needed to make our stay (email hidden)anks Darcy!!!"
1815472,11503225,2014-04-05,1151473,Jorgen,"Darcy and her space offered a wonderful and truly unique experience for us in Seattle!! She went above and beyond to accomodate us, very last minute. The unit sits above the Merchants Cafe, Seattle's oldest running bar and restaurant. TOO COOL. We took the light rail train from the airport to the Pioneer Square stop and were blown away when we learned the property was only a block or two away. It was SO convenience. And then to top it all off, we were able to connect on (email hidden) below, which was PERFECT as I believe anyone enjoys a good beer or drink after a long day of travel. At least, we did :) We enjoyed a pint and some bites before seeing our room, which turned out to be quaint studio apartment RICH WITH CHARACTER. We will stay here again next time we visit Seattle, for sure. 

For those past guests who have made negative comments related to the area's homelessness populations and nearby nightclubs, DON'T STAY DOWNTOWN SEATTLE IF YOU CAN'T HANDLE THESE COMMON URBAN CONDITIONS. If you were to stay in my space downtown Denver you would have to deal with the same.....and I'm sure that goes for many of America's great cities and their downtowns. 

Overall, Darcy and her space made our short trip in Seattle what it was and we cannot thank her enough!!!

"
1815472,11704650,2014-04-12,6838330,Anthony,Thank you so much for the hospitality. Loved the decor of the home. Also it is in a great neighborhood. A lot of street parking. Pretty close to downtown Seattle and the university. Thanks a bunch. Hope to stay again.
1815472,11998451,2014-04-21,12796141,Anne,Darcy is a very friendly host with an amazing spot right above the very cool wine bar The Merchant.  I enjoyed Seattle thoroughly thanks to the great hospitality given to me by Darcy. Thank you!
1815472,13016327,2014-05-17,13269361,Keidra,Darcy was a great host.  She was pleasant and full of information. The room was very nice with a view of the square. The Merchant Cafe' is just downstairs with good food and a great atmosphere  It is walking distance from almost anything. If you are coming from the airport it is just a light rail ride away with only a short walk from the Pioneer Square stop. I had a wonderful visit. 
1815472,13052048,2014-05-18,15263462,Brian,"Check-in and check-out times are flexible and the process went extremely smooth.  The studio was well decorated and clean.  It's location is amazing.  Walking distance to Amtrak, CenturyLink and Safeco fields, Pioneer Square and the Waterfront markets.  It is in the oldest restaurant/bar still operating in the same location on the West Coast and that gives the place a special feel.  And if you want food and drinks, just walk downstairs.  An awesome place that is on our list to stay again. "
1815472,13787232,2014-06-04,14189309,Donna,"Such a perfect spot for a newcomer to Seattle! Right in the heart of everything, but not quite in the hustle and bustle. I didn't get to meet Darcy, but she was very prompt and courteous with her messages, so there wasn't any confusion at all. We checked in with Tony, the bartender at Merchant's Cafe below the apartment, and he was very friendly and helpful with everything, from the room to the beer and the local attractions. The apartment is only a (downwards sloping!) block from the Pioneer Square lightrail station, and a short walk to the piers, or stadium. The Space Needle is a bit of a hike but not by much, and Pike Market is pretty close as well. If you are looking for the perfect place to stay and explore the city, with everything at your fingertips, this is the place to go! "
1815472,14141714,2014-06-12,5349405,Mustapha,The host was wonderful and very accommodating. Look forward to my time there again soon.
1815472,14730690,2014-06-25,12873716,Gwen,"Perfect little studio! AMAZING location! Very clean. The bed was super comfortable. We loved that the decor was new, but that it was styled in a vintage fashion to go along with the history of the building and the area.  We were in town for the games and were able to walk to the stadium. It was also super convenient when we got back to have a drink downstairs at Darcy's restaurant/bar.  They even reopened the kitchen for some spectacular food for us.  My only comments would be to plan to park in the garage across the street ($28 for 24 hours), and you must be okay with the street noise (you are in the middle of downtown-it's LOUD)."
1815472,14936221,2014-06-29,17048145,Krisha,"This was my first time using Airbnb, and I will gladly do it again, thanks to my great experience with booking this lovely room and working with Darcy.  She was prompt, welcoming and easy to work with.  The room was exactly as it's presented in it's photos.  The staff who (email hidden) were just as kind as Darcy, and made the entire stay that much better.  The next time I go to Seattle, I will definitely want to book this room again."
1815472,15187292,2014-07-04,6864663,Katie,Wonderful location!!!! We  weren't in the apartment too much but it was about a half mile away from pikes and right next to a bus stop that takes you to the space needle. I would definitely recommend this place to friends and family! 
1815472,15403990,2014-07-08,13621919,Makayla,"The apartment was a sweet spot. It was nice to have a kitchen and bathroom - even a washer and dryer! Darcy was incredibly kind and accommodating. REALLY GREAT! I do wish that the windows had screens so that we could've had them open and been safe from lots of bugs flying in. There was a fan, but no a/c, so the fresh air was welcome. The place is in a very very central and also very gritty part of town. It was awesome to be close to pike and the waterfront, but it didn't feel quite as private as we were hoping for. With those big wonderful windows on the 2nd story we felt close to the street, and it's a busy and really ""real"" part of downtown. Great for being a tourist in downtown, not ideal for a super private romantic getaway. "
1815472,16299716,2014-07-25,11907114,Jeff,Darcy was an excellent host and the place was perfect for my 2 night midweek stay.  Everything I needed was supplied and I had a great time in the pioneer square area.  Would definitely stay here again in the future.
1815472,16636165,2014-07-30,15868574,Katie,"Darcy's studio apartment rental is above her historic tavern. It's very comfortable and charming, but simple. The vaulted ceiling, big windows, and brick walls make it feel spacious. The ceiling fan cooled off the room quickly! Great new, clean bathroom, clothes washer and dryer. I would only change the bathroom door, it doesn't provide much privacy. The location is amazing for tourism, it's right in the center of Pioneer Square. Darcy seemed nice though she and her staff at the cafe weren't overly attentive. The wifi did not work. We had a nice time, a classic bed and breakfast experience- without the breakfast."
1815472,18621217,2014-08-29,8513240,Karen,Darcy was very warm and welcoming and made us feel very welcomed! The space was  just as the photos show. We rented the space to go to a football game and it was perfect! 3 blocks! And my husband was is heaven since it was above a bar! Very cool historic place! Would recommend it to anyone ! 
1815472,19588157,2014-09-15,14928724,Danielle,"Quick check in, everything was very clean and organized. Anything that we needed, we could get. "
1815472,19999822,2014-09-22,14660896,Tara,"While we didn't meet the host directly, Darcy was easy to get ahold of through Airbnb. Her directions were clear as to where to pick up keys, etc. The people in the Merchant Cafe/Bar were nice. Quaint room with all the amenities one needs for few days in Seattle. The plus of staying at this Pioneer Street location is its location, no doubt. It was easy to walk anywhere and everywhere, especially the stadium. Recommend bringing headsets or ear plugs, should you stay over the weekend when street noise extends to 2am."
1815472,20540235,2014-09-30,21812592,Jessica,"Upon arrival, I was held back about an hour before I was given access to my room due to the housekeeper still cleaning; it wasn't a major deal, but it was a bit upsetting. The apartment is clean, tidy, and described exactly like the listing. It's situated in a historical part of town which is great for a history lover and it's only about a 10-15 minutes walk to the Pike Place Market and the Downtown Retail Core. Also, close to the transit system which is convenient for anyone arriving from the airport, Amtrak or Greyhound. It was relatively quiet at night time too (weekdays), not much going on in the neighbourhood after about ~8PM. The wifi is pretty much non existent in the apartment but you got a Starbucks just two doors down. 

Overall, as a one night stay, it was affordable and relatively close to everything I wanted to see/do in town. Despite the wifi issues, I would recommend this place again! "
1815472,22430979,2014-11-06,20611859,Leah,"We didn't meet Darcy but those we did meet were very friendly and accommodating. The place was exactly as it appears. Gorgeous! The location was great for getting where we needed to, only a bit of street noise but barely disturbed us. Picking up and dropping off the keys was so easy, it reduced a of stress knowing we had some flexibility."
1815472,23267762,2014-11-27,22424592,Sandrine,"A very good appartment in a really good place of Seattle : pionner square. Everything is near this appartement : Subway, Starbuck, supermarket and parking. And the bar the Merchants, of course!!
The appartement is cute and practice. If you have a very light sleeper, take earplug but it's ok for the others. "
1815472,24078151,2014-12-19,260214,Christalyn,"I am not usually so negative, but this was one of my worst travel experiences. The studio was not clean, there was hair all over the wall in the bathroom, towels and rugs were dingy, and the wifi didn't work. The walls were paper thin, and I could hear everything that happened in the next room. There also isn't a real door to the bathroom, so there is no real privacy if you aren't traveling by yourself. The live music kept me up until 2am, which was my own fault for not reading thoroughly that Thursdays were included as a weekend night. 

However, the staff was extremely nice!! I think it would be a fine place to stay for a night but not for an extended period of time. "
1815472,24257086,2014-12-23,15857330,Olivia,"A beautiful room, just as the pictures look. The location is a quick walk from down town, with lots of shops close by. Along with a cute bar below. The process was easy to get set up & sign out."
1815472,24564791,2014-12-30,8521008,Josha,"Though the apartment had not been cleaned when we arrived, the bar staff kindly sorted everything out and gave us free drinks while we waited. An interesting perch above Pioneer Square."
1815472,24615658,2014-12-31,24879506,Gina,"Upon arrival, we were greeted by a very nice bartender with an awesome haircut who promptly showed us the room.  Unfortunately, the room was not clean.  She and Darcy handled it immediately by upgrading us to a bigger room and gave us a free dinner and drinks!  Things happen, but we were very pleasantly surprised by how well the situation was handled.  The room was beautiful and clean.  The food was good and the drinks were well made.  Overall a great experience! "
1815472,25241531,2015-01-10,2980527,Matthew,"The studio over Merchants Cafe was a perfect little escape in the old part of Seattle. The room was tiny but full of everything you would need for a warm stay. 

The noise issues with the club wasn't too bad, definitely heard it but nothing that made it hard to fall asleep. As others have said, the WiFi was abysmal. 

I would stay here if I was looking for a place in a easily walkable part of the city with plenty of cafes, restaurants and museums within a 20 min walk. "
1815472,25405825,2015-01-15,8713857,Caroline,"Darcy was a very welcoming and responsive host. If you want an authentic experience in an historic part of Seattle, I'd highly recommend her Pioneer Square apartments. "
1815472,25721773,2015-01-24,15981416,Marcel,FANTASTIC location! Darcy is extremely thoughtful and provides a high quality and professionally up kept place to stay! Cafe staff are super nice too :) 
1815472,26536137,2015-02-15,3978694,Ryan,"Hello,
We were greeted by the bartender who let us leave our bags until check in time. The place was perfect for how long we stayed. It is located conveniently to downtown and the harbor. It was noisy at night but we were prepared with some ear plugs. Thanks for the stay.
Ryan and Carly Crewe"
1815472,26592935,2015-02-16,6999814,Curtis,Our stay was brief but Darcy was a very accommodating host. The place was well heated for the chilly winter stay and in the heart of downtown. Hard to find a better spot for the price!
1815472,27980404,2015-03-15,13302829,David Cameron,"What a dynamic experience this studio added to our weekend getaway to Seattle! Location, location, location. Situated above the storied Merchants Cafe, the bar was alive with Sounders fans when we approached the swamped staff about our room. One bartender quickly (and wonderfully) stepped aside to show us our studio overlooking Pioneer Square. The city was alive. Clean, flat screen, spacious. We couldn't ask for more. Only suggestion is to have ear plugs available for guests due to the noise of patrons frequently the next door bar. 

*On the final note, my partner and I experienced something a little paranormal around 2:25A. Nothing malevolent, but surely another energy of Seattle's historic center passing by to say hello. 

Look forward to staying again!"
1815472,28731425,2015-03-29,28883874,Lacey,"Great location! It was only a 7 min walk from Bolt Bus and about 10-15 min walk to Pike's Place Market. Beautiful old building, definitely has character. Staff was friendly and quick to help when needed. Would stay here again. "
1815472,30434542,2015-04-21,16577453,Stefan,"Well-furnished and aesthetically-pleasing studio. The bar downstairs is a nice touch, and the bartender who showed us the room was quite friendly. I only stayed for a night, but this listing is comfortable enough to be more than fitting for a longer vacation."
1815472,30628536,2015-04-25,1654547,Dara,"This apartment was clean and tidy with a very comfortable and warm bed. As mentioned in previous reviews there is a bar downstairs which plays loud music until around 1am but we were prepared for this. The Internet was practically non existent, this had also been mentioned previously in other reviews but unfortunately was very accurate. The location was central to everything but somewhat on the sketchy side. There was a washer and dryer in the room which was a bonus however the washer door handle was broken and made for very difficult opening and closing. All in all the space was plenty big enough for us and I would recommend it to other travelers."
1815472,33477045,2015-05-28,33938585,Sean,This was a nice stay I love the easy access to downtown and Century link I was bummed out on the WiFi It could have been my computer but I couldnt connect and I tried for quite a while. Not sure what the deal was there but all in all it was great I will come back.
1815472,33689938,2015-05-31,338919,Charles,"The location is good, one block from the rail station to the airport. Close to nice bars and restaurants. It is a very cozy bedroom with kitchen. "
1815472,34464830,2015-06-08,8453260,Adam,"My wife and I had a late flight into Seattle and Darcy was more than accommodating. She was quick to respond to any questions we had and everyone at the cafe was very helpful. The space was comfortable and had tons of character and was a close walk to everything. When back in Seattle, we will definitely stay again!"
1815472,36098900,2015-06-25,3045568,Anna,"The apartment was in a good location, so we could walk everywhere. It was cozy and we enjoyed our 2 nights there! 

The wifi didn't really work properly, it kept going off and on (mostly off). And also we would have liked to use the washing machine, but the door handle was broken so we couldn't open it.

All in all, this was a good experience for our short stay in Seattle."
1815472,40247323,2015-07-29,36475004,Denise,"This is a nice little place in a busy part of town- lots of tourists and homeless people. I stayed on a Tuesday and it was still loud on the street late at night. If you are a light sleeper, it might not be the place for you. I would recommend parking your car at the 1st and Cherry garage. "
1815472,42167202,2015-08-11,38071743,Nisha,"Darcy is amazing - I was so appreciative of her super quick response rate! And also her customer service was great. On arrival, because of the hot weather, there were a few flies in the room; she got the bar to send over bug spray right away and I was thankful it all happened really quickly. The apartment is in a great location, it was clean and it was a comfy bed! I didn't experience any of the loud noise mentioned in the other reviews, but I stayed on a Monday night. The apt does get hot and there are fans, but that can get quite loud. The dryer was also on when I arrived and seemed to go on forever, so every now and again, there was noise from there throughout the night. Overall, for the location, it's good - I could take walks to Space Needle and to Pike Place Market, really easily. It's also only a 5-10 minute walk from Seattle amtrak station. Good for if you're on a flying visit for a night or two. "
1815472,43979990,2015-08-23,7322603,Tegar,"I had a nice time staying at Darby's place. It was clean, tidy and within a convenient distance to places in downtown Seattle. Previous comments on the choppy wi-fi and the loud music downstairs are true, but they didn't affect our stay at all. "
1815472,46284579,2015-09-09,37929000,Kaitlin,"My female friend and I enjoyed our stay for one night in Seattle here. The apartment 203 was cozy and so cute and true to the photos. Just a reminder there is no elevator so if youre a heavy packer be ready for some lifting ;) The bed was so comfy and we got a chance to do a load of laundry in the washer/dryer. Overall a nice comfy spot for the last night of a long trip. 

We sat and people watched from the window for awhile. There's a small square in view and we saw several groups from the underground tour walk by to see the oldest restaurant in Seattle. 

I would say the only con was finding a place to park our rental car. We ended up paying $28 for the Butler parking garage very close to the apartment. Which worked out just fine, we just weren't accustomed to city parking! We made sure to not leave any items in our car and had no troubles to report. 
 
The bartenders of Merchants, Hannah and Justin, were extremely helpful in checking in and answering any questions we had. We did not go out for drinks when we stayed here because we didn't want to walk home through the surrounding area alone. We did however have a drink at Merchants and had a nice time."
1815472,46386054,2015-09-10,5434439,Kathy,"I only had the pleasure of staying in this adorable apartment for one night---I wish that I could have stayed longer.  The apartment was clean and exactly as pictures on the website.  It's located in a great location for touring Seattle, many great restaurants, and very close to the ferries and Pike's Market.  I could continue raving about the apartment, but what I really want to rave about is the host, Darcy.  On my flight to Seattle for Atlanta, I injured my knee.  When I arrived at the apartment, I was in great pain.  Darcy quickly found an urgent care center that took my insurance, physically drove me to the center, came back to pick me up (after a 4-hour ordeal), and then had dinner with me in the cafe that she owns below the apartment (great food and drinks, by the way).  She was a Godsend.   I can't thank her enough for all of the help that she provided me, as I was traveling by myself.  I highly recommend staying in this adorable apartment.  Darcy is the kind of host that makes Airbnb the great entity that it is.  "
1815472,46691445,2015-09-13,26379614,Kimberly,Location was excellent and and easy trip back to the airport.  The check in process was also great because of the ability to leave bags with the Merchant (bar downstairs - also the oldest bar in Seattle!)  The room was very cozy and clean. 
1815472,48439839,2015-09-26,28428075,Katelyn,Darcy was a great host and the place was very central. It was the perfect little spot to stay.
1815472,48570115,2015-09-27,413725,Jennifer,"This is such a cute place in a cool, historical building. It was perfect for our one night stay for a concert in the neighborhood.

We loved having the Merchant Cafe below the apartment to grab drinks. Everyone that we met that works there was really nice and fun.

We would love to stay here again."
1815472,48894116,2015-09-29,41421015,Cameron,Loved the apartment! Such a cool vibe and had an amazing location. I was able to walk anywhere I wanted. Was a little noisy at night but can't do much about that when you are in the middle of Downtown.
1815472,49111753,2015-10-01,39128332,Nirvana,Apartment was as described. The staff were fantastic and stored our bags for us when we arrived early.
1815472,49930683,2015-10-07,11133127,Baptisto,"The Host Darcy called me a couple of days before my arrival. She conveniently accommodated an additional request I had at the last min and made sure it worked out for me. 
Nice cozy Apt. Centrally located. Uber/Taxi cost $5 to downtown so perfect for staying extremely close to Seattle downtown.... without the outrageous downtown hotel prices.
Would definitely recommend!
"
1815472,50292078,2015-10-11,6157407,Benjamin,"Darcy's place is located in a historic building and the room has exposed brick walls, making it very charming. The view from the window is Pioneer Square. The location is excellent, only 3 min walk from the airport light rail. 

As Darcy also owns the bar downstairs checking in is super easy. 

The flat has a full kitchen that we did not use but will be useful for longer stays. We only stayed a night. "
1815472,50647921,2015-10-13,37468593,Kevin,"Darcy was great at responding to our texts very promptly.  She has an arrangement that you can leave your bags in The Merchant Cafe below and you can also collect your key from there too. The apartment was ideal.  We were only there a night, but it was comfortable and well equipped.  The neighbourhood was the only thing that we found a little off putting, as there were a lot of people begging in the area.  The apartment is in a good position for walking to Pike Market, Pioneer Sq. and the Amtrak station."
1815472,50747212,2015-10-14,20131203,Melissa,What a wonderful cozy place to stay and right in the middle of everything! Check in and out was quick and easy. The place was clean and exactly as listed. There is a fairly wicked pair of stairs to get up to the apartment tho for those who may have difficulty. They allowed me to store my bike indoors (up the stairs) as well which was a huge bonus. Very clean! 
1815472,51018891,2015-10-17,41006072,Sareen,"The staff down at Merchants Cafe on the ground floor made us feel extremely welcomed for our stay. They were very friendly and accessible if we needed something like ice, water or directions. The listing was exactly as described, very chic and homey as expected with plenty amenities as listed. The neighborhood (Pioneer Square) was very picturesque, right in the middle of what seemed to be a very historical area of Seattle and it was so close to many sight-seeing spots we wanted to visit. There was quite a few homeless people lingering in the area, and it was a little loud for us on Friday night because of the nearby bars, but it wasn't an issue too big of an issue for us at all. It was a little eerie when we found out the building was slightly spooky, but it was super thrilling for us since we visited just weeks before Halloween!"
1815472,51307132,2015-10-19,3520992,Megan,"Overall it was a good experience staying at the Studio Apartment. We paid a lot to park across the street, but that seems to be typical for Seattle. There were two different football games going on the weekend that we went, so it was pretty crazy in the Pioneer Square area. Saturday night was very loud and difficult to sleep. It was nice to be in the middle of everything and walking distance to Pikes Place, and many other sites, but I think I would have preferred to be in a different part of town. "
1815472,51706361,2015-10-24,24645878,Summer,This was such a quaint place to stay. Everyone from Merchants cafe was helpful and friendly. Easy access to some of the most popular sites to see and a short walk to all forms of public transportation. I would highly recommend staying here if your passing through Seattle. We loved it:)
1815472,52225543,2015-10-27,1121041,Loreen,"loved the neighbour, absolutely central to everything you would want to see and do in Seattle. all the staff connected to the place were friendly - from the cleaners to the key holder. Also I forgot something at the apartment and they were quick to locate it and mail it back to me. So grateful for that! totally recommend!"
1815472,52512432,2015-10-30,23749618,Chelsea,"Darcy's Seattle studio was beautiful, cozy and tidy... not to mention perfectly centrally-located right by 1st Ave in downtown Seattle. We discovered the best parts of the city within a 10 minute walk from the apartment. Check-in and check-out was easy with help from the cafe downstairs (the oldest restaurant in Seattle!). All in all it was a wonderful stay."
1815472,52666505,2015-10-31,22510386,Oak,Great experience. Super easy quick check in and check out. It was great being at the heart of Seattle.
1815472,52991389,2015-11-03,44873227,Max,"We arrived in Seattle right a sports game was starting. Great to see the energy on the streets but parking was impossible as the stadiums are closeby.  We ended up parking in a gated garage across the street which was expensive, but worth it for the overall peace of mind. Getting into the room was a piece of cake. We grabbed the key from the Bar below amd that was it! Very cool, cozy room with an awesome window for people watching.  Definitely a large homeless population just around the corner, but after living in Philly for 6 years I felt right at home. Everyone was friendly.  Was very cool stayinabove the oldest bar in Seattle, definitely felt the history. Was a great little cap to an awesome west coast RT. 1 roadtrip."
1815472,53588368,2015-11-09,34457873,Katelyn,"Darcy was so sweet and accommodating. Her place is very charming, and full of history."
1815472,53671070,2015-11-10,28765425,Lauren,I will absolutely be coming back. The bar downstairs is a great place to hang out before turning in for the night. The studio was a bit noisy but it had a great feel to it!
1815472,53700795,2015-11-11,72642,Will,Great space in a continent location. Clean and comfortable accommodations. Darcy was great with communication and even arrange parking for us. Would stay again. 
1815472,53772178,2015-11-12,6196746,Malia,"Check-in was super easy. We picked up (email hidden) downstairs from a very friendly and helpful bartender who showed us to our room. The room was as pictured-cute and cozy with exposed brick and a nice kitchenette. We were a ten minute walk away from the WaMu Center, where we were heading to see a show. The neighborhood is awesome, and so close to many bars and restaurants. I would definitely stay here again."
1815472,53886562,2015-11-14,30682312,Rene,Das Appartment ist wirklich eine besondere Unterkunft über der ältesten Bar Seattles. Es ist sehr sauber und alles was man benötigt ist vorhanden. Am Wochenende kann es etwas lauter werden aber das weiß man ja vorher. Wir würden wieder buchen.
1815472,54132111,2015-11-16,23354137,Kristopher,"Darcy's place was wonderful and the staff down at the Merchant provided wonderful service. Right in the heart of the action, great for a short weekend stay. (The club downstairs may be a little loud for some!)"
1815472,55039164,2015-11-27,4469647,Olga,"Darcy is an experienced and thoughtful host.  The apartment is clean, convenient, and comfortable. The original charm of the 100+ year old building has been preserved. Rooms are decorated tastefully, to accentuate the brick walls and character of Pioneer Square. The apartment was unobtrusively stocked with all the essentials for a several day stay.

I would recommend this place to anyone who'd like to see real, historic downtown Seattle. It is located on the corner of 1st Ave, right by the piers and the bars. 

We were able to easily find on-street parking ($3 / hour during the day, free at night until 8am, free on holidays). There is also a parking place across the street.

The Seattle Art Museum and all the restaurants and small shops are within walking distance. 

The waterfront was a couple of blocks down the hill, and I could go on runs to see the sunrise and seagulls every morning. The wi-fi was good.

As an added bonus, Darcy quietly upgraded our room to the largest one (#203) before we checked in."
1815472,55169226,2015-11-28,1840565,Marianne,Great location everything is walking distance! Easy check in and check out! As advertised it get loud on the weekend. I did enjoyed staying there though I'll definitely recommend this place! 
1815472,55815273,2015-12-06,4209195,Sarah,Great place! Very convenient location and easy checkin. So helpful being able to leave bags downstairs after checkout. Also fun downstairs bar with a discount because you're staying upstairs. Highly recommended!
6466388,34564646,2015-06-09,12576752,Eloise,"Shana and Jesse were super nice and helpul and made me feel like home! I stayed 2.5 weeks in their place and it was really convenient and pleasant.  The house was nice and well located : close to university and also a direct bus to downtown, with a walking distance to green lake which is also one of the greatest places in the city
I highly recommend this place and thanks to them for everything."
6466388,34916037,2015-06-13,14956110,Ellis,"My girlfriend and I had a wonderful stay at Shayna's place! As soon as we arrived she warmly showed us the place and went over everything we would need to know (even recommending some great places to eat) :D. 

The location is great with plenty of things to do, eat, and see. All in all we had a wonderful time!  "
6466388,35124462,2015-06-15,1309737,Char,"My husband and I loved Shana's house. It is indeed Airy, open and comfortable.  The bed in the guest room is so comfortable, I slept better than I have in a long time. We felt very welcome in the house and liked chatting with Shana and other residents."
6466388,36797926,2015-07-01,31354296,Clarissa,"Shana and Jesse were great hosts. Although Shana was out of town for the first half of our stay, Jesse did a great job of welcoming us to their home. In addition, their home is located in great area near Green Lake and the bus stop to take you to other areas of Seattle is only a block away."
6466388,37099581,2015-07-04,7292355,Michele,"The house was very conveniently located, which I loved. The bed was very comfortable and I especially enjoyed having access to a bike to ride! Shana was a friendly and generous host. I wouldn't recommend this room to anyone who might be bothered by traffic noise (the room faces a busy street) or sharing a bathroom multiple people."
6466388,37433374,2015-07-06,35732917,Alexander,I requested a last minute booking and was accepted. The house is in a nice safe neighborhood. Even though Shana was out of town she made her place available through the help of a friend. This was my 1st Airbnb experience and I never plan to use a hotel again. The price was more than appropriate for the accommodations and hospitality.
6466388,37577274,2015-07-08,10875580,Sharon,"Shana was a very accommodating host as far as needs I shared with her ahead of time.  The location is a convenient residential neighborhood.  I would not recommend this listing to anyone who would prefer not to share a tiny bathroom with several other people.  A place in the bath to put a make-up or shaving kit would be helpful.  Since it was 90+degrees when we visited, a fan would have been helpful, as would shades and screens on the windows.  We didn't know if the kitchen was supposed to be used, but since there was no glass or cup for water available elsewhere, we did get that from the kitchen.  We were provided two nice sets of towels, but no washcloths."
6466388,38018774,2015-07-12,14764314,Erica,"I had a great stay at Shana's.  The place is nice and clean and the beds are comfy.  Shana made breakfast for me one morning, and was very friendly.  She also made good recommendations about what to do and where to eat in the area.  Green Lake very close - I went swimming two mornings.  The place is within walking distance from the university, and there is a bus by the house that goes straight downtown, making sightseeing easy.  Highly recommended.  Thanks, Shana!"
6466388,38317505,2015-07-14,36578922,Taylor,"Shana and her housemates were very sweet and welcoming. The house is in a great neighborhood, and just a short walk from restaurants, bars, shops, and a lake. I would stay there again. "
6466388,38424752,2015-07-15,36392972,Sara,"Shana was gracious and kind and wonderful. The bed was amazingly comfy and the neighborhood is gorgeous. Shana and her housemates gave me recommendations for local food and stores, and were very welcoming. Highly recommend taking a stroll through the neighborhood, it is a lovely place to walk and look at all the old houses and beautiful gardens."
6466388,38787301,2015-07-18,2049298,Liam,"Place was easy to find, accommodations spare but comfy enough. Entry went smoothly.  Someone came home after midnight and had a phone conversation which was fully audible through the bedroom door, then did laundry downstairs which was fully audible through the floor. Someone then did laundry again around 7:00 AM. Other than the noise this place met our needs."
6466388,39630537,2015-07-25,33821649,Hasina,"We spent 1 week at Shana's place. The place is well located both to go to the university district and the city center. The room is nice and clean, the bed is very comfortable. The house is in a quite neighbourhood. We have seen Shana only once, and she has been very nice"
6466388,39980021,2015-07-27,37260404,Berit,"Shana is a very nice and helpflul host. The room is clean, we could wash our dirty clothes and use the kitchen. Shana is easy talking to and at the same time respects the privacy of her guests.
Only negative: one night somebody washed laundry until 2 in the morning... 
In total a great possibility to stay over in Seattle!
Thanks Shana!"
6466388,40296157,2015-07-29,18775460,Paul,Shana was very friendly and on top of communication - great host!
6466388,42939498,2015-08-16,40121116,Mai,It was very comfortable room! I really enjoyed staying.
6466388,43806807,2015-08-22,20741723,Eva,"The room was very comfortable, the kitchen was spacious, and I had everything I needed. The host (Jesse, in my case) was very helpful and accommodating.  The house is located in a safe neighbourhood, close to nice jogging trails around Greenlake and in biking distance from the UW. "
6466388,44826117,2015-08-29,41100957,Julie,"The house is as described, and in a lovely residential neighborhood with bus lines right nearby.  My room was welcoming and clean, with a good bed. Nice, well lit shared main room for working during the day. There is just one bathroom in the house, with two airbnb rooms plus 2 others living there, but we shared well and it wasn't a big deal. Jesse who was hosting for Shana, was helpful when I needed info, and even gave me an early morning ride to the airport for way less than a cab would have been. "
6466388,45446618,2015-09-02,27154973,Kejun,"Jesse, who was managing the house when I stayed there, was incredibly nice and made extra effort to ensure my stay there was the best it could be. I had some special conditions that required me to move in earlier and move out late, but Jesse did not hesitate at all to help me out. 

The room I stayed in was very clean and large, so all in all, the experience is highly recommended."
6466388,47129264,2015-09-15,43224246,Elizabeth,"Shana welcomed us in with our last minute booking.  It was a little pricey, but was very nice and quiet.  We kept to ourselves, but Shana was available for local tips and advice.  "
6466388,49756671,2015-10-06,14241548,Alison,The host canceled this reservation 18 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
8221520,49675606,2015-10-05,38207252,Dave,"The communication from both Airbnb and Pillow was really good. Everything was simple even without the host actually being there. The house was ideal for our group of 6 with room for the kids to get away and the grown ups to enjoy some tunes played on vinyl - a real blast from the past.
The location is great and the property is first class - we really enjoyed our short stay and visit to Seattle.
Dave & Robyn - Brisbane"
8221520,50598156,2015-10-12,28164583,Tetiana,"I rented this house for me and my five friends. The house was really big and everyone had private space. Rooms are spotlessly clean and large enough to feel yourself comfortable even for a long stay.
We would like to mention that every detail and every corner of the interiors and exteriors are built with love and perfect taste.
The location is very close to the downtown (about 7 mins drive ) and still very quiet.
This is a great place to stay, and I can't recommend it highly enough."
8221520,54204497,2015-11-16,48686353,Peggy,"The house has a lot of appeal.  Clean, nicely decorated, good natural light, some nice city views and spacious.  Parking is easy and it is a short distance to downtown, though not walkable. "
8221520,54656524,2015-11-22,3770013,Tona,"Stayed here while on a business trip. The house was exactly as expected and just as the picures portray. Very nice. Beautiful view of the city. Plenty of space.   There are quite a few stairs just in case this is a concern for someone. The location was perfect for us. Literally took 10 minutes to get to downtown. There was a very nice grocery store very close.  If you care, the only thing they don't provide is hand towels and washrags but I believe they are available for an extra charge. They provide plenty of bath towels and have everything you could possibly need if you are interested in cooking a home made meal. Definitely would stay there again! Thanks Daniel! "
8221520,54906042,2015-11-25,23594286,Hanson,"It was really happy staying at Daniel's house. The house is clean and big, and it has everything you need. Easy access to downtown and major attractions, easy parking in the garage. The communication was great too! Really good experience."
8221520,55210190,2015-11-29,881584,Katie,"This is a really lovely home in a convenient location. We enjoyed our stay, the house was big enough to accommodate me and my family on our holiday visit and we loved the turn table! The hosts were responsive when we needed anything. "
8221520,55515772,2015-12-01,49647723,Patty,"The fireplace was lit and there were lights on! He had a vintage record collection and a turntable! Enjoy this house immensely clean modern, loved it!"
5424448,39000504,2015-07-20,25313101,Tanya,"Susannah, our host, was so lovely and helpful. We didn't have any questions or problems with the house and her instructions were clear and easy to follow. The house itself is quaint and adorable and fit our girls getaway weekend plans perfectly. Beds were comfortable and the house was clean. Columbia City is a $20 Cab/Uber ride to Belltown/Downtown. It is a safe, up and coming neighbourhood and we would definitely stay here again! "
160222,385875,2011-07-20,794260,Charlene,"Amy's apartment was just as described, although the view was much more wonderful than we expected. Her neighbors were welcoming, the neighborhood quiet and the location excellent for touring Seattle. Amy quickly reponded to our request to stay and answered every question that we asked before and during the visit. We will definitely stay there again if we have the opportunity."
160222,389838,2011-07-22,836656,Paul,"Needed a place to stay last minute for a conference and Amy's place was just the ticket.  Great view of the waterfront and only an $8 cab ride to where I needed to go (3rd and University), so the place is located perfectly.  Amy was very accommodating, having linens and towels changed despite the last minute stay and even though she was out of the country.  Would do it again."
160222,455370,2011-08-18,9362,Matt,Beautiful location with a gorgeous view. Amy was a wonderful and generous host. 
160222,465693,2011-08-22,849838,Aileen,Amy was a fantastic host! She was very responsive to our questions and gave us great suggestions.  The place was clean and exactly as advertised (also an incredible view).  I would definitely stay here again next time I am in Seattle.
160222,520157,2011-09-11,798899,Mindy,"The apartment was in a great location.  The Fremont, Ballard and downtown Seattle locationswere all easily reached by foot, bus or car.  Very quiet apartment complex with little traffic noise or loud neighbors.  Amy was great about communicating and had great suggestions for restaurants.  I would highly recommend both Amy and her wonderful apartment!"
160222,556613,2011-09-22,895911,Burnetta,"This was my first airbnb experience. It will be difficult to surpass this trip. The location, near the Fremont neighborhood, was perfect. We had a parking spot, but public transportation is only a block away.  The view of Lake Union alone is worth the stay.  We loved sitting on the deck and watching all the activity on the water.  The neighbors are quiet and there was no street noise.  The apartment is neat and clean and the bed is very comfortable.  It was a home away from home."
160222,753839,2011-11-29,827795,Grace,"Amy's place was great.  Really nice to have the views of Lake Union, and although we didn't get to see the mountains because of the clouds, we knew they were there.  Good location, quiet for inner city, and very comfortable....warm, comfy bed, private.  "
160222,947459,2012-02-26,624099,Michelle,"A perfect spot for early morning gazing upon the lake while sipping your morning brew.  I was blessed to have stayed at Amy's place for 15 days.  The space is clean, warm, cozy, easy to get to, and with great views and a balcony garden.  In a word, lovely.  

You will not be disappointed.  

Thank you Amy for such a wonderful stay. "
160222,1157503,2012-04-21,230856,Gabrielle & Malcolm,My stay was wonderful! I highly recommend staying at this apartment as it is in a wonderful location and has a beautiful view! The place is clean and cozy and is located walking distance to the restaurants and shops in Freemont district.

160222,1698582,2012-07-13,1771706,Preston,Amy was great. The view is amazing and the apartment is cozy. 
160222,1744960,2012-07-19,1373158,Tyler C.,"Amy was a great host. She was available for prompt responses to our questions, and had a very mellow, friendly attitude to her. The place was quite beautiful..we spent much of our time on her balcony gazing at Lake Union. The apartment was quiet and homey, and very accessible to all of the different neat little neighborhoods of Seattle. When we return to Seattle, we will absolutely check for her place again! thanks amy!"
160222,1766089,2012-07-21,2942864,Mary Ellen,"It's a great space with a lovely view right in the heart of the city. The only downside was the wifi was not working. Amy did offer an alternative, but the signal was a little weak.

160222,2275275,2012-09-14,2870802,Julianne,"Wonderful spot overlooking Lake Union.  Easy access to Seattle Center and downtown.  Host helpful with local eateries and books/maps of area.  Comfortable bed!  Complete kitchen,"
160222,2945200,2012-11-23,3606176,Julia,"Cosy apartment in a good location with fantastic views. Amy was very helpful and accommodating, suggesting places to eat and providing guidebooks and local area guides. The apartment windows face directly onto Lake Union and there is always something to watch. One thing to note, the apartment has no microwave or dishwasher and the washing machine / dryer is on the bottom floor of the building. This was fine for us. Great place to stay in Seattle - the short walk to Fremont and around Lake Union are quintessentially Seattle. "
160222,4578642,2013-05-13,6062609,Nuno,Just moved to Seattle and rented Amy's apartment as a temporary stay. The apartment was perfect for my needs with an amazing view from the balcony where humming birds came and play in the evenings. The apartment was clean and Amy was very helpful. Next door neighbours equally friendly. I very highly recommend this apartment
160222,4841922,2013-05-28,3023475,Mary,"I really can't say enough GOOD GOOD GOOD about our Airbnb experience with Amy Pennington this past weekend. Completely wonderful in every possible way!! The apartment is amazing -- very convenient to Seattle Center, completely comfortable and what a treat it is to get to live with such views for a few days. Amy herself is such a fantastic human being and host. We loved everything about our stay, and feel spoiled forever -- no more hotels, please -- Airbnb is the way to go!!"
160222,5068002,2013-06-10,6653779,Steven,"I felt right at home in Amy's apartment, the view from the patio was wonderful and it's right in the heart of the city. I hope it's available next time I'm in Seattle."
160222,5241208,2013-06-20,5552612,Desiree,Amy is a great host! She left all kinds of information for us about Seattle & reccomended some great restaurants. The apartment had a wonderful view! We were not disappointed.
160222,5352212,2013-06-25,6821348,Rebecca,"This was my first airbnb experience and it was awesome!  Amy's apartment was clean and located in a really convenient and accessible part of town.  It was super easy to take the bus to downtown Seattle or walk to Freemont.  Her view was amazing.  Amy was super helpful and responsive in answering any questions we had as well, and even suggested some good running locations, as she knew I was in town to run the Rock and Roll Half Marathon."
160222,9422135,2013-12-28,3038947,Cindy,Amy was a great host! She was easy to get in contact with and really made us feel at home. My boyfriend and I were visiting over Christmas break and she left out some christmas decorations for us! The view was breathtaking and really allowed us to have a relaxing break. The location was perfect. I would love to stay there again! 
160222,12251846,2014-04-27,9937030,Wendy,"A lovely relaxing stay in Amy's home.  The bed was very comfortable and the views from the balcony amazing.  The bus into town is very close by and a regular schedule which was great!  Amy was extremely helpful and very easy to get in touch with.  We arrived late at night and would have been stuck for breakfast, but Amy had told us to help ourselves to what was in the freezer, so we enjoyed a feast of blueberries and pancakes! Thanks for a great stay!
"
160222,14082405,2014-06-11,3684743,Graham,"We had a wonderful time at Amy's apartment - the view was an amazing thing to wake up to every morning, the pantry was stocked with all sorts of delicious things, and her balcony inspired us to start an apartment garden of our own.

We didn't rent a car while we were in Seattle (New Yorkers), so it took us a day to figure out where everything was, to realize that walkable is relative by city, and that Seattle isn't messing around when they say ""hills"" (!) but once we got oriented we were pretty set. The apartment is on a walkable street, but some of the surrounding street sidewalks were a little overgrown, so it's worth noting that the neighborhood is a little more car-centric. Fortunately, there was quick access to local transit and it was really easy to get downtown."
160222,14193617,2014-06-14,12095075,Sheila,"Our stay at Amy's apartment was like a dream! She was thorough, considerate, and timely in her communications, and went out of her way to check in and make sure we were enjoying our stay. As a gluten free food lover, both her kitchen and the neighboring restaurants in Fremont were full of possibility. The view was breathtaking, the bed was super comfortable - it was quite hard to leave! Our first time visiting Seattle, and surely won't be our last. We'll think back very fondly on this trip, thanks to Amy and the lovely space she has created. Thanks for everything! "
160222,14357295,2014-06-17,332816,Jennifer,"I was in town for a seminar that ran from 9am to 10pm for 3 days, so while I spent very little time at the apartment, it was PERFECT for what I needed.  Amy was awesome in answering all of my questions and quickly responded via txt.  The apt was very clean, the views were awesome and I was surprised at the lack of noise I heard coming from the street."
160222,18945899,2014-09-03,17615937,Marc-Antoine,"Everything was well prepared and clean. All the amaneties you need. Perfect stay, awesome location and the view was above our expectation. We would recommend to any one and we would definitely stay there again."
160222,19102249,2014-09-06,247135,Howard,"Amy offers a great place to stay in Seattle. While I did not meet Amy personally, the reservation and check in went very smooth. The place was very clean and had a great view of Lake Union. Amy provided a lot of tips about where to eat to guide 1st time visitors.

There is a nearby kayak rental place where you can see the city from a different perspective. The location is great, you are near most of Seattle's main attractions.

Seattle is a bit under the radar for vacation destinations but I find it to be a great place to visit with the best seafood places of anywhere in the US.

If you are planning a visit and this apartment is available the grab it."
160222,19200159,2014-09-08,15690821,Sophie,"Amy was a very helpfull and nice host, she gave us many advices to explore Seattle. Amy's apartment was perfect for us and we recommend it, everything you need is in! Too bad we couldn't stay longer... Next time perhaps ;)"
160222,19393459,2014-09-11,20952227,Chris,"The apartment is clean and has all the comforts of home including cable tv, wifi, and lots of cooking supplies. The view from this place is amaxing, overlooking Lake Union. The sunrise makes for a great start to your day. 

Amy has a wonderful home and I would recommend this place over any chain hotel in downtown Seattle."
160222,19613366,2014-09-15,19641339,Faith,"We had a wonderful stay in Amy's apartment!!  Amy was very thorough and easy to communicate with. Everything was exactly as she described, and we couldn't ask for a better location! Her apartment is a great place to springboard for pretty much anywhere you want to go! It's close to downtown and just a short bus ride down to the busy Pikes Place shopping, yet it's just far enough out to get some peace from the bustle of the city. I loved sitting on the porch watching the boats and sea planes on lake union.  And if you get up early enough, the sunrise over the lake and mountains is beautiful!  There were great restaurants and boutiques in Fremont, easily within walking distance of the apartment.  We were in town for a wedding and only stayed four days,  but we managed to squeeze in downtown and Pikes Place market, Queen Anne, Fremont, the ""junction"" and the beach in west seattle and hiked in both Mt. Baker national forest and at Mt. Rainier. I would highly recommend staying in Amy's apartment to get the most out of you stay in Seattle!

Thanks Amy!!"
160222,20911635,2014-10-07,20939997,Pierrot,"Amy provided a detailed description of everything we needed to know about the apartment and moving in. She also gave a lot of information about the neighborhood and where we could go to visit. Her apartment has a great view of Lake Union. It is also very well situated if you are visiting Seattle, everything is a short driving distance away and reasonable walking distance was well."
160222,21147647,2014-10-12,21337373,Bonnie,We had a lovely time. The location and apartment were as advertised. Having the bus line so close was a definite benefit. 
160222,22038861,2014-10-28,22408432,Sara,Amy was an incredible host--she left us detailed instructions and recommendations/directions on how to get around. She was extremely responsive to all of our questions and I would stay at her beautiful waterfront apartment again in a heartbeat!
160222,23069715,2014-11-22,6246501,Jon,"Amy's apartment is the perfect Seattle hideaway!  Gorgeous view, super convenient location, well-stocked kitchen full of nearly any gadget you'd ever need, AND a stellar collection of cookbooks to peruse and/or cook from--always a plus for me!  We'd definitely stay again, and I've already recommended her place to family visiting Seattle.  Thanks, Amy!

Even though Dezember & Januar are not the sunniest months of the year, it has wonderful view and great energy despite of what is going on outside. It is very cosy, bright and warm, I felt immediately like at home. I love walking, and I enjoyed beautiful walk by the lake to the downtown - in about half an hour you are in the city. Or - opposite direction - just 15 min walk and you are in Freemont. 
If I would come back to Seattle, I would definitely stay here and nowhere else, I really fell in love with this place!
Thank you, Amy!

Amy provided detailed instructions and information concerning the apartment and area.  "
160222,34802209,2015-06-12,24464339,Lihi,"I loved staying at Amy's house! I wish I could have stayed longer. The house felt like home right away, and I liked have stared out at that lake for hours on end. Thanks for everything, Amy!"
160222,35211382,2015-06-16,8860452,Laura,Amy was very helpful and friendly. Her instructions were very clear making it easy to navigate around her place. The apartment was very clean and comfortable. Nice bed and living area. It was also really nice having access to a fully stocked kitchen. 
160222,41372322,2015-08-07,206203,Amanda,"Amy's apartment is view, view, view! Gasworks park, Montlake Cut, Lake Union. I had a fabulous time watching all the boats, boarders, and rowers. Even got to see the Duck Dodge where there were easily 100 sailboats on the lake. Her place is well equipped and comfortable. Also close to everything. She is a friendly accommodating host. Everything was easy."
160222,41619056,2015-08-08,36212651,Lisa,Amy has a lovely place with a totally awesome view!  It is close to Seattle sights and a great place to stay- we would definitely recommend this to others and would stay again when we are in Seattle!!
160222,42834455,2015-08-16,24051940,Leah,"Amy's apartment is clean and she is generous in leaving food available for her guests.  The view from her apartment is beautiful.  All that said, it is a dingy building with stained carpets leading to the apartment.  The apartment itself is in bad need of repairs but if you don't care much about aesthetics, it will do.  There is plenty of space."
160222,43501756,2015-08-20,26968044,Marnie,"Loved the view, convenience to downtown on the bus, proximity to Queen Anne's Hill restaurants, and quiet building.  Senior fare on the bus is $1! The owner left coffee for us to prepare and cupboards full of food supplies. (We used very little of the food as we were seldom there.)
Unfortunately, the building and the airbnb apartment need updating. Some items in the apartment need repair. Generally, the apartment was clean, however, some cleaning was overlooked in the kitchen."
160222,44315419,2015-08-25,5439244,Stacey,"Amy's place is so cozy with a breathtaking view of Lake Union.  While there are not many restaurants close by, the apartment is a great launch pad for exploring Seattle.  It's only a 15 minute walk to Fremont which is bubbling with life and choices, and close to South Lake Union.  I will definitely try to stay here again the next time I'm in Seattle."
160222,45264777,2015-09-01,37519064,Rachelle,"Just stayed at Amy's for my first airbnb experience ever and really loved it! The view and location are key here. Once you step through the door, the apartment-wide window/glass doors overlooking the balcony and lake are just breathtaking. Having that free flowing air constantly through the apartment made the days and nights so peaceful to start and come home to. 
The apartment overall was very cute and just what we needed to rest our heads. Everything was cleanly laid out for us upon arrival with whatever we may need [linens/food staples] available to us when ready. 
For the kitchen: we, unfortunately, did not take advantage of cooking since we were always on the go, but it is nice to have all options available.
The living room was spacious and couch comfortable to Latin together with music from her stereo staring our day off right. The bedroom was very cute with the softest pillows, sheets and mattress to sink into, and enough space to store our belongings for the five day stay. 
Location-wise, we did not take advantage of walking into downtown due to steep hills and weather conditions, but anything in the city was no more than a mile/two away to get up and go to. This made hopping from restaurants to sight-seeing downtown or in Fremont so easily accessible to experience all Amy's/our friends recommendations on our must-see/do list.
Overall, Amy's apartment was the perfect place and way for us to experience the city and I would stay here again in a heartbeat :)"
160222,45661288,2015-09-05,31735194,Ron,"We couldn't have picked a better place for our first Airbnb stay. Imagine floor-to-ceiling window views of Lake Union to welcome you when you enter the apartment. 

We discovered that right below the apartment is the boathouse Tom Hank's character on ""Sleepless in Seattle"" stayed. The Seattle Duck Tour (which I highly recommend) took us onto Lake Union to show us the boathouse. It was pretty amazing to think we were staying in a primo spot on the lake. 

The bed was so comfortable that I was able to sleep through the night in a very long time. 

Seattle was really chilly - especially for us SoCal people. However, it was perfect weather for us to enjoy chilling on the couch with the the quilts Amy provided to keep us warm. 

Amy provided very detailed instructions that took a lot of the guessing work out for us - perfect for Airbnb novices. 

The apartment as a whole had a lot of character that really made you feel at home. 

Most of our time was spent touring Seattle - which was easy to do since we were just a few minutes away from Downtown and the Space Needle. 

As for our Seattle stay, we would recommend taking the Underground Tour - which you can find in Pioneer Square. The tour takes you to the city below that today's Seattle was built on top of. 

We rented a car since my wife couldn't do much walking. Most of our money was spent on parking. I'd highly recommend commuting if you're able to do so. "
160222,46278804,2015-09-09,18891427,Tamara,"Amy has the apartment all set up for guests so it was a very pleasant and comfortable stay.  Location was terrific, we took the 26/28 bus downtown frequently, including to/from light link to airport.  Amy is a joy to work with, very responsive, accommodating, and friendly."

Great getaway...thanks, Amy!"
160222,50206056,2015-10-10,11608180,James,"Amy's place is amazing! Sweeping views of Lake Union! A kitchen reminiscent of your own home, stocked with all the spices and tools you'll need to make a great home cooked meal. Her eclectic taste of artwork and dishware made me feel right at home.  It's right on the bus line, minutes from downtown, and there are plenty of Car2go's in the hood. It's quiet, clean and charming. I had some questions regarding the household and she was very responsive in getting back to me!  I hope to stay here  again on another business trip. "

5020861,29634999,2015-04-10,5497516,Michael,"Christen was a very gracious and welcoming host. The bed was incredibly comfortable and the room was very spacious and quiet. Being able to eat breakfast on the back porch in the morning was a very nice touch. Christen even cooked a delicious homemade soufflé for my stay. The location is perfect for visiting the university and is right next to coffee shops, restaurants and stores. "
5020861,31953054,2015-05-12,23190267,Lingyi,Christen is a wonderful host! The room is clean and cozy. The location is also perfect for me! It's very close to UW and I'm able to visit my friend everyday without taking a long trip. I really enjoy my stay here.
5020861,35002323,2015-06-14,33292928,Colin,Christen was a great hostess. She was very considerate and helpful in regards to my crazy schedule. Her apartment was spacious and conveniently located next to a lively part of town. It is also less than a 15 minute walk to campus. I would absolutely recommend her apartment to anyone looking for a place to stay near the Washington University campus.
5020861,36209539,2015-06-26,34945880,Changsup,"I could stay very comfortable thanks to her kind assistance. Since I went to bed and got up early to manage terrible conference schedule, she understood my situation very well."
5020861,38402342,2015-07-15,34881792,越,房子的位置很不错，就在华盛顿大学区里面，房东很热情好客。
5020861,39674222,2015-07-25,15581298,Luiz,"Christen was very nice and very accommodating.  The apartment is at a great location, and if you are in Seattle to visit the University, this is the perfect spot for it.  It's also close to lots of cheap and tasty places to eat.

The apartment is fine, but it definitely has a feel of a college apartment - somewhat messy and not perfectly clean.  For example, I noticed halfway through the stay that the room had a funky smell.  Christen was very apologetic and immediately set out to clean the place, but the smell was there nonetheless.  Also, you’re sleeping on her room, while she sleeps on a sofa-bed in the living room.  In most other places I have stayed in AirBnB, there is some separation of the host space and the guest space, but in this case there wasn’t any.  Finally, this is an apartment with a dog (albeit a tiny one) - there were mornings that I found little puddle of pee or a poo in the bathroom (never anywhere else).  Christen again was very apologetic and always took care of things right away, but this is just something for future guests to keep in mind: these things happen, it’s natural when there is a dog living in the house.

All said, the stay was fine, I would stay again, and I would recommend it to others (specially because of the very nice host), as long as you are aware that this is like staying in a college apartment with roommates."
5020861,41811767,2015-08-09,38316422,George,"I stayed here for a week while attending an event at the KeyArena in downtown Seattle. The room was clean and quiet, Christen was a great host, and it was an easy 15 minute Uber ride to get downtown.

There were only 2-prong outlets in the room so I had to charge my laptop in the living room. So bring a power strip if you're like me and travel with a bunch of electronics."
5020861,43648704,2015-08-21,34827575,Stephen,"One bedroom apartment close to UW campus, convenient to restaurants and groceries, good public transportation. Christen was very welcoming and hospitable. Bedroom is comfortable and private, but you are sharing a 1 bedroom apt; Christen sleeps on the sofa bed in the living room. Full kitchen--fridge, stove dishwasher, microwave, coffee.  Had some trouble with the wireless but Christen got it fixed quick."
5020861,48181267,2015-09-24,40114155,Lucy,Christen was nice and hospitable. Room and bed is big and comfortable. Location is perfect for UW. I would stay again and I would recommend it to others.
5020861,50481817,2015-10-12,43454907,Luis,"Christen was a great host! The bed was comfortable, there was always food & coffee readily available and she always made sure to check if I had everything I needed. Location is perfect if you're visiting UW. Would definitely stay here again if i can. "
5020861,51806588,2015-10-24,40594189,Aaron,"I was in town for an interview at UW, and the location was fantastic.  Christine was very accommodating, even with her busy schedule and my busy schedule.  It was quiet, so I was able to prepare for my interview in peace."
5020861,53949539,2015-11-14,45914719,Nate,The host canceled this reservation 19 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
5020861,57726439,2015-12-28,14549491,Natalie,"Christen wasn't there during my stay, but she left the key very accessible for us and checked in with us to make sure everything was ok throughout the weekend.  The location is close to Capitol Hill and University of Washington.  Overall, great experience!"
793629,3141774,2012-12-23,2062582,Gregory,"Our stay at this lovely house was fantastic!  It is a very cozy, inviting spot, respresented very accurately by the photos and description.  Candace, the proprieter, was very helpful throughout the entire process.  Her instruction manual for check-in and check-out is very clearly written and thorough.  Communication with Candace was a breeze, with prompt replies to all of our questions.  The house is located in a very quiet residential area with easy access to main arteries leading to the downtown, Pike Place, and Capitol Hill areas.....approximately ten minutes away from each.  In short, our visit was a real pleasure and we look forward to staying again sometime for a longer visit.  "
793629,3272867,2013-01-04,4544860,Jacqueline,"We have just returned from a fabulous stay at the Cheery Seattle House with a view! It was a lovely, well equipped house with all amenities and a comfy bed.
The neighbourhood is quiet residential area that is  close to grocery shops and a woodfire pizza restaurant!  The house is also close to transit, light rail.
I would highly recommend this house and Candace, who was so helpful and friendly, making the whole process easy! 
Thanks so much Candace! :)"
793629,3357320,2013-01-16,4341930,Karen,"We were in Seattle for a week to meet our new grandchild. We chose this house because it looked so comfortable and it was close to the light rail. We arrived late in the evening on a cold rainy night. Candace had the lights and the heat on. She had given us such good instructions that we were ""at home"" immediately. She kept in touch in case there were any problems which there weren't.  We had everything we needed. The view was beautiful and the neighborhood so awesome. We took early morning walks and found a wonderful bakery, a friendly coffee shop and a beautiful library. The grocery store is close and has everything you need. My husband and I hope to be able to stay  here every time we come to Seattle. I feel like Candace is a new friend!  She was very caring  and giving of her time and her ""cheery"" home."
793629,3442131,2013-01-30,4348357,Randy,"We just returned from our two weeks stay in Seattle meeting our one week old granddaughter. Our stay at Candace's Cheery Seattle House with a View was wonderful! It is so warm and cozy with everything you would need supplied for you. We really appreciated all the high end appliances. When we ran out of the specialty coffee, Candace had more delivered right to the door! It is in a perfect, quiet location unlike noisy hotels. I highly recommend this adorable home to others vacationing in Seattle. Thank you Candace for the personal touch!"
793629,3582095,2013-02-19,4636775,Herb,"Simply the best accommodations I have ever had in Seattle based on value, convenience, charm,  ease of use, and cleanliness.   The host is kind, considerate, responsive and responsible.  I would definitely stay again any time I could: a great place for a single person or a couple."
793629,3647130,2013-02-27,1477773,Alix,"This was our first time using AirBnB and it was a great experience.  

Candace's place looks exactly like the photos, so no surprises there.  The place was clean, bright, and warm with nice bedding and towels.  The instruction manual for all the appliances was very detailed and didn't leave us wondering about anything.
Our favorite part about this property was its close proximity to public transit (light rail train and bus), and we were able to see all parts of the city without renting a car.
The nearby Red Apple grocery store also made it easy to stock groceries in Candace's beautiful kitchen and saved money on going out for every meal.

We had one issue with a limited amount of hot water that required my husband and I to alternate when we showered (morning/evening), but Candace was super responsive and apologetic about it and offered us a partial refund for the inconvenience.  

Overall, a safe, clean, and well decorated location with a gracious host."
793629,4266029,2013-04-23,4976228,Jonna,Candace's house is a sweet and cozy spot and we will be using it whenever we have family coming to town.  It's a perfect place for those wanting to stay on North Beacon Hill!
793629,4376693,2013-05-01,4462390,Sage,"My sister and I stayed at Candace's house for a week. We did not meet her in person, but she was very attentive and thorough in our email correspondance. 

The house could not have been nicer. Lovely, quiet, and just enough space. Ideal location. Very close to transportation (Light Rail, and many bus lines), and a grocery store.
"
793629,4784650,2013-05-26,4808492,Cindy,"My husband and I stayed at Candace's house for five days and absolutely loved it! The house is an adorable cottage that is fully renovated, bright, inviting, and comfortable, It is conveniently located (near a grocery store and the light rail), and has everything you will need for your stay in Seattle. Candace is so responsive, answering emails promptly and taking care of anything that might arise.  She even left a gift for our new grandson! You will thoroughly enjoy your stay at her home."
793629,4951384,2013-06-03,6512005,Kate,"This was my first time using airbnb, and I had a wonderful experience!  Cheery House was perfect. So cute and comfortable, and in an awesome location. I will definitely come back here next time life takes me to Seattle. I can't say enough good things about the house!"
793629,5115425,2013-06-13,2610209,Junshien,"What a perfect little getaway! The cottage was cute, clean and comfortable. Everything looked exactly like they did in the pictures. The benches in the front lawn were a particularly nice touch, and we wish we had time to make use of them. We never met Candace in person, but she responded to all emails in a very timely manner, and was rather helpful. We would definitely recommend this place for any Seattle visitors!"
793629,5271224,2013-06-22,4670443,Kathy,"Cozy place. We felt at home. Loved all the light & the craftsmanship new leaded glass windows. Full beautiful kitchen, remodeled counters & cabinets -- really -- with everything needed for cooking an baking, full fridge, built in dishwasher, full gas stove. Large, new bathroom. Large front yard, house set back off of street, with view of downtown, quiet neighbors. Lovely place to stay & walk, just off the 12 Ave South Viewpoint, blocks from library, grocery,bakery, and light rail. Looking forward to our next stay."
793629,5339894,2013-06-25,5014749,Emma,Gorgeous little cottage in a very convenient location.  Candace was very easy to communicate with and everything was as expected from the pictures and description.  Would recommend this place to anyone visiting Seattle and happily book it again - Many thanks to Candace!
793629,6189555,2013-08-03,1814472,Larry,"We made reservations for a 45 day stay, after two weeks into our stay they broke the contact and requested we leave two weeks early? This ruined our vacation....we came from Europe. In addition, we had to open the windows because of a heat wave and there were no screens/curtains on the windows and the mosquitos came in and annoyed us all night. The 24/7 noise pollution from jets, trains, I5 interstate, and two dogs next door was extremely unnerving. The house is under final approach to SEATAC international airport! BE AWARE"
793629,6875002,2013-08-28,7863886,Cari,"This charming house was the perfect spot to land after spending our days in and around Seattle. It is incredibly convenient to get to, whether by car or by light rail. We actually took the light rail down to a baseball game one night. Then we would use the car to venture out of Seattle.
The house itself is adorable, in typical Seattle style. The bed is comfortable, the kitchen well-stocked and it was just perfect for 2 of us.
I also can't say enough about the host, Candace. She was so responsive to every message I sent her and incredibly helpful!! I wish she had a house in every town because it would be a pleasure to work with her again."
793629,7091235,2013-09-06,446285,Pat,"What a dollhouse!!!  This little house was perfect for my stay in Seattle.  The hosts were very well prepared for guests and had thought of many extras.  When I had question and asked in an email - they got back to me immediately from Europe! 
It was also unbelievably close to the train and convenient to a grocery store.  The house was very clean and I would stay again!
"
793629,7431293,2013-09-20,2062582,Gregory,"I can only say great things about this property and about our host, Candace.  This was our second visit, the first being for only two nights last December.  We stayed eight nights this time.....and I truly enjoyed being able to fix most of our meals in the nicely appointed kitchen.  Once again, Candace was ever so helpful throughout the entire process, from booking to farewells.  Her promptness in returning messages and her helpful suggestions for shopping, dining, and sightseeing were truly appreciated.  I couldn't have asked for a better experience.  Thank you, Candace!"
793629,7672974,2013-09-29,8408680,Heather,"My husband and I stayed here for a week long vacation. It is a cozy cottage great for two people. It is located in a quiet neighborhood, just three blocks from the LINK train station and a bus stop. It is convenient to downtown and airport. The house is well appointed with most things you could need during a trip. Candace was great to communicate with and quick to respond. "
793629,7923528,2013-10-08,5241214,Kai,"Wir verbrachten 9 wunderbare Tage im „Cheery Seattle House“ wofür ich mich bei Candace und Martin bedanken möchte. Dieses Haus ist perfekt geeignet für den Aufenthalt von 2 Personen in der schönsten Stadt der USA. Es liegt sehr Zentral dass man alle interessanten Punkte der Stadt innerhalb kürzester Zeit mit dem Auto erreichen kann und doch ist es recht ruhig gelegen so dass man vom üblichen Stadtlärm nichts mitbekommt. 
 
Das Haus bietet alles was man für einen Aufenthalt benötigt, so dass man auf keinerlei Annehmlichkeiten die man von zu Hause gewohnt ist verzichten muss. Kleinere Geschäfte sind ebenfalls in nächster Nähe in denen man sich 7 Tage die Woche mit Lebensmittel eindecken kann, ohne zu einem der großen Märkte fahren zu müssen.

Ebenfalls ist das Haus für Besucher aus Deutschsprachigen Ländern zu empfehlen da Martin selbst aus Österreich kommt und man entsprechend benötigten Informationen auch in Deutsch bekommt. Diese kommen auch immer recht schnell, so dass wir nie lange auf Antworten auf unsere E-Mail anfragen warten mussten.

Es war meine erste Reise mit Air BNB und dank Candace und Martin ein voller Erfolg. Hierfür ein riesen Dankeschön. Sollte es uns wieder nach Seattle verschlagen würden wir uns jederzeit wieder für dieses Haus entscheiden!
"
793629,8154204,2013-10-18,8897093,Stephanie,"My husband, 4 year old, 3 month old and I stayed here for 9 days and didn't want to leave! Our two week trip in the greater Seattle area consisted of visiting my husband's family and friends, some of which we haven't seen in years... Needless to say we were super busy and it was so awesome to come back to our ""home base"" and be able to relax. 

Candace was super easy to communicate with and has a great thorough house manual with all the details you would need to know...

The house is definitely cozy but SO comfortable and stocked with everything you might need. It was super clean and has tons of character and charm with great finishes and details. It was really easy to ""move in"" as we felt comfortable and welcomed right away. 

With two kids in tow, the washer and dryer was a must. Candace was so considerate and offered so much stuff for my 4 year old to use (she also has little ones). I took her up on a toddler bed and a basket full of toys :) She was also able to recommend some great kid friendly things to do.

We didn't do any cooking, but the kitchen was completely stocked. We did walk a couple blocks to the supermarket to get some basics and snack foods. The location is great, super close and easy to get around the city, easy parking, and great access to anywhere in the greater Seattle area because its so close to freeways. 

As we continued the remaining part of our trip to other parts of Washington, my son asked if we could go back and stay at the ""Seattle house"" because he loved it so much!  So it has been decided that when we come back to visit Seattle this will be our first choice!

Thanks Candace!!!"
793629,8258974,2013-10-22,2399408,Cecilia,"This stay was perhaps the best AirBnB experience yet. Cutest, coziest, cleanest space ever. With cute, rustic touches. And our hosts were so amazing and accommodating, even though they were coordinating things from overseas. Convenient location too! Much appreciation to our hosts (thank you!), and the highest recommendation to fellow travelers :).  "
793629,8602666,2013-11-07,206203,Amanda,"Cheery Seattle House is a very private, cozy and comfortable cabin with everything you need for an enjoyable stay. Candace is easy to coordinate with and keeps a very clean place. The neighborhood is just a quick trip from downtown and Seattle's many wonderful sites."
793629,8786618,2013-11-18,8962739,Melanie,"This was my first time using Airbnb, and I couldn't have asked for a better experience!  I was in town for work with the symphony, and this was the perfect place to call ""home"" at the end of a long day.  It was a quick 13-minute train ride directly to Benaroya Hall each day, which definitely beats walking in the rain.  There's a grocery store right in front of the Beacon Hill stop, so stocking the fridge was easy for my week-long stay.

The house itself was perfect.  The kitchen had all the cooking supplies you could need; the living area was cozy; the bedroom stayed warm all night.  There are many nice personal touches throughout the home as well.  The neighborhood felt safe, and it was nice to know that there was a property manager close-by in case I needed anything.  Even though she's overseas, Candace was always quick to respond to any questions I had.  Will definitely be staying here again when I'm in Seattle.  Thanks so much, Candace!!"
793629,8908481,2013-11-25,4249422,Maria,"My mom and I had a wonderful stay in Candace's home. The house was clean and warm when we arrived. The kitchen was well-stocked and, after a quick trip to the grocery store down the street, we were able to cook a full Thanksgiving dinner no problem. It was great having the light rail train right down the street--we could go into downtown Seattle as we pleased. We loved our stay here!!"
793629,9010199,2013-12-01,720859,Erin,"Nice place.  Quiet, set back from the road.  Hosts super responsive and accommodating.  Great location to lightrail and grocery store.  Just what we needed for our stay.  "
793629,9081775,2013-12-05,9849379,Allison,"What a delightful confection of a home! Warm, cozy, inviting, and full of thoughtful and whimsical touches (i.e. the claw foot tub actually has clawed feet, and the beaming moon above the bed allows you to turn off the overhead light without having to get up). The kitchen is a (well-equipped) dream, which is extra nice, given the house's proximity to the fantastic Red Apple Market. With a light rail station a stone's throw away, this house is great for those traveling without a car (as I was). The neighborhood feels safe and friendly, and, despite the nearby hustle and bustle, the home itself is tranquil and quiet (yes, you can hear train sounds, but I found them soothing—who can begrudge a passing train?). 

Candace was a joy to deal with, extremely responsive and attentive, despite the time and distance that separated us. A minor glitch with my stay was summarily and satisfactorily resolved. 

Another plus: while Beacon Hill may not be the destination neighborhood that some of the others are, it's certainly not without its own unique charms and (website hidden) del Corso, with its transcendent wood-fired pizzas, is not to be missed. All in all, a fabulous first airbnb experience! I can't recommend the cheery house highly enough. It was so pleasant that I frankly sort of opted out of exploring Seattle on my last day in favor of staying home—and it was actually sunny outside! Thank you, Candace! 
"
793629,9266824,2013-12-17,9466303,Stein,"This was just great! We arrived at a very comfortable, well kept house with a perfect location for our Seattle visit. Questions were answered quickly and accurately and we can highly recommend this venue. THANKS!"
793629,9558594,2014-01-02,884185,Jorge & Emmy Lou,"We had such a wonderful getaway at this adorable little house!  Candace was the perfect hostess (even from so far away) and responded to all of our questions promptly & thoroughly.  All of her instructions were so thorough as well - it made everything so easy!  

The house really does look like a dollhouse & the wooden countertops & lots of windows made it feel very open, while the colourful couches and carpet gave it a cosy feel as well.  The kitchen was so well-equipped - there weren't any utensils or appliances that we lacked when we were using it, and it was so nice to have some cooking basics left for us!

Candace also gave us some wonderful recommendations for restaurants/attractions.  She was very sweet and thoughtful with her responses even when there were some minor issues during our stay.  We appreciated her kindness so much and would certainly stay here again and recommend it to others! :)  Thank you again, Candace!"
793629,9688306,2014-01-05,359288,Marty,"I can't imagine why a person would be anything but wowed by the opportunity to have such an ideal lodging available for a stay in Seattle.  Candace's house is not only as cheery as she states, when Karen walked through the door (even at nearly midnight after a very long flight) she remarked, ""it's so darling!""  I agree, it's a perfect getaway for two; the interior shows fine craftsmanship and the furnishings are in very good taste.  The home is located in a quiet and safe neighborhood.

If you plan to take advantage of the opportunity to prepare some meals on your own, the kitchen is the the best outfitted that we have seen at a vacation home in terms of quality cookware, utensils and appliances.  Hands down.  The location is great, easily accessed, there are nearby markets and eateries (check out Baja Bistro for breakfast) and it is a quick drive to Little Saigon, Pike Street Market, the ferry terminal, etc.  There was readily available parking for our rental car and I noticed that there is nearby access to public transportation.  

Since I am a light sleeper, I was concerned that there is a freeway some blocks away, a train depot about a 3/4 of a mile off, etc. but I found that the freeway is completely inaudible and the train whistles were a very distant thing, just as we experience at home in Anchorage, Alaska.

Almost all of our travel out of Alaska is routed through Seattle, so we often choose to stay over on our way home so as to visit friends and enjoy so vibrant a city.  

From here forward, Candace's place will be our #1choice of accommodations. 

"
793629,10077933,2014-01-29,10103349,Courtney,Candace's place is even more beautiful than the photos! The house was very clean and the kitchen was equipped with everything you could need. In my five night stay we made many trips to the market just around the corner (quite literally) and even better it's just a short drive to Seattle which is where we spent much of our days. Candace was also very quick to respond about everything even with such a time difference. This will definitely be my first option for future trips here! 
793629,10738941,2014-03-05,426355,Mike,"This place was superb, IMO. Not only was the interior nice & equipped with everything you'd need (wifi, cooking basics, tv), but the location couldn't have been better for our needs: walk to the grocery store, walk to any number of restaurants, grab coffee or delicious hot chocolate at The Station coffee shop, etc. The best thing for us was that this place is close to the light rail station, which takes you into downtown (the 60 bus picks up at basically the same spot & takes you into Capitol Hill). I think we spent a total of maybe $35 in travel costs on our 7 day trip, which was only possible because of the great location which renders car rentals totally optional.

And best of all, Candance was extremely professional, communicative, and has managed to keep the house very clean. Before we left, she provided us a packet of info about the various appliances, and other misc things to keep in mind. She was accessible if we needed her or the property manager, and expressed genuine concern that we were comfortable & satisfied. Please don't hesitate to reserve this adorable cottage!   "
793629,10900412,2014-03-12,4341930,Karen,This was our second visit  to Cheery Seattle House and it was another good experience. It is a very comfortable and cozy place to stay. Candace is delightful to work with and we can't wait to visit again! Love Beacon Hill neighborhood. Karen
793629,11125024,2014-03-22,10158020,Wendy,"We really enjoyed staying at this adorable little home! It felt bright, cozy and welcoming. I enjoyed the clawfoot tub and the full kitchen.

Great location, diverse neighbourhood, close to a grocery store, and a few restaurants (we enjoyed an Indian meal at the Travelers Thali House). A short walk to the LRT train to downtown. Easy access to the I-5 for getting around by car. There was some general city noise at night, planes, trains and cars, but it didn't bother me. Even as a sound- sensitive person, I slept well.

I appreciated Candace's detailed information and responsiveness.

Overall, a fantastic airbnb experience!"
793629,12221418,2014-04-26,14203229,Jessica,"House was absolutely lovely - perfect for a couple. Candace's instructions for getting into the property were very clear and there's a good set of further instructions / information once inside the house.  House was very clean and well equipped. There was no off street parking but Candace did provide us with a pass for parking right outside the house. Location was great -- it was close to the train station which takes you quickly into downtown Seattle.  Also, about one minutes' walk away, there is a viewing area with the most amazing view of downtown Seattle!  All in all, I wouldn't hesitate to recommend Candace or this property."
793629,12901852,2014-05-13,1555501,Brooke,I loved staying here with my 3 year old daughter...  Candace was so accomodating (even putting out extra toys for her + making up a cute toddler bed on the floor)  The house was immaculate + such a perfect + warm homey place to stay.  Will definitely be back again!
793629,13306687,2014-05-25,1897805,Andrea,We enjoyed our stay in Seattle and the house was exactly as described. Candace sent us extremely detailed instructions that covered everything we needed to know. There is nothing much of in the way of restaurants in the immediate area but there is a good local supermarket within 5 mins walking distance and downtown Seattle is not far away. The bus and train stations are very close as well. We would definitely stay here again if we return to Seattle. 
793629,15032058,2014-07-01,11463039,Morgan,This place is very cute and equipped with all you need. It was perfect for my partner and I for a short weekend in Seattle!
793629,15212438,2014-07-05,9940257,Elisa,"Candace was very easy to work with; this was my first official Air BNB stay, and it was amazing!  The house, amenities, and neighborhood were exactly as described, and the house manual didn't leave room for any questions.  

We used the Cheery House as a place to rest and relax, and spent most of our time with family in the city, so I can't speak to restaurants or other fun things to do in the area.  There was a minor issue with the washer, but a quick internet search gave us a work around.  

We will definitely be staying again!"
793629,15490361,2014-07-10,14583462,Amber,"The house was indeed cheery! It was so cute and we'd definitely return if we're ever in Seattle again. The lightrail was easy to access as Candace said though we might have stayed closer to downtown so we could walk to more of the attractions. We did choose to stay here because I needed to do laundry after being out a week on the trail. Unfortunately the washer doesn't work properly and had we known, we would have booked elsewhere. That said, Candace tried to help (from Europe- communication was a bit tough because of that- 9 hour time zone difference) but couldn't do much from so far away. I think she mentioned they will be back in Seattle in 3 weeks so hopefully after that the washer will be usable again. Otherwise, everything was great!"
793629,15747509,2014-07-15,12929177,Sara,Candace was great to work with. She was responsive and answered my many questions quickly. We did have one small issue when we arrived but it was handled fairly quickly and Candace called the next day to follow up and apologize. The house was nice and worked well for what we needed. We happened to be in Seattle during a very warm week and there isn't air conditioning in the home so it did get uncomfortable a few evenings and nights. Luckily there were a couple fans that made it tolerable. She had everything we needed for our toddler to be comfortable too. Overall I think this was a great experience and would stay again (when it's a little cooler there).
793629,16199761,2014-07-23,14170674,Tsuyoshi,"We loved the cheery house so much that we didn't want to leave. We had our 15 months old daughter with us and the stay was perfect, especially since Candace provided us with a toddler bed and high chair to make our traveling easy.
Although living overseas, Candace was always fast in replying and gave us plenty of information beforehand so that we could easily adjust to the house.
The location of this house is perfect, conveniently located near downtown but not within the chaos of downtown. We rented a car and having the guest pass available to us was greatly appreciated. Lake Washington is close by car and it was amazing to go there and walk with our daughter in the early evenings.
The neighborhood is very quiet, but it is on the path of airplanes landing to SEATAC airport. I love planes so it was a great scenery for me. (The noise from it is not that bad, an average city sound.)
There were several supermarkets conveniently located so we could go purchase necessities and relax at home. Having a full kitchen and laundry/dryer were a big plus, especially with a messy children.
Overall, I would return to this place when we return to Seattle."
793629,16605362,2014-07-30,14058185,Lydia,This house was in a Good location.  This was our first time in Seattle and this was a great place to stay that was nice and quiet but located in a central area.  Candace let me know in advance who to call and what to do when I got there and there was a very good handbook located in the house.  The living room and kitchen were good sized and the bedroom accommodated me and my two children.  There was a bit of a mixup with the washer but Candace handled it subsequent to our stay.  Overall a good value and I would stay here again.
793629,18012354,2014-08-20,6367914,Elizabeth,"Candace's house was perfect for us.  Very cheery indeed and well stocked with everything we needed.  Best of all was location - just a couple of blocks walk to the supermarket and (more importantly) the train station.

There were always planes flying over, which took some getting used to, but that seems to be true of everywhere in Seattle. 

If we're ever back in Seattle, we'd definitely book with Candace again."
793629,18414171,2014-08-26,17836318,Ka Ho,Candace was a very nice host. She reminded me everything. She even gave me a lot of useful information for me when I first arrived the house. The house was very lovely and warm. It is perfect for couple to stay. The house location is very convenience. It is very easy to get to everywhere. Bus and light rail are two block away. Very very nice house and host. Thank you for giving me a great experience.
793629,18941581,2014-09-03,1329978,Bill,"Though compact, this is an exceptionally light and airy space that has been skillfully and gracefully restored and upgraded as a comfortable retreat for maximum ease of use as a base of operation for exploring Seattle. Extremely convenient to downtown via car, and two blocks from commuter rail station (and, if you are a sports fan, just two stops away from the football and baseball stadiums). Candace has anticipated all of a travelers essential needs, including eco-friendly toiletries and all the appliances one might desire. Comfortable futon-style bed and user-friendly shower are also plusses. An open front porch and large front yard invite spending time outside. Only one thing to be aware of for those with physical limitations--the house sits quite far back from and above street level, so negotiating almost a full flight stairs is necessary for access.  "
793629,19037237,2014-09-05,19596723,Ebony,"My stay at the Cheery Seattle House was a enjoyable. If you are looking to stay in a cozy cottage style home, in a trendy yet quiet neighborhood close to downtown, then this may be the place for you. This was my first time using airbnb and I must admit this place has set the standard for future airbnb stays. Thanks Candace!  "
793629,19362677,2014-09-11,9370563,Tim Oliver,Candace was a greate host. She prepared our stay perfect. We got a manual for absolutely everything. The house was very clean and everything what we needed was available. The house is located in a very quiet and clean neighbourhood. We stayed there for three nights and would definitely stay there again. Thank you again Candace that we could stay in your house.
793629,19691384,2014-09-16,20364751,Judy,"Candace was very welcoming, and kept in touch with me prior to my stay and also checked in with me on my first day at the house to see if I needed anything, or if I had any questions.  The Beacon Hill neighborhood is nice, and I appreciated how easy it was to get from the airport to this area.  There were local restaurants nearby and light rail access was very close.  I loved all the vintage homes in the area. For those with children, or those visiting grandchildren, there is a wonderful community park nearby. The Cheery Seattle house was very comfortable. I definitely will book another stay at this home."
793629,19877217,2014-09-20,15206391,Svenja,"This cute and light-flooded house is an amazing place! We had a great time there. It was very clean, an important fact for us. There is a Washer and a Dryer, a full equipped Kitchen with everything you need and more. You only have to walk a few minutes to a supermarket. All the highlights from seattle are not far away. 
We have a baby, so in some locations its not so easy for us to stay. But Candace make it easy for us. There were a highchair, toys, cutlery and some things more for kids. Thats great! Candace give us all the informations we need, she is a brillant Host. Thank you for the great stay!"
793629,20100885,2014-09-23,4762664,Marnie,"Wonderful little space for two in Seattle! The home is cozy and inviting, Candace was wonderfully responsive to the two inquiries we had while there.

Even better, it's located very close to some great venues for dinner and drinks and it's a $10 uber ride to downtown.

"
793629,20305437,2014-09-27,20779490,Emma,This cheery house was just as described! It was bright and cheery and comfortably decorated. We had a great time during our stay in Seattle and this house was just down the block from the light rail station making it super east to get into downtown. We were out and about most of the day so did not spend too much time at the house but from the short time we were there it seemed to have everything we would have needed to eat and cook. Thanks again Candace for sharing your wonderful house!
793629,20413579,2014-09-29,17746032,David,"Very charming cottage, Candace was a true pleasure to work with, very responsive and personable.  Great amenities and central location.  Would definitely stay here again.  Appreciated the use of the high chair and toddler bed as well."
793629,20706577,2014-10-04,20914723,Carrie Moea,What a cozy little house! It was perfect for our short stay in Seattle. We were exploring many of the neighborhoods in the city and found the location to be fairly central to make it around town. The availability of small things like toiletries was a nice touch. Our host was super responsive and we had a packet of information for everything from parking to how to work the shower head. Very thorough!
793629,21222542,2014-10-13,21272172,Vincent,"The cheery house and Candace were both great and met all my expectations. She left great directions, was helpful when checking in and when we had small questions. There were no surpises and it turned our first airbnb experience into a great one. I would recommend this home to anyone. "
793629,21470238,2014-10-18,19990481,Trevor,We had a great time in this little house.  It has great access to the Seattle light rail and the I-5.  It was a lovely warm place with a great kitchen.  It was a lovely trip.
793629,21640989,2014-10-20,1446956,Zach,Candace was a great host!  I loved staying here.  The neighborhood is great with really unique and amazing restaurants all within walking distance.  Never even needed to go downtown.  Her house was part of my marriage proposal and she said yes!
793629,22319477,2014-11-03,22421171,Kary,"Great little place in a convenient location. It's definitely an old school little house, creaky floors and all, but it's been wonderfully updated in the right ways. The pictures are totally true to life! Would be great to cook in (we didn't really make use of the kitchen because we were gone most of the time), as it's well-stocked with kitchen tools and gadgets-- a money saver if you're staying long-term. Comes with a parking pass to park on-street in front of the property, which is super convenient. Loved that it was so close to the light rail, where you can get a day pass for $4 a person-- takes you as far north as Westlake Center, and from there you can hit the monorail to visit the Space Needle and all that's around it (visit the Chihuly exhibit, it's truly awesome!) if you came to tour. We took Uber and Lyft cars to Capitol Hill and it ran around $8-10 each way. The neighborhood is very safe feeling and the neighbors are super quiet-- the only noise that was noticeable was the air traffic-- however, it's hard to escape air traffic in South Seattle. Just be aware if you're a light sleeper. Candace was an awesome host and was very easy to get in contact with. She gave us a very comprehensive house manual that made everything easy. This was a great experience for us, being our first time using Airbnb! "
793629,22460973,2014-11-07,4120253,Charles,"Candace was very present for us every step of the way..
The house was very clean and Candace's instructions 
were detailed and helpful. The downside was lack of window
covering in the kitchen and main room, but not a big issue.
Candace advised the coverings are coming soon..
We also advise you to be careful in the batch, it is long
step down for us older people from the bath to floor.
Recommend it highly especially if you want to use the 
kitchen a lot which was completely ready for whatever
level of cooking you wish to do."
793629,22597471,2014-11-10,17892513,Leslee And Lincoln,"This was our first time using Airbnb and we couldn't have had a better experience. There's nothing like being on vacation and waking up feeling like you're home. Candace's house was cozy, charming and in the perfect location. The next time we're in Seattle we hope to reserve the ""Cheery Seattle House"" again :) Thank you so much Candace!!"
793629,23070863,2014-11-22,23009487,Eleanora,"Yes, Candance was helpful every step of the way!  We were close to downtown Seattle, which made it convenient.  Only recommendation I have would have would be to put a small coffee table or end table between the two couches so guests can put snacks and coffee cups on while sitting in the living room. The rooms themselves look a lot larger on line, but it's a perfect little cottage for 2 people only. We enjoyed staying there."
793629,23195394,2014-11-24,23216716,Keeley,Great place. Very comfy and cozy and clean. Only a 2 block walk to the underground for transportation- the Seahawks stadium is only 2 stops away. Downtown and pikes market and the waterfront are all so close! Great communication from Candace the host. I'd recommend to everyone and would stay here again when visiting Seattle. 
793629,23415979,2014-11-30,8688006,Robert & Cathy,"We loved staying at this cozy, comfortable house. We booked at the last minute and the host was in contact with us right away. Everything was clean and ready for our arrival. Parking was very convenient and we enjoyed walking to a nearby restaurant Oak Tavern. As recommended. Only surprise was a recurring train whistle, but it was far away and not an intrusive sound. We will definitely come back on our next visit!"
793629,23915965,2014-12-14,457714,Bruce,"Candace was very prompt and a delight to work with.  Her house was everything we needed. It was very clean, with lots of character and all the kitchenware we would likely ever need in a vacation rental.  There are peek-a-boo views of downtown, West Seattle, and the snow covered Olympic mountains.   We really liked having a grocery store, restaurants and the Link light-rail station within four blocks. I only hope the Cheery Seattle House is available for my next visit. "
793629,24089386,2014-12-19,906742,Kim,"Candace was fantastic and their home is lovely. The house is small, but had everything necessary. The neighborhood was quiet and is within walking distance to the light rail and a wonderful local grocery. Highly recommend!"
793629,24736386,2015-01-02,23806802,Daniel,"We stayed in this home for two weeks over the December 2014 holiday season, and were very pleased with it.  It is a cozy little house, close to the Seattle light rail, a grocery store, and some nice places to eat (try Acorn for great hamburgers and beers!).  We were grateful for the well set-up kitchen and small but nicely configured family room, as well as having a washer/drier.  A lovely place at a very reasonable price -- and the owners were wonderful to work with, happy to answer all of our questions quickly, as well as providing a thorough instruction booklet to ensure we made full use of their home while in Seattle."
793629,25106362,2015-01-06,2059054,Vena,"Perfect, adorable house. It was exactly what we needed, and wonderfully appointed. We like to be able to cook when we stay places, and the kitchen had everything. It's a great spot!"
793629,25281899,2015-01-11,23200475,Christine,"Candace was a wonderful host and her home was beautiful. Instructions were clear, communication was on point, and the house was super close to public transportation and had every amenity we needed. We would stay here again in a heartbeat! "
793629,25369298,2015-01-13,14753604,Callista,"The was very cozy, and just right for the two of us.  It is very conveniently located - minutes away from the grocery store and light rail station.  Candace answered our questions quickly and was very helpful.  We would definitely stay there again."
793629,25552874,2015-01-19,25045152,Mesay,"We stayed here for 4 nights. The location is close enough to down town Seattle without having to pay street parking fees. We found the house as we expected. All cooking essentials including oil, salt  . . . etc available in the house. All in all, it is a great house in quiet residential area. Worked out flawlessly for us. "
793629,25764537,2015-01-25,2852653,Carlos,"Super cute, comfortable and clean house, with a well equipped and functional kitchen, nice bed and lovely bathroom with a claw foot tube and period bathroom.
House is perfect for 2, very private and a lovely getaway.  Highly recommend it."
793629,26271627,2015-02-08,26821147,Gaya,"Candace's house was great for us (myself, husband and 1.5 yr daughter). She gave us detailed directions and information on parks, restaurants and things to do with our daughter prior to our stay. The location is close to downtown and easily accessible. The bathroom and kitchen were fully stocked with amenities as well. Knowing that we were travelling with our daughter, Candace left us a toddler mattress and toys. The house is comfy and cozy, perfect for one person, couple or family with 1 child. "
793629,26677442,2015-02-17,24012614,Leo,"Cherry Seattle House is a cute little cottage with a fabulous kitchen.  The Beacon Hill neighborhood is also very nice, quiet, easily accessible and with a market just down the street."
793629,27658113,2015-03-09,8783702,Amanda,We had a great time in Seattle. This had much to do with our accommodations. Candace's place was exactly as described and she was an excellent host. Although we didn't have the pleasure of meeting face to face. Communication as well as instructions for the home well all top notch. We plan to travel to Seattle again very soon and will be looking her up again :) 
793629,27907945,2015-03-14,15380718,Yingying,lovely house！ and positive respond！Pretty nice neighborhood and near to several restaurant and grocery store！Candace is also pretty nice
793629,28130730,2015-03-18,4724049,Lauren,The house was lovely. It is set back from the street and very private. The area is quiet and mostly residential. There are a couple places to eat/drink in the area but mostly just a calm neighborhood not too far from downtown. The house was just as described and had everything we needed for our stay. The market nearby had anything else you could want. The proximity to the light rail made traveling around the city and to/from the airport very easy. We hope we can make it back to Seattle soon and will definitely try to stay here again. 
793629,28612644,2015-03-27,28495829,Pamela,Overall a great place to stay.Candace was super quick to resolve any problems we had and refunded us for the stay since the water wasn't working. The contact house keeper in the orange folder was super kind and helpful too.  
793629,28940490,2015-04-01,2059054,Vena,This our second stay - just as lovely as the first. Very well appointed and great location. Candice is responsive and the house has got great kid amenities.

The location was great -within walking distance to breakfast places, grocery store, public transit and coffee shops. Candace is a fantastic host- very responsive and accommodating! Hope to be invited to stay again! "
793629,30095438,2015-04-17,30368207,Yang,"It was great experience! The house is good fit for two people, everything we need is included, and near downtown, 10~15 min drive. And I got quick response from Candace, they are so nice and kind! Highly recommended!"
793629,30743230,2015-04-26,1996078,Sally K.,"What a great little house!  We found it easily, slept deeply and enjoyed it completely!
I love the way its been renovated; modern and efficient without losing the charm of a little old cabin on top of a hill.
Thanks! "
793629,32296242,2015-05-16,31806651,Matt,"Thoroughly enjoyed my stay. Candace was very responsive to my questions about the home, the area, and transportation. The neighborhood was very quaint and quiet, with easy access to the link light rail to get into downtown Seattle within about 10 minutes and the fare is very cheap even for an all day pass.For someone looking for a more personal touch, and quiet location with easy accessibility to all that downtown Seattle has to offer, then this is the place. The home was very clean, cozy, and comfortable. There were no surprises (which is a good thing), it is just as described on the host page. There is even a view of downtown buildings from the front yard on a clear day. I enjoyed my stay and would definitely consider staying here again on any future trips to Seattle. There is also a nice little market just across the street from the light rail station which I used several times."
793629,32677285,2015-05-20,27847951,Elizabeth,"This accommodation is as nice as the pictures and description claim!  Great location, cozy/comfortable accommodation, amazing views.  It is clear that the hosts really care about the property and the experience of their guests.  We had a few unexpected problems in the kitchen, but we did hear back from the hosts.  As we expect the kitchen issues will be fully resolved, we highly recommend it!"
793629,33093131,2015-05-25,29894186,Amanda,We loved the house. It was clean and had everything you might need. It was really close to the light rail and made for a quick and easy trip downtown. We will definitely come back again.

793629,35385525,2015-06-18,28484136,Kc,This place was a cute little house and enjoy our stay. Wish there were curtains for the big windows in the living room though. 
793629,35590602,2015-06-20,16431724,Leah,"My boyfriend and I stayed at Candace's house for two days this past weekend.  The photos are spot on!  It's an adorable, cozy home in the quiet neighborhood of Beacon Hill.  The house was well-stocked with extra bedding, toiletries, kitchen supplies and more.  The location of the home is also great; just a 10-15 minute drive to downtown, and there are several restaurants and bars within walking distance.  

Candace checked in on us to make sure everything was going okay, which was very thoughtful.  Overall, we had a really wonderful stay!  "

793629,39404131,2015-07-23,1007607,Graciela,"We have great time at Candance place. The cottage is charming, bright and cozy, in a very quiet neighborhood and only three blocks from the train station, ten minutes to downtown area. Good location and easy  to come back and rest after an intense day.
Candance was very nice and responsive to our questions and gave quick solutions to small inconveniences. The cleaning lady was extremely helpful as well.
Overall, we recommend the cottage as a very good quality/price alternative to visit Seattle."
793629,45472438,2015-09-03,37102665,Austin,"I ended up staying at this lovely, small little home for a week as an alternative to getting a hotel while attending PAX Prime, located at the Washington State Convention Center. I am very happy that I did, because it ended up being much better than a local hotel. The host was incredible in keeping in touch with me, handling any questions I had extremely fast (also extremely nice). The cleaning lady is super friendly as well. 

Pictures  and description of the house are completely accurate. Bed was comfortable. Has all normal house things - silver wear, bathroom needs, plates, etc. Everything was clean. Neighborhood is great, close to mostly everything you need within walking distance. I just had an awesome stay! There will be future trips I take to Washington, and I will definitely consider staying here again. "

The view of the city is great and the location is very convenient for traveling to the city or to the mountains.  The parking pass was very helpful and we never had trouble finding a spot.  Thank you Candace for being a helpful and responsible host. "

793629,47483589,2015-09-19,8691325,Molly,"My husband and I loved loved loved Candace's cherry little home. Candace laid everything out for us prior to our stay, so we had no need to contact her while we were there. The house itself is very homey and inviting and is in a very cute neighborhood. Close proximity to grocery store, coffee shops, restaurants, and public transit. Wish we could have stayed longer. "
793629,48168268,2015-09-24,35965481,Christie,We went to Seattle for the first time and stayed for the first time in Candace's cute little airbnb house. The views out the front window and bedroom are beautiful. The little table in front is perfect for a lunch with a view. We spent little time in Seattle choosing to check out as much as we could. The house is convenient to everything. Candace was very responsive to all questions. It was a much better choice than a hotel.
793629,48420422,2015-09-26,3336152,Jenni,"Absolutely loved Candace's home! Cute, cozy cottage about 10 mins from downtown and very clean. Great places around the area too. Parking was easy and she was easy to communicate with. Thanks again!"
793629,48997489,2015-09-30,35314494,Justin,Great place. Exactly as described. If you go be sure stop for a coffee and pastry at Fresh Flours only a block or two up the road. Thanks Candace 
793629,49972267,2015-10-08,33065161,Dan,"Cheery Seattle House was exactly as Candace described it - great access to downtown Seattle via the train, great neighborhood, a grocery store a block away, and a great view!  The house was clean, cozy, and a really nice place to come ""home"" to after a full day.  This will definitely be a regular stop of us.

The instructions, directions, and set up of the hose were exactly as Candace described it and it is evident that she takes care of not only the home, but her relationships with her neighbors.  We felt very comfortable and at home."
793629,50285243,2015-10-11,10279890,Cassie,"The Beacon Hill house is great! It's perfect for two guests staying in Seattle. It's right on the light rail and conveniently located near a grocery store. It's stocked with everything you need for a comfortable stay. No doubt, we'll request to stay here every time we visit Seattle. My husband and I loved it! "

793629,52037067,2015-10-26,28513617,Karen,"The ""Cheery Seattle House with View"" was just as described & pictured.  It is in a quiet residential neighborhood, that was close to downtown yet with a sense of being ""above it all"", with views of SODO and downtown.  The house itself was small but felt spacious because of all the windows that gave views of city & sky: there was a large kitchen, a small living room and a decent size bedroom & bathroom (accessible through bedroom).  The heating system worked well, the TV/wifi/internet/netflix all worked.  Convenient grocery 2 blocks away; good bakery 3 blocks away; and other stores & restaurants accessible by car.  One big plus for me was that I could get around the city without going on the crowded freeways...either driving or by light rail/bus.   "
793629,54420015,2015-11-19,9189583,Alexei,beautiful home. Candace was very easy to communicate with. would recommend for 1 or 2 ppl looking for a quiet place in South Seattle.
793629,54862401,2015-11-25,28260701,Phillip,"Candace made us feel welcomed and prepared us for the trip by giving notes and providing all of the needed information in a folder that was easily accessible when we got to her house. 
The house was accurately described, a perfect space for my wife and I. The neighborhood was in a great location -- close to Fresh Flours and a very short drive from downtown. We rented a car for the trip because we visited a friend on Whidbey Island. so we never used the light rail, but my wife (originally from Seattle) noted how close we were to the station and how convenient it would be.
Candace provided plenty of amenities - coffee, tea, honey, snacks, towels, and soaps. There were toiletry items available in case we'd forgotten a tooth brush or razor and such, and though they weren't needed it stood out to me. I appreciated her thought. Instructions were detailed and walked through the espresso maker, parking with the hang tag, trash, and just about everything involved.
The bed was a little uncomfortable and stiff, but not enough to compromise our overall experience."
2298775,11839081,2014-04-16,3929249,Keith,"What an amazing place to stay in Seattle: a rural farm in the city! It's such a joy to walk into this oasis and to leave the hustle and bustle behind you. It is like going back to another, more peaceful era. And the home itself is full of wonderful family history, comfort and simple joy. Lee and Steve are generous and goodnatured hosts, warmhearted and progressively working towards a sustainable future for themselves and their local community. A great source of information about what is truly good about Seattle and Seattlelites. "
2298775,13610728,2014-06-01,13266408,Emad,"Lee and Steve are nice family.
They respect my privacy so much, they check me daily if i need any thing,
Am talkibg about month not days or week.
I extend my stay one month more."
2298775,15592687,2014-07-12,16723877,Cassie,"I really enjoyed staying with Lee and Steve. They were very welcoming but also gave me as much personal space as I needed. My room was very clean, spacious and comfortable. I loved walking through the surrounding garden and seeing all of the delicious food and beautiful flowers they are growing. The house is in a quiet neighborhood with a very short walk to the bus stop. Lee and Steve are kind and authentic people and I really appreciated their hospitality. "
2298775,16228492,2014-07-23,17734779,Alice,"We had a great stay here, it's nice to be so close to the city - a 20/30 min bus ride away - whilst feeling like you're in the country. The house is very comfy and Lee and Steve are incredibly hospitable, also the fresh veg from the garden was delicious. "
2298775,16811851,2014-08-02,16260473,Rachel,The house is in a really cool location - it feels like you are on a private farm far out of the city but it's actually just at the very end of long driveway on a dead-end street. Steve was easy to communicate with and very welcoming. Our room was comfortable and we had everything we needed.
2298775,18261930,2014-08-24,18144125,Joe,Lee and Steve were amazing hosts. Their house was exactly as described and it was just as charming as you would expect. Their place felt like a home away from home. Were I not moving to Seattle permanently I would check availability here before any other place. Both the place and the hosts were unforgettable.
2298775,19105732,2014-09-06,18643953,Ana,"I really loved staying here. The garden is amazing, Lee and Steve are funny, warm, wonderful people, and the house is beautiful and peaceful. There are bus stops nearby and it's not too far from the university or downtown. I felt completely at home here, and would come back in a heartbeat. Thank you so much!"
2298775,21279498,2014-10-14,4573490,Sara,"We stayed with Lee and Steve for a month and had a wonderful time. They're both incredibly friendly and warm and made sure we had everything we needed and gave us great neighborhood and city recommendations. The location is perfect- you feel like you're on a farm in the country, but you're actually a quick drive from the city and have access to bus lines and restaurants nearby. The house and room are very cozy, and as a bonus, they have the world's sweetest dog. We would recommend this place to anyone, especially travelers doing long stays. "
2298775,21684818,2014-10-21,22411294,Melissa,"It was a cozy and safe place to stay. Off on a nice secluded road, but still close enough to everything. Lee and Steve were very nice down to earth people."
2298775,25682171,2015-01-23,18228010,Robert,"What a wonderful place!  Thank you, Lee and Steve, for making me so welcome and offering your home as a friendly refuge. I loved being in this beautiful, country-like setting but accessible to everything by bus and nearby a friend's house.  Lee and Steve were gracious and generous, helping me get oriented, allowing me privacy, and sharing their homemade bread, jams, tea, and affectionate dog with me.  I look forward to staying there again when I return to Seattle in the summer.    "
2298775,27314729,2015-03-02,5565147,Olivia,"We loved staying with Lee and Steve! While the house is in the heart of the Maple Leaf neighborhood, it is also tranquil and quiet. The double room is as described with a dresser and desk, which was great to work at. 
The house is easy biking distance from the U-district and walking distance from the ""center"" of Maple Leaf. We loved nearby Reckless Video store. The kitchen provides a nice communal space for everyone, including Toby, the lovable border collie. 
Lee and Steve gave us a ton of great recommendations on places to explore with our bikes, from Redhook Brewery to Ballard.
They are caring and attentive to their guests and also make sure guests have their own space.
We highly recommend this lovely place!
"
2298775,28940929,2015-04-01,20398017,Daniel,"Lee and Steve made us feel right at home! They are super friendly and really nice to be around, always fun to talk to. They always offered recommendations on places to visit and restaurants to eat at. And their doggy, Toby, is the friendliest dog! It's a lot of fun to play Toby, he's got so much energy!
The room we stayed at is really clean and spacious. The house is really comfortable and feels nicely secluded, with lots of trees and space, specially when playing with Toby. The neighborhood is nice and quiet, with grocery stores within biking distance. The house is also really close to quiet streets and biking routes, so it's easy to come and go with a bike or a car. 
Really great hosts and wonderful place to stay at!"
2298775,33541573,2015-05-29,30065950,Rebecca,"Very welcoming home with an amazing organic garden.  Lee, Steve and Toby (the dog) create a wonderful community atmosphere!"
2298775,37215536,2015-07-05,23103815,Anouschka,"Wonderful place and nice people, I would highly recommend it if you like peace and quiet."
2298775,37973765,2015-07-12,30943752,Amy,"Lee and Steve made us feel very welcome, and Toby too! We enjoyed wandering around the property after a busy day and relaxing among the gardens. They were very helpful when we needed it, and respected our privacy when we needed it. We will definitely stay again. "
2298775,38240944,2015-07-13,1794926,Gary,"Lee and Steve were so warm and friendly!  We even got to meet some of their friends, family, and pets, who were equally welcoming.  Their place is cozy and quirky – truly a one-of-a-kind experience!"
2298775,39063384,2015-07-20,11405602,Sang Hee,"Lee and Steve were extraordinary hosts. We were very pleased to stay in their lovely home and to get to know them. Their dog Toby is the most gentle and loving border collie with an unforgettable personality. The house is located near a bus stop which is where we started our travels around town. The room was spacious with charming furnishings and a very, very comfy bed. The land where they grow various fruits and vegetables (which Lee kindly offers to the guests) is lush and picturesque. We almost didn't want to go anywhere because it was so cozy to hang around the house. Lee and Steve were kind and thoughtful, and gave us our privacy when needed/great advice for sights to see/and lovely conversations. Lee even drove us to the airport which we really appreciated. We loved their place and would recommend it to everyone we know. Thank you for everything!"
2298775,47382969,2015-09-18,34543224,Robert,Lee & Steve were very kind hosts. They have a beautiful garden and it was a lot like being on a farm rather than the city. Very peaceful and laid back. They also have a lot of valuable information on the area. I will certainly being staying again next time im in the area
2298775,47706498,2015-09-21,20613361,Ben,"Staying with Lee and Steve feels like being in the country, even though their home is in the midst of Seattle. Their home in its setting is quiet, peaceful, rural and lush, a refuge in the city. They are open, warm and welcoming, and I had full use of the facilities of the house. Looking forward to returning, when the opportunity arises."
2298775,48039504,2015-09-22,18214888,Anneke,What a little paradise and peaceful place. Our stay was just too short. Definitely recommended.
2298775,48719813,2015-09-28,26919864,Kristin,"Lee and Steve are very sweet. They shared their supper with me, and gave me a ride in the morning. It was a was a very peaceful place to be, and the surroundings are beautiful."
2298775,52316875,2015-10-28,22561453,A,"I stayed with them for a month. Overall, I think they are nice people doing the best they can. However, I experienced them not being comfortable with me using the kitchen on a daily basis. I was surprised to hear from them that other long term guests did not cook regularly. I tried my best to cook every 5-6 days; cook before Lee would start her kitchen. These methods were helpful, but not a lot. I always felt not welcome in the kitchen space and would always walk on egg shells.
Perhaps they have been hosts for a long time, and I feel they are burned out. I say so as I am going to share some of the instances. 
There was an issue with the bath towel. I changed my towel position in the bathroom from a hook to a place I could spread it out (it was damp). Many evenings when Lee came from work; she would be overwhelmed, and I would try to stay clear. I mentioned it to her next morning. She screamed, had a very angry look, snatched my and other neighboring towels, and accused me of using other towels. I had to defend myself saying that I only used my towel. She apologized later; but clearly I did not expect such behavior from a host.
The utensils to heat food for guests were 2 steel pots only. And we were two guests staying there. Last weekend, she had invited guests, and used both the pots in the afternoon. I had no pot to heat my food. I asked when would be an appropriate time to heat my dinner (I was considerate as she had guests that night), and she said 5:00 pm, to which I disagreed. If I had two Airbnb guests, and limited kitchen space; I would either not invite additional guests, or not take in two long term Airbnb guests, but that is me. That night I requested I close the kitchen door after dinner, as I had to get up early next day. The air was clearly filled with tension; I could see they did not like my request. Surprisingly, the laughter and noise got louder after the request. I wondered why I had requested in the first place.
Additionally, there was no dishwasher or microwave. Heating in the microwave would be helpful, as it would reduce the time and energy washing the pots. The bus stops were up and down the steep hill. So if one does not drive, getting groceries by bus and walk is not an easy task. 
I cannot speak for short term. But if one decides to stay long term and walk to get the groceries, and use the kitchen on a daily basis, this may not be the best place. 
Finally, Toby was a wonderful dog. Outside issues around the kitchen, towel etc., I think they are basically good people, but are too overwhelmed. They could perhaps not include kitchen in amenities for long-term guests.
"
2298775,54545978,2015-11-21,20613361,Ben,"This was my second stay with Lee & Steve. Though brief this time, it was just as good as the first, and I'm looking forward to staying with them again in their beautiful and quiet oasis in the midst of Seattle."
7349099,39718864,2015-07-25,19147309,Stephanie,Houssam was great with my last minute booking and was very prompt with any questions that I had! 
7349099,40178940,2015-07-28,25723369,Paty,Houssams apartment was perfect. Everything was exactly as described and ready for us when we arrived.  Very quick in responding to my last minute requests.  Definitely would stay again!  A+
7349099,42500348,2015-08-13,10100985,Tyler,"Wonderful place, really nice people, no surprises, and great neighborhood!  Thanks so much for the hospitality, the space was perfect and the bed was comfy!  We will definitely be coming back :)"
7349099,42617699,2015-08-14,28353516,Andrew,Very nice and clean basement apartment with friendly host.  Houssam made us feel very welcome and the apartment was cozy.
7349099,43844900,2015-08-22,19116852,Edith,"I am a single young woman who stayed for a week at the basement apartment. The apartment was lovely. Complimentary chocolate as well, so welcoming!  It is a one bedroom with a study but with no doors dividing  the rooms except bathroom, but plenty of space! The pictures are exactly what you get. If you are looking for a cozy place to stay with an awesome family above you this place is it. You can hear some rumblings from upstairs but they don't start before quiet hours end in the morning and they end by 10:30 every night. If you want a quiet place to be in Seattle but not hear the bustle this place is great. Quick 20 minutes to get downtown Seattle on the bus, literally a 3 minute walk from the door of the apartment. The neighborhood is quite lovely too. If you stroll along 73rd towards 5th there are lovely homes and shops as well. The entire family were great hosts!  I would definitely stay again if I come back to Seattle! 
"
7349099,44570689,2015-08-27,15350167,Irene,Houssam was more than generous: he even gave my group beer! Great and easy communication. We blew a fuse and he was so chill about it. Really enjoyed our stay.
5695717,31383677,2015-05-04,31750120,Chris,I had a great experience staying at Colm's place. The place was exactly as pictured and Colm was very accommodating of our schedule. Would stay again.  
5695717,32026512,2015-05-12,29066999,Sang,"The place was fantastic. Clean and neat like the photos show, and  extremely accessible (We walked from the studio to Pike place and back without breaking a sweat). 

Didn't meet Colum in person as it seemed he was traveling, but he was great at keeping in touch and getting back to me with any questions I had prior and during the stay. Thank you so much Colum! "
5695717,32562004,2015-05-19,7291081,Austin,"Colum was a great host. He actively made sure we easily got access to the apartment. The apartment itself was very clean and as exactly as pictured. The location is great, but does get some noise from the street if that is a concern for you. I had a great time in Seattle in large part due to a great AirBnB experience. Thanks Colum! "
5695717,33269962,2015-05-26,26646610,Lizabeth,"This is a rad place. Colum was a wonderful host and made sure we would have easy access to the building/apartment. We didn't get to meet him as he was traveling, but he was great about answering questions and making sure we had everything we needed. The apartment was clean, perfect size for two, in an amazing location, easily within walking distance to anything you want to see (We walked to Westlake Center/Pike Place/Downtown very easily, and we like walking so we basically walked to Seattle Center and Belltown easily also). If you're not that into walking, it's about a $6 uber ride to the big places, which isn't terrible at all! The Capitol Hill neighborhood was a lot of fun to explore also. Most definitely would stay again. "
5695717,34011328,2015-06-03,16617670,Jane,"Colum gave us clear instructions about how to get into the apartment.  It was tidy and clean and on a nice street, very walkable to all of the fun things there are to do around Capitol Hill.  We felt free to come and go as we pleased, to use the kitchen, the wifi, etc.  It was, indeed,  very cozy. "
5695717,34552851,2015-06-09,31317380,Chris,The apartment was very cozy and has everything you'd need for any amount of time. Awesome location; walking distance from plenty of fun things to do. 
5695717,36112428,2015-06-25,34139722,Darryl,"Colum's space is well located, oUT of tour it central, but not out of the way enough to require travel by car.  Easy walk to many great restaraunts.  The walk to downtown is also easy - about 20 minutes - though the return trip is pretty steep.  Colum was out of town during our stay, but he provided easy directions to the apartment and keys.  The space is a pretty standard studio, small and clean, but not cramped."
5695717,36555184,2015-06-29,33237795,Carrie,"Colum provided a wonderful place for us to stay and made it simple and easy to access. The pictures are completely accurate and the space was very clean, nice, and exactly what we needed for the few days we were in town! It's also located in a really awesome location in Capitol Hill. Super close to everything in and around Capitol Hill, you could also walk to downtown pretty easily if you wanted to. I would definitely recommend staying here to anyone! "

5695717,38453779,2015-07-15,11073464,Geron,The listing was accurate.  Colum was on travel upon our arrival but left easy detailed instructions for retrieving the keys to his building and apartment.  His place was clean and cozy upon our arrival.  I would stay here again as his place was ideally situated in capitol hill and not far from downtown. 
5695717,39191566,2015-07-21,36229288,Jack,"Colum's place was cozy, clean and exactly what I was looking for. It's in a great location right next to Cal Anderson park in Capitol Hill near all the bars and restaurants. Me and my girlfriend definitely enjoyed the stay."
5695717,39784502,2015-07-26,12965361,Kristen,Great location in the awesome Capitol Hill neighborhood. Very close to a beautiful park and fantastic restaurants and bars. Colum was really helpful and easy to contact.

5695717,43305805,2015-08-18,1181367,Keith,"Comfy little place to call home while running around Seattle. Colum's place is in a good spot whether you wanted brunch (Americana), coffee (Espresso Vivace), books (Elliot Bay Books), or ice cream (Molly Moons). He was away during our stay, but he checked in mid-trip via text to make sure everything was going well — which it was!"
5695717,45722753,2015-09-05,8014002,Ankura,"This apartment was very clean and comfortable, and just a couple blocks from many great restaurants, cafes and bars. Ideal for a couple or a solo traveler visiting Seattle."

5695717,48948962,2015-09-29,44620577,Winston,"Colum's place was exactly as described. Small, cozy, clean, and a great location; perfect for a weekend in Seattle.

He left everything in great condition for me: fresh towels and bath supplies, a clean bathroom, an empty fridge, coasters and boardgames, very tidy.

Although I never had the pleasure of meeting him, his communication was timely and on point. Instructions for gaining entry were very clear and easy to follow.

The building is quiet and neighbours very respectful. The bed is comfortable (I had a great rest every night). Overall, superb!

Thanks Colum! Would stay at your place again in an instant  :)"
5695717,49859228,2015-10-06,45543998,Patrick,The apartment was clean and in an amazing location. Close to Broadway and Cal Anderson park.  Colum was quick to respond with any questions that I had and overall provided me with an amazing stay in Seattle! A+++
6728419,34686701,2015-06-10,35313969,Jonathan,"Theresa was an excellent host, providing a lovely array of snacks and even coffee for the next day! She was very pleasant and gracious overall. The property was a cozy little basement studio, very clean with newer amenities and a bathroom worthy of an upscale hotel! The neighborhood was quiet and it was easy to sleep and relax. I highly recommend Theresa and her property if you need a great place to stay that is a little more than a hotel room."
6728419,34756258,2015-06-11,16679590,Dana,"This was a fantastic  Air bnb stay! Beautiful studio apartment in a lovely neighborhood.  The apartment was very clean & comfortable.  Theresa is a great host! She made herself available to us, but the space was very private. "
6728419,35165285,2015-06-15,15980744,Yoel,"This was one of if not the best AirBNB experience I ever had. Theresa was incredibly accommodating. She helped coordinate my late arrival and was very helpful. As a host, she was a definite 10. But that's not all...

The place - let me tell you, it far exceeded expectations. It was clean, comfortable - very comfortable. The bed was awesome with tons of great pillows. The bathroom was out of MTV cribs - heated tile floors, a sweet 2 shower head shower... There was cheese and fruit waiting for me when I got in. The whole experience was awesome. Thank you so much."
6728419,35279171,2015-06-16,22970812,Oliver,"Theresa was a great host (the breakfast was delicious) and the apartment was roomy, private and had an incredibly comfortable bed. There are a number of coffee shops within walking distance of the apartment and a nearby bus station made getting downtown very easy. Would definitely recommend! "
6728419,36719880,2015-06-30,4132407,Gena,"Gosh, can't say enough about how wonderful it was to stay at Theresa's.  She had lovely snacks, and it was perfect.  We felt very comfortable and at home there.  Spotless and beautiful.  Everything worked.  Loved the shower, my first rain shower.  Theresa is a very nice lady.  I would never stay any where else if I was in the Seattle area.  Centrally located, nice neighborhood.  I sat in the back yard for several hours reading.  We also used her BBQ and made a nice dinner and ate outside.  Perfect hostess, perfect stay."
6728419,36995417,2015-07-03,35260068,Rebecca,Theresa was so kind and accommodating!  :) She gave us homemade (delicious) cookies! Her place is incredibly comfortable and beautiful.  She pays attention to detail so her guests really benefit!
6728419,37497729,2015-07-07,16154917,Jay,"This is one nice basement! We also enjoyed the shaded garden just outside our door. Theresa was generous with her time to make sure we were comfortable, and with food and drinks, which were a great touch.  We  stayed for two nights, and could not have been happier with our choice of Seattle accommodations.
"
6728419,37694883,2015-07-09,9821712,Michelle,"Theresa's private basement suite was the perfect space for a mini Seattle vacation. Location is in a quiet neighborhood within minutes of Univ. Washington and a short drive to Pike's Place Market. Theresa and I had great communication, amenities were abundant and the rain shower is a luxurious bonus. Theresa has a way about making you feel at home with a soft bed, sweet cloud-like pastries that she leaves for you when you walk through the doors and a cute little kitty-cat pitcher of creamer for your coffee in the morning. I would definitely look up Theresa again when I am back in the Seattle area."
6728419,38010507,2015-07-12,10666402,Yana,"The guest suite is cozy and nicely decorated. Theresa is a wonderful host. She was easy to get in touch with, provided a whole lot of delicious snacks for us; she stopped by to say hello when we arrived but let us have our privacy for the rest of the stay. "
6728419,38173018,2015-07-13,14209126,Jessica,"Theresa was an amazing host!  The apartment was adorable, clean and had heated tile in the bathroom floors. Will definitely stay again next time I'm in Seattle!"
6728419,38419010,2015-07-15,26432981,Sarah,"We had a perfect time and will definitely stay again. The guest suite is beautiful and comfortable. Perfectly appointed with lovely ""spa"" colors and patterns - from plates, wine glasses to linens everything is just wonderful. We were greeted with fresh berries, apples, tea/coffee, English muffins, jam and fresh baked shortbread cookies. All presented on pretty serving pieces. Theresa stocked refrigerator with yogurt, juice, water and even a bottle of wine. We enjoyed sitting in the garden and the home was perfectly quiet at night for sleeping. Shower is fantastic as well - two shower heads and heated floor in bathroom.. Love the neighborhood - two high end grocery stores nearby and Magnuson Park on the water with Mt. Ranier in full view (had picnic in park). Easy to get around on side streets - can avoid I-5 to get downtown. Can't say enough great things. Super convenient to UW and Seattle U. Theresa is a wonderful host. Oh, also check out the Sand Point Grill for dinner (Theresa's suggestion - great food). "
6728419,38642301,2015-07-17,4076408,Eidan,"Accurate description of the suite.  Very cute backyard area and daylight basement suite with kitchenette, sleeping area and large bathroom.  Theresa made us feel very welcome greeting us when we arrived and supplying a wonderful spread of snacks and breakfast foods!  We were able to walk to a nearby Italian restaurant which we really enjoyed.  There were a couple markets within walking distance too.  Theresa was easy to communicate with and prompt.  I would definitely recommend this spot!  The gas fireplace was very charming, but it was a hot day so we didn't use it.  That would be very cozy in the winter."
6728419,39634156,2015-07-25,35312011,Holly,"My husband and I were warmly welcomed; and the suite was beautifully detailed.  Theresa's breakfasts were epicurean delights; and the refrigerator was nicely stocked with a selection of snacks (quite unexpected)  
The suite was so very comfortable; and even with the unusual warm weather for Seattle, Theresa had the foresight to supply us with a fan....that easily did the trick.  
Grocery stores were close by and very convenient.  Quiet neighborhood.
The back patio was so welcoming and pretty that I invited my friends over for wine and hor d'oeuvres
We loved our experience; and appreciated our hostess.
"
6728419,39859571,2015-07-26,38878002,Karen,"This suite was just as described. It was cozy, spacious, spotlessly clean and very comfortable. It is very nicely decorated; the bed was comfortable and the neighbourhood was quiet. Theresa left some fruit, cheese, yogurt and granola for us for snacking or breakfast, as well as cream in the fridge for morning coffee. It is a very short drive to downtown, maybe 10-15 minutes although I didn't time it. This was our first time using Airbnb for accommodation and I must say we are very pleased. Thanks again Theresa! "
6728419,39946825,2015-07-27,35280968,Annie,"Theresa was a wonderful host and so accommodating! The bed was comfortable, and the bathroom was great (heated floors!). The place is exactly as described, maybe even better. The snacks, coffee, yogurt, and granola were a nice touch as well. We would stay here again in a heartbeat and will recommend it to friends looking to stay in the area."
6728419,40130951,2015-07-28,37162312,Mikenna,"This was my first time using Airbnb while traveling and it could not have been a better experience! Theresa was incredible. Her suite was beautiful, she was incredibly kind and helpful and she went above and beyond. We were greeted with a warm welcome, cookies, tea, fresh fruit and cheeses and my boyfriend and I were just so tickled to be greeted that way. We absolutely loved our stay and will definitely be using more Airbnb and would highly recommend staying at Theresa's if you're ever staying in Seattle."
6728419,40937551,2015-08-03,3259411,Matthew & Jessica,We didn't get to meet Theresa because she was out of town the weekend we stayed but her instructions to get in were straightforward enough. We were greeted by a clean and spacious guest suite with a lovely breakfast spread and delicious madeleine cookies. The bathroom was beautifully renovated with a double shower head that more than accommodated my tall husband. The neighborhood was cute with plenty of parking and nearby coffee shops & grocery stores. Highly recommended.
6728419,41422964,2015-08-07,30207331,Pamela,She greeted us at the car and helped us in. Left us a wonderful snack including some homemade cookies that melted in you mouth. Helped us get settled and made sure we were as comfortable as could be. 
6728419,42133981,2015-08-11,12591555,Patrick,"Theresa is a terrific host!  She even found some toys for my young daughter to play with (which she loved) prior to our arrival.  The apartment was clean and private, and she provided us with a lot of snacks and drinks in the apartment, along with cooking us a small breakfast in the morning. The heated bathroom floors were also a plus! We had a great time staying here and would definitely recommend it!"
6728419,42552416,2015-08-14,9720883,Veronique,"The description of Theresa's apartment is accurate. I would add that she also has a gorgeous garden. Theresa is incredibly welcoming, and goes out of her way to make sure you have a pleasant stay. She welcomed us with all sorts of goodies : wine, cheese, yoghurt. She was discreet when we wanted and present when we needed. We couldn't have hoped for a better hostess. The place is alos conveniently located with plenty of parking place if you have a car. Buses run nearby too."
6728419,42695098,2015-08-15,3627158,Amy,"Extremely comfortable and cozy space. Theresa provided so many nice extras like: baked goods and other breakfast treats, lotion, toothpaste, etc. We only stayed one night but I wish we could have stayed more. Very quiet, easy access from I-5 and plenty of parking. Highly recommended!"
6728419,43243062,2015-08-18,7776265,Emily,"Theresa was a fabulous host. She truly goes above and beyond to make her guests feel welcome, and it shows. The downstairs apartment was extremely clean and felt newly renovated (especially the bathroom/shower - so luxurious!). Theresa provided us with yogurts, homemade granola, cookies, coffee, and more, which was so nice to have in the mornings for breakfast. Coming and going through the private entrance was a breeze, and we enjoyed sitting on the back patio during our last evening in Seattle. We would absolutely stay here again!"
6728419,43941840,2015-08-23,36802910,Rio,Theresa was an excellent host! She was very accommodating to us before and during our stay. She left us with goodies which I thought was very sweet and thoughtful. The place was the right fit for a party of two. It was very cozy and had a lot of privacy. My favorite part was the bathroom - gosh it felt like a 5 star hotel bathroom. It is just about 10/15 minutes from downtown. I definitely would stay here again if given a chance to go back to Seattle.  Thanks again Theresa!
6728419,46717188,2015-09-13,37373207,Nancy,"Theresa has a charming, lovely space for travelers to rest their weary heads. Not only that, but she has thought of every amenity you might need....coffee, tea, yogurt, fruit and fabulous homemade bakery goods!  Theresa should be a designer because her airbnb space is appointed with so many beautiful touches!  Thank you, Theresa, for a wonderful stay in Seattle.  We loved your recommendation for The Grateful Bread....the food and staff there are awesome!  We sure hope to get back to Seattle, and next time we would love to spend more time in your beautiful garden!"
6728419,47050215,2015-09-15,35392505,Lisa,Very nice place to stay in Seattle. We really appreciated the little extras which meant we did not have to get supplies immediately. 
6728419,47407949,2015-09-18,2023606,Cobin,"Theresa's guest suite is really a gem. The space is very clean, comfortable and welcoming. The baked goods and other treats she left were such a wonderful (and delicious) surprise! Theresa's home and the surrounding homes are quite nice- I felt very safe in the neighborhood. The suite has a private entrance via a beautiful backyard garden. The kitchen area was well appointed with appliances. The suite's bathroom was especially luxurious-  with a rainhead shower & heated floors. Theresa even programmed it so the floors were nice and warm upon my awakening! She pays very close attention to detail and is a wonderful host. Thanks Theresa! "
6728419,47674883,2015-09-21,34930815,Gladys,"What an amazing find! I honestly wanted to book another night but there was not enough time. I hope to visit again. Theresa is genuine & flexible. Her place is serene & comfortable. The bed was very comfortable & I slept like a baby. Thank you for providing breakfast. Theresa provided a variety of wholesome snacks. I sipped on some tea in her beautiful, lovely. Thank you for being an awesome host.  "

This place is divine!"
6728419,48239939,2015-09-24,43798437,Michael,"This was my first Airbnb experience. Theresa was a wonderful host, and was very accommodating to my needs throughout my stay. She even went out of her way to look up local directions for me when I first arrived. Her unit was exactly as listed, and was very cozy and comfortable. It is also just a short walk from a few nearby markets. There are bus stops, parks, and hiking trails in the area as well. I would definitely consider staying here again! Thank you Theresa!"
6728419,49103805,2015-10-01,9720883,Veronique,"Theresa is a fantastic host. Not only is she warm, welcoming and interesting, but she spoils you with a bunch of goodies : yoghurt, cheese, wine, coffee...
"
6728419,49963548,2015-10-07,1887439,Amy,"Theresa was a wonderful host.  She was kind to accommodate me on very short notice, and her place was a welcome retreat after a very long trip for me.  The bed was super cozy, the fireplace was so soothing with a book before bed, and I felt a general sense of calm in the space.  The wireless did not connect, but, this was a small bummer in light of the other awesome perks of the stay.  The garden in the back is like something out of a movie.  There are an assortment of fantastic novels on the shelves of the space.  Throughout my trip Theresa was reachable if I needed her.  I hope to have an opportunity to stay here again in the future for a longer visit."
6728419,50138094,2015-10-09,31409615,Judy,Theresa has a beautiful apartment with lovely amenities and thoughtful touches.  The bathroom in this apartment is something to see!  Beautiful!

6728419,52943171,2015-11-02,8753255,Barbara And Dick,"This is a lovely place to stay near the University of Washington. The neighborhood is lovely and quiet. It is located an easy 2 miles from the UW and in our case, an easy walk. Teresa greeted us warmly, dressed for the soon to arrive Trick-or-treaters. Our home away was separate, quiet and very private - all that we could have expected. The home-made granola was to die for."
6728419,53508829,2015-11-09,20875784,Vince,"Theresa was amazing from the start. Greeted me and showed everything that I would need during my stay. She was always a phone call or text away if I had any questions. Very flexible with check in and check out. The place was amazing and truly felt like a home away from home. Quiet location. Exceptionally clean! Easy access to UW and downtown Seattle. Coming from Orange County, the fire place was perfect on a cold rainy night. Snacks and drinks were available in refrigerator. I would recommend staying here to anyone in a heartbeat. "
6728419,53992353,2015-11-15,28645449,Miles,"We were very pleased with our stay at Theresa's.  The bathroom and living area are beautiful.  The bed was really a fouton and we found it too soft- but outside of that we were very pleased.  Theresa was very accommodating and went above and beyond to make sure we could checkin and checkout to fit our schedules.  Her kitchen was stocked with wonderful granola, coffee, and other goodies.  "
6728419,54172234,2015-11-16,46896793,Julie,"This is the second time I've stayed at Theresa's lovely guest suite. All accolades! The place is better than advertised and Theresa is a wonderful host. Without hesitation, I will stay here again and again!"

6728419,57025606,2015-12-21,5885299,Alivia,"I cannot say enough good things about this place. Theresa greeted us when we arrived and showed us to the space in her home. It's on the lower level but feels completely separate from the whole house. It is so clean, spacious and beautiful. We were greeted too with cookies (she makes them!), granola, water, and yogurt. The room is just as pictured and was so nice to come back to a fireplace after a cold day in December. The location is a short drive to lots of fun shops and restaurants. Can't recommend this place enough, would definitely come back!"
6728419,58460201,2016-01-02,52598986,Jona,"Wonderful hospitality and some of the best cookies we've ever had! The fireplace, shower, and bed were some our favorite touches. Theresa was very welcoming and informative. Would absolutely stay here again and can't give a higher recommendation. "

Not only is it an amazing little quest house. Charlotte and Larry are perfect hosts. If you pay $150 per night you still got a deal. Best stay in Seattle!!!
Thanks guys we loved it and have never been so comfy..."
3689119,17477584,2014-08-12,19261553,Andres,"Charlotte and Larry's guest house was fantastic.  We stayed with our three-year old son and had a wonderful, relaxing stay.  Not only was the house comfortable and stocked with everything we needed, they went above and beyond, providing us a stroller for our son, and toys and books.

The location was perfect: a quiet residential neighborhood only 20 minutes walk from downtown Ballard, with easy car access to Downtown Seattle, and area parks.  If you need a friendly, convenient place to stay in Seattle, this is the perfect place."
3689119,17594888,2014-08-14,1288008,Carolyn,"I loved staying at Charlotte and Larry's garden guest house.

Thank you so much for your hospitality! "
3689119,18195483,2014-08-23,19252564,Lauren,"I can't say enough great things about Charlotte and Larry's guesthouse.  They are located in a great, quiet and cool neighborhood that is within walking distance of coffee shops, restaurants and bars.  The guesthouse is in a beautiful garden with several different sitting areas.  The guesthouse itself is compact, but comfy and has everything you need (including a nicely stocked kitchen with breakfast items).  Charlotte was out of town the days we were there, but Larry was warm, inviting and easy going.  He gave us some great tips of good things to do around town and fun places to eat.  Would 100% stay here again next time we are in Seattle."
3689119,18962703,2014-09-03,22913,Melanie,"Charlotte & Larry's Guest Cottage is comfortably nestled in the back of their lovely garden.  It is both private and tranquil, whilst simultaneously being located in the convenient and central neighborhood of Ballard in Seattle. While our interaction with them was limited, they greeted us with kindness and were attentive to our needs during the time of our stay.  The great care that they took in the provisions that were provided really spoke volumes about their concerns for our comfort. The cottage interior was peppered with very appealing and organic art that was both attractive and stimulating, yet relaxing and neutral.  Street parking was ample and the neighbors that we encountered were friendly.  Overall, our experience was a pleasant one and we would highly recommend this quaint cottage for a short stay."
3689119,19276316,2014-09-09,1828770,Belinda,Had a great time at  Charlotte and Larry's.   They were helpful when I needed it and let me amuse myself when I wanted.  The cottage was great with a hip Asian decor and lots of extra little touches.  Charlotte was excellent at encouraging me to take off on my bike availing myself of the close proximity to the designated bike routes.    I have no complaints and would happily rent this space the next time I'm in Seattle. Thank you!

We would stay there again!"
3689119,19528711,2014-09-14,8383467,John,"My wife and I stayed at the garden guest house and couldn't have had a better time. It was tucked away on a quiet street, and felt very private the entire time of our stay. The house is only a couple blocks from some pubs and eateries. We also walked to downtown Ballard a couple of times as it was only a 15 minute walk. 

Larry and Charlotte made us feel very welcome from the instant we met them. The room was clean and was filled with almost every amenity. They even had a chocolate bar, yogurt and granola, and orange juice for our stay! The outside patio with chairs and tables make for a wonderful breakfast spot!

This was our first Airbnb stay and we will definitely use it way more thanks to our great stay with Larry and Charlotte!"

Aside from all of the little personal touches, such as finding coffee, half and half, granola, organic dark chocolate bar, etc. already stocked, as well as the helpful and welcoming atmosphere, their little garden guest house was like a little peaceful sanctuary with access to downtown Seattle within a half hour or less, and within walking distance of the zoo and Green Lake."
